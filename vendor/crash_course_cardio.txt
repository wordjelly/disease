Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series first published in 1997 and now, 15 years on, we are still
going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series
relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions build on
the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material, to keep
the series up-to-date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and student
reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have completely
re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s ‘single-best answer’
and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout of the titles
has also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during long
sessions of revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles
on which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming
at distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material
is checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Author
It is my long-held belief that establishing a firm understanding of the principles
behind what we learn is far more useful than simply remembering the relevant
facts. The cardiovascular system is central to the function of every organ in the
human body and a sound understanding of its structure and physiology is
paramount. In addition, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in
Western society and its importance cannot be overstated.
It is my hope that this book will provide a clear explanation of the basic principles of
cardiovascular physiology, and bring these together with an introduction to the
common disease processes and the drugs that can be used to treat them. It can serve as
a revision aid for the time-pressed student but also provides some extra detail for those
students aiming for honours. I do not expect it to replace the more comprehensive
texts, but I hope that you find it a valuable addition to your reading that can help clarify
points of confusion and save you precious time in the run up to exams.

The excellent Crash Course series summarizes the key learning points for the
‘information overloaded’ undergraduate medical student. The series format
enhances learning through concise text, comprehension check boxes, and hints and
tips boxes. The key salient points are presented in a user friendly and easy to read
manner that enables the rapid assimilation of core knowledge.
The third edition of Crash Course: Cardiovascular System has been updated to
provide contemporary emphasis on the cardiovascular system including current
concepts of disease and emerging novel therapies. Complementary to the clinically
orientated Crash Course: Cardiology, the book highlights all the essential basic
knowledge that provides an invaluable foundation for application to clinical
practice. The book takes the reader through first principles to inform the basis and
presentation of cardiovascular disease, ultimately leading to the investigation and
management of common cardiovascular disorders. This logical sequential
progression enhances learning and understanding of the cardiovascular system in
clinical medicine.
This book is a ‘must’ for the time pressed student who needs to use their revision
time efficiently and effectively in the modern era of systems-based medical
education.

Overview of the
cardiovascular system

1

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe the functions of the cardiovascular system.
• Explain how the two circulations are organized.
• Understand how the flow and distribution of blood through the two circulations is governed.

WHY DO WE NEED
A CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM?
The cardiovascular system serves to provide rapid transport
of nutrients to the tissues in the body and allow rapid removalofwasteproducts.Insmaller,lesscomplexorganisms
than the human body there is no such system because
their needs can be met by simple diffusion. Evolution
of the cardiovascular system provided a means of aiding
the diffusion process, allowing the development of larger
organisms. The cardiovascular system allows nutrients:
• To diffuse into the system at their source (e.g. oxygen
from the alveoli).
• To travel long distances quickly.
• To diffuse into tissues where they are needed (e.g.
oxygen to working muscle).
This type of process is called convective transport,
and is an active process (i.e. it requires energy). This energy is provided by the heart. The functions of the
cardiovascular system rely on a medium for transport.
This medium is blood, which is made up of cells
(mainly red and white blood cells) and plasma (water,
proteins, electrolytes, etc.).

FUNCTIONS OF THE
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM
The main functions of the cardiovascular system are:
• Rapid transport of nutrients (oxygen, amino acids,
glucose, fatty acids, water, etc.).
• Removal of waste products of metabolism (carbon
dioxide, urea, creatinine, etc.).
• Hormonal control, by transporting hormones to
their target organs and by secreting its own hormones (e.g. atrial natriuretic peptide).
• Temperature regulation, by controlling heat distribution between the body core and the skin.

• Reproduction, by producing erection of the penis
and nutrition to the fetus via a complex system of
placental blood flow.
• Host defence, transporting immune cells, antigen
and other mediators (e.g. antibody).

THE HEART AND CIRCULATION
The heart is a double pump. It consists of two muscular
pumps (the left and right ventricles). Each pump has
its own reservoir (the left and right atrium). The two
pumps each serve a different circulation. In a normal
person, every blood cell flows first in one circulation
and then moves into the other.
The right ventricle is the pump for the pulmonary circulation. It receives blood from the right atrium, which
is then pumped into the lungs through the pulmonary
artery. Here it is oxygenated and gives up carbon dioxide; it then returns to the left atrium of the heart via
the pulmonary veins and then enters the left ventricle.
The left ventricle is the pump for the systemic circulation. Blood is pumped from the left ventricle to the rest of
the body via the aorta. In the tissues of the body, nutrients and waste products are exchanged. Blood (which
now carries less oxygen and more carbon dioxide)
returns to the right atrium via the superior and inferior
vena cavae. The two circulations operate simultaneously
and are arranged in series. Unidirectional flow is ensured
by the presence of valves in the heart and veins (Fig. 1.1).
The circulatory system is made up of arteries, veins,
capillaries, and lymphatic vessels:
• Arteries transport blood from the heart to the body
tissues.
• Capillaries are where diffusion of nutrients and
waste products takes place.
• Veins return blood from the tissues to the heart. (The
hepatic portal vein is an exception. This transports
blood from the intestines to the liver.)

HINTS AND TIPS
Arteries carry oxygenated blood and veins carry
deoxygenated blood. The two exceptions to this rule
are the pulmonary and umbilical vessels (supplying the
fetus) where this is reversed.

the arterial tree and valves in the venous system.

The amount of blood ejected from one ventricle during 1 minute is called the cardiac output. The cardiac
output of each ventricle is equal overall, but there
may be occasional beat-by-beat variation. The entire
cardiac output of the right ventricle passes through
the lungs and into the left side of the heart. The cardiac
output of the left ventricle passes into the aorta, and it is
distributed to various organs and tissues according to
their metabolic requirements or particular functions
(e.g. the kidney receives 20% of cardiac output so that
its excretory function can be maintained). This distribution can be changed to meet changes in demand (e.g.
during exercise, the flow to the skeletal muscle is
increased considerably).
Blood is driven along the vessels by pressure. This pressure, which is produced by the ejection of blood from
the ventricles, is highest in the aorta (about 120 mmHg
above atmospheric pressure) and lowest in the great veins
(almost atmospheric). It is this pressure difference that
moves blood through the arterial tree, through the
capillaries, and into the veins.

Objectives

You should be able to:
• Describe the anatomy of the heart and great vessels.
• Describe the arterial and venous anatomy of the major vascular beds.
• Describe the development of the heart and vasculature.

ANATOMY

The mediastinum
This is the space between the two pleural cavities. It contains all the structures of the chest except the lungs and
pleura. The mediastinum extends from the superior thoracic aperture to the diaphragm and from the sternum to
the vertebrae and is divided into superior and inferior
parts by the plane passing from the sternal angle to
the T4/T5 intervertebral disc. The inferior mediastinum
is then further subdivided into anterior, middle and
posterior parts (Fig. 2.1). The contents of each part
are shown in (Fig. 2.2). The structures in the mediastinum are surrounded by loose connective tissue, nerves,
blood and lymph vessels. It can accommodate movement and volume changes.
The heart is in the middle mediastinum, and it has
the following relations:

and with the tunica adventitia of the great vessels.
When fluid accumulates within the pericardial sac
this is called a pericardial effusion. If it accumulates
quickly and begins to affect cardiac function it is
called cardiac tamponade. (Both are described in
Ch. 8.)

External structure of the heart
The heart lies obliquely about two-thirds to the left and
one-third to the right of the median plane (Figs 2.4–
2.6). It has the following surfaces:
• The base of the heart is located posteriorly and
formed mainly by the left atrium.
• The apex of the heart is formed by the left ventricle
and is posterior to the fifth intercostal space.

In approximately 1% of the population, the aortic valve
is bicuspid (has only two cusps). This usually goes
unnoticed but puts a person at increased risk of
developing aortic stenosis.

These are anatomical relations – see Chapter 8 for
auscultatory areas.

The heart borders of the anterior surface are as
follows:
• Right: right atrium.
• Left: left ventricle and left auricle.
• Inferior: right ventricle mainly and part of left
ventricle.
• Superior: right and left auricles.
HINTS AND TIPS
When examining the cardiovascular system it is
important to remember that the right ventricle lies
anteriorly and faces the sternocostal surface. In
certain conditions causing pulmonary hypertension,
the right ventricle is forced to work excessively
hard, and this can be felt as a heave on the
precordium.

The coronary arteries are shown in Figs 2.8 and 2.9.
The left coronary artery arises just distal to the left
anterior cusp of the aortic valve. The right coronary
artery arises from the right anterior aortic sinus just
above the right anterior cusp of the aortic valve. The
coronary arteries are the first branches of the aorta;
the heart supplies itself with a blood supply before
any other organ.
Knowledge of the arterial supply to the myocardium
is essential in determining which vessel is affected in
ischaemic heart disease, and allows us to predict the
sequelae of an event. Inferior infarcts caused by
disease of the right coronary artery, for example, are
more prone to bradyarrhythmias as this artery also
supplies the sinoatrial (SA) and atrioventricular
(AV) nodes.

Coronary veins
The coronary veins drain mainly into the coronary
sinus, which drains directly into the right atrium
(Figs 2.10 and 2.11). There are some small veins that
drain directly into the heart chambers. Generally, these
drain into the right side of the heart.

Great vessels
Internal structure of the heart
The internal structure of the heart is shown in Fig. 2.7.
The right atrium contains the orifices of the superior
and inferior venae cavae and coronary sinus. The right
ventricle is separated from the right atrium by the
tricuspid (three cusps) valve. The right ventricle is
separated from its outflow tract (the pulmonary trunk)
by the pulmonary valve. This has three semilunar valve
cusps.
The left atrium has the orifices of four pulmonary
veins in its posterior wall and is separated from the left
ventricle by the mitral (sometimes referred to as bicuspid, i.e. two cusps) valve. The left ventricle is

‘Great vessels’ is the term used to denote the large arteries and veins that are directly related to the heart. The
great arteries include the pulmonary trunk and the
aorta (and sometimes its three main branches: the
brachiocephalic, the left common carotid and the left
subclavian). The great veins include the pulmonary
veins and the superior and inferior venae cavae. The
great vessels and their thoracic branches are illustrated
in Figs 2.12–2.14.

branch. The anterior interventricular branch supplies both
ventricles and the interventricular septum. The circumflex
branch supplies the left atrium and the inferior part of the left
ventricle. The right coronary artery supplies the sinoatrial (SA)
node via the right atrial branch.

Cerebrovascular disease is the most common
neurological problem experienced in the Western
world. It occurs as the result of clot deposition, or more
rarely from a bleed, in the circle of Willis. The circle,
being a complete anastomosis, allows blood to flow
irrespective of a small blockage, minimizing the
neurological insult of the stroke.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE
HEART AND GREAT
VESSELS
The heart develops in the cardiogenic region of the
mesoderm from week 3. This region is at the cranial
end of the embryonic disc. Angioblastic cords (aggregates of endothelial cell precursors) develop and here
they coalesce to form two lateral endocardial tubes.
During week 4, these tubes fuse together to form the
primitive heart tube and the heart begins to pump
(Fig. 2.28).
From weeks 5 to 8, the primitive heart tube folds
and remodels to form the four-chambered heart.

right ventricle and interventricular septum. It may also
supply part of the left atrium and left ventricle. The nodal

The primitive atrium will give rise to parts of both
future atria. The primitive ventricle will make up most
of the left ventricle. The bulbus cordis will form the right
ventricle. The truncus arteriosus will form the ascending
aorta and the pulmonary trunk.

HINTS AND TIPS
There are many difficult terms in embryology. Try to
understand them by considering what process the term
describes. For example, the septum primum is the first
(primus means first in Latin) septum to form and
septum secundum is the second septum to form.

Venous blood initially enters the sinus horns of the
sinus venosus from the cardinal veins (a branch of
the umbilical vein). Within the next few weeks, the
whole systemic venous return is shifted to the right

8

sinus horn through the newly formed superior and inferior venae cavae. The left sinus horn becomes the
coronary sinus, which drains the myocardium.
In weeks 5–6, the septum primum and the septum
secundum grow to separate the right and left atria
(Fig. 2.30). These septa are incomplete and leave two
openings (foramina or ostia) that allow blood to move
between the atria. The septum primum grows downwards from the superior, posterior wall. The foramen (ostium primum) it creates narrows as the septum grows.
While the septum primum is growing, a thicker septum secundum also starts to form. This septum secundum does not meet the septum intermedium, leaving

changes that bring the atria and ventricles into their correct positions and align the outflow tracks with the
ventricles.
The inferior part of the bulboventricular sulcus grows
into the muscular ventricular septum. Growth stops in
week 7 to wait for the left outflow track to develop, leaving an interventricular foramen.
In weeks 7–8, the truncus arteriosus (the common
outflow tract of the heart) is divided in two by a spiral
process of central septation, which results in the formation of the aorta and pulmonary trunk. This septum is
called the truncoconal septum. This septum also grows
into the ventricles, and it forms the membranous ventricular septum, which joins the muscular ventricular
septum. This completes the septation of the ventricles.
Swellings develop at the inferior end of the truncus
arteriosus, and these give rise to the arterial (pulmonary
and aortic) valves.

Development of the vasculature
The vasculature develops from the angioblastic cords of
mesoderm. The aortic ends of the primitive heart tube become the aortic arches and dorsal aortae. The aortic arches
develop into the great arteries of the neck and thorax,
whereas the dorsal aortae produce the following branches:
• Ventral branches (derived from the remnants of the
vitelline arteries), which supply the gastrointestinal
tract.
• Lateral branches, which supply retroperitoneal structures (e.g. kidneys).
• Intersegmental branches, which supply the rest of
the body.
The paired dorsal aortae connect to the umbilical
arteries, which carry blood to the placenta. The venous
system consists of three components, which are initially
paired:
• Cardinal system, which drains the head, neck, body
wall, and limbs.
• Vitelline veins, which drain the yolk sac.
• Umbilical veins, which carry blood from the placenta to the embryo.

12

Posterior view

Initially, the venous system drains into the sinus
horns, and subsequently into the venae cavae and right
atrium. In general, it is the right-sided veins that persist
while the left-sided veins regress during gestation, and
so systemic venous drainage is via the vena cava to
the right side of the heart.
Within the liver, the vitelline system forms the ductus
venosus, shunting blood from the umbilical vein directly into the inferior vena cava during gestation. This
is vital, as it allows oxygenated blood to enter the right
atrium of the heart, pass predominantly through the
foramen ovale and then be pumped around the fetus.
The foramen ovale enables the oxygenated blood in the
right atrium to pass into the left atrium and reach the systemic circulation, bypassing the pulmonary circulation.
The ductus arteriosus develops from the sixth aortic
arch. It connects the pulmonary arteries to the descending aorta. This allows oxygenated blood pumped into
the pulmonary arteries (i.e. blood not shunted through
the foramen ovale) to enter the systemic circulation.
This is necessary as the lungs are not functional during
gestation, negating the need for a large pulmonary circulation. The duct is kept open during fetal life by

circulating prostaglandins, and this stimulation may be
continued artificially early in the neonatal period.
The head receives a preferential blood supply, so if
there is a decrease in umbilical artery supply the head
will continue to receive an adequate blood supply at
the expense of the rest of the body (i.e. the head grows
but the body does not).
Deoxygenated blood returns to the placenta through
the umbilical arteries, which connect to the aorta.
Multiple measurements are taken at ultrasound scan in
pregnant women, including Doppler flow studies of the
umbilical vessels, and head/abdomen circumference
ratio. If there is decreased arterial supply, intrauterine
growth retardation (IUGR) can be predicted and
monitored by serial measurements showing a failure in
growth of abdominal circumference.

• Compression of the cord.
• Vasoconstriction in response to cold, mechanical

drop in the right atrium and a pressure rise in the left
atrium (caused by an increased pulmonary venous return to the left atrium). This changes the pressure gradient across the atrial septum and forces the flexible
septum primum against the rigid septum secundum,
closing the foramen ovale. These two septa fuse together
after about 3 months.
The ductus venosus closes soon after birth. The
mechanism is unclear, but it is thought to involve prostaglandin inhibition. The closure is not vital to life, as
the umbilical vein no longer carries any blood. The remnant of the ductus venosus is the ligamentum venosus.
The ductus arteriosus closes 1–8 days after birth. It is
thought that as the pulmonary vascular resistance falls,
the pressure drop in the pulmonary trunk causes blood
to flow from the aorta into the pulmonary trunk
through the ductus arteriosus. This blood is oxygenated
and the increase in PO2 causes the smooth muscle in the
wall of the ductus to constrict dye to decreased prostaglandin production, obstructing the flow in the ductus
arteriosus. Eventually, the intima of the ductus arteriosus thickens – complete obliteration of the ductus results in the formation of the ligamentum arteriosum,
which attaches the pulmonary trunk to the aorta.

Congenital abnormalities
The embryological development of the heart is a complex process involving many coordinated steps.
Defects arise if the process does not occur correctly.
Congenital heart defects have an incidence of
6–8 per 1000 live-born infants. They may present in
the first year of life, during childhood or remain
asymptomatic for life. When thinking about the
effects of a given congenital abnormality, it is important to consider the pressure gradients that are present within the cardiovascular system as these will
determine where blood flows and for the most part
allow you to understand the symptoms and signs
that arise.

At birth, the pulmonary vascular resistance falls rapidly because:

Left-to-right shunts

• The thorax of the fetus is compressed on descent,
emptying the amniotic fluid from the lungs.
• The mechanical effect of ventilation opens the constricted alveolar vessels.
• Raising PO2 and lowering PCO2 cause vasodilatation
of the pulmonary vessels.

Left-to-right shunts very rarely cause cyanosis because
all the blood is passing through the pulmonary circulation and being oxygenated.

This produces an increase in the pulmonary blood
flow.
The sudden cessation of umbilical blood flow and
the opening of the pulmonary system causes a change
in the pressure balance in the atria. There is a pressure

Atrial septal defect
An atrial septal defect (ASD) is caused by a failure of
proper closure of the foramen ovale or by a defect in
the septum secundum. Blood moves from the left
atrium into the right atrium because of the pressure gradient (Fig. 2.34). Atrial septal defects make up 10% of
all congenital heart defects.

G. Illustrated textbook of paediatrics, 2nd edn. London:
Mosby, 2001.)

Ventricular septal defect
A ventricular septal defect (VSD) is a failure of fusion of
the interventricular septum (Fig. 2.35). Blood shunts
through a hole in the interventricular septum down
the pressure gradient from the left ventricle to the right
ventricle. If there is a large left-to-right shunt, there will
be a great deal of blood entering the right ventricle
and pulmonary circulation, causing pulmonary hypertension. Eventually, the pulmonary hypertension will
cause irreversible damage to the pulmonary vasculature.

Fig. 2.36 Eisenmenger’s syndrome. The shunt has reversed
(and now goes from right to left). Less blood now goes into the
pulmonary trunk and the patient becomes cyanosed.
(Courtesy of Lissauer T, Clayden G. Illustrated textbook of
paediatrics, 2nd edn. London: Mosby, 2001.)

The increased pressures in the right side of the heart may
eventually lead to reversal of the shunt from right to
left. This phenomenon, known as Eisenmenger’s syndrome, is irreversible and causes cyanosis (Fig. 2.36).

Patent ductus arteriosus
Patent ductus arteriosus is when the ductus arteriosus
fails to close, allowing communication of blood between the systemic and pulmonary circulations
(Fig. 2.37). In preterm infants, the duct will ultimately
close, but it can be closed with indometacin (inhibits
prostaglandin production), or it may require closure
with a catheter-delivered device.

When considering congenital disorders of the heart,
it is important to visualize the pressure changes that
occur in the cardiac cycle in order to work out which
shunting mechanism and murmur occurs with each
defect. For example, in a ventricular septal defect the
left ventricular pressure is greater than the right
because of its larger muscle mass, so, therefore, blood
is going to flow from left to right. As this shunt occurs
throughout systole a pansystolic murmur occurs.
Cyanosis does not occur unless deoxygenated blood
‘dilutes’ oxygenated blood before entering the
systemic circulation.

Development of the heart and great vessels

Fig. 2.37 Patent ductus arteriosus. This is often found
with coarctation of the aorta (shown). It allows mixing of
systemic and pulmonary blood. Movement of blood
within the ductus can occur in both directions depending
upon the relative pressures in the aorta and the
pulmonary trunk. (Courtesy of Lissauer T, Clayden G.

Right-to-left shunts
Right-to-left shunts commonly cause cyanosis early in
life. Clubbing commonly develops in cyanotic congenital heart disease.

Tetralogy of Fallot (Fig. 2.38) is a combination of:

Large ventricular septal defect.
Pulmonary stenosis
Right ventricular hypertrophy.
Aorta overriding the interventricular septum.

Corrective surgery is required, which can be started at
4–6 months of age.

Transposition of the great arteries
Transposition of the great arteries occurs when the
truncoconal septum develops, but it does not spiral
(Fig. 2.39). The left ventricle pumps blood into the pulmonary trunk and the right ventricle pumps blood into
the aorta creating two closed systems. There is usually
also an atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect or
patent ductus arteriosus, allowing blood from the two
systems to mix, otherwise this would be incompatible
with life.

Fig. 2.39 Transposition of the great arteries. This is
incompatible with life without a ventricular (VSD) or atrial septal
defect (ASD) or a patent ductus arteriosus. (Courtesy of Lissauer
T, Clayden G. Illustrated textbook of paediatrics, 2nd edn.

Obstructive congenital defects
Coarctation of the aorta
Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta
around the area of the ductus arteriosus (Fig. 2.40). It
is frequently associated with a ventricular septal defect
or a bicuspid aortic valve and is important to consider
in a young person with hypertension.

Tissue layers of the heart and

Fig. 2.41 Tissue layers of the heart and pericardium
(CT, connective tissue).

Pericardium

Epicardium

The pericardium consists of an outer fibrous pericardial
sac, enclosing the whole heart, and an inner double
layer of flat mesothelial cells, called the serous pericardium. The two layers of the serous pericardium are:

The epicardium is a thin layer of connective tissue that
contains adipose tissue, nerves and the coronary arteries
and veins.

• The parietal pericardium, which is attached to the
fibrous sac.
• The visceral pericardium, which forms part of the
epicardium and which covers the heart’s outer
surface.

Myocardium

The serous pericardium produces approximately
50 mL of pericardial fluid, which sits in the pericardial
cavity formed by the parietal and visceral layers. The primary function of this fluid is to provide lubrication so
that the heart can move within the pericardium during
the cardiac cycle.

Heart
The heart itself contains three layers:
• Epicardium.
• Myocardium.
• Endocardium.

18

Myocardium is the thickest layer of the heart, and it is
made up of cardiac muscle cells. The thickness of the
myocardium is greatest in the left ventricle and smallest
in the atria. All the muscle layers attach to the fibrocollagenous heart skeleton, which provides a stable base
for contraction. The atrial myocardium secretes atrial
natriuretic peptide (ANP) when stretched, promoting
salt and water excretion. The ventricular myocardium,
however, secretes brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) when
stretched. While this is rather a misnomer, it is increasingly being used to monitor left ventricular dysfunction
in heart failure.

Endocardium
The endocardium has three layers: an outermost connective tissue layer (which contains nerves, veins and
Purkinje fibres), a middle layer of connective tissue
and an endothelium of flat endothelial cells.

The fibrous heart skeleton consists of fibrotendinous
(fibrocollagenous) rings of dense connective tissue that
encircle the base of the aorta and pulmonary trunk and
the atrioventricular openings (Fig. 2.42). The heart
valves and cardiac muscle attach to these rings and they
form a solid base on which the heart can contract. The
fibrous structure also electrically insulates the atria from
the ventricles. The membranous interventricular septum is a downward extension of the fibrocollagenous
tissue, and it contains the bundle of His. The atrioventricular node and the bundle of His form the only
conduction pathway through the skeleton in health
and, therefore, the only electrical link between the atria
and the ventricles. The Wolff–Parkinson–White
syndrome (discussed in Ch. 3) is caused by an additional conduction pathway between the atria and
ventricles.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is important to remember that despite being
commonly referred to as the heart skeleton, it is formed
from fibrous connective tissue, NOT bone.

Valves
The heart valves are avascular (i.e. they have no blood
supply) (Fig. 2.43). This is important if bacteria invade
the valves, because there is little immune reaction and
infective endocarditis may result. Their avascular nature

Cardiac myocytes
There are three types of myocytes – work myocytes,
nodal cells and conduction fibres:
• Work myocytes are the main contractile cells.
• Nodal cells make up the SA node and AV node, and
generate cardiac electrical impulses.
• Conduction (Purkinje) fibres have a greater diameter than work myocytes (70–80 mm) and allow
fast conduction of action potentials around the
heart.

Ultrastructure of the typical
cardiomyocyte
The typical cardiac myocyte (Fig. 2.44) has the following features:
• Length of 50–100 mm (shorter than skeletal muscle
fibres).
• Diameter of 10–20 mm.
• Single, central nucleus.
• Branched structure.
• Attached to neighbouring cells via intercalated disks
at the branch points. These cell junctions consist of
desmosomes (which hold the cells together via
proteoglycan bridges) and gap junctions (which
allow electrical conductivity).
• Many mitochondria arranged in rows between the
intracellular myofibrils.

Fig. 2.44 Cardiac myocyte arrangement. Myocytes are branched, and they attach to each other through desmosomes to form
muscle fibres. Gap junctions enable rapid electrical conductivity between cells. There is an extensive sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is
the internal Ca2þ store. The contractile elements within each cell produce characteristic bands and lines. In between each myofibril unit
there are rows of mitochondria. Accompanying blood vessels and connective tissue lie alongside each muscle fibre. (Redrawn with
permission from Tortora GJ, Grabowski SR. Principles of anatomy and physiology, 9th edn. New York: John Wiley & Sons, 2000.)

• T (transverse) tubules organized in diads with cisternae of sarcoplasmic reticulum (Fig. 2.45), which enable rapid electrical conduction deep into the cell,
activating the whole contractile apparatus.
• Extensive sarcoplasmic reticulum, which stores Ca2þ
ions necessary for electrical activity and contraction.
Each myocyte contains many myofibril-like units
(similar to the myofibrils of skeletal muscle) (Fig. 2.45).
These units are made up of sarcomeres attached end-toend and collected into a bundle. A sarcomere is the basic
contractile unit. It is composed of two bands, the A band
and the I band, between two Z lines.
• The A (anisotropic) band is made up of thick myosin
filaments and some interdigitating actin filaments.
• The I (isotropic) band is made up of thin actin filaments that do not overlap with myosin filaments.
Troponin and tropomyosin are also contained in
the thin filaments.
• The Z line is a dark-staining structure containing
a-actinin protein that provides attachment for the
thin filaments.

STRUCTURE OF THE VESSELS
The vessels of the circulatory system can be classified
anatomically or according to their function.

Anatomical classification
• Elastic arteries (e.g. aorta and common carotids).
• Muscular arteries (e.g. coronary, cerebral, and popliteal arteries).
• Arterioles.
• Capillaries.
• Postcapillary venules.
• Muscular venules.
• Veins.

Functional classification

Conductance: elastic arteries and muscular arteries.
Resistance: primarily arterioles.

Capacitance: venules and veins.

All blood vessels, except capillaries and venules, have
walls made up of three main layers (or tunicae):
• Tunica intima: composed of a single layer of highly
specialized endothelial cells that sit on a basement
membrane and a very thin layer of connective tissue.
• Tunica media: composed primarily of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue. There is a layer of elastic
tissue either side of the muscular part, the internal
elastic lamina and the external elastic lamina. The tunica media is most prominent in arteries. In the

elastic arteries, the elastic component is more prominent and in muscular arteries and arterioles vascular
smooth muscle predominates.
• Tunica adventitia: composed of connective tissue
such as collagen. Within this layer run the autonomic nerves that innervate the vascular smooth
muscle. In thick walled vessels, small blood vessels
called vasa vasorum are present in the adventitia,

and send penetrating branches into the media to
supply the smooth muscle cells. The adventitia is
the most prominent layer in veins.

Conductance
These are low-resistance arteries with predominantly
elastic walls. Their role is delivery of blood to more distal
vessels, although they also have a small resistance role.

Resistance
These vessels are the small muscular arteries and arterioles, and they provide the main resistance to blood flow
in the circulatory system. Resistance vessels act to control local blood flow. Dilatation of these vessels lowers

22

Exchange
These vessels are the numerous capillaries that have very
thin walls. This optimizes their function, which is to allow rapid transfer of molecules between blood and
tissues.

resistance and increases blood flow (vasodilatation).
Constriction of these vessels increases resistance and decreases blood flow (vasoconstriction). They can, therefore, influence the exchange vessels by governing the
amount of blood that reaches them.

These vessels are thin-walled, low-resistance venules and
veins. They act as a variable reservoir of blood and contain almost two-thirds of the blood volume. These veins
are innervated by sympathetic venoconstrictor fibres
which, when stimulated, constrict the veins displacing
the blood back towards the heart. The presence of valves
in the larger veins aids return of blood to the heart.

Compliance of capacitance vessels
In the high-pressure arterial system, the relationship between volume and pressure within the vessels is almost
linear. This is not the case in the low-pressure veins and
venules. At low volumes the walls of the veins are not
being stretched and the veins collapse, becoming elliptical. As the volume in the vessel increases, the vein
becomes round but there is very little resistance as
the veins are very compliant at this stage. When they are
round, any further increase in volume is met with more
resistance as the inelastic wall is stretched and pressure increases quickly. Contraction of the smooth muscle within
the wall of the veins reduces the compliance of the wall
and there is a greater increase in pressure for a given
increase in volume. This is illustrated in Fig. 2.49.

active wall tension can be used to displace blood into the heart.

The wall of a capillary is made up of a single layer of
endothelial cells, which sit on a basement membrane.
These thin walls are well adapted to their function as
exchange vessels, providing the major site for gaseous
and solute exchange between the blood and the tissues.
Capillaries can be divided into two types depending on
the conformation of the endothelial layer. In continuous capillaries the endothelial cells form a complete
internal lining, while in fenestrated capillaries, the
endothelial lining is interrupted forming pores or fenestrations, allowing passage of certain molecules. The
structure of these two types of capillary is shown in
Fig. 2.50.

Lymphatic vessels
The structure of a lymphatic capillary is shown in
Fig. 2.51.

HINTS AND TIPS
The components of a vessel wall reflect that vessel’s
function. For example, if an arterial wall contains many
more elastic fibres than collagen fibres, it will be more
compliant than other vessels and better suited to act
as a conductance vessel.

Endothelial cells
Endothelial cells are highly specialized and play a key
role in cardiovascular function. The characteristic feature of endothelial cells on histological examination is
the presence of electron-dense, ovoid organelles called
Weibel–Palade bodies.

Fig. 2.51 Cross-section of a lymph capillary. Lymph capillaries
only allow flow into the lumen but not out. Overlapping
endothelial cells operate as one-way valves to accomplish this.
The anchoring filaments connect the endothelial cells to the
surrounding tissue. When surrounding tissues are swollen with
excess interstitial fluid (e.g. in inflammation) the filaments pull
the endothelial cells apart to increase lymphatic flow. The
discontinuous basal lamina (basement membrane) also allows
greater movement of fluids and solutes.

Endothelial cells are involved in:
• Control of vascular tone: production of various
dilator and constrictor substances that act on the
adjacent vascular smooth muscle tone.

24

The structure of vascular smooth muscle is shown in
Fig. 2.53. A mass of smooth muscle functions as if it
were a single unit.

Contraction of vascular smooth muscle
Contraction is initiated by a rise in intracellular [Ca2þ].
This leads to an actin–myosin interaction, which causes
shortening. The process differs from that in the myocardium in the following ways:
• Myosin light chain phosphorylation: unlike skeletal or cardiac muscle, the myosin in vascular
smooth muscle only becomes active if its light
chains are phosphorylated. The enzyme is activated by a calcium–calmodulin complex, which is
dependent on a rise in intracellular [Ca2þ] for its
formation.

• Sustained actin–myosin interactions enable vascular
smooth muscle to maintain tension for 0.3% of the
energy needed by skeletal muscle. The actin–myosin
interactions are long-lasting because of slow myosin
kinetics.

Effect of sympathetic innervation
Fig. 2.54 shows the mechanism of sympathetic
innervation.

Vascular smooth muscle relaxation
Vascular smooth muscle relaxation can be brought
about by three different mechanisms. Each mechanism
relies upon reducing intracellular [Ca2þ]:

• Hyperpolarization: hyperpolarizing the resting
membrane reduces the number of open Ca2þ channels, leading to a decrease in intracellular Ca2þ concentration and relaxation.
• Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)mediated vasodilatation (Fig. 2.55).
• Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)mediated vasodilatation (Fig. 2.56).
There are a number of small vessels (vasa nervorum)
which supply nerves in the body. In certain conditions,
such as diabetes, these vessels are targeted. As such,
the nerves become damaged and a neuropathy
develops. The neuropathy then predisposes to
subsequent joint damage and ulceration

Cardiac electrophysiology
and arrhythmia

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe the electrophysiological properties of the heart and its conduction system.
• Describe how the resting membrane potential is generated.
• Understand the ions and ion channels involved in generating the cardiac action potential.
• Understand the nature of the action potentials in nodal and myocardial cells and the factors that
influence them.
• Understand how the action potential brings about contraction.
• Understand the principles of electrocardiography.
• Describe the mechanisms by which arrhythmias arise and how they can be classified.
• Understand the drugs used in the treatment of arrhythmias.

INTRODUCTION
Unlike skeletal muscle, the heart possesses intrinsic
electrical activity and does not require nervous input to
initiate contraction. This activity originates at the sinoatrial (SA) node, a cluster of specialized myocytes that
depolarize spontaneously, often referred to as the pacemaker of the heart. Cardiomyocytes can be broadly
divided into two categories in terms of their electrophysiological behaviour and function, and the appearance of
their action potentials:
• Fast depolarizing cells such as atrial and ventricular
myocardial cells, and cells of the His–Purkinje system. These are often referred to as work myocytes.
• Slow depolarizing cells such as those forming the SA
node and atrioventricular (AV) node. These are often
referred to as pacemaker cells or nodal cells.

THE CONDUCTION SYSTEM
In order for the heart to function effectively, the electrical impulse/action potential generated by the SA node
must propagate through the heart in a coordinated
manner. This is facilitated by a specialized conduction
system (Fig. 3.1), and the presence of low resistance
gap junctions, which allow direct spread of depolarization between adjacent cells. Thus the heart is often
referred to as an electrical (functional) syncytium. The
SA node is located in the posterior wall of the right
atrium at the junction with the superior vena cava. From
the SA node, the impulse passes through the atrial myocardium to the AV node, where conduction is delayed

by approximately 100 ms to allow completion of atrial
contraction before depolarizing the ventricles. The AV
node, located at the top of the interventricular septum,
is the only point where current can pass through the fibrous skeleton from the atria to the ventricles (in a
healthy heart). The secondary function of the AV node
is as a backup pacemaker in situations when the SA
node ceases to function or communication between
the SA node and AV node is interrupted. The impulse
then enters the bundle of His, which splits into right
and left bundle branches. The left bundle branch then
splits once again into an anterior and a posterior hemifascicle. These bundles give off fine fibres composed of
specialized cardiomyocytes called Purkinje fibres that
penetrate into the ventricular myocardium.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is important to remember that the cells comprising
the conduction systems are specialized cardiac muscle
cells, NOT nerves.

RESTING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL
The electrical potential across a plasma membrane is determined by two main factors:
• The distribution of ions across the membrane.
• The selective permeability of the cell membrane.
In cardiomyocytes, Kþ (potassium) ions are the major determinant of resting membrane potential because
large numbers of Kþ channels are open constitutively.

Fig. 3.1 Cardiac conduction pathway. The action potential is
initiated in the sinoatrial (SA) node and spreads throughout both
atria. It travels through the atrioventricular (AV) node, where it
is delayed, and then to the bundle of His. From here it travels
down the left and right bundle branches and into Purkinje fibres.
The action potential is then spread throughout the ventricles.

These ‘leak’ Kþ channels mean that permeability to Kþ is
high and there is a constant efflux of Kþ, referred to as
the ‘outward background current’. The resting membrane is only slightly permeable to Naþ (sodium),
one-fortieth that of Kþ, and because both the electrical
and chemical gradients favour inward movement of
Naþ ions, there is a very small inward Naþ current,
which is often referred to as the ‘inward background current’. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations
of these ions (Fig. 3.2) are maintained by the activity of
the Naþ/KþATPase on the sarcolemmal membrane.
A fixed negative charge is present inside cells due to the
presence of intracellular proteins. This negative charge
attracts Kþ ions into the cell down an electrical gradient
while Kþ is simultaneously driven out of the cell down
its concentration gradient. If the membrane was exclusively permeable to Kþ, the resting membrane potential
at equilibrium could be predicted by the Nernst equation:
 
  
EK ¼ 65 log Kþ out = Kþ in
This would result in a membrane potential of 90 mV,
the equilibrium potential of Kþ. In reality, because of the
presence of the background inward Naþ current through
slow Naþ channels, the true resting membrane potential
in cardiomyocytes is approximately 80 mV. This is not
the case in the nodal cells where it is approximately
 60 mV (explained below).

CARDIAC ACTION POTENTIAL
An action potential is a transient depolarization of the
cell membrane. Action potentials are initiated when
the membrane is depolarized (i.e. becomes less negative)

to a threshold potential, which can occur spontaneously
(in nodal cells) but is usually stimulated by transmission
from adjacent myocytes through gap junctions.

Fast cell action potential
Action potentials in fast depolarizing cells (Fig. 3.3)
occur in five phases (0–4, described below) and are initiated by an action potential in an adjacent cell. The
shape of the action potential is not uniform throughout
work myocytes in different regions of the heart, and the
speed at which action potentials are conducted also
varies (Fig. 3.5).
• Phase 0: rapid depolarization (upstroke). When the
membrane is depolarized to threshold potential
(between 60 and 65 mV), fast voltage-gated
Naþ channels open, allowing rapid influx of Naþ
down its electrochemical gradient, which drives
the membrane potential towards the Naþ equilibrium potential (þ70 mV) and causes depolarization.
The rapidity of this depolarization is due to a positive feedback effect in which depolarization causes
opening of additional voltage-gated Naþ channels,
causing further depolarization.
• Phase 1: initial repolarization. As the membrane potential reaches around þ20 mV, the voltage-gated Naþ
channels become inactivated (self-inactivation), terminating the rapid inward Naþ current. As this occurs, the
persistent outward background Kþ current causes a
slight repolarization. Phase 1 is most prominent in
the Purkinje fibres.

conductance throughout the action potential are shown below
(ARP, absolute refractory period; RRP, relative refractory

• Phase 2: plateau. The plateau phase is mediated by
opening of L-type Ca2þ channels. These L-type Ca2þ
channels are voltage-gated channels that are activated slowly after the membrane potential exceeds
approximately 35 mV (during phase 0). The slow
inward Ca2þ current is balanced by Kþ efflux and
thus membrane potential remains relatively steady.
Towards the end of phase 2, as the Ca2þ channels
close, the steady potential is maintained by an inward current brought about by the action of the
Naþ/Ca2þ (3:1 ratio) exchanger. The presence of this
plateau phase is a key difference between the cardiac
action potential and the neuronal action potential. It
prevents rapid repolarization, and the sustained
Ca2þ current is critical in allowing contraction to occur. While neuronal action potentials are less than
10 ms in duration, the plateau prolongs the cardiac
action potential to 150–300 ms, the importance of
which is explained below.
• Phase 3: repolarization. Following termination of
the inward Ca2þ current, additional Kþ channels
open (including voltage-gated and ATP-gated), increasing Kþ efflux. This brings about repolarization
of the membrane to its resting potential. A delay or

defect in the opening of these Kþ channels caused by
a genetic defect delays repolarization and manifests
as a long Q-T syndrome.
• Phase 4: resting potential.
When repolarization is complete the membrane
potential is restored to its resting value and the cycle
repeats when stimulated by an adjacent cell.

Slow cell action potential (Fig. 3.4)
The cells of the SA node and AV node (nodal cells) do
not have a stable resting membrane potential. The relatively lower density of constitutively open leak Kþ channels on these cells compared to fast depolarizing cells/
work myocytes causes the initial resting potential in
these cells to be approximately 60 mV. This membrane potential decays (depolarizes) slowly until it
reaches its threshold potential at around 40 mV,
when an action potential is triggered spontaneously.
This decaying potential is a result of a gradual, spontaneous reduction in the Kþ permeability, reducing Kþ
efflux, along with a gradual increase in Naþ and Ca2þ
influx through slow channels. This unstable pacemaker
potential (phase 4) means that if an action potential is

not stimulated by depolarization transmitted from an
adjacent cell, an action potential occurs spontaneously.
Nodal cells do not express functional fast voltagegated Naþ channels and the upstroke of the action
potential (phase 0) is produced by a slow inward
Ca2þ current through L-type Ca2þ channels. As a result,
the upstroke of the nodal action potential is much
slower than that of the fast cells. The relatively higher
threshold potential in these nodal cells is due to the fact
that the L-type Ca2þ channels are activated at higher
voltage than the fast voltage-gated Naþ channels. After
the upstroke, Kþ channels open and the resulting outward Kþ current brings about repolarization (phase 3).
The action potential in nodal cells lacks the plateau phase
exhibited by fast depolarizing cells.

Refractory period
During an action potential, cardiac cells are refractory to
excitation, i.e. another action potential cannot be generated. There are two different refractory periods:
• Absolute refractory period, during which another
action potential cannot be elicited, no matter how
great the stimulus.
• Relative refractory period, during which an action potential can be initiated only if the stimulus is strong.
The two are shown in Figs 3.3 and 3.4. The absolute
refractory period begins at the onset of phase 0 and lasts
until the membrane has repolarized to approximately
50 mV. This refractory period is crucial as it prevents
a new action potential being initiated during the previous one, allowing adequate time for ventricular filling

30

before the next contraction. The absolute refractory
period in ventricular myocytes is approximately 250 ms
in a healthy heart, thus the maximum rate the heart
can beat in a coordinated manner is 240 bpm.
When the potential falls below 50 mV, some of
the fast voltage-gated Naþ channels are reset and primed
to be activated again; however, only a small number are
primed so a large stimulus is required. This is the socalled relative refractory period, which, in work myocytes, lasts until resting membrane potential is reached
and can persist into phase 4 in nodal cells.

Control of heart rate
Nodal cells, as well as some cells in the His–Purkinje
system, have the ability to depolarize spontaneously.
In nodal cells, the rate at which spontaneous depolarization occurs depends on the slope of the pacemaker
potential, i.e. how long it takes to reach the threshold
potential after repolarization. Both the SA and AV nodes
are innervated by sympathetic and parasympathetic
fibres which each exert opposing chronotropic stimuli
(effects on heart rate) by altering the slope of the pacemaker potential. In a denervated heart, the SA node
spontaneously depolarizes at a rate of approximately
100 bpm and the AV node at between 30 and 50 bpm.
Thus under normal circumstances the SA node is the
dominant pacemaker and determines heart rate. If the
SA node ceases to function, or conduction from the SA
node to the AV node is interrupted, the AV node becomes
the dominant pacemaker.
Sympathetic fibres release noradrenaline/norepinephrine, which acts on b1 receptors, increasing the

Fig. 3.6 Autonomic influences on the nodal action potential. (A) Sympathetic stimulation increases the slope of the pacemaker

permeability of the nodal cell plasma membrane to Naþ
and Ca2þ, increasing the slope of the pacemaker potential. This causes an increased firing rate of the SA node,
increasing heart rate, and decreases the conduction
delay at the AV node.
Parasympathetic fibres release acetylcholine, which
acts on muscarinic M2 receptors, increasing the permeability to Kþ and decreasing the Naþ and Ca2þ permeability. This decreases the slope of the pacemaker potential,
decreasing heart rate. In addition, increased parasympathetic activity causes a slight hyperpolarization at the
end of each action potential, increasing the amount of depolarization that must occur before threshold potential is
reached, further decreasing heart rate.
Under resting conditions, parasympathetic influences
on the SA node via the vagus nerve predominate, resulting in a resting heart rate of approximately 70 bpm. The
effects of autonomic innervation on the action potential
in the SA and AV nodes are shown in Fig. 3.6.
HINTS AND TIPS
Pacemaker rate is also affected by temperature. This
is why heart rate increases when a person has a fever.
It is estimated that heart rate increases by 10 bpm for
every degree C increase in temperature.

cytosolic Ca2þ concentration ([Ca2þ]). During the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential (phase 2),
Ca2þ enters the cytosol through the L-type Ca2þ channels. This influx of extracellular Ca2þ then stimulates
further release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR),
a process termed Ca2þ induced Ca2þ release. Approximately 20% of the increase in cytosolic Ca2þ is thought
to be from the extracellular space with the remainder
from the SR. Once in the cytosol, Ca2þ ions bind troponin C, altering the position of tropomyosin and exposing the myosin heads so they can bind actin filaments,
allowing contraction to take place. The greater the increase in cytosolic [Ca2þ], the greater the number of

actin–myosin cross-bridges that are formed, and the
greater the strength of contraction. Therefore, the
amount of Ca2þ entry and thus the degree to which cytosolic [Ca2þ] increases determines the contractility of
the myocyte. Contractility is defined as the force generated by cardiac muscle for a given fibre length. Factors
that influence contractility are termed inotropic factors
and can have a positive or negative effect. These are
described in more detail in Chapter 4.
Following myocyte contraction, it is crucial that there
is an efficient system for rapidly reducing the cytosolic
[Ca2þ] to bring about relaxation and allow ventricular
filling during diastole (Fig. 3.8). The Ca2þATPase on
the SR is activated by increased cytosolic [Ca2þ] and
pumps approximately 80–90% of the Ca2þ back into
the SR. The remainder is removed from the cell by the
Naþ/Ca2þ exchanger on the plasma membrane, which
utilizes the Naþ gradient created by the activity of the
Naþ/KþATPase to remove Ca2þ from the cell. Factors
affecting this process can also exert inotropic effects.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY
The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a recording of the electrical activity of the heart, obtained by measuring the
changes in electrical potential difference across the body
surface. It is usually the first investigation used to diagnose
arrhythmias and the underlying cause of chest pain.
As a wave of depolarization spreads through the myocardium there will be, at any one moment, areas of myocardium that have been excited and areas that have not
yet been excited. As a result, there is a difference in

32

potential between them: one area is negatively charged
(excited), the other is positive (not excited), with respect
to the charge in the extracellular space. These areas can
be thought of as two electrical poles that comprise the
cardiac dipole. This dipole depends on both the size
of the charge (which depends on the amount of muscle
excited) and the direction the wave of depolarization is
travelling in. In the absence of electrical activity in the
heart and skeletal muscle, the electrical potential across
the surface of the body is uniformly positive. The cardiac
dipole (electrical activity in the heart) alters the electrical
potential across the body, and by placing electrodes in
certain positions, the cardiac dipole and other changes
in potential can be measured in different directions. This
provides the basis for electrocardiography.
Fig. 3.9 depicts how a wave of depolarization affects
the potential difference between two electrodes and thus
how this is translated onto an ECG trace. Remember that
as the dipole has both charge (amplitude) and direction,
the shape of the ECG varies depending upon the position
of the recording electrode. As current travels towards the
positive electrode, there is an upward deflection of the
ECG waveform. As the current travels towards the negative electrode (or away from the positive one) there is
a downward deflection of the ECG waveform. If current
is moving perpendicular to the recording pair of electrodes there is a biphasic waveform.
Conventionally, the ECG is recorded using 12 leads
(Fig. 3.10). Note that the term ‘lead’ is used to denote
the direction in which the potential is measured and
not a physical electrode – only nine electrodes are used
to produce the 12 leads. The additional three lead traces
are produced using the ‘standard leads’, which show the
potential difference between specific pairs of electrodes.
These leads allow us to view the direction and magnitude of electrical activity in both the frontal and transverse planes, and in any direction in these planes.

Anterior chest lead placement is shown in the frontal and transverse planes. V1 is placed in the fourth intercostal space on the

anterior axillary line, and V6 in the mid-axillary line. V3 is placed between V2 and V4 (RV, right ventricle; LV, left ventricle).

Bipolar limb leads
The potential difference shown by these leads is conventionally measured from:

ECG traces from each of the limb leads and chest
leads are shown in Figs 3.11 and 3.12 respectively.

• Lead I: right arm (aVR) to left arm (aVL); left arm
positive.
• Lead II: right arm (aVR) to left leg (aVF); left leg positive.
• Lead III: left arm (aVL) to left leg (aVF); left leg positive.

Normal electrocardiogram

These bipolar limb leads view the heart in the frontal
plane. These three leads make up Einthoven’s triangle
around the heart.

• P wave: due to atrial depolarization.
• PR interval: from the onset of the P wave to the
onset of the QRS complex (approximately 120–
200 ms). This represents the time taken for depolarization to propagate through the atria and the
impulse to conduct through the AV node to the
bundle of His.
• QRS complex: due to ventricular depolarization and
is usually less than 100 ms in duration. The definitions of each wave within the QRS complex are
depicted in Fig. 3.14.
• ST segment: coincides with the plateau phase of the
ventricular action potential and ventricular contraction. It is usually isoelectric (flat) as the ventricles are
depolarized throughout.
• T wave: due to ventricular repolarization.

Unipolar limb leads
Unipolar leads measure any positive potential difference
directed towards their solitary positive electrode from
an estimate of zero potential. They include aVL, aVR
and aVF. They also view the heart in the frontal plane.

Chest leads
Six chest electrodes labelled V1 to V6 measure any potential changes in the transverse plane, and they are arranged around the left side of the chest. These are also
unipolar leads.

The classic ECG trace is shown in Fig. 3.13. The elements

34

Electrocardiography
HINTS AND TIPS
ECG parameters simply need to be committed to
memory! They are as follows:
• PR interval: approximately 120–200 ms.
• QRS duration: approximately 80 ms (but not usually
more than 100 ms).
• QT duration: approximately 400 ms.

Why the T wave is in the same
direction as the R wave
After travelling through the atria, the wave of depolarization travels from the AV node down to the apex of the
heart. This is the cause of the R wave in the ECG. If
repolarization of the heart then took place in the same direction the T wave would be in the opposite direction to
the R wave. However, repolarization actually takes place
from the apex of the heart towards the top of the septum
due to differences in the duration of action potentials
(shorter at the apex). Thus, the wave of repolarization occurs in the opposite direction to the wave of depolarization,
and so the T wave is upright. This is a double negative: repolarization is negative depolarization and it occurs in a
negative direction, so it appears as if it is positive.

Cardiac axis
The average direction of the wave of depolarization is the
electrical axis of the heart, usually referred to as the cardiac axis (Fig. 3.15). This usually lies closest to lead II
but is within normal limits if between 30 and þ90 .
Any deviation from this range is referred to as right or left
axis deviation. Right axis deviation can be caused by right
ventricular hypertrophy and left axis deviation by left

LAD

ventricular hypertrophy. When interpreting an ECG, it
must be established whether this is normal or not.
When the depolarization wave in the ventricles is
moving towards a lead, then the R wave will be larger
than the S wave in that lead. When the ventricular depolarization wave is moving away from a lead, then the
S wave will be larger than the R wave in that lead. If
the S wave and R wave are equal then the depolarization
is moving (on average) at right angles to that lead. The
simplest way to assess the cardiac axis is to look at leads I
and II. If the overall deflection in leads I and II is positive, then the axis is normal. If lead I is positive and II
negative, it is left axis deviation. If lead I is negative
and II is positive, then it is right axis deviation. If both
are negative, check you have the leads on correctly!
HINTS AND TIPS
Do not get confused between the orientation of the
heart and the cardiac axis. The cardiac axis is an
electrical entity and is the angle at which the maximum
amplitude ECG R wave is generated.

Anterior chest leads (V1–V6)
The anterior chest leads look at the chest in the horizontal (or transverse) plane. The wave of depolarization in
the ventricles starts in the septum and then spreads into
the left and right ventricles (Fig. 3.12). Because the left
ventricle is usually larger than the right, the average depolarization heads towards the left ventricle. This
means that V1 and V2 will have a predominant S wave
(i.e. negative deflection) and a small R wave, while V5
and V6 will have a predominant R wave (i.e. positive deflection) with a small S wave. The interventricular septum lies where there are equal positive and negative
deflections (i.e. R and S waves), and is usually at V3
or V4. This steady increase in the size of the R wave is
sometimes termed R wave progression. If this is normal
then there is said to be ‘good’ R wave progression.

Assessment of rate
The paper speed is usually 25 mm/s, which means that in
1 second the paper has moved by five large squares (i.e.
0.2 s per large square). Every small square represents
0.04 s. The rate can be measured in a variety of ways:
• Divide 300 by the number of large squares between
QRS complexes. That will give you a rate in beats per
minute (bpm).
• If the interval between R waves is 1 large square the
rate is 300 bpm; 2 large squares, 150 bpm; 3 large
squares, 100 bpm; 4 large squares, 75 bpm; 5 large
squares, 60 bpm; 6 large squares, 50 bpm (i.e. divide
300 by the number of large squares between beats).

35

Cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia

Assessment of rhythm
This is usually achieved by looking at lead II, but looking at V1 is also helpful, as P waves cannot always be
seen in lead II. Note whether the distance between the
R wave peaks is consistent. If it is not, try and establish
whether it is regularly irregular or irregularly irregular.
HINTS AND TIPS
When reading an ECG it is helpful to have a systematic
approach to ensure no abnormalities are missed.
Below is an example of such an approach but with
experience you may develop your own system:
• Name, age, and sex of the patient.
• Date and time the electrocardiogram was taken.
• Rate.
• Rhythm.
• Axis.
Next, note any abnormalities and in which lead they
occur:
• P waves: width and height.
• PR interval.
• QRS complex: width and height.
• QT interval.
• ST segment: elevated? depressed?
• T waves: negative/positive and height.

The ECG trace can also be affected by disturbances in
plasma ion concentrations:
• Hyperkalaemia: tall T, wide QRS, absent P.
• Hypokalaemia: prolonged QT interval, small T,
U wave.
• Hypercalcaemia: short QT interval.
• Hypocalcaemia: long QT interval.

ARRHYTHMIA

Definitions and classification
An arrhythmia is any deviation from the heart’s normal
sinus rhythm. Arrhythmias may go unnoticed by the patient but can cause palpitation (an awareness of one’s
own heart beat) or even sudden death. ECG traces
of all the arrhythmias described below are shown in
Figs 3.16–3.18. Arrhythmias can be classified in a
number of ways, including:
• Tachyarrhythmia (>100 bpm) OR bradyarrhythmia
(<60 bpm).

36

First degree block (constantly prolonged PR interval)
0.36 s

Each QRS complex has a preceding P wave, but the PR
interval is 0.36 s (normal is 0.12−0.21 s), which is prolonged
Second degree block (Mobitz type II) (PR interval constant,
but some P waves have no QRS)

There is a constant, normal PR interval, but there are
isolated P waves without following QRS complexes
Second degree block (Mobitz type I, Wenkebach)
(PR interval increases with each beat and then results
in an isolated P wave)
0.26 0.28 0.32 s
0.26 0.28 0.32 s

The PR interval progressively increases and then there is
one isolated P wave without a following QRS complex;
the PR interval then goes back to normal and starts to
increase again
Third degree (complete) block (QRS
complexes are independent of P waves)

There are 90 P waves/min. There is no relationship
between P waves and QRS complexes

Altered sinus rhythms
Sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia are produced
by autonomic nervous activity and manifest as changes
in rate with a regular rhythm and conduction.
Sinus tachycardia (>100 bpm in adults) usually results from:
• Exercise.
• Anxiety or excitement.
• Fever.
Sinus bradycardia (<60 bpm) commonly occurs in:
• Athletes.
• Raised intracranial pressure.
• Hypothermia

Mechanisms of arrhythmia
Broadly speaking, arrhythmias can arise as a result of
any or a combination of the following:
• Interruption of the normal conduction pathway.
• Abnormal impulse generation.
• The presence of an abnormal conduction pathway.
Arrhythmias can be caused by numerous factors.
These can be cardiac, such as ischaemia, structural

3

damage, aberrant conduction pathways or mitral valve
disease, or non-cardiac, such as electrolyte imbalance,
drugs or caffeine.

Heart block (Fig. 3.16)
This is an interruption of the normal conduction
through the atrioventricular conduction tissue. It may
be classified as first-, second- or third-degree block:
• In first-degree heart block, all atrial impulses reach
the ventricle, but conduction through the atrioventricular tissue takes longer than normal (P–R interval
on an electrocardiogram is >0.2 s).
• In second-degree heart block, some atrial impulses
fail to reach the ventricles while others succeed
(not all P waves are followed by QRS complexes).
Second-degree block can be divided into Mobitz
type I and Mobitz type II. In type I (Wenckebach),
the degree of block increases over a few beats (P–R
interval increases over three or four beats, followed by an isolated P wave). This is analogous
to a ‘lazy’ AV node which can still function.
Type II is characterized by an unexpected nonconducted atrial impulse. Thus, the P–R and R–R
intervals between conducted beats are constant.
This is analogous to a fracture in the His–Purkinje
system which is about to become completely
severed. This frequently progresses to complete
heart block and is associated with sudden cardiac
death.
• In third-degree heart block, the atria and ventricles
beat independently of each other. The ventricular
rate is usually about 20–40 bpm (P waves and
QRS complexes have no fixed relationship).

Bundle branch block (Fig. 3.17)
When conduction is blocked in one of the bundle
branches of the interventricular septum, the affected
areas of myocardium will be stimulated later by conduction from unaffected areas of myocardium. This leads to
widening and disruption of the QRS complexes
(>0.12 s). Looking at leads V1 and V6 in right bundle
branch block there is:
• A second R wave (R0 ) in V1 and a deeper, wider S
wave in V6.
• The last part of the QRS in lead V1 is positive.
This is because of the delayed right ventricular
depolarization.
In left bundle branch block:
• There is a Q wave with an S wave in V1.
• There is a notched R wave in V6.
• The last part of the QRS in lead V1 is negative.
This reflects the delayed depolarization of the left
ventricle.

37

Cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia

Supraventricular extrasystole
Three normal beats are followed by an extra early QRS
complex (extrasystole). There is no preceding P wave
and no P wave is seen at the expected interval time.
There is a compensatory pause and then the next
P wave is late

Atrial tachycardia
There are three normal beats and then an atrial
tachycardia of 150/min. P waves are superimposed
on top of T waves. Shape of the QRS complexes is the
same as of the normal beats

Atrial flutter (4:1 block)
There are numerous P waves (almost 300/min), producing a
‘saw-tooth’ appearance. There are four P waves for
every QRS complex, but the QRS complex rate is normal

Atrial fibrillation
lead II
There are no P waves and the baseline is very irregular.
The QRS complex rate is irregular, but of normal shape.
There are flutter waves in V1.

Ventricular extrasystole (extraventricular beat)
There are five sinus beats and then a ventricular
extrasystole occurs, which is a wide QRS complex with
an abnormal T wave.

Ventricular tachycardia
The rate of QRS complexes is almost 300/min. The QRS
complexes are wide and abnormal in shape. There are
no preceding P waves. This can often lead to ventricular
fibrillation.

Ventricular fibrillation
This occurs after the five QRS complexes. There are no QRS
complexes, the baseline wanders, and there is no regularity to
the ECG. The ventricular wall is fibrillating and there is no
organized contraction. Immediate intervention is necessary
as death is imminent.

Fig. 3.18 Common atrial and ventricular arrhythmias.

38

Arrhythmia
HINTS AND TIPS
To determine the type of bundle branch block, look at
leads V1 and V6 and think of WiLLiaM MaRRoW. In
LBBB, there is a W pattern in lead V1, and an M pattern
in V6 (WiLLiaM). In RBBB, there is an M pattern in lead
V1, and a W pattern in V6 (MaRRoW).

Extrasystole (ectopic beats)
Extrasystole occurs when an abnormal beat is generated in an area of myocardium before the next sinus
beat. The impulse that is generated goes on to contract the ventricle. Atrial extrasystole (narrow and
irregular) or ventricular extrasystole (broad and irregular) may occur, depending upon where the impulse
originates. The contraction initiated by the extrasystole is usually a weak one. This is because the reuptake
of Ca2þ into the sarcoplasmic reticulum is not complete when contraction is stimulated so does not
allow the normal degree of increase in cytosolic
[Ca2þ]. Usually, there is a gap before the next normal
sinus beat; it is usually this gap, or the subsequent beat
(often strong due to blood pooling in the ventricle
that was not ejected by the weak extrasystolic contraction and prolonged ventricular filling), that is noticed
by the patient.

Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome
The Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome is a good example of supraventricular arrhythmia caused by the presence of an accessory (extra) conduction pathway (the
bundle of Kent) between the atria and ventricles. This
additional pathway can cause arrhythmia by causing
pre-excitation and/or a phenomenon called re-entry.
The additional pathway conducts faster than the AV
node and certain areas of ventricular myocardium will
be excited before others; this is pre-excitation. Re-entry
occurs when depolarization of ventricular myocardium
is propagated retrogradely via the additional pathway
and re-excites the atria.

Supraventricular tachycardias
Atrial tachycardia and atrial flutter are caused by an abnormal focus in the atrium or an abnormal conduction
pathway causing re-entry that results in atrial contraction at a rapid rate.
In atrial flutter the rate is usually around 300 bpm
but not all atrial impulses are conducted to the ventricle.
Often, the ratio of atrial to ventricular beats is 2:1 or 3:1.

3

These are usually characterized by a regular rhythm
at a rate between 140 and 220 bpm, with narrow QRS
complexes.

Atrial fibrillation
Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common arrhythmia and a
significant cause of morbidity, particularly in elderly
people, occurring in around 10% of those over 75. In
AF, electrical activity in the atria is chaotic and depolarization occurs at a rate of 300–600 bpm. This does not
produce effective atrial contraction, merely a rippling effect in the muscle (fibrillation). Ventricular activity is
also affected because impulses are sporadically conducted through the AV node allowing variable time
for ventricular filling between beats, producing a characteristic ‘irregularly irregular’ pulse in rate and volume.
AF can be persistent, permanent or paroxysmal.
This chaotic activity is due to:
• The presence of numerous ectopic foci for impulse
generation.
• The presence of numerous re-entry circuits that become repeatedly excited within the atria.
It is commonly caused by mitral valve disease, ischaemic heart disease, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension and
excessive alcohol consumption. The lack of effective
atrial contraction and resulting stasis of blood predisposes to the development of a thrombus (blood clot)
within the left atrium, which can throw off emboli that
can pass to the brain causing ischaemic stroke, or to other
visceral organs causing ischaemia or infarction. AF is the
most important cause of stroke in elderly patients and
must not be ignored. Some patients with AF will suffer
from palpitation or may experience dizziness or syncope
(fainting).
There are two approaches to treating atrial fibrillation and there is ongoing debate as to which is superior.
These are:
• Rate control: aims to reduce the ventricular rate.
Drugs used to control the rate include Ca2þ channel
blockers (e.g. verapamil), beta-blockers and digoxin.
• Rhythm control: aims to restore sinus rhythm. This
can be achieved electrically by DC cardioversion or
pharmacologically with drugs such as flecainide
(Naþ channel blocker) or amiodarone.
Currently it appears that if patients are asymptomatic
then rate control is better than rhythm control. If sinus
rhythm cannot be restored, people with chronic AF
should be considered for anticoagulation with warfarin
to reduce the risk of embolic events such as stroke. The
CHADS2 score predicts the risk of stroke and thus is useful when deciding whether or not to anticoagulate these
patients (Fig. 3.19).

It applies to patients in persistent and paroxysmal AF (TIA,

Ventricular arrhythmias
Ventricular tachycardia
Ventricular tachycardia occurs when impulses originate
from an ectopic focus or a re-entry circuit within the ventricles. It is characterized by broad QRS complexes (i.e.
duration >100 ms) on an ECG at a rate of >120 bpm.

Cardiac arrest into a ‘shockable’ rhythm is usually
due to a cardiac cause. Defibrillation attempts to stop
the abnormal electrical activity in the hope that the
SA node will regain control.
Cardiac arrest into a ‘non-shockable’ rhythm is usually from a non-cardiac cause. These are divided into
four ’H’s and four ’T’s:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hypovolaemia.
Hypothermia.
Hypotension.
Hypo/hyperkalaemia and metabolic disturbances.
Tension pneumothorax.
Tamponade (pericardial).
Thromboembolic.
Toxic and therapeutic.
Cardiac arrests occur regularly in the hospital setting,
although in a number of situations a ‘Do Not attempt
Resuscitation’ or ‘DNR’ order is put in place. These are
written by senior members of staff when it is thought that
death is expected, resuscitation under the circumstances
would be futile, or the patient’s quality of life
subsequently would be very poor. These are obviously
very difficult decisions to make, and a sound knowledge
of ethical principles and medical law is essential.

Ventricular fibrillation
An irregular, uncoordinated, rippling contraction of the
ventricles. There is no effective cardiac output, leading
to rapid loss of consciousness, as perfusion of the brain
is interrupted. Death results unless effective treatment
is initiated immediately. This often occurs secondary
to myocardial infarction and is thought to be the underlying arrhythmia in the majority of cases of sudden
cardiac death.

Anti-arrhythmic drugs
The aims of drug treatment include:
• To decrease myocyte excitability.
• To increase the refractory period.
• To slow conduction.
The Vaughan Williams classification system is used
for anti-arrhythmic drugs and is based on their actions.

Class I: sodium channel blockers
Cardiac arrest
Cardiac arrest occurs when there is an absence of cardiac
output. Basic life support should be commenced immediately while the cardiac arrest team is called, and a cardiac monitor attached to the patient. There are two main
types of cardiac arrest: ‘shockable’ and ‘non-shockable’,
referring to whether or not they respond to defibrillation.
‘Shockable’ rhythms include:
• Ventricular fibrillation.
• Ventricular tachycardia.
‘Non-shockable’ rhythms include:
• Pulseless electrical activity: the electrical activity of the
heart is compatible with an output but there is no pulse.
• Asystole: an absence of cardiac electrical activity.
Once the type of cardiac arrest has been determined a
strict algorithm is followed, as outlined in Fig. 3.20.

40

These drugs can be subdivided into class IA (e.g. quinidine,
procainamide), class IB (e.g. lidocaine, tocainide) and class
IC (e.g. flecainide). They all act by blocking fast voltagegated Naþ channels and are said to have a membrane
stabilizing effect such that they increase the threshold
for depolarization and slow the upstroke of the action potential. They also prolong the absolute refractory period.

Class II: beta-blockers
Class II drugs (e.g. propranolol and atenolol) block
the increase in pacemaker activity and increase the
speed of conduction that is produced by sympathetic
stimulation of b adrenoceptors.
Beta-blockers may be used for ectopic beats, atrial
fibrillation and atrial tachycardia. They are indicated
when circulating catecholamines are too high (e.g. after
a myocardial infarction and in thyrotoxicosis).

HINTS AND TIPS
Great care should be taken when prescribing betablockers to patients with asthma because blockade of
b2 receptors in the bronchi brings about
bronchoconstriction.

Class III: potassium channel blockers
Class III drugs (e.g. amiodarone) block Kþ channels, slowing repolarization (phase 3), leading to a prolonged action
potential and refractory period. Side-effects of amiodarone
are important, common, and affect multiple organs. These
include interstitial lung disease, hypo- or hyperthyroidism
and deranged liver function to name a few.

41

Cardiac electrophysiology and arrhythmia

Class IV: calcium channel blockers
2þ

Class IV drugs (e.g. verapamil) block L-type Ca channels, thereby decreasing the gradient of the pacemaker
potential, slowing the rate of depolarization in the
SA node and prolonging the conduction delay in the
AV node. They also have negative inotropic effects by
limiting the influx of Ca2þ during the plateau phase.

Other drugs not in this classification
• Digoxin: has a central effect, stimulating the vagus
nerve and increasing parasympathetic stimulation,
thus slowing the heart rate. It simultaneously exerts
its positive inotropic effect by inhibition of the Naþ/
KþATPase.
• Adenosine: causes hyperpolarization at the AV node
by increasing Kþ permeability. This causes a transient complete heart block at the AV node. It can
be used diagnostically to unmask surpaventricular
arrhythmias or to terminate them.

Drugs used to treat bradyarrythmias
Drugs that can be used in the treatment of bradyarrhythmias include:
• Anticholinergics (e.g. atropine): antagonize the
parasympathetic effects on the SA node and AV
node, increasing heart rate.
• Sympathomimetics (e.g. isoprenaline): stimulate
the b1 receptors in the SA node and AV node, increasing heart rate.
These drugs are useful in the acute setting but are
of limited benefit long term. Atropine causes side-effects
including dry mouth and constipation, and isoprenaline must be given intravenously, making it impractical.

Other treatments for arrhythmias
Carotid sinus massage
Massaging the carotid sinuses in the neck causes a
baroreceptor-mediated increase in parasympathetic activity (explained in Ch. 6) that slows the firing rate of the SA
node and prolongs delay at the AV node. This approach
can terminate some supraventricular tachycardias.

Direct current (DC) shock therapy
Cardioversion is performed to return the heart to sinus
rhythm. This can be achieved using an electrical current
(DC cardioversion) or pharmacologically. Defibrillation,

42

as the name suggests, is the use of an electric current to
terminate ventricular fibrillation.
Cardioversion can be used in a number of arrhythmias including AF, atrial flutter and fast ventricular
tachycardia to restore normal sinus rhythm. In DC
cardioversion, the shock must be synchronized with
the R wave on the ECG. This ensures that the shock
is not delivered during the relative refractory period,
and thus alleviates the risk of inducing ventricular
fibrillation.
Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) are available and can be implanted into patients. These ICD devices detect ventricular arrhythmias and act either by
delivering a small shock to return the heart to sinus
rhythm or by overdrive pacing, whereby the ventricle
is paced rapidly out of the arrhythmia and then slowed
back down to a normal rate.

Radiofrequency ablation
In this procedure, a catheter is passed up into the heart
via the femoral vein, and radiofrequency energy is
used to produce a lesion in the myocardium. It can
be used to ‘ablate’ focuses of ectopic activity or to
interrupt aberrant conduction pathways. It is used
primarily in the treatment of supraventricular arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation. Many of the ectopic foci that underlie AF in structurally normal
hearts originate in the roots of the pulmonary veins.
By ablating the myocardium between the pulmonary
veins and the atria, conduction between the two is
interrupted. This technique, called pulmonary vein
isolation, can abolish AF in many cases, and its use
is on the increase.

Pacemaker
Pacemaker implantation is the principal treatment
for bradycardia and allows the heart rate to be controlled. Pacemakers are used in sick sinus syndrome
where there is disease of the sinus node (ischaemia,
infarction or degeneration) leading to pauses in sinus
node function and bradycardia. They are also used
for complete heart block and Mobitz type II block
(as this frequently progresses to complete heart
block). The most widely used pacemakers are dual
chamber pacemakers, which have an electrode in
the right atrium and the right ventricle. This allows
independent control of the atria and the ventricles,
which can be manipulated to optimize cardiac
function.

The cardiac cycle and control
of cardiac output

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe the stages of the ventricular cycle and the pressure/volume changes that take place.
• Describe the stages of the atrial cycle and the corresponding changes in the jugular venous pressure.
• Describe the normal and added heart sounds.
• Understand what a murmur is and why they occur.
• Describe the common causes, haemodynamic changes, symptoms and signs of common valvular
abnormalities.
• Understand the principles and common indications for echocardiography.
• Understand the definition and significance of preload, afterload and contractility.
• Understand the physiological and pharmacological factors that affect contractility.
• Describe Starling’s law of the heart and its implications.

THE CARDIAC CYCLE
The cardiac cycle is the sequence of pressure and volume
changes that take place during cardiac activity (Figs 4.1
and 4.2). At a resting heart rate of approximately 70
beats per minute (bpm), the cardiac cycle lasts 0.85 seconds. This is divided into diastole, which lasts 0.6 s and
systole, which lasts 0.25 s. When considering the cardiac
cycle, it is useful to remember that:
• Blood flows down a pressure gradient.
• The state of a valve is dependent on the pressure
gradient across it.

The ventricular cycle
The ventricular cycle consists of four phases. The duration
and order of each of these phases is shown in Fig. 4.2.

1. Ventricular filling (diastole)
The atria and ventricles are all relaxed initially, and there
is passive filling of the atria and ventricles as a result of
central venous pressure and pulmonary venous pressure
(right and left side respectively). The volume increases
until a neutral ventricular volume is reached. Further
filling makes the ventricle distend, causing ventricular
pressure to rise. This passive ventricular filling will stop
when ventricular pressure reaches central venous/
pulmonary venous pressure. Contraction of the atria
further increases the filling of the ventricles. This accounts for only about 15–20% of ventricular filling at
rest. During exercise, however, when heart rate is increased, the atrial contraction becomes more important

as the time for passive ventricular filling is reduced. The
volume of blood in the ventricle at the end of diastole is
termed the end-diastolic volume (EDV).
HINTS AND TIPS
This ‘atrial kick’ is absent in people with atrial fibrillation
due to the ineffective atrial contraction. This has little
effect on cardiac output at rest.

2. Isovolumetric contraction (systole)
Contraction of the ventricles increases ventricular pressure. Ventricular pressure rises above atrial pressure, closing the atrioventricular valves early in systole. This creates
a closed chamber as all valves are closed. As ventricular
contraction proceeds, wall tension increases, causing a
rapid rise in ventricular pressure. The rate of rise in pressure is a measure of cardiac contractility. During this isovolumetric phase, no blood is ejected from the ventricles
because aortic/pulmonary pressure is greater than that in
the ventricles, maintaining the aortic and pulmonary
valves in their closed position.

3. Ejection (systole)
As contraction proceeds, ventricular pressure eventually rises above arterial pressure, opening the arterial
(aortic and pulmonary) valves. This causes rapid ejection of blood from the ventricles and a rapid initial
rise in arterial pressure. The momentum of blood prevents immediate valve closure, even when ventricular
pressure falls below arterial pressure. Eventually, the

arterial valves close, creating a brief rise in arterial pressure called the dicrotic notch. It is important to note
that the ventricle does not empty completely. There
is an end-systolic volume of about 40–50%, which
can be used to increase stroke volume when necessary.
The proportion of end-diastolic volume ejected during
systole is referred to as the ejection fraction, and is usually between 50%–60%.

44

HINTS AND TIPS
Venous return ¼ Right heart input & output ¼
Pulmonary blood flow ¼ Left heart input & output ¼
Systemic blood flow. This is because they are all in
series, and this idea that what goes in must come out
is called the Fick principle.

4

The cardiac cycle

4. Isovolumetric relaxation (diastole)
Again, both sets of valves are closed as the ventricles relax creating an enclosed chamber. When ventricular
pressure falls below atrial pressure, the atrioventricular
valves open and the cycle repeats.

The atrial cycle
The pressure changes in the atria during the cardiac cycle
are different from those in the ventricles. The right
atrium directly communicates with the internal jugular
veins (IJV) and the absence of valves between the two
means that changes in right atrial pressure are reflected
by changes in the jugular venous pressure (JVP). The
JVP waveform is assessed when examining the cardiovascular system and is shown in Fig. 4.3. The JVP
waveform has five components:
• The A wave is caused by atrial contraction. Although
the tricuspid valve is open, this still causes transient
backpressure into the vena cava and IJV.
• The C wave coincides with closure of the tricuspid
valve.
• The X descent occurs after the C wave as the atria
relax, decreasing pressure.
• The V wave occurs during systole as a result of atrial
filling. As atrial pressure rises against a closed valve,
it creates backpressure, giving rise to the V wave.
• The Y descent occurs due to passive ventricular filling
during diastole.

Heart sounds
Normal heart sounds (Fig. 4.4)
• First (S1): produced by closure of the mitral and
tricuspid valves.
• Second (S2): produced by closure of the aortic and
pulmonary valves.

Splitting of the second heart sound (Fig. 4.5)
During inspiration, physiological splitting of the second
heart sound can occur. Inspiration decreases intrathoracic
pressure, increasing venous return and right ventricular
preload. Simultaneously, the lungs expand, decreasing

return to the left atrium and decreasing left ventricular
preload. As a result, right ventricular systole lasts longer
than left ventricular systole and the pulmonary valve
closes after the aortic valve. This difference can be heard
as splitting of S2.

Added heart sounds (Fig. 4.4)
• Third (S3): can be heard in early diastole and is
caused by rapid ventricular filling. A third heart
sound is common in young people and athletes. It
may also be present in people with heart failure.
• Fourth (S4): occurs just before the first heart sound
and is due to forceful atrial contraction against a stiff
ventricle. This is always abnormal and can occur in
the presence of ventricular hypertrophy, which
makes the ventricle less compliant.
Fig. 4.6 brings together the atrial cycle, ventricular
cycle and heart sounds, showing their temporal relation
to each other.

Fig. 4.6 Displayed at the top of the diagram are the pressures in the left atrium, left ventricle and aorta during the cardiac cycle.
Pressure in the left ventricle increases slightly during left atrial contraction (A). The most rapid increase in pressure occurs during
isovolumetric contraction (B). The increase in pressure caused by ventricular contraction closes the mitral valve (a). When left
ventricular pressure just exceeds aortic pressure the aortic valve opens (b) leading to ejection (C). Pressure rises to a peak and then falls,
leading to aortic valve closure (c). Isovolumetric relaxation then occurs (D) and eventually left ventricular pressure is just below left atrial
pressure, leading to the opening of the mitral valve (d). This allows passive filling of the ventricles (E). Below this the normal
electrocardiogram is displayed as it relates to the cardiac cycle. The jugular venous pressure (JVP) (shown below) reflects right atrial
pressure due to the close proximity of the central veins to the right atrium. Finally, the heart sounds are displayed (S1, closure of the
mitral and tricuspid valves ‘lubb’; S2, closure of the aortic and pulmonary valves ‘dupp’).

Valvular heart disease

Murmurs

Mitral regurgitation

Murmurs can be heard with a stethoscope and result
from the presence of turbulent blood flow. Although
most often due to valvular disease, this is not always
the case. A benign (harmless) murmur may be present
in young people or people in high cardiac output states
such as pregnancy or anaemia. Murmurs may also be
present in congenital heart defects such as septal defects
or patent ductus arteriosus. When describing murmurs,
you should consider when in the cardiac cycle it occurs
(systolic or diastolic), the nature of the murmur and
where it is heard loudest.

Mitral regurgitation can result from infective endocarditis, ischaemic damage to the chordae tendinae or
papillary muscles, or ventricular dilatation. The volume
of blood that flows back into the left atrium during
systole causes dilatation of the atrium (often causing
atrial fibrillation) and increases pulmonary venous pressures, which can lead to pulmonary oedema. With time,
the left ventricle also becomes dilated.

If flow is very turbulent, loud murmurs can sometimes
be felt with the hand on the chest wall. This is called a thrill.

HINTS AND TIPS
The volume of a murmur does not indicate the severity
of valvular heart disease!

VALVULAR HEART DISEASE
Valvular disease can manifest as either stenosis or regurgitation, or sometimes both simultaneously. Stenosis is
an obstruction to normal flow through the valve and can
be likened to a narrowing of the valve. Regurgitation is
when the valve fails in its function to prevent backflow
of blood, analogous to a leaky valve. This can also be
described as an incompetent valve or insufficient valve.
Valvular disease can be caused by:
• Direct damage to the valve leaflets (usually the case
in stenosis).
• Damage to the valve ring (the annulus).
• Damage to the supporting structures (papillary muscles, chordae tendinae).
The most commonly affected valves are the aortic and
mitral valves. This is due to the high pressures to which
they are exposed (compared to those in the right side).
The clinical features and findings on examination of
the common valve pathologies are shown in Fig. 4.7.

Mitral stenosis
Mitral stenosis occurs most commonly as a result of
rheumatic heart disease. The stenosis limits passive filling of the left ventricle during diastole, increasing the
contribution of atrial systole. It also causes an increase
in left atrial pressure, causing distension of the atrium
(often causing atrial fibrillation) and increasing pulmonary venous pressure.

Aortic stenosis
Aortic stenosis usually occurs as a result of calcification of
a normal aortic valve or congenitally bicuspid aortic valve
(tends to occur at a younger age). It can also result from
rheumatic heart disease. The stenosed valve increases
the afterload on the left ventricle, increasing the force required to eject blood into the aorta. This causes hypertrophy of the left ventricle. The reduction in cardiac output
can result in breathlessness and inadequate perfusion of
tissues such as the brain (causing syncope). Reduced myocardial perfusion combined with the increased myocardial oxygen demand can also cause angina.

Aortic regurgitation
Aortic regurgitation can result from infective endocarditis, dilatation of the aortic root (e.g. in Marfan’s
syndrome) or rheumatic heart disease. The backflow of
blood into the left ventricle causes ventricular dilatation
and in order to maintain cardiac output, left ventricular
hypertrophy occurs. If onset is acute, these compensatory structural changes cannot take place and the increase in left ventricular pressure causes premature
closure of the mitral valve and prevents diastolic filling.

Echocardiography
Echocardiography is commonly used in the diagnosis
and assessment of valvular heart disease. The procedure
uses an ultrasound probe, which is placed on the anterior chest wall (transthoracic echocardiography, TTE).
Ultrasonic waves generated by the probe are reflected
back at tissue interfaces and picked up by the probe.
Echoes from tissues furthest from the transmitter take
longest to return and different tissues reflect waves differently, allowing an image to be built up. Traditionally,
echocardiography produces a 2D image but 3D imaging
is becoming increasingly available.
Advantages of echocardiography for cardiovascular
investigation include:
• Non-invasive, painless, and harmless.
• Can be used to study the motion of the heart and valves.
• Can be used to measure velocity of blood (using
the Doppler shift phenomenon) and to estimate

Disadvantages include the fact that the ribs and lungs

chest wall, but, when necessary, an oesophageal probe
can be used to perform transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE). Examples of images of TTE and TOE images
are shown in Figs 4.8 and 4.9 respectively.

Rheumatic heart disease
Rheumatic heart disease is a consequence of rheumatic
fever that may have occurred many years previously. The
acute process can leave the valves scarred and deformed,
causing chronic rheumatic heart disease.

Acute rheumatic fever is an inflammatory disease
caused by an autoimmune reaction initiated by infection with group A streptococci, usually in the throat.
It usually affects children aged 5–15 years but is now
rare in the UK because of improved sanitation and
the use of antibiotics to effectively treat streptococcal infections. It affects the heart, skin, joints, and central nervous system. The Duckett Jones criteria for diagnosis
include:
• Carditis involving all three layers (pancarditis).
• Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus dance; rapid, involuntary purposeless movements).
• Polyarthritis affecting the large joints.
• Erythema marginatum (macular rash with erythematous edge).
• Subcutaneous nodules.
Fever, arthralgia and leukocytosis also commonly
occur.
Carditis consists of granulomatous lesions with a
central necrotic area (Aschoff nodule), initially with
an inflammatory infiltrate that is eventually replaced
by fibrous tissue. Commonly, it affects the mitral valve

(65%) or the mitral and aortic valves (25%). In the long
term it can lead to commissural fusion (fusing of valve
leaflets), shortening/thickening of the chordae and cusp
fibrosis – the so-called fish-mouth or button-hole mitral
valve deformity. This can result in stenosis or regurgitation of the mitral or aortic valves.

Infective endocarditis
Infective endocarditis is an infection of the endocardium, usually involving the heart valves. Previously, endocarditis was classified as acute or subacute; now it is

classified according to the causative organism. The incidence is 6–7 per 100 000 in the UK, but it is more common in developing countries.
Infective endocarditis occurs more commonly on
valves that have been previously damaged or are congenitally abnormal. Inflammation of the valve causes
destruction and scarring. Vegetations (consisting of
fibrin, platelets and the infecting organism) usually develop on the valves causing damage and often, valvular
regurgitation. These vegetations can also throw off emboli to other organs such as the kidneys and brain causing ischaemia. Until proven otherwise, any patient with
a fever and a new murmur should be investigated
and potentially treated for endocarditis. The main aim
of treatment is to resolve the infection using intravenous (IV) antibiotics but multiple sets of blood cultures
from multiple sites should be taken before starting antibiotics to increase the chance of identifying the causative
organism. Any acute valvular abnormalities (if severe)
may need to be treated surgically. The common causative
organisms include:
• Streptococcus viridans: subacute; common after dental
procedures, tonsillectomy or bronchoscopy.
• Staphylococcus aureus: acute; common in patients
with indwelling catheters and in IV drug users.
• Enterococcus faecalis: common in patients with pelvic
infections or after having pelvic surgery.
• Coxiella burnetii (Q fever): subacute.
• Staphylococcus epidermidis, Aspergillus, Candida, Brucella, Histoplasma: more common in IV drug users
and in patients with prosthetic heart valves.

Cardiac output (CO) is the amount of blood ejected from
the heart in 1 minute. It is a product of the stroke volume
(SV) and heart rate (HR) (CO ¼ SV  HR). In a normal
adult, it ranges from 4 to 7 L/min at rest but is increased
during exercise (up to 20 L/min) and decreased during
sleep, in line with the body’s metabolic requirements.
Before considering how cardiac output is regulated, it
is important to understand a number of definitions:
• Stroke volume (SV): the volume of blood ejected in
one ventricular contraction.
• Stroke work (SW): the amount of external energy
expended in one ventricular contraction. SW is the
mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) multiplied
by the SV.
• Contractility: the force of contraction for a given
fibre length.
• End-diastolic volume (EDV): the volume of blood in
the ventricle just before contraction.
• End-diastolic pressure (EDP): the pressure of blood
in the ventricle just before contraction.
• End-systolic volume (ESV): the volume of blood left
in the ventricle after contraction.
• Central venous pressure (CVP): the pressure of blood
in the great veins as they enter the right atrium.
• Venous return (VR): the volume of blood returning
to the right heart in 1 minute. In a healthy heart
VR ¼ CO.
• Total peripheral resistance (TPR): the resistance to
the flow of blood in the whole system (MABP/CO).
• Systemic vascular resistance (SVR): the resistance to
blood flow offered by all of the systemic vasculature
(this excludes the pulmonary vasculature). It is
calculated as (MABP  CVP)/CO.
• Ejection fraction: the proportion of EDV that is
ejected during systole.
Stroke volume, and therefore cardiac output, is
influenced by three factors:
• Preload.
• Afterload.
• Contractility.

Preload
Preload is defined as the degree of ventricular myocyte
stretch at the end of diastole and is determined by the
EDV. The greater the EDV, the greater the preload and
vice versa. EDV is influenced by:
• Venous return: influenced by blood volume, venous
tone, gravity, respiration, skeletal muscle contraction (for more detail see Ch. 5)

50

• Heart rate: at high heart rates, the duration of diastole and thus time for passive ventricular filling is
reduced, decreasing EDV.
• Atrial contraction: ineffective atrial contraction, as
occurs in atrial fibrillation, will reduce EDV.
Some people will think of preload in terms of end–
diastolic pressure and others in term of end-diastolic
volume. It is the EDV that determines the fibre length at
the onset of contraction and therefore the strength of
contraction but when ventricular compliance is normal,
end-diastolic pressure is just as accurate. The distinction
is important only when ventricular compliance is
altered.

Afterload
Afterload is defined as the force or stress on myocytes
during systole. Think of it as the force against which
the ventricle has to contract. It is determined by the resistance to outflow from the ventricle. For the left ventricle,
aortic pressure is the main determinant and for the right
ventricle, pulmonary artery pressure is the main determinant. Afterload is also increased by valvular stenosis.

Contractility
As described in Chapter 3, contractility is the force of
contraction for a given fibre length and is determined
by the degree of Ca2þ influx during the plateau phase
(phase 3) of the cardiac action potential. Factors that affect contractility are termed inotropic factors. Examples
of positive and negative inotropes include:

Positive inotropes
• Catecholamines: noradrenaline/norepinephrine released by sympathetic nerves and circulating adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/norepinephrine
bind b1 receptors on cardiac myocytes. The resulting
increase in levels of cAMP opens L-type Ca2þ channels,
increasing Ca2þ entry into the cytosol during the plateau phase of the action potential. Catecholamines
also increase the activity of the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(SR) Ca2þATPase, increasing reuptake of Ca2þ into the
SR and thus increasing the amount available for Ca2þ
induced Ca2þ release during the next action potential.
• Beta-agonists (e.g. dobutamine): by the mechanisms
described above.
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors (e.g. milrinone): these
drugs inhibit the breakdown of cAMP and increase
opening of L-type Ca2þ channels.
• Ca2þ sensitizers (e.g. levosimendan): these drugs increase the sensitivity of the contractile proteins to

4

Control of cardiac output
Ca2þ, increasing the strength of contraction for a
given rise in cytosolic [Ca2þ].
• Cardiac glycosides: digoxin is an inhibitor of the
Naþ/KþATPase and exerts a positive inotropic influence. By inhibiting the Naþ/KþATPase, the [Naþ]
inside the myocyte will increase reducing the gradient for Ca2þ removal by the Naþ/Ca2þ exchanger,
increasing cytosolic [Ca2þ].

• Beta-blockers (e.g. propranolol): inhibit the action
of catecholamines on b1 receptors.
• Ca2þ channel blockers (e.g. verapamil): block the
L-type Ca2þ channels on ventricular myocytes,
reducing Ca2þ influx.
• Hypoxia.

60

Although sympathetic stimulation causes an increase
in contractility, parasympathetic stimulation does
NOT decrease contractility because parasympathetic
innervation to the ventricular myocardium is
sparse.

the initial sarcomere length increases tension, up to the
maximum stretch possible for an individual myocyte.

Starling’s law of the heart
‘The energy released during contraction depends upon
the initial fibre length’ (Fig. 4.10). The greater the heart
is stretched by filling (preload), then the greater the energy released by contraction. This phenomenon is due
to the stretch-dependent sensitivity of myocardial contractile proteins to Ca2þ, which influences the number
of actin–myosin cross-bridges formed, and it is known
as Starling’s law. It is important to distinguish this from
contractility, which is the force of contraction for a given
fibre length and is determined by the degree to which
cytosolic [Ca2þ] is increased.
Although the initial stretch of the ventricular myocardium, the preload, is produced by the EDV, enddiastolic pressure (EDP) is easier to measure, and
the relationship between the two is almost linear
(providing myocardial compliance is normal). In
the right ventricle EDP is closely related to the central
venous pressure (CVP). EDP plotted against SV produces the Starling curve (Fig. 4.11). Excessively high
filling pressures will cause excessive myocyte stretch
and the relationship is no longer valid such that when
a certain EDP is exceeded, any further increase will decrease SV.
In a closed system such as the heart in which the
chambers are arranged in series, what goes in must
come out. This Fick principle has been mentioned previously but is very important to remember. Starling’s
law is the principle that matches right and left

that an increase in EDP (and therefore end-diastolic volume
(EDV) as they have an almost linear relationship) causes an
increased SV. There is, however, a limit at which the curve turns
downwards and the relationship is no longer valid. The
mechanism for this downturn is complex, and it mainly reflects
excessive stretching of the ventricular myocytes. Changes in
contractility are characterized by upward (positively inotropic)
and downward (negatively inotropic) displacement of the
Starling curve.

ventricular stroke volumes and understanding it is central to understanding how cardiac output is controlled.
We will now consider how this balance is maintained in
the following situations assuming constant heart rate
and contractility.

Change in preload

pressure (mmHg)

An increase in preload, which is primarily determined
by venous return, will lead to an increase in cardiac output according to Starling’s law. The increased right ventricular EDV (preload) increases the initial stretch of the
right ventricular myocardium. Within a few beats, the
increased force of contraction and increased right ventricular SV will increase pulmonary pressures and thus
increase filling of the left ventricle and left ventricular
EDV. This will increase left ventricular SV (and therefore
CO). Although the increase in SV is not instant, the imbalance between VR and SV is only transient. A decrease
in preload will decrease CO according to the same
principle.

Change in afterload

To illustrate the importance of precisely matching right
and left ventricular stroke volume, consider the
consequence of right SV being slightly greater than left
SV. Although not a problem if transient, if such an
imbalance persists, pulmonary blood volume and, as a
result, pulmonary blood pressure would increase,
leading to congestion and pulmonary oedema. This can
occur in left ventricular heart failure.

Starling’s experiments were conducted on an isolated
heart–lung preparation in 1914. While it is not possible
to monitor the determinants of CO in the way Starling
could by isolating the heart and lungs, cardiologists can
insert a single catheter from the femoral artery back up
the aorta and into the left ventricle by passing it retrogradely through the aortic valve. The catheter contains
conductance sensors to measure left ventricular volume
and a pressure sensor at the tip. This freely records
pressure–volume loops. Fig. 4.12 shows the pressure–
volume loop for the left ventricle and how this is
affected by changes in EDV and contractility.
Starling’s findings in the controlled situation of the
isolated heart–lung preparation are important in enabling clinicians to understand the importance of:
• Adequate, but not excessive filling of the ventricles
(e.g. in heart failure, high EDV may be pathological).
• Keeping peripheral resistance as low as possible to
maximize CO (reducing afterload).

52

pressure (mmHg)

An increase in afterload will reduce the amount of blood
ejected from the left ventricle, initially decreasing SV
and increasing ESV. Assuming constant filling pressures,
this will result in a greater EDV during the next cycle.
The increased preload will increase the force of the
next contraction to restore stroke volume despite the
increased afterload.

increased MAP result in a decreased SV). The end-systolic points
of the loops produce the Starling curve so long as the
contractility remains constant.

• Maintaining a sufficient level of contractility to
maintain life when the previous determinants have
been optimized.
These factors are particularly important when considering the treatment of patients with heart failure
and will be discussed further in Chapter 8.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that cardiac output is limited by venous
return – without integrated regulation of the
cardiovascular system, an increased heart rate will be
compensated by reduced stroke volume.

HAEMODYNAMICS IN BLOOD
VESSELS

Blood flow and velocity
In normal arteries and veins, the pattern of blood flow
is described as laminar flow (Fig. 5.1), in which blood
flows in a number of parallel planes, with those in the
centre flowing faster than those towards the wall of
the vessel. This occurs because there is a shear force between layers of blood and the outermost layer of
blood and the static wall that causes resistance and
slows blood flowing at the periphery of the vessel.
Turbulent flow occurs in the ventricles and ‘single-file’
flow occurs in capillaries where the diameter of the vessel is the same (or often less than) the diameter of red
and white blood cells. Although this is a simplistic
view, it is sufficient for most basic purposes.

Blood flow is defined as the volume of blood that
flows through a given tissue in a given time. Darcy’s
law (which is equivalent to Ohm’s law) states:
Flow ¼ Perfusion pressure=resistance
In a single vascular bed, the blood flow is determined
by the arterial pressure minus venous pressure (the perfusion pressure), divided by the resistance to flow in
that vascular bed. When considering the circulation
as a whole, total blood flow is equal to the cardiac
output, and:
Cardiac output ¼ ðMean arterial blood pressure
central venous pressureÞ=
systemic vascular resistance
The velocity of blood flow is inversely related to the
total cross-sectional area (Fig. 5.2). The branching nature
of the circulatory system means that the total crosssectional area of the capillaries is much greater than that
of the large arteries or veins. This substantially reduces velocity in the capillaries, allowing diffusion to take place.

HINTS AND TIPS
Disruption of laminar flow can occur at branching
points (e.g. the carotid artery bifurcation) or when
there is a narrowing of a vessel. This is important
because this disrupted pattern of flow promotes
atherosclerosis.

Vascular resistance
Poiseuille’s law
Poiseuille determined that resistance (R) to the steady
laminar flow of a fluid through a tube is proportional
to the length of the tube (l), viscosity of the fluid (Z),

and inversely proportional to the fourth power of the
radius of the tube (r4). He stated that:
R ¼ 8Zl=pr4
Using Darcy’s law we can derive:
Flow ¼ ðPressure differenceÞ=pr4 =8Zl
From these equations we can explain the resistance
element of Fig. 5.3:
• Total resistance in the vasculature is greatest in the
arterioles, through a combination of their length
and reduced radius without a significant change in
total cross-sectional area.
• Capillary resistance is less than arteriolar resistance
because capillaries are shorter (0.5 mm), large numbers of capillaries occur in parallel, and they have
single-file flow rather than laminar flow. Remember,
however, that due to its smaller radius, a given

length of capillary will have greater resistance than
the same length of arteriole.
• Total resistance is dependent upon the arteriolar
radius, which is tightly controlled by numerous
factors, which are described in detail below.

Blood viscosity
Viscosity, described as ‘lack of slipperiness’ by Newton,
is the measure of the internal friction within a moving
fluid. According to Poiseuille’s law, resistance is proportional to viscosity and so, the viscosity of the blood
plays a role in determining resistance, and therefore
flow. The viscosity of blood is influenced by both the
plasma and cellular components of blood, but it is
the haematocrit (the percentage of red cells in the blood
volume) that is the main determinant.
A normal haematocrit value of 47% makes blood
viscosity about four times that of water, and is the optimal level for oxygen delivery. An elevated haematocrit

Arteries
increases the carriage of oxygen but increases viscosity,
impeding flow and increasing cardiac work. Polycythaemia is the term used to describe an increased haematocrit
and can be caused by a physiological adaptation to
chronic hypoxia or a myeloproliferative disease increasing red blood cell production by the bone marrow (polycythaemia rubra vera). It may also occur in severe
dehydration when circulating volume is reduced without
loss of any red blood cells.
Plasma viscosity is determined by the level of plasma
proteins (mainly albumins and globulins) and is increased in conditions such as myeloma, in which there
is increased production of immunoglobulin. In addition to increasing plasma viscosity, this increase in
plasma proteins promotes aggregation of red blood
cells, further increasing viscosity. The vessel diameter
and the rate of flow also influences red blood cell aggregation and as a result, the viscosity of blood is different
at different points in the vascular system.

ARTERIES

The pulse waveform
The waveform of arterial pressure during the cardiac cycle is shown in Fig 5.4:
• During the early part of ventricular ejection, the rate
of blood flowing into the aorta is greater than the

5

rate of blood flowing off into the peripheral circulation. This increases the volume of blood in the aorta
and thus the pressure. The peak pressure reached is
known as the systolic blood pressure (SBP).
• As ejection declines and during diastole, flow from
the aorta into the peripheral vessels is greater than
flow into the aorta and the pressure drops. The pressure at the end of diastole (which is the lowest in the
cycle) is termed diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
• Closure of the aortic valve causes a transient rise in
aortic pressure, referred to as the ‘dicrotic notch’.
During systole, when aortic pressure increases, the
walls of these elastic arteries are stretched and store
some of the energy generated by ventricular contraction.
They then recoil during diastole to maintain pressure
and convert the intermittent flow from the left ventricle
into the aorta into more continuous flow into the
peripheral vasculature, maintaining perfusion pressure.
This stretching and subsequent recoil of the wall of large
elastic arteries is known as the Windkessel effect.
Factors that alter the rate of ventricular ejection or
outflow from the aorta to the peripheral circulation will
alter the shape of the pulse waveform. Aortic stenosis,
for example, decreases the rate of ejection and causes
what is described as a ‘slow rising’ pulse while aortic
regurgitation, in which blood flows back into the heart
through the aortic valve, causes a ‘collapsing’ pulse.
These are shown in Fig. 5.5.

pressure (mmHg)

Arterial blood pressure is determined in the elastic arteries such as the aorta and its major branches, and in the
presence of steady venous pressures determines the perfusion pressure for the body’s tissues. Arterial blood
pressure is expressed as the SBP/DBP.

Non-invasive measurement of arterial blood pressure is
performed using a sphygmomanometer. In clinical
practice it is usually measured using an automatic
sphygmomanometer (a machine) but it is important
to be able to measure it conventionally with a manual

sphygmomanometer and a stethoscope. It is also important to appreciate the theory underlying this technique.
The sphygmomanometer is used as follows:

Mean arterial blood pressure
(mABP)

1. A suitably sized cuff is wrapped around the upper
arm of the patient, who should be sitting or lying
with the sphygmomanometer at the level of their
heart.
2. The radial or brachial pulse is palpated, and the cuff
inflated until the pulse is no longer palpable. This is
an estimation of the systolic blood pressure.
3. The brachial artery is auscultated at the medial side
of the antecubital fossa with a stethoscope. No
sound should be heard.
4. The cuff pressure is gradually lowered (1–2 mmHg/
second) until a dull tapping sound is heard. The measurement taken at this time is the systolic pressure.
5. Further lowering of the cuff pressure results in louder
sounds until the sounds suddenly become quieter,
and then disappear. The measurement taken at this
time is the diastolic pressure.

The mean arterial blood pressure is not simply the
average of the systolic and diastolic pressures. It can
be estimated using the equation:

There are a number of audible stages when manually
measuring blood pressure, known as the Korotkoff
sounds:
I.
II.

Sharp thud (taken to be systolic blood pressure).
Loud blowing sound.
Soft thud.
Soft blowing sound (occasionally used as diastolic
blood pressure, e.g. in pregnancy).
V. Onset of silence (taken to be diastolic blood
pressure).

Normal blood pressure
Normal blood pressure for a healthy adult male at rest is
120/80 mmHg. However, this value can vary with many
factors, all of which must be taken into account when
assessing a patient’s blood pressure:
• Ageing causes an increase in systolic blood pressure
because of decreased arterial compliance secondary
to arteriosclerosis. As a rough rule, systolic pressure
should be equal to 100 mmHg plus age in years.
• During sleep, blood pressure falls because of the
body’s decreased metabolic demands.
• Anger, sexual excitement and stress increase blood
pressure, all as a result of sympathetically mediated
responses.
Other factors that may cause changes in blood pressure include:
• Respiration: in the young, mean arterial pressure
falls by a small amount during inspiration because
of a transient fall in stroke volume.
• Pregnancy: blood pressure falls gradually in the first
trimester, reaching a minimum in the second trimester, and then rises to normal in the third trimester.

56

mABP ¼ DBP þ 1=3 ðSBP  DBPÞ
By rearranging Darcy’s law we can deduce:
Mean arterial blood pressure ¼
cardiac output=total peripheral resistance
Cardiac output determines the rate of inflow of
blood into the aorta and thus determines the rate at
which aortic pressure rises. Total peripheral resistance
(TPR) determines the rate of outflow from the aorta
and thus the rate at which the pressure drops during diastole. As a rule of thumb, SBP is determined by stroke
volume and DBP is determined by TPR. DBP is also affected by heart rate in that as heart rate increases, the duration of diastole shortens and the period in which
pressure falls before the onset of systole shortens.

Pulse pressure
The difference between the SBP and the DBP is referred to
as the pulse pressure. For a normal BP of 120/80 mmHg,
the pulse pressure is 40 mmHg. Pulse pressure can be
altered under different circumstances, for example:
• Ageing: as we age, the wall of the aorta becomes less
elastic. As a result, there is a greater increase in pressure during ventricular ejection because the walls are
less distensible, and thus SBP is higher. DBP, on the
other hand, is reduced because the lack of elastic
recoil means that pressure drops at a greater rate
during diastole. This increases the pulse pressure.
• Haemorrhage: after significant haemorrhage, when
blood volume is reduced, stroke volume is usually
reduced due to decrease in preload, decreasing
SBP. In order to maintain mABP and thus perfusion
pressure, TPR is increased, raising DBP and decreasing the pulse pressure. (This example will be discussed further in Ch. 6).
• Aortic valve disease: look at Fig. 5.5. The pulse pressure is decreased in aortic stenosis and increased in
aortic regurgitation.

ARTERIOLES
Arterioles are the site of greatest resistance to blood flow in
the circulatory system. The abundant smooth muscle in
the wall of these vessels allows lumen diameter to be
tightly controlled. Contraction of vascular smooth muscle
decreases the diameter of the vessel lumen and relaxation

Arterioles
increases it. According to Poiseuille’s equations, resistance
to flow is proportional to the fourth power of the radius.
This means that a very small change in lumen radius will
have a significant impact of resistance and thus flow.
Control over arteriolar diameter is achieved by a number of tightly regulated mechanisms, which will be discussed in detail below, and has three important functions:
• Coordinated constriction or dilatation of a large proportion of arterioles will alter the total peripheral
resistance and thus arterial blood pressure.
• Constriction or dilatation of arterioles in single
organs allows the distribution of the cardiac output
to different organs to be regulated. Dilatation of the
arterioles in a particular organ will decrease resistance and increase flow to that organ.
• Constriction or dilatation of arterioles influences the
hydrostatic forces in the capillaries and as a result
has an effect on fluid filtration (explained below).
Constriction of arterioles increases resistance and
causes a greater pressure drop, reducing the pressure
in the distal vessels, including the capillaries.

Control of vascular smooth muscle
(VSM) tone
Tight control over the arteriolar vascular smooth muscle
tone is achieved via numerous mechanisms. Many of
the same factors also have an effect on the vascular
smooth muscle of the venous capacitance vessels. These
mechanisms can be broadly divided into local influences and systemic influences. The mechanisms of
VSM contraction and relaxation have been discussed
in Chapter 2 but in short, it is important to remember
that vasoconstriction is an active process brought about
by the contraction of vascular smooth muscle, which as
for cardiac muscle requires an increase in cytosolic
[Ca2þ]. Vasodilatation occurs when VSM relaxes and
the pressure of blood within the vessel causes it to
distend.

Local influences
Myogenic tone
This describes the constrictor response of vascular
smooth muscle to stretching of the vessel wall as a result
of increased internal pressure. It plays an important role
in autoregulation and also contributes to basal tone.
The higher the internal hydrostatic pressure, the greater
the degree of myogenic constriction.

Endothelium-derived substances
Endothelial cells play an important role in the local regulation of blood flow. Although they do not have a contractile function, they release a number of dilator and

5

constrictor substances, which act on the adjacent
smooth muscle cells and influence arteriolar tone.
The importance of the balance between dilator and
constrictor influences on resting VSM can be
demonstrated by the administration of a nitric oxide
(NO) synthase inhibitor. This causes a 30% increase in
blood pressure by increasing total peripheral resistance.
This increase is a result of loss of basal release of NO.

Endothelium-derived dilator factors
Endothelium-derived dilating factors include nitric oxide (NO), prostacyclin (PGI2) and endothelium derived
hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). NO is the most important dilator substance. In the endothelium, NO is produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).
eNOS is activated by an increase in intracellular
[Ca2þ] which can occur in response to factors such as
bradykinin, acetylcholine and substance P. It is also activated by the shear forces that are exerted on the endothelial cells by the blood flowing through the vessel.
Following its production by eNOS, NO diffuses to the
adjacent vascular smooth muscle cells and activates
the enzyme guanylyl cyclase increasing levels of cGMP
and bringing about dilatation (see Fig. 2.56). In addition to its vasodilator properties, NO has other effects
including inhibition of platelet function and inhibition
of leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium. Endothelial
derived dilator substances, particularly NO, provide a
tonic vasodilator effect that counteracts the tonic myogenic vasoconstriction and it is the balance of these that
determines the resting tone of the vessel.

Endothelium-derived constrictor factors
Endothelium-derived constricting factors include endothelin 1, thromboxane A2 and prostaglandin H2.
Endothelin 1 is the most important constrictor released
by the endothelium. It is released in response to vasoconstrictor substances including adrenaline/epinephrine, vasopressin and angiotensin II. It then diffuses to the
adjacent smooth muscle cells and causes constriction via
G-protein coupled mechanisms similar to those activated
when noradrenaline/norepinephrine binds to a adrenoceptors (see Fig. 2.54).

Metabolic factors
Locally produced products of metabolism diffuse into
the tunica media of the arterioles and cause relaxation
of VSM and thus vasodilatation. The amount of these
factors released correlates with the local metabolic rate
and as a result this process couples blood flow with the

57

Haemodynamics and vascular function
metabolic requirements of the tissue and is particularly
important in the myocardium and skeletal muscle. The
substances responsible for this so called functional or
metabolic hyperaemia (increase in blood flow) are
not fully established and are different in each organ
but candidates include Hþ ions, Kþ ions, hypoxia,
adenosine, phosphate ions and prostaglandins.
Another process underpinned by these locally released metabolic factors is that of reactive hyperaemia.
This occurs when blood flow is restored to a tissue after
a period of interrupted flow, and the amount of blood
flowing into the tissue is greater than that under resting
conditions, even though there has been no change in
the metabolic rate of that tissue. This response is in place
to aid removal of metabolic by-products that have accumulated during the period of no flow and to restore oxygen supply as quickly as possible. The effect is
temporary and decays exponentially as the metabolic
factors are transported away in the blood, reducing their
concentration and vasodilator effect.
In both of these processes, metabolites only act on
the vascular smooth muscle of the arterioles within that
tissue. Although those arterioles are then dilated, in order for blood flow to that tissue to increase, there must
also be vasodilatation of the arteries and arterioles upstream that do not necessarily lie within the tissue they
supply. This is brought about by a process called flowmediated vasodilatation in which the shear force (friction of blood against the vessel wall) on the endothelial
cells stimulates them to release factors that cause relaxation of adjacent smooth muscle cells.

Other local factors
A number of other substances that are produced, secreted and act locally have an effect on vascular smooth
muscle tone. They include:
• Histamine: this is an inflammatory mediator that
causes arteriolar vasodilatation (H1 receptormediated). In veins, it causes vasoconstriction and
increased permeability (H2 receptor-mediated).
• Bradykinin: this inflammatory mediator causes
endothelium-dependent vasodilatation and increases vascular permeability.
• Thromboxane A2: this is a platelet activator that
causes vasoconstriction; it is involved in haemostasis.
• Leukotrienes: these are inflammatory mediators synthesized from arachidonic acid by the enzyme lipoxygenase. They are produced by leukocytes, and cause
vasoconstriction and increased vascular permeability.
• Platelet activating factor (PAF): this is an inflammatory mediator that causes vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability.
The net effect of these inflammatory mediators is
vasodilatation and increased vascular permeability.

58

These changes bring about redness, warmth and swelling (due to oedema), three of the characteristic features
of inflammation.

Systemic influences
The local influences described above serve only the needs
of the local tissues without taking into account the requirements of the whole body, including maintenance
of blood pressure. Consider a situation in which all the tissues in the body had increased requirements and thus local factors brought about vasodilatation in all the tissues
simultaneously. This would cause a massive decrease in
total peripheral resistance, decreasing blood pressure. In
order to maintain blood pressure, the central nervous system exerts effects on vascular tone that are superimposed
on those local factors. There are also hormonal factors that
act systemically to influence vascular tone.

Autonomic nervous influences
Sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves
Sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves innervate the vascular
smooth muscle of the arterioles and of the venous vessels.
In arterioles, a basal level of activity of these nerves is partly
responsible for vessel tone at rest. The neurotransmitter
involved is noradrenaline/norepinephrine, which acts
on a1 receptors on vascular smooth muscle causing contraction. This contraction is brought about by a G-protein
coupled response that increases cytosolic [Ca2þ] in the
VSM cells in response to binding of noradrenaline/norepinephrine. A decrease in sympathetic nerve activity
has the opposite effect, and causes relaxation of VSM
and vasodilatation.
Under normal circumstances in most vascular beds, it is
decreased activity of sympathetic nerves acting on a1
adrenoceptors that brings about vasodilatation, not
increased activity on b2 receptors.

The amount of neurotransmitter released is primarily
dependent on the degree of sympathetic activity but it is
also modulated by other factors. These include locally
produced metabolites including adenosine and Kþ that
decrease the amount of noradrenaline/norepinephrine
released. Angiotensin II has the opposite effect, increasing noradrenaline/norepinephrine release and augmenting vasoconstriction.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is important to remember sympathetic activity to
different parts of the body can be adjusted
independently. It is not an all or nothing system.

Arterioles

Sympathetic vasodilator nerves
In some species (though not humans), some tissues, including skeletal muscle, are also innervated by sympathetic vasodilator nerves. In humans, this sympathetic
dilator innervation is only present in the sweat glands.
In skeletal muscle, vascular bed stimulation by these
nerves (which use acetylcholine as the neurotransmitter
and act on muscarinic receptors) causes vasodilatation.
Stimulation only occurs as part of an ‘alerting response’,
and it is initiated in the forebrain without any brainstem
influence. The vasodilator effect is only temporary, and it
plays no role in blood pressure regulation. Stimulation of
these nerves in sweat glands, probably also involving
vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) as a neurotransmitter,
brings about sweating and cutaneous vasodilatation.

Parasympathetic vasodilator nerves
Parasympathetic vasodilator nerves innervate the blood
vessels of the:
•
•
•
•
•

Genitalia.
Skin.
Salivary glands.
Pancreas.
Gastrointestinal mucosa.

The neurotransmitters involved include acetylcholine, VIP and the potent vasodilator nitric oxide. The effect of these nerves on the total peripheral resistance is
small because of their limited innervation. These nerves
are crucial for initiating an erection. Upon stimulation
they produce a vasodilatation in the arterioles supplying
the corpus cavernosum of the penis. This increases
blood flow into the penis.

Hormonal influences
Although the vasculature is influenced by circulating
hormones, short-term control is primarily achieved by
the autonomic nervous system under basal conditions.
Many of these hormones (except catecholamines) have
an important role in regulation of fluid excretion in the
kidneys as well as effects on vascular tone.

Catecholamines
The catecholamines (adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/norepinephrine) are secreted from the adrenal medulla.
More than three times as much adrenaline/epinephrine is secreted as noradrenaline/norepinephrine; however, plasma levels of noradrenaline/norepinephrine
are higher than adrenaline/epinephrine due to spillover
from sympathetic nerve terminals. Secretion of both catecholamines is increased in response to exercise, hypotension and stressful ‘fight or flight’ situations.

5

Both adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/
norepinephrine bind b1 receptors in the myocardium,
increasing heart rate and contractility, and bind a1
adrenoceptors on vascular smooth muscle causing vasoconstriction, but their affinities for these receptors
differ. Adrenaline/epinephrine, but not noradrenaline/norepinephrine, has a high affinity for b2 receptors,
which are present in skeletal muscle and the myocardium. Binding of adrenaline/epinephrine to these
receptors brings about vasodilatation. Circulating catecholamines do not have as great an effect as noradrenaline/norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve
terminals because the neurally released noradrenaline/norepinephrine is specifically targeted at the appropriate receptors.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember adrenaline/epinephrine does not cause
vasodilatation in all tissues, only those that express b2
receptors. Even in these tissues, it still binds a receptors,
but the dilator effect of b receptor activation
predominates.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
ADH (also called vasopressin) is a peptide produced in
the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary directly into the bloodstream. A rise in plasma osmolality is the main stimulus for secretion. Falling
blood pressure and angiotensin II are also stimuli for
ADH release, but to a lesser degree. ADH promotes water retention in the renal tubules and high levels of ADH
also cause vasoconstriction in most tissues. The cerebral
and coronary vessels, in contrast, demonstrate a nitric
oxide-mediated dilatation in response to ADH.

Angiotensin II
Renin is an enzyme produced by the juxtaglomerular
cells of the kidney. It converts circulating angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Fig. 5.6). Renin production is
increased by:
• A fall in afferent arteriolar hydrostatic pressure
which supplies the renal glomeruli.
• Increased sympathetic activity to the renal arterioles.
• Binding of adrenaline/epinephrine to b1 receptors in
the kidney.
• Decreased Naþ in the macula densa of the adjacent
distal tubule.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angiotensin I to the peptide angiotensin II (Fig. 5.6), predominantly on the endothelium of the pulmonary
vascular bed. Angiotensin II is the active component

of this so-called renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and
has the following actions:
• Increases aldosterone secretion from the adrenal cortex, leading to salt and water reabsorption in the distal tubules of the kidneys.
• Causes vasoconstriction by acting directly on vascular
smooth muscle, augmenting release of noradrenaline/norepinephrine from sympathetic nerve terminals, and increasing sympathetic outflow from the
brainstem.
• Stimulates release of ADH from the posterior
pituitary.

Natriuretic peptides
In response to high cardiac filling pressures, specialized
myocytes in the atria secrete atrial natriuretic peptide
(ANP) as they are stretched. In a similar manner, ventricular myocytes secrete brain natriuretic peptide
(BNP) in response to stretch. These natriuretic peptides
increase the excretion of salt and water in renal tubules
and have a mild vasodilator effect.

Autoregulation
Autoregulation is the process whereby tissue perfusion
remains relatively constant across a range of perfusion
pressures. This helps to keep capillary filtration pressure
at a stable value. Autoregulation is central to regulation
of blood flow in the cerebral circulation but is not present in most vascular beds.
Flow is determined by perfusion pressure and resistance. Therefore, to keep flow constant, any change in
perfusion pressure must be matched by a change in
resistance. An increase in perfusion pressure causes arteriolar vasoconstriction, thereby increasing resistance.
Likewise, a decrease in perfusion pressure causes arteriolar vasodilatation and decreases resistance. It takes
roughly 30–60 seconds for the effect to take place so

60

there is an initial increase in flow with a pressure increase before a steady state is reached.
Autoregulation only occurs over a limited pressure
range, and if perfusion pressure drops below the autoregulatory range or increases beyond it, blood flow cannot be maintained at its set level. It is an intrinsic feature
of the vessels, and it is independent of nervous control.
However, it does not mean that tissue perfusion is constant all the time in vivo. Autoregulation can be reset to
work at a new level by, for example, an increased sympathetic drive. The mechanisms for autoregulation
include:
• Myogenic response: described above.
• Vasodilator washout: this idea is based on the effect
of blood flow on the levels of locally produced metabolites. When blood flow increases, there is greater
removal of vasodilator metabolites allowing the arterioles to constrict and restoring flow to its set level.

HYPERTENSION
Current British Hypertension Society guidelines define
hypertension as a sustained resting blood pressure
above 140 mmHg systolic and/or 90 mmHg diastolic.
These criteria, however, are somewhat arbitrary as blood
pressure rises with age and levels are variable within
populations. Cardiovascular disease risk increases with
increasing blood pressure, even within the normal
range.

Classification and causes
Hypertension is classified according to its underlying
cause. Primary (essential) hypertension accounts for
95% of hypertensive patients; the precise aetiology is
unknown, but it is probably multifactorial. Remember
that to have an increase in blood pressure there must
be an increase in cardiac output, total peripheral resistance or both. Predisposing factors include:
•
•
•
•
•

Age (blood pressure rises with age).
Obesity.
Excessive alcohol intake.
High salt intake.
Genetic susceptibility.

Secondary hypertension accounts for the remaining
5% of cases. Here, the hypertension arises as a result
of another disease process. Causes of secondary hypertension include:
• Renal: parenchymal damage can cause an increase in
BP. Atherosclerosis in the renal arteries causing renal
artery stenosis also causes hypertension by decreasing
renal perfusion stimulating the renin–angiotensin
system.

5

Hypertension
• Endocrine.
• Conn’s syndrome (primary hyperaldosteronism):
causes salt and water retention, increasing blood
volume, preload and therefore cardiac output.
• Phaeochromocytoma: catecholamine–releasing
tumour of the adrenal medulla.
• Coarctation of the aorta: a narrowing of the aorta,
usually just distal to the left subclavian vein increases
resistance to flow through the aorta, thus increasing
total peripheral resistance and blood pressure.
• Pregnancy: hypertension occurs during 10% of first
pregnancies.
• Drugs: the oral contraceptive pill causes hypertension in approximately 5% of women.

Effects of hypertension of the vessels
Hypertension not only accelerates atherosclerosis, but it
also results in characteristic changes to arterioles and
small arteries – known as arteriolosclerosis. All these
changes are associated with narrowing of the vessel
lumen. Changes in benign hypertension include:
• In arteries: muscular hypertrophy of the media, reduplication of the external lamina and intimal
thickening.
• In arterioles: hyaline arteriosclerosis (protein deposits
in wall).
• In vessels of the brain: microaneurysms (Charcot–
Bouchard aneurysms) can occur.

Malignant hypertension
In this condition, blood pressure rises rapidly to very
high levels with the diastolic pressure exceeding
130–140 mmHg. It is more common in secondary
hypertension, especially phaeochromocytoma, and it
causes rapid development of end-organ damage.
HINTS AND TIPS
The distinction between primary and secondary
hypertension is of great clinical significance, since only
in the latter case is treatment of the underlying cause
possible. The younger the patients and the less risk
factors that are present, the more effort that should be
made to find an underlying cause.

Antihypertensive drugs
Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (e.g.
captopril, enalapril, perindopril) inhibit the conversion
of angiotensin I to angiotensin II by ACE (Fig. 5.7). They
also inhibit bradykinin (a vasodilator) breakdown by
ACE. Side-effects include first dose hypotension, a skin
rash and a dry cough (in approximately 10%). They
should not be used to treat patients with severe renal artery stenosis because inhibition of angiotensin II production will prevent the efferent arteriolar constriction
that maintains glomerular filtration in the presence of
renal artery stenosis.

Complications of hypertension
• Atherosclerosis: hypertension increases the risk of
developing clinically significant atherosclerotic plaques. This increases the risk of stroke, peripheral vascular disease and myocardial infarction.
• Renal damage: gradual development of renal dysfunction occurs in hypertension, especially if it is
poorly controlled. The pattern of renal disease
caused by hypertension is often referred to as hypertensive nephrosclerosis.
• Cardiac: the increased afterload caused by the raised
blood pressure increases left ventricular work
and causes left ventricular hypertrophy. This can
lead to heart failure.
• Arrhythmia: the risk of atrial fibrillation is increased
in hypertensive individuals.
• Retinal damage: retinal haemorrhages and papilloedema (in advanced stages) cause visual disturbances.
Note that hypertension itself is usually asymptomatic, and in essential hypertension no obvious cause
can be found. This can affect compliance with therapy,
especially if drugs have unwanted side-effects.

Haemodynamics and vascular function

Angiotensin II receptor antagonists
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists (e.g. losartan) inhibit angiotensin II from binding to its receptor. They
are useful when ACE inhibitors have produced an intolerable cough (caused by elevated bradykinin).

Diuretics
Usually a thiazide-type diuretic is used (e.g. bendroflumethiazide). These drugs inhibit sodium reabsorption
in the distal renal tubule, which causes increased salt
and water excretion, decreasing blood volume and
thus decreasing blood pressure. Although loop diuretics (e.g. furosemide) produce a more marked diuresis, they are not used in hypertension. Thiazide
diuretics also have a direct vasodilator effect, further reducing blood pressure. The important side-effect to be
aware of is hypokalaemia, which increases the risk of
arrhythmia.

Alpha-blockers
Alpha-blockers (e.g. prazosin and doxazosin) are
antagonists of a adrenoceptors. There is postsynaptic
blockade of a1 adrenoceptors, which prevents sympathetically mediated VSM contraction and leads to vasodilatation. They cause a decrease in total peripheral
resistance and thus a decrease in blood pressure. Doxazosin is often used for labile (catecholamine-mediated)
hypertension. Blockade of a receptors also prevents
sympathetically mediated release of renin in the
kidneys.
Side-effects of alpha-blockers include postural hypotension caused by loss of sympathetic vasoconstriction,
particularly marked following the first dose.

Calcium channel blockers
Calcium channel antagonists (e.g. verapamil, nifedipine, amlodipine, diltiazem) block voltage-gated calcium channels in myocardium and vascular smooth
muscle. This causes a decrease in myocardial contractility, electrical conductance and vascular tone. Calcium
antagonists interfere with the action of various vasoconstrictor agonists (e.g. noradrenaline/norepinephrine,
angiotensin II, thrombin). Verapamil predominantly
acts on the heart and decreases heart rate by causing
an inhibition of conduction through the AV node. It
also acts on the myocardium exerting a negative inotropic effect. It should be used only very cautiously
with beta-blockers as this may lead to heart block.
Nifedipine and amlodipine (dihydropiridines) act
peripherally on arterioles, relaxing arteriolar vascular
smooth muscle and causing vasodilatation. These dihydropiridine calcium channel blockers do not slow the

62

heart rate. Diltiazem acts both on the heart and on
the arterioles.
The targets and effects of the different calcium channel
blockers:
• Verapamil: acts on myocardial and AV nodal cells
decreasing heart rate and decreasing contractility.
• Diltiazem: acts on the heart and arterioles decreasing
heart rate and causing vasodilatation.
• Amlodipine and nifedipine: act on arterioles causing
vasodilatation.

Beta-blockers
Beta-blockers are antagonists of b adrenoceptors. They
block sympathetic activity in the heart (b1), peripheral
vasculature (b2) and other tissues including the bronchi
(b2). In the heart, this results in a decrease in heart rate
and myocardial contractility, which reduces cardiac output and blood pressure.
The effect of beta-blockers on the peripheral vasculature leads to a loss of b-mediated vasodilatation causing
an unopposed a vasoconstriction. This may initially
cause an increase in vascular resistance, elevating blood
pressure, but, in long-term use, the vascular resistance
returns to pretreatment levels. Some beta-blockers can
preferentially act on b1 adrenoceptors, being more cardioselective; however, even these drugs have some
blocking effect on the b2 adrenoceptor. Types of betablockers include:
• Propranolol, atenolol (act on b1, b2).
• Metoprolol, bisoprolol (selective b1 blockers).
The main side-effects of beta-blockers are bronchoconstriction and bradycardia. They should therefore
not be used in people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as they may exacerbate
symptoms.

Choice of drugs
The choice of antihypertensive agents in newly diagnosed patients should be guided by the British Hypertension Society algorithm, shown in Fig. 5.8.

CAPILLARIES
In most tissues, groups of capillaries (often referred to
as a capillary unit) are supplied by a single terminal arteriole, and the tone of the vascular smooth muscle in
that arteriole determines the perfusion of that capillary
unit. In certain vascular beds, such as the mesenteric circulation, capillaries branch from vessels that run directly

local factors such as those described above. Under normal
conditions, tone in these terminal arterioles and precapillary sphincters fluctuates between constriction and
dilatation, a process termed vasomotion. This means that
blood flow through capillaries is intermittent as the perfusion pressure for individual capillary units is altered.
Changes in terminal arteriolar diameter and capillary perfusion pressure also have an impact on fluid filtration
(explained below).
Capillary diameter is often smaller than red blood
cell diameter (3–6 mm compared with 8–10 mm), but
because the red blood cells can deform they are still able
to pass through the microvasculature. Under certain
pathological conditions such as sickle cell anaemia,
red blood cells become more rigid as the concentration
of oxygen decreases in the blood (as occurs during capillary transit) and can cause obstruction of the microvasculature, precipitating a vaso-occlusive crisis.

from small arterioles to venules. Blood flow through these
capillaries is regulated by small rings of smooth muscle
called ‘pre-capillary sphincters’ (Fig. 5.9). The vascular
smooth muscle in these microvessels has relatively sparse
innervation and the tone is predominantly controlled by

Exchange of solutes in the microvasculature generally
occurs by diffusion down concentration gradients.
The processes involved are depicted in Fig. 5.10 and
include:
1. Diffusion through the endothelial cells: lipid-soluble
substances such as oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse
through the endothelial cell lipid membranes and
into the extracellular space. The rate of diffusion is
governed by Fick’s law, which states that diffusion
equals the diffusion constant of the barrier (i.e. the
capillary wall), multiplied by the surface area available for diffusion and the concentration gradient of
the substance.

2. Diffusion through pores and fenestrations in the
capillary wall: water and water-soluble substances
(e.g. glucose, amino acids, ions) diffuse through
small ‘pores’ that constitute the intercellular clefts
between endothelial cells. This process is also called
bulk flow. The degree of bulk flow varies in different
organs depending on the structure of the capillaries
(see Ch. 2). Vascular beds with continuous capillaries limit bulk flow while some vascular beds such
as the exocrine glands, liver and spleen have large
gaps in the capillary wall (due to their fenestrated
or discontinuous structure), have a relatively high
permeability and allow greater bulk flow. There
are also a few large pores for larger molecules, especially in the liver and spleen where the endothelial
cells are discontinuous. In the brain, the endothelial
cell junctions have a complex arrangement of fibres
that make them impermeable to lipophobic molecules. This comprises the blood–brain barrier,
which tightly controls transport of molecules in
and out of the brain.
3. Vesicular transport.
Some molecules (e.g. plasma proteins) are transported across the endothelial cell by transcytotic vesicles. Unlike the processes already described that are
all passive, this is an active transport process requiring energy.
HINTS AND TIPS
Diffusion of oxygen can be enhanced by increased
blood concentration, increased blood flow, increased
surface area, or decreased tissue oxygen
concentration. For carbon dioxide, the diffusion
constant is much higher and diffusion is limited by
blood flow alone.

Fluid exchange
When considering fluid exchange in the microcirculation, consider two compartments. The intravascular
(capillary) compartment and the interstitial (tissue)
compartment (the two components of the extracellular
fluid). Fluid can freely pass between the intravascular
compartment of the capillaries and post-capillary venules and the interstitial space around them by bulk
flow. This movement of fluid, termed fluid filtration,
is governed by two opposing forces according to
Starling’s hypothesis of tissue fluid formation.

1. Hydrostatic pressure
Hydrostatic pressure is the pressure exerted on the wall
of a vessel by the fluid within. The net hydrostatic pressure is the difference between the hydrostatic in the intravascular space (capillary hydrostatic pressure, CHP)
and the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial fluid (tissue hydrostatic pressure, THP). Capillary hydrostatic
pressure is typically 37 mmHg at the arterial end of
the capillary and 17 mmHg at the venous end, falling
steadily along the length of the vessel. The pressure at
the arterial end will vary with the vasomotion that results from changes in vascular tone in the terminal arterioles. The hydrostatic pressure of the interstitial fluid is
low, around 2 mmHg and remains stable along the
length of the capillary. As a result the net outward
hydrostatic pressure falls from 35 mmHg to 15 mmHg
along the length of the capillary and causes filtration of
fluid from the capillaries into the interstitium.

2. Oncotic pressure
Oncotic pressure (also known as colloid osmotic pressure) is determined by the concentration of large plasma
proteins that cannot usually diffuse across capillary

Lymph and the lymphatic system
walls. The significantly larger concentrations of these
within the plasma results in a capillary oncotic pressure
of around 25 mmHg and a tissue (interstitial) oncotic
pressure of 1 mmHg. These forces cause a net movement of fluid (reabsorption) from the interstitium into
the vascular space because water always moves by osmosis from areas of low solute concentration to areas of
high solute concentration. Effectively, the net oncotic
pressure pulls fluid from the interstitial compartment
into the capillaries. This remains relatively constant
along the length of the vessel. If the permeability of
the capillary wall to large molecules is increased, however, plasma proteins will diffuse into the interstitium
and there will be an increase in tissue oncotic pressure,
decreasing the net oncotic pressure. Such an increase in
capillary permeability occurs in response to release of
local inflammatory mediators such as histamine, bradykinin and leukotrienes.

Net filtration
The net movement of fluid in or out of the capillary at
any one point depends on the balance of the net hydrostatic pressure and net oncotic pressure. At the arterial
end of the capillary a net filtration of fluid (out of the
capillary) occurs, whereas at the venous end a net reabsorption (into the capillary) takes place (Fig. 5.11).
Under basal conditions in the body as a whole, approximately 20 L of fluid is filtered out of the capillaries and
16 L reabsorbed into the capillaries every 24 h. This net
loss from the vascular space is returned via the

lymphatic system. The balance of these forces and thus
the net amount of fluid filtration is influenced by a
number of factors, some of which are illustrated in
Fig. 5.12.
If a large amount of fluid is filtered into the interstitial space and the lymphatic drainage is not sufficient to
remove it, it causes swelling of the tissue known as oedema. This often occurs in the ankles where the capillary
hydrostatic pressure is greatest due to the effect of gravity. Fluid filtration in the pulmonary circulation is of
great importance. Excessive filtration of fluid into the
interstitium, termed pulmonary oedema, restricts gas
exchange in the alveoli and can cause respiratory failure.
This can occur when pulmonary venous pressures are
raised in left ventricular heart failure, or when there is
a large local or systemic inflammatory response during
which vascular permeability is increased, increasing
tissue oncotic pressure.

LYMPH AND THE LYMPHATIC
SYSTEM

Distribution of the lymphatic
tissues
Fluid, proteins and fat globules not reabsorbed into capillaries are brought back into the vascular system
through the lymphatic system (Fig. 5.13). There is a network of lymphatic capillaries, ducts, and lymph nodes
that drain excess tissue/interstitial fluid and unite to
form the thoracic duct, which drains the collected fluid
into the left subclavian vein. There are certain specialized areas of lymphatic tissue associated with the immune response but these are beyond the scope of
this book.
Fluid and proteins in the interstitial space are driven
into the lymphatic capillaries by the hydrostatic pressure of the interstitial fluid (tissue hydrostatic pressure).
Lymph is moved along the lymphatics by smooth muscle contractions in the vessel wall, which increase with
volume, and extrinsic propulsion by the skeletal muscle
pump and intestinal peristalsis. Backflow is prevented
by the presence of valves.

The lymphatics are the mopping up system of the body,

circulatory system. They also carry foreign antigens
from the blood to cells of the immune system located in
the lymph nodes.

These factors can be affected by both passive influences
and active influences. Always try and think of the forward (central venous pressure and cardiac filling pressures) and backward (capillary hydrostatic pressure)
effects of changes in venous volume and pressure. Look

As explained in Chapter 2, venous vessels are very compliant up to a point, at which pressure increases quickly

VEINS AND VENULES
Venules and veins are thin-walled, distensible vessels
that return blood from the capillaries to the right
atrium, but to think of them merely as passive conduits
is to greatly underestimate their importance. One important feature of venous vessels is the presence of
valves. These valves prevent backflow of blood within
the veins and are crucial because without them, venous
return would be limited. The effects of valve failure in
the lower limbs can be illustrated by the occurrence of
varicose veins (described in Ch. 9). Venous vessels have
other important functions and influences:
• Venous pressure is one of the determinants of fluid filtration by altering the capillary hydrostatic pressure.
• Due to their high compliance, venous vessels can
function as a reservoir for blood, the volume of
which can be controlled by numerous factors.
• The venous vessels determine the filling pressures of
the heart and thus the end-diastolic volume and
stroke volume according to Starling’s law.
The pressure in the veins (venous pressure) depends
on the volume of blood they contain and the state of
the smooth muscle in their walls and is extremely important because it determines the venous return to the

• 8–10 mmHg in the femoral vein.
• 0–6 mmHg in the central veins and right atrium.
Although these pressures are small, resistance is also
small, and the pressure is sufficient to drive blood into
the right atrium. Orthostasis (the movement from supine to standing) increases blood pressure in any vessel
below heart level and decreases pressure in any vessel
above. This is caused by the effect of gravity on the column of blood in the vessel. It is important to remember
that the effect of gravity occurs in venous and arterial
vessels alike. The increase in pressure in arteries and
veins is equal so although the absolute pressures increase, the perfusion pressure remains the same, maintaining tissue perfusion and not impeding the return of
blood to the heart. The increase in venous pressure does,
however, distend the veins resulting in a degree of venous pooling (approximately 500 mL), which causes
a decrease in cardiac output because of an ‘apparent’ reduction in circulating volume. There is also an increase
in capillary hydrostatic pressure (both arterial and venous end), which increases net filtration of fluid out
of the vascular compartment, decreasing circulating volume. These changes do not usually cause prolonged
haemodynamic changes because compensatory mechanisms are in place (explained in Ch. 6).

Skeletal muscle pump
Rhythmic exercise, especially of the leg muscles, produces a pumping effect increasing movement of venous
blood into the central veins, maintaining venous return
(Fig. 5.14). By pumping blood out of the active muscle,

however, decreases on inspiration because the pulmonary veins are stretched, and have a greater capacitance
during inspiration, which reduces left ventricular filling.
The opposite occurs during expiration. Overall, the
output of the two ventricles is equal over the whole
respiratory cycle.

Most of the factors described above that control the vascular smooth muscle of the arterioles have the same effect on the VSM of veins. There are some differences
though: for example, angiotensin II does not have a direct constrictor effect on veins, unlike that on arterioles,
and histamine, which causes vasodilatation in the
arterioles, causes constriction of veins.

Veins (not venules) are innervated with sympathetic
noradrenergic nerves. When stimulated these nerves
release noradrenaline/norepinephrine at the vascular
smooth muscle which causes venoconstriction by acting
on a adrenoceptors. This increases venous pressure and
reduces venous pooling, increasing venous return.

Circulating catecholamines
Circulating noradrenaline/norepinephrine and adrenaline/epinephrine can cause venoconstriction by acting
on a adrenoceptors on venous smooth muscle.

surrounding muscle drives the blood towards the heart. It is
prevented from returning by the closure of venous valves.

this muscle pump lowers the venous pressure in that
muscle, increasing perfusion pressure and increasing
blood flow through active muscles. It also decreases capillary hydrostatic pressure at the venous end of capillary
units, thereby reducing muscle swelling. Incompetent
venous valves will make the skeletal muscle pump ineffective. Static exercise (rather than dynamic), does
not act as a pump, but it does increase central venous
pressure because it prevents venous pooling by compressing the veins.

Respiratory pump
During inspiration, there is a decrease in intrathoracic
pressure and an increase in intra-abdominal pressure
as the diaphragm descends. This causes a rise in blood
flow into the thorax, increasing right-sided filling pressures and stroke volume. Left ventricular stroke volume,

REGULATION OF BLOOD FLOW
IN SPECIFIC TISSUES
Fig. 5.15 shows the proportion of blood flow received
by the major organs of the body. Although the major
vascular beds of the body share many characteristics,
they have a number of adaptations that make them better suited to their function.

Coronary circulation
Myocardial oxygen demand is very high, being about
8 mL O2/min/100 g, and can increase up to five-fold
during exercise. Even at rest, the coronary circulation receives 3–5% of the total cardiac output, 10 times the
average blood flow per gram of tissue. Oxygen levels
in coronary venous blood are very low (due to high oxygen extraction, > 70%), so an increase in demand can
only be met by increasing arterial flow. During systole,
coronary artery branches in the myocardium are compressed by the high transmural pressure gradients across
the myocardium, partially impeding blood flow. These

pressures are decreased during diastole and flow is restored. This is important to remember because situations where heart rate in increased, decreases the
duration of diastole and thus the time for maximal coronary blood flow (Fig. 5.16).
Oxygen transport is aided by the high capillary density (large area and decreased distance for exchange).
Blood flow is primarily controlled by local tissue levels
of the vasodilator adenosine which is produced from
the breakdown of ATP when the local concentration
of oxygen is decreased. An increase in the levels of adenosine produces a metabolic hyperaemia, increasing
blood flow and oxygen delivery. Sympathetic a1 noradrenergic vasoconstriction can occur but this is overcome
by the local metabolic vasodilator influences.

Grey matter has a high oxygen consumption and accounts for approximately 20% of total body oxygen
consumption at rest. As grey matter has very little tolerance to hypoxia, consciousness is lost after a few seconds of ischaemia and thus one of the primary
functions of the cardiovascular system is to maintain
an adequate supply of oxygen to the brain. Autoregulation is crucial and well developed in the cerebral circulation (see page 62), but this eventually fails when
pressure falls below 50 mmHg or exceeds 170 mmHg.
Cerebral vessels are very sensitive to arterial PCO2:
• Hypercapnia causes vasodilatation (Fig. 5.17).
• Hypocapnia causes vasoconstriction.
Reduction in arterial PCO2 through hyperventilation
can lead to cerebral vasoconstriction, and even transient
unconsciousness. This is why people who are hyperventilating are often told to rebreathe air in and out of a paper bag, to prevent development of hypocapnia. Cerebral
vessels do not participate in baroreflex vasoconstriction.
Autoregulation sets the total amount of blood flow
that enters the cerebral circulation but mechanisms
must be in place to ensure that blood is directed to
the metabolically active areas of the brain. This process

is called flow-metabolism coupling and is extremely
precise. The precise mechanism underlying this is not
known but substances involved include Kþ ions, the
neurotransmitter glutamate and products of arachidonic acid metabolism.
In young people, the circle of Willis enables blood
supply to be maintained if one carotid artery is occluded. These anastomoses linking the arteries together
are less effective in the elderly. The presence of a blood–
brain barrier (BBB) tightly controls the neuronal environment allowing lipid-soluble molecules to diffuse
freely, but not diffusion of ionic solutes. Transport of
water is tightly controlled by the BBB. This is a crucial
function, as excessive water within the cerebral interstitium will cause swelling of the brain, and because the
brain is enclosed within a rigid container (the skull) this
increases intracranial pressure.

to be equal, the lower pressures in the pulmonary vessels
must be due to a lower pulmonary vascular resistance
(analogous to total peripheral resistance). These low
pressures, maintain low capillary pressures, preventing
filtration of fluid into the alveolar interstitium.
In the upright position, mean pulmonary arterial
pressure at the apex of the lung is about 3 mmHg, at
the base it is about 21 mmHg, and at the level of the
heart the mean pressure is 15 mmHg. These values are
due to the effect of gravity. At the lung base, high pressure causes the thin-walled vessels to distend and blood
flow to increase, while at the apex, flow only occurs
during systole. The ventilation–perfusion ratio (V/Q)
governs the efficiency of oxygen transfer. In an ideal scenario, the V/Q would be 1, meaning that alveolar ventilation and alveolar perfusion are proportional in all
parts of the lungs. Although ventilation is also greater
at the bases than at the apex, the difference is not as great
as the difference in perfusion (Fig. 5.18). This causes a
V/Q >1 at the apex and a V/Q <1 at the bases. In the
lungs as a whole, the V/Q is approximately 0.8.
One adaptation of the pulmonary circulation that
aims to improve the V/Q is called hypoxic pulmonary
vasoconstriction. In this process, vessels in poorly
ventilated areas of the lung, in which pO2 is low, undergo vasoconstriction to limit blood flow to that
underventilated area. This mechanism helps to optimize ventilation–perfusion ratios. This response to hypoxia is a contrast to that in the systemic circulation in
which hypoxia tends to bring about a vasodilatation.

Cutaneous circulation
The skin has a low metabolic requirement, and its vasculature is primarily involved in the regulation of the
core body temperature. Specific areas of the skin have

Pulmonary circulation
The entire output of the right ventricle enters the pulmonary circulation. A separate bronchial circulation arising
from the descending aorta meets the metabolic needs of
the bronchi and smaller airways. There is a very high
capillary density and a very thin blood–alveolar surface
to maximize gaseous exchange. Gas exchange in the
lung is limited by perfusion because a rise in blood flow
increases the rate of oxygen uptake as it maintains the
concentration gradient for oxygen uptake between the
alveoli and the capillaries.
Pulmonary arteries and arterioles are shorter, have
thinner walls and are more distensible than systemic vessels (they share many characteristics with venous vessels).
This means that pulmonary vascular resistance is very
low and pulmonary arterial pressures are much lower
than systemic blood pressures (22/8 mmHg). Remember, because right and left ventricular cardiac output have

arteriovenous (AV) anastomoses (Fig. 5.19). These exposed areas have a high surface area to volume ratio
and include the fingers, toes, palms, soles of the feet,
lips, nose and ears. The VSM tone in these anastomoses
is controlled by sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerves, the
activity of which is determined by the brainstem. This
sympathetic outflow from the brainstem is influenced
by the temperature-regulating area in the hypothalamus. When temperature is low, sympathetic outflow
to the skin is increased, constricting the AV anastamoses, diverting blood to the internal venous vessels
and decreasing cutaneous perfusion. Skin temperature
is very variable as it is influenced by ambient temperature. It has a direct effect on cutaneous vascular tone:
• Local heating causes vasodilatation, increasing cutaneous blood flow.

5

• Local cooling causes vasoconstriction, decreasing cutaneous blood flow.
Paradoxical cold vasodilatation occurs in the extremities on prolonged exposure to cold. After the initial vasoconstriction, vasodilatation occurs. This is thought to be
because the cold impairs sympathetic vasoconstriction.
The cutaneous circulation is an important target of
baroreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction in response to
a reduction in blood pressure. This constriction is
brought about by sympathetic nerves, circulating catecholamines, ADH and angiotensin II and is responsible
for the cold, pale hands found in patients in shock.
Emotion can produce a hyperaemic response in the
skin (blushing) and the gastric and colonic mucosa.
Compression of the skin for long periods (e.g. when sitting) impairs blood flow. Reactive hyperaemia and the
skin’s high tolerance to hypoxia prevent ischaemic
damage.
In hot weather, cutaneous vasodilatation can reduce
venous return. This can lead to fainting by virtue of decreased cardiac output and cerebral hypoperfusion.
When soldiers stand on a hot day, they must use their
skeletal muscle pumps to maintain venous return from
their legs and prevent this happening.

HINTS AND TIPS
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a condition whereby
exposure of the extremities (fingers, toes, nose) causes
an excessive cutaneous vasoconstriction that impairs
perfusion of the extremities resulting in ischaemia.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the function and importance of baroreceptors and the baroreceptor reflex.
• Describe the central pathways that influence the cardiovascular system.
• Describe the important cardiorespiratory reflexes and their importance.
• Understand the changes that take place during the Valsalva manoeuvre.
• Describe the cardiovascular causes of syncope.
• Understand the cardiovascular changes that occur during dynamic and static exercise.
• Describe the different types of shock and the compensatory changes that take place in response to
haemorrhage.

ARTERIAL BARORECEPTORS
AND THE BAROREFLEX
The baroreceptor reflex plays a key role in the minuteto-minute control of arterial blood pressure. Arterial
baroreceptors are stretch receptors located in the wall
of the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch. They continuously generate impulses, the frequency of which depends on the degree of vessel wall stretch. Increased
stretch (due to increased pressure), also known as increased baroreceptor loading, increases firing rate,
whereas decreased stretch (baroreceptor unloading) decreases the firing rate. The impulses generated by
the baroreceptors are carried to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla by the glossopharyngeal
(carotid sinus) and vagus nerves (aortic arch). In the
NTS, these afferent impulses interact with other central
pathways regulating autonomic nervous system activity.
When blood pressure decreases, the baroreceptors
are unloaded (stretch is reduced) and the firing rate to
the medulla decreases. The effect is to decrease parasympathetic (PNS) and increase sympathetic (SNS) drive.
This results in:
• Increased heart rate and contractility, increasing cardiac output (SNS and PNS).
• Peripheral vasoconstriction, increasing total peripheral resistance (SNS).
• Venoconstriction, decreasing venous pooling and
increasing venous return and preload (SNS).
• Catecholamine secretion (SNS).
• Increased renin secretion and activation of the renin–
angiotensin system, causing vasoconstriction and increasing circulating volume (SNS).

These responses are illustrated in Fig. 6.1.
The effect is to increase cardiac output and total
peripheral resistance, restoring blood pressure to its
normal level. The baroreflex is very rapid and it is
very important in acute hypotension and haemorrhage. The increase in renin secretion will lead to increased angiotensin II and aldosterone production,
which will increase circulating volume. This effect,
however, is much slower than the other four. Increased loading of the baroreceptors has the opposite
effect, decreasing cardiac output and total peripheral
resistance.
The vascular beds that are primarily affected by
baroreceptor-mediated vasoconstriction are those in
the skeletal muscle and the gastrointestinal tract. The
cutaneous circulation is also important if the temperature is neutral. The cerebral and coronary circulations
are largely unaffected by these changes in sympathetic
activity.
The level of blood pressure that the baroreceptors
take as ‘normal’ (the set point) can be reset by central
or peripheral processes:
• Central resetting: in exercise or during ‘fight or flight’
situations, the rise in blood pressure that occurs does
not cause a bradycardia because there are central influences that reset the baroreflex set point and allow
the blood pressure to increase.
• Peripheral resetting: chronic hyper- or hypotension leads to the set point being reset to this new
pressure, thus allowing the baroreflex to operate
in its optimal range. For this reason, the baroreflex
is not very useful for long-term blood pressure
homeostasis.

The sensitivity of the arterial baroreceptors to a
change in blood pressure is decreased by:

nucleus tractus solitarius in the medulla. The afferent inputs are integrated and relayed to other areas in the brain.

• Age: the compliance of the arterial wall falls with age,
which means that the arterial walls require a greater
increase in pressure in order to stretch them.
• Chronic hypertension: arteriosclerosis decreases
arterial compliance.

Hypothalamus

Central pathways
The central pathways that influence the cardiovascular system involve a complex interaction between the medulla,
hypothalamus and cortex.

Medulla
It used to be thought that there was a specific vasomotor
centre in the medulla. Now, it is thought that there are
complex signals between the hypothalamus, cortex and
cerebellum as well as signals within the vasomotor
centre of the medulla:
• The rostral ventrolateral medulla is responsible for
the sympathetic outflow.
• The nucleus ambiguus is responsible for the parasympathetic (vagal) outflow.
Together, these two areas mediate the neural control of
vascular tone and heart rate. Information from baroreceptors and other cardiovascular receptors is received at the

74

The hypothalamus contains four areas of interest:
• Depressor area: this receives input from the NTS and
can produce the baroreflex but is not vital for the
reflex to occur.
• Defence area: this is responsible for the alerting or
‘fight or flight’ response, thus playing a role in governing sympathetic outflow.
• Temperature-regulating area: this controls cutaneous
vascular toneandsweatingto regulatebody temperature.
• ADH-secreting area: this produces antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), which travels through nerve
axons to the posterior pituitary where it is released
into the bloodstream.

CARDIORESPIRATORY
INTERACTIONS
The first cardiorespiratory interaction is described in
Chapter 4. During inspiration, the decrease in intrathoracic pressure increases venous return. This increases
stroke volume by Starling’s law. In addition to this mechanical interaction, there are also neurally mediated
cardiorespiratory interactions.

Cardiorespiratory interactions

Sinus arrhythmia (Fig. 6.2)
Sinus arrhythmia describes the increase in heart rate that
occurs during inspiration and is a normal phenomenon. It is more profound in younger people and tends
to subside with age. There are two mechanisms that underlie sinus arrhythmia:
1. The first is a CNS influence. The motor neurons that
stimulate the inspiratory muscles have an inhibitory
influence on the nucleus ambiguus. This decreases
vagal activity to the heart, increasing heart rate.
2. The second is a reflex mediated process initiated by
pulmonary stretch receptors in the airways. As inspiration proceeds and the chest expands, activity of
these stretch receptors increases. This also has an inhibitory effect on the nucleus ambiguous (via the
vagus nerve), again decreasing vagal drive and
increasing heart rate.
In addition to producing sinus arrhythmia under
resting conditions, these two mechanisms also underpin the increase in heart rate that occurs in any situation
where respiratory rate is increased. Examples include
systemic hypoxia, exercise and stress. The reverse is also
true in that decreased respiratory rate leads to a decrease
in heart rate.

Arterial chemoreceptors
Peripheral chemoreceptors are located in the carotid
and aortic bodies. They are involved in the regulation
of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in arterial blood

and the arterial blood pH. Their fibres travel with afferent baroreceptor fibres in the glossopharyngeal and
vagus nerves. Their activity is increased by increased carbon dioxide, decreased oxygen and reduced pH in the
arterial blood.
The primary cardiovascular reflex caused by increased
stimulation of these chemoreceptors is an increase in
parasympathetic drive to the heart, decreasing heart rate,
and an increase in sympathetic drive to the arterioles,
causing vasoconstriction. This reflex is in place to reduce
oxygen requirements; however, it is only apparent if the
respiratory rate is not able to increase, for example when
a person is paralysed, being artificially ventilated or
when a baby is in the mother’s womb.
HINTS AND TIPS
In the fetus, a decrease in heart rate suggests that the
fetus is hypoxic. It is this chemoreceptor reflex that
underpins this phenomenon.

Under normal circumstances, when respiratory rate
can increase, increased stimulation of the chemoreceptors increases outflow from the inspiratory centre, increasing respiratory rate and tidal volume. As is
described above, this causes an increase in heart rate,
and the greater degree of pulmonary stretch receptor
stimulation that accompanies increased tidal volume
will further augment this response. These responses

Integrated control of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes
are superimposed on the primary cardiovascular reflex
and under normal circumstances, hypoxaemia (reduced
oxygen in the blood) causes a tachycardia. Remember
that hypoxaemia will also cause vasodilatation in
certain vascular beds such as skeletal muscle and the
brain via the local effects of reduced partial pressure
of oxygen in the blood.

Other cardiopulmonary receptors
There are many cardiopulmonary receptors in the heart,
great veins and pulmonary arteries with afferents to the
NTS. There are three other classes of receptor not yet
described, each with differing functions: atrial stretch
receptors, unmyelinated mechanoreceptor fibres and
chemosensitive fibres.

Atrial stretch receptors
These are branched nerve endings located where the
great veins join the atria and are connected to large
myelinated vagal fibres. They are stimulated by atrial
stretch, which is increased when blood volume increases. Stimulation produces a reflex tachycardia (the
Bainbridge reflex) by selectively increasing sympathetic
drive to the sinoatrial node. It also decreases secretion of
antidiuretic hormone promoting water excretion in
order to reduce circulating volume.

Unmyelinated mechanoreceptor fibres
These are present in both atria and in the left ventricle.
Afferent fibres travel in vagal and sympathetic nerves.
Large degrees of distension in the chambers stimulate
these receptors causing a reflex bradycardia and peripheral vasodilatation.

Chemosensitive fibres
These unmyelinated vagal and sympathetic afferents are
chemosensitive. They are stimulated by bradykinin and
other substances released by ischaemic myocardium. It
is thought that the pain of angina and myocardial
infarction is mediated by these fibres. Stimulation
increases respiration as well as causing bradycardia
and peripheral vasodilatation.

COORDINATED
CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSES

Orthostasis
When moving from a supine position to standing
(orthostasis), the effect of gravity causes venous pooling
in any vessels below the heart; thus venous pressures

76

increase and the veins distend. This causes a fall in apparent circulation volume and venous return. Cardiac
filling is reduced and stroke volume and cardiac output
fall. Arterial blood pressure drops, but this hypotension
is only transient as the baroreceptor reflex corrects it
almost immediately. If there is already a degree of
peripheral vasodilatation, due to high temperature for
example, this transient hypotension may be enough
to cause cerebral hypoperfusion and cause the person
to faint.
Upon standing, the baroreceptors decrease their firing rate and cardiopulmonary receptors decrease their
firing rate in response to reduced cardiac blood volume.
This increases sympathetic outflow and decreases parasympathetic drive, resulting in an increased heart rate
(of about 20 bpm) and contractility. Peripheral vasoconstriction increases total peripheral resistance, which
helps restore the blood pressure. Venoconstriction also
plays a role in helping to reverse venous pooling, particularly the splanchnic veins. Capillary filtration in the
legs increases because of the increase in venous pressure,
which may cause a reduction in plasma volume over
time. Reduced activity in the baroreceptors and cardiopulmonary receptors also increases secretion of ADH
and aldosterone (via renin–angiotensin), which promote salt and water retention in order to increase
plasma volume. The overall effect is maintenance of
arterial pressure and, thus, cerebral perfusion.
Failure of this mechanism causes postural hypotension, defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure
of >15 mmHg on standing which may be associated
with symptoms of light-headedness or even collapse.

Valsalva manoeuvre
The Valsalva manoeuvre is a forced expiration against a
closed glottis. This commonly occurs when coughing,
defecating, or lifting heavy weights. It causes an increase
in intrathoracic pressure, which brings about a cardiovascular response that proceeds in four stages (Fig. 6.3).
• Stage 1: the increase in intrathoracic pressure increases
flow of blood from the pulmonary circulation into the
left atrium. This increases left ventricular end-diastolic
volume and stroke volume. There is also compression
of the aorta, increasing blood pressure.
• Stage 2: the high intrathoracic pressure impedes
venous return and the resulting reduction in filling
pressures decreases stroke volume and thus blood
pressure. During this period, there is a baroreceptormediated increase in heart rate.
• Stage 3: when the manoeuvre is released, the compression on the aorta is stopped and left ventricular
filling pressures are reduced temporarily as the pulmonary vessels re-expand. This causes a drop in
blood pressure.

• Stage 4: venous return is restored, increasing cardiac
filling pressures and stroke volume. This increases
blood pressure and a baroreceptor reflex-mediated
bradycardia.
This manoeuvre is a useful test of baroreceptor competence. If the pressure fall in phase 2 continues and
there is no bradycardia in phase 4, then the baroreflex
is interrupted, and the person will be at risk of postural
hypotension.

Diving reflex
The diving reflex occurs when cold water stimulates the
sensory receptors of the trigeminal nerve on the face,
and receptors in the nasopharynx and oropharynx.
The body is expecting a dive into water and a period
of submersion. The response is in place to conserve
the limited oxygen supply available during submersion
and to preferentially divert it to the heart and brain. The
reflex results in three changes:
• Apnoea (no breathing): while apnoeic, the changing
concentrations of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the
blood will stimulate the chemoreceptors, decreasing
heart rate by increasing vagal drive.
• Bradycardia: caused by intense vagal inhibition of the
pacemaker potential, decreases oxygen consumption.
• Peripheral vasoconstriction: occurs in the splanchnic, renal and skeletal muscle vascular beds. The
strong, sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction
overwhelms any metabolic dilatation that may occur
in active muscle and the increase in total peripheral

This reflex can be exploited clinically as a method to
terminate supraventricular arrhythmias. Placing an
icepack on the face or submersing the face in cold
water elicits this response and slows heart rate.

The alerting/defence response
This is the body’s response to a stressful stimulus. This
may be pain, a frightening noise, a stressful situation or
in anticipation of exercise. It is also known as the ‘fight
or flight’ response. The components of the response are
as follows:
• There is an increase in sympathetic outflow and decrease in parasympathetic outflow to the heart. This
increases heart rate and contractility, increasing
cardiac output.
• Increased sympathetic outflow to the gastrointestinal
tract (GIT), kidneys and skin causes vasoconstriction.
• Decreased sympathetic outflow to skeletal muscle
reduces arteriolar tone causing vasodilatation.
• Release of adrenaline/epinephrine from the adrenal
medulla further increases heart rate and contractility
by binding myocardial b1 receptors. It also acts on a1
receptors causing vasoconstriction in the skin and
gut, and b2 receptors in skeletal muscle causing
vasodilatation.
The net result is an increase in heart rate and blood
pressure, and an increase in skeletal muscle blood flow.
It is important to remember that during this response
the baroreceptor reflex is inhibited so the increase in
blood pressure is not corrected. The changes in autonomic activity also cause pupillary dilatation and
piloerection. The degree to which these changes take
place is graded by the intensity of the stimulus and
the intensity of the response. The responses of two different people to the same stimulus may be very
different.

Syncope (fainting)
Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness as a
result of impaired cerebral perfusion. It may be initiated
by orthostasis, severe hypovolaemia, arrhythmia or by
psychological stress (e.g. fear, pain or horror). In psychogenic syncope, there is often a pre-syncope period
of tachycardia, cutaneous vasoconstriction, hyperventilation and sweating, produced by the alerting response
described above. During this period, hyperventilation
causes a reduction in the concentration of carbon

the fingers and around the mouth. This prodrome is followed by the vasovagal episode that produces loss of
consciousness.
A vasovagal episode proceeds as follows:

• Increased blood flow to the working muscle and decreasing blood flow to inactive muscle and other
tissues.
• Maintenance of stable blood pressure.

1. A sudden large increase in vagal outflow causes a
bradycardia.
2. Profound peripheral vasodilatation occurs due to
decreased sympathetic drive.
3. This causes a fall in blood pressure, reducing cerebral
blood flow.
4. If it occurs at all, loss of consciousness results within
seconds.

Dynamic exercise

HINTS AND TIPS
Fits, faints and funny turns are very common
presentations of cardiovascular disease. It is important
to consider a number of pathologies in the nervous,
cardiovascular and respiratory systems before reaching
the diagnosis of a psychological cause. A thorough
history and an open mind will help prevent you from
making mistakes!

The cause of the sudden changes is unknown. In psychogenic fainting, it could be a primitive ‘playing dead’
response. In hypovolaemic syncope and arrhythmia, it
could be triggered by activity of ventricular mechanoreceptors, which are strongly activated by contraction
of the near-empty left ventricle.
A person who has fainted falls to the floor and ends
up in the supine position. This raises the intrathoracic
blood volume and the cardiac filling pressures, and
lowers the head to the same level as the heart. Coupled
with the baroreflex, this then increases cardiac output
and arterial pressure, restoring cerebral perfusion. Consciousness is restored in under 2 minutes. You should
never hold a person who has fainted upright as this prevents the beneficial effects of increasing intrathoracic
blood volume and may maintain cerebral hypoperfusion. Raising the person’s legs will cause a further
increase in venous return and thus cardiac output.

Cardiovascular response
to exercise
During exercise, there are a number of cardiovascular
responses in place to increase blood flow to the active
muscles while maintaining a stable blood pressure.
Initial requirements during exercise are:
• Increased gaseous exchange in the pulmonary
circulation.

78

During dynamic exercise (e.g. walking, running or cycling), there is increased production of vasodilator
metabolites in the active muscles that stimulate a metabolic hyperaemia. This vasodilatation increases delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the active muscle, but
were it to occur in isolation, it would reduce total
peripheral resistance and decrease the blood pressure.
The exercise reflex is superimposed on the locally
mediated functional hyperaemia and is in place to
allow all of the above requirements to be satisfied
simultaneously.
The exercise reflex is stimulated by afferent inputs
from metaboreceptors in active muscle, which increase
their activity in response to metabolites of cellular respiration, and joint receptors activated by joint movement.
These signals travel to the hypothalamic locomotor
area in the brain, which initiates the cardiorespiratory
changes that comprise the exercise reflex. These include:
• Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic outflow to the heart increasing heart rate
and increasing contractility. This increases cardiac
output, increasing pulmonary blood flow and
oxygenation as well as increasing tissue perfusion.
• Increased respiratory rate. This increases oxygenation in the pulmonary vasculature and also further
decreases vagal outflow to the heart, increasing
heart rate.
• Increased sympathetic outflow to the vessels of the
skeletal muscle, GIT, spleen, kidneys and cutaneous
circulation brings about vasoconstriction. The increased sympathetic outflow to the active muscles,
however, is overcome by the local metabolic hyperaemia. The vasoconstriction in the skin persists until
there is an increase in core body temperature, at
which time the cutaneous vessels dilate in order to
regulate the body temperature. Sympathetic venoconstriction (particularly in the spleen) also occurs,
increasing venous return.
• Increased levels of circulating catecholamines cause
selective vasodilatation in skeletal muscle while
constricting other beds. This also increases cardiac
output.
There are also a number of passive changes that occur
during dynamic exercise:
• The skeletal muscle pump decreases venous pressure
in the active muscles, increasing the perfusion pressure of the muscle. The skeletal pump also increases
venous return and thus stroke volume.

Coordinated cardiovascular responses
• In addition to increasing blood flow, the metabolic
vasodilatation increases the proportion of capillary
units that are being perfused, increasing the surface
area available for exchange of metabolic substrates
in the active muscles.

6

contraction is released, and the vessels are no longer
compressed, there is a profound vasodilatation and
blood flow to the muscles increases significantly.

Static exercise

Blood pressure during static and
dynamic exercise (Fig. 6.4)

During static exercise, the prolonged skeletal muscle
contraction compresses the blood vessels within the active muscle, increasing the resistance to flow. This is a
similar idea to that in the coronary arteries when blood
flow occurs during diastole rather than systole when the
vessels are compressed. This effect prevents the increase
in muscle blood flow that is stimulated by local production of metabolites. The vascular smooth muscle in the
arterioles does relax but the extrinsic compression of the
vessels keeps them occluded. In the absence of increased
blood flow to the contracting muscle, the levels of metabolites in the muscle rise further, increasing stimulation of muscle metaboreceptors, bringing about an
exaggerated exercise reflex (as described above) compared with that seen during dynamic exercise. When

During dynamic exercise the mean arterial blood pressure remains fairly stable and may increase slightly.
The increase in cardiac output and sympathetically mediated vasoconstriction stimulated by the exercise reflex
act to increase blood pressure (and do increase systolic
pressure) while the metabolic vasodilatation in active
muscles and the cutaneous vasodilatation in place to
regulate body temperature decrease total peripheral
resistance and decrease diastolic pressure. The increased
systolic and decreased diastolic pressure result in a
relatively small change in mean pressure and a marked
increase in pulse pressure.
During static exercise, the systolic blood pressure increases as a result of the exercise reflex but the compression of vessels in the active muscles prevents the decrease

Integrated control of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes
in total peripheral resistance and in fact increases resistance, increasing diastolic blood pressure. The increases
in both SBP and DBP increase mean arterial pressure
significantly.

Anaerobic exercise
During aerobic exercise, the metabolic vasodilatation in
active muscle combined with the exercise reflex maintains adequate oxygen delivery to the active muscle.
During anaerobic exercise, which is defined as when
the cardiovascular response is inadequate to meet the
demands of the active tissues, carbon dioxide and lactate production are increased. This causes a decrease
in blood pH, which stimulates the arterial chemoreceptors. As described above, increased chemoreceptor stimulation leads to an increase in respiratory rate and tidal
volume, increasing alveolar ventilation. This brings
about an increase in ventilation in excess of that required to maintain oxygen, allowing more carbon dioxide to be blown off, decreasing the arterial PCO2 and
correcting the arterial pH.

SHOCK AND HAEMORRHAGE

Haemorrhage
Haemorrhage describes loss of blood from the vascular
compartment and can occur either externally from an
open wound or internally (into the abdominal or
thoracic compartment, for example). The body has a
number of responses in place in order to initially to compensate for the reduction in circulating volume and eventually to replace that volume. Acute haemorrhage can be
classified according to the amount of blood lost or the
percentage of total blood volume lost. Fig. 6.5 shows this

classification and the changes in physiological parameters
that occur at each stage.
In the absence of compensatory cardiovascular
changes, haemorrhage will reduce circulating volume
and reduce blood pressure by virtue of Starling’s law
decreasing stroke volume. The reduction in blood pressure would be dependent on the amount of blood
lost as that would determine the degree to which ventricular filling (preload) was reduced. In reality, however, changes do take place and these can be divided
into three sets based on the timeframe in which they
occur (Fig. 6.6):

Immediate response (seconds to minutes)
The immediate response is a baroreceptor-mediated response stimulated by the decrease in blood pressure.
The increased sympathetic outflow and decrease in
renal perfusion stimulate the release of renin and thus
production of angiotensin II and ADH. Levels of circulating adrenaline/epinephrine and noradrenaline/norepinephrine also increase. All of these hormones exert
an additional vasoconstrictor effect, supporting the
baroreceptor-mediated response. The decrease in stroke
volume and the increase in total peripheral resistance
may maintain mean blood pressure but is likely to reduce the pulse pressure (remember SV influences SBP
and TPR influences DBP). It is important to remember
that in this immediate response, the changes simply aim
to maintain blood pressure and perfusion of the brain
and the heart; they in no way correct the loss of circulating volume. The intense arteriolar vasoconstriction can
(if severe enough) impair perfusion of peripheral tissues
and cause a metabolic acidosis (due to increased lactate
production). This will inevitably happen if the loss of
circulating volume is not corrected and will stimulate
the arterial chemoreceptors, increasing respiratory rate.

Intermediate response (minutes to hours)
The profound vasoconstriction and venoconstriction
described above decreases the capillary hydrostatic pressure at both the arteriolar and the venous end of the capillaries. This will decrease the capillary hydrostatic

pressure and bring about increased fluid absorption
from the interstitial compartment. This effect can be
augmented by a small increase in plasma osmolality
caused by increased glucose concentration due to adrenaline/epinephrine stimulating hepatic glycolysis, which

81

Integrated control of the cardiovascular system and cardiovascular reflexes
increases capillary oncotic pressure. This movement of
fluid from the interstitium to the vascular compartment
can be described as an autotransfusion. This autotransfusion response is not a compensatory change but
rather acts to correct the loss of circulating volume,
but is unlikely to do so completely.

Long-term response (hours to days)
The activation of the renin–angiotensin system and
increased levels of ADH and aldosterone all stimulate
sodium and water retention in the renal tubules,
increasing plasma volume. Angiotensin II stimulates
thirst, increasing water intake if the patient is able to
do so. Although these responses increase circulating volume (given time), they do so with water, and do not
replace the red blood cells, clotting factors, plasma proteins and other humoral components of blood that
were lost. This causes a dilutional reduction in haemoglobin, which is corrected by increased release of erythropoietin (stimulates red blood cell production in the
bone marrow) from the kidney.
Think about what happens to the blood haemoglobin
(Hb) concentration during haemorrhage and the
subsequent compensatory changes. Initially, when
blood is lost, the Hb concentration will stay the same
(although the total amount is reduced). The
autotransfusion will then decrease the concentration of
Hb by a small degree by diluting it slightly. As plasma
volume is restored, by IV fluids, oral fluids or
reabsorption in the kidneys, Hb will continue to be
diluted, causing the concentration to decrease further.
Erythropoietin production will increase red blood cell
production (and thus Hb concentration) but this effect
is much slower than the volume restoration.

The primary aims in the treatment of haemorrhage
are firstly, to stop the bleeding and secondly, to replace
circulating volume with intravenous fluids as appropriate. It is important to remember that replacement does
not have to be with blood; the key is to restore circulating volume to ensure cardiac output is sufficient to
maintain perfusion of the vital organs.

Shock
Shock is an acute failure of the cardiovascular system
to adequately perfuse the tissues of the body. Shock
can be divided in to four categories depending upon
the causative factor:
• Hypovolaemic shock.
• Cardiogenic shock.

82

• Obstructive shock.
• Septic shock.
Shock (except septic shock, dealt with separately)
causes a characteristic clinical picture, the components
of which can all be predicted with a knowledge of
the compensatory changes that occur in response to a
decrease in cardiac output and blood pressure. They
can include the following:
• Pale, cold, clammy skin caused by cutaneous vasoconstriction in an effort to maintain adequate blood
flow to the vital organs.
• Sweating caused by sympathetic stimulation.
• Rapid, weak pulse caused by compensatory tachycardia and decreased stroke volume.
• Reduced pulse pressure due to reduced stroke volume (reduced SBP) and increased total peripheral
resistance (increased DBP).
• Rapid, shallow breathing as a result of chemoreceptor
stimulation by reduced blood pH from metabolic
acidosis caused by anaerobic cellular respiration
(in the presence of inadequate oxygen delivery).
• Reduced urine output due to renal hypoperfusion
and reduced glomerular filtration.

Hypovolaemic shock
This results from a fall in circulating blood volume
caused by either:
• external fluid loss (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea, haemorrhage), or
• internal fluid loss (e.g. pancreatitis, internal bleeding).

Cardiogenic shock
This is caused by an impairment of cardiac function
such that the heart is unable to maintain adequate cardiac output, i.e. pump failure. It usually has an acute
onset, but it may be a result of worsening heart failure.
Causes include:
• Myocardial infarction.
• Arrhythmia.
• Severe heart failure.

Obstructive shock
In obstructive shock there is a direct obstruction to
blood entering or leaving the heart or great vessels,
for example:
• Cardiac tamponade (discussed in Ch. 8).
• Massive pulmonary embolism: this restricts pulmonary blood flow, preventing blood from reaching the
left side of the heart, impairing left ventricular filling
and limiting preload.

Shock and haemorrhage

Septic shock
Sepsis is caused by toxins (e.g. endotoxin) released from
certain bacteria during infection. This initiates a profound
systemic inflammatory response, with production of
cytokines and inflammatory mediators. This causes a
widespread vasodilatation and an increase in capillary
permeability. Total peripheral resistance falls and leakage
of plasma proteins into the interstitial fluid causes movement of fluid from the vascular compartment into the
interstitium, decreasing circulating volume. This reduces
circulating volume, decreasing venous return and stroke
volume, which, combined with the decrease in total peripheral resistance, significantly decreases blood pressure.
Although the baroreceptor reflex causes a tachycardia
and increases myocardial contractility, increasing cardiac
output, the peripheral vasoconstriction is ineffective. The
patient will have a tachycardia but warm skin and a low
blood pressure due to the widespread vasodilatation.
Treatment is with fluid replacement, antibiotics and, if severe, can include noradrenaline/norepinephrine to bring
about vasoconstriction and restore blood pressure.

Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a rapidly developing, life threatening,
severe, type I hypersensitivity reaction. It is an immediate IgE-mediated immune response to an antigen in the

6

body to which the patient is ‘allergic’. It leads to
rapid circulatory collapse (shock), dyspnoea, and potentially death. The IgE immune response consists of
the activation of basophils and mast cells, leading to
release of histamine and other factors. Prostaglandins,
leukotrienes, thromboxane, and platelet activation factors are also synthesized and released. The results are as
follows:
• Generalized peripheral vasodilatation.
• Increased vascular permeability causes leakage of
plasma protein into the interstitium increasing tissue oncotic pressure, causing movement of fluid into
the interstitium and reducing plasma volume.
• Bronchial smooth muscle constriction, restricting
ventilation.
• Oral, laryngeal, and pharyngeal oedema, which may
compromise the airway.
• Urticaria and flushing.
The most important step in the treatment of anaphylaxis is administration of intramuscular adrenaline/
epinephrine. This reverses the bronchoconstriction
by acting on b2 receptors and increases blood pressure by increasing cardiac output via action on b1
receptors and vasoconstriction via action on a1 receptors. Administration of antihistamine (e.g. chlorphenamine) and IV hydrocortisone dampen the immune
response.

ARTERIOSCLEROSIS AND
ATHEROSCLEROSIS

Arteriosclerosis
Arteriosclerosis is a term used to describe thickening
and loss of elasticity of the arteries. Vessel thickening
reduces lumen diameter, which may compromise organ perfusion. The loss of elasticity increases the likelihood of vessel rupture if exposed to increased
mechanical stress. There are two important types of
arteriosclerosis:
• Arteriolosclerosis: thickening of the wall in small arteries and arterioles, causes a reduction in lumen
size. Often related to systemic hypertension and
diabetes mellitus.
• Atherosclerosis: see below.

Atherosclerosis
Atherosclerosis is a progressive, inflammatory disease of
large and medium sized arteries. It is characterized by
focal accumulation of lipid in the vessel intima with
an associated inflammatory and smooth muscle infiltrate. It is thought that atherosclerosis is present to some
degree in all adults, and the consequences of atherosclerosis, which include ischaemic heart disease, peripheral
vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease, are estimated to account for around 50% of deaths in Western
societies.

Risk factors
Risk factors for atherosclerosis, and therefore risk factors
for its associated conditions, can be broken down into
‘modifiable’ and ‘non-modifiable’, as follows:

Non-modifiable
• Age: increased age increases the number and severity
of lesions.
• Sex: men are affected to a much greater extent than
women, until the menopause when the incidence in
women increases. This is thought to be due to the
protective effects of oestrogens before menopause.
• Genetic predisposition: a family history of atherosclerotic disease increases an individual’s risk significantly.

Modifiable
•
•
•
•

Smoking.
Hypertension.
Diabetes mellitus.
Hyperlipidaemia: high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol promote atherosclerosis
while high-density lipoprotein (HDL) appears to
be protective.

Other, less important factors involved in the development of atherosclerosis include a sedentary lifestyle,
a diet high in saturated fat, and obesity.

Pathogenesis
The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is often described
by the response to injury hypothesis. This states that
chronic damage to the vascular endothelium and the

85

Atherosclerosis and ischaemic heart disease
associated endothelial dysfunction are the key events
in initiating the process. The steps involved in development of atherosclerosis are shown in Fig. 7.1 and
include:
1. Endothelial dysfunction: chronic endothelial cell
injury can occur as a result of cigarette smoking
and high levels of cholesterol (particularly LDL),
leading to metabolic dysfunction and structural
changes. Damage activates endothelial cells, upregulating inflammatory adhesion molecules (e.g.
ICAM-1) and promoting monocyte and platelet
adhesion. This upregulation is also caused by altered
gene expression at sites where the pattern of blood
flow is altered, such as bends and bifurcation in vessels. Injury increases permeability to lipids and LDL,
allowing their accumulation in the intima.
2. Formation of a fatty streak: monocytes adhere to
the endothelium, migrate into the intima and differentiate into macrophages. Local oxidation of LDL
is chemotactic for macrophages (attracts macrophages) and once in the intima, macrophages take
up the oxidized LDL and become foam cells. Platelets adhere to activated endothelial cells or areas
of denuded matrix and become activated. Activated
platelets, activated endothelial cells and macrophages
release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulating smooth muscle cell migration from the media
to the intima.
3. Development of lipid plaque: smooth muscle proliferation and an increase in extracellular matrix occur in the intima. Additional cytokines and growth
factors produced by activated macrophages and
platelets promote additional monocyte and smooth
muscle infiltration. Lipid may also be released from
dying foam cells, contributing to extracellular free
lipid pools.
4. Advanced plaques: an advanced atherosclerotic plaque consists of a lipid rich ‘core’ and a fibrous ‘cap’.
The core of the lesion (which can become necrotic)
consists of free lipid, macrophages, smooth muscle
cells and cellular debris. The fibrous cap is composed primarily of collagen and lies over the core,
beneath the endothelium.
A stable advanced atherosclerotic plaque, such as
that depicted above, is likely to remain asymptomatic
for years. Initially, as the plaque expands it causes
remodelling of the media allowing the vessel to increase
its diameter, accommodating the plaque without
compromising the vessel lumen. This is the principle
of Glagovian remodelling and the degree to which it occurs varies greatly. In the absence of this remodelling the
plaque will grow, protruding into the lumen and progressively decreasing lumen size. It may only become
apparent when the luminal diameter is not sufficient
to allow adequate organ perfusion.

atherosclerotic plaque (LDL, low-density lipoprotein).

Lipids and the cardiovascular system
The stability of the plaque is dependent on the
strength and thickness of the fibrous cap, which relies
on the balance between inflammation and repair. If this
balance is disturbed and inflammation predominates,
the cap may become thinner, less stable and may
rupture. Atherosclerotic plaques also predispose to
aneurysm formation (see Ch. 9).

LIPIDS AND THE
CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM

Lipid transport and metabolism
The insolubility of lipids in plasma means a special
transport mechanism is required. This is provided by
lipid–protein complexes known as lipoproteins. The
apolipoproteins (protein component of lipoproteins)
also act as receptors for cell surface proteins, which
determine the destination of different lipoproteins.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the main lipoprotein
involved in the transport of cholesterol. Fig. 7.2 shows
the main transport pathways for lipids from the diet
(exogenous) and for lipids from the body’s stores
(endogenous).
It is thought that apolipoprotein A is a prothrombotic
lipoprotein that is particularly involved in coronary artery disease, while high levels of high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) are protective. The classification of lipoproteins
is outlined in Fig. 7.3.

Hyperlipidaemia
Hyperlipidaemia can be classified as hypertriglyceridaemia (raised triglycerides), hypercholesterolaemia
(raised cholesterol), or hyperlipoproteinaemia (raised
lipoproteins). In reality there may be combinations of
each. Although these classifications are useful, they
must be used with care because although hypercholesterolaemia is a risk factor for development of atherosclerosis, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the
balance between LDL (damaging) and HDL (protective)
may be more important than the absolute levels. As a
result, some people prefer the term ‘dyslipidaemia’, as
it refers to derangement of lipids rather than simply
an increase.
HINTS AND TIPS
In patients with high cholesterol, lipids can be
deposited in the subcutaneous tissues. Common sites
include the skin around the eyes (xanthelasmas) and in
tendons (tendon xanthomatas).

7

Treatment of hyperlipidaemia
Hyperlipidaemia can be treated with lifestyle interventions such as dietary changes or pharmacologically with
drugs. Lifestyle interventions should include reduction of
calorific intake, saturated fats and dietary cholesterol. Reduction of alcohol consumption and regular exercise are
also beneficial. Supplements of omega-3 fats (present in
fish oils) can be given as these may increase HDL levels.
There is no universally accepted level at which drug
therapy should be started and the decision is usually
based on assessment of overall risk of cardiovascular
disease. NICE recommends treatment in primary prevention for anyone with a 10-year risk of greater than
20%. However, if cholesterol levels exceed 6 mmol/L,
it will usually prompt treatment as a pathological
disease in itself regardless of overall risk.

Drugs used to lower cholesterol
Statins (e.g. simvastatin, atorvastatin)
Statins are b-hydroxy-b-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. HMG CoA reductase
is the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. When
inhibited, the liver compensates for the decreased cholesterol synthesis by increasing LDL receptor expression,
which decreases plasma levels of LDL. Statins are the
first line drug for high cholesterol, can reduce cholesterol by more than 50%, and have been repeatedly
demonstrated to reduce mortality in both primary
and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.
In addition to their cholesterol lowering effects, statins
have an anti-atherosclerotic effect, reducing the inflammatory activity within atherosclerotic plaques (and thus
strengthening the fibrous cap) and reducing the size of
plaques. The main side-effects include reversible myositis
and disturbed liver function tests.

Bile acid binding resins (e.g. colestipol
and colestyramine)
Cholesterol is the initial substrate for synthesis of
bile acids. These drugs bind bile acids in the intestine,
forming insoluble complexes, increasing excretion of
bile acids. In order to replenish bile acid levels, cholesterol is utilized for bile acid synthesis, thus reducing
plasma cholesterol levels. This removes LDL cholesterol
from circulation; however, these drugs can aggravate
hypertriglyceridaemia.

Ezetimibe
This is a novel, orally acting selective inhibitor of cholesterol absorption. It may be used alone, or in combination with a statin in refractory cases. Despite its efficacy
in lowering cholesterol (although only by about 10%),
its benefit in terms of reducing mortality has been
questioned.

The main risk factors for ischaemic heart disease are
the same as those for the development of atherosclerosis
and are summarized again in Fig. 7.4.

HINTS AND TIPS

Drugs used to lower triglyceride levels

Knowledge of the risk factors for ischaemic heart
disease is absolutely essential, both for examinations
and for clinical practice.

Niacin
Niacin inhibits breakdown of fat in adipose tissue. This
decreases plasma levels of free fatty acid, decreasing
very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis by the
liver and, as a result, levels of intermediate-density
lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL.

Fibrates
Gemfibrozil reduces lipolysis of triglycerides in adipose
tissue, leading to decreased hepatic production of VLDL.
Bezafibrate causes decreased VLDL and decreased triglycerides, but it may increase LDL. Fibrates are used
mainly in familial hyperlipidaemia. Gemfibrozil is the
better drug as it does not increase LDL.

ISCHAEMIC HEART DISEASE
Ischaemic heart disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the leading cause of death in the Western world
and a great burden on the healthcare system. It is primarily a result of atherosclerosis in the coronary arteries.
Myocardial ischaemia occurs when the oxygen demand of the myocardium is greater than the supply of
oxygen. Myocardial ischaemia can be caused by any
or a combination of the following:
• Reduced blood supply to the myocardium, e.g. narrowing of coronary arteries.
• Increased demand of the myocardium, e.g. cardiac
hypertrophy.
• Decreased oxygen content of blood reaching the
myocardium, e.g. severe anaemia.

Other, less common causes of myocardial ischaemia
include the following:
• Coronary vasospasm: Prinzmetal’s angina.
• Emboli as a result of infective endocarditis, or other
causes such as thromboembolism.
• Vasculitis (e.g. polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki’s
syndrome).
• Shock: inadequate perfusion pressure.
• Severe aortic valvular disease: reduced coronary
artery perfusion.
• Severe anaemia: reduced blood oxygen capacity.

Risk prediction and primary
prevention
Primary prevention aims to reduce a person’s risk of developing ischaemic heart disease in the future. It involves treating seemingly healthy individuals, many of
whom may never have developed the disease anyway.
In order to guide doctors as to who will benefit most
from primary prevention measures, various risk stratification models have been developed that estimate a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular risk. The most
widely used of these is the Framingham risk prediction
chart and a sample of this is shown in Fig. 7.5. For those
who are at high risk, lifestyle interventions and pharmacological measures are directed at reducing risk factors
such as hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia (with a
statin) and obesity.

many of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and can be used to guide doctors when making decisions about medications
for primary prevention.

Classification
The classification of ischaemic heart disease has changed in recent years and includes:
• Stable angina.
• Acute coronary syndromes (ACS): these include unstable angina and myocardial infarction, with or without
ST elevation (STEMI and NSTEMI, respectively).

Stable angina
Angina is largely a clinical diagnosis, based on a history
of ‘heavy’ or ‘gripping’ chest pain, typically in the centre,
which may radiate to the arm, neck or jaw. Pain is usually provoked by physical exertion and subsides after a
few minutes of rest. It can be worse on cold days or after
a meal and is often accompanied by breathlessness. In
most cases, angina is due to a stable atherosclerotic plaque in one or more coronary arteries causing a narrowing or stenosis (Fig. 7.6), but can result from coronary
artery spasm (Prinzmetal’s angina). On exertion, when
myocardial oxygen demand is increased, the stenosed
vessel prevents the necessary increase in blood flow,
causing ischaemia and chest pain. At rest, when demand
is lower, blood supply is adequate and symptoms subside. As a rule of thumb, it is said that the stenosis
should reduce cross-sectional area of the vessel lumen
by 70% in order to produce symptoms.

90

The following investigations can be performed in a
patient with angina:
• Resting electrocardiogram (ECG): usually normal
between episodes. During an attack, there may be
ST segment depression and inverted T waves.
• Exercise ECG: useful for confirming the diagnosis
and determining the extent of coronary artery disease. Patients have a continuous ECG trace recorded
while undergoing a standardized exercise protocol
on a treadmill (the Bruce protocol) until myocardial
ischaemia is provoked, determined by ST depression
>1 mm or chest pain.
• Myocardial perfusion scanning: this relies on the
principle that when the myocardium is stressed
(either by exercise or pharmacologically with a
positive inotrope such as dobutamine), uptake
of a radionucleotide tracer will be increased in
line with the increase in perfusion. As a result,
areas of myocardium which have impaired perfusion (due to stenosis in the arteries supplying them)
will not exhibit increased uptake in response to
stress.
• CT coronary angiography: improvements in the spatial resolution of CT scanning have allowed it to be
used in the assessment of coronary artery disease. It
can detect stenosis in the coronary arteries and also
the degree of calcification within the walls of the vessels, which has been shown to correlate with the degree of stenosis.

• Coronary angiography (Figs 7.7 and 7.8): visualization of the patency of the coronary vasculature
using intravenous contrast to assess the location
and extent of coronary artery stenosis. The procedure is performed by passing a catheter through
the aorta via the femoral or radial artery to the
origins of the coronary arteries and injecting a
contrast agent.

Treatment
Pharmacological treatment of angina
Treatment strategies for angina aim to restore the balance between myocardial supply and demand by increasing blood supply, and therefore oxygen supply,
to the ischaemic myocardium and decreasing the
oxygen demand of the myocardium (Fig. 7.9).
Increasing blood supply can be achieved by:
• Decreasing heart rate: coronary artery flow occurs
primarily during diastole. Decreasing heart rate prolongs diastole allowing more time for perfusion of
the myocardium.
• Dilating coronary arteries: this may be of more
benefit in angina due to coronary artery spasm as
stenosed coronary arteries are likely to be already
maximally vasodilated by endogenous metabolic
vasodilators (such as adenosine).

Organic nitrates
Organic nitrates, e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN), relax
vascular smooth muscle by producing nitric oxide
(NO), which increases levels of cGMP and brings about
dilatation. Nitrates mediate their effects by:
• Dilatation of venous capacitance vessels (predominant effect): this causes pooling of blood in the
venous system which:
• Reduces the preload of the heart and according to
Starling’s law, decreased preload leads to decreased
cardiac output, decreasing myocardial work.
• Decreases arterial blood pressure, thus reducing
the afterload.
• Dilatation of coronary arteries: nitrates have a
direct vasodilatory effect on coronary arteries at high
doses, increasing myocardial perfusion.
GTN is usually administered sublingually to avoid
first pass metabolism and its effects last around 30 minutes. Tolerance develops to the effects of GTN if used
regularly over 2 or 3 days and patients should be aware
of this. It can be used to relieve an attack or can be taken
prophylactically to prevent an attack. Longer acting nitrates include isosorbide mononitrate and isosorbide
dinitrate. The side-effects of nitrates include postural
hypotension and sometimes a reflex tachycardia as
the body attempts to maintain blood pressure. Headaches and facial flushing can also occur.

Calcium channel blockers (e.g. nifedipine,

These drugs block L-type Ca2þ channels and have effects

• Blockade of myocardial L-type Ca2þ channels (greatest with non-dyhydropyridine agents, verapamil and

• Decreases heart rate by decreasing the slope of the
pacemaker potential and action potential upstroke
in the sinoatrial node (SAN) and increasing delay
at the atrioventricular node (AVN). Remember
these drugs are also class IV antiarrhythmics.
• Decreases the Ca2þ influx during the plateau of
the ventricular action potential, therefore decreasing contractility and myocardial oxygen demand.
• Blockade of L-type Ca2þ channels in vascular smooth
muscle (greatest with dihydropyridine agents such as
nifedipine and amlodipine):

• Direct dilatation of coronary arteries increases
myocardial perfusion.
• Peripheral vasodilatation decreases arterial blood
pressure, decreasing afterload and myocardial
work.
Owing to their negative chronotropic effects, care must
be taken when using verapamil or diltiazem in combination with beta-blockers, as profound bradycardia may result. Nifedipine, however, may be beneficially combined
with beta-blockers to minimize reflex tachycardia.

therapies. (Courtesy of Newby DE, Grubb NR. Cardiology: an illustrated colour text. Edinburgh: Elsevier, 2005.)

Beta-blockers (e.g. atenolol, metoprolol)
These drugs block sympathetic stimulation of the heart,
leading to:
• Decreased contractility (negative inotropic effect)
and, therefore, decreased oxygen demand.
• Decreased heart rate and, therefore, decreased oxygen demand and prolonged diastole, increasing
duration of coronary blood flow.
They should be used with care in patients with
asthma as blockade of bronchial b2 receptors causes
bronchoconstriction and may precipitate an attack.
Care should be taken in patients with bradyarrhythmias
and in patients with peripheral arterial disease, as they
will reduce blood pressure and may impair perfusion of
the peripheries.
HINTS AND TIPS
Many drugs of the same class have similar suffixes
to their names. For example, most beta-blockers end in
‘-olol’ (e.g. propranolol, atenolol, metoprolol). This is
useful when identifying the class of an unfamiliar drug.

Nicorandil
Nicorandil is a potassium channel agonist that affects
ATP-dependent Kþ channels in vascular smooth muscle,
causing hyperpolarization and vasodilatation. It affects
both arteries and veins, thus reducing both preload and

afterload. Nicorandil also has a nitrate component, in
that it is a nitric oxide donor. Nicorandil is not used first
line but is an alternative to nitrates when tolerance
occurs and if beta-blockers and Ca2þ antagonists are
contraindicated.

Ivabradine
A new agent that inhibits the pacemaker potential in the
SA node, slowing the rate of depolarization and reducing heart rate.

Interventional treatments
Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)
PCI describes a number of procedures to relieve stenosis
in the coronary arteries performed by insertion of a
catheter, usually via the femoral artery. Percutaneous
treatment options for coronary artery disease include:
• Balloon angioplasty: an inflatable balloon is passed
into the affected coronary artery and inflated within
the stenosis, compressing it and expanding the lumen.
• Metal stents: a metallic stent is positioned within the
stenosis, expanding the vessel walls and restoring vessel patency. Stents decrease the need for reintervention when compared with balloon angioplasty but
the stents put pressure on the wall of the artery
causing endothelial damage and stimulating a proliferative response. This proliferative response causes
scar tissue deposition that can cause narrowing
of the expanded lumen. Attempts to overcome this

93

Atherosclerosis and ischaemic heart disease
have led to the use of stents coated with immunosuppressive agents to prevent re-stenosis.
Damage to the endothelium by placement of the
stent is highly thrombogenic and blood clots may form,
occluding the artery. This risk of thrombosis means patients require antiplatelet medication such as clopidogrel, aspirin or the newer agents such as GPIIb/IIIa
antagonists (see p. 99).

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
This procedure uses autologous (the patient’s own)
veins and/or arteries to bypass stenosis in coronary arteries. The vessels commonly used include the internal
mammary artery, which is directly anastamosed distal
to the stenosis, the radial artery and the long saphenous
vein which are anastamosed proximally to the aorta and
distally beyond the stenosis. CABG is usually indicated
in patients with left main stem disease or triple-vessel
disease, while patients with single- or double-vessel
disease are usually treated with PCI. The procedure is
traditionally performed with the patients on a cardiopulmonary bypass machine. In recent years, however,
some surgeons have been performing this procedure
without putting patients on bypass (so called ‘off pump’
CABG). Generally, although CABG is associated with
higher short-term mortality and morbidity, the need
for subsequent reintervention is less than with PCI.

Acute coronary syndromes
Angina is in effect the chronic manifestation of coronary
artery disease and results from stable atherosclerotic plaques that cause stenosis of coronary arteries. The acute
manifestations of coronary artery disease are termed
acute coronary syndromes and occur when the fibrous
cap of an atherosclerotic plaque becomes unstable
and one of the following occurs (Fig. 7.6):
• Plaque erosion: this occurs when there is damage to
the endothelium overlying the plaque. This exposes
the prothrombotic subendothelial connective tissue,
causing platelet adhesion and formation of a thrombus on the surface of the plaque, which can occlude
the lumen. The sequence of events in thrombus formation is shown in Fig. 7.10.
• Plaque rupture/fissure: this occurs in advanced plaque when deep fissures form in the plaque allowing
blood to flow into the plaque. A thrombus then
forms within the plaque causing it to expand and
occlude the vessel lumen.
Clinically, these acute plaque changes can manifest
as one of three acute coronary syndromes, in order of
increasing severity:
• Unstable angina (UA): angina of increasing severity
or at rest without evidence of myocardial necrosis.

94

• NSTEMI: new onset chest pain with biochemical
evidence of myocardial necrosis but no ST segment
elevation on ECG.
• STEMI: acute chest pain, often associated with autonomic symptoms such as sweating or vomiting, with
biochemical evidence of myocardial necrosis and ST
segment elevation or new left bundle branch block
on ECG. This is usually associated with complete
occlusion of the coronary artery and significant
myocardial necrosis.
Myocardial infarction occurs when myocytes die
(necrosis) due to myocardial ischaemia. Irreversible
damage occurs from between 20–40 minutes after vessel
occlusion. The evolution of infarcted myocardium is
depicted in Fig. 7.11. The area of myocardium affected
depends on the vessel that is involved and the changes
on the ECG allow assessment of the area involved. The
area of infarction following occlusion of each of the
major vessels is shown in Fig. 7.12.

Biochemical markers of myocyte necrosis
Myocyte necrosis can be detected biochemically by measuring levels of cardiac enzymes (creatine kinase and lactate
dehydrogenase) and cardiac troponin T and I. A rise in
these markers suggests myocardial necrosis and therefore
infarction. In NSTEMI, there can be an increase in these
markers but they are usually significantly elevated in
STEMI. The timing and duration of the rise of each of these
markers after myocardial infarction is depicted in Fig. 7.13.
Myocardial necrosis is not the only cause of a raised
troponin. Troponin can be raised owing to:
• Pulmonary embolism.
• Sepsis.
• Renal failure.
• Arrhythmia.

Investigations
• ECG: in UA/NSTEMI, ST segment depression and T
wave inversion (similar to during an attack of angina) may be present. Be aware that in these, the
ECG may be completely normal. In STEMI, ST elevation or new left bundle branch block must be present
to make the diagnosis. Fig. 7.14 shows ST segment
elevation and the subsequent changes seen on
ECG in the days/weeks following a STEMI.
• Cardiac enzymes.

Management
Immediate management of all patients with ACS should
be administration of analgesia (usually morphine),
aspirin, clopidogrel and a beta-blocker (explained

and aggregation of platelets, reducing the likelihood

HINTS AND TIPS
When thinking about antiplatelet agents, consider at
which stage of the platelet thrombus formation they
act. Both aspirin and clopidogrel are given to patients
with ACS because they inhibit the process of platelet
aggregation at two points, and thus have a greater
effect than one of the drugs alone.

involved in the synthesis of the potent platelet activator
thromboxane A2 (TXA2) from arachidonic acid. COX
is also involved in the synthesis of prostacyclin
(PGI2), which exerts inhibitory effects on platelet function. PGI2 synthesis is also blocked by aspirin, but the
endothelial cells, which produce mainly PGI2, are able
to produce more COX enzyme (this cannot occur in
platelets as they have no nucleus), leading to the balance shifting towards production of the antiplatelet
PGI2. Side-effects of aspirin include an increased risk
of bleeding due to inhibited platelet function and
it can cause gastric irritation leading to stomach ulcers.
Aspirin can also be used in primary and secondary
prevention of coronary artery disease by preventing
thrombosis.

Clopidogrel is a thienopyridine derivative and is given
to all patients with ACS. The mechanism of action of
clopidogrel is irreversible blockade of the adenosine
diphosphate (ADP) receptor on platelet cell membranes. This receptor is named P2Y12 and is important
in platelet aggregation. The blockade of this receptor
inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking activation of
the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa pathway. New agents such
as ticagrelor inhibit the same receptor but do so
reversibly.

All patients with UA or NSTEMI should receive low molecular weight heparin by subcutaneous injection. This

Beta-blockers
Administration of beta-blockers decreases heart rate and
myocardial work. They have been repeatedly demonstrated to be beneficial in patients following ACS and
should be continued long term.

97

Atherosclerosis and ischaemic heart disease
Thrombolytic therapy
Thrombolytic (fibrinolytic) therapy is used to break
down the thrombi that cause myocardial infarction
and allow reperfusion of the affected area. These agents
achieve this by converting plasmin to the fibrinolytic
enzyme plasminogen, which breaks down the fibrin
mesh that binds a thrombus together. They are only
used in STEMI when primary PCI is not available and
must be administered by a senior doctor after careful assessment for the presence of contraindications. The administration of thrombolytic agents should be followed
by an infusion of heparin for 48 h to prevent recurrent
thrombus formation and ischaemic events.
Thrombolytic agents include:
• Tissue plasminogen activators (TPA), e.g. tenecteplase, reteplase: these are the primary agents of
choice for thrombolysis.
• Streptokinase: rarely used in clinical practice now. It
binds and activates plasminogen to form plasmin,
causing fibrinolysis. Plasmin also lyses fibrinogen
and prothrombin (anticoagulant effect). Streptokinase cannot be used repeatedly as antibodies are
generated which may induce anaphylaxis on subsequent exposure.

Indications for thrombolysis:
• Typical history of ischaemic cardiac chest pain less
than 12 h duration
AND
• 1 mm ST segment elevation in at least two adjacent
limb leads on ECG, OR
• 2 mm ST segment elevation in at least two adjacent
chest leads on ECG, OR
• New onset left bundle branch block.

98

Important contraindications to thrombolysis:
• Trauma with risk of haemorrhage.
• Recent surgery.
• Suspected aortic dissection.
• Pregnancy.
• Recent stroke (within 6 months).
• Active bleeding.

Primary PCI
Most centres now use angioplasty or stenting to relieve
the blockage and allow reperfusion of the myocardium.
Primary PCI describes the situation when PCI is the initial definitive treatment and thrombolytic agents have
not been administered. When thrombolysis has been
unsuccessful and PCI is performed this is called rescue
PCI. When the facilities to perform primary PCI are
available, it is preferred to thrombolysis because of
the risk of significant bleeding with thrombolysis.

Complications
Sudden death (within 6 h of symptom onset) occurs in
25% of patients following STEMI, usually as a result of
arrhythmia. In those who survive this initial period, MI
can lead to a number of acute and chronic complications. The major ones include:
• Heart failure: infarcted myocardium is unable to
contract effectively.
• Arrhythmia.
• Myocardial rupture: this can be either the free wall of a
ventricle or the interventricular septum and can be
rapidly fatal without emergency surgical intervention.
• Mitral regurgitation: owing to infarction and subsequent rupture of the papillary muscles.
• Pericarditis.

Heart failure (cardiac failure) is the clinical syndrome
that arises when the heart is no longer able to maintain
sufficient tissue perfusion to meet the metabolic demands of the body’s tissues, despite normal filling pressures. Heart failure is a serious condition that carries a
very poor prognosis: 20–30% of patients will die within
1 year and 60% will be dead within 5 years. This is a
worse prognosis than many cancers.
In most patients with heart failure, it occurs as a result of decreased stroke volume due to impaired systolic
function (contractility) of the left ventricle. The ejection
fraction is usually reduced (<50%) and it may be referred to as low output heart failure or heart failure with
reduced ejection fraction. In this situation, the reduction in contractility means the Starling curve is shifted
downwards (Fig. 8.1) such that stroke volume is
reduced for any given end-diastolic pressure (EDP).
Low output heart failure can also be caused by diastolic dysfunction in situations where ventricular filling
is impaired. This limits the end-diastolic volume (EDV)
and thus stroke volume and cardiac output. In diastolic
dysfunction, ventricular compliance is usually decreased and the relationship between EDV and EDP becomes non-linear. As a result, the Starling curve is no
longer valid. The relationship between EDV and stroke
volume, however, is still valid. In this situation, EDV is
restricted, restricting stroke volume, but the ejection
fraction is preserved. This is sometimes referred to as
heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.
The final situation that can bring about heart failure
is when the metabolic demands of the body are

persistently increased and the heart is unable to maintain sufficient cardiac output. This is called high output
heart failure and can occur in severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis and sepsis. It is unusual if the heart is structurally and functionally normal but can precipitate heart
failure in a structurally abnormal or diseased heart.

Causes of heart failure
Conditions that lead to heart failure can be broadly
divided into:

1. Those that damage cardiac muscle itself
• Ischaemic heart disease: this is somewhat of a misnomer because it is actually infarction that is more
likely to cause heart failure. An infarcted segment

of ventricle is unable to contract effectively, decreasing systolic function.
• Cardiomyopathy: whether it causes impaired systolic or diastolic dysfunction, cardiomyopathy can
cause heart failure. Cardiomyopathy is discussed
further below.
• Myocarditis: depending on the cause and clinical
course, myocarditis can cause acute heart failure or
heart failure some time after the myocarditis has
resolved.

2. Those that demand extra work
of the heart

caused by recurrent pulmonary emboli, primary pulmonary hypertension or any respiratory disease in
which there is persistent widespread hypoxic pulmonary vascoconstriction such as chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD). All of these conditions
increase pulmonary vascular resistance causing pressure and volume overload of the right ventricle.
Decreased right ventricular cardiac output limits
left ventricular preload and thus left ventricular stroke
volume which can bring about the same responses as
those that occur when the left ventricle is primarily
affected.
HINTS AND TIPS

• Hypertension: chronically increased afterload leads
to compensatory left ventricular hypertrophy. This
impairs diastolic filling due to decreased ventricular
compliance and increases the myocardial oxygen
demand.
• Valvular heart disease: can cause either pressure
overload (e.g. aortic stenosis) or volume overload
(e.g. aortic regurgitation or mitral regurgitation) in
the left ventricle decreasing efficiency.
• Severe anaemia, thyrotoxicosis and arteriovenous
fistulas all place extra demands on the heart.
These processes most commonly affect the left ventricle, but isolated right ventricular failure can occur in
some circumstances. Remember that the most common
cause of right ventricular failure is left ventricular failure. Causes of isolated right ventricular failure include:
• Right ventricular myocardial infarction.
• Cor pulmonale: this is right ventricular failure due to
disease of the pulmonary vasculature. It can be

Remember, ‘heart failure’ is NOT a diagnosis. It is
always necessary to identify the underlying pathology
responsible, so that a targeted treatment regimen can
be employed.

Compensatory mechanisms
When stroke volume and cardiac output are reduced
due to either systolic or diastolic dysfunction there are
a number of compensatory changes (Fig. 8.2) that occur
to restore cardiac output and maintain tissue perfusion.
These changes are successful initially (adaptive). The decrease in stroke volume reduces arterial blood pressure
causing unloading of the arterial baroreceptors. This
brings about a number of changes including:
• Increased sympathetic and decreased parasympathetic outflow to the heart increasing heart rate

and increasing contractility (the degree to which
this can occur may be limited in a diseased
myocardium).
• Increased sympathetic outflow to the peripheral vasculature causing vasoconstriction to increase total
peripheral resistance and venoconstriction, limiting
venous pooling and increasing venous return.
• Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) secretion is increased
from the posterior pituitary increasing water reabsorption in the renal collecting ducts.
• Decreased renal blood flow and increased sympathetic outflow to the kidneys increases release of
renin. This increases angiotensin II (and thus aldosterone) levels causing further peripheral vasoconstriction and promoting salt and water retention in
the kidneys.
These changes increase circulating volume and cardiac filling pressures, which increases stroke volume
by virtue of Starling’s law and increases heart rate and
total peripheral resistance (TPR), which together maintain arterial blood pressure and tissue perfusion. In the
early stages, these changes are able to compensate for
the impaired cardiac function and clinical manifestations of heart failure may be minimal.

The vicious cycle of heart failure
As systolic dysfunction progresses and these compensatory mechanisms persist and intensify they become
maladaptive, accelerate disease progression and bring
about the clinical syndrome of heart failure (Fig. 8.3):
• Persistent activation of the renin–angiotensin system and ADH release causes further fluid retention.
Initially in place to increase filling pressures to

8

maximize stroke volume, filling pressures become
excessive and stroke volume decreases due to overstretching of the myocytes. This moves the heart
onto the downward part of the Starling curve.
The increased filling pressures and ventricular pressures will cause congestion in the pulmonary
circulation causing alveolar oedema (due to left ventricular (LV) backpressure) and in the systemic veins
causing peripheral oedema (due to right ventricular
(RV) backpressure).
These excessive filling pressures cause dilatation of
the ventricular walls. As the ventricles distend, the
afterload increases according to Laplace’s law. As this
dilatation progresses, it can also cause disruption of
the atrioventricular (mitral and tricuspid) valve annulus and cause valvular regurgitation.
The persistent tachycardia reduces the duration of
diastole and thus the duration of coronary blood
flow. With the increase in contractility, myocardial
oxygen demand is increased while oxygen delivery
is reduced. These two factors combined may cause
myocardial ischaemia, which will further impair
function.
Persistently high levels of angiotensin II, aldosterone
and catecholamines bring about a process of left
ventricular remodelling causing changes in cardiac
metabolism, myocardial thinning and fibrosis.

Clinical features
Many of the symptoms and signs of heart failure are due
to reduced cardiac output, volume overload and increased pressures within the circulation. Left ventricular
failure will result in increased congestion into the pulmonary circulation, and can cause further backpressure

and congestion into the systemic venous circulation.
Right ventricular failure on the other hand, does not
cause pulmonary congestion, but does cause congestion
of the systemic veins. Fig. 8.4 depicts the clinical signs of
heart failure.
Symptoms include:
• Fatigue.
• Dyspnoea: owing to alveolar oedema caused by
pulmonary venous congestion.
• Orthopnoea: this is shortness of breath in the supine
position. When supine, blood redistributes to the
intrathoracic compartment increasing pressures
and alveolar oedema. It can be relieved by sitting
upright, and patients will often report that they have
to sleep with multiple pillows.
• Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea: patients wake up in
the night gasping for breath.
• Swollen ankles: due to oedema from increased fluid
filtration caused by increased venous pressure.
• Nocturia (urination during the night): as peripheral
oedema is reabsorbed into the circulation when supine at night, circulating volume increases and is
compensated for by an increase in urine output.
The severity of the symptoms and functional capacity
of patients in heart failure are often described using the
New York Heart Association classification (Fig. 8.5).
Signs include:
• Pale, cold peripheries: due to the persistent cutaneous
vasoconstriction.

Class I (mild)

– No limitation of physical activity by symptoms

Class II (mild)

– Symptoms with ordinary activity

Class III (moderate) – Symptoms with minimal activity
Class IV (severe)

102

– Symptoms at rest

• Tachycardia: may be sinus tachycardia or ‘irregularly
irregular’ pulse if in atrial fibrillation (AF).
• Raised jugular venous pressure: due to increased right
atrial pressure from the overloaded right ventricle.
• Displaced apex impulse on palpation: if the left ventricle is dilated, the apex beat may be displaced
inferiorly and laterally.
• A third and/or fourth heart sound may be present.
• Bi-basal pulmonary crackles: due to alveolar oedema.
• Bilateral pitting oedema.
• Hepatomegaly can develop owing to hepatic venous
congestion.
• May be a pansystolic murmur of mitral or tricuspid
regurgitation.
• Pleural effusions: these are often bilateral but if
unilateral, they tend to occur on the right.
In addition to the signs and symptoms described
above: patients with heart failure are prone to developing arrhythmias. Atrial fibrillation is common in heart
failure and the abnormal ventricular myocardium predisposes to ventricular arrhythmias, which is the cause
of death in a large proportion of these patients. Reduced
blood pressure combined with renal vasoconstriction
and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors puts these patients at an increased risk of developing pre-renal acute renal failure due to hypoperfusion.
Investigation may reveal the following:
• Electrocardiogram (ECG): may demonstrate atrial fibrillation, ventricular hypertrophy or left bundle
branch block (LBBB). If the aetiology of the heart
failure is ischaemic, there may be Q waves indicating
a previous myocardial infarction with ST elevation
(STEMI).
• Chest X-ray: may show an enlarged heart shadow
due to dilatation and alveolar shadowing due to oedema. There may be small bilateral pleural effusions.
A typical chest X-ray of a patient with chronic heart
failure is shown in Fig. 8.6.
• Echocardiography: this is a key investigation in the
assessment of heart failure. It allows quantification
of the ejection fraction giving an indication of the
degree of systolic dysfunction. Diastolic dysfunction
can also be assessed. It also allows assessment of
ventricular dilatation and valvular disease.
• B natriuretic peptide: this is released in response to
ventricular stretch and is a very sensitive marker
for heart failure.

Treatment of heart failure
The aims when treating heart failure include the
following:
• Decrease preload.
• Decrease afterload by reducing both ventricular
volume and blood pressure.

Heart failure

limits the degree of ventricular remodelling, reduces the
afterload on the heart (by removing its vasoconstrictor
effect) and limits salt and water retention. ACE inhibitors
have been repeatedly demonstrated to improve survival
and symptoms in heart failure and should be prescribed
to everyone with heart failure whether symptomatic or
not. If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated owing to dry
cough, angiotensin II receptor antagonists can be used
with equal efficacy.

Beta-blockers

congestion. Note that the width of the heart shadow is greater
than half the transthoracic diameter and that there are

failure and pulmonary congestion. (Courtesy of Newby DE,

• Reverse or limit ventricular remodelling.
• Limit heart rate.

General measures
Patients with heart failure should restrict their intake of
salt and if they are volume overloaded fluid restriction
may also be useful. Alcohol should be avoided due to its
toxic effects on the heart. Patients should also have their
co-morbidities effectively managed.

Diuretics
Diuretics increase salt and water excretion in the kidneys. Loop diuretics such as furosemide are the class
most widely used in heart failure to reduce circulating
volume (and thus preload), reducing pulmonary congestion and peripheral oedema. Thiazide-like diuretics
may also be added if loop diuretics alone are not effective in relieving symptoms. Unlike many of the other
drugs used in heart failure, diuretics do not improve survival; they do, however, provide effective symptomatic
relief. The exception to this statement is aldosterone antagonists, which have diuretic function but do improve
prognosis, and are discussed below.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
ACE inhibitors (e.g. enalapril, lisinopril and captopril) inhibit production of angiotensin II (AgII) by angiotensinconverting enzyme. Inhibition of AgII in heart failure

The benefits of beta-blockers in heart failure include
reduction in heart rate, increasing coronary blood
flow. They also decrease the metabolic demand of the
myocardium. In combination with ACE inhibitors,
beta-blockers improve survival and reverse ventricular
remodelling. In some cases, the decreased contractility
and heart rate may worsen symptoms, so they should
be introduced at low doses and the dose increased
slowly.

Aldosterone antagonists
Aldosterone antagonists such as spironolactone and
eplerenone have been shown to improve survival in
heart failure. They reduce preload by inhibiting the action of aldosterone in the renal tubules. They do, however, increase the risk of life-threatening hyperkalaemia,
especially when used in combination with an ACE inhibitor, so electrolyte levels must be closely monitored.
Spironolactone may also cause painful gynaecomastia.

Cardiac glycosides
Digoxin is an inhibitor of the Naþ/KþATPase. This
causes accumulation of Ca2þ in the cytosol of the myocytes exerting a positive inotropic effect. It also acts centrally, increasing vagal outflow to the heart, decreasing
heart rate. The use of digoxin is recommended in patients with heart failure if they have atrial fibrillation
to control the heart rate and in patients with severe heart
failure.

Nitrates
Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) relaxes vascular smooth muscle by increasing levels of cGMP. It preferentially dilates
venous vessels and its use in heart failure is usually
limited to the acute setting because tolerance to its effects develops over 1 or 2 days. By dilating the venous
vessels, GTN decreases preload, reducing the degree of
ventricular volume overload.

103

Heart failure, myocardial and pericardial disease

Inotropic drugs
Inotropic drugs increase the contractility of the myocardium. Their principal role should be restricted to the
management of acute heart failure, as they are associated
with increased mortality with long-term use.

b1-Sympathomimetics

The b1-sympathomimetics dobutamine and dopamine
increase the force of myocardial contraction and heart
rate. They are also vasodilators, reducing afterload.

Phosphodiesterase inhibitors
Milrinone inhibits phosphodiesterase type III, which is
the enzyme that breaks down cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) into 50 -AMP. Inhibition causes a rise
in intracellular cAMP and, therefore, Ca2þ. This means
there is an increase in contractility. Milrinone is also a
vasodilator by the same mechanism in vascular smooth
muscle. It is used in severe heart failure that is unresponsive to other therapy.

Device therapy

DISEASES OF THE MYOCARDIUM
Myocardial damage can be caused by a number of pathological processes. Ischaemia/infarction, arrhythmia,
valvular disease and hypertension all cause myocardial
damage and have been discussed elsewhere. There are
also a number of conditions that cause intrinsic damage
to the myocardium. These include myocarditis and
cardiomyopathy.
HINTS AND TIPS
Cardiomyopathy and myocarditis are, in comparison to
ischaemic heart disease, very rare. It is important to
bear this in mind when learning about conditions that
affect the cardiovascular system.

Myocarditis

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)

Myocarditis is inflammation of the myocardium.
Causes include:

Patients with heart failure often have left bundle branch
block. As the conduction system in these individuals is abnormal, the ventricles do not contract uniformly (there is
some dyssynchrony in the ventricular contraction). New
pacemakers have been developed that stimulate both the
right and the left ventricle simultaneously, with the obvious benefit of resynchronizing the left and right ventricles. This increases cardiac output and is of benefit in
patients with heart failure and broad QRS complexes.

• Infection: viruses (coxsackie, influenza, rubella, echovirus, polio); bacteria (Corynebacterium – diphtheria,
Rickettsia, Chlamydia); protozoa (Trypanosoma cruzi –
Chagas’ disease, Toxoplasma gondii); fungi (Candida).
• Immune-mediated reactions: after infections (viral
or rheumatic fever); systemic lupus erythematosus;
transplant rejection; chemicals, radiation and drugs
(chloroquine, methyldopa, lead poisoning).

Implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICDs)
Patients with heart failure are prone to life-threatening
arrhythmias (e.g. ventricular tachycardia (VT), ventricular fibrillation (VF)). ICDs can be implanted in a similar
way to pacemaker devices to deliver a small electrical
impulse when an arrhythmia arises, preventing sudden
cardiac death. These devices can also prevent tachyarrhythmias by override pacing.

Ventricular assist device
Implantation of mechanical ventricular assist devices
which take over the work of the failing ventricle can be
used as a temporary solution until transplantation can
be performed or until the ventricle recovers its function.

Transplantation
Heart transplantation is the only definitive treatment for
severe, intractable heart failure. The procedure requires
life-long immunosuppression, which puts patients at increased risk of infection. With good patient selection, the
prognosis is good, with 1-year survival rates of 80% and
5-year survival of 70%. The quality of life of the majority
of patients is dramatically improved.

104

Cardiomyopathy
Cardiomyopathy is often divided into the following
three categories based on the morphological features
of the diseased myocardium (Fig. 8.7):
• Dilated cardiomyopathy (85%): with dilated ventricles and impaired systolic function.
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (10%): hypertrophy
of ventricular myocardium, particularly the interventricular septum.
• Restrictive cardiomyopathy (5%): decreased ventricular compliance restricts ventricular filling.

Dilated cardiomyopathy
In contrast to the normal heart, dilated cardiomyopathy
(DCM) causes dilated ventricles and poor systolic (contractile) function. Its prevalence is 0.2%. Causes of DCM
include:
• Idiopathic: 30% have a familial element.
• Alcohol toxicity.

ventricles are thin and dilated. (C) Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. There is an increase in ventricular mass. (D) Restrictive
cardiomyopathy. The heart is of normal size, but the ventricles are stiff.

• Viral myocarditis: myocarditis can progress to dilated cardiomyopathy. The initial acute myocarditis
may not have been noticed at the time.
• Peripartum: physiological changes during the final
trimester of pregnancy can trigger the development
of a DCM.
• Drugs: chemotherapeutic drugs (e.g. doxorubicin,
trastuzumab).
The morphology of the heart in DCM is as follows:
• Thin, dilated walls in all chambers.
• Irregular myocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis.
Dilated ventricles may cause disruption of the atrioventricular valves causing regurgitation. DCM leads to
heart failure, predisposes to arrhythmia, and patients
often develop a mural thrombus in the left ventricle
predisposing to embolic events.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by
hypertrophy of the ventricles. The pattern of hypertrophy
is variable but tends to preferentially affect the interventricular septum. In patients with septal hypertrophy adjacent
to the left ventricular outflow tract, it can cause outflow
tract obstruction. In these patients the condition is called
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and
accounts for one third of cases of HCM. The disease leads
to myocyte hypertrophy and disarray, disrupting ventricular contraction, and can cause abnormal mitral valve
movement and mitral regurgitation. The hypertrophy
reduces ventricular compliance impairing ventricular
filling and causing diastolic dysfunction. About 50% of
cases are inherited (autosomal dominant pattern) and
the condition tends to manifest in early adulthood.

105

Heart failure, myocardial and pericardial disease
HCM may present with dyspnoea, angina or syncope, particularly if there is left ventricular outflow tract
obstruction, but in many cases it may present as sudden
death caused by ventricular arrhythmia and cardiac arrest. Characteristic findings on examination include
a fourth heart sound (due to the stiff ventricle), and a
systolic murmur (in HOCM).

Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Uraemia

Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition characterized by stiffening of the ventricular myocardium.
The reduced compliance restricts ventricular filling. It
is often associated with:

Myocardial infarction – acute
– delayed (Dressler’s)
Rheumatic fever

• Amyloidosis: most common form in the Western
world.
• Endomyocardial fibrosis: children and young adults
in Africa.
Patients often present with dyspnoea and reduced exercise tolerance and often develop heart failure. Symptoms are similar to those seen in constrictive pericarditis
with impaired exercise tolerance.

DISEASES OF THE PERICARDIUM
The pericardium is the fibrous sac that surrounds the
heart and the roots of the great vessels. Conditions that
can arise involving the pericardium include acute pericarditis, constrictive pericarditis, pericardial effusion
and cardiac tamponade.

Acute pericarditis
Pericarditis is an inflammation of the pericardium that
leads to sharp retrosternal chest pain that radiates to the
back, and that is aggravated by movement and respiration. On auscultation there may be a pericardial rub
heard. Common causes are listed in Fig. 8.8. The mainstay of treatment is symptomatic relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. If the inflammatory
process continues it can lead to fibrosis and shrinking of
the pericardium (constrictive pericarditis) that can restrict cardiac filling. Constrictive pericarditis can also
be caused by radiotherapy. The haemodynamic consequences of constrictive pericarditis are the same as those
described below from cardiac tamponade but develop
more slowly.

Pericardial effusion
A pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid in the
pericardial cavity and can be caused by any condition
causing pericarditis. The effusion collects in the closed cavity and causes distension. If the fluid accumulates slowly,
the pericardium distends. If fluid accumulates quickly or

106

Bacterial
Rheumatoid arthritis

the pericardium cannot distend any further, the pressure
increases and can cause cardiac tamponade (impaired
ventricular filling leading to loss of cardiac output).

Haemopericardium
Haemopericardium is the accumulation of blood in the
pericardial sac. It is caused by:
•
•
•
•
•

Myocardial rupture after a myocardial infarction.
Rupture of the intrapericardial aorta.
Dissecting aortic aneurysm.
Haemorrhage from an abscess or tumour.
Trauma.

As with pericardial effusion, the consequences
depend on the rate of accumulation of blood.

Cardiac tamponade
When fluid or blood accumulates quickly within the
pericardial sac, the pericardium does not stretch and
the increase in pressure effectively compresses the heart.
The signs of cardiac tamponade are described by Beck’s
triad and include:
• Hypotension: increased pressure in the atria and
ventricles impairs cardiac filling during diastole. This
diastolic dysfunction limits the ventricular enddiastolic volume and thus stroke volume. This decreases cardiac output causing hypotension. If severe
this can lead to shock.
• Raised jugular venous pressure (JVP): the increased
pressure in the right atrium causes a raised JVP.
• Muffled/quiet heart sounds: the fluid around the
heart reduces conduction of the heart sounds to
the chest wall.

Diseases of the pericardium
Another sign seen in cardiac tamponade is called
Kussmaul’s sign. This describes a paradoxical rise in the
JVP during inspiration. During inspiration, the intrathoracic pressure decreases, effectively sucking blood
into the intrathoracic compartment, increasing venous
return. Usually this would increase right ventricular

8

filling but in tamponade, this is prevented and causes
a rise in the JVP.
Cardiac tamponade is a medical emergency and
should be treated promptly by aspirating the blood/
fluid from the pericardial space, a procedure called
pericardiocentesis.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the broad classification of arterial and venous disease.
• Describe the different manifestations of peripheral arterial disease.
• Understand the basic principles of examining the peripheral arterial system.
• Describe the main causes and types of aneurysms and the possible sequelae.
• Have a basic understanding of aortic dissection and carotid artery disease.
• Understand the two compartments of the lower limb venous system and the major pathology that
affects each.
• Recall the risk factors for varicose veins and deep venous thrombosis.

ARTERIAL DISEASE
Arterial disease can be broadly divided into occlusive
disease and aneurysmal disease.

Occlusive arterial disease
Chronic
This is commonly referred to as peripheral vascular disease and is caused by atherosclerosis in the major arteries supplying the lower limbs (rarely the upper limbs).
As a result, the pathogenesis and risk factors for this
disease are those that apply to atherosclerosis (see
Ch. 7). People with coronary artery disease are likely to
have a degree of peripheral vascular disease and vice
versa because they are underpinned by the same
pathological process.

Intermittent claudication
This is characterized by a ‘gripping’, cramp-like pain in
the calf or buttock on exercise or walking, which subsides at rest. Stable angina is the coronary equivalent
of intermittent claudication. It is due to an imbalance
between oxygen supply and demand in the skeletal
muscle. Atherosclerotic plaques in the arteries supplying the leg cause a stenosis, preventing the normal
metabolically mediated increase in blood flow during
exercise. As oxygen demand subsides with rest to a level
such that blood flow is adequate once again, pain subsides. If pain is felt in the calf muscle, the blockage is
usually in the femoral artery or the popliteal artery
and if pain is felt in the buttocks, the blockage is usually
more proximal, in the iliac artery.

At this relatively early stage in the disease, lifestyle
modification to prevent disease progression is the mainstay of treatment. Patients should stop smoking, control
blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol pharmacologically, and try undertaking aerobic exercise as much as
possible to promote development of collateral blood
supply to the ischaemic muscle. If the symptoms are
causing significant impact on the patient, angioplasty
can be performed to dilate the stenosed vessel.

Critical limb ischaemia
This is characterized by pain at rest, gangrene, or an
ankle–brachial pressure index less than 0.3 (discussed
below). Rest pain occurs when blood flow to the
affected muscle is limited to such a degree that it cannot provide adequate perfusion to meet the resting
metabolic requirements of the muscle. Rest pain usually
first occurs during the night when lower limb perfusion
is not aided by gravity and patients may find relief by
hanging their leg out of the bed.
HINTS AND TIPS
The features of critical limb ischaemia include:
• Tissue loss.
• Rest pain for > 2 weeks.
• Ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI) < 0.3.

Critical limb ischaemia can be treated in some cases
with angioplasty, but often patients require surgery.
Bypass surgery is often performed, in which a conduit
(either a synthetic tube or the patient’s long saphenous

109

Vascular disease
vein) is used to bypass the stenosed segment of artery,
restoring perfusion. If symptoms cannot be controlled
by bypass surgery, or gangrene has lead to severe infection, amputation of the limb may become necessary.
HINTS AND TIPS
Peripheral vascular disease is very common in diabetics
and smokers. It is important to establish the
claudication distance, i.e. how far the patient can walk
before onset of pain, and the effect it has on their
quality of life. This helps determine whether the
management should be conservative or surgical.

Acute limb ischaemia
Acute ischaemia occurs when there is acute occlusion of
an artery. This is analogous to an acute coronary syndrome. In this case, unless there has been a history of
chronic occlusive disease, there is unlikely to be much
collateral circulation and blood flow to the distal tissues
may be completely halted. Acute limb ischaemia presents with the ‘six Ps’ (three symptoms and three signs):
• Pain: due to skeletal muscle ischaemia.
• Paraesthesia: caused by ischaemia of the sensory
nerves.
• Paralysis.
• Pallor.
• Pulselessness.
• Perishing cold (to touch).

Next, palpate both legs from top to bottom with the
back of the hands to assess for any differences in temperature between the legs, or cold skin. Assess the capillary
refill time in each foot by pressing firmly on the skin for
5 s, releasing your finger and observing the time it takes
for the skin to return to its original colour. Normally the
capillary refill time is less than 2 s.
Palpate the abdominal aorta, then palpate and auscultate (for bruits) each of the peripheral pulses as
described below.

Femoral pulse
The femoral pulse is located just below the mid-inguinal
point (halfway between the anterior superior iliac spine
(ASIS) and the pubic symphysis). It is a strong pulse and
should be easy to palpate.

Popliteal pulse
The popliteal arteries can be found in the popliteal fossae behind the knee and are often difficult to palpate.
The thumbs of both hands should be rested on either
side of the patella and the fingertips should be placed
deep into the popliteal fossa so that the popliteal artery
is compressed against the posterior aspect of the tibia.
The popliteals are best palpated with the knees flexed
at about 120 .

Posterior tibial pulse
The posterior tibial pulse is palpated about 1 cm posterior and inferior to the medial malleolus of the tibia
with the patient’s foot relaxed.

Causes of acute ischaemia include:
• Embolism: could originate from a thrombus in the
heart in someone with atrial fibrillation, vegetations
in someone with infective endocarditis or from a
thrombus within the sac of an aneurysm (see below).
• Thrombosis: thrombosis of a ruptured atherosclerotic plaque (the equivalent of acute coronary
syndrome).
• Raynaud’s syndrome: excessive vasoconstriction,
often in response to cold, prevents tissue perfusion.
Most commonly affects the fingers.
• Trauma.

Examination
As with any examination, begin with inspection, comparing the two legs. Look for:
• Pallor.
• Ulcers: arterial ulcers tend to be deep and occur at
points of pressure such as the heel and toes. It is also
crucial to look between all the toes!
• Mottling of the skin.
• Hair loss.
• Scars.

110

Dorsalis pedis pulse
The dorsalis pedis pulse is palpated against the tarsal
bones on the dorsum of the foot, just lateral to the
tendon of extensor hallucis longus.

Buerger’s test
This is the final part of the examination for peripheral
arterial disease. Start with the patient lying on the
bed. Slowly lift each leg off the bed and observe the
angle at which the leg goes pale, i.e. stops being adequately perfused. In normal individuals, the leg will
remain perfused (and thus pink) all the way to 90 of
hip flexion, but in patients with peripheral vascular disease, the leg may go pale at an angle of as little as 15 .
A Buerger’s angle of less than 20 indicates severe ischaemia. Having identified the Buerger’s angle, lower the leg
over the side of the bed and observe the colour change.
In a patient with severe peripheral arterial disease, there
will be a delay in the restoration of blood flow, but once
perfusion is restored, the leg will go a red-orange colour
(sometimes described as sunset foot) due to a profound
metabolic vasodilatation before returning to normal
colour. This is a positive Buerger’s sign.

9

Arterial disease

Doppler ultrasonography
This is used to measure flow in peripheral vessels to provide information about the arteries (e.g. in peripheral
vascular disease) and the veins (e.g. in suspected deep
venous thrombosis). It uses ultrasound, in a similar
way to that in echocardiography, to map out the vessel
– highlighting any stenosis. Red blood cells move relative to the ultrasound beam. They create a Doppler shift,
which is a change in the frequency of the ultrasound
echo that returns to the transducer. The shift in frequency is directly proportional to the velocity of the
blood. Colour can be used to differentiate blood flowing towards the probe from blood flowing away. It is
commonly used to assess peripheral vessel function
before a site is selected for angiography.
Doppler can also be used to calculate the ankle–
brachial pressure index (ABPI). The Doppler-derived
systolic pressure from one of the foot pulses in the ankle
(usually the dorsalis pedis) is divided into the Dopplerderived systolic pressure in the brachial artery recorded
with the patient lying down (when the pressures should
be equal). This ratio provides useful information about
the severity of peripheral vascular disease:
• ABPI > 0.7 indicates normal vessel calibre (the
blood pressure in the feet may be slightly higher
than in the arms due to the effect of gravity).
• ABPI <0.7 indicates a degree of peripheral vascular
disease (the blood pressure in the feet is less than
that in the arm due to atheroma formation or
diabetic vessel changes).
• ABPI < 0.3 indicates critical ischaemia (the blood
pressure in the feet is so low it is likely the patient
will be experiencing symptoms of ischaemia at rest).

Aneurysmal disease
An aneurysm is an abnormal, permanent dilatation of
an artery or portion of an artery. True aneurysms involve
all three layers of the vessel wall and can be classified
morphologically as fusiform or saccular (Fig. 9.1). False
(or pseudo-) aneurysms occur when blood leaks out of a
vessel but is contained by the outer layers of the vessel or
surrounding connective tissue. A dissecting aneurysm
(or dissection) occurs when there is a tear in the vessel
intima that allows blood to flow into the wall, creating
an additional channel (the false lumen) between the intima and media through which blood can flow. This intimal tear can result from shear forces acting on the
intima from within the vessel lumen or from internal
rupture of a small haematoma within the vessel media.
An aneurysm can theoretically develop in any artery;
however, they are by far most common in the aorta, in
particular, the abdominal aorta where they are a common finding in elderly males. The most common site
for a peripheral aneurysm is the popliteal artery. The

development of aneurysms can be caused by a number
of factors:
• Atherosclerosis: this is the most common cause. The
migration of smooth muscle cells from the media
into the intimal lesion weakens the wall, promoting
aneurysm development. In addition atherosclerosis
affecting the vasa vasorum supplying the vessel
wall can cause ischaemia/infarction of the wall,
weakening it further.
• Cystic medial degeneration: affects the thoracic aorta
primarily and predisposes to development of aneurysm and dissection. There is degeneration of the
media and reduction in elasticity. This occurs particularly in patients with connective tissue disorders
such as Marfan’s syndrome.
• Vasculitis: conditions such as Kawasaki’s disease
(causes coronary artery aneurysms), giant cell arteritis (predisposes to ascending aortic aneurysms) and
Takayasu’s arteritis all predispose to aneurysm
development.
• Infection: tertiary syphilis can lead to the development of saccular aneurysms in the proximal aorta.
These are referred to as luetic aneurysms.
• Congenital: small saccular aneurysms in the circle
of Willis in the cerebral circulation called Berry
aneurysms (Fig. 9.2). If these rupture they cause a
subarachnoid haemorrhage.
Aneurysms are often asymptomatic but can cause
symptoms following any of the following complications:

• Rupture: the likelihood of rupture increases with the
degree of aneurysmal dilatation. Rupture can cause
massive blood loss, particularly in the case of the
aorta, which can be rapidly fatal.
• Thrombosis: altered haemodynamics in the aneurysmal segment of vessel can lead to the development
of a thrombus within the aneurysm. This thrombus
can extend and obstruct the vessel.
• Embolism: small pieces of thrombus can detach
from the thrombus lining the aneurysm, which
may then occlude distal vessels, causing acute ischaemia. The calibre of vessel occluded depends on the
size of the thrombus. Small emboli may lodge in
small distal vessels causing digital ischaemia while
large emboli may occlude larger vessels causing
acute limb ischaemia or acute bowel ischaemia.
• Pressure: as the aneurysm expands it can compress
adjacent structures. For example, an aneurysm in
the aortic arch can compress the oesophagus causing
dysphagia (difficultly swallowing).
Ultrasound scanning is a useful tool for the assessment of peripheral aneurysms, as it allows quantification of the vessel diameter. In the aorta, however,
ultrasound scanning gives poor visualization and computed tomography (CT) scanning with intravenous contrast is the investigation of choice. Magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) can also be used to give high-resolution
images. A CT scan of an abdominal aortic aneurysm is
shown in Fig. 9.3.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm
Abdominal aortic aneurysms are present in approximately 3% of men over 50. They can be asymptomatic
and identified incidentally on physical examination
with an expansile mass in the abdomen, or during

112

Professor Newby.)

imaging studies for another purpose. Some will present
with back pain due to compression of retroperitoneal
structures, or abdominal pain. The most feared complication is rupture, which leads to catastrophic blood loss
and is associated with very high mortality. The chance
of rupture increases with the size of the aneurysm and
is increased in hypertensive individuals. Currently, intervention is indicated when the diameter exceeds 5.5 cm or
the patient is symptomatic. Treatment options include:
• Surgical: a synthetic graft to replace the aneurysmal
segment of the aorta.
• Endovascular: a synthetic graft is introduced percutaneously via the femoral artery and placed in the aneurysmal segment. The aneurysm is then excluded
from the aortic blood flow.

Aortic dissection
In aortic dissection, a false lumen is created within the
aortic wall as a result of a tear in the intima. It usually
occurs in the thoracic aorta due to the high physical

Diseases of the veins
forces exerted on the vessel wall. The most widely
used classification of aortic dissection is the Stanford
classification:
• Type A: involves the ascending aorta.
• Type B: does not involve the ascending aorta.
Aortic dissection is most common in people with hypertension and those with connective tissue disorders
such as Marfan’s syndrome. Pregnancy is also an important risk factor for aortic dissection. Patients with aortic
dissection typically present with severe sudden onset
chest pain, sometimes radiating to the back. It is always
important to consider this diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain. Diagnosis is usually made using
CT scanning or MRI. A sagittal MRI scan of an aortic
dissection is shown in Fig. 9.4.
Sequelae of dissection include:
• Rupture, which is rapidly fatal.
• Occlusion of aortic branches, especially coronary,
cerebral, and renal arteries.
• Proximal extension of the dissection can cause aortic
regurgitation or cardiac tamponade.
Acute type A dissection has a mortality rate of 1–2%
per hour during the first 48 h and a 90% mortality at 30
days if left untreated. Classically, type A dissections
(high risk of rupture) are treated surgically by replacing

9

the affected segment of the aorta with a synthetic
graft, while type B dissections (which are not as immediately life-threatening) are treated medically with tight
blood pressure control to reduce wall stress or with
endovascular stenting.

Carotid artery disease
Atherosclerotic plaques commonly develop at the bifurcation of the carotid artery. The consequences of this
can cause significant problems:
• Severe, stable stenosis, if occurring bilaterally, can
lead to cerebral hypoperfusion causing confusion
or syncope.
• Thrombi can form on the surface of the atheroma
and throw off small emboli to the cerebral circulation. This can cause an embolic stroke or a transient
ischaemic attack (mimics a stroke but symptoms last
less than 24 h).
On examination, a carotid bruit (sounds similar to a
systolic murmur) may be heard during auscultation of
the neck but this is not a reliable sign. This is produced
by abnormal turbulent flow that develops as the normal
laminar flow is disturbed by the stenosis. Doppler ultrasound can be used to assess the presence and degree of
stenosis. Intervention is usually performed in symptomatic patients with a greater than 70% stenosis. Options
include carotid endarterectomy, in which surgeons
open the carotid artery and scrape out the atheroma
or carotid artery stenting to compress the atheroma,
increasing vessel patency.

DISEASES OF THE VEINS
The venous system of the lower limbs comprises a deep
and a superficial system. Fig. 9.5 depicts the major
superficial veins, the long and short saphenous veins.
These join the femoral vein and popliteal vein (deep
veins) respectively, as well as giving off a number of
small perforating veins to the deep veins. Blood flows
into the deep veins and with the aid of the skeletal (primarily calf) muscle pump and the numerous valves, the
blood is returned to the central veins. There are two important conditions of the veins to understand, varicose
veins, which affect the superficial venous system, and
deep vein thrombosis, which affects the deep venous
system.

Varicose veins

Note how the descending aorta seems to have two lumens
(double-barrelled). (Courtesy of Dr A Timmis and Dr S Brecker.)

Varicose veins are tortuous, dilated superficial veins,
usually of the lower limbs, caused by valvular incompetence. They occur in 10–20% of the normal population,
and although far more women present to hospital or

veins into the superficial veins. This will lead to distension and further valvular incompetence, resulting in stasis of blood. Oedema and skin changes develop, which
fail to heal as a result of the impaired circulation.
Sequelae of varicose veins include:
• Bleeding: mild trauma can cause profuse bleeding
from varicose veins because pressures are high and
the walls of the vein are thin and distended.
• Phlebitis: inflammation of the vessel wall that may
be complicated by bacterial infection.
• Venous eczema: skin becomes thin and has a brown
discolouration. It is caused by leakage of cells into
the tissue due to the high venous pressure, which
then break down releasing haemosiderin into
the skin.
• Venous ulcers: usually occur on the medial aspect of
the lower leg (the gaiter area). They tend to be shallow and often contain pink granulation tissue as
they attempt to heal.
Varicose veins do not always require treatment. Occasionally, patients complain of a dragging sensation,
bleeding or are disturbed by the appearance of their
legs. In these patients, surgery may be appropriate to
remove the distended veins.

their GP as a result of their varicose veins, the actual incidence is thought to be the same in men and women.
Risk factors include:
• Pregnancy.
• Obesity.
• Prolonged standing: therefore it is important to
know the patient’s occupation.
• Previous deep vein thrombosis.
• Pelvic masses compressing the deep veins.

Aetiology
As discussed above, blood is returned mainly through
the deep veins to the thoracic compartment by the skeletal pumping effect of the calf muscles. If there is an obstruction to flow in the deep veins (e.g. by thrombosis
or pelvic mass) or there are incompetent valves in the
perforating veins, then blood will move from the deep

114

Ulceration often occurs on the lower limbs, and
distinguishing between the different causes clinically is
often very difficult. Arterial ulcers are usually deep,
punched out lesions on the lateral aspect of the foot,
between the toes and on pressure points. Venous ulcers
are most often sloughy, and on the medial aspect of the
calf in the gaiter area. The key to detecting neuropathic
ulceration is to test the sensation in the feet. Diabetic
ulcers tend to be a mixture of neuropathic and
micro-angiopathic ulcers.

Varicose veins affect a large number of people, those
who stand for long periods of time, e.g. teachers, being
particularly at risk. Treatment may be conservative, i.e.
compression bandaging, or surgical. Surgical treatment
may be local, e.g. injection of sclerosant into the dilated
vein, or generalized, e.g. tying off the incompetent
valve and stripping out the dilated vein.

Other sites of varicosities
Increased venous pressures can cause abnormal dilatation of veins elsewhere in the body. These include:

Diseases of the veins
• Haemorrhoids (piles) are distended submucosal
veins in the anal canal that may protrude through
the anus. Bleeding and pain may result from trauma,
protrusion or spasm of the anal sphincter.
• Varicocoele is a distension of the veins of the pampiniform plexus in the spermatic cord.
• Oesophageal varices are distended veins at the oesophageal–gastric junction. They are caused by portal
hypertension, usually as a result of liver cirrhosis.

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)
DVT describes the presence of a thrombus within the
deep veins of the leg and develops most commonly in
the deep veins of the thigh or in the deep veins of the
calf. Often DVT is asymptomatic but it can cause calf
pain, unilateral leg swelling with raised skin temperature and dilated superficial veins. The major concern
in a patient with a DVT is that part of the thrombus will
detach and embolize to the pulmonary circulation,
causing a pulmonary embolism.
Risk factors for thrombosis are used to formulate a
Well’s score (Fig. 9.6) but can be considered more
broadly using Virchow’s triad, which describes three
prothrombotic conditions:
• Stasis: this can be a result of obstruction to venous
outflow from the legs caused by a pelvic mass or
by a fetus in a pregnant woman.

9

• Hypercoagulable state: the oral contraceptive pill
and malignancy are both factors that increase the
coagulability of the blood.
• Endothelial damage.

Leg swelling is a result of oedema due to alteration in
the forces of fluid filtration. Increased venous pressure
will increase the capillary hydrostatic pressure within
the leg, increasing fluid filtration and increasing
interstitial fluid.

Usually investigation is with Doppler ultrasonography to look for the presence of a thrombus. D-dimers
(fibrin degradation products) can also be measured in
a patient suspected to have a DVT, but this has poor
specificity. As a result, D-dimer measurement is useful
for ruling out a DVT but has no role in confirming
the diagnosis. The gold standard investigation is venography using intravenous contrast. Initial treatment is
anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin.
In patients who suffer a pulmonary embolism and have
a persistent DVT, an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter can
be considered. As the name suggests, this is a fine filter
that is placed in the IVC and prevents emboli from the
veins of the leg reaching the pulmonary circulation.

Basic history and examination
of the cardiovascular system

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the important points to note in the cardiovascular history.
• Understand the importance of observing the patient from the end of the bed.
• Recognize clinical signs in the hands and face and know their diagnostic inference.
• Describe how to palpate the peripheral pulses and be aware of abnormalities that may be found.
• Conduct a thorough examination of the thorax including inspection, palpation and auscultation.
• Understand the principles of auscultation of the heart, including valve areas, heart sounds and murmurs.

TAKING A HISTORY
It is not the purpose of this book to discuss the basic
principles of taking a medical history, and it will not
do so. There are, however, a number of important factors that must be addressed when taking a history of a
patient with cardiovascular disease.
As with any history, you should let the patient tell
you the natural history of the complaint, but symptoms
you should specifically ask about that are relevant to the
cardiovascular system include:
• Chest pain.
• Shortness of breath, orthopnoea and paroxysmal
nocturnal dyspnoea (PND).
• Oedema/leg swelling.
• Palpitation.
• Syncope (fainting) or dizziness.
• Intermittent claudication.

Risk factors

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Dyslipidaemia/high cholesterol.
Smoker.
Myocardial infarction.
Stroke or transient ischaemic attack.
Angina.
Peripheral vascular disease.
Rheumatic fever.
Renal disease.
Specific surgical procedures to note include:

• Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG).
• Angioplasty (not strictly surgical, but the patient
may see it that way).
• Pacemakers and other implantable devices.
• Vascular surgery.

Family history
Any relevant family history should be noted. Ask
whether there is any incidence of the following diseases
in close relatives:
•
•
•
•
•

Diabetes mellitus.
Myocardial infarction.
Stroke.
Angina.
Hypertension.

If the history is consistent with any form of vascular disease (including ischaemic heart disease, peripheral vascular disease and cerebrovascular disease), it is useful to
make a list of risk factors for atherosclerosis that the patient does and does not have. See chapter 7 to remind
yourself of these. Knowledge of these risk factors helps
to formulate a management plan tailored specifically to
that individual patient.

A positive family history for myocardial infarction is regarded as <55 years for a male first-degree relative and <65
for a female first-degree relative.

Past medical history

Review of systems

Ask the patient if they have any other medical problems
and if they have ever undergone a surgical procedure.
Important past medical conditions to note include:
• Diabetes mellitus.
• Hypertension.

Respiratory system
Note the presence of any cough, sputum or haemoptysis, which may occur in a patient with pulmonary
oedema. A dry cough is a side-effect of angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

117

Basic history and examination of the cardiovascular system

Gastrointestinal system

Radial pulse

Abdominal (particularly epigastric) pain might be
caused by a myocardial infarction. Other abdominal
pain might be caused by an aortic aneurysm or bowel
ischaemia due to obstruction of the mesenteric vessels.

Palpate the radial pulse with the tips of the fingers and
gently compress the radial artery against the head of the
radius. The radial pulse is used to assess heart rate and
rhythm. The pulse character and volume, however, are
best assessed at the carotid artery. The rate should be
counted for about 30 seconds and then doubled to give
a rate per minute. A normal pulse is between 60 and 100
beats per minute (bpm). Anything outside this range is
termed bradycardia (<60 bpm) or tachycardia
(>100 bpm). The rhythm may be regular or irregular;
if it is irregular, note whether it is a repeating irregularity
(regularly irregular) or is completely irregular (irregularly irregular):

Genitourinary system
Cardiovascular causes of increased frequency of micturition and increased urine production include diabetes
mellitus and diuretic therapy. Intermittent supraventricular tachycardias may also cause increased urine production. Nocturia (needing to micturate at night) is
common in heart failure.
HINTS AND TIPS
When taking a history it is important to individualize it
to the patient in order to gain a holistic view. This is
particularly important with risk factors for ischaemic
heart disease, and how their angina limits their hobbies
and activities.

CLINICAL EXAMINATION
This is not an exhaustive account of the clinical signs
that may be encountered in patients with cardiovascular
disease, but it provides an overview that is sufficient for
those in the early stages of clinical training.
Before beginning your examination it is always important to introduce yourself to the patient, gain consent to examine the patient and ensure they are
adequately exposed. The patient should be seated at
45 and the whole upper body exposed. Examination
should then begin with you standing at the end of the
bed and observing the patient.

General appearance
Note the general appearance of the patient. Think about
whether the patient looks comfortable or if they are in
pain. The patient may be obviously short of breath, look
pale or may be cyanosed (blueish tinge to the skin). At
this point you should make a note of any oxygen masks
or intravenous infusions that the patient is receiving.
You may also hear the clicking sound of a mechanical
heart valve replacement.

• Regular: normal rhythm; remember sinus arrhythmia is normal (an increased rate during inspiration).
• Regularly irregular: commonly caused by ectopic systolic beats or second-degree heart block.
• Irregularly irregular: usually caused by atrial fibrillation, but an ECG is required to confirm this.
Radioradial delay is delay of the left radial pulse compared with the right; this may be due to an aortic dissection affecting the proximal aorta or due to subclavian
artery stenosis. Radiofemoral delay is delay of the femoral pulse compared with the radial; this may be due to
coarctation of the aorta. Checking for a collapsing pulse
(see below) is also often performed at the wrist. The flats
of the examiner’s fingers should be placed over the radial artery, and the shoulder flexed. A positive result is
a bounding pulse, which rapidly falls.
HINTS AND TIPS
Taking the radial pulse affords a good opportunity to
observe the patient, and also to measure the
respiratory rate. The respiratory rate often rises when
patients think it is being measured!

Brachial pulse
Palpate just above the medial aspect of the antecubital
fossa and compress the brachial artery against the humerus. If you have trouble, palpate the tendon of biceps
and move your fingers medial to it. People will usually
assess the brachial pulse OR the carotid pulse for the
pulse character.

Hands and arms

Blood pressure

Both hands should be inspected on the anterior and
posterior aspects. Signs that may be present in the hands
are shown in Fig. 10.1.

A measurement of blood pressure should be taken in all
patients. As well as observing whether the blood pressure is high or low, think about whether the pulse

pressure is normal, increased or decreased. This can give
useful clues as to the diagnosis.

Face and neck
Signs that may be found in the face are shown in
Fig. 10.2. Examination of the retinas with an ophthalmoscope may reveal evidence of microvascular damage
caused by diabetes mellitus or hypertension and may
reveal Roth’s spots (retinal haemorrhages) in a patient
with infective endocarditis. In practice, however, this
is not routinely performed.

Carotid pulse
The carotid pulse should be palpated by pressing backwards at the medial border of the sternocleidomastoid
and lateral to the thyroid cartilage. The two pulses
should never be palpated at the same time or you will
risk restricting the cerebral blood supply. The carotid
pulse should be used to assess the character of the pulse
(Fig. 10.3). This may be difficult, and it is important to

note that there are variations of normal pulse character.
The important pulses to note are:
• Slow rising pulse: the pulse rises slowly to a peak and
then falls slowly. It is of small volume. This suggests
aortic stenosis.
• Collapsing (water-hammer) pulse: there is a rapid
rise to the pulse and then a rapid fall. It is usually
found in aortic regurgitation but may also be found
in patent ductus arteriosus.
• Bisferiens pulse: this is a combination of a slow rising and collapsing pulse. It is indicative of aortic stenosis and regurgitation (mixed aortic valve disease).
• Pulsus alternans: this is composed of alternating
strong and weak pulses. It indicates severe left ventricular dysfunction.
• Pulsus paradoxus: this is a pulse that is weaker or
even disappears on inspiration. Although blood
pressure can decrease slightly during inspiration in
a normal individual, if it drops by more than
10 mmHg it is defined as pulsus paradoxus and is
abnormal. It can occur in cardiac tamponade, constrictive pericarditis or a tension pneumothorax.

The volume of the pulse should also be assessed. A

which cardiac output is high.

Jugular venous pulse
The internal jugular vein reflects the right atrial pressure.
The reasons behind this and the components of the normal waveform are described in Chapter 4. You should
observe the maximum height of the jugular venous
pulse (JVP) and the character of the pulsation as follows
(Fig. 10.4):


1. Place the patient at a 45 angle, with the neck supported to relax the neck muscles. You may need to
turn the patient’s head away from you slightly.
2. Observe the junction of the sternocleidomastoid
with the clavicle and then look up along the route
of the jugular veins to see if you can see any visible
pulsations.
3. Try palpating the pulse. If you can feel it, then
the pulse is probably from the carotid artery.
Venous pulses are almost impossible to feel. Furthermore, the venous pulse is usually complex, with
two impulses and a dominant inward wave, whereas
the arterial pulse is usually a simple dominant outward wave. The jugular venous pulse also decreases
with inspiration under normal circumstances.
4. Estimate the vertical height of the pulse from the
manubriosternal angle (angle of Louis). This gives
an indication of the jugular venous pressure, a direct
indicator of right atrial pressure.

The external jugular vein is often easier to see, as it is
lateral to the sternocleidomastoid and more superficial. However, it is an unreliable indicator of central venous pressure. It contains valves and moves through
many fascial planes, and so it is affected by compression from structures in the neck. Some common
abnormalities of the JVP waveform are described in
Fig. 10.5.
A raised jugular venous pulse (>4 cm above the
manubriosternal angle) is usually indicative of:
• Right heart failure.
• Superior vena cava obstruction (this also abolishes
any pulsations).
• Intravascular volume overload (e.g. acute nephritis,
excess fluid therapy).
If the jugular venous pulse rises on inspiration
(Kussmaul’s sign) then consider:

Fig. 10.4 The course of the internal and external jugular
veins.

• Constrictive pericarditis.
• Cardiac tamponade.
• Tension pneumothorax.

Observing the jugular venous pulse is a very difficult
clinical skill to master. A patient with right ventricular
failure will often have a raised JVP, as a result of the
increased back-pressure in the vessels. Distinguishing
the JVP from carotid pulsation is important. The JVP rises
on inspiration, has a complicated waveform, fills from
the top when occluded, is non-palpable and is
exaggerated by the hepatojugular reflex and the
Valsalva manoeuvre.

If the jugular venous pulse is not visible, you may
attempt to elicit the hepatojugular reflex. This involves
applying pressure over the liver, which should increase
venous return, raise central venous pressure and cause
the jugular venous pressure to rise and become visible.
If the jugular venous pulse was originally so high that it
was not visible in the neck (i.e. the venous pulse was in
the jaw), then this manoeuvre will not elicit any change.
Observation of the jugular venous pulse gives a good indication of right atrial pressure and thus right-sided cardiac filling pressures. This can be measured more
accurately by the placement of a central line in the internal jugular vein. Normal central venous pressure is
0–10 cmH2O.

heart apex

Fig. 10.6 Position of the apex beat. The apex beat is the
position most inferior and furthest lateral that the cardiac
impulse can be felt. As a guide to identifying intercostal spaces,
the second rib lies lateral to the manubriosternal angle; the
second intercostal space is below this rib. The lateral position can
also be described relative to the anterior axillary line and the
mid-axillary line. The normal apex beat lies in the fifth intercostal
space, mid-clavicular line.

Thorax
Inspection
Thorough inspection of the thorax should include asking the patient to lift their arms. Look for scars, chest
wall deformities, abnormal pulsations and a pacemaker/implantable cardiac defibrillator implant (usually just below the clavicle on the left). Important
scars to be aware of include a median sternotomy, lateral thoracotomy and mitral valvotomy scar (may be
hidden under the breast in a female patient).

palm of the hand for a right ventricular heave and finally, all four valve areas (see below) should be palpated with the lateral border of the hand for a thrill.
HINTS AND TIPS
If you cannot palpate the apex beat with the patient at
45 , try turning them to the left-hand side. This should
make the apex palpable in the mid-clavicular line.
Remember the causes of a non-palpable apex beat:
obesity, displacement, dextrocardia, hyperinflation of
the chest, pericardial or pleural effusions.

Palpation
The apex beat should be palpated first. The apex beat is
defined as the most inferior-lateral point at which the
cardiac impulse can be felt and is normally located in
the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line
(Fig. 10.6). If the apex beat is displaced (usually inferolaterally) it indicates cardiac dilatation. In left ventricular hypertrophy, due to hypertension or aortic stenosis
for example, the apex beat is more forceful. It is important to remember the distinction between ventricular dilatation (which causes displacement of the apex beat)
and hypertrophy (which increases the force of the apex
beat). The left sternal edge should be palpated with the

Auscultation
The stethoscope has two ends, the bell and the diaphragm (this is the larger, flatter end). The diaphragm
is better for listening to higher pitched sounds; therefore, it is best for hearing:
•
•
•
•

First and second heart sounds.
Third and fourth heart sounds.
Systolic murmurs.
Aortic diastolic murmurs (aortic incompetence).

Clinical examination

aortic (second
intercostal space,
right sternal edge)

pulmonary area (second
intercostal space,
left sternal edge)

Finally, use the diaphragm to auscultate the bases of
the lungs to check for signs of pulmonary oedema (i.e.
fine crackles) or pleural effusion (absent breath sounds).

Normal heart sounds
manubrium
of sternum

Initially, concentrate on identifying the normal heart
sounds first – a repetitive ‘lupp-dubb’. Auscultating
while palpating the carotid pulse will help to distinguish the heart sounds. The first heart sound (S1) coincides with the onset of systole and, therefore, the carotid
pulse. The second heart sound (S2) coincides with the
beginning of diastole. Occasionally, the heart sounds
may be split, when one component of the sound occurs
before the other. S2 is normally split on inspiration, especially in the young. The heart sounds have already
been discussed in Chapter 4.

Added heart sounds

(left sternal edge)

mitral area
(fifth intercostal space)

Fig. 10.7 Auscultatory areas. This shows where the valve
sounds are best heard. These areas are not the surface markings
of where the valves actually are.

The bell of the stethoscope is best for low-pitched
sounds and is best for hearing the rumbling diastolic
murmur of mitral stenosis. The bell should not be
placed too tightly to the skin, as it will then function
as a diaphragm.
There are certain areas where auscultation should be
performed (Fig. 10.7); these are the areas where murmurs from heart valves are best heard:
• Mitral area: fifth intercostal space, mid-clavicular line.
• Tricuspid area: fourth intercostal space, left sternal
edge.
• Aortic area: second intercostal space, right sternal
edge.
• Pulmonary area: second intercostal space, left sternal
edge.
If a systolic murmur is heard, the axilla and the carotid arteries should be auscultated with the diaphragm
of the stethoscope for radiation. The murmur of mitral
regurgitation often radiates to the axilla and the murmur of aortic stenosis classically radiates to the carotid
arteries, although it can also sometimes be heard in the
axilla.
Diastolic murmurs can be quiet and difficult to hear.
Rolling the patient onto their left-hand side brings the
apex of the heart into contact with the chest wall and
may make the murmur of mitral stenosis audible. By
asking the patient to sit forward and hold their breath
in expiration, a murmur of aortic regurgitation can be
heard better at the left sternal edge.

The third and fourth heart sounds (S3 and S4, respectively) occur in diastole. S3 is sometimes heard in healthy,
young adults (younger than 35 years) and in pregnant
women. Otherwise, the presence of S3 suggests:
• Heart failure.
• Mitral regurgitation.
• High-cardiac output states.
The presence of S4 indicates a ventricle with decreased compliance (e.g. due to aortic stenosis or hypertension when the ventricle becomes hypertrophied).
HINTS AND TIPS
S3 can be benign or pathological but S4 is always
pathological.

Alterations in sound intensity can indicate disease,
for example:
• S1 is loud in mitral stenosis and soft in mitral
regurgitation.
• S2 is loud in hypertension and soft in aortic stenosis.

Murmurs
Murmurs are caused by turbulent blood flow at a valve
or an abnormal communication within the heart. The
presence of a murmur does not always indicate disease,
and the loudness does not correlate with the severity of
the lesion. The common murmurs that you are likely to
encounter are shown in Fig. 10.8. Many individuals
have benign, innocent murmurs, called flow murmurs.
These typically:
• Are soft, early systolic murmurs.
• Occur in the young or the elderly.
• Occur in conditions with increased cardiac output (e.g.
anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, hypertension, pregnancy).

Abdomen
If there are any signs of heart failure, it may be useful to
palpate the liver. An enlarged liver can occur due to venous congestion in heart failure affecting the right ventricle. In tricuspid regurgitation, the liver may be pulsatile.
The abdominal aorta should also be palpated. This is
performed by placing two hands on the abdomen
around the level of the umbilicus and feeling for the
pulsatile aorta. If it is aneurysmal it will be expansile,
i.e. push your hands apart.

124

Legs
It is important to always check the ankles for pitting oedema, which is a sign of heart failure. Gently press on
the skin over a bony landmark such as the medial malleolus, and if pitting oedema is present, an imprint of
your finger will be left after you remove it. You should
comment on whether it is unilateral or bilateral and
how far it extends up the legs. In patients who are in
bed, sacral oedema may develop, so it is often useful
to check for that while the patient is leaning forward
for you to auscultate to their lung bases.
Finally, you should palpate all the peripheral pulses,
as described in Chapter 9.

Glossary
Afterload the resistance to the pressure and volume
ejection from the heart.
Asystole absence of contraction. Asystole is when the
heart has stopped beating and is different from ventricular fibrillation where the heart is still contracting, but not in a coordinated manner.
Bradycardia a heart rate <60 bpm.
Cardiac output (CO) the amount of blood pumped
out by the heart every minute, calculated as stroke
volume (SV)  heart rate (HR).
Central venous pressure (CVP) the pressure of blood
in the great veins as they enter the right atrium.
Contractility the strength with which the myocardium
contracts for a given fibre length.
Diastole part of the cardiac cycle where the ventricles
are relaxed and filling.
Ectopic an event occurring at a place other than its normal location, for example ventricular ectopics originate from the ventricles, not the sinoatrial node.
End-diastolic pressure (EDP) the pressure in the ventricle at the end of diastole.
End-diastolic volume (EDV) the amount of blood in
the ventricle at the end of diastole; the greatest
amount found in the ventricle throughout the whole
cardiac cycle.
Ejection fraction the proportion of EDV which is
ejected by contraction.
Infarction tissue death caused by inadequate perfusion.
Laplace relationship a relationship between the tension, pressure and diameter of a container (implied
blood vessel), as tension ¼ diameter  pressure.
Mean arterial pressure (MAP) the average pressure in
the system at any point in time, approximated as
the diastolic pressure þ (1/3  pulse pressure).

Ohm’s law a relationship between resistance, pressure
and flow inside a container (implied blood vessel),
as pressure ¼ flow  resistance.
Perfusion movement of blood through an organ or
tissue.
Preload the degree of ventricular myocyte stretch before contraction. It is determined by the end-diastolic
volume.
Sinus rhythm a rhythm under direct control from the
sinoatrial node.
Sphygmomanometer a device used for measuring
blood pressure.
Starling’s law a phenomenon whereby the heart
increases its output by increasing its strength of
contraction when the fibres of the myocardium are
stretched.
Stroke volume (SV) the amount of blood ejected from
the left ventricle with each beat.
Stroke work (SW) the amount of external energy
expended in one ventricular contraction. SW is the
arterial pressure (AP) multiplied by the SV.
Syncope temporary loss of consciousness from reduced blood flow to the brain.
Systemic vascular resistance (SVR) the resistance to
blood flow offered by all of the systemic vasculature,
excluding the pulmonary vasculature. It is calculated
as (MAP–right atrial pressure) / CO.
Systole part of the cardiac cycle where the ventricles are
contracting.
Tachycardia a heart rate >100 bpm.
Total peripheral resistance (TPR) the resistance to the
flow of blood in the whole system. It is calculated as
arterial pressure / cardiac output.

PREFACE
Paediatrics is a fascinating and multifaceted speciality. As well as dealing with the
standard medical conditions that arise in children, it covers neonatology and the preterm infant (often newcomers to a neonatal intensive care unit see it as ‘another world’),
genetics, ethics, child development, child protection, and child and adolescent psychiatry. During the short medical student paediatric attachments, and in the era of decreasing hours of work for junior doctors, the exposure to the diverse range of paediatric
conditions is limited.
In the 100 cases that follow, we have tried to cover the majority of the key areas in paediatrics. We have tackled problems that arise in different settings, such as primary care, and
emergency departments, paediatric outpatients, the paediatric ward and the maternity and
neonatal intensive care units. We hope to have done so in a way that is interesting and
that brings the cases alive. After reading through the case and questions, the reader should
carefully consider their answer and ideally commit their thoughts to paper, prior to looking at the answers over the page. We have also tried to demonstrate how a senior paediatrician would approach and work their way through the clinical problem and to explain
some underlying principles in a way that will help cement understanding and knowledge.
The book is aimed at medical students, foundation year doctors doing paediatrics and
junior doctors studying for their MRCPCH. We hope that these cases will be enjoyable
and that they will keep the ‘grey cells’ stimulated!

RESPIRATORY
CASE 1: AN INFANT WITH NOISY BREATHING
History
Mohammed is a 3-month-old boy, brought to a paediatric rapid referral clinic because of
persistent noisy breathing. He was born in the UK at term after an uneventful pregnancy and
is the fifth child of non-consanguineous Somalian parents. His birth weight was 3.7 kg (75th
centile). Since he was a few weeks old, he has had noisy breathing, which hasn’t affected his
feeding, and his parents were repeatedly reassured that it would get better. He has continued
to have intermittent noisy breathing, especially when agitated, and sometimes during sleep.
Over the last few days, his breathing has been noisier than usual. Otherwise he has been well
without any fevers. All of his siblings have recently had coughs and colds.
Examination
He is active and smiles responsively. Oxygen saturations are 95 per cent in air and his
temperature is 36.9ºC. He is coryzal and has intermittent stridor. There is a small ‘strawberry’ haemangioma on his forehead. Respiratory rate is 45/min, there is subcostal recession and mild tracheal tug. Air entry is symmetrical in the chest, with no crackles or
wheeze. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. His weight is 6.7 kg (75th centile).
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of his stridor?
• What other important diagnoses need to be considered?
• How can the diagnosis be confirmed?

1

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 1
Stridor is an inspiratory sound due to narrowing of the upper airway. Mohammed is most
likely to have stridor due to laryngomalacia. This means that the laryngeal cartilage is soft
and floppy, with an abnormal epiglottis and/or arytenoid cartilages. The larynx collapses
and narrows during inspiration (when there is a negative intrathoracic pressure), resulting in
inspiratory stridor. It is usually a benign condition with noisy breathing but no major problems with feeding or significant respiratory distress. Most cases resolve spontaneously within
a year as the larynx grows and the cartilaginous rings stiffen. The reason Mohammed now
has respiratory distress is that he has an intercurrent viral upper respiratory tract infection.
A very important diagnosis to consider in this boy is a haemangioma in the upper airway.
The majority of haemangiomas are single cutaneous lesions, but they can also occur at
other sites and the upper airway is one position where they can enlarge with potentially
life-threatening consequences. The presence of one haemangioma increases the likelihood
of a second one. This boy should be referred for assessment by an ENT surgeon.
There are many other possible congenital causes of stridor which affect the structure or
function of the upper airway. Infectious causes of stridor, such as croup and epiglottitis,
are very rare in this age group.

The diagnosis of laryngomalacia can be confirmed by visualization of the larynx using
flexible laryngoscopy. This can be done by an ENT surgeon as an outpatient procedure.
This demonstrates prolapse over the airway of an omega-shaped epiglottis or arytenoid
cartilages. Congenital structural abnormalities may also be seen. Lesions below the vocal
cords may require bronchoscopy, CT or an MRI scan for diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

• The commonest cause of congenital stridor is laryngomalacia.
• Laryngomalacia can be exacerbated by intercurrent respiratory infections.

CASE 2:

A CHILD WITH NOISY BREATHING

History
Ewa is a 4-year-old child who presents to the ED with a sudden onset of noisy breathing.
She has had a runny nose for 2 days, a cough for 1 day and developed noisy breathing
3 hours earlier. Her mother feels that she is getting progressively more breathless. Her father
had a cold the previous week. She is otherwise well but has troublesome eczema which is
treated with emulsifiers and steroid creams. Her mother states that she is allergic to peanuts,
as they lead to a deterioration of the eczema within 1–2 hours. She avoids peanuts and all
types of nuts. She is fully immunized. Her 8-year-old sister has asthma.
Examination
Oxygen saturation is 89 per cent in air. Her temperature is 38.0C. There is loud noisy breathing, mainly on inspiration. Her respiratory rate is 52/min with supracostal and intercostal
recession. On auscultation, there are no crackles or wheezes. There are no other signs.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the treatment?

3

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 2
The most likely diagnosis is laryngotracheobronchitis (croup). This child has stridor, which
is an inspiratory sound secondary to narrowing of the upper airway. In contrast, wheeze
is an expiratory sound caused by narrowing of the lower airways. The effort required to
shift air through the narrowed airway has resulted in tachypnoea and recession.
The upper airway of a child with stridor should not be examined and the child should
not be upset by performing painful procedures such as blood tests. This is because
there is a small risk that this may lead to a deterioration, causing partial obstruction to
progress to complete obstruction and a respiratory arrest.

Differential diagnosis of acute stridor

•
•

Laryngotracheobronchitis
Inhaled foreign body
Anaphylaxis
Epiglottitis
Rare causes include:
– Bacterial tracheitis
– Severe tonsillitis with very large tonsils
– Inhalation of hot gases (e.g. house fire)
– Retropharyngeal abscess

Croup typically occurs in children aged 6 months to 5 years. It is characterized by an
upper respiratory tract infection that is followed by a barking-type cough, a hoarse
voice, stridor and a low-grade fever. Croup is most commonly caused by the parainfluenza virus.
When a foreign body is inhaled, there is usually a history of sudden coughing and/or choking in a child that was previously well. There may be accompanying cyanosis. The foreign
body is usually a food (e.g. peanut) but may be a small toy. On examination there may be a
unilateral wheeze with decreased air entry on one side.
This case is not typical of anaphylaxis, in that there is no history of the child having
had peanuts. Nor are there features that often accompany anaphylaxis, such as an itchy
urticarial rash, facial swelling, vomiting, wheeze or hypotension.
Epiglottitis would be very unlikely in a fully immunized child who would have received
the Haemophilus influenzae vaccine.
Initial management deals with the ABC. As the oxygen saturation is low, high-flow 100
per cent oxygen will be needed to elevate the saturation to 95 per cent.
The first step in the treatment of croup is oral dexamethasone. A less frequently used
alternative is nebulized budesonide. If 2–3 hours later the child has improved and the
oxygen saturation is 95 per cent in air, the child can be discharged. In some cases
a further dose of steroids can be administered 12–24 hours later. If the child deteriorates then nebulized adrenaline can be administered. If adrenaline is required then senior
help and an anaesthetist should be summoned urgently. If the child deteriorates further
(increasing tachypnoea, recession and exhaustion) then intubation and ventilation are
4

Respiratory

required to secure the airway and to prevent hypoxia and its sequelae. If intubation is
unsuccessful, an ENT surgeon will be required to perform an emergency tracheostomy.

KEY POINTS

• Stridor is due to upper airway obstruction.
• The upper airway of a child with stridor should not be examined as this may
precipitate total obstruction.

• Laryngotracheobronchitis is the commonest cause of acute stridor.

CASE 3:

A CHESTY INFANT

History
Max is a 3-month-old boy seen in the community by his GP. He developed a runny nose
and bit of a cough 2 days ago but has become progressively more chesty and has now
gone off his feeds and is having far fewer wet nappies. He has two older siblings who
also have colds. He was born at 34 weeks’ gestation but had no significant neonatal
problems and went home at 2 weeks of age. Both parents smoke but not in the house.
His mother had asthma as a child.
Examination
Max is miserable but alert. His airway is clear. He is febrile (37.8C) and has copious clear
nasal secretions and a dry wheezy cough. His respiratory rate is 56 breaths/min with tracheal tug and intercostal and subcostal recession. On auscultation, there are widespread
fine crackles and expiratory wheeze. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the commonest causative organism?
• What are the indications for referral to hospital?
• What is the management in hospital?

7

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 3
This baby has the characteristic clinical features of acute bronchiolitis – a seasonal viral
illness occurring from early autumn to spring, principally affecting infants.
The commonest causative organism is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is responsible for about 80 per cent of infections. In hospital, a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) may
be sent for viral immunofluorescence, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture. This is
largely for infection control and epidemiology and does not affect acute management.
Around 2–3 per cent of all infants are admitted each year with RSV-positive bronchiolitis
but many more are managed at home. Prevention is possible with monoclonal RSV immunoglobulin (Palivizumab) but this is reserved for high-risk infants, e.g. oxygen-dependent
survivors of prematurity, as it is extremely expensive. There is no immunization.

!

Indications for hospital referral

• Apnoeic episodes (commonest in babies 2 months and may be the presenting
feature)

• Intake 50 per cent of normal in preceding 24 hours
• Cyanosis
• Severe respiratory distress – grunting, nasal flaring, severe recession, respiratory
rate 70/min

• Congenital heart disease, pre-existing lung disease or immunodeficiency
• Significant hypotonia, e.g. trisomy 21 – less likely to cope with respiratory
compromise

• Survivor of extreme prematurity
• Social factors

Babies usually deteriorate over the first 48–72 hours. Hence there is a low threshold for
admitting any baby 2 months of age on day 1–2 of their illness as they may deteriorate and become exhausted and apnoeic.
Management is supportive. Investigations are rarely indicated apart from an NPA.
A chest X-ray is only needed if the clinical course is unusual and often leads to unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions. Blood tests are only required if there is diagnostic uncertainty, e.g. if the infant has a temperature 39C and a superadded bacterial respiratory
infection is suspected. Oxygen saturations should be kept at 92 per cent and the
infant should be nasogastrically fed if they cannot maintain 50 per cent of normal
intake. Intravenous fluids are used in severe cases. All fluids are restricted to two-thirds
of maintenance. Nasal and oral suction is helpful. There is no evidence that bronchodilators, oral or inhaled steroids modify the clinical course or any important outcomes
such as the need for ventilation or the length of stay. A capillary blood gas should be
checked if the infant is deteriorating. Every season a small proportion of infants need
high-dependency or intensive care – most respond well to continuous positive airways
pressure (CPAP), avoiding the need for intubation.
Babies are discharged when they are well enough to continue recovering at home but
many continue to cough and wheeze for weeks and get similar symptoms with subsequent upper respiratory tract infections. Response to conventional asthma treatment is
8

Respiratory

variable. Leukotriene antagonists may have a role. Exposure to tobacco smoke must be
avoided.

KEY POINTS

• Bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis.
• Numerous well-conducted studies have shown no benefit from any drug intervention
in the acute phase or in the prevention of long-term sequelae.

• Monoclonal RSV immunoglobulin (Palivizumab) may be given for prevention to highrisk infants, but the costs of widespread use outweigh the benefits.

CASE 4:

A CHRONIC COUGH

History
Donna is a 12-year-old girl seen in the GP surgery with her mother. This is her fourth visit
in 3 months. Her initial presentation was with a headache, fever, malaise, a sore throat and
a symmetrical non-pruritic rash on her arms and hands. The lesions varied in size and character, some being simple red macules and others being up to 2 cm in diameter with a central,
slightly dusky centre and a surrounding ‘halo’ of varying erythema. A diagnosis of a viral
infection was made. However, these symptoms progressed to include a cough productive of
white sputum. The computer records show that the emergency GP they consulted at the time
heard some crackles throughout the chest and prescribed a course of clarithromycin. All of
her symptoms have resolved, except for her cough. This is mostly during the day and is
not waking her or her family. However, it is disrupting her life because she is being sent
home from school and her parents have excluded her from sport. It is a spasmodic unproductive cough that comes in bouts, which are occasionally severe enough to cause vomiting.
Another GP gave her a trial of inhaled salbutamol but with no apparent improvement. She
has never had any obvious nasal symptoms. Donna is otherwise well and recently started her
periods. She is fully immunized. Her father has a history of asthma. Her mother smokes but
‘not around the children’. There is no history of recent foreign travel and no family history or
contact with tuberculosis.
Examination
Donna looks well. Her height is on the 91st centile and her weight is on the 75th centile. There has been appropriate weight gain since her illness began. She is not clubbed
or anaemic. She is afebrile. There is no significant lymphadenopathy. Examination of the
ears, nose and throat is normal. Her pulse is 72 beats/min, her heart sounds are normal
and there are no murmurs. Inspection of the chest is normal and her respiratory rate is
18 breaths/min. Expansion, percussion and auscultation are normal. Examination of the
abdomen is unremarkable.

ANSWER 4
Cough is one of the commonest symptoms in childhood and indicates irritation of nerve
receptors within the airway.

!

Differential diagnosis of a recurrent or persistent cough in childhood

• Recurrent viral URTIs – very common in all age groups but more so in infants
and toddlers

• Asthma – unlikely without wheeze or dyspnoea
• Allergic rhinitis – often nocturnal due to ‘post-nasal drip’
• Chronic non-specific cough – probably post-viral with increased cough receptor
sensitivity

• Post-infectious – a ‘pertussis (whooping cough)-like’ illness can continue for
•
•
•
•
•

months following pertussis, adenovirus, mycoplasma and chlamydia
Recurrent aspiration – gastro-oesophageal reflux
Environmental – especially smoking, active or passive
Suppurative lung disease – cystic fibrosis or primary ciliary dyskinesia
Tuberculosis
Habit

Donna is otherwise healthy with no evidence of any chronic disease and she has a normal
chest X-ray. Although her father has asthma, she has no convincing features of atopy and
she did not respond to inhaled salbutamol. The history is not that of recurrent aspiration.
The abrupt onset of symptoms with systemic features suggests infection, and the description of her cough as spasmodic bouts with occasional vomiting is that of a ‘pertussis-like’
illness. This can continue for months following an infection, as can a chronic, non-specific
cough following a viral infection.
The acute history is very typical, although not specific, for Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. This aetiology is supported by the rash, which has the characteristic clinical features
of erythema multiforme (EM). As expected from the name, EM has numerous morphological features but the diagnosis is made on finding the classic target-like papules with an
erythematous outer border, an inner pale ring and a dusky purple to necrotic centre. It is
occasionally mistaken for urticaria, but EM is largely asymptomatic and the lesions do not
fade within 24 hours. Infection, frequently mycoplasma, is one of numerous causes. No
treatment is indicated.
These symptoms cause understandable distress and anxiety and a belief that there must
be something wrong and that treatment is necessary. As in this case, children must have a
thorough clinical evaluation to exclude serious and treatable pathology. This, plus an explanation that they can expect the cough to take months to resolve, is usually adequate to
reassure families. Explore the reasons behind their anxiety and encourage a return to normality knowing that no harm is being done. A watch-and-wait policy is best, resisting any
pressure to investigate further or to try other treatments such as inhaled steroids. The one
thing the family can do is to ban smoking in the house and this could be the spur for her
mother to give up altogether.

KEY POINTS

• Cough is one of the commonest symptoms in childhood and is usually due to viral
respiratory tract infections.

• A chronic cough may indicate a serious disorder and all such children should have a
thorough clinical review to exclude significant pathology.

CASE 5:

RECURRENT CHEST INFECTIONS

History
Conor is a 4-year-old boy who is admitted to the paediatric ward from the A&E department with pneumonia. This is his fourth hospital admission. In the first year of life, he
was admitted twice with bronchiolitis, requiring several days on oxygen, and about 6
months ago he was admitted with pneumonia, again requiring oxygen and intravenous
antibiotics. He has had many courses of oral antibiotics over the last few years from
his GP for chest infections. He also has recurrent abdominal pain and his parents report
large offensive stools. His parents both smoke 20–30 cigarettes/day. He is unimmunized
as his parents are worried about potential side-effects.
Examination
He is small (height ninth centile, weight second centile), pale-looking, miserable and
very clingy to his mother. He has finger clubbing. His temperature is 38.7C, respiratory
rate 40 breaths/min, heart rate 140 beats/min and oxygen saturation 89 per cent in air
(95 per cent in facemask oxygen). There is reduced air entry at the left base with bronchial breath sounds in the left midzone, and coarse crackles are heard on both sides of
the chest. Cardiovascular examination is unremarkable. His abdomen is mildly distended
but non-tender.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 5
The chest radiograph shows consolidation with some collapse of the left lower lobe and
further consolidation in the right middle lobe. There are small bilateral pleural effusions.
These features are consistent with the clinical diagnosis of pneumonia.
The combination of clubbing and recurrent chest infections is strongly suggestive of
cystic fibrosis (CF). This is the commonest cause of clubbing in children in the UK. Normal
immunoglobulins exclude antibody deficiencies such as X-linked hypogammaglobulinaemia. Malabsorption (with bulky, offensive stools) is another common feature of CF.
Cystic fibrosis is an autosomal recessive condition affecting 1 in 2500 children born in
the UK. It is the commonest autosomal recessive disorder in the Caucasian population.
Cystic fibrosis is caused by defects in the gene for the CF transmembrane conductance
regulator (CFTR). This gene encodes for a protein that functions as a chloride channel and
is regulated by cyclic AMP. Cystic fibrosis causes dysfunction of multiple organs – most
prominently lung, intestine, pancreas and liver. Clinical phenotypes of CF can be very
variable, affecting the age at presentation, symptoms and the severity of different organ
involvement. Thus CF should be considered in any of the situations listed below.

!

Presentations of cystic fibrosis
Neonatal

• Meconium ileus
• Intestinal atresia
• Hepatitis/prolonged jaundice

• Rectal prolapse (may be recurrent)
• Failure to thrive
• Malabsorption and vitamin deficiency (A, D, E, K)

Diagnosis can be made by the sweat test, which will demonstrate elevated sweat sodium
and chloride concentrations, and by genetic testing. National newborn screening using
blood spots collected on day 5 of life are now tested for immunoreactive trypsinogen (at
the same time as testing for phenylketonuria, congenital hypothyroidism and sickle cell
disease). This is now leading to the identification of cases before the onset of clinical
disease.
Once a child is diagnosed with CF, he or she will need multidisciplinary team management under the supervision of a paediatric respiratory consultant. Optimal care will aim
to maintain lung function by treating respiratory infections and removing mucus from
16

Respiratory

the airways with physiotherapy, and to maintain adequate growth and nutrition with
pancreatic enzyme and nutritional supplements.
KEY POINTS

• Cystic fibrosis should be considered in children with recurrent chest infections or
malabsorption.

• Cystic fibrosis is the commonest cause of finger clubbing in children.

CASE 6:

A WHEEZY TEENAGER

History
Bradley is a 13-year-old boy who is seen in the A&E department at the request of the GP
out-of-hours service. He is a known asthmatic and this is his third attendance with an acute
wheeze in 3 months. His mother reports that last time he was nearly transferred to the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). He has developed a cold and become acutely breathless and
is using his salbutamol inhaler hourly without much relief. The accompanying letter says
that he is prescribed a beclometasone metered dose inhaler (MDI) 100 µg/metered inhalation 2 puffs b.d., salmeterol MDI 50 µg/metered inhalation 1 puff b.d. and salbutamol MDI
100 µg/metered inhalation p.r.n.
Examination
Bradley is sitting up in bed with a nebulizer in progress containing 5 mg salbutamol. His
oxygen saturation on 15 L of oxygen on arrival is documented as 89 per cent. He is quiet
but able to answer questions with short sentences. His chest is hyperinflated (increased
anteroposterior diameter) and he is using his accessory muscles of respiration. His respiratory rate is 60 breaths/min and he has marked tracheal tug with intercostal and subcostal
recession. On auscultation there is equal but poor air entry with widespread expiratory
wheeze. His temperature is 37.6C. His pulse is 180 beats/min with good perfusion.
Questions
• What is the most likely underlying cause for this acute episode?
• What signs would you look for of impending respiratory failure?
• Outline your management plan for this acute episode
• What should happen before he is discharged?

19

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 6
This boy has another acute exacerbation of asthma. Much the most likely underlying
cause is poor adherence to home treatment. This is common in all age groups but particularly in teenagers with their growing independence and risk-taking behaviour.

!

Signs of impending respiratory failure

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Exhaustion (this is a clinical impression)
Unable to speak or complete sentences
Colour – cyanosis  pallor
Hypoxia despite high-flow humidified oxygen
Restlessness and agitation are signs of hypoxia, especially in small children
Silent chest – so little air entry that no wheeze is audible
Tachycardia
Drowsiness
Peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) persistently 30 per cent of predicted for height
(tables are available) or personal best. Children  7 years cannot perform PEFR
reliably and technique in sick children is often poor

Acute management goals are to correct hypoxia, reverse airway obstruction and prevent progression. Reassurance and calm are crucial because he will be frightened. Give
high-flow oxygen via mask and monitor saturations. Start a regular inhaled β-agonist
(e.g. salbutamol) via a nebulizer. Beta-agonists can be given continuously. If so, cardiac
monitoring is needed as side-effects include irritability, tremor, tachycardia and hypokalaemia. Inhaled ipratropium bromide can be added. Give oral prednisolone or intravenous (IV) hydrocortisone. Frequent clinical review is paramount. Blood gases (capillary
or venous) and a chest X-ray may be required. If there is no improvement or the child
deteriorates, additional treatment is needed. These include IV salbutamol, IV magnesium
sulphate (a smooth muscle relaxant) and IV aminophylline, although the effectiveness of
the latter two is still controversial. His precipitating ‘cold’ is almost certainly viral and
antibiotics are unlikely to be beneficial.
Before discharge a thorough review of his asthma is needed:

• How often does he miss his regular drugs?
• Is there parental supervision?
• What device does he use? Children rarely use MDIs effectively and need a spacer.

•
•
•
•
20

However, he is unlikely to use one because they are cumbersome and not ‘cool’.
Agree an alternative ‘breath-activated’ device with the proviso that, if acutely
wheezy, he must use a spacer.
Consider changing to a combined steroid/long-acting β-agonist inhaler. This should
improve adherence.
Ask about smoking – him and his family. Adults should be encouraged to stop
smoking or to smoke outside.
Educate about allergen avoidance, e.g. daily vacuuming to reduce house dust mites.
Consider measuring total IgE and specific allergen IgE (RAST) if the history suggests
allergies.
All asthmatics should have a written home management plan.

Respiratory

• Provide an asthma symptom diary and arrange hospital follow-up until control
improves. Most children can and should be managed in primary care. Primary care
and hospital-based asthma specialist nurses are very helpful.

KEY POINTS

• The commonest cause of an acute deterioration in chronic asthma is poor adherence
to treatment.

• Home management should be reviewed during any acute admission.

CASE 7:

FEVER AND BREATHLESSNESS

History
Niall is a 3-year-old boy from a travelling family referred to the paediatric day unit by
the out-of-hours GP service. He was seen 4 days ago with a cough and fever and diagnosed with a viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). The following day he returned
and was commenced on oral antibiotics. He is now complaining of tummy ache and has
vomited once. The GP is worried that he is becoming dehydrated and may have a urinary tract infection or intra-abdominal pathology. He has not been immunized but there
is no other medical history of note.
Examination
Niall is miserable, flushed, toxic and febrile (38.8C) with a capillary refill time of 2 s. His
pulse is 140 beats/min, his oxygen saturation is 91 per cent in air and his blood pressure is
85/60 mmHg. He seems to be in pain, especially when he coughs, and his respiratory rate
is 48 breaths/min with nasal flaring. There is dullness to percussion in the right lower zone
posteriorly with decreased breath sounds and bronchial breathing. He seems reluctant to
have his abdomen examined but bowel sounds are normal.

• What is the most likely causative organism?
• What complication may have arisen and how would you confirm it?
• List the steps in management.

23

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 7
The chest X-ray shows loss of the right hemidiaphragm, right lower zone consolidation
and a normal right heart border – the characteristic features of right lower lobe pneumonia. Lower lobe pneumonia should always be on the list of differential diagnoses for
abdominal pain in children. Young children rarely localize pain but observation should
establish whether they have pleuritic pain – they may have shallow breathing or may
simply sit very still, hardly moving the affected side.
The most likely causative organism is Streptococcus pneumoniae. However, a diagnosis
is rarely made from sputum analysis because children tend to swallow their sputum.
Blood cultures may be positive. Children in the UK are immunized against Streptococcus
pneumoniae but not all strains are covered, there is emerging antibiotic resistance and
also ‘failed’ immunizations. Any immunized child with positive cultures should be investigated for an underlying immune problem, including an absent spleen.
Niall has hyponatraemia. There are no pointers to excess sodium loss (e.g. diarrhoea or
significant vomiting) and hence the most likely cause is the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), a known association with pneumonia. The
hyponatraemia is dilutional. First, the result should be confirmed – taking blood from
children can be difficult and unexpected results should be repeated. At the same time,
urine should be sent for osmolality and sodium. His serum osmolality is calculated as
follows:
2  ([Na]  [K])  [urea]  [glucose]  266 mosmol/kg (normal 278–305)
Normally a fall in serum osmolality would suppress antidiuretic hormone secretion to allow
excretion of excess water as dilute urine. In SIADH, urine osmolality is inappropriately high
(320 mosmol/kg) and urine sodium is usually 40 mmol/L (unlike hypovolaemic states
where it is 20 mmol/L).

24

Oxygen to maintain saturation at 92 per cent
Adequate pain relief for pleuritic pain
Intravenous antibiotics according to local guidelines, e.g. co-amoxiclav
Initial fluid restriction to two-thirds maintenance to help correct the hyponatraemia.
Fluid restrict even if no hyponatraemia, as SIADH may still develop
Fluid balance, regular urea and electrolytes – adjust fluids accordingly. Weigh
twice daily
Physiotherapy, e.g. bubble blowing. Encourage mobility
Monitor for development of a pleural effusion. If the chest X-ray is suspicious,
an ultrasound will be diagnostic. If present, a longer course of antibiotics is
recommended to prevent empyema (a purulent pleural effusion). A chest drain
may be necessary if there is worsening respiratory distress, mediastinal shift on
the chest X-ray, a large effusion or failure to respond to adequate antibiotics
Ensure adequate nutrition – children have often been anorectic for several days.
Low threshold for supplementary feeds probably via nasogastric tube
Organise immunization programme before discharge
Arrange a follow-up chest X-ray in 6–8 weeks for those with lobar collapse and/
or an effusion. If still abnormal, consider an inhaled foreign body

Respiratory
KEY POINTS

• A lower lobe pneumonia should always be considered in the differential diagnosis of
an acute abdomen in children.

• ‘Vaccine failures’ should be investigated for an underlying immune problem.

CASE 8:

A TEENAGER WITH CHEST PAIN

History
Fabio is a 13-year-old boy who presents to outpatients with a 6-month history of chest
pain. The pain can occur at rest or on exercise and is central with no radiation. It lasts for
up to an hour. He occasionally gets palpitations after exercise, which he describes as regular. The pain is not accompanied by light-headedness and he has never fainted. He has no
respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. He had asthma as a child and has a salbutamol
inhaler at home but has had no symptoms in the past few years. There is a family history
of hypertension and his grandfather died of a myocardial infarction a year ago.
Examination
His pulse is 86/min, regular, his blood pressure is 124/82 mmHg and his heart sounds
are normal. There is no hepatomegaly. Femoral pulses are palpable and his chest is clear.
His peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) is 460 L/min (child’s height 1.62 m, PEFR range
320–570 L/min). On palpation there is no chest tenderness.
INVESTIGATIONS
His ECG and chest X-ray are both normal.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis and the differential diagnosis?
• What treatment would you suggest?

27

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 8
The most likely diagnosis in this case is idiopathic chest pain. This is one of the commonest causes of chest pain in children. Psychological chest pain, which may be a replication
of the pain his grandfather used to have, and may be secondary to various stresses such
as bullying, is a further possibility. Costochondritis is due to inflammation of the cartilage
that connects the inner end of each rib with the sternum. There may be tenderness on
palpation of the cartilage in the anterior chest wall and the pain may be worse on movement or coughing. The cause is unknown and the condition is self-limiting.
The lack of respiratory symptoms and signs with the normal PEFR would go against a
respiratory cause. PEFR is related to height, and charts with normal values exist. Children
have to be 5 or more years of age in order to perform this test in an effective and consistent manner, and normally the best reading out of three is obtained. Pneumonia with
pleurisy is a common cause of chest pain that is typically worse on inspiration. In the
case of a pneumothorax, the pain is sudden and associated with shortness of breath. A
severe cough from whatever cause can lead to musculoskeletal chest pain.
The lack of gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting would go against gastrooesophageal reflux. Cardiac disease is a rare cause of chest pain in children. The palpitations described are probably secondary to tachycardia during exercise.

Pulmonary causes are a further common cause of chest pain.
Cardiac disease is a rare cause of chest pain in children.
A chest X-ray and ECG should be done to rule out significant pathology.

CARDIOLOGY
CASE 9:

A CYANOSED NEWBORN

A 5-hour-old male newborn on the postnatal ward is noticed by the midwife because
he looks blue around the lips and tongue. He is the first child of a 27-year-old mother
with asthma who was taking inhaled steroids throughout pregnancy. Antenatal scans
were unremarkable. She went into spontaneous labour at 41 weeks and there was thin
meconium staining of the liquor when the membranes ruptured 1 hour before delivery.
Cardiotocograph monitoring during labour revealed normal variability of fetal heart rate.
The baby was born by normal vaginal delivery and weighed 3.3 kg. The Apgar scores
were 7 at 1 min and 8 at 5 min.

Examination
The baby is not dysmorphic. His temperature is 36.6C and his central capillary refill
time is 2 s. His lips, tongue and extremities are cyanosed. He is crying normally and has
no signs of increased respiratory effort. Heart rate is 160 beats/min, femoral pulses are
palpable, heart sounds are normal and no murmur is audible. Oxygen saturation is 70
per cent in air and does not rise with facial oxygen, which has been administered by the
midwife. There is no hepatosplenomegaly.

29

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 9
This baby is most likely to have transposition of the great arteries. There are few congenital cyanotic heart conditions that present on the first day of life, because in most
cases the ductus arteriosus remains open at this stage, maintaining pulmonary blood
flow in conditions such as pulmonary and tricuspid atresia where pulmonary blood flow
would be severely restricted or absent. Severe Ebstein’s anomaly and obstructed total
anomalous pulmonary venous drainage can produce early cyanosis, but these conditions
are associated with significant respiratory distress. Persistent fetal circulation also results
in cyanosis, usually with respiratory distress in the context of a newborn who has suffered a significant hypoxic, hypothermic or hypoglycaemic insult, who has pulmonary
hypoplasia or sepsis, or sometimes for unknown reasons.
Transposition of the great arteries accounts for up to 5 per cent of congenital heart disease and is the commonest cardiological cause of cyanosis in the newborn. The aorta
and pulmonary arteries are transposed such that the right ventricle delivers deoxygenated blood, returning from the systemic circulation, into the aorta and back to the
systemic circulation. The left ventricle delivers oxygenated blood, arriving from the
lungs, into the pulmonary arteries and back to the lungs. These two parallel circulations would result in the vital organs never receiving oxygenated blood, and hence rapid
death, if it was not for mixing in the atria via the foramen ovale and between the aorta
and pulmonary arteries via the ductus arteriosus. Chest X-ray may show a narrowed
upper mediastinum due to the abnormal position of the aorta and pulmonary arteries.
Echocardiography by an experienced operator is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
The hyperoxia test provides a means of diagnosing whether cyanosis is due to cardiac
or respiratory disease. Normally arterial PaO2 is greater than 9 kPa and rises to more than
20 kPa after exposure to 90–100 per cent oxygen. If the PaO2 fails to rise, this is strongly
suggestive of cyanotic heart disease. Persistent fetal circulation can also result in a lack
of response. There is already evidence of tissue hypoxia in this case, as there is a metabolic acidosis.
Emergency management involves commencing a prostaglandin infusion to maintain
patency of the ductus arteriosus, and to correct the metabolic acidosis. An emergency
balloon atrial septostomy will probably be needed to improve mixing of oxygenated and
deoxygenated blood at the atrial level. Ultimately, an arterial switch operation will need
to be performed to provide an anatomical correction.

KEY POINTS

• Measure oxygen saturations if you have any suspicion that a baby may be cyanosed.
• The absence of a murmur does not exclude congenital heart disease.

CASE 10:

A SHOCKED NEONATE

History
Freddie is 3 days old. He is brought by ambulance to the resuscitation room in A&E.
He was found in his cot this morning looking mottled and breathing very fast. He had
been well until yesterday when he did not feed as well as usual. He was born at 39
weeks’ gestation by normal vaginal delivery in a midwife-led birthing unit and was discharged home the same day. There was no prolonged rupture of membranes and he did
not require any resuscitation at birth. He has been exclusively breast-fed. He did not
receive vitamin K due to parental objection.
Examination
Freddie is grunting and has a respiratory rate of 70/min with subcostal, intercostal
and sternal recession. His lung fields sound clear. Oxygen saturation monitoring does
not pick up a trace. He looks mottled, cyanosed peripherally and his limbs feel cold.
Capillary refill time is 5 s, heart rate is 180/min, blood pressure is unrecordable, and the
femoral pulses cannot be felt. The heart sounds are unremarkable. The liver edge is palpable 3 cm below the costal margin and his temperature is 35.0C.

• What is the most likely diagnosis and what is the differential?
• What is the initial management of a collapsed neonate?

31

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 10
The pH is 7.01, which is a severe acidosis. The PaCO2 is normal, so the acidosis is not
respiratory in origin. The low bicarbonate and large negative base excess indicate that
this is a metabolic acidosis. There is also a degree of hypoxaemia. The baby’s circulation
is so poor that pulses are not palpable, the saturation meter cannot pick up a pulse trace
and a severe metabolic acidosis has developed due to hypoperfusion.
This is most likely to be a case of cardiogenic shock due to a congenital left heart
obstructive lesion. The clues are in the age of the baby and the absence of the femoral
pulses. Left-sided obstructive cardiac lesions rely on the ductus arteriosus to perfuse the
systemic circulation by passage of blood from the pulmonary arteries into the distal end
of the aortic arch. As the ductus arteriosus closes, the systemic perfusion becomes dramatically reduced, resulting in collapse and shock. Freddie actually had hypoplastic left
heart syndrome (HLHS). The absence of a murmur does not rule out a cardiac cause, and
murmurs are not always present in HLHS.

Lung disorder – e.g. congenital diaphragmatic hernia (late presentation)
Metabolic – e.g. propionic acidaemia, methylmalonic acidaemia
Endocrine – e.g. panhypopituitarism

In any collapsed neonate, it is essential to adopt a standard approach to resuscitation.
The airway should be maintained, high-flow oxygen administered, intravenous access
obtained and fluid resuscitation should be given for the shock. Blood glucose measurement must be checked early and corrected if low. A blood gas sample should be analysed.
Intravenous antibiotics should be given promptly as sepsis is a possible treatable cause. If
there is any suspicion of a duct-dependent cardiac lesion, a prostaglandin infusion should
be commenced, as this is life-saving. Early involvement of senior paediatricians, an
anaesthetic team and paediatric intensive care services will help appropriate management.
KEY POINTS

• Congenital cardiac disease can present as shock in a neonate after several days.
• The absence of a murmur does not rule out congenital heart disease.
• A prostaglandin infusion can maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus and can be
life-saving.

Questions

33

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 11
The ECG shows a narrow QRS complex tachycardia with a rate of approximately 220
beats/min. There are no P waves.
The diagnosis is supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). This is the commonest pathological
arrhythmia in childhood (sinus arrhythmia is a normal variant). Diagnosis is based on
the presence of a narrow QRS complex tachycardia. P waves are only visible in about
half of cases. It is usually secondary to a re-entrant tachycardia using an accessory pathway. It is also associated with the Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome (see Fig. 11.2). This
condition can be diagnosed by a short PR interval and a slow upstroke of the QRS (delta
wave). These are normally only seen when the patient does not have a tachycardia.

Figure 11.2 Intermittent pre-excitation in Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome. The first two beats
show the short PR interval and delta wave. The middle two beats are normal and the abnormality
returns in the final two beats. (Reproduced with permission from Worrell DA, ed, Oxford
Textbook of Medicine, 2003, Oxford University Press.)

The heart rate in SVT is typically 200–300 beats/min. Arrhythmias can last from a few seconds
to days. In older children, they can be associated with palpitations, light-headedness and
chest discomfort. However, in young infants, the inability to report symptoms may lead
to presentation with heart failure and shock, as in this case. In a third of cases there is
associated congenital heart disease so an echocardiogram should be performed. Supraventricular tachycardia needs to be differentiated from sinus tachycardia. In the latter,
the heart rate is usually 220 beats/min, there is greater variability in the heart rate and
there is often a history consistent with shock.

Cardiology

Initial treatment in this emergency follows the standard resuscitation guidelines and the
baby should be administered oxygen. Capillary refill is slightly prolonged but should
improve swiftly following the correction of the tachycardia.
Specific treatment comprises vagal stimulation, for instance by eliciting the ‘diving reflex’
which will increase vagal tone, slow atrioventricular conduction and abort the tachycardia. This can be done by placing a rubber glove filled with iced water over the baby’s
face. If this fails, the baby’s face can be immersed in iced water for 5 s. Second-line treatment comprises intravenous adenosine that can be administered in escalating doses. If
this fails, synchronized DC cardioversion will almost always stop the tachycardia. Once
sinus rhythm is achieved, maintenance treatment using drugs such as amiodarone should
be started following consultation with a cardiologist. Infants (1 year old) with SVT are
less likely to relapse than older children. They are often treated for 1 year, following
which the medication is slowly tapered. In the majority of cases, the SVT does not recur.
Definitive treatment comprises catheterization with radiofrequency ablation.

KEY POINTS

• SVT is the commonest pathological arrhythmia in childhood.
• It can lead to heart failure and shock.
• Treatments comprise vagal manoeuvres, adenosine and DC cardioversion.

CASE 12:

AN INCIDENTAL MURMUR

History
Lola is a 3-year-old girl referred to outpatients by her GP, who heard a murmur when she
presented to him with a fever and a cough. Looking through her notes, the murmur was not
heard at her 6-week check and she has only been seen twice since, with minor infections. He
brought her back a week later to listen again, the murmur was still present and he has referred
her on. She is otherwise entirely healthy with no significant past medical or family history.
Examination
Lola looks generally healthy and her height and weight are on the 75th centiles. She is
not clinically anaemic, jaundiced or cyanosed. Her pulse is 88/min and her blood pressure
90/50 mmHg. She has normal femoral pulses. Examination of the praecordium shows no
thrills but there is a heave at the lower left sternal border. The apex beat is in the fifth intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Both heart sounds are present but the pulmonary component of the second sound is quiet. There is a click immediately after the first heart sound
and an ejection systolic murmur which is heard loudest in the pulmonary area. This radiates
into both lung fields and is heard in the back between the scapulae. Examination of the respiratory and abdominal systems is normal with no hepatomegaly.
INVESTIGATIONS
Lola’s electrocardiogram is shown in Figure 12.1.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 12
Up to 40 per cent of children will have a murmur heard at some time during childhood,
particularly if examined at a time of high cardiac output – e.g. fever, anaemia or anxiety.
These ‘innocent’ murmurs have certain reassuring features and the heart is structurally
normal. It is good practice to re-examine asymptomatic healthy children 1–2 weeks later
when they are well. If the murmur persists, they should be referred. That it was not heard
at the 6-week check is irrelevant – murmurs in children are often difficult to hear. A murmur can be diagnosed as innocent on the basis of the certain clinical findings (see box).

!

Clinical findings in innocent murmurs

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Asymptomatic
No thrills or heaves
Normal heart sounds, normally split with no added clicks
Quiet and soft
Systolic (isolated diastolic murmurs are never innocent)
Short, ejection (pansystolic murmurs are pathological)
Single site with no radiation to neck, lung fields or back
Varies with posture (decreases or disappears when patient sits up, loudest when
they’re lying)

Further investigations are rarely indicated. Nevertheless parents are understandably anxious and must be reassured that an innocent murmur is simply a ‘noise’. It may never
disappear but this does not matter because the heart is normal. All other murmurs should
be investigated. However, a normal ECG and chest X-ray do not exclude pathology. An
echocardiogram is the definitive test.
The findings are characteristic of moderate pulmonary valve stenosis (PS). This is common, accounting for 7–10 per cent of all congenital heart defects. Unless the stenosis
is severe, children are otherwise healthy and asymptomatic. An ‘opening’ click may be
heard at the beginning of systole. With increasing severity, the clinical features change
to reflect the progressive narrowing and the resulting right ventricular hypertrophy
(RVH). The pulmonary component of the second heart sound diminishes and a lower left
sternal heave develops. In severe PS there may be evidence of right-sided heart failure
with hepatomegaly.
The ECG will show the same progression. This child's ECG shows right axis deviation and
evidence of RVH (an ‘R' in V1 > 20 millimetres, an ‘S' in V6 > 5 millimetres and upright
T waves across all the right precordial leads).
She needs an echocardiogram to:

• confirm the clinical diagnosis
• assess severity to guide further investigation and treatment
• exclude any associated cardiac lesions, e.g. ventricular septal defect.
Doppler echocardiography measures velocity across the valve – the higher this is, the greater
the need for intervention. Catheter balloon valvuloplasty is the treatment of choice in the
38

Cardiology

majority and the outcomes are good. Milder degrees of PS need regular re-evaluation to
monitor any progression. Antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent infective endocarditis is no longer
recommended in this condition.

KEY POINTS

•

Cardiac murmurs are heard at some time in up to 40 per cent of children.

CASE 13:

A FUNNY TURN

Sian is a 15-year-old girl, referred to paediatric outpatients by her GP. The letter says,
‘Thank you for seeing this girl who has had her first fit.’ Three weeks ago she was at
school when the fire alarm went off unexpectedly. She felt faint and clammy. Friends
tried to help her to walk out of the classroom, but after about a minute she collapsed to
the floor and had a brief episode of jerking movements affecting all four limbs. There
was no incontinence or tongue biting. She regained consciousness within a minute but
continued to feel weak for a few hours afterwards.
Sian had a febrile convulsion at 18 months of age and she has fainted on about five occasions, mostly in emotional situations or when it has been hot. She describes herself as an
anxious girl, and has a sensation of her heart racing every few weeks. She has never been
in hospital, but has seen her GP for heavy periods. There is no family history of epilepsy,
but her aunt collapsed and died at the age of 28 in Canada. She is top of her year at school
and hopes to be a doctor or lawyer.

Examination
Her height is 170 cm (91st centile) and her weight is 53kg (50 th). Cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and neurological examinations are normal.
Questions
• What are the possible causes of her collapse?
• What is the most important investigation to perform at this stage?

41

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 13

!

Causes of a funny turn
Distinguishing features in the history
Epileptic seizure
Cardiac arrhythmia
Neurally mediated syncope
Panic attack
Breath-holding attack
Reflex anoxic seizure
Pseudoseizures

Aura, incontinence, tongue biting, family history
Palpitations, sudden collapse, exercise-related
Preceding stimulus, dizziness, nausea
Hyperventilation, paraesthesia, carpopedal spasm
Usually a toddler, upset/crying
Usually infant/toddler, painful stimulus
Psychological problems

Other causes
Hypoglycaemia
Other metabolic derangements
Drugs, alcohol

In this case, the history is most suggestive of a neurally mediated (vasovagal) syncope,
a cardiac arrhythmia or perhaps a panic attack. The history is less typical of an epileptic
seizure, and the most likely reason for the brief convulsion is hypoperfusion of the brain
due to low blood pressure while her friends held her upright – an anoxic seizure. This
terminated quickly when she was supine after collapsing.
The single most important investigation is an ECG, as this may show a potentially lifethreatening cardiac cause. An EEG is generally not performed after a first seizure because
it may be normal in those who go on to have epilepsy and abnormal in those who never
have another seizure, with the EEG adding little to prognosis at this stage. Blood tests
are often performed for glucose, electrolytes, calcium and magnesium, but are frequently
unhelpful. Sian’s ECG is shown in Figure 13.1.

II

Figure 13.1 Sian’s electrocardiogram.

Her ECG shows a prolonged corrected QT interval, making the diagnosis of a long QT
syndrome. This disorder has a number of genetic causes, and in some cases an arrhythmia
can be precipitated by a sudden loud noise. This girl went on to require anti-arrhythmic
drug treatment and an implantable cardiodefibrillator.
The QT interval is measured from the start of the QRS complex to the end of the T-wave;
the QT interval is corrected (QTc) for heart rate by: QTc  QT/(冑R – R interval). QTc is
normally around 0.41 s and should be less than 0.45 s. In this case it is 0.52 s.
42

Cardiology
KEY POINTS

• The commonest cause of fainting in a teenager is neurally mediated (vasovagal)
syncope.

• Cardiac causes should always be considered in the differential of epilepsy and
funny turns.

• An ECG is almost always indicated.

A THIRSTY BOY

History
Steven is a 4-year-old boy seen in the paediatric day unit with a 2-week history of polydipsia
and polyuria. Having been dry at night for some time, he has also started wetting the bed.
His mother thinks that he has lost some weight. He has been less cheerful than usual and
hasn’t wanted to go to school – his mother has put this down to tiredness at the end of his
first term. She and her mother have hypothyroidism. There is no significant past medical
history and he is fully immunized. He has a 2-year-old brother who is well.
Examination
Steven is playing happily in the playroom. His weight is on the 9th centile and his height
is on the 50th centile. His trousers are a bit loose round his waist. He is afebrile. He is not

Questions

• List the topics that need to be discussed with his family?

45

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 14
The diagnosis is type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), by far the commonest form of diabetes in
childhood characterized by pancreatic β-cell dysfunction with insulin deficiency. The precise
mechanism is not understood, but environmental factors probably ‘trigger’ a T-cell-mediated
autoimmune process in those genetically susceptible (although only about 10 per cent have
a family history at presentation). There may be a history of other autoimmune diseases. The
incidence is rising. The incidence of type 2 is also rising alongside obesity.
Although this boy has ketonuria, he is not acidotic and does not have diabetic ketoacidosis
(DKA) – a widely accepted biochemical definition being a pH 7.30 and/or a bicarbonate
15 mmol/L. Nor is he vomiting or showing signs of sepsis. Therefore he does not need
intravenous fluids or intravenous insulin. Only about 10–20 per cent of children present
with DKA, usually pre-school children in whom the diagnosis has not been considered.
Childhood DKA has a mortality rate of approximately 0.2 per cent, usually from cerebral
oedema due to the use of excessive fluids and/or rapid changes in blood glucose.
He now needs to start regular subcutaneous insulin. Current best practice suggests that
insulin is best delivered by a ‘basal bolus’ regime – background ‘basal’ insulin given
once daily with rapid-acting ‘bolus’ insulin at mealtimes. Alternatives are twice-daily
injections of pre-mixed long and rapidly acting insulins or insulin via a pump.
The impact of the diagnosis of T1DM should never be underestimated (see Case 87,
p. 255 in relation to the breaking of bad news to families). At diagnosis, he and his family will start a detailed education programme. Education is provided by a multidisciplinary team, including specialist nurses and dieticians. The aspects of management that
need to be discussed include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

how to give insulin – to a probably reluctant 4-year-old
regular finger-prick blood testing – up to four times daily
interpreting blood glucose results and altering insulin
recognition and treatment of hypoglycaemia – ‘hypos’ really worry parents and older
patients, especially at night
management during intercurrent illness, e.g. flu
blood or urine ketone estimations
who to contact in an emergency
diet – matching insulin to carbohydrate in a ‘basal-bolus’ regime
school – trusting staff in everyday care
peer group relationships – diabetes risks making children feel ‘different’
exercise
the ‘honeymoon’ period
long-term complications – discuss even at outset because many families know about
and fear complications and need objective information
using glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) to measure overall control
membership of local and/or national support groups.
KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•
46

The cardinal features of type 1 diabetes are polydypsia and polyuria.
Most patients do not present in DKA.
Patients with DKA are acidotic (pH  7.30) as well as having ketonuria.
Education and support from a multidisciplinary specialist team are crucial.

CASE 15:

A TALL BOY

History
Zak is a 10-year-old boy referred to outpatients by his GP with tall stature. He is seen with
his 28-year-old mother who is not particularly concerned because his 29-year-old father
is 1.93 m, although he does not come from a tall family himself. However, friends and
family have begun to comment and the parents are seeking reassurance. When asked, the
boy admits that he is self-conscious about his stature and is fed up with being treated as
older than his true age. At school, everyone expects him to take more responsibility than
he thinks is fair. He is otherwise healthy although he was seen in infancy with a cardiac
murmur that was thought to be innocent. He did not have an echocardiogram. He is doing
well academically at school. His 7-year-old sister is apparently on the 75th percentile for
height. His mother is measured in clinic and is 1.66 m tall. This puts her between the 50th
and 75th centiles for a female.
Examination
Zak is tall and slender. His height is 1.58 m (99.6th centile) and weight 35 kg (75th centile). His arm span is 168 cm. He has long, tapering fingers and his thumb, when completely
opposed within the clenched hand, projects beyond the ulnar border. He has pectus excavatum (funnel chest) but an otherwise normal respiratory examination. He has a midsystolic
click with a late systolic murmur heard at the apex. Examination of the abdomen is normal
and he is prepubertal.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What further investigations does he need?
• Who else should be examined and by whom?

47

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 15
The most likely diagnosis is the connective tissue disease Marfan syndrome. This is an
inherited synthetic disorder of fibrillin-1, a glycoprotein constituent of the microfibrils
of elastic fibres that anchor non-elastic tissue such as the aortic adventitia and the suspensory ligament of the eye.
By definition, tall stature includes all children with a length or height above the 98th
centile. However, uncovering pathology in such children is rare and the vast majority
have simple familial tall stature. This is characterized by a normal physical examination
and serial height measurements that show no growth acceleration. Skeletal age (assessed
by a bone age X-ray of the wrist) is usually slightly advanced in relation to chronological age, the child enters puberty relatively (not abnormally) early and completes their
growth phase relatively early, with a final height within the expected range for their
family. The differential diagnosis of familial tall stature is a syndrome associated with
tall stature, such as Marfan or Klinefelter (47, XXY) syndrome, or a child with growth
acceleration for which an endocrine cause is likely, e.g. sexual precocity, thyrotoxicosis
or growth hormone excess. Children with familial tall stature rarely benefit from further
investigations or monitoring.
The diagnosis of Marfan syndrome is made on accepted clinical criteria – only about
60–70 per cent of patients who fulfil these have an identifiable mutation in the fibrillin
gene. This boy displays many of the musculoskeletal features – arm span to height ratio
1.05, arachnodactyly with a positive thumb sign and pectus excavatum – but many
other systems may be involved. Most important are the eyes and heart. Lens dislocation is one of the major criteria for diagnosis and he needs a slit-lamp examination. His
murmur is typical of mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and echocardiography is essential for
diagnosis and to monitor the high risk of progressive aortic root dilatation.
Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder, although about 30 per cent arise
sporadically. There is the distinct possibility that this boy has inherited it from his father,
who is unusually tall for his family and should be investigated. There is significant morbidity and reduced longevity, mainly from the cardiovascular complications, but young
adults like him may still be asymptomatic. However, making such a diagnosis will have
far-reaching social, financial and psychological consequences for an individual and their
family. Referral to the genetics team is mandatory: first, to obtain informed consent for
investigations; second, to confirm the diagnosis; and third, to counsel about recurrence
and inheritance risk – in Marfan this is 50 per cent. Refuting a diagnosis is obviously
just as important in uncertain cases and the geneticists are best placed to do so.

KEY POINTS

• Pathological causes of tall stature are rare.
• Families who may have serious inheritable disorders must be referred to genetics
teams for diagnosis and counselling.

CASE 16:

A SHORT GIRL

History
Tanya is a 4-year-old girl brought to the GP by her mother, who is worried about her
daughter’s growth. She has noticed that her shoe size has not changed for almost 12
months and she is still in clothes for a 2- to 3-year-old. She was born at 38 weeks by
normal delivery and weighed 2.1 kg (9th centile). Her mother tried breast-feeding but
she was never easy to feed, even with a bottle. She is generally healthy, apart from
recurrent ear infections that have needed grommet insertion. She wears glasses for longsightedness. Her development is normal, although nursery staff have reported that she
seems to have poor concentration.
Examination
She is generally healthy and certainly well nourished. The GP notices wide-spaced
nipples and a low hairline but can find no other obvious abnormalities. She creates a
growth chart from her own and the mother’s records (Fig. 16.1).

Questions
• How did the GP plot the parents’ heights?
• What are the clinical signs that suggest a pathological cause for short stature?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?

51

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 16
Plotting the parents’ centiles establishes whether a child falls into the expected height
range for their family. Both parents should be measured, but realistically this is often
difficult. To plot the father’s centile on a girls’ chart, 14 cm is subtracted from his
height, and on a boys’ chart the same measurement is added to the mother’s height.
Alternatively, their centile is taken from the relevant chart. The ‘target centile range’ can
also be calculated. This is the midpoint of the two plotted parental centiles 8.5 cm for a
girl and 10 cm for a boy. With normal parents and healthy children, final heights will
be normally distributed within these 95 per cent confidence limits.
Growth is unique to childhood and an excellent tool for confirming health as well as
spotting disease. Children who are healthy grow and gain weight normally and follow
centiles. The challenge in assessing a short child is to pick out those with a pathological
cause from the majority without. Usually there is no one defining feature and pieces of
the clinical jigsaw are put together from the history, examination, growth pattern and
any investigations. A short child following the 0.4th to 2nd centiles from a short family is less worrying than one who is crossing the centiles downwards due to abnormally
slow growth. The causes are numerous – chronic disease (coeliac disease, uncontrolled
asthma), drug effects (steroids), endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, growth hormone
deficiency) and emotional abuse. Thorough clinical assessment is crucial.

!

Clinical signs suggesting a pathological cause for short stature

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Extreme short stature – on or below 0.4th centile.
Short for family size – outside target range for parents
Short and relatively overweight – suggests an endocrinopathy
Short and very underweight – suggests poor nutrition  malabsorption
Growth failure – crossing the centiles downwards
Dysmorphic features
Skeletal disproportion – charts available for ratio between sitting height
and leg length. Significant disproportion suggests a skeletal dysplasia, e.g.
achondroplasia
Signs of systemic disease, e.g. clubbing

This girl is extremely short, crossing the centiles, short for family and has some subtle
dysmorphic features. Pathology is probable. She is also relatively overweight for height,
suggesting an endocrinopathy. The GP should refer her to a growth clinic.
The most likely diagnosis is Turner syndrome (TS) caused by the complete or partial
absence of one of the X chromosomes. The incidence is 1 in 3000 live female births.
Short stature is universal and there are specific Turner growth charts. The dysmorphic
features vary in frequency (e.g. only 50 per cent have neck webbing) and are often subtle. This girl has wide-spaced nipples and a low hairline. She also has some of the other
associations – low birth weight, difficult to feed in infancy, middle ear disease, visual
problems and poor concentration. None of these are specific, but put together they make
TS likely. Investigations must include chromosome analysis.
KEY POINTS

• Most children seen with short stature do not have a pathological cause.
• Dysmorphic features in Turner syndrome may be subtle and there should be a low
threshold for chromosome analysis in all short girls.

CASE 17:

AN OVERWEIGHT BOY

History
Marlon is a 7-year-old boy who presents to paediatric outpatients because he’s overweight. His father became concerned 1 year ago. His mother is overweight, hypertensive
and has type 2 diabetes, but his father’s weight is average. His father says the boy’s diet
is generally good but that his grandmother spoils him. He does sports twice a week at
school. He is bullied at school about his weight. His birth weight was 3.8 kg and there
were no problems in the neonatal period. He snores every night but his parents have not
noticed any sleep apnoea. His development is normal. He is on no medication. No other
diseases run in the family.
Examination
There are no dysmorphic features. There are some pink abdominal stretch marks. There
is no acanthosis nigricans and no goitre. His blood pressure is 116/75 mmHg. His tonsils
are large but with a good gap between them. There are no other signs. His height is
125 cm (75th centile) and his weight is 38.7 kg (99.6th centile).
INVESTIGATIONS
Full blood count, urea and electrolytes, liver and thyroid function tests are normal. His
fasting glucose, insulin, cholesterol and triglycerides are normal.

Questions
• What is this child’s body mass index (BMI)?
• What is the most likely cause of this child’s obesity?
• How should this child be treated?

53

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 17
Marlon’s BMI  weight (kg)/height (m)2  38.7/(1.25)2  24.8 kg/m2. There are standard BMI charts for males and females from 0 to 20 years. BMI varies according to age.
Children with a BMI above the 91st centile are overweight and those with a BMI above
the 98th centile are obese.
The most likely cause of this child’s obesity is simple obesity – obesity due to caloric
intake exceeding energy expenditure. It is the commonest cause of obesity and is not
due to any underlying pathology. Children with simple obesity tend to be tall and overweight. Those who are short and overweight are more likely to have underlying pathology, such as an endocrine disorder.
Stretch marks are secondary to the obesity and are usually pink. Violaceous stretch
marks are associated with Cushing’s syndrome. Large tonsils and obstructive sleep
apnoea are associated with obesity. The child does not have acanthosis nigricans, which
is a thickening and darkening of the skin in the axilla, neck or groin. It is usually a sign
of insulin resistance. Children with obesity should be assessed for co-morbidities such
as hypertension, breathlessness on exertion, obstructive sleep apnoea, hyperinsulinaemia
and type 2 diabetes (in children 10 years), dyslipidaemia, knock-knees or bow legs,
polycystic ovary syndrome and psychosocial dysfunction.

!

Causes of obesity

• Simple obesity
• Genetic, i.e. one or both parents is obese
• Endocrine disease, e.g. hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, growth hormone
•
•
•
•
•

deficiency, pseudohypoparathyroidism
Drugs, e.g. steroids, sodium valproate
Syndromes, e.g. Down’s, Präder–Willi and Laurence–Moon–Biedl
Disorders associated with immobility, e.g. cerebral palsy
Hypothalamic damage, e.g. secondary to trauma or brain tumours
Rarely, single gene mutations, such as those of the melanocortin-4 receptor and
leptin

Treatment should be multidisciplinary. Dietetic input is very important. Children should
be encouraged to exercise for 60 min/day. Sedentary activities such as playing computer games should be discouraged. Obesity can lead to low self-esteem and, in our case,
Marlon is being bullied. He would therefore benefit from seeing a psychologist, who
could also initiate behavioural therapies to help treat the obesity.
As the enlarged tonsils are not leading to sleep apnoea, tonsillectomy is not currently
indicated. The systolic blood pressure is below the 95th centile for a 7-year-old male
with a height on the 75th centile and therefore does not need treatment.
Drug treatment with drugs such as Orlistat or sibutramine is reserved for children 12
years of age and is only recommended in the presence of severe physical or psychological
co-morbidities. Post-puberty, bariatric surgery, such as gastric stapling, can be considered
in severe cases.

ANSWER 18
Tracey has gonadotrophin-dependent precocious puberty secondary to a hypothalamic
hamartoma. This condition differs from gonadotrophin-independent precocious puberty,
which is caused by the abnormal secretion of sex steroids independent of the hypothalamopituitary axis. Precocious puberty is defined in the UK as puberty commencing before
the age of 8 years in females and 9 years in males. In the United States these criteria
have been recently revised to below 7 years in a Caucasian girl and below 6 years in an
Afro-Caribbean girl. There may be a family history.
The first sign of puberty in girls is breast development, and in boys is testicular enlargement with a testicular volume of 4 mL denoting the start of puberty.
Tracey’s puberty started at 5 years and 6 months. Sweating, body odour, acne and a
height spurt (height velocity increases from 5 cm/year prepubertally to as much as 12 cm/
year) are all part of puberty. The high height centile relative to the mid-parental centile
and the advanced bone age all support early puberty. The LHRH test can help diagnose
gonadotrophin-dependent precocious puberty. An LH value 8 units/L with a predominant LH response is diagnostic. The ultrasound is also in keeping with puberty. In the
majority of girls ( 90 per cent) the cause is idiopathic. The earlier the onset of puberty,
the greater the likelihood of there being a cause. Investigation should be considered in
all girls below 8 years of age. The presence of neurological features should also prompt
investigations, including a cranial MRI. In a minority of girls, a hypothalamic hamartoma can lead to early puberty. Rarely, malignant brain tumours can cause precocious
puberty. Acquired neurological injuries, such as encephalitis, hydrocephalus and radiation, can also lead to early puberty.
In contrast, in boys early puberty is usually secondary to a cranial lesion and MRI scanning is mandatory.
Treatment is with monthly injections of an LHRH analogue. This should halt puberty
and may lead to some regression. Although currently tall, this girl is at risk of premature
fusion of her epiphysis with a short adult height. Psychosocial considerations are also an
important indication for treatment. Coping with the emotional changes of puberty and
possible early menarche is difficult in young girls. In girls with mild, slowly progressive
early puberty, no treatment may be necessary. In boys, treatment is also with an LHRH
analogue. Any underlying lesion should be treated. Treatment is often continued until
11 years of age.
Hypothalamic hamartomas are benign and often remain static in size or grow slowly,
producing no other signs. Neurosurgical intervention is not indicated except in rare
patients with intractable seizures.

KEY POINTS

• Precocious puberty is defined as puberty starting below the age of 8 years in girls and
9 years in boys.

• In females it is usually idiopathic, but in males it is usually secondary to a cranial
lesion.

• Treatment is with LHRH analogues (any underlying lesion may also need treatment).

CASE 19:

A BOY WITH DELAYED PUBERTY

History
Paul, who is 14 years and 6 months old, comes to see his GP for the first time in years.
He is worried about his short stature and lack of pubertal development. He feels he is
losing out in team sports and wants to become a physical education teacher. The GP
records show that his father is on the 9th centile and his mother is between the 9th and
25th centiles. There are no other symptoms or past history of note.
Examination
Paul is a fit, healthy, slim boy. General and systems examination are normal. His penis
is about 5 cm long and the skin of the scrotum is lax and slightly pigmented. Both testes
are descended but are quite small. There is no pubic or axillary hair. Both height and
weight are on the 2nd centile. The GP puts together a growth chart from the available
data (see Fig. 19.1).

Foundation.)

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What should the GP do next?
• Is there any treatment available?
59

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 19
The most likely diagnosis is constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) in a
boy from a relatively short family. Boys enter puberty any time from 9 to 14 years old
and it takes 4–5 years to complete. Puberty follows a recognized pattern with initial
enlargement of the testes that produce testosterone and gradual development of secondary sexual characteristics according to Tanner stages 1 (prepubertal) to 5 (adult) – a
scoring system for genital and hair development. Testicular volume can be estimated
using a Prader orchidometer, 4 mL defining the onset of puberty and 15–25 mL being
an adult male. This boy is only at stage 2 for genital development and stage 1 for pubic
hair. Testosterone is a poor growth promoter in low concentrations (unlike oestrogen in
females) so the growth spurt of puberty peaks relatively late (stage 4). Girls enter puberty
between 8 and 13 years of age, hit their peak height velocity at around stage 3 and stop
growing sooner than boys. Hence women are shorter than men.
Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is common in boys and can be a source
of misery and behaviour problems. Boys who also come from a short family may feel
very different from their peer group at a time when conforming is important. This boy’s
growth failure is apparent due to the current cross-sectional charts falsely depicting all
boys having their growth spurt simultaneously. Unlike longitudinal charts, they take no
account of the age range of normal puberty. Boys with CDGP continue to grow at their
prepubertal rate, crossing the centiles downwards with later acceleration and catch-up.
A family history is common. CDGP is rare in girls and a pathological cause for significant pubertal delay should be sought.
The fact that the boy has summoned the courage to seek advice means he is worried.
Understandably, many give an air of bravado to cover their embarrassment. Ask about
bullying and teasing. Many are satisfied with reassurance that all will be well in the end,
but this boy is unlikely to start his growth spurt for 12–18 months. Unless the boy is
clearly reassured, the GP should refer him to the endocrine clinic.
Treatment is usually available with a short course of low-dose, 4-weekly testosterone
injections to give a ‘boost’ to pubertal development and thereby a growth spurt. This
will have no adverse effect on final height. Usually the diagnosis is clear and no investigations are necessary except for a bone age which usually shows delay. The latter is
reassuring to the family in that it demonstrates that there is additional growth potential and that the child is likely to continue to grow after his peers have stopped. If
there is any uncertainty about the diagnosis, the endocrine clinic will institute further
investigations.

KEY POINTS

• Conforming to their peer group is very important for adolescents.
• Constitutional delay of growth and puberty is a rarer diagnosis in girls and a
pathological cause should be sought.

CASE 20:

IS IT A BOY OR A GIRL?

History
A midwife calls the neonatal intensive care unit asking for an urgent review of a baby
born 10 minutes ago. At delivery they thought it was a boy and said this to the parents.
Now they are not so sure because although the baby appears to have a penis, there is no
obvious scrotum and they cannot feel the testes. The baby seems otherwise normal and
there was nothing remarkable about the pregnancy. It is the parents’ first child.
Examination
There are no dysmorphic features and examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and
abdominal systems are normal. The weight is 3.1 kg. There is a 1.5 cm phallus (normal in
term newborn males 2.5 cm) with a single perineal opening at the base of the phallus.
There is pigmentation of the labioscrotal folds, which are fused with no obvious vaginal
opening. There are no palpable gonads, including in the inguinal canals. The anus is
normally positioned. The baby’s external genitalia can be seen in Figure 20.1.

Figure 20.1 External genitalia.

Questions
• Is this a boy or a girl?
• What is the most likely diagnosis and the differential?
• What investigations are needed?

61

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 20
At this stage, no one can or should say whether this baby is a boy or a girl. It is imperative not to guess as it could be either a virilized female (a normal girl exposed in utero
to excess androgens) or an undervirilized male. Disorders of sexual differentiation (DSD)
are a medical and social emergency and families find it exceptionally difficult not knowing the sex of their baby. Pending urgent tests they should not name the baby or register
the birth.
In the absence of palpable gonads, but with evidence of virilization with a small phallus
and pigmentation, it is most likely that this is a virilized female. Much the commonest
aetiology is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). If the baby is an undervirilized male,
there is a much larger differential, including disorders of gonadotrophin production (e.g.
Kallman syndrome), defects of testosterone synthesis and end-organ insensitivity due to
androgen receptor abnormalities. With very severe undervirilization, it is possible that
the sex of rearing should be female. Such babies need urgent referral to a specialist centre
with a team of endocrinologists, urologists, geneticists and psychologists.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a group of autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) (therefore commoner if parents are consanguineous), within the adrenal
steroidogenic pathways that produce mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), glucocorticoids
(cortisol) and androgens (testosterone). Ninety-five per cent of cases are due to 21hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) that catalyses late steps in the first two pathways. The
consequences are the same as for any IEM – deficiency of the end product, continued
drive through the pathway, build-up of precursors and diversion down alternative pathways. Lack of cortisol causes hypoglycaemia and a poor stress response. Elevated precursors divert to the androgen pathway and testosterone virilizes both male and female
fetuses. Most babies are also aldosterone-deficient. Those missed at birth (usually virilized boys) classically present in the second week of life with a salt-wasting (Addisonian)
crisis – vomiting and shocked with severe hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia and acidosis.
Patients with 21-OHD need lifelong steroid replacement, initially with hydrocortisone
and fludrocortisone (a mineralocorticoid analogue), and endocrine monitoring.
The timing of any surgery to reduce clitoromegaly and create a vaginal orifice is
controversial.
Investigations in the first few days consider the differential diagnosis and monitor for
complications:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

karyotype – result in 48 hours if laboratory warned
pelvic and abdominal ultrasound – extremely helpful and immediately available
17-hydroxyprogesterone – sent after 48 hours as raised in all newborns
full male hormone profile
urine steroid profile – confirms site of block in steroidogenic pathway
electrolytes and glucose – from day 2; monitor bedside glucose
plasma renin activity – best estimation of salt status.
KEY POINTS

• Never guess the sex of a newborn baby with abnormal genitalia.
• Virilization of a female infant is almost always congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to
21-hydroxylase deficiency.

CASE 21:

A BOY WITH BREASTS

History
Anthony is a 15-year-old boy who presents to an outpatient clinic with an 18-month
history of gynaecomastia. There is occasional breast tenderness. There is no history of
galactorrhoea. He has stopped doing sports at school as he is too embarrassed to undress
in front of his classmates in the changing room. He is a little behind at school and
requires extra help. His aunt has breast cancer and his grandmother died of breast cancer. He is on no medication and has no allergies.
Examination
There is moderate symmetrical gynaecomastia. Pubertal staging is as follows (see p. 60):
pubic hair, Tanner stage 4; genitalia, Tanner stage 3. Testes are both 15 mL in volume
(using the Prader orchidometer). There are no abdominal masses and no other signs.
His weight, at 78 kg, is between the 91st and 98th centiles and his height, at 169 cm, is
on the 50th centile.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 21
Anthony has pubertal gynaecomastia. All males have small amounts of oestrogen, just
as all females have small amounts of adrenal androgens (which, in females, leads to the
development of pubic and axillary hair). Gynaecomastia is common in pubertal males
and is due to a decreased ratio of testosterone to oestrogen in puberty.
Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY) can be associated with gynaecomastia and learning difficulties. These patients also have small testes and this makes that diagnosis unlikely
in our patient. Gynaecomastia is occasionally familial. Very rarely, oestrogen-secreting
tumours can lead to gynaecomastia, e.g. a feminizing adrenal tumour or a Leydig cell
tumour of the testis. The absence of abdominal signs, of a unilaterally enlarged testis
and the normality of the oestradiol level make these diagnoses very unlikely. Drugs such
as oestrogen and spironolactone and drugs of abuse, such as marijuana, can also cause
gynaecomastia.
Prolactinomas are not usually accompanied by gynaecomastia and the absence of galactorrhoea makes this diagnosis unlikely. Breast cancer would be exceptionally rare in
puberty.
Mild-to-moderate cases of pubertal gynaecomastia need no investigation. The condition
is transient and usually lasts for several months to 2 years. Anthony is somewhat overweight and a proportion of the breast enlargement could be accounted for by adipose
rather than breast tissue. Advice on weight loss could therefore be helpful. In mild-tomoderate cases, reassurance usually suffices. If the gynaecomastia is severe, or is leading to psychosocial problems, e.g. severe teasing, plastic surgery is indicated. Mammary
reduction by either liposuction or a subareolar incision with removal of the excess tissue
can be performed.

KEY POINTS

• Gynaecomastia is common in pubertal boys.
• Reassurance usually suffices, but occasionally plastic surgery is indicated.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 22
This type of nutritional history in an Asian child, the accompanying clinical signs, the
high ALP, the borderline calcium and the wrist X-ray all point to rickets. Furthermore,
the poor nutritional intake, the pallor and the microcytic hypochromic anaemia are
typical of iron deficiency anaemia.
Rickets is a disorder characterized by a failure in the mineralization of growing bones.
The majority of cases are due to inadequate sunlight exposure coupled with nutritional
deficiency. The condition is more common in dark-skinned infants who need greater
sun exposure to synthesize adequate amounts of vitamin D. Prolonged breast-feeding
increases the risk of rickets as breast milk is a poor source of vitamin D. Infant formulas are often supplemented with vitamin D, but cow’s milk is also a poor source of
vitamin D. Diseases that interfere with the metabolic conversion and activation of vitamin D, such as severe renal and liver disease, can lead to rickets. Illnesses associated
with malabsorption, such as coeliac disease, can also lead to rickets. Other diseases that
interfere with calcium and phosphorus homeostasis can cause rickets, e.g. renal tubular defects, such as hypophosphataemic rickets, in which there is failure of phosphate
absorption, or Fanconi’s syndrome in which there is a defect in the reabsorption of
phosphate, glucose and amino acids.
Clinical features include swollen wrists and ankles, frontal bossing, prominent costochondral junctions (a rickety rosary), bow legs or knock-knees, craniotabes, muscle
weakness, tetany and hypocalcaemic fits.
The radiograph demonstrates the typical appearance in rickets with widening of the
growth plate and cupping, splaying and fraying of the metaphysis.
A vitamin D level to confirm the nutritional aetiology of the rickets and antitransglutaminase antibody levels to rule out coeliac disease would be helpful.
Iron deficiency anaemia is said to occur in a quarter of children under 5 years of age.
Cow’s milk is a poor source of iron. Although usually nutritional, blood loss should
be considered as a possible cause, especially in older children. This may be due to
occult gastrointestinal blood loss secondary to a peptic ulcer, a Meckel’s diverticulum
or inflammatory bowel disease. A ferritin level should be done to confirm the diagnosis and is likely to be very low. A haemoglobinopathy screen should be performed in
high-risk groups to exclude disorders such as thalassaemia that can also cause a microcytic hypochromic anaemia and that may coexist with iron deficiency. Infants may
be pale, tired, irritable and anorexic. In severe cases they can be tachypnoeic. There is
evidence that iron deficiency anaemia can also have adverse effects on attention span
and learning.
Treatment consists of a 3-month course of high-dose oral vitamin D. Bone chemistry
should be measured 2 weeks after starting treatment and regularly thereafter to avoid
hypercalcaemia and to ensure that the biochemical and haematological parameters normalize. This should be followed by maintenance doses of vitamin D for the long term.
The prognosis for complete resolution of the deformities is good. In cases where the
serum calcium is low, calcium is also given initially until levels normalize.
There is often an accompanying iron deficiency anaemia, as in this case. Red meat and
green vegetables are good sources of iron and some foods, such as cereals, are often
fortified with iron. The anaemia should be treated with a 3-month course of oral iron.
68

Endocrinology and diabetes

A dietetic referral and screening of the siblings for rickets and iron deficiency would
also be advisable.

KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•

Rickets is usually secondary to inadequate exposure to sunlight and poor nutrition.
Swollen wrists, a rickety rosary and bow legs are typical clinical features.
Treatment is with vitamin D.
Iron deficiency is very common in young children and can be successfully treated
with dietary advice and oral iron.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 23
In an infant this age with non-bilious projectile vomiting, pyloric stenosis is the most
likely diagnosis. This condition presents between 2 weeks and 5 months of age (median
6 weeks) and projectile vomiting is typical. The vomitus is never bile-stained as the
obstruction is proximal to the duodenum. As in this case, infants may also be constipated. The hypochloraemic alkalosis is characteristic and is due to vomiting HCl. The low
potassium is due to the kidneys retaining hydrogen ions in favour of potassium ions. The
raised urea and creatinine suggest that there is also mild dehydration. The male-to-female
ratio is 4:1 and occasionally there is a family history (multifactorial inheritance).

Differential diagnosis

•
•
•
•

Gastro-oesophageal reflux
Gastritis
Urinary tract infection
Overfeeding

Gastro-oesophageal reflux usually presents from or shortly after birth. Gastritis usually
occurs with an enteritis and diarrhoea. A urinary infection at this age may present in a very
non-specific way and therefore it is mandatory to test the urine. The absence of nitrites and
leucocytes in the urine dipstick makes a urinary infection very unlikely. Overfeeding should
be elucidated from a careful history.
The diagnosis could be clinically confirmed by carrying out a test feed. A feed leads to
peristalsis which occurs from left to right. The abdominal wall is usually relaxed during
a feed, making palpation easier. A pyloric mass, which is the size of a 2-cm olive, may
be felt in the right hypochodrium by careful palpation. An ultrasound is also usually
done for further confirmation.
Tom is slightly tachycardic (pulse rate 1 year, 110–160 beats/min) with a normal blood
pressure and capillary refill time. His urea is slightly elevated. Initial treatment consists
of treating the dehydration, acid–base and electrolyte abnormalities with intravenous
fluids (0.9 per cent saline with 5 per cent dextrose and added KCl would be the appropriate starting fluid in this infant with a low sodium and potassium). Feeds should be
stopped, a nasogastric tube inserted and the stomach emptied. The definitive operation is
Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy.

KEY POINTS

• The peak age of presentation of pyloric stenosis is 6 weeks.
• The typical biochemical picture is a hypochloraemic alkalosis.
• The definitive treatment is Ramstedt’s pyloromyotomy.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 24
The commonest causes of passing blood per rectum are gastroenteritis and an anal fissure.
Gastroenteritis is a possibility in this case, but the lack of contact with gastroenteritis and
of recent travel makes it somewhat less likely. The normality of the anus makes an anal
fissure unlikely. The age of the child, the rectal bleeding and the mass (a late feature of
intussusception) make an intussusception the most likely diagnosis.
The typical age in intussusception is 3 months to 3 years. It is due to a part of the
bowel telescoping into the adjacent distal bowel. Most intussusceptions are ileocolic.
They result in stretching of the mesenteric vasculature that can potentially lead to bowel
ischaemia or infarction. For this reason, investigation and treatment need to be instituted urgently. Typically the child has paroxysmal pain during which he or she becomes
very pale; stool containing a mixture of blood and mucus (hence the name redcurrant
jelly stool); and a sausage-shaped mass (the intussusception itself ) in the upper right
quadrant of the abdomen. As the disease progresses, bowel obstruction, peritonitis and
septicaemia may develop. The diagnostic investigation is an ultrasound.

This infant has clinical signs (tachycardia and prolonged capillary refill) and biochemical
evidence (raised urea) of dehydration, and initial treatment consists of intravenous fluid
resuscitation and intravenous antibiotics, such as penicillin, gentamicin and metronidazole. A nasogastric tube should be inserted and the stomach emptied. In the majority of
cases, reduction can be achieved by a radiologist with an air enema. The antibiotics are
given because of the possibility of sepsis and the small risk of a perforation during the
reduction. If this procedure fails, or if the child is unstable or has signs of peritonitis or a
perforation, then surgery is indicated. There is a recurrence rate of 10 per cent following
an air enema reduction, and of 2–5 per cent following a surgical reduction.
KEY POINTS

• Intussusception should be considered in any child aged 3 months to 3 years with
bloody stool.

• There should be a low threshold for carrying out an ultrasound.
• An air enema reduction is successful in the majority of cases.

A TEENAGER WITH CHRONIC DIARRHOEA

History
Levi is a 14-year-old boy who presents to the paediatric rapid referral clinic with a 3-week
history of diarrhoea and cramp-like abdominal pain. He has no blood or mucus in his stool
and has had no vomiting. His appetite is poor and he has lost 3.5 kg in 3 weeks. He has
intermittent fevers. The family recently returned from France where his father contracted
diarrhoea, from which he is now recovering. There is no other medical history of note. His
mother suffers from irritable bowel syndrome.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 25
The most likely diagnosis is Crohn’s disease. The most important differentials are an infective enteropathy (e.g. Campylobacter, Yersinia, Giardia) and ulcerative colitis. Tenderness
may be over the terminal ileum in the right iliac fossa, but can also be generalized, and
signs may mimic those of an acute abdomen. The father’s resolving diarrhoea is most likely
to be coincidental. The irritable bowel syndrome does not lead to weight loss, fevers and
abnormal blood results, as in this case. It is very important to examine the anus in cases of
suspected Crohn’s, as perianal disease (e.g. skin tags, abscess, fistula) is present in 45 per cent
of patients. Clubbing may also be present. This child has a degree of growth failure and
delayed puberty, which is common in adolescents with Crohn’s disease. The microcytic anaemia
in Crohn’s is due to a combination of gastrointestinal blood loss, an insufficient dietary
intake and inadequate iron absorption. The white cell count and platelets are often raised.
The ESR and CRP are usually elevated and the albumin is often low due to malabsorption
and protein loss in the stool. The most common extraintestinal manifestation (10 per cent) is
arthritis, typically affecting large joints. The most common dermatological manifestations are
erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum. All patients require an expert ophthalmic
examination, which may reveal episcleritis or uveitis.

A colonoscopy with colonic and terminal ileal biopsies should be performed. An upper
gastrointestinal endoscopy should also be done in all new cases of suspected Crohn’s
disease, as clinically significant upper tract disease can be present in the absence of
upper gastrointestinal symptoms.
The goals of treatment are to achieve clinical remission and to promote growth with adequate
nutrition. Patients with mild disease are treated with preparations of 5-aminosalicylic acid,
e.g. sulphasalazine, antibiotics such as metronidazole and nutritional therapy.
If there is no response, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive therapy with 6-mercaptopurine
or methotrexate can be tried. The latter two agents can also have corticosteroid-sparing
effects. Surgery is considered when medical therapy fails. Indications include intractable

CASE 26:

ACUTE DIARRHOEA AND VOMITING

History
Luca is a 24-month-old boy with Down’s syndrome, brought to the A&E department by
his mother. He has had diarrhoea and vomiting for 1 day. In the last 8 hours, he has drunk
200 ml milk, vomited five times and passed six liquid stools. The vomit is not bilious and
there is no blood or mucus in the stools. It has been hard to tell if he is passing urine
because every nappy is soiled. He has no cardiac problems and no other medical problems
except glue ear. There is no history of foreign travel. His two older siblings have recently
had diarrhoea and vomiting.
Examination
He is miserable and lethargic. His heart rate is 120 beats/min, respiratory rate is 25
breaths/min, and his temperature is 37.7C. He has dry mucous membranes, his eyes are
slightly sunken, his skin turgor appears normal and his capillary refill time is less than
2 s. His abdomen is soft with no masses palpable. His weight is 11 kg (50th centile on the
Down’s syndrome growth chart).
An oral fluid challenge is commenced in the emergency department. He drinks 60 ml of
electrolyte solution over 2 hours and vomits once on the floor. He does not pass urine
into a urine bag during this period.

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• How dehydrated is this child?
• How would you manage this child now?
• How would you calculate the fluid requirements for this child over the next 24 hours?

79

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWERS 26
The most likely diagnosis is viral gastroenteritis, probably due to rotavirus. This fits with
the acute onset and the fact that his siblings have also been unwell.
This child is about 5 per cent dehydrated, which means that he has lost 5 per cent of his
body weight as fluid. Signs of dehydration in children are shown in Table 26.1.

Management of mild-to-moderate dehydration should involve enteral rehydration (oral or
nasogastric) whenever possible. This can be done with an appropriate electrolyte solution.
After an initial 4-hour period of rehydration (when the fluid deficit is replaced), normal
feeds can be resumed, although breast-feeding can be continued throughout. Intravenous
rehydration is associated with a slower recovery and a longer hospital stay but is necessary if a child needs acute volume replacement for shock or is unable to tolerate enteral
fluids. Luca should be admitted for a trial of nasogastric fluid therapy. If he does not tolerate this, he will probably need intravenous rehydration. This is calculated as follows:
Fluid requirement for 24 hours  maintenance  correction of deficit  replacement of
ongoing losses
Maintenance fluid  100 mL/kg for first 10 kg body weight  100  10
 50 mL/kg for next 10 kg
 50  1
 20 mL/kg thereafter
Total  1050
His fluid deficit is 5 per cent of body weight  (5/100)  11 kg  0.55 kg. This is equivalent
to 550 mL (1 mL of water weighs 1 g). Losses (stool and vomit) are calculated from the fluid
balance chart and can be replaced at regular intervals. For this child, the total fluid requirement for the first 24 hours is calculated as follows:
1050 mL  550 mL  losses  1600 mL  losses
This is equivalent to 67 mL/hour  losses.

80

Gastroenterology
KEY POINTS

• Rotavirus is the most common cause of gastroenteritis in infants and young children.
• Clinical assessment of dehydration is based on multiple physical signs.
• Where possible, enteral rehydration with an electrolyte solution should be used for
children with gastroenteritis.

• Fluid replacement must account for the deficit plus the maintenance requirement
plus ongoing losses.

ACUTE ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
Sarah is a 13-year-old girl who is brought to the A&E department by her mother, with
a 2-day history of abdominal pain and vomiting. She got back from a family holiday
in Devon yesterday evening and has been feeling unwell since. Initially she had central
abdominal pain which was coming and going, but now she has more constant pain on
the right side of her abdomen. She has vomited three times, but her stool has been normal. She has no significant medical history, was well during the 2 weeks in Devon and
her last period was about 2 weeks ago. Her family are all well and report that they all
ate the same food over the last few weeks.
Examination
She is flushed and has a temperature of 37.9C. Her heart rate is 95 beats/min, respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min, capillary refill time is less than 2 s, and blood pressure is
105/67 mmHg. She appears obese (weight 68 kg, 98th centile; height 151 cm, 25th centile).
Her abdomen is tender in the right lower quadrant but there is no guarding or rebound
tenderness. Pressing in the left lower quadrant elicits pain on the right.

83

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 27
The most likely diagnosis is appendicitis. This is consistent with the history, the signs on
examination, the low-grade fever, raised white cell count and neutrophilia. Vomiting,
and even diarrhoea can be features of appendicitis and do not always indicate gastroenteritis. Sterile pyuria (leucocytes in the urine, without organisms) can be caused by the
inflamed appendix irritating the ureter or bladder.
Plain radiographs are usually normal unless there has been perforation of the appendix.
Ultrasound can confirm the diagnosis of appendicitis but can miss an inflamed appendix, particularly if the subject is obese or the appendix is retrocaecal. CT scanning has
better sensitivity and specificity but involves a high radiation dose. There is no perfect
test for appendicitis, and in practice it remains a clinical diagnosis. If there is diagnostic uncertainty, repeated clinical examination and ultrasound are often performed.
When the diagnosis is clear clinically, substantially delaying surgery to allow imaging
can result in perforation of the appendix.

Sarah should be admitted to hospital for a surgical opinion. She should have nil by mouth
until the decision is made on whether or not to operate. Unfortunately, her abdominal
pain was unconvincing when she was seen by the surgical team and so she was admitted
for observation with a plan to repeat the ultrasound the next day. She developed worsening abdominal pain and peritonism the next morning and was taken to theatre, where a
perforated appendix was removed and she had a 10-day in-patient stay complicated by
sepsis and ileus.

KEY POINTS

• The triad of abdominal pain, vomiting and a low-grade fever is suggestive of
appendicitis.

• The diagnosis is primarily clinical as there is no perfect test to rule in or rule out
appendicitis.

• A prompt diagnosis is important to avoid perforation and peritonitis.

RECURRENT ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
Danielle is an 8-year-girl referred to children’s outpatients by her GP. She has been seen
several times by different partners over the previous couple of years with abdominal
pain. She describes the pain as peri-umbilical, non-radiating, sometimes sharp, but usually an ache. There is no obvious periodicity, including to food. Her appetite is good and
there are no concerns about her growth and weight gain. She has her bowels open most
days and there has never been any blood or mucus. She occasionally feels nauseated
with the pain but has never vomited. There are no urinary symptoms. She started junior
school last year and moved house around the same time after her parents separated. She
lives with her mother, but she and her 4-year-old brother have frequent contact with
their father. She was doing well at infants but is now falling behind, having missed
quite a lot of school. She has several badges for gymnastics. There is no family history
of note, including migraine. Her mother is worried that this is something to do with
puberty and that her periods are about to start.
Examination
Danielle is a generally healthy, cooperative, but slightly anxious girl. Her nails are bitten
but there is no clubbing, anaemia, lymphadenopathy or jaundice. Her height is on the 25th
centile and her weight is on the 9th. She is prepubertal. Full examination is normal.

Questions

85

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 28
The most likely diagnosis is chronic abdominal pain of childhood or recurrent abdominal pain (RAP). This is a benign, very common but potentially debilitating condition.
The pointers to this not being organic are the chronicity of the characteristic symptoms
in an otherwise healthy, physically active child. The commonest identifiable cause for
RAP is psychosomatic, as seems likely from the description of this girl who has had
many recent changes in her life. However, it is a diagnosis of exclusion and investigations exclude conditions that can have an insidious onset, such as coeliac disease, and
reassure the child and family that there is no sinister cause. The latter is crucial because
the symptoms are very real and there is understandable anxiety.
Among the differentials, abdominal migraine differs in that it is usually associated with
pallor and vomiting. There is almost always a family history of migraine. An organic
cause is also more likely the further the pain is from the umbilicus.
Mothers often worry that RAP heralds menarche but this comes towards the end of
puberty. Sexual abuse should be considered in the differential.

Sexual or other abuse

Management focuses on explanations and reassurance. It is helpful to liken the condition
to tension headaches in adults – common and unpleasant but not serious. Acknowledge
that there is no question of fabrication. Children rarely fabricate symptoms and, if
they do, abuse should be considered. The classic time for RAP is in the morning before
school. Most parents recognize this and have often already asked questions about bullying or other worries, but sometimes a cycle sets in where missing school and falling
behind worsen the symptoms and cause more anxiety. The child may be recognized as a
‘worrier’ and most can understand the concept of psychosomatic symptoms.
Some families still find it difficult to accept that there is nothing medically wrong and
pursue a diagnosis such as food allergy. They may seek advice from practitioners of
alternative medicine and it is important to discuss openly the dangers of dietary exclusions that they may suggest. In the absence of other symptoms, such as diarrhoea or an
association with eating, there is no evidence that such measures are effective.
Once a diagnosis has been reached, the child should be discharged from hospital followup to prevent the risk of reinforcing a medical diagnosis. Referral to a psychologist or
psychiatrist is sometimes necessary.

CASE 29:

A CONSTIPATED TODDLER

History
Tanya is a 4-year-old girl who presents to outpatients with a 2-year history of constipation. She opens her bowels about once every 5 days and strains. She soils her knickers on
most days. She has intermittent abdominal pain, which is relieved by opening her bowels.
Recently, there has been fresh blood on the toilet tissue. Lactulose has been used, with little success. Her mother states that she did not have a dirty nappy until 40 hours of age.
She has recently had a urine infection diagnosed by her GP. The illness was mild and
responded well to antibiotics. She was delivered by emergency Caesarean section
because of fetal distress and meconium staining.

Examination
A faecal mass is palpable in the left iliac fossa. The anus appears normal. Rectal examination –
hard stool palpated. The back is normal. Blood pressure is 101/62 mmHg. There are no
other signs. Weight is on the 50th centile and height is on the 25th centile.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• Would you carry out any investigations?
• What is the treatment?

89

100 Cases in Peadiatrics

ANSWER 29
The most likely diagnosis is functional constipation. This condition is associated with
faecal masses in the lower abdomen. Severe constipation can lead to an anal fissure
(and vice versa). This is the likely cause of the bleeding. It may be high up in the anus
and therefore not visible on inspection. The soiling is involuntary and due to liquid stool
leaking from above the hard stool mass in the rectum. Hirschsprung’s disease should be
suspected if meconium has not been passed in the first 24 hours of life. However, in this
case, the passage of meconium in utero, the lack of symptoms in the first 2 years of life
and the normal weight make that diagnosis unlikely. Furthermore, in Hirschsprung’s disease the rectum is usually empty.

Drugs, e.g. opiates, vincristine, lead poisoning
Hypothyroidism
Sexual abuse

No investigations are necessary. Usually, clinical assessment suffices to make the diagnosis.
In children who refuse a rectal examination, or if there is doubt about the diagnosis, then
an abdominal X-ray is useful to assess the degree of faecal loading. Children with constipation are more likely to get urinary infections. In a 4-year-old with a history of one, nonsevere urinary tract infection, no investigations are required.
Dietary advice needs to be given, encouraging a good fluid intake, a daily high-fibre
cereal and fruit and vegetables. Star charts may also help.
Initial drug treatment consists of an osmotic laxative such as lactulose. If that is ineffective, as in this case, a stimulant laxative such as senna should be added. If the patient
remains constipated, a more powerful osmotic laxative such as Movicol can be used as
a single agent. The doses of these medications can be titrated to the frequency of bowel
actions, with the aim being for the child to open their bowels daily in a pain-free manner without soiling.
If the child has pain secondary to an anal fissure, lidocaine ointment should help.
Whenever possible, treatment is administered orally. However, in some cases glycerine suppositories or phosphate enemas are required to help disimpact hard stool in the rectum.
In very severe cases, a bowel-cleansing solution such as Klean-Prep may be needed, and
in extreme cases a manual evacuation may need to be performed in theatre.
90

Gastroenterology

Constipation often starts at the age of 2 years when the child is being toilet-trained.
Toilet training may lead to ‘power struggles’ between the child and the family and thus
to constipation. In some cases, psychological intervention is helpful.

KEY POINTS

• Functional constipation is very common.
• Investigations are usually unnecessary.
• Initial treatment consists of dietary advice and lactulose.

AN INFANT WITH POOR WEIGHT GAIN

History
Tommy is a 9-month-old boy who is referred to the outpatient clinic with failure to
thrive. His birth weight was 3.17 kg, he gained weight well initially and was weaned
at 6 months. His appetite has been poor over the last couple of months and his mother
describes him as miserable. He has no vomiting and opens his bowels four times a day.
The stool is loose and smelly but contains no blood or mucus. His mother breast-fed
until 4 months of age. The family have recently returned from Turkey but his mother
states that the poor feeding and weight loss preceded their holiday. His father has
Crohn’s disease, for which he has required several operations.
Examination
Tommy is a thin, pale-looking infant. He is miserable and cries easily, and his abdomen is distended. There are no signs of tenderness, masses or organomegaly. The oral

Questions

• What are the causes of failure to thrive?
• What is the likely diagnosis and how could it be confirmed?

93

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 30
Failure to thrive is a descriptive term and not a diagnosis. It is often defined as a weight,
or a rate of weight gain, that is significantly below what is normal for a child of that
age and sex. Some authors define failure to thrive as a weight that has fallen two centile
lines on the standard growth charts. Although this term can refer to height as well as
weight, it is usually used in relation to weight in children under 2 years of age.

!

Causes of failure to thrive
Inadequate intake of food
• Poor feeding
• Mechanical problem such as a cleft palate or bulbar palsy
Malabsorption
• Coeliac disease
• Cystic fibrosis
Excessive loss of nutrients
• Vomiting due to gastro-oesophageal reflux
• Protein-losing enteropathy, e.g. cow’s milk protein intolerance
Increased nutrient requirement
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Chronic infection, e.g. HIV
Miscellaneous causes
• Dysmorphic syndromes, e.g. Russell–Silver syndrome
• Inborn errors of metabolism
Psychosocial
• Child abuse and neglect
• Emotional and social deprivation

It is important to take a full dietary history. The commonest cause of failure to thrive
is a poor nutrient intake which may be due to feeding mismanagement or psychosocial
problems. Failure to thrive may also be the result of a combination of the factors in the
above box, and in some cases no cause is found. Crohn’s disease is very rare in this age
group and the father’s illness is coincidental.
The likely diagnosis is coeliac disease. Steatorrhoea (with pale, greasy, smelly stool) and
diarrhoea are typical. The abdominal distension is due to distension of the intestinal
loops with fluids and gas. The centile chart shows that the weight has crossed two centile lines since 6 months and that there has also been weight loss. This would correspond
with weaning at 6 months and the introduction of gluten in wheat and other foods.
The anaemia is secondary to the poor nutrient intake and malabsorption. Folate as well
as iron deficiency may occur. Anti-tissue transglutaminase is 95 per cent accurate in
diagnosing coeliac disease (it is important to simultaneously measure IgA, as anti-tissue
transglutaminase is an IgA antibody and IgA deficiency would invalidate the test).
However, the definitive diagnosis is based on an endoscopy with a jejunal biopsy. In
cases of coeliac disease, there is subtotal villous atrophy, crypt hypertrophy and a lamina propria plasma cell infiltrate. Treatment is with a gluten-free diet.

97

100 Cases in Peadiatrics

ANSWER 31
The history should establish when jaundice first occurred, as the causes of early-onset
jaundice are different from the causes of prolonged jaundice. Parents should be asked
specifically about the presence of pale stools and dark urine. Pale stool indicates that
bile pigments are not being excreted into the gut, and dark urine occurs with the accumulation of water-soluble conjugated bilirubin in the urine. These indicate that there
is obstruction to bile flow out of the liver. The urine dipstick shows the presence of
bilirubin but the absence of urobilinogen, so this child would be expected to have pale
stools and dark urine.

• Prolonged, 14 days

The causes of neonatal jaundice, including prolonged jaundice, are outlined in Case 82
(p. 243).
Prolonged conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia in a baby who appears well is likely to be
due to extrahepatic biliary atresia. Progressive destruction of the extrahepatic bile ducts
occurs, with obstruction of bile flow and, subsequently, rapid progression of damage
within the liver and cirrhosis.
It is important to pick up cases of extrahepatic biliary atresia early, so that the diagnosis can be confirmed by ultrasound and liver biopsy and then surgery can be performed
before irreversible damage to the liver has occurred. The outcome of the Kasai procedure
(portoenterostomy) is much better for surgery performed before 60 days of age. For this
reason, the case needs to be discussed promptly with the local specialist centre.

KEY POINTS

• In prolonged neonatal jaundice with a raised conjugated bilirubin fraction, the
diagnosis must be extrahepatic biliary atresia until proven otherwise.

• The outcome of the Kasai procedure is much better if surgery is performed early.

CASE 32:

ABDOMINAL PAIN AND JAUNDICE

History
Ferdinand is a 12-year-old boy who is brought to the A&E department by his parents. This is his third attendance in the last 2 weeks. Today he has been complaining of
abdominal pain and his parents noticed that the whites of his eyes look yellow. He has
been scratching himself a lot, although he has not had a rash. The notes from his previous attendances show that he had a flu-like illness with a fever up to 38.5C, nausea
and a poor appetite over the last 10 days. However, there were no abnormal findings on
examination. He has previously been healthy, but he did travel to the Philippines in the
school holidays about 5 weeks ago. He was born in the UK and received all his routine
childhood immunizations.
Examination
He is jaundiced and appears in discomfort. His temperature is 36.8C, heart rate is 90
beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min, oxygen saturation 98 per cent in air, and his blood
pressure is 118/70 mmHg. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations are normal, but
his liver is palpable 4 cm below the costal margin and is tender. Ears, nose and throat
are normal and he is alert and fully orientated.

ANSWER 32
The history can be very helpful in establishing whether jaundice is caused by a pre-hepatic,
hepatic or posthepatic problem. Bilirubin is produced by degradation of haem and is initially unconjugated, and hence water-insoluble. Unconjugated bilirubin is transported bound
to albumin and is conjugated in the liver parenchymal cells to make it water-soluble and
excretable in bile. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted and converted to urobilinogen, urobilin
and stercobilinogen in the gut, which can be reabsorbed, leading to the enterohepatic circulation of bile pigments. These pigments give stool its normal coloration. If there is increased
unconjugated bilirubin production from increased red cell destruction (e.g. haemolysis) then
there will be jaundice with normally pigmented stool and urine. If there is obstruction to
bile excretion (e.g. common bile duct stone), conjugated bilirubin accumulates (which causes
itching), overflows into urine (causing it to appear dark), and does not reach the gut (resulting in pale stools). Hepatic causes may produce a combination of these patterns. Thus it is
important to ask about stool and urine colour, as well as factors that may predispose to each
type of cause. In this case, a full travel history is necessary and additional questions should
be asked about pre-travel immunization and drug history.

!

Differential diagnosis of abdominal pain and jaundice
Pre-hepatic
• Abdominal pain is an uncommon feature
• Possible causes: malaria, sickle cell crisis
Hepatic
• Often pale stools and dark urine will be present
• Acute hepatitis due to infection, drugs, toxins
Posthepatic
• Pale stools and dark urine
• Bile duct stones, cholecystitis, choledochal cyst
• Cholangitis must be considered in a febrile child

Additional tests should include urine dipstick to confirm bilirubinuria, amylase, determination of the conjugated and unconjugated fractions of serum bilirubin, serological
investigation for viral hepatitis (most importantly, hepatitis A IgM), a clotting profile
and abdominal ultrasound.
The most likely diagnosis is hepatitis A, which is uncommon in the UK but endemic
throughout much of the world and is most likely to cause symptomatic acute hepatitis
in older children and adults. There is usually a flu-like prodromal phase, with nausea
and anorexia starting 2–6 weeks after exposure, followed by an icteric phase when there
may be tender hepatomegaly. Usually children make a complete recovery. Other infections (e.g. hepatitis B, or C, and Epstein–Barr virus) can also cause acute hepatitis but
are less common.
Hepatitis A can be prevented by immunization and good hygiene practices, as it is transmitted by the faeco-oral route.
KEY POINTS

• Always ask about urine and stool colour in a jaundiced child.
• Hepatitis A is endemic throughout much of the world.
• Hepatitis A is most likely to cause symptomatic disease in older children and adults

CASE 33:

A LUMP IN THE GROIN

History
William is a 10-month-old boy who presents to his GP with swelling of the left side of
his scrotum. His parents first noticed this about 2 weeks previously whilst he was in
the bath. By the next morning, it seemed to have disappeared but since then they have
noticed it intermittently. It does not seem to be causing him any distress. William was
born by emergency Caesarean section at 34 weeks’ gestation after serial scans showed
poor intrauterine growth. His birth weight was 1.6 kg (2nd centile). The placenta was in
poor condition. His neonatal course was uneventful and he is making good developmental progress.
Examination
William’s weight is 7.8 kg (9th centile) and his length is 70.5 cm (50th centile), correcting for his prematurity. He is a healthy, cheerful active boy. Initial examination of the
genitalia appears normal, with both testes palpable within the scrotum and no asymmetry. However, he then begins to struggle and a smooth firm swelling appears in the left
inguinal region and there is distension of the left hemiscrotum. With gentle pressure, it
disappears. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the cause in children?
• Which groups of children are most at risk?
• What is the treatment?

101

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 33
The site and intermittent nature of the swelling make an inguinal hernia the most likely
diagnosis. They are sometimes difficult to detect. Older children can increase their intraabdominal pressure by coughing, and examining them standing up may help. The position
of the testes must be noted because, if retractile, they can be mistaken for a hernia. In girls
the contents of the hernial sac are often adherent within the sac and hence not reducible – a
sliding hernia – and a fallopian tube or ovary may be palpable. The commonest cause of a
swelling in the groin is a lymph node, but they are usually small and mobile and lie more
inferior and lateral than an inguinal hernia. They may also be confused with a retractile
testis. An ultrasound can help. Direct and femoral hernias are rare in children.
In adults, inguinal hernias are associated with a muscular weakness or defect, but in
children they usually result from persistent patency of the processus vaginalis (PV). This
accompanies the testis as it exits the abdomen and descends into the scrotum and is
obliterated by, or soon after, birth. Failure of obliteration can occur anywhere along its
length, explaining the range of presentations (see Fig. 33.1). A hydrocoele is fluid within
the tunica vaginalis – the remnant of the PV that surrounds the testis. Hydrocoeles transilluminate. They usually resolve spontaneously by the age of 12 months and, if not,
should be referred to a surgeon. Fifty per cent of inguinal hernias present in the first
year of life, most by the age of 6 months.

!

Children at risk of inguinal hernia

• Preterm infants – especially those with very low birth weight (⬃30 per cent
affected)

• Boys – outnumber girls 6:1 because ovaries do not leave the abdominal cavity
• Infants with chronic lung disease
• Children with conditions associated with abnormal abdominal fluid or increased
intra-abdominal pressure

• Children with developmental urogenital anomalies
• Infants with disorders of sexual differentiation – phenotypically female infants
with inguinal hernias, especially bilateral, should be examined carefully to
exclude complete androgen insensitivity syndrome, an extremely rare but
crucial diagnosis

Treatment is surgical. Early repair reduces the significant risk of the contents of the
sac becoming irreducible (incarceration) and/or the hernia becoming strangulated, i.e. so
tightly constricted that the contents become ischaemic or gangrenous, with consequent
testicular atrophy.

KEY POINTS

• The commonest cause of a lump in the groin is a lymph node
• Preterm infants are at high risk of developing an inguinal hernia
• Early repair of a hernia is important to reduce the risk of incarceration and/or
strangulation

CASE 34:

ABDOMINAL PAIN AND DYSURIA

History
Leah is a 5-year-old girl who has been passing urine frequently for the last 2 days and
complaining of pain when doing so. Her parents have brought her to A&E today because
they measured a temperature of 39C using a forehead thermometer and she had an episode of violent shivering. She has also complained of pain in her back and has vomited
three times today.
Leah had oesophageal atresia with a tracheo-oesophageal fistula diagnosed at birth. Her
parents remember that some tests were done at birth but no other abnormalities were
found. She has no history of urinary infections. They have moved home four times since
she was born and have not had any follow-up for years. She is generally healthy and
has recently started school, which she enjoys.

Examination
She is flushed and miserable. Her temperature is 39.1C, heart rate 130 beats/min, respiratory rate 25/min, and her oxygen saturation is 99 per cent in air. Capillary refill is 2 s,
heart sounds are normal and her chest is clear. She has a mild kyphoscoliosis. Her abdomen feels soft and is not distended, but there is significant discomfort when palpating
the right loin. Her external genitalia appear normal. Her weight is 17 kg (25th centile).

105

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 34
This child’s clinical features and urine dipstick results are consistent with a urinary tract
infection (UTI). The combination of leucocytes and nitrites on urine dipstick is highly
predictive of a UTI. Urine dipstick should be a routine part of the assessment of a febrile
child. It is important to recognize that the history and physical findings suggest that this
is more than just cystitis. She has probably had a rigor, which may indicate bacterial
products entering the bloodstream, she is systemically unwell and she has loin tenderness. These findings point to the diagnosis of pyelonephritis.

!

Symptoms of a urinary tract infection

• Infant – fever, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, poor feeding
• Older child – frequency, dysuria, abdominal pain or loin pain, fever

It is useful to collect two midstream urine specimens before starting intravenous antibiotic therapy, so that the diagnosis of UTI can be confirmed. It is important to avoid
contamination by skin flora, by cleaning the external genitalia first and then catching
urine cleanly from the middle of the stream (i.e. do not collect the first drops) without
the container touching the skin. This should then be sent for microscopy and bacterial
culture. Her blood pressure should be measured and, during cannulation, blood should
be sent for a full blood count, C-reactive protein, urea, electrolytes, creatinine and blood
culture. Further questioning should determine if there have been previous urine infections, recurrent fevers of uncertain origin, a previously diagnosed renal abnormality, a
family history of vesicoureteric reflux or constipation. In infants under 6 months and in
older children with severe, atypical or recurrent urinary infections, imaging is required
to determine if there is an underlying renal abnormality. Leah will therefore require an
ultrasound of her urinary tract in the next few days. Prophylactic antibiotics are no
longer used routinely after a first urinary tract infection but may be required in children
with recurrent urinary infections.
Leah may have an underlying structural renal tract abnormality predisposing to infection. The VACTERL association is the sporadic, non-random, concurrence of at least
three of: vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheo-oesophageal, renal and limb abnormalities.
She should also have spinal X-rays to determine the cause of her kyphoscoliosis, e.g.
a hemivertebra (see Case 60, p. 183). It would be useful to obtain her previous medical
records to find out more about her previous history and investigations.

KEY POINTS

• Urinalysis should be performed in any unwell, febrile child.
• In infants under 6 months and in older children with severe, atypical or recurrent
urinary infections, imaging is required to determine if there is an underlying renal
abnormality.

Microscopy – red blood cells and red blood cell casts seen

Questions
• What further investigations should be performed?
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the treatment?

107

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 35
The following investigations should be performed:

• throat swab
• anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT), C3 and C4 – ASOT is raised and C3 is reduced in
post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

• ESR and ANA – will be abnormal in vasculitides, e.g. SLE
• abdominal X-ray and renal US – will demonstrate normality of kidneys and help
exclude calculi.
The most likely diagnosis is a post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis. This condition typically occurs approximately 2 weeks after a streptococcal upper respiratory tract infection (it may also follow a streptococcal skin infection). It can be associated with varying
degrees of oliguria and renal failure (in this case there is mild renal failure). The casts
indicate renal involvement.
In cases of red urine or blood in the nappy, one should first ensure the blood is from the
urinary tract and not from the rectum (e.g. due to constipation) or from the vagina (e.g.
periods or abuse). Foods such as beetroot can lead to red urine. Haemoglobinuria due to
haemolysis will also lead to red urine which will be dipstick-positive for blood but there
will be no red blood cells on microscopy.
The causes of haematuria are:

• urinary tract infection
• nephritis – post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

– Henoch–Schönlein purpura
– IgA nephropathy
– nephrotic syndrome (20 per cent have haematuria at presentation)
calculi
trauma
haematological – clotting disorders, haemolytic uraemic syndrome
anatomical causes – polycystic kidneys, hydronephrosis
tumours, e.g. Wilms’ tumour
drugs, e.g. cyclophosphamide, aspirin
factitious illness
recurrent benign haematuria (a diagnosis by elimination).

Treatment is primarily symptomatic. A 10-day course of oral penicillin should be given
but this will not alter the natural history of the glomerulonephritis. Fluids should be
restricted to 1 L/day and the diet should have no added salt. Frusemide is helpful in
cases of hypertension (this girl’s blood pressure is greater than the 95th centile for a
6-year-old girl) or oedema and will increase urine output. If hypertension persists, a calcium channel blocker such as amlodipine may be helpful. If heavy proteinuria develops
or if renal function deteriorates, a renal opinion should be sought. Indications for dialysis include life-threatening hyperkalaemia and the clinical manifestations of uraemia.
Outpatient follow-up will necessitate the monitoring of blood pressure, urea and electrolytes/creatinine and urine dipstick. More than 95 per cent of patients make a complete
recovery. Complications include nephrotic range proteinuria and renal failure.

108

Nephrology
KEY POINTS

• Urinary tract infections, post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis and Henoch–

• What other investigations should to be performed at presentation?
• What is the treatment?
• What are the complications of this condition?

111

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 36
The diagnosis is nephrotic syndrome. This condition consists of the combination of oedema,
heavy proteinuria (protein 3 on dipstick), hypoalbuminaemia (albumin 25 g/L, it is
only when the albumin falls below this level that one gets oedema) and hyperlipidaemia. In
about 20 per cent of cases of nephrotic syndrome there is haematuria. However, urine dipstick are very sensitive and this should be confirmed by sending the urine for microscopy to
see if red blood cells or red blood cell casts are visible.
The following investigations should be done:

• Blood
– cholesterol and triglyceride levels (elevated in nephrotic syndrome)
– anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT) and C3/C4 levels to investigate the possibility of
post-streptococcal disease
– antinuclear antibody (ANA), which may be positive in vasculitides such as SLE
– hepatitis B antibodies if from an at-risk population, as this is a rare cause of nephrotic syndrome
– measles and Varicella zoster antibodies (these are important to know as children who are
on immunosuppressive therapy such as steroids are more vulnerable to these conditions)
– blood culture if febrile
• Urine – microscopy and culture, spot urine protein/creatinine ratio (will be 2 in
nephrotic syndrome).
Treatment consists of prednisolone 60 mg/m2 (maximum daily dose 60 mg) given as a
single morning dose for 4 weeks followed by (if in remission, defined as urine dipstick
negative or trace for protein on three consecutive days) a prolonged reducing regime.
Because of the increased risk of bacterial infections (due to urinary losses of immunoglobulins, immunosuppressive therapy and other factors), most paediatricians administer
prophylactic penicillin until the patient is in remission.
Fluid balance is very important. Our patient does not have hypovolaemia, but this
should always be assessed, especially if the albumin is very low or if there is vomiting or diarrhoea. Four-hourly observations, including blood pressure, should be done,
weight should be assessed once or twice daily, an input/output chart should be kept, and
children should be on a low-salt diet.
There are several potential complications. Hypovolaemia may present with non-specific
symptoms, such as abdominal pain and vomiting. The haematocrit will be 0.45. It can
be treated with 0.9 per cent sodium chloride or 4.5 per cent human albumin 10–20 mL/kg
intravenously over 1 hour. Bacterial sepsis is a further important complication. Bacterial
peritonitis is the commonest type of infection and Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most
common organism, but other infections and organisms may also be involved. There is
also a risk (2–5 per cent) of thromboembolic events due to hyperviscosity. These may be
venous (e.g. renal vein thrombosis) or arterial (e.g. pulmonary embolus).
Approximately 70 per cent of patients relapse (2 proteinuria for three consecutive
days or proteinuria with oedema).
KEY POINTS

• Nephrotic syndrome consists of the combination of oedema, heavy proteinuria,
hypoalbuminaemia and hyperlipidaemia.

• Seventy per cent of patients relapse.

CASE 37:

A BED WETTER

History
Alvin is a 9-year-old black British boy who has been referred to paediatric outpatients
because of bedwetting. He is accompanied by his father. He wets the bed most nights,
does not wake up when it happens and there is a large pool of urine. He has no previous medical problems and no recent illnesses. His father says he is unsure if there is any
family history of bedwetting. They tried using an enuresis alarm 2 years ago, and the
alarm woke him up but he was already wet so they gave up after 1 week. Alvin is quite
upset about his bedwetting, particularly because he recently wet the bed when he stayed
at a friend’s house and has been teased about this at school. Alvin’s father is despairing
and has started waking him at night to go to toilet, but sometimes he is already wet. He
says this is affecting his ability to work and he feels that Alvin is being lazy and should
be able to control his bladder at this age.
Examination
His height is 140 cm (75th centile) and his weight is 35 kg (75th centile). His blood
pressure is 112/70 mmHg. Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations are

113

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 37
Nocturnal enuresis is defined as involuntary voiding of urine during sleep at least three
times per week in a child aged 5 years or older. Approximately 10 per cent of 5-yearolds and 5 per cent of 10-year-olds are affected. It is essential to establish if this is
primary or secondary. Primary nocturnal enuresis indicates that he has never achieved
dryness at night and three mechanisms may contribute to this: lack of arousal from
sleep, bladder instability or low functional bladder capacity, and nocturnal polyuria due
to low vasopressin levels. Secondary enuresis indicates that he had previously achieved
dryness at night for at least 6 months and something has happened to cause bedwetting
again. Secondary causes include constipation, urinary tract infection, diabetes mellitus
or psychosocial stresses, such as bullying or a recent parental separation. It is important to establish if there are daytime symptoms of urgency, frequency, dysuria or wetting, which suggest bladder instability or urinary tract infections. An accurate diary of
fluid intake and voiding throughout the day is helpful. A family history of bedwetting,
renal problems and sickle cell trait/disease (associated with reduced urinary concentrating ability) should be sought.
Examination should include plotting the child’s height and weight on a growth chart
and a urine analysis. In addition, the genitalia and spine should be inspected for abnormalities, and lower limb neurology should be assessed.

!

Management options for primary nocturnal enuresis

• Self help measures – regular daytime fluid intake and voiding, avoid caffeinated
•
•
•
•

drinks
Enuresis clinic support
Nocturnal polyuria – desmopressin (synthetic analogue of antidiuretic hormone)
Lack of arousal – enuresis alarm with star chart
Bladder instability – bladder retraining, anticholinergic medication

In this case, there are features of both nocturnal polyuria and lack of arousal from sleep.
Unfortunately the father is not sympathetic and unlikely to have the commitment to
make an enuresis alarm succeed. In this setting, desmopressin may provide some respite
to the family. This will reduce nocturnal urine production. It is important to emphasize
early that this is not something Alvin has any control over, that desmopressin is not a
solution in the very long term, and that ultimately he may need other methods of treatment. Desmopressin can be withdrawn in a structured fashion, assisted by the use of an
enuresis alarm, when the family are ready to support Alvin and invest some effort in his
treatment. It may take a long time to achieve consistent dryness through the night. The
family may need psychological support.
Desmopressin can cause headache, nausea and abdominal pain, and may be dangerous if
there is excessive fluid intake.
KEY POINTS

• Nocturnal enuresis is very common and should only be investigated in children older
than 5 years.

• It is essential to establish if nocturnal enuresis is primary or secondary.

This child is most likely to have essential (idiopathic) hypertension. This is associated
with obesity. Hypertension in pubertal children is most often essential but in prepubertal
children there is often a cause.
However, first the diagnosis of hypertension needs to be confirmed. The blood pressure
should only be measured after the child has been seated and calm for 5 min. The BP cuff
should cover more than three-quarters of the upper right arm and the bladder 50 per
cent of the arm circumference (too small a cuff will lead to an artificially high blood
pressure). The reading should be repeated at least once. In cases of mild hypertension
with no target organ damage (the majority), the blood pressure should be repeated at
least three times at weekly intervals to determine if the elevation is sustained. Ideally,
24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should also be carried out to confirm the
diagnosis and to rule out white-coat hypertension. There are charts available with centiles for childrens’ blood pressure which are dependent on sex, age and height centile. A
systolic or diastolic blood pressure 95th centile denotes hypertension. Headaches can
occur in hypertension. In Nikita’s case, the cause may be hypertension or the commoner
tension type headache. Any obese child can get striae; in Cushing’s disease they tend to
be purple rather than pink.

Causes of hypertension (use the mnemonic – CREED)

•
•
•
•
•

Cardiological, e.g. coarctation of the aorta
Renal, e.g. glomerulonephritis, renal artery stenosis
Essential
Endocrine, e.g. thyrotoxicosis, Cushing’s disease, phaeochromocytoma
Drugs, e.g. steroids, contraceptive pill, amphetamines

To confirm the diagnosis, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring should be performed. Renal disease is the commonest cause of hypertension and a renal ultrasound
(ideally with Doppler studies of the renal vessels) should be done. Cardiac pathology is
the second commonest cause. The presence of palpable femoral pulses makes a coarctation unlikely. However, an ECG should still be performed to see if the hypertension has
led to left ventricular hypertrophy. To investigate the consequences of obesity, a fasting
glucose (to rule out type 2 diabetes) and fasting cholesterol and triglyceride levels should
be done. Further investigations will depend on confirmation of the hypertension by the
ambulatory monitoring and clinical symptomatology.
The management plan should include lifestyle changes. A referral to a dietician should
be done and advice given about a low-salt and a low-fat diet. A total of 1 hour of exercise every day should be recommended. If the raised blood pressure is confirmed, a betablocker or calcium channel blocker could be used.
KEY POINTS

• The blood pressure should be measured with the child calm, with the right size of
cuff, and be repeated.

• Published centile charts should be consulted.
• Hypertension in pubertal children is most often essential but in prepubertal children
there is usually a cause (most commonly renal).

CASE 39:

FEVER AND A RASH

History
Euan, a 2-year-old boy, is referred to the paediatric day unit by his GP with a history of
fever, cough, blocked runny nose and sticky eyes for 6 days. His GP prescribed amoxicillin 2 days ago for otitis media, and that evening he started to develop a rash around his
ears and hairline. His parents stopped giving the antibiotics, but the rash continued to
spread over most of his body.
The parents report that he has been very miserable and lethargic for the last 5 days.
They thought the rash may be an allergic reaction to amoxicillin. He attends nursery but
his parents are not aware of any other children there who have been unwell. His parents
are well, and he has an older brother who has autism.

Examination
Euan has a temperature of 38.5C, his heart rate is 115 beats/min, respiratory rate 20/min,
and oxygen saturation is 97 per cent in air. He weighs 14 kg (75th centile) and he is
miserable and lethargic. He has a widespread maculopapular erythematous rash, which
is coalescing over his face, neck and torso. Heart sounds are normal, capillary refill time
is 2 s. There is no respiratory distress but he is coughing and there are lots of transmitted upper airway noises heard throughout his chest. His abdomen is normal. His nose is
streaming with catarrh and he has a purulent discharge from his right ear. His pharynx
is red and he has exudative conjunctivitis.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What essential piece of history has been omitted?
• What complications may arise from this disease and why has its incidence increased
recently in the UK?

ANSWER 39
This is a case of measles. The history is typical, commencing with a catarrhal prodrome
phase of fever, conjunctivitis, cough and coryza, preceding development of the rash 3–5
days later. During the catarrhal phase, Koplik’s spots may be seen as small white spots
on the buccal mucosa. Although pathognomonic of measles, they can be very hard to
find and have usually disappeared within 1 day of the rash starting. The rash is maculopapular and starts around the hairline and behind the ears, spreading downwards across
the body. It often becomes confluent on the upper body, resulting in a blotchy appearance. Usually children with measles are very miserable.

An immunization history is an essential part of any paediatric history and no details
have been provided here. In fact, Euan had not received the combined measles, mumps
and rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is usually given at 13 months of age.

•
•
•

Pneumonia
Corneal ulceration
Suppurative otitis media
Gastroenteritis
Febrile convulsions
Encephalomyelitis (rare) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (very rare)

Public confidence and uptake of the MMR vaccine fell in the UK following media publicity about a study in 1998 suggesting a link between the vaccine and autism. Despite
many publications demonstrating the safety of MMR, and specifically that there is no
link to autism, the rate of MMR vaccination in the population fell below that needed to
afford herd immunity and cases of measles increased. Measles is a notifiable disease, and
prompt notification of suspected cases to the Health Protection Agency allows steps to
be taken to minimize further spread and protect those exposed.
KEY POINTS

• Measles has become more common in the UK following a reduction in MMR vaccine
uptake.

• Measles has a typical catarrhal phase before onset of the rash.
• The rash evolves in a characteristic fashion, starting around the hairline and behind
the ears and spreading downwards.

• Measles is a notifiable disease.

History
Michael is a 7-year-old boy brought to the A&E department by his father at 10pm. He
has had an intermittent fever and backache for the last 48 hours, has vomited three
times, had two loose stools and an episode of violent shivering this evening. He was
previously healthy, except for frequent abdominal pain during the last school term,
not associated with any change in bowel habit. His parents are originally from Nigeria,
although he was born in this country. He has frequently travelled to Nigeria in the summer holidays and returned from his most recent trip 1 week ago. He has received all his
routine immunizations according to the UK schedule.
Examination
He looks flushed and withdrawn. His heart rate is 130 beats/min, capillary refill is less
than 2 s, respiratory rate 40/min, oxygen saturation 97 per cent in air, and temperature is 39C. He has no murmurs, breath sounds are normal throughout the chest, he is
uncomfortable on abdominal examination, but has no guarding or rebound tenderness.
Ears, nose and throat are unremarkable. There is no obvious rash, no lymphadenopathy
and no evidence of jaundice.

ANSWER 40
In any traveller returning from a malaria endemic area, it is absolutely essential to do
an urgent thick blood film to look for malaria parasites, and many hospitals now also
use a rapid diagnostic test kit to identify the presence of malaria antigens in the blood.
It is also important to obtain blood cultures, liver function tests, urine dipstick and, in
view of this patient’s tachypnoea, a blood gas sample (to look for acidosis) and possibly
a chest X-ray. Michael’s blood film showed 1 per cent parasitaemia with Plasmodium
falciparum and the rapid diagnostic test was positive. Malaria cannot be diagnosed or
excluded on clinical grounds, and may coexist with other infections. Blood films must be
done and three negative films are required to exclude the diagnosis. Thrombocytopenia
is commonly seen in malaria, but cannot be relied upon to make the diagnosis.

The differential diagnosis of fever in the returning child traveller can be very wide,
including haematuria, malaria, typhoid and all of the causes of childhood fever in
their home country (e.g. tonsillitis, myalgia, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, etc).
Frequently the cause of the fever is not an unusual or exotic infection at all, even if it
was acquired abroad.
An adequate travel history includes details of exactly where the child visited (especially
whether urban or rural), what sort of accommodation they stayed in, what activities
they did during their visit, and what immunizations and malaria prophylaxis they had.
Michael did not take any prophylaxis because his parents felt malaria was not a serious
illness.
Treatment should be started promptly, guided by advice from an expert in infectious diseases. A variety of oral treatment options are available for uncomplicated malaria, but
intravenous quinine remains the standard treatment for severe disease. Broad-spectrum
antibiotic cover should also be given in the case of a seriously unwell child.
KEY POINTS

• Fever in a traveller returning from a malaria-endemic area is malaria until proven
otherwise.

• Non-specific symptoms should not be interpreted as ruling out the diagnosis.
• Prompt initiation of treatment is essential.

STICKY EYES

History
Jenna is a 5-day-old girl who is brought to her GP because she has had sticky eyes for
2 days. The GP notes that there is a purulent discharge filling both eyes, and it is very
hard to see the conjunctiva clearly. He refers her to the on-call paediatric team. She was
born at term by normal vaginal delivery to a 19-year-old first-time mother after an
uneventful pregnancy. Her birth weight was 2.75 kg (ninth centile). Her mother smoked
throughout pregnancy and drank some alcohol. She had erratic attendance for antenatal
care and had refused antenatal screening blood tests. She was discharged from hospital
after 12 hours and the baby has been bottle-fed since.
Examination
Jenna looks healthy apart from swollen eyelids with profuse purulent discharge and erythematous conjunctiva. She weighs 2.8 kg. She is afebrile, with a heart rate of 140/min,
a respiratory rate of 35/min, normal heart sounds and normal breath sounds. Her abdomen is soft and the liver is palpable 1 cm below the costal margin. Her anterior fontanelle is normotensive.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 41
Jenna has ophthalmia neonatorum (neonatal conjunctival infection) caused by Neisseria
gonorrhoeae. The differential diagnosis of sticky eyes in a neonate includes nasolacrimal
duct obstruction, Chlamydia trachomatis, herpes simplex and other bacterial conjunctivitis (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae). Inflammation of the conjunctiva is not seen in nasolacrimal duct obstruction, although the eyes may be sticky.
Ophthalmia neonatorum is an emergency and requires prompt management to prevent
permanent visual impairment and to treat possible systemic infection.
In cases of ophthalmia neonatorum, it is essential to take adequate microbiological specimens and then commence prompt antibiotic treatment. Swabs for chlamydia
are usually different from those used for other bacteria and it is necessary to look for
both as chlamydia and gonococcal infections can coexist. Gonococcal ophthalmia neonatorum should be treated with intravenous ceftriaxone or cefotaxime and frequent eye
irrigation with saline solution. Many experts would also add antibiotic eye drops. The
neonate should be evaluated for disseminated infection, although this is unlikely in this
infant, who is afebrile and appears systemically well. Ophthalmia neonatorum is a notifiable disease.
Jenna’s mother should be told that this is a sexually transmitted infection (STI), which
Jenna has almost certainly acquired from the birth canal. It can cause asymptomatic infection in women, but also causes symptomatic infection of the genital tract, pelvic inflammatory disease and perihepatitis. It is very important that she attends a genitourinary
medicine clinic for treatment and screening for other STIs and considers discussing this
with her partner(s). It is also important to have a more thorough discussion about her
social circumstances and why she declined antenatal screening blood tests.
KEY POINTS

• Ophthalmia neonatorum requires prompt recognition and systemic treatment.
• Appropriate specimens must be sent for both gonococcus and chlamydia.
• The mother must be advised that she and her partner(s) will require screening.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 42
Fever and rash are very common in paediatrics. Most rashes are non-specific viral rashes
but some illnesses are accompanied by typical rashes. For instance, chickenpox is characterized by a maculopapular rash that evolves into vesicles and meningococcal septicaemia by a petechial non-blanching rash.
The most likely diagnosis in this case is Kawasaki’s disease which is a vasculitis. This disorder occurs mainly in young children (80 per cent 5 years). It is diagnosed clinically.
Criteria for diagnosis are:

• The presence of a fever for 5 or more days and four of the following five features:
– non-purulent conjunctivitis
– cervical lymphadenopathy
– skin rash
– erythema of the oral and pharyngeal mucosa
– erythema and swelling of the hands and feet (followed a week later by skin
desquamation).
Accompanying features are a raised WCC, CRP and ESR. In the second week of the illness a thrombocytosis usually develops.
When assessing a child with a prolonged fever (7 days), the following conditions should
be considered.

!

Causes of a prolonged fever

•
•
•
•

Infections, e.g. tuberculosis, HIV
Malignant diseases, e.g. lymphoma
Autoimmune diseases, e.g. juvenile idiopathic arthritis
Miscellaneous, e.g. drugs, inflammatory bowel disease

Treatment consists of an infusion of immunoglobulins on the day of diagnosis, initially
high-dose aspirin at anti-inflammatory doses followed by low-dose aspirin at antithrombotic doses.
The main complication of this disorder is coronary artery aneurysms that can, in some
cases, lead to myocardial infarction and sudden death. A prolonged fever (16 days),
male sex, age 1 year, cardiomegaly, raised inflammatory markers and raised platelets
are all risk factors. An echocardiogram at diagnosis and follow-up echocardiograms are
required to rule out this complication. The prognosis is related to the cardiac complications. The risk of cardiac complications if treatment with immunoglobulins was commenced within 10 days of diagnosis is 10 per cent.
KEY POINTS

• Kawasaki’s disease should be considered in all children with a prolonged fever.
• Treatment consists of immunoglobulins and aspirin.
• The main long-term complication is coronary artery aneurysms.

RECURRENT INFECTIONS

History
Michelle is a 7-year-old girl who presents to the A&E department with a 2-day history
of fever, progressively worsening headache, vomiting and neck stiffness. She was born
in Zimbabwe and moved to the UK at 2 years of age to live with her aunt, after her
mother died from tuberculosis. She was admitted to hospital last year with pneumonia
and developed an empyema, which required drainage. Streptococcus pneumoniae was
isolated from blood cultures at that time. Since then she has had several episodes of
otitis media treated by her GP, and has been off school quite frequently. Her aunt is not
very sure about which immunizations she has received. There has not been any recent
travel.
Examination
Michelle has a temperature of 38.8C, heart rate 120 beats/min, her blood pressure is
100/65 mmHg, respiratory rate 20/min and her oxygen saturation is 96 per cent in air.
Her weight is 17 kg (second centile) and her height is 114 cm (ninth centile). She has multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes, oral candidiasis, extensive dental caries and suppurative left otitis media. There is no rash, and cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal
examinations are normal. She is alert but uncomfortable, has marked neck rigidity and
prefers the lights to be dimmed. There are no other abnormalities found on neurological

125

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 43
This child has acute bacterial meningitis, which is most likely to be due to S. pneumoniae. This diagnosis is strongly suspected from the acute history and the blood results,
and confirmed by the CSF findings (see Case 62, p. 187). It may have developed secondary to the otitis media. She should be commenced on an appropriate antibiotic (most
commonly intravenous ceftriaxone) and on intravenous dexamethasone.
Michelle has a history of recurrent infections with two of these being severe. Any child
with unusual, severe, recurrent or persistent infections must be evaluated for the possibility of an underlying immunodeficiency. In this case, recurrent S. pneumoniae infections raise concerns about hyposplenism, antibody deficiency and HIV infection. The
findings of severe dental caries, oral candidiasis and cervical lymphadenopathy, together
with the history of immigration from Zimbabwe and her mother dying from TB, strongly
suggest HIV. Testing for HIV is done with informed consent of the person with parental
responsibility for the child. If the test is positive, the child will gradually be given information and prepared for disclosure of the diagnosis when they are able to comprehend
the implications of having HIV.

CASE 44:

UNEXPLAINED WEIGHT LOSS

History
Ehsan is seen in the paediatric clinic with his mother, who speaks little English. He is 12
years old, was born in Afghanistan and moved to the UK as a refugee 3 months ago. He
was diagnosed with asthma when he was seen in the A&E department 4 weeks ago, on
the basis of a chronic nocturnal cough. Today his mother is more worried about the fact
that he has been losing weight and has had a poor appetite since coming to the UK.
Ehsan is using salbutamol and beclometasone inhalers, which have not improved his
cough. He has not yet been to school in the UK. He lives with his mother and three
younger siblings in a damp two-bedroom flat and his mother has also been coughing a
lot over the last month. His father died last year. They are uncertain which immunizations he has received, but he was healthy before coming to the UK. He has been feeling too tired to play games with his siblings for the last 4 weeks and he finds that his
clothes are all much looser than when he arrived in the UK. His mother says that he
sometimes feels hot, but she has not measured his temperature.

Examination
He is very thin, his height is 153 cm (75th centile) and his weight is 27 kg (second centile). His heart rate is 80 beats/min, his respiratory rate is 26/min, and oxygen saturation
is 97 per cent in air. There is no wheeze but there are bronchial breath sounds in the
right upper zone of his chest. There is no lymphadenopathy and his cardiovascular and

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 44
A history of weight loss with a chronic cough needs to be fully investigated. It is important to ask about the past medical history, family history and contact history with direct
questions about tuberculosis. What happened to this boy’s father? (In fact, he died in
Afghanistan after suddenly coughing up a large amount of blood.) Even if the immunization history is unknown, they may know if Ehsan has received the BCG (as this leaves
a distinctive scar) and whether he has ever been treated for TB. Ask about the onset of
the cough, whether it is productive, whether there is bloodstained sputum and if there is
any chest pain or dyspnoea. Ask about exacerbating and relieving factors. Ask when the
weight loss started and whether it is associated with abdominal pain, diarrhoea, malabsorptive (bulky, offensive) stools, nausea or vomiting. Also ask about night sweats.

Chronic renal failure
Diabetes mellitus
Malignancy
Infections, e.g. tuberculosis, HIV

The chest radiograph shows dense consolidation and cavitation in the right upper lobe.
The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary tuberculosis. Ehsan’s father probably died from
pulmonary tuberculosis and Ehsan’s mother probably also has pulmonary tuberculosis.
Ehsan will require admission for investigation and treatment, with isolation whilst he
may have mycobacteria in his sputum. The possibility of multidrug-resistant TB should
be considered in view of his recent immigration from Afghanistan.
The gold standard for diagnosis of tuberculosis is culture of the mycobacteria from clinical specimens. Unfortunately this is much more difficult to achieve in children than in
adults, and only possible in less than 50 per cent of cases. More often the diagnosis is
based on suggestive clinical and radiological features, history of exposure to TB, and
results of tuberculin skin testing (TST). Interpretation of the TST is affected by prior
BCG vaccination, and new tests based on the release of interferon-gamma from blood
mononuclear cells in response to antigens present in TB but not in BCG may aid diagnosis further. Ehsan will require a tuberculin skin test, sputum to be collected for microscopy and culture, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, full blood count
and liver function tests. It is more likely that his sputum will show acid-fast bacilli on
microscopy, because he has cavitating pulmonary disease. Cavities are often teeming
with mycobacteria. This presentation would be much rarer in younger children, who
rarely have cavitating disease. If he is unable to expectorate sputum by himself, techniques to induce sputum production may be attempted, and gastric aspirates may be sent
for mycobacterial culture (but their positive yield is much lower). Drug sensitivity testing

130

Infections

will be needed on cultured specimens. Ehsan and his mother should be counselled for an
HIV test, because HIV is an important risk factor for development of TB.
Standard treatment for pulmonary tuberculosis should commence with four drugs: isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and pyrazinamide. Pyridoxine is often given to adolescents
to reduce the risk of isoniazid causing peripheral neuropathy. The rest of the family
will need to be screened for evidence of active or latent tuberculosis. Latent tuberculosis occurs when a person has been infected with TB, but, rather than causing disease,
the mycobacteria become dormant. Individuals with latent tuberculosis are generally
not infectious to others but are at risk of developing active tuberculosis in the future.
Chemoprophylaxis (a course of one or two anti-tuberculous drugs) is advised for latent
infection.
Tuberculosis is a notifiable disease and the incidence has been increasing in the UK. The
majority of cases occur in non-UK-born young adults.

KEY POINTS

• Suspicion of tuberculosis should be high in children from high-incidence countries
with a compatible clinical history.

• The likelihood of obtaining a positive sputum smear or culture in children with
pulmonary tuberculosis is much lower than in adults.

• Diagnosis of tuberculosis is often made on the basis of likelihood of exposure,
clinical and radiological findings and tuberculin skin testing.

CASE 45:

AN ITCHY RASH

History
Diamond is a 3-year-old boy who presents to his GP with an itchy rash that he has had
for 4 days. He is otherwise well. He had bronchiolitis at the age of 4 months but has had
no other diseases. He is not on any medication. His 5-year-old brother has eczema and
his father has hay fever. He attends nursery three times a week. The family live in a onebedroom flat which is damp. His father smokes 20 cigarettes a day.
Examination
He is systemically well and apyrexial. He is very itchy, cannot stop scratching and has
obvious linear scratch marks. He has papules, pustules with some associated crusting and
a few vesicles. The fingers, hands, flexor surfaces of the arms, axilla and feet seem to be
the worst affected areas but there are also lesions around the umbilicus and on the face.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the differential diagnosis of an itchy rash in a child?
• What is the treatment?

133

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 45
The most likely diagnosis is scabies. This is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei and is
highly contagious. Intense itching is typical. However, in children under 1 year this may
present as irritability. A history of contact may be present. The classic features are burrows, papules, vesicles and pustules. Thread-like, linear burrows, typically in the finger
webs and wrists, are pathognomonic but are often difficult to see. Definitive diagnosis
involves removal of the mite from the burrow and examination under the microscope,
but this, too, is difficult. Secondary bacterial infection due to scratching is common.
In infants, the rash usually affects the palms, soles, axilla and scalp. In older children,
lesions typically involve the web space between the fingers, the flexor aspects of the
wrist and arm, the axilla and the waistline. The face is rarely involved in those over 5
years of age. Other areas of the body can also be affected. Although there is a strong
family history of atopy, the patient has never had eczema and it would be unusual for
eczema to present for the first time at this age in this way.
Common causes of an itchy rash in a child are:

•
•
•
•
•
•

eczema – very common, often involves face, elbow and knee flexures
seborrhoeic dermatitis – affects infants, often in association with cradle cap
scabies – itchy where mite has burrowed
insect bites – affects uncovered areas such as arms and legs
drug allergy
urticaria – idiopathic or secondary to allergens, consists of wheal (raised and white)
and flare (red)
• fungal infections – e.g. tinea capitis or tinea pedis (athlete’s foot)
• chickenpox.
Treatment consists of the application of scabicidal medication, e.g. permethrin. Family
members and ‘kissing contacts’ should also be treated. Topical or oral antibiotics may
also be required to treat secondary bacterial infection. Oral antihistamines and topical
steroids, e.g. 1 per cent hydrocortisone, may be needed to help treat the itching. All clothing and bed linen should be laundered to remove eggs and mites. It can take 4–6 weeks
for the itching to resolve. If lesions are still present at this time, persistent infection or
reinfection should be suspected and treatment may need repeating.

KEY POINTS

• Scabies infestation causes severe itching.
• The classic features are linear burrows, papules, vesicles and pustules.
• The treatment of choice is permethrin.

CASE 46:

DETERIORATING ECZEMA

History
George is a 2-year-old boy who presents to the paediatric rapid referral clinic with a
worsening of his eczema. The latter was diagnosed by the GP when he was 6 months
old. He has been treated with a variety of emollients and topical steroids which are
applied on an intermittent, as-required basis. The parents report that over the last 3
days the eczema has gradually deteriorated and also become more itchy. George also has
asthma which is treated with inhaled budesonide twice a day and inhaled salbutamol on
an as-required basis. His mother had eczema as a child but grew out of it and his father
has hay fever.
Examination
George is well hydrated. His temperature is 38.3C, he is itchy and miserable. He has
widespread eczema all over his body, which is worst on his face, hands and arms where
the skin feels moist (see Fig. 46.1). A number of vesicles and some punched-out lesions
can be seen on the face, hands and arms. There are also pustules and some areas of
honey-coloured crusting in those areas. In some areas the lesions have coalesced. The
marked scratching that has taken place makes the exact nature of the lesions more difficult to determine. His eyes are puffy and there are some surrounding lesions. The eyes
themselves appear normal but are difficult to assess fully. There is cervical, axillary and
inguinal lymphadenopathy. His chest is clear.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 46
A blood culture should have been done at the same time as the other blood tests, as
there is a small possibility that he may have a septicaemia. Skin swabs should be taken
for bacteriology and virology (virology swabs require special viral medium).
The diagnosis is eczema herpeticum with superadded bacterial infection. It would be
worth asking if the child has had similar previous episodes or if anyone in the family
has herpetic cold sores. Eczema herpeticum is caused by herpes simplex virus infection
of eczematous skin. The infection spreads along the skin and haematogenously. Vesicles
and pustules occur and these may coalesce, erode the skin and become haemorrhagic
and crusted. The lesions can disseminate rapidly and may cause life-threatening infection. Eczema herpeticum may also affect the conjunctiva and cornea and can cause a
keratitis that, if left untreated, may lead to blindness. The diagnosis is sometimes made
when a patient fails to respond to antibacterial therapy. The raised temperature, WCC
and CRP indicate that the infection is severe, and the lymphocytosis is suggestive of a
viral infection. The diagnosis can be made by microscopy, culture or viral PCR.
Bacterial infection can also lead to an acute deterioration in eczema (and is more common
than herpetic infection). The pathogen is usually Staphylococcus aureus and occasionally
Streptococcus. Staphylococcal infection can lead to honey-coloured crusting, as in this
case. In our case, the secondary bacterial infection is most likely to be due to scratching,
leading to the Staphylococcus that often colonizes the skin, causing infection.
In some cases it can be difficult to determine if the eczema has been infected by bacteria
or viruses and both need to be treated.
The lymphadenopathy is secondary to the infected eczema.
In some cases of widespread infected eczema, there can be marked fluid loss from the
skin, which may be exacerbated in the presence of a temperature. In this case the patient
is well hydrated, but hydration should be carefully monitored (the situation is somewhat analogous to fluid loss in a burn). Intravenous acyclovir should be administered.
If there is any concern about possible eye involvement, as in this case, an urgent ophthalmic opinion should be sought. In addition, intravenous antibiotics (e.g. co-amoxiclav)
should be given because of the superadded bacterial skin infection and possible septicaemia. Analgesics, antipyretics and anti-pruritic agents, i.e. antihistamines, should be prescribed. Topical treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressants (e.g. tacrolimus)
should be discontinued (this is in contrast to bacterial infections alone when steroid
creams are usually continued alongside the antibiotic). Topical treatments can usually be
restarted after 1 week when the patient has improved.
KEY POINTS

• Herpetic infection can lead to severe worsening of eczema (eczema herpeticum).
• Bacterial infection is the commonest cause for an acute deterioration in eczema, with
the commonest pathogen being Staphylococcus aureus.

AN INFANT WITH BLISTERS

History
Amy is an 8-day-old infant referred to the paediatric day unit by the midwife. In the past
24 hours she has developed several blisters in the nappy area plus a few on her trunk
and arms. Amy was born at 38 weeks’ gestation, following an uneventful pregnancy, to
healthy, unrelated parents. There were no risk factors for infection (e.g. prolonged rupture
of membranes). She is their first baby. Her mother has quite severe eczema and asthma.
Amy is breast-feeding well and has regained her birth weight.
Examination
Amy looks generally well. Her temperature is 36.8C. There are no dysmorphic features. Her
pulse is 130 beats/min and her capillary refill time 2 s. Scattered over her skin (see Fig. 47.1)
in the described distribution she has several flaccid, transparent, cloudy, fluid-filled bullae
of varying size from 2 to 15 mm in diameter. One or two have ruptured, leaving a shallow,
moist erosion.

Figure 47.1 Amy’s skin.

Amy also has a 5-mm-diameter soft glistening pink lesion within the umbilicus where the cord
has dropped off. It bleeds a little on contact and there is a small blood stain on her nappy.
Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is unremarkable. Her
anterior fontanelle is soft. She handles well and has normal tone and primitive reflexes.

Questions

• What is the management?
• What is the umbilical lesion likely to be, and how would you treat it?

141

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER
These flaccid, fragile blisters are characteristic of bullous impetigo. This is the localized
presentation of the staphylococcal scalded-skin syndrome and patients are otherwise
well. At the other end of the spectrum are those who present with generalized cutaneous
involvement and systemic illness. Both are caused by Staphylococcus aureus, most of
which are from phage group 2. In bullous impetigo the organism can be cultured from
the lesions but the systemic form is mediated by exfoliative toxins and swabs are sterile.
The common weepy, golden, crusty forms of impetigo start on skin that has been damaged, e.g. by insect bites, chickenpox or abrasions. It spreads easily to other sites and to
other children. The causative organism is also usually Staphylococcus aureus but generally not from phage group 2. Group A β-haemolytic Streptococcus can also cause impetigo.
Patients with eczema are at increased risk of infective exacerbations due to these organisms.
It is likely that this baby’s infection was transmitted from her mother, either because of her
eczema or because she has mastitis.
A much rarer cause of blistering in the neonatal period is epidermolysis bullosa. There
are several different types that differ in severity, clinical features, distribution and inheritance patterns, but all are characterized by blisters that develop with trauma and are
exacerbated in warm weather. Blisters present at birth would be strongly supportive of
this diagnosis.
Treatment is with a β-lactamase-resistant antibiotic such as co-amoxiclav. This infant is
well and so the oral route can be safely used whilst monitoring for a satisfactory response.
In systemic scalded skin syndrome, antibiotics are administered parenterally. Such patients
need careful monitoring because they are at risk of significant heat and fluid losses. They
also require adequate pain relief.
The umbilical lesion is likely to be a granuloma. The umbilical cord usually dries and separates within 6–8 days after birth and the surface epithelializes. Where this is incomplete
or there is mild infection, granulation tissue can develop and persist. A granuloma is not
painful. A number of treatments are available, including cauterization using a silver nitrate
stick. This can be repeated once a week until the lesion has resolved. It is crucial to differentiate the common umbilical granuloma from the rare umbilical polyp which results
from persistence of the omphalomesenteric duct or the urachus. If it communicates with the
ileum or bladder, there may a faeculant or urinary discharge. Treatment is surgical.
KEY POINTS

• Skin infections due to Staphyococcus aureus have a range of presentations from mild,
localized lesions to severe, systemic infections.

• Blistering present at birth is likely to be due to epidermolysis bullosa.

A PALE CHILD

History
Sarah is a 4-year-old girl who is referred to the paediatric day unit by her GP with a 2-day
history of widespread bruising. She has also had two nosebleeds in the preceding 24 hours.
There are no known injuries, although her mother says she is quite ‘hectic’, especially when
playing with her younger brother. They both had a cold and a sore throat 2 weeks previously. She is otherwise very well. There is no significant past medical or family history and
she is on no medication.
Examination
Sarah is drawing pictures and is cheerful and cooperative. She has no dysmorphic features. Her height and weight are on the 25th centiles. There is no jaundice and she is
afebrile. She is pale and clinically anaemic with a few 1.0 cm lymph nodes in the cervical
and inguinal regions. There is widespread bruising mainly on her limbs but no evidence
of active bleeding. There is no hepatosplenomegaly. Her pulse is 96 beats/min and both
heart sounds are normal. She has a grade 2/6 ejection systolic murmur. Examination of the

143

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 48
Sarah has pancytopenia, loss of all bone marrow (BM) elements. This is not a diagnosis
and needs further investigation.

!

Differential diagnosis of pancytopenia
Bone marrow failure

• Inherited – all rare. Commonest is Fanconi’s anaemia. Excess chromosome

•

breaks. Defective DNA repair, decreased cell survival and susceptible to oxidant
stress. Associated physical abnormalities, e.g. skeletal (absent thumbs), short
stature. Only cure is a BM transplant.
Acquired
– viral, e.g. hepatitis, herpes, Epstein–Barr
– drugs – idiosyncratic, e.g. chloramphenicol, anticonvulsants, or predictable,
e.g. chemotherapy; 80 per cent are ‘idiopathic aplastic anaemia’.

Bone marrow infiltration

• Malignancy, e.g. leukaemia or neuroblastoma. Rarely myelofibrosis and
myelodysplasia.

Bone marrow infiltration causes marrow expansion and pain unless it is slowly progressive
as in myelofibrosis. There are also likely to be other symptoms and signs, e.g. lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly in leukaemia. Significantly enlarged lymph nodes are usually 1 cm in diameter. Despite her pallor, this child is playing happily, making BM failure
more likely. About 20 per cent of patients with inherited pancytopenias have none of the
associated features so an inherited cause cannot be excluded clinically, but these conditions are rare. This girl probably has an acquired pancytopenia – probably idiopathic aplastic anaemia (AA). Most cases appear to be caused by activated T-lymphocytes, producing
cytokines that suppress haematopoiesis. Her mild tachycardia and murmur are most likely
due to a hyperdynamic circulation secondary to anaemia. An echocardiogram may be indicated if it does not disappear or diminish following transfusion.

!

Investigation of pancytopenia

•
•
•
•
•
•

Blood film – detailed morphology of all cell lines
Red cell indices – the anaemia in AA is normocytic or mildly macrocytic
Reticulocytes – 20  109/L suggests severe aplastic anaemia
Viral titres – hepatitis, Epstein–Barr, parvovirus (usually causes red cell aplasia)
Chromosomes for breakage analysis
BM aspirate and trephine – to assess morphology and cellularity of the cells and
to exclude infiltration. In AA it is hypocellular but the remaining cells are normal

Management pending a diagnosis and treatment is supportive. Haemorrhage and infection are her two major risks. However, there is a danger with multiple platelet transfusions of developing antibodies (alloimmunization). These can cause a typical transfusion
reaction with fevers and rigors, but more importantly can diminish the increment in
platelet count. This risk is minimized by restricting transfusions to episodes of active
bleeding and/or a platelet count of 5  109/L. Neutropenia, especially if prolonged,
puts her at risk of serious life-threatening bacterial infections and the family should be
given instructions about regular monitoring of her temperature and when to seek advice.
144

Haematology

Spontaneous recovery of idiopathic aplastic anaemia is rare. The decision to embark on
definitive treatment depends upon the severity. BM transplant (BMT) offers the best chance
for those with a matched sibling donor. Otherwise, immunosuppressive treatment with
antithymocyte globulin and cyclosporin is the main alternative. If this fails, a matched,
unrelated-donor BMT is the only option.
KEY POINTS

• Pancytopenia can be due to bone marrow failure or bone marrow infiltration.
• The most important risks from pancytopenia are bleeding and infection.

147

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 49
The diagnosis is idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP). This condition is caused by
antibodies to platelets. The history of a viral infection 2 weeks prior to the onset of the
ITP is typical, as is the isolated, very low platelet count in an otherwise well child.

!

Causes of purpura in a child

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Infections
Thrombocytopenia secondary to ITP, leukaemia or chemotherapy
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) and other vasculitides
Vomiting or coughing
Trauma
Clotting disorders
Drugs, e.g. steroids

Meningococcal septicaemia is an important cause of purpura. However, the absence
of a temperature and the normal inflammatory markers make this diagnosis unlikely.
Viral infections, e.g. cytomegalovirus, can cause purpura. The lesions are usually small
( 2 mm) and the diagnosis is often made by elimination. The absence of signs such as
hepatosplenomegaly and blasts in the film makes leukaemia unlikely. HSP is characterized by a purpuric rash on the extensor surfaces of the lower limbs, joint swelling and
blood and/or protein in the urine. Children with vomiting and/or coughing can get purpura in the drainage distribution of the superior vena cava. Accidental or non-accidental
trauma does not present with generalized purpura. Clotting disorders more frequently
present with haemarthrosis.
No further investigations are required. A bone marrow examination is only indicated if
there are atypical clinical features which suggest possible leukaemia. It should also be
performed prior to steroid treatment to definitely exclude leukaemia that may be partially
treated by steroids.
Treatment is controversial. Most doctors would not treat Ahmed. Approximately 4 per cent
of children with ITP have serious symptoms such as severe epistaxis or gastrointestinal
bleeding. The most serious complication is an intracranial haemorrhage, the incidence of
which is 0.1–0.5 per cent.
The indications for treatment are based on symptoms and not on the platelet count
alone. If the child has mucous membrane bleeding and extensive cutaneous symptoms,
prednisolone should be administered. Intravenous immunoglobulin can raise the platelet
count more rapidly than steroids. However, it carries the risks of pooled blood products
and has side-effects, e.g. headache. It should be reserved for the emergency treatment of
patients with serious bleeding.
Platelet transfusions are only indicated in the case of an intracranial haemorrhage or to
treat life-threatening bleeding. Splenectomy is rarely needed.
Activities with a high risk of trauma should be avoided. Medication, such as ibuprofen,
that can affect platelet function should also be avoided.

148

Haematology

A repeat full blood count should be performed at 7–10 days to ensure that there is no
evolving bone marrow disorder, e.g. aplasia. ITP is usually a self-limiting disorder. Fifty
per cent resolve in 2 months, 75 per cent in 4 months and 90 per cent in 6 months.

KEY POINTS

• Treatment in ITP should be guided by symptoms rather than the platelet count.
• The most serious complication is an intracranial haemorrhage.
• Meningococcal septicaemia is an important cause of purpura that requires urgent
treatment.

151

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 50
Rebekah has acute sickle chest syndrome. Thrombosis, infection and fat embolism to
the lung produce a syndrome of pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath and fever. The
pathology often evolves from the lung bases and produces consolidation, which may be
clinically apparent before radiographic changes appear. Hypoxia is a frequent feature,
and failure to recognize and manage this syndrome aggressively may lead to a rapid
deterioration. Compare the initial chest radiograph (which shows just a small patch of
consolidation in the left lower lobe behind the heart) with the one taken 2 days later
(which shows more extensive bi-basal consolidation – see Fig. 50.2).

Figure 50.2 Rebekah’s chest radiograph
2 days later.

Sickling of red blood cells and their sequestration in vessels is exacerbated by dehydration, hypoxia and acidosis, so these factors need to be corrected with hyperhydration
and supplemental oxygen. Adequate analgesia (often intravenous morphine) and physiotherapy help the patient to breathe deeply enough to ventilate the affected areas of the
lungs. Empirical antibiotic treatment should be started, e.g. co-amoxiclav and clarithromycin. Children with acute sickle chest syndrome should be discussed with a senior
paediatrician and a haematologist. If they deteriorate, they may require ventilatory
support (continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) or intubation and ventilation).
A top-up or exchange blood transfusion may also be needed to reduce the percentage of
sickling red blood cells.

Haematology

Children with sickle cell disease develop hyposplenism, which makes them particularly
vulnerable to infection with encapsulated bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae and
Streptococcus pneumoniae. They should receive all routine immunizations, pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine, and regular penicillin V prophylaxis. Hepatitis B vaccine is recommended, and if they travel to a malaria-endemic area, it is essential they take adequate
prophylaxis.

• Children with sickle cell disease are vulnerable to infections with encapsulated
bacteria.

• Complications of sickle cell disease can affect any organ.

heterogeneous mass arising from the right kidney. There is no evidence of calcification

Questions
• What is the commonest cause of an abdominal mass in childhood?
• What is the most likely diagnosis in this case?
• Where should he be managed?
• What complication has arisen?

155

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 51
The commonest cause of an abdominal mass – occasionally huge – in childhood is faeces.
It is characteristically craggy, mobile and in the lower abdomen. However, abdominal
masses in children should be assumed to be malignant until proven otherwise, and if
there is any doubt, imaging with ultrasound is required.
In an otherwise healthy asymptomatic child, the most likely diagnosis is a Wilms’
tumour or nephroblastoma, a neoplasm of the kidney comprising approximately 6 per
cent of childhood cancers; 7 per cent are bilateral. It is not unusual for these to present
after parents have found the mass incidentally. Wilms’ tumours may be associated with
hemihypertrophy, aniridia (hypoplastic iris commonly associated with macular and optic
nerve hypoplasia) and other congenital abnormalities, usually of the genitourinary tract.
Children with Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome (mutations at 11p15.5, hemihypertrophy,
macroglossia and visceromegaly) have such an increased risk of Wilms’ (approximately
4 per cent) that they are screened regularly during early childhood.
The main differential diagnosis is neuroblastoma (NB) – an embryonal cancer of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. Most arise in the abdomen either in an adrenal gland or
in the retroperitoneal sympathetic ganglia. The mass usually causes discomfort. Sadly, children with NB often present with symptoms of metastatic spread, such as fever, bone pain,
irritability and weight loss – unusual in Wilms’. Tumour markers and imaging help distinguish the two. Ninety-five per cent of NB patients have raised urine vanillylmandelic acid
(VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA). Unlike NB, Wilms’ tumours rarely calcify.
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for Wilms’ tumour with pre- and post-surgery
chemotherapy and radiotherapy depending on the stage. The prognosis for Wilms’ is
excellent, with stage 1–3 patients having an overall cure rate of 88–98 per cent. Those
with stage 4 disease, with distant metastases, have a poorer but still relatively favourable
prognosis of about 75 per cent.
There is good evidence that prognosis in all childhood cancers improves in children
managed by specialist units, although some care can be local on a ‘shared care’ basis.
Centralization of care, multidisciplinary teams, entry into randomized controlled trials
and the use of national or international protocols have steadily improved the prognosis
in all childhood cancers.
His BP is high for a child of his age. Children dislike having their BP measured so it can
be difficult to measure accurately. There are electronic devices commonly in use but
their results should be interpreted with caution and every effort made to measure BP
with standard equipment. The cuff width should be at least two-thirds of the distance
from the elbow to the shoulder. Normative ranges according to sex, age and height centile exist for children and adolescents. They are presented as percentiles, with the 95th
percentile defining hypertension. In Wilms’ tumour, BP is often raised at presentation,
probably due to ischaemia. It may persist for several months even after the primary has
been removed and may need drug treatment.
KEY POINTS

• Abdominal masses in children are malignant until proven otherwise.
• Wilms’ tumour can be associated with congenital anomalies.
• The care of all children with cancer should be coordinated by specialist centres.

CASE 52:

AN UNSTEADY CHILD

History
Toby is a 4.5-year-old boy referred to children’s outpatients by his GP with a history of
apparent stiffness in his neck. About 6 weeks previously he complained of a ‘dizzy head’
and became reluctant to walk home after school. Subsequently he seemed to find it difficult to look upwards but seemed fine when looking from side to side. He has also been
rubbing his head and crying. In the past 3 weeks Toby has had several episodes of vomiting and at the time holds his neck in pain. There have been no other gastrointestinal
symptoms nor any fevers and there has been some improvement with paracetamol.
Toby has become increasingly clumsy and has had several unexpected falls even when
sitting. Having walked up stairs independently, he now wants to hold the rail or someone’s hand and no longer runs with confidence. He has fallen off his tricycle twice and
no longer wants to ride it.
Toby is the youngest of three children and has no significant past medical or family history. He had chickenpox 3 years ago. Up to now his development has been normal and
he is fully immunized.

Examination
Toby appears a generally healthy boy with his height and weight on the 25th centiles
and his head circumference on the 50th centile. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy
and passive movements of his neck are normal, although he is reluctant to look up to
the ceiling. His pulse is 88 beats/min and his blood pressure is 85/60 mmHg. There are
no murmurs, and examination of the respiratory and abdominal systems is unremarkable. There are no neurocutaneous markers. There is no nystagmus and external ocular
movements are normal. Fundoscopy is very difficult because he screws up his eyes, but
a brief glimpse of the right fundus suggests blurred disc margins. The remainder of the
cranial nerves appear normal. He has a broad-based, unsteady gait and cannot walk heel
to toe. However, muscle bulk, tone, power and reflexes are normal in both arms and
legs. He is very unsteady when standing with his eyes shut. He tries very hard with the
finger–nose test but misses both every time, nor can he touch his nose accurately with
his eyes shut. He can pick up small objects without a problem.
Questions
• What movement disorder do these symptoms and signs describe?
• Where is the pathology likely to be located and what complication has arisen?
• What investigation does he need?

157

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 52
Toby has symptoms and signs of ataxia – the inability to make smooth, accurate and
coordinated movements. Observation during play is the key to much of the neurological
examination in a child. It is crucial to take account of the developmental stage of the
child – a broad-based, unsteady gait is normal for a child who is just starting to walk
but not in a previously confident 4-year-old. Other tests of ataxia include the heel–shin
test and dysdiadochokinesia, but he is probably too young for these to be interpretable. Make these formal parts fun and most children will very happily do their best.
Remember that, by definition, all tests for movement disorders require the ability to
move; hence tone and power must be assessed. Similarly he must be able to see to do
the coordination tests.
Ataxia is usually due to disorders of the cerebellum and/or the sensory pathways in
the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The neck pain, rubbing of his head in distress
and vomiting are highly suggestive of raised intracranial pressure (ICP). Unfortunately,
this is frequently missed in children because they are poor at localizing pain and the
symptoms are relatively non-specific and common. Fundoscopy is notoriously difficult
in children because they don’t cooperate and you may only get the briefest glimpse.
Hypertension and bradycardia are usually late signs when the child is obtunded. The
classic early morning headache and effortless vomiting of adults with raised ICP is less
common in children.
The cerebellum is therefore the most likely location for the pathology, with the raised
ICP being due to hydrocephalus secondary to obstruction of the fourth ventricle. It could
be due to a congenital anomaly of the cerebellum, such as the Dandy–Walker syndrome
or a Chiari malformation, but his symptoms are relatively recent. Vomiting is a major
feature of acute cerebellar ataxia following a viral illness such as chickenpox, but the
onset is sudden and often severe with nystagmus and dysarthria and the other symptoms and signs of raised ICP are often absent. A space-occupying lesion is most likely in
our case.
In children, two-thirds of brain tumours are located in the posterior fossa compared with
one-third in adults. Toby needs an urgent MRI (or CT) scan.

Figure 52.1 Sagittal MRI scan of Toby’s brain.
158

Oncology

The MRI scan (Fig. 52.1) shows a vermian midline posterior fossa tumour with hydrocephalus. At posterior craniotomy, as much tumour as possible was resected and the
hydrocephalus resolved without him needing a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. Histology
confirmed a medulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PNET), which is
the most common malignant brain tumour of childhood. Medulloblastomas frequently
spread through the leptomeninges and patients require cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
Treatment recognizes this risk and usually includes craniospinal irradiation. In recent
years prognosis has improved to 70–80 per cent with the introduction of additional
intensive systemic chemotherapy.

KEY POINTS

• Raised intracranial pressure in children frequently presents with non-specific
symptoms.

• Two-thirds of childhood brain tumours are located in the posterior fossa.

LYMPHADENOPATHY

History
Munira is a 7-year-old Asian girl who presents to the paediatric rapid referral clinic with
a lump on the side of her neck. Her mother noticed it a week earlier. It is not painful.
She has had no fevers, night sweats or weight loss. Her mother states that, about 4 weeks
ago, she had a cold that lasted for 2 days and was not accompanied by a temperature.
Munira had the BCG vaccine when she was a baby. There is no family history or history
of contact with TB. There has been no travel in the last 6 months.
Examination
Munira is apyrexial. There is a 4  3 cm lump on the left side of the neck. It is not erythematous, warm or tender. It is mobile and not attached to the skin. There are some
small (1 cm) lymph nodes on the right side of the neck. There is no lymphadenopathy
elsewhere and no hepatosplenomegaly. A BCG scar is seen. The ear, nose and throat
appear normal and there are no signs in the other systems. The child is investigated and
reviewed 48 hours later with the results.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis at presentation (prior to the investigation results)?
• Would you administer any treatment at the first visit?
• What is the most likely diagnosis following the investigation results?
• What course of action would you follow if there was no change in the size of the
lump after 10 days?

161

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 53
The lump is consistent with enlarged lymph nodes. The differential diagnosis is:

• infection – bacterial, viral or mycobacteria (tuberculosis and non-tuberculous
mycobacteria)

• malignancy – lymphoma or leukaemia.
Lymph nodes are often palpable in children. Cervical and axillary lymph nodes 1 cm in
diameter and inguinal lymph nodes 1.5 cm in diameter are considered to be enlarged.
Any enlargement in any other lymph nodes, e.g. supraclavicular, requires further investigation. All children get several upper respiratory tract infections a year, and the minor
cold several weeks earlier is probably irrelevant. Statistically, a bacterial cervical lymphadenitis is the most likely diagnosis. However, usually there is a clear history of a current or recent upper respiratory tract infection. In bacterial infections, the overlying skin
is usually erythematous and the lump is warm and tender. Occasionally the swelling may
become fluctuant and this is indicative of pus formation and an abscess. In such a case,
a referral should be made to a surgeon for incision and drainage. In viral infections,
the nodes are tender but are not usually warm or erythematous. The Paul–Bunnell test
is similar to the Monospot test and is a test for glandular fever. Viral serology for HIV,
cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis (which often produce more generalized lymphadenopathy) and cat scratch disease (due to Bartonella henselae) would be helpful if there was
still no diagnosis after the initial investigations.
In tuberculosis, the lump is cold and non-tender. Munira has had her BCG vaccination but
it is important to remember that, although this vaccination provides reasonable protection
against miliary TB and TB meningitis (50–80 per cent), it only provides 50 per cent protection for pulmonary TB and only minimal (if any) protection against non-tuberculous mycobacteria. A lymphoma can present with non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy. The lymph
nodes tend to be firmer than inflammatory nodes and may be adherent to the overlying
skin or underlying structures. The absence of systemic symptoms, such as fevers, night
sweats and weight loss, makes the diagnosis of tuberculosis and lymphoma less likely.
At the first visit, it would be worth giving a 10-day course of an antibiotic, e.g. coamoxiclav, that would treat streptococcal and staphylococcal infection. This would treat
the most likely diagnosis of a bacterial lymphadenitis.
The white blood cell count is normal and the CRP and ESR are only mildly elevated.
The ASOT, Paul–Bunnell test and Mantoux are negative. These results make an infection
unlikely and a malignancy the most likely diagnosis.
If there was no diminution in the size of the lump following the 10-day course of treatment (which would suggest that the diagnosis is not a bacterial lymphadenitis), the
patient should be referred to a surgeon for an urgent biopsy. This was the case with
Munira in whom the lymph node biopsy was diagnostic of Hodgkin’s lymphoma.
KEY POINTS

• Most children have some small palpable lymph nodes.
• The commonest cause of cervical lymphadenitis is streptococcal or staphylococcal
infection.

• Patients with lymphoma commonly present with non-tender firm cervical
lymphadenopathy.

CASE 54:

A SWOLLEN SHOULDER

History
Naomi is a 13-year-old girl who presents to the A&E department of her local hospital
for the third time in 8 weeks. On the first occasion she had slipped from her horse whilst
mounting and sustained some minor bruising mainly to the right arm, hip and leg. There
was no evidence of any serious bone injury. Over the course of the next 2 weeks she
developed worsening pain and immobility in her right shoulder. Examination from that
visit was recorded as showing a decreased range of movement but little else. Her symptoms were thought to be due to either a ‘frozen shoulder’ or to be functional, and she
was prescribed ibuprofen for pain and referred for routine physiotherapy. The physiotherapists have sent her back with increasing pain and now swelling.
Examination
Naomi is clearly in pain and is reluctant to move her right shoulder. There is a generalized, smooth, warm, firm swelling of the right shoulder with a decreased range of movement in all directions. There are some distended visible veins and the overlying skin is
shiny but not red. The remainder of the examination is normal.

INVESTIGATIONS
Naomi’s shoulder X-ray is shown in Figure 54.1.

Figure 54.1 Naomi’s
shoulder X-ray.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is the management?
163

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 54
The diagnosis is an osteosarcoma of the right humerus. There is no differential. This is a
malignant tumour that classically presents in adolescence and often comes to light after
a relatively minor injury. It is still not uncommon for there to be a delay in diagnosis
because it is rare and not considered in the differential diagnosis of limb and joint pain.
The characteristic features on the X-ray are:

• bone destruction
• gross swelling
• elevation of the periosteum with creation of Codman’s triangle (marked with an
arrow 䉴 on the X-ray)

• ‘sunray’ spicules of new bone visible in the muscle and subcutaneous tissues.
The first step is regular adequate pain relief. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents
may be adequate but it is highly likely that opioids will be needed. This is an aggressive
tumour with rapid expansion of the periosteum which is exquisitely painful.
Secondly, a senior paediatrician – preferably from the local ‘shared care’ oncology team –
should break the news to the girl and her family. They will be devastated and quite possibly angry at the perceived delay in diagnosis. The local team will have the experience
and knowledge to answer any immediate questions. They will also know that the best
route for onward referral is to a specialist paediatric oncology centre and not, at this
stage, to orthopaedics. Although a tissue diagnosis is required, she needs to be screened
for metastases as this may alter the management significantly. Osteosarcomas usually
spread to lung and bone and she will need a chest CT scan and a bone scan plus an
MRI scan of the shoulder to guide future surgery. The biopsy should only be taken in a
specialist centre (or with their explicit agreement) and reviewed by a team of specialist
histopathologists.
The specific management of osteosarcoma is initial chemotherapy to reduce tumour
bulk and to clear any metastases, followed by surgery followed by further chemotherapy. Definitive surgery is probably contraindicated if metastases have not cleared or
significantly reduced with initial chemotherapy, although some patients with isolated
lung secondaries do extremely well following their resection. Modern surgery is largely
successful at avoiding mutilating amputation using prostheses that can be externally
‘lengthened’ as the patient grows.
Prognosis depends upon the presence of metastatic spread at presentation – bone secondaries carry a particularly grave outlook – and on response to chemotherapy as
evidenced by tumour necrosis at surgical resection. More than 90 per cent necrosis is
associated with an improved outcome. Overall prognosis is a 5-year survival rate of
approximately 60 per cent.

KEY POINTS

• Children do not get ‘frozen shoulder’ and functional pain is a diagnosis of exclusion.
• Bone tumours are rare but should be considered in any patient with unexpectedly
severe symptoms following a minor injury.

• The care of children with cancer should be coordinated by a specialist centre.
• Centralization of care, entry into randomized controlled trials and the use of national
or international protocols have steadily improved the prognosis in childhood cancer.

FEVER IN A PATIENT ON CHEMOTHERAPY

History
The parents of 6-year-old Lucy, who has B-cell lymphoma, have brought her to the
children’s ward of their local hospital as they have recorded a temperature at home of
38.7C. They have since given her a dose of paracetamol. Lucy completed her second
course of chemotherapy 6 days previously. They know that her last blood count 2 days
ago showed that she was neutropenic (neutrophils 1.0  109/L). The whole family,
including the patient, have had symptoms of a viral illness with a sore throat, a runny
nose and a bit of a cough, but she has also had three bouts of diarrhoea in the preceding 24 hours and some lower abdominal pain. There are four other children at home,
ranging in age from 6 months to 9 years. The mother works part-time in the evenings
serving behind a bar, while the father is a self-employed painter and decorator. Their
daughter was very sick at presentation and spent 5 weeks in the regional paediatric
oncology centre 40 miles away. She has only been home since the end of the recent
course of chemotherapy.
Examination
Lucy is playing in a side-room with her dolls. She is reluctant to be examined. Her
temperature is 37.4C. Her pulse is 130 beats/min and her blood pressure 95/60 mmHg.
Oxygen saturation is 97 per cent in air. The indwelling central-line exit site is slightly
erythematous and tender. There are no murmurs and examination of the respiratory and
abdominal systems is unremarkable. Her ears, nose and throat are normal.

165

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 55
Once a child with cancer undergoing treatment is in remission, the commonest cause of
death is infection. Families have written instructions about temperature monitoring and
when to seek advice. All admitting hospitals have protocols for treatment based on the
degree of fever (e.g. 38.5C) and the neutrophil count (e.g. 0.75  109/L).

!

Contributing factors to infection in children with cancer

• Neutropenia – the more severe (0.5  109/L) and prolonged, the greater the risk.
•
•
•
•
•

There may be loss of the inflammatory response, e.g. insufficient white blood cells
to form an abscess
Mucositis – following radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Can affect the whole
gastrointestinal tract. There is a risk that intestinal bacteria will breach the gut
wall and enter the bloodstream
Indwelling central lines – crucial for giving chemotherapy and blood sampling,
but significant source of infection, both blood-borne and at exit site
Frequent hospital admissions
Poor nutrition
Generalized immunosuppression, inhibiting the usual host defences – viruses
that rarely cause severe illness in immunocompetent children can be lifethreatening in oncology patients, e.g. varicella, measles and cytomegalovirus.
Chemotherapy also predisposes children to ‘opportunistic infections’ – organisms
that only infect an immunocompromised host. Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis
carinii is included in protocols for cancers where the chemotherapy regimen is
particularly immunosuppressive

The reduction in temperature is irrelevant – the protocols are initiated on the recorded
temperature at home. That she is playing is also irrelevant – she has worrying symptoms and signs. Abdominal pain and diarrhoea suggest mucositis and she is tachycardic.
Although a visible source of sepsis is her central line site, this rarely causes significant
systemic features. Gram-negative sepsis is the real threat and she requires admission and
the immediate administration of intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics that include
cover for Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella), as well as
Gram-positive bacteria that may be causing a line infection.
Blood cultures and swabs (e.g. throat and line site) must be taken first and preferably urine and stool samples. However, collecting these should never delay antibiotics.
A chest X-ray is needed if there are respiratory symptoms or signs. Careful monitoring
and frequent re-evaluation are required, changing the regimen according to response
and culture results, e.g. coagulase-negative staphylococci frequently cause infections in
central lines. If Lucy is still febrile and significantly neutropenic after about 5 days,
antifungal agents may be added. Haemopoietic growth factors, e.g. granulocyte colonystimulating factor, are sometimes given. She will almost certainly need blood and/or
platelet transfusions. Again, protocols vary but an example would be a haemoglobin
7 g/dL and platelets 10  109/L or active bleeding.
Once afebrile and recovering, she can be discharged home where, if necessary, the parents or community nurses can continue antibiotics. Life for such families is inevitably

disrupted socially and financially – the main breadwinner here is self-employed. They
will be supported by specific staff and charities.

KEY POINTS

• Once in remission, infection is the commonest cause of death in children receiving
treatment for cancer.

• Febrile neutropenia in an immunocompromised child is a medical emergency.
• Common viral illnesses can kill immunocompromised children.

CASE 56:

ACHES AND PAINS

History
Hannah is a 5-year-old girl seen in the paediatric day unit at the request of the GP.
Hannah has been seen several times in the past few weeks with non-specific symptoms.
Initially she was just off-colour and lacking in energy, wanting to sit and watch television rather than play outside. She was complaining that her legs were aching and she
needed regular doses of paracetamol. The GP and her parents thought this might all be
related to her recently starting full-time school and her mother went in to talk to the
staff, worried about possible bullying. Hannah then had an ear infection with a high
temperature that was slow to respond to antibiotics and was therefore assumed to be
viral. Her admission has been precipitated this week because she has started to refuse
to walk, complaining that ‘she hurts all over’. The GP requested a full blood count (FBC)
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and has been phoned with the results below.
Examination
Hannah is quiet and pale. She is sitting on her mother’s knee and is reluctant to be
examined, crying when she is moved. Her temperature is 37.8C. She has widespread
lymphadenopathy, including supraclavicular. She is clinically anaemic but not jaundiced. She has bruises on her shins, left thigh and right upper arm. Her pulse is 96 beats/
min and heart sounds are normal, but she has a grade 2 systolic murmur located at the
left sternal edge. Her chest is clear. In the abdomen there is 4 cm hepatomegaly and her
spleen is palpable 2 cm below the left costal margin. Her left ear drum is dull and pink
but the right is normal, as is her throat. Although she resists movement of her joints,
there is no obvious swelling, deformity or overlying skin change.

• What factors are associated with a poor prognosis?

169

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 56
Hannah’s blood count shows pancytopenia, which is due to either bone marrow (BM)
infiltration or failure (see Case 48, A pale child, p. 143). She has the clinical symptoms
and signs of infiltration – the bone pain is due to marrow expansion. Children may not
localize the pain, and generalized non-specific symptoms culminating in a reluctance
to move and weight-bear are common. There may be bone tenderness. Hannah has evidence of extramedullary involvement with hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy.
Supraclavicular nodes are always suspicious. Bruises below the knees are very common
in children, but those at sites other than the shins may be pathological. The murmur is
almost certainly a flow murmur due to anaemia. The most likely diagnosis is acute leukaemia, probably lymphoblastic (ALL) because this accounts for 80 per cent of leukaemias in childhood.
Leukaemic ‘blast’ cells may not be observed on a routine peripheral blood film examination or may be misinterpreted. The peripheral FBC may even be normal, causing
diagnostic difficulty in differentiating it from conditions that present with similar features, e.g. infectious mononucleosis or rheumatoid arthritis. Analysis of a BM aspirate is
essential. This differentiates ALL from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and other malignant causes of BM infiltration, such as neuroblastoma. It also enables classification of
ALL using cell membrane markers and cytogenetic and molecular genetic features which
influence treatment decisions and prognosis.
Current treatment for ALL is in four phases:
1. Remission induction. Four weeks of combination chemotherapy. More than 95 per cent
show BM remission by day 28.
2. Consolidation and CNS protection. Oral chemotherapy is commenced. Cytotoxic drugs
penetrate poorly into the CNS. A course of weekly intrathecal (IT) drugs is given to
prevent later CNS relapse. IT drugs are also given during induction and throughout
maintenance.
3. Delayed intensification(s). Remission at day 28 is often only apparent. One or two
courses (depending on risk) of intense chemotherapy are dovetailed with blocks of
maintenance chemotherapy.
4. Continuing maintenance. Chemotherapy continues for a total of 2 years in girls and
3 years in boys. Patients are immunosuppressed and at risk of opportunistic infections. Co-trimoxazole is given to prevent Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.

173

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 57
A limp is a common problem in childhood. It is important to be aware that it can be due
to an abnormality anywhere from the back to the foot.
Causes of a limp in a child are best considered according to age:

• 0–3 years
– Trauma, e.g. fracture (may be accidental or non-accidental)
– Infection: septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis
– Malignancy
– Developmental dysplasia of the hip
– Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy
• 4–10 years
– Trauma
– Transient synovitis (irritable hip)
– Infection – septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis
– Perthe’s disease
– Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
– Malignancy, e.g. leukaemia
– Neuromuscular disease, e.g. cerebral palsy
• 10–18 years
– Trauma
– Infection: septic arthritis, osteomyelitis or discitis
– Slipped upper femoral epiphysis
– Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
– Malignancy, e.g. osteogenic sarcoma
The diagnosis is a slipped upper femoral epiphysis (SUFE). SUFE is commoner in boys
and in obese individuals. Pain can be felt in the groin, hip or thigh or there may be
referred pain in the knee. Classically the affected hip is flexed and the leg is externally
rotated. A small slip may be missed on the anteroposterior view and a lateral or frog leg
view of the hip is therefore also necessary. The lateral X-ray shows displacement of the
proximal femoral epiphysis relative to the femoral neck. Approximately 25 per cent of
patients will also have a contralateral slip and the other hip must therefore be carefully
assessed.
A minority of patients with SUFE have an underlying endocrinopathy or metabolic
abnormality (hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, growth hormone abnormalities, panhypopituitarism or renal osteodystrophy) and if this is suspected then the appropriate investigations should be performed. Janis is short and overweight and has a family history of
thyroid disease. A more detailed examination demonstrated that she had a small goitre.
Thyroid function tests revealed a free T4 of 9.2 pmol/L (12–22), a thyroid-stimulating
hormone (TSH) of 64 mU/L (0.5–6.0) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies of 1342 IU/
mL (0–34). These results are compatible with a diagnosis of Hashimoto’s (autoimmune)
thyroiditis. Obese individuals should have their fasting glucose measured and this test
should also be done on Janis.
Janis should be admitted and told not to weight-bear. She should be referred urgently
to the orthopaedic surgeons. Although it would seem that the SUFE has been present for
4 months, one can get an acute or chronic slip of the epiphysis that can lead to avascular
174

necrosis of the femoral head. Surgery is therefore urgent and consists of pinning the
femoral head to the femoral neck. Thyroxine should also be started.

KEY POINTS

• In SUFE, a lateral or frog leg view, as well as an anteroposterior view, of the hip is
necessary to avoid missing minor slips.

• Urgent treatment is necessary in SUFE to try to avoid the complication of avascular
necrosis of the femoral head

CASE 58:

PAIN AND FEVER

History
Kyle is a 16-month-old boy who presents to the paediatric day unit with a 2-day history
of intermittent inconsolable crying and fevers up to 40C. He has not been interested
in food and has vomited twice. There has been no diarrhoea. His parents report that he
seems to be in pain when his nappy is changed. He had a cut on his right foot 2 weeks
ago which has healed and there is no obvious history of trauma. Kyle was born at term
and has no other significant past medical history. Both parents are unemployed and he
has two older half-sisters, aged 5 and 3, with the same mother. He is on no regular medication and has no known allergies.
Examination
He looks unwell with a temperature of 38.7C. He dislikes handling and is clearly in pain.
His capillary refill time is 4 s and he is mildly dehydrated. His pulse is 135 beats/min
and his blood pressure is 75/50 mmHg. There is no skin rash. Examination of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems is unremarkable. His abdomen seems soft with no
obvious tenderness or organomegaly. Bowel sounds are normal. There is no meningism.
Examination of the ears, nose and throat is normal.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 58
This boy has signs of sepsis with fever, prolonged capillary refill time and tachycardia.
His investigations support this. The history of pain with movement is strongly suggestive of musculoskeletal pathology. In acute sepsis, the emphasis is usually on diagnosing meningitis or an acute abdomen and it is easy to overlook this system. Examine for
any swelling, redness of the skin, warmth and tenderness. There may be nothing to see
superficially, so observe the posture and whether the child is keeping any limb flexed or
still. Gently examine the range of movement of all joints.
The most likely diagnosis is osteomyelitis or septic arthritis. The legs are much the
commonest site and most infections are blood-borne. There is often a recent history of
minor trauma or a breach in the skin, which probably explains why boys are more often
affected. The commonest bacteria involved is Staphylococcus aureus.
Children with sickle cell disease have a higher incidence of skeletal infections. The differential depends on the site but includes soft-tissue infections and psoas abscess. In the
less obviously septic child, remember trauma, both accidental and non-accidental, and
bone infiltration with cancers such as leukaemia.

!

Possible imaging modalities

• Plain X-rays – excludes trauma. In osteomyelitis, bones are unlikely to be
•
•
•

abnormal until 10–14 days after onset. In arthritis they are often normal but may
show widening of joint space  local soft tissue or fat changes
Ultrasound (US) – highly sensitive in detecting joint effusion and guiding
aspiration. It may demonstrate swelling and distortion of soft tissues and
subperiosteal region
MRI – the best technique to differentiate between soft tissue and bone infection;
also to detect a joint effusion where US is normal. However, the boy will need
sedation or general anaesthetic at this age
Technetium (99mTc) bone scan – accumulates as ‘hot spots’ in areas of increased
bone turnover so useful in osteomyelitis, especially multifocal. Infection close
to growth plates can limit specificity

First, he needs fluid resuscitation and adequate pain relief. If the clinical diagnosis is osteomyelitis, he should start intravenous antibiotics, e.g. co-amoxiclav. However, if there is
evidence of septic arthritis, he should ideally have an immediate US and, if there is an effusion, an urgent arthrotomy before starting antibiotics. If there is no effusion, the diagnosis
is more likely to be osteomyelitis and antibiotics can be started. They should not be delayed
in order to establish a definitive diagnosis with imaging or cultures, because this increases
the risk of long-term effects on the growth and function of the affected limb, especially if
the growth plate is involved. The length of treatment and route of administration of antibiotics for both depend upon the clinical and biochemical (WCC, ESR, CRP) responses. A
total of 6 weeks is common practice. Long-term follow-up is necessary because problems
may not be apparent for several years. Most children make an uneventful recovery.
KEY POINTS

• Bone and/or joint sepsis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of all
children presenting with sepsis.

• Delay in treatment of osteomyelitis or septic arthritis can cause significant long-term
effects on the growth and function of the affected limb.

CASE 59:

SWOLLEN JOINTS

History
Zoe is a 3-year-old girl referred to children’s outpatients. For the past 7 weeks she has
been generally off-colour and miserable. Having loved nursery she is increasingly reluctant to get up in the morning and is taking ages to get dressed. She says she feels ‘stiff
all over’. As the day goes by, her stiffness improves unless she has been sitting for a
while, but she is still easily tired and lacks energy. When encouraged to walk, she does
so very slowly and wants to be carried or use the buggy. Zoe has also been complaining
that her knees and ankles hurt and her parents report intermittent but definite swelling
of her left knee and right ankle. Her symptoms are helped by ibuprofen. There are no
reports of injury. She had a sore throat 2 months ago but has not had any fevers since,
or any rashes. Zoe has no significant past medical or family history. She has a healthy
9-month-old brother.
Examination
Zoe is a quiet but generally healthy girl sitting on her mother’s knee. She would not
walk into the consulting room. Her height is on the 75th centile and her weight is on
the 50th. She is not clinically anaemic or clubbed and there is no lymphadenopathy.
She is afebrile. There are no rashes. Both knees and her right ankle are mildly swollen
and feel warm to touch, but there is no overlying skin change. The left knee seems most
affected. There is pain and a decreased range of movement. There are similar findings in
the proximal interphalangeal joint of the left index finger. The remainder of her joints,
including the hips, appear normal. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and
abdominal systems is normal with no hepatosplenomegaly.

179

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 59
Zoe has a polyarthritis – pain, swelling, warmth and restricted movement of several
joints. The much commoner arthralgia is joint pain without the other features.

!

Differential diagnosis of chronic polyarthritis

• Connective tissue disorder – juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), systemic lupus
erythematosus, dermatomyositis, psoriatic arthritis

• Infection – bacterial causes are unlikely with this chronic history. Viruses such as
hepatitis and also Lyme disease should be excluded

• Malignant disorders – children with leukaemia can have joint pain due to
•
•

metaphyseal marrow expansion months before peripheral blood count changes.
A bone marrow examination may be indicated
Inflammatory bowel disease – can present with arthritis
Vasculitis – Henoch–Schönlein purpura

Zoe has other features in the history that make JIA the most likely diagnosis. There
has been an insidious onset of early morning stiffness, ‘gelling’ (stiffness) after inactivity, slow walking and progressive joint involvement. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a
group of conditions in which there is a chronic arthritis lasting 6 consecutive weeks
before the age of 16 years. Infection and other causes must obviously be excluded. Her
sore throat 2 months earlier is probably incidental although a reactive arthritis following Streptococcus tonsillitis is well recognized and the anti-streptolysin O titre (ASOT)
should be assayed. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis is classified according to its onset as systemic, polyarticular ( four joints) or oligo(pauci)articular ( four joints).
Zoe has oligoarticular JIA, the commonest subtype, which typically affects the knees and
ankles and less often the elbows or a single finger joint in young children 6 years,
particularly girls. In systemic or polyarticular JIA, there is often laboratory evidence of
chronic inflammation with anaemia, thrombocytosis and an elevated ESR and C-reactive
protein, but in oligoarticular JIA these may be normal or only mildly abnormal. Patients
with oligoarticular JIA have an increased risk of one of the complications of JIA, chronic
anterior uveitis, and this is increased still further in girls who are ANA-positive. She
therefore needs formal ophthalmology screening and frequent regular review. The course
of the uveitis is independent of the joints.

!

Principles of management

• Pain control with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
• Physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and occupational therapy. Splints may help prevent
contractures and deformities

• Intra-articular depot corticosteroid injections to reduce swelling and deformity
• Disease-modifying drugs are needed if not controlled with NSAIDs, e.g.

•
•

180

methotrexate, sulphasalazine. Cytokine inhibitors (e.g. anti-tumour necrosis
factor) may be needed for refractory polyarticular or systemic JIA. All of these
need careful monitoring in a specialist setting
Regular monitoring of growth and nutrition as for any chronic disease
Multidisciplinary team approach, including psychosocial support. The impact
of all forms of JIA is significant, although the prognosis for oligoarthritis is
generally better than for other groups

Bones and joints
KEY POINTS

• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can only be diagnosed after 6 continuous weeks of
arthritis and after the exclusion of other causes.

• The management of JIA requires a multidisciplinary team with as much emphasis on
the therapies as on drug interventions.

CASE 60:

A SPINAL DEFORMITY

History
Melissa is a 12-year-old who presents to her GP with a persistent cough that has been
going on for 3 weeks. The whole family have had a flu-like illness but her symptoms
seem to have gone on for longer. Her cough is non-productive, she has not been short of
breath and she hasn’t complained of chest pain. She had a temperature early on but this
has resolved. There is no significant past medical history and she rarely attends the surgery. She has not yet started her periods. She takes no regular medication.
Examination
Melissa is a generally healthy girl who is not distressed at rest. She is pink in room air and
not clubbed. There is no significant lymphadenopathy. The GP examines her respiratory system and can find no abnormalities. However, he notices that she appears to have a lateral
curvature to the left of her thoracic spine. There are no neurocutaneous features.
Questions
• What is this deformity?
• What else should now be documented in the history and examination?
• What are the management options?

183

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 60
This patient has a abnormality in spinal alignment in the coronal plane – a scoliosis. The
spine has normal curves in the sagittal plane that provide stability and balance. The cervical and lumbar spines are convex anteriorly, termed lordosis. The thoracic and sacral
spines are convex posteriorly, termed kyphosis. These normal curves can be exaggerated,
e.g. in congenital deformities such as achondroplasia where there is almost always a significant lumbar lordosis.
Having found a scoliosis, the next question is whether it is postural (common) or structural (rare). A postural scoliosis may be caused by pain or be secondary to a leg-length
discrepancy and these conditions should be ruled out first. Leg-length discrepancy is
usually easily managed with a shoe raise. Provided both are absent, a postural scoliosis
will disappear when the child bends forwards to try to touch her toes and no further
intervention is required. In a structural scoliosis, the curvature persists in the forwardbending test and there is rotation of the vertebral bodies towards the convexity of the
curve, causing a ‘rib hump’. Most cases of structural scoliosis are idiopathic but some are
related to an underlying condition and these need exclusion.

!

Differential diagnosis of a structural scoliosis

• Idiopathic
• Neuromuscular, e.g. cerebral palsy or Duchenne muscular dystrophy
• Congenital structural abnormalities of the vertebrae, e.g. hemivertebrae – there
•

is a high risk of associated spinal cord defects, e.g. spinal dysraphism and other
congenital abnormalities, especially genitourinary
Syndromic, e.g. neurofibromatosis and Marfan syndrome

Therefore, children with a structural scoliosis need a thorough neurological evaluation
before concluding that the scoliosis is idiopathic.
Treatment assumes that a progressive scoliosis will cause unacceptable deformities, an
increased risk of early joint disease and cardiorespiratory compromise. In idiopathic
structural scoliosis, the risk of progression depends upon sex, age, pubertal status and the
degree of curvature. Premenarchal girls are at highest risk. All patients with, or at risk of,
structural scoliosis should be monitored regularly. Bracing and surgical correction are the
two treatment options. Surgery is recommended earlier in those with neuromuscular or
congenital scoliosis.

KEY POINTS

• Scoliosis is often picked up incidentally and most are postural.
• Patients found to have a structural scoliosis must have a thorough neurological
evaluation although most cases are idiopathic.

• A structural scoliosis in a premenarchal girl is the most likely to progress.

NEUROLOGY
CASE 61:

A FITTING CHILD

History
Tom is a 4-year-old child known to have epilepsy. He is admitted to the resuscitation
room in A&E with a fit. He was born at 26 weeks’ gestation and had a periventricular
haemorrhage which has led to moderate learning difficulties. He has had a runny nose,
a cough and a fever in the last few days. The coughing sometimes leads to vomiting and
his mother states that he has vomited up several of his drug doses in the last few days.
He is on sodium valproate and lamotrigine. He has had previous admissions with fits but
his mother says this is his longest fit. She has already administered buccal midazolam at
home with no effect. No one in the family has had cold sores in the past few weeks.
Examination
Tom is in the midst of having a generalized fit which started 35 min before he reached
hospital. His temperature is 40.2C, oxygen saturation is 90 per cent in air, respiratory rate
30/min, heart rate 180/min, blood pressure 105/77 mmHg and peripheral capillary refill 5 s.
He has a runny nose and an erythematous pharynx with enlarged but non-pustular tonsils. His chest is clear. He has no neck stiffness or rash. There are no other signs.
High-flow (15 L/min) 100 per cent facemask oxygen elevates the saturation to 97 per cent
and an intravenous injection of lorazepam terminates the fit after a further 5 min, following which Tom is postictal.

Questions
• What is the most likely cause of this child’s prolonged fit?
• Would you do a lumbar puncture (LP)?
• What further treatment is required?
185

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 61
The most likely cause is poorly controlled epilepsy. A fever (secondary to an upper
respiratory tract infection in this case) can decrease the threshold for a fit in a child
with epilepsy. The vomiting of medication would further increase the risk of a fit. There
would be no point doing drug levels in this case. The absence of neck stiffness and a
rash would go against meningitis. Encephalitis is rare. There is no history of recent herpetic cold sores in the family. Encephalitis is often accompanied by a focal fit or focal
neurological signs as well as a diminished conscious level and a fever. An LP should not
be performed because of the length of the fit.
Although this child’s fit is probably due to his epilepsy, the possibility of meningitis or
encephalitis cannot be totally ruled out. He has a very high temperature, poor peripheral
perfusion, has had his longest ever fit, has a raised white cell count with a neutrophilia
and a raised CRP. An LP would help diagnose meningitis and encephalitis and would identify the organism and its sensitivities. However, it should not be performed if there is a risk
of raised intracranial pressure, as it may lead to coning and death. A magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan may need to be performed to help rule
out raised intracranial pressure prior to an LP. Furthermore, an LP often does not alter the
initial management and can be done the next day if the patient is better, in order to elucidate the diagnosis and help determine the type and length of antimicrobial treatment.

Intravenous fluids, initially 0.9 per cent saline 20 ml/kg, should be administered to improve
perfusion and to help normalize the capillary refill time. Intravenous ceftriaxone, clarithromycin and aciclovir should be administered. Antipyretics should also be given. Clinical
progress and an LP when the patient is better will help determine the diagnosis and the
necessary treatment.
Measuring the blood glucose at the bedside is essential to rule out hypoglycaemia in fitting children. One should never give more than a total of two doses of benzodiazepines,
because of the risk of respiratory depression. Status epilepticus is one of the commonest
paediatric emergencies and it is important to be familiar with its treatment.
KEY POINTS

• A glucose level should always be measured in a fitting child.
• A lumbar puncture should not be performed if there is concern about raised
intracranial pressure, e.g. papilloedema or coma.

A FEBRILE, DROWSY CHILD

History
Alison is a 9-year-old girl who is referred to the A&E department by her GP. She was
seen in surgery a few days ago with a temperature and a widespread non-specific rash,
and a diagnosis of a probable viral infection was made. Her temperature has persisted
although the rash is fading. Today she has been complaining of worsening headache,
dislike of light and pain in her neck, back and legs. Her mother has found it difficult to
wake her and she has been a bit confused. She has vomited twice and, most unusually,
wet the bed. She has no significant past medical history and is taking no regular medication. She is fully immunized. Her mother has recurrent cold sores, the last about 2 weeks
ago. Nobody in the family is unwell or taking medications. Her school progress is good.
Examination
Alison is lying in bed in a darkened room with her eyes closed. She is reluctant to be
examined and wants to go back to sleep. Her temperature is 39.7C. She has a fading
macular rash over her trunk, back, arms and legs. Her pulse is 130 beats/min. Her BP is
85/60 mmHg and the capillary refill time 2 s. There are no murmurs. She has moderate neck stiffness. She is difficult to wake but when she does she recognizes her parents

Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What would be your immediate management of this patient?
• What further investigations would you request and when?

187

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 62
The most likely diagnosis is a viral meningoencephalitis. Typically there is a prodrome of
a non-specific febrile illness, possibly accompanied by a rash, followed by the onset of
a progressive headache and photophobia. Any virus can be responsible, but at least 80
per cent of cases are caused by enteroviruses. Of the other infectious agents mimicking
viral meningoencephalitis, by far the most important are bacteria, because they require
prompt treatment with antibiotics. The other major differential is a brain abscess.
Remember the maxim ‘treat the treatable’. Pending culture results, the assumption has
to be that a bacterial cause is possible even when, as in this case, the blood tests are not
supportive. A broad-spectrum antibiotic such as cefotaxime should be started immediately following blood cultures. Most causes of viral meningoencephalitis have no specific treatment and the management is supportive. However, herpes simplex virus type 1
(HSV-1) is an important cause (note her mother’s cold sores) and without treatment 70
per cent progress to coma and death. Brain involvement is focal and patients frequently
present with focal seizures. All patients with meningoencephalitis should therefore be
started on aciclovir. Mycoplasma pneumoniae can also cause meningoencephalitis and
Alison should also be treated with a macrolide antibiotic such as clarithromycin.
An EEG is valuable in supporting the diagnosis. Typically it shows slow-wave activity without focal features, except in HSV-1 infection where there may be evidence of
temporal lobe involvement. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan may show brain swelling and is mandatory if there are focal signs. It
will also exclude a brain abscess. At some stage a lumbar puncture (LP) will be necessary but it is currently contraindicated because this girl is drowsy and disorientated, is
likely to have raised intracranial pressure and could cone if an LP is performed. There
is no urgency because she is already receiving the appropriate treatment. Cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) analysis should help differentiate between the various potential diagnoses
(see Table 62.1).

CASE 63:

A BIG HEAD

History
Sami, a 9-month-old boy, has been referred to the community paediatric clinic by his
health visitor because his head circumference is on the 99.6th centile. He was born at 38
weeks’ gestation by spontaneous vaginal delivery, following an uneventful pregnancy to
a Samoan woman. His birth weight was 4.3 kg (91st centile) and his head circumference
at birth was 38 cm (98th centile). This is the mother’s third baby, but the other two children have a different father. Sami doesn’t sleep very well, waking up to three times per
night, and this was the main reason his mother went to see her health visitor. Sami is
otherwise well and has not had any previous medical problems. He has been able to sit
unsupported for the last 2 months, he crawls, he can use either hand to pick up raisins
or grains of rice. His mother has no concerns about his vision or hearing and he passed
his newborn hearing screen. He is still breast-feeding but also eats purées and finger
foods. The mother, her partner and the three children live in a two-bedroom flat. The
growth chart in his parent-held child health record is shown in Figure 63.1.

Figure 63.1 Sami’s growth chart (reproduced with permission of the Child Growth Foundation).

190

Neurology

Examination
Sami is a well-looking child, who smiles and babbles continuously. He is not dysmorphic. His weight is 10.5 kg (91st centile), his length is 76.2 cm (98th centile) and his head
circumference is 49.7 cm (99.6th centile). Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations
are normal. His anterior fontanelle is almost closed. Neurological examination reveals
normal tone, power and reflexes in the upper and lower limbs.
Questions
• What features in the history help to distinguish between the causes of a big head?
• What other features should be sought on examination?
• What is the most likely explanation for the large head circumference?

191

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 63
A large head may be a normal variant, often with a familial tendency, or may be caused
by pathological processes. In an infant, rising intracranial pressure will cause the skull
with unfused sutures to expand rapidly. If possible, it should be determined from previous measurements whether the head circumference is enlarging and crossing centiles
(a worrying feature) or whether it is just growing steadily along the same centile. There
may be other symptoms of raised intracranial pressure: vomiting, lethargy, irritability,
poor feeding. Developmental delay or regression (loss of previously attained developmental milestones) suggests metabolic, genetic and syndromic causes. Social concerns
about a family raise the possibility of a subdural haematoma from non-accidental injury.
Parents should be asked whether they or the siblings have large heads – do they have
difficulty buying hats to fit them?
The causes of a large head (macrocephaly) are listed below. When performing the examination, these should be borne in mind. The shape of the head, and the size, shape and
patency of the fontanelles and cranial sutures should be assessed. The presence of dysmorphic features, birthmarks or other congenital anomalies should be sought. Central
and peripheral nervous systems should be examined and development assessed. Weight
and height should be measured and plotted on a centile chart, as should parental head
circumferences.

Sami has normal development and his growth chart shows that he has always been a
large baby with a large head. The change from the 98th centile to 99.6th centile is not
concerning, considering the slow rate of change and the likelihood of small errors in
measurement. The cause of his large head size is likely to be familial and this was supported by his mother’s head circumference lying on the 98th centile.

KEY POINTS

• The commonest cause of a large head is familial macrocephaly.
• Check the growth chart and developmental history for a child with a big head.

A CHILD IN A COMA

History
Kyle is a 7-month-old boy who presents to the A&E department of a district general
hospital in a coma. He has been somewhat lethargic in the last few days, has vomited
several times and has gradually got worse. His parents could not rouse him and brought
him straight to A&E. There is no past medical history of note and no diseases run in the
family.
Examination
His airway and breathing are stable. Oxygen saturation is 96 per cent in air. His pulse is
176 beats/min, his blood pressure is 82/56 mmHg and the capillary refill is 5 s. The AVPU
score is P. He is apyrexial and has no rash. The anterior fontanelle is bulging with distended veins over the scalp. There are no focal neurological signs and no other signs.

Differential diagnosis of coma in children

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, e.g. following a respiratory arrest
Epileptic seizure/postictal state
Trauma, e.g. intracranial haemorrhage, cerebral oedema
Infections, e.g. meningitis, encephalitis, abscess
Metabolic – renal and hepatic failure, hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis,
inborn errors
Poisoning
Vascular lesions, e.g. stroke

The AVPU score is a score used for the rapid assessment of the conscious level of a child
(especially 5 years of age). A  Alert, V  responds to Voice, P  responds only to
Pain, U  Unresponsive to all stimuli. P or less corresponds to a GCS of 8 or less.
The CT shows an acute subdural haemorrhage over the right hemisphere.
The most likely mechanism is a shaking injury (the ‘shaken baby syndrome’) or possibly
a direct impact.
The pulse is raised and the capillary refill time is prolonged. This would fit in with an
intracranial bleed and vomiting (note the haemoglobin is low and the lactate and base
excess are raised due to poor perfusion). A bolus of 20 mL/kg of 0.9 per cent saline
should therefore be administered. In any child with an AVPU score of P or U, the airway
is at risk and an anaesthetist should therefore be called.
A broad-spectrum antibiotic, e.g. cefotaxime, should be given as soon as possible to
cover the possibility of sepsis.
The bulging anterior fontanelle indicates raised intracranial pressure. In infants, unfused
sutures and a patent anterior fontanelle allow the cranial volume to increase. Raised intracranial pressure is therefore better tolerated in its initial stages and large bleeds may occur
before neurological features develop. Management of raised intracranial pressure includes
sitting the infant at a 30º angle, restricting fluids to two-thirds maintenance, and elective
intubation and ventilation to maintain the PCO2 at 4–4.5 kPa (intubation will also secure the
airway and help ensure a safe transfer). The child should also be well oxygenated and normoglycaemic. An urgent discussion needs to be held with the regional neurosurgical centre
to discuss whether the infant should be administered mannitol or hypertonic saline to help
decrease the intracranial pressure. Arrangements will need to be made for an urgent neurosurgical assessment to determine whether surgery is required to evacuate the haematoma.
This injury is most likely to have been intentional. Social services should therefore be
contacted and child protection procedures followed.
KEY POINTS

• Urgent transfer of acutely ill children with an intracranial bleed to a neurosurgical
unit is mandatory, as a haematoma may need to be surgically evacuated.

• The majority of serious intracranial injuries in the first year of life are the result of
non-accidental injury.

CASE 65:

A LATE WALKER

History
Justin is an 18-month-old boy referred to the community paediatric clinic because he is
not yet walking. He is the first child of white British parents, born at 41 weeks’ gestation
following an uneventful pregnancy. There was meconium staining of the amniotic fluid
but he cried immediately at birth and didn’t need any resuscitation. He has been generally healthy apart from normal coughs and colds, and he had chickenpox 6 months ago.
His parents recall that he could roll over at about 4 months, sat up alone at 10 months,
crawled from 13 months and was able to ‘bear walk’ on hands and feet and pull himself
to standing from around 17 months. He can take a few steps holding on to furniture but
cannot walk independently yet. He is able to scribble with a crayon with either hand
and can slot pieces into a shape-sorter toy. He uses lots of single words appropriately,
understands simple instructions, feeds himself with a spoon and will also feed his teddy
bear. The parents have no concerns about his vision or hearing. He attends nursery 3 days
per week and is described by the nursery staff as a likeable boy, although they have been
concerned that he still doesn’t walk. There is no family history of delayed walking. Justin’s
mother is an accountant and his father is an architect and both are in their early 40 s.
They are hoping to have another child soon.
Examination
Justin looks well and enjoys interacting with you. He is not dysmorphic. His weight is
10.8 kg (25th centile), height is 80 cm (25th centile) and head circumference is 49 cm (50th
centile). Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations are normal. His spine
and joints appear normal, and there are no unusual birthmarks. Neurological examination
shows normal cranial nerves and normal posture, tone, power and reflexes in the upper
and lower limbs. He does not have any tremor. When he is helped to stand, holding on to
the side of a low table, Justin takes a few steps whilst holding on with both hands.
Questions
• What comments can you make about Justin’s developmental history?
• What further assessment is necessary?
• What is the most important investigation to perform?
• What are the most common causes of delayed walking?

197

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 65
Justin’s gross motor development is delayed. Although he rolled at the normal age,
he was slightly late to sit independently and crawl. The average age for walking is 13
months (range 9–18 months) and failure to walk by 18 months is a developmental warning sign. The rest of his development seems appropriate for his current age, although
there is little detail given. Further assessment of his development in fine motor, speech,
language, communication and social domains will reveal whether he has isolated delay
in walking or he has other areas of delay too.
The most important investigation is a blood test for creatine kinase (CK) measurement.
This is because boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) will have a very elevated
CK and the diagnosis would be strongly suspected if this were found. As Justin’s parents are planning to have another child, they could have appropriate genetic counselling
about the risk of another child being affected. DMD is an X-linked recessive condition
affecting about 1:4000 births and it usually results in progressive muscle weakness, loss
of ambulation and death in the teens or early 20s. Many children with DMD will also
have a degree of learning difficulty and may exhibit delay in other areas of development.
Delayed walking is a common problem. Ninety-seven per cent of normal children will be
walking by 18 months of age, which means 3 per cent will not. Most children not walking
by 18 months will be normal, but up to 10 per cent will have an underlying neurological
problem and 10 per cent will have developmental delay in other areas. Less than 1 per cent
will turn out to have muscular dystrophy.

CASE 66:

A CHILD WITH LEARNING DIFFICULTIES

History
Simon is 7 years old. He has been brought to the community paediatric clinic at the local
children’s centre by his mother and grandmother. He was referred for a medical assessment
to help prepare a statement of special educational needs. His notes indicate that he has been
seen previously at the children’s centre by speech and language therapists due to speech
delay, and by the occupational therapist because he was very clumsy. The correspondence
indicates that a lot of appointments were missed and eventually he was lost to followup. He is the second child of non-consanguineous parents. He attends the same mainstream school as his 9-year-old brother, who has no problems at school. His father works
as a delivery driver but his mother does not work. Simon was born at term and has longstanding problems with eczema and constipation. He was admitted to hospital once after
scalding himself with boiling water from a kettle. He is reported to be fully immunized,
although his Red Book has been lost. His mother has difficulty recalling his developmental
milestones, but thinks that he walked at about 20 months and spoke his first word at about
30 months. He managed to potty-train at about 4.5 years, although he still soils himself
occasionally. He used to be a contented child who would sit quietly for long periods, but
his behaviour became increasingly aggressive when he started school. His mother thinks his
eyesight is fine and his hearing is fine when he wants to listen. His mother and grandmother
think that, overall, he is a slow learner, but they aren’t particularly worried about him.
Examination
Simon appears quite slight for his age, his height is 115 cm (ninth centile) and his weight
is 18 kg (second centile). He has quite a long, thin face and large ears but otherwise looks
similar to his mother. He sits quietly beside his mother through most of the consultation.
He speaks very little voluntarily and generally answers questions with a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’.
Cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal examinations are normal. Neurological examination reveals normal tone, power and reflexes in the upper and lower limbs. He has
rather flat feet, and his knees hyperextend when standing still. His gait is normal, but he
cannot stand on one leg for more than a few seconds and he seems quite clumsy when
running. His eye movements and facial movements appear normal. He will not tolerate
fundoscopy and is generally uncooperative with further cranial nerve assessment.
Questions
• What is a statement of educational needs?
• What further assessment is important?
• What causes should be considered for Simon’s problems?

199

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 66
If a child’s school cannot provide all of their needs, the local authority may carry out
an assessment to find out what the child’s special educational needs (SEN) are and how
they can be supported. The findings are documented in a statement of SEN (usually just
called a ‘statement’). This describes the child’s SEN and the assistance he or she requires.
The process requires assessments by the child’s school, an educational psychologist, a
doctor and other relevant professionals.
The medical assessment should identify any features that may indicate specific underlying diagnoses, look for any treatable contributing factors and describe the child’s current level of function and medical needs. It is essential to check hearing and vision.
The history suggests Simon may have developmental delay in multiple areas and he
probably has global learning disability. He may have ligamentous laxity, with associated
dyspraxia. He has chronic eczema and constipation, which may affect his ability to participate fully at school. His behavioural problems may be secondary to his learning difficulties and frustration at school, or may be an independent problem. Fragile X syndrome and
Duchenne muscular dystrophy need to be considered as underlying diagnoses, but much
more assessment is also needed.

SUDDEN WEAKNESS

History
Leroy is a 2.5-year-old West Indian boy brought to the A&E department by ambulance.
He was in the children’s playground at the park apparently fit and well. He suddenly
fell over whilst running to his mother and when he tried to get up, his right arm and
leg were not moving and he was unable to speak. His speech has returned a little but
is still far from normal and he is still not using his right side. He recognizes his parents
but is a little drowsy. He is visibly upset. Nothing like this has ever happened before
and his development to date has been normal. He is right-handed. Leroy was born at
term following an uneventful pregnancy to healthy, unrelated parents. Apart from an
orchidopexy at 13 months, he has no significant past medical history. He is on no regular medication and has no known allergies. He has two older sisters.
Examination
Leroy is a generally healthy Afro-Caribbean boy. His airway is patent and he is breathing without support. His oxygen saturation is 100 per cent in 15 L of oxygen via face
mask. His pulse is 92 beats/min and regular with a capillary refill time of 2 s. His blood
pressure is 80/54 mmHg. His temperature is 37C. Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. He is quite sleepy but knows his parents and
responds appropriately to attempts to examine him. He has drooping of the right side
of his mouth but his right eye closes when he cries. He will reach out with his left hand
to his favourite toy when it is held to his left but ignores it if it is introduced from his
right-hand side until it is almost in the midline. Tone, power, sensation and reflexes
are normal on his left side. He has increased tone in his right arm and leg but power is
weak. Reflexes are brisk throughout his right side. His plantar is flexor on the left but
extensor on the right.
Questions
• What is the clinical diagnosis?
• List the possible causes
• What important and relevant screening test would he have had as a neonate?
• What investigation does he need?
• What are the key points in the acute and long-term management?

201

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 67
Leroy has an acute right hemiplegia and hemianopia. He has an upper motor neurone
VIIth nerve palsy as evidenced by eye closure despite weakness of the facial muscles.
The clinical diagnosis is an acute stroke. Most childhood strokes are due to arterial
occlusion (thrombotic or embolic), but venous thrombosis and haemorrhage do occur.
The commonest cause of childhood stroke is sickle cell disease (SCD), affecting at least
10 per cent of such children. Many children with stroke have another medical condition.

!

Causes of acute stroke in childhood

• Haematological abnormalities – SCD, polycythaemia, leukaemia, disorders of
coagulation

• Cardiac disease – congenital, especially cyanotic and acquired, e.g. endocarditis
or Kawasaki disease. Usually embolic

• Infection – meningitis, local head and neck infections or bacteraemia
• Intracerebral vascular pathology – ruptured aneurysm, arteriovenous
malformation

• Autoimmune disease – systemic lupus erythematosus, juvenile idiopathic
arthritis, sarcoidosis

• Metabolic disease – homocystinuria, mitochondrial disorders
• Trauma

Sickle cell disease is now part of the neonatal screening programme. Previously all children from populations with a high incidence would be checked prior to any procedure
that could precipitate a sickling crisis, such as surgery.
In acute stroke it is crucial to distinguish between ischaemic and other categories
because this alters the investigations and management. A brain MRI should be undertaken as soon as possible, but if it is not available within 48 hours, a CT scan is an
acceptable initial alternative. Scanning should be undertaken urgently if there is a
depressed level of consciousness at presentation or a deterioration.
Further investigations will depend on the scan findings. For example, all children with
arterial ischaemic stroke should have MRI angiography of the cervical and proximal
intracranial arterial vasculature and cardiac echocardiography. They should also be
investigated for an underlying prothrombotic tendency, such as protein C deficiency, as
should those with venous thrombosis. A platelet count and clotting studies are needed in
intracerebral haemorrhage.
The acute medical management aims to minimize future disability. He needs regular
neurological observations and monitoring of his vital signs with urgent scanning and
admission to the paediatric intensive care unit if there is deterioration. If an arterial
ischaemic stroke is confirmed and haemorrhage and SCD are excluded, aspirin is started.
Anticoagulation should be considered in specific circumstances, such as cerebral venous
sinus thrombosis.

202

Neurology

The long-term management of stroke is a prime example of the benefits of a systematic, multidisciplinary approach to assess and monitor the medical, social, emotional and
educational needs of the child. All children should have an assessment within 72 hours
of admission and the professionals involved should have early liaison with their counterparts in the community to ensure smooth transition of care. A key worker from one
of the teams should coordinate the package of care and act as a central point of contact
for the family.

KEY POINTS

• MRI (or CT) scanning should be performed within 48 hours where there is a clinical
diagnosis of childhood stroke.

• At least 10 per cent of patients with sickle cell disease will have a stroke during
childhood.

• The management of childhood stroke should be multidisciplinary.

CHRONIC HEADACHES

History
Tom is a 10-year-old boy referred to outpatients by his GP with a 2-year history of
recurrent headaches. He describes the pain as being of gradual onset, frontal, right-sided
and throbbing. He has not noticed any visual symptoms. He takes paracetamol but it is
of limited value. The headache is often preceded or accompanied by nausea and vomiting. His mother has noticed that he becomes very pale and quiet. He takes himself off
to bed and sleeps for several hours after which he is fine. The episodes can last up to
12 hours. In between episodes Tom is fit and well. He is happy at school and doing well
but missed 10 days last term due to headaches. He takes part in numerous after-school
activities and loves performing arts, especially dance. He was admitted with a minor
head injury at the age of 7 having fallen off his bike. There is no other significant past
medical history and he takes no regular medication. His mother suffered with migraine
as a teenager.
Examination
Tom is a healthy, well-grown boy. His height and weight are both on the 75th centiles.
His pulse is 68 beats/min and regular and his blood pressure 96/58 mmHg. Examination
of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. His cranial nerves
are intact and fundoscopy is unremarkable. His peripheral nervous system is normal.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What investigations would you request?
• Is there any treatment that would reduce the frequency of these episodes?

205

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 68
These are the characteristic features of common migraine – recurrent headache with
symptom-free intervals, often unilateral, typically throbbing and accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Abdominal pain is often a feature. This is the commonest form of
migraine in childhood and over 90 per cent have a family history. The diagnosis should
be reconsidered if this is absent. Classic migraine has aura as an additional feature.
Auras are usually visual and include small areas of visual loss in a visual field (scotoma)
and brilliant white zigzag lines (fortification spectra).
Headaches are common in children and their frequency increases with age. In young
children, certainly pre-school, an organic cause is highly likely.

!

Differential diagnosis of chronic headaches

• Tension headaches – commonest of all, described as a ‘band’ or 'pressure’ and
•
•
•

•
•

bilateral. Usually otherwise asymptomatic. May last weeks and tend to worsen
as day progresses. Child is otherwise healthy
Sinusitis – percussing over affected sinuses causes pain and discomfort
Refractive errors – ensure vision has been checked recently
Raised intracranial pressure – a brain tumour is most parents’ underlying worry.
Unlike migraine and tension headaches, pain is worse when lying down. It
is almost always accompanied by other abnormal symptoms, e.g. change in
behaviour, or neurological signs, e.g. papilloedema
Solvent or drug abuse
Hypertension – blood pressure must be checked

A thorough history and examination are the mainstays in making a diagnosis in a child of
this age and he probably needs no investigations. Obviously if there are focal neurological
symptoms or signs (apart from visual aura), an MRI should be performed. Most children
can lie still enough for this from about 7–8 years. Otherwise, sedation or a general anaesthetic is needed. The younger the child, the lower the threshold for scanning because an
organic cause is more likely and they are poor at communicating the characteristics of
their headache. His previous head injury is irrelevant and not an indication to scan.
Prevention of migraine should focus on lifestyle changes. Reassurance that there is
no serious intracranial pathology is often enough to improve symptoms. Keeping a
diary is a simple way to try to identify any trigger factors, including, rarely, a specific food. Blanket exclusion diets should be avoided. Stress, tiredness and anxiety are
the commonest precipitants. Problems at school, including bullying, should be explored.
Relaxation and biofeedback techniques may help. Finally, if all else fails, school attendance is affected and the migraines are unacceptably intrusive, prevention with drugs
may be considered. There are very few well-designed clinical trials, but drugs such as
propranolol (contraindicated in asthma), pizotifen and some of the newer anticonvulsants (gabapentin or topiramate) may be effective. All have side-effects.
KEY POINTS

• Headaches in young children are more likely to be organic in origin and there is a
lower threshold for scanning.

• Lifestyle changes, not drugs, should be the focus for the prevention of migraine.
206

CASE 69:

A FUNNY SMILE

History
Oliver is a 7-year-old boy who presents to a paediatric rapid referral clinic with ‘a lopsided face’. His mother noticed that he was drooling from the left side of his mouth for
2 days and his left eyelid has been droopy. When he smiles, his face becomes very asymmetric. He is otherwise well but the drooling has made eating and drinking difficult and
a little embarrassing. His left eye also feels dry. The rest of the family are well but you
notice that his mother is recovering from a cold sore. There is no history of travel or of
any bites. He had an appendicectomy last year and had pyloric stenosis operated on in
infancy.
Examination
The child’s mouth droops on the left side. His smile, in particular, is asymmetric. It is
well delineated with the normal facial creases on the right side of the face, but on the
left side it is poorly formed and weak. He is also unable to shut his left eye. There are
no other cranial nerve abnormalities and the neurological system is otherwise normal.
Otoscopy is normal and his blood pressure is 107/67 mmHg. There are no other signs.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What is the treatment?
• What is the prognosis?

207

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 69
The most likely diagnosis is a left-sided Bell’s palsy. This is a lower motor neurone palsy
of the facial nerve. In lower motor neurone palsies, the whole side of the face is weak.
Taste on the anterior two-thirds of the tongue on the involved side is lost in about half
of cases and there may be facial numbness. In upper motor neurone facial nerve palsies,
there is preserved forehead power and eye closure. The facial palsy is said to occur due
to oedema of the facial nerve as it crosses the facial canal in the temporal bone. It may
occur 2 weeks after a viral infection. Herpes simplex and varicella zoster are said to be
causative. Epstein–Barr virus, Lyme disease and mumps have also been implicated.
In chronic cases, other causes, such as otitis media, hypertension, tumours (facial nerve
or brain stem tumours), leukaemia and trauma, should also be considered.
If the facial palsy is thought to be due to an upper motor neurone facial palsy then cranial imaging with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan should be undertaken.
If the child presents within 1 week then steroid treatment with prednisolone 1 mg/kg
once daily (up to 60 mg/day) for 7 days is effective. Treatment with other agents such as
aciclovir is controversial. Some paediatricians would only administer it if there is a clear
history of contact with herpes, as in our case, or varicella. Eye care is important. As it
may not be possible for the child to close his eye, treatment with artificial tears such as
hypromellose eye drops and taping of the eye at night may be necessary to prevent an
exposure keratitis.
Most patients recover within a few weeks. Eighty-five per cent make a complete recovery, 10 per cent are left with mild facial weakness and 5 per cent are left with permanent
significant facial weakness. Recovery may take up to 6 months.

KEY POINTS

• A lower motor neurone facial palsy affects the forehead and eye as well as the lower
part of the face.

• The commonest cause is a Bell’s palsy.
• Treatment with steroids within 1 week of diagnosis is beneficial.

CASE 70:

WEAK LEGS

History
Archie is an 18-month-old boy who is referred by his GP to the paediatric day unit
with a 1-week history of reduced mobility, worse in the previous 24 hours. His parents
assumed he had had a minor injury at nursery because he has also been complaining
that his back is sore, although there have been no witnessed events. The GP initially
wondered about a reactive arthropathy affecting his hips because Archie also has a cold,
but has sent him in because of the deterioration. Looking back, his parents think he has
been a bit unsteady for a couple of months but this has been attributed to an ear infection. Archie walked confidently from 11 months and the rest of his development is normal. There is no significant past medical history or family history.
Examination
Archie is a generally healthy boy but is in some discomfort. Observing him in the playroom he needs propping up to sit and keeps his back very still and straight when he
tries to move or reach for objects. There is very little spontaneous movement in either
leg, worse with the left than the right, and he cannot weight-bear, crawl or pull himself
to stand. He is reluctant to be examined but his cranial nerves and arms appear normal.
Passive movement of his legs is normal, with a full range of movement in his joints.
However, tone and power are reduced in both legs and reflexes are absent on the left
and reduced on the right. There is no back tenderness. Examination of his cardiovascular and respiratory systems is normal. In his abdomen, there is a smooth, non-tender
mass in the suprapubic region that appears to be arising out of the pelvis. It is dull to
percussion.

ANSWER 70
Unlike adults, in whom back pain is frequently mechanical or psychological in origin,
back pain in children, especially pre-adolescent, is almost always pathological. It can be
difficult for children to localize pain and careful observation is crucial – children with
back pain tend to maintain a straight, stiff back and refuse to bend forward to pick up
objects from the floor.

Traumatic – vertebral stress fractures, muscle spasm due to overuse, e.g. in
athletes and gymnasts, prolapsed intervertebral disc
Neoplastic – primary benign or malignant vertebral or spinal cord tumours,
leukaemias or lymphomas, metastases, e.g. neuroblastoma
Infection – discitis (common before 6 years), vertebral osteomyelitis
Rheumatological – pauciarticular juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis

Of these, only a prolapsed disc and tumours are associated with neurological abnormalities and the former is very rare, especially in young children. Hence a neoplastic
cause is much the most likely. Archie has a flaccid paralysis of both legs with reduced
or absent reflexes. The abdominal mass is probably his bladder which is neuropathic.
No mention is made of any history of sphincter problems, but as he will still be in nappies this is difficult to assess. Parents may notice a reduction in the urinary stream in
boys. His anus should be inspected and may be patulous. The parents should be asked
about the presence of constipation. Detecting a sensory level at this age is extremely
difficult.
The pointers to serious pathology in children with back pain include:

•
•
•
•
•

persistent or worsening pain
systemic features such as fever, malaise or weight loss
neurological symptoms or signs
sphincter dysfunction
young age – especially 4 years when a tumour is most likely.

This is a medical emergency. If Archie is not to have permanent loss of sphincter control and irreversible damage to his legs, he needs urgent investigation and intervention
to reduce cord compression. MRI is the investigation of choice and no time should be
lost – hours can make a difference (see Fig. 70.1). He should be referred immediately to
a paediatric neurosurgery centre. Spinal cord tumours are classified according to their
anatomical location: intramedullary (within the cord), extramedullary intradural (usually
benign) and extramedullary extradural (usually metastases). Further treatment and prognosis will depend upon the findings.
This boy was found to have a diffuse intramedullary spinal tumour from T7 to T12.

Neurology

Figure 70.1 Sagittal MRI scan of Archie’s spine.

He underwent limited debulking. Histology showed a low-grade pilocytic astrocytoma.
Although these are slow-growing indolent tumours, it is their critical location that governs morbidity and mortality. The surgical options are limited and radiotherapy likewise.
Trials of chemotherapy are in progress.

KEY POINTS

• Back pain in children should be assumed to be organic until proven otherwise.
• To minimize irreversible damage, back pain in association with neurological
abnormalities is an indication for urgent MRI scanning and referral to neurosurgery.

• Location is a key predictor of outcome in brain and spinal cord tumours.

CASE 71:

DEVELOPMENTAL REGRESSION

History
Theo is a 7-month-old boy who is seen as an urgent referral in the paediatric clinic. His
parents have been concerned that he has stopped interacting with them as he used to,
and that he has started to have unusual repetitive movements. He was born at term by
elective Caesarean section, and he had no problems in the neonatal period. His parents
are not consanguineous. He smiled at 5 weeks of age and by about 4 months he could
support his head well when held in a sitting position, was making lots of sounds, was
interested in everything around him and was reaching to touch objects. Over the last
month, he has almost stopped vocalizing, seems much less interested in his surroundings
and no longer seems to be as able to support his head. About 3 weeks ago he started
having clusters of jerking movements, which his parents initially thought were ‘startle
responses’. The movements are symmetrical and cause his arms to move in front of his
body and his neck to flex.
Examination
Theo is well grown for his age, with a weight of 9 kg (75th centile), length 72 cm (75th
centile) and head circumference 45 cm (50th centile). Cardiovascular, respiratory and
abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Cranial and peripheral nervous system
examination is normal. There are five patches of pale pigmentation on the skin of his
abdomen. He is able to fix on a light source and will follow it briefly but he shows
little interest in faces or interacting with toys. When placed in a sitting position, his
head drops forward after a few seconds, and when placed prone he does not lift his head
from the ground. He does not smile or vocalize during the consultation.
Questions
• What are the most worrying features of this history and what diagnosis do you
suspect?
• What investigations should be performed in the first instance?
• What underlying diagnosis may be present?

213

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 71
It is clear from the history that there has been developmental regression – loss of previously attained developmental milestones. The abnormal movements are suggestive
of infantile spasms, a seizure type causing contraction of axial muscles, resulting in a
spectrum of abnormal movements from a small nod of the head to a full ‘jack-knife
spasm’. This combination makes it likely that this child has West syndrome, an epilepsy
syndrome characterized by infantile spasms, developmental regression and hypsarrhythmia (a chaotic pattern) on EEG. West syndrome starts in the first year of life and can
have a variety of underlying causes, including structural brain abnormalities, neurometabolic disease, neurocutaneous syndromes and acquired brain injury. The seizures are
difficult to control with medication, and the developmental outlook is poor. This is not
necessarily the case with all causes of developmental regression, and it is very important
to try to identify any treatable underlying disease, as this may dramatically change the
neurodevelopmental outlook.

!

Causes of developmental regression
Acquired brain injury
Seizure disorders
Neurometabolic/neurodegenerative
Toxic substances
Infectious
Pervasive developmental disorder

Examples
Hypoxia, meningitis
West syndrome, Landau–Kleffner
syndrome
Mitochondrial disorders, Tay–Sachs
disease
Heavy metal poisoning, e.g. lead
Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis,
prion disease
Autism, childhood disintegrative
disorder, Rett’s syndrome

In the first instance, this child will require an EEG to look for hypsarrhythmia and an
MRI scan to look for structural brain abnormalities. Blood tests should include a full
blood count, renal and liver function tests, calcium, phosphate, glucose, lactate, ammonia
and amino acids. Urine should be sent for urine amino and organic acids. Examination
with a Wood’s (ultraviolet) light will help to determine if there are hypopigmented areas
of skin, which may be difficult to see in normal light and could indicate an underlying
neurocutaneous syndrome. Further investigations should be directed by a paediatrician
with experience in neurology and epilepsy.
The presence of depigmented patches on the skin (possibly ash leaf macules) raises the
possibility of tuberous sclerosis. Seizures are a common presenting feature and indicate the presence of hamartomas in the central nervous system. This neurocutaneous
syndrome is autosomal dominantly inherited, although many cases are new mutations.
Clinical features are due to hamartomas which occur in multiple organs, including brain,
skin, eyes, kidneys and heart. Tuberous sclerosis arises from defects in either of the two
genes encoding the interacting proteins (tuberin on chromosome 16, and hamartin on
chromosome 9) involved in the regulation of cellular growth and differentiation. The

other two most common neurocutaneous syndromes are neurofibromatosis and Sturge–
Weber syndrome.

KEY POINTS

• Developmental regression requires prompt and thorough evaluation by a specialist.
• Infantile spasms are usually associated with diseases with a poor prognosis.
• Tuberous sclerosis is one of the commonest causes of developmental regression and
infantile spasms.

CASE 72:

A DEAF BOY

History
Ronan is a 3-year-old boy with Down’s syndrome. He is brought to his GP because his
parents are worried about his hearing. He does not seem to notice when his parents call
his name if he is not looking directly at them, his speech has become less clear and his
nursery teachers are concerned that his behaviour has become more difficult to manage.
He has also started to snore when asleep.
Ronan was born at 36 weeks’ gestation. He required admission to the neonatal unit for
poor feeding and also needed a partial volume dilutional exchange transfusion for polycythaemia with hypoglycaemia and seizures. He had a normal newborn hearing screen.
He has a small ventricular septal defect and he had bacterial endocarditis 6 months
ago, necessitating a long course of intravenous antibiotics. His mother is a 30-year-old
teacher and his father is a 43-year-old manager of a computer company. They are both
well. Ronan has been fully immunized, including an influenza vaccine last winter.

Examination
Ronan’s weight and length are on the 25th centile on the Down’s syndrome growth
chart. He smiles at you when you approach and seems to follow visual cues and be
affectionate with his parents. His speech is difficult to understand. Cardiovascular examination reveals a heart rate of 110 beats/min, a grade 3 pansystolic murmur, loudest at
the lower left sternal edge, and no signs of cardiac failure. His respiratory and abdominal examinations are unremarkable. Both tympanic membranes have a dull retracted
appearance with loss of the light reflex and some bubbles visible behind the membrane.
He has large tonsils that almost touch in the middle.
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of his hearing difficulties?
• What other possibilities are there?
• How could his hearing be assessed?

217

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 72
Ronan is most likely to have conductive hearing loss secondary to chronic otitis media
with an effusion (OME, or ‘glue ear’). This diagnosis is consistent with the fact that his
hearing has recently deteriorated, that he snores (indicating partial upper airway obstruction in sleep) and the findings on examination of his ears. Children with Down’s syndrome
are particularly vulnerable to OME because their large adenoids, small nasopharynx and
narrow Eustachian tubes make aeration of the middle ear less efficient. For these reasons,
children with Down’s syndrome should have regular screening for hearing impairment.
In addition to conductive deafness, sensorineural deafness is more common in children
with Down’s syndrome. The normal newborn hearing screen (otoacoustic emissions) makes
congenital sensorineural deafness unlikely. Sensorineural hearing loss can be acquired, and
a potential risk factor is the use of aminoglycoside antibiotics, e.g. gentamicin, which may
have been used in the treatment of his bacterial endocarditis. Aminoglycosides cause doserelated ototoxicity and some individuals also have an underlying genetic susceptibility.
Another possibility is that Ronan has autism. This is more common in children with Down’s
syndrome and can present with abnormal speech, language and behaviour, which may initially be attributed to hearing difficulties.

Ronan should be referred urgently to a paediatric audiology clinic, so that there is minimal
delay in detection of any significant hearing impairment, and to minimize further delay of
his speech and language development. Ideally, he would already have regular follow-up in
such a clinic. His hearing will be assessed using techniques appropriate to his developmental
age. These may include visual reinforcement audiometry (where a visual signal reinforces a
correct head-turning response to localize a sound), free field conditioning (where an auditory stimulus is the cue for an action in a simple game), and speech discrimination tests
(where toys are named at a set volume and identified by the child). He would also have
tympanometry performed to confirm negative middle ear pressures typical of OME. It would
also be important to ask if Ronan has sleep apnoea, which is associated with severe upper
airway obstruction and which may necessitate an adenotonsillectomy.
KEY POINTS

• It is important to recognize and refer hearing problems at an early stage.
• Conductive hearing loss due to glue ear is the most common cause of hearing
impairment.

• Children with Down’s syndrome have an increased risk of hearing problems and
require surveillance.

CASE 73:

A CHILD WITH A SQUINT

History
Rachel is a 9-month-old girl who is brought to her GP practice by her mother. Over the
last month her parents have noticed that her eyes don’t always seem to be looking in
the same direction. She was born at 35 weeks’ gestation after an emergency Caesarean
section for suspected placental abruption, but was in good condition at birth. There were
no medical problems after delivery. She had chickenpox 1 month ago, but has never
really been to the surgery otherwise, except for her immunizations. Her mother reports
that she his happy with her development, as Rachel is doing everything at about the
same age that her 3-year-old brother did.
Examination
Rachel is a healthy-looking child. She has an obvious right convergent squint. Figure 73.1
illustrates the appearance of her eyes as she looks around.

• What simple assessment can be performed?
• What should be done next?
219

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 73
Squint (strabismus) is a common problem, which may be intermittent or constant. The
visual axes of the eyes cannot be aligned simultaneously, resulting in the appearance
of one eye not looking in the same direction as the other. A right convergent squint
(esotropia) means that the right eye is turned in towards the nose when the left eye is
looking directly at a target.
Squints may be paralytic or concomitant. Paralytic squints are caused by dysfunction
of the motor nerves controlling eye movements (cranial nerves III, IV and VI). Whilst
paralytic squints are rare, it is essential to recognize them, as they may be the first sign
of a brain tumour or a neurological disorder. Concomitant squints are common and are
usually due to extraocular muscle imbalance in infants, or refractive errors after infancy.
The most common manifestation is the squinting eye turning medially. A concomitant
squint can also be the presenting feature of more serious eye disease, such as retinoblastoma. Rachel has a concomitant squint.
A squint can be confirmed by testing the corneal light reflex – shining a point light source
to produce a reflection on both corneas and looking at the position of the reflection on
each eye. Sometimes prominent epicanthic folds or a broad nasal bridge will create the
impression of a squint (pseudosquint), but in this case the light reflex will be normal. The
range of eye movements should be tested by moving a visual stimulus to determine if
there is a paralytic squint – the affected eye will not be able to follow the stimulus in all
directions. The red reflexes should be tested with an ophthalmoscope. Absence of the red
reflex indicates ocular pathology such as a cataract or retinoblastoma.
The cover test (see Fig. 73.2) should be performed to determine the nature of the squint.
Whilst the child looks at a visual stimulus, each eye is covered in turn. The observer looks at
the movement of the uncovered eye first, and then the covered eye as it is uncovered. When
the fixing eye is covered, the squinting eye will move to take over fixation. Sometimes
a squint may only be apparent when an eye is covered (latent squint) and this can be
inferred from movement of the eye as it is uncovered.

Neurology

Mild and intermittent squint may be present in the neonatal period and disappear without treatment. Any child over 3 months of age with a squint, or parental concern about
a squint, should be referred to an orthoptist or ophthalmologist for further assessment.
The aim is to detect any serious underlying pathology and to prevent the development
of amblyopia. In the developing brain, the image from the squinting eye is suppressed
to avoid diplopia. In an untreated squint, this leads to irreversible suppression of the
visual pathways, visual impairment in that eye and possible blindness. This phenomenon
is known as amblyopia. Treatments include correction of refractive errors with glasses,
patching of the good eye to force use of the other eye, and surgery on the extraocular
muscles.

KEY POINTS

• Squint is a common childhood problem.
• It is essential to determine if it is a paralytic or non-paralytic squint.
• Referral to a specialist is important to prevent development of amblyopia.

CHILD AND ADOLESCENT PSYCHIATRY
CASE 74:

A BOY WITH NO FRIENDS

History
Adrian is a 10-year-old boy with difficult behaviour at home, who comes for a
review to the community paediatric clinic. He was thought to have attention deficit
hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) after an initial consultation in the clinic. However,
information obtained from his school indicated that his teacher did not find his behaviour to be hyperactive or inattentive. His mother had mentioned that he didn’t seem to
have any friends to play with and that this seemed to be the reason he was always causing trouble at home. It is decided that it might be helpful to observe his behaviour in
school.
You observe Adrian at school over a 2-hour period. He does not know that you
are specifically watching him. Initially he has a games lesson: the children are
practising football skills. Adrian seems interested, but whenever the task involves a
complex instruction, he doesn’t seems to be able to follow it. When this happens, he
stands still or does his own thing. He doesn’t ask anyone else to explain what he is
supposed to do. He doesn’t join in with the playground banter between the other
children and the teacher. At the end of the lesson, there is a short game of football
and he is the last to be picked for a team. He seems to find it hard to anticipate the
flow of the game and runs around almost aimlessly. When he does get the ball he runs
straight down the pitch with it and ends up colliding with another child who is trying to
tackle him.
Next he is observed in the classroom, where he is doing mathematics. Again he participates very little in the classroom discussion and he doesn’t really speak to the other
children. He sits quietly, fidgets and slouches frequently, but doesn’t leave his seat. He
places his pens and ruler in a neat row and gets quite upset when another child borrows
his ruler and disrupts the pattern. When he is asked a question, he mumbles only half of
the answer. His book shows that he has worked out most of the simple sums correctly
but has struggled with the questions that required more reasoning.
His teacher reports that the staff find Adrian quite bewildering. Frequently he just
doesn’t understand the task he is asked to do and he often does his own thing, but
sometimes he is able produce complex pieces of work. Even with one-to-one teaching
it has been impossible to determine his true academic potential, and sometimes he gets
very upset when teachers try to give him extra guidance. His social interaction is always
odd, he doesn’t have any real friends, and although the other children will tolerate him
joining in their games, this frequently results in trouble. Sometimes he will just play on
his own, e.g. opening and closing the lock on the playground gate. He won’t participate
in discussions or drama and when he does speak in front of the class he may speak
with a strange intonation or say things that are not appropriate to the context. He gets
very anxious about apparently minor things such as changes in the day’s timetable. Last

222

Child and adolescent psychiatry

week he got upset several times each day because the classroom clock had not been set
to the right time.

Questions
• What underlying causes may explain Adrian’s problems?
• What additional assessment would be helpful?
• How might making a diagnosis help Adrian to achieve his full potential at school?

223

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 74
Adrian displays evidence of difficulties with social communication, social interaction and
obsessional behaviour. He may have an autistic spectrum disorder, possibly Asperger’s
syndrome. This diagnosis cannot be made with certainty from the brief history, and
further assessment would be needed. Other underlying or contributing problems might
include hearing difficulties, specific learning difficulties, social and emotional problems.
Autism is characterized by the triad of impairment of social communication, social interaction and rigidity of thought and behaviour. Unusual routines and interests, abnormal
sensory sensitivity and learning or other developmental difficulties may coexist. The
term autistic spectrum disorder is now widely accepted and recognizes that there can be
considerable variation in the severity of symptoms.
Autistic disorder is the most severe end of the spectrum and is usually diagnosed in early
childhood. Affected children are often non-verbal, with cognitive impairment and highly
stereotyped behaviours. At the milder end of the spectrum there may be relatively little
impairment of communication, leading to a diagnosis being made later in life, if at all.
Asperger’s syndrome is at the mild end of the autistic spectrum and individuals are usually of average or above-average intelligence, have difficulties understanding non-verbal
communication cues, find it difficult to form friendships and difficult to empathize with
others. Autistic spectrum disorders may affect up to 1 per cent of children in the UK.
Additional assessment should include a hearing test and assessment by a paediatrician
with an interest in autistic spectrum disorders (usually a community paediatrician) or a
child and adolescent mental health team. Often a clinical psychologist or a multidisciplinary team of other professionals will be involved in the assessment. Detailed developmental, medical, family and social histories should be taken. Adrian’s social skills,
communication and behaviour will be observed. Sometimes this is done in a standardized way using an observational assessment. The process needs the support of the family, who should understand that the eventual outcome might be a diagnosis of autistic
spectrum disorder.
Making a diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder can be very emotive. It can bring great
relief to parents and the child, but can also be met with denial or dismay. Understanding
the diagnosis will enable the teachers at Adrian’s school to understand why he behaves
in the way he does. It will allow the school to implement strategies to help Adrian to be
included as fully as possible in the curriculum. This will include individualized measures
to support social communication and behavioural interventions to assist the development of adaptive skills. The special educational needs coordinator at the school will help
to develop an individual education plan to help staff to know what Adrian’s needs are
and how they can best be met.

KEY POINTS

• Autism is characterized by impairments of social communication, social interaction
and rigidity of thought and behaviour.

• Autistic spectrum disorders may remain undiagnosed in late childhood and
adolescence.

• Making the diagnosis may help to find strategies to improve learning and behaviour.
224

CASE 75:

A HYPERACTIVE CHILD

History
Richard is a 6-year-old boy who is brought to the community paediatric clinic by his
mother. She asked her GP to refer Richard because she thinks he is hyperactive. She
describes him as ‘always on the go’, unable to sit still or concentrate on anything, and
never seeming to think before he acts. He is particularly difficult at home in the evenings and rarely goes to bed before midnight. His behaviour has been getting worse over
the last year. His mother says that she just can’t cope with his behaviour any more and
would like him to be put on some medicine to calm him down.
Richard was born at 35 weeks’ gestation, and his only medical problem has been
eczema. This has been difficult to control and he is under follow-up by a paediatric
dermatologist. He currently uses a combination of emollients and a topical steroid. He
has two teenage half-brothers and a 1-year-old half-sister. His mother is separated from
her partner and now looks after the children alone. She works part-time as a beautician.
The family lives in a small flat and Richard attends his local primary school. There have
been problems with anti-social neighbours, and Richard’s oldest brother has recently
been in trouble with the police.
Richard sits quietly whilst his mother gives this history. When asked directly, he says
that he enjoys school and gets on well with his brothers and sister. He misses his father,
whom he doesn’t see anymore. His mother says that he’s better behaved when he is outside the home, and other people don’t see what he’s really like.

Questions
• What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?
• What additional questions will help to determine if this is the diagnosis?
• What treatment can be used for ADHD?

225

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 75
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is characterized by inattention, hyperactivity
and/or impulsiveness, which are excessive for the child’s developmental age and cause
significant social or academic problems. The problems must have begun before 7 years
of age, have been present for at least 6 months, and must be present in more than one
setting, which usually means at home and at school. Children often appear to be constantly ‘on the go’, fidgety, unable to sustain concentration or organize themselves and
unable to wait their turn. ADHD affects 2–5 per cent of school-age children with boys
four times more commonly affected. In later life it is associated with an increased risk of
unemployment, criminality and substance misuse.
Many children have behaviour which overlaps with some of the features of ADHD. It
is important to distinguish between overactivity, one end of the normal spectrum, and
hyperactivity. Rarely, a physical disorder such as thyrotoxicosis will be misdiagnosed
as ADHD. In Richard’s case the history indicates that there are lots of potential psychosocial and emotional stresses that could cause difficult behaviour: a new sister, separated
parents, a mother trying to divide her attention between four children of very different
ages, disturbances by neighbours, poor sleep and a chronic medical problem.
It is important to establish when the problems first started, and how the behaviour problems have evolved in each of the domains of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsiveness. It is essential to discover whether the problems also occur at school, and this is
best done by contacting Richard’s teacher (with parental consent). There are standardized questionnaires that can be completed by parents and teachers to assess his behaviour more objectively. More family and social history will be useful to determine the
impact of all of the different stresses in his life. His bedtime routine and sleep patterns
need to be addressed because children who do not get enough sleep can often behave
in a hyperactive way. Richard’s progress at school, his development and his hearing
need to be carefully assessed. Finally, his mother’s agenda must be explored. Often the
child’s behaviour is more of a problem for the parents than the child. In fact, Richard’s
behaviour at school was fairly normal and he did not have ADHD. His problems were
attributed to his family circumstances and dynamics, and he was referred to a child
psychologist.
Treatments for ADHD are pharmacological and behavioural. Paradoxically, stimulant
medication helps to keep the child focused on a task and relieves many of the symptoms of ADHD. Methylphenidate is the usual first choice, but should only be commenced
under specialist supervision. Side-effects include loss of appetite, poor sleep and abdominal pain. Behavioural treatment aims to help the child and family modify their behaviour to minimize the impact of ADHD. Changes to how the child is dealt with in the
home and school environments may be needed.

KEY POINTS

• Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common condition.
• Similar symptoms can have many other causes.
• Stimulant medication should only be commenced under specialist supervision.

CASE 76:

A TEENAGER WHO WON’T EAT

History
Claire is a 15-year old girl who is urgently referred to the paediatric clinic because of
weight loss, nausea and a poor appetite. She is accompanied by her mother and father,
who do most of the talking. They were shocked when they took her on holiday 3 weeks
ago and they saw how little Claire ate. When they forced her to join them for meals in
restaurants, she complained of feeling sick and having no appetite. She has become an
increasingly picky eater over the last year or so, first becoming vegetarian and then
rarely eating with her parents because mealtimes clashed with her running training.
During that time she became the county cross-country running champion, and she trains
at least once every day. Her mother thinks she goes to the toilet more often than normal
and is worried that she has not menstruated for the last 4 months. Claire has lost a lot of
weight and all her clothes from 1 year ago are very loose on her.
Claire is quiet while her parents talk, but when asked directly she says that she doesn’t
think there is a problem. She says that she has lost some weight over the last year, but
that was necessary for her running. She eats when she is hungry and is very careful
about her diet because she needs the right foods to optimize her performance. She says
that she feels healthier than she ever has, although she admits that her running performance has deteriorated over the last two months. She enjoys her school, works hard and
achieves top grades. She says that things are fine at home and that her parents should
be proud of her rather than worried. She is quite pleased that she hasn’t menstruated for
4 months as periods are quite a nuisance. She says she is not sexually active and denies
any drug use. She is otherwise healthy and just takes laxatives occasionally for constipation. She has a 12-year-old brother whom she likes. Her father manages his own company and her mother is a dance teacher.

Examination
Claire’s weight is 39 kg ( second centile) and her height is 166 cm (75th centile). Her
skin is dry and her bones appear very prominent. She has fine downy hair over her
face. Her heart rate is 55 beats/min and regular, but otherwise cardiovascular, respiratory, abdominal and ear, nose and throat examinations are normal.
Questions
• What is Claire’s body mass index?
• What is the most likely diagnosis and what questions would help to confirm this?
• What other diagnoses must be considered?
• What physical complications can arise from this condition?

227

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 76
Body mass index (BMI) is calculated as weight (kg)/height2 (m2). Claire’s BMI is 14.2 kg/m2.
BMI centile charts are available for boys and girls and demonstrate the variation with
age. A BMI less than the fifth centile is considered underweight, and Claire falls well
below this.
The most likely diagnosis is anorexia nervosa. Claire is severely underweight, she exercises excessively, may abuse laxatives, has secondary amenorrhoea and denies the
seriousness of the problem. Specific questions about her attitude to her body shape, eating and weight gain should be asked. Symptoms of depression and obsessive compulsive
disorder should be sought, as these may coexist with anorexia.
Other diagnoses to consider include thyrotoxicosis, inflammatory bowel disease and
bulimia nervosa, although none of these would have all of the features described above.

Haematological – anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leucopenia
Skin – dry skin, lanugo hair, brittle nails

Management of anorexia nervosa requires specialist expertise and may involve inpatient treatment to establish weight gain and to correct any dangerous metabolic
derangements. During re-feeding, life-threatening changes in electrolytes and a cardiomyopathy may develop. Outpatient management tries to address the longer-term issues
of abnormal body perception and fear of weight gain.

KEY POINTS

• Anorexia nervosa is characterized by being severely underweight, a fear of weight
gain and an abnormal body perception.

• Anorexia nervosa can lead to dangerous physical complications.

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 77
The outcome for a baby destined to be born prematurely can be improved by the administration of corticosteroids to the mother, preferably at least 48 hours before delivery.
This increases surfactant production by the fetus, reduces the risk and the severity of the
respiratory distress syndrome, increases survival and reduces other morbidities. When
there has been prolonged rupture of membranes, administration of antibiotics to the
mother reduces the risk of sepsis in the newborn. Where possible, delivery should be
planned so that the neonatal team and their equipment are fully prepared and experienced members of staff are available. The parents should be counselled about what to
expect and the outcomes for a baby born prematurely. The importance of expressing
breast milk as soon as possible after delivery should be emphasized.
At delivery, the immediate management priorities for a premature baby are similar to
those for any other baby. However, heat loss will be greater, as they are smaller, the
lungs are stiffer due to surfactant deficiency and are more fragile, and the premature
baby will have fewer metabolic reserves. The baby should be dried and covered, or placed
in a plastic bag under a radiant heater. The baby should be assessed for breathing, heart
rate, colour and tone, and the airway positioned optimally. The baby will need respiratory support, which may be non-invasive continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP),
or intubation. Surfactant may need to be administered in the delivery room. Excessive
positive pressure ventilation (which may cause a pneumothorax) and hyperoxia should
be avoided. The baby should then be transferred promptly to the neonatal unit.
The chest radiograph shows airspace shadowing consistent with respiratory distress
syndrome (RDS, also known as hyaline membrane disease or surfactant deficiency disease). Surfactant is produced by type II pneumocytes and its production by the fetus
increases towards term. Deficiency of surfactant results in poorly compliant, lowvolume lungs, with ventilation–perfusion mismatching. Although surfactant production
will increase after delivery, this can be impaired by acidosis, hypoxia and hypothermia.
Clinical features include grunting, tachypnoea, chest recession and cyanosis. Exogenous
surfactant can be administered via an endotracheal tube and can be given electively to
very premature babies, who are very likely to develop RDS, or as rescue treatment when
RDS becomes apparent.

CASE 78:

A BREATHLESS NEWBORN

History
You are called to the labour ward to see a full-term newborn baby boy because he has difficulty breathing. He was born 15 min ago to a 20-year-old first-time mother, who apparently had little antenatal care. The baby was born by Caesarean section because it was
found to be in the breech position. The midwife said that the baby made a few cries immediately after birth, had good tone and a heart rate over 100 beats/min. She had placed him
on the resuscitaire and then had to attend to the mother. When she next looked at the baby,
he was breathing very fast and was making a grunting noise. The mother has mild learning
difficulties but no history of any other significant medical problems or of drug use.
Examination
The baby looks an appropriate size for his gestational age, he is not dysmorphic, and he
has been wrapped in a dry towel. His lips and tongue appear slightly blue. He is making
an intermittent grunting expiratory sound, and his respiratory rate is 70/min. Air entry
is reduced on the left side of his chest, with no increase in resonance on percussion. His
heart rate is approximately 150 beats/min, his heart sounds are normal and his femoral
pulses are palpable. His abdomen appears slightly concave.
He is transferred urgently to the neonatal unit and a chest radiograph (Fig. 78.1) is taken
shortly afterwards.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How should this newborn be managed?
• What other conditions can cause respiratory distress in a term newborn after an
unremarkable delivery?
231

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 78
The most common cause of respiratory distress in a term baby following a Caesarean
section is transient tachypnoea of the newborn due to delayed clearance of lung fluid.
However, this does not produce the clinical or radiographic features seen in this case.
Here the diagnosis is congenital diaphragmatic hernia. Although many cases are picked
up through antenatal screening, herniation of bowel through defects in the diaphragm
can occur late in gestation or even after delivery. It usually presents with respiratory
distress at, or shortly after, birth. The abdomen appears concave because some of its
contents are within the thorax, the mediastinum and apex beat may be displaced and
bowel sounds may be heard in the chest. The chest radiograph shows mediastinal shift
with air-filled bowel loops occupying the left hemithorax. The baby has been intubated,
a nasogastric tube is in place, and umbilical venous and arterial catheters have been
inserted.
It is important to intubate the baby early to prevent the swallowing of air, which can
cause expansion of the bowel within the chest and further respiratory compromise. If
the diagnosis is known before delivery, the use of bag-and-mask ventilation should be
avoided for the same reason. A nasogastric tube should be placed to aspirate gastric fluid
and air. Meticulous intensive care is needed to optimize the baby before surgery is performed because the lungs are usually hypoplastic (partly due to compression by bowel
within the thorax) and pulmonary hypertension is a frequent complication. Mortality
rates of 20 per cent are expected even with optimal care.

KEY POINTS

• Transient tachypnoea of the newborn is the most common cause of respiratory
distress in a term baby, most often following Caesarean section.

• A newborn with congenital diaphragmatic hernia should be intubated promptly to
prevent swallowed air distending the bowel within the thorax.

• Prognosis in congenital diaphragmatic hernia is mainly related to the degree of lung
hypoplasia, and the mortality rate is approximately 20 per cent.

CASE 79:

RECURRENT APNOEAS

History
Baby Carmichael is admitted to the neonatal unit on the day of birth because of a low
blood glucose. He was born at 35 weeks’ gestation by vaginal delivery after 48 hours
of ruptured membranes but an otherwise uneventful pregnancy. His birth weight was
2.0 kg (ninth centile). His mother had two previous pregnancies which resulted in liveborn infants. This baby was thought to be jittery within a few hours of birth, and blood
glucose was 1.8 mmol/L. A breast-feed was attempted, but he did not latch on well. He
was admitted to the neonatal unit at that point for a nasogastric feed, some blood tests
were done and the blood glucose rose to 3.2 mmol/L after the first feed. At the age of
6 hours he became apnoeic and a neonatal nurse stimulated him and gave some oxygen. Over the next hour he had five more apnoeic episodes requiring stimulation, and
on the last occasion he required a brief period of facemask intermittent positive pressure
ventilation.
Examination
Baby Carmichael does not appear dysmorphic, jaundiced or cyanosed. He appears lethargic (reduced spontaneous movement) and his tone feels reduced on handling. Respiratory
rate is 50/min with no signs of increased effort, oxygen saturation is 95 per cent in air,
and heart rate is 180 beats/min. His temperature is 37.8C. Femoral pulses, heart sounds
and breath sounds are normal. The abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds. His fontanelle is normotensive. His palate and genitalia are normal.

233

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 79
An apnoea is an episode of cessation of breathing lasting more than 20 s, or a shorter
time if there is bradycardia or a colour change. This is distinct from the normal newborn
pattern of periodic breathing, where fast respiration alternates with pauses of up to 10 s.

!

Causes of apnoea in a newborn

•

•
•
•
•
•
•

•

Apnoea of prematurity
Lung disease, e.g. respiratory distress syndrome
Congenital heart disease
Sepsis
Hypoglycaemia
Hypothermia
Sedative drugs (administered to mother in labour, or to baby)
Neurological insults – cerebral haemorrhage, oedema or seizures
Anaemia
Gastro-oesophageal reflux

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is sepsis. The baby was born prematurely after
prolonged rupture of membranes – both risk factors for sepsis. He was hypoglycaemic, a
common finding in septic newborns, and he has had recurrent and worsening apnoeas.
He is lethargic and has a slightly raised temperature. White cell count and CRP are unremarkable, but this is often the case early in the course of neonatal sepsis. The blood gas
shows a mixed metabolic and respiratory acidosis, indicating hypoperfusion and hypoventilation. This would be typical of early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) sepsis.
There is no information provided about whether the mother had any microbiological
samples taken, received intrapartum antibiotics, had a fever or had evidence of chorioamnionitis. These are all factors which would affect the risk of sepsis in the newborn. It
is also important to know whether the mother received any drugs during labour which
may suppress neonatal respiration, e.g. pethidine, or whether she uses any illicit drugs.
Given the presence of two risk factors for early-onset GBS sepsis, if the mother had
not received adequate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, the baby should have been
assessed, cultures taken and antibiotics commenced at birth. If this was not done as soon
as the baby showed the first signs of jitteriness and hypoglycaemia, sepsis should have
been suspected. This baby is now in a dangerous situation, where apnoeas may progress
to a respiratory arrest. Management priorities are to secure the airway with optimal positioning of the head, ensure adequate breathing with either CPAP or intubation, establish vascular access, give fluid boluses to achieve cardiovascular stability and administer
antibiotics as early as possible. After this, further assessment for the source of the sepsis,
and to exclude other causes of apnoea, can be undertaken.
KEY POINTS

• Apnoeas are a final common manifestation of many disease processes in the neonate.
• Any neonate with apnoeas requires prompt evaluation.
• Antibiotics must be administered urgently to a neonate with suspected early-onset
sepsis.

CASE 80:

A SUDDEN COLLAPSE IN A VENTILATED
PRETERM NEONATE

History
A 3-day-old neonate born at 26 weeks gestation, weighing 830 g, is being ventilated on
the neonatal intensive care unit. A chest X-ray at 4 hours of age demonstrated severe
respiratory distress syndrome. He is being ventilated by conventional mechanical ventilation with pressure settings of 24/3 cmH2O, a ventilator rate of 60 breaths/min and an FiO2
of 0.55. He has received surfactant and is sedated with an intravenous morphine infusion. His latest arterial gas showed a pH of 7.31, a PO2 of 7.2 kPa and a PCO2 of 6.2 kPa.
Having been very stable over the previous 24 hours, he suddenly deteriorates and
becomes deeply cyanosed with an oxygen saturation of 48 per cent. He also becomes
bradycardic with a heart rate of 64 beats/min. The nurse immediately puts up the FiO2
to 0.95 and the oxygen saturation rises to 84 per cent and the heart rate to above
100 beats/min.

Examination
The infant is being hand bagged by the neonatal unit sister with an FiO2 of 0.95, pressures of 30/4 cmH2O at a rate of approximately 40 breaths/min. The oxygen saturation
is 92 per cent. Heart rate is now 170 beats/min. The left hemithorax is moving poorly
and auscultation confirms that there is normal air entry on the right but poor air entry
on the left. A pneumothorax is suspected. The room lights are lowered and the chest
is transilluminated with a fibreoptic cold-light source. The result is inconclusive. Heart
sounds are normal and the anterior fontanelle is level. An urgent chest X-ray is ordered
(Fig. 80.1) and an arterial blood gas is performed.

Questions

• What is the treatment?

237

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 80
This question is best answered by considering whether the chest is not moving, whether
chest movement is decreased or asymmetrical, or whether chest movement is normal:

• no chest movement
– ventilator not working or tubing disconnected or kinked
– endotracheal tube blocked or dislocated
• chest movement decreased or asymmetrical
– pneumothorax
– worsening respiratory disease
• chest movement normal
– right-to-left shunt, e.g. across a patent ductus arteriosus
– large periventricular haemorrhage
– severe sepsis.
The diagnosis in this case is a left-sided tension pneumothorax with mediastinal shift
to the right (away from the side of the pneumothorax). A chest drain should be inserted
immediately.
If a pneumothorax is suspected clinically and cold-light transillumination demonstrates
that the chest ‘lights up’ on that side (the two sides should be compared), this is indicative
of a pneumothorax and a chest drain should be inserted and a chest X-ray is unnecessary. If the child deteriorates, a 23g butterfly needle can be inserted into the second intercostal space in the mid-clavicular line. Air can then be aspirated from the pleural space
and this can ‘buy time’ pending the insertion of a chest drain. The largest possible chest
drain should be used (usually 8, 10 or 12 FG depending on the size of the infant).
The drain should be inserted above the rib as the intercostal vessels lie immediately
below the rib. It should be inserted into the third, fourth or fifth intercostal space in
the mid-axillary line. Following insertion and the appropriate connections to an underwater seal, air bubbles should be seen, swinging should be observed on breathing and
the infant should rapidly improve. A chest X-ray should be done to ensure that the lung
has re-inflated and to check the position of the drain.

KEY POINTS

• A pneumothorax is a common cause of a sudden deterioration in a ventilated preterm
neonate.

• Diagnosis is by cold light transillumination and/or a chest X-ray.
• Urgent treatment is necessary. A needle aspiration can be done in the first instance if
the child is very unwell or deteriorating, but definitive treatment is with a chest drain.

Questions

241

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 81
The X-ray demonstrates the classic double bubble appearance due to dilatation of the
stomach and the proximal duodenum found in duodenal atresia. It is an erect film which
also shows a fluid level in the stomach and duodenum. There is a paucity of gas in
the remainder of the abdomen. The polyhydramnios is secondary to the inability of the
infant to swallow amniotic fluid (conversely, inability to excrete amniotic fluid in the
urine due to renal agenesis or dysgenesis leads to oligohydramnios). As the obstruction
is in the upper gastrointestinal tract, there is no abdominal distension.
Down’s syndrome is associated with duodenal atresia in 20 per cent of cases. Duodenal
atresia is also associated with malrotation, oesophageal atresia and congenital heart disease.
Contrast studies are occasionally needed, primarily to rule out malrotation and volvulus.
The pulse rate is raised (normal in a neonate is 100–180 beats/min), the blood pressure is normal and the peripheral capillary refill is prolonged. The urea and creatinine
are slightly raised. Initial treatment is with intravenous rehydration to correct the dehydration. A nasogastric tube is inserted and the stomach emptied. Where there is one
congenital abnormality, one should look for other abnormalities. Duodenal atresia is
associated with heart disease and this needs excluding prior to surgery.

KEY POINTS

• Bilious vomiting in a newborn should be regarded as a surgical emergency until
proven otherwise.

• Duodenal atresia leads to a double bubble appearance on the X-ray.
• There is a strong association with Down’s syndrome.

243

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 82
The causes of jaundice are best considered by dividing jaundice into early-onset, normalonset and late-onset jaundice.

!

Causes of jaundice
Early onset (first 24 hours, haemolytic jaundice)

• Rhesus haemolytic disease
• ABO incompatibility
• G6PD deficiency (commonest in those of African, Asian, or Mediterranean
descent)

• Hereditary spherocytosis
Normal onset
Physiological (all newborns get a degree of jaundice peaking at 4–5 days)
Bruising

Jaundice can also be a non-specific marker of neonatal infection at any stage.
Neonatal jaundice can be dangerous, as unconjugated bilirubin can cross the blood–brain
barrier. Very high levels can lead to kernicterus which can cause deafness and choreoathetoid cerebral palsy.
The cause of the jaundice in this infant is ABO incompatibility. His mother is O and
will therefore have anti-A and anti-B antibodies in her blood. Theses antibodies can
cross the placenta and lead to haemolysis in infants with either blood group A or B. This
is further confirmed by the positive DAT (though, on occasion, this test can be negative). The decreased haemoglobin and raised reticulocyte count provide further evidence
of haemolysis. The presence of a few spherocytes is common in ABO incompatibility.
The normal temperature, normal inflammatory markers and normal urine dipstick make
infection unlikely. Unlike Rhesus haemolytic disease, it can occur with the first pregnancy and does not get worse with successive pregnancies.
There are graphs that provide guidelines stating at what bilirubin level treatment with
phototherapy and an exchange transfusion are indicated. The guidelines depend on
the age of the infant, their weight, gestation and on whether they are well or ill. This
infant’s bilirubin level is well above the exchange transfusion line. Phototherapy should
be commenced immediately and blood taken for cross-match (for O blood to minimize further haemolysis). The fall in birth weight of 8 per cent and the raised urea and
creatinine suggest a degree of dehydration which could be exacerbating the jaundice.
244

Neonatology

Maintenance intravenous fluids should therefore be commenced and breast-feeding can
be continued. Appropriate lines should be inserted to enable the exchange transfusion
to take place. The blood for the transfusion usually has to be ordered from the regional
blood transfusion centre. It is possible that the bilirubin will have fallen markedly by
the time the blood has arrived, in which case the exchange transfusion may be avoided.
Following discharge, the haemoglobin should be monitored, a hearing test arranged and
development followed up.

KEY POINTS

• Neonatal jaundice is a potential cause of kernicterus that can lead to deafness and
cerebral palsy.

• Jaundice may be more difficult to diagnose in Asian and Afro-Caribbean babies.
• Treatment in severe cases consists of phototherapy  an exchange transfusion.

CASE 83:

A FLOPPY INFANT

History
You are asked to review a baby on the postnatal ward who has not been feeding well.
It is a 1-day-old girl, who is the first baby of a 23-year-old Scottish woman. She was
born at 39 weeks’ gestation and the pregnancy was uncomplicated. The baby was delivered with a ventouse and weighed 3.2 kg (25th–50th centile). The mother reports that the
baby has not been very active since she was born and that she has hardly latched on to
the breast.
Examination
The baby looks alert and is not dysmorphic. Head circumference is 34.5 cm (50th centile)
and the anterior fontanelle is normal. She makes almost no antigravity movements and
lies in a ‘frog leg’ posture. Respiratory, cardiovascular and abdominal examinations are
unremarkable. She appears to make conjugate eye movements in all directions, there is
no facial asymmetry and she has normal facial expression. Red reflexes are normal. Tone
appears to be symmetrically reduced in the upper and lower limbs, and tendon reflexes
cannot be elicited. When she is held vertically, she feels like she is slipping downwards,
and she is unable to raise her head at all when held horizontally under her abdomen.
The sucking reflex is very weak and there appears to be fasciculation of the tongue.
Questions
• What can be concluded from the neurological examination?
• What additional questions should the mother be asked?
• What is the most likely diagnosis and what are the other possible causes of a floppy
infant?

247

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 83
This baby has a very abnormal neurological examination. The key findings are severe
hypotonia and weakness with preservation of facial and eye movements, absent deep
tendon reflexes, poor sucking reflex and fasciculation of the tongue. These features indicate a process affecting the lower motor neurones of the entire spinal cord and selective
cranial nerve motor nuclei (IX and XII).
In this case it is likely that there is an underlying genetic cause for the baby’s condition,
so further questions should be asked to try to substantiate this. Parental consanguinity,
history of previous pregnancies ending in miscarriage or stillbirth, other family members
with medical problems and pregnancies in other family members should be asked about. In
the current pregnancy, there may have been reduced fetal movements. The parents should
be asked in detail about whether they have any medical problems, and direct questions
about symptoms of neuromuscular disease, including weakness, fatiguability and muscle
cramps. In assessing any floppy infant, it is important to establish whether an acquired
cause may be present, so an assessment should be made of the maternal drug history and
of any drugs given during labour, whether any brain or spinal cord injury may have been
sustained during delivery, and any risk factors for sepsis or features of metabolic disease.
An infant can be floppy due to ‘central’ or ‘peripheral’ (neuromuscular) causes. In the
former, deep tendon reflexes are present, and in the latter they are absent and the child
has marked weakness. Central causes are much more common than peripheral causes. In
this case, the clinical findings are of a peripheral cause and the most likely diagnosis is
infantile spinal muscular atrophy (SMA type 1). SMA is an autosomal recessive condition,
with type 1 affecting about 1 per 10 000 live births. Sixty per cent of affected infants will
be floppy at birth. Motor neurone degeneration leads to progressive weakness and death
usually occurs from respiratory complications, e.g. pneumonia, within the first year of life.

!

Causes of a floppy infant
‘Central’ – hypotonic but not
significantly weak
Chromosomal disorder,
e.g. Down’s syndrome,
Prader-Willi syndrome
Brain injury, e.g. hypoxic-ischaemic
encephalopathy
Brain infection or sepsis
Metabolic disturbance,
e.g. hypoglycaemia
Drug exposure, e.g. pethidine

‘Peripheral’– hypotonic, weak, areflexic
Infantile spinal muscular atrophy

Congenital myasthenia
Congenital myotonic dystrophy
Congenital myopathy
Congenital muscular dystrophy

KEY POINTS

• An infant can be floppy due to central or peripheral (neuromuscular) causes.
• Assessment of muscle power and deep tendon reflexes helps to classify the likely
causes.

• Central causes of hypotonia are the most common.
248

CASE 84:

A DIFFICULT DELIVERY

History
A 34-year-old woman with gestational diabetes in her first pregnancy is admitted to the
labour ward at 41 weeks’ gestation in active labour. She is obese (weight 105 kg). Her notes
indicate that she was recommended dietary control of her gestational diabetes. Her attendance at antenatal clinic was erratic, and she did not regularly measure her blood glucose
concentration. Induction of labour had been discussed previously, as it was felt that the
fetus was large. The mother had declined this, stating that she wanted to have a natural
birth. The fetal anomaly scan at 20 weeks had been normal, but she had not attended for
tests of fetal well-being after 38 weeks’ gestation.
The delivery is complicated by severe shoulder dystocia and extra help is summoned,
including a neonatal ‘crash call’. On arrival of the neonatal team, the baby is still not
delivered and the obstetric consultant has just arrived. After 15 min have elapsed from
delivery of the head to delivery of the body, a large baby boy is delivered.

Questions
• What immediate problems should be anticipated and why do they occur?
• What will this baby look like at delivery?
• How should the baby be immediately assessed and managed?
• What are the possible complications for the baby?

249

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 84
This baby will almost certainly have suffered an acute asphyxial insult as a result of cord
compression while delivery of the body was prevented by the shoulder dystocia. The neonatal team should anticipate that the baby will require significant resuscitation and should
ensure that a senior neonatologist is present. Obstruction of the fetoplacental circulation for more than a few minutes causes hypoxia, the fetus ceases breathing movements
(primary apnoea), becomes bradycardic and circulation is directed to essential organs.
Acidosis develops and, after a longer period of asphyxia, episodic reflex gasping occurs. If
aeration of the lungs does not occur, these gasps diminish and a phase of terminal apnoea
occurs, from which the fetus can only be saved by delivery and artificial ventilation. At
delivery this baby will probably be apnoeic, bradycardic or asystolic, pale and floppy.
Resuscitation of the newborn baby is unique. If there has never been aeration of the
lungs, this must be achieved before any other interventions will work. The baby should
be dried, covered and assessed for colour, tone, breathing and heart rate. If the baby is
not breathing, the airway should be opened by placing the head in the neutral position
and five inflation breaths should be given. The first few inflation breaths may not produce chest movement because they act to displace lung fluid. The effectiveness of inflation breaths should be assessed by checking for an increase in heart rate. If this has not
occurred it should be confirmed that the chest is being inflated before commencing cardiac compressions. This baby may also require adrenaline and sodium bicarbonate to be
administered via an emergency umbilical venous catheter in order to achieve a return of
cardiac output. The blood glucose should also be checked, especially as his mother had
diabetes in pregnancy. After immediate resuscitation, the baby will need to be transferred to the neonatal unit for supportive and neuroprotective care.
The outcome of acute asphyxia can be good if the episode is brief and effective resuscitation is provided. More severe asphyxia can lead to hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy
(HIE) and death. In addition, shoulder dystocia is associated with brachial plexus injury
and fracture of the clavicle and humerus.

Complications of birth asphyxia
First days after resuscitation
Encephalopathy, seizures, cerebral oedema
Hypoventilation
Myocardial dysfunction
Persistent fetal circulation
Renal dysfunction
Hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia

Long term (mostly after severe HIE)
Cerebral palsy

KEY POINTS

• If a baby is likely to have suffered severe asphyxia, senior assistance is required.
• Newborn resuscitation has a unique algorithm because the lungs have never been
inflated with air.

• Birth asphyxia affects multiple organs, although most long-term complications are
neurological.

CASE 85:

A NEWBORN WITH CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES

History
A midwife on the postnatal ward asks for a male infant to be reviewed on the day of
birth because she is concerned that his ears look abnormal. The baby was born at term
in good condition after a normal vaginal delivery. His mother is a 28-year-old sales
manager, and this was her first pregnancy. She received routine antenatal care and her
booking blood tests and anomaly scan were unremarkable. She and her partner have no
medical problems. She is worried that the baby’s ears look abnormal and wants to know
whether anything can be done to improve their appearance.
Examination
The birth weight was 2.6 kg (second centile) and head circumference 33.5 cm (ninth centile). The baby has small, abnormal-looking ears and an iris coloboma (a defect in the
iris). Respiratory examination is unremarkable. Cardiac examination reveals a heart rate
of 140/min, normal femoral pulses, normal apex beat, but a grade 3/6 pansystolic murmur
that is loudest at the lower left sternal edge. Abdominal examination reveals a very small
penis with undescended testes. Neurological examination is normal, the palate is normal
and the hips are normal.
Questions
• What explanation should be given to the parents at this stage?
• What different mechanisms can lead to congenital abnormalities?
• How should a child with multiple congenital abnormalities be assessed?

251

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 85
This infant has multiple congenital abnormalities. The explanation given to the parents
by the junior doctor must be honest but gentle, and should avoid speculation about
prognosis. It would be appropriate to explain that congenital abnormalities are quite
common, but in addition to the ear abnormalities the parents have noticed, there are
other abnormalities, which need to be assessed by a more senior colleague. The iris coloboma and the genital abnormalities can be pointed out and the heart murmur should be
mentioned. The combination of multiple abnormalities suggests an underlying cause or
syndrome. The parents will be upset by the news, but will appreciate honesty and hard
work in order to give them further information as soon as possible.
Congenital anomalies affect about 3 per cent of live births, although not all of these are
obvious at the time of birth. They can be divided into malformations due to errors during
morphogenesis, and deformations which affect a previously normally formed part of the
fetus. Most malformations do not have a defined aetiology and are considered sporadic.

!

Causes of congenital malformations

• Genetic

•

•

– chromosomal abnormalities, e.g. 22q11 deletion (DiGeorge syndrome)
– gene defects, e.g. CHD7 (chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 7
mutations causing CHARGE syndrome)
Environmental
– maternal factors, e.g. diabetes (cardiac malformations)
– prescribed drugs, e.g. phenytoin (fetal hydantoin syndrome)
– recreational drugs, e.g. alcohol (fetal alcohol syndrome)
– environmental toxins, e.g. dioxins (central nervous system anomalies)
– infections (e.g. rubella, cytomegalovirus)
Sporadic

Assessment of a child with multiple congenital abnormalities should determine whether
there are other abnormalities, the severity of those already detected, and the underlying cause if possible. Sometimes a characteristic pattern of abnormalities will reveal
the diagnosis. Karyotyping should be performed and other specific genetic tests may be
required. A clinical geneticist should be asked to assess the child if a unifying diagnosis
is not apparent. In this case the findings suggest CHARGE syndrome (coloboma, heart
defects, atresia choanae, retardation of growth and development, genital and ear abnormalities). Although there is no respiratory distress, choanal atresia should be excluded
(by attempting to pass a nasogastric tube through each nostril). The cardiovascular
examination findings would be consistent with a ventricular septal defect, the commonest congenital heart defect. Further assessments by a paediatric cardiologist, ophthalmologist, endocrinologist, urologist, audiological physician and developmental paediatrician
will be needed. Making a diagnosis may allow future problems to be anticipated and
allows genetic counselling about the recurrence risk in future pregnancies.
KEY POINTS

• Congenital abnormalities are common.
• If one congenital abnormality is present, you should look for other ones.
• Recognizing a pattern of abnormalities comprising a syndrome is important for
prognosis and genetic counselling.

CASE 86:

SUDDEN DETERIORATION IN A TERM BABY

History
The midwife finds a 3-day-old male baby on the postnatal ward to be very lethargic and
breathing fast. The baby is taken to the neonatal unit for further evaluation. He was born
at term by emergency Caesarean section for undiagnosed breech presentation. There was
no prolonged rupture of membranes. The pregnancy had been unremarkable to that point
and all antenatal scans had been normal. Mother is blood group O-positive, had negative
HIV, hepatitis B and syphilis serology and was rubella immune. The delivery was attended
by a paediatrician but the baby cried immediately and needed no resuscitation. His birth
weight was 3.5 kg (50th centile) and the first-day check was unremarkable. He has been
breast-fed and although there were problems latching on initially, he fed well on day 2.
He seems rather sleepy and has had frequent non-bilious vomits today. His mother is a
23-year-old woman from Pakistan who speaks good English and this is her first baby.
Examination
The baby’s temperature is 36.3C, his heart rate is 160 beats/min and his respiratory
rate is 70 breaths/min. Oxygen saturation is 99 per cent in air, capillary refill is 2–3 s,
and blood pressure is 60/40 mmHg. There is subcostal and mild sternal recession. He
responds to vigorous stimulation and pain, but otherwise is very lethargic. The chest is
clear, heart sounds and femoral pulses are normal, and the abdomen is normal. The fontanelle is normotensive. He has a strong odour which is slightly unpleasant.

253

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 86
The history describes a term neonate who became very ill over a short period of time.
The important diagnoses to consider are discussed in Case 10 (p. 31–32).

!

Approach to blood gas interpretation
In this case
Look at the pH
Look at the PCO2
Look at the base excess

pH 7.35, acidosis
PCO2  4.7 kPa, respiratory compensation
Lower than 2.5, metabolic acidosis

The blood gas analysis shows a severe metabolic acidosis, with unsuccessful respiratory
compensation. This fits with the clinical picture of a tachypnoeic baby.
Important points to note are the absence of risk factors for sepsis, the absence of signs
of circulatory compromise, a lethargic baby with a strong odour, ketonuria and a severe
metabolic acidosis without significant hyperlactataemia or hypoglycaemia. These findings point to an inborn error of metabolism, where excess acid is accumulating in the
blood due to a metabolic defect. Possible causes include propionic, methylmalonic and
isovaleric acidaemias. Remembering the names is less important than recognizing this
type of presentation.
Emergency management consists of stopping feeds and starting an infusion of 10 per cent
dextrose. Whilst sepsis is unlikely to be the sole cause of the illness, it could be a contributing factor and antibiotics should be administered. The baby needs to be assessed promptly
by an experienced paediatrician as he is likely to require intubation and ventilation
if he starts to tire or cannot protect his airway. It is likely that sodium bicarbonate would
be beneficial to partially correct the acidosis, and the case should be discussed urgently
with the regional paediatric metabolic centre, as specific therapies may be recommended
even before a certain diagnosis is available. To assist in making a diagnosis, blood
should be sent for ammonia, plasma amino acid profile, and urine for amino and organic
acid profiles.
This baby had consanguineous parents (first cousins), increasing the risk of an autosomal
recessive inborn error of metabolism. He required intubation and ventilation until the
acidosis was corrected and he was then transferred to the regional metabolic unit. The
diagnosis turned out to be isovaleric acidaemia.
KEY POINTS

• Metabolic disease can present as a sudden deterioration in the neonatal period.
• Metabolic disease is rare and management must be discussed with an expert.

254

CASE 87:

A CASE OF POSSIBLE TRISOMY

21

History
The midwife on the GP delivery unit has requested a review of a baby born 15 minutes
ago. During the baby check she has noted what she thinks are features of trisomy 21
(Down’s syndrome). She has looked after the mother for most of the pregnancy. The
mother is 26 and the father is 28, and this is their second child – they have an 18month-old daughter. The pregnancy was unplanned although the parents were delighted
when they found out. They had a negative first trimester screen for trisomy 21.
Examination
The baby is a boy with dysmorphic features typical of trisomy 21. Examination of the
cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems appears normal.
Questions
• What are the typical dysmorphic features of trisomy 21?
• What specific investigations should this baby have?
• How should you discuss this with the parents?

255

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 87
Dysmorphology is the study of human congenital malformations and dysmorphic features
are abnormal body characteristics. Some are common in the general population and in isolation are not significant, e.g. single palmar crease. A syndrome is a well-characterized group
of such abnormalities occurring together that often point to a single condition as the cause.

!

Characteristic dysmorphic features of trisomy 21

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hypotonia
Flat face
Upward slanting palpebral fissures
Epicanthic folds
White speckles in the iris (Brushfield spots)
Short broad hands
Single palmar and plantar fissures (Simian crease)

There are several associated features, the commonest of which are low IQ (average IQ
about 50), congenital heart disease, duodenal atresia and short stature.
Chromosomes must be sent for urgent analysis. This is to confirm the clinical suspicions,
look for mosaicism (⬃1 per cent) that might alter the prognosis and to exclude a translocation. If a translocation is identified, parental chromosomes must be analysed in case
one is a carrier with a high risk of recurrence. The incidence of cardiac anomalies is so
high (35 per cent) that all children with trisomy 21 should have a cardiac echocardiogram even if no murmur is detected. An atrioventriculoseptal defect (AVSD) is the characteristic association with trisomy 21, but a ventriculoseptal defect is the commonest
abnormality.
Although the risk of Down’s syndrome rises with maternal age, most mothers of children
with Down’s syndrome are 30 years as this is the group that has the greatest number
of children.
Breaking bad news is never easy but parents will always remember the first discussion.
They should be seen by a senior paediatrician with the midwife who knows them well
and other family members if they wish. If English is not their first language, an interpreter should be supplied – this should not be a family member as this person needs
to be impartial. The discussion should take place in a private room with no phones or
bleeps and plenty of time should be allowed. Avoid jargon and use diagrams to help
explanations.
It is worth exploring if they have noticed anything. Expect distress, anger, guilt, shame –
in fact, any emotion. They are likely to ask how this could happen when they were
given a negative screen result. There is a very common misconception amongst the public and professionals that a negative screen completely excludes the diagnosis. Antenatal
screening programmes identify those at high risk to whom a definitive diagnostic test
(e.g. amniocentesis) should be offered.

256

Neonatology

Acknowledge that it is normal to forget much of this first meeting. Arrange another meeting soon afterwards and suggest they write down any questions that arise in the meantime.
Written material is available from Down’s syndrome charities and their websites.

KEY POINTS

• Negative antenatal screening does not mean zero risk.
• Chromosomes must always be analysed even if the clinical findings are absolutely
characteristic of a syndrome.

CASE 88:

ABNORMAL MOVEMENTS IN AN

8-DAY-OLD BABY

History
Andrew is an 8-day-old infant referred to the paediatric day unit by the midwife. She
and the parents report at least six brief (approximately 30 s) episodes of rhythmical shaking of all four limbs associated with abnormal tongue and eye movements. These do not
seem to be related to feeds or sleep, nor do they seem to be causing him any distress.
Andrew is breast-fed and has regained his birth weight. He was born at term following
an uneventful pregnancy to healthy unrelated parents. The delivery was straightforward
and Andrew was in good condition at birth. They were discharged home 6 hours after he
was born. He is their second baby.
Examination
Andrew looks well. His weight, length and head circumference are all between the 25th
and 50th centiles. There are no dysmorphic features. He is afebrile and his pulse is
130 beats/min. Both heart sounds are normal, there are no murmurs and femoral pulses
are palpable. Examination of the respiratory and abdominal systems is unremarkable
and he has normal male genitalia. His anterior fontanelle is soft. He handles well with
normal tone and primitive reflexes. However, during the examination he has two episodes similar to those described by the midwife; both are self-limiting and are accompanied by cyanosis and a change in his cry.

259

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 88
Andrew is having seizures. Remember these are a symptom, not a diagnosis, and the
causes are numerous. The approach to a fitting child is:
1. Give high-flow oxygen, place on a cardiac monitor.
2. Obtain intravenous access. Send relevant tests, starting with the basic and common.
3. Treat immediately what can be treated. Check blood glucose and treat hypoglycaemia
after taking specimens to identify a cause. Start intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g. benzylpenicillin and gentamicin – although sepsis is unlikely, it is a possibility that needs to be treated.
4. Control the seizures with appropriate anticonvulsants. In neonates this is usually a
loading dose of phenobarbital, followed, if necessary, by maintenance.
The results show that Andrew has significant hypocalcaemia, low enough to cause seizures. It is likely to be real because the phosphate is high but, as with all unusual results,
it should be repeated. If confirmed, the hypocalcaemia should be treated with intravenous calcium but only after taking samples to investigate the cause. It is crucial not to
lose this opportunity to make a diagnosis because endocrine and metabolic pathways
correct very rapidly.

!

Causes of hypocalcaemia in infancy

• Prematurity
• Hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE)
• Hypoparathyroidism – transient (associated with prematurity, HIE or maternal
diabetes) or permanent

• Hypomagnesaemia – magnesium facilitates release of parathormone (PTH)
• Exchange transfusion – citrate in transfused blood chelates calcium to prevent
clotting

• Familial activating mutations of the calcium-sensing receptor – the calcium level
•
•
•

at which PTH is released is lower than normal; some cases labelled as ‘familial
hypoparathyroidism’ are probably this disorder
Maternal hypercalcaemia – suppresses fetal PTH
Maternal vitamin D deficiency
In older children, vitamin D deficiency is the commonest cause, but the ALP
would be high due to the increased bone turnover in rickets (see Case 22, p. 66).

Most of these can be excluded from the history. The next tests to send are magnesium,
parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D and maternal bone biochemistry. However, the
high phosphate (PTH is phosphaturic) and normal ALP suggest hypoparathyroidism. The
causes of permanent hypoparathyroidism that present in the neonatal period include
DiGeorge syndrome – a disorder associated with microdeletions of chromosome 22q11.2,
congenital heart disease and thymic aplasia. PTH is not available therapeutically so
treatment of hypoparathyoidism is with vitamin D, but this does not stop the renal loss
of calcium that PTH normally prevents. To minimize the risk of nephrocalcinosis, calcium is maintained at low normal or mildly subnormal levels and the urinary calcium/
creatinine ratio is monitored.
260

Neonatology

All children with neonatal seizures of any cause are at risk of developmental problems
and need surveillance.

KEY POINTS

• In any case of hypocalcaemia or hypoglycaemia, relevant samples should be taken
before treatment to maximize the opportunity of making a definitive diagnosis.

• Children with neonatal seizures of any cause are at risk of developmental problems
and need surveillance.

MISCELLANEOUS
CASE 89:

A FRACTURE IN AN INFANT

History
Bobby is a 13-week-old baby brought to the A&E department one evening by his parents
because he is not moving his left leg. They both report that he seemed fine during his
bath the previous evening and went to bed as usual. He was awake on and off during the
evening, but with a recent cold has been more difficult to settle. They share the baby’s
care and last night it was his father’s turn, but he is adamant that he noticed nothing
untoward when he fed him and changed his nappy. Bobby’s mother recalls being woken
by him crying but is not sure of the time. They both noticed the leg when they woke
up this morning. Bobby’s mother wanted to bring him in straight away but his father
persuaded her that it was probably the way he had slept and that they should wait a
while.
Bobby was born at 37 weeks. He was in good condition at birth and they have no concerns about his development. He has been bottle-fed from birth and is often difficult to
feed, with quite severe symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux. The GP has prescribed
Gaviscon but without much improvement. He is on no other regular medication. No diseases run in the family. His father is aged 19 and his mother is 18. They recently moved
from a more rural area in the hope of finding employment but with no success yet.
Neither of them has any family locally nor has anyone else taken care of Bobby in the
past couple of days. They are living in a two-room flat and the baby sleeps in a cot in
their bedroom.

Examination
Bobby is a healthy, well-grown baby. The parent-held record shows that he has been
gaining weight along the 9th centile. His length is on the 25th centile, as is his head circumference. The only abnormality is that he is not moving his left leg and cries in pain
when it is moved. There is soft tissue swelling overlying the left femur. His temperature
is 37.7C and he is a bit coryzal. His sclerae are normal.

INVESTIGATIONS
An X-ray of Bobby’s left leg is shown in Figure 89.1.

262

Miscellaneous

Figure 89.1 An X-ray of Bobby’s left leg.

Questions
• What does the X-ray show?
• What are the worrying features in the history?
• What other investigations must he have?
• Outline the management

263

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 89
The X-ray shows a mid-shaft spiral fracture of the left femur. The majority of childhood
fractures are accidental with an explanation that fits the injury. However, non-accidental injury (NAI) must always be considered and there are certain patterns of presentation
and findings that ring alarm bells. The child’s age and mobility are very important factors. The fracture site and type are also important. Metaphyseal and posterior rib fractures are very suspicious and a spiral fracture suggests a twisting injury – unlikely in a
non-weight-bearing infant. So the most worrying features in this history are an unexplained spiral long bone fracture in an infant who is immobile and under constant adult
supervision. There has also been a delay in reporting the injury. All of these are features
that make any injury more likely to be non-accidental. Others include:

•
•
•
•

a history that is not consistent with the injury
a history that changes with time
inappropriate reaction(s) of carer(s) – vague, elusive or aggressive
history of a suspicious injury or NAI in child and/or siblings.

Any infant with suspected NAI must have a full skeletal survey with an expert radiology assessment because not all fractures are detectable clinically. Rib fractures may be
inconspicuous initially and a bone scan and/or a repeat chest X-ray may also be needed.
These investigations should also help exclude the rare differential of osteogenesis imperfecta. He should also have a brain CT scan to exclude injuries such as a subdural haemorrhage. If there is bruising, a full blood count and a clotting screen are necessary.

!

Steps in management

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Admit to manage the fracture and as a place of safety
Pain relief and immobilization in traction
Check the child protection register
Document, date and sign the history, examination and investigations
Inform a senior paediatrician, who will confirm the findings and explain openly
and non-judgmentally why there are concerns, what is going to happen next
and who will be involved
Refer immediately to Social Care. Where appropriate, they will involve the
police
Attend the multidisciplinary child protection conference to which the parents
are invited. Information is shared between all professional groups. Outcomes
are the decision of the conference, not of individuals. The aim is always to act in
the child’s best interest

This family have other risk factors for NAI. They are young, have no local support, and
there have been difficulties with feeding. The father admitted to losing his temper in
the middle of the night after neighbours complained about the crying. He wrenched the
baby’s leg trying to get it out of his sleep suit.
KEY POINTS

• The possibility of non-accidental injury should be considered in any childhood fracture.
• Thorough documentation is vital in all possible cases of non-accidental injury.
• Communication between all professional groups is essential in deciding the outcome
for the child and family.

CASE 90:

A VAGINAL DISCHARGE

History
Jasmine is a 4-year-old girl who presents to her GP with a yellow smelly vaginal discharge. Her mother states that her daughter is itching a lot and occasionally finds it difficult and painful to pass urine. There is no history of a foreign body. She is otherwise
well. A week previously she and her two siblings all had a cold. She has never had a
urinary tract infection. She had her tonsils and adenoids removed last year. Her mother
has type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism.
Examination
She is apyrexial. Her blood pressure 104/70 mmHg. There are no abdominal signs. The
vulval and perianal areas look erythematous with scratch marks and some areas of linear ulceration. A yellowish discharge can be seen. There is no bruising.

INVESTIGATIONS
Vulval swab – numerous white blood cells (WBCs), haemolytic Streptococcus grown
Urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity (M, CS) – numerous white blood cells, mixed
growth of three organisms

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What is the treatment?

265

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 90
The likely diagnosis is vulvovaginitis. Prepubertal girls may have a clear sticky discharge
that resolves with menarche. However, a malodorous discharge indicates pathology. It is
most likely that a Streptococcus was the cause of the upper respiratory tract infection
and that this infection was transmitted to the genital area by the child’s fingers. It is not
uncommon to get a degree of dysuria in association with vulvovaginitis. Occasionally
vaginal bleeding may occur. To definitively diagnose a urinary tract infection, there has
to be a pure growth of 105 colony-forming units/mL  WBCs. Jasmine’s results do not
fulfil this criteria. Poor perineal hygiene may cause or exacerbate vulvovaginitis, which
often presents shortly after girls have started self-toileting. Masturbation may also lead
to vulvovaginitis. Pinworms may be associated with perianal itching, especially at night,
and in about 20 per cent of cases there is an associated vulvovaginitis. If no worms
are visible, Sellotape can be applied to the perianal skin, stuck onto a glass slide and
then sent for microscopy to look for enterobius ova. Herpes infection can also lead
to vulvovaginitis. It leads to vesicles and to discrete ulcers. These are usually due to
digital contact with cold sores, but the possibility of sexual abuse should also be
borne in mind. Viral swabs should be taken. Recurrent vulvovaginitis usually ceases at
puberty.
The differential consists of candidal infection, a foreign body, sexually transmitted disease and the very rare botryoid sarcoma. Candida leads to a creamy white discharge,
vulval itching and dysuria. It is rare prepubertally but may occur in diabetics or following antibiotic use. A foreign body may consist of toilet paper or a toy. In young
children it may be visible on inspection, but on occasion may require an examination
under anaesthetic. Evidence of infection with an organism such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea suggests sexual abuse and should prompt a child protection investigation. A sarcoma usually presents with a bloodstained vaginal discharge. On examination, a fleshy
haemorrhagic lesion is seen, which is often described as ‘grape-like’.
Treatment consists of a 1-week course of penicillin. Basic hygiene measures should also
be advocated, such as cleaning oneself from front to back after a bowel motion, using
loose-fitting cotton knickers, having daily baths or showers using simple soaps (avoiding
bubble baths or other irritants) and allowing air to dry. A short course of topical oestrogen cream may also be helpful.

KEY POINTS

• Vulvovaginitis is common in prepubertal girls.
• Advice on hygiene  antibiotics is effective in treating this condition.
• In children with a vaginal discharge, the possibility of sexual abuse should also be
considered.

CASE 91:

AN ODD SHAPED HEAD

History
Colin is a 5-month-old boy who is referred to the paediatric clinic by his GP for assessment of an abnormal head shape. He was born at 38 weeks’ gestation by forceps delivery. Apart from a small bruise across his forehead, no abnormality was noted at that
time. He has not had any medical problems since birth, but his parents have noted that
over the last few months his head shape has become increasingly asymmetrical. They are
very worried about this cosmetically, and the GP has worried them further by suggesting that he may have craniosynostosis. Colin is the first child of American parents who
both work in banking. He was bottle-fed from birth because his mother found breastfeeding very difficult. He is described as a contented child who sleeps well and cries little.
Developmental history reveals that he can sit with support from cushions, although he
prefers lying on his back, he can pick up objects with the palm of either hand and puts
them in his mouth, he holds his milk bottle, he enjoys vocal turn-taking and makes a
range of sounds. When he was younger, he mainly lay on the right side of his head, but
this is less obvious now as he is able to move about more.
Examination
Colin is a healthy-looking boy. His weight is 7.5 kg (50th centile), his length is 67 cm (75th
centile) and his head circumference is 43.5 cm (50th centile). His head is parallelogramshaped when viewed from above, with the right occipital region appearing flattened (see
Fig. 91.1). There is no ridging over any of the cranial sutures. His face appears symmetrical and there are no dysmorphic features. He does not have a squint and cranial nerve
function appears normal. His anterior fontanelle is normal.
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of the abnormal head shape?
• What is craniosynostosis and what complications can it cause?
• What treatment might be available for Colin?

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 91
Colin almost certainly has positional (deformational) plagiocephaly. This occurs when
asymmetrical pressure on the developing occiput or skull base results in oblique flattening of the posterior skull. Causes include an asymmetrical sleeping position, torticollis and cervical spine abnormalities. There may be an underlying reason why the child
sleeps in an asymmetrical position, such as a neuromuscular disorder. The typical history
of positional plagiocephaly is that the baby either is born with or develops an abnormal
head shape sometime after birth, which then improves with time. If the child is born with
the abnormality, the deformation is due to compression in utero. As mobility increases,
the likelihood of persistent asymmetrical pressure decreases, and in most cases head
shape will return to normal. The major differential diagnosis is craniosynostosis. The
incidence of positional posterior plagiocephaly increased markedly following campaigns
to encourage infants to sleep on their back to reduce the risk of sudden infant death.
Craniosynostosis is premature fusion of one or more sutures of the skull, resulting in an
abnormal skull shape. The deformity is often present at birth, is progressive and does
not improve spontaneously. It can result in raised intracranial pressure and developmental delay. The head shape depends on the involved suture(s). For example, sagittal
synostosis results in a narrow head with an enlarged anteroposterior dimension, while
lambdoid synostosis results in occipital plagiocephaly. Superficially, the head shape in
lambdoid synostosis may be thought to be similar to that in positional plagiocephaly,
but in fact there are important differences in the way the structure of the skull and face
change, which can be used to make a diagnosis. In positional plagiocephaly, the fontanelle retains a diamond shape. Looking down on the top of the head, the head shape
is a parallelogram in positional plagiocephaly, produced by unilateral flattening of the
occipital area with ipsilateral bossing of the frontal and parietal bones. In lambdoid synostosis, there is unilateral flattening of the occiput but less frontal asymmetry, resulting
in a rhomboid head shape. In positional plagiocephaly, the ear ipsilateral to the flattened
occiput is displaced anteriorly, while in lambdoid synostosis it is displaced posteriorly
and inferiorly. In craniosynostosis, a ridge is often palpable in the area of the fused
suture. Where doubt remains, a skull X-ray or CT scan can be used to further assess
the sutures and craniofacial structure. Sometimes craniosynostosis is part of a syndrome
such as Apert’s or Crouzon’s syndrome, where the associated facial and other abnormalities usually make the diagnosis obvious.
It is likely that Colin’s head shape will improve spontaneously, and even if it does not
completely return to normal, hair growth will disguise much of the abnormal appearance. If the problem is severe or continues to worsen then treatment may be indicated.
Helmet moulding may have some benefit by rebalancing growth of the skull. In the most
severe cases, surgical intervention is sometimes warranted.

KEY POINTS

• Positional posterior plagiocephaly is the most common cause of abnormal head
shape.

• Craniosynostosis usually causes progressive deformation with a ridge palpable over
the fused suture(s).

• Positional plagiocephaly usually improves spontaneously.

A DROWSY TODDLER

History
Jonathan is a 21-month-old boy referred to the paediatric day unit by his GP. He was seen
in the surgery the previous day with diarrhoea and vomiting and seemed to have tummy
ache. The vomit contained a small amount of fresh blood, but as he was otherwise well
and cardiovascularly stable, admission had been deferred because his mother is 36 weeks
into her fourth pregnancy. Instead, later that day, the GP rang to check how he was and
was reassured to hear that he seemed to have recovered and was tolerating drinks and
some food. However, this morning he seems lethargic and a finger-prick blood glucose
test performed by his GP was only 3.1 mmol/L. Jonathan is the youngest of three children,
the older two being 6 and 3 years old. His father is in the navy and is currently at sea.
Examination
He looks unwell. His airway is patent, his respiratory rate is 26 breaths/min and his
pulse rate is 180 beats/min with a capillary refill time of 5 s. His blood pressure is
60/35 mmHg. He is jaundiced. Both heart sounds are present and normal. Examination
of the respiratory and abdominal systems is normal. He is drowsy but knows his mother
and responds to her voice. He resists examination and withdraws to pain. There is no
meningism and there are no focal neurological signs.

Questions
• What pathological processes are evident from his clinical signs and investigations?
• What is the most likely unifying cause?
• How is this condition managed?
269

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 92
Firstly, this boy has acute liver dysfunction. He has a prolonged prothrombin time,
hypoglycaemia and low albumin – these are markers of the manufacturing processes
of the liver. There is liver inflammation with an elevated ALT and bilirubin. Secondly,
he has clinical and biochemical evidence of tissue underperfusion and increased anaerobic metabolism. He has a tachycardia, borderline hypotension and a prolonged capillary refill time with a metabolic acidosis and a high lactate. There is a compensatory
reduction in the PCO2 (see Case 86, p. 253). Thirdly, there are clinical symptoms and
signs suggestive of mild encephalopathy, although his drowsiness could be due to the
hypoglycaemia. Finally, note the high urea. This could be due to dehydration but his
diarrhoea and vomiting were resolving and the creatinine is normal. It is more likely
to be due to the digestion of blood following upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding. Ask
about melaena stools.
The most likely unifying cause is some form of poisoning. This history is classical for
iron toxicity. Iron is corrosive to the gastrointestinal mucosa, causing abdominal pain,
nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea within a few hours of ingestion with haematemesis and
bloody diarrhoea in more severe toxicity. Thereafter, there is an interlude with an apparent recovery from about 8–16 hours. This boy has entered the third stage (16–24 hours)
with progressive systemic involvement due to the vasodilator effects of iron and mitochondrial poisoning. Toxicity is related to the amount of ferrous iron ingested, which
varies according to the particular iron salt. All preparations carry this information, e.g.
a ferrous fumarate tablet 210 mg contains 65 mg of ferrous iron. Toxicity is unlikely if
20 mg/kg is ingested but the risk increases steadily thereafter. Not many tablets are
needed to cause significant poisoning.

!

Management of iron poisoning

• Give oxygen and intravenous fluids to manage poor perfusion
• Treat hypoglycaemia
• Send the family home to check for missing drugs and to bring in any remaining
drugs for identification

• Whole iron tablets are radio-opaque – an abdominal X-ray to confirm ingestion
may help

• Try to remove the poison. If taken within 1 hour of presentation or tablets
visible in stomach on X-ray, consider gastric lavage with a wide-bore tube

• Measure serum iron urgently, but remember that it may be spuriously low if
taken  8 hours post-ingestion

• Try to estimate the quantity of iron ingested and the risk of toxicity
• Discuss with National Poisons Information Service (24 hour service) who will
advise about treatment with desferrioxamine, a specific chelator of iron

• Discuss with a specialist liver unit

This child’s mother was receiving iron treatment during her pregnancy and found the
pack in his bedroom. Iron is one of the most common causes of childhood accidental
poisoning because iron-containing preparations are widely available and often resemble
sweets. Some units ask a health visitor to undertake a home visit after any case of accidental poisoning to assess overall home safety and to remind parents about keeping all
drugs out of reach of children.
270

Miscellaneous
KEY POINTS

• Advice should be sought from the National Poisons Information Service if there is any
doubt about the management of a case of poisoning.

• Iron is one of the most common causes of childhood poisoning.

CASE 93:

A CONFUSED TEENAGER

History
Jake is a 13-year-old boy referred to the A&E department by his GP with a sudden
change in behaviour. The previous day he complained of tiredness, but had been playing
a lot of football with his friends and training at a club. He watched television during the
evening and apparently slept well. The morning of the admission he had been quieter
than usual but had gone to school. His mother was phoned to say that his behaviour was
very out of character; he was refusing to obey commands and looked ‘spaced out’. At
home Jake seemed unable to perform simple tasks such as changing his clothes, putting
on his pyjamas rather than his shorts. He then became rather jumpy and nervous. He
denies any headache and there have been no abnormal movements witnessed. He has
had no diarrhoea or vomiting. Jake has no significant past medical history. His older
brother has epilepsy, which is well controlled with lamotrigine. Jake struggles at school,
needing extra help with literacy and maths. There were some minor behaviour problems
in his junior school but nothing since.
Examination
Jake looks generally well. His height is on the 91st centile and his weight is on the 75th
centile. He is afebrile. His pulse is 88 beats/min and his blood pressure is 110/75 mmHg.
Examination of the cardiovascular, respiratory and abdominal systems is unremarkable.
There is no meningism. When asked, he does not know the day of the week, which town
the hospital is in, or his birthday. He cannot remember the name of his favourite football club. He becomes agitated and aggressive when being questioned and is very slow
to answer. Both pupils appear dilated and have a slightly sluggish response to light. He
is uncooperative with attempts at fundoscopy. There are no obvious focal neurological
signs but he cannot understand the instructions for the tests of cerebellar function, e.g.
finger–nose test. His gait is normal.
Questions
• What further history should you specifically obtain?
• What other investigations would you request and why?

273

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 93
This previously healthy teenage boy has developed an acute confusional state. One of
the most obvious causes is drug ingestion, either recreational or a deliberate overdose,
possibly with his brother’s lamotrigine. It is important to ask the family specific questions. Has he been out of their sight? Are there any other drugs in the house? If necessary, send them home to check and make sure none are missing. Phone the school and
his friends. All these steps could be life-saving. A urine screen for ‘drugs of abuse’ and
toxicology, including lamotrigine, should be requested but the result will take some time.
However, never jump to conclusions – there are numerous other possibilities. With
an acute history, metabolic problems are unlikely although they must be excluded.
Hyponatraemia could be due to inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion following
an unreported head injury. Hypercalcaemia and renal failure are likely to have a more
insidious onset and other symptoms, such as tiredness. Thyroid disease is a possibility. Thyrotoxicosis can present with an isolated behaviour disturbance such as school
phobia. At this age, a previously undiagnosed inborn error of metabolism is unlikely but
is certainly possible, especially in a child with learning difficulties. Measure blood sugar
(bedside and laboratory), a venous pH, lactate and ammonia. Keep urine for amino and
organic acid analysis. Ask the laboratory to keep any spare blood in case it is needed for
future analysis. Most will do so for up to 6 months.
Even in the absence of clinical signs, bacterial and viral infections are possible diagnoses. They are also treatable. Send a full blood count, C-reactive protein, blood cultures, a midstream urine and acute viral titres. If indicated, convalescent titres can be
sent 10–14 days later. It is safest to start treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g.
cefotaxime, and aciclovir. A lumbar puncture is currently contraindicated because he is
very confused and raised intracranial pressure cannot be excluded. It may be indicated
once he has improved.
An acute neurological event must also be excluded, including seizures and migraine. He
merits an urgent CT and/or a MRI scan and an EEG.
This boy’s EEG the following day showed generalized bursts of spike and slow-wave
activity with a frontotemporal emphasis. He recovered within 24 hours but went on
to have further similar episodes of confusion, culminating in a generalized seizure.
The final diagnosis was complex partial epilepsy with secondary generalization. He
responded very well to anticonvulsants.

KEY POINTS

• Do everything possible to identify any drug that a child might have taken
inadvertently or deliberately. It might save their life.

• Never assume that an acute confusional state is due to drug ingestion at any age.

275

100 Cases Paediatrics

ANSWER 94
The airway of any child with a GCS of 8 or less is at risk. An anaesthetist should be
called urgently to monitor the airway and breathing. A blood gas may help the assessment. Most children in this setting will manage without being intubated and slowly,
spontaneously recover.
A cranial computed tomography (CT) scan should be done. There is very little history.
Although there are no external marks of a head injury or focal neurological signs, it
is possible that Laura sustained a head injury when she fell on the pavement and that
this partly accounts for her low GCS. The vomiting is probably secondary to the alcohol
ingestion but may be secondary to a head injury.
Maintenance intravenous fluids (5 per cent dextrose/0.45 per cent saline) should be
administered to help avoid the hangover headache that is primarily due to dehydration.
Hourly GCS observations should be performed.
Binge-drinking is very common in teenagers. It is important to try to find out the child’s
name and contact their family as soon as possible. Social services should be contacted to
inform them of what has happened and to find out if she is known to them. When she is
awake it would be worth asking whether she takes recreational drugs and consider doing
urine toxicology, if appropriate. One should also ask about the possibility of sexual abuse
whilst she was drunk and unconscious. However, if there are no allegations of sexual
abuse and no evidence to suggest it (e.g. missing or torn knickers) then this need not be
pursued. If there are concerns about the possibility of sexual abuse, a forensic medical
examiner should be contacted to do the necessary examination and to take the necessary forensic swabs. There is an association between alcohol abuse, behavioural disorders
and depression. In some cases, psychiatric and/or social work input and follow-up is
required.

KEY POINTS

• Binge-drinking is very common in adolescents.
• In drunken teenagers, always measure the blood glucose level.
• In children with a diminished GCS, a cranial CT should be done to rule out the
possibility of a coexisting intracranial injury.

• Remember to consider the psychosocial aspects of the case.

AN UNUSUAL APPETITE

History
Amy is a 3-year-old girl brought to the GP by her mother. Her health visitor has discussed her previously in the surgery and has been trying to persuade Amy’s mother to
attend. She is worried about Amy’s behaviour, although Amy’s mother laughs it off and
thinks that it is just a phase she is going through. Amy has a long-standing habit of
licking and chewing objects such as toys, and picking plaster and paint off walls and
eating it. This will happen anywhere, including paint from shop windows. As a toddler
she also used to eat mud and stones but this has recently reduced. Her mother reports
some complaints of tummy ache and constipation but is otherwise not worried about her
daughter.
Examination
Amy immediately starts exploring the surgery climbing onto the couch and windowsill
before the GP stops her. She tips out the waste bin and starts to rummage through the
contents and nibble paper towels. She also turns the taps on and off, splashing water
over the floor. Her mother seems oblivious to all this and is seeking a letter about rehousing. From time to time during the consultation, Amy comes to the GP and reaches
out to be picked up and sits on her knee for a while being cuddled. The GP notices that
Amy’s fingers, nails and clothes are dirty and she has head lice. The health visitor has
been monitoring her height and weight, and although her weight has been following the
2nd centile and her height is just above it, she is below the target range for her parents
(25th–75th). On examination she is anaemic and looks thin but there are no other signs.

• What complications have arisen?
• What is the management?

277

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 95
Amy has pica, the repeated or chronic ingestion of non-nutritive substances. This is
almost universal in infants and toddlers but abnormal after the age of 2 years and needs
investigation.
It is very unusual for a child to spontaneously reach out to a relatively unknown adult
for comfort. This behaviour should always raise the possibility of emotional and social
neglect and these are known predisposing factors for pica. Others include autism and
learning difficulties and the GP needs to ensure that there is no significant developmental
delay. Her social behaviour is not typical of autism. The difficulty persuading the mother
to attend, her indifference to the problem and her behaviour during the consultation all
add to the concerns. Amy is also small for her family and thin. Emotional and physical
neglect can lead to psychosocial dwarfism. A full social history should be gathered about
the family and their circumstances. Who else is at home? Does the mother have a partner
and is he the father of Amy? Is there a history of drug or alcohol abuse or domestic violence? Are there other children? Is this family known to Social Care?
Anaemia and lead poisoning have developed. The microcytic, hypochromic anaemia is
strongly indicative of iron deficiency, which is common in childhood and almost always
dietary in origin. It is even more common in pica. Basophilic stippling is characteristic of
lead poisoning, another known complication of pica. Sources include lead-containing paint
from both buildings and imported painted toys. Symptoms range from colicky abdominal
pain and constipation to headache, drowsiness, fits and coma in lead encephalopathy. Once
in the intestine, lead competes with iron and calcium for binding sites, so if either or both
of these are deficient, lead absorption is enhanced. Hyperactivity, as in this case, is frequently a manifestation of lead poisoning in pre-school and young school-aged children.
The management of this child has two components, medical and psychosocial:

• Medical management
– urgent referral to hospital
– exclude other causes for poor growth and weight gain, e.g. coeliac disease
– measure blood lead and seek advice from the National Poisons Information Service
about the need for chelating agents
– check blood ferritin and a haemoglobinopathy screen and give a 3-month course
of iron
– measure bone biochemistry and vitamin D and consider treatment with vitamin D
or a multivitamin preparation to minimize lead absorption
• Psychosocial management
– referral to Social Care for a multidisciplinary assessment of the whole family
– try to establish the source of lead and remove it or restrict access to it – involve the
Health Protection Agency
– likely to need referral to Child and Family Therapy service for behaviour management.

KEY POINTS

• Exclude lead poisoning in any child with a history of pica.
• In lead poisoning, investigate and treat any coexisting calcium and iron deficiency to
minimize lead absorption.

• Emotional and social neglect are known predisposing factors for pica.

CASE 96:

A SUDDEN COLLAPSE

History
Gregory is a 5-year-old boy who has been brought to the A&E department by ambulance
after a friend’s parent dialled 999. While at their son’s birthday party he complained of
tummy ache, started vomiting and then had profuse watery diarrhoea. He also became
acutely wheezy and was struggling to breathe. His voice became hoarse and he was
obviously scared. The ambulance crew report that when they arrived he was barely conscious, had severe stridor and markedly increased work of breathing. He is known to have
asthma and eczema, both reasonably well controlled. His parents report that he had cow’s
milk intolerance as a toddler, with vomiting and poor weight gain, and develops urticaria
if he eats eggs. However, he has never had anything like this before.
Examination
Gregory is sitting up on the trolley with a salbutamol nebulizer in progress. There is
obvious stridor with tracheal tug. His work of breathing is increased with subcostal and
intercostal recession and he is using his accessory muscles of respiration. He is quiet
but can say his name. His oxygen saturation is 92 per cent. His pulse is 160/min and
his capillary refill time is 4 s. His heart sounds are normal. There is widespread expiratory wheeze. Abdominal examination is normal. He is flushed and his lips and face are
swollen. He has widespread urticaria.
Questions
• The ambulance crew gave him life-saving drug treatment. What was it?
• How would you continue his immediate management?
• Once he has recovered, what investigations would you undertake?

279

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 96
Gregory has had an acute anaphylactic reaction – presumably to something he ate at
the party. The emergency drug treatment of anaphylactic shock is intramuscular 1/1000
(1 mg/mL) adrenaline (see Table 96.1). All health care professionals involved in procedures that could cause anaphylaxis, e.g. practice nurses giving immunizations, are trained
to give this as first line. They do not need to wait for a doctor’s prescription.

The management of acute anaphylaxis is essentially ‘ABC’ – airway, breathing, circulation.
Oxygen should be administered at all times. The stridor is evidence of upper airway obstruction and the wheeze indicates lower airway obstruction. If the stridor and respiratory distress
are severe, he should receive nebulized adrenaline, repeated if necessary. If the stridor does
not improve, the anaesthetist should be called. In severe cases, an ENT surgeon will also
be required. Intravenous hydrocortisone will also help the stridor and wheezing but may
take a few hours to work. Nebulized salbutamol should be continued as necessary to treat
the acute bronchoconstriction. He is flushed and has urticaria and is therefore peripherally
vasodilated. His capillary refill time is prolonged. His blood pressure should be measured. He
should receive a 20 mL/kg bolus of intravenous 0.9 per cent saline plus a dose of antihistamine, e.g. chlorpheniramine.
Once he is stable, further history should be obtained to try and identify the culprit food.
Skin-prick tests and/or total IgE and RAST (radioallergosorbent test) to specific foods should
be requested (but these need to be done a week or more after the last administration of an
antihistamine or steroid). Peanuts and nuts are hidden in many foodstuffs and would be high
on the list. Lifelong exclusion is required but inadvertent ingestion is a risk. He will need to
have available at all times a pack for self (or carer) administration of intramuscular adrenaline from a pre-assembled syringe and needle, e.g. Epipen. Most importantly his family need
advance instruction on how to use it. They should also have a supply of oral antihistamine.
If he is found to be allergic to a specific food he will need referral to a dietician for specialist advice. Self-administered adrenaline is indicated for all those with a definite history
of anaphylaxis and in children with asthma on inhaled steroids who have less severe reactions because they are at greater risk of anaphylaxis. Routine prescription for all children
with a history of a peanut or nut allergy is controversial. Mild reactions to foodstuffs are
very common and avoidance is the key.
KEY POINT

• Intramuscular adrenaline is the first-line treatment for acute anaphylaxis.

A PREGNANT

14-YEAR-OLD

History
Anna is a 14-year-old girl who presents to her GP worried that she may be pregnant.
She started her periods at the age of 11 and they have been pretty regular, but she has
now missed two and has been suffering from nausea most mornings. She met a 19-yearold man called Ryan at a party 6 months ago and they have been seeing each other
since, mainly at his flat which he shares with three other people, but occasionally at
her house when her parents are at work. She remembers a night a couple of months ago
when she and Ryan had had a few drinks and the condom slipped off. They thought it
would be fine. He works as a chef and she has been playing truant and missing school
if he is working in the evening. Up until now she has been doing well at school, but she
anticipates that her grades will slip this year.
Ryan is not her first sexual partner and she has always relied on condoms as she is worried that the contraceptive pill will make her put on weight. Anna has not told her family
about Ryan knowing that they will disapprove. She has no significant past medical history.
Unfortunately, Ryan is also a smoker and she has started smoking cigarettes. She denies
taking any other recreational drugs. Anna is adamant that she does not want the baby and
is equally adamant that she does not want to involve her parents or Ryan in any decision
about a termination. None of them knows she is seeing the GP.

Examination
Anna is generally healthy. There is nothing abnormal to find on examination and the
uterus is not palpable.

INVESTIGATIONS
Urine -human chorionic gonadotrophin is positive.

Questions
• Where does the GP stand legally regarding Anna and Ryan’s relationship?
• May Anna make up her own mind about a termination?

281

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 97
Ryan has broken the Sexual Offences Act (2003) by having sexual intercourse with a
young person under 16 years. However, the Act aims to reduce sexual exploitation and
abuse of children and young people, not to criminalize normal adolescent behaviour. If
all young people known to be sexually active were reported to the police, they would
probably be less likely to access contraceptive and sexual health services, leaving them
more vulnerable to unintended pregnancy and other health risks. Under the Act, all
those under 16 have the right to confidential advice, and the person offering it, medical
or non-medical, is not guilty of any offence, provided they are protecting the child’s
physical and/or emotional well-being.
The key words are ‘exploitation’ and ‘abuse’, and in the rare event of these being present,
the patient must understand that absolute confidentiality cannot be guaranteed. To
determine whether a relationship presents a risk that needs referral to Social Care and/or
police, the GP needs to consider:

• whether the young person is competent to understand and consent to the sexual
•
•
•
•
•
•

activity – according to the Act, children under 13 are not and anyone involved in
penetrative sex can be convicted of rape
power imbalances through differences in size, age and development – even 16 and
17-year-olds cannot give informed consent if the perpetrator is in a position of trust,
such as a teacher or youth worker
whether there was aggression, manipulation or bribery including the use of drugs
and/or alcohol
attempts to secure unreasonable secrecy
whether the partner is known by agencies to have worrying relationships with other
young people
evidence of parental neglect or lack of supervision in a child under 13
whether the relationship involves behaviours considered to be ‘grooming’ in the
context of sexual exploitation.

From Anna’s history there are no obvious legal or safeguarding children’s anxieties
about her relationship with Ryan, although it is far from ideal. Therefore the GP does
not have to report it to anyone.
In UK law the legal age of consent to medical treatment is 16 years. There is a legal precedent for younger children to give valid consent provided they fulfil approved criteria. To
be ‘Gillick’ competent they must demonstrate sufficient maturity and intelligence (capacity)
to understand the nature and implications of the proposed treatment, including the risks
and alternatives, and the consequences of not having it.
This means that Anna could have a termination without her parents’ (or her boyfriend’s)
knowledge, although she should be actively encouraged to tell them.
Note that a child is not considered to have the capacity to refuse investigation or treatment against the judgment of their parents or doctors. A 15-year-old cannot refuse
blood tests or treatment, although every effort should be made to understand their fears
and wishes.

282

Miscellaneous
KEY POINTS

• All children under 16 years have the right to confidential sexual health advice.
• Only where there is evidence of exploitation or abuse should cases of underage sex
be referred to Social Care and/or police.

• Young people can, under specific circumstances, consent to treatment independently
of their parents but they should always be encouraged to involve them.

A SUDDEN, UNEXPECTED DEATH

History
Zara is a 4-month-old infant who is brought to the A&E department and taken straight
to the resuscitation bay. Her parents say that they had gone to bed with Zara lying in
the bed between them and when they woke up she was blue, not breathing and lifeless.
She had been generally well the previous day but had not fed as well as usual. Zara was
born at 32 weeks gestation, weighing 1.90 kg, and had been in the special care baby unit
for 5 weeks. She had required oxygen for 2 days and had been nasogastrically fed for 3
weeks. The parents are not consanguineous and Zara is their first child.
The ambulance crew state that the baby was not breathing and asystolic when they
arrived. Zara has had basic life support during the 10-min journey to the hospital.

Examination
There is no respiratory rate and no air entry. Oxygen saturation is unrecordable. There is
no heart rate and a flat ECG trace. The baby is limp and unresponsive, with a temperature of 35.8C.

Investigations need to be wide ranging, looking into possibilities such as sepsis, metabolic disease and poisoning. A bedside glucose measurement should be done immediately. It is not always possible to get sufficient blood and urine for all the tests:

• Blood tests: full blood count, urea and electrolytes, bone chemistry, liver function
tests, glucose, C-reactive protein, blood gas, blood culture, ammonia, lactate, amino
acids, toxicology, cross-match
• Urine tests: microscopy, culture and sensitivity, amino acids, organic acids,
toxicology
• Nasopharyngeal aspirate for virology and bacteriology.
• Chest X-ray and any other imaging as indicated.
The likely outcome is death. Cardiac arrest in children is rarely due to cardiac disease and is usually secondary to hypoxia  acidosis due to a respiratory illness, e.g.
bronchiolitis.
Schindler et al. (N Engl J Med 1996; 335: 1473–9) published data on the outcome of
out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrests. It showed that the absence of any response
after 20 min of full hospital resuscitation resulted in 100 per cent mortality. It is conventional to resuscitate infants in hospital for 30 min. An overly prolonged resuscitation can
result in the survival of an infant with very severe neurological damage. Rarely, following drowning or poisoning, resuscitation for longer than 30 min is necessary.
If the child does not survive, the parents need to be talked to sensitively and told that all
sudden unexpected deaths in infancy (SUDI, the new name for the sudden infant death
syndrome which was previously also known as cot death) are referred to the coroner and
that the baby by law requires a postmortem. The parents also need to be told that it is
possible that no cause will be found for the death. They should be told that the police
286

Miscellaneous

will be automatically informed. The child protection register should be checked. Most
hospitals have a list of people who need to be informed after an infant has died, e.g.
general practitioner.
The family need to be followed up to discuss the results of the postmortem. Bereavement
counselling should also be offered.

KEY POINTS

• Cardiac arrest in children is usually secondary to hypoxia due to respiratory disease.
• Following an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, lack of a response after 20 min of hospital
resuscitation almost invariably results in death.

• All cases of SUDI require a referral to the coroner and a postmortem.

CASE 99:

A TIRED TEENAGER

History
Charlotte is 14 years old. She is referred to the paediatric outpatient department by her
GP. Over the last 6 months she has been complaining of feeling tired all the time, she
has a sore throat, headaches, pains in her arms, legs and abdomen, and feels weak. She
has not been to school for the last 6 weeks because she can’t manage the walk to the bus
stop and now she needs her mother’s assistance to walk around her house. The referral
letter says that they have attended the GP’s surgery five times over this period, and the
mother is very anxious about what is causing this. The GP did some blood tests and says
that a full blood count, renal and liver function tests were normal.
Further history reveals that this all started with a sore throat and fever for a few days.
From then on, she started to get headaches, worse in the evening, and became weak
and lethargic. She seemed to get worse each week, until she was hardly doing anything
herself, staying in bed or watching television. Despite sleeping a lot, she doesn’t feel
refreshed after sleeping. Her mother has to help her to shower and dress, as she feels so
weak. She aches all over and finds it very hard to concentrate on anything. Her periods
have become irregular.
Charlotte was getting top grades at school before all this and wants to be a doctor. She
enjoys school and denies any bullying. She lives with her mother and stepfather. She
has always been very reliant on her mother. Her sister was successfully treated for acute
lymphoblastic leukaemia 3 years ago. Charlotte has never been in hospital before and
usually does swimming team training five times per week.
Her mother is very worried that this could be something sinister and she has looked on
the internet and thinks it could be a brain tumour or thyroid problem. She is upset that
the GP hasn’t taken it seriously and only did blood tests because she made a fuss.

Examination
Charlotte is rather quiet, but will participate in conversation when prompted. Her weight
is 45 kg (25th centile) and her height is 164 cm (75th centile). Otherwise, physical examination is unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• Would you request any more investigations?
• What is the prognosis?

289

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 99
The most likely diagnosis is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This condition is also
known as myalgic encephalopathy (ME), but the term CFS is now preferred. The cause
of this condition is unknown. The diagnosis requires persistent fatigue disrupting daily
life for 6 months, associated with typical symptoms and no underlying cause found by
routine investigation. Typical symptoms include malaise, headache, nausea, sore throat,
painful lymph nodes, myalgia, abdominal pain, poor sleep and poor concentration.
Teenagers are more often affected than younger children.
This girl’s personality, social and emotional background are probably predisposing factors. It is necessary to exclude organic pathology early on, and to demonstrate that the
symptoms are being taken seriously. At the same time it is important to indicate from
the start that CFS could be the cause of all these symptoms. Thorough physical examination should include lying and standing heart rates and blood pressure, neurological
assessment and examination for lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, tonsil abnormalities and sinusitis. Investigations should rule out active infection, inflammation,
endocrine problems and malignancy. When headache is prominent, it may be necessary
to perform an MRI scan of the brain to exclude a space-occupying lesion.

!

Recommended investigations in patients suspected to have CFS
Full blood count and blood film
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and
C-reactive protein
Urea, creatinine
Glucose and electrolytes
Creatine kinase
Liver function
Thyroid function
Urine dipstick
Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) serology

May indicate:
Anaemia/leukaemia
Inflammatory/infectious cause
Renal disease
Endocrine disease, e.g. Addison’s
Myositis
Hepatitis
Hypothyroidism
Diabetes mellitus, renal disease
Current EBV infection

Prognosis is quite variable and although two-thirds of patients make a full recovery, this
may take 3–4 years. A multidisciplinary approach is often required. Management begins
with assessment of baseline function using an activity diary. Supportive treatment can
be aimed at alleviating symptoms, improving nutrition and sleep patterns and preventing over-exertion. A graded programme of return to activity is often instituted once
a stable baseline has been achieved. Support from physiotherapy, occupational therapy
and child and adolescent mental health services may also be needed. Occasionally inpatient management is required for investigation, evaluation and planning of treatment.
In this case, Charlotte was admitted to the paediatric ward for about 4 weeks, initially
for investigation, and then for some intensive assessment by physiotherapists, occupational therapists and child and adolescent mental health services. It was difficult to
make Charlotte and her mother accept the diagnosis of CFS. She was discharged after
her baseline activity level had been established and a programme of rehabilitation had
been planned. She had regular follow-up to support her in achieving her goals. After
290

Miscellaneous

18 months she has returned to about 60 per cent of her previous activity levels, and
continues to make slow progress. She has dropped back 1 year at school, but now manages to attend most of her lessons.

KEY POINTS

• Chronic fatigue syndrome can be a debilitating condition requiring a
multidisciplinary approach.

• Chronic fatigue and associated features should have been present for at least 6
months.

• Other medical causes of the same symptoms should be excluded.

CASE 100:

POOR WEIGHT GAIN

History
Charlie is a 14-month-old boy who is referred by his GP to the paediatric day unit
because of diarrhoea and weight loss. He has had numerous previous admissions. Charlie
was born at 32 weeks after a pregnancy complicated by recurrent bleeding. He needed
headbox oxygen for 5 days. By discharge home at 6 weeks, he was bottle-fed and his
weight was on the 25th centile. Over the next 2 months he had several admissions with
possible apnoeas, but investigations including an EEG and brain MRI were normal and
none were witnessed during observation on the ward. At 4 months he had two episodes
of haematemesis confirmed on inspection of the towels his mother brought with her
and had a normal full blood count, clotting screen and barium meal. His weight by then
had dropped to the 2nd centile and it has not been above it since, and has occasionally
fallen to below the 0.4th centile.
He has persistent, frequent, loose stools often containing visible blood. A diagnosis of
cow’s milk protein intolerance was made, but a dairy-free diet made no difference. He is
now on a hydrolysated (pre-digested) formula. Solids were introduced at 5 months.
During his admissions the nurses have fed him and report that he is always hungry
and takes good amounts, but there has been no significant weight gain. Charlie has had
extensive normal investigations, including an abdominal ultrasound, small bowel biopsy
and a colonoscopy, when no blood was seen. There are no concerns about his development. His 4-year-old brother was also investigated for poor weight gain. With the
permission of the parents, reports have been obtained from the tertiary centre to which
the 4-year-old was referred – he, too, had exhaustive tests but no diagnosis was ever
made. His growth chart shows a rapid improvement in weight gain from about 2 years.
Charlie’s mother is a pharmacy technician and his father is a lorry driver. The staff know
them well and his mother is always happy to stay.

Examination
Charlie looks skinny. He has redundant skin folds over his thighs and buttocks. His
weight is just below the 0.4th centile, and his length and head circumference are on the
50th centiles. He is not clubbed and not clinically anaemic. His pulse is 180 beats/min.
Examination is otherwise unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the most likely diagnosis?
• What could be the mechanisms contributing to Charlie’s history and current clinical
state?
• What should happen next?

293

100 Cases in Paediatrics

ANSWER 100
Charlie has had several unexplained episodes of potentially serious illness and now has
evidence of ongoing faltering weight gain with blood in his stools but not at colonoscopy. Exhaustive investigations are normal. This is on the background of being born
preterm after a complicated pregnancy and having an older brother who had a similar
pattern of illness in the first 2 years of life. This is all highly consistent with a diagnosis
of fabricated or induced illness (FII), an uncommon and difficult to diagnose form of
child abuse. The perpetrator may:

• fabricate a medical history
• cause symptoms by repeatedly exposing the child to a toxin, medication, infectious
agent or physical trauma, including smothering

• alter laboratory samples or temperature measurements.
The mother is almost always responsible and a significant percentage have connections
with the health services. Sadly the disturbed parent seems to obtain a perverse satisfaction from the close association with hospital care and staff. The possible mechanisms in
this case include the blood in the vomit and stools being his mother’s, possibly even her
menstrual blood. Specimens can be analysed for ‘foreign’ blood. The vaginal bleeding
during pregnancy may have been self-induced. The apnoeas could have many explanations and covert surveillance by the police may be needed if episodes are ongoing and
smothering is a possibility. Faltering weight gain means that energy expenditure exceeds
energy intake. Possibilities include diluting his feeds, throwing feeds away or poisoning
with laxatives or an agent that increases metabolic rate such as thyroxine – to which
this mother, as a pharmacy technician, would have access. This possibility is supported
by his tachycardia. Thyrotoxicosis is extraordinarily rare in this age group and thyroid
function tests may be normal if doses are not given every day. Some mothers become
highly sophisticated at FII – and this mother may have had prior experience with her
older boy. A phone call to the GP may reveal a history of abuse during the mother’s
childhood or prior mental health problems, but these do not mean that this is FII. It is all
supportive, not diagnostic, evidence.
However, it is crucial to make the diagnosis because this disorder can be very damaging
to the child, not just from the impact of the unnecessary and invasive investigations but
because of long-term behavioural and other problems. Other children may also be at
risk. The case must be referred to Social Care, who have a statutory duty to undertake a
thorough investigation according to strict guidelines. The child protection register should
be checked and the health visitor should be contacted for further information. At the
same time, it is worth obtaining a second opinion from another consultant paediatrician.

KEY POINTS

• Fabricated and induced illness should be considered in any child with recurrent
unexplained symptoms, but it may be difficult to diagnose.

• All potential cases of fabricated and induced illness must be referred to Social Care.

CHAPTER 1

Ageing

The ageing person
There are many differences between old and young people. In only some
cases are these changes due to true ageing, ie due to changes in the
characteristic(s) compared with when the person was young.

Changes not due to ageing
• Selective survival. Genetic, psychological, lifestyle, and environmental
factors inﬂuence survival, and certain characteristics will therefore be
over-represented in older people
• Differential challenge. Systems and services (health, ﬁnance, transport,
retail) are often designed and managed in ways that make them more
accessible to young people. The greater challenge presented to older
people has manifold effects (eg impaired access to health services)
• Cohort effects. Societies change, and during the twentieth century,
change has been rapid in most cases. Young and old have therefore been
exposed to very different physical, social, and cultural environments

Changes due to ageing
• Primary ageing. Usually due to interactions between genetic (intrinsic,
‘nature’) and environmental (extrinsic, ‘nurture’) factors. Examples
include lung cancer in susceptible individuals who smoke, hypertension
in susceptible individuals with high salt intake, and diabetes in those
with a ‘thrifty genotype’ who adopt a more proﬂigate lifestyle
• Additionally there are genes which inﬂuence more general,
cellular ageing processes. Only now are speciﬁc genetic disease
susceptibilities being identiﬁed, offering the potential to intervene
early and to modify risk
• Secondary ageing. Adaptation to changes of primary ageing. These are
commonly behavioural, eg reduction or cessation of driving as reaction
times increase

Ageing and senescence
Differences between old and young people are thus heterogeneous, and
individual effects may be viewed as:
• Beneﬁcial (eg increased experiential learning, increased peak bone
mineral density (reﬂecting the active youth of older people))
• Neutral (eg greying of hair, pastime preferences)
• Disadvantageous (eg decreased reaction time, development of
hypertension)
However, the bulk of changes, especially in late middle and older age, are
detrimental, especially in meeting pathological and environmental challenges. This loss of adaptability results from homeostatic mechanisms that
are less prompt, less precise, and less potent than they once were. The
result is death rates that increase exponentially with age, from a nadir
around age 12. In very old age (80–100 years), some tailing off of the
rate of increase is seen, perhaps due to selective survival, but the increase
continues nonetheless.

THEORIES OF AGEING

Theories of ageing
With few exceptions, all animals age, manifesting as increased mortality
and a ﬁnite lifespan. Theories of ageing abound, and over 300 diverse theories exist. Few stand up to careful scrutiny, and none has been conﬁrmed
as deﬁnitely playing a major role. Four examples follow.

Oxidative damage
Reactive oxygen species fail to be mopped up by antioxidative defences
and damage key molecules, including DNA. Damage builds up until key
metabolic processes are impaired and cells die.
Despite evidence from in vitro and epidemiological studies supporting
beneﬁcial effects of antioxidants (eg vitamins C and E), clinical trial results
have been disappointing.

Abnormal control of cell mitosis
For most cell lines, the number of times that cell division can occur is
limited (the ‘Hayﬂick limit’). Senescent cells may predominate in tissues
without signiﬁcant replicative potential such as cornea and skin. The
number of past divisions may be ‘memorized’ by a functional ‘clock’—
DNA repeat sequences (telomeres) shorten until further division ceases.
In other cells, division may continue uncontrolled, resulting in hyperplasia
and pathologies as diverse as atherosclerosis and prostatic hyperplasia.

Protein modiﬁcation
Changes include oxidation, phosphorylation, and glycation (non-enzymatic
addition of sugars). Complex glycosylated molecules are the ﬁnal result
of multiple sugar–protein interactions, resulting in a structurally and functionally abnormal protein molecule.

Wear and tear
There is no doubt that physical damage plays a part in ageing of some
structures, especially skin, bone, and teeth, but this is far from a universal
explanation of ageing.

Ageing and evolution
In many cases, theories are consistent with the view that ageing is a byproduct of genetic selection: favoured genes are those that enhance
reproductive ﬁtness in earlier life but which may have later detrimental
effects. For example, a gene that enhances oxidative phosphorylation may
increase a mammal’s speed or stamina, while increasing the cumulative
burden of oxidative damage that usually manifests much later.
Many genes appear to inﬂuence ageing; in concert with differential
environmental exposures, these result in extreme phenotypic heterogeneity,
ie people age at different rates and in different ways.

CHAPTER 1

Ageing

Demographics: life expectancy
• Life expectancy (average age at death) in the developed world has
been rising since accurate records began and continues to rise linearly
• Lifespan (maximum possible attainable age) is thought to be around
120 years. It is determined by human biology and has not changed
• Population ageing is not just a minor statistical observation but a
dramatic change that is easily observed in only a few generations
• In 2002, life expectancy at birth for women born in the UK was
81 years, and 76 years for men
• This contrasts with 49 and 45 years, respectively, at the end of the
nineteenth century
• Although worldwide rises in life expectancy at birth are mainly
explained by reductions in perinatal mortality, there is also a clear
prolongation of later life in the UK as shown by calculations of life
expectancy at 50 or 65 (see Fig. 1.1)
• Between 1981 and 2002, life expectancy at age 50 increased by
4.5 years for men and 3 years for women
• While projections suggest this trend will continue, it is possible that
the modern epidemic of obesity might slow or reverse this

Individualized life expectancy estimates
Simple analysis of population statistics reveals that mean male life expectancy is 76 years. However, this is not helpful when counselling an 80 year
old. Table 1.1 demonstrates that as a person gets older their individual life
expectancy actually increases. This has relevance in deciding on healthcare
interventions.

CHAPTER 1

Ageing

Demographics: population age
structure
Fertility
Fertility is deﬁned as the number of live births per adult female. It is currently around 1.9 in the UK. If this rate were maintained, then in the long
term population would fall unless ‘topped up’ by net immigration. In contrast during the ‘baby boom’ years of the 1950s, fertility rates reached
almost 3. This bulge in the population pyramid will reach old age in 2010–
2030, increasing the burden on health and social services.

Deaths and cause of death
The driver of mortality decline has changed over the twentieth century,
from reductions in infant/child mortality to reductions in old age mortality.
• Infant mortality accounted for 25% of deaths in 1901, but had fallen to
4% of deaths by 1950. Currently over 96% of deaths occur >45 years
• Deaths at age 75 and over comprised 12% of all deaths in 1901, 39% in
1951, and 65% in 2001
The most common cause of death in people aged 50–64 is cancer (lung
in men, breast cancer in women); 39% of male and 53% of female deaths
are due to cancer. Over the age of 65, circulatory diseases (heart attacks
and stroke) are the most common cause of death. Pneumonia as a cause
of death also increases with age to account for 1 in 10 among those aged
85 and over.
All these statistics rely on the accuracy of death certiﬁcation (see b
‘Documentation after death’, p.648) which is likely to reduce with
increasing age.

Population ‘pyramids’
These demonstrate the age/sex structure of different populations. The
shape is determined by fertility and death rates. ‘Pyramids’ from developing nations (and the UK in the past) have a wide base (high fertility
but also high death rates, especially in childhood) and triangular tops
(very small numbers of older people). In the developed world the shape
has become more squared off (see Fig. 1.2) with some countries having
an inverted pyramidal shape—people in their middle years outnumber
younger people—as fertility declines below replacement values for
prolonged periods.

CHAPTER 1

Ageing

Demographics: ageing and illness
Healthy life expectancy and prevalence of morbidity
Healthy life expectancy is that expected to be spent in good or fairly good
health. As total life expectancy rises it is better for society and the individual to spend as much of this extended life in good health as possible.
It is not known whether ‘compression of morbidity’—where illness
and disability is squeezed into shorter periods at the end of life—can
be achieved. Trends in data from USA suggest that compression of
morbidity is occurring, but challenges to public health are different in the
UK. Obesity and lack of exercise may negate diminishing morbidity from
infectious diseases; as more people survive vascular deaths they might
develop dementia (and other old age-associated diseases). The jury is still
out; some data gathered in the UK using self-rated health measures show
that in 1981 the expected time lived in poor health was 6.5 years (men)
and 10.1 years (women); by 2001 this was 8.6 and 10.7 years.

Social impact of ageing population
Those >80 are the fastest growing age group in UK. Currently around
a quarter of the population is >60 years old but by 2030 this will rise to
a third. Governments can encourage migration (economic migrants are
mostly young) and extend working lives (eg increase pensionable age for
women) but these will have little effect on the overall shift. The impact
of this demographic shift on society’s attitudes and economies is huge.
Examples include:
• Financing pensions and health services—in most countries these are
ﬁnanced on a ‘pay-as-you-go’ system, so will have to be paid for by a
smaller workforce. This will inevitably mean greater levels of taxation
for those in work or a reduction in the state pension. Unless private
pension investment (which works on an ‘insurance’ system of personal
savings) improves there is a risk that many pensioners will continue to
live in relative poverty
• Healthcare and disability services—the prevalence and degree of
disability increases with age. American Medicare calculations show that
more than a quarter of healthcare expenditure is on the last year of a
person’s life, with half of that during the last 60 days
• Families are more likely to be supporting older members
• Retired people comprise a growing market and companies/industries
that accommodate the needs/wishes of older people will ﬂourish
• Transport, housing, and infrastructure must be built or adapted
• Political power of older people (the ‘grey lobby’ in America) will grow

DEMOGRAPHICS: AGEING AND ILLNESS

Successful versus unsuccessful ageing
How can success be deﬁned, ie towards what aim should public health
and clinical medicine be striving? The following deﬁnitions are to some
extent stereotypical and culture-sensitive. More ﬂexible deﬁnitions
would acknowledge individual preferences.
• Successful ageing. Without overt disease, with good physical
and cognitive function, a high level of independence and active
engagement with broader society. Usually ended by a peaceful death
without a prolonged dying phase
• Unsuccessful ageing. Accelerated by overt disease, leading to frailty,
poor functional status, a high level of dependence, social and societal
withdrawal, and a more prolonged dying phase where life quality may
be judged unacceptable

CHAPTER 1

Ageing

Illness in older people
One of the paradoxes of medical care of the older person is that the
frequency of some presentations (‘off legs’, delirium . . .) and of some
diagnoses (infection, dehydration . . .) encourages the belief that medical
management is straightforward, and that investigation and treatment
may satisfactorily be inexpensive and low skill (and thus intellectually
unrewarding for the staff involved).
However, the objective reality is the reverse. Diagnosis is frequently
more challenging, and the therapeutic pathway less clear and more
littered with obstacles. However, choose the right path, and the results
(both patient-centred and societal (costs of care etc.)) are substantial.

Features of illness in older people
• Present atypically and non-speciﬁcally
• Cause greater morbidity and mortality
• May progress much more rapidly—a few hours delay in diagnosis of a
septic syndrome is much more likely to be fatal
• Health, social, and ﬁnancial sequelae. Failures of treatment may have
long-term wide-ranging effects (eg nursing home fees >£800/week)
• Co-pathology is common. For example, in the older patient with
pneumonia and recent atypical chest pain, make sure myocardial
infarction (MI) is excluded (sepsis precipitates a hyperdynamic,
hypercoagulable state, increasing the risk of acute coronary syndromes;
and a proportion of atypical pain is cardiac in origin)
• Lack of physiological reserve. If physiological function is ‘borderline’
(in terms of impacting lifestyle, or precipitating symptoms), minor
deterioration may lead to signiﬁcant disability. Therefore, apparently
minor improvements may disproportionately reduce disability.
Identiﬁcation and correction of several minor disorders may yield
dramatic beneﬁts

Investigating older people
• Investigative procedures may be less well tolerated by older people.
Thus the investigative pathway is more complex, with decision-making
dependent on clinical presentation, sensitivity and speciﬁcity of test,
side effects and discomfort of the test, hazards of ‘blind’ treatment or
‘watchful waiting’ and of course the wishes of the patient
• Consider the signiﬁcance of positive results. Fever of unknown cause
is a common presentation, and urinalysis a mandatory investigation.
But what proportion of healthy, community-dwelling, older women
have asymptomatic bacteriuria and a positive dipstick? (A: around 30%,
depending on sample characteristics). Therefore in what proportion
of older people presenting with fever and a positive dipstick is urinary
tract infection (UTI) the signiﬁcant pathology? (A: much less than 100%)
The practical consequence of this is the under-treatment of non-urinary
sepsis.

ILLNESS IN OLDER PEOPLE

Treating disease in older people
When treating disease in older people, they:
• May beneﬁt more than younger people from ‘invasive’ treatments—
eg thrombolysis. On a superﬁcial level, think ‘which is more
important—saving 10% of the left ventricle (LV) of a patient with an
ejection fraction (EF) of 60% (perhaps a healthy 50 year old) or of a
patient with an EF of 30% (perhaps, an 80 year old with heart failure)?’.
Note that the signiﬁcant criterion here is more the LVEF than the
age, the principle being that infarcting a poor LV may cause long-term
distress, morbidity, and mortality, whereas infarcting a part of a healthy
myocardium may be without sequelae
• May beneﬁt less than younger people. Life expectancy and the balance
of risks and beneﬁts must be considered in decision-making. For
example, the priority is unlikely to be control of hypertension in a frail
95 year old who is prone to falls
• May have more side effects to therapies. In coronary care: B-blockade,
aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, thrombolysis
and heparin may all have a greater life (and quality-of-life)-saving effect
in older patients. Studies show these agents are underused in MI
patients of all ages, but much more so in the elderly population.
The frequency of side effects (bradycardia and block, profound
hypotension, renal impairment and bleeding) is greater in older people,
although a signiﬁcant net beneﬁt remains
• May respond to treatment less immediately. Convalescence is slower,
and the doctor may not see the eventual outcome of his/her work
(the patient having been transferred to rehabilitation, for example)
• The natural history of many acute illnesses is recovery independent
of medical intervention, particularly in the young. Beware false
attributions and denials of beneﬁt:
• The older person frequently beneﬁts from therapy, unwitnessed by
medical staff
• The younger person recovers independent of medical efforts,
though his/her recovery is falsely attributed to those interventions
(by staff and patient)

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Using geriatric services
Geriatric services have developed rapidly since the inception of the
specialty in the 1950s. They have different forms, depending on local
resources, experts, and enthusiasts. Every district will offer different services, each with a different spectrum of options. There are some broader
national differences within the UK; services in Scotland and Northern
Ireland lean more towards rehabilitation and long-term care than those in
England and Wales. The following is intended as a generic guide to utilizing
geriatric services in the UK. Diversity will limit applicability.

Services for acute problems
Urgent assessment of the acutely unwell patient, where the disease
process is new and severe (eg acute MI, stroke) or the deterioration is
rapid (eg delirium).
Examples:
• General practitioner (GP) emergency services (see b ‘Primary care’,
p.46)
• Emergency departments (EDs; see b ‘Acute services for older
people’, p.16)
• Acute medical admission service
• Rapid Access (admission avoidance) services (see b ‘Admission
avoidance schemes’, p.20)
• Urgent domiciliary visits (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Do a domiciliary visit’,
p.33)
Choosing which is most appropriate will depend on patient characteristics
(eg if unstable, then an ambulance to an ED is appropriate; if no change is
expected over a few days then urgent outpatient assessment may be used)
and local service characteristics (availability of urgent clinic slots etc).

Services for sub-acute problems
Assessment of a patient with a progressive disease process (eg increasing
falls, worsening Parkinson’s in a frail patient) or unexplained potentially
serious problems (eg iron deﬁciency anaemia, weight loss) or for diagnosis
and management plan (eg cardiac failure).
Examples:
• Routine outpatients
• Speciality clinics (see b ‘Specialty clinics’, p.24)
• Day hospital (see b ‘Day hospitals’, p.22)
• Intermediate care facilities (see b ‘Intermediate care’, p.26)
• Elective admission (to acute hospital, rehabilitation wards or
community hospital)
• Domiciliary visits (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Do a domiciliary visit’, p.33)
Again, choice of service will depend on patient factors. Single organ
problems can be referred to specialist clinics, less well-deﬁned medical
problems to a geriatric outpatients, and problems suggesting the need of
multidisciplinary input to the day hospital. Local availability, waiting times
and consultant interests will also affect choice—while most cardiologists
have chest pain clinics, not all will run heart failure services, which may be
provided by general physicians or geriatricians.

USING GERIATRIC SERVICES

Services for chronic problems
This includes active, elective management of slowly progressive conditions
by GPs, community teams, specialist nurses, and secondary care physicians
(see b ‘Chronic disease management’, p.44) and the provision of care for
established need.
Care may be provided by a number of means:
• Informal carers (see b ‘Informal carers’, p.40)
• Home care and care agencies (see b ‘Home care’, p.38)
• Day centres (see b ‘Other services’, p.42)
• Respite care (in care homes or hospitals) (see Box 2.1)
• Care homes (see b ‘Care homes’, p.34)
Allocation of these usually long-term services is generally after an assessment
of need and ﬁnancial status by a care manager.
Most patients will pass through many aspects of this care spectrum with
time, and a ﬂexible, reactive service with good communication between
providers is essential. The ﬂow diagram (Fig. 2.1) schematically represents
possible patient ﬂows through the system.

Fig. 2.1 An example of a comprehensive geriatric service.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Acute services for older people
Since older people present atypically, and are at high risk of serious
sequelae of illness, high-quality acute services that fully meet their needs
are essential. In any setting, older people have special needs. Their needs,
and the consequences of not meeting them, are ampliﬁed in the setting of
acute illness. Speciﬁc areas meriting attention include pressure area care,
prevention and treatment of delirium, and optimal nutrition and hydration. Accurate early and comprehensive diagnosis(es) is essential.
An acutely unwell older person may present to one of several services
depending on:
• Local service provision
• The individual's understanding of the system
• Advice from others (eg relatives, health professionals, NHS Direct)
Any service aiming to diagnose acute illness in older people must have
access to immediate plain radiography, electrocardiography (ECG), and
‘basic’ blood tests (including prompt results). Specialist clinical assessment
(geriatrician, urologist, neurologist, etc.) and more advanced diagnostics
(eg ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)) must be available on a prompt referral basis, although may be on
another site.

Emergency department (accident and emergency)
Older people present commonly to the ED with falls, fractures, ﬁts, and
faints, as well as a broad range of acute surgical and medical problems
traditionally referred directly by GPs to surgical or medical teams. Direct
referrals of such patients to ED are increasing, as a result of changes in
GP out-of-hours services, advice by agencies such as NHS Direct, and
changing public behaviour.
2The ED is potentially inhospitable and dangerous for older people.
The environment may be cold, uncomfortable, disorientating, and lacking
dignity and privacy. There is a risk of pressure sores developing due to
long waits on hard chairs and trolleys. Provision and administration of
food and ﬂuid may be neglected, or inappropriately prohibited on medical
grounds. A medical model of care may presume serious illness, prioritizing
immobility, invasive monitoring and treatments, at the expense of a more
holistic approach that appreciates the downside of these interventions.
Staff may be experts in emergency medical management, but their expertise in geriatric medicine and nursing is variable. Deadlines and targets that
minimize time spent in ED on trolleys (eg the 4hr wait rule) may well
beneﬁt older ED users.
Strategies to optimize care for older people in ED might include:
• Close liaison with geriatric medical and nursing specialists
• Medical and nursing rotation between ED and geriatric medical wards
• Focus on optimizing food and ﬂuid provision and pressure care
• Provision of alternative modes of admission and assessment, eg Rapid
Access Clinic, direct admission to geriatric ward
• Provision of specialist geriatric assessment unit
• Occupational therapist, physiotherapist, and social worker with
expertise in older people based in ED

THE OLDER PATIENT IN INTENSIVE CARE

The older patient in intensive care
With the aging population and a reduction in overt and covert ageism,
a greater proportion of intensive care unit (ITU) and high dependence
units (HDU) beds are occupied by older patients. However, they remain a
rarity with <3% of most ITU admissions in the UK for patients aged >85.
2Age alone is a weak predictor of outcome and should not be used as
the sole reason to deny ITU/HDU care. Frailty scores provide more accurate prognostic information. Patients with multiorgan failure especially in
the context of frailty will not do well on ITU.
Older patients with the following should be considered for ITU/HDU:
• Postoperative
• Septicaemia
• Post cardiac arrest/life-threatening arrhythmia
• Acute drug effects or overdose
• Intensive monitoring eg acute MI or stroke thrombolysis
• Ventilatory support, eg pneumonia or pulmonary oedema
If in doubt discuss your case with ITU physicians. Even where patients
are unsuitable for admission to ITU, the intensive care specialists and
their outreach team may be able to offer advice. The use of early warning
scores (EWS) (which are designed to detect patients in pre or periarrest situations) in parallel with escalation/trigger systems (to prompt
timely management decisions) is growing. This trend may well increase
the involvement of intensivists in the management of critically unwell frail
elderly people.
2Remember that older, frailer patients are more likely to refuse intensive treatment so always enquire, from the patient if possible, or the relatives about any advanced refusal of intensive treatment (see b ‘Advance
directives’, p.664).

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

The great integration debate
There has been a longstanding debate among UK geriatricians about the
best model of care for older people in hospital. Historically, age-related
care grew out of workhouse facilities and the advent of care provided
in mainstream institutions was a major step against ageism. The provision of age-related services on the same site and with equal facilities to
facilities developed. This deﬁed the label of ageism and professed other
advantages. Traditionally care has been divided into either ‘age-related’
or ‘integrated’ but there are many shades of grey in between these two
extremes, usually developing locally in response to manpower restraints,
ward availability, and the enthusiasm of individuals. The two ‘pure’ systems
may be described as follows:
• Age-related care. A separate team of admitting doctors to deal with
all patients over a certain age (varies—commonly around 75 years)
who then care for these patients on designated geriatric wards
• Integrated care, In truly integrated care, specialists will all maintain
additional generalist skills. These generalists will admit all medical
patients regardless of age and continue looking after them on general
medical wards, in parallel with specialist clinical commitments
(See Table 2.1 for advantages and disadvantages of each system.)
The debate has never been fuelled by any evidence (there are no
studies comparing systems) and it has become less fevered recently as the
reduction in junior doctors’ working hours has made it impractical in many
hospitals to run two entirely separate teams. As a result various hybrid
systems have grown up, managing patients pragmatically and sampling the
best aspects of both the systems.
A common compromise is that there is integrated acute assessment,
with a single admitting team, but rapid dispersal to the most appropriate
service—gastroenterology for a patient with acute gastrointestinal bleed,
cardiology for acute MI, and acute geriatric medicine for a confused elderly
patient etc. This dispersal may be done at a variety of levels and times,
again depending on local service strengths and constraints. Models include
triage of need (‘needs’ or ‘function’ related segregation) by an appropriate
person immediately after admission (admitting specialist registrar (SpR),
experienced nurse, bed-manager, etc.), dispersal by a ward allocation
system after removal from the admitting ward or over a period of a few
days (by inter-speciality referral) as the special needs become apparent.
As individual systems evolve, the debate recedes and energies are
invested into providing the best possible care for all patients through
innovation and ﬂexibility within a certain hospital structure, rather
than in drawing boundaries and maintaining rigid deﬁnitions. Vigilance
against ageism in these evolving systems remains essential.

THE GREAT INTEGRATION DEBATE

Table 2.1 Comparison of age-related and integrated care
Age-related care
Advantages

Potential drawbacks

All old people seen by doctors
with a special interest in their
care

Possibility of a two-tier standard of medical
care developing, with patients in geriatric
medicine settings having lower priority
and access to acute investigation and
management facilities

All old people looked after
on wards where there is a
multi-disciplinary team

Less specialist knowledge in those doctors
providing day-to-day care

Even apparently straightforward
problems in older patients are
likely to have social ramiﬁcations
that are proactively managed

May be stigmatizing for all patients of a
certain age to be deﬁned as ‘geriatric’
May be less kudos and respect for geriatric
medicine practitioners

Integrated care
Advantages

Potential drawbacks

As the majority of patients
coming to the hospital are
elderly, it maintains an
appropriate skill base and joint
responsibility for their care

Many generalists will not be skilled in the
management of older patients, so those
under their care may not fare as well

There is equal access to all acute
investigative and maintenance
facilities, as older patients are
not labelled as a separate group

Specialist commitments are likely to take
priority over the care of older patients

Trainees from all medical
specialties will have exposure
to and training in geriatric
medicine assessment

The multidisciplinary team input is harder to
coordinate effectively where the patients are
widely dispersed

Sharing of specialist knowledge is
more collaborative and informal

Management of the social consequences of
disease tends to be reactive (to crisis) rather
than proactive

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Admission avoidance schemes
Admission avoidance schemes (AAS) are very variable in content and
name. Schemes may be divided into those that do and do not offer specialist geriatric assessment (provided by a geriatrician, a GP with a special
interest, or a geriatric specialist nurse).

Non-medically based schemes
These may include emergency provision of carers, district nurse, occupational therapy and physiotherapy, delivering, eg, prompt functional assessment and increased care after a fall. As medical assessment is not a part of
the scheme, treatable illness may be missed. As a minimum such schemes
should incorporate assessments by healthcare professionals who can recognize the need for specialist geriatric assessment and can access such
services promptly.

Schemes with a medical assessment
• Variously titled Early Assessment, Rapid Assessment, Emergency or
Rapid Access clinics
• All aim to provide a prompt response to medical need in older people,
with acuity falling somewhere between immediate admission and more
elective outpatient services
• Few schemes aim to provide same-day assessment, most aiming to see
patients within 1 week of referral, and at best the next day
• There is an assumption that patients are midway between ﬁrst
symptoms and severe disease, and that early intervention may prevent
decline, permit less aggressive or invasive treatment, and permit the
patient to remain safely at home
• Services are best accessed via telephoned, faxed or electronic referral,
with prompt assessment of the content of and response to referrals by
an experienced professional
2There is a risk that acutely unwell older people who need emergency assessment or treatment are referred to AAS rather than admitted
immediately. If in doubt, admit to the emergency medical/geriatric medicine team. Delirium is an example of a presentation where admission to
hospital from home is usually required.
• In practice, most AAS do have to admit a modest proportion of
patients to hospital directly. In some cases this represents optimal care,
but in others it introduces a dangerous delay to a clinical situation
• AAS stafﬁng usually includes senior medical staff (± junior support).
Experienced nursing assistance is invaluable, perhaps in the form
of a nurse practitioner. Nursing roles are variable but may be very
extended, to include history taking and physical and mental state
examination
• Most commonly, AAS are housed in ‘general’ outpatient facilities.
Examples of problems managed here include anaemia or breathlessness
• A more comprehensive geriatric response (see b ‘Comprehensive
geriatric assessment’, p.70) is facilitated when AAS is housed in or
adjacent to outpatient multidisciplinary services, eg Day Hospital

ADMISSION AVOIDANCE SCHEMES

• AAS should have prompt (ideally same day) access to occupational and
physiotherapy services, to support the patient at home whilst the effect
of medical interventions become apparent. Patients with complex
needs are best managed in this environment, eg Parkinson's disease
with on/off periods

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Day hospitals
Day hospitals (DHs) provide services that lie somewhere between outpatients and inpatients. Patients stay for half or a full day and the primary aim
is to regain or improve independence for a group of frail elderly people
with complex needs.
The case mix and interventions vary widely between units but can
include:
• Medical—new patient assessments, eg for falls, weight loss, anaemia, as
well as chronic disease management, eg heart failure, parkinsonism
• Nursing—eg pressure sore and leg ulcer treatment
• Physiotherapy—eg following stroke, fracture, surgery
• Occupational therapy
• Diagnostics—facilities for usual blood tests, radiology, et. and also
speciﬁc therapeutic trials, eg levodopa
• Treatments—eg blood transfusions, intravenous furosemide infusions
A ﬂexible and holistic attitude is required and many DH clients will take
advantage of multiple different services in a ‘one-stop-shop’ approach.
There is usually a mixture of new patient assessments, rehabilitation, and
chronic disease management. Patients may be referred directly from the
community or from other outpatient settings or may be booked for a
follow-up after an inpatient stay. Some units have designated sessions for
speciﬁc patient types or services (eg movement disorder clinic, admission
avoidance clinic). Multidisciplinary teamwork and comprehensive geriatric assessment (see b ‘Comprehensive geriatric assessment’, p.70) and
functional goal setting are all important tools.

History and evolution
The ﬁrst DHs were set up in 1960s. In their heyday many units had collected a huge number of patients who were very frail but had little active
intervention and used their visits as social occasions or respite for carers.
Unacceptably long waiting lists hindered efﬁcient running in some units.
Transport problems often proved to be a weak point, with patients
spending lengthy periods of time waiting for, or during transport.
The monitoring/supporting role has now been largely taken over by day
centres (see b ‘Other services’, p.42) and modern DHs tend to have a
high ratio of new:old patients and a rapid turnover. Increasing pressure
on acute hospitals has opened up the role of rapid access admission
avoidance clinics and early supported discharge schemes. Intermediate
services development, following the national service framework (NSF),
has sometimes augmented services (eg falls services) and sometimes
denuded them (eg where outreach services have taken over).

DAY HOSPITALS

Cost effectiveness
Pressures to justify the expense of day hospital places led to a ﬂurry of
publications looking at effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. While this
area remains controversial a systematic review in 2008 found that DH
patients did have less functional deterioration, lower rates of institutionalization and hospital admission than control groups receiving no care.
However DHs did not prove superior to other comprehensive care services (eg domiciliary rehabilitation). DH care is costly but this may be offset
by decreased inpatient bed usage and institutionalization or social care
costs. It is very important to ensure this expensive resource is targeted
effectively and regularly evaluated to ensure cost-efﬁciency.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Specialty clinics
Every region will have different resources, but most will have some
specialty clinics run by geriatricians, by other specialists, or occasionally
combined clinics run by more than one specialty. Examples of clinics are
shown in Table 2.2. The advantages of specialty clinics are many:
• Usually simple referral protocol
• Concentration of expertise
• Increased training opportunity for juniors
• Often specialist nursing staff
• Increased patient education and awareness of the condition—through
meeting others with the same diagnosis, through the work of specialist
nurses and through the availability of information leaﬂets
• May utilize a rapid access investigation slot on a regular basis (eg carotid
Doppler ultrasound in transient ischaemic attack (TIA) clinics)
• Increased use of protocols (may improve quality of care)
• Often rapid turnover
Where the same clinic is offered by different specialties, or where you are
unsure if a referral to a geriatrician or an organ specialist is most appropriate,
ask the following:
• Is this a new or urgent problem? There are an increasing number of
clinics with a protocol-deﬁned maximum waiting time for the urgent
assessment of patients. These may prevent admissions and allow
rapid outpatient management of many conditions (eg TIA, chest
pain, possible malignancy) but are prone to being overwhelmed with
referrals thereby rendering them less responsive to the needs of the
truly urgent cases. Non-urgent cases should be referred to standard
outpatient clinics
• Is the diagnosis likely to be clear-cut? A ﬁt patient with cardiac sounding
chest pain should go to a cardiology-run clinic, as they will have the
fastest access to the appropriate expertise and investigations. If the
pain is more nebulous, then waiting for a chest pain clinic appointment
only to be given the diagnosis ‘non-cardiac chest pain’ is unhelpful. Such
a patient is better seen in a more general (usually geriatric) clinic
• Does this patient have a single problem? If so, then they are likely to do
well in a clinic run by an organ specialist. If, however, they are frail, with
multiple pathologies then a geriatric clinic may be better. Here there
is time to for example, undress the patient properly, and assess them
fully as the allocation time per new patient is likely to be longer. There
is also less likely to be a protocol driven response to a single problem
without looking at the wider picture (eg prescription of multiple
medications for angina in a patient prone to falls)
• Is this patient already attending a geriatric clinic for follow-up? If so, most
new problems can be addressed by that team rather than referring to
another specialty

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Intermediate care
There is no universally acknowledged deﬁnition of ‘intermediate care’. It
is used to describe almost any sort of care which lies between an acute
inpatient stay and usual primary care. The term ﬁrst came into general
use in 2001 after the NSF described it as a major strategy for improving
healthcare and the UK government promised to invest £900 million over
5 years to implement it. In many instances this led to a re-badging of
existing services but there were also an assortment of new and often
innovative approaches.
While many geriatricians welcomed the emphasis on non-hospital-based
geriatric medicine others have warned against intermediate care being a
covert form of ageism which allows rationing of acute hospital medicine in
favour of less expensive and often less effective care.
Intermediate care is for patients who do not ﬁt into either acute or
chronic/stable categories, although these overlap. The emphasis of
intermediate care tends to be not primarily medical but multidisciplinary
and holistic. There are two main bodies of patients:
• Those requiring rehabilitation, re-housing, or both in a post-acute
illness setting—usually recruited from acute wards—‘step-down’ care
• Community dwelling patients who require nursing/therapy input,
often following an acute or subacute deterioration, in order to avoid a
hospital stay—‘step-up’ care or admission-avoidance
The arrangement of intermediate care teams has been developed locally
and varies enormously in stafﬁng, facilities, ethos, and access. Some
projects concentrate on very speciﬁc groups (eg post-surgical fractured
neck of femur in the >70 year olds) while others are more generic. Most
regions have several complementary services. Examples of popular models
are:
• Discharge coordinating teams—nurse, therapy or social work teams that
bridge the interface between hospital and community based services.
They often act as gatekeepers for rehabilitation/community beds or
supported discharge schemes
• Hospital-at-home schemes—where intensive nursing and/or therapy
input in the patients home can allow a patient to receive treatment
without the need for admission to hospital or be discharged earlier
• Front door teams—that recruit elderly patients from accident and
emergency and assessment wards to improve assessment (eg provide
an occupational therapy (OT)/physio assessment following a fall) and
to make referrals to other services such as social workers, clinics, etc.
• Purchase of care home beds—often with multidisciplinary or social
worker input often for step-down of patients awaiting social care
provision or care home placement
Intermediate care can occur in different environments, eg:
• Nursing outside the acute care setting in traditional community/cottage
hospitals, nursing homes, or even residential homes
• Patient’s own home
• DH or other therapy-based sites

INTERMEDIATE CARE

Interventions in intermediate care are often based around a comprehensive
geriatric assessment (see b ‘Comprehensive geriatric assessment’, p.70)
by a multidisciplinary team. However, more specialized services can be provided by individuals or teams that are missing some vital members (particularly medical or social work) and care is needed that important interventions
(such as treatable illnesses or unclaimed beneﬁts) are not overlooked.
The variety of different models makes it very hard to promote equity
of access or research into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the
service. While it has been shown possible to provide almost all kinds of
geriatric care in a community setting this does not necessarily mean that
it is more effective, cost-efﬁcient, or even preferable for patient, family,
and staff. Research designed to answer these questions is sparse and
contradictory.

Single assessment process
This term was introduced in the NSF for older people. The idea is a
simple one—‘multidisciplinary, interagency assessment of needs ensuring
that the elderly receive the relevant services, in an integrated way’. The
main aim was to avoid professionals duplicating their assessments, eg
when a patient moves between hospital and community settings. The
initial milestone for introducing single assessment process (SAP) was
April 2004.
Unfortunately the assessment systems at the heart of health and social
security proved much more resistant to change than was anticipated.
Geographical variations in systems, distrust between different agencies,
as well as antiquated technology, has meant that the SAP currently
exists only as multiple pilot schemes throughout the UK.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

The National Service Framework for
Older People
This huge document (over 200 pages) was published by the Department
of Health in March 2001. It was one of the ﬁrst NSFs to be produced and
set out the government’s agenda to improve health and social services for
the elderly with milestones (ie deadlines for service changes) stretching
over the following 4 years. There are eight standards.

1 Rooting out age discrimination
‘NHS services will be provided, regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need
alone. Social care services will not use age in their eligibility criteria or policies
that restrict access to available services.’
This key standard was widely welcomed and has proved useful in audits
with the aim of removing explicit (written policy) ageism in, eg, access to
diagnostic services or treatments. Implicit ageism is harder to tackle.

2 Person-centred care
‘NHS and social services treat older people as individuals and enable them to
make choices about their own care.’
This incorporated the introduction of the Single Assessment Process
as well as some ideas about shared commissioning of care and equipment
between different government agencies. Many of the goal’s planned
reforms in this standard have had, at best, patchy implementation.

3 Intermediate care
‘Older people will have access to a new range of intermediate care services
at home or in designated care settings to promote their independence . . .
prevent unnecessary hospital admission and effective rehabilitation services to
enable early discharge . . . and prevent premature or unnecessary admission
to long-term residential care.’
This standard was accompanied by earmarked funding to develop
services and run 5000 new intermediate care beds. It was the most
controversial of the standards with many geriatricians arguing that
the result of such services would be reduced access to acute hospital
care—indeed one target relates to a reduction in the rate of rise of older
persons’ admissions.

4 General hospital care
‘. . . appropriate specialist care by hospital staff who have the right set of skills
to meet their needs.’
All hospitals should have a specialist multidisciplinary team for older
people with appropriate training.

5 Stroke
‘. . . action to prevent strokes . . . access to diagnostic services and treated
appropriately by a specialist stroke service . . . programme of secondary
prevention and rehabilitation.’
This standard has helped drive the development of stroke units
(required in all hospitals by 2004 although not fully achieved) and TIA
clinics.

THE NATIONAL SERVICE FRAMEWORK FOR OLDER PEOPLE

6 Falls
‘. . . action to prevent falls and reduce resultant fractures or other injuries.
Older people who have fallen receive effective treatment and . . . advice on
prevention through a specialist falls service.’
The development of falls services has lagged well behind the suggested
timeframe.

7 Mental health in older people
‘. . . access to integrated mental health services . . . To ensure effective diagnosis, treatment and support . . .’
Promotes integrated depression and dementia services.

8 The promotion of health and active life in older age
‘. . . through a co-ordinated programme of action led by the NHS with support
from councils.’
Targets related to ﬂu vaccination, smoking cessation and blood pressure
treatment etc are largely implemented in general practice where they are
reinforced by the new GP contract (Box 2.2).

Medicines and older people
An additional document on medicine and older people stated that older
people should:
‘. . . gain the maximum beneﬁt from medication . . . and not suffer
unnecessarily from illness caused by excessive, inappropriate or inadequate
consumption of medicines.’
It included a pharmacy-led ‘medicines review’ for at-risk elderly people.
As with many other NSFs, translating policy into change has been only
partially successful but there is no doubt that the older people’s health and
social services today have been inﬂuenced by this important document.
None of the other NSFs exclusively address the health of older people
but more recent documents, eg the NSF for long-term conditions (2005),
the NSF for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (2009), have
much of relevance to older people.
There have been a series of UK government regulation and inspection
bodies which use NSFs and other legal and quality standards as guides:
• Commission for Health Improvement (CHI): 2001–2004
• Commission for Health Care Audit and Inspection (CHAI): 2004–2009
• Care Quality Commission: 2009 to date

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Community hospitals
Community hospitals (CHs) vary in size, clinical focus, and facilities. In
some areas, they represent a substantial inpatient resource, with older
patients predominating both as inpatients and outpatients. Their origins
were commonly either as small ‘cottage’ hospitals or workhouses, providing very limited services from dated buildings. They are now undergoing
substantial change and reinvention as a less centralized focus of non-acute,
in- and outpatient, medical and rehabilitation services. Prompts to recent
change have included the GP contract (2004), the NSF (2001) (eg for falls
services) and additional funding for intermediate care. Locality-based services are also promoted as part of the NHS Plan (2001).
Often there is substantial community support, both emotional and
tangible (volunteers, gifts), for local hospitals. This makes service changes
politically sensitive, slow, and difﬁcult. In some cases, CH facilities are in
desperate need of reconﬁguration to reﬂect current service priorities.
Facilities may include:
• Inpatient beds for between 10 and 60 patients
• Physiotherapy and OT services (in- and outpatient)
• DH
• Ofﬁce/professional base for community-based care, rehabilitation, and
social services
• Outpatient medical facilities—easier access for frail elderly
• Psychogeriatric services, outpatient and/or inpatient
• Local health (eg primary care trust (PCT)) management base
• GP out-of-hours service base
• Minor injuries unit—often staffed by nurse specialists
• Maternity services—midwife ofﬁce base ± maternity beds
• Often a GP practice is based on site or close by, with mutual beneﬁts
• Limited diagnostic testing, eg blood tests, plain radiography. More
complex tests, eg CT and ultrasound, usually require transport to
another hospital
Medical cover is usually by GPs. In ‘cottage hospitals’ they admit patients
on their own practice list. In other ‘community’ hospitals a GP may be
employed as a clinical assistant. In some hospitals both patterns co-exist.
Visits should be both regular—identifying potential problems and planning
prospectively—and responsive to acute problems identiﬁed by nursing
staff.
Specialist medical input may be available, including a visiting community
geriatrician and psychogeriatrician. Other specialists, eg surgeons may
hold outpatient clinics on site.
Nurses and therapists are often very experienced in the care of older
people, and are able and willing to work more independently from
doctors. Nursing staff often lead the discharge planning process including
multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings. Staff turnover is often low, with a
high proportion of committed, long-term staff.

COMMUNITY HOSPITALS

Community hospitals admissions
Groups of patients being admitted include the following:
Rehabilitation and discharge planning
Often transferred from acute hospitals following surgery (elective or
emergency) or acute medical problems. Timing of transfer must be appropriate—is the patient medically stable, have relevant investigations been
completed?
Palliative care
Where the nature of illness is clear, and cure is not possible, CHs can
provide high-quality nursing care and symptom control when things can
no longer be managed in the patient's home. Preferable to admission to
acute hospitals. Hospice beds are often very limited, and hospice care
focuses on patients in whom symptom control is especially difﬁcult.
Respite care
Usually now performed out of hospital, in care homes. Some especially
complex, or emergency/unplanned respite care may occur.
Acute illness or functional decline
• In general, this should be discouraged because illness in older people
is often occult and atypical. Diagnosis is easier and more precise in an
acute general hospital with easy access to investigations and specialist
opinions. After accurate diagnosis and completion of invasive (eg
intravenous) treatments, transfer to a CH becomes appropriate
• Admission to CH may be justiﬁed in cases of strong informed patient
opinion, where the diagnosis is clear, where invasive treatments and
advanced monitoring are highly unlikely to be required, or when
logistics dictate (eg very long distances)
• Admission may also be appropriate after specialist assessment in a
Rapid Access Clinic or at a domiciliary visit
‘Social’ admissions
Where staff perceive that the precipitant to admission has been a change
in social supports (eg death or illness of a carer), not the condition of
the patient. Beware occult acute illness on admission, or later—these
patients are often very frail. High death rates in such admissions have been
reported.

Effectiveness/cost effectiveness
As with other forms of intermediate care, there is little evidence that CHs
provide improved outcomes or cheaper care than alternative systems.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Domiciliary (home) visits
A medical assessment in the home, usually by an experienced geriatrician.
This involves visiting the home of the ill person, sometimes alone, but
perhaps with a GP or carer. On occasion, a therapist or care manager may
also attend. Distinguish this ‘medical’ home visit from the home assessment visit performed by an OT to determine functional capacity and the
needs for aids/adaptations prior to discharge from hospital.
Historically, domiciliary visits (DVs) were widely used to prioritize
patients on the waiting list for admission to hospital, but with the
disappearance of such lists for acute medical problems this is now rarely
done.
There are advantages and disadvantages to medical assessments in the
home. The disadvantages, and an appreciation of how much elderly people
beneﬁt from selective use of modern, acute hospital facilities have led to
a substantial reduction in the number of visits performed. In many areas,
they now serve a function predominantly in those who refuse to attend
hospital and who appear seriously or terminally ill. They have also been
used by some as a method of routine, post-discharge follow-up. Although
expensive, the latter may be effective, and overlaps with emerging systems
of chronic disease management. They may also be used to assess suitability
for admission to non-acute settings, eg CHs.

Disadvantages
• Lack of equipment and other hospital facilities, eg diagnostic
• Lack of nursing support (chaperone, lifting/handling during clinical
examination)
• An inability to perform other than very basic tests
• An inefﬁcient use of time—as well as travelling time, patients and
family often expect longer discussions and they effectively control the
duration of the consultation

Advantages
• Provision of a second opinion for the primary care team, which may be
struggling to diagnose or treat, or need reassurance that it is doing all
that is possible
• Function may be rapidly and effectively assessed, eg is there evidence
of incontinence, is the larder stocked, is the dwelling acceptably clean,
what degree of mobility is achieved (through, eg ‘furniture walking’).
Are there appropriate aids and adaptations?
• Assessment of mental state may be more accurate in the patient's
home (confusion worsened in hospital setting)
• Assessment of drug compliance (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Improve
concordance’, p.132)
• Patients appear more frail and vulnerable in a hospital setting
• No travel for the patient
• Some patients adamantly refuse assessment in hospital. The experience
of the visit itself may persuade a reluctant patient to be admitted

DOMICILIARY (HOME) VISITS

HOW TO . . . Do a domiciliary visit
When?
• Combine with other trips if possible
• Not too early or late in the day (patient may rise late and settle
early)
Will you and your property be safe?
• Danger from patient, relatives/carers, neighbours?
• Tell someone where you are going, and when you should be back
What do you need to know before you go?
• Name, address, directions (especially in rural areas)
• Do you have a referral letter?
• Review and take any previous medical notes
• Can the patient’s family or carer attend? (One or two is useful—
discourage excessive numbers of family members)
• Will the patient be in? Telephone them in advance and consider
ringing again just before you are about to set off
What to take?
• Blood pressure (BP) cuff, stethoscope, tendon hammer, auroscope,
ophthalmoscope, ‘PR tray’ (jelly, gloves, wipes), urinalysis sticks
• Scoring charts (abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), Mini Mental
State Examination (MMSE), Barthel, Geriatric Depression Scale
(GDS))
• Paper and pen, dictation machine and cassette
What will you do?
• History, examination
• Functional assessment
• Environmental inspection
• Medication (check the drug cabinet or top drawer for over-the-counter
and prescription drugs)
• Accepting a cup of tea will inform in several areas
• Discuss your ﬁndings and plan with patient and family
What to do afterwards
• Telephone or fax GP to report ﬁndings and discuss plans
• Dictate letter, copy to GP and hospital notes
• Claim fee if applicable

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Care homes
This area of geriatric care is evolving rapidly with changes driven by
• Expansion of elderly population
• Reduced availability of informal carers (eg working women, smaller
families living further apart)
• Closure of many council-owned homes (previously known as Part III
homes)
• Closure of many privately owned homes (uneconomic at levels of
current state funding, especially in view of recent legislation)
• Care home legislation
• Shortage of staff—both nurses and untrained carers
Until recently there was a clear division between residential homes
(providing hotel-style services and some basic personal care such as help
washing/dressing to mobile patients) and nursing homes (providing full
nursing to very dependent, often bed-bound patients). This distinction
was always arbitrary and as patients’ care needs ﬂuctuated or steadily
increased with time, they found themselves inappropriately housed. There
is now a move towards establishments under the wider term ‘care homes’,
which provide services for the full range of dependencies.

Stafﬁng
Most of the care provided in care homes is by unskilled staff (or those
with basic NVQ training), who nonetheless may have extensive experience. The quality of care is a key issue for clients and their relative in
selecting a home but it is very variable and difﬁcult to judge from the
outside. In homes providing nursing care there has to be a trained nurse
available on site at all times.

Care home medicine
Medical care is usually provided by one or more GPs from a local practice
(clients are rarely able to keep their own GP). Some community geriatricians
routinely visit care homes in their area to provide support and education.
Attention should be paid to try to minimize sedative medication, maximize
preventive interventions (eg ‘ﬂu jabs, osteoporosis prophylaxis) and where
possible to involve patients in advance care planning (eg decisions about
future hospitalization, living wills).

Care homes for patients with dementia
Elderly mentally inﬁrm (EMI) homes are registered to take patients with
signiﬁcant dementia who may have behaviour problems such as aggression, anti-social behaviour or wandering. These homes are in particularly
short supply. Eligibility for such homes may need to be determined by a
psychogeriatrician. They have specially trained staff and often have secure
entrances. Some ordinary homes are not registered to take patients with
a diagnosis of dementia and decline to do so although many patients in
ordinary homes will have a degree of cognitive impairment.

CARE HOMES

HOW TO . . . Advise a patient about residential care
This task is of grave importance; there are implications for the patient’s
independence, quality of life and ﬁnances and it tends to be a one-way
move. Ensure that the patient has had a full assessment (ideally a specialized, geriatric, multidisciplinary one (see b ‘Comprehensive geriatric assessment’, p.70) at a point of maximized health and functioning
(ie not during an intercurrent illness or emergency). It is unwise to make
recommendations based on only your own impression or those of the
family—an OT or social worker can be very helpful. Ensure that the
patient has had an adequate trial of rehabilitation. Consider the prognosis of underlying conditions—you would be more likely to recommend residential care with deteriorating health.
Some patients (often with normal cognition, living alone) may choose
to go into care and are grateful for help with arrangements. They often
describe loneliness/isolation or fear. If they are functionally independent
ensure that sheltered housing or day centre attendance have been
considered—the majority of care home residents are cognitively
impaired clients who may not provide the company they seek. Most
patients do not want to go into care because of:
• Negative ‘workhouse’ preconceptions of what care homes are like
• Emotional attachment to their spouses, homes, pets, neighbours
• A fear of loss of independence and dignity
• Anxiety over costs and loss of inheritance for family
• Stigmatisation and perception that they have failed
Patients with dementia may lack insight into their care needs (see b
‘HOW TO . . . Manage a patient insisting on returning home against
advice’, p.663). Many of the principles of breaking bad news apply, eg
‘warning shots’ will prepare the patient. Explain what factors make it
advisable to consider residential care and why other options are not
feasible—use factual examples (eg you need help during the night and
we cannot provide this at home). Clarify the contribution that other
professionals have made to this assessment. The following positive
points can be persuasive:
• By actively choosing a care home they are more likely to get one
they like. Leaving it until an emergency may remove any choice
• Placements are often on a trial basis initially with review at a month
• Emphasize the positive—company, hot meals, less anxiety for family
• Where placement is from home and is not urgent then a trial stay/
respite period of a week or two can sometimes be arranged
• Reassure there will be help with ﬁnancial/logistical arrangements
• Some care homes allow well-behaved pets
A privately owned house does not always have to be sold, eg if a family
member continues to live there

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Funding of care homes
Funding
• The cost of residential care in 2011 ranges from around £400 to £1100
a week depending on client dependency, local costs (eg house prices,
staff availability) and the quality and variety of facilities provided
• While in Scotland the state pays for all nursing and personal care, in
England and Wales fees are means-tested and calculated on a sliding
scale. In 2011 people with savings of more than £23,500 (including the
value of their home) have to pay the full cost
• Regardless of income, a small sum for certain kinds of nursing care is
provided by the state. Patients needing nursing care have an assessment
carried out by specially trained nurses in order to be categorized
into one of three bands which entitle then to some state funding (the
Registered Nursing Care Contribution—RNCC)
• Funding issues are addressed by a care manager (usually a social
worker, see b ‘Social work and care management’, p.98) using a
complex questionnaire
To complicate this system further a small number of highly dependent
patients (who would previously have been provided for in long-stay NHS
wards) are eligible for NHS continuing care. Examples of such patients
include those who require terminal care and those with ongoing complex
medical or psychiatric needs who require frequent specialist medical or
nursing intervention. Patients eligible for continuing care have 100% of
their funding provided by the state regardless of their own ﬁnancial status.
The provision of continuing care has been very inconsistent between
health authorities and the health service ombudsman has admitted that
tens of thousands of residents have been denied the free care they are
entitled to. The assessment systems are still regionally developed and
administered. A review of funding is planned by the current (2011) UK
government (see M www.direct.gov.uk for updates).

The national care home standards (M www.dh.gov.uk)
These were published following the Care Standards Act in 2000 and
deﬁne minimum standards. There is guidance about all aspects of care, eg
care planning, documentation and complaints procedures as well as speciﬁc requirements about facilities (eg all doors 80cm wide, ratio 1 assisted
bath/8 residents) and minimum stafﬁng ratios. While these regulations
have improved some facilities they have also forced many smaller homes
out of business.

DELAYED DISCHARGE

Delayed discharge
While some patients are admitted directly from their home to a care
home in a planned move, the majority are admitted following an acute
illness. This often occurs via a hospital setting, eg a patient who has a
stroke and does not regain sufﬁcient function to return home after rehabilitation. Where patients are held in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals after they no longer require hospital treatment while awaiting care
home beds they are sometimes called ‘bed blockers’. Whilst most geriatricians dislike this stigmatizing term (delayed discharge is better) there
is no doubt that such patients cost the NHS millions of pounds a year
and reduce the availability of hospital beds for patients that would beneﬁt
more. Delays in placement are due to one or more of the following:
• Shortage in care home places, especially for EMI homes. Availability
varies according to region but stems from ﬁnancial and stafﬁng shortfall
• Overworked social workers may prioritize urgent cases from the
community over hospital cases (who are perceived as being in a ‘place
of safety’), which can lead to delays in assessment and processing
• Social services that are short of cash may ‘ration’ the number of new
care home places they fund to try to limit costs. Some NHS trusts
charge social services for such delayed discharges—this system (called
reimbursement or cross-charging) was designed to improve discharge
rates but creates more paperwork and has had a patchy impact
• Patients/relatives may oppose discharge because they are unwilling to
accept that there is no further capacity to recover and return home
• Patients/relatives may be reluctant to move from free NHS care to
means-tested care because of ﬁnancial implications

Role of doctors caring for delayed discharge patients
• Ensure that it is clear to everyone (including the patient and relatives)
that the patient is no longer requiring acute hospital care. Record
‘medically ﬁt for discharge’ in the notes and document follow-up
arrangements for outstanding problems
• Continue medical monitoring—Switch to ‘care home medicine’
priorities but remember that these frail patients are prone to new or
recurrent illnesses and are at risk from hospital-acquired infections
• Actively drive discharge—communication is key, eg case conferences
and MDT meetings
• Consider interim options—the patient may be able to wait in an
intermediate care facility such as community hospital or ‘transitional’
bed in a private care home arranged by social services

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Home care
In most countries the majority of people needing personal care remain at
home rather than moving into an institution (eg care home). Their needs
are provided by (a) carer(s) who may be a spouse or other family member,
informal carers or professional carers (self-employed, or employed by a
private care agency or public body). In the UK, the care needs of a patient
are usually speciﬁed by a care manager (social services) and then delivered by private and/or state care agencies.

Community care assessment (‘needs assessment’)
This is the process whereby a care manager determines the needs of a disabled person and how they can be met. Assessing need requires information from the patient and others, often including relatives, OT, physio, and
nurse. Meeting those needs requires agreement between care manager
and client (patient, or next-of-kin/legal representative if the client is not
competent) after considering the options, ﬁnances etc.
Delivery of care
• The bulk of care is delivered by care assistants, who should have basic
training in delivering personal care, and lifting/handling
• In speciﬁc cases they may be trained further to deliver care that is
usually the domain of the district nursing team, eg bowel care
• The work is poorly paid (at or close to the minimum wage), but may be
very satisfying. Long term friendships may develop, with a commitment
to patient welfare that goes beyond the strict conﬁnes of a contract
• Carers perform important supervision of patients, and are often the
ﬁrst to note the possibility of illness
Continuity of care is an important contributor to quality, and is highly
desirable, but not always achievable. There is a risk of physical, emotional,
or ﬁnancial abuse by carers (see b ‘Elder abuse’, p.674), although such
cases are uncommon.
In the UK, there is a national shortage of carers, worse in some
geographical areas. This can delay discharge or at worst prevent it. It also
renders existing care packages vulnerable to unexpected carer absence,
eg due to sickness. Care packages provided by combinations of care
agencies may therefore be more stable than those provided by only one.
Tasks routinely performed by carers
• Washing, bathing, dressing
• Safe moving and handling including hoists
• Feeding, meal preparation, and housework
• Supervision of self-medication from dosette box
• Emptying of urinary catheter, ﬁtting of penile sheath catheter
• Bowel care if trained
Tasks not usually performed by carers
• Dressings
• Administration of medications from individual containers
• Insulin injections
• Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding

HOME CARE

Home care costs
• In the UK, state support for care fees is ‘means tested’—a ﬁnancial
assessment is performed by the care manager. Criteria vary locally, but
in general only those with no signiﬁcant savings have the costs of care
met by the state
• Purchasing personal care is expensive. In the UK care costs about £20
per hour. A care package consisting of 2hr daily would therefore cost
around £300 per week—less expensive than a care home, but still a
major ﬁnancial burden for those who meet the fees themselves
Structuring the care package
• Tailor to the individual. A package usually consists of between one and
four visits per day, by one or two carers. A common pattern is for two
visits daily, one early (wash, dress, toilet, food preparation) and one
late (evening meal, ready for bed). Lunch may consist of a pre-prepared
meal, frozen and simply reheated by the patient, removing the need
for a midday visit. Two carers are needed for ‘double-handed care’,
eg turning or transferring a dependent patient
• Night-time visits are rarely needed, and difﬁcult to provide reliably.
Roles may include toileting, pressure care (turns) or administering
medication, but there may be other solutions (eg other continence
management, changing medication regimens)
• Continuous (‘24hr’) care is sometimes requested by patients or family,
but close to impossible to provide—sufﬁcient staff are difﬁcult to
ﬁnd, and the care would be extremely expensive; a move into a care
home would usually be cheaper. Therefore these packages are usually
privately funded. Live-in carers are sometimes employed long-term,
but cannot be on hand the whole 24hr, need holidays, and may go sick
unpredictably
• Access to the home by carers can be difﬁcult if the patient is immobile
and cannot get to the door. Combination locks or a key safe
(conventional key locked within small combination—or key-accessed
safe) provide a secure solution
• Equipment may be necessary before a patient can be discharged and a
care package initiated, eg, hoist, bed, chair, cushion. OTs usually assess
need and provide

Commonly reported problems with care packages
• Timing—unpredictable, or too early or late (eg 6pm visit to prepare
for bed)
• Carers—variable quality, lack of continuity
• Cost—often a signiﬁcant issue. Costs discourage some patients from
taking an adequate (or any) care package, and may result in it being
stopped after a period
• Visits—may be brief; carer and patient feels rushed
The Care Quality Commission (M www.cqc.org.uk) inspects and deals
with complaints about social care providers. National Minimum Standards
must be met if a care agency is to gain and retain a licence.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Informal carers
This term describes anyone who provides regular and substantive care
to a person on a non-professional basis, usually without ﬁnancial reward.
This is often a family member, but may also be a friend or neighbour.
• 1 in 10 adults in the UK will provide informal care to another person
• A total of 6 million people acted as carers in 2003, and this is projected
to rise to 9 million by 2037
• Carers main beneﬁt is worth (in 2004) £44 per week, for an average of
35hr caring—just £1.26/hr—saving the economy £57 billion per year
• 12% of the >65s act as a carer, a third for >50hr a week
• The health of carers themselves is poor—44% have poor health,
compared with 30% of non-carers. The more demanding the caregiver
role, the more likely the carer is to experience ill health
This vital group of individuals maintain many elderly patients in the community and are the backbone of the care system. For many, having an
informal carer is the only way of staying at home. A patient with cognitive problems (especially if mobile) may require constant supervision to
ensure safety—a level of care that can only be provided by an informal
live-in carer (often a spouse). This level of care will often exceed that
which can be provided in a care home, leading to dissatisfaction when
patients are temporarily or permanently admitted to institutional care.
The importance of this group is recognized in the government’s national
strategy Caring about Carers (2009), which aims to improve information
and support to carers and improve the care they themselves receive. This
includes the right of a carer to a ‘carer’s assessment’, carried out by social
services, which addresses the following points:
• Is the carer getting enough sleep?
• Is the carer in good health?
• Does the carer have time for themselves?
• Are relationships adversely affected by the care giving?
• Are there concerns about work?
• Is the carer collecting all available beneﬁts?
• Is all available help being provided (services include emotional support,
help with household and caring tasks, accessing beneﬁts and local
activities, arranging respite care—see Box 2.1)
Support for carers is essential—caring can be relentless, unrewarding
and often depressing. Elder abuse is a rare but possible consequence
of this highly stressful situation (see b ‘Elder abuse’, p.674). As well as
government resources, a number of charity and self-help organizations
also provide support and practical help.

INFORMAL CARERS

Box 2.1 Respite care
Acting as a carer can be exhausting (both physically and mentally) for
the carer and often the patient who may ﬁnd accepting so much help
from a loved one difﬁcult. Part of any successful care ‘package’ is sustainability, which includes ensuring that everyone has a break from time to
time. Some of the charities listed in the text (eg Crossroads) will offer
a carer support worker to take over the caring role for a few hours at a
time, but a longer break may well be needed.
In such situations, respite care in a residential establishment may
provide the solution. Many care homes, particularly those in the
independent sector are able to provide extremely ﬂexible respite care
packages. These can range from a 2-week visit (eg to cover a holiday), to
day care or even an overnight stay. A regular arrangement can be made,
where, eg, 1 week on every eight is spent in residential care.
Most local authorities operate a discretionary policy in terms of paying
for respite care in care homes, and may fund several weeks a year of
respite to help sustain a care arrangement. This is means tested.
NHS respite is rare these days, but does still exist. Patients with
psychiatric needs will often have respite on psychogeriatric wards.
Long-standing arrangements on community hospital wards and long-stay
wards (becoming increasingly rare) may persist. Terminal care patients
will often be offered respite care in hospices or community hospital
wards. These services are free to the patient.

Other services
Day centres
• Traditionally run by health and social services but now increasingly run
by voluntary organizations (eg British Red Cross, Age Concern)
• Accessed via social services, (who assess need) or by self-referral
• Offer regular visits (eg once or twice a week) with transport if needed
• There is a charge that varies with requirements (eg transport, meals)
• Vary enormously, but may include:
• Catering (eg coffee, tea and lunch)
• Social support network
• Personal care (eg bathing facilities, hairdressing etc.)
• Respite for carers
• Skills development (arts and crafts, adult learning classes)
• Access to services (eg podiatry, district nurse)
• Leisure activities (eg quizzes, reminiscence, music, gardening, keep
ﬁt, trips out)
• Enables monitoring of progressive conditions (eg dementia) and
early referral for extra support to prevent crisis
• Rehabilitation and independent living skills (may occasionally have
OT, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy (or therapist)
(SALT) input)
Day centres differ from DHs (see Table 2.3). Attendance is usually long
term and cognitive impairment is more common.

Social clubs
Many different types that vary from county to county. Usually run by voluntary organizations. Information on locally available clubs can be obtained
from libraries, the local county council or Age Concern. They include:
• Lunch clubs (often with transport)—meet up for a hot midday meal
• Bingo clubs
• Tea dances
• Keep ﬁt groups
• Special interest groups (eg all-male, all-female, ethnic groups, hobby
groups—gardening, model railways, etc.)

Befriending
Scheme run primarily by Age Concern, providing lonely, isolated older
people with a regular volunteer visitor who will sit and chat and help with
minor jobs such as fetching library books, etc.

Pet schemes
Volunteers bring pets to visit people who can no longer keep them, eg in
care homes.

Holiday support
Voluntary organizations can provide information on suitable holidays for
the disabled, and some will offer ﬁnancial assistance.

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Chronic disease management
• Around 60% of the adult population has a chronic condition
(commonly asthma, diabetes, hypertension, and cardiac failure), and
older people make up the bulk of this group
• Multiple chronic diseases lead to increasingly complex healthcare needs
and are a particular phenomenon among elderly people, who become
increasingly frail with the accumulation of chronic problems
• Most of this pathology is managed in primary care, but it impacts
frequently on secondary care—10% of the population (who have
chronic disease) account for 55% of inpatient days
There has been a shift in UK political emphasis away from acute sector
targets, towards the proactive management of chronic disease—referred
to as ‘long-term conditions’. Lessons have been learned from so-called
‘managed care organizations’ (such as Kaiser Permante in California) in the
USA, where comprehensive healthcare is provided to a deﬁned population. There are built-in incentives to actively manage chronic disease as
this substantially reduces acute expenditure.
There are a number of levels of chronic disease, summarized as
follows:
• Level 1—accounts for 70–80% of patients, who have a single chronic
disease (eg hypertension). Management is enhanced by increasing
personal responsibility for the condition with education and
encouraging active participation in care. Patient experts are developed
who take on some of the education of their peers
• Level 2—more complex patients, but still with commonly recognized
complications of disease (eg Parkinson’s disease). Management is at a
population level, with broad guidelines for care, protocols, and patient
pathways. The approach is multidisciplinary with innovative ways of
delivering a set standard of care (email, telephone, group meetings,
nurse clinics etc.)
• Level 3—highly complex patients with individual needs (eg frail elderly
patient with multiple interacting pathologies). Active case management
by a key worker (often a nurse) promotes early intervention to prevent
crisis and facilitates joined-up care
The emphasis is on proactive management, rather than a ‘ﬁre-ﬁghting’
approach. The 2005 NSF on long-term conditions is about chronic
neurological diseases, eg motor neuron disease (MND)/Parkinson’s but
much has wider applicability. Clinical nurse specialists often lie at the heart
of the management framework. Frail elderly patients, however, are less
predictable and so key workers need broader skills and are less able to
rely on protocols.
The following are useful ways of managing these patients:
• ‘Frailty registers’ to identify and risk stratify patients
• Use of information systems and shared patient records
• Specialist nurses, eg community matrons with close medical back-up
• Involving community MDTs, district nurses and health visitors
• Coordinated care—using care managers

CHRONIC DISEASE MANAGEMENT

• Increased liaison between primary and secondary care with free and
frequent sharing of information and care goals, and easy access to
urgent clinical review (eg in urgent assessment clinics)
• GPs with a special interest in geriatrics
• Utilization of DH to monitor those most at risk of acute deterioration

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Primary care
• 90% of older people see their GP at least once a year
• Around 20% of general practice consultations are for elderly people
(who actually make up around 15% of the population)
• Consultations tend to be more complex than in younger patients
• Of these consultations, about a third will need a home visit, compared
with less than 10% of the general population—the trend for HV is
declining, but older people remain the biggest user group
• GPs tend to be aware of the health problems of their older patients—
those that do not attend tend to be healthy
• The most common consultations are for respiratory and
musculoskeletal problems (whereas secondary care sees more
complications of vascular disease such as ischaemic heart disease and
stroke)
• Half of the >65s are on a regular medication, and 17% are on three or
more—treatment is usually prescribed and monitored by the GP
Many older people have chronic conditions (such as arthritis, COPD,
diabetes etc.) and the day-to-day management is usually carried out by
GPs. Input from secondary care may come at a time of crisis (admission
to hospital, rapid referral clinics) or may be more structured in the case
of more complex chronic diseases, with regular clinic follow-up or day
hospital attendance. GPs act as a vital link between hospital and community services, identifying patients at particular risk of crisis so allowing
preventative action to be taken (a skill more intuitive than evidence based,
which comes with experience).
• Patients with multiple co-morbidities and/or extreme frailty may
beneﬁt from identiﬁcation (so-called ‘frailty registers’) and elective
review—a possible role for DHs, GPs with a special interest in
geriatrics, district nurses, health visitors or the new community
matrons
• GPs with a special interest in geriatrics can act as community
specialists, working with other MDT members and liaising with hospital
departments. They will often take the diploma in geriatric medicine
• GPs play a key role in the long-term management of risk factors for
disease—now highlighted by the 2004 GP contract (see Box 2.2)
• Inpatients in many community hospitals are looked after by GPs.
Primary care has been subject to much reform in the last decade
• In 2000, the UK government revealed the NHS Plan, which aimed to
modernize the structure, organization and delivery of healthcare
• In 2002, PCTs were created (each with responsibility for a population
of 100 000—375 000) and given resources and responsibilities to
improve the health of their local population. PCTs are overseen by
Strategic Health Authorities, that focus on long-term planning and
national priorities (eg NSF priorities—see b ‘The National Service
Framework for Older People’, p.28)
• The GP contract was introduced in 2004
• Further changes are planned by the current (2011) UK government

PRIMARY CARE

Box 2.2 The 2004 UK GP contract
This contract sets priorities for many GPs.
Payment points
Delivery of services is reimbursed via a system of payment points based
on achievements in certain clinical areas: coronary heart disease (CHD)—
including heart failure (121 points), stroke/TIA (31 points), hypertension
(105 points), diabetes (99 points), COPD (45 points), epilepsy (16 points),
cancer (12 points), mental health (41 points), hypothyroidism (8 points)
and asthma (72 points).
Points are also awarded for organizational aspects (184 points),
additional services, eg cervical screening (36 points), the patient
experience (100 points), holistic care payments (100 points) and quality
practice payments (30 points). For example, the following refers to
cardiac failure:
• Register of patients with CHD who have left ventricular
dysfunction—4 points
• 90% of patients with diagnosis conﬁrmed by ECHO—6 points
• 70% of patients being treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) inhibitor—10 points
The standards do not have an upper age limit, all patients needing to
have good blood pressure control etc., which diminishes any potential
ageism in management. In general older patients have beneﬁted from
the systematic approach to secondary prevention however, this may
not always be appropriate in the frailer elderly who may, for example,
get postural symptoms with ACE inhibition. There is the chance to ‘opt
out’ in an individual because it is ‘not clinically appropriate’ or the medication is not tolerated, but these standards discourage the individual
tailoring of therapy that is essential in geriatric practice. Documenting
evidence consumes large amounts of GP time, which could otherwise
be spent seeing patients. In addition, diseases that are NOT covered by
the standards may suffer. These include conditions such as Parkinson’s
disease, depression, and osteoarthritis, which are very common in older
people.
Out of hours
• No longer a requirement to provide out-of-hours services to patients
(in fact may be difﬁcult to opt to do so)
• Mostly now provided by centralized PCT services
• Most GPs experienced improved quality of life, and recruitment to
this career has improved
• Patients are unlikely to be seen by a doctor who knows them,
increasing the rate of referral to hospital
• Patients are asked to attend a central assessment point, and if
they are unable to (eg immobile), they are likely to be seen by a
paramedic or taken to hospital via the 999 system

CHAPTER 2

Organizing geriatric services

Careers in UK geriatric medicine
Consultant career pathway
• After qualiﬁcation foundation level 1 and 2 jobs are undertaken—most
include some time in geriatric medicine. Core medical training (usually
2 years) comes next and most doctors will obtain MRCP at this stage
• Application for a SpR post may follow a period of research, but
commonly this is done directly after CT2 posts
• Speciality training in geriatrics takes only 4 years but is almost
always paired with another specialty, eg general internal medicine,
rehabilitation medicine, stroke medicine. Dual accreditation will
take 5 or more years
• Triple accreditation in geriatric medicine, general internal medicine, and
stroke medicine is an increasingly popular career path

Non-consultant career grade pathway
• Includes staff grades, clinical assistants and associate specialists
• Responsibilities of the post-holder vary considerably from equivalent to
SpR (staff grades) to consultant (associate specialists)
• The main difference from a consultant post is that they do not hold
overall clinical responsibility and have variable responsibility for
management, administration, and training
• There is a pathway to convert to constant grade but it is time
consuming and expensive

Primary care physicians
• GPs may wish to sub-specialize in geriatric medicine
• This often leads to clinical assistant sessions in geriatric medicine
services (either acute, rehabilitation, or community settings)
• Such GPs often have signiﬁcant experience in geriatric medicine
during their vocational training scheme, and may obtain the diploma in
geriatric medicine

Non-European overseas doctors
• Many overseas doctors wish to work in the UK for a period of time,
and it can be difﬁcult and expensive to get a ‘foot in the door’
• Most overseas doctors begin with clinical attachments, which are
unpaid observer posts, but enable the doctor to become familiar with
the UK healthcare system
• Doctors trained in the European Union may apply for any job in the
UK but excellent English language skills and some familiarity with the
UK healthcare systems will be an advantage
• Since 2008 non-EU trained doctors are legally only able to be
employed in training grade posts which cannot be ﬁlled by an EU
applicant
• It is essential for non-EU trained doctors to take the PLAB examination
(M www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/plab.asp)
• Obtaining MRCP and the diploma in geriatric medicine help to deﬁne
an interest and will assist with subsequent appointments

DIPLOMA IN GERIATRIC MEDICINE (DGM)

Diploma in Geriatric Medicine (DGM)
Qualiﬁcation awarded by the Royal College of Physicians (UK) to ‘give
recognition of competence in the provision of care of older people’.

Candidates
Candidates must be 2 years post medical qualiﬁcation, and have held
posts in geriatric medicine. Usually taken by GPs with an interest in geriatrics (often trainees) or doctors working in (or applying for) geriatric
posts (trust grades, staff grades, associate specialists, etc.). Sometimes will
count towards other geriatric qualiﬁcations (eg master’s courses) so may
also be done by specialist registrars, although it is not primarily designed
for this group. May also be of interest to psychogeriatricians. It is of use
to all junior doctors doing a geriatric job as it motivates them to study
important topics that will recur in MRCGP and MRCP and it gives them
something tangible at the end of an attachment.

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Consultation skills
There are certain skills that are key to any consultation, but some are
more important with an older patient.

Arranging an appointment
• For older patients, attending hospital may be more of a physical and
emotional challenge, for which there is a need to feel well. Patients
often decide not to attend clinic appointments because they feel ill
• Hospital transport is often used. Morning appointments usually require
a patient to be ready by 8:30am—daunting for someone who takes
time to get going in the morning. Offer late morning or afternoon
appointments, using early slots for patients who travel independently
• When informing the patient about the appointment, make sure that
instructions are clear. Patients with dementia should probably have
appointments sent to carers who would ideally attend with them; visually
impaired patients may need a large print letter or a telephone call
• Remind the patient to bring both medication and prescription lists to
their appointment. Muddled medications may indicate self-medication
problems. Comparison of drugs and list helps to assess concordance
• Establish who has requested the consultation—eg memory clinic
appointments are often in response to family concerns, and the patient
may not attend as they do not perceive or wish to face the problem
• DH settings for consultation can be more relaxed, allowing the patient
to recover over lunch before facing the trip home again
• Are hospital attendances really necessary? Discuss with the GP,
offering to discharge the patient to his/her care, but supported by open
telephone access for advice and a hospital review on request
• If all else fails, DVs may be useful

Rapport
• Good rapport with the patient makes the interview easier, more
productive and more enjoyable
• Smart dress increases patient conﬁdence, especially in older patients
• Always introduce yourself—shake hands if it seems appropriate, and
address formally (Mr/Mrs/Miss) unless invited to do otherwise
• Be friendly but not patronizing or over familiar. Informal chat can break
the ice, and show that you have time for and interest in the person
• Older patients deserve and expect respect from (inevitably) younger
doctors, but often have more respect for the medical profession
• Patients are likely to have great faith in a trusted GP than in a young
junior met for the ﬁrst time. When asked what is wrong, they may
quote the GP diagnosis (‘Dr Brown said I had a stroke’) rather than
offering their experiences. Emphasize that you work as part of a team
(‘Your doctor has asked for our opinion, so we need to go over things
again. I will let them know what I think.’). After a hospital admission,
explain changes to prescriptions and that you will inform the GP
• Acknowledge and apologize for waiting times and uncomfortable
conditions (eg during an emergency admission)—it may not be
your fault, but apologizing may defuse frustrations that hamper the
consultation

CONSULTATION SKILLS

Environment
• Older patients are more likely to feel helpless and vulnerable in
hospital if only partially clothed and on a couch. Interviewing a fully
dressed patient sitting in a chair gives more dignity and respect
• Good light, quiet, and no interruptions will minimize problems from
visual and hearing impairment

Giving advice
• Advice is taken more often if rapport has been good during the
interview. Appearing knowledgeable and professional increases
the chance of agreement to investigations and medication changes.
For example, some patients refuse to take aspirin, having been told
years ago by a trusted doctor ‘never to take aspirin again’ because
of an ulcer. Take time to explain that risks and beneﬁts change with
evolving disease and as new therapies develop. Gain understanding and
agreement (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Discuss warfarin for AF’, p.280)
• Multiple conditions require multiple investigations and medications.
For example, following a TIA the patient may be well, yet tests can
include bloods, ECG, chest radiograph (CXR), brain scan and carotid
Doppler, and several drugs are often prescribed. Take time to explain
the rationale for each, thereby increasing concordance
• Write a list of planned investigations and medication changes along
with their justiﬁcation. Give the list to the patient. This takes time, but
increases the likelihood that advice will be followed
• Offer to repeat your advice to family members (who may be sitting
in the waiting room) or to telephone someone who is at home.
A frail spouse may not be able to attend outpatients, or a busy
daughter may not have time to attend, yet both may be vital to the
delivery of effective ongoing care—eg administering medications or
organizing appointment diaries
• It can sometimes be helpful to send a copy of your GP letter to the
patient but providing a second letter with key messages in ‘lay’ language
to the patient is even better

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Multiple pathology and aetiology
Most diseases become more common in an older population. Some conditions such as osteoarthritis are present in the majority (radiographically 70% of over 70s). By the age of 80, it is very likely that an individual
will have at least one disease. Many will have more than that (multiple
pathology). As increasing numbers of medications are advocated in the
practice of evidence-based medicine, so polypharmacy and adverse effects
become more common too.

Chronic stable conditions
The patient may have adapted to the limitations imposed by the disease
(eg not walking as far or as fast because of osteoarthritis knees; reading
large print books because of failing vision) or medicated to aid symptom
control (eg analgesia in arthritis). However, background multiple pathologies should be noted for two main reasons:
• Cumulative chronic disease will cause decline in physiological reserve
• The older patient with multiple stable diseases has less resilience to
physiological challenge than a ﬁt young person; a smaller insult is
needed to cause illness
• Non-speciﬁc presentations reﬂect the complexity of the pathology—
background problems interacting with new (perhaps seemingly
minor) insults to cause acute decline without obvious cause
• Many patients adapt to impairments, particularly if the functional
decline is gradual
• Assessment and intervention remains helpful, eg failing vision
is often accepted as a part of ageing, yet is often amenable to
treatment

Acute presentations
There are several aspects to consider:
• What is the acute precipitant? This may be minor, eg medication
changes, inﬂuenza, constipation
• What are the underlying pathologies making the patient more
susceptible to the acute precipitant?
• Note that one acute pathology can lead to another in a vulnerable
patient—eg a bed-bound patient with pneumonia is at high risk for
thromboembolic disease
So, for any single presentation there are likely to be multiple aetiologies which need to be unravelled. This can be difﬁcult, but applying a
structured logical approach assists the process:
• Use a problem list to help structure the approach (see b ‘Problem
lists’, p.60)
• Allow time for the acute event to settle, physical and psychological
adjustments to occur (much slower than in a younger person), stamina
and conﬁdence to build up, care arrangements to be put in place, etc.
• Involve a multidisciplinary team to take a holistic look at the patient and
evolve the problem list and action plan

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Taking a history
Histories taken from older people vary as much as the patients themselves, but some common problems make the process more difﬁcult:
• Multiple pathology
• Multiple aetiology
• Atypical presentation of disease
• Cognitive impairment, both acute and chronic
• Complex social situations
Failing to recognize the importance of obtaining an accurate and comprehensive history risks misdiagnosis and mismanagement.
There is often a difﬁcult balance to be struck between being inclusive
and being focused and efﬁcient

The patient interview
The most direct information source, but requires patience and skill.
• An elderly person with multiple problems may give a history that is
hard to unravel. Someone with chronic back pain will answer positively
to the closed question ‘Do you have pain?’, but it may be no worse
than the last 10 years and not at all a part of the new presentation.
Ask ‘Is this new?’ and ‘Is it different from usual?’
• Allow time to volunteer symptoms. Avoid interrupting. If a symptom
is mentioned in passing, return to it later to enquire about its nature,
precipitants, etc. Interrupting may cause the main issue to be lost
• The patient may underplay issues that are emotive (eg failing memory,
carer abuse, incontinence) or perceived as leading to institutional care.
Foster an atmosphere of trust and mutual interest in problem solving

Cognitive impairment
Patients with dementia or delirium may not answer clearly or succinctly,
and symptoms may need to be teased out. Quantities of seemingly irrelevant information may be interspersed with gems of important history.
Don’t get frustrated and give up—continue with a combination of open
questions and careful listening, punctuated by closed questions that may
result in a clear ‘yes’ or ‘no’. General enquiries such as ‘Do you feel well?’
and ‘Does it hurt anywhere?’ can be rewarding. A patient who is made to
feel silly will often dry up—if you are getting nowhere with speciﬁc questions, then broaden the conversation to get dialogue ﬂowing again.

Sensory impairment
Poor vision and hearing make the whole interview harder and more
frightening for the patient. Use a well-lit, quiet room. Guide the patient
to where you want them to sit. Ensure hearing aids are in, and turned on.
Speak clearly into the good ear and do not shout. Use written questions
if all else fails. Facilitate communication, however, laborious—patients will
worry that they appear stupid, and may elect to withdraw completely if
obstacles cannot be overcome (see also b ‘HOW TO . . . Communicate
with a deaf person’, p.549, and b ‘HOW TO . . . Optimize vision’, p.570).

TAKING A HISTORY

Terms that should be banned and why (Table 3.1)
Table 3.1 Terms that should be banned
‘No history
available’

It is almost always possible to get a history: if not from the
patient, then from family, carers, GP, community nurse, or
ambulance personnel. Nursing homes are staffed 24hr a day and
they all have telephones

‘Poor
historian’

The historian is the person recording the history—this term is
a self-criticism! If the patient is unable to give a history this is
important and the reason should be documented along with
evidence, eg AMTS, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)

‘Social
admission’

A social admission is one caused solely by a change in the social
situation, eg a carer who has died suddenly or a hoist that has
broken. True social admissions are very rare and should in
general be avoided (admit to a non-hospital setting, eg care
home, or increase care at home). If the patient’s function
has changed, eg new incontinence, falls, confusion, and their
unchanged social situation cannot cope then the admission is
NOT social. Often there is a combination of altered health and
social circumstances
It is true that a younger patient might be able to stay at home
with a minor change in health (eg Colles’ fracture, ﬂu) whereas
an older patient needs hospital care; but by blaming only
the social care the doctor is at risk of missing the medicine,
stigmatizing the patient and labelling carers as failures

‘Acopia’

Usually a more accurate description of the clerking doctor than
the patient! A grammatically incorrect and unhelpful term. Ask
yourself why can the patient not cope? What problem has led
to this presentation and can it be treated?

‘Bed-blocker’

Pejorative term that implies that the patient is actively hindering
discharge. Delayed discharge is a better term, as it removes any
hint of blame from the patient

2Patients admitted with the labels ‘social admission’ or ‘acopia’ are frail
and have a high in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Statistically they are
more likely to die in this hospital admission than a patient with myocardial
infarction (Kee YY, Rippingale C. (2009). Age and Ageing 38: 103–105). Just
because they are more challenging to diagnose and often require multidisciplinary assessment does not mean that they should be regarded as time
and resource wasters for the system.

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Other sources of information
Many patients, especially those with acute illness, are unable to give a full
and reliable history. If so, a history must be obtained from other sources.

The family
Often a rewarding source of information, especially at the initial assessment. Older people may underplay their symptoms, fearful of being
thought unable to cope, or not wishing to fuss. The family will often have
concerns and it is useful to establish these as they may (or may not) be
justiﬁed; weigh them up as more information is gathered.
Family members often wish to speak away from the patient—this can
be useful and is acceptable if the patient gives consent.
2Your duty is to the patient and you are their advocate. Family members
may have louder voices, but take care to listen to those for whom
you are responsible. Elderly people are allowed to take risks (eg live at
home with a high risk of falling) providing that they are competent.

Neighbours/friends
Elderly patients with no family nearby may be very well known to their
neighbours—perhaps they have been found wandering at night, or unusual
behaviour has been noted. The neighbour may not feel obliged to volunteer this information and it may need to be sought. Neighbours may also
act as informal carers and may contribute more care than family or formal
carers. Common law partners are often heavily involved, yet may not be
as prominent in hospital as other family members. Rifts may exist between
established family and new partners and these need to be understood
when planning care.

Professional carers
They will know the usual functional and cognitive state of the patient,
and will often have alerted medical services to a change. They are rarely
present at the medical assessment. Contact them and obtain all the information that you can.

General practitioner and community nurse
They may well know the patient very well, and have good insight into
the dynamics of the care arrangement and family concerns. They can
help clarify the medication and past medical history. If a confused patient
arrives during GP practice hours, an initial clerking should always include
a telephone call to the GP surgery. Patients who are housebound or who
have leg ulcers, urinary catheters, or other nursing needs, are usually best
known to community nurses.

OTHER SOURCES OF INFORMATION

Ambulance crew
The ambulance crew may be present during the initial hospital assessment
of a sick older patient. Ask them what they know—this is a useful source
of information that is under-utilized. If they have left, examine written
ambulance team documentation—this includes timing, symptoms, and
clinical signs including vital signs. Paramedics may also hold information
about social situation, eg state of housing, informal carers, etc.

Nursing and residential homes
When patients are admitted from institutional care, a good history can
almost always be obtained: information should be sent with the patient
(many homes have a transfer of care document), but if not it can be sought
by telephone immediately. Information about usual functional state, past
medical history, medications, and acute illness should be kept on ﬁle at
the home.

Old medical notes
Obtain them as quickly as possible, as they will provide essential medical
information. A search for any MDT assessments can be fruitful but
remember that this is not always ﬁled with the medical record. If the
patient is not local, arrange for information (letters, discharge summaries etc.) to be faxed or to speak to health professionals who know the
patient.

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Problem lists
Useful tools to help formulate plans for complex elderly patients in
any setting. They act as aides-memoire for multiple pathology and prompt
clinicians to consider interacting problems.
Problem lists should include:
• Acute problems
• May be a symptom (eg fall) rather than a diagnosis
• List possible causes with a plan for investigation
• Chronic conditions
• How stable is the disease?
• What management is already in place?
• What else can be done?
Lists can be generated at any stage in an illness—ideally at presentation—
but need to be worked on and evolve as time goes on. Involve members
of the MDT and make the list part of goal setting and discharge planning.

Example
• An 86-year-old woman who lives at home alone with a carer once a
day is admitted to the medical assessment unit with confusion following
a fall
• She has a past medical history of osteoarthritis, MI, and polymyalgia
rheumatica
• She has been ﬁnding it increasingly difﬁcult to cope at home in the last
year or so and getting occasionally confused
• Her daughter who lives abroad is very concerned
An initial problem list is suggested in Table 3.2.

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

General physical examination
There are two major ways in which examining an older patient can be
more time-consuming and challenging:
• The extent of the examination is wider:
• There are more systems with presenting symptoms
• You often need to ‘screen’ (by examining a wide selection of
systems) where presenting symptoms are vague
• The chance of detecting incidental pathology (eg asymptomatic
aortic stenosis, skin cancers) is much higher
• The procedure itself is more difﬁcult:
• Physical constraints—patients are less agile so undress more slowly
and cannot always adopt optimal positions for examination (eg lying
ﬂat). They may wear many layers of clothing. They are more likely
to have pain or to tire during the examination
• Cognitive constraints—examinations that require complex
instructions to be remembered and followed (eg visual ﬁeld
examination) may be too much for a confused elderly person
Despite these challenges, there are great rewards:
• There is a much higher prevalence of physical signs
• The examination more often makes the diagnosis, eg a patient with a
non-speciﬁc presentation may have an undiscovered abdominal mass
or a lobar consolidation

General advice
• Given the challenges, it is tempting to take short cuts leading to a suboptimal examination, but this must be resisted
• There are differing degrees of this—it might be reasonable to
auscultate a chest through a thin shirt or nightdress but it is useless
to examine an abdomen through a rigid corset or with the patient
sitting in a wheelchair
• Sub-optimal examination is dangerous, especially if inaccurate
ﬁndings are documented and then acted upon by others. It is better
to record that you haven’t completed an examination and put a
note at the end of your history that you, or another doctor, needs
to complete or repeat the procedure
• It is sometimes reasonable for a comprehensive examination to take
two or three sessions, but start with the most useful elements
• Make use of nurses, relatives or other carers to decrease the physical
problems of examination. Use electric beds and lifting and handling aids
to make examination more comfortable, effective, and safe
• Try to examine all aspects of one portion of the body at the same time.
If organized, you should not have to sit a patient up, roll them over or
stand them more than once per examination
• Always inspect the patient fully. For example, look under clothing
(especially sacrum and breasts), between toes, and under wound
dressings, wigs, and prostheses

GENERAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION

HOW TO . . . Assess gait in an older person
When?
• Almost always useful whether inpatient, eg acute admission,
outpatient, eg falls, movement disorder clinics, or rehabilitation
settings eg functional progress
Why?
• Provides vital diagnostic information
• Often appears time consuming but can be surprisingly efﬁcient—a
normal gait is a good screening test and an abnormal one will focus
further examination, eg on a single joint or system
How?
• Ensure the patient is suitably clothed (bare feet, open hospital gowns
and falling down trousers do not encourage a normal gait!)
• Have a nurse or relative ‘stand by’ the patient if there is any risk of
falls so that you can concentrate on observing
• If they normally use a walking aid provide this (but you may also wish
to try them without or with different aids)
• Ask them to stand and walk to a speciﬁed point in the distance
ideally a few metres away (eg sink, end of the room)
• Observe setting off, stride height, length, symmetry and ﬂuidity, trunk
position, and sway
• If safe encourage them to keep going, turn and return
• Consider if speciﬁc examinations indicated, eg tone for Parkinson’s,
Romberg’s test if wide-based gait
• Functional assessments may be timed to quantify changes over time
eg ‘Get up and go test’ = speed and stability while they sit to stand
and walk speciﬁed distance
• Carefully record your ﬁndings
Common patterns
Leaning back—Common with pseudo-Parkinson’s (see b ‘Diseases
masquerading as Parkinson’s disease’, p.164)
Leaning forward and grabbing furniture—Common in patients with
multiple falls and loss of conﬁdence; no single diagnosis
Veering to one side—Consider stroke or balance problems
Limping/antalgic—Consider hip or knee or foot problems
Unsteady on turning—Consider ENT pathology (see b ‘Vertigo:
assessment’, p.560)
Unsteady when ﬁrst stands—Consider postural hypotension (see b
‘Orthostatic (postural) hypotension’, p.118)
Difﬁculty setting off—Consider Parkinson’s (see b ‘Parkinson’s
disease: presentation’, p.158)
Wide based—Consider cerebellar, subcortical disease and normal
pressure hydrocephalus (see b ‘Normal pressure hydrocephalus’,
p.216)
Freezing/halting—Consider anxiety and fear of falling, Parkinson’s
disease or frontal brain lesions
Footdrop—Consider stroke or localized anterior tibialis lesion
Difﬁculty rising from chair—Consider proximal muscle weakness

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Investigations
Investigations are often less focused in older patients because:
• Presentation is more frequently non-speciﬁc
• Multiple pathology is more common
• Screening for many diseases (eg thyroid disease) is appropriate

Simple investigations
Almost all older people who present with new symptoms should have:
• Full blood count (FBC), ESR
• Urea, creatinine, and electrolytes (U, C+E)
• Glucose
• Liver function tests (LFTs)
• Calcium and phosphate
• CRP
• Thyroid function tests (TFTs)
• CXR
• ECG
• Urinalysis
These tests are inexpensive, well tolerated, rapidly available, and have a
high yield. Coupled with a comprehensive history and examination, they
will usually give sufﬁcient information to guide initial management and
further investigations. The urgency with which these tests are obtained
is often determined more by hospital policy and the need for fast turnaround than by clinical need.
• Don’t order repeat tests automatically until you have seen the results
of the ﬁrst set—only abnormal ones need to be repeated the next day
• If you order a test, record that you have done so in the notes (most
doctors write a list of suggested investigations and then tick the ones
they have themselves arranged)
• Ensure that results are reviewed and record them in the notes

Further investigations
Although it is often tempting to order further investigations at presentation it is often not helpful as it may mislead the clinician, lead to unnecessary patient anxiety, and to further time-consuming and expensive
assessments. Often the correct course of investigation is very different
when an experienced clinician reviews with the beneﬁt of initial results
and a short period of observation.
Do not request an investigation if it will not alter management, eg:
• Carotid Doppler is unnecessary if endarterectomy would be
inappropriate (eg poor functional status)
• Urgent CT head scan will not alter management for a deeply
unconscious patient dying of stroke

INVESTIGATIONS

Will it change management?
Sometimes making a diagnosis has value even where deﬁnitive treatment
is unsuitable. An investigation may alter management even if ‘aggressive’
treatment options are inappropriate. For example, sigmoidoscopy and
barium enema may be helpful in a patient with bloody diarrhoea even if
colonic resection is not feasible: pathology such as colitis could be treated,
and if advanced cancer were found, then the information would help
direct:
• Palliative management including ‘surgical’ procedures such as stenting
• Non-medical decisions, eg making a will
• Discharge arrangements, eg choosing care-home placement over home
• The diagnosis itself can be reassuring to patients and relatives
These concepts often have to be explained carefully to patients, family
and medical colleagues who may feel that some investigations are unnecessary or that not enough is being done.

Tolerating investigations
In general, non-confused older people accept and tolerate investigations
as well as younger patients.
There are a few exceptions, which include:
• Colonoscopy (increased risk of colonic perforation)
• Bowel preparation for colonoscopy or barium enema (more
susceptible to dehydration)
• Exercise tolerance tests—arthritis, neurological problems, etc. often
mean that the patient cannot walk briskly. Consider bicycle or chemical
provocation testing
It is often helpful to discuss the procedure with the person performing the
test (often a radiologist)—they might have suggestions for modifying the
test or substituting a different procedure to make it safer.
You may need to allow more time for gaining consent or for the
procedure itself especially if the patient is deaf or anxious. Elderly patients
are less likely to be aware of what modern medical tests involve than
younger patients. Particular problems occur with confused patients,
who may beneﬁt from escort by a family member or trusted nurse. The
cautious use of sedatives or anxiolytics is sometimes helpful.
In the outpatient setting it is often the trip to hospital rather than the
test itself that is traumatic. Minimize visits, eg by combining a clinic visit
with a test or by arranging two tests on the same day. Try asking the
GP or district nurse to remove 24hr tapes. Where a series of tests or
complex management needs to be accomplished, admission to hospital
may be the best option.

67

68

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Common blood test abnormalities
A screening series of blood tests in an older person usually yields several
that fall outside normal laboratory ranges. The examples that follow are
those which are most commonly abnormal in the absence of relevant
illness. Unless they are very abnormal or something in the presentation
makes them particularly relevant, they can usually be ignored. There are
four broad categories:

Different reference range in older patients
• ESR may be as high as 30mm/hr for men and 35mm/hr for women
in normal 70 year olds (see b ‘The ageing haematopoietic system’,
p.452)
• Haemoglobin. Some debate, but the reference range should probably
be unchanged (see b ‘The ageing haematopoietic system’, p.452)

Abnormal result but common and rarely imply important
new disease
• Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)—often low with normal free T4 and
T3 during acute illness: sick euthyroid syndrome (see b ‘The ageing
endocrine system’, p.420). Repeat 2–4 weeks after acute illness has
resolved
• Low blood sodium—Very low levels should always be investigated
(see Chapter 14) but some patients run with an asymptomatic
persistently mild hyponatraemia (t128mmol/L) due to (overall
beneﬁcial) drugs or sometimes without obvious cause
• Alkaline phosphatase—if LFTs are normal, an isolated raised alkaline
phosphatase (ALP) can represent Paget’s disease (see b ‘Paget’s
disease’, p.480), which is often asymptomatic. ALP remains high for
weeks after fractures, including osteoporotic collapse
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia—always check B12, folate, and
ferritin/iron/iron binding. If these haematinics, as well as an ESR
and blood ﬁlm are normal, then it is usually fruitless to look for the
cause of mild, non-speciﬁc anaemia (see b ‘Investigating anaemia
in older people’, p.453)—there is often chronic kidney disease or
early myelodysplasia underlying. Acutely unwell patients are often
haemoconcentrated, with a temporarily normal Hb that then falls to a
pathological level after a few days, when rehydrated
• Bacteriuria (see b ‘Asymptomatic bacteriuria’, p.620). Bacteriuria
is a common ﬁnding in older patients and does not always indicate
signiﬁcant urinary infection. As a rule treat urinary symptoms rather
than the bacterial count. The presence of white cells on urine
microscopy and nitrites on dipstick can also guide decisions.
• High creatinine/low estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR)
(see b ‘The ageing kidney’, p.384). Very common especially in
patients with multiple pathology and drugs. Changes in results over
time more useful than absolute levels

COMMON BLOOD TEST ABNORMALITIES

False negative result
• Creatinine—low muscle mass can mask poor renal function
(see Chapter 13). Consider using a conversion formula to estimate
GFR, eg when judging drug dosage
• Urea—as creatinine. In a frail older person, urea levels in the middle or
higher range of normal are consistent with severe dehydration

False positive rates very high
• Anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA)—ﬁgures of up to 1:80 are of doubtful
signiﬁcance in older patients
• D-dimer—Any form of bruising, infection, or inﬂammation will increase
d-dimer. If it is negative (rarely) it can still a useful test but do not
expect it to be useful test to exclude deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/
pulmonary embolism (PE) in a frail elderly patient with falls and a UTI
• Troponin—Although this test is very speciﬁc to cardiac muscle, low
level release can occur with arrhythmias, PE, and heart failure. It is not
a useful screening test in older patients with no chest pain and a nonspeciﬁc presentation

69

70

CHAPTER 3

Clinical assessment of older people

Comprehensive geriatric assessment
A comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is the multidimensional
evaluation of the patient in his/her environment. It encompasses medical,
functional, and psychosocial elements which provide an interdisciplinary
assessment and informs a plan for treatment and/or care. The management is goal-orientated with the aim of restoring or maintaining an older
persons function and independence.

The team
CGA usually involves a team including nurses, therapists, and social
workers who work together with a common form of documentation and/
or regular meetings.

Settings
• Inpatient—in a designated area or utilizing a specialized roaming team
• DH (see b ‘Day hospitals’, p.22)
• Outpatients—specialized clinics aimed at admission avoidance and
early supported discharge, or follow-up of recently discharged patients
to optimize functional recovery
• Care homes—advise on suitability of long-term placement, eg after
urgent placement to avoid hospital admission

Interventions
CGA usually leads to several recommendations/treatments with clear
goal-setting and often regular review of progress. Interventions might
include physical therapy, changes in medication, environmental modiﬁcation or advice about care home placement. The tool of CGA has been
adapted to disease-speciﬁc management programmes (eg heart failure)
and to assessing the suitability of older patients for cancer treatments.

The patients
CGA is expensive and should be targeted to those most likely to beneﬁt
and exclude those whose prognosis is very good or very poor regardless
of intervention.

Evidence
It is difﬁcult to compare data from such diverse interventions and settings,
and little is known about the effectiveness of individual components of
the ‘black box’ of CGA. However, there is good evidence that CGA can
improve important outcomes such as survival, function, and quality of life,
as well as reducing length of inpatient stay and reducing admissions to
hospital and nursing homes. It is not surprising that CGA is more effective
when coupled with:
• Control over implementation of advice
• Long-term follow-up/review

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Introduction
Rehabilitation (rehab) is a process of care aimed at restoring or maximizing physical, mental, and social functioning. Can be used for:
• Acute reversible insults, eg sepsis
• Acute non-reversible or partially reversible insults, eg amputation, MI
• Chronic or progressive conditions, eg Parkinson’s disease
Involves both restoration of function and adaptation to reduced function depending on how much reversibility there is in the pathology.
Rehabilitation is an active process done by the patient not to him/her.
It is hard work for the patient (akin to training for a marathon)—it is not
‘convalescence’ (akin to a holiday in the sun).
Rehabilitation is the ‘secret weapon’ of the geriatrician, poorly
understood and little respected by other clinicians. Many geriatricians
feel it is what deﬁnes their specialty and it can certainly be one of the
most rewarding parts of the job. The ‘black box’ of rehabilitation
contains a selection of non-evidence-based, common sense interventions
comprising:
• Positive attitude. Good rehabilitationalists are optimists—this is partly
because they believe all should be given a chance and partly because
they have seen very frail and disabled older people do well. A positive
attitude from the team and other rehabilitating patients also improves
the patient’s expectations. Rehabilitation wards should harbour an
enabling culture where the whole team encourages independence:
patients dressed in their own clothes, with no catheter bags on show
and eating meals at a table with other patients
• MDT coordinated working. By sharing goals the team can ensure all team
members are consistent in their approach
• Functionally based treatment, eg the haemoglobin level only matters if it
is making the patient breathless while walking to the toilet
• Individualized holistic outcome goals. These incorporate social aspects
which are often neglected. The team concentrates on handicap rather
than impairments (see Box 4.1)

Settings
Specialized rehabilitation wards are not the only place for rehab. If the
considerations outlined are in place then successful rehabilitation can take
place in:
• Acute wards
• Specialist wards (eg stroke units, orthopaedic wards)
• CHs
• DHs
• Nursing and residential homes
• The patient’s own home
These alternative sites often employ a roving rehabilitation team, which
may be based in a hospital or the community.

INTRODUCTION

Box 4.1 World Health Organization (WHO) classiﬁcation
(1980)
IMPAIRMENT—pathological defect in an organ or tissue,
eg homonymous hemianopia due to posterior circulation stroke
DISABILITY—restriction of function due to impairment,
eg inability to drive due to visual defect
HANDICAP—the social disadvantage cause by disability,
eg unable to visit friends in neighbouring village as unable to drive
It can be seen that some impairments produce no disability or handicaps and some handicaps are due to multiple interacting impairments.
The system allows the social circumstances to be factored in, such as
in the examples given, the disability produces no handicap if a regular
bus route exists. Doctors are generally focused on impairments, poor at
assessing disability, and rarely consider handicap.
Despite the attractive logic of such a classiﬁcation, it is actually rarely
used in clinical practice. This is probably because geriatricians intuitively
consider the wider aspects of illness without requiring the discipline of
formal terms. The word ‘handicapped’ is now avoided due to negative
connotations and stigma. The WHO issued a new classiﬁcation of
Functioning, Disability and Health in 1999 which is a little more complex
but has a broadly similar structure (M www.who.int/classiﬁcations/icf/
en/index.html).

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

The process of rehabilitation
1. Selection of patients
See b ‘Selecting patients for inpatient rehabilitation’, p.80.

2. Initial assessment
This is not like a medical clerking, you need to get to know your patient
on different levels (eg their mood, motivation and expectations, complex
social factors). Remember it is more meaningful to assess the handicap
not just the impairment.

3. Goal setting
See b ‘Aims and objectives of rehabilitation’, p.75.

4. Therapy
• Medical—doctor led (see b ‘Doctors in the rehabilitation team’, p.94)
• Physical—mainly physiotherapy (see b ‘Physiotherapy’, p.86) and
nurse led (see b ‘Nurses in the rehabilitation team’, p.95). Mobility,
balance, and stamina. Conﬁdence is often a key issue
• Self care—mainly occupational therapy (see b ‘Occupational therapy’,
p.91) and nurse led
• Environmental modiﬁcation—aids and adaptations
• Carer/relative training—it is too late to leave this until just prior to
discharge

5. Reassessment
Usually at weekly MDT meetings (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Conduct a MDT
meeting’, p.84). Goals are adjusted and new goals are set. Points 3, 4, and
5 are repeated in a cycle until the patient is ready for discharge.

6. Discharge planning
See b ‘HOW TO . . . Plan a complex discharge’, p.83—should be started
as soon as the patient is admitted but the efforts escalate towards the end
of the inpatient period. A home visit and family meeting are often held to
clarify issues.

7. Follow-up and maintenance
Post-discharge DVs, outpatients or DH attendance. Ideally done by the
same team but in reality this function often taken over by community, in
which case good communication is vital.

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES OF REHABILITATION

Aims and objectives of rehabilitation
It is essential that the MDT, ideally in conjunction with the patient, states
what it plans to do and to achieve, in clear terms that are shared within
the team and can be worked towards. A large part of this is achieved
through the agreement and statement of targets at two hierarchical levels:
aims and objectives.

Aims
Best set by the team, in discussion with the patient. One or two, patientcentred targets that encompass the broad thrust of the team’s work—a
team ‘mission statement’ for that individual, eg:
• To achieve discharge home, with the support of spouse, at 6 weeks
• To transfer easily with the assistance of one, thus allowing return to
existing residential home place at 4 weeks

Objectives
Best set by individual team members, in discussion with patient. More
focused targets, usually several, that reﬂect speciﬁc disabilities and help
focus the team’s speciﬁc interventions, eg:
• To walk 10m independently, with a single stick, at 3 weeks
• To achieve night-time urinary continence at 4 weeks
Both aims and objectives should have ﬁve characteristics, summarized by
the acronym ‘SMART’:
• Speciﬁc, ie focused, unambiguous
• Manageable, ie amenable to the team’s inﬂuence
• Achievable and
• Realistic, acknowledging time and/or resource limitations. It is futile and
demoralizing to set targets that cannot be achieved. Conversely, the
team (and patient) should be ‘stretched’, ie the target should not be
inevitably achievable
• Time-bounded. Specify when the target should be achieved. Many
patients are motivated and cheered by the setting of a speciﬁc
date (especially for discharge). Setting dates for speciﬁc functional
achievements prompts further actions, eg ordering of equipment for
the home

Predicted date of discharge (PDD)
Specifying a PDD from the point of admission is useful for patients, carers
and MDT members.
• Emphasizes to the patient that inpatient care is not indeﬁnite, and that
a more pleasant home or care home environment is the aim
• Can be intrinsically motivating for patient and team
• Prompts carers and MDT to think ahead to pre- and post-discharge
phases of care

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Measurement tools in rehabilitation
Principles
The most widely used standardized measurement instruments are structured questionnaires that deliver a quantitative (numerical) output. They
vary in precision, simplicity, and applicability (to patient groups or clinical
settings). For each domain of assessment several tools of differing size are
usually available, reﬂecting tensions between brief assessments (speed,
easy-to-use, well-tolerated) and a more prolonged evaluation (precision
improved, give added layers of information).
Measurement tools are helpful at single points (especially entry and exit
to a therapy programme), and also in assessing progress and in guiding
discussion around likely discharge destination.

Advantages
•
•
•
•
•
•

Quantify
Widely understood, and transferable across boundaries
Facilitates communication between professionals and settings of care
Provide a synopsis
May permit a less biased, more objective view of the patient
Facilitate a structured approach to assessment and clinical audit

Disadvantages
• May be time-consuming
• Scores may conceal considerable complexity—patients scoring the
same may be very different
• Intra-individual, intra-rater and inter-rater variabilities mean that a
score may change whilst a patient remains static, eg, 3 or 4 points
change in the (20-point) Barthel is needed before a team can be
absolutely conﬁdent that the patient has changed
• There are many scales available, and some are not in general use,
leading to confusion when staff or patients move between units

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Measurement instruments
Activities of daily living (ADLs)
Personal ADLs (pADLs) or basic ADLs (bADLs). Include key personal
tasks, typically transfers, mobility, continence, feeding, washing, dressing.
A single scale is valid for all.
• The commonest is the Barthel (see b Appendix, ‘Bartel Index’,
p.688). Score range 0 (dependent) to 20 (independent). It is quick, and
apparently simple to use but is not very sensitive to change, as steps
within each domain (eg transfers) are large. A marked ceiling effect is
seen, especially for a range of impaired patients living independently at
home, many of whom score 20
• The Function Independence Measure (FIM) takes longer to complete
but is more sensitive to change during rehabilitation and can be useful
in predicting length of stay and discharge destination

Extended activities of daily living (eADLs)
Also known as Instrumental ADLs (iADLs). Include key daily household
tasks, eg housework, shopping. Useful for the more independent person.
Scales are selected according to an individual patient’s needs, eg Frenchay
Activities Index, Nottingham ADL Score.

Mobility
For example: Elderly Mobility Scale (EMS), Tinetti Mobility Score (TMS),
timed get up and go test.

Cognition
• Several screening and assessment tools are in common use
• The 10-point AMTS, see b Appendix, ‘The abbreviated mental test
score’, p.690) is brief, and useful for screening in both outpatient and
inpatient settings
• Clock drawing tests (see b Appendix, ‘Clock-drawing and the
Mini-Cog™’, p.693) are alternative screening tests
• The 30-point MMSE provides sufﬁcient precision to be used for serial
assessment—eg tracking recovery from delirium, or therapeutic
response to cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia—but takes <10min
to administer
• The Middlesex Elderly Assessment of Mental State assesses
systematically the major cognitive domains, using a range of targeted
subtests. Time-consuming (15min), but gives more detailed information.
Often used by therapists

Depression
For example, the GDS. Several versions of this are available, but the
most commonly used is the 15-point score (see b Appendix, ‘Geriatric
Depression Scale’, p.687), administered in 5–10min. Superﬁcially distressing questions, but well tolerated by most patients. Sensitive (80%) but
only moderately speciﬁc (60%).

MEASUREMENT INSTRUMENTS

Nutrition
The Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) (see b Appendix,
‘Malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST)’, p.695) is widely used to
screen inpatients and is superior at predicting malnutrition than weight
alone.

Pressure area risk
Prompt systematic evaluation of patients at risk, and brisk response in
those at risk, is essential. Several scores are available, but the most widely
used is the Waterlow Pressure Sore Prevention Score, a summary score
derived from easily available clinical data. High score indicates high risk.
Note that the score does not take into account the ability of the patient to
lessen risk by changing position, the acuity of the medical condition, etc.

Disease-speciﬁc scales
All of the common diseases have dedicated scales, usually developed for
use in research, and then introduced variably into clinical practice. They
are often more complex than used in general clinical practice, with corresponding disadvantages—time-consuming, less easily transferable. For
example the Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) quantiﬁes
all the motor and behavioural aspects of the disease as a single number.

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Selecting patients for inpatient
rehabilitation
Most hospitals do not have enough rehabilitation beds to cater for all
patients who could beneﬁt, so these beds are a valuable resource. This is
often not understood by the patients, relatives, or referring service. Patient
selection is a time-consuming, important, and complex task. Where there
is no cost limit, the approach can be more inclusive.

Who should select patients?
Review of referrals is often done by geriatricians, but can equally well be
done by another experienced rehabilitation professional. In some cases, a
team assessment is done and discussed in a conference.

Who to choose?
This is difﬁcult. Be aware that some services will refer simply to get the
patient out of one of their beds. Two factors need to be considered:
• Which patients will beneﬁt most from what is a limited resource?
• What does the MDT need to keep it positive and functioning well?
In many ways the ‘best’ rehabilitation patient is one who has had an acute
event from which they are recovering (eg a fracture), who is motivated
and cognitively intact—able to participate in therapy with enthusiasm and
who has a clear goal in mind. There are rapid results and fast turnover to
keep variety and interest for the team. However, consider whether this
type of patient actually needs ‘hard core’ inpatient rehabilitation, or in fact
would get better in almost any supported setting with a bit of convalescent time (eg intermediate care with nursing, guidance to improve stamina
and conﬁdence and perhaps a bit of social support on discharge).
Contrast this with a frail elderly woman with multiple medical problems,
moderate cognitive impairment, barely managing at home alone before a
prolonged hospital inpatient stay with repeated complications, who has
gone downhill physically and mentally. If asked, she wishes to go home, but
this may not appear altogether realistic. Her daughter in Australia thinks
she should go into a home for ‘her own safety’. It is all too easy to write
this patient off, deny them rehabilitation, and arrange placement. This is
the kind of complex ‘heartsink’ patient who most needs the expertise
of the rehabilitation team. In any other specialty, the most complex cases
are dealt with by the specialist; the same applies to rehabilitation. These
types of patient sometimes do remarkably well and should at least be
offered a trial of rehabilitation.
Even patients with no recovery potential can beneﬁt from aspects of
the team’s expertise, eg learning adaptation, teaching skills to carers or
arranging complex discharge packages.
2In general, the harder a problem seems to be, the less likely it is that it
will be sorted out in a non-specialist setting and the more likely it is that
the patient will beneﬁt from the rehabilitation team.
In practice it is often a balance between the two, where a broad case
mix is maintained; with some slower-stream complex cases and some
more rapidly treated simpler cases.

SELECTING PATIENTS FOR INPATIENT REHABILITATION

Information required for patient selection
Should be gleaned from all available sources (including primary nurse,
hospital notes—medical, nursing and therapy, family, carers, primary
care team, specialists, etc.) and may involve telephone calls and/or
several visits. Regardless of who does the assessment, the following
information should be acquired.
Premorbid features
• Physical problems—list of medical conditions, how active they are
and how they impact on life; list of medications
• Functional limitations—assess by conversation (Did you use a stick?
Did you ever go out alone? Could you get up and down stairs?, etc.)
Quantify with a rating scale
• Social set-up—who do they live with (and how ﬁt and willing to
help are they); where do they live (rural or in town); what is the
property like (eg ﬂat or house, any stairs to access and once inside
the property, whether the bedroom and bathroom are up or
downstairs); does anyone help out (formally, eg home carers, or
informally, eg neighbours, family, friends); what did they do on a
regular basis (eg walk to the pub for lunch, attend day centres or
lunch clubs, cycle into town for groceries, etc.)
• Cognitive state—range from mild memory problems (may
predispose to delirium) to signiﬁcant dementia. Ask about any
objective assessments (eg MMSE) and the difﬁculties the problem
causes in everyday life
Acute features
• Nature of acute insult—is it reversible (compare amputation to acute
confusional state)
• Interacting comorbidities
• What is the expected recovery curve?—Varies with the disease: a
patient with a large stroke may show very slow progress at outset
and then steady but slow progress after several weeks; a patient with
a fractured neck of femur by contrast is likely to improve rapidly after
the operation and continue to make quick progress; a septic patient
is unlikely to improve at all until the acute illness has resolved and is
then likely to improve steadily. If the assessor has limited knowledge
of the disease, obtain information from the specialist currently caring
for the patient
Patient wishes
• Do they understand about the problems they face?
• Do they know what they wish to do when they leave hospital?
(eg go home as soon as possible, return to their residential home,
not go home unless they are able to function as before, etc.)

81

82

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Patients unlikely to beneﬁt from
rehabilitation
• Patients in a steady state who are awaiting placement
• Patients for whom the process of waiting for a rehabilitation bed will
delay discharge (eg where expected recovery to discharge ﬁtness is
under a week)
• Patients with a single requirement for discharge (eg provision of
commode)
• Patients who are still medically unstable, requiring frequent medical
review, investigation or treatment
• Patients with pure nursing needs (eg unconscious patients)
• Probably inappropriate for terminal care patients (palliative care teams
likely to be able to support discharge planning when needed)

Dementia and rehabilitation
This can be frustrating and difﬁcult (but also very rewarding). Therapists
will often prefer patients with ‘carry over’—who are able to recall the
last session and build on it. Nurses may ﬁnd patients with behavioural
problems disruptive to the ward. Safety issues are more difﬁcult as
awareness of danger and the ability to make an informed decision about
risk taking are less. Relatives’ anxiety is likely to be high. However, there
is still a lot that can be done.
Repeated exercise can build stamina and some learning may occur.
Rehabilitation settings allow more time for spontaneous recovery to
occur. The more complex the discharge, the less likely it is that this can
be managed in a non-specialist setting and the greater the need for the
MDT expertise. Patients with dementia are most at need of an advocate
for their rights and wishes, and the expert team assessment of feasibility
and risk is the best way to ensure they are respected.
2In general, dementia alone is not a reason for refusing rehabilitation.

PATIENTS UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM REHABILITATION

HOW TO . . . Plan a complex discharge
• There is no such thing as a safe discharge—only a safer one. There
is widespread misapprehension that hospitals and nursing homes are
‘safe’ while home is dangerous but this is the wrong way round, eg
rate of falls in institutions is higher (there is just someone there to
pick you up) and the increased exposure to infection (eg meticillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ‘ﬂu) can be life-threatening
• The timing of discharge is sometimes obvious (eg when the patient
returns to premorbid functioning) but can be controversial. Some
patients want to go before the MDT feels they are ready and others
(or their families) wish to stay longer (usually due to unrealistic
aspirations or dislike of the chosen discharge destination)—
communication is the key to avoiding this. Patients should understand
that discharge is not necessarily the end of recovery following an
illness
• Start to plan discharge from day one, eg by obtaining background
social history and patient aspirations. Set a target that patient and
team are aware of—it is better to revise a predicted discharge date
or destination than to have none at all because it helps to focus goal
planning
• Involve relatives early—family meetings will ensure effective
two way communication. It will also reduce the chance of ‘the
daughter from America syndrome’ where a relative comes out of the
woodwork just before a carefully planned discharge to block or alter
the plans
The MDT members should prompt you but the following are common
pitfalls which can cause a discharge to fail:
• Care availability (especially night times)—check well in advance with
the care manager that the care package you plan is available
• Modiﬁcations and equipment—ideally any environmental
modiﬁcations should be in place before your patient is ready for
discharge otherwise there can be lengthy delays. It is amazing how
long it can take for simple measures such as a bed to be moved
downstairs. For more complex interventions (eg stairlifts, walk in
showers, deep cleaning) get an realistic estimate of time—sometimes
the patient may need alternative accommodation while these works
are completed
• Appropriate transport available (relative, ambulance)—check not just
for patient but also for their equipment
• Keys—who has got them? Who needs keys/door entry codes?
• Night times—discharge plans often fail because the patient who
looks good by day has unanticipated needs at night. Check with the
nurses that they are not incontinent, immobile, or confused at night

83

84

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

HOW TO . . . Conduct a MDT meeting
This is a ward or team-based meeting with the primary functions of
communication, goal setting, reviewing progress and discharge planning.
There are also wider aims of:
• Team building. There is usually a chance for discussion over tea and
biscuits. This is not time wasting, it is vital for team bonding
• Education. Sharing knowledge and insight into each other’s jobs
Usually weekly for inpatient settings but can be less frequent in community or outpatients. Most commonly the team meets in a room away
from patients/relatives—sometimes involving the patient by bringing
them into the room.
Any member of the team can ‘run’/chair the meeting but in practice
where a doctor attends they usually take this role. The chair is responsible for:
• Timing—the last few patients discussed should not be rushed. Some
patients take a lot longer than others but this should be a function of
need not just where they happen to appear on the list. Don’t use the
same order each week
• Involving all team members—ensure each member has an
unimpeded opportunity to comment on each patient—some may
need prompting. Don’t allow assumptions that everyone knows
certain information or that it is unimportant. A well-established
team may automatically take turns—others may need you to force
an order. Ask members to clarify jargon or code that may not be
universally understood
• Ensuring decisions are made/goals are set. Without good
leadership a long discussion can occur without a positive action plan.
Prompt with ‘So what are we going to do about this?’ ‘Who is going
to take that on?’ ‘When will that actually happen?’. If discussion is
going in circles or there is dispute it can be helpful to summarize
what has been said so far to allow things to move on. Where there is
agreement on goals make sure they are SMART (see b ‘Objectives’,
p.75)
• Maintaining morale—remember case conferences can be stressful.
Keep discussions professional and good humoured. Careful use of
humour and frequent reminders that individuals and the team have
done well are very important
• Encourage feedback—it is interesting and educational to hear
follow-up on discharged patients. Ensure thank you letters, etc. are
shared as well as news on deaths, readmissions, etc.
Continued

PATIENTS UNLIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM REHABILITATION

The conventional order of presentation is:
1. Doctor—diagnosis, current management and changes planned,
prognosis—particularly if symptoms are limiting therapy
2. Nurse—nursing requirements, mood and behaviour, continence,
sleeping, relatives/visitors comments
3. Physiotherapist—mobility, equipment, progress and potential
4. Occupational therapist—functional assessments (eg dressing,
kitchen), cognition, and DVs
5. Social worker/care manager—background, discharge discussions,
external liaison (eg with council, funding panels, etc.)
This order allows discussions to ﬂow naturally from medical background to current function (therapists) to goal planning and discharge
plans (social worker). There is no reason why the order should not
be different but beware one person dominating and avoid discussing
endpoints (eg discharge) before going through the logical steps or you
will miss something.
Notes of the meeting are vital—ideally they should be written once
somewhere that all team members have access to. As a minimum
record date, current status, notes about the content of discussion (even
if solutions not found), goals, and plans. You have failed if you summarize
a 20min important discussion as ‘continue’ or ‘aim home next week’.

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Physiotherapy
Training
BSc(Hons) Physiotherapy is a 3–4 years’ full-time course. MSc Physiotherapy
can be done as a 2-year accelerated postgraduate course. After primary
training physiotherapists usually sub-specialize in one area such as care
of the elderly. See UK Chartered Society of Physiotherapists website,
M www.csp.org.uk.

The role of the physiotherapist
• Aimed at improving physical functioning by exercise, reducing pain and
providing appropriate aids
• May be for recovery, adaptation, or prevention, eg falls
• Patient needs sufﬁcient motivation, muscle strength, and energy to
participate—it is not a passive process
• Duration of therapy may be short initially, but increase as patient
tolerates more
• Cognitive impairment may limit learning and ‘carry-over’ of skills
from session to session, but stamina may be improved with repeated
sessions; dementia is not a reason to withhold physiotherapy
• Physiotherapists are the experts who plan and supervise physical
therapy but rehearsal of skills is often delivered by other members
of the MDT or patients are given exercises to do alone (often with
written instructions). Physiotherapy assistants, nursing staff, and
relatives can all assist in this rehearsal process
• Involved in training others to move dependent patients safely
(eg carers)

Range of interventions
Increasing range of movement
• Active or passive exercises
• Use after stroke or prolonged bed rest to increase joint mobility and
prevent pain and contractures
Increasing strength of muscles
• Usually general strengthening to improve stamina
• Can be targeted at speciﬁc areas of weakness and enhanced by the use
of resistance and weights
• Important part of falls prevention
Improve coordination
• Usually after stroke
• Repeated movements rehearse skills and improve coordination
• Improve sitting balance
Transfers (ie the ability to get from one place (bed) to another (chair))
• Strategy depends on patient ability
• Totally dependent patients are hoisted
• Once there is sitting balance then transfers with assistance of two
people and a sliding board can be attempted
• Once there is standing ability, then standing transfers with one person,
then a frame can be worked on

PHYSIOTHERAPY

Ambulation
• Exercises aimed at improving independence in mobilizing
• Realistic goals should be set—ideally premorbid state should be
achieved, but 10m may be adequate for discharge home if this is the
distance from chair to kitchen
• Balance aided by bars then walking aids
Heat treatment
Using packs, hydrotherapy pools, ultrasound etc. to treat pain and imp-rove
joint mobility.
Other treatments
For example, cold treatments, electrical stimulation for pain relief
(eg transcutaneous nerve stimulation (TENS) machine).
Provision of aids
Usually ambulatory aids.

87

88

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Walking aids
These increase stability, leading to improved conﬁdence and function, and
decreased falls. In general, identifying the need for an aid should prompt
consideration of: the cause of functional decline (is it reversible?); provision of a physiotherapy assessment for prescription (correct aid, correct
size); education (use of the aid, how to get up after falls); and treatment
(strength/balance training).
All walking aids without wheels should be ﬁtted with rubber ferrules to
optimize grip and then checked for wear regularly (Fig. 4.1).

Stick (or cane (USA))
• May be single-ended (‘straight’), double-ended (‘hemi-’ or ‘bipod’),
three-ended (‘tripod’) or four-ended (delta-, quadrupod).The latter
offer modest additional stability compared to the straight stick
• Held in the hand opposite the most impaired leg, thus unweighting the
impaired limb
• The level of hand placement should be at the greater trochanter,
permitting 20–30° of elbow ﬂexion—the most efﬁcient elbow muscular
function
• The choice of handle is important, eg
• Contoured: improve grip, reduce pressure, in permanent users or
those with deformities
• Swan neck: weight is centred over the base of the stick, providing a
little more stability
• Right-angled: more comfortable, but not easily secured when not in
use
• Crook handle: hooked over the arm when not in use

Frame
• A structure of lightweight alloy metal that is self-stabilizing (usually
based around four points in contact with the ﬂoor), providing
unweighting of the lower limbs and greater stability than a stick
• Various heights, depths and widths are available
• Bulky, and difﬁcult to transport. Some folding versions (often only
three legs) are available
• May be used indoors or out
• The handgrips should be at wrist level, with the elbows slightly (15°)
ﬂexed. Shorter frames are used in patients who fall backwards
• To use a non-wheeled frame, lift it and move it 10–30cm in front of the
body; then lean forwards a little, taking some weight through the arms
before taking two equal steps towards the centre of the frame
• A weighted frame has weights low on the frame structure to provide
additional counter-balance against falls
• A wheeled frame has wheels at the front, permitting faster walking and
an improved gait pattern, but it provides a slightly less stable base.
Small-wheeled frames are suitable only for smooth surfaces
• A gutter frame has forearm rests, enabling weightbearing through
forearms rather than hands alone, providing additional support in the
early stages of mobilization, or when hands/wrists are impaired

WALKING AIDS

Crutches
A full assessment by a therapist is needed before selecting crutches.
Crutches may be of the axilla- or elbow- type. Both are available with
various features that should be individually prescribed, eg closed elbow
cuffs provide added security and enable the user to let go of the handgrip
to open a door without the crutch falling to the ﬂoor.

Walkers or rollators
• A frame that has three or four wheels and often hand-operated brakes
(for added stability while static)
• Three-wheeled versions usually fold, permitting stowage in a car
• Rollators with additional features such as bigger wheels (for uneven
ground), a seat or attached basket for shopping or other house/
garden tasks are larger than most standard frames and are usually used
outdoors
• A trolley walker combines walking support with a means of
transporting items from room to room. One or two shelves. The lower
shelf is recessed at the back so that it doesn't interfere with walking

Early walking aids (EWA)
For example post-amputation mobility aid (PAM-aid). Used early (usually
from 7day 7) following amputation, in patients in whom a permanent prosthesis is planned or being considered.

OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY

Occupational therapy
Training
BSc Occupational Therapy a is 3–4 years’ full-time course or can be done
as a 2-year accelerated postgraduate course. The courses are 2/3 academic
and 1/3 ﬁeld work. After primary training OTs usually subspecialize in one
area such as care of the elderly. See (for UK) the British Association of
Occupational Therapists and College of Occupational Therapists website,
M www.cot.org.uk.

Role of the OT
College of Occupational Therapy deﬁnition:
‘OT enables people to achieve health, well-being and life satisfaction
through participation in occupation (ie daily activities that reﬂect cultural
values, provide structure to living and meaning to individuals; these
activities meet human needs for self care, enjoyment and participation in
society)’.
OTs achieve this by assessing both functional status and the environment
then advising how to adapt.

Skills versus habits
• A skill is having the ability to start, carry out, and complete a task
effectively (eg making a cup of tea)
• A habit is those tasks that are actually carried out (eg a person may be
able to make a meal, but does not do so when alone as they do not
feel hungry)

Components of personal ability
Assessed by direct observation during tasks, formal testing, and information taken from carers, relatives, and other professionals.
• Cognition—to understand the task and why it needs doing. May be
limited by dementia, poor concentration span, poor problem-solving
skills, etc. Assessed with cognitive tests such as Middlesex Elderly
Assessment of Mental State (MEAMS)
• Psychology—wanting to do and complete the task. Limited by
depression, apathy, impaired coping skills, etc.
• Sensorimotor ability—especially in the upper limb

Rehabilitation

Occupational therapy assessments and
interventions
Assessments
• Washing and dressing—aim to be done in the morning, when the
patient would normally be carrying out these tasks
• Kitchen—looking at competence and safety for required tasks
(depending on circumstances, eg may need to make a meal on a gas
stove, or just pour a drink from a prepared thermos)
• Access visits—are done without the patient, to study the layout and
potential problems of a patient’s own home
Home assessment visits
• A visit done with the patient, to see them in their own environment
• Can be done by the OT alone, or with another member of the MDT
(eg physiotherapist, care manager)
• May be useful to include intended carers (family or professional) as
concerns can be addressed during the visit
• Can be done in the community while the patient is still at home, from a
hospital ward prior to discharge to ensure that it is feasible and that all
possible problems and dangers have been minimized, or after discharge
as a follow-up
• Sometimes surprising—patients may either perform considerably
better than expected (as they are in a familiar environment to which
they have been adapting for years) or considerably worse (especially
when a new physical limitation has occurred, such as stroke, as being at
home emphasizes how different life will now be)
• Standard format for assessing all aspects of the property
• Followed by a report containing observations on client performance
and a list of recommendations regarding reorganization of furniture
(eg bring bed downstairs), equipment provision, and care required
• Often typed and circulated to all MDT members

Interventions
Teaching new skills (eg putting on a jumper with an arthritic shoulder)
and habits (eg heating up microwave meal every lunchtime). Looking at
how much can be done by the patient themselves, and how much help is
needed (family or professional carers). Assessing need for equipment and
advising about suitability, as well as training carers in its use. Commonly
used equipment includes aids to:
• Access—ramps, rails, banisters, stairlifts, perching stools (high stools to
enable seated access to a kitchen work surface) etc.
• Transfers—‘banana boards’ (curved boards that the patient slides
across from one horizontal surface to another), swivel mats
(two circles that twist to allow easier turning of an immobile patient,
usually in a car seat)
• Mobility—wheelchairs, scooters etc
• Bathing and dressing—bath boards, accessible baths and showers,
long shoe horns, grab handles (to allow picking things up without
bending), etc.

OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSESSMENTS AND INTERVENTIONS

• Toileting and continence—seat raises, commodes, non-return urine
bottles (for use when lying ﬂat), etc.
• Eating and drinking—cutlery and cups with easy grip handles, aids to
improve safety with hot water (kettle holders, full cup alarms), tap
turners, etc.
• Splints—for wrists (prevent pain) and ankles (foot drop)
• Sensory aids—enhanced signals, eg large dials on a clock or altered
signals, such as ﬂashing light instead of a bell for the deaf

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Doctors in the rehabilitation team
Doctors are commonly part of hospital rehabilitation teams but may be
missing from community rehabilitation teams where a nominated doctor
(eg GP or community geriatrician) can be consulted about speciﬁc issues.
When present, doctors often chair MDT meetings—this may be partly
historical and partly because they are ‘professional risk takers’ who are
more conﬁdent at coaxing a shared decision from a team, sometimes in
very uncertain circumstances.
Medical ward rounds are often less frequent than on acute wards
(a weekly round would be usual) and since the patient is usually medically
stable, communication with patient and family may predominate over
medical management.
In a rehabilitation setting the doctor’s main duties to the patient are:
• Selecting patients and maintaining a waiting list
• Optimizing and stabilizing medical treatments (eg ensure adequate
analgesia)
• Rationalizing drug therapy (eg stop night sedation)
• Anticipating and treating complications (eg pressure sores, Clostridium
difﬁcile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), DVT)
• Diagnosing and treating depression
• Identifying and managing comorbid conditions (eg incontinence, skin
tumours)
• Initiating secondary prevention (eg aspirin for stroke, bisphosphonates
following osteoporotic fractures, inﬂuenza vaccination)
• Organizing secondary referral to other specialists (eg dermatology,
orthopaedics)
Additional duties to the team include:
• Education
• Team building
• Context-setting—doctors often cross health sector boundaries
whereas therapists and nurses can be ﬁxed in teams or wards. They
should share information about the patients on the waiting list and
about those who do not reach the rehabilitation unit and why. This
overview can help the team understand pressure on beds, etc.

NURSES IN THE REHABILITATION TEAM

Nurses in the rehabilitation team
The role of rehabilitation nurses in the recovery of a patient is often
underestimated. They spend the longest time and often have the most
intimate relationship with patients and their relatives.
Their wide role encompasses:
• Rehabilitation helper—particularly rehearsal of new tasks learnt
with therapists (eg transfers, dressing). It takes longer and more
skill to encourage a patient to wash/dress themselves than simply to
provide personal care—this is the fundamental difference between
rehabilitation and normal ward nursing
• Overall performance assessors versus snapshot—they can detect any
differential performance between what a patient ‘can do’ with the
therapist and what he/she ‘does do’ when on their own, when tired or
when relatives are visiting
• Communication and liaison—ﬁrst port of call between members of the
team and patient and relatives. Emotive information sometimes more
readily revealed in such non-threatening discussions
• Nocturnal assessment—they are the only professionals able to monitor
sleep, nocturnal confusion/wandering, and nocturnal continence/
toileting
• Continence management
• Pressure and wound care management
• Medication administering and monitoring self-medication
• Ward or unit management
Some senior specialist nurses have roles that overlap with the doctor,
eg in selecting patients for rehabilitation, chairing MDT and family meetings, nurse prescribing, etc. This is especially true in some CHs which can
be exclusively run by nurse consultants.

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Other members of the rehabilitation
team
Speech and language therapy
Trained to degree level (3–4 years), or postgraduate diploma. See the
Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) website,
M www.rcslt.org.
Assessment and treatment of swallowing disorders forms the bulk of
inpatient work. Careful bedside evaluation of the patient is central to this,
complemented if necessary by videoﬂuoroscopy, the assessment ‘gold
standard’.
Useful interventions include patient positioning, changes in the texture
or consistency of food/ﬂuid, and carer supervision or prompting with
food boluses. A period of ‘nil by mouth’ may be necessary until possible
recovery of a safer swallow, during which artiﬁcial feeding should be
considered.
Assessment and treatment of speech disorders forms the remainder of
their work, commonly following stroke, or head/neck surgery. Therapists
are experts in communication disorders, and their assessments are useful
in distinguishing between severe dysarthria and dysphasia, for example.
They provide: advice to patient, carers and staff; alternatives to speech,
including communication boards, non-verbal strategies, and electronic
communicators.

Dieticians
Trained to degree level (3/4 years) or postgraduate diploma. See the
British Dietetic Association website, M www.bda.uk.com.
• Malnutrition in older people is common, underdiagnosed and
undertreated. Prevalence and severity is especially high with (acute or
chronic) comorbidity, and in inpatients
• Community dwelling older people may have an unvaried diet, depleted
in fruit and vegetables (‘tea and toast’)
• Dieticians are experts in the assessment and treatment of nutritional
problems, but other members of the MDT must be alert to the
possibility of malnutrition, and initiate interventions and dietician
referral. Screening tools are useful (see b Appendix, ‘Malnutrition
universal screening tool (MUST)’, p.695)
• Effective interventions include offering attractive food tailored to the
individual, asking the family to bring in food, offering food frequently,
and providing a dedicated assistant by the bedside to assist with feeding
(this could be a staff member, family or informal carer). Modern
packaging (prepacked margarine, snack boxes) can be obstructive
• Where 'normal' feeding is impossible, eg after acute stroke, the
dietician can provide assessment, monitoring and advice to the patient
(and family) regarding artiﬁcial feeding (see b ‘Nutrition’, p.356)

OTHER MEMBERS OF THE REHABILITATION TEAM

Pharmacists
Pharmacists train for at least 4 years, leading to the MPharm degree.
See the Royal Pharmaceutical Society website, M www.rpharms.com.
• Pharmacists are involved in preparation, prescribing, packaging and
dispensing of medicines. They are key to the system delivering quality
drug use to outpatients and inpatients, to older people
• Gatekeepers of many health community formularies (limited drug
lists optimizing costs and effectiveness). They advise on all aspects of
prescribing, especially interactions and dosing
Issues where pharmacists may help:
• High frequency of adverse drug reactions (up to 17% of hospital
admissions)
• Underuse of medications, eg preventatives in asthma
• Poor concordance/compliance/adherence
• Poor administration technique, eg inhalers
• Frequent and complex changes in medication
• Poor communication with primary care on discharge
• Absence of full medication history on admission
The NSF for older people states that all patients >75 should have their
medicines reviewed at least annually, and those taking four or more medicines 6 monthly. Every area must have schemes for older people to access
help from pharmacists in using their medicines.

CHAPTER 4

Rehabilitation

Social work and care management
Social workers are trained to degree level (3/4 years), or postgraduate diploma. See the British Association of Social Works website,
M www.basw.co.uk. Care managers may have less formal training.
• Care managers are based in both community and hospital settings, and
may work with patients of all ages
• The quality of support that they provide to a geriatric medicine service
is a key determinant of patient throughput and quality of care
• Any inpatient clinical area managing the needs of older people should
have signiﬁcant input from a social worker with experience in working
with older people
• Many EDs in UK hospitals now have a dedicated social worker, aiming
to avoid admissions by optimizing access to social care
• To function effectively, social workers must have a detailed
understanding of local services and facilities, how those services are
accessed, as well as about supporting information such as transport,
costs, and waiting lists
Elements of their role include:
• Assessment of client needs, often informed by the MDT in hospital
settings
• Translation of care needs into a package of care
• Monitoring delivery of care and modifying its content or providers if
necessary
• Providing patients and families with details of care homes that can meet
the patient’s needs, in the desired geographical area
• Providing advice about ﬁnances and ﬁnancial support, care homes, and
home care
• Performing ﬁnancial assessments to determine who will fund their own
care, and who will receive assistance
• Counselling and support, to patients and families
• Crisis management. For example, if a carer becomes ill or dies, a care
package may be increased urgently, or emergency admission to a care
home arranged. ‘Social admission’ to hospital should be a last resort,
unless the condition of the patient has also changed, in which case
urgent medical assessment, perhaps in a hospital, is essential
• Arranging short breaks (for the carer) or respite care (for the patient)

COMMUNITY NURSES AND HEALTH VISITORS

Community nurses and health visitors
Both are trained nurses with further postgraduate training and experience
that enables them to work more independently in community settings.
Their precise role and professional relationships varies greatly between
districts.

Community nurses
Usually work for one or more GP practices, providing domiciliary nursing
services in excess of those provided by non-nurse carers. A district nurse
is a community nurse who has undergone further training.
Specialist skills include:
• Wound care—assessment and treatment
• Insulin injections and diabetes monitoring
• Continence management
• Bowel management
• Chronic disease management
• Education, of patients and carers (eg PEG feed, catheter care)
Although caring for adults of all ages, much of their work involves older
people, especially the frail elderly. They are often an excellent source of
information about older people admitted to hospital, often having frequent contacts with frail elderly people who are unable to leave the home
and are therefore seen only rarely by GPs.
Community matrons are experienced senior nurses who are responsible
for identifying and care coordinating high intensity users of health-care.
They coordinate agencies for complex, frail and often elderly patients to
promote well-being and try to obtain maximum efﬁciency from primary
care and secondary care providers. Often this involves trying to reduce
emergency admissions to hospital and/or calls to out-of-hours GPs.

Health visitors
Again, HVs usually work with one or more GP practice, but the dominant focus is on health promotion. Most work with mothers and babies/
/children, but they can work with any age group. Some HVs specialize in
working with older people and carers. They may help older people maintain
independence by:
• Providing information about local activities
• Advising on beneﬁts
• Advising on help available from social services to support them in their
homes
• Visiting people at home
• Arranging respite care

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Falls and fallers
A fall is an event that results in a person non-intentionally coming to rest at
a lower level (usually the ﬂoor). Falls are common and important, affecting
1/3 of people living in their own homes each year. They result in fear,
injury, dependency, insitutionalization and death. Many can be prevented
and their consequences minimized.

Factors inﬂuencing fall frequency
• Intrinsic factors. Maintaining balance—and avoiding a fall—is a complex,
demanding, multisystem skill. It requires muscle strength (power:
weight ratio), stable but ﬂexible joints, multiple sensory modalities
(eg proprioception, vision, eye sight), and a functional peripheral and
central nervous system. Higher level cognitive function permits risk
assessment, giving insight into the danger that a planned activity may
pose
• Extrinsic factors. These include environmental factors, eg lighting,
obstacles, the presence of grab rails and the height of steps and
furniture, as well as the softness and grip of the ﬂoor
• Magnitude of ‘stressor’. All people have the susceptibility to fall, and the
likelihood of a fall depends on how close to a ‘fall threshold’ a person
sits. Older people, especially with disease, sit closer to the threshold,
and are more easily and more often pushed over it by stressors. These
can be internal (eg transient dizziness due to orthostatic hypotension)
or external (eg a gust of wind, or a nudge in a crowded shop); they may
be minor or major (no one can avoid ‘falling’ during complete syncope)
If insight is preserved, the older person can to some extent reduce risk,
by limiting hazardous behaviours and minimizing stressors (eg walking only
inside, avoiding stairs or uneven surfaces, using walking aids or asking for
supervision).

Factors inﬂuencing fall severity
In older people, the adverse consequences of falling are greater, due to:
• Multiple system impairments which lead to less effective saving
mechanisms. Falls are more frightening and injury rates per fall are
higher
• Osteoporosis and increased fracture rates
• Secondary injury due to post-fall immobility, including pressure sores,
burns, dehydration, and hypostatic pneumonia. Half of older people
cannot get up again after a fall
• Psychological adverse effects including loss of conﬁdence
Falls are almost always multifactorial. Think:
• ‘Why today?’ Often because the fall is a manifestation of acute or
sub-acute illness, eg sepsis, dehydration or drug adverse effect
• ‘Why this person?’ Usually because of a combination of intrinsic and
extrinsic factors that increase vulnerability to stressors
2A fall is often a symptom of an underlying serious problem, and is not a
part of normal ageing.

FALLS AND FALLERS

Banned terms
The terms simple fall and mechanical fall are used commonly, but
they are facile, imprecise, and unhelpful. ‘Simple’ usually refers to the
approach adopted by the assessing doctor.
• For every fall, identify the intrinsic factors, extrinsic factors, and acute
stressors that have led to it
• Within each of these categories, think how their inﬂuence on the
likelihood of future falls can be reduced

103

104

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Assessment following a fall
Think of fall(s) if a patient presents:
• Having ‘tripped’
• With a fracture or non-fracture injury
• Having been found on the ﬂoor
• With secondary consequences of falling (eg hypothermia, pneumonia)
Patients who present having fallen are often mis-labelled as having
‘collapsed’, discouraging the necessary search for multiple causal factors.
Practise opportunistic screening—ask all older people who attend
primary or secondary care whether they have fallen recently.

History
Obtain a corroborative history if possible. May often need to use very
speciﬁc, detailed, and directed questions. In many cases, a careful history
differentiates between falls due to:
• Frailty and unsteadiness
• Syncope or near syncope
• Acute neurological problems (eg seizures, vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency)
Gather information about:
• Fall circumstances (eg timing, physical environment)
• Symptoms before and after the fall
• Clariﬁcation of symptoms, eg ‘dizzy’ may be vertigo or presyncope
• Drugs, including alcohol
• Previous falls, fractures and syncope (‘faints’), even as a young adult
• Previous ‘near-misses’
• Comorbidity (cardiac, stroke, Parkinson’s disease, seizures, cognitive
impairment, diabetes)
• Functional performance (difﬁculties bathing, dressing, toileting)

Drugs associated with falls
Falls may be caused by any drug that is either directly psychoactive or may
lead to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion. Polypharmacy
(>4 drugs, any type) is an independent risk factor.
The most common drug causes are:
• Benzodiazepines and other hypnotics
• Antidepressants (tricyclics and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors
(SSRIs)
• Antipsychotics
• Opiates
• Diuretics
• Antihypertensives, especially ACE inhibitors and A-blockers
• Antiarrhythmics
• Anticonvulsants
• Skeletal muscle relaxants, eg baclofen, tizanidine
• Hypoglycaemics, especially:
• Long-acting oral drugs (eg glibenclamide)
• Insulin

ASSESSMENT FOLLOWING A FALL

Examination
This can sometimes be focused if the history is highly suggestive of a particular pathology. But perform at least a brief screening examination of
each system.
• Functional. Ask the patient to stand from a chair, walk, turn around,
walk back and sit back down (‘Get up and go test’). Assess gait, use of
walking aids, and hazard appreciation (eg leave an obstacle in the way
and see how they negotiate it
• Cardiovascular. Always check lying and standing BP. Check pulse rate
and rhythm. Listen for murmurs (especially of aortic stenosis)
• Musculoskeletal. Assess footwear (stability and grip). Remove footwear
and examine the feet. Examine the major joints for deformity,
instability, or stiffness
• Neurological. To identify stroke, peripheral neuropathy, Parkinson’s
disease, vestibular disease, myelopathy, cerebellar degeneration, visual
impairment, and cognitive impairment

Tests
Vitamin D deﬁciency is common in older adults, and evidence suggests
that replacing it reduces fall, so always check and replace appropriately.
Many other tests are of limited value, but the following are considered
routine:
• FBC
• B12, folate
• U, C+E
• ECG
• Glucose
• Calcium, phosphate
• TFT
If a speciﬁc cause is suspected, then test for it, eg:
• 24hr ECG in a patient with frequent near-syncope and a resting ECG
suggesting conducting system disease
• Echocardiogram in a patient with systolic murmur and other features
suggesting aortic stenosis (eg slow rising pulse, left ventricular
hypertrophy (LVH) on ECG)
• Head-up tilt table testing (HUTT) in patients with unexplained
syncope, normal resting ECG, and no structural heart disease
However, all tests have false positive rates, and even a ‘true positive’
ﬁnding may have no bearing on the patient’s presentation. For example,
a patient falling due to osteoarthritis and physical frailty will not beneﬁt
from echocardiogram that reveals asymptomatic mild aortic stenosis.
2Use tests selectively, based on your judgement (following careful history
and examination) of the likely factors contributing to falls.

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Interventions to prevent falls
The complexity of treatment reﬂects the complexity of aetiology:
• Older people who fall more often have remediable medical causes
• Do not expect to make only one diagnosis or intervention—making
minor changes to multiple factors is more powerful
• Tailor the intervention to the patient. Assess for relevant risk factors
and work to modify each one
• A multidisciplinary approach is key

Reducing fall frequency
• Drug review. Try to reduce the overall number of medications. For each
drug, weigh the beneﬁts of continuing with the beneﬁts of reduction or
stopping. Stop if risk is greater than beneﬁt. Reduce if beneﬁt is likely
from the drug class, but the dose is excessive for that patient. Taper to
a stop if withdrawal effect likely, eg benzodiazepine
• Treatment of orthostatic hypotension (see b ‘Orthostatic (postural)
hypotension’, p.118)
• Strength and balance training. In the frail older person by a
physiotherapist, exercise classes, or disciplines such as Tai Chi
• Walking aids. Provide an appropriate aid and teach the patient how to
use it (see b ‘Walking aids’, p.88)
• Environmental assessment and modiﬁcation (often by OT;
see b ‘Occupational therapy’, p.91)
• Vision. Ensure glasses are appropriate (avoid vari- or bifocal lenses)
• Reducing stressors. This involves decision making by the patient or
carers. The cognitively able patient can judge risk/beneﬁt and usually
modiﬁes risk appropriately, eg limiting walking to indoors, using a
walking aid properly and reliably, and asking for help if a task (eg getting
dressed) is particularly demanding. However:
• Risk can never be abolished
• Enforced relative immobility has a cost to health
• Patient choice is paramount. Most will have clear views about risk
and how much lifestyle should change
• Institutionalization does not usually reduce risk

Preventing adverse consequences of falls
Despite risk reduction, falls may remain likely. In this case, consider:
• Osteoporosis detection and treatment
• Teaching patients how to get up. Usually by a physiotherapist
• Alarms, eg pullcords in each room or a pendant alarm (worn around
the neck). Often these alert a distant call centre, which summons more
local help (home warden, relative, or ambulance)
• Supervision. Continual visits to the home (by carers, neighbours, family,
and/or voluntary agencies) reduce the duration of a ‘lie’ post-fall
• Change of accommodation. This sometimes reduces risk, but is not a
panacea. A move from home to a care home rarely reduces risk—care
homes are unfamiliar, often have hard ﬂooring surfaces, and staff
cannot provide continuous supervision

INTERVENTIONS TO PREVENT FALLS

Preventing falls in hospital
Falls in hospital are common, a product of admitting acutely unwell older
people with chronic comorbidity into an unfamiliar environment.
Multifactorial interventions have the best chance of reducing falls:
• Treat infection, dehydration, and delirium actively
• Stop incriminated drugs and avoid starting them
• Provide good quality footwear, and an accessible walking aid
• Provide good lighting and a bedside commode for those with urinary
or faecal urgency or frequency
• Keep a call bell close to hand
• Care for the highest risk patients in a bay under continuous staff
supervision

Interventions that are rarely effective and may be harmful
• Bedrails (cotsides). Injury risk is substantial: limbs snag on
unprotected metal bars and patients clamber over the rails, falling
even greater distances onto the ﬂoor below
• Restraints. These increase the risk of physical injury, including
fractures, pressure sores, and death. Also increase agitation

Hip protectors
• Impact absorptive pads stitched into undergarments
• Limited evidence that they are effective in hospitals although there is
some evidence in a care home setting
• Success relies on meticulous use which is difﬁcult—they are tricky
to put on, can be uncomfortable, and multiple pairs (£40 each) are
needed if incontinence is a problem

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Syncope and presyncope
Syncope is a sudden, transient loss of consciousness due to reduced cerebral perfusion. The patient is unresponsive with a loss of postural control
(ie slumps or falls). Presyncope is a feeling of light-headedness that would
lead to syncope if corrective measures were not taken (usually sitting or
lying down).
These conditions:
• Are a major cause of morbidity (occurring in a quarter of institutionalized
older people), recurrent in 1/3. Risk of syncope increases with advancing
age and in the presence of cardiovascular disease
• Account for 5% of hospital admissions, and many serious injuries
(eg hip fracture)
• Cause considerable anxiety and can cause social isolation as sufferers
limit activities, in fear of further episodes

Causes
These are many. Older people with decreased physiological reserve are
more susceptible to most. They can be subdivided as follows:
• Peripheral factors Hypotension may be caused by the upright posture,
eating, straining, or coughing; and may be exacerbated by low
circulating volume (dehydration), hypotensive drugs or intercurrent
sepsis. Orthostatic hypotension is the most common cause of syncope
• Vasovagal syncope (‘simple faint’) Common in young and old people.
Vagal stimulation (pain, fright, emotion, etc.) leads to hypotension and
syncope. Usually, an autonomic prodrome (pale, clammy, light-headed)
is followed by nausea or abdominal pain, then syncope. Benign, with
no implications for driving. Diagnose with caution in older people with
vascular disease, where other causes are more common
• Carotid sinus syndrome
• Pump problem. Myocardial infarction or ischaemia, arrhythmia
(tachy- or bradycardia, eg ventricular tachycardia (VT), supraventricular
tachycardia (SVT), fast atrial ﬁbrillation (AF), complete heart block etc.)
• Outﬂow obstruction, eg aortic stenosis
• Pulmonary embolism
The main differential is seizure disorder, where the loss of consciousness
is due to altered electrical activity in the brain (see b ‘Epilepsy’, p.166).
2 Stroke and TIA very rarely cause syncope, as they cause a focal not a
global deﬁcit. Brainstem ischaemia is the rare exception.

History
The history often yields the diagnosis, but accuracy can be difﬁcult to
achieve—the patient often remembers little. Witness accounts are valuable
and should be sought.
Ensure that the following points are covered:
• Situation—was the patient standing (orthostatic hypotension),
exercising (ischaemia or arrhythmia), sitting or lying down (likely
seizure), eating (post-prandial hypotension), on the toilet (defecation
or micturition syncope), coughing (cough syncope), in pain or
frightened (vasovagal syncope)?

SYNCOPE AND PRESYNCOPE

• Prodrome—was there any warning? Palpitations suggest arrhythmia;
sweating with palpitations suggests vasovagal syndrome; chest pain
suggests ischaemia; light-headedness suggests any cause of hypotension.
Gustatory or olfactory aura suggests seizures. However, associations
are not absolute, eg arrhythmias often do not cause palpitations
• Was there loss of consciousness?—There is much terminology
(fall, blackout, ‘funny turn’, collapse etc.), and different patients mean
different things by each term. Syncope has occurred if there is loss of
consciousness with loss of awareness due to cerebral hypoperfusion;
however, many (730%) patients will have amnesia for the loss of
consciousness and simply describe a fall
• Description of attack—ideally from an eyewitness. Was the patient
deathly pale and clammy (likely systemic and cerebral hypoperfusion)?
Were there ictal features (tongue biting, incontinence, twitching)?
Prolonged loss of consciousness makes syncope unlikely. A brain
deprived of oxygen from any cause is susceptible to seizure; a ﬁt does
not necessarily indicate that a seizure disorder is the primary problem.
Assess carefully before initiating anticonvulsant therapy
• Recovery period—ideally reported by an eyewitness. Rapid recovery
often indicates a cardiac cause. Prolonged drowsiness and confusion
often follow a seizure

Examination
Full general examination is required. Ensure that the pulse is examined,
murmurs sought, and a postural blood pressure is obtained.

Investigation
• Bloods—check for anaemia, sepsis, renal disease, myocardial ischaemia
• ECG—for all older patients with loss of consciousness or presyncope.
Look speciﬁcally at PR interval, QT interval, trifascicular block
(prolonged PR, right bundle branch block (RBBB) and left anterior
fasicular block), ischaemic changes, and LVH
• Other tests depend on clinical suspicion, eg tilt test if symptoms sound
orthostatic but diagnosis is proving difﬁcult (lying and standing blood
pressures will usually sufﬁce; tilt testing is a very labour-intensive test, and
should not be requested routinely); brain scan and electroencephalogram
(EEG) if seizures suspected; Holter monitor, if looking for arrhythmias

Treatment
• Treat the cause
• Often not found, or multifactorial, so treat all reversible factors
• Review medication (eg diuretics, vasodilators, cholinesterase inhibitors,
tricyclic antidepressants)
• Education about prevention and measures to abort an attack if there
is a prodrome. Advise against swimming or bathing alone, and inform
about driving restrictions. (Varies from no restriction to a 6-month ban,
depending on the type of syncope. See details at M www.dft.gov.uk/
dvla/medical/ataglance.aspx)
2A signiﬁcant proportion of patients referred to specialist clinics for assessment of ‘syncope’ or ‘blackout’ are found not to have lost consciousness,
but to have had a fall secondary to gait or balance abnormalities.

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Balance and dysequilibrium
Balancing is a complex activity, involving many systems.

Input
There must be awareness of the position of the body in space, which
comes from:
• Peripheral input—information about body position comes from
peripheral nerves (proprioception) and mechanoreceptors in the joints.
This information is relayed via the posterior column of the spinal cord
to the central nervous system (CNS)
• Eyes—provide visual cues as to position
• Ears—provide input at several levels. The otolithic organs
(utricle and saccule) provide information about static head position.
The semicircular canals inform about head movement. Auditory cues
localize a person with reference to the environment

Assimilation
Information is gathered and assessed in the brain stem and cerebellum.

Output
Messages are then relayed to the eyes, to allow a steady gaze during head
movements (the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex) and to the cortex and the cord
to control postural (antigravity) muscles.
When all this functions well, balance is effortless. A defect(s) in any one
contributing system can cause balance problems or dysequilibrium:
• Peripheral nerves—neuropathy is more common. Speciﬁcally, it is
believed that there is a signiﬁcant age-related loss of proprioceptive
function
• Eyes—age-related changes decrease visual acuity. Disease (cataracts,
glaucoma etc.) is more common
• Ears—age-related changes decrease hearing and lead to reduced
vestibular function. The older vestibular system is more vulnerable to
damage from drugs, trauma, infection, and ischaemia
• Joint receptors—degenerative joint disease (arthritis) is more common
in older people
• CNS—age-related changes can slow processing. Disease processes
(ischaemia, hypertensive damage, dementia, etc.) are more common
with age
• Postural muscles—more likely to be weak, because of inactivity, disease,
medication (eg steroids) or the reduced muscle mass of ageing
In the older person, one or more of these defects will occur commonly. In
addition, skeletal changes may alter the centre of gravity, and cardiovascular
changes may lead to arrhythmias or postural change in blood pressure,
exacerbated further by medications.

BALANCE AND DYSEQUILIBRIUM

An approach to dysequilibrium
• Aetiology is usually multifactorial
• Consider each system separately, and optimize its function
• Look at provoking factors (medication, cardiovascular conditions,
environmental hazards etc.) and minimize them
• Work on prevention:
• Alter the environment (eg improve lighting)
• With the physiotherapist, develop safer ways to mobilize and
increase strength, stamina, and balance
• Small adjustments to multiple problems can make a big difference,
eg when appropriate, combine cataract extraction, a walking aid,
vascular secondary prevention, a second stair rail, brighter lighting,
and a course of physiotherapy
2If falls persist despite simple (but multiple) interventions, refer to a falls
clinic.

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Dizziness
A brain that has insufﬁcient information to be conﬁdent of where it is
in space generates a sensation of dizziness. This can be due to reduced
sensory inputs, or impairment of their integration. Dizziness is common,
occurring in up to 30% of older people.
However, the term dizziness can be used by patients and doctors to
mean many different things, including:
• Movement (spinning) of the patient or the room—vertigo
(see b ‘Vertigo’, p.558)
• Dysequilibrium or unsteadiness (see b ‘Balance and dysequilibrium’,
p.112)
• Light-headedness—syncope and presyncope (see b ‘Syncope and
presyncope’, p.108)
• Mixed—a combination of these sensations
• Other—eg malaise, general weakness, headache
Distinguishing these is the ﬁrst step in management, as it will indicate
possible causal conditions. This relies largely on the history. Discriminatory
questions include:
• ‘Please try to describe exactly what you feel when you are dizzy’
• ‘Does the room spin, as if you are on a roundabout?’ (Vertigo)
• ‘Do you feel light-headed, as if you are about to faint?’ (Presyncope)
• ‘Does it occur when you are lying down?’ (If so, presyncope is unlikely)
• ‘Does it come on when you move your head?’ (Vertigo more likely)
• ‘Does it come and go?’ (Chronic, constant symptoms are more likely to
be mixed or psychiatric in origin)

Causes
The individual conditions most commonly diagnosed when a patient
complains of dizziness are:
• Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (see b ‘Vertigo’, p.558)
• Labyrinthitis (see b ‘Vertigo’, p.558)
• Posterior circulation stroke (see b ‘Vertigo’, p.558)
• Orthostatic hypotension (see b ‘Orthostatic (postural) hypotension’,
p.118)
• Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
• Vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency
• Cervical spondylosis (see b ‘Cervical spondylosis and myelopathy’,
p.486)
• Anxiety and depression
In reality, much dizziness is multifactorial, with dysfunction in several
systems. This means that precise diagnosis is more difﬁcult (and often not
done) and treatment is more complex.
2Making small improvements to each contributing problem can add up
to a big overall improvement (perhaps making the difference between
independent living or institutional care).

DIZZINESS

HOW TO . . . Manage multifactorial dizziness—clinical
example
History
Mrs A is 85, and has fallen several times. She complains of dizziness, speciﬁcally she feels ‘muzzy in the head’, usually when standing. When this occurs,
if she sits down promptly it will pass, but often she doesn’t make it and her
legs ‘just give way’. She also feels ‘muzzy’ in bed sometimes when turning
over. Past medical history includes hypertension (she takes atenolol 100mg)
and osteoarthritis. She lives alone in unmodernized accommodation.
Examination
She is thin and has a kyphotic spine. Pulse is 50/min; supine blood pressure is 130/80, falling to 100/70 on standing. There is limited movement
at the hips and cervical spine. Neck movement causes unsteadiness.
Investigations
Blood tests are normal. ECG shows sinus bradycardia; X-rays show
severe degenerative change of the hip joints and cervical spine, with
some vertebral wedge fractures.
Diagnosis and treatment plan
This is a multifactorial problem. Some of the relevant factors include:
• Postural instability: caused by arthritis, kyphosis and low muscle mass
• Presyncope: caused by bradycardia and mild postural drop
• Possibly benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV)
• Extrinsic factors (eg poor lighting) are almost certainly contributing.
Approach this problem by listing each contributing factor, and identifying what can be done to improve it. For example:
Contributing
factor

Management

Osteoarthritis

Optimize analgesia
Consider referral for joint replacement
Physiotherapy (provision of walking aids; strength and balance
training)

Kyphosis

Consider bisphosphonate, calcium and vitamin D to prevent
progression
Walking aids will improve balance

Low muscle
mass

Take a dietary history
Consider nutritional supplements
Physiotherapy; encourage exercise

Bradycardia and
postural drop

Consider stopping (or reducing) atenolol
Monitor blood pressure

BPPV

Epley’s manoeuvre (see b ‘ HOW TO . . . Perform Epley’s
manoeuvre’, p.562)

Environment

Occupational therapy review to:
- Provide grab rails and perching stool
- Improve lighting and ﬂooring
- ‘De-clutter’ the home

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Drop attacks
This term refers to unexplained falls with no prodrome, no (or very brief)
loss of consciousness, and rapid recovery. The proportion of falls due to
‘drop attack’ increases with age.
There are several causes, including:
• Cardiac arrhythmia
• Carotid sinus syndrome
• Orthostatic hypotension
• Vasovagal syndrome
• Vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency (see b ‘Vertebrobasilar insufficiency
(VBI)’, p.117)
• Weak legs (eg cauda equina syndrome)
The ﬁrst four causes listed usually lead to syncope or presyncope, with
identiﬁable prior symptoms (eg dizziness, pallor); those episodes would
not be termed ‘drop attacks’. However, such prior symptoms are not universal, and may not be recollected, leading to a ‘drop attack’ presentation.
In most cases, following appropriate assessment, cause(s) can be
identiﬁed, and effective treatment(s) begun.
2Making a diagnosis of ‘drop attack’ alone is not satisfactory; assess more
completely, and where possible determine the likely underlying cause(s).

DROP ATTACKS

Vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency (VBI)
A collection of symptoms attributed to transient compromise of the
vertebrobasilar circulation. There is often associated compromise of the
anterior cerebral circulation.
Symptoms
These arise from functional impairment of the midbrain, cerebellum, or
occipital cortex, and can include:
• Abrupt onset, recurrent dizziness, or vertigo
• Nausea and/or vomiting
• Ataxia
• Visual disruption (diplopia, nystagmus)
• Dysarthria
• Limb paraesthesia
Causes
Impairment of the posterior cerebral circulation leads to VBI:
• Atherosclerosis of the vertebral or basilar arteries
• Vertebral artery compression by cervical spine osteophytes (due to
degenerative joint disease), at times triggered by neck movement
• Obstructing tumour
Diagnosis
This is based mainly on the history, supported if necessary by investigations. Invasive tests such as angiography are very rarely indicated
• Check for vascular risk factors (see b ‘Predisposing factors’, p.182)
• Cervical spine X-ray may show osteophytes, although these are
common and very non-speciﬁc
• CT brain may demonstrate tumour or ischaemic change. MRI is more
sensitive for posterior circulation ischaemic change
• MR angiography may reveal occlusive vertebral artery disease
• Doppler ultrasound (rarely) to examine vertebral artery ﬂow
Treatment
• Vascular secondary prevention measures (see b ‘Vascular secondary
prevention’, p.308)
• Where there is demonstrated posterior circulation stenosis, vessel
stenting may be performed in some centres
• Limiting neck movements, if these are a precipitant for symptoms,
can be useful. Soft collars can be worn, and act mainly as a reminder
to the patient to avoid rapid head turns
• There is no evidence that anticoagulants are effective

117

118

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Orthostatic (postural) hypotension
Orthostatic hypotension is common. About 20% of community-dwelling
and 50% of institutionalized older people are affected.
• An important, treatable cause of dizziness, syncope, near-syncope,
immobility, falls and fracture. Less frequently leads to visual disruption,
lethargy, neck- or backache
• Often most marked after meals, exercise, at night, and in a warm
environment, and abruptly precipitated by increased intrathoracic
pressure (cough, defecation, or micturition)
• Often episodic (coincidence of precipitants) and covert (ask direct
questions; walk or stand the patient and look for it). May occur several
minutes after standing

Diagnosis
Thresholds are arbitrary. A fall in BP of t20mmHg systolic or 10mmHg
diastolic on standing from supine is said to be signiﬁcant. Severity of symptoms often does not correlate well with objective BP change.

Causes
• Drugs (including vasodilators, diuretics, negative inotropes
or chronotropes (eg B-blockers, calcium channel blockers),
antidepressants, antipsychotics, opiates, levodopa, alcohol)
• Chronic hypertension (d baroreﬂex sensitivity and LV compliance)
• Volume depletion (dehydration, acute haemorrhage)
• Sepsis (vasodilation)
• Autonomic failure (pure, diabetic, Parkinson’s disease, etc.)
• Prolonged bed rest
• Adrenal insufﬁciency
• Raised intrathoracic pressure (bowel or bladder evacuation, cough)

Treatment
Treat the cause. Stop, reduce, or substitute drugs incrementally
Reduce consequences of falls (eg pendant alarms)
Modify behaviour: stand slowly and stepwise; lie down at prodrome
If salt or water deplete (eg diuretics, diarrhoea), supplement with:
• Na (liberal salting at table or NaCl tabs, eg Slow Sodium®
5–10g/day)
• Water (oral or intravenous (iv ﬂuid as isotonic dextrose or saline))
• Consider starting drugs if non-drug measures fail:
• Fludrocortisone (0.1–0.2mg/day)
• A-agonists, eg midodrine (2.5mg three times daily (tds), titrated to
maximum 40mg/day); unlicensed in UK; contraindicated in ischaemic
heart disease (IHD)
• Desmopressin 5–20micrograms nocte, intranasal
• In all cases, monitor electrolytes and for heart failure and supine
hypertension. Caution if supine BP rises >180mmHg systolic.
Dependent oedema alone is not a reason to stop treatment

•
•
•
•

ORTHOSTATIC (POSTURAL) HYPOTENSION

• The following may help:
• Full-length compression stockings
• Head-up tilt to bed (decreases nocturnal natriuresis)
• Caffeine (strong coffee with meals) or NSAIDs (l ﬂuid retention)
• Erythropoietin or octreotide

119

120

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Postprandial hypotension
Signiﬁcant when associated with symptoms and fall in BP t20mmHg within
75min of meals. A modest fall is normal (and usually asymptomatic) in
older people. Often more severe and symptomatic in hypertensive people
with orthostatic hypotension or autonomic failure.

Diagnosis
Measure BP before meals and at 30min and 60min after meal. Symptoms
and causes overlap with orthostatic hypotension.

Treatment
• Avoid hypotensive drugs and alcohol with meals
• Lie down or sit after meals
• Reduce osmotic load of meals (small frequent meals, low simple
carbohydrates, high ﬁbre/water content)
• Caffeine, ﬂudrocortisone, non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) and octreotide are used rarely

POSTPRANDIAL HYPOTENSION

HOW TO . . . Measure postural blood pressure
Lay the patient ﬂat for t5min
Measure lying blood pressure with a manual sphygmomanometer
Stand the patient upright rapidly, if necessary with assistance
Check BP promptly (within 30sec of standing)
Whilst standing, repeat systolic BP measurement continually—at
least every 30sec for >2min
6 Record:
• Supine BP
• Nadir of systolic and diastolic BP
• Symptoms

Note that:
• Lying-to-standing measurements are more sensitive than sittingto-standing or lying-to-sitting. The latter are sometimes all that is
possible for less mobile patients, even with assistance, but sensitivity
can be improved by hanging the legs over the side of the bed
• Consider repeat assessment at different times of day—OH is more
common after a meal and when relatively ﬂuid depleted (early
morning)
• Automatic (oscillometric) BP devices (eg ‘Dinamap’) should not be
used—they cannot repeat measurements rapidly, nor track a rapidly
changing BP
• Consider referral to a falls clinic for prolonged tilt table testing if
symptoms suggest syncope or near-syncope after more prolonged
standing

121

122

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Carotid sinus syndrome
Carotid sinus syndrome (CSS) is episodic, symptomatic bradycardia and/
or hypotension due to a hypersensitive carotid baroreceptor reﬂex,
resulting in syncope or near-syncope. It is an important and potentially
treatable cause of falls.
CSS is common in older patients, and rarely occurs under 50 years.
Series report a prevalence of 2% in healthy older people, and up to 35%
of fallers >80 years. It is a condition that has been identiﬁed recently,
and not all physicians are convinced that we fully understand the normal
responses of older people to carotid sinus massage or the signiﬁcance of
the spectrum of abnormal results.
Normally, in response to increased arterial BP, baroreceptors in the
carotid sinus act via the sympathetic nervous system to slow and weaken
the pulse, lowering blood pressure. This reﬂex typically blunts with age,
but in CSS, it is exaggerated, probably centrally. This hypersensitivity is
associated with increasing age, atheroma and the use of drugs that affect
the sinoatrial node (eg B-blockers, digoxin, and calcium channel blockers).

Typical triggers
•
•
•
•
•

Neck turning (looking up or around)
Tight collars
Straining (including cough, micturition and defecation)
Meals, ie post-prandial
Prolonged standing

Often, however, no trigger is identiﬁed.

Subtypes
• Cardioinhibitory (sinus pause of >3sec)
• Vasodepressor (BP fall >50mmHg)
• Mixed (both sinus pause and BP fall)

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is made when all three of the following factors are present:
• Unexplained attributable symptoms
• A sinus pause of >3sec and/or systolic BP fall of >50mmHg in response
to 5 sec of carotid sinus massage (see b ‘HOW TO. . . . Perform
carotid sinus massage’, p.123)
• Symptoms are reproduced by carotid sinus massage
CSS is often associated with other disorders (vasovagal syndrome and
orthostatic hypotension), probably due to shared pathogenesis (autonomic
dysfunction). This makes management more challenging.

Treatment
• Stop aggravating drugs where possible
• Pure cardioinhibitory carotid sinus hypersensitivity responds well to AV
sequential pacing, resolving symptoms in up to 80%
• Vasodepressor related symptoms are harder to treat (pathogenesis
is less well understood), but may respond to increasing circulating
volume with ﬂudrocortisone or midodrine (not licensed), as for
orthostatic hypotension

CAROTID SINUS SYNDROME

HOW TO . . . Perform carotid sinus massage
1 As this is a potentially hazardous procedure:
• Perform it in conditions that optimize test sensitivity—eg on a tilt
table, at a 70–80° tilt, massaging on the right hand side
• Ensure that resuscitation facilities are available (full cardiac arrest
trolley, another health professional close by, telephone)
2 Check for contraindications—do not perform after recent MI
(increased sensitivity), in cerebrovascular disease, or if there is a bruit
present unless carotid Doppler is normal
3 Advise the patient about possible side effects—arrhythmias (most
common if taking digoxin) and neurological symptoms (usually
transient, occurring in about 0.14% of tests)
4 The patient should be relaxed, with the head turned to the left, lying
on a couch with the body resting at 45° (or on a tilt table at 70–80°)
5 Attach the patient to a cardiac monitor with printing facility (to
provide documentary evidence of asystole). The fall in BP is usually
too brief to be detected by conventional (sphygmomanometric)
methods, but continuous (‘beat-to-beat’) blood pressure monitoring
(using, eg Portapres or Finapres devices) enables the detection of
pure vasodepressor CSS
6 Identify the carotid sinus—the point of maximal carotid pulsation in
the neck
7 Massage with steady pressure in a circular motion for 5–10sec
8 Look for asystole and/or hypotension during massage or shortly
(seconds) afterwards
9 If clinical suspicion is high, and the result of right-sided massage is
negative, repeat on the left side

CHAPTER 5

Falls and funny turns

Falls clinics
The assessment and secondary prevention of falls are complex processes
best performed by an experienced MDT with expert knowledge, functioning within a ‘falls clinic’.
Falls clinics have become much more common, initially a result of trials
showing the power of multidisciplinary interventions to reduce falls in
community-dwelling older people. More recently, the NSF has required
universal UK provision.
The team structure, diagnostic approach, and delivery of care varies
enormously, but there are broadly two complementary approaches taken
by falls clinics:
• Focus on identifying and reducing syncope and near-syncope, with
careful drug review and a low threshold to further investigation
including tilt table testing and arrhythmia detection
• More global approach in which cardiovascular evaluation is an
important but minor part of the assessment
Reﬂecting the differing approaches, some clinics (often those practising a
more medical model) take place in outpatient clinics, while others occur
in DHs and are more routinely multidisciplinary.
Falls clinics are often led and delivered by non-physician health
professionals such as experienced nurses, occupational therapists, and
physiotherapists. Screening for modiﬁable medical factors should be a
routine part of all assessments, with referral to a medical specialist (eg GP
with a special interest (GPSI) or geriatrician) if such factors are identiﬁed.

Referral criteria
Falls are so common that health services would be swamped if all who had
fallen were referred. Instead, refer those with more sinister features suggesting a likelihood of recurrent falls, injury or an underlying remediable
medical cause. Referral criteria might include:
• Recurrent (t2) falls
• Loss of consciousness, syncope, or near-syncope
• Injury, especially fracture or facial injury (the latter suggesting poor
saving mechanisms or loss of consciousness)
• Polypharmacy (t4 drugs)
Sources of patients include:
• ED (assess most people with non-operatively managed fractures)
• Acute orthopaedic units (hip and other operatively managed fractures)
• GP or community nurse
• Medical wards
• Self-presenting. Some services advertise directly, via posters and other
media

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Pharmacology in older patients
Perhaps the most common intervention performed by physicians is to
write a prescription. Older patients will have more conditions requiring
medication; polypharmacy is common.
In the developed world:
• The over 65s typically make up around 14% of the population yet
consume 40% of the drug budget
• 66% of the over 65s, and 87% of the over 75s are on regular
medication
• 34% of the over 75s are on three or more drugs
• Care home patients are on an average of eight medications
Good prescribing habits are essential for any medical practitioner, but
especially for the geriatrician.

Administration challenges include:
• Packaging may make tablets hard to access—childproof bottles and
tablets in blister packets can be impossible to open with arthritic hands
or poor vision
• Labels may be too small to read with failing vision
• Tablets may be large and difﬁcult to swallow (eg co-amoxiclav) or have
an unpleasant taste (eg potassium supplements)
• Liquid formulations can be useful, but accurate dosage becomes harder
(especially where manual dexterity is compromised)
• Any tablet needs around 60mL of water to wash it down and prevent
adherence to the oesophageal mucosa—a large volume for a frail
older person. Some tablets (eg bisphosphonates) require even larger
volumes
• Multiple tablets, with different instructions (eg before/after food) are
easily muddled up, or taken in a suboptimal way
• Some routes (eg topical to back) may be impossible without assistance

Absorption
• Many factors are different in older patients (increased gastric pH,
delayed gastric emptying, reduced intestinal motility and blood
ﬂow etc.)
• Despite this, absorption of drugs is largely unchanged with age—
exceptions include iron and calcium, which are absorbed more slowly

Distribution
• Some older people have a very low lean body mass, so if the
therapeutic index for a drug is narrow (eg digoxin) the dose should be
adjusted
• There is often an increased proportion of fat compared with water.
This reduces the volume of distribution for water-soluble drugs giving a
higher initial concentration (eg digoxin). It also leads to accumulation of
fat-soluble drugs, prolonging elimination and effect (eg diazepam)
• There is reduced plasma protein binding of drugs with age, which
increases the free fraction of protein-bound drugs such as warfarin and
furosemide

PHARMACOLOGY IN OLDER PATIENTS

Hepatic metabolism
• Speciﬁc hepatic metabolic pathways (eg conjugation) are unaffected
by age
• Reducing hepatic mass and blood ﬂow can impact on overall function
which slows metabolism of drugs (eg theophylline, paracetamol,
diazepam, nifedipine)
• Drugs that undergo extensive ﬁrst pass metabolism (eg propranolol,
nitrates) are most affected by the reduced hepatic function
• Many factors interact with liver metabolism (eg nutritional state, acute
illness, smoking, other medications, etc.)

Renal excretion
• Renal function declines with age (see b ‘The ageing kidney’, p.384),
which has a profound impact on the handling of drugs that are
predominantly handled renally
• Drugs, or drugs with active metabolites, that are mainly excreted in the
urine include digoxin, gentamicin, lithium, furosemide, and tetracyclines
• Where there is a narrow therapeutic index (eg digoxin,
aminoglycosides) then dose adjustment for renal impairment is
required (see UK British National Formulary (BNF) Appendix 3)
• Impaired renal function is exacerbated by dehydration and urinary
sepsis—both common in older patients

127

128

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Prescribing ‘rules’
1. Is it indicated?
Treatment of new symptom
Some symptoms trigger a reﬂex prescription (eg constipation—laxatives;
dizziness—prochlorperazine). Before starting a medication, consider:
• What is the diagnosis? (eg dizziness due to postural drop)
• Can something be stopped? (eg opioid analgesia causing constipation)
• Are there any non-drug measures? (eg increase ﬁbre for constipation)
Optimizing disease management
For example: a diagnosis of cardiac failure should trigger consideration of
loop diuretics, spironolactone, ACE inhibitors, and B-blockers.
• Ensure the diagnosis is secure before committing the patient to
multiple drugs (may be difﬁcult where there is no clear diagnostic gold
standard, eg with TIAs)
• Do not deny older patients disease modifying treatments simply to
avoid polypharmacy
• Do not deny treatment because of potential side effects—while
these may impact on functional ability, or cause signiﬁcant morbidity
(eg low blood pressure with B-blockade in cardiac failure) and need
to be discontinued, this should usually be after a trial of treatment with
careful monitoring
• Conversely, do not start treatment to improve mortality from a disease
if the patient has limited life span for other reasons (eg extreme frailty)
Preventative medication
For example: BP and cholesterol lowering.
• Limited evidence base in older patients—be guided by biological ﬁtness
• Ensure the patient understands the rationale for treatment

2. Are there any contraindications?
• Review past medical history (drug-disease interactions common)
• Contraindications often relative, so a trial of treatment may be
indicated, but warn patient, document risk and review impact
(eg ACE inhibitors when there is renal impairment)

3. Are there any likely interactions?
• Review the medication list
• Computer prescribing assists with drug–drug interactions, automatically
ﬂagging up potential problems

4. What is the best drug?
Choose the broad category of drug (eg which antihypertensive) by considering which will work best in this patient (eg ACE inhibitors work
less well in African Caribbeans), which is least likely to cause side effects
(eg calcium channel blockers may worsen cardiac failure) and is there any
potential for dual action? (eg a patient with angina could have a B-blocker
for both angina and blood pressure control).

PRESCRIBING ‘RULES’

Within each category of medication, there are many choices:
• Develop a personal portfolio of drugs with which you are very familiar
• Hospital formularies will often dictate choices within hospital
• Cost should be a consideration—eg simvastatin is ‘off patent’ and likely
to be cheaper than a newer statin
• Pharmaceutical companies will try to convince you of the beneﬁts of a
new brand. Unless this is a novel class of drug, it is likely that existing
brands have a greater proven safety record with similar beneﬁt. Older
patients have greater potential to suffer harm from new drugs, and are
unlikely to have been included in clinical trials. Time will tell if there are
real advantages—in general stick to what you know
2Never be the ﬁrst (or last) of your peers to use a new drug.

5. What dose should be started?
• ‘Start low and go slow’
• Drugs are usually better tolerated at lower doses, and can be
optimized if there are no adverse reactions
• In most cases, beneﬁt is seen with drug initiation, further increments of
beneﬁt occurring with dose optimization (eg ACE inhibitors for cardiac
failure, where 1.25mg ramipril is better than 10mg with a postural
drop)
• However, do not under treat—use enough to achieve the therapeutic
goal (eg for angina prophylaxis, a B-blocker dose should be adequate
to induce a mild bradycardia)

6. How will the impact be assessed?
Schedule follow-up looking for:
• Efﬁcacy of the drug eg has the bradykinesia improved with a dopamine
agonist? Medication for less objective conditions (eg pain, cognition)
requires careful questioning of patient and family/carers
• Any adverse events—reported by the patient spontaneously, elicited
by direct questioning (eg headache with dipyridamole) or by checking
blood tests where necessary (eg thyroid function on amiodarone)
• Any capacity to increase the dose to improve the effect (eg ACE
inhibitors in cardiac failure)

7. What is the time frame?
• Many older patients remain on medication for a long time. 88% of all
prescriptions in the over 65s are repeats. 60% of prescriptions are
active for over 2 years, 30% over 5 years, and 6% over 10 years
• This may be appropriate (eg with antihypertensives) and if so, the
patient should be aware of this and seek an ongoing supply from the GP
• Some drugs should never be prescribed long term (eg prochlorperazine,
night sedation)
• Medication should be regularly reviewed and discontinued if ineffective
or no longer indicated, eg some psychotropic medications (eg lithium,
depot antipsychotics) were intended for long-term use at initiation, but
the patient may have had no psychiatric symptoms for years (or even
decades). They can contribute to falls, and cautious withdrawal may be
indicated

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Taking a drug history
An accurate drug history includes the name, dose, timing, route, duration,
and indication for all medication. Studies have suggested that patients will
report their drug history accurately around half of the time, and this ﬁgure
falls with increasing age.

Reasons for problems arising
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Inadequate information to the patient at the time of prescribing
Multiple medications
Multiple changes if side effects develop
Use of both generic and brand names
Variable doses over time (eg dopa agonists, ACE inhibitors)
Cognitive and visual impairment
Over-the-counter drugs

Useful sources of information
• The patient’s actual drugs—they will often bring them along in a bag to
outpatients or when admitted
• Many seasoned patients will carry a list of their current medication—
written either by them or a healthcare professional
• Computer-generated print outs of current medication from the GP
• Dosette® and Nomad® systems will incorporate information about the
medication they contain
• A telephone call to the GP surgery will yield a list of active
prescriptions (but not over-the-counter medication)
• Family members will often know about medication, especially if they
help administer them
• Medical notes will often contain a list of medication at the last hospital
attendance
These can be extremely useful, but have limitations. A prescription issued
does not mean that it was necessarily dispensed, or that the medication
is being taken correctly and consistently. Previously prescribed medications may still be being taken and patients may occasionally use another
patient’s medication (eg a spouse).

Good habits
• Every time a patient is seen (in clinic, day hospital, admission, etc.) take
time to review the medication and make an up-to-date list
• Begin correspondence with a list of current medication
• If changes are made, or a new medication tried and not tolerated,
document the reason for this, and communicate this to all people
involved in care (especially the GP)
• Always include allergies and intolerances in the drug history

TAKING A DRUG HISTORY

Solutions
• Take the drug history with meticulous care—ask directly about:
• Inhalers
• Topical medication (creams, eye drops, patches, etc.)
• Occasional use medication
• Intermittent use medication (eg 3-monthly B12 injections, depot
antipsychotics, weekly bisphosphonates, etc.)
• Over-the-counter (non-prescription) medication—a growing
number of drugs are available (in the UK, including proton pump
inhibitors (PPIs) and statins)
• Herbal and traditional remedies
• Clarify how often occasional use medication is taken—analgesia may be
used very regularly, or not at all
• Be non-judgemental. If you suspect poor concordance (eg BP failing to
settle despite multiple prescriptions) then the following questions can
be useful to elicit an accurate response:
• ‘Have you managed to take all those tablets I suggested?’
• ‘Which tablets do you ﬁnd useful?’
• ‘Do any of the tablets disagree with you?’—if yes, then ‘How often
do you manage to take it?’
• ‘What triggers you to remember?’ (eg take with each meal, leave by
toothbrush, etc.)
• Scrutinize computer-generated lists carefully. Remember to look at
when the prescription was last issued and estimate when they would
be due to run out (eg 28 tablets to be taken once a day, last issued
3 months ago means that the drug has either run out, or not been
taken regularly)
• The gold standard is to ask the patient to bring in all of the medication
that they have at home—both old and new. Go through each
medication and ask them to explain which they take, and how often.
This allows:
• Comparison with a list of medication that they are supposed to be
taking
• Old drugs to be discarded (if necessary retain them and return to
pharmacy)
• Concordance to be estimated (by looking at date of dispensing and
number of tablets left)
• Clariﬁcation of doses, timings, and rationale for treatment. In a
less-pressured setting (eg DH) it is useful to generate a list for the
patient to carry with them (see Table 6.1 for example)
• Education of patient and family where needed (eg reason for taking)

131

132

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

HOW TO . . . Improve concordance
Simplify prescription regimens
• Convert to once-a-day dosing where possible (eg change captopril
tds to ramipril once daily (od))
• Try to prescribe medications to be taken at the same time of day—
this may challenge ﬁrmly held views (eg that warfarin must be taken
at night)
• Try to use medications that have dual indications for the patient
(eg B-blockade for both hypertension and angina)
• Consider a daily dose reminder system (eg Dosette® box) or a
monitored dosage system (eg Nomad®)
Educate the patient and family
• Do they understand the reason for taking the medication, and how
to take it correctly? Are there any problems the patient is attributing
to the medication (perhaps incorrectly)?
• Medication summaries (see Table 6.1) can assist with this
• Warn of predictable side effects that are likely to pass (eg nausea
with citalopram, headache with dipyridamole)
• Promote personal responsibility for medication—this should not be
something that the patient feels has been imposed
• Enlist support of family and carers in monitoring
Monitor
• Check tablet boxes and see if they are gone
• Look at how often a repeat prescription has been requested
• Some medications can have serum levels checked (eg digoxin,
phenytoin, lithium)
Some medications will produce changes detectable at physical examination
(eg bradycardia with B-blockade, black stool with iron therapy).

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Drug sensitivity
Altered sensitivity
Many older patients will have altered sensitivity to some drugs, for
example:
• Receptor responses may vary with age. Alterations in the function of
the cellular sodium/potassium pumps may account for the increased
sensitivity to digoxin seen in older people. Decreased B-adrenoceptor
sensitivity means that older patients mount less of a tachycardia when
given agonists (eg salbutamol) and may become less bradycardic with
B-blockers
• Altered coagulation factor synthesis with age leads to an increased
sensitivity to the effects of warfarin
• The ageing CNS shows increased susceptibility to the effects of many
centrally acting drugs (eg hypnotics, sedatives, antidepressants, opioid
analgesia, antiparkinsonian drugs, and antipsychotics)

Adverse reactions
Certain adverse reactions are more likely in older people, because of this
altered sensitivity:
• Baroreceptor responses are less sensitive, making symptomatic
hypotension more likely with antihypertensives
• Thirst responses are blunted, making hypovolaemia due to diuretics
more common
• Thermoregulation is blunted, making hypothermia more likely with
prolonged sedation
• Allergic responses to drugs are more common because of altered
immune responses

Drugs that may require dose adjustment in older patients
Despite the variations in drug handling, most drugs have a wide therapeutic
index, and there is no clinical impact.
Only drugs with a narrow therapeutic index or where older
patients may show very marked increased sensitivity may require dose
alteration:
• ACE inhibitors
• Aminoglycosides (dose determined by weight, and reduced if
impaired renal function)
• Diazepam (start with 2mg dose)
• Digoxin (low body weight older patients rarely require more than
62.5micrograms maintenance dose)
• Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
• Opiates (start with 1.25–2.5mg morphine to assess impact on CNS)
• Oral hypoglycaemics (increased sensitivity to hypoglycaemia with
decreased awareness—avoid long-acting preparations such as
glibenclamide, and start with lower doses of shorter-acting drugs,
eg gliclazide 40mg)
• Warfarin (load more cautiously)

ADVERSE DRUG REACTIONS

Adverse drug reactions
More common and complex with increasing age—up to three times more
frequent in the over 80s. Drug reactions account for considerable morbidity, mortality, and hospital admissions (one study estimated a quarter
of US hospital admissions relate to medication complications).
Older people are not a homogeneous group, and many will tolerate
medications as well as younger ones, but a number of factors contribute
to the increased frequency:
• Altered drug handling and sensitivity occur with age, made worse by
poor appetite, nutrition and ﬂuid intake
• Frailty and multiple diseases make drug–disease interactions more
common, for example:
• Anticholinergics may precipitate urine retention in a patient with
prostatic hypertrophy
• Benzodiazepines may precipitate delirium in a patient with dementia
• These relationships become even more complex when the large
numbers of drugs that are prescribed for multiple conditions interact
with the diseases as well as each other, eg an osteoporotic patient is
prescribed a bisphosphonate, then sustains a vertebral crush fracture
and is given a non-steroidal which exacerbates gastric irritation and
causes a gastrointestinal bleed
• Errors in drug taking make adverse reactions more likely. Mistakes
increase with:
• Increasing age
• Increasing numbers of prescribed drugs (20% of patients taking
three drugs will make errors, rising to 95% when 10 or more drugs
are taken)
• Cognitive impairment
• Living alone

Strategies to minimize adverse drug reactions
• Prescribe sensibly
• Consider possible drug–drug and drug–disease interactions whenever a
new drug is started
• Some drugs are associated with high rates of drug–drug interaction,
eg warfarin, amiodarone, SSRIs, antifungals, digoxin, phenytoin, and
erythromycin
• For every new problem, consider if an existing medication could be the
cause. Try to avoid the so-called prescribing cascade, where side effects
are treated with a new prescription, rather than discontinuing the
offending drug. If multiple medications are possible culprits then stop
one at a time and watch for improvement
• Optimize concordance
• Use extreme caution at times of care transfer as information is often
lost

135

136

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

ACE inhibitors
Common indications include blood pressure control, vascular risk reduction, heart failure, and diabetic nephropathy.

Cautions
Renal disease
• Use ACE inhibitors with extreme caution if there is a known history of
renal artery stenosis, as renal failure can be precipitated. If the clinical
suspicion of this is high (renal bruit, uncontrolled hypertension that is
unexplained) then consider investigating for renal asymmetry with an
ultrasound before starting treatment
• Renal impairment per se is not a reason to withhold ACE inhibitors
(indeed they are effective treatment for some types) although the dose
may need to be reduced
• Monitor renal function before and after treatment. Sudden
deterioration may indicate renal artery stenosis, and the ACE should
be stopped pending investigation
• If a patient becomes unwell (dehydrated, septic, etc.) they may need
temporary withdrawal of the ACE inhibitor
Hypotension
• Early ACE inhibitors (eg captopril) were associated with a risk of ﬁrst
dose hypotension, and so many patients were given an in-hospital test
dose
• This is rare with newer ACE inhibitors, and cautious outpatient
initiation is acceptable
• Older patients are more prone to postural hypotension. Check blood
pressure lying and standing, and ask about postural symptoms (eg lightheadedness)
• The risk of hypotension is greater with volume-depleted patients—eg
those on high dose diuretics, on renal dialysis, dehydrated from
intercurrent illness or in severe cardiac failure. Correct dehydration
before initiation where possible
• ACE inhibitor induced hypotension is common in patients with severe
aortic stenosis, and they should probably be avoided (unless under
cardiological supervision)
• ‘Start low, and go slow’. Monitor carefully. This may take multiple clinic
visits, but avoids complications
Cough
• Many ACE inhibitors cause a persistent dry cough. Always warn the
patient about this, as it can cause considerable distress. Forewarned
is forearmed, and many patients will be prepared to accept this side
effect if the ACE inhibitor is the best choice for them
• Changing to an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) removes the cough
in most cases, but ARBs are not quite as effective in terms of risk
reduction

ACE INHIBITORS

Hyperkalaemia
• There is a risk of hyperkalaemia when ACE inhibitors are used with
potassium-sparing diuretics, eg spironolactone (in heart failure) or with
non-steroidals
• Be aware, and monitor electrolytes. Most tolerate a potassium of up to
5.5mmol/L
• The tendency to hyperkalaemia can be useful in patients who are also
on potassium-losing diuretics (eg furosemide) as the two may balance
each other out—overall hypokalaemia is more common in patients
with heart failure

HOW TO . . . Start ACE inhibitors
• Screen for contraindications
• Check baseline renal function and electrolytes
• Warn patient about possible cough and postural symptoms

An example of initiation/titration is as follows
Week 1
Start ramipril 1.25mg at night.
Week 2
Check renal function, blood pressure (lying and standing) and check for
postural symptoms.
Week 4
Increase ramipril to 2.5mg at night.
Week 6
Check renal function, blood pressure (lying and standing) and check for
postural symptoms.
Week 8
Increase ramipril to 5mg at night.
Continue titrating the dose upwards as tolerated, but most older
patients will develop postural symptoms at higher doses, increasing the
risk of falls. The goal should be for safe optimization.
Once established on an ACE inhibitor, periodic renal monitoring is
sensible (perhaps annually).

If a patient becomes acutely unwell
• Dehydration increases susceptibility to ACE inhibitor induced renal
failure and hypotension
• Correct the dehydration ﬁrst—treat cause, give ﬂuid
supplementation, and stop diuretics
• Temporary cessation of ACE inhibitor may be needed if dehydration
prolonged (>24hr)
• Monitor renal function daily
• Remember to restart the ACE inhibitor after recovery

137

138

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Amiodarone
Indications include rate control and prevention of supraventricular cardiac
arrhythmias (commonly AF) and prevention of paroxysmal ventricular
arrhythmias.
Intravenous amiodarone is now included on the advanced life support
protocols for cardiac arrest (M www.resus.org.uk).

Cautions
• Interacts with many drugs, including warfarin (often co-prescribed
for AF stroke prophylaxis; amiodarone increases warfarin effect) and
statins (increased incidence of myopathy with higher statin doses)
• Can cause deranged TFTs in either direction. Baseline thyroid function
should be taken before initiation and then at 6-monthly intervals.
Measure TSH, free T4 and free T3—see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage
amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction’, p.139
• Nausea and anorexia are common (730%), and may respond to dose
reduction. Less frequently, liver function becomes deranged—check at
baseline and every 6 months; hepatitis may reverse with dose reduction
• Photosensitivity can occur, so amiodarone is unlikely to be suitable for
avid gardeners or outdoor workers
• Corneal microdeposits often occur (90%), that can cause a glare with
night driving (if this is likely to be a problem then avoid amiodarone);
microdeposits are reversible, and do not threaten vision
• Pulmonary problems may occur (ﬁbrosis, alveolitis, pneumonitis).
They are the most serious amiodarone-related side effects, and often
occur early (months). Any new respiratory symptoms should trigger
clinical assessment, CXR, and pulmonary function tests
• Peripheral neuropathy may occur—be alert for early signs of this and
stop the drug promptly to avoid progression

Starting oral amiodarone
1 Check TFTs and LFTs
2 Load with:
• Week one—200mg tds
• Week two—200mg twice daily (bd)
3 From week 3 onwards use the maintenance dose of 200mg od
4 See the patient at 6–8 weeks intervals to check for adverse effects and
efﬁcacy
5 Check TFTs and LFTs at 6-month intervals
6 In the longer term, the dose may be reduced further in frail older
patients to 100mg od (or even alternate days) without losing efﬁcacy,
as the half-life is extremely long

Overview
Despite this long list of side effects and cautions, amiodarone is often welltolerated and effective in older patients. It is less negatively inotropic than
many alternative antiarrhythmics, and is excreted primarily by the liver; it
therefore has a useful part to play.

AMIODARONE

HOW TO . . . Manage amiodarone-induced thyroid
dysfunction
Amiodarone contains 37% iodide, which impacts on thyroid homeostasis,
causing alterations in TFTs in up to 50% of patients.

Early amiodarone changes
• Alterations in TFTs in a euthyroid patient most common
• Usually high TSH or decreased thyroxine (T4) concentrations
• This is typically transient, resolves after about 3 months and does not
indicate that hypothyroidism has occurred
• Monitor at 3-monthly intervals

Changes with longer-term amiodarone therapy include
Euthyroid changes
• Minor increase in T4
• Suppression of triiodothyronine (T3)
• Suppression of TSH
• Manage by monitoring thyroid function every 6 months
Hyperthyroidism
• More common when there is occult underlying thyroid disease and in
areas with low oral iodine intake (up to 12% incidence)
• Diagnose with increased free T3 and free T4 with suppressed TSH
concentrations
• Withdraw amiodarone where possible
• No immediate improvement as amiodarone has a long half-life
• Where amiodarone needs to be continued, this can be treated
with carbimazole as for standard hyperthyroidism. May be resistant.
Adding steroids may help
• Amiodarone can also cause a destructive thyroiditis, releasing
thyroid hormone into the circulation and causing hyperthyroidism.
Treatment is with high-dose steroids
Hypothyroidism
• More common in areas with low iodine intake (up to 13% incidence)
• Diagnose with decreased free T3 and free T4 concentrations with
elevated TSH concentrations
• An elevated TSH alone is not diagnostic—may be transient,
especially in the ﬁrst three months of treatment. If the patient is well,
recheck in 3 months
• Amiodarone withdrawal is rarely necessary. Adding levothyroxine
sodium will correct the problem

139

140

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Analgesia
Older patients are more likely to suffer chronic pain than younger ones,
owing to the increased frequency of conditions such as osteoarthritis,
osteoporosis, etc.
Pain management is more challenging and a standard ‘pain ladder’
approach not always useful because of the altered sensitivity of the older
patient to certain classes of analgesic medication.

Non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
Includes aspirin (especially at analgesic doses).
Potential problems
• Fluid retention causing worsening hypertension, cardiac failure, and
ankle swelling
• Renal toxicity—risk of acute tubular necrosis, exacerbated by
intercurrent infection, or dehydration
• Peptic ulceration and gastrointestinal bleeding—there is an increased
risk with increased age, and the bleeds tend to be more signiﬁcant
2The number of older patients requiring hospitalization because of
NSAID-induced deterioration in renal or cardiac function actually exceeds
the number with gastrointestinal bleeds.
• Age itself is probably not an independent risk factor for most
complications of NSAID treatment, but factors such as comorbidities,
co-medications, hydration, nutritional status and frailty are linked to an
increased risk, all of which are more common with advancing age
Guidance for use in older patients
• NSAIDs should be used with extreme caution in older patients, and
avoided altogether in the very frail
• Should be given for a short period only
• Use low-dose moderate potency NSAIDs (eg ibuprofen 0.6g/day)
• Avoid using two NSAIDs together (this includes low-dose aspirin)
• Consider co-prescription of a gastric-protective agent (eg omeprazole)
for the duration of the therapy
• Avoid using ACE inhibitors and NSAIDs together—they have opposing
effects on ﬂuid handling, and are likely to cause renal toxicity in
combination

Opioid analgesia
Wide range of drugs sharing many common features, but with qualitative
and quantitative differences.
Potential problems include constipation, nausea and vomiting, anorexia,
confusion, drowsiness, and respiratory depression.
Guidance for use in older patients
• Most of these are dose dependant, and careful up-titration will obtain
the right balance of analgesic effect and adverse effects
• Constipation is common (worse in older people) but can be managed
with good bowel care
• Most adverse effects are reversible once the medication is reduced or
discontinued

ANALGESIA

HOW TO . . . Manage pain in older patients
Diagnose the cause
Chronic abdominal pain may be due to constipation that will respond to
bowel care rather than analgesia.
Consider non-drug measures
• Weight loss and physical activity helps with many pains (eg arthritis)
• Temperature treatments (eg hot/cold packs applied to painful joint)
• TENS machines
• Alternative therapies (eg acupuncture, aromatherapy) can help
• Avoidance of (non-essential) activity that provokes pain if possible
Consider targeted therapy
For example: topical capsaicin for post-herpetic neuralgia, local nerve
blocks for regional pain, massage for musculoskeletal pain, joint replacement for arthritic pain, or radiotherapy for pain from bony metastases
Regular paracetamol
• Well-tolerated and with few side effects
• Before moving from this, ensure that the maximum dose is being
taken regularly (ie 1g taken four times a day) for optimal analgesic
effect. Many patients will ﬁnd taking an occasional paracetamol
ineffective—explain that regular dosing increases analgesic effect
Opioid analgesia
• Second line therapy in most older patients
• Options to deal with mild (eg codeine, dihydrocodeine), moderate
(eg tramadol) and severe pain (eg morphine, diamorphine, fentanyl)
• Compound preparations are useful when adding an opioid to regular
paracetamol, as it limits the number of tablets taken. Co-codamol
(codeine and paracetamol) has variable doses of codeine (8mg, 15mg,
or 30mg per tablet) allowing up titration of the opioid component
• All affect same receptors, so use as a continuum—if regular maximum
dose codeine is not working, then step up to the next level of opioid
strength (eg if 60mg codeine four times daily (qds) is not sufﬁcient
then change to tramadol 50mg qds or morphine sulphate M/R 5mg bd)
• Various formulations for the delivery of strong opiates. Liquids
are useful if there are swallowing problems (eg morphine sulphate
solution). Slow-release tablets (eg morphine sulphate M/R) and
transdermal patches (eg fentanyl) provide constant analgesic
effect for continuous pain. Parenteral opiates are used in terminal
care (subcutaneous injections of morphine and diamorphine for
intermittent pain; 24hr infusion pumps for constant pain)
• Monitor for side effects—active bowel care with initiation
Other drug options
• Very ﬁt older patients can be given short courses of NSAIDs
• Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors have a limited role
Psychological factors
• Depression is often coexistent (consequent or causal). Treatment
can help with overall pain management
• Informal (‘positive mental attitude’) and formal psychotherapeutic
approaches may be preferable to side effects of analgesic medication

141

142

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Steroids
Oral steroids (usually prednisolone) are given for many conditions in
older patients, commonly COPD exacerbation, polymyalgia rheumatica,
rheumatoid arthritis, and colitis. Treatment may be long term. Although
the beneﬁts of treatment usually outweigh the risks, awareness of these
can minimize harm. Discuss likely side effects with patients and carers.

Cautions
• Osteoporosis—this is most marked in the early stages of treatment.
Older people will have diminishing bone reserves anyhow, and there
is a strong argument for putting all steroid-treated older patients on
bone protection at outset, unless the course is certain to be very short
(eg less than 2 weeks). This should consist of daily calcium and vitamin
D, along with a bisphosphonate (weekly preparations eg alendronate
70mg, improve concordance)
• Steroids can precipitate impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes.
Monitor sugar levels periodically (eg weekly capillary blood sugar,
or urinalysis) in all steroid users. Steroids worsen control in known
diabetics, necessitating more frequent monitoring
• Hypertension may develop because of the mineralocorticoid effect of
prednisolone, and this should be checked for regularly
• Skin changes occur, and are particularly noticeable in older patients
with less resilient skin. Purpura, bruising, thinning, and increased fragility
are common
• Muscle weakness occurs with prolonged use, dominantly proximal in
distribution. This leads to problems rising from chairs, climbing stairs
etc. and may be the ﬁnal straw for a frail older person with limited
physical reserve. (See b ‘Muscle symptoms’, p.478)
• There is an increased susceptibility to infections on steroids, and the
presentation may be less acute, making diagnosis more difﬁcult.
Candidiasis (oral and genital) is particularly common and should be
treated promptly
• High doses (as used in treatment of giant cell arteritis) can cause acute
confusion and sleep disturbance, and older people are particularly prone.
Give steroids in the morning if possible
• Cataracts may develop with long-term steroid use. If vision declines,
look for cataracts with an ophthalmoscope and consider specialist
referral
• Peritonitis may be masked by steroid use—the signs being less evident
clinically. Have a higher index of suspicion of occult perforation in a
steroid-treated older patient with abdominal pain. There is also a weak
association between steroid use and peptic ulceration
• Adrenocortical suppression means that the stress response will be
diminished in chronic steroid users. If such a patient becomes acutely
unwell (eg septic), the exogenous steroid dose will need to be
temporarily increased (eg double the usual oral dose, replace with
intramuscular hydrocortisone if unable to take by mouth). Suppression
can continue for months after stopping chronic steroids; have a low
threshold for ‘covering’ acute illness

STEROIDS

Stopping treatment
Many patients are on fairly low doses of steroids for a long period. It
can be difﬁcult to completely tail the dose, as steroid withdrawal effects
(fevers, myalgia, etc.) can often be mistaken for disease recurrence, and
this often needs to be done very slowly (perhaps reducing by as little as
1mg a month). There is no such thing as a ‘safe’ dose of steroid so, for
every patient you see on steroids, ask the following:
• Can the dose be reduced?
• Could a steroid sparing agent (eg azathioprine) be used instead?
• Is the patient taking adequate bone protection?
• What is the blood pressure and blood glucose?

143

144

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Warfarin
Common indications range from absolute (PE, DVT, artiﬁcial heart valve
replacement) to relative (stroke prophylaxis in AF).

Cautions
• Risk is increased if the patient is unable to take medication reliably, so
is not suitable without supervision for cognitively impaired patients, or
those who self-neglect. If there is an absolute indication, then consider
supervised therapy (by spouse, family, or carers via a dispensing
system) or (rarely) a course of low molecular weight heparin instead
• Risk is higher if there is a high probability of trauma, eg recurrent falls
• Excess alcohol consumption is associated with poor concordance and
falls. Liver enzymes are induced, making control of anticoagulation
more difﬁcult. Highly variable intake is especially problematic
• Comorbidity may increase sensitivity to warfarin (eg abnormal liver
function, congestive cardiac failure) and should be screened for
• GPs will often be good judges of risk—consider discussing borderline
cases

Side effects
• Bleeding is the major adverse event, ranging from an increased
tendency to bruise to major life-threatening bleeds. The most
signiﬁcant include intracerebral haemorrhage and gastrointestinal blood
loss.
• Warfarin does not cause gastric irritation, but may accelerate
blood loss from pre-existing bleeding sources. Ask carefully about
history of non-steroidal use (including aspirin) and gastrointestinal
symptoms (upper and lower). If any are present then quantify
risk with further testing—full blood count and iron studies might
indicate occult blood loss. If the warfarin is not essential, then a full
gastrointestinal work-up may be appropriate before starting in the
ﬁtter patients. In frailer patients, consider warfarin with empirical PPI
• Nosebleeds are common in older patients, and may become more
signiﬁcant on warfarin. Often due to friable nasal vessels that are
amenable to treatment by ENT surgeons, so reducing the risk of
epistaxis on warfarin

Reassessment of risk/beneﬁt balance
• Patients often take warfarin for many years
• During that time, there is usually change in both the risk (serious
bleeding) and the beneﬁt (reduced thromboembolism) of
anticoagulation. The most common scenario is that the antithrombotic
beneﬁt of anticoagulation remains, but that the bleeding risk increases
and cannot be reduced—eg a patient falls frequently despite
intervention, or has a major bleed that could recur (eg diverticular)
• Any drug must be stopped unless there is a net beneﬁt to the
individual patient. In conjunction with patient (and carer), the indication
for warfarin should be reviewed periodically; perhaps annually in frail
older people, and after any signiﬁcant event, eg hip fracture

What to do when the INR is too high
• Always look for the reason why the INR became elevated and correct
this factor
• If there is no sign of bleeding, then stop warfarin and monitor the INR
as it falls
• If the INR >8 but there is no bleeding, a small dose of vitamin K
(0.5–2.5mg) can be given to partially reverse the INR
• Do not give vitamin K routinely as control of anticoagulation will be
made more difﬁcult for weeks afterwards
• If there is bleeding, then the warfarin needs reversing with vitamin K
and fresh frozen plasma
• For life-threatening bleeds (eg intracerebral haemorrhage)
prothrombin complex concentrate can be used for rapid reversal
2If a patient bleeds at target INR, always consider the possibility of
underlying serious disease, eg bladder or gastrointestinal malignancy.

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

HOW TO . . . Initiate warfarin
Discuss risks and beneﬁts of treatment with the patient—the indication
is rarely absolute.

Ensure the patient is told
• There will be frequent blood tests and monitoring
• Many medications interact with warfarin, so before taking any new
medication (including over the counter), always check compatibility
with the doctor, dentist, or pharmacist
• Use paracetamol or codeine-based analgesia (never NSAIDs)
• Alcohol interacts with warfarin metabolism, and should be taken in
moderation and on a regular basis (avoid binge drinking)
• Vitamin K-containing foods (eg spinach) should not have variable
intake
• If trauma occurs, bleeding may last longer. Apply pressure to wounds
and seek medical help if it does not stop
• Give the patient an anticoagulant treatment book that will hold
details of their treatment schedule and reinforce the information that
you give them

Induction
• Check baseline clotting
• Prescribe warfarin to be taken at 6pm
• Medical notes should state indication, target INR, and duration of
therapy
• The normal adult induction dose (10mg day 1, 10mg day 2, then an
INR) is rarely appropriate in older patients who are more sensitive
to its effects
• Reduce the dose if the patient is frail, has a low body weight, has
multiple comorbidities, or a deranged baseline clotting
• For most older patients 5mg /5mg /INR is a safer approach
• If there are multiple factors causing concern, then 5mg /INR is better
2There is no rush. If the indication is absolute, then the patient should
also be on therapeutic heparin until the INR is in range. It is much easier
to increase the dose of warfarin, than to deal with bleeding from an
overdose.
• The INR will then need checking daily, then alternate days until a
pattern becomes clear
• Many haematology departments will offer automatic dosing with a
schedule for retesting
• The INR testing can gradually be done less frequently, stretching to
12-weekly in long-term users
• Induction in hospital is now often done by anticoagulation teams

WARFARIN

HOW TO . . . Manage drug-induced skin rashes
Common side effect in older patients—thought to be due to altered
immune function. Rarely life-threatening, but cause considerable distress.

Make the diagnosis
• Variable in appearance, but most commonly toxic erythema—
symmetrical, erythematous, itchy rash, trunk > extremities, lesions
may be measles-like, urticarial, or resemble erythema multiforme
• Certain drugs may produce predictable eruptions:
• Acneiform rash with lithium
• Bullous lesions with furosemide
• Target lesions with penicillins and phenytoin
• Psoriasis-like rash with B-blockers
• Urticaria with penicillin, opiates and aspirin
• Fixed drug eruption (round purple plaques recurring in the
same spot) with paracetamol, laxatives, sulphonamides, and
tetracyclines
• Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, serious reaction to drugs such as
non-steroidals, allopurinol, and phenytoin. The skin appears scalded,
and large areas of epidermis may shear off causing problems with
ﬂuid and electrolyte balance, thermoregulation, and infection
• Take a careful drug history to elicit a temporal relationship to
medication administration—eg within 3 days of starting a new drug
(may be as long as 3 weeks), or becoming worse every morning after
a regular drug is given

Stop the drug
• Stop multiple medications one at a time (stop drugs started closest
to the onset of the rash ﬁrst), and watch for clinical improvement
• May get slightly worse before improving
• Usually clears within 2 weeks
• Advise the patient to avoid the drug in the future

Soothe the skin
• Emollients, cooling agents (eg calamine) and weak topical steroids
may help
• Oral antihistamines are often given with variable success. Sedating
antihistamines (eg hydroxyzine) may help sleep

Treat the complications
More likely if extensive and prolonged.
Risks include:
• Hypothermia
• Hypovolaemia
• Secondary infection
2Consider dermatology referral if not improving after 2 weeks off the
suspected drug.

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Proton pump inhibitors
PPIs (eg omeprazole, lansoprazole) are very effective in reducing gastric
acid secretion and therefore in treating peptic ulcers and gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease (GORD). They are perceived as very safe drugs. The
combination of effectiveness and safety has led to them being one of the
most commonly prescribed drug classes.
However, PPIs are often prescribed without an appropriate indication,
or are initiated appropriately but not discontinued after a treatment
course. Overall, over 50% of PPI use is unnecessary.

Side effects
• Common side effects are headache, nausea, diarrhoea, and constipation
• Infrequent idiosyncratic reactions include acute interstitial nephritis,
erythema multiforme, pancreatitis, microscopic colitis, hyponatraemia,
ad hypomagnesaemia
• Hydrochloric acid aids protein digestion and absorption of vitamin B12
and calcium, and is active against pathogens. PPI use is associated with:
• Community and hospital incidence of CDAD and increased
likelihood of recurrence
• Enteric bacterial infections (eg Salmonella, Campylobacter)
• Community- and hospital-acquired pneumonia
• Long-term use is associated with higher rates of hip fracture, possibly
caused by altered calcium absorption

Interactions
There are a few important interactions:
• The effects of phenytoin and warfarin are enhanced
• The effects of clopidogrel are reduced
• Plasma concentrations of digoxin are increased slightly

Appropriate prescribing
• Always specify the indication for treatment and its intended duration
• In GORD, always ﬁrst address non-drug factors (obesity, alcohol) and
consider the use of less potent acid-suppression (eg H2 antagonists
such as ranitidine)
• Transient dyspepsia or occasional heartburn are inadequate indications
for long-term PPI treatment
• In primary care, review the need for the drug periodically
• In secondary care, be careful not to extend an initial appropriate PPI
prescription for prophylaxis against gastrointestinal bleeding
• In (conﬁrmed or possible) CDAD, consider stopping PPIs

HERBAL MEDICINES

Herbal medicines
Use of herbal supplements by older adults is common (some studies estimate 30–50%). Most patients do not discuss this with their doctors so
remember to ask. Herbal medicines are not regulated like drugs, contain
variable quantities of active ingredient and may contain impurities. Herbal
medicines have adverse effects and drug interactions (Table 6.3).

CHAPTER 6

Drugs

Breaking the rules
A great deal of prescribing in geriatric practice relies on individually tailored assessment and pragmatic decision making. While what is described
in the preceding pages is appropriate for many, there are times when
‘rules must be broken’ in the best interests of the individual patient. This
requires careful consideration of risks and beneﬁts; the patient should
usually be reviewed to assess the impact of the decision.
Polypharmacy can cause problems, but is sometimes appropriate—
depriving patients of beneﬁcial treatments because they are old, or
already on multiple other medications, can also be wrong. In a recent
study of medication changes during a geriatric admission, the total number
of drugs was the same at admission and discharge, but they had often
been changed. In other words, there was active evaluation of medication
going on—the goal being not just to limit the number of drugs, but also to
optimize and individually tailor treatment.
Where side effects are very likely, but the drug is deﬁnitely indicated,
then it may be appropriate to co-prescribe something to treat the
expected adverse effect, for example:
• Steroids and bisphosphonates
• Opiates and laxatives
• Furosemide and a potassium-sparing diuretic (or an ACE inhibitor)
• Non-steroidals and a gastric protection agent
Whilst certain disease-drug interactions are very likely, and should be
avoided, others may be an acceptable risk. For example:
• B-blockers:
• Are to be used with caution with asthma, yet they have such a good
impact with on cardiovascular risk reduction that these cautions
are not absolute. Often the ‘asthma’ is in fact COPD with little
B-receptor reactivity, so cautious B-blockade initiated in hospital
whilst monitoring the lung function may be appropriate
• Can reduce the signs of hypoglycaemia in diabetics, but
cardiovascular disease is common in people with diabetes, and the
risks of treatment are usually outweighed by the beneﬁts
• In patients with peripheral vascular disease can cause a small
reduction in walking distance, but this risk is usually outweighed by
the reduction in the risk of cardiac death
• Fludrocortisone (for postural hypotension) will worsen supine
hypertension and cause ankle swelling. But if postural symptoms
are severe then it may be appropriate to accept hypertension and
associated risk
• Amlodipine may worsen ankle swelling in a patient with chronic
venous insufﬁciency, but if this is the best way of controlling
hypertension, it may be appropriate to accept a cosmetic problem

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

The ageing brain and nervous system
As in other systems intrinsic ageing (occurs in all) is often hard to distinguish
from extrinsic ageing mechanisms (caused by disease processes). See b
‘Cognitive ageing’, p.204 for discussion of cognitive ageing.
Histological changes in the brain include:
• Each neuron has fewer connecting arms (dendrites)
• Around 20% of brain volume and weight are lost by the age of 85
• There is deposition of pigment (lipofuscin) in the cells and oxidative
damage in mitochondria
• The presence of senile plaques and neuroﬁbrillary tangles increases
with age but they are not diagnostic of dementia (Table 7.1)
Table 7.1 Age-related changes to the nervous system
Age-related change

Consequence

Loss of neurons (cannot be
regenerated)

Cerebral atrophy common on brain scans
(although this does not correlate well with
cognitive function)

Decrease in brain weight
(by around 20% at age 85)
Some neurons become
demyelinated and have slowed
nerve conduction speed and
increased latency (time taken to
recover before transmitting next
impulse)

Reﬂexes which have long nerve tracts,
eg ankle jerks, can be diminished or lost

Neurotransmitter systems alter,

Increased susceptibility to some
neuromodulating drugs

eg cholinergic receptors decrease
Increasing frequency of
periventricular white matter
changes seen on cerebral imaging

Minor sensory loss, eg ﬁne touch/vibration
sense, may be lost distally

Probably not a normal ﬁnding
Signiﬁcance unclear—assumed to be
representative of small-vessel vascular
disease but poor postmortem correlation

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Tremor
Tremor is more common with increasing age. It can be disabling and/or
socially embarrassing. It is important to try to make a diagnosis as treatment is available in some cases.
Examine the patient ﬁrst at rest and distracted (relaxed with arms
supported on lap, count backwards from 10), then with outstretched
hands and ﬁnally during movement (pointing or picking up a small object).
Tremors fall roughly into three categories
1. Rest tremor—disappears on movement and is exaggerated by
movement of the contralateral side of the body. Commonest cause—
Parkinson’s disease. It is usually associated with increased tone
2. Postural tremor—present in outstretched limbs, may continue during
action but disappears at rest. Commonest cause—benign essential
tremor
3. Action tremor—exaggerated with movement. When the tremor
is maximal at extreme point of movement it is called an intention
tremor. Commonest cause—cerebellar dysfunction

Benign essential tremor
• The classic postural tremor of old age, worse on action (eg static at
rest but spills tea from teacup) may have head nodding (titubation) or
jaw/vocal tremor, legs rarely affected. May be asymmetrical
• About half the cases have a family history (autosomal dominant)
• Presents in middle age, occasionally earlier and worsens gradually
• Often more socially embarrassing than physically impairing
• Improved by alcohol, gabapentin, primidone and B-blockers but these
often unacceptable treatments in the long term. Worth considering
B-blockers as ﬁrst choice in treatment with coexistent hypertension
• Weighted wristbands can reduce tremor and improve function

Parkinson’s disease (see b ‘Parkinson’s disease: presentation’, p.158)
Cerebellar dysfunction
The typical intention tremor is associated with ataxia.
• Acute onset is usually vascular in older patients
• Subacute presentations occur with tumours (including paraneoplastic
syndrome), abscesses, hydrocephalus, drugs (eg anticonvulsants),
hypothyroidism or toxins
• Chronic progressive course is seen with:
• Alcoholism (due to thiamine deﬁciency—always give thiamine
100mg od orally or iv preparation if in doubt, it might be reversible)
• Anticonvulsant (eg phenytoin—may be irreversible if severe,
commoner with high plasma levels but can occur with long-term use
at therapeutic levels)
• Paraneoplastic syndromes (anti-cerebellar antibodies can be found,
eg anti-Yo and anti-Hu found in cancer of ovary and bronchus)
• Multiple sclerosis
• Idiopathic cerebellar atrophy
• Many cases defy speciﬁc diagnosis. Consider multisystem atrophy

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Neuropathic pain/neuralgia
This describes pain originating from nerve damage/inﬂammation. It is
often very severe and debilitating and seems to be more common in older
people. The pain is usually sharp/stabbing and is often intermittent being
precipitated by things like movement and cold.

Post-herpetic neuralgia
• Severe burning and stabbing pain in a division of nerve previously
affected by shingles
• Shingles and subsequent persisting neuralgia is much more common in
older patients
• Pain may be triggered by touch or temperature change
• May go on for years, be difﬁcult to treat and have major impact on
quality of life
• Prevent by starting antivirals within 72hr of rash (eg famciclovir)
• See b ‘HOW TO . . . Treat neuralgia’, p.157 for treatment

Trigeminal neuralgia
Severe unilateral stabbing facial pain, usually V2, V3 rather than V1
Triggers include movement, temperature change, etc.
Time course—years with relapse/remission
Depression and weight loss can result
Differential diagnoses include temporal arteritis, toothache, parotitis
and temporomandibular joint arthritis
• Consider neuroimaging especially if there are physical signs, ie sensory
loss or other cranial nerve abnormality suggestive of secondary
trigeminal neuralgia
• Bilateral trigeminal neuralgia suggests multiple sclerosis
• See b ‘HOW TO . . . Treat neuralgia’, p.157 for treatment

Neuralgia can also occur with
• Malignancy
• Cord compression
• Neuropathy

NEUROPATHIC PAIN/NEURALGIA

HOW TO . . . Treat neuralgia
This can be very debilitating and treatment is difﬁcult. There is often
coexistent depression, so always think of this and treat appropriately.

Simple measures include
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Distraction
Relaxation techniques
Allaying fears (usually about serious underlying pathology)
Acupuncture
Heat/cold treatment
Osteopathy/massage (to reduce associated muscle spasm)
Use of TENS machines (transcutaneous nerve stimulation)
Support groups, eg M www.tna.org.uk

Medications
• Topical treatments, eg lidocaine, capsaicin
• Traditional analgesics (paracetamol, NSAIDs, opiates) although these
are usually not very effective
• Anti-spasticity drugs, eg baclofen. Used especially in trigeminal
neuralgia, they treat any muscle spasm that exacerbates the pain
Mainstay of treatment is the neuromodulating drugs which may give
superior pain control but often have important side effects.
Examples include:
• Antidepressants with neuroadrenergic modulating abilities,
eg amitriptyline, duloxetine. Start with a low dose and titrate up
slowly. Eventual doses may be similar to those used in younger
patients
• Anticonvulsants, eg gabapentin, pregabalin (postherpetic neuralgia)
or carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, valproate (trigeminal neuralgia).
Start with a low dose and titrate up slowly
The main side effects from these drugs are sedation and confusion,
and reaching a therapeutic dose may be limited by this problem.

Other options
• Nerve blocks or spinal stimulation, which can usually be accessed via
a specialist pain clinic
• Surgery, eg nerve decompression, or treatment with heat or lasers.
May provide relief but can result in scarring and numbness

157

158

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Parkinson’s disease: presentation
A common, idiopathic disease (prevalence 150/100 000) associated with
inadequate dopamine neurotransmitter in brainstem. There is loss of
neurons and Lewy body formation in the substantia nigra. The clinical
syndrome is distinct from Lewy Body dementia (See b ‘Dementia and
parkinsonism’, p.214 for treatment) but there is overlap in some pathological and clinical ﬁndings leading to suggestions they might be related
conditions.

Presentation
The clinical diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease is based on the UK Parkinson’s
disease brain bank criteria and should include:
• Bradykinesia (slow to initiate and carry out movements, expressionless
face, fatigability of repetitive movement)
Plus at least one of the following:
• Rigidity (cogwheeling = tremor superimposed on rigidity)
• Tremor (‘pin-rolling’ of hands—worse at rest)
• Postural instability
Other clinical features:
• Gait disorder (small steps)
• Usually an asymmetrical disease
• No pyramidal or cerebellar signs but reﬂexes are sometimes brisk
• Non motor symptoms are common and should be asked about (see
b ‘Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease’, p.158)

Non-motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease
• Depression (treat appropriately)
• Psychosis (may relate to medications; avoid typical antipsychotics as
they may worsen the motor features; atypicals such as quetiapine or
olanzapine can be tried)
• Dementia and hallucinations can occur in late stages but drug side
effects can cause similar problems. If features suggest Lewy body
dementia a trial of anticholinesterases may be warranted
• Sleep disturbance (treat restless legs, review medications, advise
about driving if sudden onset sleep, daytime hypersomnolence may
be treated with modaﬁnil)
• Falls (usually multifactorial, see b ‘Assessment following a fall’, p.104)
• Autonomic features are generally late features, but common in older
patients. They should be sought and actively managed:
• Weight loss
• Dysphagia
• Constipation
• Erectile dysfunction
• Orthostatic hypotension
• Excessive sweating
• Drooling

PARKINSON’S DISEASE: PRESENTATION

Investigations
• Diagnosis is clinical, and once suspected should be reviewed by a
Parkinson’s disease specialist
• Trials of treatment may be done, with review of the diagnosis if there
is no improvement, but single dose levodopa ‘challenge’ tests are no
longer performed
• Brain imaging (eg CT) can be used to illustrate other conditions that
may mimic Parkinson’s disease (eg vascular disease)
• Specialist scans are becoming more widely used to assist diagnosis
(eg consider 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission computed tomography
(SPECT), commonly known as DatSCAN™ after the radiolabelled
solution used)

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Parkinson’s disease: management
Should be overseen by a Parkinson’s disease specialist clinic.

Drugs
It is not possible to identify a universal ﬁrst-choice drug therapy for either
early Parkinson’s disease or for adjuvant drug therapy for later stages.
Consider the short- and long-term beneﬁts and risks of each treatment,
along with lifestyle and clinical factors. Discussion with the patient is key.
Initiation treatment is started with one of the following:
• Levodopa plus decarboxylase inhibitor (prevents peripheral breakdown
of drug) (co-beneldopa/co-careldopa). Start low and titrate to symptoms
• Dopamine agonists (ropinirole, pergolide, cabergoline). Psychiatric side
effects, postural hypotension and nausea often limit therapy
• MAOI (selegiline). The newer buccally absorbed preparation is better
tolerated and useful in swallowing difﬁculties. These drugs have many
interactions with antidepressants and should be used with care by a
specialist
Adjuvant treatment may be needed as the disease progresses. Firstly
increase doses or add a second agent from the list already given then
consider:
• COMT inhibitor (entacapone). Will smooth ﬂuctuations in plasma
levodopa concentrations. Give with each levodopa dose—sometimes
will need levodopa dose decrease. Stains urine orange
• Amantadine—weak dopamine agonist which can reduce dyskinetic
problems
• Apomorphine—subcutaneous (s/c) injections. Specialist treatmentrarely useful in older patients except to cover periods of nil by mouth
Anticholinergics (benzhexol, orphenadrine) are mild anti-parkinsonian drugs
rarely useful in elderly patients due to severe psychiatric side effects. They
do have a beneﬁcial effect on tremor and are possibly the drug of choice
where tremor is more of a problem than bradykinesia.

Surgery
Ablation (eg pallidotomy) and stimulation (electrode implants) used in
highly selected populations. Older patients often excluded due to high
operative risk.

Other therapeutic options
• Patients and carers beneﬁt from regular review by a specialist doctor
or nurse. Many services now have specialist Parkinson’s disease nurses
• A course of physiotherapy can be helpful to boost mobility
• Occupational therapy plays a vital role in aids and adaptations for
disability
• Speech and language therapists, along with dieticians can help when
swallowing becomes a problem
• Occasionally inpatient assessment is helpful but be aware that
hospital routines can rarely match home treatment and some patients
deteriorate in hospital
• Parkinson’s UK (M www.parkinsons.org.uk) has plenty of information
and advice for patients and carers

PARKINSON’S DISEASE: MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Manage a patient with Parkinson’s disease
who cannot take oral medication
This situation arises quite commonly in advanced disease during a hospital
admission.
A patient with advanced disease, admitted for another reason (eg sepsis)
may miss an oral dose of medication (eg because they are unwell, or
because the drug is not immediately available). In some this will be well
tolerated; in others there will be a rapid decline in function and loss of
swallow, with a downward spiral unless promptly managed.
Other situations in which oral medication may not be possible:
• Perioperatively when patient is nil by mouth
• When an ileus or other cause makes poor drug absorption likely
• After a stroke
2Omission of medication will (for most patients with Parkinson’s disease)
lead to a decline in function, so continuation of treatment is key.

Reducing the risk
• Plan ahead—patients should be educated about the importance of
taking medication on time, and always bring their own medication
with them if they come into hospital and be encouraged to self
medicate where possible
• If surgery is elective, then get specialist advice about medication
as part of the preoperative assessment. Aim for local or regional
anaesthesia if possible
• Have protocols in place for the urgent care of Parkinson’s disease
patients
• Ensure that wards have Parkinson’s disease drugs readily available

Early action
• Use nasogastric (NG) tubes early if swallow is impaired
• Relax nil by mouth rules preoperatively for Parkinson’s disease drugs
• Use antiemetics when vomiting

Medication
• Use a different preparation eg levodopa dispersible down an NG
tube, buccal selegiline
• Use an enteral preparation eg apomorphine (subcutaneous delivery)
or rotigotine (patch delivery). Advice will be needed from a specialist
about doses that are equivalent to their usual medication

Wearing off—progression of
disease—patients require higher
doses or more frequent dosing to
produce same effect

Possible that levodopa itself is toxic to
neurons and enhances progression. In
younger patients/milder disease start
with selegiline or dopamine agonists

Dyskinesias

Reduce levodopa dose if possible
(either alone or with addition of an
agonist). Add amantadine

Motor ﬂuctuations with
choreodystonic ‘on’ phases and
freezing ‘off ’ phases. These worsen
with duration of treatment

Reduced levodopa dose more
frequently (dose fractionation) or
controlled release preparations or add
entacapone or add dopamine agonist

Domperidone (30mg tds orally) is the
Other drug side effects (confusion
and hallucinations, constipation, urinary best antiemetic
retention, nausea and vomiting) are a
particular problem in elderly and often
limit treatment to sub-ideal levels
In general patients prefer dyskinetic
side effects than ‘off spells’—relatives/
carers may ﬁnd the opposite easier
to cope with especially if patient
confused or falling when ‘on’

Ensure you talk to the patient as well
even if it is easier to talk to the carer.
Compromise may be necessary

Quantifying response to treatment
is very difﬁcult

Get patients/carers to ﬁll in a 24hr
chart. A formal quantiﬁed drug trial by
therapists can be very helpful

Morning stiffness

Use a rapid-acting drug (eg Madopar®
dispersible) in bed on waking or try a
long-acting drug last thing at night

End-stage disease

Ultimately drug responsiveness so
poor and side effects so marked
that decreasing and withdrawing
therapy may be appropriate. Palliative
treatment and social support important

Impulse control disorders
• Deﬁned as the failure to resist an impulse, drive or temptation to
perform an act that is harmful to the person or others
• Tend to occur after the initiation of dopaminergic therapy in those
who are susceptible, and abate with dose reduction
Examples include:
• Hypersexuality (see b ‘Sexual function’, p.528)
• Pathological gambling
• Compulsive buying
• Aimless wandering
• Repetitive activities (eg arranging objects)
• Dopamine dysregulation syndrome (addictive use of dopaminergic

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Diseases masquerading as
Parkinson’s disease
The majority of slow, stiff or shaky older patients on geriatric wards do
not have true Parkinson’s disease (Table 7.4). As many as 1 in 4 diagnoses
of Parkinson’s disease made by non-specialists are incorrect. It is important to get the diagnosis right or you will subject patients needlessly to
the harmful side effects of medications. Coexistence of more than one
syndrome can further complicate diagnosis.
• Atherosclerotic pseudo-parkinsonism/multi-infarct dementia: Due to
neurovascular damage—consider in those with stroke/TIA or with
atherosclerotic risk factors, eg hypertension. Short-stepping,
wide-based unstable gait with relative preservation of arm and facial
movements (lower body parkinsonism). Head scan may show lacunae
or white matter change
• Benign essential tremor: Often inherited (autosomal dominant), worse
on action (spills tea from teacup), improved by alcohol and B-blockers,
may have head nodding or vocal tremor
• Lewy body dementia: Lewy bodies are widely present throughout cortex
not predominantly in substantia nigra as with true Parkinson’s disease.
Psychiatric symptoms, eg visual hallucinations tend to precede physical
ones
• Drug-induced parkinsonism: Neuroleptics are the commonest cause but
remember that prochlorperazine for dizziness and metoclopramide
for nausea are also causes. Some irritable bowel treatments contain
neuroleptics
• Other causes: Alzheimer’s disease, hydrocephalus, and even severe
polyarthritis can sometimes cause diagnostic confusion. Rare
differential diagnoses include Wilson’s disease, Pick’s disease,
carbon monoxide poisoning, multiple head injuries (ex-boxers) and
postencephalitis or anoxic brain injury

Parkinson’s-plus syndromes
This is a confusing array of rare disorders including:
• Multi-system atrophy (aka Shy–Drager syndrome, olivopontocerebellar
atrophy) with early autonomic failure (incontinence and postural
instability), ataxia, parkinsonism, and pyramidal signs. Cognition intact
• Progressive supranuclear palsy (aka Steele–Richardson–Olszewski
disease) with up- and down-gaze palsy, axial rigidity and falls, dysarthria
and dysphagia, and frontal lobe dementia

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Epilepsy
Primary epilepsy most commonly presents around the time of puberty
but the incidence of new ﬁts is actually higher in the over 70s (>100 per
100 000) because of the increasing amount of secondary epilepsy (caused
by, eg brain ischaemia, subdural haematomas, brain tumours).
In addition ﬁts can be precipitated by:
• Metabolic disturbance (eg hyponatraemia)
• Drugs (eg ciproﬂoxacin)
• Infection (at any site but particularly meningitis/encephalitis)
• Withdrawal from alcohol or drugs such as benzodiazepines
• Wernicke’s encephalopathy (due to thiamine deﬁciency in
malnourished, eg alcoholics)
Many of these conditions are more common in older patients who also
have a lower ﬁt threshold for any given level of stimulus.

Diagnosis
• See also b ‘Syncope and presyncope’, p.108
• An eye witness account is the most useful diagnostic tool
• Look particularly for post-event confusion/drowsiness which is rare in
cardiac syncope
• The classic features of prodrome, tongue-biting and incontinence are
not so useful in distinguishing cardiac from neurological syncope in
older patients
• Remember that cerebral hypoperfusion from any cause (eg
bradycardia) can cause ﬁts so epilepsy can coexist with other
causes of syncope. In these cases treatment of the primary syncope/
hypoperfusion is more effective than anti-epileptics. See b
‘HOW TO . . . Distinguish syncope and seizures’, p.110

Investigations
• Routine blood screening, CXR, and ECG to look for precipitants and
differential diagnoses
• CT scan is vital to exclude a structural lesion
• EEGs can be helpful when positive but very commonly have nonspeciﬁc changes and low sensitivity, ie normal EEG does not rule out
epilepsy

General management
• Ensure the patient is not taking medication that lowers the ﬁt threshold
(check the BNF—common examples include tricyclics, ciproﬂoxacin
and phenothiazines. Think about over-the-counter drugs, eg Ginkgo
biloba and stimulants such as cocaine)
• Correct any metabolic derangement (eg glucose, sodium, sepsis)
• Advise about driving restrictions—don’t assume they don’t drive
• Detect and treat complications, eg aspiration, trauma, pressure injuries

EPILEPSY

Driving regulations and epilepsy
You have a duty to ensure that the patient informs DVLA. Patients have
at least 1-year ban on driving for a ﬁrst ﬁt (unless a ‘provoked ﬁt’, eg following brain surgery or stroke, when may be shorter period—individual
decision). They can then reapply for licence as long as they remain ﬁt-free.
Patients must also refrain from driving for 6 months after withdrawing
epilepsy medication.
• Further information available at: M www.dvla.gov.uk

Epilepsy and stroke
Onset seizures (within a week, most commonly within 24hr) occur in
2–5% of strokes. Commoner with haemorrhages, large cortical strokes
and venous infarction. Consider also alcohol/drug (especially benzodiazepine) withdrawal for early ﬁts. Long-term anticonvulsants not usually
prescribed unless ﬁts recur.
After the ﬁrst week stroke remains a risk factor for new epilepsy—ﬁrst year 5% ﬁt, subsequently 1.5% annual incidence. Many such patients
develop transient neurological worsening (Todd’s paresis) or permanent
worsening without CT evidence of new stroke—in these patients it is
usually worth considering long-term anticonvulsants.
Epilepsy may occur secondary to clinically ‘silent’ cerebral ischaemia
and 3% of patients with stroke have a past history of ﬁts, most occurring in the preceding year. Some epilepsy experts suggest that aspirin is
prescribed for new-onset seizures in an elderly patient once structural
lesions have been excluded.

167

168

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Epilepsy: drug treatment
Acute treatment
• Start with benzodiazepines (5–10mg rectal diazepam or 2–10mg iv
Diazemuls® or 0.5–2mg lorazepam iv or intramuscularly (im))
• If ﬁts continue consider setting up loading dose infusion of phenytoin
(use a cardiac monitor) until oral medication can be taken
• Rarely the patient may need intubating and paralysing to stabilize them
or to allow an urgent CT scan

Chronic treatment
• Because of side effects and long duration of treatment most doctors
will resist starting anticonvulsants until after a second ﬁt, especially if
the diagnosis is unclear or if there is a reversible precipitant. Presence
of underlying structural abnormality or wishing to return to driving may
tip the balance in favour of treatment
• The choice of agent shows regional and personal variation
• Most commonly used agents are similarly effective
• Older agents include phenytoin, carbamazepine (both effective but
may be sedative) and valproate (better tolerated but plasma levels are
unhelpful in monitoring compliance or side effects)
• Newer agents such as lamotrigine and levetiracetam are ‘cleaner’ and
increasingly used as ﬁrst line
• All anticonvulsants have signiﬁcant side effects, eg sedation, confusion,
rash, tremor, and ataxia. Serious liver, blood and pulmonary side effects
can also occur—ongoing monitoring to optimize dose and minimize
side effects is necessary
• Many anticonvulsants interact with each other as well as other drugs
and can increase toxicity or reduce effectiveness—if in doubt consult
a pharmacist. Gabapentin and pregabalin are less likely to interact with
other medications and can be useful alternatives
• Avoid abrupt withdrawal of antiepileptics—ﬁts may be provoked
• Partial seizures (eg face/arm twitching) are rarely dangerous and often
distress bystanders more than the patient, but they can progress to
secondary generalized seizures. The same drugs can be employed.
Partial seizures often indicate structural lesions and an early CT scan is
advisable
• Sometimes a trial of anticonvulsants in patients with recurrent
unexplained collapse can be revealing
• Refer to an epilepsy specialist if control is proving difﬁcult and multiple
drugs are required

NEUROLEPTIC MALIGNANT SYNDROME

Neuroleptic malignant syndrome
Rare but important syndrome in patients taking neuroleptics (eg haloperidol,
chlorpromazine, risperidone) with triad of:
• Fever
• Rigidity and tremor
• Rhabdomyolysis with secondary renal failure (see b ‘Rhabdomyolysis’,
p.505)
2Can be fatal (up to 30%) so early recognition is important.

Diagnosis
May arise at any time during treatment, ie patient may have recently:
• Started (most common) or stopped neuroleptics
• Increased the dose or been stable on them for a long time
• Added a second drug, eg tricyclic antidepressant, lithium
Reintroduction of the offending drug at a later date may not reproduce
symptoms. Contributing factors such as intercurrent illness, metabolic
derangement may be important in the aetiology.

Clinical features
• The patient looks unwell with fever, severe lead-pipe rigidity,
bradykinesia, occasionally tremor and decreased conscious level
• Time course: onset usually over 1–3 days, starts with rigidity/altered
mental state
• Seizures and abnormal neurological signs can occur
• Autonomic dysfunction causes sweating, tachycardia, and hypertension
• Multiorgan failure can occur, there is a leucocytosis, and creatinine
kinase levels may be over 1000IU/L
• Lumbar puncture, CT scan, and EEG are often required to exclude
other diagnoses such as CNS infection
2The most common cause of a similar presentation is sepsis in a patient
with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease.

Management
Stop all neuroleptics. Cooling using paracetamol, fans and damp sponging.
Intravenous ﬂuids with careful monitoring of electrolytes and renal function. Dantrolene (direct muscle relaxant) can speed recovery. Shortterm dialysis is sometimes required. Bromocriptine is used in some cases
although there is limited evidence for efﬁcacy.
Early transfer to intensive care unit may be wise—death most
commonly occurs by hypoventilation/pneumonia or renal failure. There
are sometimes persisting neurological sequelae.

Serotonin syndrome
A similar syndrome to neuroleptic malignant syndrome in patients taking
serotonin reuptake inhibitors especially if combined with tramadol, tricyclic, or MAOI. Patients tend to be agitated and delirious rather than
unconscious. Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea/vomiting) occur.
Onset may be within 2hr, resolution usually quicker than NMS.

169

170

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Motor neuron disease
A progressive idiopathic disease with selective degeneration of motor
neurons causing weakness and wasting. There is a variety of manifestations depending on the site of damage; the commonest site for lesions
is in the anterior horn cells of spinal cord (LMN), but descending motor
pathway (UMN) may be affected in the corticospinal tracts, brainstem and
motor cranial nuclei.
2The combination of weakness and fasciculations should always prompt
consideration of motor neuron disease.
• Onset rises steeply with age with peak incidence late 50s/early
60s. Very rare before age 40. Overall prevalence 7 per 100 000 but
incidence 1 per 10 000 age 65–85
• Underdiagnosed in older patients (confused with cerebrovascular
disease, myasthenia, especially bulbar onset forms, cervical myelopathy,
motor neuropathy, syringomyelia, and paraneoplastic syndromes)
• Slightly commoner in males
• 5% will have a family history (autosomal dominant is most common but
can be recessive or X-linked)

History
• Weakness, cramps and fatigue in limbs. Weakness usually begins in a
focal area and spreads to contiguous muscles, onset in upper limbs is
most common
• Palatal and vocal cord paralysis can cause stridor, dysarthria, dysphagia,
and aspiration pneumonia
• Paresis of respiratory muscles can cause respiratory failure (may
present to chest physicians/ITU)
• Intellect, sensation, and continence are usually retained. Some forms
associated with frontotemporal dementia (<5%), depression common

Examination
• Look for wasting with fasciculation (LMN) especially in tongue,
shoulders and legs. 2Fasciculations may be a normal ﬁnding in hands
and calves of older people
• Head drop/droop can occur
• Brisk reﬂexes, clonus and upgoing plantars (UMN). This is one
condition that can cause absent ankle jerks and upgoing plantars
• Atrophy and weakness are less speciﬁc signs
• ‘Donald Duck’ speech
• Sensory changes should make you question the diagnosis

Investigations
• Creatine kinase (CK) may be elevated
• CT, MRI, and muscle biopsy are usually normal
• Electromyography (EMG) shows denervation of muscles caused by
anterior horn cell degeneration and is diagnostic

MOTOR NEURON DISEASE

Clinical pictures
Diverse presentations and rate of progression including;
• Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the commonest form—classical
picture of mixed UMN and LMN. Term used commonly in USA
• Progressive pseudobulbar or bulbar palsy—speech and swallow
predominantly affected
• Primary lateral sclerosis—UMNs predominantly affected
• Progressive muscular atrophy—LMNs predominantly affected

Treatment
Riluzole (sodium channel blocker) 50mg bd. Prolongs survival by a few
months but not function. Licensed and endorsed by NICE for amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis only. Expensive and should be supervised by specialist.
Monitor liver function and check for neutropenia if febrile illness.
Supportive
• Chest—antibiotics and physiotherapy, tracheostomy, non-invasive
nocturnal ventilation (for diaphragmatic palsy, sleep apnoea)
• Speech—early referral to speech therapy for communication aids
• Nutrition—initially pureed food and thickened ﬂuids. Malnutrition
and aspiration are indications to consider artiﬁcial feeding (see b
‘Nutrition’, p.356)
• Muscle spasm—baclofen, physiotherapy
• Mobility/independence—OT for wheelchairs and adaptations
• Pain/distress—opiates or benzodiazepines (but beware respiratory
suppression)
Other
• This is devastating diagnosis to give to a patient—mean life expectancy
is 2–5 years. Matters are often worse because there is often a
considerable delay between symptoms and a concrete diagnosis being
made (sometimes initial diagnosis may have been incorrect). Emphasize
the retention of cognition and aspects of supportive care available.
Offer regular follow up appointments
• Specialist neurology/motor neuron disease nurses are available in some
areas
• Refer to Motor Neurone Disease Association for support
• Consider enduring power of attorney and advance directives

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Peripheral neuropathies
Some minor degree of sensory loss in the feet and reduced or absent
ankle jerks is so common in older patients (up to 50% of over 85 year
olds) that some class this as a normal ageing change, but remember:
• Even mild, asymptomatic neuropathies can contribute to postural
instability and falls
• The diagnosis is often missed because of non-speciﬁc symptoms and
insidious onset with slow progression

Clinical features
• There are signs of lower motor neuron weakness with wasting and loss
of reﬂexes
• Sensory loss often with joint position and vibration loss before touch
and pain. This is classically in a ‘glove and stocking’ distribution, rather
than dermatomal (see Appendix)
• Neuralgia-type pain may be present (especially diabetes and alcohol).
see b ‘HOW TO . . . Treat neuralgia’, p.157
• Autonomic failure and cranial nerve involvement can also occur
• Severe cases may affect respiration

Classiﬁcation
Try to determine if the signs are focal or generalized and whether they
are predominantly sensory or motor because this can help identify the
likely underlying pathology. Further classiﬁcation by pathology (axonal or
demyelinating) requires nerve conduction studies or biopsy.
The commonest pattern produces widespread symmetrical sensory loss
(typically glove and stocking). This may be combined with distal muscle
weakness (mixed motor and sensory neuropathy) or sometimes there is
a pure motor neuropathy. Where signs are focal consider mononeuritis
multiplex.

Causes
The causes are legion and often multiple in older patients. Idiopathic
neuropathies are very common (25% defy diagnosis in most studies). The
following list is not exhaustive:
• Idiopathic
• Diabetes
• Carpel tunnel syndrome
• Paraneoplastic syndromes (eg small cell lung cancer)
• Alcoholism (often combined with vitamin deﬁciency)
• Renal failure
• B12 or folate deﬁciency
• Guillain–Barré syndrome (commonest acute onset)
• Hypothyroidism
• Vasculitides (eg Wegner’s granulomatosis)—actually multiple
mononeuropathy
• Drugs (eg isoniazid, nitrofurantoin, vincristine, amiodarone)
• Paraproteinaemias and amyloid
• Chronic inﬂammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (rare
autoimmune motor neuropathy)

PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHIES

Investigations
• Always check B12, glucose, TFTs, serum and urine immunoglobulins,
ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP) before labelling a neuropathy
idiopathic
• Look carefully for an occult tumour (eg breast examination and CXR)
• Family history
• Nerve conduction studies will conﬁrm nerve damage and distinguish
demyelination from axonal damage (which sometimes helps
with differential diagnosis) but they are not always required in
straightforward cases
• Further specialist tests include immunology, tumour markers, lumbar
puncture, molecular genetics tests, and nerve biopsy

Treatment
The important thing is to identify reversible causes quickly but even treatable causes rarely respond dramatically—the aim is usually prevention of
further deterioration. Chronic inﬂammatory polyradiculoneuropathy is
treated by steroids, plasma exchange and intravenous immunoglobulin but
most other chronic neuropathies have no speciﬁc treatment. Supportive
and symptomatic treatment (eg appropriate footwear, analgesia, environmental adaptation) is important.

Guillain–Barré syndrome
This is an acute inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy.
• Causes ascending paralysis, weakness beginning in the feet and hands
and migrating towards the trunk
• It can cause life-threatening complications, particularly if the
respiratory muscles are affected or if there is dysfunction of the
autonomic nervous system
• The disease is usually triggered by an acute infection
This is a medical emergency which responds to iv immunoglobulins or
plasmapheresis. These patients can deteriorate rapidly and should be
managed in conjunction with specialist neurology units. Even patients
who look well should have their vital capacity measured daily to warn of
impending respiratory failure.
2The main hurdle is recognizing the diagnosis.

173

174

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Subdural haematoma
A condition which is much more common in old age because as the brain
shrinks the veins which lie between it and the skull are much more likely
to get torn following trauma (even minor injury). Older people are also
more likely to have falls/head injuries and are more commonly on predisposing drugs (eg aspirin, warfarin). Other risk factors include alcoholism,
epilepsy, and haemodialysis.

Features
2Subdurals frequently present with very non-speciﬁc symptoms in a frail
confused patients. A high index of suspicion is required.
• Subdurals can occur acutely (and present within hours of an accident)
or more slowly as the classical ‘chronic subdural haematoma’ although
this distinction doesn’t help guide management
• A history of head injury occurs in only about half
• Common features include drowsiness and confusion (rarely ﬂuctuant),
postural instability, progressive focal neurology (eg hemiparesis,
unequal pupils), headache, blurred vision
• Rarely transient neurology (mimicking TIA) or parkinsonism can occur
• Some patients are asymptomatic and large collections can be incidental
ﬁndings
• Examine for papilloedema, focal neurology, and long tract signs

Diagnosis
• CT head scan—look for crescent-shaped haematoma compressing
sulci (hypodense/black is old blood, hyperdense/white indicates recent
bleeding) and midline shift
• All patients who have new UMN signs with confusion and or
drowsiness should be scanned
• It is harder to decide when to scan a confused patient without such
signs—most agree it is reasonable to look for other causes of acute
confusion before asking for a head scan as long as the patient is being
observed for any change in neurological signs or conscious level
• Have a lower threshold for scanning patients on aspirin or warfarin and
for those who have evidence of falls, particularly facial bruising. MRI is
slightly superior and useful when CT changes are subtle (an isodense
phase occurs on CT in transition between hyperdense and hypodense
changes) or very small haematomas are suspected

Management
Decisions are usually made in conjunction with the local neurosurgical
team (although in practice only about 1/3 of patients will end up having
surgery).
Stop aspirin and reverse warfarin therapy if possible.
Observation (with or without dexamethasone to reduce intracerebral
pressure) is frequently used in:
• Asymptomatic patients
• Those with small bleeds who are stable/improving
• Those not ﬁt for transfer/surgery

SUBDURAL HAEMATOMA

When conservative management is adopted, record conscious level
(GCS—see b Appendix, ‘Glasgow Coma Scale’, p.696) and any focal
neurology at least daily or if there is any change. Any deterioration should
prompt repeat CT scan and reconsideration of surgery.
Burrhole surgery is not complex and is done under local anaesthetic.
Recovery after surgery can be dramatic. Complications include re-bleeding
and seizures. Use symptoms (especially conscious level) not CT appearance
to decide on surgery. Mortality is around 10%—highest with depressed
conscious level and bilateral haematoma. Those left with residual neurology
should receive rehabilitation as in stroke.

175

176

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Sleep and insomnia
With increasing age less sleep is needed (approximately 1hr less than
young adults), circadian rhythm is less marked and sleep becomes more
fragmented with greater difﬁculty getting to sleep. Deep (stage 3 and
4) sleep is reduced but dreaming sleep/REM (rapid eye movement) is
preserved.
Insomnia is a symptom which correlates poorly with observed actual
sleep time (ie patients who complain of poor sleep may be observed
by nurses/family to sleep well while those who sleep very little do not
necessarily complain). It can be very distressing and is associated with
increased morbidity and mortality. Around 25% of elderly people have
chronic insomnia—even higher rates with psychiatric and medical
conditions. Insomnia is a particular problem in an unfamiliar noisy ward
environment and doctors are often under considerable pressure to
prescribe sedatives.

Treatment of insomnia
First ensure that underlying causes are looked for and treated:
• Pain at night—consider using analgesics with sedative side effects
eg opiates
• Nocturnal urinary frequency, eg due to polyuria, peripheral oedema,
prostatism
• Comorbidities, eg orthopnoea, oesophageal reﬂux, Parkinson’s disease
• Depression/anxiety—very common and use of an antidepressant will
improve sleep much better than a hypnotic
• Alcohol dependence
• Drugs—corticosteroids, omeprazole, phenytoin, amiodarone,
sulfasalazine atorvastatin, ramipril, as well as psychiatric drugs,
eg paroxetine, haloperidol, and chlorpromazine can cause insomnia.
B-blockers and levodopa cause nightmares
The following non-pharmacological interventions (sleep hygiene) can be tried
• Reduce or stop daytime ‘catnapping’
• Avoid caffeine, heavy meals and alcohol in the evening (alcohol helps to
fall asleep but reduces sleep quality)
• Use a bedtime routine
• Ensure environment is dark, quiet, comfortable
• Relaxation and cognitive behavioural techniques can be useful
• Try warm milky drinks
• Manage expectations—older people will rarely sleep as much or well
as younger people

SLEEP AND INSOMNIA

Drugs
• Benzodiazepines (eg temazepam 10mg) are licensed for short term
(<4 weeks) management of insomnia and anxiety. They do work well
when used correctly (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Use benzodiazepines for
insomnia’, p.177)
• The newer Z-drugs (eg zopiclone, zolpidem, and zaleplon) are only for
insomnia. They have shorter half lives and fewer side effects (although
zopiclone is still a cause of daytime drowsiness). Overall they are
probably slightly superior to benzodiazepines but the same cautions
about dependence apply
• Other hypnotics (eg chloral hydrate, chlomethiazole, antihistamines)
can be toxic, especially in overdose and provide no major advantages
• A new class of drugs that act on melatonin pathways may be beneﬁcial
but lacks a proven safety record in older people

HOW TO . . . Use benzodiazepines for insomnia
Tolerance develops after only 4 weeks and benzodiazepines fail to
produce a useful sedative effect, however, it only takes this long for
dependence to occur. Dependence may be physical (with rebound
insomnia, anxiety or even delirium) and/or psychological (the patient
believes they will not be able to sleep without tablets). The shorter the
half-life the greater the withdrawal effects. Benzodiazepine use has been
associated with increased falls, reduced functional status, road trafﬁc
accidents, depression, and memory impairment.
Although awareness of these problems have reduced the number of
long-term benzodiazepine users, there is still over-prescribing.

Prevention of dependence
• Do not use benzodiazepines for mild or non-distressing insomnia—
try non-pharmacological measures ﬁrst
• Never prescribe benzodiazepines for more than 4 weeks
• Never prescribe benzodiazepines medication at discharge from
hospital
• All patients/carers should receive warnings about benzodiazepine
side effects (especially dependence) and the reason for limiting
course length at the outset
• GPs should limit repeat prescriptions and audit their practice

Treatment of dependence
• Explain and motivate patient/carers
• Gradual reduction regimen, eg diazepam by 2–2.5mg every 2 weeks
• In difﬁcult cases switch to equivalent dose of diazepam ﬁrst—long
half-life produces milder withdrawal symptoms
• Continuing support
• Occasionally acute withdrawal is undertaken by mistake (eg drug
accidentally not prescribed for a couple of weeks during acute
admission with fractured neck of femur). In these cases do not
automatically re-start the benzodiazepines and do explain why to
the patient or they will just re-start it when they return home

177

CHAPTER 7

Neurology

Other sleep disorders
Hypersomnolence
This is excessive daytime sleepiness despite a normal night of sleep.
Causes include brain disease (eg dementia, stroke), cardiopulmonary
disease (eg cardiac failure, COPD), obstructive sleep apnoea, hypothyroidism, narcolepsy, and sedative drugs.

Restless legs syndrome
A common (10% older people) unpleasant sensation in limbs which
increases with drowsiness and is eradicated by movement. Can be associated with limb jerking during sleep with sleep disturbance. Both symptoms
respond to benzodiazepines. Dopamine agonists are also used with some
success.

Circadian rhythm disorders
Jet lag is the best known but advanced sleep phase syndrome (sleepiness occurs too early in evening but there is early morning wakening)
and delayed sleep phase (sleepiness comes too late at night) can occur
without such a precipitant. Treat by gradually altering bedtime and bright
light therapy when wakefulness desired.

Sleep apnoea in older patients
Obstructive sleep apnoea and central sleep apnoea are very common in
older patients and can contribute to daytime sleepiness, accidents and
heart failure. Unfortunately periods of apnoea are less likely to be symptomatic than in the young and where symptoms do exist they are often
multifactorial so diagnosis and compliance with therapy (non-invasive
positive pressure ventilation) can be problematic.

REM sleep behaviour disorder
Dream-enacting behaviour during REM sleep, occurring because of a lack
of muscle atonia that usually accompanies REM sleep. About half will go
on to develop neurological pathology, eg Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body
disease. Treatment with benzodiazepines may be successful.

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Deﬁnition and classiﬁcation
Deﬁnition
Stroke is the sudden onset of a focal neurological deﬁcit, lasting more than
24hr or leading to death, caused by a vascular problem.
• Infarction: emboli, in situ thrombosis or low ﬂow
• Haemorrhage: spontaneous (not associated with trauma). Excludes
subdural and extradural haematomas, but includes spontaneous
subarachnoid haemorrhage
Use of the term cerebrovascular accident is now discouraged.
Transient ischaemic attacks are focal neurological deﬁcits (including
monocular visual loss) due to inadequate blood supply that last <24hr (in
reality, most TIAs last just minutes).
Infarction and TIAs have the same pathogenesis, and the distinction is
likely to become less helpful with time. Both stroke and TIA need urgent
treatment, and as it is impossible to distinguish TIA from stroke in the ﬁrst
few minutes and hours, the distinction becomes less relevant. Waiting
to see if the focal neurology resolves causes neuronal loss at a rate of
1.9 million per minute. The term ‘brain attack’ is being used to describe
the full spectrum of disease severity from TIA to fatal stroke, where
early intervention to save brain tissue has parallels with approaches to
myocardial salvage in coronary syndromes.

Stroke burden
• Incidence of ﬁrst ever stroke is about 200 per 100 000 per year
• Prevalence is around 5–12 per 1000 population, depending on the age
of the sample
• It is a disease of older people (over 2/3rds of cases occur in the over
65s, less than 15% occur in under 45s)
• Globally it is the third most common cause of death (after coronary
heart disease and all cancers)
• In England and Wales it accounts for 12% of all deaths and is the
commonest cause of severe disability among community dwellers

Classiﬁcation
Various methods including;
• Infarct or haemorrhage (also haemorrhagic infarcts)
• Pathogenesis—large vessel, small vessel, cardioembolic (AF or LV mural
thrombus), valve disease, infective endocarditis, non-atheromatous
arterial disease (vasculitis, dissection), blood disorders
• Vessel affected—anterior circulation (mainly middle cerebral artery),
lacunar (deep small subcortical vessels), posterior circulation (vertebral
and basilar arteries)
• Bamford’s classiﬁcation—clinical features to deﬁne likely stroke
territory. Used in major trials and gives prognostic information about
each group (see Table 8.1).

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Predisposing factors
Fixed
• Age: stroke risk increases with age (this is the strongest risk factor)
• Sex: males > females
• Ethnicity: higher risk in Blacks and Asians than Whites living in the
West. Probably due to increased obesity, hypertension, and diabetes
• Family history: positive family history increases risk. Not simple
inheritance—complex genetic/environmental interaction
• Previous stroke/TIA: risk of recurrence is about 10–16% in the ﬁrst year,
highest in the acute phase
• Other vascular disease: presence of any atheromatous disease
(coronary, peripheral arterial etc) increases risk of stroke

Modiﬁable by lifestyle change
• Smoking: causal and dose related. Risk diminishes 5 years after quitting
• Alcohol: Conﬂicting evidence with some studies suggesting any alcohol
consumption increases risk, while others suggest heavy drinking is a risk
factor, but moderate intake is protective
• Obesity: Increased risk of all vascular events in obesity—confounded
by increase in other risk factors (hypertension, diabetes) but probably
weak independent factor, especially central obesity
• Physical inactivity: Increased stroke in less active—again confounded by
presence of other risk factors in the inactive; to date limited evidence
that increased activity lowers risk
• Diet: Healthy eaters have lower risk, but may have healthier lifestyles
in general. Low salt, high fruit and vegetable, high ﬁsh and antioxidant
diets are likely to be protective, but trials have failed to show an effect
from dietary interventions
• Oestrogens: the oral contraceptive confers a slightly increased risk of
stroke and should be avoided in the presence of other risk factors.
Postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy has been shown to
increase risk of ischaemic stroke, but not TIA or haemorrhagic stroke

Medically modiﬁable
• Hypertension: clear association between increasing BP and increased
stroke risk across all population groups. Risk doubles with each
5–7 mmHg increase in diastolic blood pressure. Also increases with
systolic rises and even isolated systolic hypertension
• AF: Risk of stroke signiﬁcantly increased in AF (see b ‘Atrial
ﬁbrillation’, p.276)
• Diabetes: risk factor independent of hypertension
• High cholesterol: weaker risk factor than in heart disease—likely due to
diversity of stroke aetiologies
• Carotid stenosis: risk increases with increasing stenosis and with the
occurrence of symptoms attributable to the stenosis
• Other comorbidity: Increased risk in some conditions, such as sickle-cell
anaemia, blood diseases causing hyperviscosity and vasculitides

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Acute assessment
Due to the development of new acute treatments (eg thrombolysis and
carotid endarterectomy) the focus for modern stroke management in
hospital has shifted towards rapid and accurate diagnosis during the ﬁrst
few hours/days.

History
• Is it a focal neurological deﬁcit?
• Did it come on ‘at a stroke’ or is there a hint of progression (simple
stroke may worsen over several days, but think of alternative
diagnoses, eg tumour)
• Is there headache or drowsiness? (haemorrhage more likely)
• Was there a fall or other head trauma?
2Think subdural and request urgent scan.
• What are the vascular risk factors?
• What was the premorbid state?
• What are the comorbidities? (Increases chance of poor outcome)
• What are the medications? (Call GP surgery if unknown)
• Where do they live, and with whom? Who are the signiﬁcant family
members?

Examination
• GCS (see b Appendix, ‘Glasgow Coma Scale’, p.696). A standardized
measure to assess neurological deterioration. Unconsciousness or
deteriorating GCS suggests haemorrhage, large infarct with oedema or
brainstem event.
• NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS). Clinical evaluation instrument with
documented reliability and validity. Used to assess severity of initial
stroke (when making a thrombolysis decision), outcome and degree
of recovery in stroke. Grades the following areas: consciousness,
orientation, obeying commands, gaze, visual ﬁelds, facial weakness,
motor function in the arm and leg, limb ataxia, sensory, language,
dysarthria and inattention.
General examination
• General inspection (head trauma, signs of ﬁtting—incontinence or
tongue biting, frailty, and general condition, eg skin)
• Temperature (especially after a long lie)
• Cardiovascular examination (pulse rate and rhythm, blood pressure,
cardiac examination for source of cardiac emboli, carotid bruits)
• Respiratory examination (aspiration pneumonia or pre-existing
respiratory conditions)
• Abdominal examination (palpable bladder, organomegaly)
• Neurological examination (may need to be adapted if patient drowsy)
• Cranial nerves: especially visual ﬁelds and visual inattention (if difﬁculty
with compliance, test blink response to threat, and look for a gaze
preference which may occur with hemianopia or neglect), assess
swallow (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage swallow after stroke’, p.189)
• Limbs: tone (may be diminished acutely), any weakness (grade
power for later comparison). Is the distribution pyramidal—arm
ﬂexors stronger than extensors, leg extensors stronger than ﬂexors?

ACUTE ASSESSMENT

If weakness subtle, assess for pyramidal/pronator drift and ﬁne
movements of both hands—(dominant should be better), coordination
(limited if power is diminished), sensation (gross testing by touching
both sides with eyes closed), also sensory inattention, reﬂexes (initially
may be absent, then become brisker with time). Plantars extensor on
affected side
• Gait: assess in less severe stroke—is it safe? If not safe can the patient
sit unaided?
• Speech: dysarthria (trouble enunciating because of, eg facial weakness
or posterior circulation stroke) or dysphasia (cortical disruption of
speech—may be receptive and/or expressive):
• Receptive dysphasia is an inability to understand language—test with
one-stage commands—‘close your eyes’ and progress to more
complex tasks ‘put your left hand on your right ear’. Don’t do the
action yourself or the patient will copy you—a test of mimicry
rather than dysphasia. If comprehension intact, reassure the patient
that you know they can understand, but are having difﬁculty ﬁnding
the right words
• Expressive dysphasia—problems producing speech. May be ﬂuent
(lots of words that make no sense), or non-ﬂuent (unrecognizable
words). Nominal dysphasia is part of an expressive dysphasia and
is tested by asking the patient to name increasingly rare objects,
eg watch, hand, second hand)

HOW TO . . . Assess for inattention
Occurs with parietal cortex damage, where there are errors in awareness of self—the patient’s ‘automatic pilot’ has gone wrong.
In extreme cases, the patient will not recognize their own arm, and
only wash half of their body. Lesser degrees are more common, and
complicate the rehabilitation process, as the patient must constantly
be reminded of the existence of the affected side. Can affect vision or
whole of one side of body—most commonly non-dominant hemispheric
(ie right hemisphere, left neglect)
To test:
1. Establish that sensory input is present bilaterally, ie check that the
patient can feel a touch to each hand individually and does not
have a hemianopia (may be hard to establish where extreme gaze
preference exists)
2. Provide two stimuli at once (touch both hands together, or move
ﬁngers in both sides of the visual ﬁeld) and see if the patient
preferentially notices the sensory input on the good side. If so, there
is inattention of the bad side
Even if formal testing does not reveal inattention, sometimes it will
become apparent during rehabilitation, often noted by therapists.

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Acute management
Guidelines for acute care are published by the Royal College of Physicians
(M www.rcplondon.ac.uk), see also National Stroke Strategy 2007
(M www.dh.gov.uk).

Diagnosis
Care should occur on an acute stroke unit. Diagnosis should be made clinically (including assessment of likely cerebral area affected) and reviewed
by a clinician with expertise in stroke. CT scan should be performed
unless there is good clinical reason for not doing so (eg dying patient for
terminal care)

Medical interventions
• Thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) should be given
promptly where indicated (see b ‘Thrombolysis’, p.192)
• Aspirin (300mg) should be given as soon as possible after the onset of
stroke symptoms if haemorrhage is excluded (can be given NG or PR)
• BP—debate about the optimal BP in the acute phase—high BP
is harmful long term, but may be required to provide perfusion
pressure with altered cerebral auto regulation acutely—trials ongoing.
Guidelines advise that BP should not be lowered acutely in general, but
existing antihypertensives continued
• Oxygen supplementation should be given to hypoxic patients
• Hydration should be maintained to ensure euvolaemia and biochemical
normality, and monitored closely
• Glucose should be measured and euglycaemia maintained—likely to
improve recovery of ischaemic penumbral tissue
• Pyrexia should be lowered with treatment of the underlying cause, fan,
paracetamol, and sponging. High temperatures are associated with
poorer outcomes, but the causal nature of this association is unknown
• DVT prevention is done with early mobilization. There now good
evidence that compression stockings should not be used routinely and
low dose low molecular weight heparin is contraindicated acutely due
to increased bleeding
• Neurosurgical opinion should be sought for hydrocephalus, posterior
fossa haemorrhages, large haemorrhages with midline shift and large
middle cerebral artery (MCA) infarcts in patients <60 (malignant MCA
syndrome)
• Centrally acting drugs should be avoided (eg sedatives)
• Seizures should be treated (see b ‘Epilepsy and stroke’, p.167)

Multidisciplinary acute input
Protocols should be developed for early management, including monitoring consciousness level, assessing swallow (not gag), risk assessment
for pressure sores, nutritional status, cognitive impairment, bowel and
bladder care (avoiding catheterization if possible), and moving and handling requirements. Early SALT assessment should be done for all with
swallow or language difﬁculties. Early mobilization with the physiotherapist having expertise in stroke rehabilitation.

ACUTE MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Manage swallow after stroke
Aspiration of saliva or food is one of the commonest complications
of stroke and a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Patients who
are drowsy, dysarthric and those with a dysphasia are most at risk of
aspiration.
Assessment—Ideally all patients should have their swallow assessed
promptly by a SALT or professional with speciﬁc stroke dysphagia training.
If the patient is low risk and you wish to do a bedside assessment:
1. Sit the patient upright and listen to the chest to establish baseline
2. Ask the patient to cough, and note the strength and effectiveness
3. Give the patient a teaspoon of water, and ask them not to swallow
4. Look for leakage of water from the closed mouth
5. Ask the patient to swallow the water
6. Check for prompt, coordinated swallow with elevation of the
tracheal cartilage
7. Watch for signs of aspiration—coughing and spluttering. These may
not occur for several minutes so do not leave immediately
8. If no problems then try a half-glass of water (drunk slowly) or a small
amount of yogurt
Management—If the patient is high risk, there are concerns during the
bedside test or if there are problems encountered during feeding:
1. Make the patient to ‘nil by mouth’
2. Provide alternative means of hydration at once with an iv infusion, or
nasogastric tube (NGT)
3. Refer for early SALT assessment, to stratify the impairment and make
a plan for safe oral intake, reviewing at regular intervals
4. Nutrition will need to be considered if the swallow is not safe after a
day or two (studies show no beneﬁt to feeding in very early stages).
Passing a NGT allows medication to be given in addition to feeding,
but it is uncomfortable and may become dislodged. In recent years
many centres are using looped/bridle NGTs, which are much less
likely to be dislodged.
Medium/longer-term management—if the patient continues to have
swallowing problems, then a PEG or radiologically inserted gastrostomy (RIG) tube can be inserted. Patients on long-term feeding should
be reviewed regularly as swallow can return many months later and
oral feeding can gradually be introduced and sometimes tubes can be
removed.
2It is important to understand that artiﬁcial feeding by any method
does not prevent aspiration and in some cases can aggravate it. See
b ‘The ethics of clinically assisted feeding’, p.360, for discussion of the
ethics of feeding.

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Stroke units
Deﬁnition
Geographically deﬁned unit staffed by a coordinated MDT with expertise
in stroke. The gold standard is to admit stroke patients directly and continue care through to discharge—known as a comprehensive stroke unit.
Some units deal with acute admissions only, others with the post-acute
rehabilitation phase only. There is evidence for stroke-speciﬁc early supported discharge schemes reducing death or dependency.

Beneﬁts
Stroke units when compared with general ward care result in lower rates
of death, dependency, and institutional care, without lengthening hospital
stay. The number needed to treat in a stroke unit to prevent one death or
dependency is 18.

Rationale
The majority of improvement seems to occur in the ﬁrst 4 weeks, and the
mechanism is unclear.
Key components of stroke units include:
• Meticulous attention to physiological homeostasis
• Attention to prevention of complications (such as thromboembolic
disease and pressure sores)
• Early mobilization
• Coordinated MDT care
• Interest, expertise, and motivation of staff
• The individual impact of each of these is unknown, but combined they
confer signiﬁcant beneﬁts to the stroke patient

Stroke Unit Trialists Collaboration, Cochrane Review online: M www2.cochrane.org/reviews/en/
ab000197.html.

STROKE UNITS

HOW TO . . . Estimate prognosis after stroke
After ﬁrst-ever stroke, death occurs in 12% by a week, in 31% at 1 year,
and in 60% at 5 years. Indicators of a poor prognosis include:
• Impaired consciousness
• Gaze preference
• Dense weakness
• Cardiac comorbidity
• Urinary incontinence
• Pupillary abnormalities
The risk of recurrent stroke among survivors is 10–16% at 1 year, thereafter falling to about 4–5% per annum. The risk is higher with increasing
number of risk factors.
Recovery is usually slow, and a clear time-frame established early on
in the disease with the patient and the relatives is helpful. Recovery is
most rapid in the ﬁrst 3 months, and this tends to be ‘front loaded’ so the
most dramatic improvements occur in the early weeks. Recovery then
tends to slow, but may continue for up to 2 years.
2Each patient is different—recovery may be delayed by infections,
depression etc., and this time-frame should be a guide only.
The risk of not returning to independence varies with stroke type.
Overall, about 20–30% of survivors are dependent at a year, and 40–50%
are independent.

191

192

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Thrombolysis
Rationale
In acute ischaemic stroke, an artery becomes occluded by thrombus in
situ or embolus, and blood supply is compromised. Death of surrounding
brain tissue results in deﬁcits in function associated with that part of the
brain. Early recanalization of the vessel by lysing thrombus may limit the
extent of brain injury. The agent used is iv recombinant tPA (r-tPA).

Risks
Treatment with thrombolysis leads to an excess in death due to intracranial haemorrhage (a ﬁvefold increase compared with placebo).

Beneﬁts
Despite early excess of deaths due to haemorrhage, treatment with
thrombolysis leads to 44 fewer dead or dependent patients per 1000
treated with r-tPA within 6hr, and 126 fewer dead or dependent patients
per 1000 treated with r-tPA within 3hr.

Imaging
This should be done prior to giving thrombolysis to exclude haemorrhage.
Perfusion- and diffusion-weighted MR scans may give more information
than CT. CT perfusion is being used more frequently. All need to be interpreted by someone with the appropriate experience prior to thrombolysis.
Plain axial CT remains the mainstay of imaging prior to thrombolysis.

Use
Thrombolysis is recommended in centres with sufﬁcient expertise in
stroke, and with facilities to deal with complications. In these centres,
iv r-tPA is considered in all patients with deﬁnite ischaemic stroke who
present within 3hr of the onset of symptoms. Where this expertise
doesn’t exist, the service may still be provided via telemedicine links with
stroke ‘hubs’. Careful discussion with the patient and family of risks and
beneﬁts is required.

Exclusion criteria
There is a very long list of exclusions but the following are the commonest
reasons to withhold treatment:
• Previous haemorrhage or active bleeding site
• Seizure at onset
• Impaired coagulation
• Caution with very severe stroke

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Ongoing management
Should involve all of the MDT:

Dietician
Calculate food and ﬂuid requirements for each individual patient; adapt
diet for speciﬁc needs (eg diabetic, weight loss); develop regimens for NG
or PEG feeds; advise on provision of modiﬁed diets for stages of swallow
recovery (thickened, pureed, etc.); review nutrition as recovery alters
needs.

Doctors
Diagnosis; manage medical complications; establish therapies.

Nurses
Monitor patient continuously; assist with basic care (physiological and
physical); ongoing bowel and bladder management; ongoing skin care;
facilitate practise of skills acquired in therapy; promote functional independence; ﬁrst point of call for relatives.

Occupational therapist
Optimize functional ability (usually begin with upper limb work, coordinating with the physiotherapist); speciﬁc assessments of certain tasks
(washing and dressing, kitchen safety, occupational tasks, etc.) as recovery
continues; adaptation to home environment by a series of home visits,
with and without the patient, and the supply of aids (rails, bed levers, toilet
raises, bath boards, etc.), provision of wheelchairs where needed.

Pharmacist
Review charts; promote safe prescribing.

Physiotherapist
Assess muscle tone, movement and mobility; maximize functional independence by education and exercise; monitor respiratory function; initial bed
mobility, then work on sitting balance, then transfers and ﬁnally standing
and stepping; help prevent complications such as shoulder pain, contractures and immobility associated problems (pressure sores, DVT/PE).

Psychologist
Assess psychological impact of stroke on patient and family; allow the
patient to talk about the impact of the illness; monitor for depression and
other mood disorder, highlighting the need for medication; document
cognitive impairment; assist in retraining where neglect is prominent.

Social worker
Psychosocial assessment of patient and family; support with ﬁnancial
matters (accessing pension, arranging power of attorney, ﬁnancing placement etc.); advice and support for patient and family on accommodation
needs, especially ﬁnding a care home placement; link to community services
(care package, community rehabilitation, day centres, etc.)

ONGOING MANAGEMENT

Speech and language therapist
Assess swallow (bedside video swallow testing) and establish plan for
safe oral intake; reassess, and plan nutritional route during recovery; language screening (dysarthria, dysphasia and dyspraxia) with intervention to
improve deﬁcits.

HOW TO . . . Protect your patient from another stroke
Ensure that the following are addressed:
• Lifestyle issues—smoking, diet and exercise
• Antiplatelet therapy:
• Aspirin reduces relative risk of further event by about 25%. Dose
probably not important—generally use 75–300mg.
• Events that occur on aspirin (‘aspirin failures’) do not necessarily
imply that aspirin is inadequate, but there may be an argument for
increasing the dose (may be dose-dependent aspirin resistance),
adding another antiplatelet agent (eg dipyridamole) or changing
the agent (eg to clopidogrel)
• Adding clopidogrel to aspirin increases antiplatelet activity, but
has been shown to increase the risk of cerebral haemorrhage and
is no longer recommended for secondary prevention
• Lower blood pressure—choice of agent debated. The important
thing is probably just to lower the blood pressure, but there is some
evidence for the use of ACE inhibitors and thiazide diuretics as ﬁrst
line. If there are no contraindications, lowering blood pressure per se
is likely to be beneﬁcial, but aim for <130/85.
• Lower cholesterol—known for some time that lowering
cholesterol is useful secondary prevention in coronary disease,
but only recently in the Heart Protection Study, beneﬁt has also
been shown in stroke, speciﬁcally in older patients. The cut-off for
treatment in this trial was 3.5, and so, as with BP, it may be the lower
the better.
• Anticoagulation for AF—(see b ‘Atrial ﬁbrillation’, p.276). In
infarction, likely to be safe to start warfarin after 2 weeks. With
haemorrhage, judge each case individually (probably wait several
months for haemorrhagic transformation; may never be appropriate
in primary bleed)
• Carotid endarterectomy—>70% symptomatic stenosis carries
a stroke risk of about 15% per year, and is an indication for
endarterectomy where there is good recovery and the patient is ﬁt
for surgery (which can be done with local anaesthesia). Perform early
for greater beneﬁt
See also b ‘Vascular secondary prevention’, p.308.

195

196

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Complications
Contractures
Longer-term complication. See b ‘Contractures’, p.485.

Faecal incontinence
May be due to immobility, cognitive problems, or neurological impairment. Regulate bowel habit where possible with high-ﬁbre diet and good
ﬂuid intake and toilet regularly. If all else fails then deliberately constipating the patient with codeine and using regular enemas can work.
See b ‘Faecal incontinence: management’, p.544.

Infection
Commonly chest or urine. Think of it early if a patient becomes drowsy,
confused or appears to deteriorate neurologically. Prompt screening
for sepsis and treatment with antibiotics, oxygen and hydration are indicated in the majority of patients in the acute phase (stroke outcome very
unclear initially) but may be withheld in a more established stroke where
the prognosis can more conﬁdently be assessed as dismal (decision made
with the family).

Muscle spasm
Very common on affected side. Arthritic joints are exacerbated by spasm,
and antispasmodics may need to be used alongside analgesia for effective
pain relief. Try baclofen 5mg, or tizanidine. Increase dose slowly after a
few days if needed but watch out for drowsiness and loss of tone in the
affected side that can hinder therapy.

Pain
Commonly shoulder pain in a paralysed arm. Usually multifactorial,
eg joint subluxation (treat with physiotherapy to strengthen muscles and
arm support) interacting with muscle spasm and shoulder arthritis. Central
post-stroke pain tends to affect all of the affected side and can be treated
with amitriptyline (start low, eg 10mg at night).

Pressure sores
Should be avoidable in the majority of patients (see b ‘Pressure
sores’, p.502).

Psychological problems
Low mood is extremely common post-stroke (at 4 months, 25% will be
depressed, and over half of these remain depressed at a year). This is
unrelated to the stroke type, but is associated with a worse outcome
(perhaps because of lower motivation in therapy). It should be actively
sought (the screening question ‘Do you think you are depressed?’ is quick
and effective; it may also be noticed by nurses, therapists or family; tools
such as the GDS can also be used, but may be confounded by dysphasia).
Treatment is with psychosocial support and antidepressants (eg citalopram 20mg). Anxiety is also very common, and often responds to explanation and empowerment.

COMPLICATIONS

Thromboembolism
Very common post-stroke especially if very immobile. Mobilize early.
Low-dose low molecular weight heparin is sometimes used after the
acute stage (when risk of haemorrhage into brain diminishes). Have a low
threshold for investigating a leg that becomes swollen or painful.

HOW TO . . . Manage urinary incontinence after stroke
This is very common, more so after severe stroke. It does, however,
improve over time, and a ﬂexible approach is required to ensure that a
patient does not get catheterized and remain so.
• Initially, try to manage with pads and regular toileting
• If the skin starts to break down, or if the burden on carers is heavy,
then a catheter can be inserted for a limited time span
• Once mobility improves, try removing the catheter—ensure
this is seen by all as a positive and exciting step back towards
independence, as it can cause considerable anxiety
• If this fails, check for and treat UTI then try again
• If this fails, then replace the catheter and use bladder stabilizing
agents for about 2 weeks (eg tolterodine 2mg bd) before removing it
again
• If all this fails, consider sheath catheter devices or bottles (with nonreturn valves for use in bed) in men; commodes next to the bed for
women
2The need for a permanent catheter post-stroke should be reviewed
regularly as the condition is likely to improve. See b ‘Urinary incontinence: causes’, p.532.

197

198

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Longer-term issues
Return to the community
Best coordinated by the stroke MDT. Early supported discharge may be
useful if the patient can transfer, and there is a specialist community
stroke team available. Later discharges are planned by the team, usually
after careful assessment of needs (home alterations, care packages, etc.)
The general practitioner should be alerted to continue medical monitoring, in particular optimizing secondary prevention. Community teams
(district nurses, community rehabilitation teams, home carers, etc.) should
be aware of the patient’s needs (continence, diabetic monitoring, ongoing
therapy needs, etc.) and ideally be involved in the discharge planning. The
patient and family should have adequate information and training, as well
as a contact point in case of problems (stroke coordinators often take this
role). Voluntary agencies (eg the Stroke Association) are helpful, and the
patient should be informed about them.

Driving regulations with cerebrovascular disease
• TIA/stroke with full neurological recovery—1 month off driving
• Recurrent TIAs—3 months off driving following last TIA
• Stroke with residual neurological deﬁcit after 1 month—the patient
must notify the DVLA, and the decision is made on a case-by-case
basis, with evidence from medical reports
• Hemianopia, inattention, and impaired cognition are deﬁnite markers of
lack of ﬁtness to drive (can be decided by a GP, or hospital physician).
• Dysphasia is harder—cognitive state is difﬁcult to assess and associated
impairments (such as problems reading street signs or misinterpreting
the environment) are not readily identiﬁed out of context.
• Pure limb weakness can often be safely managed with car adaptation. If
there are any doubts and the patient wishes to drive then they should
be seen in a driving assessment centre (the patient will have to pay).
• Stroke with seizure—this is treated as a provoked seizure. May be
<1 year ban, depending on circumstances.
See M www.dft.gov.uk/dvla/medical/ataglance.aspx.

Follow-up
Some follow up should be offered to all stroke survivors. The intensity
and duration of inpatient care can contrast sharply with home. The realities of living with disability begin to sink in, and many questions and anxieties arise. Even minor strokes or TIAs require a further point of contact,
as they will have been committed to lifelong medication and will need
monitoring of risk factors. In addition, stroke recovery continues (albeit at
a slower pace) for up to 2 years (or even longer) and management plans
made at discharge may need to be adapted.

Checklist for follow-up
(Usually 2–4 months after discharge)
Secondary prevention
Check drugs, blood pressure, diabetic control and cardiac rhythm
Continence
• Are there continence problems?
• If a catheter is in situ, has mobility improved to a point at which trial
removal can be done?
• If the patient was discharged on bladder stabilizing drugs, and has
remained continent, can these be tailed off?
Nutrition
• Is nutrition adequate? (if not, refer to dietician)
• If a PEG tube is in place, is it still required?
• Does the patient warrant another assessment of swallowing (by
SALT) to allow oral nutrition to begin?
Communication and speech
• Are there problems still?
• Is there a need for a SALT review?
Mood
• Is the patient depressed?
• Do they need referral to a psychologist or (rarely) psychiatrist?
• If discharged on an antidepressant, can it be discontinued?
Physical progress
• Is there ongoing physical therapy?
• If not, is there continued improvement? If there has been
deterioration then refer back for assessment for further therapy
(Royal College of Physicians’ guidelines)
Contractures
• Are there any contractures developing? (If so, refer to physiotherapy)
Muscle spasms
• Have these developed, or lessened since discharge?
• Review need for anti-spasmodic medication—titrate down if no
longer required
Pain
• Commonly in shoulder, or post-stroke pain
• Has this developed, or lessened?
• Review need for medications
Daily living
• Are there any issues in managing day to day?
• Is all the necessary equipment in place? (and is it still needed, eg a
commode can be returned when the patient is able to mobilize to
the toilet alone)
• Is there anything that they would like to be able to do that they
cannot? (eg read a book, take a bath)
• Would a further review by a therapist be helpful?
• Do they wish to drive? (See b ‘Longer-term issues, p.198)
Support
• Are they in contact with a community stroke coordinator (if available)?
• Are they aware of voluntary organizations?

CHAPTER 8

Stroke

Transient ischaemic attack clinics
Rapid outpatient assessment of TIA and minor stroke, to establish diagnosis,
commence secondary prevention and lower risk of subsequent event.

How fast?
This depends on how high a risk the patient is. Use the ABCD2 score
(see Table 8.3) and if the score is t4, the patient should be seen within
24hr—in some services these patients are admitted to hospital but larger
centres may provide 7 day/week outpatient services. Patients who have
recurrent symptoms within a week or those in AF should also be seen
urgently. Those at lower risk should still be seen within 7 days.
Currently early antiplatelet agents, antihypertensives, and statin use
have been shown to substantially reduce the chances of stroke at 1 week.
Warfarin for patients with AF and early endarterectomy are also known
to be beneﬁcial for a subset of patients.

Function
• Conﬁrm diagnosis—very variable, but up to a third of referrals to a TIA
clinic are non-cerebrovascular. Main alternatives are migraine, epilepsy,
cardiac dysrhythmias, orthostatic hypotension, or rarely brain tumour
• Arrange investigations—to aid diagnosis (eg CT brain) or investigate risk
factors (eg FBC, ESR, glucose, cholesterol, ECG, carotid Doppler, 24hr
tape and echocardiogram)
• Modify risk factors—(see b ‘HOW TO . . . Protect your patient
from another stroke’, p.195) set targets for blood pressure and
glucose control, advise about antiplatelet agents (there is signiﬁcant
regional variation in the therapy chosen including aspirin alone,
aspirin with modiﬁed release dipyridamole, or clopidogrel alone)
and anticoagulation in AF, advise about statin use, refer for carotid
endarterectomy urgently, advise about smoking cessation
• Education—of patients, relatives, primary care doctors. Discuss stroke
disease and its modiﬁcation, time-frame for recovery, psychological
aspects of stroke, driving restrictions

Structure
Varies enormously. Ideally would have:
• Rapid referral protocol—perhaps a standard referral sheet and fax
number for GPs, perhaps via a single phone call to an answering
machine
• Stroke specialist nurse—can take history including standardized risk
factor analysis, measure BP, provide education (leaﬂets, individual
action plans), coordinate investigations and follow-up. Role can be
extended into community—point of access for patients
• Time for explanation—many patients will feel overwhelmed by the
amount if information they are being given. The specialist nurse can
be very helpful in clarifying things, and information leaﬂets allow
the information to be revisited at home. There are often several
new tablets, or even suggesting surgery for a patient who feels well.
Comprehension is vital for concordance

TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK CLINICS

• Rapid access to investigations—particularly carotid Doppler, CT
scanning, and echocardiography. Many clinics run a ‘one-stop’ service,
where all assessments, investigations, and conclusions are completed at
a single visit
• Prompt communication to GP—advice about risk reduction must be
relayed promptly to the GP for maximum beneﬁt. Ideally same day by
fax or delivered by the patient

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Cognitive ageing
Cognitive, or thinking, ability is the product of:
• ‘Fixed intelligence’, the result of previous thinking, which often
increases with age, ie ‘wisdom’
• ‘Fluid intelligence’, ie real-time information processing, which declines
modestly in older age
There are structural changes in the brain with age (see b ‘The ageing brain
and nervous system’, p.152) but these correlate poorly with cognitive
changes. Broadly, intellectual function is maintained until at least 80 years,
but processing is slower. Non-critical impairments include forgetfulness,
modestly reduced vocabulary, and slower learning of, eg, languages. These
changes are to be expected, their consequences can be managed, and they
do not cause signiﬁcant reduction in functional level.
Three factors support a diagnosis of normal ageing rather than disease:
• The ability to maintain function in normal life through aids (eg aidesmemoire: lists or calendars) or adaptations (of one’s environment or of
one’s expectations)
• Very long time scale of decline: 10–30 years, compared with months or
a few years in disease
• Relative decline, eg the academic who no longer holds his own at the
graduates’ reunion

IMPAIRMENTS IN COGNITIVE FUNCTION WITHOUT DEMENTIA

Impairments in cognitive function
without dementia
Age-associated memory impairment (AAMI) or benign
senescent forgetfulness
Older people learn new information and recall information more slowly,
but given time their performance is unchanged. This is distinct from the
impairment in dementia, in that in AAMI, overall function is unimpaired,
and usually only less important facts are forgotten. It is often more bothersome to the patient than a concern to relatives (compare dementia,
when often the family are much more concerned than the patient).
AAMI can present early (age 40s–50s) when high achievers become
frustrated by modest deterioration in speed of new learning. It may be
exacerbated by performance anxiety, creating a vicious cycle, and is often
helped by psychological strategies to assist memory.

Minimal cognitive impairment(MCI) or cognitive
impairment no dementia (CIND)
Impairments are more broad than memory alone, and are felt to be pathological (eg secondary to cerebrovascular disease), but the full criteria for a
diagnosis of dementia are not met—eg because there is not yet signiﬁcant
impact on day-to-day functioning.
Progression to dementia occurs in between 5% (community studies)
and 10% (memory clinic studies) annually. Thus with time, many
patients do develop dementia, but many do not, and in some there is no
deterioration.
Diagnosis is important in order to:
• Reassure the patient (by distinguishing from dementia)
• Modify risk factors for progression
• Monitor deterioration such that intervention can begin promptly if
progression occurs

205

206

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: overview
Dementia is:
• An acquired decline in memory and other cognitive function(s)
• In an alert (ie non-delirious) person
• Sufﬁciently severe to affect daily life (home, social function)
All three elements must be present in order to make the diagnosis.
Prevalence increases dramatically with age: 1% of 60–65 year olds, >30%
of over 85s. Over 50% of nursing home residents have dementia.
Major dementia syndromes (and proportion of cases in older people)
include:
• Mixed pathology—(especially Alzheimer’s and vascular) is the
commonest type in postmortem studies
• Dementia of Alzheimer type (60%)
• Vascular dementia (30%)
• Other neurodegenerative dementias (15%), eg dementia with Lewy
bodies, Parkinson’s disease with dementia, frontotemporal dementia
• Reversible dementias (<5%), eg drugs, metabolic, subdural, normal
pressure hydrocephalus
Diagnostically, there are many false-positive and false-negative cases. Mild
to moderate dementia is easy to miss on a cursory, unstructured assessment. Patients labelled incorrectly as having dementia may be deaf, dysphasic, delirious, depressed, or under the inﬂuence of drugs.

Triggers for considering a dementia diagnosis
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Delirium (much commoner with underlying dementia)
‘Unmasking’ of poor cognition after spouse’s death
Social withdrawal
Request for social services help
Poor concordance with prescribed drug therapy
Domestic crisis (eg ﬁre, road trafﬁc accident)
Spouse/family disproportionately in control or speaking for patient

UK National Dementia Strategy
This was published by the UK government in 2009 and promises a greater
focus on accelerating the pace of improvement in dementia care, through
local delivery of quality outcomes and local accountability for achieving
them. This reﬂects an increasing interest in dementia management across
the NHS
See M www.dh.gov.uk/en/SocialCare/NationalDementiaStrategy

DEMENTIA: OVERVIEW

HOW TO . . . Distinguish delirium from dementia
The most common issue in diagnosing the older patient with confusion
(‘brain failure’) is whether the patient has delirium alone, dementia
alone, or a delirium superimposed on a pre-existing dementia.
Achieve this by combining information from the history with a physical
and mental state examination.
2The history is key. The duration of symptoms is most important.
Information from medical records, carers, and family will help determine
whether dementia was present before onset of delirium. ‘When was his
memory last as good as yours?’ (Table 9.1)

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: assessment
The most important component of assessment. Obtain information from
both patient and family/friends. Note onset, speed of progression, symptoms. Take a careful drug history, including over-the-counter drugs and
recreational drugs (especially alcohol). Also ask about a family history of
early dementia and a personal psychiatric history of, eg, depression.
Usually there is a progressive decline in cognitive function over several
years, ending with complete dependency and death (usually due to
dehydration, malnutrition, and/or sepsis).
Deterioration may be
• Insidious and gradual (eg Alzheimer’s)
• Stepwise (suggesting stroke/vascular aetiology)
• Abrupt (after a single critical stroke)
• Rapid over weeks/months, suggesting a drug, metabolic, or structural
cause (eg tumour, subdural)
Abnormalities occur in:
• Retention of new information (eg appointments, events, working a new
household appliance); short-term memory loss is often severe, with
repetitive questioning
• Managing complex tasks (eg paying bills, cooking a meal for family)
• Language (word-ﬁnding difﬁculty with circumlocution, inability to hold
a conversation)
• Behaviour (eg irritability, aggression, poor motivation, wandering)
• Orientation (eg getting lost in familiar places)
• Recognition (failure to recognize ﬁrst acquaintances, then friends or
distant family, then close family, eg spouse)
• Ability to self-care (grooming, bathing, dressing, continence/toileting)
• Reasoning: poor judgement, irrational or unaccustomed behaviours
• Ability to recognize familiar objects, people, and places (agnosia)
• Ability to carry out complex, coordinated movements (apraxia)

Physical examination
• To determine possible causes of a dementia syndrome, including
reversible factors
• Look for vascular disease (cardiovascular, peripheral vascular
and cerebrovascular), neuropathy, parkinsonism, thyroid disease,
malignancy, dehydration, (alcoholic) liver disease
• In advanced dementia of any type primitive reﬂexes (eg grasp, suckling,
palmar-mental) and global hyperreﬂexia with extensor planters may
occur

DEMENTIA: ASSESSMENT

Mental state
• Exclude delirium. Features include agitation, restlessness, poor attention
and ﬂuctuating conscious level (see b Appendix, ‘CAM’, p.692)
• Exclude depression. Features include low affect, poor motivation and
a negative perspective. Perform a GDS (see b Appendix, ‘Geriatric
Depression Scale’, p.687)
• Measure cognitive function. Serial testing may be helpful in borderline
cases—is there evidence of progression? Many measurement tools are
available, eg MMSE, Mini-Cog, number of animals named in 1min, clockdrawing test (see b ‘Measurement instruments’, p.78, b Appendix,
‘The abbreviated mental test score’, p.690, and b Appendix, ‘Clockdrawing and the Mini-Cog™’, p.693)
Full neuropsychological assessment (detailed, prolonged assessment by a
specialist psychologist) may be helpful in:
• Distinguishing between dementia and depression
• Distinguishing between different subtypes of dementia
• Distinguishing between AAMI and early dementia
• Distinguishing between focal impairments (eg aphasic or amnesic
syndromes) and dementia
• Measuring progression and response to treatment

Disclosure of dementia diagnosis
Each case should be considered individually, but in general the diagnosis should be revealed. Disclosure:
• Is consistent with the patient’s right to know (autonomy). Most older
people say that they would want to know the diagnosis
• Facilitates medical, ﬁnancial, and care planning, eg advance directives,
powers of attorney, living arrangements
• Allows for consent to treatment and facilitates participation in
research
• Facilitates discussion between patient and carer
Arguments against disclosure include a possible depressive reaction,
accentuated by a perceived lack of effective treatments. Such a reaction
is minimized by sensitive multidisciplinary support that emphasizes the
positive therapeutic solutions available.

209

210

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

HOW TO . . . Investigate a patient with dementia
Cases of reversible dementia are uncommon, but their identiﬁcation
is important, as effective treatment may reverse the impairment and
prevent progression. Therefore screen for them.

Blood tests
The following are generally considered useful: FBC, ESR, B12, folate,
U,C+E, calcium, LFTs, TSH, CRP, random glucose
Request syphilis and HIV serology only if there are atypical features or
special risks.

ECG and CXR
(Evidence of heart disease, occult malignancy.)

Neuroimaging
It is arguable whether every person with dementia should undergo
brain imaging. Imaging is indicated where there is:
• Early onset (<60 years)
• Sudden onset or brisk decline
• High risk of structural pathology (eg known cancer, falls with head
injury)
• Focal CNS signs or symptoms
In more typical cases suggestive of either Alzheimer’s, vascular, or mixed
(Alzheimer’s-vascular) dementia, the diagnostic yield is very low. Thus,
in most cases, imaging does not alter the clinical management based
on history, examination, and lab tests alone. If a patient or carer is particularly anxious (eg fear of brain tumour), imaging may help allay fears,
although of course dementia is a far from a benign diagnosis.
• CT is the usual imaging modality
• MRI identiﬁes posterior circulation vascular pathology with much
greater sensitivity
• SPECT is used rarely, usually in specialist centres, to more reliably
differentiate between Alzheimer’s and vascular dementia
Additional testing as clinically indicated:
• EEG is used for suspected frontotemporal dementia or Creutzfeldt–
Jakob disease (CJD), or where seizure activity is a possibility
• Lumbar puncture where CNS infection is considered

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: common diseases
Alzheimer’s disease (dementia of Alzheimer type)
• The most common cause of a dementia syndrome
• Diagnosis is made clinically, based on the typical history, mental state
examination, and unremarkable physical examination
• History—insidious onset, with slow progression over years. Early,
profound short-term memory loss progresses to include broad,
often global cognitive dysfunction, behavioural change and functional
impairment. Behavioural problems are common, usually occurring
in moderate to severe dementia, but sometimes preceding overt
cognitive impairment
• Physical examination—normal
• Neuroimaging—demonstrates no other causes of dementia (eg tumour
or infarct) and may show disproportionate medial temporal lobe
atrophy
• Treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be indicated
(see b ‘Dementia: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors’, p.224)
• Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (<65 years) is uncommon, has a
stronger genetic component, and is more rapidly progressive

Vascular dementia
• The next most common cause
• Suggested by vascular risk factors, eg diabetes mellitus, hypertension,
smoking or other vascular pathology, with other supporting evidence
on history, examination, or tests
• History—cognitive impairment may be patchy, compared with the
more uniform impairments seen in Alzheimer’s disease. Onset is often
associated with stroke, or the deterioration is abrupt or stepwise,
however, using ‘multi-infarct dementia’ as a synonym for vascular
dementia is imprecise and its use should be discouraged. Frontal lobe,
extrapyramidal, pseudobulbar features, and emotional lability are
common. Urinary incontinence and falls without other explanation are
often early features. Other features may be mostly cortical (mimicking
Alzheimer’s disease) or subcortical (eg apathy, depression)
• Physical examination often shows:
• Focal neurology suggesting stroke or diffuse cerebrovascular disease
(hyperreﬂexia, extensor plantars, abnormal gait, etc.)
• Other evidence of vascular pathology, eg AF, peripheral vascular
disease
• Neuroimaging shows either:
• Multiple large vessel infarcts
• A single critical infarct (eg thalamus)
• White matter infarcts or periventricular white matter changes
• Microvascular disease, too ﬁne to be seen on neuroimaging, may
cause a signiﬁcant proportion of vascular dementia, apparent only
post-mortem

DEMENTIA: COMMON DISEASES

Differentiating between Alzheimer’s and vascular
dementia
The importance of differentiating between Alzheimer’s and vascular
dementia can be overemphasized. Their presentations overlap, and
pathologies commonly coexist. Increasingly it is believed that much
Alzheimer’s disease pathology has a vascular component.
Pragmatically:
• In cases where vascular risk factors and/or signs exist, treat
vascular risk factors aggressively, whether or not there is signiﬁcant
cerebrovascular pathology on brain imaging
• A trial of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (effective in Alzheimer’s but
much weaker evidence in vascular dementia), is probably worthwhile
where vascular risk factors and/or pathology exists, but Alzheimer’s
may be contributing to the presentation

213

214

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia and parkinsonism
Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease with dementia may
be considered as extremes of a continuum. In the latter, motor impairments precede cognitive impairments and are more severe. In dementia
with Lewy bodies, cognitive and behavioural impairments precede motor
phenomena and are more severe. There are frequently additional contributions from Alzheimer’s or vascular pathology. There are believed to be
common pathological processes in all these dementia syndromes.

Dementia with Lewy bodies
• A gradually progressive background dementia, with insidious onset
• Shorter-term ﬂuctuations in cognitive function and alertness
• Prominent auditory or visual hallucinations, often with paranoia and
delusions
• Parkinsonism is commonly present, but often not severe
• Typical antipsychotics (eg haloperidol) are very poorly tolerated,
leading to worsening confusion or deterioration of parkinsonism.
Atypical antipsychotics (eg risperidone, and especially quetiapine) may
be better tolerated, but great caution is advised in their use
• Levodopa or dopamine agonists may worsen confusion
• Anticholinergics (eg rivastigmine) are effective, especially for
hallucinations and behavioural disturbance
Note that several features are common to both dementia with Lewy
bodies and delirium, eg ﬂuctuations, effect of drugs, perceptual, and psychotic phenomena. When comparing the two, the following is true of
dementia with Lewy bodies:
• Onset is insidious and progression gradual
• No precipitating illness (eg infection) is found
• Hallucinations are complex and not the result of misperception of stimuli
• Delusions (commonly complex auditory or visual) are well-formed and
may be persistent
• Syncope frequently occurs
• Antipsychotics worsen status (not indicated as a diagnostic trial)

Parkinson’s disease with dementia
• People with Parkinson’s disease are much more likely to develop
dementia, especially older people, those in the later stages of the
disease and those who become confused on Parkinson’s medication
• Typical motor features of Parkinson’s disease are present, and may be
severe
• The presentation and neuropathology is variable, and may resemble
Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, or dementia with Lewy bodies
• By deﬁnition, if features of Parkinson’s precede dementia by more
than a year, then the diagnosis is of Parkinson’s disease with dementia,
not dementia with Lewy bodies. This applies even if the dementia
syndrome is otherwise typical of dementia with Lewy bodies
• Multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and
corticobasal degeneration also present with both parkinsonism and
dementia

DEMENTIA AND PARKINSONISM

Minimal cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease
Many patients with PD have subtle impairments of cognition, too mild to
justify a diagnosis of dementia. Slowed thinking and deﬁcits in visuospatial,
attention and executive function are commonly seen.

215

216

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Normal pressure hydrocephalus
Normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) classically presents with the triad:
• Gait disturbance (wide-based)
• Incontinence of urine
• Cognitive impairment (psychomotor slowing, apathy, appear
depressed)
2Most patients with this triad have other (unrelated) causes, or have
diffuse cerebrovascular disease.

Assessment
Neuroimaging
• Shows ventricles that are enlarged disproportionately compared with
the degree of cerebral atrophy
• Neuroimaging for unrelated reasons (eg TIA) may reveal ventricular
enlargement that appears disproportionate to the degree of cerebral
atrophy, suggesting possible NPH. In the absence of clinical features
of NPH, the diagnosis cannot be supported, and the patient may be
reassured.
Lumbar puncture
• Diagnostic and therapeutic procedure
• Usually performed if clinical and radiological ﬁndings suggestive of NPH
• Before the procedure, assess baseline gait (eg timed walk) and
cognition (eg MMSE, clock-drawing test)
• Opening pressure is normal in NPH
• Remove 20–30mL of cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF)
• Check for improvement in gait and cognition after 1–2hr

Treatment
Ventriculoperitoneal shunting is effective for some, but many do not
beneﬁt. Gait is more likely to improve than is cognition.
It is a major procedure, and complications are common, eg infection
and subdural haematoma. Decision to proceed requires:
• A conﬁdent diagnosis (may require specialist neurological review)
• Support of patient and carer for the procedure
• An assessment that the likelihood of beneﬁt is high
Beneﬁt is more likely in those who:
• Have a short history (days or weeks)
• Have a known cause—usually trauma or subarachnoid haemorrhage
• Have normal brain substance on neuroimaging
• Have no signiﬁcant comorbidities. Cerebrovascular disease is especially
relevant
• Beneﬁt from lumbar puncture and large volume CSF removal

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: less common diseases
Frontotemporal dementia
• Neurodegenerative disease, with insidious onset and slow
(several years) progression
• Family history is positive in 50% of cases
• Onset is often early (age 35–75), and either behavioural or language
difﬁculties dominate the clinical picture. Forgetfulness is mild. Insight is
lost early. Difﬁculties at work may be the ﬁrst sign
• Commonly used assessment tools (eg MMSE) do not test frontal
lobe function, so do not be put off the diagnosis by ‘normal’ cognitive
screening tests
• Behavioural problems are most common and include disinhibition,
mental rigidity, inﬂexibility, impairment of executive function,
decreased personal care, and repetitive behaviours
• Language dysfunction may include word-ﬁnding difﬁculty, problems
naming or understanding words, lack of spontaneous conversation or
circumlocution
• Later, impairments become more broad, similar to severe Alzheimer’s
• Primitive reﬂexes (eg grasp, palmar-mental) may be found
• Neuroimaging usually demonstrates frontal and/or temporal atrophy
• Frontotemporal dementia presents as a clinical spectrum. More speciﬁc
conditions within that spectrum include:
• Frontal lobe degeneration. Frontal greater than temporal
degeneration
• Pick’s disease. Similar to frontal lobe degeneration, but uncommon.
Classical ‘Pick bodies’ seen postmortem
• Motor neuron disease (MND) with dementia. Usually late in the
progression of MND (see b ‘Motor neuron disease’, p.170)
• Progressive non-ﬂuent aphasia and semantic dementia. Temporal
degeneration

Dementia and infection
• Neurosyphilis is becoming more common again. Serological tests for
syphilis should be performed if a dementia syndrome has atypical
features (eg seizures) or risk factors for sexually transmitted disease
(STD) (including mental illness, history of other STD, drug/alcohol
abuse). Beware false-positive serological tests in African Caribbeans
with a history of yaws. If neurosyphilis seems possible, sample CSF and
seek microbiology advice with a view to penicillin treatment
• HIV-associated dementia generally affects younger people, reﬂecting the
epidemiology of HIV infection. It occurs late in HIV, rarely if at all at
presentation
• CJD is a prion-mediated, rapidly progressive cortical dementia.
Myoclonus is found on physical examination. Psychosis occurs early

DEMENTIA: LESS COMMON DISEASES

Vasculitis
• Suggested by elevated CRP/ESR without other cause or characteristic
CT/MRI (periventricular lesions)
• Heterogeneous presentation, including as delirium or dementia
• Examine the patient for evidence of systemic vasculitis
• Perform serology (eg anti-nuclear antibody) and lumbar puncture with
CSF tests to exclude infection/neoplasm
• Potentially treatable, so pursue this diagnosis vigorously if necessary.
Specialist referral usually indicated

Dementia and drugs/toxins
• Alcohol-associated dementia may occur after many years of heavy
drinking, presenting with disproportionate short-term memory
impairment (see b ‘Confusion and alcohol’, p.244)
• Psychoactive drugs may cause a dementia-like syndrome that is
substantially reversible

219

220

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: general management
General
• Modify reversible aggravating factors, commonly multiple but minor
(eg constipation, low-grade sepsis, mild anaemia, drug side-effects)
• Treat depression. SSRIs are much preferred to tricyclics. Repeat
cognitive assessment 2–4 months after treatment to determine if
cognitive impairment remains

Social
• Encourage physical and mental activity, including social activities
(eg social clubs, day centres, see b ‘Day hospitals’, p.22)
• Create a safe, caring environment, usually in the patient’s own home.
A predictable routine is helpful. OT home assessment identiﬁes
hazards, provides visual safety cues, etc.
• Organise carers to assist with ADLs, prompt medication, etc.
• Support caregivers:
• Enquire about caregiver burden, and psychiatric symptoms
• Caregiver support groups
• Respite care—usually in care homes, for a few days to 2 weeks
• Sitting services—usually for 2–3hr once or twice weekly
• Family Support Visitor—provides emotional and practical support
• Educate patients and families about the disease and how to cope with
its manifestations. This includes appropriate modiﬁcations to the home
environment and learning to communicate and interact with the patient
with dementia. Counselling and support delays admission to care
homes

Practical
• Suggest simple interventions to improve coping (eg lists, calendars,
alarms)
• Simplify medication, and provide dosette boxes or similar, to aid
concordance. In the later stages, drugs such as antihypertensives may
become pointless if not harmful (ie risk > beneﬁt)
• Support and educate patient and carers about legal and ethical issues
including:
• Driving (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage the driver who has
dementia’, p.221)
• Lasting power of attorney (see b ‘Making ﬁnancial decisions’,
p.658)
• Wills (see b ‘Making a will’, p.678)
• Discussion of end-of-life issues (clinically assisted nutrition, comfort
versus life prolongation) may be appropriate.

DEMENTIA: GENERAL MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Manage the driver who has dementia
Road trafﬁc accident and injury risk increase with the severity of
dementia. In most countries it is mandatory for the driver to report
important health factors to the licensing authority, which will then
request further information from the patient’s medical team. Patients
and carers should be reminded of this responsibility at diagnosis.
Assessment of driving ability during a hospital outpatient or general
practice consultation is often difﬁcult. In some cases, whether a patient is
safe to drive will be obvious—either in the very earliest stages of cognitive
impairment, or in more severe dementia. In other cases, usually of mild
(to moderate) cognitive impairment, the following evidence is useful:
• Reports of driving problems, incidents (eg near-misses) or accidents.
Are relatives/friends concerned to get into the passenger seat? Have
they tried but failed to limit or prohibit driving? Some evidence is of
less value, eg getting lost is a poor indicator of safety
• Reports of how driving patterns have changed, and why. Are
journeys now brief, infrequent, and conﬁned to quiet local roads?
• Clinical evidence of major impairment in visuospatial function,
attention or judgement. However, a combination of modest
impairments may be as important
• Presence of non-cognitive impairments (eg visual, joint function) or
other conditions that affect driving safety (eg seizures, syncope)
Each case should be reassessed intermittently, either at regular intervals
or at points prompted by critical incidents. The best assessment of driving
ability is by a professional driving assessor, in the patient’s own vehicle
on the public roads. Such professionals, often occupational therapists,
can deliver the conﬁdent, robust opinion that is often required, as well
as offering useful practical advice to the cognitively or physically impaired
driver. In general:
• It is preferable that the patient, family, and doctor should agree that
stopping voluntarily is advisable. Compulsory licence withdrawal by
the authority generates great anger and distress
• The issue is best discussed early in the course of the disease, when
the patient has best insight
• If driving is safe for the moment, encourage patient and family to
think ahead, to a time when driving cannot be continued—is local
public transport sufﬁcient, or will a spouse have to hone long-lost
driving skills?
Rarely, a patient continues to drive when clearly unsafe and having been
informed that they must stop. In most cases, further clear statements of
this, backed up by the threat of medical reporting to the authorities, are
sufﬁcient to prompt cessation. If driving continues, the clinician is ethically
justiﬁed in reporting this to the authorities, and will usually have the strong
support of the family.

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: risk management and abuse
Risk management is an essential part of care.
• Is there a risk of harm to the patient or to others?
• How great is the risk, over how long is the patient (or other person)
exposed to it, and how severe are the consequences of the risk?
2There is no such thing as ‘safe’ only ‘safer’ and risk management demands
careful balancing between autonomy/quality of life and safety.
Common risks include:
• Falls. Moving from own home to institutional care is rarely the answer.
Supervision is far from continuous in any institution, the environment is
less familiar and the ﬂoors are often uncarpeted and unforgiving
• Wandering. Usually more distressing to carers than presenting risk to
the patient
• Aggression by a patient towards carers or family. Usually verbal, but
sometimes physical or sexual. May lead to carers refusing to work with
patient
• Aggression towards a patient by carers or family. Less easy to identify,
as the patient may not complain, through fear or due to cognitive
problems. Be concerned if there are unexplained ‘falls’ or unusual
patterns of bruising (see b ‘Elder abuse’, p.674)
• Self-neglect. Often with denial. May manifest as poor diet, poor
hygiene etc
• Fire risk. May be easily modiﬁable, through removal or modiﬁcation
of kitchen appliances, gas ﬁres, etc. Cigarette smoking is more
problematic
• Driving. (See b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage the driver who has dementia’,
p.221)
• Financial abuse (see b ‘Elder abuse’, p.674)
• Theft or fraud
• Modiﬁcation of wills
• Misuse or transfer of a patient’s money
Having determined the nature and magnitude of a risk, consider ‘Can the
risk be reduced?’ and ‘Should it be reduced?’
Consider whether the patient is competent to make their own decisions
about risks or whether you are required to act in patient’s ‘best interests’.
If risk reduction can be done without impacting on the patient’s
independence or enjoyment of life, then go ahead.
If reducing risk involves curtailing liberty or restricting enjoyable activity
(walking, wandering, living alone), then consider:
• If competent, what is the patient’s attitude to risk?
• If unable to express this, what was his/her premorbid attitude, and
what would he/she now want?
• What is the view of carers?
Commonly, discussions around risk occur when a patient is perceived by
some (carers, relatives, nursing or therapy staff) to have become unsafe
to remain at home. This should prompt multidisciplinary assessment and
discussion, including whether a move to institutional care would involve a
change of risk patterns rather than a reduction in overall risk.

DEMENTIA: PREVENTION

Dementia: prevention
Lifestyle interventions
• Physical activity. Conﬂicting data. Physical activity may well not protect
against dementia, but should be encouraged for other reasons
• Cognitive activity. Observational studies suggest that games, reading, etc.
are protective, but these associations may not be causal, and there are
no good randomized controlled studies (RCTs)
• Diet. Again, observational studies suggest beneﬁts from a high ﬁsh oil
diet, but there is no high-quality prospective evidence

Drugs
• Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Conﬂicting data from
epidemiological and prospective studies. In one large prospective study,
HRT doubled dementia risk. Cannot be recommended for prevention
• NSAIDs. Large prospective cohort studies suggest that long-term
NSAID use is protective, especially when used several years before
dementia onset. RCTs are ongoing. NSAIDs may function by reducing
amyloid formation, and this may be speciﬁc to only some NSAIDs
(eg ibuprofen). Side effects are considerable for long-term users
• Antioxidants. High dietary intake of antioxidants (eg vitamins C and E)
is associated with lower risk of dementia, but methodological
concerns exist (eg does subclinical cognitive impairment reduce
recall during questionnaire surveys of diet). Extrapolating from in vitro
studies, and some early positive studies in coronary heart disease
(now largely refuted), some recommend high dose (>400IU/day)
vitamin E supplements
• Antihypertensives. Conﬂicting data. Dementia prevention is not in itself
a reason to lower blood pressure
• Statins. Associated with a lower frequency of dementia, but this may be
spurious, due to prescribing bias (eg physicians less likely to prescribe
to those with subclinical cognitive impairment)
Overall, there are few high-quality RCTs of primary prevention in
dementia, but many epidemiological studies. Usual practice is to encourage
physical and mental activity (‘use it or lose it’), to optimize blood pressure and to encourage low-dose aspirin in those with or at high risk of
cerebrovascular disease. Some physicians are treating patients at high
risk of Alzheimer’s disease with NSAIDs and antioxidants, but this is not
generally advised because there are several examples where promising
epidemiological evidence was followed by evidence of harm when RCTs
ﬁnally reported (eg B-carotene, HRT). In vascular dementia, there is little
evidence for atheroma reduction, but it is usual practice to modify general
vascular risk factors (see b ‘Vascular secondary prevention’, p.308), and
those with clear clinical or radiological evidence of TIA or stroke should
have the usual measures.

223

224

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: acetylcholinesterase
inhibitors
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, released in 1997, were the ﬁrst drug class
proven to improve cognition in some patients with dementia. They work
by blocking acetylcholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine, an
important neurotransmitter for memory.

Effectiveness
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are far from miracle drugs, with very variable response. In general:
• They offer symptomatic beneﬁt through a one-off increment in
cognition. The underlying disease continues to progress at the same
rate and patients stopping the drug revert to where they would have
been without treatment
• Of the dementias, Alzheimer’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies
and Parkinson’s disease with dementia have the greatest cholinergic
deﬁcit, and these are the dementia types known to beneﬁt most from
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment
• About half of patients show no beneﬁt, a signiﬁcant minority show
moderate improvements (‘clock turned back a few months’) and for a
small minority there is substantial improvement
• In some, there is a worsening in cognition, or onset of agitation that
may be temporary or respond to a change in drug
• Early studies focused on effects on cognitive function, and these
are overall modest. However, small improvements in cognition can
translate into signiﬁcantly improved day-to-day function, reducing carer
burden (by 730min daily in moderate dementia)
• Some evidence that acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can reduce the
requirements for home care, and can delay placement in nursing home
• Beneﬁt has been demonstrated for mild to moderate dementia, not in
severe dementia. Recent NICE guidelines (March 2011) supports their
use in both mild and moderate disease

Choosing a drug
The three acetylcholinesterase inhibitors currently available are:
• Donepezil 5mg od increased to 10mg od after 4/52
• Galantamine 4mg bd increased to 8mg bd after 4/52, 12mg bd after 8/52
• Rivastigmine 1.5mg bd increased to max 6mg bd within 12/52
Selecting an agent is difﬁcult, as there are few head-to-head comparisons.
Effectiveness seems broadly similar, and choice can be made based on
costs, and the team’s experience. There is most evidence for donepezil
in Alzheimer’s disease and it has fewer adverse events than rivastigmine
which is probably better for Lewy body dementia. Donepezil will be offpatent in the UK soon which will make its use more widespread. Overall,
the evidence for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is strongest in Alzheimer’s
and Lewy body dementia, and weakest in vascular dementia.

disease (2011) online: M http://guidance.nice.org.uk/TA217.

DEMENTIA: ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE INHIBITORS

HOW TO . . . Treat with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
Introducing and monitoring acetylcholinesterase inhibitors is a specialist
area, usually undertaken by psychogeriatric teams, or by geriatricians
or neurologists working in the setting of a memory clinic.
In general, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors should not be initiated in
inpatient medical or rehabilitation settings, as the effects of environmental changes, physical illness or drugs may dominate those of the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, rendering assessment of effect impossible.
It is preferable to initiate treatment when the patient is physically well
and living in their own home.
Where given for behavioural disturbance or non-cognitive symptoms
(eg hallucinations), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors may be initiated more
urgently in an institutional setting.
Before treatment
• Consider the relative risks and beneﬁts and discuss them with patient
and carer
• Explain that the drugs do not provide a cure, and may reasonably be
deferred until symptoms worsen
• Consider how concordance can be assured
• Check for relative contraindications, eg bradycardia or heart block
Treatment trial
• There are signiﬁcant side effects, commonly gastrointestinal (nausea,
dyspepsia, diarrhoea, anorexia). These occur especially during the
dose titration phase at higher doses, are often short lived
• An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor should be given for an initial
treatment period of 2–3 months. If there is no effect at maximum
tolerated dose, the drug should be discontinued. There is probably
little beneﬁt from trying other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors if one
has failed
Assess impact using
• Clinician’s subjective global assessment, based on the views of
relative(s) or carer(s) and serial clinical observations
• The results of cognitive tests, eg MMSE, clock-drawing test
Continuing therapy
• If beneﬁt appears to have occurred, the drug should be continued at
that dose. Beneﬁt may be absolute, or relative: a small decline would
be expected during the 2–3-month evaluation period, so an absence
of deterioration may be attributed to drug beneﬁt
• Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can be given indeﬁnitely, but can be
withdrawn periodically (18 months) to determine whether beneﬁt
continues. If the patient deteriorates promptly after drug withdrawal
(within weeks, thus probably secondary to drug withdrawal
rather than disease progression), acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
are restarted. The evidence for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in
advanced dementia is weak, and they are generally withdrawn at this
point
• As more patients are given an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor at an
earlier stage of disease, monitoring may fall more to primary care

225

226

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: other drug treatments
Memantine
• This is a blocker of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors that may
reduce glutamate-mediated destruction of cholinergic neurons
• It appears to have a beneﬁcial effect in severe dementia of Alzheimer’s
or vascular aetiology and may be used in those with behavioural
disturbance
• Recommended by NICE for moderate Alzheimer’s where the patient
cannot tolerate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and in severe disease
• It is well tolerated. Uncommon side effects include hallucinations and
worsening confusion
• Avoid in severe renal failure
• Memantine enhances the effect of levodopa and dopamine agonists

Other drugs to prevent progression
No drugs have been proven to slow or halt progression, although
dementia is seen as so catastrophic, the following are often used:
• Vascular secondary prevention: eg aspirin, lipid-lowering drugs, ACEinhibitors and other antihypertensives. For patients with vascular
dementia and mixed (Alzheimer’s–vascular) dementia, aggressive risk
factor modiﬁcation and tailored drug treatment akin to that following
stroke is logical but is without evidence. There is better evidence for
primary prevention, eg in those with hypertension
• Vitamin E. High doses (eg 400–800IU bd) are widely used by patients,
and have been supported by some doctors, but recent evidence is
much less convincing than earlier studies of an effect in either primary
prevention or on slowing of progression. In conjunction with recent
evidence suggesting no beneﬁt in cardiovascular disease, high-dose
vitamin E supplementation cannot be recommended
• Ginkgo biloba. A supplement widely used by people with memory
impairment or dementia to enhance memory and other cognitive
functions, but not convincingly supported by trial evidence.
Preparations are expensive, vary in strength, and have antiplatelet
activity—caution with anticoagulants

DEMENTIA: OTHER DRUG TREATMENTS

HOW TO . . . Manage patients with dementia in hospital
2Beware iatrogenic deterioration. Modest behavioural deterioration in a
patient with moderate dementia at home may lead to hospital admission,
with a loss of all familiar routine, physical environment, and caregivers.
Thus further behavioural decline, administration of sedatives, and further
worsened confusion.
Over a quarter of UK hospital beds house patients with dementia.
Patients with dementia stay in hospital longer than patients with similar
problems but without cognitive impairment and often leave hospital in a
worse physical and mental state than when they arrived.
• Where appropriate, manage the patient at home, with a brief but
thorough outpatient attendance if there is concern about physical
precipitants. Community outreach may be available to help avoid
unnecessary admissions
• If hospital admission is required then if possible admit them directly
to a ward with experience managing patients with cognitive
impairment
• Try to minimize disorientation by:
• Avoiding admission and ward moves at night
• Avoiding multiple changes of location/ward
• Quiet room with window (so daylight seen)
• Minimal distractions (eg turn off background radio/TV)
• Visible clocks and calendars
• Well labelled facilities, eg toilets—images often better
• Regular ward routine
• Restricting family visiting unnecessarily
• Actively ascertain and treat symptoms such as pain or shortness of
breath which patients may not spontaneously describe
• Good nursing management of hydration, nutrition, continence
(avoid constipation), pressure areas, falls prevention
• Where psychoactive medication is required use it sparingly for short
courses. Remember that sedation is a side effect and NOT the
desired outcome (which is behaviour modiﬁcation)
• Take time to communicate with the patient and their relatives
• Minimize the length of admission with proactive early discharge
planning

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Dementia: managing behavioural
problems
Behavioural problems include agitation, anxiety, phobias, irritability, wandering, hoarding, aggression, socially inappropriate behaviour (eg sexual
disinhibition, inappropriate urination, attention-seeking), hallucinations,
and delusions.
These are common in dementia, including Alzheimer’s, and may occur
early in the disease. Often it is behavioural problems rather than cognitive
impairment that lead to institutionalization; managing them successfully
may enable a patient to remain in their own home.

General
• Consider whether acute illness (eg sepsis), pain (eg urinary retention),
or changes in drug treatment (eg anticholinergics) have contributed,
especially if behaviour has deteriorated rapidly
• Consider whether agitation or aggression is a manifestation of
depression (consider an SSRI) or of fear (which may respond if care is
given in a non-challenging way by a familiar team)
• Medication may not be needed if symptoms are transient, do not cause
the patient signiﬁcant distress, and are not threatening care of the
patient in the current environment

Non-drug management
These are preferred, and may alone be sufﬁcient
• Avoid precipitants
• Effective therapies include music, bathing, exercise, pets, art therapy,
aromatherapy, etc.
• The environment should be home-like, familiar and interesting
• Activities may reduce boredom, wandering, and aggression
• Delusions and hallucinations may be helped by distraction and
reassurance
• Anxiety may respond to relaxation, or a discussion of worries
• The psychogeriatric team will be able to offer helpful advice

Drug treatment
The best drug is that which, for that patient with that problem, has worked
well previously.
For agitation, anxiety, and irritability:
• Benzodiazepines, eg lorazepam, are often successful but long-term
treatment should be avoided due to side effects and dependence
• If depression is prominent, try an SSRI such as citalopram
• If this fails, or side effects (usually oversedation) occur, introduce an
atypical antipsychotic such as quetiapine, but be aware that atypical
antipsychotics eg quetiapine should be avoided—if considered
necessary use lowest dose for shortest period possible. Risperidone
and olanzapine are now rarely recommended because of the increased
risk of stroke, IHD, and death
• Haloperidol and phenothiazines are slow acting and have many side
effects so should be avoided in the absence of psychotic symptoms
• Memantine can be used with good effect in extreme agitation

DEMENTIA: MANAGING BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMS

For problematic psychotic symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, paranoia):
• Cholinesterase inhibitors may improve behaviour as well as cognition.
They have few side effects, and may be given ‘ﬁrst-line’, especially if
symptoms are moderate and not acute in onset
• Atypical antipsychotics, eg quetiapine should be used at the lowest
dose that is effective
• Trazodone, an antidepressant, may be useful especially where sleep
disturbance is a problem and aggression is only verbal
• In dementia with Lewy bodies, use antipsychotics with great caution,
in low dose, under close supervision, and only when other nonpharmacological and pharmacological measures have been exhausted.
Atypical antipsychotics are preferred
Review drug use regularly, being aware of potential side effects such as falls,
immobility, or confusion. Behavioural problems are often periodic, so consider trials off treatment, especially in those whose behavioural disturbance
was not severe and has responded to treatment.

229

230

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Compulsory detention and treatment
Older people in need of medical assessment, treatment, or continuing
care commonly lack the capacity to judge the risk and beneﬁt of interventions. They may therefore refuse care when its beneﬁt is clear to others.
In the UK, there are several legal procedures which may support a
doctor in the compulsory treatment, admission, or detention of patients.

Mental Capacity Act (2005)
The most commonly used legal support for actions when the patient lacks
capacity to make a certain decision (see b ‘The Mental Capacity Act
2005’, p.656). Actions may include:
• Admission to hospital
• Treatment and detention on a ward or within a hospital
• Treatment in the home (eg in delirium secondary to infection, but
refusing antibiotics)
• Detention in the home (eg wandering presents danger to the patient)
Actions should be:
• Justiﬁable, reasonable, and proportionate to the situation. Based on
a consideration of the risks/beneﬁts for that patient, and their likely
wishes were they competent. Consider alternatives and always opt for
the least restrictive (see b ‘Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards’, p.657)
• Carefully documented and reviewed regularly

Section 5 (2) of the Mental Health Act (1983)
• This permits the detention of an inpatient in a general or psychiatric
hospital for up to 72hr after submission of a report, while their mental
health needs are assessed. Outpatients or DH patients do not fall
within this section
• It should be considered if a patient is highly resistive to treatment or
restraint, formalizing actions taken under common law
• It is sensible to seek the advice of a psychogeriatrician to conﬁrm that
it is appropriate, and during the 72-hr period to perform assessment
and help guide further management
• Detention is authorized when the registered medical practitioner
in charge of treatment or a fully registered deputy (ie consultant or
fully registered junior doctor; not pre-registration junior) completes a
report (‘Form 12’) and submits it to the duty hospital manager

Section 2 of the Mental Health Act (1983)
• This permits the admission to hospital and detention of a patient for
assessment and treatment
• The patient must have a mental disorder that warrants detention in the
interests of the patient or for the protection of others
• Application is made by a relative or approved social worker, and
supported by two registered medical practitioners
• The assessment period is up to 28 days and is not renewable

Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards
• This code of practice was published in 2007 and provides
supplementary guidance to the Mental Capacity Act (2005). It lays
down a framework for when and how Deprivation of Liberty (DoL)
may be authorized. (See b ‘Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards’, p.657)

COMPULSORY DETENTION AND TREATMENT

• The impetus for these guidelines arose out of a well-publicized case
dating back to 1997 in which an autistic patient who was incompetent
was detained informally in Bournewood Hospital for assessment. The
‘Bournewood Gap’ was identiﬁed as a gap in the law by the European
Court of Human Rights. Incompetent patients who were sectioned
were subject to stringent rules (Mental Health Act) while ‘informal
patients’ held under the common law of necessity did not have similar
protective mechanisms and regulations and potentially could be held
for indeﬁnite amounts of time
• DoLS are applicable in hospitals and care homes. There are detailed
requirements about assessment, authorizing detention, renewing, and
challenging decisions
• The underlying principle is that a patient should be detained in the least
restrictive manner that is practical
• Despite the huge number of patients who potentially come under
these legal safeguards in acute geriatric medicine wards most remain
under simple common law. DoLS teams provide assessment, and
support decision making and documentation when the deprivation is
particularly stringent, longstanding, or is challenged by family or friends

HOW TO . . . Manage the older person refusing
treatment
In practice, compulsion is possible only in hospital. Brief interventions
against a patient’s will are sometimes possible at home (eg restraint to
prevent dangerous wandering; forced administration of antibiotics in a
sepsis with delirium), but can rarely be sustained because of resource
restraints and staff feeling legally and physically vulnerable.
Use guidance from the Mental Capacity Act to admit to acute
medical ward in cases of:
• Dementia with acute physical illness
• Delirium with moderate behavioural disturbance
Use the Mental Health Act to admit to psychiatric wards in cases of:
• Dementia, with risk to self, eg dangerous wandering, but alternatives
must be explored and considered
• Delirium with severe behavioural disturbance (to psychiatric or
medical or geriatric ward)
• Psychotic state, severe with risk to self or others, eg severe
depression with psychosis or risk of self-harm
Compulsory admission is not justiﬁed and/or not legal in cases of:
• Physical illness, refusing treatment without psychiatric illness
• Psychotic state or other psychiatric illness of moderate severity,
without signiﬁcant risk to self or others
These are guidelines. If in any doubt, seek emergency advice from the
local psychogeriatric team.

231

232

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Psychosis
Psychotic symptoms, eg delusions and hallucinations, are common in
older people, particularly in those who are acutely unwell, hospitalized,
or in care homes. Symptoms range from benign and non-distressing to
those that cause anxiety among patients, caregivers, and often indicate
important, treatable disease.

What is psychosis?
A state of severe impairment of assessment of reality. The results include
• Distortions of perception eg illusions (misperceptions: distortions of
actual perceptions) and hallucinations (perceptions not the result of
external stimulus)
• Distortions of thought content ie delusions—beliefs held with great
conviction despite contrary evidence. These are usually secondary, ie a
response to abnormal occurrences such as hallucinations or low mood

Causes of psychotic symptoms in older people
The most common causes are ‘organic’. In order of frequency:
• Dementia
• Depression
• Delirium
• Drugs, eg levodopa
• Other neurological causes, eg cerebrovascular disease, brain tumour
Less common causes are ‘functional’ or ‘non-organic’, eg:
• Persistence into late life of chronic schizophrenia
• Delusional disorder of later life (‘late paraphrenia’)
• Psychotic presentation of affective disorder (mania or depression)

Treatment of patients with psychotic symptoms
• Can usually be managed on the general medical wards, or at home, but
early specialist psychogeriatric team support is advised
• Avoid reinforcing a patient’s paranoid beliefs: don’t avoid contact, don’t
seek rapid transfer from the ward, etc.
• Make a diagnosis and treat the underlying cause, eg stop drugs leading
to delirium
• Attend to hearing and visual impairments
• Treat underlying mood disorder
• In dementia, especially Alzheimer’s and dementia with Lewy bodies,
consider acetylcholinesterase inhibitors
• If symptoms are distressing and persistent, consider the use of
antipsychotics eg haloperidol, risperidone, olanzapine; usually after
specialist advice. Be cautious in patients who may have dementia with
Lewy bodies
• On discharge, offer opportunities for social interaction and practical
home support

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Delirium: diagnosis
Delirium is a syndrome of disturbance of consciousness accompanied by
change in cognition not accounted for by pre-existing dementia. The term
delirium (acute confusional state) refers to an acute brain syndrome, effectively acute brain failure, characterized by impairment of consciousness
(however slight).
Beware sloppy language—the term confusion means only that: muddled
thinking, or an inability to think clearly. It is an important symptom of acute
‘organic’ brain disorders such as delirium but is not conﬁned to them,
ie low speciﬁcity. It may also be seen in depression, dementia, and less
commonly in some primary psychotic disorders. Use the term confusion
when describing a presentation, but never as a diagnosis.

Key features
• A disturbance of consciousness (decreased clarity of awareness of the
environment). May be hypoactive, hyperactive or mixed (see Box 9.1).
Decreased ability to focus, shift or sustain attention. Distractability.
Lose thread of conversation. Leads to uncertainty about time of day.
Impairment is often not obvious, especially if onset gradual; but, after
recovery, memory for the period will be poor. This feature is not seen
in early dementia, or in primary psychotic disorders
• Change in cognition. Often widespread, eg memory impairment
(often recent memory), disorientation (time, place; person less
common), language disturbance (eg dysgraphia, dysnomia), perceptual
impairment (misinterpretations, eg slamming door = gunshot), illusions
(usually visual, eg bedclothes animated), hallucinations. Thinking may be
slow and muddled, but is often rich in content
• Acute onset, and ﬂuctuates. Usual onset over hours or a few days.
Sometimes changes are subacute (weeks to a few months) and
may be misdiagnosed as dementia. Severity varies during the day,
eg ‘sundowning’ is a syndrome of worsening confusion in the later
part of the day or at night

Other features (not essential to make the diagnosis)
These include:
• Disturbance of the sleep-wake cycle. May be complete reversal
• Disturbed psychomotor behaviour. May be ‘up’ (restless, picking,
wandering) or ‘down’ (slow, immobile)
• Emotional disturbance, eg fear, depression, anger, euphoria, lability.
Fear and aggression may be a consequence of threatening hallucinations
or delusions. The patient may call out, scream, or moan continually. In
an institutional setting this may be problematic, especially at night. At a
lesser level, the patient may appear simply perplexed and bewildered
• Delusions (often persecutory) are common, but usually transient and
poorly elaborated
• Poor insight is typical

DELIRIUM: DIAGNOSIS

Box 9.1 Pitfalls in diagnosis
Making the diagnosis can be difﬁcult but early identiﬁcation is vital as
early treatment will improve prognosis. Delirium is a varied syndrome.
As well as ﬂuctuating day-to-day or hour-to-hour, it is variable in nature,
manifesting distinctly in different patients, or in the same patient at different times. For example, two patterns (ends of a spectrum) have been
described:
• Hyperactive or ‘Up’: oversensitive to stimuli, psychomotor agitation,
repeatedly getting out of bed, noisy, psychotic symptoms, aggression
• Hypoactive or ‘Down’: psychomotor retardation, lethargy, quiet,
paucity of speech, few psychotic symptoms. This variety is more
commonly not recognized and has a worse prognosis
• A mixed picture can also occur
Delirium may be misdiagnosed when it is not present (eg in deaf, or
blind or dysphasic patients). More commonly, the diagnosis is not made
when it is present. Therefore screening tests (typically the AMTS and b
Appendix, ‘CAM’, p.692) are valuable, and should be performed in all
cases when delirium is possible—certainly at the time of admission, and
during admission if changes in clinical condition occur.
Usually there is evidence of the medical condition that has led to
delirium. Although this is not necessary to make the diagnosis, it is
necessary to treat it effectively.
Ensure you document your assessment and diagnosis well.

235

236

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Delirium: causes
A particular case is often multifactorial, ie several factors (individually modest and alone insufﬁcient) combine to push a patient across a
threshold to frank delirium. Chronic factors (eg overt or incipient
dementia) may maintain a person closer to that threshold, and impaired
homeostasis of older age increases the systemic—and cerebral—effects
of illness.
Delirium is therefore especially likely to occur in very elderly people, in
the physically frail, or if there is pre-existing dementia, defective hearing
or vision, or brain damage of any kind, eg idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. In
these cases more minor acute illnesses may cause delirium.

Factors that may contribute to delirium
2Usually, there is evidence from either the history or examination or
simple tests, of the factor(s) that have contributed to delirium.
These factors include:
• Infection. Viral or bacterial. Not necessarily severe, especially in those
with MCI, dementia, or other contributory factors. Common sources
are chest, urine, skin (cellulitis). Remember other infections, eg CNS,
endocarditis, biliary infection, diverticulitis, pancreatitis, abdominal
perforation, and abdominal or pelvic collection
• Drug intoxication. Especially anticholinergics, anxiolytics/hypnotics,
anticonvulsants, opiates (see Box 9.2)
• Disorders of electrolyte/ﬂuid balance, eg dehydration, uraemia, hypo-/
hypernatraemia, hypercalcaemia. Modest degrees of hyponatraemia
(>130mM) are unlikely to be the sole cause of delirium
• Alcohol or drug withdrawal
• Organ failure, eg cardiac, respiratory, liver
• Endocrine. High or low blood sugar, hypo- or hyperthyroid
• Epileptic. Post-ictal state following unrecognized seizures. Consider if
there has been an unwitnessed ‘collapse’, with amnesia, and any ictal
features (incontinence, tongue biting). If conscious level is low consider
ongoing ictal activity or even non-convulsive status
• Intracranial pathology, eg, head injury, space-occupying lesion, increased
intracranial pressure of whatever cause, infection, pre-existing cognitive
impairment or acute/chronic cerebrovascular disease. However, acute
stroke is rarely the sole cause of delirium
• Pain
These factors may be accentuated on admission to hospital by environmental
disorientation, a lack of information, sensory over- or under-stimulation,
impersonal setting, changes in staff or wards, poorly understood investigations and treatments, and being away from a familiar home and family/carers.

DELIRIUM: CAUSES

Box 9.2 Drugs causing delirium
Drug-induced delirium is common. Incidence of delirium is closely associated with anticholinergic activity. Therefore tricyclic antidepressants and
neuroleptics constitute high-risk groups. Many more are less frequently
associated with delirious reactions.
• Anticholinergics (used for either cardiac or gastrointestinal effects,
eg atropine, hyoscine, propantheline)
• Antipsychotic drugs (‘neuroleptics’), eg chlorpromazine, triﬂuoperazine,
thioridazine
• Antihistamines, eg chlorphenamine, diphenhydramine
• Hypnotics/anxiolytics, eg barbiturates, benzodiazepines, ‘Z-drugs’
(zolpidem etc.)
• Antidepressant drugs. Especially tricyclics
• Anticonvulsant drugs, eg phenytoin, carbamazepine
• Opiates and opiate-like drugs, including codeine, dihydrocodeine, and
tramadol
• Corticosteroids including prednisolone
• Lithium
• H2 receptor blockers, eg cimetidine (rarely)
• L-dopa (co-beneldopa, co-careldopa), dopamine agonists. Caution in
treating parkinsonism in patients with Lewy body dementia
• Digoxin
‘Recreational’ drugs that may cause delirium include alcohol, marijuana,
LSD, amphetamines, cocaine, opiates, and inhalants.
A drug may be the ‘ﬁnal straw’ that leads to overt delirium. For
example a dry, septic patient who has tolerated co-codamol when well,
may become delirious when it is again administered in hospital.

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Delirium: clinical assessment
History and examination
• Most factors leading to a presentation with delirium can be identiﬁed
by taking a history and examining the patient. Even confused, forgetful
patients report ongoing symptoms (eg pain, dysuria) if asked
• Always obtain a collateral history, paying careful regard to recent
minor/major symptoms (eg cough), as well as drug history, and an
exploration of the nature and duration of memory/cognitive symptoms
• Always assess cognition objectively—eg using the AMTS, MMSE or
clock-drawing test. This may yield surprising results (better or worse
than expected), and permits tracking of progress
• If a patient is non-compliant with examination, use distraction
(eg chatting whilst examining) or complete the examination in
sections. Sedation will only rarely be necessary
• Focus the examination on important areas—is there evidence of
infection (examine all lung areas, abdomen), or of new focal neurology?
Is the patient dehydrated or overloaded?
• Repeat vital signs regularly, especially temperature
• Check arterial oxygen saturation off oxygen—even modest
hypoxaemia (sats d95%) may indicate important cardiopulmonary
pathology

Investigation
• One contributing factor may be obvious (eg UTI), but do not assume
that this is the sole—or even the most important—factor, until others
have been excluded
• All patients should have some baseline tests (see Box 9.3). These
will vary according to the clinical picture, the availability of tests, and
whether a clear cause is already apparent
• If the cause remains unclear despite a careful history, examination, and
‘simple’ tests, then repeat clinical assessment, consider less common
causes, and consider more advanced tests such as CT/MRI brain, EEG,
or CSF examination

DELIRIUM: CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Box 9.3 Baseline investigations in delirium
• FBC, ESR. Evidence of infection, anaemia (unlikely on its own to cause
delirium)
• U,C+E. Hypo-/hypernatraemia, dehydration, renal impairment
• Glucose. Hypo-/hyperglycaemia. The sugar may now be normal—but
what was it an hour/day ago?
• LFTs and amylase
• TFTs. Hypo- or- hyperthyroidism are common and treatable. Both
may contribute to a presentation of delirium
• CRP. A very useful test, but may be normal early in the course of
infection
• Calcium and phosphate
• CXR. Clinical examination is relatively insensitive to early/localized
pathology, eg infection
• ECG. Silent ischaemia/infarction common in older people. Consider
troponin
• Urinalysis ± urine microscopy and culture. Asymptomatic bacteriuria
is common; a positive dipstick may not therefore explain a patient’s
delirium. Look for additional causes
• Blood culture. Always send before starting antibiotics. Occult
bacteraemia is common
• Blood gases. Hypoxaemia or hypercapnia may contribute to delirium

239

240

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Delirium: treatment issues
2Initiate treatment early: delirium is a medical emergency.

Where to treat?
In many cases the patient should be admitted to an acute general hospital where there are advanced diagnostic facilities (including CT) and staff
trained to manage acute illness. Outside an acute hospital—in a domestic
setting, care home, community or psychiatric hospital—the medical team
must in each case balance the beneﬁts of advanced diagnostics, treatment
and monitoring with the possible detrimental effect of transfer. There is
little place for a ‘treat at home and hope’ approach, unless:
• The dominant cause is clear
• Effective treatment can be given
• Appropriate care and supervision can be assured
• The risks of transfer are considered to outweigh the beneﬁts
Keep the admission brief. With appropriate support and monitoring,
discharge home or transfer to a less acute environment can often be
achieved early.

The underlying cause
2Making the diagnosis of delirium is half the job. The second part is eliciting and treating the cause(s).
• However, don’t treat totally blindly, eg there is little place for blind,
broad-spectrum antibiotics with the associated risk of Clostridium
colitis, unless the patient is very ill and sepsis appears likely
• Always check the drug chart. Consider each drug in turn: at this
time, does risk equal or exceed beneﬁt? If so, stop the drug, at least
temporarily
• Ensure adequate ﬂuid and nutrition. The patient may not be dry or
malnourished on admission (though they commonly are), but may soon
become so
• If alcohol dependency or severe malnutrition is known or suspected,
high-dose parenteral vitamin B supplements may be needed
• Occasionally, the cause of delirium is not apparent. In such cases:
• Initiate general supportive measures (ﬂuid, pressure care,
nutrition, etc.)
• Continually re-examine and consider more advanced tests

Competency
Patients with delirium are not usually competent to direct treatment. The law
allows assessment and treatment in their best interests. This may include:
• Holding within a ward or hospital if a patient attempts to leave
• Temporary physical restraint (eg while drugs are administered)
• Covert administration of essential drugs
Clear explanations should be given to staff and family of the need for such
interventions, and their ethical and legal justiﬁcation. Document clearly in
the medical notes why the team considers that such measures are necessary. Reassess competence continually. Once the acute illness is over a
‘Deprivation of liberty assessment’ may be needed (see b ‘Deprivation of
Liberty Safeguards’, p.657).

DELIRIUM: NON-DRUG MANAGEMENT

Delirium: non-drug management
Delirious patients feel ill, frightened, bemused, and disorientated. There
are problems with attention, memory, and perception. Therefore do what
you can to make life easier for the patient:
• Provide a quiet environment free from worrying sounds; appropriate
clothes; quality lighting, at an appropriate level for the time of day; a
clock or outside view to aid orientation
• Optimize visual and auditory acuity by providing spectacles and hearing
aids that work
• Reassure the patient repeatedly and calmly
• Explain who you are, what you wish to do and conﬁrm understanding
• Patients will sense a doctor’s manner, particularly aggression or
frustration. At all times appear relaxed, unhurried and pleasant
• Use non-verbal communication: sit down, smile and appear friendly
rather than professional
• Don’t argue, or correct delusions—the product will be aggravation and
lesser compliance
• Educate visitors who are heightening emotion—ask them to modify
their behaviour or even asked them to leave
• Explain to relatives, and enlist their help, in supervising, feeding, and
bringing in items familiar to the patient

Physical restraint
Restraint is terrifying and has adverse mental and physical sequelae. It is
only rarely needed, but is sometimes (inappropriately) used as a substitute
for supervision and guidance by an experienced carer/nurse.
In cases of severe aggression, where parenteral drugs are required, brief
immobilization of the patient using the minimum force necessary may on
balance be in the patient’s best interests.

Recovery phase
2Patterns of recovery from delirium vary. Most patients recover completely in a few days, some take much longer, but some never return to
baseline cognitive and/or physical function. Delirium can ‘unmask’ a previously unrecognized dementia. In those whose functional status declines
signiﬁcantly, remember that full recovery may take weeks or months—
beware making irreversible decisions (eg home versus residential care)—
before the ﬁnal functional level is known.
Once a patient is admitted, multiple barriers to discharge often appear:
• Carers and family will fear that recent deterioration will persist, and
may resist discharge
• Care packages may be cancelled, taking weeks to restart
• Therapists may assess function as suboptimal in the unfamiliar hospital
environment, judging that discharge is unsafe
Therefore once the acute event has been diagnosed and treatment begun,
encourage the team to begin promptly to plan for home. Delay in discharge
leads to increased prescription of psychotropic drugs, institutionalization
and care home placement.

241

242

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Delirium: drug treatments
Drugs are needed only when the agitation that accompanies delirium is:
• Causing signiﬁcant patient distress
• Threatening the safety of the patient or others
• Interfering with medical treatment (eg pulling out of iv lines, aggression
preventing clinical examination)
Having decided that drug treatment is in the patient’s interests, remember
that:
• Drugs should complement, not replace, non-drug approaches
• The correct dose is the minimum effective dose
• The response (adverse and beneﬁcial) and prescription must be
reviewed regularly
• It is preferable to use only one drug, starting at low dose, and
increasing the dose incrementally at intervals of 30–60min
• Delirium can resolve quickly so avoid regular prescription—each dose
should be as needed (prn).
The relative merits of differing drug classes and drugs are debated, but a
reasonable consensus is presented in b ‘HOW TO . . . Prescribe sedating
drugs in delirium’, p.243.
In cases where behaviour remains problematic, seek urgent advice from
the local psychogeriatric team.

DELIRIUM: DRUG TREATMENTS

HOW TO . . . Prescribe sedating drugs in delirium
Short-acting benzodiazepines (eg lorazepam)
• Have recently replaced antipsychotics as ﬁrst-line treatments. Useful
if sleep disturbance is prominent, or for severe distress or agitation
• Short-acting benzodiazepines are preferred, eg lorazepam orally (po),
im, or sublingual repeated as necessary/tolerated
• Dependence and tolerance is possible, so review regularly and
discontinue as soon as possible. Avoid inclusion on ‘to take out’
(TTOs) if possible
• Long-acting benzodiazepines are especially useful for the treatment
of delirium caused by alcohol or benzodiazepine withdrawal. Use
chlordiazepoxide, in reducing dose
• In extreme cases only (eg severe distress/agitation, with imminent
danger to self/others), consider giving a small intravenous dose of
a short-acting benzodiazepine (eg midazolam), carefully titrated to
response. Monitor closely both clinically and with oximetry—the
major risk is respiratory depression
Typical antipsychotics (eg haloperidol)
• Compared with low-potency antipsychotics, there are fewer side
effects (eg sedation, hypotension, anticholinergic)
• Begin with a small dose, eg 0.5mg orally, as tablet or liquid, as
required. Repeat doses after 1–2hr, and increase the dose size as
needed and tolerated. Total daily oral dose is usually 0.5–4mg
• Response is idiosyncratic: some patients are very sensitive to low
dose, others only to very large doses
• In older people the half-life of haloperidol may be as long as 60hr.
Dosing can be cumulative. Failure to titrate the dose correctly may
render the patient semi-conscious for days
• The oral liquid formulation of haloperidol is colourless and
odourless, aiding covert administration (eg in a drink) if required
• In the very agitated consider haloperidol 1–2mg im repeated after
1hr (approximately 2:1 oral to intramuscular dose equivalence)
• The incidence of extrapyramidal side effects is high. Avoid
haloperidol in dementia with Lewy bodies and in all causes of severe
parkinsonism
Atypical antipsychotics (eg olanzapine, risperidone)
• The place of the newer atypical antipsychotic medications remains
unclear, following concerns of increased risk of stroke
• Should be considered when response to other strategies is poor
• Risperidone liquid can be diluted in water, black coffee, or orange juice
• Risperidone 0.5mg has similar potency to haloperidol 1mg
Combination treatment
Benzodiazepines and antipsychotic medications are sometimes combined
in the management of delirium symptoms, generally under specialist advice.
Stopping treatment
Once behaviour has improved, consider stepwise dose reduction, aiming
to stop the drug as soon as possible without prompting relapse.

243

244

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Confusion and alcohol
It is an error to consider alcohol abuse as exclusively a disease of younger
people. Even if the clinician remembers to ask about alcohol they are
often deceived by the patient who is embarrassed. Decreased alcohol
metabolism means that older people should probably be recommended
lower ‘safe’ drinking levels than younger adults. Decreased balance and
cognitive reserve may mean that even very small doses of alcohol can
have detrimental effects
Alcohol withdrawal—occurs when habitual excess alcohol intake
is stopped, eg when a patient is admitted to hospital. Agitation and
confusion can occur along with physical signs such as diarrhoea, fever, and
hypertension. Visual or tactile hallucinations or illusions can occur.
Delirium tremens—severe form of alcohol withdrawal with a high
mortality. There are delusions, tremor, autonomic hyperactivity, and
sometimes ﬁts.
Wernicke’s encephalopathy—triad of confusion, ataxia, and
ophthalmoplegia. May respond to prompt thiamine administration but
many go on to develop Korsakoff’s.
Korsakoff’s syndrome—irreversible brain damage caused by thiamine
deﬁciency, most commonly seen in alcoholism. May follow an episode
of Wernicke’s encephalopathy or develop gradually. Amnesia and
confabulation occurs with lack of insight and apathy. Ataxia and tremor
may also be found.
Alcohol dementia syndrome—a dementia almost indistinguishable from
Alzheimer’s can occur without the typical features of Korsakoff–Wernicke
syndrome.

Managing alcohol withdrawal in hospital
• Make the diagnosis
• If necessary (not routinely—even heavy drinkers get withdrawal
symptoms in about half of cases) use a decreasing dose schedule
of benzodiazepine, eg chlordiazepoxide to control symptoms and
behaviour. Clomethiazole should not be used in older patients.
• Always prescribe B vitamins—either parenterally or orally
(multivitamins plus some thiamine)
• Offer support

SQUALOR SYNDROME

Squalor syndrome
Also referred to as senile self-neglect (inappropriately derogatory) or
Diogenes syndrome.

Clinical features
• Affected people, usually elderly, live in conditions of severe selfneglect, are socially withdrawn, and lack insight into the unusual nature
of their behaviours and effects on others
• Financial problems are rare
• Homes are typically dirty, their upkeep neglected, and are often the
repository for hoarded rubbish. This often causes distress and anxiety
to neighbours, social and health professionals, much more so than
to the patient themselves. Thus they come to the attention of many
agencies, health, social, and public (eg environmental health)
The syndrome is not uncommon. Diagnosis is made when the clinical features listed exist, without major psychiatric illness (dementia, depression)
to explain it. The best guess is that the syndrome is an unusual manifestation of longstanding personality disorder, and that isolated frontal lobe
dysfunction commonly plays a part.

Risk factors
•
•
•
•
•
•

Borderline personality (‘eccentricity’)
Early dementia or depression
Recent bereavement (commonly spouse)
Lack of close family
Social isolation
Sensory impairment (often visual)

Management
• This should include identiﬁcation and treatment of contributing
psychiatric illness and secondary physical illness, eg malnutrition
• Patients often decline ongoing social support. Psychiatric day care
may maintain more mainstream behaviour for a time, but relapse is
common. Institutional care is a long-term solution, if accepted
• Usually such people are competent to decide to maintain their unusual
lifestyle, and to decline offers of support
• Caring for them can be frustrating, but adverse consequences for
the patient are often surprisingly few, and a watching brief is usually
sufﬁcient, with prompt intervention when decompensation occurs

245

246

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Depression: presentation
The most common psychiatric illness in older people. Probably 10–15%
prevalence over 65 years, severe in 3%.
Risk factors for depression include:
• Disability and illness (especially if serious)
• Care home residents
• Bereavement. Reactive depression is more common in older people,
who suffer more bereavement, illness and other life events. The
reaction may be understandable, but there is beneﬁt from treatment
(see b ‘Bereavement’, p.640)
• Social isolation
• Chronic pain
• Sensory impairment (eg hearing or sight)
Comorbidity may mask or precipitate depression and may be:
• Physical (Parkinson’s, stroke, cancer, or post-acute illness)
• Psychiatric (dementia)
Depression is underdiagnosed in older people, for the following reasons:
• Perception that depression carries a social stigma, so not volunteering
symptoms
• Presentation with symptoms suggesting physical rather than psychiatric
disease (eg weight loss rather than sadness)
• Perception that low mood is a normal part of ageing (eg ‘Of course she
is depressed—she is in a nursing home with chronic disability and pain’)
2Have a low threshold for opportunistic screening.

DEPRESSION: PRESENTATION

HOW TO . . . Distinguish dementia from a depressive
pseudodementia
Pseudodementia is a severe depression that presents with poor memory
and concentration and impaired functional capacity, eg for ADLs. Also
known as dementia of depression.
It is usually distinguishable from dementia, because:
• The history is often short and the onset relatively abrupt
• Patients often complain about poor memory and are despairing
• Assessment of cognition often results in ‘don’t know’ responses
• Memories are often accessible with ‘hints’ or cues from the
assessor—they remain ‘stored’
• There is often a past history of depression, or an identiﬁable
precipitant
The prognosis is variable. In some, mood and cognition respond to
antidepressants. However, many go on to develop dementia, usually of
Alzheimer type.
Coexistence of depression and dementia
• Both depression and dementia are relatively common, and may
coexist coincidentally
• Over 20% of people with an early dementia may be depressed,
suggesting a depressive reaction to the onset of dementia—especially
common and understandable if insight is preserved
• This is quite different from pseudodementia (where there is no actual
dementia)
General guidance
• Treat depression whatever the cause—whether a ‘true’
pseudodementia, or a combination of dementia and depression
• Avoid mislabelling a depressed patient as also having dementia—the
management and prognoses are very different
• Always screen for depression when assessing patients with cognitive
disorders, including short-term memory loss alone

247

248

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Depression: clinical features
Sadness
Commonly denied, and not necessary in order to make a diagnosis of
depression. Tearfulness is uncommon, especially in men. Also ask about biological symptoms, anhedonia (inability to enjoy—ask ‘What do you enjoy or
look forward to?’) and depressive thoughts (guilt, worthlessness, low selfesteem, self-blame, suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, and helplessness).

Anorexia and weight loss
Common to both depression and to serious physical illness. In the patient
who presents in this way, without evidence of a physical cause after clinical
examination and basic tests, it is a matter of judgement whether and when
an antidepressant trial should begin, and whether more invasive tests
should be delayed pending the results of that therapeutic trial. (See b
‘HOW TO . . . Manage weight loss in older patients’, p.357).

Sleep disturbance
Typically early morning wakening, but a full sleep history is useful, as early
wakening may be appropriate, eg if sleeping during the day. Some older
people do sleep much less than when younger—the key is whether they
wake refreshed, or wake anxious and fearful, keen to return to sleep but
unable to do so (see b ‘Sleep and insomnia’, p.176).

Disturbance of behaviour
May include attention-seeking, aggression, irritability, cries for help
(eg intentional falls), self-neglect, malnutrition, social withdrawal.

Cognitive impairment
Poor attention and concentration may result in impairments in several
cognitive domains, typically memory. If severe, this may manifest as a
‘depressive pseudodementia’.

Suicidal ideation and self-harm
Should always be taken seriously, as completed suicide is relatively
common in older people, especially those with physical illness. Selfharm (eg drug overdose) may be medically trivial, but psychiatrically very
serious, and should mandate psychiatric referral. Parasuicide—a ‘cry for
help’ or ‘manipulative’ self-harm event—is very rare; most older people
who self-harm are at least moderately depressed.

Physical slowness
Exclude physical causes, including parkinsonism, cerebrovascular disease
and hypothyroidism. May manifest as increased dependence or ‘failure to
cope’. May be severe, with very reduced mobility or total immobility—the
depressed, bedbound, motionless, anorexic patient must be treated as an
emergency.

DEPRESSION: CLINICAL FEATURES

Somatization
This expression of psychological problems as physical symptoms is
common, as is hypochondriasis (disproportionate concern over health).
In the patient presenting with somatization or hypochondriasis, the risks
are of failing to investigate and treat when a true physical illness is present,
or conversely, of failing to appreciate that antidepressant treatment is
actually what is needed.

HOW TO. . . Assess depression
Depression rating scales
For example, GDS (see b Appendix, ‘Glasgow Coma Scale’, p.696),
which is known to be valid in community and hospital settings, and
maintains speciﬁcity in mild to moderate dementia.
Two or three simple questions can be effective screening tools.
Simply asking ‘Do you feel low?’ has reasonable sensitivity and speciﬁcity
for depression.
Psychiatric history and examination
Physical history and examination
Targeting evidence of physical illness contributing to or mimicking
depression, and contraindications to drug treatments.
Cognitive assessment screen
For example, MMSE, clock-drawing test. Is there coexisting cognitive
impairment? If so, does it improve with treatment for depression?, ie
pseudodementia (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Distinguish dementia from a
depressive pseudodementia’, p.247).
Blood tests
• FBC (anaemia leading to lethargy; high mean corpuscular volume
(MCV) in alcohol excess)
• ESR (malignancy, vasculitis)
• B12 and folate (low levels may contribute to depression, or result
from anorexia)
• U,C+E (uraemia, dehydration)
• Calcium (hypercalcaemia leading to depression, fatigue)
• Thyroid function (hypo- and occasionally hyperthyroidism may
present as depression)
• Liver function (malignancy, alcohol excess)

249

250

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Depression: non-drug management
Depression is undertreated as well as underdiagnosed. Treatment should
be started promptly, its intensity (eg drug dose) increased as needed, and
continued until the likelihood of relapse off treatment is low.

Supportive treatment
•
•
•
•

Includes counselling and relief of loneliness
Treat physical symptoms and pain
Address rational anxieties, eg ﬁnancial, housing, physical dependency
Consider stopping contributory drugs (B-blockers, benzodiazepines,
levodopa, opiates, steroids)

Psychotherapy
As effective as antidepressants for mild-to-moderate depression, and may
be preferred by some. May complement drug treatment in resistant cases.
Cognitive behavioural therapy has the most evidence. Is resource intensive
and often limited availability and/or long waiting lists.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
ECT offers a safe, rapid, and reasonably certain response in cases where:
• Rapid response is necessary
• Patients with depression have been intolerant to or have not
responded to drug treatment
• When depression is very severe and manifests as psychosis, severe
physical retardation, depressive stupor, or food/ﬂuid refusal
Relative contraindications include coronary, cerebrovascular, and pulmonary
disease.

Specialist referral
Consider psychogeriatric assessment if:
• Treatment is unsuccessful after 6–8 weeks
• Depression is severe, eg with delusions
• The diagnosis is unclear, eg when depression and signiﬁcant cognitive
impairment coexist
• A patient is refusing treatment or otherwise threatening self-harm
• There are questions of competency
• ECT is being considered

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Depression: drug treatments
Drug treatment is generally effective, well tolerated, and non-addictive,
although patients often believe otherwise.
2There is signiﬁcant stigma associated with taking antidepressants, which
is more prevalent in older age populations, and this may need to be
explored and addressed.

General
• In reactive depression, consider saying ‘This won’t stop you feeling sad,
that’s understandable, but it will help you to cope better with those
feelings’
• Inform the patient that response takes time but is usual
• No antidepressant class has been shown to be more effective, so
choice depends on side effects, speed of onset, response to previous
treatment, drug interactions and associated conditions, eg anxiety
or pain

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors
For example: citalopram or sertraline
• Now generally the ﬁrst class of antidepressant prescribed
• Compared with tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, they are
less sedating, have fewer anticholinergic and cardiotoxic side effects,
fewer drug interactions, and are much safer in overdose
• Symptomatic response commonly starts after 2 weeks but may take up
to 8 weeks
• Common side effects include gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea
and diarrhoea), postural hypotension, anxiety, and restlessness, and
hyponatraemia. Hyponatraemia is usually moderate (Na >125mM) and
asymptomatic, and especially common in combination with diuretics
• Rarely causes serotonin syndrome (see b ‘Neuroleptic malignant
syndrome’, p.169)
• Start at low doses to minimize side effects, and build up as needed to
give a useful response
• If there is no response to an adequate dose of one SSRI, there is little
point trying another. Instead, switch class

Tricyclic antidepressants
For example: amitriptyline, nortriptyline
• Much less prescribed than previously
• They still have a role, for example:
• If anticholinergic effects are desirable (urge incontinence)
• When there is neuropathic or other pain that may respond to its
coanalgesic effect
• In depression resistant to other drugs
• The secondary amines (eg nortriptyline) are preferred, causing
less orthostatic hypotension than tertiary amines (eg amitriptyline,
imipramine). Anticholinergic side effects are less troublesome if doses
start low and are increased weekly

DEPRESSION: DRUG TREATMENTS

Serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)
For example: venlafaxine.
• For severe depression, or when poor response to SSRIs after 6 weeks
• Also useful for anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder
• May cause less orthostatic hypotension than the SSRIs, but other side
effects similar

Serotonin antagonist
For example: mirtazapine
• An atypical antidepressant which tends to cause weight gain (so may be
particularly useful in malnourished)
• It has fewer anticholinergic side effects, but is more sedating than
tricyclics (so consider when a degree of sedation is desirable)
• Also less commonly complicated by hyponatraemia than SSRIs

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors
For example: moclobemide
• Occasionally used, under expert guidance, but dietary and drug
interactions are problematic
• Treatment should be continued for up to a year. If depression has been
severe and/or recurrent, consider continuing indeﬁnitely

Stopping drugs
Withdrawal reactions (anxiety, mania, delirium, insomnia, gastrointestinal
side effects, headache, giddiness) may occur if drugs are stopped abruptly
after 8 weeks or more. Therefore reduce dose gradually, over 4 weeks. In
those on long-term treatment, reduce over several months.

Switching drugs
‘Cross-tapering’ is generally advised, ie the incremental reduction of the ‘old’
drug, and incremental increase of the ‘new’ drug usually over 2–3 weeks.
Rarely, a wash-out period between drugs is required (eg before MAOIs).

253

254

CHAPTER 9

Psychiatry

Suicide and attempted suicide
Older people, especially men, have a higher risk of completed (rather than
attempted) suicide. Following an attempted suicide, further attempts—
and successful suicide—are common.
Risk factors include being male, single (ie unmarried, divorced/separated,
or widowed), socially isolated, having ﬁnancial problems, having made
previous attempts, and recent bereavement. Unlike younger people, the
substantial majority of older people who attempt suicide are psychiatrically
unwell at the time of the attempt; most are depressed. Many seek contact
with medical services prior to the attempt, although they may not express
depressive or suicidal thoughts at that visit.
Suicidal behaviours may be overt or covert.
Overt behaviours include:
• Intentional drug overdoses (opiates, antidepressants, paracetamol,
benzodiazepines; more common in women)
• Self-injury (hanging, shooting, jumping, drowning; more common
in men)
Covert suicide is relatively more common in older people, and includes
• Social withdrawal
• Severe self-neglect
• Refusal of food, ﬂuid, or medication
This may manifest in subtle ways that encourage extensive investigation to
exclude physical illness, while the psychiatric problem goes unrecognized
and untreated.
Suicidal ideation is more common in institutional settings (acute and
rehabilitation hospital wards, and care homes) and in people with acute or
chronic physical illness. Risk factors here include depression, chronic pain,
sleep disturbance, functional impairment, drug abuse, and psychotropic
drug prescription. At their mildest, suicidal ideas manifest as common and
relatively benign doubts about whether life is worth living. At their most
worrying, they are carefully considered, well formulated and strongly held
beliefs that death is preferable to life, and how that could be achieved.
Assessment of the ‘severity’ of an attempt requires an effort to determine
perceived risk from the patient’s perspective at the time of the attempt.
This may not parallel the medical seriousness. Consider:
• Degree of planning versus impulsivity
• Likelihood of interruption during attempt
• Reaction to interruption to attempt (disappointment or relief?)
• Suicide note and its contents
• Planning for future (eg making of will, contents of suicide note)
• Personal view of suicide as a reasonable ‘life choice’
Specialist referral. Always in cases of attempted suicide, suicidal ideation
or ‘covert suicide’. Probably not in cases of non-persistent or poorly
formulated views that life is not worth living.

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

The ageing cardiovascular system
Advanced age is the most potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
This vulnerability stems from:

Cumulative exposure to risk factors (extrinsic ageing)
• This was looked at in more detail in the WHO MONICA project (see
b ‘Further reading’, p.256), which looked at coronary risk factors in 38
populations across 21 countries for a decade
• This showed that not all risk factors increased with age—male smoking
decreased (although not female) and cholesterol showed a small
downwards trend. Body mass index (BMI) increased for both sexes
• Thus, it is not inevitable, and can be modiﬁed by behaviour, eg athletes
who continue to exercise into older age may show fewer signs of
cardiovascular ageing than an unﬁt younger person

Disease acquisition
• Often occult
• Affected by risk factor accumulation

Intrinsic ageing
The relative contributions of these factors to the clinical picture are
unclear. Table 10.1 addresses the three important questions:
• What are the common changes with age?
• How does that impact on function?
• What are the clinical implications?

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Chest pain
A common complaint in all settings. May be primary symptom (presenting
to GPs and general medical take) or mentioned only in response to direct
questioning. Also occurs during inpatient stays for other reasons.
There are very many causes, the majority of which become more
common with age. Many are benign, but some are serious and even life
threatening, so a thorough and sensible approach is needed.
Common conditions not to be missed include: cardiac pain; pleuritic
pain due to pulmonary infarction or infection; peptic pain (including
bleeding ulcers); pain from dissecting aortic aneurysm and pneumothorax
(especially in COPD).
Other possibilities include: muscular pain (eg after unaccustomed
exertion); costochondritis (local tenderness at sternal joint); pain from injury
(eg after a fall); referred pain from the back and neck (eg osteoarthritis) and
referred pain from the abdomen.
Differentiating these depends on accurate history taking and careful
examination, both of which can be more of a challenge in older patients.
Presentation may be atypical, and the patient may have many other
problems so teasing out which are the important symptoms can be
difﬁcult (experience improves the ability to ‘feel’ your way around the
history). 2It may be the last symptom mentioned in a long list, however,
mention of chest pain should always trigger a careful assessment.

History
• Is this a new symptom? (may suffer from chronic angina)
• If not, is it any different from the usual pain? (intensity, pattern)
• What is the nature of the pain? (pleuritic, heavy, tight. This is often hard
to do, and hand gestures can help—a clenched ﬁst for a heavy pain, a
stabbing action for a sharp pleuritic pain)
• Where is it located? (including radiation)
• How acute is the onset and what is the duration?
• Are there any associated symptoms?
Patients with cognitive impairment can be particularly difﬁcult to assess,
but allowing free conversation may reveal symptoms, followed by closed
questions that may prompt appropriate answers. Family members may
have noted signs or symptoms and are an invaluable aid to assessment,
eg clutching the chest after walking.
Remember that cardiac symptoms may differ for each patient and
they will describe the pain in their own terms. Many older adults with
ischaemia will deny ‘pain’ and instead describe ‘discomfort’. Some will just
experience weakness, dyspnoea, or nausea.

Examination
• How does the patient look? A sweaty, clammy patient needs urgent
and exhaustive assessment, whereas a patient drinking tea and chatting
is less likely to have a devastating condition
• What are the basic observations?

CHEST PAIN

• Signs of shock alert to a serious condition—IHD, pulmonary infarction,
dissection, sepsis, blood loss—but remember these may be late
signs and are less useful in older patients. The patient may usually be
hypertensive, so a BP of 120/80 may be very low for them; they may be
on a B-blocker, so unable to mount a tachycardia, etc.
• Temperature may be raised in sepsis
• Low oxygen saturation always needs explaining (unless chronic) and
may indicate an intrapulmonary problem
• Is the jugular venous pressure (JVP) elevated? (heart failure)
• Look at the chest wall for shingles, bruising and localized tenderness
• Different blood pressures in the arms may indicate dissection (but may
also occur with atheroma)
• Listen to the heart—are there any new murmurs (dissection or
infarction) or a rub (pericarditis)?
• Listen to the lungs—is there consolidation (sepsis) or a rub
(consolidation or infarction)?
• Look at the legs—is there any clinical DVT?

Investigations
Some tests can be less useful in older patients, and should be individually
tailored to the patient. Sending off every single test on all patients with
chest pain will only lead to confusion.
• ECG—should be done on the majority of patients with chest pain.
Remember the baseline ECG may well be abnormal in an elderly
person, and comparison with old traces is extremely useful. If your
patient has a very abnormal ECG (eg left bundle branch block (LBBB))
it is useful to give them a copy to carry with them
• CXR—looking for lung abnormalities and widening of the mediastinum.
Remember that the aorta often ‘unfolds’, so a careful look at the
contours of the aortic arch and/or comparison with old ﬁlms is needed
to assess possible dissection. Remember that a patient can look fairly
well in the early stages of aortic dissection
• Blood tests—basic haematology, biochemistry, and inﬂammatory
markers are often useful. Remember that in acute blood loss, the
haemoglobin may not drop immediately, and that an elderly septic
patient may take a day or two to develop an elevated white cell count
and CRP
• Troponin—useful in a patient with suspected cardiac chest pain (for
risk stratiﬁcation). It is NOT a useful test if you do not think this
is cardiac pain—there are many false positives that will only cause
confusion
• D-dimer—only useful if negative in cases of suspected
thromboembolism. There are a huge number of causes of a positive
d-dimer (including old age itself); a positive result does not imply the
diagnosis of PE
• Further tests (eg CT thorax for suspected dissection, exercise testing
for angina, lung perfusion scans for thromboembolism, etc.) depend on
clinical factors
2Always attempt to explain a chest pain—both for the patient and future
clinicians. A ‘diagnosis’ of non-cardiac chest pain is rarely helpful.

259

260

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Stable angina
Coronary artery disease is clinically evident in 20% of those >80 years.
Management is often suboptimal. It is unacceptable to leave a patient with
symptoms, however frail, until all available options have been looked at,
and it has been proven (by trying it) that a certain treatment cannot be
tolerated. A stepwise, slow introduction of tablets allows insight into
adverse effects and may require multiple clinic visits. Symptom diaries can
assist with this process.

Stable angina
Risk factor reduction
• Cholesterol and BP less likely to be lowered in older patients, but the
risk reduction is equal if not greater than for younger subjects
• Diabetic control is less likely to be tight, in part due to justiﬁable
concerns about the dangers of hypoglycaemia
• Lifestyle advice (exercise, smoking and diet) should be given
Aggravating conditions
Such as heart failure, anaemia, thyroid disease, arrhythmias, valvular heart
disease. More common in older people and should be corrected.
Medication
• Under utilized, particularly aspirin (concerns about bleeding) and
B-blockade but there is evidence that they are both equally useful in
reducing risk
• A trial and error approach to treatment is needed—add one or
two treatments at a time to minimize the risk of side effects (most
commonly orthostatic hypotension) and stop if there are problems,
trying something else instead
• Start on low doses, and titrate upwards (eg atenolol 25mg)
• Long-acting agents (eg diltiazem MR) reduce compliance problems
• Nicorandil (10–20 mg bd) is often better tolerated than other
anti-anginals in this age group.
• Choice of medication should be pragmatic—if a patient has a
bradycardia for example, a negatively chronotropic drug is usually
inappropriate (consider using amlodipine 5–10mg). If a patient has
heart failure, a cardio selective B-blocker (eg carvedilol, metoprolol,
bisoprolol) is a better choice than a ﬂuid-retaining calcium channel
blocker
• GTN can cause considerable problems with hypotension, and
instruction on correct use is essential. Tablets can be spat out once
the pain starts to settle, so (in theory) the dose can be titrated to
symptoms. In practice, the spray is often easier to use. It should be
used sitting down if possible and prophylactically before signiﬁcant
exertion
Revascularization
Should be considered (ideally after risk stratiﬁcation by stress testing), as
for younger patients, if symptoms persist despite maximal medical therapy
(see b ‘Revascularization procedures’, p.264).

STABLE ANGINA

Palliation
Consider if diffuse disease, not amenable to revascularization with ongoing
symptoms (eg home oxygen therapy, opiates to allow sleep).

HOW TO . . . Rationalize antianginals in older patients
When?
• With advancing age and frailty, mobility may reduce and so angina
symptoms may become less frequent, or even stop
• It is not uncommon to ﬁnd an octogenarian on four antianginals, who
has not had angina for many years
• Use a low pulse or BP reading as a trigger to review the medication
• Do not hesitate to rationalize this—there are many pitfalls from
polypharmacy, and requirements will change with time
How?
• If cognitive impairment, conﬁrm with carers that they are genuinely
asymptomatic from angina
• Review observations—if bradycardic, stop B-blockade ﬁrst;
if hypotensive, start with the symptomatic medications ﬁrst
(eg nitrates) before those with disease-modifying properties
• Select one drug to modify, then reduce in a stepwise fashion
(eg reducing dose and/or frequency)
• Patients and family may be resistant to medication changes after
years of healthcare professionals emphasizing the importance of their
tablets. Some are frightened of a recurrence of disabling symptoms
so explain to the patient, carers and GP what you are doing
• Clarify contingency plan: ‘This is a trial, and if it does not suit you,
you may get angina pains again. If that happens, please just start taking
your old doses again’
• Ensure there is back-up if there are concerns (eg telephone number)
Review
• Set a date for review of impact
• Assess whether there have been any symptoms, and reassess the
pulse and BP
• If all is well, continue with careful reduction in medication
Goal
• Aim to use as few medications as possible, while maintaining control
of symptoms
• If the BP allows, continue those with disease-modifying properties
(B-blockade, ACE inhibitors), but in frail older people it is more
important to avoid orthostatic hypotension and falls
• Once the medication has been titrated down to an optimum
level (balancing pulse, BP, symptoms, and disease modiﬁcation)
communicate the ﬁnal list to the GP

261

262

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Acute coronary syndromes
CHD incidence rises with increasing age. An acute coronary syndrome
describes a scenario in which the myocardial cells are not receiving enough
blood and oxygen to meet their demands. There is a range of syndromes
from unstable angina to non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) to ST elevation MI
(STEMI). Management in general is as for younger patients, but there are
some points relating to older patients in particular.

Atypical presentation
• More likely to present with atypical or vague symptoms (eg intense
dyspnoea, syncope, weakness, abdominal pain)
• Symptoms may be obscured by comorbidity
• ECG changes may not be present in up to a quarter of acute MI with
the full diagnostic triad (chest pain, ECG changes, and biochemical
changes) present in under a third of those >85 years
• ECG may be difﬁcult to interpret because of pre-existing abnormalities
(LBBB, pacing)
• Vital signs or symptoms may be obscured by medication (B-blockade,
pain medication)

Different pathology
• More pre-existing coronary artery disease with more multivessel
disease
• NSTEMI more likely than an STEMI
• More likely to develop heart failure, AV block, AF, and cardiogenic
shock after a coronary event

Later presentation
• Increased prevalence of angina so less alarmed by chest pains
• May modify lifestyle to avoid symptoms (if climbing a hill gives them
chest pain, they may just stop doing it)
• Increased occurrence of ‘silent ischaemia’ (especially in people with
diabetes)
• Increased social/attitudinal factors (I didn’t want to bother the doctor’)
• A third of patients >65 with MI will present later than 6hr after
symptom onset

Increased comorbidity
• Making diagnosis difﬁcult (eg a patient with COPD who has exertional
breathlessness) and therapy less well tolerated (eg B-blockers with
peripheral vascular disease)
• Also as comorbidities add up, so frailty increases and medications are
generally less well tolerated
Older patients with acute coronary syndromes have a higher inpatient
mortality so should be prioritized for specialist monitoring where there
are limited resources; however, it is known that they are:
• Less likely to receive aggressive acute therapy (eg less thrombolysis,
angiography and angioplasty, coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG),
and maximal medical treatment)
• Less likely to have full secondary prevention measures implemented

ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROMES

Management of the older cardiac patient is therefore more difﬁcult and
more likely to result in death than in younger patients. Sometimes there
are good reasons for withholding therapy (eg patients presenting later are
less often eligible for thrombolysis, side effects may restrict secondary prevention) but often the justiﬁcation is less robust. Lack of evidence in older
people does not mean that there is no beneﬁt—rather that it has not
been proven, as is the case with many commonly used therapies (eg loop
diuretics in pulmonary oedema).
Common sense dictates when to use an aggressive approach, considering the patient as a whole including:
• Patient preference where possible
• Comorbidities (alter risk proﬁle)
• Current medication
• Frailty and likely life expectancy
• Apparent biological age rather than chronological age
There are many well-deﬁned treatment algorithms, and older patients
should be included at every step unless there are good reasons not to.
If you plan to exclude a patient from treatment, you should clearly document your rationale.

263

264

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Revascularization procedures
Includes percutaneous coronary angiography and intervention (PCI)
and CABG.
When?
• Used when stable symptoms persist despite maximal medical
therapy, when unstable symptoms fail to settle, or for acute
myocardial infarction (primary PCI)
• Risk stratify with exercise testing and troponin measurements. Older
patients may be unable to exercise, but consider bicycle exercise,
stress echocardiography or an isotope myocardial perfusion scan to
look for evidence of reversible ischaemia
What are the risks?
• PCI—higher risk of death, renal failure and infarction in elderly. Age
is an independent predictor of increased complication, but so too are
diabetes, heart failure and chronic renal impairment, all of which are
more common in older patients.
• CABG—increased early mortality and stroke in older patients
What are the beneﬁts?
• PCI—may be only way to control intrusive symptoms in stable
angina, and the only way to settle an acute coronary syndrome.
Variable evidence from studies—all agree increased early
complications, but longer-term beneﬁts in older patients are
reported as equivalent or even better
• CABG—probably better with triple vessel disease, poor exercise
tolerance, poor left ventricular function and diabetes. Generally
well tolerated in elderly, with similar long-term improvements in
symptoms and quality of life to younger patients. New minimally
invasive techniques, that do not require bypass, are likely to reduce
the early complications without impairing outcome
Overall recommendations
Consider all patients who fail medical treatment for revascularization
procedures, regardless of age. The early complication rate is higher in
older patients, but the eventual beneﬁt is equal if not better than for
younger patients.
Approach a cardiologist with a record of treating older patients.
Crucial to include the patient in the decision, with a frank and individualised discussion about risks and beneﬁts.

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Myocardial infarction
This includes both NSTEMI and STEMI. Around two-thirds of all myocardial infarctions occur in patients >65 and a third in patients >75. Overall,
the incidence of MI has decreased, but this is not the case for older
patients. Despite this, evidence regarding optimal management is lacking,
as older patients tend to be underrepresented in clinical trials. Table 10.2
summarizes what is known.
As a general rule, all appropriate therapies should be considered in
all patients post-MI, regardless of age. While evidence is lacking in older
patients, it is more reasonable to extrapolate from a younger population
than to deny treatment. This approach must of course be tempered with
common sense and individually tailored decision making.

Prior to discharge
Medication
• May include aspirin ± clopidogrel, statin, B-blockade, ACE inhibitor,
and GTN spray
• Use medications unless they are contraindicated, or the risk > beneﬁt
• Be alert for common side effects (more likely with advancing age),
eg orthostatic hypotension, gastrointestinal bleeding
Education
• Diet, nutrition, cholesterol control
• Smoking cessation
• Activity restrictions and graded reintroduction
• Recurrent symptoms and what to do
• Routine follow up after stents

Cardiac rehabilitation
• Used after acute coronary syndromes and multiple presentations of
congestive heart failure
• Involves structured exercise programme
• Proven to improve exercise tolerance and decrease readmission
• Under used for older cardiac patients—less referral, and sometimes
there are upper age limits in place
• Beneﬁt seen in older patients is equivalent to that in younger
patients, although they start from a less ﬁt baseline
• Older people adhere well to programmes and seem to suffer no
complications
• Some adaptations are needed (more time to warm up and cool
down, longer breaks, avoidance of high impact activity, lower
intensity for a longer time)
• Beneﬁts include improved ﬁtness, increased bone mineral density,
improved mood and fewer falls as well as improved cardiovascular
ﬁtness

Equivalent risk reduction in elderly population

Primary PCI

This is usually the strategy of choice where presentation is early.
It reduces death and recurrent MI compared with a conservative
strategy. Procedural risks are greater with frail patients and the
role for PCI in those >80 with multiple comorbidities has not
been well studied. Resource limitations may impact

Thrombolysis

Not indicated for unstable angina or NSTEMI
Has a role in STEMI regardless of age
Must be administered <12hr after onset (ideally <3hr) and is
used where PCI is not available or feasible
Increased risk of complications, eg cerebral bleeding (but can
predict those at higher risk if hypertensive, low body weight,
previous stroke or on warfarin)
Contradictory evidence regarding mortality—large RCTs
suggest increased absolute risk reduction of mortality in elderly
patients (eg ISIS-2) but these are selected, probably ﬁtter
patients, and do not include the very old. Observational trials
of actual practice suggest equivalent beneﬁt in older patients,
or possibly even a survival disadvantage. Probable equivalent
proportional mortality reduction, so absolute reduction
greatest in elderly who have the highest mortality
Overall, consensus is that thrombolysis can be used in older
patients, with rare exceptions for the very frail or where
individual risk seems to outweigh beneﬁt

Low molecular

Full dose is effective in NSTEMI, and possibly more effective in
older patients

Trials using this therapy in unstable angina and NSTEMI show

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Hypertension
Hypertension is an important risk factor for vascular disease. Historically
underdiagnosed and undertreated, especially in older patients, although
this is improving in the UK as GPs now have ﬁnancial incentives to treat
hypertension.
The incidence of hypertension overall rises with age, reaching a
prevalence of 60–80% beyond 65. After this age, systolic BP (SBP) rises
linearly while diastolic BP (DBP) falls, leading to widening of the pulse
pressure and relative frequency of isolated systolic hypertension (Table
10.3). Isolated systolic hypertension reﬂects reduced arterial compliance
which is disease related and not a part of ‘normal’ ageing per se.
Hypertension is an independent risk factor for stroke, IHD, peripheral
vascular disease, congestive heart failure, renal failure, and dementia in all
age groups, but in older patients it is SBP and widened pulse pressure that
are the strongest predictors of adverse cardiovascular outcome.

Assessment
• Ask about symptoms (including hypotensive), comorbidity, smoking
• Measure with a well-maintained, calibrated device, with an appropriate
sized cuff:
• Check supine and standing BP (orthostatic hypotension can cause
symptoms when treatment initiated)
• Take at least two measurements in a single consultation
• Never initiate treatment based on a single reading
• Consider ambulatory measurements if drug resistance, variable BP,
white coat hypertension, or postural symptoms
• Examine for evidence of target organ damage (stroke, dementia,
carotid bruits, cardiac enlargement, IHD, peripheral vascular disease,
renal disease, retinal changes)
• Consider secondary hypertension—Rare in older patients, but consider
if drug resistant, severe hypertension or with suggestive examination
or laboratory ﬁndings. Consider medications (NSAIDs, steroids,
SSRIs), Cushing’s syndrome, sleep apnoea, primary aldosteronism,
phaeochromocytoma, or renal artery stenosis
• Investigations to look at target organs (urinalysis, blood urea, and
electrolytes, ECG) and for risk factor analysis (glucose, lipids)

HYPERTENSION

Treatment thresholds and goals
• Depends on individual
• In active elderly population with reasonable life expectancy treat as for
younger patients—ie >160/100mmHg
• Use lower threshold (>140mmHg) in high-risk patients (eg smokers,
diabetics, evidence of target organ damage, high estimated 10-year risk)
• No clear evidence for optimal target. Probably the lower the better as
long as tolerated
• The usual limit to treatment is symptomatic postural hypotension;
consider using alternative agents which may cause less orthostatic drop
(eg ARBs, calcium channel blockers)
• Caution in isolated systolic hypertension—try not to lower DBP
<65mmHg
• There are even fewer data for very elderly (>85) people and a
pragmatic approach based on apparent biological age is appropriate

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Hypertension: treatment
Similar approach to that used in younger patients, but it is important to
bear the following in mind:
• Side effects are more common and more debilitating in older
patients (due to more sluggish baroreceptors and reduced cerebral
autoregulation)
• There is a greater risk of drug interactions as older patients are more
often victims of polypharmacy
• Comorbidity is common and should direct the choice of
antihypertensive agents (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Use antihypertensives
in a patient with comorbid conditions’, p.271)
• Hypertension should be seen as a risk factor and the decision to
treat should be weighed along with other risk factors. In a very frail
elderly person with a limited life expectancy, the side effects might
far outweigh any future beneﬁts from risk factor modiﬁcation. This,
however, should be an active decision reached if possible with the
patient, and not a simple omission
• Begin with lower doses and titrate up slowly (‘start low and go slow’)
to minimize adverse reactions. It is better to be on something at a low
dose than nothing at all

Non-pharmacological measures
Lifestyle modiﬁcations are as important and effective in reducing BP in
older patients as in the young. Salt restriction, weight reduction, and
regular exercise are particularly effective. Moderate or absent alcohol
intake is advised. Smoking cessation and decreasing saturated fat intake
helps with overall risk reduction.

Choice of medication
Many large trials have compared the different classes of antihypertensive
but with little consistency in results. Overall, it seems that it is lowering the
BP per se that is the important factor, and this beneﬁt continues up until
at least 84 years (possibly beyond—evidence pending). In older patients,
with much comorbidity, there may be compelling reasons for using, or
not using certain agents (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Use antihypertensives in a
patient with comorbid conditions’, p.271). Try to use a drug that will treat
both BP and a coexisting disease to limit polypharmacy. If not, then the
British Hypertension Society recommends using the A/CD approach:
• A ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers
• C Calcium channel blockers
• D Diuretics
In younger (<55), white patients, begin with A. In older patients and all
black patients begin with C or D.
If inadequate control:
1. Try A+C or A+D
2. Then A+C+D
3. Finally, consider adding an A-blocker, spironolactone, or B-blocker

HYPERTENSION: TREATMENT

HOW TO . . . Use antihypertensives in a patient with
comorbid conditions
Calcium channel blockers
• Use rate-limiting options (eg diltiazem) to slow heart rate in AF or
reduce angina with normal LV function
• May make heart failure worse or cause constipation
• Dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (eg amlodipine, felodipine)
are excellent in isolated systolic hypertension

Thiazide diuretics
For example: bendroﬂumethiazide 2.5mg
• Useful ﬁrst-line therapy in most older patients—may help with ankle
swelling and heart failure symptoms
• Avoid if severe gout, urinary incontinence or profound dyslipidaemia
• May worsen urinary incontinence
• Need to monitor for hyponatraemia

B-blockers
For example: atenolol 25mg
• Useful with angina, AF, and stable heart failure (cardioselective better)
• Avoid with peripheral vascular disease, asthma, heart block
ACE inhibitors
For example: ramipril 2.5–10mg
• Use for secondary prevention after vascular event (stroke, TIA, heart
attack), in diabetes, heart failure and chronic renal impairment
• Avoid in renal artery stenosis and aortic stenosis
• Monitor potassium and renal function

ARBs
For example: losartan 50mg
• Use when ACE intolerant (usually cough) where an ACE is indicated
• May cause less orthostatic symptoms than ACE inhibitors
• Monitor potassium and renal function

A-blockers
For example: doxazosin 1mg
• Excellent for resistant hypertension in older patients
• Use if prostatic hypertrophy
• Commonly cause orthostatic symptoms
• May exacerbate stress incontinence

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Arrhythmia: presentation
Arrhythmias are very common in older people, but are not so common as
a presenting complaint. A patient with recurrent presyncope preceded by
palpitations presents very little diagnostic challenge. What is much more
common is for an arrhythmia to be the explanation for a rather more
vague presentation such as:
• Recurrent falls
• Patient covered in bruises who has been explaining them away as
clumsiness
• General fatigue
• Dizzy spells
• Light-headedness
• ‘Collapse query cause’
• Blackouts
• Worsening/new angina or heart failure

History
It is important to ask about palpitations with any of these problems,
(indeed it should form part of the systems review in all older people) but
be aware of the following points:
• Clarify carefully what you mean—many people do not understand what
we mean by ‘palpitations’ and may be describing an ectopic heart beat
followed by a compensatory pause, or even just an awareness of the
normal heart beat, eg when lying in bed at night. Getting the patient to
tap out what they feel can be very revealing
• Do not exclude the possibility of an arrhythmia just because the patient
does not complain of palpitations—especially with confused patients
• Where there are palpitations/light-headedness, establish an order
wherever possible. Postural hypotension (see b ‘Orthostatic
(postural) hypotension’, p.118) is very common in older patients,
and can produce a similar set of symptoms (falling BP causing
light-headedness, then a compensatory tachycardia)—in theory
the palpitations should come ﬁrst in an arrhythmia
• Are there any constant features? For example—dizziness occurring:
• on standing is more likely to be postural hypotension
• on exertion may have an ischaemic component
• on turning the head may be due to vestibular problems, or carotid
sinus hypersensitivity (see b ‘Carotid sinus syndrome’, p.122)
• in any situation or at any time is much more likely to be due to an
arrhythmia
• A history of signiﬁcant injury (especially facial bruising) with a
blackout increases the chances of ﬁnding an arrhythmia, particularly a
bradycardia requiring pacing
• Always take a full drug history—antiarrhythmics can be proarrhythmogenic, drugs that cause bradyarrhythmias (commonly
B-blockers, digoxin or rate limiting calcium channel blockers such
as diltiazem), and antidepressants (especially the tricyclics) that
can predispose to arrhythmias. Medications containing ephedrine,
thyroxine, caffeine and B-agonists can cause tachyarrhythmias

ARRHYTHMIA: PRESENTATION

Examination
• Should always include lying and standing BP, assessment of the baseline
pulse character, rate and rhythm, full cardiovascular examination to
look for evidence of structural cardiac disease (eg cardiomyopathy,
heart failure, valvular lesions) all of which may predispose to
arrhythmias
• General problems require a full general examination—it is rarely
appropriate to examine a single system only in an elderly patient.
A rectal examination, eg, may reveal a rectal tumour causing anaemia
and hence palpitations
• It may also be appropriate to examine the vestibular system
(see b ‘HOW TO . . . Examine the vestibular system’, p.561) and
central nervous system

Investigations
• Blood tests—including FBC (anaemia), UC+E (low potassium
predisposes to arrhythmias), thyroid function, digoxin levels where
relevant
• ECG—look for baseline rhythm and any evidence of conducting system
disease (eg a bundle branch block, or any heart block). Measure the
P-R and the Q-T interval. Also look for LV hypertrophy (arrhythmias
more likely) or ischaemia. A totally normal ECG diminishes the
possibility of clinically signiﬁcant arrhythmia
• CXR—look at cardiac size
• Holter monitoring—a prolonged ECG recording. Usually a 24-hr
period initially. Remember this is a very small snapshot, and of limited
value especially if symptoms are infrequent. Can be useful if the
symptoms are experienced while the monitor is on, and the ECG trace
shows normal sinus rhythm. If the suspicion of arrhythmias is high,
then repeat the test, or arrange for trans-telephonic event recording
or even an implantable loop recorder where the symptoms are severe
enough (eg sudden syncope)

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Arrhythmias: management
Management of arrhythmias in older patients does not differ signiﬁcantly
from management in other age groups, but consider the following.

Precipitants
• Always check for common precipitants in older patients:
• Electrolyte abnormalities (especially hypo or hyperkalaemia and
hypocalcaemia)
• Anaemia
• MI
• Antiarrhythmic toxicity (especially digoxin)
• Sepsis
• Hypothermia
• Any other acute illness
• If the precipitant cannot be reversed quickly (eg sepsis) then the
arrhythmia is likely to be recurrent. Consider cardiac monitoring if
cardiovascular compromise or if arrhythmia recurrence is likely

Effect of arrhythmia
• Tachycardia may be less well tolerated than in younger patients causing
signiﬁcant hypotension, angina, or heart failure
• Hypotension itself may be less well tolerated than in younger patients
(risk of cerebral injury) and so prompt action is required
• Where there is heart failure because of an arrhythmia, ﬂuids cannot
be used for resuscitation and so deﬁnitive action is required sooner
rather than later. Begin by using standard treatment for acute
heart failure (oxygen, intravenous diuretics, and opiates, etc.) while
organizing cardioversion (usually electrical for speed) or rate limitation
(appropriate for AF)

Diagnosis
• There is more likely to be underlying cardiac pathology—always check
for ischaemia and structural heart disease even for apparently benign
arrhythmias (eg SVT)
• Bundle branch block is common, and so there may be confusion
between supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias. There are
numerous subtle ways of distinguishing between these but in an
emergency:
• If the patient is compromised, electrical cardioversion will treat
both effectively
• If the patient is unwell, but stable, an amiodarone infusion will treat
both effectively, and has the advantage of causing little myocardial
depression

ARRHYTHMIAS: MANAGEMENT

Treatment
• Elderly patients are much more likely to be on an antiarrhythmic drug
already.
2Check the medication carefully before administering any therapy. See
Box 10.1 for common pitfalls.
• Electrical cardioversion is well tolerated by most older patients, usually
effective and less likely to cause side effects than many medications.
It should be considered early where there is signiﬁcant compromise.
Anaesthetic support is required, which can take some time to arrange,
so prompt referral is recommended. It is less useful in acute sepsis
where the arrhythmia is likely to recur, and it is hard to establish
whether compromise is caused by the sepsis or the arrhythmia.
• Implantable cardiovertor deﬁbrillators are life-saving for malignant
ventricular arrhythmias (VT and VF) in patients with low ejection
fractions. However they are very expensive, can cause debility and
pain and do not allow a natural death (they must be turned off during
palliative care). There is reluctance to use them in older, frail patients
in whom non-arrhythmic deaths are common.

Box 10.1 Common pitfalls with anti-arrhythmic
medication
Adenosine
• Its action is prolonged by dipyridamole (commonly prescribed with
aspirin in stroke), so avoid using together
• Exacerbates asthma and is antagonized by theophylline, so avoid in
asthmatic people
Amiodarone
• Risk of ventricular arrhythmias when used with disopyramide,
procainamide and quinidine, so avoid concomitant use
• Increases plasma half-life of ﬂecainide, so reduce dose
Atropine
• Can precipitate glaucoma, so avoid in patients with this condition
Flecainide
• Contraindicated when there is IHD, heart failure and haemodynamic
compromise
• Probably best avoided in most older patients, who may well have
occult cardiac disease
Verapamil
• Do not use intravenously in a patient already on a B-blocker
(high risk of asystole and hypotension)
General guidance
Most antiarrhythmic medication used concomitantly increases the risk of
myocardial depression and arrhythmias. This effect is more pronounced
in older patients. Caution when using more than one, and consider using
sequentially rather than additively if one alone is ineffective.

275

276

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Atrial ﬁbrillation
Common arrhythmia, becoming more common with age (risk doubles
with each additional decade of age, rising to 7% in >85 year olds). Often
associated with other disease (eg hypertension, coronary artery disease,
mitral valve disease, thyrotoxicosis) but also occurs in 1–2% of otherwise
healthy elderly people. Unlike other arrhythmias, it is often chronic.
Disorganized atrial activity with variable conduction to the ventricles
leads to an irregularly irregular pulse rate and volume. Up to a third of
older patients with AF will have AV nodal disease that limits the rate to
less than 100bpm, often making it asymptomatic. It is therefore often noted
incidentally during routine examination—but should never be ignored.

Assessment
Should include examination for hypertension and valve disease, blood
tests for thyroid disease and an ECG to conﬁrm the diagnosis (may be
sinus rhythm with ectopics). Paroxysmal AF may cause intermittent symptoms and should be looked for with Holter monitoring.

Complications
AF causes an increase in morbidity and mortality, even if there is no
underlying cardiac disease.
• Pulse >120 often causes palpitations, light-headedness, or syncope
• Rapid rate may also cause dyspnoea, angina, or heart failure
• General malaise may also result from a chronically suboptimal cardiac
output
• AF is often associated with periods of AV conduction delay (‘pauses’)
and if >3sec these may cause syncope
• The main complication is stroke from cardiac emboli

Atrial ﬂutter
• Rapid, regular atrial activity (usually 300/min)
• Characteristic saw tooth appearance on ECG (revealed by carotid
sinus massage if rate high)
• Rate depends on degree of AV block (150bpm if 2:1 block, 75bpm if
4:1 block etc.)
2Always think of atrial ﬂutter when the pulse rate is 150
• Commonly associated with COPD or IHD
• Similar embolic risk to AF, and as the patient will often ﬂip in and out
of ﬂutter and ﬁbrillation they should be managed in the same way
• Treat with rate control and stroke prophylaxis. This rhythm is usually
amenable to cardioversion, but if there are signiﬁcant comorbidities,
structural heart disease or valve disease, then sinus rhythm is unlikely
to be sustained

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: RATE/RHYTHM CONTROL

Atrial ﬁbrillation: rate/rhythm control
Acute AF
• Treat underlying condition, eg sepsis, ischaemia, heart failure
• If compromised, consider electrical cardioversion
• Otherwise, control rate (usually with B-blocker or rate-limiting calcium
channel blocker such as verapamil if no contraindication, eg heart
failure; digoxin if resistant)
• May resolve once precipitant has been dealt with
• Remember stroke prophylaxis

Chronic AF
• Guidelines suggest rate control with B-blockade (eg bisoprolol) or
calcium channel blockers (eg diltiazem, verapamil)
• In practice, many frail old patients will tolerate digoxin better, and this
remains the ﬁrst choice of many geriatricians (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Use digoxin’, p.281)
• Where chemical cardioversion is considered on symptomatic grounds
give amiodarone (initially 200mg tds for a week, then 200mg bd for a
week, then 200mg od thereafter. May be able to drop dose further to
100mg a day, or even every other day).
2Remember that amiodarone interacts with warfarin and regular monitoring of INR will be needed if the two are used together—as is often the
case. Also can cause thyroid abnormalities, and this should be monitored
with TFTs (see b ‘Amiodarone’, p.138). Dronedarone is a newer agent
that is simpler to use than amiodarone, but cannot be used in severe heart
failure and safety in permanent AF is unclear.
• Electrical cardioversion for chronic AF should only be attempted
after a period of anticoagulation (minimum 3 weeks). It is more likely
to succeed (and less likely to recur) where there are fewer of the
following present:
• Structural heart disease (hypertrophy, atrial enlargement, valvular
heart disease etc.)
• Comorbidity (especially hypertension, heart failure)
• Increasing age
Recent evidence suggests that an older patient with several of the factors
listed is better off being treated with rate control and anticoagulation only,
without attempting cardioversion
• Consider atrial catheter ablation if refractory to treatment, to destroy
or isolate abnormal electrical impulses

Paroxysmal AF
• Equal embolic risk, so consider anticoagulation as for chronic AF
• Remember that digoxin does not prevent AF
• Amiodarone, dronedarone, or B-blockers (eg bisoprolol) are useful to
prevent paroxysms of AF
• Ablation therapy may be useful in those with normal-sized atria and
few comorbidities, although the recurrence rate is probably higher than
in younger patients

277

278

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Atrial ﬁbrillation: stroke prevention
This is a complex and often emotive issue. Many older people will have
very strong views about stroke (‘I’d rather die than ever have a stroke’)
or warfarin (many know it as rat poison, or have known someone who
had a bleed while on warfarin). As we are dealing with population risks
and beneﬁts, it is impossible to accurately predict for a single individual
what will happen to them if they do, or do not take preventative therapy.
Conveying this concept is difﬁcult, but because the decision is complex,
involvement of the patient becomes key. This takes time and patience.
It is important to have a simple way of explaining the facts as they are
known, perhaps writing them down for clarity, then allowing time for
them to sink in before coming to a ﬁnal decision. There is no enormous
urgency—the stroke risks quoted are per annum, and it is worth giving the
patient time to think things over if required.
Address each of the following questions.

What is the risk of stroke in this patient with AF?
Overall, the risk is about ﬁve times greater than a person with similar
health and age who does not have AF. Paroxysmal AF carries the same
embolic risk.
This risk may be more accurately quantiﬁed by the following:
High risk (6–12% chance of stroke per year)
• >65 with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes)
• Previous stroke or TIA
• Cardiac disease (MI, heart failure)
• Echo abnormalities (poor LV function on echo, atrial clot)
• Thyroid disease
Medium risk (3–5% chance of stroke per year)
• >65 but with none of the high-risk characteristics
• <65 with cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension, diabetes)
Low risk (less than 1% chance of stroke per year)
• <65 with no additional high risk factors
Risk prediction tools
• CHADS2 aims to predict risk of stroke in AF using clinical features
(congestive heart failure, hypertension, age >75, diabetes and previous
stroke) Validated and widely used (see b ‘Further reading’, p.279, for
details)
• Recently modiﬁed to include female sex, age>65, and a history of
vascular disease (CHA2DS2-VASc), which may be more discriminatory
at low risk
2In clinical practice, most frailer older patients will have a risk of stroke
that warrants consideration of anticoagulation.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: STROKE PREVENTION

What is the risk of therapy?
• Warfarin when taken correctly and monitored carefully has around
1% per year risk of major bleeding in primary prevention of stroke,
and 2.5% risk in secondary prevention
• Newer, direct thrombin inhibitors, eg dabigatran require less
monitoring and are likely to be used more in stroke prevention

How effective is therapy at reducing risk?
• Warfarin reduces stroke risk in AF by around 60–70%
• Aspirin (300mg) reduces risk by around 20–25%

What are the recommendations?
• Where there are no contraindications, any patient with a stroke risk
estimated at greater than 4% per year should have anticoagulation
(ie the high-risk and most of the moderate-risk groups, see b
‘What is the risk of stroke in this patient with AF?’, p.278)
• Those with a risk of 1–4% should have aspirin
• Those with a risk <1% should have no treatment

Other options
There is limited trial evidence that occlusion of the left atrial appendage
using a percutaneous device is equivalent to warfarin in the prevention of
stroke (see b ‘Further reading’, p. 279). This may be an option for highrisk patients in whom anticoagulation is not feasible.

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

HOW TO . . . Discuss warfarin for AF
Your patient is an 86-year-old woman with hypertension, IHD, and mild
heart failure. She currently takes aspirin, atenolol, bendroﬂumethiazide,
furosemide, and ramipril. She has newly diagnosed AF, which is rate controlled because of the atenolol.
You wish to discuss starting warfarin with her. The conversation may
go as follows:
Doctor: ‘You have a condition called atrial ﬁbrillation—where the heart
beat is irregular. It is not causing you any problems at the moment, it is
common and it is not a dangerous heart condition. However, there is
a risk that this irregular beat could send a clot to the brain and cause
a stroke and I would like to consider a treatment to reduce the risk of
this happening.’
Patient: ‘A stroke? I’m going to have a stroke?’
Doctor: ‘If we took 100 people in your situation, then in a year about 10
of them would have a stroke—but 90 would not’
Patient: ‘I would hate to have a stroke. What can you do?’
Doctor: ‘We can thin your blood with a drug called warfarin’
Patient: ‘I’ve heard of that—isn’t it very dangerous?’
Doctor: ‘You would need to have regular blood tests to make sure the
dosage was right. If those 100 people all took warfarin, then one of them
would have a serious problem with bleeding’
Patient: ‘But it will stop me from having a stroke?’
Doctor: ‘Going back to those 100 people—if they all take the warfarin,
then only three or four will have a stroke instead of the original 10. The
risk is reduced by about 2/3.’
Patient: ‘Which three or four people?’
Doctor: ‘There is no way of predicting who will beneﬁt from treatment
and who will have a problem. What we do know is that overall, the
risk is lower with warfarin, and so we do recommend treatment for
someone like you.’
Patient: ‘Do I have to?’
Doctor: ‘No, of course not. It is your decision. I will give you an
information leaﬂet—why don’t you go away and think it over—we will
talk again’.

ATRIAL FIBRILLATION: STROKE PREVENTION

HOW TO . . . Use digoxin
Indications
• Rate control of AF
• Mild positive inotrope sometimes used in heart failure
Not useful for
• Paroxysmal AF prevention
• Exercise induced fast AF
Loading with digoxin
1mg in divided doses over 24hr.
This dose is always required, regardless of renal function—modify
maintenance doses only in renal impairment.
Example: Day 1—8am digoxin 500micrograms po, 8pm digoxin 500
micrograms po.
Day 2—8am digoxin at maintenance dose

Deciding a maintenance dose
• Main determinant is renal function—digoxin is excreted this way, so
use low dose with renal impairment
• Consider also body mass—eg start with 62.5micrograms for a
small elderly woman—the dose can always be increased if there is
inadequate rate control
• Dosage is determined clinically, but serum levels can be used to
assess toxicity or concordance
Digoxin toxicity
• Hypokalaemia predisposes to this, so always monitor potassium and
supplement if needed. Target [K] >4.0mM
• Symptoms include confusion, nausea, vomiting, arrhythmias
(especially nodal bradycardia and ventricular ectopics) and yellow or
green visual haloes
• ECG may show ST depression and inverted T wave in V5 and V6
(reversed tick)
• Treat by stopping medication, rehydrating and correcting
hypokalaemia
• Life-threatening poisoning can be treated with digoxin-speciﬁc
antibody fragments

281

282

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Bradycardia and conduction disorders
As the heart ages the function of the cardiac pacemaker (the SA node)
and the conducting system (bundle of His and Purkinje ﬁbres) tends to
decline, due to:
• Declining numbers of cells in the SA node
• Increasing prevalence of disease (atheroma, amyloid and hypertension)
• Degeneration with ﬁbrosis and fat inﬁltration
This is not inevitable, but around 50% of older patients will have some
ECG evidence of conduction delay (prolonged PR and QT interval,
left axis deviation, etc.) and be prone to symptomatic bradycardia and
conduction disorders.

Causes
• Medication—digoxin, amiodarone, B-blockers (including some eye
drops), calcium channel blockers, donepezil, tricyclic antidepressants
• Sick sinus syndrome—isolated sinus node dysfunction, very common
in older patients, with uncertain cause (theories include vascular
insufﬁciency or amyloid inﬁltration, but often no cause is found)
• IHD
• Structural heart disease—eg hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Systemic disease—hypothyroidism, liver failure, hypothermia, hypoxia,
hypercapnia, cerebral disease (eg stroke, raised intracranial pressure,
haemorrhage)

Presentation
• Often picked up incidentally on an ECG
• When symptomatic bradycardia causes low output syndromes ranging
from fatigue, dizziness, dyspnoea and presyncope, syncope and falls,
angina to heart failure and shock
• May be intermittent (with paroxysmal bradyarrhythmias), chronic (with
stable arrhythmias) or occur acutely (usually post-MI)

Management
Not every bradycardic patient needs an urgent pacemaker—the local
cardiology service will help if in doubt.
For every problem, consider:
Is the patient acutely compromised?
• If so, then urgent treatment is required in order to minimize cerebral
injury. For shock, lie the patient down, and elevate the legs. Use iv
ﬂuids and/or try to increase the heart rate using atropine (0.6mg
iv, repeated up to total dose of 3mg), an isoprenaline infusion, or
temporary pacing (external pads are quick and often well tolerated;
if the situation persists, insert a temporary pacing wire)
• If the patient is stable and has no reversible factors then they can wait
for the next available permanent pacing list

BRADYCARDIA AND CONDUCTION DISORDERS

• Tailor your treatment to each individual—if the cause of the
bradycardia is a catastrophic intracerebral event, then putting the
patient through a temporary wire is not sensible—try external paddles
to increase the heart rate and see if this has a positive impact on
consciousness level while a CT scan is organized. Conversely, an
acute inferior MI may cause signiﬁcant short-term problems with
bradycardia yet little longer-term cardiac damage
Are there any symptoms?
• If so, are they attributable to the bradycardia? Is the condition likely to
resolve?
• Reversible bradyarrhythmia commonly occurs after acute inferior MI,
in which case support the patient during the acute episode as needed
(non-invasively if feasible)
How frequent are the symptoms?
• Continuous—temporary wire may be needed before permanent pacing
• Exertional—consider bed rest pending permanent pacing instead of
a temporary wire (reduces risk of infection and makes insertion of
permanent wire easier)
• Infrequent—elective permanent pacemaker can be organized
• No symptoms—no action is required unless there is a high risk of
future asystole. Asystole is a major risk with second-degree heart block
type II where there is also bundle branch block and complete heart
block even if asymptomatic and a pacemaker is required for these
Are there any reversible factors?
• Check medication. Digoxin (especially with toxicity), amiodarone,
B-blockers and calcium channel blockers can all cause or exacerbate
bradycardia
• Check thyroid function
• Acutely, hypothermia can also cause bradycardia which reverses when
patient normothermic again

283

284

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Permanent pacemakers
Indications
• Over 85% are used for patients >64 years old
• 50% are for sick sinus syndrome and AV block
• Increasingly used for vasodepressor carotid sinus hypersensitivity
• Occasionally used for recurrent syncope where no cause is found
• Used with AV node ablation with refractory AF
• Resynchronization therapy for heart failure
Pacemakers
• Dual chamber pacemakers are more expensive but tend to produce
a better cardiac output and less AF than single chamber ones
• Permanent pacing should be programmed to minimize paced beats
allowing the intrinsic rhythm to get through as much as possible
• In LV dysfunction, pacing may need to include multisite pacing as RV
pacing can worsen dyssynchrony and exacerbate LV failure
• Cardiac resynchronization therapy (biventricular pacing) may
reduce heart failure symptoms in patients with reduced LV function,
especially if they have wide QRS complexes
Insertion
• Relatively simple procedure, done while awake, which is usually
well tolerated by even very frail patients, with often dramatic
improvements in quality of life—consider in most where indicated
although such patients may need reassuring that it won’t prolong
their life or stop them dying
• Technical problems can occur with insertion if the patient cannot lie
still and ﬂat
• Usually straightforward, but rare complications during insertion
include arrhythmias (commonly AF) and rarely perforation of the
right ventricle
• Later problems include sepsis and failure of pacemaker output
• Regular follow-up is required to check the pacemaker function and
battery reserve

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Heart failure: assessment
Heart failure is very common, occurring in 1 in 10 of the >65s and
accounting for 5% of admissions to medical wards and 1–2% of all healthcare costs. Overall prevalence is 3–20 cases per 1000 population, but this
doubles with each decade after 45 years. Becoming more common as
population ages and survival from coronary events improves.

Pathology
• Poor LV function (systolic or diastolic) decreases cardiac output,
resulting in increased pulmonary pressures and oedema
• Sympathetic nervous system activated (increased pulse, myocardial
contractility, peripheral vasoconstriction, and catecholamines)
• Renin–angiotensin system activated (increases salt and water retention)
• Vasopressin and natriuretic peptides increase

Causes
Usually due to CHD (especially in Caucasians—CHD risk factors are
markers for heart failure) and hypertension (especially African Caribbeans).
Other causes include valve disease, arrhythmias, pericardial disease, pulmonary hypertension (eg with COPD or multiple pulmonary embolisms),
high output states (look especially for anaemia, thyroid disease and Paget’s
disease) and cardiomyopathy (check alcohol history).

Diagnosis
Heart failure is a complex clinical diagnosis, with no universally agreed diagnostic criteria. Often difﬁcult to diagnose accurately, particularly in older
patients with increased comorbidity and symptoms. Many older people are
put on a diuretic for presumed heart failure, but diuretic use as a marker
of heart failure is 73% sensitive but only 41% speciﬁc. This predisposes to
postural symptoms, and adds to polypharmacy.

Symptoms
Ask are these symptoms cardiac and what is the underlying disease causing
them? Exertional dyspnoea is 100% sensitive for heart failure (ie every case
has it), but only 17% speciﬁc (ie many other causes of exertional dyspnoea
exist—the main one being respiratory). Fatigue and ankle swelling are
also very common in heart failure but occur in many other diseases too.
Orthopnoea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea are much more speciﬁc,
but occurring late in the disease are not sensitive.

Signs
Again, early signs are sensitive, but not speciﬁc (eg tachycardia, pulmonary crepitations, peripheral oedema). Later signs are more speciﬁc,
but not sensitive (eg elevated JVP—98% speciﬁc, 17% sensitive; gallop
rhythm—99% speciﬁc and 24% sensitive)
2Overall, clinical features tend to be sensitive OR speciﬁc, but not both.
The multiple pathology of older patients poses a particular challenge in
diagnosis. Clinical suspicion should then be supported by investigation
before embarking on a trial of treatment.

HEART FAILURE: ASSESSMENT

HOW TO . . . Investigate a patient with suspected heart
failure
Use investigations to support a clinical diagnosis and establish cause.
• ECG—abnormal in over 90% of cases (Q waves, T wave/ST segment
changes, LVH, bundle branch block, AF). Consider Holter monitor if
paroxysmal symptoms
• CXR—look for cardiac enlargement (although this is absent with
acute onset eg post MI or PE), upper lobe blood diversion, ﬂuid in
the horizontal ﬁssure, Kerley B lines, bat wing pulmonary oedema,
pleural effusions (usually bilateral; R>L if unilateral), any other cause
for breathlessness
2Combination of a normal CXR and ECG makes heart failure very
unlikely indeed.
• Blood tests—FBC (? anaemic), biochemistry (? renal function,
sodium low in severe heart failure), glucose and lipids (CHD risk
factors), liver function (? congestion), thyroid function. BNP if
available (see Box 10.2)
• Echocardiography—echo should be done for all with suspected
heart failure (NICE guidelines) to help conﬁrm diagnosis, establish
cause and grade disease severity. Looks for LV function (systolic and
diastolic—see b ‘Diastolic heart failure’, p.296), estimates ejection
fraction, looks for evidence of valve disease, cardiomyopathy,
regional wall abnormalities from IHD, pericardial disease, intracardiac
shunts, LV aneurysms or cardiac thrombus. Open access echo
(ie direct GP referral) has improved the number of patients who
have an echo, but the results are only as good as the echo technician
and there can be problems with interpreting results (eg diastolic
problems). Overall, only 25% of those referred for echo have LV
systolic dysfunction
• Pulmonary function tests—may help distinguish cardiac from
respiratory breathlessness (peak expiratory ﬂow rate (PEFR) and
forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) reduced in heart
failure, but less than in COPD). Remember many patients have both

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Box 10.2 B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)
Three types of natriuretic peptide known, with effects on heart, kidneys
and the nervous system. B-type is found mainly in the heart and increases
with pressure overload of the heart, acting as a biochemical marker for
heart failure. BNP concentration correlates with the severity of heart
disease—very high levels carry a poor prognosis. In addition a negative
value makes a diagnosis of heart failure extremely unlikely (negative
predictive value of 96%).
Problems
• What is a high level? Different assays produce different numbers, and
there is a continuum of results making a diagnostic cut-off necessary
• What is the gold standard for diagnosis in order to evaluate the test?
(Echo has limitations)
• BNP level does not help distinguish systolic from diastolic heart
failure
• Drug treatment can affect levels, eg reduced by ACE inhibitors
• False positives can be caused by COPD, PE, age >70, diabetes, LVH,
previous MI, tachycardia, renal impairment, and liver cirrhosis
• Cost-effectiveness unknown
• Limited clinical trial evidence
• Signiﬁcance of a high level in an asymptomatic patient is unclear and
it is not currently recommended for screening
• Currently not widely available in the UK
2Overall, a ‘negative’ (ie very low) result in a breathless patient makes
heart failure very unlikely, and other causes should be sought. NICE
recommends measuring BNP in patients with suspected heart failure
without previous MI in order to help preselect patients for echocardiography and specialist review.

ACUTE HEART FAILURE

Acute heart failure
Treatment
• Immediate treatment with oxygen, intravenous loop diuretic, and
nitrates given iv or sublingually (if adequate BP), opiate, and antiemetic
• Address cause (eg acute MI, arrhythmia)
• Stop any exacerbating medications (NSAIDs, B-blockers)
• Consider thromboprophylaxis (eg low molecular weight heparin)
• Consider ventilatory support (begin with non-invasive positive pressure
ventilation which can be done in a non–ITU setting and does not
present problems of weaning)
• After improvement is seen begin to plan ongoing treatment—write up
regular loop diuretic and usually ACE on the drug chart and make plans
for further assessment
• Monitor electrolytes, BP, and weight

Prognosis
Patients with acute heart failure look extremely unwell yet can often
make apparently ‘miraculous’ recoveries as the precipitant is dealt with.
Remember that it is the pre-morbid state and the nature of the acute
injury, never age alone, that should determine how aggressively to manage
the acute condition.

Rapid AF and heart failure
A common combination in older patients
It is rarely clear which came ﬁrst
Treat both simultaneously
Digoxin may slow AF in this situation without depressing the
myocardium (may occur with amiodarone). Load 1mg of digoxin over
24hr in divided doses—eg 500 micrograms iv or po repeated at 12hr,
followed by the maintenance dose
• Always look for a precipitant—sepsis, MI, PE, etc.

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Chronic heart failure
2Begin by reviewing basis for diagnosis as it means a poor prognosis and a
commitment to a large number of medications.
A multidisciplinary approach is preferable, involving the patient in
monitoring where possible (eg daily weighing).
Best done by those with an interest, and with facilities for ongoing
follow-up, eg DHs (particularly suited to the frailer elderly), heart failure
clinics, by heart failure specialist nurses or GPs with special interest.

Lifestyle
Address cardiovascular risk actors, reduce alcohol intake, increase aerobic
exercise (ideally as part of a rehabilitation programme).

Medication
Large evidence base for a large number of drugs (see Box 10.3). It may
be tempting to limit the number of drugs in older patients, justiﬁed by
concerns about side effects, but if the diagnosis is secure then all classes
should be at least attempted. It is probably better to prescribe a low dose
of an ACE with a B-blocker, rather than a maximum dose of ACE when
the BP may be insufﬁcient to introduce the B-blocker.

Treating cause
• AF should be slowed and anticoagulation started (cardioversion
unlikely to succeed once LV dysfunction)
• Hypertension should be treated until disease progression drops cardiac
output and hence BP
• Valvular disease should be assessed for surgical correction where
appropriate (especially aortic valve disease—discuss with patient early
after onset of heart failure)
• Treat anaemia and thyroid disease

Vaccination
Offer inﬂuenza vaccination annually and pneumococcal vaccination (once
only).

Monitoring
Should include:
• Clinical assessment of symptoms and functional capacity (how far can
they walk without stopping etc.)
• Blood pressure, including postural measurements
• Fluid status (weigh regularly. Estimate dry weight, record it and use
this to titrate future management. Examine for JVP, oedema, and lung
crepitations)
• Cardiac rhythm (clinical and by ECG)
• Cognitive state (commonly impaired in heart failure due to vascular
disease and low BP)
• Nutritional state (malnutrition common in heart failure. Ask about
appetite, assess muscle bulk, check albumin—consider build-up drinks
or dietician input)

CHRONIC HEART FAILURE

• Medication review (are they on all appropriate drugs at maximum
tolerated doses?)
• Side effects (especially ask about postural symptoms, check UC+E)
• Psychological and social review, done by an MDT (how are they and
carers coping with problems of chronic disease? Do they need any
social support?)

Box 10.3 Medication for chronic heart failure
• Loop diuretics—(eg furosemide) Use to control symptoms. Begin
with 40mg (20mg in very elderly) and titrate upwards (guided by
symptoms and examination ﬁndings). Monitor renal function and
electrolytes
• ACE inhibitors—should be started early in all with a diagnosis of
systolic heart failure unless valvular cause, or renal artery stenosis
suspected. Again begin low (eg ramipril 2.5mg) and titrate upwards
monitoring renal function and postural symptoms
• B-blockers—should be started in all stable patients with LV systolic
dysfunction after diuretics and ACE inhibitors regardless of whether
there are continuing symptoms (improves prognosis). Use B-blocker
licensed for heart failure, eg carvedilol 3.125mg, bisoprolol 2.5mg,
and titrate upwards
• Spironolactone—use for continuing symptoms despite loop and ACE.
Dose 25mg. Watch potassium levels as ACE and spironolactone will
raise this
• Digoxin—use in AF, and where there are continuing symptoms
despite maximal other therapy in sinus rhythm
• Thiazide diuretics—can be added to loop diuretics in end-stage heart
failure, eg bendroﬂumethiazide 2.5mg, or metolazone 5mg (monitor
electrolytes closely; may be used on alternate days if causes excess
diuresis)
• Warfarin—use in AF, or where echo has shown intracardiac
thrombus
• ARBs—(eg candesartan) useful where ACE intolerant, this class
has beneﬁts in heart failure but its equivalence to ACE inhibition is
debated
• Aspirin/statins—use for risk factor modiﬁcation where cause is IHD

Dilemmas in heart failure
Terminal care
• Chronic heart failure is a grim diagnosis with a poor outlook (only 25%
will survive 3 years—worse than many cancers)
• Consider broaching this with all patients in clinic (ideally in a stable
phase of the illness) to allow future plans to be made and resuscitation
issues discussed. Monitoring of any cognitive impairment allows the
timing of this conversation to be carefully judged
• As the disease progresses ensure appropriate palliative care measures
are taken with careful review of symptoms and patient/family anxieties
• Consider hospice care if available
• Opiates (eg morphine sulphate solution 2.5–10mg) can be given to help
relieve the distress of dyspnoea and allow sleep
• Continuous oxygen therapy may ease discomfort
• Intermittent iv boluses of furosemide in DH can keep people out of
hospital

DILEMMAS IN HEART FAILURE

HOW TO . . . Manage the heart failure see-saw
One of the commonest dilemmas is balancing drugs in a patient with
both heart failure and chronic renal failure.
Aggressive diuretic use will improve the heart failure but lead to
thirst, malaise, hyponatraemia, uraemia, postural hypotension, and
ultimately anuria.
Hydrating to improve renal function will lead to worsening pulmonary oedema.
Each patient will need a carefully planned balance, accepting moderate
elevations in urea and/or a bit of oedema, which enables the patient to
exist in the greatest comfort. This balance will take time and skill to
achieve.
The following will help:
• Make all changes slowly and wait for impact—large dose changes
increase oscillation between wet and dry states
• If a patient is still losing weight on a treatment regimen, they are
likely to continue to do so—do not discharge after an acute event
until steady state is reached, otherwise they will bounce back into
hospital with dehydration and renal failure
• Get to know the ideal weight, and use this to guide therapy
• Involve patients and carers wherever possible
• Admit and stabilize in hospital
• Get to know the patient—continuity of care is very helpful, and
community heart failure nurses may play a key role in this

295

296

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Diastolic heart failure
• Clinical syndrome of heart failure with preserved LVEF seen on
echocardiography (>50%), where there is no major valvular disease
• Accounts for around a third of clinically diagnosed heart failure, and
is more common in older patients, especially women, hypertensive
patients, and those with LVH
• Not a benign condition—ambulatory patients do better than those with
systolic heart failure, but the mortality is equivalent in older patients
or hospitalized. Fourfold increase in mortality when compared with
controls without heart failure
2Important to recognize and treat, and not to discontinue heart failure
treatment on basis of normal LV function alone.

Pathology
Thick-walled LV with a small cavity. Slow to relax and allow ﬁlling in diastole, causing increased diastolic pressures (hence pulmonary pressures
and so dyspnoea) and a low cardiac output (hence fatigue).

Diagnosis
• Clinical suspicion (history as for systolic heart failure) and examination
ﬁndings (elevated JVP, pulmonary oedema, hypertension, murmur in
the aortic area, 4th heart sound), are key
• CXR will show pulmonary congestion, and the ECG evidence of
hypertension
• Echocardiography shows preserved LV function and in skilled hands
may show evidence of abnormal diastolic relaxation (Doppler studies
show a reduced ratio of early (E) to late or atrial (A) ventricular ﬁlling
velocities—E:A <0.5 is suggestive of diastolic dysfunction). However,
these changes are very common in older patients (E:A often <1) and it
is unclear as yet whether asymptomatic diastolic dysfunction warrants
treatment. Thus treatment is based on symptoms, not echo results
• BNP (see Box 10.2) may be useful in cases where there are multiple
possible aetiologies of dyspnoea as a negative result makes heart failure
unlikely, helping to limit polypharmacy

Management
• Prevention—by BP control at population level
• Relieve precipitants—treat arrhythmias, anaemia, thyroid disease,
ischaemia, malnutrition
• Acute symptoms—control BP with oral agents as priority. Use diuretics
cautiously as can drop cardiac output still further
• Chronic disease management—less evidence than for systolic heart
failure. Control of BP is key. Diastolic relaxation agents (eg B-blockade)
not proven but rate control with these especially where there is dual
indication, eg AF or IHD. Diuretics improve symptoms but ensure you
don’t dehydrate patients as these patients are vulnerable to reductions
in preload. ACE inhibitors and ARBs are likely to help. Improve
exercise tolerance with physical activity

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Valvular heart disease
The majority of valvular heart lesions in the UK are degenerative (eg senile
calciﬁcation is the main cause of aortic stenosis) so valve defects are very
common in older patients. The following must be remembered:
• Listen to the heart of all elderly people—many valve lesions are
detected incidentally
• Think of valvular disease when a patient presents with dyspnoea,
heart failure, angina, palpitations, syncope or dizziness. Examine them
carefully (see Table 10.5).
• When a murmur is heard, echocardiography should be requested in
order to document the valve lesion and formulate a management plan
• Following a review of evidence by NICE in 2008 antibiotic prophylaxis
is no longer recommended dental for invasive procedures
2Remember endocarditis if a murmur is heard in the context of an unexplained fever.

Surgical treatment
• Once the valve lesion is known, decide whether valve replacement is
indicated yet (see Table 10.5). In many lesions (eg mitral valve disease
and aortic regurgitation) the progression of symptoms alerts to the
need for pre-emptive surgery. In aortic stenosis however, a prompt
response to the development of early symptoms is required, and so the
approach is different
• Consider whether or not the patient is a surgical ‘candidate’.
Remember that many lesions are amenable to percutaneous
interventions which are feasible in much frailer patients
• Bioprosthetic (pig) valves can be used in older patients, which have a
shorter life span than metal valves, but obviate the need for warfarin
• If surgery is not yet indicated, then ensure there is some sort of callback/surveillance system in place—whether repeat echocardiography,
or clinic review, or simply ensuring that the patient knows what
symptoms should trigger medical review

Talking to patients about potential surgery
• Always ask the patient what they think—often there will be strong
views that come as a surprise to the physician. Many older people are
terriﬁed at the prospect, others are keen to proceed and others will
not want to decide—‘whatever you think, doctor’
• Make it clear that obtaining a surgical opinion is not committing the
patient to surgery, indeed the surgeon may feel that the risks outweigh
the beneﬁts, but that it is an important ﬁrst step
• Having a frank and useful discussion about risks and beneﬁts is often
difﬁcult, but should always be attempted before referral is made
• Ensure you have enough time and take it slowly, giving plenty of
opportunity for questions. They may wish to go away and think about
it, perhaps returning with a family member—encourage this and do not
force a decision

CHAPTER 10

Peripheral oedema
Swollen ankles are extremely common in older patients. As with all geriatric medicine, a careful assessment, diagnosis, and appropriate treatment
should be carried out.
2Swollen ankles do not always indicate heart failure—Starting a diuretic
must not be an immediate reaction as this treats only one of several
causes and may cause harm.

Causes
• Often, mild ankle swelling occurs in an otherwise ﬁt person—this
tends to be worse on prolonged standing and in the heat (sometimes
referred to as ‘dependant oedema’) It is likely that there is some minor
venous disease causing the oedema, but it is essentially benign
• Peripheral venous disease—chronic oedema due to damage to deep
veins causing venous hypertension, increased capillary pressure and
ﬁbrinogen leakage. Usually bilateral, but one side is often worse than
the other (see b ‘Chronic venous insufﬁciency’, p.592)
• Heart failure—usually bilateral. Look for associated signs, eg raised JVP,
cardiac enlargement, pulmonary crepitations, etc.
• Superﬁcial thrombophlebitis—acute oedema with a red, hot, very tender
venous cord with surrounding oedema
• DVT—acute onset painful swollen calf with pitting oedema of ankle.
Review thrombotic risk factors
2Always consider DVT with new onset unilateral swelling.
• Drug side effect—commonly calcium channel blockers (especially
amlodipine) and NSAIDs
• Low serum albumin—nephrotic syndrome, gastrointestinal loss,
malnutrition, chronic disease, acute sepsis etc
• Lymphatic obstruction—consider obstructing pelvic tumours. If oedema
is severe, perform rectal and groin examination
• Traumatic—after forcefully dorsiﬂexing the foot (usually when walking),
leading to rupture of the plantar tendon or injury to gastrocnemius.
This oedema tends to be unilateral, tender, above the ankle and with
associated bruising to the calf. Treat with rest and NSAIDs
• Other—eg hypothyroidism, osteoarthritis of the knee, ruptured Baker’s
cyst, poststroke paralysis

Assessment
• History—How acute was the onset? Is it unilateral or bilateral? Is it
painful, red and hot? What are the associated physical symptoms—
importantly dyspnoea (may indicate PE or heart failure)?
• Examination—Look for physical signs. Always listen to the heart
and lungs and look for sacral oedema when ankle swelling is found.
Consider rectal/groin examination
• Investigations—Be guided by your clinical suspicion. Consider ECG
(unlikely to be normal in heart failure), urea and electrolytes, albumin,
FBC, TFTs
2D-dimer in elderly patients with swollen ankles is rarely helpful. While
a negative result effectively rules out DVT, many elderly patients will have
an elevated d-dimer—only use the test if you would proceed to ultrasound scanning in the event of a positive result.

PERIPHERAL OEDEMA

Treatment
All patients with ankle swelling should have a careful assessment for
disease, with treatment dependant on cause:
• Stop drugs if they are responsible (consider replacing with alternatives)
• If heart failure, then full assessment and treatment is required
• For chronic venous disease use leg elevation and compression
bandaging or stockings (see b ‘Chronic venous insufﬁciency’, p.592)
• With severe lymphoedema, massage and pneumatic boots can be
useful. Consider referral to specialist lymphoedema clinics
• If low albumin, treat cause and increase dietary intake
If no disease is found then management is pragmatic. Patients may ﬁnd the
ankle swelling unsightly, have difﬁculty ﬁtting on their shoes or even complain of an aching pain. Support hosiery may help. Many patients may be
happy to tolerate the minor inconvenience once they have been assured
that there is no serious pathology.
It may then be appropriate to start a low dose of thiazide or loop
diuretic (eg bendroﬂumethiazide 2.5mg) but this will necessitate occasional
monitoring of electrolytes and clinical review to ensure the beneﬁts of
treatment still outweigh the risks.

Ankle swelling and nocturnal polyuria
• During the day, a large amount of ﬂuid can collect in the interstitial
space in the ankles
• At night, when the legs are elevated, this ﬂuid is partly returned to the
circulating volume and can cause a diuresis—hence nocturnal polyuria
• Paradoxically, treating such a patient with diuretics to limit the swelling
may ultimately help with the polyuria

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Preventing venous thromboembolism
in an older person
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), which incorporates DVT and PE is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients on both
medical and surgical wards. The UK Department of Health has recently
introduced national initiatives to reduce rates.

Recognition
• Older patients present atypically so diagnosis is often delayed
• They less frequently complain of pain and decreased ability to walk, and
their legs more commonly have asymmetrical swelling due to other
conditions, eg chronic venous insufﬁciency, arterial or joint disease, etc.

Prophylaxis
• Most hospitals now use a standardized risk assessment score/tool for
all patients
• Age >60 is known to be a risk factor for VTE, as is reduced mobility
compared to normal so almost all older patients will qualify for
prophylactic treatment unless risks of treatment (bleeding risk)
outweigh beneﬁts
• Contraindications are sometimes absolute (eg immediately after stroke,
haematemesis) but more commonly are relative (eg extensive bruising
after a fall) and the geriatrician must weigh risks and beneﬁts on a case
by case basis
• Aspirin is no longer considered effective VTE prophylaxis but patients
on aspirin for other reasons are at higher risk of some bleeding
complications (especially gastrointestinal) when low molecular weight
heparin is given

Review
• Reassessment is required every few days or when there is a material
change in the patient condition
• Patients who move into rehabilitation settings often regain mobility and
it is unclear from the evidence when prophylactic low molecular weight
is no longer required. Options include stopping at:
• Premorbid mobility level
• Steady state
• Discharge
Heparin injections should usually be stopped for patients receiving palliative care.

have an anticoagulant effect without need for intensive monitoring. The
number of licensed indications are growing and it is likely to play a major
role in VTE prevention and treatment in the near future.

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Peripheral vascular disease
Peripheral vascular disease is common in older patients—causing symptoms in 10% of those over 70 years.

Symptoms
• Only a third of older patients will have the classic symptoms of
intermittent claudication and often decreasing activity levels will mask
developing disease. It may be difﬁcult to distinguish the pain from that
of osteoarthritis
• Claudication pain may progress to ischaemic rest pain (night-time pain,
often relieved by hanging foot over bed), then to ulceration—due to
trauma with poor healing (small, punctate, painful ulcers at pressure
points, eg toes, lateral malleolus, metatarsal heads) and possibly
gangrene
• Around 80% of patients with claudication remain stable or improve;
only 20% deteriorate, and 6% require amputation (ongoing smokers
and diabetics are most at risk)

Examination
• Loss of pulses (best discriminator is an abnormality of the posterior
tibial pulse)
• Possibly bruits
• Coolness to touch
• Slow capillary reﬁll (over 2sec)
• Shiny hairless skin with atrophic nails and poor wound healing

Peripheral vascular disease as a marker of other vascular
disease
• 5-year mortality in peripheral vascular disease is 30%, mostly due to
cardiovascular disease
• It is easy to detect peripheral vascular disease non-invasively by
measuring the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI) (see b ‘HOW
TO . . . Measure ABPI’, p.305)
• The impact of broad vascular risk management on subsequent vascular
disease burden has yet to be quantiﬁed, but is likely to be substantial
2If a patient complains of leg pains, screen for peripheral vascular disease
and if detected initiate full vascular secondary prevention.

Management
Although very common, many elderly people will modify their lifestyle to
reduce symptoms. It is important to actively seek out symptoms.
Adopt the following treatment approach:
• Modify risk factors
• Advise increasing exercise (NOT decreasing)
• Commence antiplatelet agent—commonly aspirin; clopidogrel may
have slightly more efﬁcacy
• Consider other drugs—phosphodiesterase inhibitors (eg cilostazol)
have antiplatelet activity and act as vasodilators. The herbal remedy
Ginkgo biloba probably has no impact, but does no harm

PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE

• Do not necessarily stop B-blockers (traditionally thought to worsen
claudication). The evidence for this is weak and B-blockers have a
major role in modifying cardiac risk
• Refer for revascularization when appropriate. Percutaneous
revascularisation is relatively low risk and should be considered for
lifestyle-limiting claudication that does not respond to medical therapy,
where there is a focal stenosis or when there is limb-threatening
ischaemia in a patient who is not ﬁt for surgery. Elective surgery is
usually reserved for low-risk patients (under 70 years with no diabetes
and no distal disease) who are ﬁt enough to tolerate the procedure.
Age has a signiﬁcant impact on surgical risk—relative risk of mortality
increases by 1.62 with each decade

HOW TO . . . Measure ABPI
When?
• To conﬁrm peripheral vascular disease as a cause of claudication
• To diagnose vascular disease before implementing secondary
prevention
• To diagnose the aetiology of (venous) ulcers
• To ensure compression bandaging is safe
Equipment
• Blood pressure cuff with sphygmomanometer
• Hand-held Doppler probe
Method
• Inﬂate the cuff around the upper arm as usual and use the Doppler
probe over the brachial artery to measure the systolic blood
pressure
• Repeat in the other arm and use highest value
• Next inﬂate the cuff around the ankle and use the probe to measure
the systolic pressure in the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries
• Take the highest of the four ankle readings and divide by the higher
of the two arm readings to give the ABPI
Interpretation
• >1.3—non-compressible calciﬁed vessels; reading has limited value
• 1.0–1.3—normal range
• <0.9–angiographic peripheral vascular disease very likely
• 0.4–0.9—likely to be associated with claudication
• <0.4—advanced ischaemia

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Gangrene in peripheral vascular disease
The onset of gangrene is relatively common in people with severe peripheral vascular disease and causes considerable distress. It often poses
management difﬁculties, as many frail elderly are judged inappropriate for
open surgery.

Slowly progressive disease with dry gangrene
• Cyanotic anaesthetic tissue with necrosis
• Distal, with clear demarcation
• Often a low-grade inﬂammatory response (elevated white cell count
and CRP)
• The patient may feel unwell and anorexic
• Non-urgent surgical review is appropriate, but the approach is often to
allow auto-amputation—a lengthy and sometimes distressing process,
for patient and family. This may be managed as an outpatient
• Surgical amputation may be considered but as there is often inadequate
local circulation to allow healing, this may need to be extensive, or
combined with bypass (the latter carrying a signiﬁcant operative risk).
Sometimes amputation vastly improves the quality of life for a bedbound patient with gangrene. Discussion about possible amputation
should be approached with tact and sensitivity—patients are often
very against loss of a limb, even when they have not walked for years.
Ensure that the patient and family are aware of the rationale for
treatment, and that there is regular review of analgesia requirements

Wet gangrene
• Moist, swollen, and blistered skin—usually in people with diabetes
2This is a life-threatening condition and urgent surgical review is required,
in all but the most terminal of patients
• The usual approach to management is to start iv antibiotics prior to
debridement and amputation

Acute ischaemia
2This is a limb-threatening condition and demands urgent action
• Usually due to embolization
• Distal emboli cause so-called ‘blue toe syndrome’. The main object
of treatment is to prevent recurrence as little can be done to salvage
occluded small vessels. This may include angiography to establish the
source, and/or anticoagulation depending on the ﬁtness of the patient
• Proximal emboli cause diffuse acute ischaemia. Revascularization
of the limb is nearly always attempted (unless there is already
irreversible ischaemic changes) and the approach can be tailored to
the frailty of the patient—ranging from thrombolysis, percutaneous
thromboembolectomy (possible under local anaesthesia) to emergency
bypass procedures

CHAPTER 10

Cardiovascular

Vascular secondary prevention (Table 10.7)
Atheromatous vascular disease (cardiac, peripheral vascular, and cerebral)
accounts for a huge amount of morbidity, mortality, and expenditure.
Secondary prevention measures evolve continually as individual clinical
trials reach completion. Although some interventions are primarily
applied to a speciﬁc pathology, most impact on all vascular systems. The
cumulative effect of therapies is not yet known, but the consensus is that
they will substantially reduce the burden of future vascular events.
Traditionally, older patients have been under-provided with secondary
prevention measures, for a number of reasons:
• There is often polypharmacy, and reluctance among patients and
healthcare professionals to add to this
• It was thought that secondary prevention beneﬁts were seen only with
long-term (perhaps 5–10 years) treatment. Unless life expectancy was
greater than this, therapy was not begun
• It may be ‘shutting the door after the horse has bolted’—the damage
has already been done
But consider several contrary points:
• Recent evidence suggests that some therapies (statins and ACE
inhibitors) act quickly, possibly due to endovascular stabilization
• Although older patients are under-represented in clinical trials, where
older patients have been included (eg the Heart Protection Study) the
beneﬁts have been equal, if not greater than in younger patients
• Do not assume that a disabled person will not beneﬁt from prevention
of further events. In a bed-bound stroke patient who has to be spoonfed a further stroke that removes swallowing ability altogether may
deprive that person of their only pleasure in life
• As with much of geriatric medicine, frank discussion with the patient is
advised. Many patients will have strong views and fall into one of two
groups—the fatalists, who prefer not to take medication ‘just in case’,
and the ‘belt-and-braces’ patients who welcome all possible measures
• Drug doses are determined by clinical trial evidence—often a high
dose in generally robust patients. Adopt a pragmatic approach in frail
patients, with lower doses as these may be effective with fewer side
effects
• Reduce doses of renally cleared medication with low GFR
We do not advocate the blind prescription of all secondary prevention to
all of older patients—such an approach would be clinically inappropriate
for some and unlikely to be cost-effective. What we do suggest is that
each patient is considered on a case-to-case basis and, where possible,
included in the discussion to reach an individually tailored action plan.

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

The ageing lung
Most of the functional impairment of the lungs that is seen in older people
is due to disease, often smoking-related. Intrinsic ageing leads only to mild
functional deterioration. The respiratory system has a capacity well in
excess of that required for normal activity, so intrinsic ageing:
• Does not lead to symptoms in the non-smoker without respiratory
disease
• In those with respiratory disease (eg emphysema) will cause
progressively worsening symptoms with age even if the disease itself
remains stable
• In acute disease, eg pneumonia, may cause earlier decompensation or
a more severe presentation

Speciﬁc respiratory changes
Seen in healthy older people are similar to those seen in mild chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, and include:
• Decreased elastic recoil causing small airways to collapse at low lung
volumes and increased residual volume
• Increased chest wall stiffness, due to:
• Degenerative change in intercostal, intervertebral and
costovertebral joints
• Osteoporosis and kyphoscoliosis
• Weaker respiratory muscles that may have lower endurance
• Reduced gas exchange and increased ventilation-perfusion (V/Q)
mismatch, due to collapse of peripheral airways while perfusion
remains intact
• Impaired chemoreceptor function, leading to lessened ventilatory
response to decreased PaO2 or increased PaCO2
• Impaired microbial defence mechanisms. Less effective mucociliary
clearance and less sensitive cough reﬂex

Observed consequences of these changes
These include:
• Increased susceptibility to infection (underventilation of and inability to
clear sputum from dependent lung zones)
• Lower maximum minute ventilation (weaker musculature acting against
a stiffer chest)
• An approximately linear fall in PaO2 with age (70.3%/year). Since
alveolar oxygen tension remains stable, the alveolar-arterial (A-a)
oxygen gradient rises
• Reduced exercise capacity. However, oxygen consumption and cardiac
output decline in proportion to lung function, so the lungs are rarely
the limiting factor in exercise performance

THE AGEING LUNG

Breathlessness in older people is often multifactorial
• Chronic breathlessness in an individual may be the result of, eg,
decreased ﬁtness, obesity, an inefﬁcient gait (osteoarthritis or stroke),
kyphosis, previous lung damage (eg apical ﬁbrosis due to tuberculosis
(TB)) and intrinsic ageing. In this example, note that only one of the
factors is speciﬁc to the lung
• In the acutely breathless patient, pathologies commonly coexist,
eg infection, fast AF, and heart failure. The classic treatment triad
of digoxin, furosemide, and amoxicillin is not a sign of diagnostic
indecision but is often entirely appropriate treatment

313

314

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Respiratory infections
Cough with or without sputum, shortness of breath, fever or chest pain is
a very common presentation in older patients. It is very important to try
to distinguish which part of the airway is primarily affected because this
implies completely different pathogens, prognoses, and treatment strategies. Try to avoid aggregating all such patients together using the imprecise term ‘chest infection’.

Upper respiratory tract infections
These are caused by viruses, eg rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus,
inﬂuenza, and parainﬂuenza. Symptoms include nasal discharge and congestion, fever, and sore throat. These may extend to the lower tract and
then include cough, wheeze, sputum production, or worsening of existing
cardiopulmonary disease.
With increasing age:
• Upper respiratory tract infection becomes less frequent, but more
severe
• The risk of complications increases. These include:
• Lower tract infection such as bronchitis or pneumonia, which may
be bacterial or viral
• Bronchospasm
• Extrapulmonary manifestations such as falls, immobility, and delirium
• Postinfection weakness, fatigue, and anorexia is more severe and
prolonged, maybe lasting several weeks
• Frequency of hospital admission and death increases substantially

Acute bronchitis
Occurs with inﬂammation of the bronchial tree with little or no involvement of lung parenchyma (which is pneumonia). Is commoner in those
with chronic airways disease (see b ‘Asthma and COPD: assessment’,
p.342).
Compared with pneumonia, bronchitis:
• Has fewer systemic features and a better prognosis
• Has no chest symptoms and signs, eg pleuritic pain or crepitations, but
may have prominent cough and wheeze
• CXR not routinely indicated
• Can be managed less aggressively, with more reliance on supportive
treatment and bronchodilators than antibiotics. Often viral in origin,
if an antibacterial is thought appropriate, give amoxicillin to cover
Streptococcus pneumoniae (erythromycin or clarithromycin if penicillin
sensitive)

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Inﬂuenza
This is the most serious viral respiratory tract infection, and is often
a severe, systemic illness with pulmonary bacterial superinfection
(Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus inﬂuenzae, Strep. pneumoniae). It
occurs most commonly in December-February. Antigenic shifts result in
periodic pandemics (large-scale epidemics).
Presentation is similar in young and old, ie rapid onset of fever (rigors,
chills), myalgia, headache, and fatigue with variable degrees of prostration.
Compared with less threatening viruses such as rhinovirus:
• Nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, high fever, rigors and ocular symptoms
(eg photophobia) are more common
• Rhinorrhoea is less common
Less common serious complications include myocarditis and
meningoencephalitis. Mild meningism is common, and if combined with
other sinister features (eg altered conscious level) is an indication for CSF
sampling.
Diagnosis is usually based on combining clinical assessment with
epidemiological data, particularly current inﬂuenza incidence. Some other
viruses can cause an identical clinical syndrome, and serological test
results are not immediately available. Thus an initial assessment cannot
produce an absolutely conﬁdent microbiological diagnosis. The syndrome
may therefore most precisely be labelled ‘inﬂuenza-like illness’.
Positive virological diagnosis in the context of increased community
incidence or a care home outbreak is helpful by prompting vigorous
attempts to reduce transmission of infection.

Reducing viral transmission
Mass outbreaks of respiratory viral infection are common in care homes
and hospitals. They can occur at any time of year but are commonest
from autumn to spring, Viruses are spread by aerosol or hand-to-hand
contact (sometimes indirect, via fomites such as cutlery or drinking
vessels).
During an outbreak
• Reduce transfers of healthy patients into, or symptomatic patients
out of, the affected area
• Reduce staff movement across work areas (especially applicable to
short-term staff who may work in many clinical areas in a short time)
• Care for symptomatic patients in single rooms, or in ward bays with
similarly infected patients
• Exclude visitors with respiratory or viral symptoms from the ward
• Ensure that care staff have been immunized against inﬂuenza
• Ensure that scrupulous hand-washing procedures are followed
• Consider using face masks for staff caring for symptomatic patients

INFLUENZA

HOW TO . . . Treat inﬂuenza-like illness in older people
The following guidance is generic, and should be tailored to the patient,
their illness, and their care environment. If the highest quality care
cannot be provided, then a prompt step-up of care should be arranged.
This may include hospital admission.
• Do not underestimate the disease. Mortality and morbidity increases
exponentially with age and frailty
• Give excellent supportive and symptomatic care. Its effectiveness
should not be underestimated
• Fluids. Reduced intake and increased losses (fever) lead to volume
depletion and end organ dysfunction. Encourage frequent oral
ﬂuid and suspend any diuretic treatment. Consider early initiation
of s/c or iv ﬂuids if a vicious spiral of dehydration and poor intake
seems likely to ensue
• Nutrition. Encourage high-calorie, high-protein drinks or solids.
If the illness is especially severe, prolonged, or complicated, or if
the patient is especially frail or malnourished, consider a period of
NG feeding. Involve a dietician early
• Paracetamol. If fever, discomfort, or pain occur
• Maintain mobility. Bed rest may sentence the patient to death or
dependency. Carers may need clear, ﬁrm advice about this
• Identify and treat complications promptly
• Carers may need information about important warning signs and
the need to seek prompt medical advice
• Perform regular observations of BP, pulse, and temperature
where possible
• Common serious complications include delirium, secondary
bacterial infection, bronchospasm, pressure sores, and circulatory
collapse
• Antiviral agents (the neuraminidase inhibitors zanamivir and
oseltamivir) can reduce both the severity and duration of inﬂuenza
• They are indicated in patients >65 years who have an inﬂuenzalike illness during a period of high community incidence, provided
they present early (<48hr)
• They are well tolerated, reduce symptom severity and duration
and they may reduce mortality
• Zanamivir is inhaled, oseltamivir is taken orally

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Pneumonia
Pneumonia
• This is a syndrome of acute respiratory infection with shadowing on
CXR
• May be primarily lobar, bronchial or mixed pattern
• Symptoms may be mild and are often non-organ speciﬁc eg fever,
malaise
• Common presenting scenarios include cough (often unproductive),
delirium, reduced conscious level, lethargy, anorexia, falls, immobility
and dizziness. Rarely patients can present with shock, coma and adult
respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
• Chest pain, dyspnoea and high fever are less common than in younger
people. Signs may be minimal:
• The patient may be well or unwell. Assess severity using the CURB
criteria (see b ‘Characteristics of severe pneumonia: the CURB-65
score’, p.320)
• Fever is often absent, but vasodilatation is common
• Tachypnoea is a sensitive sign, as is at least moderate hypoxaemia
(d95% on air) on oximetry
• Tests often guide management
• Chest radiograph often reveals minimal infective inﬁltrate.
Associated problems can include malignancy, effusion, or heart
failure
• Blood cultures should be sent, but sputum culture is rarely useful
unless TB is suspected
• White cell count may be raised, normal, or even depressed
• CRP is often normal early in the illness. A very high CRP suggests
pneumococcal disease or severe sepsis of any cause
• U,C+E guide ﬂuid management. Renal impairment is a sign of poor
prognosis
• Arterial blood gas (ABG) sampling is not usually necessary, unless
oxygen saturations are <90%; oximetry is much better tolerated and
usually sufﬁcient to guide oxygen therapy
• Organisms (see Table 11.1)
• Often no causative organism is identiﬁed
• Pneumococcus is a common pathogen in all settings, including
hospital
• Viral pneumonia, especially inﬂuenza, is under-recognized, and is the
second most common cause of community-acquired pneumonia
• Legionella and Mycoplasma pneumonias are uncommon.
Mycoplasma is much more frequent during epidemics, occurring
every 3 years or so
• Unusual organisms are more common in frail patients, in higher
dependency environments and in those who have recently received
courses of antibiotics. These organisms include Gram negatives
(which colonize the oropharynx) and anaerobes (a result of
aspiration of gut contents). MRSA pneumonia and septicaemia is an
increasing problem and may be contracted in the community, ie not
just a hospital problem

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Pneumonia: treatment
Treatment is much more than antimicrobials alone:
• Assess and optimize ﬂuid volume status; give oral, s/c, or iv ﬂuid
as appropriate. Concurrent heart failure is common, but volume
depletion more so
• If there is subjective dyspnoea or moderate/severe hypoxaemia,
then supplement oxygen, titrating the inspired oxygen concentration
upwards to achieve arterial oxygen saturations >90% (see b ‘Oxygen
therapy’, p.348). For lesser degrees of hypoxaemia, it is not necessary
to subject patients to claustrophobic, uncomfortable oxygen masks:
simply monitoring saturations may be sufﬁcient
• Exercise caution in COPD: observe the patient closely, both
clinically and with serial ABG sampling
• Avoid the use of nasal specs acutely: if ventilatory drive is poor,
inspired oxygen concentrations are very uncontrolled
• Encourage mobility. If immobile, sit upright in bed, and sit out in a chair
• Request physiotherapy if there is a poor cough, or lobar/lung collapse
• Use saline nebulizers to loosen secretions which are difﬁcult to
expectorate and bronchodilator nebulizers when wheeze suggests
associated bronchoconstriction
• Minimize risk of thromboembolism unless contraindicated through
prophylactic heparin, early mobilization, and compression stockings
• Assess pressure sore risk and act accordingly (see b ‘Pressure sores’,
p.502)
• If dyspnoea, anxiety or pain is very distressing, consider opiates. Side
effects include respiratory depression, sedation and delirium, so begin
with small doses and assess effect
• Anticipate possible deterioration, and judge in advance the appropriate
levels of intervention. Would renal dialysis, ventilation and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation be effective and appropriate? (See b ‘Diagnosing
dying and estimating when treatment is without hope’, p.666)
• Keep the family informed. Where possible, enlist their help, eg in
encouraging eating and drinking

Characteristics of severe pneumonia: the CURB-65 score
Five key criteria (acronym ‘CURB-65’) determine prognosis:
• Confusion (AMTS d8)
• Urea (serum urea >7mmol/L)
• Respiratory rate (t30/min)
• Blood pressure (<90 systolic and/or d60mmHg diastolic)
• 65 years of age or more
The score has a six point scale (0–5 adverse prognostic features):
• 0 or 1: Low risk of death (0–3%). Possibility of home treatment (but
consider other factors, eg functional status, hypoxaemia
• 2: Intermediate risk of death (13%). Hospital treatment is indicated
• 3, 4, or 5: Severe pneumonia, with high risk of death (score 3:
mortality 17%, 4: 41%, 5: 57%). Consider intensive care admission.
A ﬁve-point scale using only four criteria (CRB-65; urea excluded) can
be applied outside hospital and also discriminates effectively between
good and poor prognoses (eg mortality score 1: 5%, score 3: 33%).

PNEUMONIA: TREATMENT

Antimicrobials
Refer to local guidelines, reﬂecting pathogen sensitivities, and drug costs.
Community or care home settings
• Amoxicillin orally is usually effective (vs. Strep. pneumoniae and
H. inﬂuenzae). Erythromycin or clarithromycin if penicillin-allergic
• Add clarithromycin (or erythromycin which has more gastric
side effects) if there are features of atypical pneumonia, there is a
Mycoplasma epidemic, or the patient may have had inﬂuenza
• Co-amoxiclav orally has added activity against some Gram-negatives
and Staph. aureus, and may be more effective in the frail patient or
where aspiration is likely
• Ciproﬂoxacin alone should be used rarely—it has Gram negative
activity, but is less effective against Strep. pneumoniae, an important
pathogen in most settings. If an antimicrobial is sought that will cover
both chest and urinary sepsis, a better choice may be co-amoxiclav or
trimethoprim
• iv antibiotics are only necessary if the patient is very unwell (CURB-65
score of 3 or above) or unable to swallow. Co-administration
of cefuroxime and erythromycin is a good choice in the unwell
patient, treating all likely pathogens effectively. If you suspect MRSA
pneumonia, add vancomycin. Convert to oral therapy and change
broad to narrower spectrum drugs when the patient’s condition
improves and/or culture results are known to minimize complications,
eg CDAD (see b ‘Clostridium difﬁcile-associated diarrhoea’, p.614).
Often, only 48hr or less of broad spectrum, iv therapy is needed
Hospital-acquired infection
This presents a difﬁcult dilemma. Hospitalized patients, especially those
who are more frail and have spent longer in hospital, are prone to Gramnegative and anaerobic pulmonary infections. However, they are also susceptible to the adverse effects (especially diarrhoea) of broad spectrum
antimicrobials.
A hierarchical approach is sensible, considering likely pathogens and
illness severity;
• In the less frail patient who remains well, begin amoxicillin alone,
co-amoxiclav or a combination of amoxicillin and ciproﬂoxacin (all po).
Broaden the spectrum only if the patient deteriorates or culture results
suggest that the likely pathogen is insensitive
• If a patient is at high risk of Gram-negative infection (frail, dependency,
prolonged stay, invasive procedures, aspiration risk), begin with iv
cefuroxime (or equivalent). Narrow the antimicrobial spectrum when
the patient’s condition improves and/or a pathogen is identiﬁed
• If the patient has received multiple courses of treatment, seek
microbiology advice
• In all cases take blood cultures, and monitor the patient carefully

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

HOW TO . . . Manage the patient with pneumonia who
fails to respond to treatment
Is the diagnosis correct?
• Consider other chest pathology such as heart failure, pulmonary
embolism, pleural effusion, empyema, cancer or cryptogenic
organising pneumonia. Extrathoracic pathology mimicking pneumonia
includes acidosis (tachypnoea), and biliary or pancreatic pathology
• Review the history, examination and investigations
• Consider admission to hospital and further tests
Is there a complication?
For example effusion, empyema, heart failure, silent myocardial
infarction or pulmonary embolism
Is the antibiotic being taken regularly and in adequate dose?
• Is concordance a problem? Could a friend or relative help prompt
tablet-taking, or would a dosette box help?
• Syrups may be swallowed more easily than tablets. An experienced
nurse can help where there are swallowing difﬁculties
• If swallowing remains ineffective, or drug absorption in doubt
(eg vomiting) then consider iv therapy
Is the organism resistant?
• Take more blood cultures
• Consider a change in antimicrobial, taking into account likely
pathogens and their known sensitivities
• Consider atypical infection; send urine for Legionella antigen test,
especially if the patient is immunocompromised or if a patient
appears disproportionately unwell. Remember MRSA pneumonia
especially in those known to be previously colonized
Could other elements of care be more effective?
For example: ﬂuid balance, oxygenation, nutrition, posture, and chest
physiotherapy.
Is this an end-of-life situation?
• Is treatment to extend life now inappropriate, the failure to
respond a sign that the diagnosis is of ‘dying’ (see b ‘Diagnosing
dying and estimating when is treatment without hope’, p.666)? If the
patient cannot tell you their wishes, determine their likely views
by discussing with family and friends, a decision informed by your
judgement of where in their life trajectory your patient sits
• In determining prognosis consider comorbidity—is this an abrupt,
potentially reversible illness in an otherwise ﬁt person, or a further
lurch downhill for a patient with multiorgan failure.Not for nothing is
pneumonia referred to as ‘the old man’s friend’, sometimes bringing
to a brisk and welcome end a period of irrevocable decline and
suffering

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Vaccinating against pneumonia and
inﬂuenza
Vaccine delivery
• Both vaccines should be offered simultaneously in October or early
November to all aged >65 years, especially:
• The frail
• Care home residents
• The immunosuppressed
• Those with comorbidity, eg heart failure, COPD
• Reliable delivery of these vaccinations depends upon effective
information management systems in general practice, and substantial
efforts by patients, carers, district nurses, and GP nurses
• A common reason to have missed immunization is to have been a
long-term inpatient (eg undergoing rehabilitation) during the autumn
immunization period. Hospitals should ensure that these inpatients are
immunized
• Vaccinating healthcare workers, especially those working in long-term
care settings, reduces the spread of infection and therefore death due
to inﬂuenza among patients

Pneumococcal vaccine
• Pneumovax® II, a multivalent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine, is
effective against 65% of serotypes
• Immunity remains for at least ﬁve years, perhaps for life
• Bacteraemia is reduced by at least 50%. The effect on incidence of
pneumonia itself is less clear

Inﬂuenza vaccine
• The trivalent vaccine is prepared from currently prevalent serotypes
• Immunity develops in <2 weeks, and it is therefore useful during
epidemics
• Immunity remains for up to 8 months
• The risk of pneumonia, hospitalization, or death due to inﬂuenza is
reduced by over half

Postexposure antiviral prophylaxis
• Pharmacological prophylaxis of inﬂuenza is currently recommended
when an unimmunized, high-risk group adult (eg care home resident)
has had close contact with a person with inﬂuenza-like illness during a
period when ﬂu is prevalent (NICE 2008)
• Treatment with neuraminidase inhibitors must be initiated within 24hr
(for oseltamivir) or 24hr (for zanamivir) (see b ‘Upper respiratory
tract infections’, p.314)
• Consider why immunization was not performed. Is it too late to
administer this year (this contact may not have ‘ﬂu, but the next one
might)? If not, then optimize the chances of immunization next year

PULMONARY FIBROSIS

Pulmonary ﬁbrosis
This common problem is much underdiagnosed in older people due to
a combination of under-investigation and overlap of clinical signs with
common pathologies such as heart failure.
Consider when breathlessness coexists with profuse ﬁne chest
crepitations, with or without clubbing. On CXR, there may be bilateral
pulmonary shadowing consistent with pulmonary oedema, but with little
supporting evidence (eg normal heart size, absent Kerley B lines).

Causes
• Idiopathic. The most common type in older people, known as usual
interstitial pneumonia
• Connective tissue disease, eg rheumatoid arthritis (most common),
systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis. Lung involvement is
sometimes the ﬁrst manifestation of the multisystem disease
• Drugs, eg amiodarone, nitrofurantoin rarely
• Occupational exposure, eg asbestos, silica
• If localized, consider TB, bronchiectasis, and radiotherapy

Tests
• The diagnosis is usually conﬁrmed by high-resolution CT scanning,
which can also help distinguish subgroups likely to respond to
immunosuppressive treatment
• Respiratory function tests may be useful (a restrictive picture with
decreased transfer factor is usual) but typically adds little in the frail
older person
• Refer to a respiratory physician to conﬁrm diagnosis and guidance on
management

Prognosis
This is very variable—about a third are clinically stable, a third improve
and a third deteriorate at rates that vary greatly between individuals.
Some can live with pulmonary ﬁbrosis for years without signiﬁcant
functional impairment.

Treatment
• Treat or remove any underlying cause, eg drugs
• A minority respond slowly (over weeks) to immunosuppression
(eg prednisolone and azathioprine). Monitor closely for side effects.
In non-responders, tail off and stop. In responders, reduce dose
cautiously. Ensure bone protection with calcium, vitamin D, and
bisphosphonates
• Home oxygen therapy is often useful
• Give opiates for distressing dyspnoea
• In those in whom dyspnoea progresses, consider end-of-life
issues including treatment limitation, and a change of focus from
life-extending measures to a purely palliative approach

325

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Rib fractures
Common in older people.
• Often a result of falls or even minimal bony stress such as coughing in a
person with osteoporosis
• Consider the possible contribution of alcohol, which causes both falls
and osteoporosis

Diagnosis
Rib fractures should be diagnosed clinically.
• Point tenderness and crepitus are often found
• Pressure over the sternum may provoke the pain in a lateral rib
• CXR, even with multiple projections, may miss the fracture, but is
useful in excluding early complications such as pneumo- or haemothorax
• Radioisotope bone scans are very sensitive but not speciﬁc (hot spots
are often found without clinical fracture) so they are rarely indicated

Management
Rib fractures heal without speciﬁc treatment. The major problem is pain,
which commonly leads to voluntary splinting of the injured area. There is
hypoventilation and a failure to clear secretions, and secondary pulmonary infection can occur.
• The patient should be encouraged to breathe deeply and to cough.
Supporting the injured area when coughing, using a small pillow,
minimizes pain. Strapping of the affected area is no longer done, as it
increases complication rates
• Regular analgesia should include paracetamol, plus a weak opiate in
most cases. A short course of NSAIDs may be helpful
• Admit to hospital if pain is severe and the patient unable to cough, or if
complications (usually infection) have occurred
• In cases of severe pain (eg multiple fractures), consider strong opiates
or intercostal/paravertebral blocks. Involve the local pain team
Reassure the patient that the injury itself is not severe, will heal without
immobilization and that coughing will prevent complications, not cause
further damage.

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Pleural effusions
A frequent (clinical or radiological) ﬁnding, sometimes incidental.
Common causes are heart failure, post-pneumonia, PE, and malignancy
(especially lung primary, mesothelioma, leukaemia, lymphoma, and metastatic adenocarcinoma (ovary, stomach)).
The differential diagnosis is wide, but narrowed when the results of
CXR and pleural ﬂuid aspiration are known (Table 11.2).
Table 11.2 Differentiating cause, by protein level
Transudate (protein <25g/L)

Exudate (protein >35g/L)

Heart failure

Malignancy

Hepatic cirrhosis

Infection, including TB

Hypoproteinaemia,

Gastrointestinal causes,

eg malabsorption, sepsis

eg pancreatitis

Nephrotic syndrome

Multisystem disorders, eg rheumatoid

(Exudative causes if low serum protein)

(Heart failure after diuresis)

• Empyemas, malignancy, and TB produce exudates with low pH (<7.2),
low glucose (<3.3mmol/L) but high lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)
• Transudates are usually not due to focal lung pathology, and so usually
affect both lungs. Unilateral effusions due to transudates occasionally
do occur, more commonly on the right side
• Effusions due to heart failure are typically small and bilateral, with
cardiomegaly; they can be unilateral, but usually a tiny contralateral
effusion is seen, manifesting as blunting of the costophrenic angle; if the
angle remains sharp, other causes are more likely
• A massive unilateral effusion is usually due to malignancy
• A uniformly bloodstained effusion is usually due to infection, embolism,
malignancy or trauma

Chronic effusions
• If bilateral transudates, should be treated as for heart failure
• If the diagnosis is not clear after CXR and aspiration consider chest
physician referral and tests including CT, pleural biopsy (CT-guided
rather than blind), video-assisted thoracoscopy with biopsy (VATS),
and echocardiogram
• For large, recurrent effusions, consider chest physician referral for
continuous outpatient external ﬂuid drainage via a semipermanent
intrapleural (‘Pleuryx’) catheter
• Frail patients may not tolerate, or desire, the more invasive tests. In this
case, consider:
• Repeated aspiration, combining diagnostic with therapeutic taps and
sending larger volumes of ﬂuid for cytology and acid-fast bacillus culture
• ‘Watching and waiting’, with regular clinical review
• A trial of diuretics, especially if the effusion is a transudate

PLEURAL EFFUSIONS

HOW TO . . . Aspirate a sample of pleural ﬂuid
Although aspiration is increasingly conducted under ultrasound guidance it remains a safe procedure in selected patients (compliant with
good sized effusions) without ultrasound guidance. Simple aspiration
in an outpatient or community setting remains a useful tool for the
geriatrician:
1. Sit the patient leaning forwards and resting comfortably. Make
yourself comfortable
2. Clinically identify the effusion (review the CXR; percuss to ﬁnd
maximum dullness)
3. Using permanent ink, mark this point
4. Clean and disinfect the skin. Attach a green hub (21-gauge) needle
to a 10mL syringe
5. Using aseptic technique, insert the needle close to the marked point,
but above a rib in order to avoid the neurovascular bundle
6. Advance slowly, applying moderate suction to the syringe, until the
pleural space is entered and ﬂuid ﬂows
If a larger volume of aspirate is needed, swap to a larger syringe, holding
the needle quite still.
Ultrasound detects small effusions (50–100mL) and aids diagnostic
aspiration in patients with a small effusion.
Tests on the aspirate should usually include microscopy/culture,
cytology, protein, LDH, glucose, and pH. If tuberculosis or cancer is
suspected, then send larger volumes (eg 50mL) to microbiology and
cytology, respectively.

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Pulmonary embolism
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is common, yet as ‘the great pretender’ (of
other pathology), is underdiagnosed and underreported on death certiﬁcates. It commonly coexists with and is confused with other lung disease
eg pneumonia, heart failure and COPD—and is a common cause of deterioration in such patients.

Presentation
The classic symptom triad of pain, dyspnoea and haemoptysis is seen less
commonly in older people.
Common presentations include:
• Brief paroxysm(s) of breathlessness, or tachypnoea
• Collapse, cardiac arrest, syncope, presyncope, or hypotension
• Pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure, presenting as chronic
unexplained breathlessness
• Puzzling signs eg fever, wheeze, resistant heart failure, arrhythmia,
confusion, or functional decline

Investigations
Determining the likelihood of PE rests on combining clinical judgement
(the product of history, examination, and immediately available tests such
as CXR) with appropriate imaging such as V/Q scan or CT pulmonary
angiogram (CTPA). The common clinical features of PE—tachypnoea,
tachycardia, and modest degrees of hypoxaemia—are common in ill older
people, so clinical judgement alone is rarely enough.
Moreover, a conﬁdent diagnosis is essential because in older people:
• The risk of anticoagulation is higher
• The risk of a missed diagnosis is higher (less physiological reserve)
Possible PE in older people should be investigated in the usual way, with
the choice of tests guided by local facilities and expertise. The following
issues are especially relevant:
• In a patient without known lung disease, the combination of
breathlessness and a CXR showing clear lung ﬁelds strongly suggests
PE. Further test(s) (V/Q or CTPA) are indicated
• CXR abnormalities may be minor (atelectasis, raised hemidiaphragm,
small effusions), or major (usually reﬂecting comorbid conditions
rather than PE itself). Classical wedge shadows or unilateral oligaemia
are rare
• PE in the absence of lower limb deep vein thrombosis is common
(10–20% of cases), so do not be put off by an absence of clinical signs of
the leg, or a negative Doppler ultrasound
• D-dimer can be a useful screening test to rule out PE but because many
older people have coexisting conditions, eg infection false positives are
very common (ie sensitivity high, speciﬁcity low)
• Arterial blood gases have some value in diagnosis, but the common
abnormalities (low PaO2, low PaCO2, and increased alveolar-arterial
(A-a) oxygen gradient) are neither sensitive nor speciﬁc
• In healthy older people, an increased A-a gradient is common
• In older people following PE, a normal A-a gradient is seen in >10%

PULMONARY EMBOLISM

• Echocardiogram may be normal following PE. However, in a patient
with a high clinical probability, typical features of PE on echocardiogram
usually provide sufﬁcient diagnostic conﬁdence to permit
anticoagulation without further imaging
• In the patient with unexplained right heart failure, consider PE:
obtain an ECG and echocardiogram (ask for PA pressures) and
request imaging that details the lung parenchyma (high-resolution
CT: pulmonary ﬁbrosis?) and the vasculature (CTPA: pulmonary
embolism?)
• In the patient who does not respond to treatment for chest infection,
heart failure or acute exacerbation of COPD, consider whether PE
may be responsible

Treatment
Anticoagulation
Standard treatment is low molecular weight heparin (eg dalteparin, enoxaparin) followed by warfarin with goal INR 2–3. Once the possibility of PE
is raised, it is essential to treat with low molecular weight heparin pending
investigation results, unless there are particular treatment risks.
To minimize bleeding risk:
• Anticoagulate with caution. Check baseline clotting. Give 5mg (not
10mg) warfarin dose on day 1 (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Initiate warfarin’,
p.146)
• Beware the older patient with mild anaemia or a low MCV—do they
have occult blood loss?
• In the very frail, sick, unstable patient in whom anticoagulation
with warfarin would present signiﬁcant risk, consider a period of
anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin. Start warfarin when
clinical stability returns
Thrombolysis
Consider thrombolysing, balancing risks and beneﬁts, where there is
life-threatening PE, manifesting as acute right heart strain and systemic
hypotension. Both risk and beneﬁt increase with age, so age itself is not
a contraindication.
Inferior vena cava (IVC) ﬁlter
An IVC ﬁlter (‘Greenﬁeld ﬁlter’) can be inserted under local anaesthesia
by an interventional radiologist. Most cannot be removed once in situ but
some of the newer ones are potentially retrievable.
Indications include:
• Strong contraindication to anticoagulation, eg
• Active bleeding
• A high risk of bleeding, eg newly diagnosed peptic ulcer or very
recent haemorrhagic stroke
• Massive thromboembolism with contraindication to thrombolyis
• Ongoing thromboembolism despite anticoagulation
• Embolism from a septic focus

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis
The involuntary entry of extrinsic material into the pulmonary airways.
This is a common problem, ranging from subclinical micro-aspiration of
oropharyngeal mucus to major inhalation of gastric contents.

Risk factors
•
•
•
•
•
•

Swallowing problems
Gastro-oesophageal disorders leading to reﬂux
Impaired conscious level including seizures
Sedative drugs
Previous aspiration or non-aspiration pneumonia
Clinically assisted nutrition—either NG or gastrostomy

Diagnosis
Commonly, the occurrence of pneumonia in a patient with risk factor(s)
suggests the diagnosis.
CXR may show consolidation in dependent lung zones, eg R lower lobe,
although any zone may be affected.

Treatment
• The role of antibiotics is debated. Much of the radiographic response
may be a chemical pneumonitis, ie inﬂammatory reaction to caustic
gastric contents, rather than infective pneumonia
• The choice of antibiotics is also contentious. Many cases respond
well to amoxicillin or co-amoxiclav, but consider broad spectrum iv
antibiotics to cover Gram-negatives and anaerobes in:
• The unwell
• The especially frail
• High-dependency settings
• Where aspiration has been major
• If possible, treat the underlying cause. If risk factors persist (eg impaired
swallow or continual seizures), consider a ‘nil by mouth’ order until
they are addressed.
• Where the swallow may be impaired, perform a formal swallowing
assessment (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage swallow after stroke’,
p.189) and manage according to the results
• In palliative care;
• Consider anticholinergics to dry secretions
• In advanced dementia, it is often appropriate to accept the risk
of aspiration. Insertion of a gastrostomy (commonly a PEG) risks
medicalizing the ﬁnal months while achieving nothing—aspiration is
common in patients with a PEG
• It is often cruel and futile to deny a dying patient food that he or
she may enjoy, even if the risk of aspiration and a life-shortening
pneumonia exists. ‘Nil by mouth’ orders are usually inappropriate in
end-of-life situations. Instead consider using thickened ﬂuids, pureed
diet, supervised feeding, and avoiding eating in recumbent position,
with straws or feeder cups

CHRONIC COUGH

Chronic cough
A common problem, with causes ranging from the trivial to the sinister.
Even where the underlying cause is benign, chronic cough can be both
distressing and disabling.

Causes
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Asthma. Cough is a common presenting symptom in older people
Silent pulmonary aspiration
GORD
Postnasal drip can be due to sinusitis or chronic rhinitis. Frequently
allergic in origin, but in older people, symptoms are often not seasonal
Drugs, eg ACE inhibitors (may take weeks or months to develop),
B-blockers (leading to bronchospasm)
Persistent benign cough following upper respiratory tract infection.
May persist for 2–3 months
Chronic pulmonary pathology eg COPD, TB, bronchiectasis
Heart failure, with high pulmonary pressures
Thoracic malignancy, either primary or secondary

Investigation
Consider both tests and trials of treatment. Their pace and extent
depends on the differential diagnosis following careful history and examination. Consider the following tests:
• CXR (mandatory)
• Sinus X-ray
• Spirometry, with assessment of response to bronchodilators
• Regular monitoring of PEFR, looking for morning drops suggesting
asthma
• Sputum microscopy and culture is unlikely to be helpful
Next, consider a trial of treatment for the most likely cause, eg:
• Bronchodilators (and inhaled steroids) for possible asthma
• A PPI for possible GORD
• Assess the effect of treatment of possible chronic rhinitis with:
• Nasal corticosteroids. Probably the treatment of choice,
eg beclometasone, budesonide
• Decongestants. Should be used in short courses only (since
rebound phenomenon)
• Antihistamines. Most useful for obviously allergic rhinitis. Can be
topical spray or tablet. Should be used with caution; select those
with fewer anticholinergics properties, eg cetirizine or loratadine
In all cases, trials of treatment need to be prolonged (t8 weeks).

Treatment
This is of the underlying cause. Where this cannot be treated effectively
(eg advanced malignancy), speciﬁc treatments aimed at reducing cough
may be of beneﬁt. These include opiates such as codeine or morphine.
Simple cough linctus may be useful for irritating dry cough following an
upper respiratory tract infection.

333

334

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Lung cancers
The commonest cause of cancer deaths, and largely a disease of older
people.
• Symptoms may be non-speciﬁc (eg fatigue, weight loss), or else
pulmonary in origin but attributed to existing non-malignant pathology
(eg dyspnoea in a patient with COPD)
• Have a high index of suspicion and a low threshold for further
investigation. Have an even higher degree of suspicion in older smokers
presenting with pneumonia
Sinister features in those presenting with pneumonia include:
• Haemoptysis, especially if signiﬁcant, eg with persistent blood clots
• Regional or generalized symptoms of cancer (eg hoarse voice,
weight loss)
• Cough and consolidation without obvious infective symptoms
(eg fever)
• Symptoms that continue to be troublesome despite antibiotics
If sinister features are present, it is unacceptable to wait (up to 6 weeks)
before repeating a CXR to conﬁrm resolution. Refer promptly for urgent
specialist assessment and consider CT scanning, bronchoscopy, or lung
biopsy.

Treatment
• Treatment has improved and is now more effective, both in extending
life and in palliating symptoms. Therefore, ‘benign neglect’, ie simply
observing an older person with probable lung cancer, is now only
rarely acceptable. It may be appropriate, for example, in cases of
extreme frailty or severe cognitive impairment
• Older people with probable lung cancer remain under-investigated and
under-treated:
• Tests such as bronchoscopy and a histopathological diagnosis
are less commonly obtained. This makes palliative treatment and
prognostication difﬁcult
• Treatment such as surgery or chemotherapy are less commonly
considered or administered. To an extent this reﬂects appropriate
decision making based on functional status
• Treatment decisions should be made by expert MDTs that consider
the patient’s functional status, comorbidities, and cancer characteristics
2Refer all patients with suspected or conﬁrmed lung cancer for a specialist
opinion.

LUNG CANCERS

Non-small cell carcinoma (squamous cell, adeno-, and large
cell carcinoma)
• Surgery may lead to cure if:
• There is adequate pulmonary function (arbitrarily, FEV1 t1.5L)
• There is no distant spread (but >50% of cancers have spread at
presentation)
• The patient is relatively well with good functional status and no
serious comorbidity
• Surgical procedures are high risk (eg at 70 years, lobectomy has 10%
perioperative fatality, and pneumonectomy 20%). However, the
condition is always fatal without treatment, so the patient’s view is
critical
• Radiotherapy. When surgery is not feasible, either because of the
nature of disease, or the ﬁtness of the patient, then radiotherapy may
be used either:
• Palliatively, to control symptoms (see b ‘Palliative interventions’,
p. 335)
• Curatively, in high dose (CHART). Success rates are lower than for
surgery
• Neoadjuvantly, to reduce tumour volume and sometimes to
convert a non-operable tumour into an operable one
• Chemotherapy. Oral agents can be used if EGFR mutation found

Small cell carcinoma
• Relatively more common in older people: >20% of cases
• Most cases are advanced at presentation, and treatment is palliative
• Most tumours are chemoresponsive. Frail patients are unlikely to
tolerate aggressive treatment and it risks reducing the quality of the
brief life that remains. Therefore, chemotherapy regimens are tailored
to the patient, determined by structured assessment of performance
status. In general, frail patients undergo fewer but similar chemotherapy
cycles compared to the more robust
• Surgery is the treatment of choice, but is seldom useful because
tumours are rarely localized at presentation

Palliative interventions
• Radiotherapy for superior mediastinal obstruction, bronchial
obstruction, chest pain, haemoptysis, or painful bony metastases.
This is generally well tolerated, although 710% develop radiation
pneumonitis weeks after treatment, and it is on average more severe
in older people
• Opiates for cough
• Aspiration of pleural effusion for breathlessness
• Endobronchial therapy (eg stenting, diathermy)

335

336

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Tuberculosis: presentation
In older people, TB:
• Incidence is much higher, especially in the very old
• Outcomes, including mortality, are much less good
• Is most commonly due to reactivation of previous disease, the primary
infection having been asymptomatic or unrecognized. In the early
twentieth century, primary infection of young adults was common.
By the mid-late twentieth century, primary infection in younger people
had diminished. When this cohort reaches old age, TB reactivation will
be much less common
• Reactivation (postprimary disease) occurs due to decreased immunity
itself due to intrinsic ageing, disease (eg diabetes mellitus, renal failure),
malnutrition (eg chronic alcohol excess) or drugs (eg steroids)
• A few patients develop new infection from open cases. Care home
residents are most vulnerable, infection passing from fellow residents
or from care home staff
• Consider HIV infection when TB diagnosed

Presentation
Pulmonary disease
• Sometimes similar to that in younger people, ie cough, sputum, fatigue,
weight loss and anorexia
• Night sweats, fevers and pulmonary symptoms may be less common
• May present as pneumonia that fails to resolve, or as an incidental
ﬁnding, suggested on CXR
Extrapulmonary disease
Most (>75%) presentations are pulmonary, but extrapulmonary cases are
relatively more common in older people, eg:
• Miliary. Diffuse, overwhelming infection with fever, weight loss and
hepatosplenomegaly. Pancytopenia can occur
• Urogenital and renal. May affect any part of the renal tract. Sterile
pyuria, haematuria, abdominal or back pain, genital sinuses, or pelvic
masses may occur, or disease may be asymptomatic
• Meningeal. Consider this in the very frail, malnourished or
immunosuppressed patient with non-speciﬁc cerebral signs
(eg confusion, dementia-like syndrome, headache, or reduced
conscious level). Meningism may be absent, and the CSF virtually
acellular
• Skeletal. Bone infection most commonly affects the spine (usually
thoracic or lumbar), presenting as pain and tenderness. TB arthritis
usually affects large weight-bearing joints
• Other eg lymph nodes, intestine

TUBERCULOSIS: PRESENTATION

Sequelae of previous treatment
Lung collapse therapy was used widely in the treatment of pulmonary TB
in the 1930–50s. Procedures included therapeutic pneumothorax, thoracoplasty, and plombage (expanding the extrapleural space with artiﬁcial
materials). Sequelae include empyema, sinus formation, bronchopleural
ﬁstulae, and ventilatory failure. TB, pyogenic or fungal organisms may be
isolated. Early specialist input is essential.

337

338

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Tuberculosis: investigation
Chest X-ray
Changes are more variable than in younger people, and may mimic other
benign or malignant disease (eg bacterial pneumonia, cancer)
• Usually upper zone inﬁltrates with cavities, but more common features
in older people include mid/lower zone inﬁltrates, miliary (diffuse
nodular) and bilateral change
• Healed old disease is usually seen, ie calciﬁed hilar nodes, a peripheral
primary complex, pleural thickening, and diffuse apical ﬁbrosis and
calciﬁcation
• Pleural effusions are common
• Rare changes include mass lesions or isolated lymphadenopathy
• Very rarely the CXR may be normal, eg occasionally in miliary or
endobronchial disease

Sputum for microscopy and culture
The standard method of conﬁrming TB.
• Conventionally, three early morning sputum specimens are obtained
and stained by acid fast staining (eg Ziehl-Neelsen). The quality and
persistence of the microscopist is important, as the scanty organisms
can be easily missed on cursory examination
• If a patient cannot expectorate, obtain ‘induced sputum’, through
physiotherapy, or nebulized normal saline (rarely nebulized hypertonic
saline). If this fails, or clinical suspicion is high despite negative smear
and culture, consider bronchoscopy with washings

Other tests
• Raised ESR and CRP are usual
• FBC. Mild (normocytic) anaemia and reduced white cell count are more
common in older people. Lymphocytosis or pancytopenia can occur
• Obtain three early morning urine specimens in case of possible
genitourinary infection
• Tissue sampling. Where possible, sample tissue eg lymph node, pleura,
bone marrow. Send samples to both microbiology (microscopy and
culture) and to histology. Typical histological features, of caseous
necrosis with granuloma formation (with or without acid fast bacilli)
support strongly the diagnosis of TB
• Tuberculin skin testing is complex

TUBERCULOSIS: INVESTIGATION

HOW TO . . . Perform and interpret a tuberculin skin test
In these diagnostic tests, tuberculin puriﬁed protein derivative (PPD) is
injected in a standardized manner, and the reaction assessed quantitatively.
Heaf’s test has been used in screening larger numbers of younger
patients, often as pre-vaccination screening programmes. Tiny droplets
of high-concentration PPD are administered using a multiple tine (Heaf)
apparatus. High-concentration PPD is no longer manufactured, and the
test is not further described here.
Mantoux’s test is most commonly performed where TB is suspected
in an individual patient. Fixed volumes of less concentrated PPD are
injected intradermally.
• The standard dose is 5 tuberculin units (0.5mL of 1 in 10 000 dilution)
• Examine the skin after 48–72hr and measure the diameter of
induration, reﬂecting the extent of the cell-mediated immune
response
• A positive test indicates immunity, not necessarily infection. This
may be a result of previous (probably asymptomatic) TB infection,
or immunization (although reactivity to the bacille Calmette Guérin
(BCG) vaccine often disappears after 10 years)
• The degree of induration correlates approximately with the
likelihood of infection. However, the post-test probability of infection
is a product of both the pre-test probability and the test result.
• t15mm indicates a signiﬁcant reaction and the probability of
active infection
• 5–15mm may be signiﬁcant if pre-test probability is high eg close
contacts, suggestive CXR. Consider causes of a false negative
reaction
• <5mm is negative, usually indicating a low probability of active
infection. However, if the pre-test probability is very high,
consider treatment
• The test may be falsely negative (or equivocal) with steroid use,
lymphoma, malnutrition, sarcoid, overwhelming TB infection or when
there is concurrent other infection
• Ageing itself impairs the immunological reaction to tuberculin, and
may produce a false negative or equivocal test in patients previously
infected with TB. Giving a second (booster) tuberculin dose within
20 weeks of the ﬁrst often produces a positive test, deﬁned as when
induration >10mm and augmentation of induration (test 1–test 2)
exceeds 6mm

339

340

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Tuberculosis: treatment
Given the complexities of treatment, specialist referral is mandatory. This
is a notiﬁable disease and public health local authorities will investigate
contacts, especially in the care home setting. Respiratory isolation precautions are necessary for patients with pulmonary TB treated in hospital.
Pulmonary disease is treated for a total of 6 months
• Usually 6 months of rifampicin and isoniazid, with pyrazinamide
(and ethambutol) for the ﬁrst 2 months only
• Ethambutol may be omitted if the risk of resistance to isoniazid is low
• Longer treatment periods may be needed for extrapulmonary disease
In older people:
• Drug resistance is rare, as most infections are recurrences of primary
disease, contracted decades ago
• Failures of treatment are usually due to poor concordance.
Combination drug preparations may improve this (eg Rifater® =
rifampicin + isoniazid + pyrazinamide)
• Side effects are more common, including ocular toxicity from
ethambutol (reduce dose in renal impairment) and hepatitis from
isoniazid. Close monitoring is important
• Atypical mycobacteria, eg Mycobacterium avium intracellulare or kansasii
can occur in those with structural lung disease such as bronchiectasis.
This requires even broader and more prolonged courses of antibiotics
but isolation is not required as it does not spread from person to
person

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Asthma and COPD: assessment
Presentation
Asthma and COPD (Table 11.3) in older people:
• Are both diseases characterized by airﬂow obstruction
• Commonly coexist, eg in the childhood asthmatic who has smoked
• May both be mimicked by other common diseases eg cancer,
pulmonary embolism, heart failure
• May present late: older people are less aware of hypoxaemia,
breathlessness or bronchoconstriction
• Are underdiagnosed and undertreated, especially in older people
Asthma
• May present in old age as true ‘late onset asthma’. There are also
increasing numbers of people who have grown old with their asthma
• In older people, cough may dominate, symptoms ﬂuctuate less, triggers
(eg cold, smoke, allergens) are less frequent and the association with
hay fever or eczema is less strong
• Nocturnal cough or dyspnoea, including paroxysmal nocturnal
dyspnoea, may be caused by asthma
• NSAIDs and B-blockers (oral or ocular) may worsen
bronchoconstriction
COPD
• Is much more common in older age, the consequence of intrinsic
ageing and progressive disease
• Is caused by environmental exposure, usually to tobacco smoke, in
genetically susceptible people. Signiﬁcant disease can develop in those
who have not smoked for years, as acquired lung damage depends
more on ‘total pack years’ smoked rather than duration alone
• Symptoms are usually more chronic and slowly progressive, without
signiﬁcant variability
• If bronchitis is signiﬁcant, there is a productive cough (most days of at
least 3 months of 2 consecutive years). Fatigue and sleep disturbance
are common. Daytime somnolence suggests ventilatory failure
• There may be associated anaemia of chronic disease, osteoporosis,
malnutrition, and depression

Investigations
• Oximetry will determine the presence and degree of hypoxaemia.
In moderately or severely hypoxaemic patients (O2 saturation <92%),
consider ABGs to determine whether long-term oxygen therapy may
be of beneﬁt (see b ‘Oxygen therapy’, p.348) and, in the acutely
unwell, to guide oxygen administration
• CXR, ECG, and FBC will help to exclude other pathology, eg anaemia,
dysrhythmia

ASTHMA AND COPD: ASSESSMENT

• PEFR, measured regularly (bd—qds) for up to 2 weeks, helps determine
whether variable airways obstruction (asthma) exists. Variability t20%
is signiﬁcant. Older people may ﬁnd using PEFR meters and charting
the results difﬁcult. Ask them to demonstrate technique, reading the
device, and charting in clinic
• Spirometry. Obtain at least FEV1 and forced vital capacity (FVC). An
FEV1: FVC ratio of <70% suggests obstruction
• Older people often have difﬁculty performing pulmonary function
tests; an experienced technician in a respiratory laboratory will help
provide accurate results
• Assessments for bronchodilator responsiveness using inhaled
bronchodilators are now considered less helpful, as they are poorly
predictive of the response to treatment, and do not distinguish
reliably between asthma and COPD. However, airﬂow obstruction
that completely and repeatedly resolves after bronchodilator
administration does exclude COPD
• Assessments for steroid responsiveness can be helpful in
distinguishing between asthma and COPD (response is greater in
asthma than COPD, although there is overlap). Perform spirometry
before and after steroids (either 2 weeks of prednisolone 30mg od,
or 6 weeks of inhaled beclometasone 400micrograms bd)
• Some patients show improvement in FVC or functional status
(walking distance or speed) despite no signiﬁcant change in FEV1

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Asthma and COPD: drug treatment
In general, treatment principles are similar to those in younger people,
and are described in detail in British Thoracic Society guidelines. However
some differences and some similarities beneﬁt from emphasis.

Bronchodilators
• Older people perceive symptoms less reliably, so where there is
evidence of variable airways obstruction, give bronchodilators regularly
rather than as required
• In older age, response to anticholinergics, eg ipratropium, tiotropium,
may be better than to B-agonists, eg salbutamol
• High dose B-agonists, eg from nebulizers, may cause tremor,
tachycardia or rate-related angina. Nebulizers may not be
required—try higher inhaled doses via a spacer (eg salbutamol
400–800micrograms (4–8 puffs of a standard metered dose inhaler)), or
long-acting B-agonists, eg salmeterol
• Anticholinergic bronchodilators uncommonly cause side effects such
as dry mouth or blurred vision, more often with higher (nebulized)
doses and with long-acting preparations. Acute glaucoma is a rare but
important complication—reduce ocular exposure by nebulizing via a
mouthpiece rather than a face mask

Corticosteroids
• Long-term oral steroids are rarely beneﬁcial
• In those receiving regular courses of oral steroids for acute
exacerbations, give osteoporosis prophylactic treatment. Inhaled
steroids alone probably do not cause osteoporosis

Theophylline
• Toxicity is common in older people. Plasma levels are increased by
febrile illness, heart failure and drugs, eg erythromycin/ciproﬂoxacin.
Serious side effects, eg convulsions may be the ﬁrst sign of toxicity
• Check levels when titrating dose. Most of the therapeutic effect is seen
by the lower end of the therapeutic range, so target this ﬁrst
• Before introducing oral theophylline, optimise inhaled bronchodilator
and steroid therapy, including the use of long-acting and higher dose
preparations if necessary

Other
• Inﬂuenza and pneumococcal vaccine should be given
• Exercise extreme caution in the use of respiratory depressants,
eg benzodiazepines or opiates. In general:
• In acutely unwell patients with CO2 retention, stop them,
reintroducing only if withdrawal effects occur
• In stable patients with or without CO2 retention, withdraw or
reduce them where possible
• In severe, end-stage COPD, if dyspnoea or cough are distressing
and cannot be otherwise relieved, consider giving opiates. Give
small doses initially, but increase as needed to relieve distress, even
if respiratory function deteriorates. Explain the rationale to staff,
relatives and the patient if appropriate

ASTHMA AND COPD: DRUG TREATMENT

HOW TO . . . Improve drug delivery in asthma or COPD
• The traditional metered dose inhaler alone is rarely adequate, due
to difﬁculties in coordinating device activation and the onset of
inhalation
• Adding a large volume spacer device reduces the need to coordinate
activation with inhalation, improving drug delivery and reducing
side effects (eg oral thrush). Spacers are generally better tolerated
by older patients who don’t tend to consider them such a social
handicap as youngsters
• Breath-activated devices provide an alternative to the metered dose
inhaler, although lung volumes may not be adequate to activate the
device. They vary widely in design, and patients vary greatly in ability
to use them
• Assess and advise on technique regularly, involving both hospital
and community teams (doctor, nurse, and pharmacist) as well as the
family and other carers
• Nebulizers are rarely required. A metered dose inhaler via a large
volume spacer device is usually just as effective. Patients in whom
nebulized drugs are being considered should be referred for
specialist assessment
• Where concordance is an issue, eg in a person with dementia living
alone
• Give long-acting preparations where possible, eg salmeterol in
place of salbutamol, tiotropium in place of ipratropium
• Give combined preparations eg Combivent® in place of
salbutamol and ipratropium
• Once daily inhaled steroid is better than none
• Supervise taking of medication as often as possible, but accept
that taking for pulmonary drugs, taking medications irregularly is
probably better than taking them not at all
• Rarely, inhaled drugs are administered too frequently by cognitively
impaired people. This very rarely causes side effects, but relatives
may need reassurance that this is the case
• Occasionally, oral B-agonists are useful, in patients in whom all
inhaled preparations have been unsuccessful

Chest medicine

Asthma and COPD: non-drug treatment
• Smoking cessation should be advised, except in the very advanced or
terminal phase, where it may lack beneﬁt and be unkind. Consider
referring for support and/or nicotine replacement therapy
• Exercise is beneﬁcial, sometimes available as part of a pulmonary
rehabilitation scheme. Elements should include aerobic and
strength-based exercises as well as speciﬁc breathing exercises
• Pulmonary rehabilitation is as effective as inhaler therapy, and should
be a key part of treatment. It is a complex intervention tailored to the
individual, with exercise, behavioural and educational components.
Individual action plans can be followed by older people, facilitating
self-management and early intervention
• Weight reduction is beneﬁcial in the obese. However weight commonly
falls in advanced disease as the work of breathing exceeds caloriﬁc
intake, and nutritional supplements may be needed
• Comorbidities including depression are common and should be treated
aggressively
• Social and practical interventions. A comprehensive multidisciplinary
assessment may be warranted. Provide appropriate mobility aids,
eg electric wheelchairs, stairlifts, and alarm systems, eg pendant alarms.
Treat social isolation

Assisted ventilation
• Consider this in cases of respiratory arrest, respiratory acidosis,
delirium, exhaustion or deteriorating respiratory function despite full
treatment. Hypercapnia rather than hypoxaemia is usually the key
contributor to delirium; sedation is likely to worsen ventilation and
precipitate coma
• For some patients with acute-on-chronic deterioration, ventilation will
be futile and inappropriate. Make such a decision after considering:
• The nature of the chronic illness and recent deterioration
• The presence of reversible factors
• The patient’s current physiological status
• The views of the patient or others who represent them
• If in doubt, request guidance from the ITU team
• Non-invasive ventilation (NIV), eg nasal intermittent positive pressure
ventilation provides an acceptable alternative to invasive ventilation
(usually endotracheal intubation). NIV is often well tolerated, can
be delivered on specialist or high-dependency wards, and provides a
modest level of ventilatory support that can be weaned promptly as
the patient recovers

Palliative interventions
• Reassure—many patients are frequently terriﬁed. Assure them that
their symptoms of suffocation can, and will be treated. Consider
advance care planning
• Positioning—sit up, day and night
• Involve the palliative care team. Their advice and support is often
valuable and can continue into the community if discharge occurs

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Oxygen therapy
• Oxygen is a drug—it has clear indications, and common and important
side effects
• Precision and care in prescribing maximizes beneﬁt and reduces harm
• In older people, dyspnoea may be more frequently accepted, leading to
underprescribing
• However, indiscriminate prescribing, particularly the use of highconcentration oxygen, risks respiratory depression, and CO2 narcosis.
This is common in older people with COPD

Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT)
This improves prognosis in severe COPD and in moderate COPD with features of cor pulmonale. To reduce pulmonary hypertension, arterial pO2
should be raised above 8kPa for at least 15hr each day. Concentrations of
inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 24–28% usually achieve this. Respiratory depression is very rarely a problem in patients with stable respiratory failure who
receive low oxygen concentrations.
Speciﬁc criteria must be met before prescribing LTOT. Measure arterial
blood gases twice, on air, at least 3 weeks apart, and at least 4 weeks after
an acute exacerbation.
Criteria include:
• PaO2 7.3–8.0kPa in COPD with complications such as peripheral
oedema, evidence of pulmonary hypertension, or polycythaemia
• PaO2 <7.3kPa in COPD without the complications already listed

Intermittent oxygen therapy (IOT)
This is useful for a variety of cardiorespiratory conditions, eg COPD,
advanced heart failure, lung cancer. It relieves distress and improves exercise tolerance and mobility. Low concentrations (24–28%) can achieve
signiﬁcant symptomatic beneﬁt. Prognosis is unaltered.

High concentration oxygen therapy
Oxygen at 40–60% is useful for short-term use in respiratory failure
without hypoventilation and CO2 retention, commonly seen in acute
heart failure, PE, and pneumonia. Even in these cases, high-ﬂow oxygen
may reduce respiratory drive, leading to CO2 narcosis. This is especially
common in older people, those with a smoking history, the acutely unwell
and where respiratory depressants (eg opiates, benzodiazepines) are
co-administered.
Avoid this by:
• Keeping saturations just below normal (90–94%) rather than normal or
above normal (98–100%)
• Avoiding respiratory depressants
• Monitoring closely for signs of CO2 retention

OXYGEN THERAPY

Oxygen delivery systems
Supply patients with an administration device applicable to their circumstances. Latest guidelines for hospital are that clinicians should prescribe
the target saturation range and state whether controlled/constant performance is required and that nurses should monitor the patient and
determine the most suitable delivery system within those parameters.
Constant performance oxygen delivery systems (eg Ventimask 28%)
provide a stable FiO2 (24%, 28%, 32%, etc.) for a range of ventilation rates.
28% is suitable for most patients receiving LTOT. These must always be
used for hypoventilating patients with elevated PaCO2.
Variable performance oxygen delivery systems. FiO2 varies. The system
delivers oxygen at a given rate which mixes with room air at rates
dependent on ventilation. Systems include
• Nasal cannulae. Often better tolerated by patients, and allow them to
eat and talk. With oxygen ﬂows of 1–2L/min, FiO2 is usually low (less
than 28%), but can approach 30% if the patient hypoventilates
• Simple face mask, eg Hudson. Provides variable FiO2 up to 40%
• Non-rebreathing mask with reservoir bag. Provides variable FiO2
up to 60%

Oxygen gas supply
Oxygen concentrators are costly to purchase but running costs are low.
They are cost-effective when needing low ﬂow oxygen for prolonged
periods (t8hr per day). Oxygen is piped to convenient position(s) in the
home, and usually administered via nasal cannulae. Urgent installations can
usually be arranged within 24hr.
Oxygen bottles are useful for:
• Patients on LTOT via an oxygen concentrator who wish to leave their
home for short periods
• Patients needing oxygen as required, who do not meet the LTOT
criteria
• Patients who are likely to have a short-term need for continuous
oxygen, eg for end-of-life palliation, for whom installation of an oxygen
concentrator may not be worthwhile
A small oxygen cylinder (‘PD oxygen cylinder’; 300L, lasting 2hr) is available
which is convenient for wheelchair excursions, or travel in a car.
2Smokers should stop smoking before beginning oxygen therapy. The
risk of burns and household ﬁres is substantially increased.

CHAPTER 11

Chest medicine

Asbestos-related disease
The period between asbestos exposure and overt (or covert) disease is
usually long, often over 20 years. Almost all new cases are in older people
because asbestos exposure is so carefully regulated now. The exposure
may not be clearly recollected by the patient but always consider in highrisk occupations including builders, dock work and heavy engineering.
Conﬁrming the diagnosis is important because compensation may be due
if disease can conﬁdently be shown to have arisen as a consequence of
asbestos exposure. If the diagnosis could not be conﬁrmed during life,
then post-mortem conﬁrmation may lead to compensation payments to
relatives.

Pleural plaques
Discrete areas of thickening of the pleura that often calcify. Benign.
A marker of asbestos exposure, but of no further clinical signiﬁcance.
However, compensation is payable for this alone, if the claim is made
promptly following diagnosis.

Asbestosis
Progressive ﬁbrosis, clinically and radiographically similar to idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis. Usually due to prolonged and substantial occupational
exposure.

Mesothelioma
A malignant, incurable tumour of the pleura, presenting as cough, chest
pain, effusion, or dyspnoea. Very poor prognosis; few survive over 2 years.
Treatment is nearly always palliative; the tumour is not resectable, and is
relatively insensitive to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Asbestos exposure may have been only transient.

Bronchial carcinoma
There appears to be a synergistic effect between asbestos and tobacco.

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

The ageing gastrointestinal system
Teeth
•
•
•
•

Change colour—yellow and less translucent
Become worn (enamel does not regenerate)
Decreased vascularity and sensitivity of dentine and pulp
Caries, periodontitis, and tooth loss are common but not inevitable in
older patients. Being ‘long in the tooth’ refers to gum retraction seen
with periodontal disease which increases with poor oral hygiene and
xerostomia, both common in older people

Mouth
• Mucosa—thinner and more friable, rarely a functional problem
• Salivary glands do not produce less saliva but causes of xerostomia
(see b ‘Xerostomia’, p.355) are more frequent with increasing age
• Bone resorption occurs in the mandible alongside osteoporosis. This is
accelerated with periodontitis and progresses fast once teeth are lost
leading to a change in facial appearance
• Orofacial muscle tone can also diminish with consequent dribbling

Taste
Olfactory function, and hence taste discrimination, decreases gradually
with normal ageing but an acute change or complete absence of taste
should prompt investigations for a cranial tumour.

Oesophagus
• Slight changes in innervation produce clinically insigniﬁcant changes in
swallow and peristalsis
• The misnamed presbyoesophagus (see b ‘Oesophageal motility
disorders’, p.363) is a disorder of oesophageal motility, not a universal
age change
• Hiatus hernias and reﬂux are very common—probably related to
anatomical and postural changes

Stomach
• Increased incidence of atrophic gastritis (with reduced acid production)
but in the absence of disease most older patients maintain normal pH
levels
• Reduction in gastric emptying is common
• Increased mucosal susceptibility to damage
• Increased Helicobacter pylori carriage but this is less likely to cause
ulceration

Small intestine
• Function well preserved except for calcium absorption which is
decreased
• Increased incidence of bacterial overgrowth with malnutrition and
diarrhoea

THE AGEING GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

Large intestine
Decreased rectal sensation contributes to high incidence of constipation.

Pancreas
Structural changes including atrophy but function is well-preserved.

Liver
• Hepatic weight and volume decrease by around 25% and there is
brown (lipofuscin) pigment build-up, but liver function (and therefore
LFTs) is not affected
• Some older patients have a slightly low bilirubin and albumin level but
results still remain within the normal range

Gallbladder
• Incidence of gallstones increases (40% females >80), probably related
to reduced rate of synthesis and excretion of bile
• Most gallstones are asymptomatic

353

354

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

The elderly mouth
Mouth examination
Use gloves. Be systematic. Important and often not done—serious pathology
may be missed. Check:
• Parotid glands (enlarged in parotitis, alcoholism, chronic lymphoid
leukaemia)
• Temporomandibular joint (arthritis causes crepitus, subluxation, pain).
Dislocation can cause pain and inability to close mouth
• Soft tissues: tongue and ﬂoor of mouth commonest site for oral cancer
in smokers/alcoholics. Angular stomatitis
• Salivation: (see b ‘Xerostomia’, p.355)
• Teeth: how many missing, how many restorations, pain/sensitivities
Caries is increased by poor brushing and low ﬂuoride exposure, diet
of soft sweet foods, xerostomia, poor ﬁtting dentures, and infrequent
dentist visits
• Dentures: cleanliness, integrity, and ﬁt

General management
• Nursing help with dental/mouthcare is vital for anyone unable to help
themselves
• Referral to a dentist. Dental check-ups should continue every 6 months
regardless of age/disability. This is very difﬁcult to arrange for inpatients
but maxillofacial surgeons (who are also trained as dentists) will
sometimes help out in severe/urgent cases
• Consider chlorhexidine mouthwash for patients with poor oral selfcare, eg stroke, dementia
• Severe periodontal disease may require antibiotics (topical or systemic)
and surgical debridement to arrest progress
• Poor oral and dental health contributes to poor appetite and
malnutrition—consider nutritional support (see b ‘Nutrition’, p.356)

Facial pain
Consider trigeminal neuralgia, temporal arteritis, parotitis, temporomandibular joint arthritis, dental caries/abscess, aphthous mouth ulcers, or the
idiopathic benign ‘burning mouth syndrome’.

Sore tongue
Can be a side effect of drugs, glossitis (B12, iron, or folate deﬁciency),
candida/thrush especially after antibiotics or in diabetes. A black tongue
may be due to Aspergillus colonization and is treated with nystatin lozenges/mouth rinse.

Parotitis
Acute bacterial parotitis is not uncommon in frail older patients who
are not eating. Low salivary ﬂow (dehydration and not eating) and poor
oral hygiene predispose to parotid gland infection with mouth ﬂora
(staphylococci and anaerobes). Treat with aggressive rehydration, iv
ﬂucloxacillin and chlorhexidine mouth rinses. Response to treatment is
usually dramatic—if not consider abscess formation or MRSA.

THE ELDERLY MOUTH

Xerostomia
Perception of dry mouth is closely related to salivary ﬂow. Saliva is needed
for:
• Taste: dissolves food to present to taste buds
• Swallow: helps form food bolus
• Protection of teeth and mucosa: contains antibacterials, buffers and
mucin. Rapid tooth decay is a risk of xerostomia
Xerostomia is not a normal ageing change and should always be investigated. Causes include:
• Drugs with anticholinergic side effects (eg tricyclic antidepressants,
levodopa)
• Sjögren’s syndrome (an autoimmune destruction of salivary glands) can
be primary or associated with other autoimmune conditions
• Irradiation, salivary stones, tumours, sialadenitis (viral or bacterial
infections)
Treatment depends on cause—stop or decrease causative drugs, stimulate saliva with grapefruit juice/sugar-free sweets or mints, and promote
frequent careful mouthcare. Artiﬁcial saliva can provide symptomatic
relief for some patients.

Oral candidiasis
May manifest as oral thrush (with removable white plaques on erythematous base), angular stomatitis (sore cracks in corner of mouth), or,
rarely atrophic forms (eg under dentures, may not have creamy plaque).
Consider and reverse risk factors such as antibiotics, steroids, hyperglycaemia, and immunosuppression, where possible. Use nystatin 1mL qds
rinsed around mouth for several minutes. In cases with painful swallowing/
dysphagia (ie might have oesophageal involvement) and those that cannot
comply with rinses use oral ﬂuconazole 50–100mg od for 7–14 days.
Dentures should be kept out where possible and soaked in chlorhexidine
during treatment.

Mouth ulcers
Simple aphthous ulcers and ulcers due to poorly ﬁtting dentures should
be treated with topical anti-inﬂammatories (salicylate gel or triamcinolone), hydrocortisone lozenges, or steroids. Ulcers can occur as part
of a systemic disease such as inﬂammatory bowel disease. Any oral lesion
persisting more than 3 weeks merits referral and/or biopsy to exclude
cancer but most mouth cancers are painless.

Oral manifestation of systemic diseases/drugs
A very long list including common and general (eg oral candidiasis in immunosuppression) as well as rare and speciﬁc (eg oral lichen planus) manifestations. Remember that many drugs also affect the mouth, eg xerostomia
(see b ‘Xerostomia’, p.355), tardive dyskinesia with antipsychotics, gum
hypertrophy with phenytoin.

Systemic manifestation of dental diseases
Poor oral hygiene with dental or periodontal disease can cause septicaemia
or infective endocarditis. Poor teeth can contribute to poor nutrition.

355

356

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Nutrition
With normal ageing there are:
• Reduced calorie requirements due to reduced activity and lower
resting metabolic rate (decreased muscle mass)
• Reductions in appetite (anorexia of ageing)
• Lower reserves of macro and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals)
In the presence of disease older patients quickly become malnourished,
which is a powerful predictor of outcome (increased functional dependency, morbidity, mortality, and use of healthcare resources).
Malnutrition is extremely common in the elderly frail or institutionalised
population, and studies have shown that once in hospital most patients’
nutritional status actually declines further. Protein-energy undernutrition
affects:
• 15% of community-dwelling older patients
• 5–12% of housebound patients with multiple chronic problems
• 35–65% of patients acutely admitted to hospital
• 25–60% of institutionalized older persons

Nutritional assessment
• BMI (weight in kg/(height in m)2) is often impractical as height cannot
be accurately measured in immobile patients or those with abnormal
posture (although approximations can be made, eg using ulnar length)
• Simple weight is still useful especially if the patient knows their usual
weight—rapid weight loss (>4kg in 6 months) is always worrying even
in obese patients. Mid-arm circumference can be used to approximate
• Nutrition screening tools are often employed by nursing staff to target
interventions. The MUST score (see b Appendix, ‘Malnutrition
universal screening tool (MUST)’, p.695) is widely used in UK hospitals
and is sensitive for detection of protein-energy undernutrition in
hospitalized patients
• More complex tools (eg Mini Nutritional Assessment) are helpful but
time-consuming and rarely used outside research
• Biochemical measures (eg hypoalbuminaemia, anaemia,
hypocholesterolaemia) develop at a late stage and are confounded by
acute illness

Nutritional support
• Identiﬁcation is key to allow targeted intervention (improves outcome)
• The cause is usually multifactorial and a multidisciplinary approach is
needed eg medical (immobile, unwell, reﬂux, constipation, etc.), social
(poverty, isolation), psychological (depression, dementia) and age
related (altered hunger recognition)
• Involve a dietician early (especially if anorexia is prominent)
• Record food intake carefully—this highlights deﬁciencies in intake and
helps identify where interventions might help
• Make mealtimes a priority (protected meal times) and provide
assistance with feeding (dietetic assistants or family)
• Schemes such as using a red tray can highlight those in need of
assistance

NUTRITION

• Establish food preferences and offer tempting, high-calorie foods
(eg substitute full fat milk and yogurt if they are on the lower fat variety)
• Prescribe dietary supplements according to patient preference
(eg milky or fruit drinks, soups, puddings, or high-calorie shots)
• Appetite stimulants, eg prednisolone can increase weight but side
effects usually outweigh beneﬁts
• Consider the role of enteral feeding

HOW TO . . . Manage weight loss in older patients
Peak body mass is reached at age 40–50 and weight loss can occur after
this due to decreased lean mass, although the proportion of fat is relatively increased so overall weight is often remarkably stable.
As a rule of thumb unintentional weight loss of more than 5lb
(2.3kg)/5% of body weight in a month or 10lb (4.5kg)/10% body weight
in 6 months is worrying.
Always try to get recorded weight (rather than relying on patient/
carer memory)—a search of old outpatient clinic and primary care
records can help. Record weight regularly while you investigate to look
for ongoing trends.
Dramatic weight loss should always prompt a search for remediable
pathology. The cause is often multifactorial. It is important to consider:
• Dementia
• Depression
• Malignancy
• Chronic infection/disease, eg COPD, heart failure, TB
• Inﬂammatory conditions, eg giant cell arteritis
• Malabsorption (see b ‘Diarrhoea in older patients’, p.376)
• Mesenteric ischaemia (recurrent postprandial abdominal pain)
• Drug causes, eg digoxin, theophyllines, cholinesterase inhibitors
• Metabolic disorders, eg hyperthyroidism, uraemia
• Swallowing problems
• Persistent nausea or abdominal pain/reﬂux
• Social causes, eg inability to cook, poverty, social isolation, alcoholism
A careful history (including dietary history and mental state with collateral history where possible), examination, and routine screening tests
(see b ‘Investigations’, p.66) will usually give clues of signiﬁcant underlying pathology. If preliminary investigations are negative a ‘watch and
re-weigh and wait’ plan is reasonable—be reassured if weight is actually
stable or rising, re-examine and re-screen if further loss occurs.
Obviously if a remediable cause is found and treated then weight loss
may be halted or reversed. Where no such cause is found, or where it is
not reversible, interventions are still possible.

357

358

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Enteral feeding
Consider enteral feeding early if there is dysphagia (eg stroke, motor
neurone disease, Parkinson’s disease) or failure of oral feeding (eg severe
anorexia syndromes, intensive care unit) with an intact gastrointestinal tract.
There are three common methods:
• Fine-bore NG tubes: simple, quick, and inexpensive. The preferred
method for short-term feeding. Some patients (usually confused/
drowsy) repeatedly pull out NG tubes. Interference with the tube
increases the risk of aspiration. Persistence, supervision and careful
taping can sometimes help but often a PEG or RIG is required (also
described here). There is increasing experience using NG tubes which
are held in place via a nasal loop (Bridle™). Trained practitioners can
insert these by the bedside and removal by the patient is very rare
• PEG: the risks of insertion include perforation, bleeding, and infection
for a patient who is usually already frail. The patient has to be ﬁt to
undergo sedation. Problems obtaining consent from a competent
patient and ‘agreement’ from next of kin for an incompetent one are
not uncommon. Once established, this method is discreet and better
tolerated than NG tubes and is the method of choice for medium/longterm enteral feeding
• RIG: useful if gastroscopy technically difﬁcult (eg pharyngeal pouch) and
sometimes if small-bowel feeding preferred over gastric feeding. Similar
complication rate to PEG

Complications for all methods include
• Aspiration pneumonia: there is a common misconception that enteral
feeding eliminates aspiration in dysphagic patients. This is not
true—reﬂux of food into oesophagus is common and this along with
salivary secretions and covert oral intake may still be aspirated. Always
check the position of the tube if patient becomes unwell, feverish, or
breathless. If aspiration is ongoing despite correct tube position slow
the feed, feed with patient sitting upright (ie not at night) and add promotility drugs, eg metoclopramide 10mg tds or erythromycin 250mg
tds (pre-meals). A nasojejunal tube or jejunal extension to a PEG
tube can also reduce aspiration rates (see b ‘Aspiration pneumonia/
pneumonitis’, p.332)
• Re-feeding syndrome: occurs when patient has been malnourished for
a long time. When feeding commences, insulin levels cause minerals
(especially phosphorus) to move rapidly into intracellular space and
ﬂuid retention occurs causing hypophosphataemia, hypomagnesaemia,
and hypokalaemia. This in turn can cause life-threatening heart failure,
respiratory failure, arrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Avoid by ‘starting
low and going slow’ when introducing feed. It is important to check
and correct any abnormal biochemistry before feeding starts and then
monitor frequently (check U+E, Ca, Mg, phosphate, and glucose daily
for a few days, then weekly). Supplementation of minerals may be done
intravenously or by adding extra to NG feed
• Fluid overload and heart failure: decrease volume and add diuretics
• Diarrhoea: exclude infection (especially Clostridium difﬁcile). Try slowing
the feed rate or changing the feed to one containing more or less ﬁbre

ENTERAL FEEDING

Parenteral feeding
Should be considered when the gut is not functioning. It requires central
venous access and should only be undertaken when supervised by an
experienced nutrition team. It is usually a temporary measure, eg postgastrointestinal surgery. Complications such as ﬂuid overload, electrolyte disturbance, and iv catheter sepsis are common in older patients.

HOW TO . . . Insert a ﬁne-bore NG feeding tube
This task is often performed by nursing staff who may be very experienced. Doctors are often asked to help when insertion is proving difﬁcult.
1. Get the patients consent—if they refuse come back later. They may
well have just had several uncomfortable failed attempts. It is rarely
appropriate to perform against the wishes of the patient
2. Have the patient sitting upright with chin tucked forward (patients
often hyperextend their neck which makes it harder). Draw the
curtains (this can be an unpleasant procedure to have done or to
watch)
3. Leave the guide wire in the tube and lubricate with lots of jelly
4. Feed the tube down one nostril about 20cm (until it hits the back
of the throat)
5. If there is a proximal obstruction try the other nostril
6. If possible ask the patient to swallow and advance the wire
7. Check the back of the throat carefully—you should be able to see a
single wire going vertically down. Start again if there is a loop
8. Secure the tube yourself immediately with tape to both nose and
cheek
Once you believe the tube is in place you need to check it is in the
stomach by one or both of the following methods BEFORE you use
the tube.
• Aspiration of gastric contents that are clearly acidic (pH <5)
• Chest X-ray is used if there is no aspirate, or the pH is equivocal. If
you leave the guide wire in, the tube shows more easily. The tip of
the tube should be clearly below the diaphragm
The method of blowing air down the tube and listening for bubbles
has now been discredited as a bubbling sound can be generated due to
saliva and pulmonary secretions.

359

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

The ethics of clinically assisted feeding
Feeding is a highly emotive issue. It is seen by many (especially relatives)
as a basic need and hence failing to provide adequate nutrition is seen as a
form of neglect or even euthanasia. In contrast, others (often nurses) feel
that artiﬁcial enteral feeding is a cruel and futile treatment performed on
incompetent patients that only postpones a ‘natural’ death that involves
anorexia or dysphagia.
The use of the term ‘clinically assisted nutrition and hydration’ has
been suggested by the General Medical Council (UK) to replace the term
‘artiﬁcial nutrition and hydration’ underlining the fact that this is a form of
treatment.
There are numerous high-proﬁle legal cases regarding feeding (usually
withdrawal of), and controversial cases that cannot be resolved locally
should always be referred to the courts via the local legal team.
2The key to steering a course through this mineﬁeld is communication.

Initiating treatment
• Establish if the patient is competent—even dysphasic patients may
understand a little with non-verbal cues, etc
• If the patient has capacity (see b ‘Capacity’, p.654) ensure they
understand the chosen method (and its risks) and projected duration of
feeding. Patients with dysphagia must realize that they will be expected
to dramatically decrease, or stop, oral feeding
• For patients who lack capacity, ensure you have communicated with all
interested carers, family, and the GP. There is sometimes disagreement
between interested parties and these are best detected and ‘thrashed
out’ early. A case conference is often helpful
• Establish that everyone accepts the indications for feeding and the aims
of treatment and set a date for review, eg:
• 2 weeks of NG feeding in a patient with dysphagia following a
stroke, which is hoped will resolve
• PEG insertion in a patient with MND and malnutrition with
recurrent aspiration pneumonia, to be reviewed if patient requests
or if enters terminal phase of disease
• Don’t be afraid of a therapeutic trial (eg if you don’t know whether the
patient’s lethargy/drowsiness/depression is related to malnutrition).
Always ensure everyone understands and agrees on review dates and
criteria for reassessment. Patients/relatives can be reassured that PEG
tubes can be removed if improvement occurs
• Record discussions and plan carefully in medical record
• If there is still dispute get a second opinion. As a last resort legal advice
may be needed

THE ETHICS OF CLINICALLY ASSISTED FEEDING

Withdrawing treatment
2Withholding treatment is not morally different to withdrawing it.
There are however, technical and emotional differences, which is why
many more ethical problems arise when withdrawing and why some
doctors are resistant to trials of treatment.
Artiﬁcial feeding can be withdrawn because:
• It is no longer required (rarely controversial)
• A therapeutic trial has failed (see b ‘Initiating treatment’, p.360—
this is sometimes controversial)
• Although feeding is successful the patient’s quality of life is felt to be
unacceptable (nearly always controversial)
British Medical Association advice is that all cases of withdrawal of longterm feeding should be referred to the courts. This is certainly true if
there are any parties who object, but there are non-controversial cases
in elderly patients where this is not necessary.

Accepting aspiration risk
There is also a group of patients who have dysphagia, weight loss, and
recurrent aspiration due to progressive neurological conditions such as
dementia, who merit special consideration.
It is not always appropriate to aggressively manage such patients, who
are frequently incompetent and derive pleasure from eating normally.
It may be appropriate to allow the patient to eat, accepting that there is
a risk of aspiration.
Adopting such a palliative policy is impossible unless everyone,
including the whole MDT and relatives, understand and sympathize with
the aims of management.

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Oesophageal disease
Gastro-oesophageal reﬂux disease (GORD)
• The symptoms (retrosternal burning, acid regurgitation, ﬂatulence,
atypical chest pain) correlate poorly with the pathology (normal
mucosa to severe oesophagitis)
• Sinister features which might suggest malignancy include sudden or
recent onset, dysphagia, vomiting, weight loss, and anaemia. They
should guide management:
• In the absence of sinister features a ‘blind’ trial of treatment is given
• If there are sinister features then a gastroscopy should be arranged
• Oesophageal pH monitoring is rarely necessary
Treatment
Check if the patient is taking prescribed or over-the-counter NSAIDs,
steroids, or bisphosphonates, and stop or minimize the dose. Proton
pump inhibitors (PPIs) have revolutionalized treatment, making antacids
and H2 blockers such as ranitidine almost redundant. They are very effective (for symptoms and healing) and safe. They are used for prophylaxis
with aspirin—often at lower dose, as well as treatment and some are
licensed for intermittent symptomatic use. Some are available over the
counter. Rarely elderly patients can have side effects of diarrhoea or confusion (see b ‘Proton pump inhibitors’, p.148).

Barrett’s/columnar-lined oesophagus
Gastric mucosa replaces the oesophageal squamous cell mucosa. It is
associated with an increased risk of malignancy and should have regular
endoscopic surveillance regardless of symptoms.

Hiatus hernia
• Very common in older patients, occurring to a degree in almost all
• Laxity of structures at the gastro-oesophageal junction allows
oesophago-gastric junction or portions of stomach to move up
(permanently or intermittently) into the thorax
• May be asymptomatic but often presents with GORD symptoms and
occasionally with dysphagia
• Very large intrathoracic hernias can impair respiratory function and
strangulate/perforate
Diagnosis on CXR (stomach or ﬂuid level behind heart), at endoscopy, or
on contrast radiology.
Treatment:
To reduce reﬂux, suggest: lose weight, avoid alcohol and caffeine, eat small
meals often, avoid eating before bed, and sleep propped up on pillows or
elevate head of bed on blocks. PPIs will nearly always relieve symptoms,
consider investigations if they don’t. Prokinetic agents, eg metoclopramide
10mg tds sometimes help. Younger patients with intractable problems can
be assessed for surgery—laparoscopic surgery now available.

OESOPHAGEAL DISEASE

Achalasia
• An idiopathic neurological degeneration causing impaired peristalsis
and a lack of lower oesophageal sphincter relaxation, causing a
functional obstruction
• Dysphagia for solids and/or liquids is the most frequent presenting
complaint
• Onset is insidious and slowly progressive
• CXR may reveal a dilated oesophagus
• Endoscopy is usually performed to exclude malignancy, but may be
normal
• Barium swallow has characteristic abnormalities (dilated oesophagus
terminating in a beak-like narrowing)
• Manometry is the gold standard for diagnosis
• Treatment is aimed at facilitating lower oesophageal sphincter
relaxation, and can include drugs (calcium channel blockers or nitrates),
botulinum toxin injection, endoscopic dilation of the sphincter, or
surgical myotomy

Oesophageal motility disorders
• Group of disorders where oesophageal motility is signiﬁcantly different
from normal (excluding achalasia, which is a distinct pathological entity)
• Incorporates those patients previously described as having
presbyoesophagus (motility abnormalities ascribed to age, probably
incorrectly)
• Presenting features include heartburn, chest pain, and dysphagia
• Syndromes include diffuse oesophageal spasm, nutcracker oesophagus,
and hypertensive lower oesophageal sphincter
• Motility disorders can also arise secondary to other diseases
(eg diabetes, systemic sclerosis, chronic GORD)
• Diagnosis may be made with barium swallow, but manometry is the
gold standard
• Treatment with calcium channel blockers or tricyclic antidepressants
has some evidence base although other drugs, botulinum toxin, and
endoscopic dilation are also occasionally used

Oesophageal candidiasis
• Can present with dysphagia or pain
• Consider in frail or immunosuppressed patients, especially if oral
candidiasis is present
• Characteristic appearance on endoscopy (biopsy conﬁrms) or barium
swallow
• Treat with ﬂuconazole 50–100mg od for 2 weeks

363

364

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Dysphagia
Dysphagia (difﬁculty in swallowing) is a common symptom in older patients.

History
• Ask what type of food is difﬁcult (solids or liquids) and the level at
which food sticks (mouth/throat, retrosternal, or epigastric)
• Distinguish dysphagia from early satiety and regurgitation (when
successfully swallowed food returns after seconds/minutes), which
usually occurs with gastric outlet obstruction
• If the swallow ‘tires’ through a meal consider myasthenia
• Cough, wheeze, or recurrent aspiration pneumonia can be a
presentation of swallowing problems which cause aspiration

Signs
Look for weight loss, oral thrush (may be associated with oesophageal
candida), supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, and a gastric splash (implies
gastric outlet obstruction). Watch the patient swallow some water and
food—the diagnosis might be clear.

Causes
These can be divided into two:
• Structural lesions (worse with solids)
• Oesophageal or gastric cancer
• Benign strictures—scarring following, eg oesophagitis, scleroderma,
polymyositis, radiotherapy
• Pharyngeal pouch
• Oesophageal candida or severe oesophagitis
• Hiatus hernia can produce obstruction symptoms
• External obstruction, eg bronchial tumour, aortic aneurysm, or
cervical osteophyte
• Foreign bodies (eg hair balls) are commoner in patients with
dementia
• Functional problems (often worse with ﬂuids)
• Pharynx/throat—commonest neurological cause is stroke but
can occur in advanced dementia and MND. Rarer neurological
conditions include myasthenia gravis, inclusion body myositis,
multiple sclerosis, and parkinsonian syndromes
• Oesophagus—dysmotility problems are relatively common in older
patients and include achalasia and diffuse oesophageal spasm

Investigations
Gastroscopy is now the primary investigation and is well tolerated even in
frail elderly patients. Use a barium swallow ﬁrst if there is felt to be a high
risk of perforation with an endoscope (eg suspect pouch), but gastroscopy allows biopsy and therapy, eg dilation. Videoﬂuoroscopy provides
functional imaging and is useful diagnostically, but the correlation between
observed aspiration and clinically signiﬁcant problems is poor.

DYSPHAGIA

Treatment of dysphagia
• An empirical trial of PPI can be used in the very frail and those who are
deemed unﬁt for investigation
• If oral thrush is present try ﬂuconazole 50–100mg od for a week
• Oesophageal dilation ± stenting can be very successful for benign or
malignant strictures
• For functional problems always involve a speech therapist. Changing
the consistency of food and ﬂuids, and positioning patient correctly can
minimize problems
• Oesophageal dysmotility—try PPI and a calcium channel blocker or a
nitrate
• Gastroparesis causes early satiety and vomiting. It can be very hard to
treat—try metoclopramide 10mg tds or erythromycin 250mg tds, with
domperidone 30mg pr tds if oral route not viable. Electrical gastric
‘pacing’ or surgery may provide relief (rarely used)
• Nutritional support—elderly patients with dysphagia are usually
malnourished to start with and are then put nil by mouth for
investigations. Refer to the dietician and consider dietary supplements
and early enteral feeding by NG tube or PEG (see b ‘Enteral
feeding’, p.358)
Aspiration pneumonitis (see b ‘Aspiration pneumonia/pneumonitis’, p.332)
is largely a chemical rather than infective insult that may be complicated
by infection. It is treated by:
• Preventing/minimizing aspiration (nil by mouth, NG feeding)
• Oxygen therapy
• Chest physiotherapy
• Iv antibiotics are given to prevent/treat superinfection

365

366

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Peptic ulcer disease
This disease is becoming much rarer with the advent of effective medical
treatment. It remains predominantly a disease of the elderly population.
NSAID use is the most common cause, followed by H. pylori.
H. pylori is a spiral Gram-negative bacterium which colonizes the gastric
mucosa causing gastritis. Carriage rates increase with age—40% at age 50,
75% at age 70. Infection is usually asymptomatic but is the commonest
cause of dyspepsia in older patients. H. pylori is strongly associated with
duodenal ulcers and may have a link with NSAID-associated ulceration.

Presentation
Acute bleeding, pain (epigastric, retrosternal, or back), indigestion, ‘heartburn’, dysphagia, anorexia, weight loss, perforation (peritonitis), iron deﬁciency anaemia, or an incidental ﬁnding (eg on endoscopy). Older patients
may present non-speciﬁcally (‘off food’ or vague abdominal pains).

Investigation
• Upper GI endoscopy is very safe and well-tolerated in older patients.
It can often be performed using local anaesthesia in the throat only
• H. pylori can be detected with gastric biopsy and histology or with a
test for urease activity (Clo test®). Serological tests remain positive but
titres gradually decline after eradication. Breath tests can detect
H. pylori colonization but obviously do not demonstrate pathology

Treatment
Dietary restriction is unnecessary (worth speciﬁcally mentioning because
older patients can remember harsh or bizarre anti-ulcer diets). Stop
any NSAIDs. Stop aspirin if possible, and plan for safe reintroduction
depending on risk/beneﬁt of individual patient. Where there is H. pylori
and ulceration/gastritis treat with one of the many ‘triple therapy’ antibiotic PPI regimens. In the absence of H. pylori just a PPI will sufﬁce. Arrange
a repeat scope at 6 weeks to check healing of all gastric ulcers and malignant-looking duodenal ulcers.
For bleeding
• Resuscitation with blood product is life saving
• Early interventional endoscopy with adrenaline injection (or other
modalities, eg heater probes or clips) into bleeding point is suitable for
almost all patients—don’t delay because of age/comorbidity
• Iv proton pump inhibitor reduces the risk of re-bleeding
• Continued bleeding/re-bleeding despite endoscopic treatment is an
indication for surgical intervention. These patients have a high mortality
but overall do beneﬁt from operative intervention
• Scores using clinical, laboratory and endoscopic features can stratify
risk of re-bleeding (eg Rockall score)
For perforation (see b ‘The “acute surgical abdomen” ’, p.380)
Remember ‘silent’ perforation (without signs of peritonitis) is more
common in the elderly population (especially if on steroids or diabetic).
Mortality is high due to delayed diagnosis, reluctance to perform surgery,
and postoperative complications.

PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

HOW TO . . . Investigate and manage persistent
unexplained nausea and vomiting
This group of patients can be very challenging but you should actively
manage them from an early stage because they are often very uncomfortable and bedbound. There is frequently reversible disease and
they are at high risk of dehydration/malnutrition and complications of
immobility.
Nausea and vomiting (N+V) can be the major presenting feature
of illnesses as diverse as pneumonia, MI, intracerebral haemorrhage,
Addison’s disease, UTI, and constipation.
• Start with a careful history (especially drug history)
• Thorough examination (including rectal examination and neurological
assessment)
• Regular observations of vital signs (looking for intermittent pyrexia,
arrhythmia, etc.)
• Screening blood tests (including calcium, thyroid function, CRP, iron
studies, liver function), urinalysis, CXR, and ECG
Drugs
Look very carefully at drug history—almost any drug can cause N+V but
digoxin (even with therapeutic serum levels), opiates, tramadol, antiparkinsonian drugs, antidepressants, NSAIDs, and PPIs are some of the
common candidates. New drugs are the most likely, but remember
poor compliance with drugs at home which are prescribed in hospital,
eg co-codamol used occasionally at home may be written as 2 qds in
hospital. If there is polypharmacy try stopping the drugs one at a time,
remembering that some drugs can take days to ‘wash out’.
Central causes
Raised intracerebral pressure can occasionally present this way. A CT
scan is needed if there is drowsiness, focal neurology, or a past history
of intraventricular blood (exclude hydrocephalus). If there is vertigo
or tinnitus consider labyrinthitis or posterior circulation stroke, see
Table 21.1.
Gut causes
Constipation is a very common cause of nausea even without obstruction. An abdominal X-ray (AXR) should be done early on to exclude
obstruction. Consider repeating this if symptoms persist and you remain
suspicious. Plain radiology will remain normal in high obstruction and an
oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) or small-bowel follow-through
may help. Severe gastritis/peptic ulceration can present with N+V
without pain/bleeding. Gastroparesis is most common in people with
diabetes and is very hard to treat—try metoclopramide, domperidone,
or erythromycin.

367

368

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

The liver and gallbladder
Cirrhosis
Chronic liver disease can present for the ﬁrst time in elderly people.
The presentation is often non-speciﬁc. The prognosis is worse than for a
younger person with the same degree of liver damage. Common causes
include alcohol, hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis, and non-alcoholic fatty
liver. A proportion are cryptogenic (thought to be ‘burnt out’ autoimmune hepatitis or non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
• Hepatitis C may have been transmitted from blood products received
before 1991 when screening was introduced. Alcohol consumption
is known to increase the percentage of those infected with hepatis C
who develop cirrhosis
• Alcohol excess can present with falls, confusion and heart failure at any
age but older patients are less likely to volunteer (or be asked) their
alcohol history. 2Always enquire about alcohol
Investigations
If you suspect cirrhosis should include: A-1-antitrypsin, autoimmune
proﬁle (antinuclear antibody (ANA), smooth muscle antibody (SMA),
liver-kidney microsome antibodies (LKM), antimitochondrial antibody, and
immunoglobulins), ferritin and iron studies, ceruloplasmin, hepatitis B and
C serology, and ultrasound including Doppler of portal and hepatic vein.
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Is not always a benign condition (half will be progressive and 15% develop
cirrhosis). Obesity, hyperlipidaemia, and type 2 diabetes are risk factors
so this condition is more common in older patients. If an ultrasound scan
reveals fatty liver, advise about weight reduction and alcohol cessation.

Gallstones
• Very common (1:3 elderly females) and mostly asymptomatic although
troublesome symptoms often misdiagnosed as GORD or diverticulitis
in older age groups
• Management largely as for younger patients but the risks of surgical
intervention are higher so conservative/less invasive approaches often
adopted
• Acute cholecystitis in older patients may present atypically (eg without
pain) and is not always associated with gallstones. It has a 10% mortality
and should be aggressively treated with iv antibiotics and supportive
care. Failure to improve should prompt early surgical review

THE LIVER AND GALLBLADDER

HOW TO . . . Approach an older patient with abnormal
liver function tests
This is not an uncommon ﬁnding, and investigation is as for younger
patients. However, the following should be considered:
• Drug injury to the liver is common, and may occur up to 6 months after
exposure (eg statins, co-proxamol, penicillins, some over-the-counter
medications)
• Liver metastases may present this way (more common in older
patients)
• Deranged LFTs may occur as part of a systemic illness, eg sepsis
(consider gallbladder/biliary infection if the LFTs are very abnormal),
cardiac failure (with hepatic congestion), inﬂammatory conditions
(polymyalgia rheumatica), ischaemic liver damage (after prolonged
hypotension), Addison’s disease, and thyroid disease
• The picture is often mixed, with both cholestatic and hepatocellular
components
A careful history should be taken, looking for duration of the problem
and whether (if old) it has been previously investigated. If new, ask about
possible drug or toxin exposure, associated symptoms (eg heart failure,
sepsis, primary malignancy) and alcohol use (do not make lifestyle
assumptions—alcohol excess is under-recognized in older people)
Clarify that that abnormality is from the liver:
• An isolated elevated ALP is often from a bone source (commonly
Paget’s disease) but don’t assume this—liver metastases can present
this way
• Isoenzymes can be measured, but clinical judgement is usually
sufﬁcient to guide investigation
• Muscle disorders can cause transaminase elevation
Persistent elevation should always prompt investigations:
• Bloods including electrolytes, clotting, TFTs, autoimmune screen
(serum electrophoresis, ANA, antimitochondrial antibodies,
SMA and LMK), viral serology (hepatitis B and C), iron studies
(haemochromatosis), ceruloplasmin (Wilson’s disease), endomysial
antibodies (coeliac disease) and A-1-antitrypsin
• Liver ultrasound—a good screening test that will usually identify liver
metastases as well as highlighting any biliary duct dilation prompting
referral for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
If the liver damage is progressive, or the diagnosis elusive then refer to a
hepatologist for consideration of liver biopsy.

369

370

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Constipation
The term constipation is used in different ways, indicating one or more of
the following:
• The time between bowel evacuations is longer than normal
• The stool is harder than normal
• The total faecal mass present within the abdomen is increased
The most precise deﬁnition may be delayed alimentary tract transit time,
but this is hard to measure and is delayed in age, in the institutionalized,
and in those eating a Western diet.
There are said to be three types of constipation:
• Hard faeces present in the rectum (often in massive amounts)
• The whole distal large bowel loaded with soft, putty-like faeces that
cannot be evacuated
• High (proximal) impaction which may be due to obstructing pathology
(eg diverticular disease, carcinoma)

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is largely clinical (based on history and examination alone).
2Ask speciﬁcally as some patients are embarrassed to trouble doctors
with bowel symptoms.
Constipation may, rarely, be the primary cause of delirium but
commonly contributes to the presentation of the frail elderly with other
pathology such as sepsis or renal failure.
Rectal examination may be diagnostic, and sometimes the rectum will
barely admit the examining ﬁnger. If the rectum is empty, consider high
impaction. In a thin patient, high impaction is unlikely if the loaded colon
cannot be felt during abdominal examination. In more obese subjects a
plain abdominal X-ray will be necessary to conﬁrm high impaction, but is
insensitive in the very obese.
2Do not exclude constipation as the cause of faecal incontinence until
there has been an adequate therapeutic trial for high faecal impaction.

Causes
• Reduced motility of the bowel: drugs (eg opiates, iron, anticholinergics,
antidepressants, antipsychotics, calcium channel blockers, calcium
preparations), immobility, constitutional illness, electrolyte
disturbances, dehydration, hypothyroidism, lack of dietary ﬁbre,
hypercalcaemia
• Failure to evacuate the bowels fully: any painful condition of the rectum
or anus, difﬁculty in access to the toilet, lack of privacy, altered daily
routine
• Neuromuscular: Parkinson’s disease, diabetic neuropathy pseudoobstruction
• Mechanical obstruction of the bowel: carcinoma of the colon, diverticular
disease

CONSTIPATION

Prevention and treatment
Precipitating causes such as dehydration, hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia,
and drugs should be identiﬁed and reversed.
Non-pharmacological measures including regular exercise, improving
access to the toilet, adequate dietary ﬁbre, and adequate hydration are
effective.
Laxatives should be used in combination with non-pharmacological
measures. Unless there are reversible factors, always prescribe regular
laxatives. Waiting for constipation to occur, then using ‘prn’ doses is far
less effective. You will need to titrate the laxative dose with time and
changing patient circumstances.
There is little good evidence to guide the choice of laxative, and
prescription varies with geography and personal choice. Here are some
guiding principles:
• Stimulant laxatives such as senna (1–4 tablets/day) or bisacodyl
(5–20mg/day), or stimulant suppositories, may be appropriate for those
with bulky, soft faecal overloading
• Avoid stimulant laxatives in patients with hard rocks of faeces as this
may produce abdominal pain. Use a stool softening (osmotic) laxative
instead such as lactulose (10–40mL/day) or a macrogol
• Long-term use of stimulant laxatives has been said to cause ‘bowel
tolerance’/neuronal damage leading to a dilated, atonic colon that
required even more laxatives. There is very little evidence to support
this, and stimulant laxatives are now considered safe, in moderate
doses, for long-term use1
• Sometimes stimulant and osmotic laxatives are used in combination,
typically in severe constipation (eg opiate-induced) that has been
unresponsive to a single drug
• Stool bulking agents such as methylcellulose or ispaghula are useful in
prophylaxis, but are less effective in treating established constipation;
both ﬁbre and other bulking agents will increase stool volume and may
increase problems
• Costs of laxatives vary enormously, and there is no correlation
between cost and patient acceptability. Try cheaper preparations ﬁrst
(ﬁbre, senna)
Faecal retention severe enough to cause incontinence nearly always needs
a determined effort to clear the colon (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Treat “overﬂow” faecal incontinence’, p.545).

372

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Diverticular disease
Narrow-necked pockets of colonic mucosa which occur adjacent to blood
vessel penetrations of the muscle bands, like ‘blow outs’ on a tyre. Occur
anywhere in large bowel but most commonly in the sigmoid.
• Rare in <40 years, increasing frequency with age and almost universal
>85 years
• Cause: thought to be raised intraluminal pressure due to low ﬁbre
Western diet
• Investigation: colonoscopy/ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema
are usually diagnostic and rule out other pathology. CT colography
(abdominal CT with oral contrast) is increasingly used as a better
tolerated test in the frail elderly
2The majority of cases are asymptomatic the majority of the time. On
other occasions innocent diverticulae are blamed for symptoms that arise
from other pathology, eg constipation, irritable bowel disease, or gastroenteritis. The previous diagnosis of diverticular disease should not stop
the careful evaluation of new bowel symptoms to exclude important diagnoses such as colitis or cancer.
Pain may occur, and especially if associated with constipation, can
be improved by a high ﬁbre diet with or without extra stool bulking drugs
(eg ispaghula 1 sachet/day).

Complications
Diverticulitis
Should be thought of as ‘left-sided appendicitis’. Infection occurs within a
pocket and may be due to a faecolith blocking the neck so avoiding constipation is key to prevention. Abdominal pain and tenderness, diarrhoea,
and vomiting occur with fever and raised inﬂammatory markers. Treat
with antibiotics (include anaerobic cover)—mild cases oral antibiotics at
home, severe cases may need admission for iv rehydration, antibiotics, and
liaison with surgical services.
Haemorrhage
Selective angiography can be used to demonstrate bleeding point.
Diverticular abscess
Ultrasound or CT for diagnosis and radiographically guided drainage under
local anaesthesia.
Perforation/peritonitis
See b ‘The “acute surgical abdomen” ’, p.380.
Fistula
Most commonly to bladder causing urinary infection and bubbles in urine
(pneumaturia). Cystoscopy or CT scan for diagnosis. Surgery is required
but simple defunctioning colostomy is often sufﬁcient.

DIVERTICULAR DISEASE

HOW TO . . . Image the older colon
This requires careful consideration of the risk and discomfort of a test,
balanced against the quality of the information obtained. Discussing the
pros and cons of each investigation with the patients and/or relatives will
often help. It is useful to clarify that a patient is ﬁt for bowel preparation
on the request form if relevant.
• Flexible sigmoidoscopy is safe and generally well tolerated,
requiring only an enema in preparation, allowing direct visualization
and biopsy of rectal and lower colonic pathology. Sedation is usually
not needed
• Colonoscopy allows direct imaging and biopsy of more of the colon,
and is the preferred method for general population investigation, but
carries an increased risk of bowel perforation in the over 75s. Full
bowel clearance and sedation are required
• CT colonography involves using a CT scanner to produce two- and
three-dimensional images of the colon, which are interpreted by a
radiologist. This requires full bowel clearance and air insufﬂation
during the procedure, both of which can be difﬁcult for frailer
old people. It is less invasive than colonoscopy and equivalent for
detection of lesions of a reasonable size. The technique is improving
all the time, and is the investigation of choice for patients >75 who
are able to tolerate full bowel clearance
• Minimal preparation CT colon involves ingestion of a contrast
agent 48–72hr before the scan, which then tags the faecal matter,
and removes the need for bowel clearance. It is therefore a better
investigation for frailer patients, although it misses smaller lesions
• Plain CT abdomen has reasonable sensitivity for large colonic
lesions, may reveal other pathologies, and requires no bowel
preparation. It is therefore useful in emergency assessment, or where
the pathology is not clearly colonic
• Barium enema requires bowel clearance and is less sensitive than
CT colonography, so is becoming less frequently used

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Inﬂammatory bowel disease
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease are chronic, relapsing conditions
caused by inﬂammation of the bowel wall. Inﬂammatory bowel disease
is idiopathic and has an increasing incidence in the population as a whole.
Initial presentation is usually in adolescence but there is a second peak of
incidence in older patients. Diarrhoea and urgency in this age group can be
particularly disabling and may result in incontinence and social isolation.

Features
• Diarrhoea (often with blood), malaise, weight loss, and abdominal
pain. Delayed presentation may result from embarrassment or fear of
cancer. Delayed diagnosis more common in elderly because symptoms
are ascribed to one of the common differential diagnoses such as
diverticular disease, CDAD, colonic carcinoma, and ischaemic colitis
• Associated conditions include arthritis, iritis, sclerosing cholangitis,
ankylosing spondylitis, and skin disorders (pyoderma gangrenosum,
erythema nodosum)
• Complications include thromboembolism, malabsorption and
malnutrition, perforation, stenosis with obstruction, ﬁstula formation,
and colonic and biliary malignancy

Investigations
• Exclude infection with stool culture and examination for ova, cysts, and
parasites and Clostridium toxin (if in hospital or recent antibiotics)
• ESR and CRP are usually elevated but may be normal in localized
disease
• A normochromic normocytic anaemia is common, but if there is
excessive bleeding iron deﬁciency can develop
• Plain X-rays are usually normal but contrast studies are often diagnostic
• Sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy and biopsy have high diagnostic yield

Treatment
Conﬁrmed cases are best managed by gastroenterologists who have
specialist nurses and dieticians working with them. Treatment in older
patients is not greatly different and is aimed at obtaining and then maintaining remission. There are many new treatments (eg ciclosporin, infliximab) which are beyond the scope of this text. Some principles for
treating elderly include:
• Exacerbations of distal colitis are usually treated with topical
mesalazine and steroids given as enemas—this may be impractical in
older patients unless a carer can help and oral steroids can be a better
option
• Budesonide is a steroid with high topical potency (poor absorption
and rapid ﬁrst pass metabolism) so equivalent doses cause fewer side
effects
• Side effects, drug interactions, and polypharmacy may be more
problematic in older patients, eg always consider bisphosphonates with
oral steroids therapy
• Look for and treat proximal constipation which can impair the efﬁcacy
of treatment of a distal colitis

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE

• Oral 5-aminosalicylic acid preparations (eg slow-release mesalazine)
are often successful (for exacerbations and maintenance) and well
tolerated
• The risk of malignancy is higher the longer the patient has active
disease so theoretically many older patients should be under
surveillance by a gastroenterologist. Unfortunately the risk of colonic
perforation during colonoscopic screening is higher in the elderly
population so many screening programmes stop at age 75
• For failure of medical management elective colectomy is well tolerated
and may give the best quality of life. In contrast emergency surgery in
older patients has high mortality

375

376

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Diarrhoea in older patients
Acute
Short-lived bouts of diarrhoea are commonly due to viral gastroenteritis.
Supportive management (rehydration, light diet) is usually sufﬁcient for
this self-limiting condition. It can spread rapidly in institutions (especially
if due to norovirus—responsible for much of the so-called ‘winter vomiting’) and appropriate infection control measures should be put in place.
In frail, hospitalized patients, especially with recent antibiotic exposure,
consider CDAD earlier rather than later.
If diarrhoea persists, always send samples for culture, ova, cysts, and
parasites, and C. difﬁcile toxin (see b ‘Clostridium difﬁcile-associated
diarrhoea’, p.614).

Chronic
There is a group of elderly people who have chronic or recurring episodes of diarrhoea that merit active investigation—untreated they suffer
high morbidity (especially if diarrhoea induces faecal incontinence) and
many causes are treatable. See b ‘HOW TO . . . Investigate and manage
chronic diarrhoea’, p.377 for a suggested plan of investigation.

Malabsorption
Patients do not always have diarrhoea. Look for low BMI and falling weight
despite reasonable oral calorie intake. Biochemical markers of malnutrition eg hypoalbuminaemia may be present. Anaemia is caused by malabsorption of iron, B12, or folate and is therefore microcytic, macrocytic, or
normocytic.
The common causes of malabsorption in older patients often coexist
and include:
• Coeliac disease/gluten sensitive enteropathy
• Peak incidence age 50 but can manifest for the ﬁrst time in old age
with weight loss, bone pain (osteoporosis), fatigue (anaemia), and
mouth ulcers
• Duodenal biopsy should be performed in all who present with iron
deﬁciency undergoing endoscopy
• Anti-endomysial or tissue transglutaminase antibodies have very
high speciﬁcity (100%) and reasonable sensitivity (around 85%).
False negatives can occur with low IgA so always check serum
immunoglobulins at the same time
• Pancreatic insufﬁciency can occur without history of pancreatitis,
alcoholism, or gallstones. Request a faecal elastase—a low level
supports pancreatic insufﬁciency
• Bile salt malabsorption. Ileal resection or disease allows bile salts to
reach colon which causes diarrhoea
• Bacterial overgrowth is particularly common in any person with
anatomical abnormality of gut (eg post-gastrectomy, small bowel
diverticula) but can also occur with normal gut architecture

DIARRHOEA IN OLDER PATIENTS

HOW TO . . . Investigate and manage chronic diarrhoea
Diagnoses to consider in the elderly population include:
• Inﬂammatory bowel disease
• Malabsorption
• Colonic tumour
• Diverticular disease
• Chronic infections
• Constipation with overﬂow diarrhoea
• Drugs—many drugs can cause diarrhoea; review the list and stop
any that may be implicated. Common culprits include laxatives,
antibiotics, bisphosphonates, NSAIDs, and PPIs

History
Ask about foreign travel, antibiotic exposure, full drug history, previous
gut surgery/pancreatitis, family history of inﬂammatory bowel disease.
Ask patient or carer to make a record of stool frequency/texture.

Examination
Abdominal and digital rectal examination. If rectum is loaded be highly
suspicious of overﬂow diarrhoea.

Investigations
• Stool: culture, C. difﬁcile toxin, ova, cysts, and parasites
• Blood tests: FBC (anaemia) haematinics (iron, B12, folate deﬁciency)
endomysial antibodies and/or tissue transglutaminase antibodies (and
IgA levels), CRP, and ESR
• Radiology: plain AXR is rarely diagnostic (except unexpected, left
sided faecal loading)
• Sigmoidoscopy: biopsy in several places even if mucosa looks normal
to exclude microscopic colitis (see b ‘Other colonic conditions’,
p.378)
• More extensive colonic imaging may be needed (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Image the older colon’, p.373)

Treatment
Obviously depends on cause but in patients in whom diagnosis is not
clear and they are not ﬁt for, or refuse, more complex investigations
there is a place for a trial of empirical treatment. One such strategy is at
least 2 week trials of:
• Metronidazole (for overgrowth/diverticular disease)

• Pancreatin, eg Creon® (pancreatic disease)
• Bile acid sequestrants, eg colestyramine (bile salt malabsorption)
• Steroids (for colitis)
Pick the most likely or try each in turn for a few weeks.

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Other colonic conditions
Irritable bowel syndrome
A chronic, non-inﬂammatory condition characterized by abdominal pain,
altered bowel habit (diarrhoea or constipation), and abdominal bloating,
but with no identiﬁable structural or biochemical disorder.
• New onset is rare in older age and this diagnosis should not be made
‘de novo’ in older patients without very careful exclusion of structural
disease (particularly colonic tumours and diverticulitis)
• Lifelong sufferers may continue with symptoms in later life but if the
symptoms change the patient should also undergo investigations
• Pain or diarrhoea that wakes a patient at night, blood in stool, weight
loss, or fever are NEVER features of irritable bowel syndrome
• Some drugs used to treat irritable bowel syndrome (eg tricyclic
antidepressants) are less well tolerated in older patients. Mebeverine
might be better tolerated for spasm
• Dietary advice should be given (low ﬁbre for bloating or wind, high
ﬁbre for diarrhoea or constipation, exclude exacerbating foods)
• Stool bulking drugs can be useful for constipation
• Loperamide or codeine can be used for disabling diarrhoea

Angiodysplasia
Tiny capillary malformations (like spider naevi) that can occur anywhere in
the gut are important only because they bleed.
• Slow blood loss leads to unexplained recurrent iron deﬁciency
anaemia, brisk loss may produce life-threatening haemorrhage
• Unless they are inherited in a syndrome (eg hereditary haemorrhagic
telangiectasia) they are acquired and therefore have increased
prevalence with age (most cases aged over 70)
• Asymptomatic angiodysplasia in older patients is common. Diagnosis
is often by exclusion of other causes of iron deﬁciency anaemia. Many
patients are reinvestigated for recurrent anaemia, and the absence of
sinister features over a period of time with no demonstrated pathology
on standard tests may suggest angiodysplasia is the cause
• Sometimes colonoscopy can visualize lesions (which can then be
treated by diathermy) but CT does not reveal this pathology
• Selective mesenteric angiography can demonstrate lesions that are
actively and rapidly bleeding
• Tranexamic acid and oestrogens are sometimes successful in
controlling chronic blood loss

Microscopic colitis
Also known as collagenous or lymphocytic colitis. An idiopathic condition causing chronic or episodic watery, non-bloody diarrhoea but with
no gross structural changes seen at colonoscopy.
• Biopsy changes are diagnostic with collagenous thickening of the
subepithelial layer and inﬁltration with lymphocytes
• Peak incidence in 50s
• There is no increased risk of cancer
• Keep treatment as simple as possible—start with diet and antidiarrhoeal drugs, mesalazine then steroids

OTHER COLONIC CONDITIONS

Intestinal ischaemia
There is a variety of presentations. Pain out of proportion to the abdominal
examination ﬁndings is common in these syndromes, and should always
make you consider them. An elevated lactate ± acidosis should alert you
to the possibility of dead bowel.
• Intestinal angina results from chronic arterial obstruction of the
coeliac axis or superior mesenteric artery. Epigastric pain occurs after
eating. Diagnosis is tricky as the pain is similar to peptic ulcer pain
but angiography is diagnostic. Treat with antiplatelet agents. Vascular
reconstruction or stenting may be useful
• Small bowel ischaemia results from mesenteric artery occlusion, often
by an embolus (more common in AF). There is acute colic with rectal
bleeding, followed by circulatory collapse. Laparotomy is required, but
outcome is poor
• Ischaemic colitis is an underdiagnosed cause of acute diarrhoea ± blood
in dehydrated, hypotensive elderly patients with vascular disease. Often
self-limiting if volume depletion corrected and the bowel is rested. May
result in colonic stricture
• Colonic gangrene occurs after profound hypotension typically in older
ITU patients with heart failure and sepsis. Laparotomy and colectomy is
required, but fatality is high

379

380

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

The ‘acute surgical abdomen’
2Peritonitis/perforation often presents in a non-speciﬁc way. Patients
often present to medicine rather than surgery. The diagnosis is easily
missed so always have a high index of suspicion and examine the abdomen
carefully and repeatedly in sick elderly patients without a diagnosis.
Common causes in older patients include:
• Complications of diverticular disease
• First presentation of tumour (gut, pancreatic)
• Ischaemic bowel (emboli in patients with AF)
• Strangulated hernias (always remember groin examination)
• Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm
• Duodenal ulcer perforation (becoming less common)
• Biliary stones/sepsis (stones) and pancreatitis
• Appendicitis

Signs
Peritonitis/perforation may not have guarding or rigidity, particularly in the
very old, those on steroids, or people with diabetes. Lack of bowel sounds
can be helpful. Signs may develop with time, so repeated assessments are
mandatory.

Investigations
Erect CXR can reveal air under the diaphragm (this is sometimes the only
indication of a ‘silent’ perforation). Ultrasound or CT imaging will often
reveal the cause.

Management
Always involve the surgical team even where patient is unsuitable for
operation as they can advise on conservative management and occasionally an ‘interval’ procedure is appropriate (eg gallstone surgery once
cholecystitis has settled).
2Ensure that surgical decisions are made on the basis of frailty and
co-morbidity, or occasionally on an informed, competent patient decision and not just age alone. Aim to achieve a senior medical, surgical and
anaesthetic consensus.
Medical management involves:
• Broad-spectrum iv antibiotics
• Resting the bowel (nil by mouth, NG tube if vomiting)
• Careful monitoring of ﬂuid balance—heart failure from ﬂuid overload
or renal failure from dehydration are often the mechanisms of death.
A urinary catheter and central venous pressure monitoring are
sometimes necessary.
• Consider prophylactic low molecular weight heparin
It is surprising how often patients survive with conservative measures so
continue to monitor the patient and adjust treatment carefully. Once the
signs/symptoms recede try to get the patient eating, on oral antibiotics,
and mobilizing as soon as possible to avoid the complications of malnutrition, pressure sores, VTE and C. difﬁcile colitis which may be more lethal
than the initial peritonitis.

OBSTRUCTED BOWEL IN OLDER PATIENTS

Obstructed bowel in older patients
As with peritonitis this often presents in a non-speciﬁc or non-dramatic
way. Common causes in older patients include:
• Constipation
• Colonic tumours
• Sigmoid volvulus
• Strangulated hernias (remember to examine groins)
• Adhesions (look for old abdominal scars)
• Complications of diverticular disease (abscess, localized perforation,
stricture)

Signs
Consider excluding obstruction (with plain X-ray) in any patient with
persistent vomiting and/or abdominal bloating (ask the patient if their
tummy is a normal size for them). Pain/colic, absence of defaecation, tinkling bowel sounds, and gastric splash are helpful when present (but often
absent). Always examine the groins in both sexes for obstructed herniae.

Investigations
Plain AXR shows dilated bowel—standing AXRs have ﬂuid levels but are
often impractical in older patients and rarely add diagnostic information
to a supine ﬁlm. Ultrasound or CT imaging may localize a cause. Contrast
radiology and gastroscopy are sometimes useful.

Management
Always involve the surgical team who can advise on diagnosis and conservative management, eg insertion of a ﬂatus tube for sigmoid volvulus.
General management usually involves:
• Resting the bowel (nil by mouth and wide-bore NG tube).
• Careful monitoring of ﬂuid balance—heart failure from ﬂuid overload
or renal failure from dehydration are often the mechanisms of death.
• Consider broad-spectrum antibiotics if there is fever or features of
coexistent perforation.
• Consider prophylactic low molecular weight heparin
Where conservative management fails and an operation is necessary, less
invasive/palliative procedures are often more appropriate (eg defunctioning colostomy rather than anterior resection).
Pseudo-obstruction presents with vomiting and dilated bowel on X-ray
but is due to an atonic bowel so bowel sounds are absent or decreased
rather than increased. Frail, older, immobile, debilitated patients are more
at risk. Can occur with electrolyte abnormality (especially low potassium),
postsurgery, with drugs (eg opiates, anticholinergics), in neurological
disease (eg Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s) or any severe illness (eg septicaemia). Supportive care with hydration and bowel rest is needed, along
with correction of the underlying abnormality. Often resolves with this
approach, but decompression or surgery are occasionally needed.

381

382

CHAPTER 12

Gastroenterology

Obesity in older people
In developed countries, there is a general increase in body weight and
BMI until about 60 years of age, after which both tend to decline. The
body composition also changes, with an increasing proportion of intraabdominal fat.
Weight gain in older people usually relates to a reduction in activity
and falling basal metabolic rate rather than an alteration in calorie intake
(which actually tends to get lower with age).
The ideal body mass for an elderly person has not been established,
although it is probably higher than that for a younger person.

Impact of obesity
The relationship between mortality and obesity in older people has not
been established. The following should be considered:
• Weight loss has been reported to increase, not alter, or decrease
mortality—but all the studies have methodological problems, and
weight loss is a marker of underlying disease which may be occult
• Those with chronic disabilities and diseases will reduce activity more
than ﬁt older people, and so may gain weight more easily
• In care home residents, only morbid obesity is clearly associated with
an increase in mortality. In addition care homes may need special
equipment (eg wider frames, wheelchairs) to allow for their care
• Obesity will increase morbidity from conditions such as arthritis and
diabetes and increase cardiovascular risk
• Obese older people are more likely to have mobility problems and
their quadriceps strength to weight ratio is key to standing ability
• Frailty is certainly associated with increased mortality, but this relates
to much more than just weight

Treatment
The goal of treating obesity in older people is to reduce weight without
losing lean mass or contributing to frailty—excessive weight loss in elderly
people is associated with an increase in mortality.
In the very old, there is little to be gained from altering a lifelong dietary
and exercise habit where there are few complications from obesity, but
younger patients (60s and 70s) with diabetes or vascular disease may
beneﬁt greatly from healthier eating habits.
• Increased physical activity is the mainstay of treatment. This may
increase energy expenditure and promote weight loss, improve muscle
strength and stamina, reduce intra-abdominal fat and promote a feeling
of well-being
• Calorie restriction should be undertaken with caution, and include at
least 800kcal/day with good ﬂuid intake
• Remember to stop supplements in patients who have a high BMI
• Drugs to enhance weight loss are rarely useful (risk > beneﬁt),
although inhibitors of fat absorption (eg orlistat) may be useful in
people with diabetes
• Gastric surgery is higher risk in older obese people, and not frequently
undertaken

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

The ageing kidney
Kidney function tends to decline with age, but unless there is additional
disease, function is usually sufﬁcient to remove waste and to regulate
volume and electrolyte balance; it is only when stressed that lack of renal
reserve becomes apparent. The relative contribution of cumulative exposure to risk factors (extrinsic ageing), disease acquisition (often occult) and
intrinsic ageing is unknown, but not all the changes described are universal
in an older population.

Falling renal reserve
Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) falls steadily after the age of 40 in most
healthy older people, possibly due to the following age-related changes:
• Rise in blood pressure within the normal range
• Numbers of glomeruli fall (750% fewer age 70 than age 30)
• Increase in sclerotic glomeruli
Renal blood ﬂow decreases by around 10% per decade (cortex more than
medulla, leading to patchy cortical defects on renal scans).
Lower GFR and renal blood ﬂow are the major causes of reduced renal
reserve, with the following clinical implications:
• Renally excreted substances are likely to be retained longer
(especially drugs) making prescription amendments necessary
(see b ‘Pharmacology in older patients’, p.126)
• Reduced threshold for damage with ischaemia or nephrotoxins
The normal range for plasma urea and creatinine does not change with
age. However, as production of urea and creatinine decreases with falling
body muscle mass, renal function is often substantially diminished in an
older person, even with apparently normal blood chemistry.
2GFR is a better estimate of renal function than plasma urea and creatinine (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Estimate the glomerular ﬁltration rate’,
p.393)

Blunted ﬂuid and electrolyte homeostasis
The following changes occur with age:
• A blunted response to sodium loading and depletion, so equilibrium is
achieved more slowly
• Reduced ability to dilute and concentrate urine (falls 5% every decade)
• Lower renin and aldosterone levels (30–50% less than young people)
• Loss of the sensation of thirst, even when plasma tonicity is high
(reasons unclear—may relate to altered baroreceptor function, dry
mouths or altered mental capacity)
• Reduced response to vasopressin
• In addition, many commonly prescribed drugs interfere with renal
function (diuretics, NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors, lithium, sedatives, etc.)
Hyponatraemia is therefore common (low sodium intake combined with
renal sodium wasting), but in times of acute illness (increased ﬂuid demand
and decreased intake) the slower adaptive mechanisms make hypernatraemic dehydration more common.

THE AGEING KIDNEY

Hypokalaemia is common because of poor intake and frequent diuretic
use, but lower GFR and hypoaldosteronism lead to a vulnerability to
hyperkalaemia especially when exacerbating drugs (NSAIDs, spironolactone,
ACE inhibitors) are used.

Structural changes
• Renal mass falls by 20–30% between 30 and 90 years, making kidneys
appear smaller on ultrasound scanning, without necessarily implying
disease
• Distal nephrons develop diverticulae (3 per tubule by age 90) that may
become retention cysts (benign ﬁnding in older people)

Other changes
• Renal 1-hydroxylase activity decreases with age leading to decreased
vitamin D production. Combined with low phosphate intake, this can
mildly elevate parathyroid hormone levels
• There is a loss of the circadian rhythm, owing to altered sodium
handling and patterns of aldosterone secretion, so that over the age of
60 the proportion of water, sodium, and potassium excretion occurring
at night increases, causing nocturia

385

386

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Acute kidney injury
Previous called acute renal failure. This is more common in older people,
but with a similar prognosis if occurring de novo and treated correctly.
2Do not deny treatment based on age alone—even anuric patients can
make a full recovery

Causes
80% of cases of acute kidney injury (AKI) are caused by pre-renal failure
and ATN (acute tubular necrosis).

Pre-renal causes
Due to poor renal perfusion. May be caused by:
• Dehydration (commonly associated with sepsis)
• Volume loss (eg bleeding, over-diuresis)
• Volume redistribution (eg with low serum albumin)
• Poor cardiac output (eg post-MI)
• Aggravated by many drugs (eg diuretics, ACE inhibitors, NSAIDs)
Older patients are prone to sepsis, have less capacity to maintain circulating volume in the face of stress and are more likely to be on aggravating medications, making this a very common problem (eg urinary sepsis
in a patient taking diuretics and NSAIDs can often cause pre-renal renal
impairment, and responds well to antibiotics, ﬂuids, and drug cessation).
2All unwell elderly patients should have renal function checked routinely
and repeatedly. Consider stopping diuretics and ACE inhibitors during an
acute illness.

Renal causes
Due to direct damage to the kidney. Commonly ATN, which may be:
• Ischaemic (occurs when pre-renal failure is not corrected quickly,
eg with sepsis, surgical procedures, prolonged hypotension, etc.)
• Nephrotoxic (usually medication such as aminoglycoside antibiotics,
eg gentamicin)
• Due to pigment deposition (eg myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis,
See b ‘Rhabdomyolysis’, p.505)
Not all renal failure is ATN. Other (rarer) causes include:
• Glomerulonephritis—diffuse inﬂammatory change to glomeruli with
resulting haematuria and red cell casts
• Acute interstitial nephritis—consider drug induced nephritis. May have
ﬂank pain, rash, fever, eosinophilia, and urine white blood cells/casts
but consider if new drug recently even in absence of these features
These less common causes are important because they are often responsive to speciﬁc treatment (usually steroids). The patient should be
assessed by a renal physician promptly and often need a biopsy.

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY

Post-renal causes
• Obstruction of the renal tract at some point, eg prostatic enlargement,
renal stones, urethral strictures, pelvic tumours
• Ultrasound scan shows a dilated collecting system
• These conditions are all more common in older people, and are very
responsive to treatment if found early, often with full recovery of renal
function

387

388

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Acute kidney injury: management
Is this acute kidney injury?
Older people are more likely to have underlying chronic kidney disease
(CKD), and this confers a worse prognosis. Check old notes, ask the
patient, family, and GP about history, and look back at blood test results.
Generally, management does not differ signiﬁcantly from younger patients.

Investigations
• See Table 13.1
• Treat cause
Older people respond as well to most treatments

Monitor meticulously
• Pulse and blood pressure, cardiac monitor, input (iv and oral) and
output (urine, faecal matter, vomit, drains, sweat)
• May be best done on HDU
• Aim for euvolaemia (assessed clinically may need to correct deﬁcit)
then maintain by matching input to output on an hourly basis initially
• Fluid balance is likely to be harder in older people because of
comorbidity (especially heart failure)
2The presence of peripheral oedema does not necessarily indicate ﬂuid
overload. Circulating volume is best assessed by blood pressure, pulse,
JVP, and skin turgor (see b ‘Challenges to volume status assessment in
elderly patients’, p.405)
• May need central venous catheter and urinary catheter initially, but
remove as soon as possible because of infection risk
• Document daily weight and total ﬂuid balance summary
• Be prepared for polyuria in the recovery phase, and ensure that the
patient does not become ﬂuid depleted

Treat complications
Importantly hyperkalaemia, acidosis, and pulmonary oedema.
Refer early for further renal support (ﬁltration or dialysis) a patient can
remain oliguric for some time while renal recovery is occurring, but it
is sensible to make the relevant teams aware of a potential patient. The
indications for renal replacement therapy are as follows:
• Refractory pulmonary oedema (older people are particularly prone to
this after over enthusiastic initial ﬂuid replacement)
• Persistent hyperkalaemia (K >7 mmol/L) that cannot be controlled by
insulin/glucose infusions and iv calcium
• Worsening acidosis (pH <7.2)
• Uraemic pericarditis
• Uraemic encephalopathy

ACUTE KIDNEY INJURY: MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Perform a ﬂuid challenge in AKI/anuria
Many older patients are clearly dehydrated with mildly impaired renal
function tests and these patients can be simply rehydrated orally or
parenterally.
If the patient presents with established AKI or is found to be anuric
despite simple rehydration then a ﬂuid challenge should be contemplated.
This is an important clinical skill to develop and requires advanced clinical
acumen and an investment of time. The key is an accurate assessment of
ﬂuid status with the aim of rendering the patient euvolaemic.
A urinary catheter is needed and a central venous pressure monitoring
device is helpful if facilities exist.
• Start by assessing and clearly documenting baseline ﬂuid status as this
will inform your management and will be helpful when the patient is
reassessed
• If the patient is already ﬂuid overloaded then a single bolus of iv loop
diuretic and early contact with the renal specialist team is need
• If the patient appears to be hypovolaemic, give 500mL of normal
saline (sodium bicarbonate may be considered if they are profoundly
acidotic) over 30–60min and review
• If the patient appears to be euvolaemic then the ﬂuid challenge
should be more cautious. Give 100mL bolus intravenously and review
after about 15min
• For the review repeat and document the ﬂuid status and urine
output. Repeat this cycle of ﬂuid prescription and do a careful review
as the clinical progression becomes clear

389

390

Rationale

Special points in older people

Elevated in renal failure

Elderly people with very little muscle mass will have lower baseline
levels, so a urea of 10 in a small elderly woman will represent signiﬁcant
renal impairment
Urea: creatinine ratio can be useful—elevated in pre-renal and postrenal failure, acting as a marker of dehydration or obstruction

Electrolytes

Potassium rises dangerously in ARF

More prone to cardiac complications of electrolyte disturbance—
monitor carefully

Arterial blood gases

Monitor pH which falls in ARF

pH can also be checked on a venous sample

Inﬂammatory
markers (ESR, CRP,
white cell count)

Check for infection

Common precipitant of ARF in older people (may be occult)

Urine dipstick

Check for leucocytes and nitrites (infection) blood and
protein (active renal lesion likely)

High rate of positive urine dipstick in older people—does not always
imply infection

Urine microscopy

Looking for casts (red cell casts in glomerulonephritis,
white cell casts in infection etc.) and blood cells

Always send for culture, even when the dipstick is negative

Blood and urine
cultures

Identify microbes

Ensure these are sent on all patients (who may have occult infection)
prior to starting antibiotics

Renal medicine

CHAPTER 13

Table 13.1 Acute renal failure—investigations

Creatinine kinase

Elevated in rhabdomyolysis

Always check after falls (especially after a long period on the ﬂoor
before being found). Even if there is not full blown rhabdomyolysis, an
elevated CK level indicates the need for hydration and monitoring of
renal function

Urinary sodium

Helps distinguish between pre-renal failure (urinary
Na <20 mmol/L as kidney still functioning to preserve
sodium) and ATN (urinary Na >40 mmol/L as kidney
not functioning, so losing Na)

Particularly useful in older people where clinical assessment of ﬂuid
balance may be harder because of peripheral oedema etc.

CXR

Looking for evidence of cardiac disease, source of
infection, pulmonary oedema or pulmonary inﬁltrates
(vasculitis)

More prone to pulmonary oedema—extra caution with ﬂuid
replacement if there is cardiomegaly, even where there is no history of
cardiac failure

ECG

Looking for evidence of cardiac disease

Again alerts to occult cardiac disease if ECG is abnormal

Not helpful if the patient has taken diuretics (increase sodium
excretion)

Renal ultrasound

Assess renal size and look for evidence of
hydronephrosis

Other tests

All should have FBC and LFTs
Usually also send autoantibodies (ANA, antineutrophilic
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)), immunoglobulins,
complement and electrophoresis of blood and urine

Very useful in older people to help establish if renal failure is truly
acute (small kidneys with chronic failure). Also checks for treatable
obstructive causes—common in this age group

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Chronic kidney disease
CKD is a substantial, irreversible, longstanding, and usually progressive
loss in renal function. CKD is more common in older people (incidence
in the over 75s is 10 times higher than in the under 40s). Half of all renal
replacement therapy is now started for patients >65 years and this underestimates the burden of renal impairment, as the majority will die with,
and not of, renal failure, many never encountering a renal physician.
Much renal impairment is discovered incidentally by ﬁnding elevated
urea and creatinine levels. Many labs now quote an estimated glomerular
ﬁltration rate (eGFR), which is highlighting the prevalence of early stage
renal impairment. There are adaptive mechanisms that maintain reasonable
health with failing renal function until severe damage has occurred (GFR
of 10–15 mL/min).

Causes
Common causes include hypertension, diabetes, obstruction (usually due
to prostatic enlargement), glomerulonephritis, and renovascular disease.
A signiﬁcant proportion presenting late remains idiopathic.

Management
When abnormal renal function is discovered, ﬁrstly consider the circumstances is the patient acutely unwell? Are they being over-diuresed?
Correct all of remediable factors, and recheck renal function in a stable
clinical state. If it remains deranged, then:
• Estimate the GFR (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Estimate the glomerular
ﬁltration rate’, p.393). Consider checking GFR even when creatinine is
within normal range for older patient with a low body weight
• Identify and treat any modiﬁable factors (eg diabetes, hypertension, and
obstructive uropathy)
• Delay disease progression by controlling diabetes and hypertension
and by using an ACE inhibitor (or an ARB). Low-protein diets, lipid
lowering, and correcting anaemia may also help
• Avoid exacerbating factors such as volume depletion, intravenous
contrast, urinary obstruction and nephrotoxic drugs
• Review drug treatment, some are better stopped (eg metformin) and
others need dose adjusting (eg digoxin)
• Identify and treat complications as they arise (see b ‘Chronic kidney
disease: complications’, p.394)
• Try to establish the rate of decline, using previous creatinine
measurements. Deterioration tends to be steady and so it is often
possible to estimate when interventions are likely to be needed
• Prepare for the end-stage. A frail old person with limited life
expectancy and moderate impairment is likely to die of other causes
before complex renal issues become a problem. Most other patients
beneﬁt from early renal specialist review (ie when impairment is
moderate to severe) to clarify diagnosis, optimize management
and discuss renal replacement therapy. Late referral for dialysis is
associated with a poor outcome

CHRONIC KIDNEY DISEASE

HOW TO . . . Estimate the glomerular ﬁltration rate
Although elevated urea and creatinine levels often alert the clinician to
renal impairment, they give a poor estimate of extent, as the levels are
determined by many factors as well as GFR, eg creatinine is directly
related to muscle mass, which tends to fall with age meaning that:
• A small rise in urea and creatinine in an elderly person is signiﬁcant,
and should be taken seriously
• A creatinine within the normal range may represent renal failure in a
small old patient
GFR is a better measure of renal function, but requires a 24-hr urine
collection which can be tricky in older people. Creatinine clearance
approximates GFR and can be estimated using various equations.
The Cockcroft-Gault formula is the best known:
Creatinine clearance = [(140 – age in years) × weight in kilograms]
plasma creatinine (μmol/L) x 0.82
This ﬁgure needs to be reduced slightly for women.
It can be seen that a patient of 80, weighing 50kg with a creatinine of
140 will have an estimated GFR of 26 (ie severe failure). Another patient
of 30, weighing 70kg with a creatinine of 140, however, will have an
estimated GFR of 67 (ie mild failure).
eGFR should be used in calculating dose adjustments for certain
drugs, eg gentamicin, low molecular weight heparin.
Using this derived ﬁgure, renal impairment has been classiﬁed by the
Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) and this acts as a
guide for management (Table 13.2).

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Chronic kidney disease: complications
Hypertension
• Can occur at any point in the disease and is a cause and a consequence
of CKD
• Monitor blood pressure regularly in all patients
• Treat with an ACE inhibitor (preserves renal function)

Hyperlipidaemia
• May contribute to renal damage
• Treat with a statin

Atherosclerosis
• Accelerated atheroma occurs with renal impairment
• Ensure that all vascular risk factors are addressed

Salt and water retention
• Onset with moderate impairment
• Consider loop diuretics for oedema (eg furosemide high doses may be
required, but start low and increase as needed)
• Restrict dietary salt intake (ideally <2g/day)
• Fluid restriction may be necessary with more severe renal impairment

Secondary hyperparathyroidism
• Onset usually with moderate impairment
• Low calcium, high phosphate, low vitamin D and appropriately high
parathyroid hormone (PTH)
• Ensure calcium, phosphate, and PTH are checked
• Consider dietary phosphate restriction (milk, cheese, eggs, etc.),
phosphate binders (eg calcium carbonate), calcium supplements, and
vitamin D analogues (eg alfacalcidol) if there is a problem
• Risk of renal bone disease (renal osteodystrophy)

Anaemia
• Onset usually with moderate impairment
• Check for alternative causes of anaemia (iron deﬁciency, chronic
disease, etc.)
• If none found, consider erythropoietin injections to keep Hb >11g/dL
(usually initiated by renal physician)

Nervous system
• Onset with severe impairment
• Includes peripheral neuropathy, autonomic neuropathy and
encephalopathy

Acidosis and hyperkalaemia
• Onset with moderate or severe impairment
• Indicate need for renal replacement therapy, or plans for terminal care

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Renal replacement therapy: dialysis
This includes haemodialysis (usually done at a dialysis centre and accounting
for around 80% of dialysis in the older age group) and peritoneal dialysis
(mainly managed at home).

Survival
Older patients have a shorter survival on dialysis than younger patients,
probably because of an increase in complications (see b ‘Complications’,
p.396) yet still can expect a 20–40% ﬁve year survival (mean life expectancy 3–5 years).
Those aged over 80 on dialysis have a median survival of 26 months,
irrespective of the age at onset of treatment.

Effectiveness
• Some older patients may mistakenly be under-dialysed (low muscle
mass leads to lower urea and creatinine levels that do not reﬂect the
need for dialysis). In addition, dialysis sessions are more commonly
stopped early because of hypotension
• This adversely affects outcome. Using other means to calculate
dialysis frequency and optimising health with nutritional support,
erythropoietin (to keep Hb >12g/dL) and appropriate buffer selection
can vastly improve effectiveness in older people

Complications
In older people:
• Nausea, vomiting, and hypotension during dialysis are more common
(due to autonomic dysfunction and decreased cardiac reserve)
• Malnutrition occurs in up to 20%
• There is increased risk of infection (ageing immune system and
malnutrition), depression, and gastrointestinal bleeds (from uraemic
gastritis, diverticulosis, and angiodysplasia)

Quality of life
Many older patients on dialysis enjoy a high quality of life. They resent the
intrusion of visits to a dialysis centre less than younger patients and can
ﬁnd it offers positive social interaction. Many of this highly selected cohort
(frailer elderly patients with renal impairment are not appropriate for this
service) retain their independence with over 90% maintaining good community social contacts, and over 80% regularly going outdoors. Around
40% rate their health positively. However, for some it becomes tiring and
burdensome, especially if relying on hospital transport for attendance.

RENAL REPLACEMENT THERAPY: DIALYSIS

Who should be offered dialysis?
Dialysis is expensive, and the number of elderly people with end-stage
renal failure is large. Many elderly patients with end-stage renal failure elect
to have dialysis if offered, but offering it to all is not sensible or feasible.
It should not be offered to simply delay dying, rather used if the renal
failure is the main threat to continued survival. Severe dementia, advanced
malignancy (except possibly multiple myeloma), or advanced liver disease
generally makes dialysis inadvisable. Caution should be exercised before
offering dialysis to patients with severe heart or lung disease, or frail
patients with multiple comorbidities.

What next?
Many patients need to swap dialysis modalities for some reason. 40%
would like to proceed to transplant if an organ was available. The rate of
voluntary withdrawal (overall about 5%) increases with age and is usually
because of general dissatisfaction with life or the development of signiﬁcant
comorbidity (often cancer). Guidelines suggest that patients approaching
the end of their life should have input into an individual palliative care plan,
often in conjunction with palliative care services.

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Renal replacement therapy:
transplantation
This is the gold standard of renal replacement therapy for end-stage renal
failure, as it improves survival and quality of life when compared with
dialysis, as well as releasing the patient from the burden of regular dialysis sessions. It is also cost-effective, being cheaper than dialysis after the
ﬁrst year.
Transplant recipients are getting older (10% of transplants in 2002
were performed for patients over 65, compared with only 5% a decade
earlier) however, as the majority of end-stage failures occur in the elderly
population, this still represents an imbalance. Donated cadaver kidneys
are in short supply, and tend to be given to those who will get the
most use out of them namely younger patients with a longer natural life
expectancy.
The most common cause of graft failure in older people is death of the
host with a functioning graft. This is due to a number of factors:
• The most common cause of death after transplantation is
cardiovascular disease
• Older people have altered immune responses—this makes it less
likely that they will reject a donated kidney, and allows for modiﬁed
immunosuppressive medication. However, it also increases the risk of
serious infection
• Older people have increased side effects to immunosuppressive
medication particularly steroids
• Other common conditions make the transplant procedure more
complicated, eg peripheral vascular disease (technical surgical
problems), diverticular disease (predisposes to post-transplant
perforation) and cholelithiasis (predisposes to biliary sepsis)
There are limited outcome data for older patients, but:
• Patients >60 have a 70% 5-year survival post-transplantation compared
with >90% for younger patients although graft survival is equivalent
• Transplant carries a greater chance of survival than dialysis, in older as
in younger patients (around 10 years compared with six on dialysis for
those aged 60–74)
Each individual must be considered separately, taking into account biological and not chronological age. Careful screening for comorbidity will
reveal those most likely to beneﬁt, regardless of age. The use of older
donors for older recipients could partially redress the imbalance, as the
grafts themselves will have a limited lifespan and so be most appropriate
for an age-matched recipient. Live organ donation is a rapidly expanding
area which may improve kidney availability.

NEPHROTIC SYNDROME

Nephrotic syndrome
Increased glomerular permeability to protein causes proteinuria (>3g/
day), hypoalbuminaemia, generalized oedema, and hyperlipidaemia. There
is an increased susceptibility to infection, thrombosis, and renal failure.
More common in older people, but often missed as oedema may be
attributed to cardiac failure and a low serum albumin to poor nutrition.
2Always dipstick the urine for protein in an oedematous patient.

Causes
Membranous and minimal change nephropathy, glomerulonephritis,
and amyloid are common pathologies. Look for associated conditions,
including malignancy (eg carcinoma, lymphoma), infection (eg hepatitis B),
systemic disease (eg systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis,
chronic infection) and diabetes. NSAID use may be the only cause.

Presentation
Frothy urine, anorexia, malaise, muscle wasting, oedema (mobile depending
on gravity—moves from sacrum and eyelids at night to legs during day)
and effusions (pleural, pericardial, ascites). Blood pressure varies. Patients
are prone to intravascular depletion with increased total body water,
especially when over-diuresed due to assumed cardiac failure.

Investigations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Routine blood screen (FBC, U,C+E, glucose, LFTs)
Urinalysis
24-hr urinary protein
ANA, ANCA, complement
Urine and serum electrophoresis, immunoglobulins
Hepatitis serology
Renal ultrasound
Refer to renal team for possible biopsy

Treatment
Usually requires admission and involvement of renal physician
Monitor proteinuria, U+E, ﬂuid balance, blood pressure
Fluid and salt restriction
Diuretics (eg furosemide 80–250mg)
Prophylactic heparin s/c in immobile patient
Monitor closely for infection
Speciﬁc treatment with steroids/immunosuppressants after histology
known (specialist advice)
• Control of hypertension in diabetic patients

CHAPTER 13

Renal medicine

Glomerulonephritis
• A diffuse inﬂammatory process involving the glomeruli
• Presents with renal failure, hypertension, oedema, haematuria, red cell
casts and proteinuria
• Older people often present non-speciﬁcally (eg with nausea, malaise,
arthralgia and pulmonary inﬁltrates due to vasculitis)
2Often misdiagnosed initially, causing delay in treatment. In unwell older
people, always dipstick the urine. Think of glomerulonephritis if there is
haematuria (see b ‘Near-patient urine tests’, p.618).

Causes
• Post-infectious (usually streptococcal/staphylococcal, 2–6 weeks
post-exposure)
• Systemic disease (vasculitis, lupus, Wegener’s granulomatosis, Churg–
Strauss, Goodpasture’s syndrome, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, etc.)
• Primary renal (eg IgA nephropathy)
• Unknown aetiology is not uncommon

Investigation
•
•
•
•

As for nephrotic syndrome
Usually best supervised by a renal physician
Biopsy required for deﬁnitive diagnosis
Speciﬁc investigations for individual causes, eg anti-glomerular
basement antibodies for Goodpasture’s syndrome

Treatment
• Supportive
• 20% require dialysis
• Steroids can be used for all but postinfectious, so refer early to a renal
team to conﬁrm diagnosis (usually by renal biopsy)

Outcome
• Worse in older people. More die, and more progress to CKD

RENAL ARTERY STENOSIS

Renal artery stenosis
More common with increasing age. Usually due to atheroma (as opposed
to intimal hyperplasia pathology in younger patients) so patients often
have known vascular disease in other areas.

Diagnosis
Think of renal artery stenosis when:
• Renal function deteriorates after starting an ACE inhibitor. Stopping
the drug promptly should reverse the changes
• Blood pressure is hard to control
• There is unexplained hypokalaemia (due to low aldosterone levels)
• A renal bruit is heard on clinical examination
• There is a unilateral small kidney seen on imaging
• Flash pulmonary oedema
MRI or CT angiography can be useful in diagnosis as long as renal function
allows (contrast contraindicated if eGFR<30mL/min/1.73m2). Digital subtraction angiography is the gold standard and usually precedes stenting.

Management
As there are often no symptoms, conservative management with blood
pressure control, optimizing vascular secondary prevention but avoiding
ACE inhibitors is often appropriate. If, however, renal function declines or
blood pressure cannot be controlled, then percutaneous angioplasty or
stent insertion is well tolerated even in very old people.

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Volume depletion and dehydration
An important, common, easily missed clinical condition, especially in older
people. Highly prevalent among acutely unwell older people admitted to
hospital due to a combination of increased ﬂuid loss (fever, gastrointestinal loss), and decreased intake (nausea, anorexia, weakness).

Causes
Often multifactorial, and include:
• Blood loss
• Diuretics
• Gastrointestinal losses (eg diarrhoea, NG drainage)
• Sequestration of ﬂuid (eg ileus, burns, peritonitis)
• Poor oral intake
• Fever

Symptoms and signs
• Thirst is uncommon in older people
• Malaise, apathy, weakness
• Orthostatic symptoms (lightheadedness or syncope) and/or postural
hypotension
• Nausea, anorexia, vomiting, and oliguria in severe uraemia
• Tachycardia, supine hypotension (late signs, also in ﬂuid overload)
• Decreased skin turgor, sunken facies, absence of dependent oedema
The symptoms and signs of clinically important dehydration may be subtle
and confusing. It is therefore under-recognized. Continual clinical assessment,
assisted by basic tests (urinalysis; U,C+E) is essential. Invasive monitoring
or other tests are rarely needed.
Older patients commonly become dehydrated because:
• They are ‘run dry’ on the wards, as medical (and nursing) staff fear
precipitating acute pulmonary oedema through excessive iv ﬂuid
administration
• Iv infusions often run more slowly than prescribed, or cannot run for
periods if iv access is lost
• Moderate leg oedema is very poorly speciﬁc for heart failure—don’t
treat this sign alone, in the absence of supporting evidence, with
diuretic
2Poor urine output on the surgical (or medical) wards is more often
a sign of dehydration than of heart failure. Improving urine volume with
diuretics is the wrong treatment.
2There is no sensitive biochemical marker of dehydration—urea and
creatinine are commonly in the normal range, and may be abnormal when
normally hydrated (eg in CKD).

VOLUME DEPLETION AND DEHYDRATION

Challenges to volume status assessment in elderly patients
This can be difﬁcult and requires care.
There is no gold standard in routine clinical examination, although
a capillary wedge pressure will give a reliable estimate in ITU/HDU
settings.
Most symptoms and signs can occur in both ﬂuid overload and
dehydration—use multiple indicators to make an overall decision about
volume status.
Use serial assessments and if the response to treatment is not as
anticipated, review your judgement.
Symptoms
• Thirst is often absent in dehydration
• Confusion can occur in dehydration and ﬂuid overload
• Breathlessness may occur in ﬂuid overload, but also in, eg, chest
sepsis with dehydration
Signs
• Tachycardia may occur in dehydration (may be absent if there is
B-blockade) but also occurs in cardiac failure
• Hypotension similarly occurs both in dehydration and cardiac failure.
A postural drop is more likely to indicate dehydration, but may also
be induced by medication or autonomic dysfunction
• Look at the skin turgor—choose a site away from peripheral
oedema, eg the forehead. Pinch the skin gently and see how quickly it
returns to normal. A sluggish response indicates dehydration
• Check for peripheral oedema—remember that in a bedbound patient
this may collect in the sacral region. It is possible to have peripheral
oedema with intravascular depletion (eg in hypoalbuminaemia) so
this is not a reliable indicator of ﬂuid state
• Check the JVP, which is elevated in cardiac failure and also in
tricuspid regurgitation
Investigations
• Urine speciﬁc gravity may be high in dehydration, and also in heart
failure, and is less helpful when diuretics have been used
• Elevated U,C+E often indicate dehydration—check for the patient’s
baseline if possible. CKD will also elevate urea and creatinine, but is
likely to be chronic. Remember that frail older people will have a lower
creatinine (perhaps even in the normal range) because of low muscle
bulk, but this may still represent a marked abnormality for them
• Elevated Hb may occur in dehydration and in chronic hypoxia

405

406

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Dehydration: management
• Treat the underlying cause(s)
• Suspend diuretic and ACE inhibitors
• Continually reassess clinically, assisted by urinalysis/U,C+E. Measure
and document intake, output, BP, and weight
• If mild: oral rehydration may sufﬁce. A ‘homemade’ oral rehydration
mixture can be made by adding a level teaspoon of salt and eight level
teaspoons of sugar to a litre of water with a touch of fruit juice. Old
frail people need time, encouragement, and physical assistance with
drinking. Enlist relatives and friends to help
• More severe dehydration, or mild dehydration not responding to
conservative measures, will require other measures—usually parenteral
treatment, either s/c (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Administer subcutaneous
fluid’, p.406) or iv
• The speed of parenteral ﬂuid administration should be tailored to
the individual patient, based on volume of ﬂuid deﬁcit, degree of
physiological compromise and perceived risks of ﬂuid overload. For
example, a hypotensive patient who is clinically volume depleted with
evidence of end-organ failure should be ﬂuid resuscitated briskly,
even if there is a history of heart failure. In the absence of end-organ
dysfunction, rehydration may proceed more cautiously, but continual
reassessment is essential, to conﬁrm that the clinical situation remains
benign, and that progress (input > output) is being made

HOW TO . . . Administer subcutaneous ﬂuid
This method (hypodermoclysis) was widely used in the 1950s, but fell
into disrepute following reports of adverse effects associated with very
hypo/hypertonic ﬂuid. Fluids that are close to isotonic delivered by
competent staff are a safe and effective substitute for iv therapy.
• A simple, widely accessible method for parenteral ﬂuid/electrolytes
• Fluid is administered via a standard giving set and ﬁne (21–23G)
butterﬂy needle into s/c tissue, then draining centrally via lymphatics
and veins
• S/c ﬂuid administration should be considered when insertion or
maintenance of iv access presents problems, eg difﬁcult venous
access, persistent extravasation, or lack of staff skills
• Iv access is preferred if rapid ﬂuid administration is needed (eg
gastrointestinal bleed), or if precise control of ﬂuid volume is
essential
Sites of administration
Preferred sites: abdomen, chest (avoid breast), thigh, and scapula. In
agitated patients who can tear out iv (or s/c) lines, sites close to the
scapulae may foil their attempts.
Continued

DEHYDRATION: MANAGEMENT

Fluid type
Any crystalloid solution that is approximately isotonic can be used,
including normal (0.9%) saline, 5% glucose and any isotonic combination
of dextrose–saline. Potassium chloride can be added to the infusion, in
concentrations of 20–40mM/L. If local irritation occurs, change site and/
or reduce the concentration of added potassium.
Infusion rate
Typical ﬂow (and absorption) rate: 1mL/min or 1.5L/day. Infusion pumps
may be used. If ﬂow or absorption is slow (leading to lumpy, oedematous
areas):
• Change site
• Use hyaluronidase (a ‘digester’ of connective tissue). Add 150–300
units to each litre ﬂuid and/or pre-treat site with 150 units
• Use two separate infusion sites at the same time
• Using these techniques, up to 3L of ﬂuid daily may be given. For
smaller volumes, consider an overnight ‘top-up’ of 500–1000mL,
or two daily boluses of 500mL each (run in over 2–3hr) leaving the
patient free of infusion lines during the daily rehabilitation/activity.
Some patients need only 1L/alternate nights to maintain hydration
Monitoring
Patients should be monitored clinically (hydration state, input/output,
weight) and biochemically as they would if they were receiving iv ﬂuid.
2 Be responsive and creative in your prescriptions of ﬂuid and
electrolytes. One size does not ﬁt all.
Potential complications
Rare and usually mild. They include local infection, and local
adverse reactions to hypertonic ﬂuid (eg with added potassium) or to
hyaluronidase.
Contraindications
• Exercise caution in thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy
• S/c infusion is not appropriate in patients who need rapid volume
repletion

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Hyponatraemia: treatment
See Box 14.1 and Fig. 14.1.
• Combine normalization of [Na] with correction of ﬂuid volume and
treating underlying cause(s).
• The rate of correction of hyponatraemia should not be too rapid.
Usually, correction to the lower limit of the normal range (7130mM)
should be achieved in a few days. Maximum correction in any 24hr
period should be <10mM. Full correction can reasonably take weeks.
• Rapid correction risks central pontine myelinolysis (leading to
quadriparesis and cranial nerve abnormalities) and is indicated only
when hyponatraemia is severe and the patient critically unwell.
2By deﬁnition, hyponatraemia is a low blood sodium concentration.
Therefore a low level may be a result of low sodium, high water, or both.
Dehydration and hyponatraemia may coexist if sodium depletion exceeds
water depletion. This is common—don’t worsen the dehydration by ﬂuid
restricting these patients.
Box 14.1 Drugs and hyponatraemia
• Most commonly diuretics (especially in high dose or combination),
SSRIs, carbamazepine, NSAIDs
• Other drugs include opiates, other antidepressants (MAOIs,
TCAs), other anticonvulsants (eg valproate), oral hypoglycaemics
(sulfonylureas eg, chlorpropamide, glipizide), PPIs, ACE inhibitors,
and barbiturates
• Combinations of drugs (eg diuretic and SSRI) are especially likely to
cause hyponatraemia
• If hyponatraemia is problematic and the treatment is needed, consider
other drugs that are less likely to cause a low sodium (eg mirtazapine
for depression)

Clinical assessment of volume status

Hypovolaemic
Hypotension, tachycardia, decreased skin turgor, low JVP,
dry tongue, minimal or no peripheral oedema

Saline depletion (salt > water loss)
• Either renal or extra-renal losses, distinguished by spot urine [Na]
• Cause is often obvious
• Plasma osmolality usually low, except in hypertonic hyponatraemia
(e.g. hyperglycaemia or hyperglycinaemia (following TURP))

Urinary [Na] > 10mM
ie non-renal salt/water loss
Vomiting
Diarrhoea
Skin loss eg burns
‘Third space’ eg pancreatitis,
bowel obstruction,
peritonitis
• Rectal villous adenoma, or
fistula
•
•
•
•

Treat underlying cause. Saline repletion—usually iv normal saline. May
need aggressive volume resuscitation to avert shock and organ failure.
Avoid colloids or glucose solutions (may worsen hypo [Na]). Rarely
need hypertonic saline solutions (may correct [Na] too quickly)
Maximum rise in [Na] = 10m/day

Water overload without Na retention
• Usually less obvious signs. May be difficult to find cause. Exclude
hypothroidism, Addison’s. Consider SIADH. Take careful drug history
• Plasma osmolality usually low; maybe normal in pseudohyponatraemia
eg hyperlipidaemia (TGs >50mM) or hyperproteinaemia (TP >150g/L),
or if sample taken from drip arm
Urinary Na >20mM. Usually
chronic water overload
• SIADH
• Drugs (eg thiazide)
• Chronic renal failure
• Hypothyroidism
• Isolated cortisol deficiency

Urinary Na >20mM. Usually
acute water overload
• Stress
• Postsurgery (excess ADH,
± iv fluids)
• Polydipsia (usually in
addition to renal
impairment)
• Fluid depletion and
hypotonic replacement
(commonly iatrogenic)

Treat underlying cause. Discontinue relevant medications (or infusions). If
mild, and the precipitant has passed (eg surgery), may be left to selfcorrect. If more severe or symptomatic, restrict water intake to a maximum
of 1000mL/day; more severe restriction may be needed in older people,
whose free water losses are lower—restrict to 500–800mL if necessary
Maximum rise in [Na] = 10m/day

Hypervolaemic
Oedema, especially sacral. Pulmonary oedema.
Raised JVP. No hypotension

Water and salt overload
• Signs of overload and an underlying cause are commonly
found: often renal, liver or heart failure
• Plasma osmolality low
• Decrease in circulating volume results in ADH and
angiotensin release

Urinary Na <10mM ie renal
Na retention
• CCF
• Cirrhosis
• Nephrotic syndrome
(rarely)

Urinary Na >20mM
• Acute/chronic renal failure

Treat underlying cause. Restrict water intake to <1L/day.
If incomplete response, consider diuretics (furosemide).
Modest hyponatraemia is often asymptomatic. In heart failure
and nephrotic syndrome, ACE inhibition helps
Maximum rise in [Na] = 10m/day

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic
hormone secretion (SIADH)
Deﬁnition
Less than maximally dilute (ie inappropriately concentrated) urine in the
presence of subclinical excess body water.
2SIADH is massively over-diagnosed, especially in older people, leading
to inappropriate ﬂuid restriction. Consider it a diagnosis of exclusion—
drugs or organ impairment cause a similar clinical syndrome.

Diagnosis
Essential features include:
• Hypotonic hyponatraemia ([Na]<125mM and plasma osmolarity
<260mOsm/L)
• Normal volume status, ie euvolaemia—there is slight water overload,
but not clinically identiﬁable
• Normal renal, thyroid, hepatic, cardiac, and adrenal function
• Inappropriately concentrated, salty urine: osmolarity >200mOsm/L and
[Na]>20mM)
• No diuretics, or ADH-modulating drugs (opiates, anticonvulsants,
antidepressants, NSAIDs, barbiturates, and oral hypoglycaemics).
Drug effects may take days or weeks to diminish

Causes
Common causes include:
• Surgical stress
• Neoplasms (especially bronchogenic, pancreatic)
• CNS disease (especially trauma, subdural haematoma, stroke,
meningoencephalitis)
• Lung disease (TB, pneumonia, bronchiectasis)
• Some drugs cause low Na by an SIADH-like effect, but this is not the
true syndrome

Treatment
• Treat underlying cause
• If mild, and the precipitant has passed (eg surgery), may be left to
self-correct
• If more severe and/or symptomatic, restrict water intake to a
maximum of 1000mL/day; more severe restriction may be needed in
older people, whose free water losses are lower—restrict to 500 to
800mL if necessary
• Drug treatments are generally reserved for refractory cases, or where
the ﬂuid restriction is not tolerated. Demeclocycline acts by blocking
the renal tubular effect of ADH and is ﬁrst line. Urea and vasopressin
receptor antagonists can also be used

SIADH

HOW TO . . . Perform a short ACTH stimulation test
(short Synacthen® test)
The diagnosis of adrenocortical insufﬁciency is made when the adrenal
cortex is found not to synthesize cortisol despite adequate stimulation.
Within 30min of ACTH stimulation, the normal adrenal releases several
times its basal cortisol output.

Performing the test
• The test can be done at any time of day
• Take blood for baseline cortisol. Label tube with patient identiﬁers
and time taken
• Give 250micrograms Synacthen® (synthetic ACTH, 1–24 amino
acid sequence). Give intravenously if iv access is present; otherwise
intramuscularly
• 30min after injection, take more blood for cortisol. Label tube with
patient identiﬁers and time taken

Interpreting the test
A normal response meets three criteria:
• Baseline cortisol level >150nmol/L
• 30min cortisol >500nmol/L
• 30min cortisol greater than baseline cortisol by 200nmol/L or more
The absolute 30min cortisol carries more signiﬁcance than the baseline
–30min increment, especially in patients who are stressed (ill) and at
maximal adrenal output.
A normal Synacthen® test excludes Addison’s disease. If the test is
not normal:
• Consider further tests, such as the prolonged ACTH stimulation test,
usually after specialist advice, eg:
• ACTH level (elevated in primary, and low in secondary
hypoadrenalism)
• The prolonged ACTH stimulation test
• If the patient is very unwell, give hydrocortisone 100mg iv pending
conﬁrmation of hypoadrenalism

411

412

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Hypernatraemia
Causes
• Usually due to true ‘dehydration’ ie water loss > sodium loss
• Not enough water in, or too much water out, or a combination,
eg poor oral intake, diarrhoea, vomiting, diuretics, uncontrolled
diabetes mellitus
• Rarely due to salt excess—iatrogenic (iv or po), psychogenic or
malicious (poisoning)
• Very rarely due to diabetes insipidus (urine osmolarity low) or
mineralocorticoid excess (Conn’s)
Commonly seen in septic older people: increased losses (sweating),
reduced oral intake and reduced renal concentrating (water-conserving)
mechanism.

Clinical features
•
•
•
•

Hypotension (supine and/or orthostatic)
Sunken features
Urine scanty and concentrated
Lethargy, confusion, coma, and ﬁts

Tests
Urea and creatinine are often high, but may be in the high normal range;
the patient is still water-depleted. K is low in Conn’s. Haemoglobin and
albumin often high (haemoconcentration), correcting with treatment.

Treatment
• Encourage oral ﬂuid
• Usually iv ﬂuid is required; rarely s/c ﬂuid will be sufﬁcient
• Fluid infusion rates should not be too cautious: eg 3–4L/24hr is
reasonable, guided by clinical and biochemical response. Too rapid
infusions risk cerebral oedema, especially in the more chronically
hypernatraemic patient
• Ensure the patient becomes clinically euvolaemic as well as normonatraemic: most dehydrated patients have a normal [Na], and will
correct into the normal range before the patient is fully hydrated
• Many patients are Na-deplete as well as water-deplete; therefore
consider alternating normal saline with 5% glucose infusions
2Even mild hypernatraemia is usually clinically important, and needs
attention.

HYPONATRAEMIA: ASSESSMENT

Hyponatraemia: assessment
A common problem. May safely be monitored rather than treated if
modest in severity ([Na]>125mM), stable and without side effects, and if
there is an identiﬁable (often drug) cause.

Clinical features
• Subtle or absent in mild cases
• Between [Na]=115–125mM: lethargy, confusion, altered personality
• At <115mM: delirium, coma, ﬁts, and death

Causes
Iatrogenic causes are most common. Acute onset, certain drugs, or recent
iv ﬂuids make iatrogenesis especially likely.
Important causes include:
• Drugs. Many are implicated (see Box 14.1)
• Excess water administration—either NG (rarely oral) or iv
(5% glucose)
• Failure of heart, liver, thyroid, kidneys
• Stress response, eg after trauma or surgery, exacerbated by iv colloid
or 5% glucose
• Hypoadrenalism: steroid withdrawal or Addison’s disease
• Syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)
In older people, multiple causes are common, eg heart failure, diuretics,
and acute diarrhoea.

Approach
Take a careful drug history, including those stopped in the past few weeks.
Examine to determine evidence of cause and volume status (JVP, postural
BP, pulmonary oedema, ankle/sacral oedema, peripheral perfusion).

Investigations
Clinical history and examination, urine, and blood biochemistry are usually
all that are needed. Ensure that the sample wasn’t delayed in transit or
taken from a drip arm. If genuine hyponatraemia, take:
• Blood for creatinine, osmolarity, TFTs, LFTs, glucose, random cortisol
• Spot urine sample for sodium and osmolarity
Consider a short adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) test to
exclude hypoadrenalism, particularly if the patient is volume-depleted and
hyperkalaemic (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Perform a short ACTH stimulation
test (short Synacthen® test)’, p.411).

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Hypothermia: diagnosis
A common medical emergency in older people, occurring both in and out
of hospital.

Deﬁnition
• Core temperature <35°C, but <35.5°C is probably abnormal
• Mild: 32–35°C, moderate: 30–32°C, severe: <30°C
• Fatality is high and correlates with severity of associated illness

Causes
Often multifactorial.
• Illness (drugs, fall, pneumonia)
• Defective homeostasis (failure of autonomic nervous system-induced
shivering and vasoconstriction; decreased muscle mass)
• Cold exposure (clothing, defective temperature discrimination, climate,
poverty)
In established hypothermia, thermoregulation is further impaired and is
effectively poikilothermic (temperature varies with environment).
2Hypothermia is a common presentation of sepsis in hospital in older
people, and probably an indicator of poor prognosis. Don’t ignore the
temperature chart.

Diagnosis
Rectal temperature is the gold standard but well-taken oral or tympanic
temperature will sufﬁce.
Ensure the thermometer range includes low temperatures (mercury-inglass thermometer range usually 34–42°C, thereby underestimating
severity in all but the mildest cases).

Presentation
Often insidious and non-speciﬁc. The patient will frequently not complain
of feeling cold. Multiple systems affected.
• Skin: May be cold to touch (paradoxically warm if defective
vasoconstriction). Shivering is unusual (this occurs early in the cooling
process). There may be increased muscle tone, skin oedema, erythema
or bullae
• Nervous system: Signs can mimic stroke with falls, unsteadiness,
weakness, slow speech, and ataxia. Reﬂexes may be depressed or
exaggerated with abnormal plantar response and dilated sluggish pupils.
Conscious level ranges from confused/sleepy to coma. Seizures and
focal signs can occur
• Cardiovascular system:
• Initially vasoconstriction, hypertension, and tachycardia
• Then myocardial suppression, hypotension, sinus bradycardia
• Eventually extreme bradycardia, bradypnoea, and hypotension. May
lead to false diagnosis of death, however, the protective effect of
cold on vital organs means survival may be possible
• Dysrhythmias include AF (early), ventricular ﬁbrillation, and asystole
(late)

HYPOTHERMIA: DIAGNOSIS

• Renal: There is early diuresis with later oliguria and acute tubular
necrosis
• Respiratory: Respiratory depression and cough suppression occur with
secondary atelectasis and pneumonia. Pulmonary oedema and ARDS
occur late
• Gastrointestinal: Hypomotility may lead to ileus, gastric dilation and
vomiting. Hepatic metabolism is reduced (including of drugs). There is
a risk of pancreatitis with hypo- or hyper-glycaemia
• Other: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), pressure injuries,
and rhabdomyolysis

Investigations
FBC, ESR
U,C+E
Glucose
Amylase
CRP
LFTs
TFTs
Blood culture
Drug/toxin screen
CK and urinalysis (may show rhabdomyolysis)
ABG s(looking for metabolic and respiratory acidosis and lactate.
Do not correct for temperature)
• ECG (abnormalities include prolonged PR interval, J waves (peak
between QRS and T in leads V4-6) at <30°C and dysrhythmia)
• Serum cortisol (consider if there are features of hypoadrenalism or
hypothermia is unexplained or recurrent)

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Hypothermia: management
Monitoring
Regular BP, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation,
glucose; continuous ECG; consider urinary catheter. Consider ITU.

Treatment principles
• Mild hypothermia should be managed with gentle warming and close
monitoring
• The features of severe hypothermia may mimic those of death. Begin
resuscitation whilst gathering information that permits a decision as
to whether further intervention is likely to be futile or else not in the
patient’s interests. Stop resuscitation according to clinical judgement;
generally don’t declare dead until re-warmed, or re-warming fails
• Re-warming: rate should approximate that of onset (0.5–1°C/hr if not
critically unwell). Caution, as re-warming may lead to hypotension.
A combination of the following modalities is usually sufﬁcient:
• Passive external: surround with dry clothes, blankets/space blankets
• Active external: hot air blanket (‘Bair HuggerTM’), hot water bottle,
bath
• Active internal: heated oxygen, ﬂuid, and food
• System support: maintain airway, ventilate as necessary. Good iv
access. Warm iv ﬂuid: may need large volumes as warming causes
vasodilatation. Treat organ dysfunction as appropriate. Cardiac pacing
only if bradycardia is disproportionate to reduced metabolic rate
• If severe, or multiple organ failure, consider ITU. Handle carefully—
rough handling and procedures (including intubation) may precipitate VF
Sudden, severe hypothermia ± cardiac arrest (eg due to water immersion)
is uncommon in older people. If it occurs, manage in the usual way with
rapid, invasive re-warming, supported by ITU.

Drug treatment
Consider:
• Empirical antibiotics (most have evidence of infection on careful serial
assessment)
• Adrenal insufﬁciency (treatment: hydrocortisone 100mg qds)
• Hypothyroidism (treatment: liothyronine 50micrograms then
25micrograms tds iv, always with hydrocortisone)
• Thiamine deﬁciency (malnourished or alcoholic) (treatment: B vitamins
oral or iv) (as Pabrinex®)
Drug metabolism is reduced, and accumulation can occur. Efﬁcacy at the
site of action is also reduced. Exercise caution with s/c and intramuscular
(im) drugs (including insulin) that may accumulate and be mobilized rapidly
as perfusion improves.

Prevention
Before discharge, establish why this episode occurred—is recurrence
likely? (Consider housing, cognition, hypoglycaemia, sepsis, etc.) Consider
how further episodes may be prevented, or terminated early.

HYPOTHERMIA: MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Monitor temperature
No method is absolutely precise.
• Traditional mercury-in-glass thermometers are now rarely used in
hospital, having been replaced due to risks to patients, staff, and the
public
• Digital electronic and infrared thermometers can provide reliable
results when used correctly and in accordance with manufacturer’s
instructions
• Thermochromic (forehead) thermometers are imprecise, although
they may be useful for screening or with uncooperative patients
Digital electronic thermometers
These may permit oral, axillary, or rectal measurement. They typically
require a small period of equilibration and patient compliance.
Infrared (‘tympanic’) thermometers
These measure the temperature of tissue within and close to the
eardrum, returning a value rapidly. Ensure that the earlobe is gently
pulled posteriorly and superiorly, straightening the external ear canal,
before inserting the probe fairly ﬁrmly.
Ear wax has only a slight effect, reducing measured temperature by
<0.5°C.
Note that tympanic thermometers may offer a choice of displaying
temperature as either ‘true tympanic’ or the derived value ‘oral
equivalent’. Ensure that you are familiar with the thermelometer in use in
your hospital and what output they give: tympanic or ‘oral equivalent’.
Measurement in practice
• Precise temperature measurement is fundamental to detecting and
monitoring disease
• Fever may be due to infection, malignancy, inﬂammation, connective
tissue disease, or drugs
• A reduced or absent fever response to sepsis is seen in some elderly
patients. Do not dismiss modest fever (<37.5°C) as insigniﬁcant, or
rule out infection because the patient is afebrile
• Hypothermia occurs inside and outside hospital, and may be missed
unless thermometers with an appropriate range (30–40°C) are used
• Temperature varies continuously: lowest in peripheral skin, highest in
the central vessels and brain. No site is truly representative of ‘core’
temperature. Typically, when compared with oral temperature, axillary
temperatures are 1.0°C lower, and rectal and tympanic temperatures
0.5–1.0°C higher (but see notes on tympanic thermometry, also in this
box)
• Where clinical suspicion is high, make measurements yourself,
complementing monitoring by nursing staff. Body temperature
changes continuously, and a fever may manifest only after the patient
has re-warmed following a cooling ambulance journey
• The hand on the forehead to assess core temperature (and on the
palm of the hand, to determine peripheral vasodilation) is of value
in screening for sepsis, and can be incorporated into daily rounds
without time penalty

417

418

CHAPTER 14

Homeostasis

Heat-related illness
An important cause of morbidity and mortality in older people, but the
risk is much less appreciated than that of hypothermia. The contribution
of heat stress to death is rarely mentioned on death certiﬁcates, but epidemiological studies indicate signiﬁcant excess morbidity and mortality
during extended periods of unaccustomed hot weather (eg France 2003:
15,000 excess deaths). There is an increased incidence of acute cerebrovascular, respiratory and, especially, cardiovascular disease.

Risk factors
• Consider older people as being relatively poikilothermic, ie, lacking
close control of body temperature in some circumstances
• Homeostasis is weakened due to raised sweating threshold, reduced
sweat volume, altered vasomotor control and behavioural factors
(lessened sensation of temperature extremes)
• Climate: high temperature, high radiant heat (sitting in sunshine,
indoors or out), high humidity
• Drugs: eg diuretics, anticholinergics, psychotropics
• Comorbidity: frailty, cerebrovascular, and cardiovascular disease

A spectrum of illness
The presentation is usually different in older people, typically occurring
not after extreme exertion, but during heatwaves in temperate zones.
• Prickly heat (‘miliaria’): itchy, erythematous, papular rash. Treatment:
cool, wash, antihistamines
• Heat oedema: peripheral oedema, usually self-limiting
• Heat syncope: increased syncope risk due to ﬂuid depletion and
vasodilation
• Heat exhaustion: is a potentially catastrophic illness. Dehydration and
heat stress leads to non-speciﬁc presentation with collapse, immobility,
weakness, vomiting, dizziness, headache, fever, and tachycardia.
However, treatment should result in rapid improvement
• Heat stroke occurs when untreated heat exhaustion progresses to its
end stage (hyperthermic thermoregulatory failure). Core temperature
is generally >40°C, mental state is altered (confusion l coma),
circulatory and other organ failure is common, and sweating is often
absent. CNS changes may be persistent and severe. Prognosis reﬂects
pre-existing comorbidity, severity, and complications, and is often poor

Management
• Individual response. Emergency inpatient treatment required. Identify
and reverse precipitants. Cool rapidly until temperature 38–39°C—fan,
tepid sponging, remove clothing. Close monitoring (temperature, BP,
pulse saturation, urine output); consider invasive central venous pressure
monitoring. Cool iv ﬂuids according to assessment of ﬂuid/electrolyte status
• Community response. Local environment modiﬁcation—fans, air
conditioning, shade windows, open windows at night, seek cooler
areas, avoid exercise, maintain or increase cool ﬂuid intake, light/loose
clothing. Education of patient and carers. Governments should have
public health measures in place to reduce the impact of heat waves

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

The ageing endocrine system
Ageing and thyroid function
Normal thyroid function is preserved in healthy older people. Median
TSH levels drift upwards very slowly with age, but remain within normal
limits in the absence of disease. Lower triiodothyronine (T3) and TSH
levels seen in institutionalized older people and in very advanced old age
(>95 years) are probably due to illness.

Sick euthyroid syndrome
• TFTs are often abnormal in euthyroid patients who are ill with
non–thyroid systemic disease; this reverses spontaneously when the
underlying illness improves
2Do not automatically initiate thyroid treatment changes
• Changes depend on illness severity, and when TFTs are checked
(during acute illness or recovery)
• TSH secretion decreases early in the illness. Falls in levothyroxine
(T4) and (especially) T3 may follow, the result of reduced TSH, lower
thyroid hormone binding and reduced peripheral T4 l T3 conversion
• Changes are more likely due to true hypothyroidism if:
• Free T4 levels are low
• Changes are severe
• Secondary hypothyroidism (due to hypothalamo-pituitary failure)
causes a similar pattern of TFTs, but is very much less common, and
other features of pituitary failure are present (eg hypogonadism)
• In the convalescent phase following illness, TSH may be elevated as low
thyroid hormone levels drive TSH production. For a time, TSH may be
high and T4/T3 low, mimicking primary hypothyroidism. TFTs repeated
a few weeks later are usually normal.

Ageing and glucose metabolism
In older people:
• Glucose-induced insulin release is delayed and reduced in size
• Insulin-induced suppression of hepatic glucose production is delayed
• Insulin-mediated peripheral (muscle and fat) glucose uptake is reduced
In addition to reductions in physical activity and lean muscle mass, the
factors listed here lead to higher frequency of impaired glucose tolerance
(IGT) with age. IGT is associated with macrovascular disease but not with
speciﬁc diabetic complications. A minority of people with IGT progress
to diabetes.

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes is much more common with age: about 40% of new diagnoses
are in people over 65. Prevalence in people over 65 is 10% in the UK, up
to 50% in some ethnic groups and obese patients.

Comparing type 1 and type 2 diabetes
• Both type 1 (insulin–dependent; IDDM) and type 2 (non-insulin
dependent; NIDDM) diabetes can occur in older people. The
prevalence of type 2 is much higher
• In overweight older people, diabetes is mostly due to peripheral tissue
insulin resistance (type 2). Glucose-induced insulin release is normal
• Lean older people with diabetes often have impaired insulin release
and may have islet cell antibodies more typical of type 1 diabetes. They
respond poorly to oral hypoglycaemics
• There are increasing numbers of older people with type 1 diabetes
who developed the disease in early or mid-life and have survived
decades on insulin, sometimes with no or few complications
• Many people with type 2 diabetes progress to require insulin to achieve
acceptable glycaemic control. This group is insulin-requiring (hence
IRDM) and are unlikely to develop ketoacidosis if insulin is withdrawn
• When assessing a patient on insulin, determine whether they are
insulin-dependent (type 1; must always have background insulin
infused) or insulin-requiring (type 2; in which insulin may safely be
withheld for a time, without risk of ketosis)

Secondary diabetes
More common in older people. Causes include:
• Drugs. Often steroids, sometimes high-dose thiazides, rarely other
drugs
• Pancreatic disease, eg chronic pancreatitis
• Other endocrine diseases, eg Cushing’s, hyperthyroidism

Presentation
• Diabetes often presents atypically or late in older people
• Up to 50% of older people with diabetes are undiagnosed. This is
at least partly due to physiological age-related changes, eg the renal
threshold for glucose increases (glucosuria and polyuria occur later)
and the thirst mechanism is impaired (polydipsia occurs later)
• The diagnosis is often made by screening blood or urine tests, or
during intercurrent illness
• Think of diabetes in many clinical circumstances, eg coma, delirium,
systemic stress (eg pneumonia), oral or vaginal thrush (candida), vulval
itch (subclinical candida), cellulitis (and necrotising fasciitis), weight loss,
urinary incontinence, polyuria, malaise, vascular disease or peripheral
neuropathy
• Steroid administration may reveal a diabetic tendency—always
monitor, especially when high doses are used

DIABETES MELLITUS

HOW TO . . . Diagnose diabetes in older people
• Conﬁrm the diagnosis with a random blood sugar or fasting sugar.
Criteria are the same as for younger patients
• In general, the diagnosis is conﬁrmed with a second measurement,
unless the diagnosis is clear (eg severe hyperglycaemia with
metabolic decompensation). A single high measurement in the
absence of symptoms is not diagnostic
• In some older diabetic people, fasting sugars may be normal. This
is more common in lean older people, who have only postprandial
hyperglycaemia. If in doubt, do an oral glucose tolerance test
• Elevated glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c) levels are only
moderately speciﬁc and sensitive to diabetes and are not sufﬁcient
either to conﬁrm or to exclude the diagnosis. HBA1c is helpful in
monitoring established disease
• Screen annually in those with risk factors (eg family history, obesity),
at least every 3 years in those without
Diagnostic criteria
At least one of the following criteria must apply:
• Symptoms + random plasma glucose >11.1mmol
• Fasting plasma glucose >7.0mmol
• 2-hr plasma glucose >11.1mmol during oral glucose tolerance test
(75g anhydrous glucose or the equivalent volume of a proprietary
glucose drink such as Lucozade)
Obtaining a fasting blood sugar
• Give the completed request card to the patient
• The patient should make an early morning appointment with a
phlebotomist or general practice nurse
• There must be no caloric intake for at least 8hr before the blood test
• Tell the patient to go for the blood test before breakfast
• Clear ﬂuids (water; tea or coffee without milk or sugar) may be
taken
• Other beverages or food must be avoided

423

424

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetes: treatment
• In all patients, aim to avoid symptoms of hyper- and hypoglycaemia
• In the more robust older patient, good glycaemic control probably
reduces complication rates:
• Aim for HBA1c levels close to normal (6.5–7.5%) and fasting sugar of
5–7mmol/L
• The frail, and the very old (>80 years) have not been included in most
prospective treatment studies. There is therefore doubt whether tight
glycaemic control improves long-term outcome. Shorter-term beneﬁts
may include improved cognition, functional status, mood, and vitality
• Balance the potential beneﬁts of tight control with the risk of
drug-induced symptomatic hypoglycaemia, falls, and fractures
• Symptoms of hypoglycaemia may go unrecognized or be considered
an ageing change by carers
• Reasonable targets for the frail are HBA1c 7.5–8.5% and fasting sugar
7–10mmol/L
• Vulnerable older patients are probably at higher risk of hypoglycaemia
(eg causing confusion and falls) than hyperglycaemia. In some
circumstances (eg where glucose levels appear very variable) it may
be safest to accept very high ceiling levels (eg up to 20mmol/L)
2In general, in frail older people, the approach is to reduce symptoms,
not to normalize sugars.

Diet
• Dietary change is often the only treatment needed in obese people
with type 2 diabetes
• Wholesale changes to diet may not be accepted, but even small
changes are worthwhile and on their own can result in much increased
insulin sensitivity within weeks
• Full compliance may not be possible for the functionally or cognitively
impaired, but an experienced dietician or nurse working with the
patient and family is usually effective
• Severe dietary restrictions are often not appropriate, especially for the
very old or very frail
• Beware the strict diet that takes enjoyment from (the last months of)
life while giving little back

Education
• Educate family, carers, and nursing home staff continually
• Provide simple written information and instructions
• The approach must be tailored to the individual, taking note of
cognitive and sensory impairments

Other interventions
• Exercise, especially endurance exercise (eg walking, cycling) improves
insulin sensitivity
• Weight loss. Even modest reductions are beneﬁcial
• Reduction of other vascular risk factors, including smoking
• Home or pendant alarm systems in case of hypoglycaemia

DIABETES: TREATMENT

Disease surveillance
Patients should be encouraged to take control of their own diabetic
control and facilitated to monitor their own blood sugars. In addition they
should be reviewed at least annually. In the very frail or dependent, regular
reviews remain vital, eg to ensure that treatments remain appropriate and
that adverse effects have not occurred.
• Assess diet/drug concordance
• Check weight
• Optimize cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure and lipids
• Assess glycaemic control
• Blood glucose testing, supplemented by 6-monthly HbA1c estimation is
the preferred method
• Urine glucose testing is less reliable, due to increased renal glucose
threshold
• Examine for evidence of complications, including microalbuminuria, an
early sign of nephropathy
• Ensure regular retinal screening is in place
• Check feet and advise on their care (see b ‘The elderly foot’, p.490)
2Utilize the advice and support of nursing staff with specialist knowledge
of diabetes—either community nurses with a special interest, or dedicated
diabetes specialist nurses.

425

426

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetes: oral drug treatment
Biguanides
For example: metformin (start at 500mg od)
• Commonly used as ﬁrst-line drug therapy in obese (BMI >25), elderly
patients (where insulin resistance predominates)
• Do not cause hypoglycaemia
• Common side effects are nausea, diarrhoea, anorexia, and weight loss.
These are less common if the drug is introduced slowly (500mg od,
increased incrementally each week to maximum 850mg tds)
• Can cause lactic acidosis in patients with hepatic or renal impairment,
or where tissue hypoxia increases lactate production
• Use cautiously in patients with kidney impairment (avoided if eGFR
<30), hepatic impairment or heart failure (even if treated). Age itself
is not a contraindication
• Stop in acutely unwell patients (especially with sepsis, respiratory
failure, heart failure, or MI)
• Discontinue before anaesthesia or the administration of
radiographic contrast media, restarting if/when renal function
normalizes

Sulphonylureas
For example: gliclazide (start at 40mg od)
• Commonly used as ﬁrst-line drug therapy in lean elderly patients
(where impairment in insulin release predominates)
• Can cause hypoglycaemia. This is uncommon if short-acting agents
(gliclazide, glipizide, tolbutamide) are used. Avoid long-acting drugs
(chlorpropamide, glibenclamide) which can cause prolonged and
damaging hypoglycaemia. In patients taking these (often for years
without problems), consider a switch to shorter-acting drugs
• Commonly cause weight gain

Thiazolidinediones
For example: pioglitazone (start with 30mg od)
• Effective in older people; do not cause hypoglycaemia. May be used:
• As monotherapy, if intolerant of sulphonylureas and biguanides
• In combination with either a sulphonylurea or biguanide if control
with that combination has been unsatisfactory
• Increasingly used as part of triple therapy to avoid introducing
insulin
• LFTs must be monitored, initially 2-monthly. Stop if dysfunction
occurs. Mild abnormalities at onset secondary to fatty liver are not a
contraindication
• Can be used in mild/moderate renal failure. Avoid in heart failure.
Doubles risk of bone fracture in women
• Pioglitazone has a more favourable cardiovascular risk proﬁle

DIABETES: ORAL DRUG TREATMENT

A-Glucosidase inhibitors
For example: acarbose (start with 25mg bd twice daily, taken with the ﬁrst
mouthful of food)
• Only moderately effective (HbA1c reduction 0.5–1%), either as ﬁrst-line
or add-on therapy. Despite modest potency and side effects, they have
a place, and may, eg, help delay or avoid the need for insulin
• Gastrointestinal side effects (ﬂatulence, bloating, diarrhoea) usually
settle with time and are less severe if the dose begins low and is
increased slowly
• There are no severe side effects. Hypoglycaemia is never a problem

HOW TO . . . Manage older diabetic people in care homes
In care homes:
• The prevalence of diabetes is very high
• Individual diabetic patients are at great risk of complications
• Hypoglycaemia and other medication side effects are frequent
To enhance quality of care:
• Every resident should be screened for diabetes on admission to the
home and each year thereafter. Blood sampling is far more sensitive
than urinalysis
• Every resident with diabetes should have an individual care plan
including at least: diet, medications, glycaemic targets, and monitoring
schedule. Monitoring should be varied in time (pre-/post-prandial;
breakfast, lunch, evening meal, late evening), to provide a more
complete picture of glycaemic control
• Diabetic diets should be available
• An annual diabetes review should be performed by either a nurse
with specialist training in diabetes, a GP, or a specialist (geriatrician or
diabetologist)
• An annual ophthalmic screening assessment should be performed.
Rarely, domiciliary screening is available. Usually, the resident will
need to leave the home to attend a specialist screening centre, but
this is usually worthwhile as vision contributes signiﬁcantly to quality
of life
• There should be easy access to specialist services including podiatry,
optometry, diabetic foot clinic, dietetics, and diabetes specialist
nursing
• Each home with diabetic residents should have a diabetes care policy.
Staff should have received training in the identiﬁcation and treatment
of diabetic emergencies and the prevention of complications

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetes: insulin treatment
• Insulin is essential for the treatment of type 1 diabetes
• Insulin is started in type 2 diabetes when oral agents fail to achieve
adequate control, if hyperglycaemia is severe (especially if the patient is
lean, and insulin deﬁciency likely), if a patient is unwell, and if oral drugs
are contraindicated (eg hepatorenal impairment)
• Side effects include:
• Weight gain. Common. Lessened if an oral drug (especially
metformin) is co-prescribed
• Hypoglycaemia. Much more common with insulin than with any oral
agent

Insulin regimens
• Increasingly initiate treatment with very long-acting insulins (insulin
glargine and insulin detemir) which are effective if given just once daily.
These are particularly helpful in those who:
• Require assistance (relative, nurse) with injections
• Are frequently hypoglycaemic on other regimens, especially at night
• Would otherwise need twice-daily insulin injections plus oral drugs
• Alternative strategies, eg twice-daily insulin injections with pre-mixed
insulins (eg Humalog® Mix 25) are becoming ‘old-fashioned’. They are
rarely initiated now but some older patients have been stable for years
on such treatment so there is no advantage in changing
• Daily long-acting insulin once daily can be supplemented by oral
hypoglycaemics during the day
• If eating is very erratic, consider giving short-acting insulin after each
meal based on what has been eaten—a simple sliding scale
• Regimens based on rapid-acting insulin alone or a basal-bolus structure
(the mainstay of management in younger patients with type 1 diabetes;
provide an insulin proﬁle as close to health as possible), are rarely
appropriate in older people unless lifestyle (meals and activity) are
especially chaotic and the patient has the cognitive and physical ability
to manage dosing

Initiating insulin
• Involve the MDT (especially the diabetic nurse specialist)
• If the patient is likely to need professional support to administer insulin,
then also involve community teams—insulin administration may be
very time-consuming for them
• Patients may be very reluctant to begin, because of fears about
injections, hypos, or learning new skills
• Remember insulin administration issues: cognition, dexterity, and vision
• Pre-mixed insulins avoid having to draw up multiple types of insulin
• Insulin pens make the measuring of doses much easier for patients, but
syringes are more suitable when insulin is drawn up by a third party
(relative or nurse)
• In disposable pens, the vial is pre-loaded. This is helpful for patients
who are not so dexterous

DIABETES: INSULIN TREATMENT

• Some patients are able to self-inject, but cannot safely draw up insulin
into syringes or use an insulin pen. In this case, doses may be drawn
up in syringes by relatives or the community nurse, and stored in a
refrigerator until needed
• If insulin is given by a relative, what happens during family holidays?

Changing insulin requirements
• Always consider whether your patient is on the correct insulin regimen
(type and dose)
• Earlier in the course of the disease, insulin requirements often rise as
disease severity increases
• In advanced old age, insulin requirements often fall as appetite declines,
body weight drops, and renal function deteriorates. Type 2 diabetic
patients on insulin may get off insulin altogether. Stop insulin, maximize
oral drug treatment, and monitor regularly
• Dying patients can often have treatment withdrawn (see b ‘HOW
TO . . . Manage diabetes in the terminally ill patient’, p.434)

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetes: complications
In general, these are more common in older people, especially vascular
complications. Evidence for risk reduction in very old diabetic patients is
weak. In practice, evidence from younger age groups is extrapolated to
apply to older groups, except in the very frail and/or those with very poor
life expectancy, where a more conservative approach may be appropriate.
Make an individual decision.

Vascular
A very common cause of morbidity and mortality. The risk of MI is as high
in diabetic patients without known coronary disease as it is in non-diabetic
patients who have had an infarct.
• Improve glycaemic control to the extent that it is possible without
inducing hypoglycaemia
• Treat hypertension if it is persistent despite lifestyle management:
• Target blood pressure <140/<80mm Hg; lower if eye or kidney
disease
• In the frail, target blood pressure <150/<90mm Hg
• The drug class used is less important than the reduction in blood
pressure achieved. B-blockers are not contraindicated. ACE
inhibitors and ARBs may have an important additional effect in
preventing nephropathy
• Treat hyperlipidaemia except in the very elderly and frail. Statins are
well tolerated. The Heart Protection Study demonstrated beneﬁt in
diabetic patients with cholesterol >3.5mmol
• Stop smoking. Health beneﬁts begin in 3–6 months
• Low-dose aspirin should be offered to all older patients with diabetes
(since 10-year coronary risk is >15%) unless there is a contraindication.
Control hypertension beforehand
2In older people, blood pressure control is as important as glycaemic
control in reducing cardiovascular risk.

Neuropathy
This is more common in older diabetic people and is often asymptomatic
although may contribute to falls (see b ‘Balance and dysequilibrium’,
p.112). Annual screening is necessary: check pinprick, vibration sense, light
touch (nylon monoﬁlament), and reﬂexes.
• Classically and most commonly a distal symmetrical polyneuropathy is
seen. Consider other causes
• Mononeuropathy is usually of sudden onset, asymmetrical and
resolves over weeks or months. Often painful. May coexist with
polyneuropathy. For example:
• Third nerve palsy. Most common. Causes ophthalmoplegia
• Diabetic amyotrophy. Pelvic girdle and thigh muscle weakness and
wasting. Difﬁculty rising from chair
• Diabetic neuropathic cachexia. Painful peripheral neuropathy,
depression, anorexia and weight loss
Treatment is to exclude other causes, to optimize glycaemic control, to
control pain, and to support the patient through the illness, treating complications (eg depression) as they arise.

DIABETES: COMPLICATIONS

Nephropathy
A major problem in older diabetic people.
• Microalbuminuria indicates a group at high risk of progression. Treat
hypertension aggressively (preferentially with ACE inhibitors or ARBs),
target BP 130/80 and optimize glycaemic control
• If renal function deteriorates rapidly, exclude papillary necrosis by
obtaining emergency renal tract ultrasound

Eyes
Retinopathy, glaucoma, and cataract are common (see b ‘The eye and
systemic disease’, p.579). All diabetic people should have annual screening
ophthalmic assessment that includes retinal examination (fundoscopy
via a dilated pupil) and visual acuity testing. This is usually provided by
ophthalmic specialist clinics or by diabetologists (or other physicians)
with particular expertise. Indications for urgent referral for specialist
assessment include:
• Inadequacy of fundoscopic examination, eg due to cataract
• Diabetic maculopathy. Either exudates close (<1 optic disc diameter)
to the macula, or suspicion of macular oedema (nothing may be
observed that is abnormal, but visual acuity is impaired)
• Preproliferative changes (many cotton wool spots, ﬂame or blot
haemorrhages, venous change (beading, loops))
• Proliferative changes (pre-retinal or vitreous haemorrhage new vessels,
retinal detachment)
2Preventing blindness depends on early diagnosis of diabetes, good glycaemic control, effective retinal screening, and early treatment of maculopathy and retinopathy.

Ears
Malignant otitis externa, manifesting as severe ear pain, is more common
in diabetes (see b ‘Osteomyelitis’, p.488).

Teeth
Gum disease and caries are more common. Good oral hygiene and regular
dental assessment are essential.

Feet
Neuropathy and vascular disease lead to infection, injury, and ischaemia.
Outcomes include pain, ulceration, immobility, and amputation.
Impeccable foot care is essential (see b ‘The elderly foot’, p.490).

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Diabetic emergencies
Although overall presentations with diabetic emergencies are diminishing,
two are especially important—hypoglycaemia and hyperosmolar nonketotic state (HONK). However, older patients can present with any
diabetic problem, including diabetic ketoacidosis.

Hyperosmolar non-ketotic state
•
•
•
•
•

•

•
•

A complication of type 2 diabetes, and may be the ﬁrst presentation
Most common in older people
Often severe. Mortality is very high (10–20%)
There is often underlying sepsis, particularly pneumonia. Leucocytosis
is common, with or without infection. Have a low clinical threshold to
beginning antibiotics, after blood and urine cultures
There is usually enough endogenous insulin to suppress ketogenesis
but not hepatic glucose output. Therefore there is usually only a mild
metabolic acidosis (pH >7.3), and ketonaemia is absent or mild. Blood
glucose is often very high (>30mmol/L)
Subacute deterioration occurs. Impaired thirst and an impaired
‘osmostat’ contributing to severe dehydration with high serum
osmolarity, hypernatraemia, and uraemia. The ﬂuid deﬁcit is often
around 10L
Neurological problems are common and include delirium, coma,
seizures, or focal signs, eg hemiparesis. Only a small proportion are
in coma
Treatment elements include:
• Fluid volume resuscitation. Frequent and careful clinical assessment
and ﬂuid prescription is usually sufﬁcient to determine rate and
volume, but consider insertion of a central line in those with
cardiac or renal disease or who are shocked. In general, ﬂuid
administration should be slower than in the younger patient with
diabetic ketoacidosis. For the patient who is sick but not moribund,
2L in the ﬁrst 3hr and a total of 3–4L in the ﬁrst 12hr is often
optimal. The exception is the shocked patient, where ﬁlling should
be more aggressive, with the advice and support of ITU colleagues if
appropriate
• Correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Initially give normal saline. If
plasma sodium is very high (>155mmol/L) consider 5% dextrose
when sugars are under control (eg <12 mmol/L). Maintain serum
potassium in the range 4–5mmol/L. Give potassium with ﬂuid even
if the patient is normokalaemic, as patients are usually total body
potassium-depleted, and insulin will drive potassium into cells.
Hypokalaemia is a major cause of dysrhythmias and sudden cardiac
death
• Hyperglycaemia often responds well to rehydration and treatment
of an underlying cause (eg sepsis). Iv insulin is often needed, but
modest doses (eg 1–3 units per hr) are usually enough. Patients
with HONK are more insulin-sensitive than those with diabetic
ketoacidosis

DIABETIC EMERGENCIES

• Thromboprophylaxis. Low molecular weight heparin should always
be prescribed; some advocate full anticoagulation because the
thromboembolic complication rate is very high
• Pressure care
• Although mortality rates are high, many patients recover promptly. The
severity of presentation does not correlate closely with the severity
of underlying disease, and in some, the diabetes may subsequently be
controlled with diet alone

Hypoglycaemia
Risk of severe hypoglycaemia increases hugely with age. In older people:
• The physiological response to hypoglycaemia is weaker (eg reduced
glucagon secretion)
• Autonomic warning symptoms (eg sweating, tremor) are less marked
• Psychomotor response may be slow, even if symptoms are recognized
Other risk factors include frailty, comorbidity, renal impairment, care
home residency, social isolation, and previous hypoglycaemia.
Clinical features are often not recognized or are atypical:
• Check a sugar in any unwell known diabetic person (eg falls, confusion)
• Focal neurological signs or symptoms may be misdiagnosed as stroke.
Signs may persist for some time after correction of blood sugar
• Acute severe or chronic hypoglycaemia can cause a dementia-like
syndrome
Prevention
• Assess each patient’s risk of hypoglycaemia, and individualize therapy
• Balance the lifetime risk of hypoglycaemic attacks with reduction in
long-term complications
• If altering medications, monitor sugars closely afterwards
• Educate patient and carers about signs and symptoms, and the
therapeutic response
• Put in place alarm systems—pendant alarms, ‘check’ telephone calls,
neighbour visits etc
• Accept higher target glucose levels for those at high risk
Treatment
• ‘Hypos’ can persist for hours or days and can recur late, especially if a
long-acting insulin or oral drug is responsible. If severe, monitor closely
(if necessary by admission) for 2–3 days
• Post-event, explore why the ‘hypo’ occurred. How might the next
be prevented, or better treated? Many patients have lost weight or
appetite and require a substantially reduced hypoglycaemic prescription

433

434

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

HOW TO . . . Manage diabetes in the terminally ill patient
This includes end-of-life situations in all disease, not just cancer.
The sole aim of therapy is to minimize symptoms of hypo- and
hyperglycaemia.
Ensure that family and carers understand the changed aims of
treatment and the rationale for medication changes.
Involve community nursing teams and diabetes specialist nursing
teams early, particularly if you are planning a discharge from hospital
to home.
Drug treatment
• As weight declines and oral intake falls, lower doses of insulin and
oral drugs are usually needed
• Dose reductions will also be needed as renal function declines
• Make stepwise reductions in drug(s) and assess response
• In some cases, drugs may be phased out completely. For example,
type 2 patients on insulin may now manage on oral drugs alone;
those on oral drugs may be asymptomatic off them
• Type 1 patients require insulin until the very latest stages of dying (eg
coma). Simpliﬁcation of an insulin regimen (eg a move to once daily
insulin) is often helpful, and may allow a patient to be cared for at
home
Diet
Encourage food and ﬂuid of whatever type is acceptable and attractive
to the patient. Rigidly imposed diabetic diets are futile and unkind—it
is usually better to encourage food of whatever type can be taken, and
to accept the (usually modest) consequences for glycaemic control.
Blood glucose monitoring
• Monitoring should be tailored to the individual patient. In general,
testing can be relaxed
• In all cases, test if symptoms suggest hypo- or hyperglycaemia
• In patients who are clinically stable (ie their condition is steady) or
slowly deteriorating, testing can be infrequent (perhaps once on
alternate days)
• In patients whose condition is deteriorating, or in those who have
begun steroids, or where diabetes treatment has recently been
changed, then testing should be more frequent
• In the patient who is moribund or comatose due to terminal illness,
testing is pointless

DIABETIC EMERGENCIES

HOW TO . . . Interpret thyroid function tests
See Table 15.1.
• TSH is the most useful screening test. It can also be used to monitor
treatment of thyroid disease. TSH takes 6–8 weeks to respond to
changes in serum T3 and T4 so don’t rush to repeat tests too often.
If TSH is abnormal check free T4
• Total thyroxine (total T4 and total T3) is affected by changes in
thyroid binding globulin (TBG). Some drugs inﬂuence TBG, eg
glucocorticoids, androgens decrease TBG levels while oestrogens,
tamoxifen, and raloxifene increase TBG levels
• Free T4 (FT4) has replaced total thyroxine measurement in most
centres as it is less inﬂuenced by changes in TBG
• Free T3 is useful to monitor thyrotoxicosis especially if T4 is not
elevated with a suppressed TSH

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hypothyroidism: diagnosis
Common: up to 5% prevalence in older men, 15% in older women.
Incidence increases with age.

Causes
Primary autoimmune disease (Hashimoto’s disease, usually without goitre)
is by far the most likely cause, unless iatrogenic causes are present (eg drugs
(amiodarone, antithyroid drugs), previous hyperthyroidism treatment
(radioiodine or surgery), head/neck radiotherapy).

Presentation
• Onset is usually insidious: over months, years, or decades
• Very variable presentation, often unmasked by intercurrent illness.
In older people, symptoms and signs are more often mild and nonspeciﬁc. None or all of the following may occur:
• Hypothermia, cold intolerance
• Dry skin, thinning hair
• Weight gain or loss, constipation
• Malaise
• Falls, immobility, weakness, myalgia, arthralgia, elevated CK
• Bradycardia, heart failure, pleural or pericardial effusion, non-pitting
oedema of feet and hands (myxoedema)
• Depression or cognitive slowing. Frank dementia is very rare
• Hyporeﬂexia with delayed relaxation phase; ataxia or non-speciﬁc
gait disturbance
• Anaemia. Often normocytic; less commonly macrocytic or
microcytic (reduced Fe absorption)
• Hyponatraemia, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia
• Symptoms of hypothyroidism are very common in the euthyroid older
population. Often, only treatment reveals which symptoms were due
to hypothyroidism

Investigation
• Have a low threshold for thyroid function testing, in view of high disease
incidence, poor sensitivity of clinical assessment alone, and the ease
and effectiveness of treatment
• Opportunistic screening of older people in primary care (eg at yearly
health assessment) and secondary care (eg on presentation to acute
medical take) is probably justiﬁed. But beware of abnormal TFTs due
to sick euthyroid syndrome (see b ‘The ageing endocrine system’,
p.420)
• Overt primary (thyroid gland failure) hypothyroidism is conﬁrmed when
TSH is high and free T4 is low. TSH elevations may be less marked in
older people
• Subclinical or ‘compensated’ hypothyroidism is suggested when TSH is
high, but free T4 is normal (although often towards the lower end of
the normal range). T3 production from T4 is stimulated by TSH, so
may be well maintained. The patient is often asymptomatic, but may
have higher risks of atherosclerosis and MI. Careful screening often
reveals symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism

HYPOTHYROIDISM: DIAGNOSIS

• Thyroid masses are sometimes found on examination. USS, isotope
scanning ± FNA will help characterize them. Malignant nodules are
usually non-secreting (‘cold’), so new single nodules in a euthyroid
patient merit further evaluation
• Anti-thyroid antibodies have reasonable sensitivity and speciﬁcity in
conﬁrming autoimmune hypothyroidism, and may help management
in subclinical disease
2If patients have persistent lethargy despite successful treatment consider
alternative diagnoses, including other autoimmune disease, eg coeliac
disease, Addison’s disease, or pernicious anaemia.

437

438

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hypothyroidism: treatment
• Overt (or ‘clinical’) hypothyroidism should always be treated. The patient
might believe themselves to be asymptomatic, but could feel much
improved with treatment
• Subclinical hypothyroidism should be treated if there are symptoms
Consider treatment if:
• TSH is particularly high, or free T3/T4 only just within normal limits
• Thyroid autoantibodies are positive (rate of transformation to
overt hypothyroidism is much higher: ~25% compared with 5% per
annum) or there is another autoimmune condition
In other cases, monitor clinically and biochemically every 6–12 months,
but have a low threshold for starting what is a very safe treatment.

Starting treatment
• Begin levothyroxine (T4) at low dose—usually 25micrograms daily.
More rapid initiation risks precipitating angina, insomnia, anxiety,
diarrhoea, and tremor
• Dosing is optimized biochemically—symptoms and signs alone are very
misleading
• Repeat TFTs monthly or 6-weekly, increasing the dose of T4 in
25micrograms increments
• TSH levels guide dosage; T3 and T4 levels are not needed
• Aim for a TSH in the mid-range of normal, say 1–3 mU/L
• Overtreatment (TSH too low) risks AF and osteoporosis
• Undertreatment risks physical and cognitive slowing, weakness and
depression
• Older people usually require slightly less T4—usually
50–125micrograms daily is sufﬁcient
• Heavier people require proportionately more T4 than lighter people
• T4 half-life is around 1 week. Therefore, if ﬁne-tuning of dosing is
needed, simply alternate higher and lower doses, eg 100/125micrograms
on alternate days

Long-term management
• Tell the patient that treatment is for life
• Check thyroid function every year and if clinically indicated
• In the very long term, thyroxine requirements may rise, fall, or remain
unchanged

Administration
• Foods reduce absorption—take on an empty stomach, usually ﬁrst
thing in the morning
• If a dose is missed, take it as soon as remembered, and the next dose
as normal
• If compliance is a problem, twice weekly or weekly administration (of
proportionately higher doses) gives acceptable control

HYPOTHYROIDISM: TREATMENT

Thyroxine—interactions with other drugs
• Antiepileptics (phenytoin, primidone, and carbamazepine), barbiturates
and rifampicin increase thyroid hormone metabolism, so a higher T4
dose may be needed
• Colestyramine, iron, calcium, and antacids (eg aluminium hydroxide)
reduce T4 absorption. Give T4 at least 2hr beforehand
• Amiodarone has complex effects. Monitor TFTs regularly. (See b ‘HOW
TO . . . Manage amiodarone-induced thyroid dysfunction’, p.139)
• B-blockers may reduce conversion of T4 to T3

Disease–drug interactions
As thyroid disease is controlled, dose changes of the following may be
needed: diabetic drugs (insulin and oral hypoglycaemics), digoxin, warfarin,
theophylline, corticosteroids.

439

440

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hyperthyroidism: diagnosis
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is more common in older people (prevalence
3%), but severe disease is less common (incidence 0.1% per year in older
women, 0.01% per year in older men).

Causes
• Toxic nodular goitre. The most common cause in older people. There
is often slow (years) progression from smooth goitre (euthyroid) to
multinodular goitre (euthyroid). Then nodule(s) begin autonomous
function, with subclinical and then clinical hyperthyroidism. It does not
remit, but may be relatively mild and indolent
• Graves’ disease. The thyroid is stimulated by autoantibodies.
Exophthalmos and diffuse goitre are less common than in younger
people; 40% have no palpable goitre. Many remit within a year, perhaps
more so than in younger patients
• Exogenous levothyroxine, ie overtreatment of hypothyroidism. This
usually occurs insidiously when age-related slowing in T4 metabolism is
not paralleled by reductions in the dose of T4.
• Less common causes include:
• Amiodarone (see b ‘Amiodarone’, p.138), and other sources of
excess iodine
• Subacute thyroiditis and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. There is transient
thyroid hormone excess due to gland destruction. Suspect if acute
hyperthyroidism occurs with sore throat or tender neck. There may
be an associated viral syndrome or upper respiratory tract infection
• Single autonomous nodule (Plummer’s disease)
• Malignant T4-secreting thyroid tumours and pituitary/non-pituitary TSHsecreting tumours
2Distinguishing between the two very common causes (toxic nodular
goitre and Graves’ disease) is relatively unimportant, as treatment is
similar. However, always consider the possibility of drugs (thyroxine or
amiodarone) or acute thyroiditis, where treatment is clearly different.

Presentation
In older people with overt hyperthyroidism:
• Presentation may be more subtle, with fewer symptoms and signs
• Diagnosis is often delayed. Features are attributed to comorbidity or
suppressed by B-blockers
• ‘Negative’ symptoms may dominate (‘apathetic hyperthyroidism’), eg
anorexia, weight loss, fatigue, weakness, and depression. Non-speciﬁc
symptoms are more common eg nausea, weakness, functional decline
• More classical symptoms of sympathetic overactivation may be absent
eg tremor, restlessness, sweating, tachycardia and hypertension
• Cardiovascular complications are more common, eg angina, heart
failure, AF (although ventricular response may be slow)
• Constipation is more common than diarrhoea
• Increased bone turnover leads to hypercalcaemia and osteoporosis

HYPERTHYROIDISM: INVESTIGATION

Hyperthyroidism: investigation
Thyroid function tests
• Have a low threshold for testing in older people, especially if there is a
personal or family history of thyroid disease
• Screening is recommended by some—at least every 5 years in
women >60
• Low TSH is sensitive but not speciﬁc to hyperthyroidism
• Drugs or non-thyroidal illness can suppress TSH below normal, but
it usually remains detectable (0.1–0.5mU/L)
• Very low TSH levels (<0.1mU/L), indicating total suppression of
TSH secretion, are more speciﬁc to hyperthyroidism
• Overt hyperthyroidism
• In most cases, TSH is undetectable and both T4 and T3 are high
• Elevated T3 without T4 (‘T3 toxicosis’) suggests toxic nodules or
relapsing Graves’, and is treated as hyperthyroidism
• Elevated T4 but normal T3 (due to reduced peripheral conversion)
suggests intercurrent illness
• In severe hyperthyroidism, T4 may be normal (reduced binding
globulin). Free T4 remains high
• Acute systemic illness in euthyroid people may cause transient
(days) elevation of T4. TSH will be normal or moderately low
• Subclinical hyperthyroidism
• This is common: up to 5% point prevalence of decreased TSH in
healthy older people. TSH levels are low, with normal (often high
normal) free T3 and T4
• In most cases, TSH levels revert to normal within a year
• Progression to overt hyperthyroidism occurs in <10% per year
• Symptoms are few, but there is an increased risk of osteoporosis,
AF, LVH, and possibly dementia
• Consider the possibility that non-thyroidal illness (rather than
thyroid hormone excess) may be suppressing TSH production

Anti-thyroid antibodies
• Their presence supports a diagnosis of Graves’ disease, especially if a
smooth goitre is also palpable, but they are not wholly speciﬁc
• Antibody tests are usually negative in toxic nodular goitre
• Graves’ and toxic nodular goitre are both common and can coexist. In
that case a nodular goitre may be palpable, with positive antibodies
• If Graves’ disease is likely, screen for pernicious anaemia and coeliac
disease (using relevant autoantibody tests and vitamin B12 levels)

Thyroid radioisotope scanning
This can help conﬁrm the cause of hyperthyroidism and to determine
glandular size prior to radioiodine treatment.
• In thyroiditis, uptake is low or very low. Inﬂammatory markers are up
• In Graves’, there is a diffuse pattern of increased uptake
• In toxic nodular goitre, there are multiple ‘hot’ nodules with
surrounding ‘cold’ tissue
• A single autonomous ‘hot’ nodule is surrounded by ‘cold’ tissue

441

442

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hyperthyroidism: drug treatment
Overt hyperthyroidism should always be treated, even if mild.
Several options are available for immediate and long-term treatment.
Select on an individual basis, depending on the likely diagnosis, severity of
illness and patient characteristics, and preferences.

Drug treatment: thioamides (carbimazole or
propylthiouracil)
• Suitable for initial management of Grave’s disease or toxic nodular
goitre
• In Graves’ disease this is an option for long-term therapy, as there is
a greater probability of long-term remission than in younger people.
Duration of treatment is usually 18 months, after which treatment is
stopped and regular monitoring continues. Relapse risk is ~50% and
is more likely if disease is severe, there is a large goitre, or antibody
levels are high. If relapse occurs, begin thioamides again, and refer for
deﬁnitive treatment (usually radioiodine)
• In toxic nodular goitre, long-term remission is less commonly achieved
using thioamides. They are therefore used either:
• Short-term, to achieve euthyroidism prior to deﬁnitive treatment
(usually radioiodine)
• Long-term, in the frail patient in whom life expectancy is short
• Initial daily dose: carbimazole 20–40mg, propylthiouracil 200–400mg
(once daily or divided dose)
• Full thyroid suppression takes several weeks. Continue the initial dose
for 4–8 weeks, until euthyroid. Measure free T4 every 2 weeks to
assess when euthyroid state is achieved as TSH may be suppressed for
months despite adequate treatment
• Once control is achieved, there are two options, with similar
outcomes:
• Titration regimen. Thioamide dose is reduced gradually, guided
by TFTs, to a maintenance dose of carbimazole 5–15mg or
propylthiouracil 50–150mg daily
• Block and replace regimen. Thioamide dose is maintained high,
entirely switching off thyroid synthetic function. Introduce
levothyroxine once free T4 is suppressed
• Side effects include:
• Skin rash or pruritus. Continue treatment. Try antihistamines. Try
switching thioamides
• Fever, arthralgia, headache, and gastrointestinal symptoms are
usually mild
• Agranulocytosis. This is uncommon, but more frequent in older
people. Usually occurs early in treatment. Check FBC regularly
(monthly until stable). It is vital to advise patient and/or relative that
the drug must be stopped and urgent advice sought if fever, sore
throat, mouth ulcers, or other symptoms of infection develop

HYPERTHYROIDISM: DRUG TREATMENT

Drug treatment: B-blockers
• Used for rapid symptomatic treatment (tremor, anxiety, angina)
and to reduce the risk of dysrhythmia. There is no effect on the
hypermetabolic state itself
• May be especially useful in those with known structural or ischaemic
heart disease or who are tachycardic, but should be introduced
cautiously, with regular monitoring. Digoxin is ineffective in controlling
AF in hyperthyroidism
• Check carefully for contraindications (eg asthma)
• All B-blockers are effective. Atenolol is a good choice, as it may
be given od. Metoprolol and propranolol must be given tds or qds
(increased hepatic metabolism in hyperthyroidism)
• They have a role:
• In Graves’ or toxic nodular goitre as an adjunct to thioamides
• Where hyperthyroidism is only mild, B-blockers may be the only
drugs needed prior to deﬁnitive treatment with radioiodine
• In thyroiditis. The hyperthyroid state is transient, and B-blockers
alone may be sufﬁcient treatment until the disease moves onto
euthyroidism or hypothyroidism

Subclinical hyperthyroidism
• If due to excess T4 in a patient with treated hypothyroidism, reduce
dose by 25micrograms and recheck TFTs in 6 weeks
• In other cases, in order to protect bone, heart, and brain, consider
treatment as for overt hyperthyroidism. This is especially indicated if:
• There is osteopenia or heart disease, or signiﬁcant risk factors
• Suppressed TSH is persistent, or severe, or T3/4 levels are at the
higher limits of normality
• If treatment is not begun, reassess every 3–6 months

Atrial ﬁbrillation and hyperthyroidism
• Occurs in 10–15%. Most revert to sinus rhythm within weeks of
becoming euthyroid, unless AF has been present for many months
• Digoxin is usually ineffective in controlling ventricular rate. B-blockade
is more effective
• Consider cardioversion if AF persists for 4 months in new-onset AF
• Anticoagulate with warfarin to target INR 2–3. While hyperthyroid,
patients are relatively hypersensitive to warfarin
See b ‘Atrial ﬁbrillation’, p.276.

Amiodarone and thyroid disease
Incidence of amiodarone-induced thyroid disease is high in older people
because of this cumulative exposure and the drug’s very long half-life.
• Clinical assessment alone is insensitive. Check TFTs before amiodarone
treatment, and then every 3–6 months. If amiodarone is stopped,
continue TFT monitoring for several years
• For the clinical features and management of amiodarone-induced hypoand hyperthyroidism, see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage amiodaroneinduced thyroid dysfunction’, p.139

443

444

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hyperthyroidism: non-drug treatment
Radioiodine (I131)
• Radioiodine is effective, well tolerated, safe, and simply administered.
The sole contraindications are:
• When safe disposal of radioactive body ﬂuids after treatment
cannot be guaranteed (eg home drainage is not into the main
sewer) This can usually be overcome
• In early treatment of hyperthyroidism, when administration of the
iodine load can precipitate thyrotoxic crisis
• Radioiodine is especially useful if there are drug intolerances,
polypharmacy, or comorbidities
• Give once initial symptomatic control has been achieved with drugs
• Thioamides must be stopped several days before administration of
radioiodine (to permit uptake) and are usually restarted several days
after (to prevent thyroid storm). Permanently discontinue thioamides
after 3–4 months if TFTs are satisfactory
• Estimating the dose of I131 required to render a patient euthyroid is
difﬁcult
• On average, larger doses are needed for patients with toxic nodular
goitre (cf. Graves’), larger goitres, in severe disease and in men
• Most centres give a single larger dose (400–600MBq) that controls
hyperthyroidism in most cases, but leads to early hypothyroidism
in up to 50%. A second dose is needed for a minority who remain
hyperthyroid
• Post-treatment, TFTs should be checked every 4–6 weeks for the ﬁrst
year, and then lifelong at reduced frequency but at least every year for
life
• Secondary hypothyroidism may occur early (weeks, often transient))
or late (years). Eventually up to 90% become hypothyroid. There may
be an early (weeks) rise in TSH that is transient and does not need
treatment if there are no symptoms
• If the patient remains hyperthyroid at 6 months, then repeat I131 dosing
is usually needed

Surgery
This is rarely performed in older people, considered only if both drug and
radioiodine treatment are problematic, or if a large goitre is especially
troublesome. The patient must be euthyroid before surgery; B-blockade
alone is not sufﬁcient. Lifelong postoperative thyroid function monitoring
is essential.

HYPERTHYROIDISM: NON-DRUG TREATMENT

Life-threatening thyroid emergencies
Thyroid storm
A rare but life-threatening manifestation of hyperthyroidism
• Most commonly seen in patients with undiagnosed hyperthyroidism,
often precipitated by non-thyroidal illness (including surgery, sepsis,
or trauma) or administration of iodine-containing drugs
• Very rarely seen after radioiodine treatment
• Features include delirium, restlessness, coma, fever, vomiting, heart
failure, tachycardia, and myocardial ischaemia
• The diagnosis is clinical—TFTs are often no worse than in typical
hyperthyroidism
• Support failing organs, treat the underlying cause(s) and seek urgent
specialist advice
• Antithyroid drugs and iodide may be given intravenously to reduce
thyroid hormone synthesis
• B-blockers and corticosteroids reduce the peripheral activity of
thyroid hormones
Myxoedema coma
A rare but life-threatening manifestation of hypothyroidism
• More common in older people, presenting as circulatory and
respiratory failure and progressive drowsiness leading to coma, often
with ﬁts
• There is usually an acute precipitant (eg infection) in a patient with
chronic hypothyroidism
• Think of this also in patients who have stopped taking or absorbing
levothyroxine

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Primary adrenal insufﬁciency
Also known as Addison’s disease.

Presentation
Usually insidious and often non-speciﬁc onset:
• Symptoms include fatigue (helped by rest), weight loss, anorexia,
abdominal pain, nausea, constipation, hypotension (orthostatic and
supine), depression, delirium, and decreased functional status
• Skin and mucous membrane hyperpigmentation is common, but is a
late sign and may be absent. Pigmentation affects sun-exposed and
unexposed areas, especially scars and pressure points
• Electrolyte disturbance (hyponatraemia and hyperkalaemia) and a mild
acidosis (bicarbonate 15–20mmol) are usually present. Hypoglycaemia
and mild anaemia may be present
2In some people with impaired adrenocortical function, there may be
no symptoms when well, but acute stress (trauma, illness, psychological)
leads to adrenal crisis with shock. If the possibility of adrenal insufﬁciency
crosses your mind, then test for it, with a short ACTH stimulation test.

Causes
• Mostly autoimmune. Often evidence of other autoimmune disease
• TB is relatively more common in older people
• Uncommonly due to: metastases, lymphoma, haemorrhage or
infarction. Very rarely due to: drugs, eg ketoconazole

Diagnosis
Serum cortisol
Cortisol is secreted episodically, so do not make or exclude a diagnosis
on the basis of a single measurement
• A very low cortisol level (<100nmol) makes adrenal insufﬁciency likely,
especially if the patient is stressed/unwell at the time
• A moderately high (>300nmol) cortisol level makes adrenal
insufﬁciency unlikely
• In Addison’s, a random cortisol may be low or normal, ie normal level
does not exclude Addison’s
• Early morning (6–8am) cortisol levels should be higher—a low level is
more likely to be signiﬁcant
• Short ACTH stimulation test (‘Synacthen® test’). The only test that has
good sensitivity and speciﬁcity. See b ‘HOW TO . . . Perform a short
ACTH stimulation test (short Synacthen® test)’, p.411
• Adrenal autoantibodies are positive in many autoimmune cases
• AXR and CXR may show signs of TB (eg calciﬁcation)
• Adrenal CT or MRI reveals a small gland in autoimmune disease, large if
infection or tumour
If adrenal insufﬁciency is diagnosed, exclude secondary adrenal insufﬁciency (pituitary failure).
• Check gonadotrophins (follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing
hormone, and TSH
• ACTH is elevated in primary adrenal insufﬁciency, low in secondary

PRIMARY ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

Treatment
If the patient is unwell, do not delay treatment pending the results of
tests: ﬂuid resuscitate with iv normal saline, normalize electrolytes, and
give high-dose iv or im hydrocortisone (100mg tds). Improvement should
occur quickly.
Long-term treatment includes oral glucocorticoids (usually hydrocortisone 20mg am, 10mg pm) and mineralocorticoids (usually ﬂudrocortisone 0.1mg).
On treatment, older people are much more likely to develop hypertension that may require mineralocorticoid dose reduction and non-diuretic
antihypertensive drugs.
Older people have a worse prognosis, due to more sinister causation
(TB, malignancy) and possibly later presentation.

Adrenal ‘incidentalomas’
• An ‘incidentaloma’ is a tumour detected by scanning (ultrasound, CT,
or MRI) that is unrelated to the indication for the scan
• Adrenal incidentalomas are relatively common (0.5–1% of scans)
They are more common in older people and the hypertensive. Key
questions are ‘Is it malignant?’ and ‘Is it functional?’
• Adrenal insufﬁciency does not occur unless both glands are almost
totally destroyed
• Signs of a functional nodule include hypertension and hypokalaemia
Adrenal adenomas are very common and usually small (<2cm), benign
and non-functional. Fine-needle biopsy helps exclude malignancy if scan
appearances are worrying, but usually only observation (periodic scanning) is needed. The larger the tumour, the higher the chance of malignancy. Large tumours should generally be excised, as biopsy may not
identify foci of malignancy.
Metastases are common (primary: breast, bronchus, bowel). Scan
appearances are usually diagnostic.
Cysts and lipomas make up most of the remainder.
Benign adrenal cysts are common in older people and may be due to
cystic degeneration or local infarction.
Tuberculosis may seed haematogenously, causing adrenal masses, often
calciﬁed.
Non-functional adrenal carcinoma usually presents late, with
retroperitoneal spread and distant metastases.

CHAPTER 15

Endocrinology

Hormone replacement therapy and the
menopause
The menopause (cessation of menstruation due to ovarian failure) occurs
typically between ages 45 and 55. The diagnosis can usually be made
clinically. If the presentation is atypical, consider alternative diagnoses,
eg hyperthyroidism. Following menopause, the risk of osteoporosis and
vascular disease increases substantially. Symptoms can occur for several
years before and after menopause and can be disabling. They include:
• Hot ﬂushes
• Genitourinary atrophy
• Insomnia, depressed mood, and cognitive symptoms
HRT with oestrogen (plus progestogen in those with an intact uterus):
• Is an effective treatment for peri-menopausal symptoms
• Does not improve well-being in those with no symptoms
• Does not improve cognitive function or prevent dementia
• Increases the risk of stroke, coronary events, pulmonary embolism,
and breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer. Increased risk (cumulative
serious events) is 1 in 1000 if treated for 1 year, 1 in 100 if treated for
5 years
• Reduces colon and rectal cancer and hip fracture by small amounts, but
is no longer recommended for osteoporosis treatment
In those with menopausal symptoms:
Consider non-systemic treatments, eg topical oestrogens for atrophic
vaginitis (vaginal cream or tablets, given daily for 2 weeks, then once or
twice weekly for 6–8 weeks; sometimes needed long term). There is
some systemic absorption; the risk of endometrial cancer is unknown. In
those with reduced manual dexterity, consider a slow-release vaginal ring
(replaced after 90 days)
Other drugs that can help, but are less effective than systemic oestrogens
include:
• Progestogens, eg medroxyprogesterone, megestrol
• Herbal remedies, some of which may have oestrogen-like activity
• Clonidine (an A-adrenoceptor stimulant; usual dose 50–75micrograms
bd) may reduce hot ﬂushes. Side effects are often problematic. Watch BP
If symptoms continue, consider HRT, explaining the risks and beneﬁts.
• Start treatment at low dose, increasing gradually until symptoms are
controlled
• Explain that HRT is a short-term, and not indeﬁnite, treatment
• Every few months, taper the dose of HRT, assessing whether ongoing
treatment is needed. Hot ﬂushes usually cease after a few months to a
few (<5) years

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY AND THE MENOPAUSE

Increasing numbers of women have taken HRT for very prolonged periods
and are being seen more frequently in geriatric practice. In each case, the
risks and beneﬁts of continuing HRT must be assessed. In most cases, the
advice will be to stop HRT:
• Risk is probably cumulative (dose and duration)
• Risk is probably multiplicative (non-HRT risk × HRT-related risk). As
background risk of cancer and vascular disease rises exponentially in
older people, so the net added risk of HRT is higher in older people
• In most cases, HRT may be withdrawn without recurrence of
menopause symptoms
• In most cases, HRT will have been started (and the patient last advised)
when the risks were not appreciated
2HRT is an effective treatment for symptoms, but has potentially serious
side effects.

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

The ageing haematopoietic system
There are very few changes as the bone marrow ages. Be very reluctant
to ascribe changes seen on testing to age alone—pathology is much more
likely.

Haemoglobin
• Epidemiological studies show that population haemoglobin (Hb)
concentration gradually declines from age 60
• There is debate as to whether the reference range should be adjusted
since lower Hb levels are associated with increased morbidity and
mortality compared with older patients who maintain normal levels
• Thus anaemia is common in old age (between 10–20% will have Hb less
than 12g/dL in females or 13g/dL in males), but this is due to disease(s)
not ageing per se
• The decision about whether to investigate anaemia should be made
not on the absolute value but the clinical scenario. Consider symptoms,
past medical history, severity of anaemia and rate of fall of Hb, the
mean cell volume (MCV) and ﬁnally patient’s wish/tolerance of
investigation
• A ﬁt elderly man with no signiﬁcant past history merits investigation
with an Hb of 11.5 g/dL (especially if his Hb g/dL was 13 last year or if
the MCV is abnormal) while a patient with known rheumatoid arthritis,
renal failure and heart failure who has a normocytic anaemia 10.5 g/dL
for years usually does not

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
• The height of the red cells in a standard bottle of blood, after being
allowed to sediment for 60min
• This is a simple, old fashioned and non-speciﬁc test however it is
inexpensive and remains useful for screening and monitoring disease in
older people. CRP is often used in conjunction
• Red cells fall gradually because they are more dense, but the rate of fall
increases where the cells clump together
• ESR rises with age and is slightly higher in women so values up to
30mm/hr for men and 35mm/hr for women can be normal at age 70
• Anaemia can cause a mild elevation in ESR
• A high ESR occurs in disorders associated with elevated plasma
proteins (ﬁbrinogen and globulins). Numerous acute and chronic
disorders can cause modest elevation
• Very high levels (>90) are commonly found with paraproteinaemias,
giant cell arteritis and chronic infections such as tuberculosis

INVESTIGATING ANAEMIA IN OLDER PEOPLE

Investigating anaemia in older people
A low haemoglobin is a frequently encountered abnormality in geriatric
practice. It is worth remembering the following:
• Other parameters, usually documented in the full blood count report
(eg MCV) will greatly assist in characterising the anaemia, and should
be scrutinized
• Looking up old FBC results will often reveal a pattern eg a frail older
person may run a chronically low Hb because of chronic disease or
marrow failure. If there is a recent change, this should prompt more
urgent investigation
• Unwell older patients may have low Hb as a result of ﬂuid overload or
marrow suppression. Repeat FBC as they recover, and see if it persists
• Multiple aetiology is common, so check a full range of blood tests in all
anaemic older patients
• It is very important to check that the laboratory have received the
correct blood specimens for these tests before arranging blind
replacement therapy or a transfusion—subsequent samples will be
invalid for haematinics
Most anaemic patients will require:
• Blood ﬁlm
• Ferritin, serum iron and total iron binding capacity (or transferrin)
• B12, folate
• Renal, liver and thyroid function testing
• Blood and urine electrophoresis and look for Bence Jones proteins in
urine if the ESR is raised
If the anaemia has been characterized (eg iron deﬁcient, macrocytic etc.),
then decisions can be made about the nature and extent of further testing.
See b ‘Iron deficiency anaemia: diagnosis’, p.454 for details.
If the picture is mixed, then there may be multiple contributing factors
(eg chronic kidney disease, minor gastritis, early myelodysplasia)—list
these and address each in turn.

453

454

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Iron deﬁciency anaemia: diagnosis
This is the most common cause of microcytosis (but beware the occasional patient with lifelong microcytosis who has an inherited thalassaemia
or sideroblastic anaemia).

Causes
• Most common is occult blood loss in the gut especially in patients
taking NSAIDs (even 75mg aspirin)
• Malabsorption (eg coeliac disease, gastrectomy, achlorhydria due to
atrophic gastritis or use of PPIs)
• Malnutrition as a sole cause is very unusual
2Multifactorial aetiology is common—eg mild chronic blood loss, borderline dietary intake and mild malabsorption syndromes

Diagnosis
History is vital (ask about weight loss and gut, kidney, urogenital, or ENT
blood loss). Pallor (conjunctivae, nail beds) may be found. The emphasis
of examination should be to ﬁnd rectal or abdominal masses, hepatomegaly, and lymphadenopathy.

Investigations
• Microcytosis usual but not in combined deﬁciency or acute blood loss
• Low serum ferritin levels (<12micrograms/L) are diagnostic.
Moderately low levels (12–45micrograms/L) may also point to the
diagnosis as ferritin levels rise with age. Ferritin is an acute phase
reactant so normal/high levels don’t rule out deﬁciency
• Serum iron levels will be low with high iron binding capacity, ie the
ratio of iron/iron binding will be low (<15%). This is a useful way of
distinguishing the anaemia of chronic disorder where both iron and
iron binding are low (and the ratio will be normal) (see also Table 16.1)
• Low iron stores on a bone marrow trephine are diagnostic but this
investigation is painful and rarely required
• Faecal occult blood is of limited value in cases of established iron
deﬁciency—it is usually positive and you may feel that further
gastrointestinal tests are needed anyhow

IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA: DIAGNOSIS

• Haematuria sufﬁcient to cause anaemia is rare, and usually severe.
Urinalysis may be indicated in patients with poor vision or cognition to
look for renal tract blood loss
• Iron deﬁciency without anaemia should still be investigated but the
lower the Hb the higher the likelihood of ﬁnding attributable pathology

HOW TO . . . Investigate iron deﬁciency anaemia
The main dilemma is deciding how far to take investigations.
A ﬁt patient, who would be a candidate for surgery, should have a
minimum of OGD and colon imaging (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Image the
older colon’, p.373). These should proceed regardless of the degree of
anaemia and whether there are symptoms. The ﬁnding of oesophagitis
or an upper gastrointestinal ulcer should not stop a screening test for
the colon to rule out a coexisting neoplasm. If these tests are negative,
screen for coeliac disease (eg endomysial antibody) and haematuria.
Small bowel barium studies or capsule endoscopy are sometimes helpful.
If there is intermittent overt gastrointestinal blood loss mesenteric
angiograms can demonstrate small angiodysplastic lesions if there is
active haemorrhage.
At the other extreme a frail, bed-bound nursing home patient with
dementia will probably merit empirical iron and PPI therapy without
further investigations.
In between these extremes physicians often adopt a ‘half way
house’. Some examples of this compromise include:
• Not proceeding to lower gastrointestinal tests if upper
gastrointestinal pathology is found
• Where NSAIDs are the likely problem, stop the drug, give iron, and
a PPI, and only investigate if the anaemia or evidence of bleeding
continues after a suitable therapeutic trial
• Not performing lower gastrointestinal tests if the patient is not ﬁt
for, or not consenting to surgical intervention
• Performing a ﬂexible sigmoidoscopy rather than a full colonoscopy
(80% of tumours can be excluded this way without complete bowel
preparation and with less risk and discomfort)
• Using oral contrast-enhanced CT colography to image the colon
(better tolerated) will miss small lesions but excludes large tumours
• Assuming that very longstanding and stable iron deﬁciency (several
years) presents low risk for a malignant source
There are no hard rules about making these decisions but it is advisable that any risk-taking is shared with the patient and/or relative and
that you record your discussions in the notes. Remember that:
• Investigations are often better tolerated than you would expect,
eg OGD remains a very safe test even in very old people
• Sometimes it is worth doing tests even if deﬁnitive treatment is not
available, eg for a frail patient with bloody diarrhoea a sigmoidoscopy
may yield an alternative diagnosis or guide future palliative therapy
• A second medical opinion may help
Most patients are highly persuadable—if you do want them to take an
active part in decisions you will need to give an unbiased view of their
options—‘You don’t want one of those unpleasant dangerous endoscopies do you?’ does not present the patient with a fair choice.

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Iron deﬁciency anaemia: treatment
Treatment is often simple. Treat the underlying cause, and replenish iron
stores. The underlying marrow is usually healthy. Hb should rise by about
0.5g/dL/week.
Blood transfusion is expensive, usually unnecessary and can be
dangerous. It should be used only for severe symptoms (eg unstable
angina) or where ongoing acute bleeding is present.

Enteral iron
• Oral supplements (ferrous sulphate 200mg od to tds) are very effective
but compliance is often poor due to gastrointestinal side effects
(constipation, nausea, diarrhoea)
• Sometimes a different preparation (ie ferrous gluconate or fumarate) is
better tolerated
• Start with low dose and increase as tolerated. It is better to take a
lower dose for longer than abandon treatment after a few days due to
side effects. Alternate day supplementation is often sufﬁcient
• If stool is not greeny-black, concordance is poor
• Avoid slow-release preparations, as they are often poorly absorbed
• Remember that achlorhydria (atrophic gastritis or PPI administration)
signiﬁcantly reduces iron absorption

Failure to respond to enteral iron
This should prompt consideration of the following:
• Is there ongoing haemorrhage?
• Is the patient concordant with therapy?
• Are there other contributory factors (eg kidney disease)
• Is the iron being absorbed?

Parenteral iron therapy
• Use is increasing with the development of safer preparations
• Consider if blood loss exceeds ability of gut to absorb oral iron
(eg with angiodysplasia), the patient does not tolerate oral iron, or the
oral iron is not adequately absorbed (eg with atrophic gastritis)
• Also used in renal patients on erythropoietin (need adequate iron for
response) and those with inﬂammatory bowel disease (often intolerant
of oral iron)
• Iv infusions of iron sucrose (Venofer®), ferric carboxymaltose
(Ferinject®) or iron dextran (CosmoFer®) can be given
• Risk of anaphylaxis, so test dose recommended and there should be
resuscitation facilities available
• Ferric carboxymaltose has a lower risk of anaphylaxis and can be
infused quite quickly (over 15min) so is often preferred
• Im preparations are rarely used

Duration of iron therapy
Continue iron for 3 months after the haemoglobin concentration has normalized (to replenish the iron stores) but don’t leave the patient on lifelong treatment unless you are unable to trace or treat the cause of ongoing
blood loss. Monitoring haemoglobin off iron can guide management by
telling you whether blood loss continues; iron overload is not without risk.

MACROCYTIC ANAEMIA

Macrocytic anaemia
Causes
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

B12 deﬁciency—usually malabsorption
Folate deﬁciency—often dietary but also consider coeliac disease
Myelodysplasia
Aplastic anaemia
Hypothyroidism
Myeloma
Liver failure and alcohol excess
Drugs, eg methotrexate, phenytoin, azathioprine, hydroxycarbamide
Reticulocytosis

Megaloblastic anaemia
• Caused by vitamin B12 and folate deﬁciency
• Bone marrow shows big erythroblasts with immature nuclei due to
defective DNA synthesis while blood ﬁlm may show hypersegmented
neutrophils
• Can also cause suppression of white cell and platelet production
(pancytopenia) and a mild jaundice with raised LDH due to low-grade
haemolysis
• Lack of B12 and/or folate also effects brain (rare cause of reversible
dementia) and nerve function (peripheral neuropathy and subacute
combined degeneration of the cord). There is a poor correlation
between the degree of anaemia and the presence of neurological
sequelae which are often irreversible

Pernicious anaemia
An autoimmune gastritis is present in 80% of B12 deﬁciency cases,
resulting in achlorhydria, the absence of intrinsic factor, and therefore
B12 malabsorption. It is more common in elderly females with a history
of autoimmune disease. Proving the diagnosis (gastric biopsy, Schilling’s
test to look for malabsorption and autoantibodies for intrinsic factor, and
parietal cells) is ﬁddly and rarely undertaken. Treatment is empirical and
pragmatic.

Treatment
• In combined deﬁciency or blind treatment always correct both
deﬁciencies simultaneously as treating one can precipitate acute
deﬁciency of the other and worsen neurology (especially subacute
degeneration)
• Folic acid 5mg od is very well tolerated
• Hydroxocobalamin loading is 1mg by intramuscular injection three
times a week for 6 doses then 1mg every 3 months indeﬁnitely
• Those with low B12 levels without anaemia can go straight to the
3-monthly regimen

457

458

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Anaemia of chronic disease
This is the most common cause of anaemia in older people. Illnesses
such as infection, malignant disease, or connective tissue disorder may be
accompanied by a moderate anaemia (9–10g/dL). Frequent acute illness
may have a similar effect.

Diagnosis
Often a diagnosis of exclusion. Normocytic and normochromic. There is
a low serum iron and iron binding capacity with a normal or raised serum
ferritin concentration. Bone marrow aspiration is rarely indicated but will
usually demonstrate increased iron stores.
This underlying condition may not always be apparent even after a
careful history and examination and screening tests should include:
• Blood ﬁlm, ESR, CRP, and immunoglobulins
• Liver and renal function tests
• CXR
• Autoantibody screen
• Urine analysis
• TFTs
• Prostrate-speciﬁc antigen (PSA)
If no diagnosis is made at this stage symptomatic treatment should be
given and the patient should be kept under regular review.

Treatment
• Haemoglobin will improve only after treatment of the underlying
condition
• Patients should not be placed on long-term iron and/or folate
supplements without evidence of deﬁciency (iron overload can occur
and has theoretical risks)
• Symptomatic blood transfusion may be warranted
• Chronic disease often coexists with renal impairment; consider
a trial of erythropoietin therapy (see b ‘Chronic kidney disease:
complications’, p.394)

Unexplained anaemia
It is common to ﬁnd a mild anaemia (usually <2g below threshold) in
older patients, that is not readily explained by any single process.
It is likely that there are several subtle factors at play, for example:
• Mild kidney impairment
• Low level chronic inﬂammation
• Serial acute events
• Androgen reduction
• Erythropoietin reduction
• In some cases an ‘anaemia of ageing’
Approach by excluding other causes, and listing possible contributing
factors. It is probably not unexplained—just complex.

PARAPROTEINAEMIAS

Paraproteinaemias
Abnormal expansion of a single line of plasma cells, which produce a
monoclonal immunoglobulin. This is a malignant, or potentially malignant
condition that increases in prevalence with advancing age
2A polyclonal hyperglobulinaemia is a common benign reaction to many
illnesses and infection and is not related to the paraproteinaemias.
It is important to exclude paraproteinaemias in any older patient with
an unexplained anaemia or raised ESR. This is easily done with:
• Serum immunoglobulin levels
• Serum and urine electrophoresis including quantiﬁcation of a
monoclonal immunoglobulin
• Bone marrow aspirate/trephine if one is found

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined signiﬁcance
(MGUS)
• This is the most common paraproteinaemia, occurring in 3% of over
70 year olds
• It is benign and has no clinical manifestations
• There is a small/moderate monoclonal band (<20g/L), a low level of
plasma cell expansion in the marrow (<10%), and a raised ESR but no
other clinical or laboratory features of multiple myeloma (MM)
• The paraprotein level should remain stable over time
• ‘Smouldering myeloma’ is sometimes diagnosed where the monoclonal
band or plasma cell levels are higher than the thresholds listed here but
there are no other features of MM—this is treated in the same way as
MGUS
• The importance of MGUS is that up to a quarter of the patients will
eventually develop another haematological disease (usually MM).
The median transformation time is 10 years and many patients die of
unrelated illness during follow-up. There is no test which can predict
which remain stable and which transform so all should receive an
annual clinical and laboratory review (FBC, serum electrophoresis with
quantiﬁcation of paraprotein level, kidney function, and calcium)

459

460

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Multiple myeloma
Incidence in people over 80 is 30 per 100,000 per year. The marrow plasma
cell expansion is malignant and causes bone erosion and marrow failure.
Bence Jones proteins (light chains excreted in urine) may contribute to
kidney failure. Plasma hyperviscosity syndrome can occur.
2Exclude MM in anyone with an unexplained high ESR or anaemia

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Malaise/fatigue (anaemia)
Bone pain, pathological fracture and cord compression (bone erosion)
Thirst, confusion and renal impairment (hypercalcaemia)
Infections/fever (immunoparesis and neutropenia)
Bleeding (thrombocytopenia)
Hepatomegaly (20%) and splenomegaly (5%)
Rarely neuropathy or amyloidosis can occur

Investigation
• Serum immunoglobulins and electrophoresis show a monoclonal band
(sometimes two), usually quantiﬁed as over 30g/L with suppression
‘immunoparesis’ of other immunoglobulins. IgG paraprotein most
common, then IgA and light chains.
• Other blood tests
• High ESR—usually above 100
• Normochromic normocytic anaemia
• Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia occur late
• Hypercalcaemia
• Renal impairment
• ALP—may be normal despite bone lesions and hypercalcaemia
• Hypoalbuminaemia
• High B2-microglobulin levels
• Urine immunoglobulins—light chains occur as Bence Jones protein
in 75%
• Plain X-rays—show lytic lesions or generalized osteopenia
• Isotope bone scans may be negative and are not recommended
• MRI may show non-speciﬁc patchy high signal marrow replacement
• Bone marrow aspirate and trephine l 30% plasma cells
A conﬁdent diagnosis can be made with at least two of:
• >30% plasma cells in marrow
• Evidence of bone involvement
• A myeloma protein present in serum or urine or both
Unfortunately many cases are not this straightforward and cases are found
with a normal ESR, no serum protein band (just Bence Jones) or <30%
plasma cells (where marrow expansion is patchy or occurring in a single
plasmacytoma deposit).

MULTIPLE MYELOMA

Management
Should usually involve a haematologist.
Most patients will receive symptomatic treatment:
• Blood product transfusion
• Analgesia for bone pain
• Radiotherapy for localized bone pain/pathological fracture and for
spinal cord compression
• Treatment of hypercalcaemia—see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage
symptomatic hypercalcaemia’, p.633
• Social and psychological support
Disease-modifying options include:
• In younger (usually under 65), ﬁtter patients a bone marrow transplant
is often recommended after initial chemotherapy
• A regimen containing melphalan, prednisolone and thalidomide (MPT)
chemotherapy is often used as ﬁrst line for those >65
• Treatment is given in cycles (four-day courses of melphalan and
prednisolone every 6 weeks with daily thalidomide)
• Treatment continues in cycles until a plateau phase is reached (monitor
M-protein in blood and urine)
• Higher risk MM, or those who progress on standard chemotherapy
may be given regimens including bortezomib (an iv proteasome
inhibitor) or lenalidomide (an immunomodulating drug given orally
along with dexamethasone)

Prognosis
Median survival even with treatment is 4 years and palliative care should
not be neglected at the end.
Severe anaemia (Hb<9g/dL), kidney impairment, and hypercalcaemia
are all associated with a poor prognosis.

461

462

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Myelodysplasia and myelodysplastic
syndrome
A group of neoplastic disorders of the haemopoietic stem cell characterized by increasing bone marrow failure with qualitative and quantitative
abnormalities of all three cell lines resulting in varying degrees of:
• Anaemia (macrocytic or normocytic)
• Neutropenia (sometimes with a monocytosis)
• Thrombocytopenia
A single cell line may be affected, especially at presentation. The qualitative abnormalities mean that function may be poor even with normal
counts (eg susceptibility to infection without neutropenia).
Common and underdiagnosed with peak incidence age 80. Cause
unknown (except a tiny proportion who have myelodysplasia secondary
to previous cytotoxic therapy).
Usually a hypercellular bone marrow (some normocellular/hypocellular)
with dysplastic changes and up to 20% blast cells. Some patients have ring
sideroblasts (iron deposits in ring shape around nucleus). Transformation
to acute myeloid leukaemia where blasts >20% occurs in a signiﬁcant
proportion (up to 30% eventually)—especially those with a high blast
count at diagnosis.

Diagnosis
Around half of patients are asymptomatic at diagnosis (incidental ﬁnding
on blood test). The rest present with anaemia, infections, or bleeding and
may have splenomegaly (10%), hepatomegaly and skin purpura.
First exclude B12 and folate deﬁciency, alcohol excess, cytotoxics
and thyroid/liver/kidney failure. If characteristic features on blood ﬁlm
and mild disease, bone marrow examination may be unnecessary but
conﬁdent diagnosis/staging will usually require trephine and aspirate.
Subclassiﬁcation based on bone marrow morphology and karyotyping can
be done by haematologists and aids prognostic precision.

Management
• Asymptomatic patients require nothing more than monitoring with
regular blood counts—often stable for many years
• Mainstay of symptomatic treatment is blood transfusions
• Recurrent infections and bleeding complications should be treated with
antibiotics and platelet transfusions respectively
• Younger patients (age <70) with poor-risk disease are sometimes
suitable for bone marrow transplantation or cytotoxic treatment but
these have a very high morbidity and mortality in older patients
• Growth factors such as erythropoietin or granulocyte colony
stimulating factor are occasionally used
• Average survival ranges from 6 months (high risk) to 4 years (low risk)
and around one-third die of unrelated causes
• Transformation to acute myeloid leukaemia has a very poor
prognosis—palliative treatment only

MYELODYSPLASIA AND MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROME

HOW TO . . . Transfuse an older person
Acute transfusions
For example: haematemesis, postoperative blood loss
• Speed of transfusion should be determined by the haemodynamic
status (postural BP useful, remember elderly patients—especially
those on B-blockers and with pacemakers—may not be able to
mount an appropriate tachycardia)
• Furosemide not required in a volume-depleted patient
• Reassess ﬂuid balance and repeat Hb frequently—it is very easy to
under or overestimate blood requirements and older patients do not
tolerate this as well
When not to transfuse
• Older people admitted acutely may have an alarmingly low
haemoglobin (often an unexpected ﬁnding on a screening blood
test) but this should not automatically trigger urgent, fast, or large
transfusion
• Most of these patients have a newly diagnosed chronic anaemia and
can come to harm if transfused overenthusiastically—indeed many of
these patients are better managed as an outpatient
• First assess patient’s haemodynamic status and symptoms (fainting,
very breathless, new confusion, unstable angina or severe peripheral
ischaemia are indications to transfuse; simple tiredness/malaise is not)
• B12 injections or oral iron therapy can cause haemoglobin to rise
by 0.5–1g/dL per week and may avoid inpatient care and the risks of
transfusion
• If you do elect to transfuse, two units may be sufﬁcient (even for an
Hb of 6) to tide the patient over until other treatments work
Routine/planned symptomatic transfusions
eg myelodysplasia
• In general transfuse only when haemoglobin drops to below 8 (unless
symptoms, eg angina, occur at higher levels)
• Outpatient transfusion is now frequently done in DHs, with the
patient sitting in a chair rather than bed-bound
• Some units now give up to 4 units/day (2hr) unless patient has heart
failure or previous reactions
• Usually with oral furosemide cover (20–40mg/bag of blood)
• A careful system for cross-matching in primary care (eg some units
send out a pack containing pre-labelled bottles, request cards, and
patient bands to district nurses to collect at home or in GP surgery)
can minimize traumatic journeys to hospital

CHAPTER 16

Haematology

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is the most common of the lymphoid
leukaemias. Malignant proliferation of mature B-lymphocytes causes persistent lymphocytosis. Peak incidence age 60–80. Female:male 1:2.

Clinical features
Often picked up incidentally on blood ﬁlm when asymptomatic
Symmetrical non-tender lymphadenopathy (also tonsillar enlargement)
Splenomegaly and/or hepatomegaly (in later stages)
Increased susceptibility to infections (eg thrush, herpes zoster,
bacterial) due to low immunoglobulins and/or neutropenia
• Bruising/purpura due to thrombocytopenia

•
•
•
•

Investigations
Abnormal ﬁndings include:
• Lymphocytosis (>5×109/L)—may be >100×109/L
• Normocytic, normochromic anaemia and thrombocytopenia can occur
• Marrow trephine/aspiration replaced by lymphocytes (20–95% of cells)
• Reduced immunoglobulins develop with advanced disease
• LDH raised in some (indicating poor prognosis)
Staging systems use blood and marrow counts and degree of lymphadenopathy and organ involvement to predict survival and therefore guide
management.

Treatment
• Asymptomatic patients with non-progressive early stage disease are
just observed/reviewed in haematology clinics
• In later stages and progressive disease aim for symptom control (not
correction of the lymphocytosis) with:
• Short courses of oral chemotherapy using chlorambucil
or ﬂudarabine-based regimens (eg with rituximab and
cyclophosphamide)
• Prednisolone—can help with anaemia, neutropenia or
thrombocytopenia and reduces hepatosplenomegaly
• Radiotherapy—useful for bulky lymph nodes
Most patients respond to treatment initially but relapse after time.

Prognosis
• Varies according to stage and prognostic factors but in most patients is
a chronic, non-aggressive disease
• Many elderly patients are likely to die with, rather than of, the disease
(as in myeloﬁbrosis and prostate cancer)
However, patients with aggressive disease have a life expectancy of
2–3 years.

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder in older patients
causing massive burden of morbidity and dependency. It is not inevitable
with ageing.
A disorder of the dynamic repair process of synovial joints causing:
• Loss of articular cartilage (joint space narrowing)
• Vascular congestion
• New growth of cartilage and bone (osteophytes)
• Capsular ﬁbrosis
Inherited factors determine susceptibility but individual genes not identiﬁed. Increasing age is the strongest risk factor. Females and those with high
bone density are at higher risk. Obesity, trauma, and repetitive adverse
loading (eg miners or footballers) are potentially avoidable factors. Burnt
out rheumatoid arthritis or neuropathic joints (eg in diabetes) as well as
congenital factors (eg hip dysplasia) can result in secondary OA.

Clinical features
• Pain—assess severity, disability and impact on life (handicap). Usually
insidious in onset and variable over time, worse with activity and
relieved by rest. Chronic pain may cause poor sleep and low mood
• Only one or a few joints are affected with minimal morning stiffness
and often worsening of symptoms during the day
• Restricted movement—eg walking, dressing, rising from a chair
• Severe OA can contribute to postural instability and falls

Examination
• Heberden’s nodes (asymptomatic bony swellings on distal ﬁngers)
associated with inherited knee OA
• Limp with jerky ‘antalgic’ gait
• Deformity including:
• Muscle wasting
• Knees may have valgus (knees apart, feet together), varus (knees
together, foot outwards) or ﬂexion deformity
• Hip shortening/ﬂexion (check on couch by ﬂexing opposite hip to
see if affected hip lifts off bed—Thomas’ test)
• Restricted range of movement
• Crepitus
• Effusions

Investigations
2OA is a clinical diagnosis. Symptoms correlate poorly with radiological ﬁndings. The main role of X-ray is in assessing severity of structural
change prior to surgery. Features include joint space narrowing, osteophytes, sclerosis, cysts, and deformity. Blood tests are normal even when
an osteoarthritic joint feels warm—reconsider your diagnosis if inﬂammatory markers are elevated.

OSTEOARTHRITIS: MANAGEMENT

Osteoarthritis: management
OA is the most common, chronic painful condition. Drug dependence and
side effects are a big problem.
2Always consider non-pharmacological treatments ﬁrst.

Non-drug treatments
• Exercise: stretching and strengthening. Swimming, yoga, and Tai Chi
are particularly good. Encourage the patient to exercise despite the
pain—no harm will be done
• Heat packs: but be very careful to avoid burns in patients who may
have decreased temperature awareness
• Weight loss: not a quick ﬁx but inﬂuences other health outcomes
• Sensible footwear: soft soles with no heels. Trainers are ideal
• Walking aids: eg stick (in contralateral hand)
• Education and support: can improve pain and function
• Osteopaths or chiropractors help some patients but are expensive

Drug treatments
3No patient should be offered more dangerous medication unless
they have tried and failed regular paracetamol in maximum dose (1g qds).
Patients may need persuading to try a regular prophylactic dose, perceiving
it as a ‘weak’ drug.
• The next step is to add a low potency opiate—often combined with
paracetamol, eg co-codamol (start with codeine 8mg/paracetamol
500mg ii qds). Beware constipation and sedation
• A short course of oral NSAIDs can be useful in acute exacerbations
but try to avoid long-term use. If NSAIDs are used for more than
2 weeks or in the presence of known dyspepsia or ulceration, reduce
the gastrointestinal risk by co-prescribing, eg lansoprazole 15mg od.
The COX-2 selective inhibitors have better gastrointestinal tolerability
but have fallen from favour due to vascular adverse events
• Intra-articular steroids (eg triamcinolone hexacetonide 20mg) can be
rapidly effective particularly if the joint is hot/very painful. There is a
substantial placebo effect, but symptoms tend to recur after 4–6 weeks.
Side effects limit use to four injections/joint/year. The cumulative
systemic effect risks osteoporosis
• Topical NSAIDs can be helpful and are lower risk than oral
• Counter-irritants, eg capsaicin cream are safe and have some effect
• Oral chondroitin and glucosamine are available unlicensed over-thecounter and are very widely used. They may have a slow-onset mild
analgesic action and may slow the progression of disease

Surgical treatment
Includes arthroscopic joint wash-outs and joint replacements. Indications
include pain, deformity or joint instability where other treatments have
failed. Outcomes can be excellent for ﬁtter older people, but caution in
the frail for whom it is rarely beneﬁcial overall.

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is the reduction in bone mass and disruption of bone architecture, resulting in increased bone fragility and fracture risk. Results from
prolonged imbalance in bone remodelling where resorption (osteoclastic
activity) exceeds deposition (osteoblastic activity).
Osteoporosis is very common and very much under-recognized and
under-treated. In combination with falls (see b ‘Interventions to prevent
falls’, p.106) osteoporosis contributes to the high incidence of fractures in
older people. In the UK 30% of women aged 70 have at least one vertebral
fracture and 32% aged 90 will have had a hip fracture.
2If you make the diagnosis do not delay initiating secondary prevention.
Always think of osteoporosis when assessing postoperative orthopaedic
patients.

Pathology
• Total bone mass increases throughout childhood and adolescence,
peaks in the third decade, and then declines at about 0.5% per year
• Bone loss is accelerated after the menopause (up to 5% per year)
and by smoking, alcohol, low body weight, hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, hypoandrogenism (in men), kidney failure, and
immobility
• Steroids, phenytoin, long-term heparin, and ciclosporin cause
secondary osteoporosis
• High peak bone mass reduces later risk. Determined by genetics,
nutrition (plenty of calcium/vitamin D especially in childhood and the
heavier the better) and weight-bearing exercise
• There are changes in bone structure as well as bone mass. Both
contribute to fragility
• Diagnosis is complicated by the common coexistence of asymptomatic
osteomalacia (defective mineralization) in older people with low
sunlight exposure

Clinical features
• Osteoporosis itself is asymptomatic—it is the fractures that cause
problems
• Often presents with an acute fragility (ie low energy) fracture—wrist,
femoral neck, or crush fracture of vertebral body
• Wedging of vertebrae is caused because there is higher load-bearing by
the anterior part of the vertebral body. This can present as:
• An incidental, asymptomatic ﬁnding (in around a third)
• Acute painful fracture
• A progressive kyphosis (‘Dowager’s hump’). The bent-over posture
is not just unattractive, it causes loss of height, protuberant belly,
abdominal compression, oesophageal reﬂux, and impaired balance
with further predisposition to falls and fracture. Restricted rib
movements lead to restrictive lung disease

OSTEOPOROSIS

Diagnosis
2Blood tests are normal (except after a fracture). If calcium or ALP is
elevated consider alternative diagnosis, eg metastases or Paget’s disease.
• X-rays may show fractures and give an idea of bone density
• The gold standard is dual X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scanning
(rarely employed in the elderly population but useful in younger
women). Usually two scores are quoted at hip and spine. The T-score
compares bone density to peak bone mass while Z score compares it
to age/sex/weight-matched sample. A T-score less than –2.5 indicates
osteoporosis, with scores –1 to –2.5 indicating osteopenia
• Peripheral densitometry assessments can be done at the heel and
ankle, the advantage being that the required machine is more portable.
Results correlate with formal testing, but there are concerns about
reliability
• Think of secondary causes:
• TSH in all
• Testosterone levels in men
In a woman aged >65 years, a pragmatic approach is to assume that osteoporosis exists where there is a:
• Low energy fracture of wrist, femoral neck, or vertebra
• Progressive kyphosis without features of malignancy

Primary prevention of osteoporosis
• Sensible public health measures (eg diet, exercise, stop smoking,
reduce alcohol) should be advised but generally affect peak bone
mass, ie too late for older people
• Prophylaxis with a bisphosphonate should be started for those taking
signiﬁcant steroid therapy (>7.5mg/day for more than a month)
(see b ‘Osteoporosis: management’, p.470)
• HRT is not particularly effective—postmenopausal bone loss returns
after it is stopped. Increased thromboembolic, cancer, and vascular
risk argue strongly against its use

469

470

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Osteoporosis: management
• Oral calcium and vitamin D is cheap and effective, especially in frail
institutionalized people (possibly due to treatment of osteomalacia and
associated myopathy as much as osteoporosis). Tablets are large and
chalky—can be unpalatable. Effervescent tablets or granules may be
better tolerated. Take two combination tablets daily (eg CalciChew®
D3 Forte or Adcal® D3). Probably not helpful as monotherapy in ﬁt
older people
• Bisphosphonates are very effective, and used as ﬁrst line. NICE
recommends in any woman aged >75 following a fragility fracture
(without the need for DEXA scanning)
• The weekly dose regimens (risedronate 35mg, alendronate 70mg
once weekly) are easier to remember and to tolerate than daily
dosing, but patients should still take daily calcium and vitamin D.
• Etidronate is also NICE recommended and comes in a preparation
that includes calcium (Didronel PMO®) but must be taken daily
• Upper gut ulceration occurs rarely. Use bisphosphonates cautiously
when there is dysphagia or a history of dyspepsia. Must be taken
on an empty stomach 30min before breakfast or other medicines.
Swallow the tablet whole with a full glass of water whilst sitting or
standing. Remain sitting or standing for 30min after swallowing
• Up to 15% of patients are ‘non-responders’ and continue to lose
bone mass (measured by chemical bone turnover markers). This is
unlikely to be detected in geriatric medicine because bone turnover
is not monitored; consider change in treatment if fragility fractures
continue
• Contraindicated in hypocalcaemia. Manufacturers advise avoiding in
renal impairment, but it is often given if the indication is strong
• Longer-acting iv preparations (eg zoledronic acid) are also available
but cost/beneﬁt ratio is still under evaluation
• Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a rare, but serious side effect (increased
risk with cancer, steroid treatment, and poor dental hygiene). Stop
the drug and refer to a maxillofacial surgeon
• Strontium ranelate is recommended by NICE as second line if
bisphosphonates are not tolerated. Side effects include diarrhoea,
vomiting, and thromboembolism
• Teriparatide can also be used if bisphosphonates and strontium are not
tolerated or ineffective. Recombinant fraction of parathyroid hormone,
given by s/c injection. Expensive. Maximum course 18 months
• Less common drugs, usually advised only by specialist teams include:
raloxifene (an oestrogen-like drug which decreases bone loss without
measurable effects on the uterus, used if bisphosphonates are not
tolerated or in non-responders) and calcitonin (available in nasal spray
and improves pain after acute vertebral fracture)
• Vertebroplasty can be considered for severe pain after spinal wedge
fracture where conservative measures are not effective

OSTEOPOROSIS: MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Manage non-operative fractures
• Fractures that very rarely require operative intervention include
pelvis, humerus, wrist, and vertebra
• Other fractures, often immobilized surgically in younger people,
may be treated more conservatively in older patients to avoid
perioperative risks (eg fractured tibial plateaux may simply be
immobilized by plaster of Paris (POP) or splinting)
• Patients with these ‘non-operative’ fractures are often cared for by
geriatricians having been transferred either:
• From A&E, to medical, ortho-medical or ortho-geriatric units
• From orthopaedic wards for ongoing rehabilitation
• Minor fractures can result in signiﬁcant functional impairment,
eg a Colles’ fracture and POP may prevent an older person washing,
dressing, and toileting. Even walking may not be possible (if a frame
can no longer be used)
General principles of management
These include:
• Control of pain. This allows earlier mobilization and reduces the
risks of immobility (pressure sores, pneumonia, thromboembolism)
• Consider novel treatments such as heat, TENS, calcitonin,
bisphosphonates, or vertebroplasty for vertebral fracture
• A short course of NSAIDs is sometimes appropriate in low-risk
patients, but remember to reduce analgesia as soon as possible
• Encouraging mobility and independence as early as possible.
Best achieved in a rehabilitation unit. Patient and family often expect
‘bed rest’ after a fracture and may need to be educated
• Consider the mechanism of the fall and injury (see b ‘Assessment
following a fall’, p.104)—are there medical risks that could be
reduced? Eg, sedating medication, excessive antihypertensive use,
undiagnosed illnesses (eg urinary infection or uncontrolled AF), need
for aids/adaptations
• Maintaining contact with orthopaedic colleagues. They can
advise on when to replace/remove plasters and how much exercise/
weight bearing is appropriate. Ask for reassessment if progress is
poor, eg ongoing severe pain, or apparent malunion—sometimes a
diagnosis has been missed or an interval operation is needed
• A pragmatic approach to weight-bearing may be needed, eg in
dementia (where concordance with non-weight bearing is difﬁcult),
or where immobility causes an unacceptable rise in frailty
• Consider prophylactic heparin if there are multiple risk factors for
thromboembolic disease or the patient is immobile
• Consider osteoporosis treatment (there is no evidence that
bisphosphonates reduce callus formation or delay bone union)
• Start to plan discharge early. Many patients can be managed at
home with a care package and outpatient rehabilitation. Others may
need transitional care beds (eg while they wait to be weight-bearing
or for plasters to be removed) after which they can return to an
active rehabilitation programme prior to going home

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Polymyalgia rheumatica
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is a common inﬂammatory syndrome
causing symmetrical proximal muscle aches and stiffness. It affects only
older people (do not diagnose it under age 50). There is rapid (days) onset
of shoulder and then thigh pain that is worse in mornings. Sometimes
associated malaise, weight loss, depression, and fever. Often quite disabling
with little to ﬁnd on examination.

Pathology
Pathogenetically similar to giant cell arteritis (temporal arteritis); the two
conditions commonly coexist, and may represent a spectrum of disease.
Pain in PMR is thought to be due to synovitis and bursitis.

Diagnosis
2A difﬁcult diagnosis to make reliably—a signiﬁcant number of patients
are misdiagnosed. The following should be present for a ﬁrm diagnosis:
1. Age >50
2. Bilateral aching and morning stiffness (lasting 30min or more) persisting
for at least 1 month. The stiffness should involve at least two of the
following three areas: neck or torso, shoulders or proximal regions of
the arms, and hips or proximal aspects of the thighs
3. ESR >40
The following should also be considered:
• Suggestive symptoms with raised inﬂammatory markers (ESR/CRP) and
no other apparent cause may warrant treatment trial
• Often have anaemia (usually normochromic normocytic) and mild
abnormalities of liver (especially ALP) or renal function
• Clinical examination often normal—despite the name, muscle
tenderness is absent and pain arises because of bursitis/synovitis. Rarely
there may be palpable synovitis in peripheral joints (eg knee, wrist)
• Muscle enzymes, and EMG are normal
• Temporal artery biopsy is positive in less than 25% and is rarely done.
• Exclude other causes (eg connective tissue disease, tumour, chronic
infection, neurological diseases) particularly if a patient does not
respond quickly to steroids

Treatment
• Prednisolone (doses more than 15mg are rarely required) usually
produces a complete resolution of symptoms in a day or two
• Treat until symptom-free and ESR/CRP normalize then reduce dose
quickly initially (eg 2.5mg/week), then more slowly below 10mg (1mg/
month) checking for relapse of symptoms or blood tests
• If symptoms recur with an associated rise in ESR/CRP then put the
steroid dose up until both settle, then restart tailing more slowly
• Some patients can be taken off steroids after 6–8 months but most
need long-term steroids (mean duration 2–3 years)
• Always give bone protection (eg alendronate 70mg once weekly with
calcium and vitamin D). If a treatment trial, wait until diagnosis clear
• Azathioprine or methotrexate may be used as steroid-sparing agents
• Educate and involve the patient in monitoring disease

POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA

Diagnostic dilemma and steroid ‘dependency’
Some older patients who were diagnosed with PMR years ago no
longer exhibit or remember their symptoms, and will be having steroid
side effects. They may resist steroid withdrawal or experience symptoms as steroids are decreased or withdrawn, even if the characteristic
syndrome and inﬂammatory responses are not displayed.
Many other diseases (even simple osteoarthritis) respond to steroids
(although usually less dramatically). Steroid withdrawal itself can cause
general aches, which some have called ‘pseudo-rheumatism’.
Avoid this difﬁcult situation by:
• Comprehensive assessment at onset with good record-keeping, so
that others can reappraise the diagnosis if response to treatment is
poor
• Ensuring that where the diagnosis is not clear, a treatment trial is
reviewed early for impact—if the response is not convincing, then
stop the steroids. 2Beware continuing steroids because the patient
feels ‘a bit better’
• Considering the differential diagnosis carefully
• Discussing diagnosis and treatment with the patient
• Agreeing with the patient a clear plan for reviewing steroid therapy
• Explaining that steroid withdrawal can cause muscle aches, but the
blood tests help us distinguish between this and disease reactivation

473

474

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Giant cell arteritis
Giant cell arteritis (GCA) or temporal arteritis (TA) is a relatively common
(18 per 100,000 over age 50) systemic vasculitis of medium to large vessels.
Mean age of presentation 70 (does not occur age <50). More common in
women and Scandinavia/northern Europe.

Pathogenesis
• Chronic vasculitis, mainly involving cranial branches arising from the
aortic arch. Similar pathology seen in PMR, but different distribution
• Possibly an autoimmune mechanism but no antibodies/antigen isolated

Clinical picture
• Systemic: fever, malaise, anorexia, and weight loss
• Muscles: symmetrical proximal muscle pain and stiffness as in PMR
• Arteritis: tenderness over temporal arteries—not so much a headache
as scalp tenderness. Classically unable to wear a hat or brush hair. If an
artery occludes, distal ischaemia or infarction occurs
• Headache is present in 90% (due to ischaemia or local tenderness of
facial or scalp arteries)
• Jaw claudication (occlusion of maxillary artery)
• Amaurosis fugax or blindness are due to occlusion of the ciliary
artery, which supplies the optic nerve—this causes a pale swollen
optic nerve but not retinal damage (which is a feature of central
retinal artery occlusion with carotid disease)
• Stroke (carotid artery)
• Any large artery including the aorta can be affected.
2Always suspect GCA if amaurosis fugax involves both eyes (atheroma is
more commonly unilateral).

Investigations
•
•
•
•

ESR usually >100
CRP also very high and falls faster with treatment than ESR
May have normochromic normocytic anaemia and renal impairment.
Temporal artery biopsy (TAB) is highly speciﬁc, and therefore the gold
standard test. Because the vasculitis may be patchy, TAB is not always
positive, ie the sensitivity is moderate. TAB becomes negative quickly
(1–2 weeks) with treatment

GIANT CELL ARTERITIS

Treatment
• Amaurosis fugax due to GCA is an ophthalmological emergency. Give
80–100mg oral prednisolone or high-dose methylprednisolone iv
• Never delay treatment while waiting for a biopsy
• Even without visual symptoms, higher doses and slower dose reduction
are required than for PMR (start at 30–40mg)
• Between a third and a half of patients are able to come off steroids by
2 years
• After stopping steroids, continue to monitor as relapse is common
• Osteoporosis prophylaxis should be started at initiation of steroids
(usually a bisphosphonate with calcium and vitamin D)
• Azathioprine and methotrexate are sometimes used as steroid-sparing
agents once therapy is established. Consider them if:
• Steroid side effects are prominent
• High steroid doses are required
• There is slow tailing off
• There is recurrent relapse off treatment

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

HOW TO . . . Manage steroid therapy in giant cell
arteritis
A suggested protocol for steroid treatment in temporal arteritis is
shown in Fig. 17.1.
Diagnosis

Prednisolone 80mg od with
Biphosphonate
Calcium and vitamin D
Monitor for glycosuria/BMs in known diabetic patients

Initial review (2 weeks)

Clinical improvement—usually rapid—if not reassess diagnosis
Repeat inflammatory markers—ESR/CRP

If ESR/CRP still elevated
continue at 80mg and recheck
in 2 weeks

If still no improvement
reconsider diagnosis

If ESR/CRP normal/near normal
decrease to 70mg and review 2 weeks
continue to reduce by 10mg/fortnight
while markers remain satisfactory

When reach 20mg then slow reduction by
2.5mg/fortnight

When reach 10mg then slow reduction by
1mg/fortnight
Fig. 17.1 A protocol for steroid treatment in temporal arteritis.

• If rebound of symptoms or inﬂammatory markers occurs, then take
2 steps back on the reduction schedule. Wait 4 weeks before
reducing again
• Beware a steroid-withdrawal syndrome, which can occur without
arteritis recurrence. ESR and CRP are normal (see b ‘Diagnostic
dilemma and steroid “dependancy” ’, p.473)
• Other blood parameters (anaemia, impaired liver function) may help
guide treatment

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Muscle symptoms
Muscular symptoms are common in older people, and can arise from a
range of conditions.
It should be possible to distinguish between the following:
• True muscle weakness due to:
• UMN lesions (eg midline brain lesions such as tumours, subdural
bleeds, degenerative brain disease, or cord pathology such as discs
or vertebral collapse)
• Anterior horn cell lesions (eg MND, polio)
• Motor nerve root problems (spinal stenosis, malignant inﬁltration)
• Peripheral motor nerve problems (inﬂammatory polyneuritis,
thyroid disease, toxins)
• Neuromuscular transmission problems (myasthenia gravis,
malignancy related impairments, drug induced problems)
• Muscle abnormalities (dermatomyositis, inclusion body myositis,
drug damage—especially steroids or statins, thyroid disease, vitamin
D deﬁciency, electrolyte or pH imbalances)
• Joint disease with local pain and stiffness, reducing use with resulting
weakness (eg osteoarthritis)
• Asthenia—feeling of weakness, low energy and apathy as a result of
systemic disease (eg cancer, heart disease, and chronic lung disease),
conﬁnement to bed or psychological factors (anxiety, depression).
Commonly present as feeling too tired/weak to participate in therapy

History and examination
• Take a full history including drugs and comorbidities
• Ask about muscle pain (rarely a feature of true myopathy—consider
overexertion or ﬁbromyalgia) and cramps
• Look for muscle wasting and abnormal movement (localized wasting
indicates a problem with the relevant motor nerve or muscle body,
fasciculation may indicate MND)
• Is the weakness generalized (usually due to cachexia or myasthenia
gravis) or limited to speciﬁc tasks (more common with localized
muscle weakness)
• Grade muscle strength with standardized score (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Grade muscle strength’, p.479) for later comparisons
• A lack of demonstrable muscle weakness, despite symptoms usually
indicates asthenia
• Check for fatigability (may indicate myasthenia gravis)
• Ask about CNS disease and examine neurologically (brisk reﬂexes
with upgoing plantars point to the CNS, whereas absent reﬂexes may
indicate peripheral nerve disease)
• Check the joints for degenerative disease; ask about pain and stiffness
• Look for evidence of systemic disease (eg thyroid, malignancy)
• Assess mood

MUSCLE SYMPTOMS

Investigations
• Screening bloods should include: K, Ca, Mg, urea, creatinine, LFTs, TFTs,
autoantibody screen, FBC, ESR, CRP, serum electrophoresis
and haematinincs. CK is elevated after intense exercise or an
intramuscular injection or with pathology of the muscle unit
• Plain X-rays can reveal joint disease
• Ultrasound can be used to assess joints and muscle
• CT or MRI scans can demonstrate CNS pathology, cord problems, and
degree of muscle atrophy
• Electrodiagnostic testing (nerve conduction studies and
electromyography) is useful to demonstrate nerve pathology, problems
with neuromuscular transmission and intrinsic muscle disease. It
can conﬁrm the diagnosis in a number of conditions (eg chronic
inﬂammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy)
• Muscle biopsy can sometimes be useful

HOW TO . . . Grade muscle strength
The widely used Medical Research Council grading system allows
sequential assessments to be compared. It involves assessing muscle
activity in isolation, against gravity and against resistance, and is scored
as follows (Table 17.1).
Table 17.1 Medical Research Council grading system
0

No muscle contraction

1

Flicker or trace of muscle contraction

2

Limb or joint movement possible only with gravity eliminated

3

Limb or joint movement against gravity, but not resistance

4

Power decreased but limb or joint movement possible against resistance

5

Normal power against resistance

Scores can be augmented if the category is not quite reached (–) or slightly exceeded (+) eg
minor reduction in power against resistance may be described as 5–.

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Paget’s disease
This is a very common bone disease of old age (up to 10% prevalence,
more common in men). It is usually clinically silent—only about 5% are
symptomatic.
It is thought to be due to a slow viral infection of osteoclasts, which
causes abnormal bone remodelling. Most commonly affects pelvis, femur,
spine, skull, and tibia. The resultant bone is expanded and disordered and
can cause pain, pathological fracture, and predisposes to osteosarcoma.

Presentation
• Most commonly as asymptomatic elevated ALP
• Often an incidental ﬁnding on a pelvis or skull X-ray
• Less commonly as:
• Pathological fracture (especially hip and pelvis)
• Bone pain: constant pain commonly in legs, especially at night.
The diseased bone itself can be painful or deformity can lead to
accelerated joint disease at eg hip, knee or spine. Fracture or
osteosarcoma can cause suddenly increased pain
• Deformity: bowing of legs or upper arm is often asymmetrical. The
skull can take on a characteristic ‘bossed’ shape due to overgrowth
of frontal bones
• Deafness: bone expansion in the skull compresses the eighth cranial
nerve causing conduction deafness, which can be severe
• Other neurological compression syndromes, eg spinal cord
(paraplegia), optic nerve (blindness), brainstem compression
(dysphagia and hydrocephalus)

Investigations
• ALP is constantly elevated
• The bone isoenzyme is more speciﬁc and useful when liver function
is abnormal
• Rarely (eg if only one bone is involved), total ALP can be normal but
the bone isoenzyme is always raised
• Other markers of bone turnover, eg urinary hydroxyproline are raised
• X-rays show mixed lysis and sclerosis, disordered bone texture, and
expansion (a diagnostic feature)
• Radioisotope bone scans show hot spots
• Immobile patients with very active disease can become hypercalcaemic
although this is rare. If calcium and ALP are raised, there is more likely
to be another diagnosis (eg carcinomatosis, hyperparathyroidism)

PAGET’S DISEASE

Management
As most cases are asymptomatic, often no treatment is required. Symptomatic
cases may warrant referral to a rheumatologist
• Analgesia and joint replacement may be needed
• Fractures often require internal ﬁxation to correct deformity and
because they heal poorly
• Bisphosphonates (usually by iv infusion) are very useful. They have
several effects:
• Reduce pain
• Reduce vascularity before elective surgery
• Improve healing after fracture
• Improve neurological compression syndromes
• Reduce serum calcium in hypercalcaemia
• Calcitonin is now rarely used
• ALP, other bone turnover biochemical markers, and occasionally
nuclear bone scans can be used to monitor the effectiveness of
treatment

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Gout
Uric acid crystals deposit in and around joints and intermittently
produce inﬂammation. Serum urate levels equate poorly with the disease
manifestations.
Increased incidence with age due to:
• Worsening renal function and impaired uric acid excretion
• Increased hyperuricaemic drug use, eg thiazides, aspirin, cytotoxics
• Common acute precipitants, eg sepsis, surgery

Presentation
• Acute monoarthritis in feet or hands is most common, but can also
occur in large joints such as knee or shoulder. The joint is very painful,
hot and red. Patients often refuse to bear weight or move the joint.
The patient can look unwell and sometimes has a fever
• Chronic tophi (usually painless) over ﬁnger joints and in ears can occur,
associated with a chronic arthritis. Sometimes mistaken for other more
common arthritides
• Olecranon bursitis
• Uric acid kidney stones

Investigations
• During an acute attack serum uric acid may be normal or high
• WBC, ESR, and CRP are usually high or very high
• Joint ﬂuid:
• May be cloudy or frankly purulent on visual inspection
• Microscopy shows many inﬂammatory cells
• Under polarized light, negatively birefringent uric acid crystals are
seen in joint ﬂuid or in phagocytes
• X-rays are usually normal (rarely see small punched-out erosions in
ﬁngers in chronic tophaceous cases)
The main aim is to exclude an infective arthritis.
2If in doubt, consider using iv antibiotics until cultures are negative.

Treatment
• For acute gout:
• Use paracetamol with a course of NSAIDs (consider gastric protection)
• If you have ruled out infection, local steroid injections are often
effective (eg methylprednisolone 40mg intra-articular)
• If NSAIDs are contraindicated (eg renal impairment) use a short
course of oral steroids (eg prednisolone 40mg od for 7 days) or
colchicine 0.5mg stat then 0.5mg every 6–8hr until pain is controlled
or diarrhoea/vomiting side effects prohibit further use. Colchicine
is an effective drug but difﬁcult to use correctly—you will need to
explain this protocol carefully to patient/carers
• For chronic arthritis with or without tophi: treat with allopurinol or
uricosuric drugs (probenecid and sulﬁnpyrazone). Uricosuric drugs are
contraindicated in renal stones

GOUT

Prevention
One or two attacks of gout probably do not warrant prophylaxis (especially as such drugs can precipitate further attacks). Instead, try:
• Changing drugs (stop thiazides and aspirin)
• Lifestyle advice:
• Reduce alcohol (beer is preferable to lager or wine)
• Reduce dietary purines (meat)
• Lose weight
• Do not leave patients on long-term NSAIDs. Very early use of NSAIDs
or colchicine can abort a severe attack of gout
Several attacks of gout merit slow introduction of allopurinol or uricosuric agents. This may cause a ﬂare of acute gout—cover the introduction
of therapy with NSAIDs or low-dose colchicine.

483

484

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Pseudogout
Features
This is an acute, episodic synovitis closely resembling gout except that:
• Calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid crystals (with positive
rather than negative birefringence) are found
• Large joints are more commonly affected (especially knees but also
shoulder, hips, wrists and elbows)
• It is not associated with tophi, bursitis, or stones
• X-rays often show calciﬁcation of articular cartilage ‘chondrocalcinosis’
in the affected joint
• It doesn’t respond to allopurinol or uricosuric agents—so consider this
diagnosis where recurrent attacks persist despite allopurinol
As with gout the patient has an acutely inﬂamed joint which is very painful
to move. They may be systemically unwell with a fever and highly elevated
inﬂammatory markers. Serum calcium is normal.
2Consider this diagnosis in the post-acute patient with a hot swollen
wrist.

Management
Make a conﬁdent diagnosis. This usually involves immediate synovial ﬂuid
sampling and urgent microscopy to exclude infection and gout.
Effective treatments for acute pseudogout include:
• Intra-articular steroid injections
• Oral NSAIDs
• Oral corticosteroids
• Colchicine
Long-term preventative treatment is very rarely needed.

CONTRACTURES

Contractures
Contractures are joint deformities caused by damaged connective tissue.
Where a joint is immobilized (through depressed conscious level, loss of
neural input, or local tissue damage) the muscle, ligaments, tendons, and
skin can become inelastic and shortened causing joints to be ﬂexed.
Common causes worldwide include polio, cerebral palsy, and leprosy;
in geriatric medicine common causes include stroke, dementia, and
musculoskeletal conditions, eg fracture. Contractures are an underrecognized cause of disability—they occur to some degree in about a third
of nursing home residents and it is still not uncommon to ﬁnd patients
who are bedbound and permanently curled into the fetal position.

Problems
• Pain: especially on moving joint but can occur at rest
• Hygiene: skin surfaces may oppose (eg the hand after stroke or groins
in abduction/ﬂexion contractures) making it difﬁcult for carers and
painful for the patient to keep clean and odourless
• Pressure areas: abnormal posture increases risk
• Aesthetics: although the lack of movement causes most disability the
abnormal posture/appearance can be more noticeable
• Function: chronic bedbound patients may become so ﬂexed that they
are unable to sit out in a chair

Prevention
• Where immobilization is short term, eg after a fracture, passive
stretching followed by exercise regimens should be initiated promptly
• All healthcare staff should understand the importance of maintaining
mobility (including sitting out of bed for short periods) and positioning
of immobile patients
• Preventative measures are rarely successful at preventing contractures
in joints with long-term immobility, eg in residual hemiparesis after
stroke. Splinting might help mould the position

Treatment
• Periodic injection of botulinum toxin may be helpful where muscle
spasticity is the major problem. There are no real adverse effects but
some patients develop an antibody response after repeated treatment,
which renders therapy less effective. Newer preparations are less
immunogenic
• There is little point using muscle relaxants except to help with pain.
Even then drugs such as baclofen, dantrolene, tizanidine, and diazepam
usually cause side effects of drowsiness before they reach therapeutic
levels. Occasionally assist with physiotherapy stretches
• Surgery eg tendon division has a place in severe cases
• Physiotherapy can to some extent reverse established changes,
especially if not severe and of relatively recent onset
• Repositioning with serial plaster casts takes a long time and is really only
used in younger patients

485

486

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Cervical spondylosis and myelopathy
Degeneration in the cervical spine causes neurological dysfunction with
both radiculopathy (compression of nerve roots leaving spinal foramina)
and myelopathy (cord compression). The resulting mixture of lower
(nerve root) and upper (cord) nerve damage causes pain, weakness and
numbness. Progress is usually gradual but can be sudden (especially following trauma). The disease is unusual before the age of 50. Mild forms
are very common in the elderly population.

History
• Neck pain and restricted movement may be present but are neither
speciﬁc nor sensitive markers of nerve damage. Pain may radiate to
shoulder, chest or arm in a dermatomal distribution (see b Appendix,
‘Dermatomes’, p.686)
• Arms and hands become clumsy especially for ﬁne movements (eg
doing up buttons). Weakness, numbness and paraesthesia can occur
• Leg symptoms usually occur later, with a UMN spastic weakness and a
wide-based and/or ataxic gait, often with falls
• Urinary dysfunction is unusual and late
• Rarely can cause vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency symptoms

Signs
• Arms have predominantly lower motor signs with weakness, muscle
wasting, and segmental reﬂex loss. The classical ‘inverted supinator’
sign is due to a C5/6 lesion where the supinator jerk is lost but the
ﬁnger jerk (C7) is augmented: when the wrist is tapped, the ﬁngers ﬂex
• Legs may have brisk reﬂexes, increased tone, clonus, and upgoing
plantars. In severe cases a spastic paraparesis with a sensory level can
develop

Differential diagnosis
This is wide and includes:
• Syringomyelia
• Motor neuron disease (look for signs above the neck and an absence of
sensory symptoms/signs)
• Peripheral neuropathy (no UMN signs)
• Vitamin B12 deﬁciency
• Other causes of spastic gait disorders

Investigations
• Plain X-rays in older people almost always show degenerative changes,
which correlate poorly with symptoms. They are only useful in
excluding other pathology or in demonstrating spinal instability
• MRI scanning is the investigation of choice. Bone and soft tissue
structures and the extent of cord compression are all well
demonstrated
• CT scanning may also be useful in diagnosis and planning treatment
• Nerve conduction studies can help conﬁrm the clinical impression and
exclude other pathology

CERVICAL SPONDYLOSIS AND MYELOPATHY

Management
Cervical collars do not inﬂuence progression but can sometimes help with
radicular pain and may provide partial protection from acute decline
following trauma. The only deﬁnitive treatment is surgical: laminectomy
with fusion for stabilization.
Surgery is indicated for:
• Progressive neurology (especially if rapidly progressive—consider
steroids while surgery is arranged)
• Severe pain unresponsive to conservative measures
• Myelopathy more than radiculopathy
Discuss the risks and beneﬁts with the patient—function is rarely restored
once lost but pain improves and further damage is usually avoided.

487

488

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

Osteomyelitis
Infection of the bone that is commonest in the very young and the very
old. It is important in geriatric practice because it complicates conditions
that are common in older patients yet presentation is often non-speciﬁc
and indolent, so the diagnosis may be missed.

Vertebral osteomyelitis
• Most common in older patients
• Usually affects the thoracolumbar spine
• Patients complain of mild back ache and malaise and will often have
local tenderness. When examining a patient with pyrexia of unknown
origin (PUO), always ‘walk’ the examining ﬁngers down the spine,
applying pressure to ﬁnd local bony pain
• Vertebral osteomyelitis (commonly T10–11) may lead to:
• Perivertebral abscess with a risk of cord compression
• Vertebral body collapse with angular kyphosis
• Discitis occurs when the infection involves the intervertebral disc. The
patient is relatively less septic, and X-rays appear normal until disease
is very advanced (at which point end-plate erosion can occur). Occurs
after surgery or disc space injections
• Haematogenous spread is most common, often after urinary tract
infection, catheterization, iv cannula insertion, or other instrumentation
• Commonly due to Staphylococcus aureus (with a rising proportion
of these being MRSA), less commonly Gram-negative bacilli, rarely
tuberculosis

Osteomyelitis of other bones
• Generally more common in children, but arise in older patients in
some circumstances:
• As a complication of orthopaedic surgery
• As a complication of ulceration (venous or pressure ulcers)
2 Always consider osteomyelitis in non-healing ulcers; may be present in
as many as 25%
• In susceptible individuals (eg diabetic patients with vascular disease
and neuropathy are prone to osteomyelitis in small bones of
the feet)
• Organisms include Staph. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis (especially
with prostheses), Gram-negative bacilli, and anaerobes

Clinical features of osteomyelitis
• Pain is usual but may be missed if there is a pre-existing pressure sore,
or the patient has peripheral neuropathy and foot osteomyelitis (eg
diabetics)
• Malaise is common
• Fever may be absent

OSTEOMYELITIS

Investigations
Blood cultures should be taken in all, and are positive in around half
Leucocytosis is variable
ESR and CRP are usually raised (although very non-speciﬁc)
X-ray changes lag behind clinical changes by about 10 days. Initially
normal, or showing soft tissue swelling. Later develop classic changes:
periosteal reaction, sequestra (islands of necrosis), bone abscesses, and
sclerosis of neighbouring bone
• Radioisotope bone scanning will show a ‘hot spot’ with osteomyelitis,
but will not distinguish this from many other conditions (eg fracture,
arthritis, non-infectious inﬂammation, metastases, etc.). MRI is the most
sensitive and speciﬁc test. Changes may be diagnostic, even in early
disease
• Biopsy or ﬁne needle aspiration (FNA) of bone is required to guide
antibiotic therapy—this may be done through the base of an ulcer, or
using radiological guidance (ultrasound is useful here)
• Wound swabs reveal colonizing organisms, and are often misleading

•
•
•
•

Treatment
• General measures such as analgesia and ﬂuids if needed
• The joint/bone should be immobilized where possible
• Obtaining tissue specimens permits bacterial culture and determination
of antimicrobial sensitivity. Duration of therapy is usually long, and
identiﬁcation of the organism allows antibiotic precision to reduce side
effects. After specimens are obtained but prior to results, ‘best guess’
therapy may be started after microbiological advice (eg clindamycin
and fusidic acid for haematogenous spread, and a broader spectrum
antibiotic when a complication of pressure sores)
• Surgical drainage should be considered after 36hr if systemic upset
continues, or if there is deep pus on imaging (required in ~30%)
• Treatment is initially intravenous, often later converted to oral therapy
• Total treatment duration is usually many weeks or months (depending
on sensitivity of organism and extent and location of infection)

Complications
• Metastatic infection
• Suppurative arthritis
• Chronic osteomyelitis infection becomes walled off in cavities within the
bone, discharging to the surface by a sinus. Symptoms relapse and remit
as sinuses close and reopen. Bone is at risk of pathological fracture.
Management is long and difﬁcult—this is a miserable complication of
joint replacement. Culture organisms and use appropriate antibiotics
to limit spread. Surgical removal of infected bone and/or prosthesis is
required for cure. Involve specialist bone infection teams if possible
• Malignant otitis externa occurs when otitis externa spreads to cause
osteomyelitis of the skull base. Occurs particularly in frail, older
diabetic patients. Caused by Pseudomonas and anaerobes. Facial nerve
palsy develops in half, with possible involvement of nerves IX–XII.
Requires prolonged antibiotics, specialist ENT input, and possible
surgical debridement

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

The elderly foot
Foot problems are very common (>80% over 65) and can cause major
disability including increased susceptibility to falls. A particular problem in
older people because:
• Multiple degenerative and disease pathologies occur and interact
• Many older people cannot reach their feet: monitoring and basic
hygiene (especially nail cutting) may be limited
• Patients think foot problems are a part of ageing or are embarrassed by
them and do not seek treatment
• Health professionals often neglect to examine feet and are too slow
to refer for specialist foot care. It is common to ﬁnd a patient naked
under a hospital gown but still with thick socks on
• Inappropriate footwear may be worn—most older people cannot
afford or refuse to wear ‘sensible’ shoes such as trainers
• Simple chiropody services are not available on the NHS (rationed to
diabetic patients and those with peripheral vascular disease in most
areas)

Nails
• Very long nails can curl back and cut into toes
• Nails thicken and become more brittle with age. This is worsened
by repeated trauma (eg bad footwear), poor circulation, or diabetes.
Ultimately the nail looks like a ram’s horn (onychogryphosis) and cannot
be cut with ordinary nail clippers
• Fungal nail infection (onychomycosis) produces a similar thickened,
discoloured nail
• Ingrowing toenails can cause pain and recurring infection

Skin
•
•
•
•

Calluses (hard skin)
Corns (painful calluses over pressure points with a nucleus/core)
Cracks and ulceration (see b ‘Leg ulcers’, p.593)
Cellulitis

Between the toes
Fungal infection (‘athlete’s foot’) is very common. The skin maceration
that results is a common cause of cellulitis.

Bone/joint disease
• A bunion (hallux valgus) is an outpointing deformity of the big toe,
which can overlap the second toe
• Hammer toes are ﬂexion deformities of proximal interproximal (IP)
joints
• Claw toes have deformities at both IP joints
• Osteoarthritis or gout of the metatarsophalangeal joint causes pain and
rigidity
• Neuropathic foot: longstanding severe sensory loss in a foot
(eg diabetics, tabes dorsalis) with multiple stress fractures and
osteoporosis disrupting the biomechanics of the joints (Charcot’s joint).
The foot/ankle is swollen and red but painless with loss of arches
(rockerbottom foot)

THE ELDERLY FOOT

Circulation impairment
Common. Assess vasculature (including an ABPI, see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Measure ABPI’, p.305) if there is pain, ulceration, infection, or skin
changes.

Sensory impairment
Touch, pain, and joint position sense are all important to maintaining
normal feet.

Other foot problems
Obesity, oedema and skin disorders.

HOW TO . . . Care for the elderly foot
Prevention
• Inspect both feet frequently (at least every other day). A hand mirror
assists inspection of the sole. 2If a patient cannot see, reach, or feel
their feet, someone else should be helping them regularly
• Examine for swelling, discolouration, ulcers, cuts, calluses, or corns
• If these are identiﬁed, consult a health professional (podiatrist, nurse
or doctor) promptly
• Wash feet daily in warm water with mild simple soap. If feet are
numb, check that the water temperature is not too hot with a hand
or with a thermometer (35–40°C is best)
• After washing, dry feet thoroughly, particularly between the toes
• Change socks or stockings daily
• Dry, hard or thick skin should be softened with emollients such as
liquid and white soft parafﬁn ointment (‘50:50’)
• Footwear should be supportive but soft. Take particular care with
new footwear, inspecting feet frequently after short periods of wear
to ensure that no sores have developed
• Avoid barefoot walking
• Cut nails regularly, cutting them straight across and not too short

Treatment
• Qualiﬁed podiatrists or chiropodists will debride calluses/corns and
use dressings and pressure relieving pads to prevent them recurring.
Availability on the NHS has been severely restricted recently (only
diabetics qualify in most regions) so cost may deter patients
• Treat athlete’s foot (eg clotrimazole cream bd for one week)
• Distinguish between thick discoloured nails due to onychomycosis
from simple onychogryphosis by sending nail scrapings for
microscopy for fungal hyphae. Topical antifungal treatment is often
not practical and tablet treatment (eg terbinaﬁne) can take months
to be effective so the vast majority of elderly patients remain
untreated. If you do decide to use terbinaﬁne, monitor liver function
and be wary of drug interactions
• Surgery may be used to remove nails or correct severe bone
deformity

491

492

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

The elderly hand
Hand problems are common in older people, and may lead to functional
problems (ﬁnding it hard to perform necessary activities of daily living) as
well as social and cosmetic problems (eg unable to wear a wedding ring).
Hand function can be assessed by:
• Opening and closing hand—looking for smooth and full movement
• Assessing grip strength
• Assessing ability to make a pincer grip
• Asking the patient to perform ﬁne motor tasks (eg doing up a button)

Hand deformity
• Heberden’s nodes (at distal IP) and Bouchard’s nodes (at proximal IP) are
common in older hands, and have X-ray appearances of OA. They are
rarely painful, but hands may become clumsy or difﬁcult to use
• Mallet ﬁnger is a ﬂexion deformity of the distal IP joint, usually after
trauma (due to tendon rupture). Splinting acutely can correct the
problem
• Trigger ﬁnger arises because of digital tendinitis and tenosynovitis
(inﬂammation of tendons and tendon sheaths of the hand, often with
ﬁbrosis). More common in people with diabetes. The ﬁnger may lock
in ﬂexion, suddenly extending with a snap. Treat with rest, splinting and
NSAIDs. Steroid injection may help, or surgical release can be done
• Swan-neck deformity occurs classically in rheumatoid arthritis (but
also with other tendon problems) and involves hyperextension of the
proximal IP joint with ﬂexion of the distal IP joint. Can cause signiﬁcant
disability, and surgery may help
• Boutonnière deformity is ﬂexion of the proximal IP joint and
hyperextension of the distal IP joint, due to tendon rupture,
dislocation, fracture, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Early
splinting may help, but surgery is rarely useful
• Dupuytren's contracture is progressive contracture of the palmar fascial
bands, producing ﬂexion deformities of the ﬁngers. Occurs mainly in
older men, with diabetes, alcoholism, or epilepsy. Autosomal dominant
inheritance (incomplete penetrance). Steroid injection may help early
disease; advanced disease requires surgery

Common hand symptoms
• Cold hands are commonly reported in older patients, and indeed hands
may feel cold, despite good vascular supply. Reassure, and use simple
measures (gloves, warm soaks) to provide relief
• Numb hands should prompt assessment for nerve entrapment or
peripheral neuropathy, but symptoms may be present in the absence
of these. Patients will describe intermittent pins and needles or just
a lowered sense of touch and may be clumsier. Use of warm soaks,
analgesia, stretching exercises, and reassurance can be helpful
• Hand cramps can be troublesome especially at night. Try warm soaks,
hand stretches, or calcium supplements to relieve
• Dropping objects in the absence of demonstrable pathology is common
and may result from subtle changes in proprioceptive ability

THE ELDERLY HAND

Repetitive strain injury
This is becoming more common in older people, often from excessive use
of computers. Treatment is with rest, analgesia and modiﬁcation of the
precipitating behaviour.

Carpal tunnel syndrome
• More common with age, OA, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes,
hypothyroidism, obesity, smokers or those who apply repetitive strain
to the wrist
• Have hand and wrist pain with paraesthesia and numbness in the
median nerve distribution
• The patient will often wake at night with burning or aching pain,
numbness, and tingling; shaking the hand provides relief
• Reduced sensation in the median nerve distribution and weak thumb
abduction are common and suggestive
• Check for Tinel's sign (tingling in the median nerve region, elicited by
tapping the palmar surface of the wrist over the median nerve site in
the carpal tunnel)
• Thenar muscle atrophy occurs late
• Older patients will often have multilevel nerve entrapment (cervical as
well as at the wrist)
• Treatment is initially with splinting and analgesia. Steroid injections can
help, but surgery is usually curative. Consider this even in frail older
patients in whom function (eg ability to hold their frame) is impaired—
the procedure can be done under local anaesthesia

Complex regional pain syndrome
• Also known as reﬂex sympathetic dystrophy, or shoulder hand
syndrome
• Occurs in the extremities, characterized by pain, swelling, limited
range of motion, vasomotor instability, skin changes, and patchy bone
demineralization
• Frequently begins following an injury, surgery, or vascular event such as
a MI or stroke
• Pathophysiology poorly understood
• Think of the diagnosis where there is intense throbbing arm pain with
an alteration in skin temperature
• Autonomic testing is abnormal, and bone scans show increased uptake
early in the disease. X-rays may show osteopenia and MRI may show
skin and tissue changes later in the disease
• Early mobilization after a stroke helps prevent this condition
• Early disease can be treated with smoking cessation, topical
counterirritants (eg capsaicin), oral NSAIDs and steroids.
Bisphosphonates help prevent bone loss and provide pain relief
• More advanced disease may respond to regional sympathetic nerve
blocks, and generally require specialist pain team input

493

494

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

The painful hip
2The important diagnosis not to miss in the frail elderly is fracture.
Having a low threshold of suspicion and for investigation is key.

Hip fracture
• The absence of a recent fall and ability to weight-bear should not put
you off obtaining an X-ray if recent onset, or severe pain
• In any bed-bound patient after a fall look for inability to lift the leg off
the bed and pain on movement (especially rotation) even if they are
not ﬁt to stand. A shortened externally rotated leg is a useful sign but
will occur in many who have replacement hips and is not seen in all
• Some patients can walk on a fractured hip
• Always:
• Get two views (anteroposterior and lateral) of the pelvis and
proximal femur
• Have the X-rays reported by a radiologist— changes can be subtle
• Check for pubic ramus fractures as well as fractures of the femoral
head and shaft
• If initial ﬁlms are normal but clinical suspicion is high, consider repeating
X-ray in a few days (bone fragments can move apart) or proceed to an
MRI or bone scan. It is important to make the diagnosis early—do not
be afraid to argue your case with radiology
Almost all hip fractures require surgical repair no matter how frail the
patient (conservative management with or without traction is painful and
has a massive morbidity and mortality). By contrast, low-energy pelvic
fractures in older people rarely require surgery (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Manage non-operative fractures’, p.471). Even with surgery the 30-day
mortality for a fractured neck of femur is high (>10%). Remember to initiate
osteoporosis treatment.

Osteoarthritis
•
•
•
•

Pain is ‘boreing’ and stiffness occurs after rest
Restriction of movement occurs in all planes
OA can signiﬁcantly increase chance of falls
Total hip replacement is now widely available and very effective
• Consider referral for radiographic moderate/severe disease with
ongoing pain or disability despite trial of conservative treatment
• There is a 1% mortality but older people often have a good longterm result. Revision surgery is rarely needed because activity levels
are lower than in younger people (and life expectancy less)

Other causes of hip pain
Paget’s disease: also causes secondary osteoarthritis
Radicular pain referred from spine
Metastases
Septic arthritis: rare and difﬁcult diagnosis to make but consider joint
aspiration under ultrasound if your patient appears septic with a very
painful hip, especially after recent hip surgery
• Referred pain from the knee
• Psoas abscess
•
•
•
•

THE PAINFUL HIP

The role of the orthogeriatrician
Mainly focuses on patients with femoral fractures. Models of care include
an orthogeriatrician visiting the trauma ward, joint care on a joint ward,
or care being provided on a geriatric ward, with the trauma surgeons
performing the surgery only. The NHS has recently introduced a ‘best
practice tariff’ for femoral fractures, where trusts are paid more if there
is (among other things) joint orthogeriatric/trauma care.
Preoperative interventions
These include:
• Taking a history, including clarifying cause for the fall
• Examination looking for ﬂuid balance, or other conditions that may
have caused the fall
• Review of drugs (eg suspending diuretics, ACE inhibitors if dry)
• Management of speciﬁc perioperative drug issues (eg warfarin
cessation)
• Weighing of beneﬁts of certain tests (eg echocardiogram) before
surgery (will rarely alter management)
• Optimizing ﬂuid balance
• Ensuring adequate and appropriate pain relief
• Reviewing importance of normalizing electrolytes (eg K=2mmol/L is
more of a priority that a Na of 130mmol/L)
• Talking to the patient and relatives
Operative interventions
These include collaborating with surgical and anaesthetic colleagues to
determine the optimal time for surgery. ‘Fitness’ for surgery is rarely
achieved, and it is often a question of judging the least risky time to
proceed—usually as soon as possible. The geriatrician can provide a
prompt assessment to facilitate this.
Post-operative interventions
These include:
• Promoting early mobilization by MDT working
• Ensuring that pain management is effective and safe
• Identifying delirium, dementia, depression and alcohol misuse with
initiation of appropriate treatment
• Multidisciplinary falls assessment and link with the falls service where
appropriate
• Rationalizing medications
• Initiating osteoporosis prevention measures
• Determining optimal venue for rehabilitation, optimizing the chances
of returning to the previous place of residence
• Advising on complex ethical issues including end-of-life care and
cardiopulmonary resuscitation
• Being involved in morbidity and mortality review with the
orthopaedic and anaesthetic teams
• Being involved in training and audit, together with the development
of evidence-based pathways and guidelines

495

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

The painful back
Assessment
• History should include position, quality, duration, and radiation of pain
as well as associated sensory symptoms, bladder, or bowel problems
and a systems review
• Undress the patient and look for bruising and deformity
• Apply pressure to each vertebra in turn looking for local tenderness
• Look for restriction of movement and gait abnormality
• Always check neurology and consider bowel/bladder function
2‘Red ﬂags’ for serious pathology include acute onset, leg weakness, fever,
weight loss, bowel and bladder dysfunction (including a new catheter).

Causes
• Osteoarthritis of the facet joints becomes more common than disc
pathology with advancing age (discs are less pliable and less likely to
herniate)
• Osteoporosis and vertebral crush fractures can cause acute
well-localized pain, chronic pain or no pain at all
• Metastatic cancer should always be considered especially if pain is new
or severe, there are constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, or
pain from an apparent fracture fails to improve
• Vertebral osteomyelitis and infective discitis should be considered in
those with fever and raised inﬂammatory markers especially if they are
immunosuppressed (eg rheumatoid arthritis on steroids)
2Not all back pain comes from the spine. Differential diagnoses that
should not be missed include pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer, biliary colic,
duodenal ulcer, aortic aneurysm, renal pain, retroperitoneal pathology,
pulmonary embolism, Guillain–Barré syndrome or MI.

Investigations
• FBC, ESR (myeloma screen if raised), CRP, ALP, calcium, PSA (in men)
• MRI is good at identifying serious pathology, eg cancer, infection,
compression syndromes
• CT can be done if unable to have MRI but is less good
• Bone scan is useful especially if there are multiple sites of pain
• Plain X-rays may reveal diagnosis but ‘wear and tear’ changes are very
common and correlate poorly with pain. May miss serious pathology

Treatment
First, make a diagnosis to guide therapy.
Speciﬁc therapies include:
• Bisphosphonates or calcitonin for osteoporotic collapse
• Radiotherapy is very effective for metastatic deposits
• Urgent surgery or radiotherapy should be considered for cord
compression, with high-dose iv steroids in the meantime

THE PAINFUL BACK

General therapies for most diagnoses include:
• Standard analgesia ladder (see b ‘Analgesia’, p.140)
• Physiotherapy is often helpful in improving pain and function or at least
preventing deconditioning
• Exercise and weight loss (if obese) are difﬁcult to achieve but will help
• TENS can help some and is without side effects
• Antispasmodics, eg diazepam 2mg if muscular spasm is prominent
• Consider referral to pain specialist for local injections, eg facet joints or
epidurals
• Once serious pathology has been excluded a chiropractor/osteopath
can sometimes help

CHAPTER 17

Musculoskeletal system

The painful shoulder
The shoulder joint has little bony articulation (and hence little arthritis)
but lots of muscle and tendon which is prone to damage. Many conditions become chronic and examining elderly people will reveal a high
prevalence of pain and restricted movement. Patients compensate (eg by
avoiding clothes that need to be pulled over head) and may not report
symptoms.
Before diagnosing one of the conditions that follow, exclude systemic
problems such as polymyalgia rheumatica and rheumatoid arthritis.
Remember that neck problems, diaphragmatic pathology, apical lung
cancer, and angina can also produce shoulder pain.

Frozen shoulder/adhesive capsulitis
•
•
•
•
•
•

Usually idiopathic but sometimes follow trauma and stroke
More common in people with diabetes
Loss of rotation (internal and external) and abduction
Painful for weeks to months then stiff (frozen) for further 4–12 months
Mainstay of treatment is physiotherapy/exercise—avoid rest
Intra-articular steroids may help pain and improve tolerance to early
mobilization

Bicipital tendonitis
• Pain in speciﬁc area (anterior/lateral humeral head) aggravated by
supination on the forearm while elbow held ﬂexed against body
• Treatment is rest and corticosteroid injection followed by gentle
biceps stretching exercises

Rotator cuff tendonitis
• Dull ache radiating to upper arm with ‘painful arc’ (pain between 60°
and 120° when abducting arm)
• Rest, occasionally with immobilization in a sling, and corticosteroid
injection
• Physiotherapy and exercises may help
• Arthroscopic decompression can sometimes relieve pain

Rotator cuff tear
•
•
•
•
•
•

May occur following trauma
Reduced range of active and passive movements of shoulder
Ultrasound and MRI diagnostic
Treat with rest and corticosteroid injection
Physiotherapy and exercises may help
Surgical repair possible in some cases

Shoulder dislocation
• May occur after a fall (usually anterior) or seizure (may be posterior)
• Shoulder is painful, appears deformed, and X-rays will conﬁrm
• Check for neurovascular damage; arrange pain relief and joint
reduction by manipulation

THE PAINFUL SHOULDER

Glenohumeral OA
• Uncommon site for arthritis—there is usually previous trauma
• Presentation and examination similar to frozen shoulder
• Classic examination ﬁndings are of:
• Local glenohumeral joint line tenderness and swelling anteriorly
• Loss of range of motion of external rotation and abduction
• Crepitation
• X-rays will conﬁrm
• Initial treatment is with analgesia and mobilization
• Joint injection with steroids can be useful
• Failure to respond to conservative measures should prompt
consideration of surgical referral for joint replacement—this is highly
successful in appropriate patients

CHAPTER 18

Pressure injuries

Pressure sores
Areas of skin necrosis due to pressure-induced ischaemia found on
sacrum, heels, over greater trochanters, shoulders, etc. Also known as
decubitus ulcers or bedsores. Incidence higher in hospital (new sores form
during acute illness) but prevalence higher in long-stay community settings
(healing takes months/years). Average hospital prevalence 5–10% despite
drives to improve education and preventative strategies. The ﬁnancial and
stafﬁng resource burden of pressure sores is huge.

Skin hyperaemia
Non-blanching erythema
Broken skin or blistering (epidermis 9 dermis only)
Ulcer down to subcutaneous fat
Ulcer down to bone, joint or tendon

22 hrs of tissue ischaemia is sufﬁcient for the subsequent development of
an ulcer and the causative insult often occurs just prior to or at the time
of admission (on ED trolleys, intraoperative, at home). There is considerable lag between the ischaemic insult and the resulting ulcer. Grade I
erythema often progress to deep ulcers over days/weeks without further
ischaemic insult. Inspect sacrum and heels at least daily.

Risk factors
Include age, immobility (especially postoperative), low or high body
weight, malnutrition, dehydration, incontinence, neurological damage
(either neuropathy or decreased conscious level), sedative drugs, vascular
impairment.
Several scoring systems (eg Waterlow score) combine these factors to
stratify risk. They aid/prompt clinical judgement of individual patient risk.

Mechanisms
• Pressure—normal capillary pressure 24–34mmHg—pressures
exceeding 35mmHg compress and cause ischemia. This pressure is
easily exceeded on a simple foam mattress at pressure points such as
heels
• Shear—where skin is pulled away from ﬁxed axial skeleton small blood
vessels can be kinked or torn. When a patient is propped up in bed or
dragged (eg during a lift or transfer) there is considerable shear on the
sacrum
• Friction—rubbing the skin decreases its integrity especially at moving
extremities, eg elbows, heels. Avoid crumbs, drip sets and debris
between patient and sheets. Massage of pressure areas no longer
recommended
• Moisture—sweat, urine, and faeces cause maceration and decrease
integrity

PRESSURE SORES

Management
• Prevention—demands awareness—NICE guidelines suggest all patients
are risk assessed within 6hr of admission (M www.nice.org.uk, clinical
guideline 29 (2005)). Regular reassessment during hospital admission
should occur especially if condition of patient changes
• Turning and handling—there is no evidence to suggest how often
immobile, high-risk patients should be turned in bed. Two-hourly turns
are historically based and rarely achieved. Frequency should be judged
individually. Modern mattresses decrease frequency but don’t eradicate
need for turns. Avoid friction and sheer by using correct manual
handling devices. Consider limiting sitting out to 2hr. Encourage early
mobilization, optimize pain control, minimize sedative drugs
• Pressure-relieving devices—consider both beds and chairs. There are few
RCT data to compare but most hospitals have access to (in order of
increasing pressure reduction and cost)
• High speciﬁcation foam mattresses
• Alternating pressure mattresses (air pockets intermittently inﬂate
and deﬂate) eg Nimbus©
• Air-ﬂuidized (warm air pumped through tiny spheres to produce a
ﬂuid-like cushion) or waterbed mattresses
• Promote healing environment
• Nutrition—protein and calorie supplements. There is no evidence
to support the use of vitamins, eg vitamin C, or minerals, eg zinc,
but they are unlikely to do harm
• Manage incontinence (one of the few times that a geriatrician might
recommend a catheter)
• Good glycaemic control in people with diabetes
• Correct anaemia (normochromic/normocytic anaemia common)
• Debridement—dead tissue should be removed with scalpel
(no anaesthetic required), maggots or occasionally topical
streptokinase, or suction. Some patients beneﬁt from surgery,
eg debridement, skin grafting or myocutaneous ﬂaps
• Dressings—enormous choice with little evidence to favour one type
over another. Use gels to soften, hydroﬁbre/gels (often seaweed
based) for cavities then a secondary dressing over the top
• Antibiotics—all ulcers are colonized (surface swabs positive 100%),
only 1% at any given time have active infection causing illness. Look
for surrounding cellulitis and signs of sepsis, check blood cultures
or deep tissue biopsy for conﬁrmation. Common organisms include
mixed Gram-negatives (Bacteroides) Gram-positives (enterococci
and staphylococci), and yeasts. If antibiotics are indicated, use widespectrum antibiotics including anaerobic cover. Consider osteomyelitis
where bone is exposed (see b ‘Osteomyelitis’, p.488). MRSA
colonization is a growing problem, is very difﬁcult to eradicate, and
often leads to a patient having prolonged isolation, which is detrimental
to their psychological well-being and rehabilitation

503

CHAPTER 18

Pressure injuries

Compression mononeuropathy
• Where nerves are compressed against bone they can be damaged
• This is usually a demyelination injury (neuropraxia) which resolves
spontaneously in 2–12 weeks
• Alcohol, diabetes, and malnutrition increase susceptibility
• Any patient who has had a period of immobility on a hard surface is at
risk especially if they were unconscious
• Such injuries can be misdiagnosed as strokes but are LMN in one nerve
territory only (see b Appendix, ‘Dermatomes’, p.686)
• Nerve conduction studies are rarely required to conﬁrm diagnosis
• Treatment is supportive—many such patients are acutely unwell—but
recognition becomes more important during rehabilitation (Table 18.1)

RHABDOMYOLYSIS

Rhabdomyolysis
Following prolonged pressure (eg if patient cannot get up after a fall or
stroke or after a period of unconsciousness) muscle necrosis can occur,
which releases myoglobin. High levels are nephrotoxic, precipitating
to cause tubule obstruction with acute renal failure especially as these
patients are usually dehydrated.
2Remember to check U,C+E in all patients who have been found on the
ﬂoor after a ‘long lie’. Many frail elderly patients with bruises after a fall
will have raised CK levels without developing renal problems but ensuring
good hydration (often with 24–48hr of intravenous ﬂuids) and repeating
renal function in such patients is good practice.

Diagnosis
Suspect the full rhabdomyolysis syndrome in any patient with:
• Prolonged unconsciousness
• Signs of acute pressure sores of the skin
• CK levels at least ﬁve times normal
Urine may be dark (‘Coca-Cola’ urine) and urinalysis is positive to haemoglobin but without red blood cells. Hyperkalaemia and hypocalcaemia
can occur.

Treatment
Treat with aggressive rehydration. Monitor urine output, electrolytes, and
renal function closely—if renal failure occurs consider temporary dialysis.
Prognosis is good if patient survives initial few days.
Other causes of rhabdomyolysis include drugs (especially statins),
compartment syndrome, acute myositis, severe exertion eg seizures/
rigors, heat stroke (see b ‘Heat-related illness’, p.418) and neuroleptic
malignant syndrome (see b ‘Neuroleptic malignant syndrome’, p.169).

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

The ageing genitourinary system
Changes in women
• Oestrogen levels fall following menopause (usually around age 50)
leading to vaginal epithelium atrophy, decreased vaginal lubrication, and
acidiﬁcation and greater vulnerability to vaginal and urinary infection
• The uterus and ovaries atrophy
• The vagina becomes smaller and less elastic
Hormone replacement therapy improves menopausal symptoms but has
other serious adverse effects that severely limit its use (see b ‘Hormone
replacement therapy and the menopause’, p.448).

Changes in men
• There are gradual changes in anatomy and function, but no sudden
change in fertility, and most older men remain fertile
• Testicular mass and sperm production fall as does semen quality
• The prostate gland enlarges and ﬁbroses—benign prostatic
hypertrophy (BPH)—but the volume of ejaculate remains similar
• Erection becomes less sustained, less ﬁrm, and the refractory period
between erections lengthens. However, severe erectile dysfunction,
ie inability to sustain an erection sufﬁcient to have sexual intercourse,
is usually the result of pathology or drug treatment rather than ageing
itself
• Testosterone levels remain stable or decrease slightly. In a minority,
more severe falls are seen and hypogonadism may become
symptomatic, manifesting as fatigue, weakness, osteoporosis, muscle
atrophy, declining sexual function, and impaired cognition
Testosterone replacement may be considered in those with low hormone
levels and symptoms. This may have symptomatic beneﬁt, but risks serious
side effects (eg rising haematocrit, prostatic hypertrophy). Low doses
(delivered by patches or injection) may reduce this risk, but monitoring
is probably needed. There are no good-quality long-term trials of replacement therapy.

Changes in both sexes
Cross-sectional studies show much reduced frequency of sexual behaviour
of all kinds in older people. However, longitudinal studies show much
smaller changes, suggesting that many changes are due to cohort effects,
eg changes in the prevailing social environment during early adulthood.
Other factors include physical and psychological illness (eg arthritis,
depression), reduced potency, social changes (eg lack of a partner due to
bereavement). Most of these factors are modiﬁable.

THE AGEING GENITOURINARY SYSTEM

HOW TO . . . Examine the older female genital system
This is an important part of the assessment for symptoms such as postmenopausal bleeding, urinary incontinence and symptoms of prolapse.
Approach tactfully—many older women will not be keen on pelvic
examination.
Proceed as follows:
• Reassure the patient and position for examination—the standard
position with the patient on her back and the legs spread may not be
possible with hip disease; consider rolling the patient onto her side,
drawing up the knees and inspecting from this position
• Inspect the external genitalia, looking for atrophy, erythema,
infection, and abrasions. Severe prolapse may be immediately
apparent
• Ask the patient to bear down, which may reveal smaller degrees of
prolapse
• Perform a vaginal examination, remembering to use plenty of
lubrication. Begin with a single digit if the vaginal opening is tight
• Some rectocoeles are only detected by bimanual examination of the
vagina and rectum
• Use a speculum if available and tolerated

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Benign prostatic hyperplasia:
presentation
BPH is characterized by non-malignant enlargement of the prostate
gland and an increase in prostatic smooth muscle tone. The resulting
bladder outlet obstruction leads to lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS;
‘prostatism’).
Prostatism affects 25–50% of men over 65 years, although the histological
changes of BPH are even more common—almost universal in those >70.
The natural history is variable—some deteriorate, some stay the same,
and some improve, even without treatment.

Assessment
Symptoms
LUTS are variable, and may be mostly either:
• Obstructive. Weak stream, straining, hesitancy, nocturia, acute
retention, or chronic retention with overﬂow incontinence
• Irritative. Frequency, dysuria, urgency, and urge incontinence
Other presentations include haematuria (the prostate is hypervascular),
UTI, and renal failure secondary to hydronephrosis. Obstructive symptoms
may be worsened by drugs, eg sedating antihistamines. Tricyclic antidepressants may improve irritative symptoms, but worsen obstruction.
Scoring systems (see Box 19.1) can help determine symptom severity,
track progression, and response to treatment.
Examination
Include the genitals (phimosis or meatal stenosis), abdomen (palpable
bladder), neurological system, and digital rectal examination (DRE).
In BPH, the prostate is usually smooth, ﬁrm, and enlarged. An irregular
prostate can occur in BPH, calculi, infarction, or cancer.
Investigations
Tests may help conﬁrm the diagnosis, exclude other pathology, and identify
complications:
• Urinary ﬂow rate conﬁrms obstruction, but is rarely needed
• Blood glucose to exclude diabetes, a common cause of urinary
symptoms
• U,C+E (renal failure)
• Urinalysis (infection, haematuria)
• USS renal tract (hydronephrosis, high residual volume (see Box 20.1)
• PSA. Consider this, especially if the prostate is irregular. However,
testing is not mandatory, and in general should be guided by the
patient’s views, after a discussion of risks and beneﬁts of further
investigation and treatment (see b ‘Prostatic cancer: presentation’,
p.514 and b ‘Prostate-specific antigen’, p.516)
• Cystoscopy and USS. If haematuria is detected, to exclude renal and
bladder cancer

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Benign prostatic hyperplasia:
treatment
Treatment choice is inﬂuenced by patient preference, severity of symptoms,
presence of complications, and ﬁtness for surgery.

Conservative measures
‘Watchful waiting’ is reasonable if symptoms are mild or moderate and
complications absent. Reassure the patient. Reassess clinically and check
renal function at 6–12 monthly intervals. Advise reduction in evening ﬂuid
intake; stop unnecessary diuretics. The main risk is acute urine retention
(1–2% per year).

Herbal preparations
These are widely used by patients, bought ‘over the counter’; always
ask about non-prescription remedies. The most widely used is saw palmetto (Serenoa repens) extract, and there is some evidence that it works,
especially in milder disease, perhaps acting as a 5-A-reductase inhibitor
(see b ‘Drugs’, p.512). PSA levels may therefore be reduced.

Drugs
Suitable for mild, moderate, or severe symptoms without complications, especially if patient preference is strong. Patients with more severe
symptoms beneﬁt most. Two drug classes may help:
• A-adrenergic blockers (‘A-blockers’ eg doxazosin, terazosin, tamsulosin).
They relax prostatic smooth muscle, increasing urine ﬂow rates
and reducing symptoms in days. Side effects are common: the most
important are hypotension, especially orthostatic hypotension, and
syncope. Use cautiously, starting with low dose (eg doxazosin 1mg
od, increased in 1mg increments at 2-week intervals to 4mg). Exercise
great caution if prescribed with diuretics or other vasodilators, if
there is a past history of syncope, and in the frail. Tamsulosin may be
more prostate-selective than other A-blockers and may have fewer
circulatory side effects
• 5-A-reductase inhibitors (eg ﬁnasteride). These inhibit prostatic
testosterone metabolism, reducing prostatic size. Beneﬁt occurs slowly
(months) and is most likely if the prostate is large (>40mL); those with
mild enlargement beneﬁt little or not at all. Side effects are uncommon
but include erectile dysfunction (<5%), gynaecomastia, and loss of
libido. Given the absence of cardiovascular side effects, 5-A-reductase
inhibitors may be a better option in the frail older person. PSA levels
fall by 750%, so double the observed value to give an indication of
prostate cancer risk
• Combination treatment. There is no evidence that this is more effective
than monotherapy. If there is no signiﬁcant beneﬁt with one drug class,
switch to another, or consider surgery

BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA: TREATMENT

A-Blockers, prostatism, and hypertension
Many men have symptoms of prostatism and are also hypertensive.
A-blockers can be an attractive option as the one drug may treat both.
However, the evidence for A-blockers in the treatment of hypertension
is inferior than that for several other drug classes. Assess the impact
on each problem separately, and consider prescribing the most appropriate treatment for each individual condition. See b ‘HOW TO . . .
Use anti-hypertensives in a patient with comorbid conditions’, p.271.

Surgery
More effective than drugs or ‘watchful waiting’, but side effects are more
common and usually irreversible. Indicated if:
• Symptoms are moderate or severe (with patient preference)
• There are complications (recurrent UTI or haematuria, renal failure)
• A trial of drug treatment has failed
Transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). The (gold-) standard
procedure. Success rates are >90%. Adverse effects include retrograde
ejaculation (most), erectile dysfunction (5–10%), incontinence (1%) and
death (<1%). 10% need further surgery within a few years.
Newer procedures. Several have been developed. They are generally
less invasive and probably have fewer adverse effects, but long-term
outcome data are less good. Local availability and expertise are limited.
For example:
• Transurethral incision. of the prostate (TUIP). Effective in those with
smaller prostate glands. Low incidence of side effects
• Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT) and transurethral
needle ablation (TUNA). These newer systems are well tolerated, and
require only local anaesthesia in an outpatient setting. However, some
are time-consuming and difﬁcult to learn, long-term results are less
well known, and availability varies locally
Open prostatectomy is reserved for very large glands and where other
interventions are needed, eg removal of bladder stones. It is very effective,
but comorbidity is higher.

Urinary catheterization
Urinary catheterization is an option where:
• Symptoms are severe, or signiﬁcant complications have occurred
(eg retention)
• Surgical mortality and morbidity would be high
• Drug treatment has not been tolerated, or is unlikely to be effective
A long-term catheter may be required if the patient fails a trial (or trials)
without catheter.

513

514

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Prostatic cancer: presentation
A very common cancer in men, much more so with age: median age at
diagnosis is over 70. However:
• Most die with tumour rather than because of it
• Most are asymptomatic, or have only obstructive symptoms
• Many tumours do not progress, even without treatment
This leads to difﬁcult management decisions, especially in older people,
where life expectancy for other reasons may be low, and expensive,
unpleasant or risky treatments may not be worthwhile.

Assessment
Predictors of an adverse disease course (symptoms, local progression,
metastases and death) include more advanced stage (TNM classiﬁcation)
and histological grade (eg Gleason score: see b ‘Gleason score’, p.514).
Localized cancer—often detected when evaluating a man with lower
tract symptoms due to BPH (by ﬁnding an elevated PSA), or incidentally,
eg, at TURP for BPH. Tumour remains within the gland capsule; the
tumour focus may be very small, and in no way responsible for symptoms.
DRE may be normal. Prognosis is generally good, especially if grade is
favourable. Cure may be possible, although for more indolent tumours,
attempts at cure (surgery, radiotherapy) may be worse than the disease.
Locally advanced cancer without metastases—usually detected in patients
with urinary symptoms, or at DRE performed for other reasons. A much
larger group now that PSA testing is more common. The tumour has
broken through the capsule, and prognosis is more adverse. Cure is not
usually possible, but survival may be prolonged.
Metastatic cancer—up to half of newly diagnosed patients have metastatic
disease. Many are asymptomatic. Features (decreasing frequency) include
urinary symptoms, bone pain, constitutional symptoms (eg weight loss),
renal failure, pathological fracture, and anaemia due to bone marrow
inﬁltration. A minority have an indolent course, and with treatment may
survive many years.

Gleason score
A histological grading system that correlates well with outcome and helps
guide treatment choice. A composite of two scores (each range 1–5),
therefore range 2–10:
• 2–4: Well differentiated
• 5–7: Moderately differentiated
• 8–10: Poorly differentiated

Screening
There is no good evidence that earlier detection through screening
improves prognosis. This often requires careful explanation. Rectal examination is insensitive: tumours detected in this way are often large and
locally advanced. PSA has its own drawbacks (see b ‘Prostate-speciﬁc
antigen’, p.516).

PROSTATIC CANCER: PRESENTATION

Tests
These should be selected advisedly, after considering the patient’s wishes,
the implications of a negative or positive result, and any risks of the test.
• PSA. See b ‘Prostrate-speciﬁc antigen’, p.516
• FBC. Evidence of marrow inﬁltration
• Serum calcium, LFTs. Evidence of metastases
• U,C+E. Evidence of post-renal renal failure
• Transrectal ultrasound and biopsy. Provides tissue for histological
diagnosis and grading. Risks haemorrhage and infection
• Bone scan or X-rays. If there are symptoms, or bone biochemistry is
suggestive. Metastasis to bone is common; appearance is sclerotic
much more commonly than lytic
• CT/MRI scan. For tumour staging where surgery is contemplated

515

516

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Prostate-speciﬁc antigen
PSA is made in the prostate and blood levels reﬂect prostatic synthesis.

Using PSA
It has two deﬁnite useful roles:
• In very early detection of localized prostate cancer when treatment
may be curative
• In tracking tumour progression: changes in PSA usually reﬂect changes
in tumour mass

Screening with PSA
PSA is produced by both benign and malignant prostatic tissue, and there
is no single useful cut-off point that separates those with cancer from
those without:
• Two-thirds of men with a high PSA do not have prostate cancer
• One-ﬁfth of men with prostate cancer have a normal PSA
The higher the PSA level, the more likely is cancer. However, even at
moderately high levels (>10microgram/L) the positive predictive value is
only 65%. Speciﬁcity is even less in older people as the benign causes of
elevated PSA are more common.
Combining this with the limitations of treatment, any screening
programme utilizing PSA yields:
• Many people with high PSA, but no cancer is found after further tests
• Many people with locally advanced prostate cancer for whom early
treatment is not known to improve prognosis
Non-malignant causes of increased PSA
PSA increases with age and with:
• BPH
• Prostatitis
• Urinary tract infection
• Rectal examination (up to 7 days)
• Prostatic biopsy (6 weeks)
• Urethral catheterization
• Urethral instrumentation, eg cystoscopy
• Vigorous exercise (48hrs)
• Ejaculation (48hrs)
(Figures in brackets are approximate durations of elevation.)
Age-speciﬁc PSA values
The following have been suggested as cut-off points to reduce unnecessary
referral and investigation of patients with benign prostate disease.
• 50–59 years: t3.0microgram/L
• 60–69 years: t4.0microgram/L
• t70 years: t5.0microgram/L
PSA reduces with some drug treatment (eg 5-A-reductase inhibitors;
herbal remedies such as saw palmetto (S. repens)), and may therefore
reduce the thresholds given for referral.

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Prostatic cancer: treatment
• Localized cancer—there are several treatment options, including
‘watchful waiting’, hormonal treatment, radiotherapy, and surgery.
Cure can often be achieved
• ‘Watchful waiting’—usually reserved for those with modest life
expectancy (<10 years) and lower grade (Gleason score 2–6) localized
tumours, where progression is rare within 10 years. Check PSA every
4–6 months. Start treatment (usually hormonal) if symptoms, or if
PSA rises
• Hormone treatment—there is doubt whether early hormone treatment
improves outcome compared to ‘watchful waiting’
• Radiotherapy—the most usual choice for high-grade localized tumours.
Probably as effective as surgery, but better tolerated. Side effects
include erectile dysfunction, irritative urinary symptoms, and radiation
proctitis
• Surgery—radical prostatectomy is a major procedure, usually indicated
only for those with long life expectancy, high-grade tumours, and
in good health. Major side effects are incontinence, impotence and
haemorrhage
• Locally advanced disease without metastases—key treatments are
radiotherapy (also discussed here) and/or androgen deprivation (also
discussed here). The relative beneﬁts are unclear. Surgery probably
offers no beneﬁt, other than TURP to relieve outﬂow symptoms
• Metastatic disease—androgen deprivation (‘hormone treatment’) is
the linchpin of treatment. This can be achieved by castration (bilateral
orchidectomy, usually under local anaesthesia), but is usually chemical,
largely for reasons of patient preference. Treatment should not be
delayed, even if there are no symptoms. Luteinizing hormone releasing
hormone (LHRH) agonists are used commonly and are usually effective
for 12–18 months. If disease progresses despite LHRH agonists,
patients occasionally respond to antiandrogens. Surgery offers no
beneﬁts
• LHRH agonists (eg goserelin)—given as injections or implants, these
cause initial (2 weeks) stimulation and then sustained depression of
testosterone release. The initial increase can cause tumour growth
(‘ﬂare’) with adverse effects, eg urinary outﬂow obstruction, spinal
cord compression, or bone pain. If anticipated, anti-androgens may
help. Continuous therapy is not needed: survival appears similar if
therapy is stopped when PSA levels are normal and restarted when
they rise
• Antiandrogens (eg bicalutamide, ﬂutamide)—useful in inhibiting tumour
ﬂare after LHRH agonist initiation, in tumour refractory to LHRH
agonists, if LHRH agonists are not tolerated or accepted (eg because
of erectile dysfunction) or where oral drugs are preferred. There is no
evidence that combined antiandrogens and LHRH agonists are helpful
Side effects of LHRH agonists and antiandrogens include hot ﬂushes,
erectile dysfunction, and gynaecomastia.

PROSTATIC CANCER: TREATMENT

Late-stage prostate cancer
Eventually, prostate cancer may become resistant (refractory) to hormone
treatment, manifesting as a rising PSA and/or worsening symptoms whilst
on treatment. Other treatments (eg oestrogens) may be tried, but are
rarely very effective. Death follows, often in months.
Common complications, usually in more advanced disease, include:
• Bone pain
• A major cause of reduced quality of life
• Optimize oral analgesia: combinations of paracetamol, opiates and
NSAIDs are effective
• Local pain is helped by radiotherapy
• Bisphosphonates or steroids may also help
• Pathological bone fracture
• Usually requires surgical ﬁxation
• Acute urine retention
• Catheterize
• Intensify anti-tumour treatment if appropriate (eg hormone
treatment, radiotherapy)
• Consider TURP
• Post-renal renal failure—determine site of obstruction by ultrasound:
• Prostatic obstruction: catheter, TURP, intensify anti-tumour
treatment
• Ureteric obstruction: stenting or nephrostomy
• Spinal cord compression
• An emergency, as early decompression improves neurological
outcome
• Conﬁrm with CT or MRI
• Steroids, radiotherapy, or surgery help decompress the cord

Genitourinary medicine

Postmenopausal vaginal bleeding
Deﬁned as bleeding from the genital tract over 1 year after onset of
menopausal amenorrhoea. The time criterion reﬂects the fact that menstruation is often irregular and infrequent around menopause, and investigations for sinister pathology are not then worthwhile.
Most cases are secondary to benign pathology, but treatment of the
few cases of cancer (largely endometrial) is far more effective if identiﬁed
early, so do not delay assessment. Malignancy is more likely if bleeding is
signiﬁcant and recurrent—investigate vigorously if no cause is apparent.

Causes of post-menopausal vaginal bleeding
In approximate order of frequency:
Atrophic vaginitis
Inﬂammation results as the thinner, less corniﬁed epithelium is exposed to
a more alkaline vaginal environment colonized by a broad microbial ﬂora
Endometrial hyperplasia
Secondary to:
• Exogenous oestrogen (eg HRT)
• Unopposed endogenous oestrogen (especially in older, obese women
where peripheral conversion of steroid hormones to oestrogens by fat
cells is higher)
• Benign tumour, eg cervical or endometrial polyps
• Vaginal prolapse and ulceration
Vaginal infection
Carcinoma
• Endometrial
• Cervical
• Vulval
• Vaginal
• Ovarian
Spurious
Other relatively common causes of ‘vaginal’ bleeding are haematuria and
rectal bleeding. Drugs causing endometrial disease (hyperplasia, polyps
and cancer) include:
• HRT (with cyclical replacement: investigate if bleed at unexpected
times; for continuous oestrogen and progestogen: investigate if
irregular bleeding persists for >12 months after treatment initiation)
• Tamoxifen (via a paradoxical endometrial oestrogen-like effect)
After hysterectomy bleeding is commonly due to atrophic vaginitis or
overgrowth of post-surgical granulation tissue.

POSTMENOPAUSAL VAGINAL BLEEDING

Assessment
• History—assess the amount and frequency of bleeding, if necessary
by discussing with carers. Consider other possible sources of blood,
eg urinary, rectal. Take an accurate drug history.
• Examine—examine the genitalia, perineum, and rectum to exclude
tumour, trauma, and bleeding from atrophic sites. Obesity or
osteoarthritis may make examination difﬁcult; the left or right lateral
positions are usually more successful.
• Investigation—FBC to exclude severe anaemia. Urine dipstick for
haematuria is unlikely to be speciﬁc to blood of urinary tract origin,
especially if bleeding is recurrent or ongoing.
Further tests are usually guided by expert gynaecological advice, but may
include:
• Cervical smear
• Vaginal ultrasound to assess endometrial thickness (<5mm effectively
excludes cancer and may prevent the need for more tests)
• Hysteroscopy—can be done under local or general anaesthetic
• Dilatation and curettage
• Consider investigation of urinary and gastrointestinal tract
(cystoscopy, sigmoidoscopy)

Treatment
Is directed to the underlying cause, eg:
• Atrophic vaginitis: topical oestrogens (see b ‘Hormone replacement
therapy and the menopause’, p.448).
• HRT: used if topical oestrogens fail. Review the balance of risks
and beneﬁts and consider stopping the drug. Consider change of
preparation eg reduction of oestrogen dose, increase in progestogen
dose
• Endometrial carcinoma: total abdominal hysterectomy and
bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and/or radiotherapy are the
usual interventions. In those unﬁt for surgery, progestogens
(eg medroxyprogesterone) may control the tumour

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Vaginal prolapse
A prolapse is a protrusion into the vagina by a pelvic organ (bladder,
bowel, or uterus) caused by:
• Weakness of pelvic connective tissue and musculature due to
cumulative effects of childbirth trauma, ageing, and oestrogen
deﬁciency
• Increased abdominal pressure, eg constipation, obesity, and coughing.
Depending on which structures are weak, the following may be seen
(Fig. 19.1):
• Cystocoele: the bladder protrudes through the anterior vaginal wall
• Rectocoele: the rectum protrudes through the posterior vaginal wall
• Enterocoele: herniation of peritoneum and small bowel (the pouch of
Douglas), through the posterior vaginal wall
• Uterine prolapse: descent of the cervix and uterus down the vagina
• 1st degree: cervix lies within the vagina
• 2nd degree: cervix protrudes from the vagina on standing/straining
• 3rd degree (procidentia): cervix lies outside the vagina

Assessment
Often asymptomatic. Most commonly there is a sensation of heaviness,
fullness or bearing down, a palpable mass or a dull pelvic or back ache.
Symptoms may be abolished by lying down.
• Cystocoele may cause stress or overﬂow urinary incontinence, urinary
tract infection, or bladder outﬂow obstruction
• Rectocoele may cause faecal incontinence or difﬁculty in defaecation—
manual evacuation or digital reduction of the prolapse may be needed
• Enterocoele causes pelvic fullness and discomfort
• Third degree uterine prolapse may cause ulceration and bleeding, and
bladder symptoms eg difﬁculty in urinating
Examination should include an abdominal and pelvic assessment (see b
‘HOW TO . . . Examine the older female genital system’, p.509).

Treatment
This is dictated by symptoms, prolapse severity, the organs involved,
general ﬁtness, and patient preference. Urodynamic testing and imaging
may be needed prior to treatment.
• Mild symptoms: topical oestrogen cream and pelvic ﬂoor exercises
• Moderate or severe symptoms: pessary or surgery
• Surgery is now generally well tolerated and effective. Usually via
a transvaginal approach, weakened structures of the pelvic ﬂoor
are strengthened and ﬁxed in place. Hysterectomy is sometimes
necessary.
• Pessaries—ﬁtting of a pessary is indicated for reasons of patient
preference, when the risks of surgery are unfavourable, and as a
temporary measure prior to surgery. They come in many shapes
and sizes, but the most commonly used is the ring pessary. An
oestrogen releasing ring pessary is available. Other shapes may
be used, commonly for severe disease, but can be difﬁcult to insert
and remove.

VAGINAL PROLAPSE

HOW TO . . . Care for a vaginal pessary
Every 4–6 months:
• Remove and clean the pessary
• Examine the vagina for evidence of ulceration
• Replace a damaged pessary
• Reinsert if all is well
Complications
• If vaginal ulceration occurs, the pessary should be removed for
several weeks, until complete healing has occurred. Local oestrogen
creams assist healing and may prevent recurrent ulceration. Try a
different shape or size of pessary
• Pessaries can embed in inﬂamed vaginal mucosa and become stuck.
Topical oestrogens and treatment of infection (eg Candida) may
reduce inﬂammation and assist removal. If the pessary remains stuck,
refer for specialist gynaecological assessment

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Vulval disorders
Most non-malignant vulval disorders are worsened by local irritants (eg
soap, deodorant, perfume) and improve if avoided. Good perineal hygiene
also helps, eg wiping front-to-back after urination or defecation, keeping
the area dry and wearing loose-ﬁtting non-synthetic clothing.

Vulvitis
Symptoms
Itching, discharge, burning discomfort.
Causes
These include:
• Candida (‘thrush’). The most common cause, especially in diabetes and
obesity. Vaginal infection almost always coexists
• Local dermatitis. Often exacerbated by soap and deodorants
• Sexually transmitted pathogens. Uncommonly, eg chlamydia
Treatment
• Treat candidiasis with antifungal cream to the vulva (eg clotrimazole
1% cream) and pessaries or cream inserted high into the vagina
(eg clotrimazole 200mg pessary daily for 3 days). Single-dose
pessaries (eg clotrimazole 500mg pessary once) are effective and may
be better tolerated. Oral treatment is also effective, eg ﬂuconazole
150mg once
• Treat irritant dermatitis by removing the cause and regular application
of topical steroid cream (eg hydrocortisone 1%) for 7–14 days
• Recurrent candidal infection is common, especially in diabetes and in
those receiving repeated antibiotics. Consider longer-term treatment,
eg weekly clotrimazole (500mg pessary) or ﬂuconazole (100mg po)
• If vulval itch persists without obvious cause consider systemic disease
eg iron deﬁciency, thyroid disorders. Use emollients and low potency
topical steroid to break the itch-scratch-itch cycle. Antihistamines are
not effective (see b ‘Pruritus’, p.596)

Vulvodynia
A chronic pain syndrome manifesting as burning, pain, or tenderness of the
vulva. There are often psychological contributors. Infection, dermatitis, and
epithelial disorders (neoplastic and non-neoplastic) should be excluded.
Refer for specialist assessment, and consider treating depression and
empirical treatment with topical steroids or oestrogens.

Non-neoplastic epithelial disorders
Lichen sclerosus
Common in middle aged and older women. Asymptomatic or else causes
itching or soreness or dyspareunia. Seen as white or pink/purple macules or
papules resembling thin parchment paper and often in a ﬁgure-of-eight distribution around the vulva. Biopsy to exclude neoplasia. Treat with potent
topical steroids, tapering the potency and frequency as symptoms improve.
Progression to carcinoma can occur. Long-term follow-up is sensible.

VULVAL DISORDERS

Squamous hyperplasia
Raised white keratinized lesions that may be very localized. Biopsy may be
needed to exclude malignancy. Treat with medium potency topical steroids,
tapering to a stop as symptoms improve.
Other disorders
For example, psoriasis and chronic dermatitis can usually be diagnosed
clinically, but biopsy permits more conﬁdent management.

Malignant epithelial disorders
Vulval cancer
• Easily treated in its early stages and often preceded by a pre-malignant
stage
• Late presentation is more common with age
• Commonly asymptomatic and an incidental ﬁnding, but may itch,
discharge, bleed, or cause pain
• Appearance is variable—may be raised or ulcerated, or else appear
as white or coloured macules. If in any doubt that a lesion may be
malignant or pre-malignant, then refer for biopsy
• Treatment depends on the size and invasiveness of the tumour, the
presence or absence of metastases, and the condition of the patient
• Options include topical cytotoxic creams, resection under local
anaesthesia, wide local excision, or radical vulvectomy
• Extensive vulval surgery is relatively well tolerated in older people
2If any vulval lesion does not respond as expected to treatment,
re-consider the possibility of malignancy.

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

Sexual function
Studies show that most older people desire some sexual contact.
However, the frequency of sexual intercourse, both penetrative and nonpenetrative, falls with age. This decline is multifactorial, including:
• Lack of partner, eg death of spouse
• Physiological changes of ageing, eg decreased vaginal secretions, less
sustained penile erections
• Physical comorbidity and medication, eg circulatory disease, B-blockers
• Psychological comorbidity, eg low self-esteem, depression
• Societal expectations and judgements
• Lack of privacy, especially in institutional care
The clinical response to a patient’s report of sexual dysfunction involves
addressing each of these factors in a supportive and understanding way.

Erectile dysfunction
Erection requires intact neurological, circulatory, hormonal, and psychological processes. In older people, several factors more commonly contribute to erectile dysfunction or impotence. A solely psychological cause
is uncommon. Common contributors are drugs, vascular disease (arterial >
venous) and neurological disease (stroke, autonomic neuropathy, local
surgery, eg prostatectomy)
History
Assess onset and progression, circumstances, and associated psychological issues. Erectile dysfunction is common, yet is rarely asked about.
Older men may volunteer the symptom, but many will accept it as part of
‘normal ageing’. Do not assume that an older man is not sexually active,
and always warn about impotence as a potential side effect of relevant
drugs.
Drugs causing erectile dysfunction
Along with vascular disease, drugs are the most common cause in older
people:
• Antihypertensives (especially B-blockers and diuretics. ACE inhibitors
less so)
• Alcohol
• Antiandrogens, LHRH agonists, oestrogens, progestogens
• Antidepressants (all classes, except trazodone)
• Less commonly: cimetidine, spironolactone
Examination
Of mental state (depression, anxiety). Presence of secondary sexual characteristics. Vascular disease. Genitourinary examination. Neurological
examination to include perineal and perianal sensation.

SEXUAL FUNCTION

Investigation
Exclude systemic illness with FBC, U,C+E, and glucose. Diagnostic tests
to determine an underlying cause of erectile dysfunction do not often
alter management and are rarely performed. Hypogonadism is an
uncommon cause of erectile dysfunction, so checking testosterone level
is not usually necessary. If libido (rather than erectile dysfunction) is the
problem, then exclude hypogonadism by checking testosterone, LH, TSH,
and prolactin.
Treatment
Where possible, stop incriminated drugs. Treat underlying disease,
including anxiety/depression. Recently developed drug treatments are
highly effective.
Phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitors
For example, sildenaﬁl. Cause smooth muscle relaxation and increase
blood ﬂow, they are easily used (take po before intercourse), effective,
and safe. Contraindications include patients on nitrates; exercise caution
in those with coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Side effects are gastrointestinal and vascular (ﬂushing, headache).
Alprostadil (prostaglandin E1)
Is usually given as an intraurethral pellet, is absorbed locally and causes
local smooth muscle relaxation, There is no signiﬁcant systemic absorption, so systemic side effects are rare and vascular disease is not a contraindication.
Other options
Include intracavernosal injections (the most effective treatment) and nondrug options such as vacuum devices (effective, but often discontinued
due to discomfort).

Hypersexuality
• Sexually disinhibited behaviours may occur in people with dementia
and frontal lobe pathology, eg stroke. It can present practical and
ethical problems to the caregiver. Assessment of the behaviours,
the contexts in which they arise and any possible risk is essential.
Environmental modiﬁcation and carer education is needed. Medication
may help (eg antipsychotics) but none are licensed
• A small proportion of patients with Parkinson’s disease (particularly
if treated with dopamine agonists) may develop impulse control
disorders which can include hypersexuality

CHAPTER 19

Genitourinary medicine

HIV in older people
Prevalence
• Increasing in the over-50s
• UK study in 2010 indicated that HIV infections diagnosed in the >50s
had more than doubled over 7 years

Reasons for this include
• Prolonged survival on antiretroviral therapy
• Wider scope of HIV testing
• Increased transmission due to decreased awareness of HIV in older
adults

Risk factors
• Broadly similar to younger group except less likely to be due to iv drug
use
• In men, the biggest risk factor is homosexual intercourse. US data
looking at homosexual men >50 reveals less frequent sexual activity,
but still multiple partners (>9 in the last 12 months for 25%)
• In older women, heterosexual intercourse is the biggest risk factor.
They may be less likely to use barrier contraception as there are no
risks of conception. Also, age-related changes to the female genital
tract (eg atrophic vaginitis) may make transmission more likely

Testing
Delay in testing and diagnosis common (50% of >50s compared with 30%
of younger patients) because:
• Clinicians are less likely to suspect HIV infection in older patients
• Patients may mistake early symptoms for other age related disorders
and not seek help
2It is important to take a sexual history and bear the diagnosis in mind
as for younger patients, particularly if there is an opportunistic infection
such as TB.

Clinical features
In older patients:
• Mortality is higher, although this may relate to delayed diagnosis—in
one study, 75% of those over 50 diagnosed with HIV/AIDS were dead
within a year
• Antiretroviral therapy has equivalent efﬁcacy as younger patients,
improves survival and drug concordance may be better
• Comorbidity more common causing greater overall disability and
possible problems with drug treatments
• There may be an increased risk of HIV-associated dementia, although
studies are small
• Risk of cardiovascular disease is high—may be effect of the HIV or the
antiretrovirals, plus accumulation of other risk factors (hypertension,
smoking, high cholesterol, etc.)

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

Urinary incontinence: causes
2Incontinence has a major adverse impact on quality of life and has signiﬁcant associated morbidity (it may be the last straw leading to institutionalization). Even longstanding cases may be reversible so always explore
continence issues even if everyone else is complacent.
It is very common (around 30% of elderly at home, 50% in care homes)
but is not a natural consequence of ageing. Most incontinence in older
people is multifactorial, so think of all the possible contributing factors and
address each in turn. They can be divided as follows:

Age-related changes
Diminished total bladder capacity but increased residual volume
Diminished bladder contractile function
Increased frequency of uninhibited bladder contractions
Reduced ability to postpone voiding
Excretion of ﬂuid later in the day with less concentrated night-time
urine
• Atrophy of vagina and urethra in females
• Loss of pelvic ﬂoor and urethral sphincter musculature
• Hypertrophy of the prostate in males

•
•
•
•
•

Comorbidity
• Diminished mobility—may have an urge to urinate then not be able to
get to the toilet in time
• Prescribed medications affect lower urinary tract, conscious state (eg
sedatives) or ability to get promptly to the toilet (eg antihypertensives
causing postural drop)
• Increased constipation
• Impaired cognition— a continent person needs to be able to recognize
that they need to urinate, locate and reach a toilet, then undress in
time to pass urine in the right place. Confusion can cause inappropriate
micturition (initially failure to ﬁnd an appropriate receptacle, then in
later dementia they may be unaware altogether of urination). There
may also be interference with UMN input into continence pathways

Reversible factors
• UTI (see b ‘Urinary tract infection’, p.621)
• Delirium
• Drugs eg diuretics cause polyuria, anticholinergics such as tricyclics
cause retention, sedatives can reduce awareness or mobility
• Constipation—may cause voiding difﬁculty and increased residual
volumes in both sexes
• Polyuria (eg poorly controlled diabetes, hypercalcaemia, oedema
resorption at night can cause nocturnal polyuria, psychogenic
polydipsia)
• Urethral irritability (eg atrophic vaginitis, candida infection)
• Prolapse (women)
• Bladder stones and tumours

URINARY INCONTINENCE: CAUSES

Irreversible (but treatable) factors
• In males, prostatic hypertrophy or carcinoma causes outﬂow
obstruction, an unstable bladder or ‘overﬂow’ incontinence
• Overactive bladder syndrome (symptom diagnosis)/detrusor
overactivity (urodynamic diagnosis)—spontaneous contractions of the
bladder muscle causes urgency and frequency ± incontinence
• In females, outlet incompetence (stress incontinence)—usually due
to pelvic muscle and ligament laxity (which supports the urethra)
following childbirth—any rise in intra-abdominal pressure causes small
leaks eg with cough, hoisting
• Mixed symptoms—suggesting the presence of both overactivity and
stress incontinence
• Fistula (connection between the bladder and vagina) can occur after
pelvic malignancy and irradiation, causing constant wetness

Environmental factors
• Being bed bound and reliant on assistance with toileting makes
continence a challenge. Whilst nurses will endeavour to promptly
attend to a request for toileting, there is an inevitable delay
• In males with reduced mobility, a lack of manual dexterity and/or small
penile size can make the use of bottles a challenge
• In hospitals, the toilet may be further away than at home, or difﬁcult to
ﬁnd. In addition, the acute illness may mean that mobilizing is difﬁcult
• At home, access to a toilet may become harder with reducing mobility
(eg if there is only an upstairs toilet)

533

534

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

Urinary incontinence: assessment
Much is made in the literature of the different symptoms in different diagnostic groups.
• Urgency symptoms Frequent (>8 times per day) and/or precipitant
voiding— strong urge, and decreased time to reach the toilet. If
incontinence occurs this is termed wet overactive bladder (OAB). Urge
alone whilst maintaining continence is dry OAB and may be a precursor
to the wet form. Nocturnal incontinence common. Urge symptoms
are commonly due to detrusor muscle overactivity where the residual
volume small, but can also occur in obstruction
• Stress symptoms Small volume leaks during coughing, laughing, lifting,
walking and other exercise. Often coexist with urge symptoms in
women
• Obstructive symptoms in men include decreased force of urinary stream,
hesitancy, and intermittent ﬂow
Older patients are often unable to give precise descriptions and the different symptom complexes can overlap. Even where a ‘pure’ symptom
complex exists you may get the diagnosis wrong, eg prostatic outﬂow
symptoms where incontinence is actually detrusor overactivity or symptoms of urgency as a presentation for retention with overﬂow. Additional
factors such as reduced mobility, dexterity, and cognition also interact to
produce the syndrome of incontinence.
A more pragmatic approach is often required.
• Take a history—a bladder or voiding diary can help, especially if you are
relying on carers for information. Ask questions such as:
• ‘Do you know when you need to go to pass urine?’
• ‘Do you get much time between getting the urge and when the
urine comes?’
• ‘Do you sometimes leak urine when you cough or run?’
• Examination—include vaginal, rectal, and neurological examination
• Exclude a signiﬁcant residual volume See Box 20.1
• Investigations—urinalysis and midstream urine (MSU), general screening
blood tests, cytology and cystoscopy if haematuria. Urodynamics can
be helpful if patient’s incontinence cannot be explained or they are
not responding to treatment and essential if surgical intervention is
contemplated

URINARY INCONTINENCE: ASSESSMENT

Box 20.1 Residual volume
Normal young people have only a few mL of urine post-micturition but
normal elderly can have up to 100mL.
Causes of raised residual volume include:
• Prostatic hypertrophy, carcinoma
• Urethral stricture
• Bladder diverticulum
• Large urinary cystocele and other pelvic organ prolapsed (females)
• Hypocontractile detrusor
• Neurological disease eg Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, spinal
cord disease, disc herniation
• Bladder tumour
• Drugs eg tricyclic antidepressants, anticholinergics
Acute retention is usually painful but can present atypically with delirium,
renal failure etc.
Chronic bladder distention is usually painless, presenting with infection,
abdominal distension/mass or incontinence (continuous dribbling due to
overﬂow or urge incontinence due to detrusor instability).
Persistently elevated residual volume increases the risk of infection.
If pressure is elevated this can cause dilation of the urinary tract and
eventually hydronephrosis and renal failure.
Residual volume can easily be estimated using a simple ultrasound
bladder scan or a diagnostic (in/out) catheterization.

Bladder diaries
It is helpful to ask patients and/or carers to complete a bladder diary to
aid assessment. This should include the timing and volume of all urine
voided along with details of any symptoms and episodes of incontinence.
An example is shown in Table 20.1.
Analysis of this will allow correct assessment of:
• 24-hr urine volume
• Number and severity of incontinence episodes
• Maximum and minimum voided volume
• Diurnal variation

Urinary incontinence: management
• Depends on cause so try to make a diagnosis ﬁrst.
• Incontinence is multifactorial in most elderly so combining treatments
may be necessary eg a man with obstructive prostatic symptoms and
detrusor hyperactivity may beneﬁt from an A-blocker and an antimuscarinic (eg tolterodine) (Table 20.2).

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

Catheters
A catheter is indicated for:
• Symptomatic urinary retention
• Obstructed outﬂow associated with deteriorating renal function or
hydronephrosis
• Acute renal failure for accurate urine output monitoring
• Intensive care settings
• Sacral pressure sores with incontinence
• Where other methods of bladder management cause undue distress to
a frail older person
• Occasionally to facilitate discharge home by reducing care needs
(especially overnight) where non-catheter options have failed
2A catheter is NOT usually indicated for:
• Immobility—even from stroke
• Heart failure—just because you are giving furosemide
• Monitoring ﬂuid balance in a continent patient
• Convenience of nursing—at home or in hospital
• Asymptomatic chronic retention—refer to urology for assessment

Catheter selection
• Long-term catheters should be either silicone, Silastic, or silverimpregnated (expensive but reportedly fewer blockages and infections)
• Catheter size should be as small as practical
• Catheters should be changed at least every 3 months
• Consider the use of a catheter valve (like a beer keg tap) rather than a
drainage bag
• If duration is likely to be more than a year, consider suprapubic
placement to preserve urethral sphincter function

CATHETERS

HOW TO . . . Manage urinary incontinence without a
catheter
In spite of correct diagnosis, investigation and treatment of reversible
causes there will still be patients who will be permanently or intermittently incontinent of urine.
2An indwelling catheter is not always the best solution. They have
been shown to increase morbidity (infection, stones, urethral erosion)
and even mortality.
Suggesting that catheters are removed is one of a geriatrician’s
most important jobs in post-acute care. If in doubt involve a specialist
continence nurse/team.
Other options for continence management include:
• Environmental modiﬁcations: urinals/commodes by the bed, easy
access clothing, etc. can minimize or prevent accidents
• Regular or individualized toileting programmes: this can be very
successful in patients with dementia but is labour intensive
• Pad and pants: can be very effective but is quite labour intensive for
very immobile patients
• A drainage sheath or condom catheter (Conveen® is a manufacturer) for
men: like a catheter but held onto the penis with a plastic sheath like a
condom. Particularly useful for isolated nocturnal incontinence as it can
be removed by day. Main problem is displacement and leakage which
can be a problem with small or unusually shaped penises
• Intermittent catheterization: for those with obstruction or atonic
bladders. Consider in agile, cognitively intact patients. Can be
supported by district nursing services

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

HOW TO . . . Treat catheter complications
Blocked catheters
• Consider possibility of stones, infection, sediment, encrustation,
constipation or bladder tumour
• Renew catheter and change if necessary
• Maintain good ﬂuid intake
• Catheter maintenance solution can be used for short periods
• Blockage due to sediment can be prevented with regular saline
bladder washouts
• Catheter encrustation occurs with Proteus infection; acidic irrigations
instilled into the bladder may dissolve these (eg Suby G®)
‘Bypassing’
• Catheters can irritate bladder causing contractions—resulting leak of
urine past catheter can render them useless and occasionally causes
very painful spasms
• This is particularly common where detrusor overactivity was cause of
incontinence
• Can be induced or aggravated by infection
• Exclude catheter blockage (presents with identical spasms and leaks)
• If no residual volume, reduce catheter diameter/balloon size
• Antimuscarinic drugs can sometimes help
• Longer-term catheters can cause urethral sphincter incompetence,
so urine will leak continuously. This may be temporarily helped by
passing a larger gauge catheter but is a difﬁcult problem to manage—
avoid by using suprapubic catheters earlier
Catheter infections
• All catheters become colonized after a few days, all catheter urine
will dipstick positive, and most catheter specimens of urine will grow
bacteria
2This alone is not an indication for antibiotics
• Bad smelling, dark coloured, and cloudy urine is more commonly due
to dehydration and is not an indication for antibiotics per se
• There are now some trials of cranberry juice/capsules that suggest
there is a minor effect on reducing recurrent infections
• Only treat clinically signiﬁcant infections (fever, malaise, delirium,
pain, abnormal inﬂammatory markers, etc.) or you will just promote
resistant organisms
• If you believe a catheter is a source of signiﬁcant infection:
• Send a catheter specimen of urine to guide antibiotic choice
• Remove the catheter where possible (even if only for 48hr). If
not possible change catheter with a single shot of im gentamicin
80–120mg
• Ensure adequate hydration
• Choose a narrow spectrum antibiotic if sensitivities allow
• For repeated signiﬁcant infection consider if the catheter is really
necessary. Low-dose continuous antibiotic prophylaxis are advocated
by some but there is little evidence

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

Faecal incontinence: causes
Deﬁned as the involuntary passage of faeces in inappropriate circumstances. The importance of situational factors mean there is potential for
anyone to be incontinent in some circumstances.
• Incontinence of faeces is always abnormal, and often curable
• It is much less common than urinary incontinence, but more distressing
• There is gross under-referral for diagnosis and treatment
• Prevalence—10% of care home residents incontinent at least once per
week

Continence mechanisms
• The sigmo-rectal ‘sphincter’—the rectum is usually empty. Passage of
faeces into the rectum initiates rectal contraction (and anal relaxation),
normally temporarily inhibited. The acute angle in the pelvic loop of
the sigmoid may be important in causing temporary holdup
• The ano-rectal angle—the pubo-rectalis sling maintains an acute angle
between rectum and anus, preventing passage of stool into the anal
canal
• The anal sphincters—the external sphincter (striated, voluntary muscle),
the internal sphincter (smooth muscle), and the anal vascular cushions
which complete the seal
• Ano-rectal sensation—sensation in the anus and rectum is usually
sufﬁciently accurate to distinguish gas from faeces, permitting the
passage of ﬂatus without incontinence. Good sensation may be
particularly important when diarrhoea is present

Causes of faecal incontinence
• Disorders of the anal sphincter and lower rectum: sphincter laxity
(from many causes), severe haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, tumours,
constipation
• Any cause of faecal urgency (occasionally associated with reduced
mobility): constipation (with spurious diarrhoea), any cause of
diarrhoea (inﬂammatory bowel disease, drugs, etc.)
• Disorders of the neurological control of the ano-rectal muscle and
sphincter: LMN lesions (neuropathic incontinence), spinal cord lesions,
cognitive impairment (neurogenic incontinence)
The commonest cause (>50%) is faecal impaction. This is important
because 95% are curable. The second commonest cause is neurogenic
incontinence where the cure rate is still around 75%.

FAECAL INCONTINENCE: ASSESSMENT

Faecal incontinence: assessment
Most patients can be helped by asking a few questions and performing a
rectal examination.
Effective treatment is directed at the underlying cause so adequate
assessment is vital.

History
• The duration of symptoms is not helpful: impaction is just as common
in those who have been incontinent for more than 3 months as in
those in whom the incontinence is recent
• Having the bowels open regularly (eg every day) is usual in elderly
patients with impaction
• Complete constipation (not having the bowels open at all) is unusual in
impaction
• A feeling of rectal fullness with constant seepage of semi-liquid faeces is
almost diagnostic of impaction, but rectal carcinoma may also present
in this way
• The combination of urinary and faecal incontinence strongly suggests
impaction as the cause of both
• Soiling without the patient being aware of it suggests neuropathy

Examination
• Inspect the anus—and ask the patient to strain as if at stool. Look for
inﬂammation, deformities, large haemorrhoids (internal or external),
and prolapse
• Rectal examination—assess anal tone by the pressure on the ﬁnger
after asking the patient ‘tighten’, feel for faeces and tumour, it is easy to
miss even large internal haemorrhoids unless proctoscopy is performed
• Abdominal examination—feel for the descending colon. Work
proximally to assess colonic faecal loading (this may be misleading)
• Neurological examination—look for signs of a peripheral neuropathy,
and other neurological damage. Check perianal sensation (sacral
dermatomes). Include a mental status assessment if you think
neurogenic incontinence is likely

Investigation
A plain abdominal radiograph may be necessary to detect proximal faecal
loading of the colon (see b ‘Faecal incontinence: management’, p.544).
Investigation of the anal sphincter tone and neurological control of rectum
and anus is in the province of the proctologist and may occasionally be
needed for neuropathic incontinence.

543

CHAPTER 20

Incontinence

Faecal incontinence: management
The two common treatments in old age are for constipation and neurogenic incontinence. In addition specialist proctology clinics can perform
ano-rectal physiology assessment prior to the use of biofeedback techniques and surgery (even colostomy).

Treatment of constipation
Faecal impaction, faecal retention, faecal loading.
2In hospitalized older people, constipation is by far the commonest cause
of incontinence; assume that any incontinent patient is constipated until
proved otherwise and do not exclude it until after an adequate therapeutic trial of enemas for high faecal impaction.
See b ‘Constipation’, p.370 for deﬁnition, diagnosis, causes, prevention,
and treatment of constipation, and b ‘HOW TO . . . treat “overﬂow”
faecal incontinence’, p.545.

Mechanism
Passage of faeces from the sigmoid into the rectum (often soon after a
meal—the gastro-colic reﬂex) produces a sensation of rectal fullness, and
a desire to defecate. If this is ignored, the sensation gradually habituates,
and the rectum ﬁlls up with progressively harder faeces. At this stage,
some leakage past the anal sphincter (incontinence) is almost inevitable.
Impaction of hard faecal material produces partial obstruction, stasis,
irritation of the mucosa with excessive mucus production, and spurious
diarrhoea. Emptying the colon of faeces has two main effects: it prevents
spurious diarrhoea and therefore urgency and it permits normal colonic
motility and habit to be restored.

Treatment of neurogenic faecal incontinence
Loss of control of the intrinsic rectal contraction caused by passage of
normal faecal material from the sigmoid into the rectum results in the
involuntary passage of a normal, formed stool at infrequent intervals, and
usually at a timing characteristic of that patient (typically after breakfast).
It is a syndrome analogous with the uninhibited neurogenic bladder, and
usually only occurs in the context of severe dementia. However, note that
incontinence in demented patients is commonly due to constipation. The
diagnosis is therefore usually made in a severely demented patient with a
characteristic history after excluding the other common causes.
Since the diagnosis is usually one of exclusion, it is reasonable to treat
most patients as though they have impaction, particularly if you cannot
exclude high impaction by radiology. Once impaction has been excluded,
there are three strategies:
• In patients with a regular habit, toileting at the appropriate time
(perhaps with the aid of a suppository) may be successful. This requires
an attendant who knows the patient well
• Arrange for a planned evacuation to suit the carers, by administering a
constipating agent (eg loperamide 2mg od) combined with a phosphate
enema two or three times weekly
• If the patient has no regular habit and refuses enemas, the situation may
have to be accepted and suitable protective clothing provided

FAECAL INCONTINENCE: MANAGEMENT

HOW TO . . . Treat ‘overﬂow’ faecal incontinence
• General—rehydration (possibly iv), regular meals, and help with
toileting are important
• Enemas—eg phosphate enema given once or (occasionally) twice
daily. Continue until there is no result, the rectum is found to be
empty on DRE and the colon is impalpable abdominally. This may
take a week or more
• Complete colonic washout—eg using bowel prep such as Picolax®.
This is rather an extreme method but is sometimes required. Ensure
the patient is well hydrated before you start
• Manual evacuation of faeces—can cause further damage to the anal
sphincters and is almost never necessary
• Laxatives—generally less effective than enemas but can be used in
addition, for milder cases and in the very frail. If the stool is hard use
a stool softening laxative such as lactulose (20mL/day)—stimulant
laxatives (eg senna) may produce severe pain. Stimulant laxatives
or suppositories may be appropriate for those with soft faecal
overloading. A combination of stool softener and stimulant are
sometimes used. While extra ﬁbre is useful in prophylaxis, stool
bulking agents such as methylcellulose are of limited value in treating
constipation as they increase the volume of stool being passed and
may increase your problems
2After treatment, think prevention (see b ‘Constipation’, p.370).
If, despite these measures, a patient has impaction for a second time
(without an obvious and removable cause) then regular (say once
or twice weekly) enemas should be prescribed. Progress can only
be satisfactorily monitored by examining the patient abdominally and
rectally.

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Deafness and the ageing ear
Deafness is a common, debilitating complaint that increases with age. 6%
of adults, 33% of retired people and 80% of octogenarians in the UK have
impaired hearing. Deafness is often ignored (‘part of getting older’) yet it
prevents communication, causes social isolation, anxiety, depression, and
can contribute to functional decline.
Around half of sufferers could be helped by a hearing aid, yet less than
a quarter have one. Generally patients with unilateral, mild bilateral, or
profound bilateral deafness do not beneﬁt from conventional hearing aids.
2Be alert to hearing loss. A quick assessment directs appropriate referral
to audiology or ENT when necessary.

Normal ageing
Presbyacusis
• Describes the decline in hearing that commonly occurs with age—
‘degenerative deafness’
• Males > females
• Usually detectable from age 60–65
• Both the sensory peripheral (cochlea) and central (neural) components
of the auditory system are affected with peripheral degeneration being
accountable for at least 2/3 of the clinical features of presbyacusis
• A variety of possible mechanisms exist—cellular degeneration gives
rise to a reduction in the numbers of hair cells particularly at the
basal end of the cochlea (the part responsible for high frequency
sound appreciation). Circulatory changes such as atherosclerosis,
microangiopathy, and atrophy of the stria vascularis contribute
• The relative contributions of ‘normal ageing’ and cumulative exposure
to noxious stimuli (noise, toxins, oxidative stresses, otological disease,
poor diet, vascular disease) are unclear, but not all older people have
hearing problems
• The high frequencies are lost ﬁrst—usually noticed when high-pitched
female voices become hard to hear. As consonants are high frequency,
the patient can often hear noise, but not understand, feeling that
everyone is ‘mumbling’ (loss of discrimination)
• ‘Recruitment’ is a common problem, where the thresholds for hearing
and discomfort are very close (‘Speak up . . . don’t shout’)
• Busy, noisy environments make hearing harder, so patients may avoid
social situations
• There is no treatment to halt progression, but hearing aids may help
Other ear changes with age
These include:
• Thinner walls to the external auditory canal, with fewer glands, making
it dry and itchy
• Drier wax due to decreased sweat gland activity, making accumulation
(a cause of reversible hearing impairment) more common
• Degenerative changes of the inner ear and vestibular system
contributing to increase in deafness, vertigo, and tinnitus

DEAFNESS AND THE AGEING EAR

Classifying deafness
Conductive
A disturbance in the mechanical attenuation of sound waves in outer/
middle ear, preventing sound from reaching the inner ear.
• It can be caused by outer ear obstruction (eg wax, foreign body,
otitis externa), some types of tympanic membrane perforation,
tympanosclerosis, or middle ear problems (effusion, otosclerosis,
ossicular erosion secondary to infection or cholesteatoma)
• It may be surgically correctable, and can be helped by a hearing aid
Sensorineural
A problem with the cochlea or auditory nerve so impulses are not transmitted to the auditory cortex.
• Caused by genetic or perinatal factors in children
• In adults may be traumatic, infective (viral, chronic otitis media,
meningitis, syphilis), noise induced, degenerative (presbyacusis),
ototoxic (eg aminoglycosides, cytotoxics), neoplastic (acoustic
neuroma) or others such as Ménière’s disease
• Usually irreversible
• The appropriate hearing aid can be helpful
• Cochlear implants can be considered in severe sensorineural deafness,
but seem less effective than in younger patients, perhaps due to
limitations in cerebral processing
Mixed
A combination of both conductive and sensorineural—probably the most
common cause in older people.

HOW TO . . . Communicate with a deaf person
• Ensure hearing aids are inserted correctly, turned on and have
working batteries
• Speak clearly and at a normal rate
• Use sentences, not one word answers—this gives contextual cues to
lip readers
• Increase volume, but do not shout
• Lower the pitch of the voice
• Minimize background noise
• Maximize face-to-face visual contact—look straight at the person,
and ensure there are not bright lights behind you that will dazzle
• Use visual cues when talking (eg hand gestures)
• Be patient—repeat things if asked, changing the sentence slightly if
possible
• If confusion arises, write things down—do not give up

549

550

CHAPTER 21

Ears

HOW TO . . . Assess hearing
General
Conversation will give an informal idea of hearing ability.
Clarify by performing free ﬁeld speech tests by asking the patient
to repeat words spoken in a whispered voice, conversation voice and
shouted at 60cm from the ear. The non-test ear is masked by pressing
the tragus backwards and rotating it with the index ﬁnger. Sit the patient
next to you so that lip reading is not possible.
History
• Rate of onset and progression (witnesses will often be more accurate
than patients)
• Unilateral or bilateral
• History of trauma, noise exposure or ear surgery
• Family history of hearing problems or hearing aid use
• History of ototoxic drugs, eg aminoglycoside antibiotics (gentamicin,
streptomycin, etc.) and high-dose furosemide
• Associated symptoms (pain, discharge, tinnitus, vertigo)
Examination
• External ear and canal (looking for wax, inﬂammation, discharge,
blood, abnormal growths, etc.)
• Drum (perforations, myringitis, retraction, bulging of drum, etc.)
• Tuning fork tests (with a 512kHz fork) may be helpful. Both are
based on the principle of improved bone conduction perception with
a conductive hearing loss
• Rinne’s—compares air and bone conduction. Hold tuning fork
in front of ear then place on mastoid, to compare air and bone
conduction. Air > bone is normal. Bone > air implies defective
middle and outer ear function
• Weber’s—assesses bone conduction only. Hold tuning fork at
vertex of the head and ask which ear hears the sound most loudly.
With conductive deafness, it is heard loudest in the deafer ear; with
sensorineural deafness it is heard most loudly in the normal ear
Who to refer?
Patients with sinister features should be referred to an ENT surgeon:
• Recent or abrupt hearing loss
• Unilateral hearing loss or tinnitus
• Variable hearing loss
• Ear pain
2Sudden onset sensorineural deafness is an ENT emergency, and
requires urgent referral (causes include infection, vascular event,
tumour, leaking canals, etc.)
ALL other patients with suspected hearing loss should be referred
routinely to an audiologist for further assessment and management.

AUDIOLOGY

Audiology
The majority of patients with hearing impairment are managed by audiologists and hearing therapists. They do the following.

Specialized hearing tests
• Audiometry—quantiﬁes the degree and pattern of loss. May be ‘pure
tone’ (using signals at varying frequencies and intensities) or ‘speech’
(discriminating spoken words at differing intensities). The hearing
thresholds are charted on an audiogram and interpreted by the
audiologist (indicates conduction or sensorineural deafness, which
frequency and which ear)
• Impedance tympanometry—indirectly measures the compliance of the
middle ear, identifying infection and effusion in the middle ear and
eustachian tube dysfunction
• Evoked response audiometry—measures action potentials produced by
sound. No conscious response is required by the patient and so tests
are less open to bias. (Before MRI, this was the main diagnostic test for
acoustic neuromas)

Recommend and ﬁt hearing aids
Many types. Help patients to have realistic expectations about their
hearing aids (rarely a ‘miracle cure’) and train them how to use them optimally (eg minimizing background noise). Programme digital hearing aids.

Offer practical advice
About assistive listening devices such as:
• Alternative signals—buzzers and ﬂashing lights instead of doorbell or
telephone ring; vibrating devices that attach to the wrist and alert the
wearer to environmental noises. Hearing dogs can also be used
• Television—subtitles, or devices that connect to the hearing aid allowing
the television signal to be ampliﬁed
• Telephones—with high/low volume control and ‘T’ settings that amplify
the telephone noise without the background noise
• Transmitter and receiver devices (infrared or FM radio wave) for use in
theatres, etc. with transmission from the sound source. The listener
can adjust the volume in their receiver
• Advise about better communication
Run aural rehabilitation programmes—age-matched group sessions that
help with adjustment to the sudden reintroduction of noise with a hearing
aid (after what is usually a gradual hearing loss), teach skills (eg blocking
out background noise, lip reading) and share practical tips (eg eating in a
booth at a restaurant to limit background noise).

Other
• Train people to lip read
• Help manage tinnitus
• Counsel about psychosocial implications of hearing impairment

551

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Hearing aids
The past decade has seen many advances in hearing aid technology and
performance. Modern hearing aids offer improved ﬁdelity, greater ampliﬁcation, and frequency-speciﬁc ampliﬁcation. Patients who have tried
hearing aids in the past and not found them beneﬁcial should be encouraged to try them again.

What do hearing aids do?
Generally consist of a microphone that gathers sound, an ampliﬁer that
increases the volume and a receiver that transmits ampliﬁed sound. Most
hearing aids also include circuitry that ﬁlters and processes sound prior to
ampliﬁcation.

Whom do they help?
• Help many to some degree, but not all
• Does not restore normal hearing—the wearer needs to learn to
interpret the new auditory input efﬁciently
• Conductive hearing loss is helped more than sensorineural loss

What are the different types?
Different sizes
• Smaller units (eg completely-in-the-canal devices) are cosmetically
more appealing and give good reception for mild—moderate hearing
loss, but are ﬁddly and expensive
• Medium-sized units (eg in-the-ear devices) are more visible, and have
more feedback, but can be used for worse hearing loss
• Larger units (eg behind-the-ear) provide the most ampliﬁcation and are
easier to handle, but suffer from feedback if the ear mould deforms
Monaural versus binaural—binaural hearing aids yield a subjective improvement in sound clarity, but monaural may be considered for unilateral loss.
Analogue devices
• Cheapest, with least processing of sound
• Set to hearing loss at the time of ﬁtting
• Audiologist adjusts ampliﬁcation and tonality settings at time of ﬁtting,
but these are then ﬁxed
• Patient can adjust the volume manually (turn the device volume up
when the noise is quiet, and down when it is loud)
Digitally programmable devices
• More expensive, with moderate sound processing
• Analogue circuit that can be adjusted at the time of ﬁtting by a
computer programme to best ﬁt the patient’s needs
• Automatic volume control

HEARING AIDS

Digital devices
• Most health authorities have projects underway to ﬁt digital hearing
aids for all new referrals and exchange old analogue aids. All but the
most expensive are funded by the NHS where clinically indicated, and
it is likely that a suitable device will be provided for most
• Most expensive, most advanced, with the highest amount of sound
processing
• Programmable with ﬂexible digital circuits that manipulate each sound
according to pitch and volume to give the clearest sound for that
individual
• Higher clarity of sound, less circuit noise, faster processing, and
automatic volume control
Disposable devices
• ‘One size ﬁts all’—actually ﬁt around 70% of patients
• Widely available, eg in pharmacies
• Not individually tailored, so less good
• No need for battery changes, low breakdown costs
• Last about 40 days, so expensive in the long term
Cochlear implants
• Unilateral cochlear implantation is recommended as an option for
people with severe to profound deafness who do not receive adequate
beneﬁt from acoustic hearing aids
• Requires MDT assessment prior to insertion
• Simultaneous bilateral implants may be considered where there is
coexistent blindness, making the patient more reliant on aural input

553

554

CHAPTER 21

Ears

HOW TO . . . Use a hearing aid
To check a hearing aid
• Put a new battery in
• Turn to the ‘M’ setting
• Turn the volume up as far as it will go
• A working hearing aid will whistle
Putting it in
• The audiologist will take an impression of the ear to make an ear
mould that ﬁts snugly
• This should be inserted so that it ﬁts correctly and comfortably
Turning it on
• Most hearing aids have three settings: ‘O’ = off; ‘M’ = microphone
(use this setting for normal conversation); ‘T’ = telecoil (use this
setting with listening equipment, such as loop devices. These transfer
sound direct to the hearing aid and cut out background noise)
• In addition, there will often be a volume wheel, which can be
adjusted as needed
What to do if there is no sound
• Check the hearing aid is not switched to ‘O’ or ‘T’
• Check the batteries are not dead, or put in upside down
• Check the mould is not clogged with wax
• Check the tubing is not wet (dry with hairdryer) or twisted
What to do if there is a whistling or squealing noise (feedback)
• Occurs when the ear mould is not snug, allowing sound to escape
into the microphone
• Worse at high volumes
• Check that the ear mould is a good ﬁt (return to audiologist if not),
and is inserted correctly
• Ensure there is not excess earwax impeding ﬁt
• Try turning the volume down
Maintaining the hearing aid
• Handle carefully
• Keep the hearing aid dry, away from strong heat or light
• Use a clean dry tissue to clean, never a damp cloth
• Use wax remover on a regular basis
If the ear mould is separate (eg behind-the-ear) then periodically remove
and wash with warm soapy water, ensuring it is totally dry before
reconnecting it.

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Tinnitus
The perception of a sound in one or both ears, without an external stimulus. Intermittent or continuous. Varying kinds of noises (ringing, humming,
buzzing, occasionally other noises) and at varying pitches. Large spectrum
of disease. More common in men than women and incidence rises with
age. Up to a quarter of older people may experience intermittent symptoms. About a sixth of these will ﬁnd it bothersome, and 1:20 will be disabled by it. A quarter of patients will get worsening symptoms with time.
Tinnitus can be due to actual sounds that are generated by local
structures:
• Vascular structures (aneurysmal vessels, vascular tumours, etc.—
generate a pulsatile or humming noise that may worsen with exercise)
• Muscle spasms (palatal or middle ear muscles—generate a clicking
noise. Usually indicates underlying neurological disease)
• Eustachian tube may be patulous (can occur after dramatic weight loss)
resulting in a roaring sound
• Joints (eg temporomandibular joint, cervical spine joints)
More commonly, the noise is generated from somewhere within the
auditory pathway (cochlear organ, nerve, brain stem or auditory cortex)
after some sort of damage or injury. The following are associated with
tinnitus:
• Hearing loss—a very common cause in older people. Mechanism
unclear—may be akin to phantom limb pain. Note tinnitus may
precede deafness. May be associated with conductive (eg wax
accumulation) or more commonly sensorineural deafness (including
presbyacusis). Treatment of deafness (with hearing aid or occasionally
cochlear implant) often results in improvement of tinnitus
• Drugs—many commonly prescribed drugs in older people can either
cause or exacerbate tinnitus (see Box 21.1)
• Vascular disease—microvascular damage to the auditory system, or a
stroke affecting the auditory cortex. Modify vascular risk factors to limit
progression
• Infection—eg chronic otitis media. Treat the cause, but may have
residual problems
• Other—Ménière’s disease, diabetes, thyroid disease, Paget’s disease,
brain tumour (intracanalicular and cerebello-pontine), trauma, and
autoimmune disease. Treat underlying cause

History
• Obtain a description of tinnitus. This may indicate cause, eg pulsatile
noise is often vascular; clicking noise is often due to palatal muscle
spasms; high-pitched continuous noise is usually due to sensorineural
hearing loss; low-pitched continuous noise is more commonly seen
(but not exclusive to Ménière’s disease)
• Screen for possible causes (drug history, ear disease, noise exposure,
injury etc.)

Examination
Should include full head and neck examination, cranial nerve examination,
auscultation for bruits and inspection of the auditory canal.

TINNITUS

Investigation
Check FBC, glucose, and thyroid function. Refer to specialist for full audiometric assessment and possible imaging especially if unilateral (MRI ±
angiography).

Treatment
• Difﬁcult and frustrating—often best done in specialist clinics with
multidisciplinary team support
• Stop all ototoxic medication and avoid in future
• Assess whether caffeine, aspartame sweetener, alcohol, nicotine and
marijuana worsen tinnitus and avoid if so
• Treat the cause wherever possible
• Strong association with insomnia and depression, both of which
worsen the suffering and should be treated. Some evidence to suggest
that antidepressants (SSRIs) may help even when there is no overt
depression
• Many other treatments have been tried (eg lidocaine, magnetic and
ultrasonic stimulation, melatonin, Ginkgo biloba, niacin, and zinc) but
limited evidence they work and adverse effects common
• Hearing aids are useful if hearing loss—the increased awareness of the
background sound tends to make the noise less apparent
• Masking techniques involve wearing a ‘white noise’ generator, rather
like a hearing aid that aims to distract the patient from the tinnitus
by reducing the contrast between the tinnitus signal and background
noise, improving the plasticity of the central auditory cortex and
thereby facilitating a reduction in perception of the sound
• Mainstay of treatment is aimed at adjusting patients’ perception of the
tinnitus, trying to habituate them to the noise and limiting the negative
emotions it generates. Includes tinnitus retraining therapy, biofeedback,
stress reduction techniques and cognitive and behavioural therapy
• Tinnitus support groups can be helpful (M www.tinnitus.org.uk)

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Vertigo
Deﬁnition
Vertigo is the hallucination of movement. A sensation of rotatory motion
either of the patient with respect to the environment (‘its like being on a
roundabout’), or the environment with respect to the patient (‘the room
is spinning’). The key element is a feeling of motion, without which a
clinical diagnosis of vertigo should not be made.

Understanding vertigo
The vestibular system comprises the temporal bone labyrinths (composed
of the semicircular canals, the saccule, and the utricle), the vestibular
nerve and the central vestibular structures in the brainstem. Normally,
there is a constant input from both ears updating the central structures
on head position. In the brainstem they are integrated with inputs from
the visual cortex and from proprioceptive receptors (most important are
neck and ankles).
Any interruption of this signal leads to an excess of information from
the good side, and so an acute feeling of dizziness and nausea (vertigo)
along with disruption of the vestibulo-ocular reﬂex (which will cause
nystagmus). This situation continues until either input is restored, or the
vestibular system adapts to the altered balance of signals.
Adaptation means that:
• Vertigo is not a chronic condition. Multiple recurrences may occur, but
a complaint of longstanding continuous dizziness is not vertigo.
• Vertigo rarely occurs with slowly progressive conditions (eg acoustic
neuroma) as adaptation occurs along the way
• All vertigo is made worse by head movement—if not, then seek an
alternative diagnosis
• The use of vestibular sedatives should be limited to the acute phase for
symptom relief only—prolonged use will delay adaptation.
2There is no indication for long-term use of prochlorperazine.

Causes (Table 21.1)
• Around half of all patients complaining of dizziness will have vertigo
(see b ‘Dizziness’, p.114)
• Over all ages, 80% of vertigo arises from peripheral structures (the
ears) and 20% from central structures (the brain)
• Peripheral vertigo is due to benign positional paroxysmal vertigo in up
to 50%
• Central vertigo is usually due to stroke
• The proportion of central vertigo increases with age, because of the
increased incidence of stroke

Benign
paroxysmal
positional
vertigo (BPPV)

Mild episodes lasting less than a minute, recurring
frequently over weeks to months

Calcium debris in
semicircular canal
Usually idiopathic
May be preceded by
minor head trauma

Resolves spontaneously but may recur
Epley’s manoeuvre may help (see b ‘HOW
TO . . . Perform Epley’s manoeuvre’, p.562)

Acute vestibular Acute onset of severe vertigo, lasting hours to days
Associated nausea, vomiting and postural instability
failure
Patient in bed, refuses to move head
(labyrinthitis)

Ischaemia of vestibular
apparatus, often
proceeded by a viral
respiratory tract
infection

High-dose steroids acutely may speed recovery
Treat with vestibular sedatives only while vomiting,
then allow adaptation to occur
May have recurrent (milder) episodes

Ménière’s
disease

Dilation of
endolymphatic space
in the canals—primary
cause still unknown

Symptomatic treatment of acute attacks
Betahistine is a labyrinthine vasodilator
Diuretics may reduce attack frequency
Surgical options include grommet insertion,
transtympanic gentamicin, endolymphatic
decompression and vestibular nerve sectioning

Recurrent episodes of violent vertigo, vomiting,
tinnitus, ear fullness (lasting up to 12hr) and
ﬂuctuating hearing loss

After stroke, slow improvement is normal, but often
residual defects
Modify vascular risk factors (see b ‘Vascular
secondary prevention’, p.308) to prevent recurrence
VERTIGO

Vertebrobasilar TIAs cause stuttering symptoms (see b
stroke
‘Vertebrobasilar insufﬁciency (VBI)’, p.117). Stroke will
cause abrupt onset, prolonged symptoms
Vertigo is most common symptom, usually associated
with other neurology (eg ataxia, diplopia, visual loss,
slurred speech, motor or sensory impairment)
Cerebellar stroke can cause vertigo alone

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Vertigo: assessment
History
• This is the most important diagnostic tool in vertigo, and should be
open questions with clariﬁcation
• Describe the dizziness—is it a sensation of movement of self or the
room (likely vertigo) or a light-headed feeling (less likely vertigo).
A non-speciﬁc description does not exclude vertigo
• Establish if likely peripheral (abrupt onset and cessation with nausea,
vomiting and tinnitus) or central (more prolonged, less severe, less
positional episodes. Usually with other neurological symptoms and
signs)
• Ask about onset, severity, duration, progression and recurrence to
narrow down cause (see Table 21.1)
• Ask about provoking factors—may be spontaneous, or brought on
by changes in middle ear pressure (sneezing, coughing) or head/
neck position (question carefully to distinguish this from orthostatic
symptoms)
• Ask about associated symptoms, eg tinnitus and hearing loss (is it
worse during an attack)
• Ask about predisposing factors, eg vascular risk factors, recent
infections, headache, ototoxic drugs, ear discharge, deafness,
tinnitus, etc.
• Ask about psychiatric symptoms (eg low mood)—these are rarely
offered spontaneously

Examination
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

General examination (including cardiovascular examination)
Postural blood pressure measurements
Neurological examination
Examine eye movements for pursuit and saccades. Abnormalities in a
patient with balance complaints suggests a cerebellar origin
Head and neck examination including otoscopy (to assess auditory
canals and tympanic membranes)
Gait assessment
Hearing test (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Assess hearing’, p.550)
Vestibular assessment (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Examine the vestibular
system’, p.561)

VERTIGO: ASSESSMENT

HOW TO . . . Examine the vestibular system
This is hard to do directly—it largely relies on testing the integrity of the
vestibulo-ocular reﬂex.
• Test eye movements with the head still, looking for nystagmus (the
eyes drift slowly towards the bad side, and the rapid correction phase
is towards the good side). Visual ﬁxation will suppress a peripheral
nystagmus, but not a central. Peripheral lesions cause horizontal
nystagmus in both eyes; central lesions cause nystagmus in any
direction that is more prolonged and severe
• Try to provoke vertigo and nystagmus by gently ﬂexing, extending,
rotating and laterally bending the cervical spine
• Check visual acuity with a Snellen chart both with the head still, and
with the patient slowly shaking their head. If acuity is >4 lines worse
with head shaking this suggests impairment
• Ask the patient to ﬁx gaze on the examiner’s nose, while the
examiner turns the head rapidly to one side or the other. The
patient should be able to keep gaze ﬁxed. If there is a peripheral
vestibular problem the gaze may drift during rotation to that side,
which is manifest by a catch-up saccade back to the point of ﬁxation.
When done properly this test has a better than 80% sensitivity and
speciﬁcity for vestibular hypofunction
• Ask the patient to shake their head, and then check for nystagmus—if
it is present, this implies unilateral impairment
• Nystagmus after 30sec of hyperventilation can be an indicator of a
vestibular schwannoma

Hallpike manoeuvre
•
•
•
•

•
•
•
•

Tests for BPPV (50–80% sensitive)
Sit the patient up, and stand behind them
Hold their head turned 45° to one side
Keep holding the head at this angle and rapidly lie the patient down
so the head is 30° below the level of the couch, looking down to the
ﬂoor (steps 1 and 2 of the Epley’s manoeuvre, see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Perform Epley’s manoeuvre’, p.562)
Ask about symptoms, while watching for nystagmus (towards the
ﬂoor)
BPPV can be diagnosed conﬁdently when the nystagmus is latent
(occurs after a few seconds), transient (stops after less than 30sec)
and fatiguable (lessens with repeat testing)
If any of these features are absent, the vertigo is likely to be due to
another cause
Repeat with the head turned in the other direction

561

562

CHAPTER 21

Ears

Vertigo: management
Some speciﬁc treatments depending on cause (see Table 21.1).
Symptomatic relief in the short term can be achieved with vestibular
sedatives:
• Anticholinergics (eg hyoscine patch 1mg/24hr)
• Antihistamines (eg cyclizine 50mg tds, cinnarizine 30mg tds)
• Phenothiazines—usually sedating (eg prochlorperazine 10mg tds)
• Benzodiazepines (eg diazepam) if unable to take anticholinergics
(asthma)
May also beneﬁt from antiemetics (eg metoclopramide, domperidone).
These drugs are not for long-term use, and rarely beneﬁcial in BPPV
as attacks are so short lived. Most vertigo will resolve with vestibular
adaptation, leaving only brief feelings of imbalance on rapid head turns.
Some however, will develop chronic dysfunction, in which case management is directed towards facilitating adaptation and development of
coping strategies—vestibular rehabilitation. This is done by physiotherapists or ENT specialist nurses and adopts a holistic approach. It involves
a series of habituating exercises performed regularly to enable adaptation via compensation to occur. In addition to vestibular rehabilitation,
consider spectacles to improve visual acuity, exercise to improve muscle
strength, and a walking stick to aid peripheral balance.
Speciﬁc manoeuvres (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Perform Epley’s manoeuvre’,
p.562) and exercises are used for BPPV.

HOW TO . . . Perform Epley’s manoeuvre
(See also Figs. 21.1–21.6.)
• Aims to clear debris from the posterior semicircular canal
• Requires the patient to be fairly ﬂexible
• Premedication with a vestibular sedative is advised in severely
affected patients
• Stand behind the patient, ﬁrmly holding the head between your
hands
• Make movements quickly and smoothly, holding each position for at
least 30sec
• The procedure takes approximately 3–5min
1. With the patient upright, turn the head 45° to the affected side
2. Lie the patient down, with the head still turned until they are
reclined beyond the horizontal (as in the Hallpike manoeuvre)
3. With the patient still reclined beyond horizontal, rotate the head
through 90°, with the face upwards
4. Keeping the head still, ask the patient to roll on to their side
5. Rotate the head so the patient is facing downwards
6. Keep the head at this angle, and raise the patient to sitting
position
7. Finally, rotate the head so it faces the midline with the neck ﬂexed
(looking forward, and downwards)

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

The ageing eye
Vision is a complex activity which involves eye function, cognition, reasoning, and memory. With increasing age the chance of visual impairment
increases because of:
• Changes due to senescence
• Changes due to cumulative exposure to environmental toxins
• Changes in associated functions (cognition, hearing, etc.)
• Increasing incidence of many eye diseases
Visual impairment is not inevitable—there is considerable diversity both
in visual decline and in compensatory adaptations. There is a tendency for
patients to blame failing vision on age, and so not to seek help. However
some changes may be age related (but corrective action may be available,
eg glasses) or else impairment may herald the onset of treatable disease.
Prompt identiﬁcation and treatment may make all the difference between
independence and dependence. Distinguishing what is ‘normal’ and when
to refer to a specialist is key.

Changes in vision with age
Visual acuity often decreases
• Multifactorial—changes in macula, lens, and cornea
• May be corrected (eg glasses)
• Consider eye disease if deterioration is rapid
Visual ﬁelds—peripheral vision less sensitive
• Although formal ﬁeld-testing normal—consider cerebrovascular
disease if distinct homonymous ﬁeld defect
• Multifactorial—pupil smaller, lens cloudier, and peripheral retina less
sensitive
Near vision decreases
• Accommodative power diminishes due to increasingly rigid lens
• Presbyopia (a lack of accommodation range) is part of normal ageing,
begins in middle age and can be corrected with glasses
Colour vision
• Retinal receptors unchanged
• Alterations in colour perception may relate to yellowing of the lens
altering the light reaching the retina
Light adaptation slower
• Rods and cones may be slower to react to changes in illumination, and
the pupil may let in less light, requiring brighter lighting for good vision
• Causes difﬁculty with night driving in particular
• Glare may be a problem as the lens, cornea, and vitreous become less
clear, and minute particles scatter light
Contrast sensitivity decreases
• Due to changes in cornea, lens, and retina
Floaters
• Due to aggregation of collagen ﬁbrils in vitreous
• Usually normal, but if sudden onset, or large quantity, may indicate
retinal detachment or vitreous haemorrhage

VISUAL IMPAIRMENT

Visual impairment
2.5% of the UK population has visual impairment not amenable to correction by glasses alone. There is considerable social and psychological
impact, yet it is underreported and optimal help is often not delivered.

Causes
(From blind registration data):
• Macular degeneration (49%)
• Glaucoma (15%)
• Diabetes (6%)
• Cardiovascular disease (5%)
83% of people who register are >65 years old. Low-vision clinics are available
in most hospitals.

Interventions
Include:
• Change glasses prescription (beneﬁts 10–20%)
• Explain the disease (often does not cause total blindness, eg with
macular degeneration; improve understanding of future)
• Psychological support (often combined with hearing loss in older
people—beware social withdrawal. Acknowledge problem, discuss
fears)
• Discuss blind registration
• In some cases, consider guide dogs and learning Braille
• Take speciﬁc history of certain activities and provide practical advice:
• Reading—what do they actually need to read? Advise about good
light, magniﬁers, large print books, photocopy recipes to larger size.
• Writing—use black pen on white paper, consider a Millard writing
frame or bold line paper, discuss speciﬁc tasks such as cheques and
pension books.
• Television—sitting closer, black and white sets may improve contrast
• Telling the time—talking watches and clocks
• Cooking—improving lighting in kitchen by removing net curtains,
tactile markers for cookers, electronic fullness indicators on cups
• Telephoning—large button telephones
• Social interaction—sit with back to the window to improve light on a
visitor’s face, discuss accessible holidays

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Blind registration
Done by ophthalmologists. Copy of the form goes to social services, GP
and the ofﬁce for national statistics.
Generally there is under-registration—probably due to stigma and a
sense that this is the end of the ﬁght, rather than the start of new help
and opportunity.

Deﬁnitions
• Partially sighted <6/60 in both eyes or reduced ﬁelds (eg homonymous
hemianopia)
• Blind need not mean no vision. Statutory deﬁnition is that the person
should be ‘so blind as to be unable to perform any work for which
eyesight is essential’. Pragmatically it is vision <3/60 or very diminished
ﬁelds

Beneﬁts to individual
• Financial—including personal income tax allowance, disability living
allowance or attendance allowance, working tax credit or pension
credit, extra housing or council tax beneﬁts, carers’ allowance, help
towards care home fees, free NHS sight test, free NHS prescriptions,
lower television licence fee, car parking and public transport
concessions, exemption from directory enquiries fees
• Easier access to help from social services
• Loan of cassette recorder and talking books and newspapers (also
available without registration)

HOW TO . . . Optimize vision
Bigger
• Magniﬁers (glasses or contacts, hand magniﬁers, stand magniﬁers,
illuminated magniﬁers, reading telescopes). Consider portability,
cosmetic aspects, and posture required to use
• Larger print (books, enlarge frequently used items with photocopier)
Bolder
• Contrasting colours—eg black on white
• Use to emphasize written word, door handles, stair edges, etc.
• Use white cups for dark drinks
• Put contrasting strips round light ﬁttings
Brighter
• Remove net curtains
• Use high power bulbs (eg 150W not 60W incandescent; a wider
range of high luminescence ‘low energy’ lamps is now available)
• Use directable light sources (eg angle poise lamps)

VISUAL HALLUCINATIONS

Visual hallucinations
Management varies with the cause.

Organic brain disease
• Lewy body dementia (occur in 50–80%; usually well formed, eg
animals). Also occurs in dementia of Parkinson’s disease. Can respond
dramatically to cholinesterase inhibitors
• Anoxia, migraine and delirium—treat the underlying cause
• Focal neurological disease (especially occipital and temporal lobe—
range from unformed lines and lights, etc. to complex)
• Occipital lobe seizures—treat with anticonvulsants

Drugs
• Common with dopamine agonists and anticonvulsants (usually mild and
unformed). Try reducing the dose, watching for rebound in symptoms
• Overdose of anticholinergic drugs such as antihistamines or tricyclic
antidepressants
• Use of amphetamines and LSD
• Alcohol withdrawal

Psychiatric disease
Visual hallucinations occasionally occur with schizophrenia (auditory more
common).

Charles Bonnet syndrome
• Diagnosis of exclusion
• No other psychiatric symptoms or diseases present
• Occurs with bilateral visual loss (typically secondary to cataracts or
glaucoma) as a ‘release phenomenon’
• These are usually well formed, vivid, and occur in clear consciousness
• Insight is usually present
• Duration is usually seconds to a minute or so
• May be simple (ﬂashes, shapes) or complex (recognisable images)
• Non-threatening—the patient’s reaction is often one of curiosity or
amusement
• Probably under-estimated as patients reluctant to tell doctors for fear
of being labelled as ‘mad’
• Not related to psychiatric problems
• Reassurance is often all that is required, but symptoms may be
improved by enhancing vision

571

572

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Cataract
Term used to describe any lens opacity. The most common cause of
treatable blindness worldwide. In the UK it is largely a disease of the
older population: 65% of people in their 50s and everyone >80 have some
opaciﬁcation. This is probably caused by cumulative exposure to causative
agents rather than senescence per se.

Causes
• Exposure to environmental agents (eg UV light, smoke, blood sugar)—
more exposure with increasing age
• Ocular conditions (trauma, uveitis, previous intraocular surgery)
• Systemic conditions (eg diabetes, hypocalcaemia, Down’s syndrome)
• Drugs (especially steroids—ocular and systemic)

Symptoms
• Painless visual loss which varies depending on whether unilateral/
bilateral and severity/position of the opacity
• Commonly begins with difﬁculty in reading, recognizing faces, and
watching television
• May be worse in bright light or be associated with glare around lights

Signs
• Reduced visual acuity—usually gradual
• Diminished red reﬂex on ophthalmoscopy
• Change in the appearance of the lens (appears cloudy brown or white
when viewed with direct light)
• Beware co-existing conditions: pupil responses are normal, and the
patient should be able to point to the position of a light source

Management
• Optimizing visual conditions
2New glasses prescription may delay need for surgery.
• Surgical removal of opaciﬁed lens
• No effective medical treatment

When to treat?
Tailor treatment to the individual. Depends on visual requirements of
patient, severity of cataract, and presence of other ocular disease (worsens
outcome from surgery). Roughly speaking <6/18 in both eyes is likely to
beneﬁt from surgery, but an elderly person who does not read much may
be quite content with this visual level. Conversely, someone who wishes
to continue driving, or needs precise vision for other reasons may wish
for surgery much sooner. Previously surgeons waited for the cataract to
‘ripen’ to aid extraction—this is no longer the case. Have a frank discussion about risks and beneﬁts with each individual.

CATARACT

What the surgery involves
• Usually done as a day case under local or topical anaesthesia
• Patient must be able to lie fairly ﬂat and still. Patients with dementia
may need sedation or general anaesthesia (altering risk/beneﬁt);
consider heart failure, chest disease and spinal deformity—can they lie
ﬂat? If not, then the surgeon may be able to adapt the procedure
• It is not necessary for patients to discontinue medications. The
procedure may be done safely while a patient is taking aspirin, and
even warfarin
• Generally a safe and well tolerated procedure
• Phacoemulsiﬁcation is most commonly used in the UK (small cut in
eye to access lens that is then liqueﬁed with an ultrasonic probe). A
replacement lens is then folded into the empty lens capsule. Sutures
are not usually needed
• Other methods (extracapsular and intracapsular extraction) are less
commonly used
• Postoperatively the patient will wear an eye shield (usually at night) for
a period, and use steroid and antibiotic eye drops
• Surgery is done on one eye at a time. The poorer-seeing eye is usually
done ﬁrst. Second eye surgery may be done once outcome from the
ﬁrst eye is assessed

Outcome
With no ocular comorbidity, 85% have a visual acuity of >6/12 at discharge.
Outcome is worse with other eye diseases, eg glaucoma, and in patients
with diabetes and cerebrovascular disease.
As the replacement lens has a ﬁxed focus and is usually chosen to allow
clear distance vision, the patient will usually require glasses for reading.
A new prescription should be made up a few weeks after surgery, once
postoperative inﬂammation has settled. If second eye surgery is planned
then glasses are usually issued once both surgeries are completed.

573

574

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Glaucoma
Third most common cause of blindness worldwide.
2Leading cause of preventable blindness in the UK. Early detection can
slow/halt progression.

Deﬁnition
Visual loss due to a combination of loss of visual ﬁelds and cupping of
the optic disc. Usually associated with a rise in intraocular pressure sufﬁcient to cause damage to the optic nerve ﬁbres (either direct mechanical
damage, or by inducing ischaemia).

Intraocular pressure
• Ciliary body (posterior) makes aqueous, which ﬂows anteriorly
through the pupil and drains via the trabecular network in the anterior
chamber angle of the eye
• Balance of production and drainage determines pressure
• Wide range of pressures seen in normal adults (detected with
tonometry)—average 15.5mmHg, normal <21mmHg
• The pressure at which ocular damage occurs is probably highly variable
between people
• Can develop glaucoma with ‘normal pressure-normal tension
glaucoma’ (may be high for that person/other factors such as ischaemia
may be relevant). More common in older patients. Fluctuating BP may
be contributory
• Can have ‘high’ pressures without glaucoma—‘ocular hypertension’
• Symptoms depend on rate and degree of rise in pressure. Generally
asymptomatic unless advanced or acute

Primary (‘chronic’) open-angle glaucoma
• Most common
• Failure of outﬂow of aqueous causes slow rise in pressure, allowing
adaptation, so subtle symptoms
• No pain, corneal cloudiness, or haloes
• Slow loss of visual ﬁeld, typically in an arc shape (‘arcuate scotoma’)
with preservation of central vision (macula has more nerve cells so is
relatively protected). Progresses to tunnel vision, and then blindness
Risk factors
• Age (1% in 5th decade, rising to 10% in 9th decade)
• African Caribbean origin (four times risk)
• Blood relatives with glaucoma
Screening
• Target those at higher risk
• Combination of ophthalmoscopy (looking for disc ‘cupping’),
automated perimetry testing (for minor ﬁeld defects) and tonometry
(for intraocular pressure) is best
• Most cases picked up by optometrists
• Encourage regular eye tests, and include careful fundoscopy in physical
examination

GLAUCOMA

Treatment
• Topical treatments (eye drops): B-blockers, eg timolol (decrease
aqueous secretion. Can cause systemic B-blockade); prostaglandin
analogues eg latanoprost (improve drainage, may darken iris);
A-agonists (decrease aqueous production); carbonic anhydrase
inhibitors, eg dorzolamide (decrease aqueous secretion);
parasympathomimetics, eg pilocarpine (constrict pupil so will reduce
visual ﬁeld—not commonly used)
• Oral treatments: carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, eg acetazolamide very
powerful, with many side effects including electrolyte imbalance and
paraesthesia of extremities
• Surgical treatment: trabeculectomy—operation to improve aqueous
outﬂow. Argon laser trabeculoplasty (applied to the trabecular
meshwork) may be effective. Cyclodiode laser to the ciliary body
(decreases production) is used in refractory cases
• Support group: International Glaucoma Association (M www.iga.org.uk)

Acute angle closure glaucoma
2Emergency sight-threatening condition—requires urgent referral and
treatment.
• Apposition of lens to the back of the iris prevents outﬂow of aqueous
with a rapid rise in pressure
• Causes red, painful eye with vomiting, blurred vision, and haloes
around lights (due to corneal oedema)
• May be precipitated by pupil dilation, eg at dusk. Pupil constricts when
asleep so episodes at night may be aborted by sleep
• Very rarely can be precipitated by anticholinergic drugs
• More common in older patients, women, and longsighted individuals—
beware of the vomiting older woman with a red eye
• On examination cornea is usually cloudy and visual acuity signiﬁcantly
reduced (eg counting ﬁngers)
• Treat urgently with iv acetazolamide, topical glaucoma treatment, and
laser iridotomy to restore ﬂow. Treat other eye prophylactically with
laser iridotomy to prevent pupillary block

575

576

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Age-related macular degeneration
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of
adult blind registrations in UK and USA.
2New treatments for early stages make detection crucial.

Deﬁnition
As it sounds—age-related degenerative changes affecting the macula
(central part of the retina responsible for clear central vision).
Two types:
• 90% dry with gradual onset of symptoms (drusen and atrophy of the
retinal pigment epithelium)
• 10% wet, where symptoms relate to leaking vessels causing distortion
or sudden loss of central vision due to sub-macular haemorrhage
(choroidal neovascularization—new vessels can leak, bleed, and scar
causing visual loss in a few months)

Prevalence
• Increases with age
• 25–30 million worldwide
• Up to 30% of >75s may have early disease, and 7% late disease

Risk factors
• Cause unknown
• Age, smoking, family history are strongly associated
• Female sex, Caucasian race, hypertension, blue eyes, other ocular
conditions (lens opacities, aphakia) and low dietary antioxidants

Symptoms
• Asymptomatic in early stages, progressing to loss of central vision
• May also have decreased contrast and colour detection, ﬂashing lights
and hallucinations
• Distortion of straight lines is a feature of wet AMD
• Peripheral vision is normal in absence of other pathology

Detection
• Regular ocular examination
• Use of Amsler grid in high risk patients (Fig. 22.1)

Prognosis
• Dry AMD progresses slowly and rarely causes blindness
• Wet AMD may progress rapidly (blind in under 3 months) and
accounts for 90% of AMD blind registrations. Sudden onset of
distortion of central vision should prompt urgent referral
• Bilateral disease—42% with wet AMD will develop this within 5 years

AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION

Prevention
• Smoking is the most important modiﬁable risk factor
• A diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces risk
• A combination of B-carotene, vitamins C and E, and zinc is effective in
preventing severe visual loss in established moderate-severe AMD
• A multicentre study showed that antioxidant vitamins halted
progression of dry AMD in around 30% of patients

Management
• Appropriate for subset of wet AMD only
• Halts progression so early treatment is desirable
• Fluorescein angiography should be done within a few days of onset of
symptoms to determine the type and location of neovascular areas
Treatment options for neovascular AMD include:
• Photodynamic therapy—this targets sub-foveal neovascular areas
(whilst preserving normal retina) by using photosensitive drug
(verteporﬁn) along with a non-thermal activating laser. Used in early
disease, this therapy can slow or halt progression
• Anti-angiogenic therapy—eg ranibizumab—a recombinant, humanized,
monoclonal antibody that neutralizes all active forms of vascular
endothelial growth factor A. NICE recommends its use for wet AMD
under certain conditions (eg no permanent damage to the central
fovea). The cost of ranibizumab beyond 14 injections in the treated eye
is met by the manufacturer
• Laser photocoagulation is sometimes used for extra-foveal lesions

577

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

HOW TO . . . Use an Amsler grid to detect macular
pathology

Fig. 22.1 Amsler grid.

• Test one eye at a time
• Usual reading glasses should be worn, and the grid held at
comfortable reading distance
• Ask the patient to look at the central spot, and not to look away
• Assess the following:
• Can all four corners of the grid be seen?
• Are any of the lines missing, wavy, blurred, or distorted?
• Do all of the boxes appear the same size and shape?
• Any abnormalities may indicate macular pathology and should
prompt referral to an ophthalmologist

THE EYE AND SYSTEMIC DISEASE

The eye and systemic disease
Two of the top four causes for blind registration are due to systemic
disease—diabetes and vascular disease. Eye disease develops as a late
complication of prolonged poor control in both cases, and the important
message is to strive to prevent these problems in the ﬁrst place.

Diabetes
Causes retinopathy, cataracts, and ‘microvascular’ cranial nerve palsies.
Retinopathy
• Associated with increasing duration of diabetes—at 20 years, 80% will
have some retinopathy
• All patients with diabetes require dilated annual screening (either
photographic, or by appropriately trained professional). Direct
ophthalmoscopy alone is inadequate
• Appearance: microaneurysms, haemorrhages, (background
retinopathy) progressing to cotton wool spots, blot haemorrhages
and tortuous vessels (pre-proliferative retinopathy) then new vessels
(proliferative retinopathy). Exudates and macular oedema are
indicators of maculopathy
• Early detection of problems (especially when near the macula) should
prompt referral to an ophthalmologist. Sight-threatening retinopathy
requires laser treatment to limit progression
2A diabetic person diagnosed at age 70 may well live 20 years, so tight
control is desirable. Meticulous control of diabetes and hypertension has
been shown to reduce all complications including retinopathy.

Vascular disease
• Affects the eye directly with hypertensive retinopathy, and more
indirectly when cerebrovascular disease impacts on vision. Associated
with ‘microvascular’ cranial nerve palsies
• Early detection and control of risk factors for vascular disease will
ameliorate this problem (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Protect your patient
from another stroke’, p.195). Tight blood pressure control, smoking
cessation, lipid lowering, diabetic control, and appropriate anti-platelet
use should all be targeted at the older age group as aggressively as the
younger patients
• There is little in the way of treatment for the disease once it is
established
• Appearance: silver wiring, arteriovenous nipping, and arteriolar
narrowing progressing to exudates, cotton wool spots, haemorrhages
and papilloedema

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Drugs and the eye
Many drugs that are frequently used in the older patient can cause ocular
side effects. Older people are more vulnerable to developing side effects,
but are least likely to report them (attributing it to part of getting older).

Direct toxicity
• Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine (used in treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis and other connective tissue diseases as well as
malaria) cause a toxic maculopathy in large prolonged doses
• Phenothiazines used for a long time (to treat psychosis) may cause
retinal damage
• Tamoxifen (for breast cancer treatment) may cause maculopathy
• Amiodarone (for arrhythmias) may cause cataracts
• Ethambutol (anti-tuberculous) can cause optic neuritis and red/green
colour blindness

Altering accommodation
Causes blurred vision
• Antihistamines
• Some antihypertensives

Decreasing pupil size
Causes less light accommodation.
• Opiates
• Miotic drops used for glaucoma

Steroids
• Oral steroids over time can cause cataracts
• Topical and oral steroids may raise the intraocular pressure

CHAPTER 22

Eyes

Eyelid disorders
Eyelids provide physical protection to the eyes and ensure normal tear
ﬁlm and drainage. Disorders are common in older people, are often
uncomfortable and yet are under-recognized and under-treated.

Entropion
In-turning of the (usually) lower lid. Occurs as orbicularis muscle weakens
with age (or with conjunctival scarring distorting the lid). Lashes irritate
the eye and may abrade the cornea, causing red eye. Lubricants and taping
of the eye may relieve symptoms. Surgery (under local anaesthesia) provides deﬁnitive correction.

Ectropion
Eversion of the eyelid. Occurs with orbicularis weakness, scarring of
the periorbital skin or seventh nerve palsy. Distortion prevents correct
drainage of tears and correct tear ﬁlm, leading to watery eye with conjunctival dryness. Treat with ointment to protect conjunctiva. Surgery
(local anaesthesia) corrects.

Ptosis
Drooping of upper eyelid. When severe can cover pupil and impair vision.
Causes: aponeurotic (defects in levator aponeurosis), mechanical (lid
lesion, lid oedema), neurological (third nerve palsy—look for pupil and eye
movement problems, Horner’s syndrome), myogenic (congenital levator
dystrophy, muscular dystrophies, myasthenia gravis, chronic progressive
external ophthalmoplegia).
2Do not ignore ptosis in older people—it may not be longstanding; look
for signs of underlying disease.

Dry eyes
Common in older people as tear secretion diminishes. Eyes feel gritty, but
are not red. Diuretics may exacerbate. Most common cause is blepharitis
(inﬂamed lid margins with blocked meibomian gland oriﬁces and crusting);
usually worse in those with rosacea, eczema, and psoriasis.
Treat blepharitis with hot compresses (5min bd), lid massage (upwards
towards lid margin lower lid, downwards towards lid margin upper lid,
eyelid cleaning targeting the base of eyelashes at the lid margin (warm
water ± baby shampoo on a cotton wool bud). Antibiotic ointment not
usually required unless staphylococcal infection suspected. Treat dry eyes
with artiﬁcial tears or ointment (gives considerable relief).

EYELID DISORDERS

Eyelid tumours
Most common (90%) is basal cell carcinoma. Slow growing, non-metastasising but locally invasive. Often ignored by patient. More common in
fairer skins after chronic sun exposure. Waxy nodule with telangiectatic
vessels on surface and pearly rolled border (rodent ulcer) is usual appearance. Treatment is with surgical excision (Moh’s micrographic surgery
preserves most tissue and may be appropriate in some) or radiotherapy.

Varicella zoster infection
Facial shingles. Involvement of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal
nerve will cause vesicles and crusting periorbitally (see b ‘Varicella zoster
infection’, p.624).

CHAPTER 23

Skin

The ageing skin
Skin changes with age are universal, but many changes we associate with
ageing are actually due to cumulative sun exposure (photoageing), and
could be largely prevented by protecting the skin from the sun (compare
an older person’s facial skin to their buttock skin).
Intrinsic ageing does occur, however (Table 23.1), and there are
several skin diseases that are age related (eg pruritus, pemphigoid, lichen
sclerosus).

Hair changes
• 50% of the over 50s will have grey hair, as melanocyte numbers drop
• Male pattern baldness (affecting the vertex and temples) starts in the
late teens and progresses—80% of male pensioners are balding
• Women may be affected after the menopause, but it is rarely as severe
• Diffuse hair loss occurs in both sexes with advancing age (consider
checking for iron deﬁciency, thyroid dysfunction, renal impairment,
hypoproteinaemia, inﬂammatory skin conditions, use of antimetabolite
drugs, etc.)
• As hair follicles age, their function may be disrupted, leading to longer,
tougher hairs growing in eyebrows, ears, and noses, in both sexes
• Postmenopausal hormone changes may cause women to develop hair
in the beard area and upper lip

THE AGEING SKIN

Table 23.1 Age-related changes and their clinical implications
Age-related change

Clinical implications

Epidermis thins, with ﬂattening of the
dermo-epidermal junction, limiting
transfer of nutrients and making
separation of layers easier

Increased tendency to blistering

Slower cell turnover

Slower healing of wounds

Less melanocyte activity, with
slower DNA repair

Increased photosensitivity, with
increased tendency to skin
malignancy

Altered epidermal protein binding

Dry, rough, and ﬂaky skin more
common

Increased skin tearing

Abnormal skin barrier, so more
prone to irritant contact dermatitis
Altered connective tissue structure
and function

Reduced elasticity and strength of
skin

Decreased blood ﬂow through
dermal vascular beds

Skin appears cooler and paler
Thermoregulation is less efﬁcient
Hair and gland growth and function
slows

Subcutaneous fat decreases in
volume and is distributed differently
(eg more abdominal fat)

Thermoregulation is less efﬁcient

Number of cutaneous nerve endings
decreases

Cutaneous sensation blunts (eg ﬁne
touch, temperature, proprioception)

Protection against pressure injury
lessens

Pain threshold increases
Fewer cutaneous glands

Thermoregulation is less efﬁcient

Nail bed function decreases

Nails become thick, dry, brittle and
yellow, with longitudinal ridges

The immune functioning of the skin
decreases

Increased propensity to skin
infections and malignancies

587

588

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Photoageing
The dermis thickens with tangled elastic ﬁbres; the epidermis is variable
in thickness with regions of both hypertrophy and atrophy—leading to
considerable skin changes:
• The skin becomes wrinkled (coarse and ﬁne), rough, yellowed, and
irregularly pigmented—these changes are all exacerbated by smoking
• The skin may develop actinic (solar) elastosis—thickened, yellow skin
with rhomboid pattern and senile comedones
• Actinic (solar) purpura is a non-palpable rash often on the forearms,
due to red cell extravasation from sun-damaged vessels (the platelet
count is normal)
• Lesions include brown macules, multiple telangiectasia, actinic (solar)
keratoses (scaly, rough hyperkeratotic areas on sun-exposed skin), as
well as a tendency to skin tumours
Prevention is better than cure for these changes, but topical retinoids
may reduce the appearance of wrinkles and pigment, and certain plastic
surgery techniques are employed (eg chemical peels and injections of
collagen and botulinum toxin).

Sun protection
• Avoid unnecessary sun exposure
• Stay out of the sun during the hottest time of the day (11am–3pm)
• Wear appropriate factor sun screen (increasing sun protection factor
for fairer skins)
• Areas that are often forgotten include balding heads (wear a hat) and
the tops of ears (apply sun screen)

Photosensitizing drugs
Several drugs may interact with ultraviolet (UV) or visible light to cause
adverse cutaneous effects. These may be phototoxic or photoallergic
reactions. Possible agents include:
• Amiodarone
• Phenothiazines
• Diuretics (including bumetanide and furosemide)
• Antibiotics eg tetracyclines (especially doxycycline), isoniazid,
ciproﬂoxacin
• Quinine
• Procainamide
• Hydralazine

CELLULITIS

Cellulitis
Deep infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues with oedema, often
on the lower leg. More common with increasing age, immunocompromise
(eg diabetes) and with a predisposing skin condition (leg ulcer, pressure
sore, lymphoedema, toe web intertrigo, traumatic wounds, etc.).

Organisms
Usually Streptococcus (group A, commonly Strep. pyogenes) and/or staphylococcus. With open wounds (eg leg ulcers, pressure sores) and lymphoedema colonization is broader so infecting organisms may be more
diverse, including highly resistant bacteria, eg MRSA (see b ‘Disease caused
by MRSA’, p.612).

Clinical features
•
•
•
•
•
•

Red, hot, tender, raised area with poorly demarcated margins
Portal of entry for bacteria often evident (eg trauma)
Systemic upset may follow (fever, malaise)
May present non-speciﬁcally, so always examine the whole skin
Spread can cause lymphangitis with tender nodes in the inguinal region
Risk of bacteraemia (up to 80% in nursing home residents with pressure
sores; treat aggressively as mortality is as much as 50%)

Investigations
• FBC: elevated white cell count in around 50%
• Blood cultures: take in all before antibiotics (positive in 25%)
• Local culture: eg wound swab, injection and aspiration of saline in the
dermis, skin biopsy. Rarely needed as empirical treatment often works

Treatment
• If the cellulitis is mild, and the patient well, then oral therapy can
be used to start. Oral options include phenoxymethylpenicillin +
ﬂucloxacillin, erythromycin alone or co-amoxiclav
• Draw around the cellulitis with a water-resistant pen to allow accurate
subsequent assessments and arrange early review (at 24–48hr)
• Elevate the limb: oedema with blistering may cause ulceration
• If more extensive, with systemic upset, lymphangitis or worsening on
oral therapy, then hospital admission for rest, elevation and parenteral
therapy is needed
• Options include benzylpenicillin + ﬂucloxacillin or co-amoxiclav for
48hr (or until the erythema starts to recede), then an oral course
• Total treatment may be needed for up to 14 days but treat each case
individually
• If cellulitis complicates ulcers, pressure sores or lymphoedema then
broader spectrum antibiotics are needed at outset
• Look for and treat toe web intertrigo in all (with topical antifungals)
• Cellulitis can be painful: ensure that the patient has adequate analgesia
• Older patients will often become dehydrated with bacteraemia: assess
clinically (pulse, blood pressure, general condition) and biochemically
(urea, creatinine, and electrolytes) giving intravenous ﬂuids in the acute
phase if needed

589

590

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Other bacterial skin infections
Erysipelas
• Type of cellulitis that is common in older patients
• Strep. pyogenes infection of the dermis and hypodermis
• Occurs on face (bridge of nose and across cheeks), and less commonly
on legs, arms and trunk
• Flu-like prodrome
• Well-demarcated edge with erythema, oedema, and pain
• Progresses to vesicles that rupture and crust
• Portal of entry may be unclear, especially with facial erysipelas
• Bacteraemia in 55%; mortality of 10% without treatment
• Requires parenteral therapy unless very mild—48hr of iv
benzylpenicillin followed by 12 days or oral phenoxymethylpenicillin
• Recurs in 30% at some point

Necrotizing fasciitis
• Rare and serious infection
• Affects soft tissues (usually arm/leg); spreads rapidly along fascial planes
• Commonly due to Strep. pyogenes, but polymicrobial infection also
occurs (eg Staphylococci, Pseudomonas, Bacteroides, diphtheroids,
coliforms)
• Patient feels and looks unwell with a high fever
• Area of swelling, redness, and tenderness enlarges rapidly and becomes
purple and discoloured. Haemorrhagic bullae develop followed by
necrosis
• Prompt parenteral antibiotics and early surgical debridement essential
2Key to management is early recognition. Review a patient with cellulitis
frequently if they are unwell, looking for rapid spread.

Intertrigo
• Common complaint, almost exclusively in older patients, when
there is superﬁcial inﬂammation of skin surfaces that are in contact,
eg ﬂexures of limbs, groins, axillae, submammary
• Due to friction in a continually warm, moist environment
• May be underlying skin disease (eg seborrhoeic dermatitis,
seborrhoeic eczema, irritant contact eczema (urine, faeces), psoriasis)
• Secondary infection with yeast is common

Treatment
Improve hygiene
Wash carefully and always dry the skin thoroughly
Use talcum powder to keep areas dry
Apply topical antifungal (eg clotrimazole cream plus 1%
hydrocortisone cream)
• Separate skin surfaces where possible

•
•
•
•

FUNGAL SKIN INFECTIONS

Fungal skin infections
There are two main groups of fungi that cause infection in humans.

Dermatophytes, eg Tinea species (‘ringworm’)
Infect the feet, groin, body, hands, nails, and scalp
Suspect if there is a distinct edge to an itchy lesion
Conﬁrm diagnosis with skin scrapings, or trial treatment
Topical imidazoles, eg clotrimazole (Canesten® cream) are effective.
Terbinaﬁne is more effective, but more expensive
• Oral terbinaﬁne will work for more resistant infection but should only
be used if topical treatment fails and the diagnosis conﬁrmed
•
•
•
•

Yeasts, eg Candida albicans (‘thrush’)
• Normal commensal of mouth and gastrointestinal tract
• Produces infection in certain circumstances, eg moist skin folds, poor
hygiene, diabetes, and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics—many of
these commonly occurring in older patients
• Common sites include genital (associated with catheter use, see b
‘Vulval disorders’, p.526), intertrigo (see b ‘Intertrigo’, p.590), around
the nail (chronic paronychia) and oral thrush (especially if dentures ﬁt
poorly, see b ‘The elderly mouth’, p.354)
• Topical imidazoles, eg clotrimazole are effective for skin infection.
Preparations that include hydrocortisone will also reduce inﬂammation
and help to break the itch/scratch cycle
• Nystatin, amphotericin, or miconazole lozenges, suspension, or gel can
be used for oral infection
• More widespread infection (eg oesophageal candidiasis) or those with
severe immunodeﬁciency may require systemic therapy—ﬂuconazole
50–100mg daily is effective

Seborrhoeic dermatitis
• Chronic inﬂammatory condition with erythematous scaly eruptions
• Possibly due to a hypersensitivity to Pityrosporum—a yeast skin
commensal
• Classic distribution—face (eyebrows, eyelids, nasolabial folds,
postauricular, beard area), scalp (dandruff), central chest, central back
and in older patients only, ﬂexural (axillae, groins, submammary)
• May cause otitis externa or blepharitis
• Increased prevalence and severity in older patients, exacerbated by
poor skin care
• Associated with parkinsonism and HIV
• Scalp is treated with ketoconazole shampoo
• Elsewhere, use ketoconazole shampoo as a wash and apply miconazole
combined with 1% hydrocortisone cream
• Blepharitis is treated with warm compresses, cleaning eyelids with
cotton buds and diluted baby shampoo, and steroid eye cream
• Difﬁcult to treat—recurrence is common, and repeated treatments are
often required. Aim to control, not cure

591

592

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Chronic venous insufﬁciency
Common, ranging from minor cosmetic problems to debilitating leg ulcers.
More common after phlebitis or DVT (25% with a history of DVT will
develop venous insufﬁciency at 20 years, 4% will eventually develop leg
ulcers), after leg injury, in obese patients, and with advancing age. Probably
more common in women, although female longevity may account for
apparent difference.

Pathogenesis
Due to failure of the venous pump in the legs. Commonly caused by deep
vein occlusion (although only half will show signs of this on venography).
Retrograde blood ﬂow in the deep veins, valvular incompetence, and progressive pericapillary ﬁbrin deposition also contribute to the process.

Clinical changes
Varicose veins
• Initially there may be no symptoms, just venous dilation (starts with
submalleolar venous ﬂares and progresses to dilated, tortuous,
palpable varicose veins)
• Problems may include itch, ache, thrombophlebitis, or bleeding from
varicosities. Treatment at this stage is largely cosmetic and includes
surgical stripping of superﬁcial veins (not where there is a history of
deep vein occlusion). Ache may be relieved by use of support hosiery
Oedema
• May initially be unilateral and wax and wane with position (classically
occurring at the end of a day of standing up)
• A feeling of leg heaviness is common
• Low-dose thiazide diuretics (eg bendroﬂumethiazide 2.5mg od) may
help, but as the patient is not ﬂuid overloaded, beware of volume
depletion
Skin changes
• Haemosiderin pigmentation due to red cell extravasation
• Telangiectasia
• Lacy white scars
• Eczematous changes with itchy, weepy skin exacerbated by many
topical treatments—improve with topical steroid application
• Lipodermatosclerosis occurs when ﬁbrosis of the tissues leads to
induration. May become circumferential and girdle the lower leg
causing an inverted champagne bottle appearance
Venous ulcers
Venous ulcers arise in the context of these skin changes, often precipitated by minor trauma.

LEG ULCERS

Leg ulcers
Common condition, afﬂicting 1% of adult population at any time. 50%
are venous ulcers, 10% arterial, 25% mixed venous and arterial, and the
remainder due to other causes (diabetes, infection, malignancy, blood disorders, vasculitis, drug eruptions, etc.).
Associated with high morbidity and healthcare expenditure.

Clinical features of common ulcers
Venous ulcers
• Occur on the medial ankle, along the course of the saphenous vein
• Shallow and tender with irregular edges that are not undermined
• The base is usually red, but may be sloughy
• Associated skin features of chronic venous insufﬁciency
Arterial ulcers
• Occur at sites of trauma or pressure—commonly the malleoli, toes,
ball of foot, heel and base of ﬁfth metatarsal
• Deep, punched out, and painful with regular edges
• Associated features of peripheral arterial disease (decreased pulses,
slow capillary reﬁll, pale, cool, hairless skin, see b ‘Peripheral vascular
disease’, p.304)
Diabetic ulcers
• Occur at pressure points
• Painless (due to diabetic neuropathy)
• Often infected with undermined edges
Malignant ulcers
• Painless with a raised edge
• Be suspicious if an ulcer fails to heal, or has an atypical appearance

A general approach to leg ulcers
• Establish cause—usually possible on clinical grounds. May need to
consider Doppler ultrasound (looking for deep venous occlusion,
valvular incompetence and venous pressures), ABPI (diagnoses arterial
disease, see b ‘HOW TO . . . Measure ABPI’, p.305), biopsy (looking
for malignancy, or for tissue culture if infection suspected) or blood
tests (FBC, glucose, ESR, CRP, autoantibody screen)
• Treat cause where possible, eg compression bandaging for venous
disease, revascularization for arterial disease
• Keep ulcer clean and avoid irritant topical applications. Many available
products will cause a contact dermatitis. Keep it simple
• Ensure there is adequate pain relief
• Re-evaluate regularly. If the ulcer is not healing then reassess the
original diagnosis
• Avoid antibiotics unless there is cellulitis or osteomyelitis. Colonization
is inevitable, and swabs usually unhelpful
• Do a patch test in any patient with a longstanding ulcer to exclude an
allergic contact dermatitis

593

594

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Management of venous leg ulcers
Chronic and debilitating condition, with serious psychological and social
implications. Median duration is 9 months, although 25% will still be
present at 5 years. Correctly treated, 70% can be healed within 3 months,
but 75% are recurrent.

General measures
• Encourage mobility—this strengthens the muscle pump and helps
prevent deep vein occlusion. If bed-bound, then exercises such as toe
and ankle wiggling and quadriceps movements can help
• Stop smoking

Limb elevation
• Raising the legs above the level of the heart improves venous return,
reduces oedema, and assists healing of venous ulcers
• Unfortunately, this is rarely practical—many older patients cannot
tolerate such a position owing to comorbidity (cardiac failure, COPD,
arthritic hips, obesity, etc.) and even if they can, it is difﬁcult to sustain
• Balance beneﬁts against risks of immobility and complications
(thrombosis, deconditioning)—usually only used for very resistant
ulcers when admission to hospital may be required
• Elevating the foot of the bed mattress at night is helpful (easiest with
electronic hospital beds, otherwise use a wedge under the mattress)
• During the day, sitting with the feet on a stool is better than nothing,
although it fails to raise the legs high enough
• Elevation should not be used when peripheral arterial disease
predominates—ﬁrst check pedal pulses and ABPI (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Measure ABPI’, p.305)

Ulcer care
• Clean the ulcer by irrigation with saline
• Debridement of dead tissue may improve healing (no trial evidence):
• Scalpel (local anaesthetic cream may make this less uncomfortable)
• Maggots (consume only dead tissue, leaving behind the healthy)
• Facilitating the body’s own system by creating a moist environment
• Chemical agents are not recommended (as they also harm healing
tissue)
• No single wound dressing has been shown to improve healing
• An ideal dressing keeps the wound moist with exudate, but not
macerated, at an ideal temperature and pH for healing without irritants,
excessive slough, or infection
• Simple, low-adherent, and low-cost dressings are the mainstay
• Impregnated dressings (eg with antiseptic, antibiotic, debriding
enzymes, growth factors or silver sulfadiazine) can cause contact
allergic or irritant dermatitis (up to 85% of patients), worsening the
ulcer, so avoid in routine use
• Occlusive or semi occlusive dressings can aid with pain relief
• Gel and hydrocolloid dressings can be useful to remove exudates
• Metronidazole or charcoal dressings can be used for odour control

MANAGEMENT OF VENOUS LEG ULCERS

Compression bandaging
• Mainstay of treatment for venous ulcers—when correctly applied, leads
to healing for 70% in 3 months
• Ensure that the ABPI is >0.8 (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Measure ABPI’,
p.305)
• When mixed aetiology ulcers are present, some compression is often
required, but this has to be carefully moderated to compensate for the
arterial insufﬁciency
• Provides an active counter-pressure to venous blood pressure, and
enhances the function of the muscle pump
• Graduated four-layer compression from the ankle to the knee (wool
bandage, crepe bandage, elasticated bandage and ﬁnally a self-adhesive
elasticated bandage
• Should be comfortable, allow the patient to continue with daily life
(eg wear shoes as usual) and last a week (unless highly exudative)
• Should be applied by an experienced practitioner, as incorrect
bandaging can cause more harm than good
• Intermittent pneumatic compression therapy may be useful for patients
for whom standard compression stockings may be ineffective or not
tolerated (eg morbid obesity, severe oedema)

Oral agents
• Aspirin. May improve ulcer healing time
• Diuretics. Short courses may reduce oedema
• Antibiotics. Most ulcers are permanently colonized (commonly
staphylococci, streptococci, E. coli, Proteus, and Pseudomonas) and
routine use of oral antibiotics will only promote resistance. Wound
swabs will only grow these colonizing organisms and are not indicated.
Treat with systemic antibiotics only if there is evidence of spreading
infection (rapidly increasing size, increased pain, surrounding erythema,
tracking up lymphatics system, or systemic upset)
• Other agents. eg pentoxifylline. May have a role in ulcer management
but evidence is not robust

Surgery
• Skin grafts may be helpful. Pinch or punch skin grafts may stimulate
healing
• Surgical correction of deep vein incompetence is considered
where bandaging has failed. Involves ligation of superﬁcial veins and
valvuloplasty

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Pruritus
Intense itching. Common condition in older patients, often causing considerable distress. Threshold for itch affected by neurological and psychological factors—exacerbated by social isolation, sensory impairment (blind,
deaf) and depression. Often ignored, yet simple measures can make a big
difference.

Causes
Often associated with dry skin (xerosis), common with ageing, and frequently worst on lower legs, forearms and hands. Skin is dry, scaly, and
may develop inﬂamed ﬁssures when severe (asteatotic dermatitis).
Contact dermatitis may show few skin changes if mild, yet cause troublesome itching. Limited to areas exposed to allergen (eg under clothing if
due to washing power).
Systemic disease causes up to half of pruritus in the elderly, including:
• Liver failure (may be mild jaundice—itch caused by bile salts)
• Chronic renal failure
• Iron deﬁciency—even before anaemic
• Haematological disorders (lymphoma, polycythaemia—itch may be
exacerbated by water)
• Infections (including fungal infection, scabies and lice infestations,
gastrointestinal parasite infections)
• Metabolic disorders including: thyroid disease (affects 10% of
hyperthyroid patients, and many hypothyroid patients because of dry
skin); diabetes mellitus
• Malignancy
Many drugs can cause a pruritic rash as an adverse drug reaction (usually
allergic) but some cause itch without a rash (eg morphine, allopurinol and
benzodiazepines) or because of cholestasis.

Assessment
• History should include full systems enquiry looking for underlying
disease, drug history and speciﬁc enquiries about possible irritants
(eg biological washing powder, new bath products). Ask if anyone
else is itching
• Examination should include inspection of all skin and thorough
general examination (looking for eg burrows or other signs of scabies,
lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, thyroid enlargement, etc.)
• Investigations should include: FBC, iron and ferritin, ESR, U,C+E, LFTs,
TFTs, and blood glucose. May include other tests, guided by history,
eg stool examination for ova, cysts, and parasites, abdominal
ultrasound if organomegaly felt, etc.

•
•

Treat the underlying cause wherever possible
Iron supplements if stores low (even if FBC normal)
Stop any drugs that may be causing or exacerbating the condition
Apply emollients—light preparations such as aqueous cream can help
itch even if the skin does not appear dry, and may be mixed with
0.5% menthol, which has a cooling and antiseptic action. Greasier
preparations, eg 50:50 liquid parafﬁn, white soft parafﬁn are useful
when the dryness is more severe
Urea-containing emollients are used where the skin is scaly, and
are often useful in the elderly (eg Balneum® plus, E45® itch relief
cream, etc.)
Avoid excessive bathing—no more than daily; avoid hot water and
prolonged soaking
Use preparations such as aqueous cream or emulsifying ointments
instead of soap. Emollient bath additives can be added to the water.
Brand names such as Oilatum® and E45® are sold as both ointments
and bath oils, and there are many others available
Avoid exacerbating factors, such as heat (especially hot baths), alcohol,
hot drinks and vasodilating drugs
Wear loose, cotton clothing
Keep nails short to limit skin damage from scratching
Consider short-term bandaging where excoriation severe to allow
healing
Antihistamines may be useful—sedating preparations such as
hydroxyzine hydrochloride, 25mg at night can help sleep. Non-sedating
agents can be used during the day (eg chlorphenamine, cetirizine,
loratadine)
Colestyramine is used to decrease itch in biliary obstruction and
primary biliary cirrhosis
Light therapy (phototherapy) may help—normal sunlight, or a course
of UVB therapy can be arranged

597

598

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Pruritic conditions
Lichen simplex
• Local patch of pruritus, which when scratched leads to skin damage
with thickening, discolouration, and excoriation
• Worse in times of emotional stress
• Treat with steroids (topical or intralesional) and avoidance of
scratching (bandaging may help). Capsaicin cream may alleviate itching
by decreasing substance P levels in the skin

Pruritus ani
• Common complaint
• Occasionally due to infection (streptococci, candidiasis, threadworms)
• Exclude allergic contact dermatitis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, lichen
sclerosus (see b ‘Vulval disorders’, p.526) or psoriasis
• Usually due to soiling of the perianal skin, which is worse with loose
stool and difﬁculty in wiping effectively (eg with arthritis)
• Mainstay of treatment is improving hygiene after bowel movement
(assist with wiping if physically difﬁcult; consider wiping with a damp
cloth, etc)
• Use aqueous cream as a soap substitute
• Once developed, the itch may be self-perpetuating—break the cycle
with steroids ± topical antifungals or antiseptics
• Patch test to exclude allergy

PRURITIC CONDITIONS

HOW TO . . . Recognize and manage scabies
2Thinking of this diagnosis is the ﬁrst step.
• Caused by Sarcoptes scabiei mite
• Spread by skin-to-skin contact
• Outbreaks can occur within institutions (eg nursing homes, hospital
wards)
• Occasionally serious, even fatal

Symptoms and signs
• Intense itch (worse at night)
• Widespread excoriation
• Examine the patient carefully for burrows and/or erythematous
papules that are found:
• Between ﬁngers and toes
• On the wrist ﬂexor surface
• Around the nipples and umbilicus
• In the axillae and groin

Treatment

Isolate the patient in a side room
Barrier nurse (gloves, aprons)
Apply topical pesticidal lotions or creams, eg permethrin, malathion
Apply to the whole body including the scalp, neck, and face. Ensure
the interdigital webs are well covered
Treat all household members (or all others in close contact in an
institution) simultaneously, including asymptomatic contacts
Wash clothes and bedding
Repeat treatment after a week
Prescribe 30–60g of cream and 100mL of lotion for each application
Applying after a hot bath is no longer recommended
Antibiotics may be needed for secondary infection
Itch may persist for weeks after treatment has eradicated the
mite, but should slowly diminish. Topical steroids and sedating
antihistamines to aid sleep can be helpful
Persistent itch may indicate treatment failure

Norwegian scabies occurs in immunosuppressed and frail older
patients. A heavy load of mites produces hyperkeratotic lesions. Highly
contagious. May require additional oral treatment (eg ivermectin—not
licensed).

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Blistering diseases
There are many disorders causing skin blistering in older people—see
Table 23.2 for a differential. Common causes include blistering secondary
to cellulitis or rapid onset oedema. Bullous pemphigoid is signiﬁcant in
that it occurs almost exclusively in the elderly population.

Bullous pemphigoid
Chronic autoimmune bullous eruption.
Clinical features
• Patient is systemically well
• Skin becomes erythematous and itchy
• Large, tense blisters then appear, usually on the limbs, trunk, and
ﬂexures (rarely mucous membranes)
• Blisters then heal without scarring
• May appear in normal looking skin, or at the site of previous skin
damage (eg ulcer, trauma)
• Chronic and recurrent condition
Diagnosis
• Conﬁrmed by skin biopsy, that shows linear IgG deposited at the
basement membrane
• Circulating autoantibody (anti-BPAg1 and anti-BPAg2) is found in the
serum of up to half of patients
Treatment
• Should be managed by a dermatologist
• Responds well to steroids
• Mild, local disease can be treated with strong topical steroids
• More widespread disease requires oral prednisolone (40–60mg daily
initially, reducing fairly rapidly to 10mg within a few weeks)
• Topical or intralesional steroids are used for resistant lesions
• Remember to monitor for and protect against steroid side effects
• Consider steroid-sparing agents for longer treatment courses
(eg azathioprine)
Prognosis
• 50% have self-limiting disease
• The majority will be off medication within 2 years

infection (eg eczema herpeticum, staphylococcal infection)

Infections

Herpes simplex—usually cause blisters on the face or genitals
Herpes zoster—shingles is common in older patients (see b
‘Varicella zoster infection’, p.624)
Staphylococci and streptococci may cause primary infections
(eg impetigo—facial blisters that rupture to leave a yellow crust;
erysipelas—well-deﬁned area of redness and swelling that later
blisters, usually on face or lower leg) or secondary infection of,
eg, a leg ulcer or wound. Either may result in blistering

CHAPTER 23

Skin

Skin cancers and pre-cancers
All increase in frequency with increasing age and sun exposure. They are
most common on sun-exposed areas, especially the head and neck and
are diagnosed by biopsy. Any suspicious skin lesion should be referred to
a dermatologist for consideration of this after discussion with the patient.

Actinic keratoses
• Rough, scaly patches
• Vary from skin coloured to red, brown, yellow, and black (often
patchy)
• Pre-malignant, with a small risk of becoming squamous cell carcinoma
over years. Some resolve spontaneously. Treat established lesions
• Removal with cryotherapy, topical 5-ﬂuorouracil (5-FU—applied bd for
4–6 weeks, causes erythema, burning, ulceration, and then healing) or
topical diclofenac (treat for 60–90 days; therapeutic effect may occur
up to 30 days after stopping)

Bowen’s disease
• Intraepidermal carcinoma, with small risk of transformation into
squamous cell carcinoma
• Typically occurs on the lower leg of elderly women
• Caused by sun exposure, arsenic exposure, or human papilloma virus
infection
• Pink or reddish scaly plaques with well-deﬁned edges
• Histology should be conﬁrmed
• Watchful waiting may be appropriate, but most lesions are removed by
cryotherapy, topical 5-FU, curettage, or excision

Lentigo maligna
•
•
•
•

Irregular pigmented macules that can be brown, black, red, or white
Usually over 1cm in size, they occur in areas of sun exposure
1–2% become invasive with time
Excision is required, although watchful waiting may be appropriate if
the patient is frail

Basal cell carcinoma
• Commonest, accounting for 75% of all skin cancers
• Other risk factors include irradiation, arsenic ingestion, or chronic
scarring
• Slow growing and usually only locally invasive (metastasis virtually
unknown), but facial tumours left untreated can cause erosion of
cartilage and bone with signiﬁcant disﬁgurement
• Begins as a pearly papule, that then ulcerates, characteristically with a
rolled everted edge and surface telangiectasia (so called rodent ulcer)
• Most lesions need excision with a 5mm margin; Moh’s microsurgical
method involves inspecting histology during the procedure to limit
tissue loss; radiotherapy can be used where surgery is not an option,
or in cases of recurrence. Intralesional interferon or photodynamic
therapies are newer options
• Recurrence in 5% at 5 years, so follow-up is required

SKIN CANCERS AND PRE-CANCERS

Squamous cell carcinoma
• Second most common skin cancer
• Other risk factors include irradiation, chronic ulceration or scarring,
smoking, or exposure to industrial carcinogens
• 5–10% will metastasize, usually to local lymph nodes initially
• Begins as an erythematous, indurated area that becomes hyperkeratotic
and scaly, and may then ulcerate
• Removal is by surgical excision with 5mm margins. Radiotherapy can
be used for recurrence, or in older patients if excision would be hard
(eg on the face)
2May develop in the edge of a leg ulcer.

Malignant melanoma
• Most lethal of skin tumours, readily metastasizing
• Different subtypes include superﬁcial spreading melanoma (most
common; plaque with irregular border and uneven pigmentation),
nodular melanoma (dark pigmented nodule), lentigo maligna melanoma
and acral lentiginous melanoma (pigmented macule in nail beds, palms
and soles)
• Suspect if a pigmented lesion has changed in size or colour, become
irregular in shape, bleeds, itches, or looks inﬂamed
• Early detection is key as the thicker the lesion the worse the outlook
and once metastasized, the disease is fatal—older men often ignore
suspicious-looking skin lesions
• Removal is by surgical excision with wide margins

Other skin lesions
Campbell de Morgan spots
• Small bright red papules on the trunk
• Benign capillary proliferations
• Occur from middle age onwards, almost universal by old age in
Caucasians

Skin tags
•
•
•
•

Pedunculated, benign ﬁbroepithelial polyps
Occur in older patients
Benign, usually multiple, cause unknown
Removal for cosmetic reasons by snipping the stalk with scissors, or
cryotherapy (liquid nitrogen)

Seborrhoeic warts
• Also called basal cell papilloma
• Not infectious
• Oval papules (1–6cm diameter) occurring on the face and trunk of
older patients
• Initially yellow, become darker and more warty in appearance
• Seem to be ‘stuck-on’, usually multiple
• Removal can be done (usually for cosmetic reasons) by cryotherapy or
curettage
• Where concerns exist about more serious pathology, excision biopsy is
performed

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

The ageing immune system
The immune system ages in a complex manner:
• Some activities increase (eg production of memory T lymphocytes, IgA,
and autoantibodies)
• Other activities diminish (eg production of some interleukins,
antibodies in response to foreign antigens, macrophage clearance of
antigens, and complement during acute infection)
• Overall, immune responses become less efﬁcient, less appropriate, and
occasionally harmful with age
• The immune system does not wear out—it becomes dysfunctional
• This is an insidious process, often unnoticed until times of physiological
stress (eg acute illness)
• It is more marked in older people with chronic disease, multiple
comorbidities and signiﬁcant genetic and environmental factors
This immune dysfunction alters the response to infection in older people:
• Infectious disease is a more signiﬁcant cause of morbidity and mortality
in older people (up to 10 times more likely to be the cause of death)
• Impaired cellular immunity predisposes older people to reactivation of
certain diseases eg:
• Shingles (see b ‘Varicella zoster infection’, p.624)
• Tuberculosis (see b ‘Tuberculosis: presentation’, p.336)
• Altered antibody production increases fatality from pneumonia,
inﬂuenza, bacterial endocarditis, and hospital-acquired infections
• Decreased levels of lymphokines increase susceptibility to parasitic
infections
• Age-related immune dysfunction probably has a negative impact of the
course of AIDS in older patients (see b ‘HIV in older people’, p.530)
2Investigations may not show characteristic changes associated with
infection, or these changes may develop more slowly (eg rise in white cell
count, CRP, and complement).
It also has other clinical consequences:
• Increased autoantibody production does not lead to an increase in
autoimmune disease (this peaks in middle age), but may contribute to
degenerative diseases
• Response to vaccination may be less good
• Falling immune surveillance may contribute to higher cancer incidence
• T lymphocyte dysfunction may contribute to the increasing incidence of
monoclonal gammopathy with age (see b ‘Paraproteinaemias’, p.459)
• IgE-mediated hypersensitivity reactions are less frequent, so allergic
symptoms tend to improve with age

608

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Overview of infection in older people
Susceptibility to infection is increased by:
• Immune senescence (see b ‘The ageing immune system’, p.606)
• Altered skin and mucosal barriers
• Acute and chronic illnesses (cause relative immunosuppression)
Blunted response to infection may occur in those with:
• Decreased cardiac adaptation to stress
• Comorbid conditions and frailty
• Decreased lean body mass or malnutrition
• Multiple previous hospital admissions or residence in a long-term care
facility

Presentation
• Frequently atypical eg global deterioration, non-speciﬁc functional
decline, delirium, falls, incontinence
• May initially give no clue to the site of sepsis, eg chest infections may
present with falls, rather than cough
• Fever is often absent, reduced, or delayed (due to senescent
hypothalamic and other responses)
• Often indolent with a slow deterioration over several days
2By the time sepsis is obvious, the patient may be very unwell.

Investigation
Obtaining samples can be difﬁcult, eg delirious uncooperative patient,
urinary or faecal incontinence, inability to expectorate sputum, etc.
Misleading results are common:
• Positive urine dipstick often does not indicate symptomatic infection
(see b ‘Near-patient urine tests’, p.618)
• Urine samples from a catheterized patient will usually be heavily
colonized; dipstick tests will be positive and culture results difﬁcult to
interpret
• Ulcers will usually be colonized and swab results should be interpreted
with caution (see b ‘Leg ulcers’, p.593)
• Abdominal ultrasound scan will often reveal gallstones in older
patients—these are usually asymptomatic and do not necessarily imply
biliary sepsis
• Classical markers of infection (leucocytosis, elevated CRP, increased
complement) may be absent or delayed in older patients. Repeating
them after 24hr improves sensitivity

Treatment
Because of the difﬁculties in making an accurate diagnosis:
• Therapy is often empirical
• Antibiotic failures are more common
• Antibiotic resistance frequently develops
In addition, treatment may be difﬁcult to administer in delirious patients.

OVERVIEW OF INFECTION IN OLDER PEOPLE

HOW TO . . . Accurately diagnose infection in an older
patient
Making an accurate diagnosis with evidence to support it is important to
allow tailored antibiotic therapy. Have a low threshold for considering
sepsis as a cause for decline of any sort, but conversely do not assume
that all problems stem from infection.
Investigations
• Full blood count—white cell count may be elevated, suppressed
(poor prognostic indicator) or be unchanged
• ESR, CRP—often become elevated early on in infection, but this
is very non-speciﬁc and they may take 24–48hr to rise or remain
normal. Serial measurements advised
• U,C +E—septic older patients are prone to renal impairment
• Blood and urine cultures—send before antibiotics are started and
even in the absence of fever
• CXR—a patch of consolidation on an X-ray may be the ﬁrst
indicator that a global deterioration is due to pneumonia
• Consider stool analyses (if diarrhoea)
If the source remains unclear, repeat basic tests, then consider:
• Skin—check carefully for cellulitis and/or ulceration (see b
‘Cellulitis’, p.589)
• Bones—osteomyelitis (particularly vertebral, after joint replacement
or where there is chronic deep ulceration of skin) may present
indolently. Check for bony tenderness and consider X-rays, bone
scans, or MRI (see b ‘Osteomyelitis’, p.488)
• Heart valves—bacterial endocarditis can be very hard to diagnose.
Consider in all with a murmur, and actively exclude in those with
prosthetic heart valves
• Biliary tree—asymptomatic gallstones are common in older
patients, but if an ultrasound also shows dilatation of the gall bladder
or biliary system with a thickened, oedematous wall, then infection is
likely. There is usually (but not always) abdominal pain. Send blood
cultures. ERCP may be needed to remove any obstruction
• Abdomen—diverticulosis is common, and abscesses may present
atypically. Examine for masses and consider abdominal ultrasound or
CT if there is a history of diverticulae or abdominal pain
• Brain—meningitis, brain abscess, and encephalitis may present
indolently in older patients, and the usual warning signs (confusion,
drowsiness) may be misinterpreted. Headache and photophobia may
be late or absent, and neck stiffness difﬁcult to interpret. Consider
CT head followed by CSF analysis if a septic patient has focal
neurology, headache, photophobia, or bizarre behavioural change
• TB—may reactivate in older people and cause chronic infection. If
there is known previous TB (clinical or CXR evidence) then look
very carefully for reactivation. Consider early morning urines, sputum
culture (induced if necessary), bronchoscopy, or biopsy of any
abnormal tissue (eg enlarged lymph nodes)
2Remember that fever and raised inﬂammatory markers can also be
due to non-infectious conditions (eg malignancy, vasculitis, etc.)

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Antibiotic use in older patients
Antibiotics are among the most frequently prescribed drugs, and their
widespread use is promoting increasing antibiotic resistance.
This is a particular problem in older patients where infections are more
common, yet accurate diagnosis can be more difﬁcult.

Antibiotic resistance
Resistance is encouraged by:
• ‘Blind’ antibiotic therapy (where likely microbe and sensitivities are not
known)
• Inappropriate antibiotic therapy (eg for viral respiratory infections)
• Inadequate treatment courses
• Poor concordance with therapy
• Transmission of resistant strains within healthcare settings

Sensible antibiotic prescribing
Helps to limit the problem. Applies to all ages, but may be more of a challenge in older patients:
• Make a diagnosis—identify the source of sepsis (and so possible
pathogens), which will guide therapy before microbiological
conﬁrmation is obtained
• Avoid antibiotics for infections that are likely to be viral, eg pharyngitis,
upper respiratory tract infection
• Where practicable, send samples for culture and sensitivity before
initiating antibiotics
• Local variations (eg diagnostic mix, local sensitivities) should be
considered. Use local antimicrobial guidelines
• Choose the dose based on the patient (allergies, age, weight, kidney
function, etc.) and the severity of the infection. Inadequate doses
promote resistance
• Choose the route—aim for oral wherever possible, and convert
iv therapy to oral as soon as feasible; im antibiotic therapy is
uncomfortable but can be useful (eg cognitively impaired patients who
refuse oral medication)
• Choose the duration based on the type of infection, eg simple UTI can
be adequately treated in 3 days, whereas bacterial endocarditis can
require many weeks of therapy. Unnecessarily long treatment courses
will promote resistance, increase the risk of side effects, complications
(eg CDAD) and increase cost
• Change empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics to narrow-spectrum
alternatives as soon as sensitivities are known

METICILLIN-RESISTANT STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS

Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus
Meticillin was introduced in the 1960s to treat staphylococcal infections.
It was used widely (including spraying solutions into the air on wards) and
initially successfully. Meticillin has now been discontinued and replaced by
ﬂucloxacillin but the term MRSA persists.
Resistance to meticillin gradually emerged—ﬁrstly small numbers within
hospitals, but the problem slowly increased and spread into the community, until globally dispersed epidemic strains emerged.
All staphylococci are easily transmissible, virulent (capacity to cause
disease) and have capacity to develop further antibiotic resistance.

The problem today
• Varies enormously eg >25% of invasive Staph. aureus isolates are
resistant in UK, Spain, and Italy, compared with <1% in Scandinavia
• However, rates peaked in 2005/6 and are now reducing—deaths where
MRSA was mentioned on death certiﬁcates have decreased from
>1600/year to <800/year between 2005 and 2009
• MRSA reduction continues to be a political target in the UK

Contamination and transmission
• Anything coming into contact with an MRSA source can become
contaminated—ie MRSA will exist for a short time on that surface
• Transient carriage on the gloves or hands of healthcare workers is
likely to represent the main mode of transmission to other patients
• Up to 35% of environmental surfaces in a room being used by an MRSA
patient will culture positive (role in transmission is unclear)
• Decontamination involves cleaning. Good hand hygiene and the use of
alcohol hand gel after patient contact reduce transmission signiﬁcantly

Colonization
• This is asymptomatic carriage of MRSA. Patients and families often
need reassurance that this rarely has implications for the patient
• Common sites are anterior nares, perineum, hands, axillae, wounds,
ulcers, sputum, throat, urine, venous access sites and catheters
• Duration of colonization varies from days to years
• Transmission from a colonized person is more likely if there is a
heavy bacterial load with abnormal skin (eg ulcers, eczema), devices
(eg catheters, cannulae) or sinusitis/respiratory tract infection
• Many healthcare workers are colonized (usually nasal) and are a potential
reservoir, but usually colonization is short lived so that screening
healthcare workers is only useful for investigating speciﬁc outbreaks
• Screening for MRSA colonization is now routine practice prior to
elective procedures and for most hospital admissions especially interhospital transfers. Eradication of MRSA may follow; treatment regimens
include the application of nasal mupirocin, antimicrobial soaps and
sometimes oral antibiotics (eg fusidic acid, rifampicin)

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Disease caused by MRSA
The most common sites of infection are:
• Wounds—most common cause of postoperative wound infections
• Intravenous lines—often leading to bacteraemia
• Ulcers—including pressure, diabetic, and venous ulcers
• Deep abscesses—infection can seed to many sites, eg lungs, kidneys,
bones, liver, and spleen
• Bacteraemia—there is compulsory reporting
30–60% of hospital patients colonized with MRSA will go on to develop
infection. This is more likely if there has been:
• Recent prior hospitalization
• Surgery or wound debridement
• Invasive procedures (including venepuncture and venous cannulation)
Infections due to MRSA cause increased morbidity and mortality, longer
hospital stays, and increased cost compared with a susceptible organism.

Management
Infection control measures to reduce the reservoir and lower the rate of
transmission are crucial (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Control MRSA’, p.613).
Antibiotic treatment is necessary when there is active infection—do
not use for colonization, as this will promote drug resistance. Opposing
responsibility to the patient (use the best drug available) and the community (do not promote antibiotic resistance) must be weighed up. The
choice of drug will depend on local resistance patterns and the severity of
the infection. Where possible, wait for sensitivities from microbiology.
Options include:
• Glycopeptide antibiotics (eg vancomycin, teicoplanin)—must be given
intravenously; resistance is emerging
• Co-trimoxazole—useful for susceptible skin, soft tissue and infections
• Fusidic acid, rifampicin, and doxycycline—can be effective, usually given
in combination
• Clindamycin—used for deeper infections, but most UK strains are
resistant
• Fluoroquinolones—eg ciproﬂoxacin. Resistance is rapidly emerging
• Linezolid—an oxazolidinone antibiotic with equivalent potency to
vancomycin. Can be given orally or intravenously. Use with caution
because of high cost and less certain side effect proﬁle (bone marrow
toxicity common, especially with prolonged use)

DISEASE CAUSED BY MRSA

HOW TO . . . Control MRSA
Identify the MRSA type
During an outbreak, the microbiology laboratory will be able to determine if this is a cluster of unrelated cases, or a series of infections by a
single strain—the latter indicating either high transmission rates or an
ongoing reservoir.
Identify the reservoir
• Commonly a patient with a heavily colonized or infected wound
• Healthcare workers may also act as reservoirs
• During an epidemic, it is usual to attempt to eradicate MRSA from
likely reservoir sources (using nasal mupirocin, antimicrobial soap
and oral antibiotics)
Reduce transmission rates
Transmission usually occurs from patient to patient via a healthcare
worker. This is often when hands or gloves are transiently contaminated.
• Hand hygiene is the single most important factor in infection control.
Good hand washing technique and bedside alcohol-based hand gels
should be used by staff, visitors, patients, therapists, volunteers, and
service personnel after touching a patient
• Known MRSA patients should be isolated where possible
• Gloves should be worn on entering and removed before leaving the
room
• Gowns/aprons should be used if contact with the patient or
environment is anticipated, or if the wound is open
• Masks may reduce nasal acquisition by healthcare workers
• Patients should be moved about the hospital as little as possible.
Radiological investigations should be done at the end of a list to
allow cleaning after the test
• Minimize the use of foreign devices (eg catheters, NG tubes)
• Use dedicated equipment (eg stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs,
thermometers), or clean carefully after use
• Active surveillance for MRSA colonization allows these procedures
to be put in place earlier
2By following these guidelines, it is estimated that 70% of transmission
can be prevented

Problems in geriatric care
• Isolation can cause problems with depression and lack of social
stimulation
• Patients and carers may feel stigmatized or scared by the diagnosis
• Rehabilitation may be restricted (eg if the patient is conﬁned to a side
room and cannot visit the physiotherapy gym or practise mobilizing
about the ward)
• It may be difﬁcult to enforce isolation in patients with dementia
• Moving to nursing homes or community facilities may be delayed
(eg while waiting for a side room)

613

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Clostridium difﬁcile-associated
diarrhoea
C. difﬁcile is a Gram-positive, spore-forming, anaerobic bacillus. It was
rarely described before the late 1970s but is now a major hospital acquired
infection. CDAD causes a huge burden of morbidity, mortality and cost,
but incidence has diminished in response to more focused antimicrobial
therapy and effective infection control measures (annual death rate from
CDAD in UK fell from around 6000/year to 4000/year between 2008
and 2009).

Pathogenesis
• Asymptomatic C. difﬁcile carriage occurs in less than 5% of population
• Spores persist for months to years in the environment and are resistant
to many traditional cleaning ﬂuids. Vegetative forms and spores can be
transmitted from patient to patient
• Gastrointestinal carriage is increased in the hospital population, with
advancing age, other bowel disease, cytotoxic drug use and debility
(eg recent surgery, chronic kidney impairment, cancer)
• Most antibiotics reduce the colonization resistance of the colon to
C. difﬁcile.
• CDAD occurs when toxins (A and B) elaborated by C. difﬁcile bind to
the colonic mucosa, causing inﬂammation
• Outbreaks in hospital can occur from cross-infection and can affect
patients never exposed to antibiotics

Features
There is a wide range of manifestations from asymptomatic carriage to
fulminant colitis. Most commonly presents with:
• Foul-smelling watery diarrhoea (mucus common but rarely blood)
• Abdominal pain and distension
• Fever
In severe cases can mimic an ‘acute abdomen’. Occasionally causes chronic
diarrhoea.
2Beware that an acute decline in a patient’s condition (eg fever, delirium
or metabolic disturbance) can precede prominent diarrhoea; have a low
threshold of suspicion in patients with multiple risk factors.

Investigations
• Raised white cell count and inﬂammatory markers (following treatment
of another infection, differential diagnosis includes relapse of the
original infection)
• C. difﬁcile toxin detection by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
is both sensitive and speciﬁc for CDAD colitis. The test can remain positive
for weeks after resolution, so is not useful in diagnosing recurrence
• AXR or CT may show distended, thick-walled large bowel
• Sigmoidoscopy is often normal in mild disease or where colitis
affects proximal bowel. In more severe cases, a characteristic
colitis with pseudomembrane formation is seen (also known as
pseudomembranous colitis)

CLOSTRIDIUM DIFFICILE-ASSOCIATED DIARRHOEA

Complications
Rarely occur, and include toxic megacolon, paralytic ileus, perforation, and
bacteraemia. Older patients requiring surgery have at least 50% mortality.

Relapse
Deﬁned as a second event within 2 months. Occurs in around 20%. Only
rarely due to antibiotic resistance, but can be difﬁcult to treat. Patients
with recurrence are then more prone to further repeated infection.
For repeated infection and recalcitrant CDAD, options include:
• Further oral antibiotics, eg metronidazole, vancomycin, bacitracin
• Adjuvant therapy with colestyramine
• There is very limited evidence that probiotics such as yeast or
lactobacillus help induce and maintain remission
• Intravenous immunoglobulins and steroids have been used in severe
recalcitrant colitis

615

616

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

HOW TO . . . Manage C. difﬁcile infection
Prevention
Use antibiotics wisely (see b ‘Antibiotic use in older patients’, p.610):
• Only when good evidence of infection. Always try to obtain a
microbiological diagnosis and only treat where you have diagnosed
infection or if the patient is gravely ill and conservative management
is judged unsafe
• Use the smallest number of antibiotics with the narrowest-spectrum
possible. Some antibiotics are less likely to cause CDAD
• Use the shortest course possible: 3 days for a simple urinary UTI,
5 days for bronchitis, 10 days or longer for septicaemia, abscess, etc
Treatment
2Have a high index of suspicion—if the patient is ill commence treatment without waiting for conﬁrmatory tests
• Stop antibiotics unless there is very good evidence they need a
longer course
• Suspend concomitant PPIs, iron, and laxatives
• Aggressive rehydration—patients can become very hypovolaemic
even before they start to get diarrhoea
• Start antimicrobials according to local policy, eg metronidazole
400mg tds po or vancomycin 125micrograms qds po. Both drugs
must be enteral to obtain high intraluminal levels. If unable to
swallow consider NG tube or metronidazole PR 1g bd; iv therapy
may be added if septicaemia is suspected
• Continue 7–10 days or until a formed stool
• Stool chart will indicate if diarrhoea frequency is improving
• Use of loperamide (2mg with each loose stool) is controversial—it
may mask response to treatment and increase chances of
complications. However, proponents suggest if the diagnosis is
secure and treatment initiated it can reduce debilitating symptoms
and speed recovery
• Surgical complications may require colectomy
Infection control
• Nurse in side room where possible
• Alcohol gels do not kill spores
• Use gloves and aprons for all contact. Wash hands well with soap
and water
• Clean the environment thoroughly, especially after bed moves
• Patients are much less infectious once diarrhoea has resolved
• Where possible avoid moving infected patients between wards

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Near-patient urine tests
UTI is a common problem in older people, but there is an even higher
prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria and positive urinalysis without
infection. In general, UTI is overdiagnosed.
2It is important to know how to diagnose a UTI correctly, and when to
initiate treatment appropriately.

Near patient urine tests (dipsticks)
Quick, cheap test that is commonly performed. Should only be done on
urine that is collected as described in b ‘HOW TO . . . Sample urine for
dipstick, microscopy, and culture’, p.619.

Urinary nitrite
• Positive result has a high predictive value for UTI
• Many bacteria causing UTI convert urinary nitrate to nitrite, which is
detected on dipstick
• False negatives occur with dilute urine
• Certain bacteria (eg Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus, Enterococcus) may
not convert urinary nitrate, so the dipstick will be negative

Leucocyte esterase
Positive result has a high predictive value for UTI
Lysed white cells release esterase, which is detected on dipstick
Corresponds to signiﬁcant pyuria—may not detect low levels
False-negative results also occur when there is glucose, albumin,
ketones, or antibiotic in the urine
• False positives (‘sterile pyuria’) occur with vaginal contamination,
chronic interstitial nephritis, nephrolithiasis, and uroepithelial
tumours. ‘Sterile’ pyuria can indicate renal tuberculosis and STD
(eg Chlamydia)—consider testing if history suggestive

•
•
•
•

‘Blood’
• Positive result for blood has a low predictive value for infection
• Dipstick does not distinguish red cells from haemoglobin or myoglobin
• Detects red blood cells (blood in the renal tract), haemoglobin (after
haemolysis) and myoglobin (rhabdomyolysis)
• Causes of a positive ‘blood’ dipstick are varied and may be
pre-renal (eg haemolysis), renal (eg tumours, glomerulonephritis),
ureteric (eg stones), bladder (eg tumours, occasionally infection),
urethral (eg trauma) or contamination (eg bleeding from the
vaginal vault)
• Always repeat to ensure the haematuria has resolved with treatment
• Management of persistent isolated dipstick haematuria without
apparent cause is difﬁcult. In a ﬁtter patient, referral for renal tract
investigation by a urologist may be appropriate

NEAR-PATIENT URINE TESTS

Protein
• Positive result has a low predictive value for infection
• Commercial dipsticks generally only detect albumin, and a positive
result implies proteinuric renal disease
• False positives occur in very concentrated or contaminated urine
2The combination of nitrites and leucocyte esterases on urine dipstick
has the highest positive predictive value for infection. If these are negative
and clinical suspicion is high, proceed to urinary microscopy and culture.

HOW TO . . . Sample urine for dipstick, microscopy, and
culture
Do not sample
• Stale urine
• Urine that has been contaminated with faeces
• Urine from a catheter bag
MSU sample
• Ideal sampling method, but may be difﬁcult in confused or immobile
patients
• The external genitalia should be cleaned, a small amount of urine
voided, then the middle portion caught cleanly in a sterile container
• Analysis should be performed while the urine is fresh
In-out catheter sample
• Carries a small risk of introducing infection (around 1%)
• Often well tolerated by older patients
• Discard the ﬁrst urine, and sample the middle portion drained
Suprapubic aspiration of urine
• Rarely done, but will provide a clean specimen
• Clean the skin, and percuss to identify the bladder
• Aspirate with a green needle and 10mL syringe in the midline
Samples from catheterized patients
• These should be sent only if the patient is symptomatic, as the
prevalence of positive dipstick is almost universal, and bacterial
colonization of urine is common
• Clamp the catheter for a period, then collect an MSU sample directly
from the draining tube sampling port
• Do not use stale urine that has collected in the bag

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Asymptomatic bacteriuria
Deﬁned as a positive urine culture in the absence of symptoms of urinary
tract disease.
• It becomes more common with increasing age (5% of communitydwelling females under the age of 60, rising to 30% over the age of 80)
• It is less common in men but again increases with age (<1% of those
under 60, rising to 10% over the age of 80)
• Up to 50% of frail institutionalized patients and almost all catheterized
patients will have bacteria in their urine (see b ‘Catheters’, p.538)
• Other risk factors are as for UTI (see b ‘Urinary tract infection’,
p.621)
• Associated diseases include renal stones, diabetes, and chronic
prostatitis in men

What does it mean?
• Probably represents urinary colonization rather than infection
• No increase in mortality directly associated with asymptomatic
bacteriuria
• Seems to be transient in most—only 6% will grow the same organism
over three sequential cultures, however, it is estimated that around
16% will go on to develop symptomatic UTI

Treatment
No treatment is required for isolated bacteriuria. The use of antibiotics:
• Does not impact on morbidity and mortality
• Does not improve continence
• Promotes antibiotic resistance
In addition, recurrence after antibiotic treatment is common.
2Avoid treating patients unless they have symptoms.

URINARY TRACT INFECTION

Urinary tract infection
Major cause of morbidity and mortality in the older population. UTIs
account for a quarter of infections in healthy older patients, and are the
most common hospital acquired infection. They are the most frequent
cause of bacteraemia in older patients. The annual incidence is up to 10%
for older adults (but many are recurrent).

Risk factors
Advancing age
Female sex (although the gap narrows with age)
Atrophic vaginitis and urethritis in women
Incomplete emptying (eg urethral strictures, prostatic hypertrophy or
carcinoma, neuropathy)
• Abnormalities of the renal tract (eg tumours, ﬁstulae, surgery)
• Foreign bodies (eg catheter, stones)
• Chronic infection (eg renal abscess, prostatitis)
•
•
•
•

Organisms
• Escherichia coli is the most common, as in younger adults
• Older patients are more prone to UTI caused by other pathogens,
including other Gram-negative organisms (eg Proteus, Pseudomonas)
and some Gram-positive organisms (eg group B Streptococcus, MRSA)
• Catheter-related UTI is often polymicrobial and antibiotic resistant

Presentation
The presence of symptoms is essential to make the diagnosis. Urinary
frequency, dysuria (stinging or burning sensation on urinating), and new
urinary incontinence are clear indications of urinary infection, but symptoms may be vague or atypical, and include:
• Fever and general malaise
• Nausea and vomiting
• Confusion or delirium
• Deterioration in physical or functional ability
Infection may be:
• Uncomplicated UTI (normal renal tract and function)
• Complicated UTI (abnormal renal tract, patient debility, virulent
organism, development of complications such as impaired renal function,
bacteraemia, pyelonephritis, and perinephric or prostatic abscess)
• Recurrent UTI (see b ‘Recurrent urinary tract infection’, p.623)
• Catheter-associated UTI (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Treat catheter
complications’, p.540)

Investigations
• Urinalysis—collect sample and perform dipstick (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Sample urine for dipstick, microscopy, and culture’, p.619) and send for
microscopy and culture
2A negative dipstick does not exclude the diagnosis if the clinical suspicion is high. In such cases, send urine for culture.
• If the patient is unwell, consider checking blood tests, including kidney
function (risk of impairment), blood cultures (risk of bacteraemia), full
blood count and inﬂammatory markers

621

622

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Urinary tract infection: treatment
Treatment involves more than just antibiotics. Consider the following:
• Adequate hydration (oral often sufﬁcient, sicker or more confused
patients may require iv ﬂuid)
• Medication review (consider suspending diuretics or drugs that are
potentially nephrotoxic, such as non-steroidals or ACE inhibitors)
• Management of symptoms (eg confusion or immobility may necessitate
increased care at home, or even admission to hospital)
• Assessment for complications (eg pyelonephritis, bacteraemia, abscess
formation). Older patients are at high risk of dehydration and renal
impairment. Consider admission for iv antibiotics and hydration
• Prevention of recurrence with measures such as ensuring good ﬂuid
intake and avoiding catheters if possible. Topical oestrogens (vaginally)
may be useful in postmenopausal women

Antibiotic choice
Be guided by local sensitivity patterns and local guidelines.
Uncomplicated UTI can be treated empirically as follows:
• Trimethoprim 200mg bd (if local resistance is <20%)
• or Co-amoxiclav 375mg tds
• or Nitrofurantoin 50mg qds
• Ciproﬂoxacin 500mg bd is effective, but there are concerns about
emerging resistance and CDAD

Duration of treatment
• Younger women with uncomplicated UTI can be successfully treated
with a short course of antibiotics (3 days, or even a single dose)
• There is limited evidence for the duration required in older patients,
but it is likely that a longer course (5–7 days) is needed

Treatment failure:
Resistant organisms
• Review the results of the urine culture and pathogen sensitivities
• E. coli resistant to ampicillin and sulphonamides is widespread,
and trimethoprim resistance is increasing. Most are susceptible to
nitrofurantoin and ﬂuoroquinolones (eg ciproﬂoxacin) at present,
although ﬂuoroquinolone resistance is increasing
• Pathogens are more varied in older patients and these may not be
susceptible to empirical treatment
• MRSA UTI may occur in older patients (especially with indwelling
catheters), which may require iv therapy (eg vancomycin)
• Candida in the frail, catheterized older patient (seen on microscopy).
• If no culture result is available, and the diagnosis is secure, try an
empirical second-line agent such as co-amoxiclav or ciproﬂoxacin
Incorrect diagnosis
• Delirium and a positive urine dipstick may be misleading. Could the
patient have another pathology?

RECURRENT URINARY TRACT INFECTION

Recurrent urinary tract infection
Deﬁned as >3 symptomatic UTIs in a year, or >2 in 6 months. May represent
either a relapse (recurrent infection caused by original infecting organism)
or a reinfection (infection with different species or strain). Urinary culture
is indicated.

Recurrent infection
This may be due to:
• An ongoing source of infection (eg chronic prostatitis, renal abscess)
• Urological abnormality (eg stones, tumour, residual volume >50mL,
cystocoele)
• Catheterization
• Poor hygiene (eg faecal soiling)
• Impaired immunity (eg diabetes, chronic disease)
• Genetic susceptibility

Treatment of recurrent infection
• Repeat treatment with up to a week of antibiotics
• Remove catheter if possible (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage urinary
incontinence without a catheter’, p.539)
• General measures include increasing ﬂuid intake, treating constipation
• Arrange renal tract ultrasound to look for residual volume and any
urological abnormalities (lower threshold of investigation for males)
• Consider blood tests (eg glucose, renal function, FBC, serum
electrophoresis, PSA in men)

Prevention of recurrent infection
• In postmenopausal women, topical oestrogens (cream, pessary,
oestrogen-releasing vaginal ring) are effective
• Maintain good hydration
• There is some evidence that cranberry juice reduces symptomatic UTI
• Prophylactic antibiotics are rarely indicated. Consider when there are
multiple recurrences despite general measures or signiﬁcant renal
damage. Consider low doses of trimethoprim, nitrofurantoin, or
amoxicillin, dependent on local resistance pattern
• Pre-emptive treatment can be useful in cognitively intact patients.
A short course of antibiotics is held in reserve by the patient, to be
taken when symptomatic

CHAPTER 24

Infection and immunity

Varicella zoster infection
Initial exposure usually occurs in childhood, causing chickenpox. The virus
lies dormant in the sensory dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and can
be reactivated later in life to cause shingles.
Shingles is a painful, self-limiting, unilateral eruption of vesicles in a
dermatomal distribution. It occurs in 20% of the population at some time
but is most common in older people (probably due to a decline in cellmediated immunity with age).

Clinical presentation
• Prodrome of fever, malaise, headache, and sensory symptoms (pain,
tenderness, or paraesthesia) in the dermatome to be affected
• Rash follows after a few days, initially with a cluster of vesicles that
spread across the dermatome and then become pustular
• 50% affect thoracic dermatomes (T5–T12), 16% lumbosacral, and
15–20% cranial nerve distribution
• Usually affects single dermatome, but may involve several adjacent
ones
• Can rarely affect motor nerves, with focal weakness
• Acute herpetic pain is often a feature—may precede the rash by days,
and often described as sharp
• Crusting occurs after about a week, then the patient is no longer
infectious (prior to this, susceptible individuals may catch chickenpox).
• Healing generally occurs within a month, but may leave scars
• Recurrence in around 5%

Treatment
• General measures include adequate oral ﬂuid intake, simple analgesia
(eg paracetamol) and topical agents such as calamine lotion
• Antiviral therapy (eg aciclovir 800mg 5 times a day, famciclovir 250mg
tds, valaciclovir 1g tds) should be given within 72hr of rash onset to
all patients over 50 years old, for a week. It reduces attack severity,
promotes rash healing and reduces incidence of postherpetic neuralgia
• Prednisolone (eg 40mg tailing down over a week) can be given with
antiviral therapy to reduce the severity of the attack, but has limited
value and possible drawbacks (eg increasing bacterial superinfection,
causing signiﬁcant side effects) and should only be used where the
infection is severe
• Analgesia for neuralgia should be given early where indicated

Ophthalmic shingles
• More common in older patients
• Occurs when the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve is
involved, resulting in a rash on the forehead and around the eye
• Ocular involvement commonly occurs, causing a red painful eye.
Inﬂammation of the iris and cornea can cause vision loss, and topical
steroid eye drops are used to limit the inﬂammatory response
• Prompt use of antivirals may limit the disease

VARICELLA ZOSTER INFECTION

Ramsay–Hunt syndrome
• Shingles of several adjacent cranial nerves cause vesicles in the ear
canal, ear pain, and an LMN facial droop
• May also cause vertigo, deafness, and disturbance of taste + lacrimation
2Always look in the ears for vesicles when a patient present with a facial
palsy.
• Facial paralysis is less likely to fully recover than in Bell’s palsy
• Treat with antivirals

Post-herpetic neuralgia
• Distressing sensory symptoms that persist months beyond rash onset
• Occurs in up to 10% of cases
• More common in older patients (up to a third of those >60) who have
sensory symptoms at prodrome and a more severe initial infection
• Subsides in the majority by a year; may become chronic and disabling
• Usually a deep steady burning sensation, sometimes exacerbated by
movement or touch. Occasionally paroxysmal and stabbing
• Can cause signiﬁcant psychological symptoms (low mood, poor sleep,
loss of appetite, etc.)
• Treatment is with tricyclic antidepressants (eg amitriptyline 10–150mg
nocte), opioids, or anticonvulsants (eg gabapentin, carbamazepine,
phenytoin)
• Topical treatments with lidocaine or capsaicin are also effective
• Other options are used in specialist pain clinics, such as iv lidocaine,
intrathecal steroids, or local nerve blocks

Other complications
All the following are more common in older patients:
• Bacterial superinfection (around 2%, can delay rash healing. Treat with
topical antiseptic or antibiotic initially—more severe cases require
systemic treatment)
• Motor neuropathy (occurs when virus spreads to the anterior
horn; symptoms depend on segment affected, eg C5/6 may cause
diaphragmatic paralysis. Majority will recover spontaneously)
• Meningeal irritation (causes headache; occurs in up to 40%; the CSF
shows reactive changes—lymphocytosis and elevated protein)
• Meningitis and encephalitis (rare; diagnosis enhanced by MRI imaging
and CSF PCR. Usually occur with the rash, but may be up to 6 months
later)
• Transverse myelitis (rare; occurs with thoracic shingles)
• Stroke (rare and serious; due to cerebral angiitis)

CHAPTER 25

Malignancy

Malignancy in older people
Cancer is a disease of the elderly population, being relatively rare in people
under 35 years of age, and increasing in incidence with each decade.

Why is there more cancer in older people?
• As more people avoid death from infection and vascular events, so
they remain alive to develop cancer
• Some cancers are caused by cumulative exposure to environmental
agents. A good example would be sunlight and skin cancer, or
smoke and lung cancer, but dietary factors and exposure to other
carcinogens are also likely to contribute over time
• The process of cell replication may senesce, increasing the chance of
malignant change

Is cancer different in older people?
• Development of metastases may appear to be slower, the cancer
overall having a more indolent course, possibly due to altered immune
or hormonal responses
• In contrast, some cancers appear to be more aggressive in older people
(eg acute myeloid leukaemia, Hodgkin’s disease, ovarian carcinoma)
• Overall, age itself has limited inﬂuence over disease progression and
prognosis—factors such as comorbidity and performance status
(Table 25.1) are much more important
• The impact of cancer may be different in an older person. Non-cancer
deaths are common in frail elderly people with malignancy, so cancer
control by non-invasive means (eg tamoxifen for breast cancer) may
be a better option than cancer cure by more unpleasant treatments
(eg surgery)
• Never underestimate the psychological impact of a cancer diagnosis,
whatever the age. Heart failure carries a worse prognosis than many
cancers, yet news of its diagnosis rarely has such an impact. Whatever
your assessment of a person’s quality of life, they may see things very
differently—you will not know until you ask. The adverse reaction
to the diagnosis is often tied up with fears about a slow and painful
death (rather than death itself) and careful explanation about symptom
control measures may allay some concerns

HOW TO . . . Describe performance status
Table 25.1 Performance status scoring
0 Active, no limitations
1 Active, but unable to carry out strenuous or heavy physical work
2 Active, spending less than half the day in bed or resting
3 Spend over half the day in bed or resting, but still able to get up
4 Bedridden

AN APPROACH TO MALIGNANCY

An approach to malignancy
Make the diagnosis
• Even if no curative treatment is possible, a diagnosis allows targeted
symptom control and gives an idea about the likely course of the
disease and the expected prognosis
• Many people ﬁnd ‘not knowing what is wrong’ very hard, and may ﬁnd
a diagnosis a relief, as it allows the future to be planned
• Sometimes a frail patient is obviously dying, and investigations can be
an additional burden, without hope of ﬁnding reversible pathology. In
this case, blind palliation of symptoms is the best course. This should
be combined with careful explanation to the patient and family
• There are many shades of grey in between these two extremes. In
some cases, ﬁnding multiple metastases on a scan may be enough
to plan management. In others, a histological diagnosis by biopsy is
required to fully balance risks and beneﬁts of treatment. Each individual
should have beneﬁts of diagnosis weighed up against discomfort (and
cost) of investigation

Once diagnosis is made, attempt to stage the disease
This allows accurate prognostication and gives the patient better information
on which to base treatment decisions. Again, there are exceptions to this
(eg the very frail who are likely to die from other causes), and each individual
should be considered separately.

Assess patient factors that will inﬂuence outcome
2Age is not one of these factors
• Comorbidity will adversely affect both disease prognosis and tolerance
to treatment
• Functional status is the other main predictor—is the patient active and
asymptomatic, active but with symptoms, slowed down by symptoms
or incapacitated by them? Oncologists use performance status (see
Table 25.1) as an indicator of functional ability and a score of d3
correlates with a median survival of 3 months. Comorbid conditions
and poorer functional status will be more common in older people, but
not universal, so purely age-related treatment decisions are unwise.

Utilize a specialist multidisciplinary approach
Cancer care changes rapidly, and it is hard for the generalist to keep up
to date, so specialist referral is usually needed. Many different specialists
work together in MDTs to provide cancer management, determining the
best options individually. Specialist nurses often perform a coordinating
role in the patient’s journey through the system, providing consistent,
non-threatening support, allowing fears to be discussed and providing
practical help (eg arranging additional help at home).

Discuss decisions carefully with the patient
Some patients who have led a long and healthy life (and so would potentially do well from therapy) may wish simply to die without being ‘messed
about’. Other patients with multiple problems and poorer outlook may
take any chance at a prolongation of life whatever the cost.

629

630

CHAPTER 25

Malignancy

Presentation of malignancy
In a cognitively intact and physically ﬁt older patient with a malignancy,
presentation is often typical—eg a breast lump, a thyroid nodule, altered
bowel habit with an iron deﬁciency anaemia. In these cases, there is little
dilemma—management is as for all patients with such a complaint.
In the frail elderly person, the presentation is often less clear. Cancer
may be found incidentally (eg a mass on a routine CXR) or there may be
a highly suggestive clinical scenario. Judging how hard to look and to what
end is a common challenge in geriatric practice.

Common presenting scenarios include
Weight loss without apparent cause
• Always check a dietary history (and corroborate it with family or
friend), measure thyroid function, screen for depression, and assess
cognitive state
• If there are no localizing symptoms or signs on careful history or
examination, then check screening investigations (see b ‘HOW TO . . .
Screen for malignancy’, p.631)
• If these are normal, then malignancy is relatively unlikely, and dietary
support with reassessment at an interval may be appropriate (see b
‘HOW TO . . . Manage weight loss in older patients’, p.357)
• Following up hints offered in a systems enquiry (eg admits to occasional
loose stool) will depend on the individual patient—whether they
would tolerate bowel investigation, whether they would be ﬁt for
treatment if malignancy is found and, crucially, what they wish to do
Elevated inﬂammatory markers (ESR, CRP)
• This is a relatively common scenario
• Begin with the screening history, examination and investigations
• An important differential diagnosis is sepsis, and this should be actively
sought with cultures and appropriate tests such as echocardiogram
• Consider giving the patient a thermometer and temperature chart to
ﬁll in
• Look at joints and bones as a possible source (gout, septic arthritis,
discitis, osteomyelitis, etc.)
• Remember diverticular and sub-diaphragmatic abscesses
• Have a low threshold for thinking of endocarditis (see b ‘Overview of
infection in older people’, p.608)
• Vasculitides (especially see b ‘Giant cell arteritis’, p.474) should be
considered and a trial of steroids may be appropriate, even if the
history is not convincing, but remember to check response and rethink
the diagnosis if the blood results do not normalize
• A CT scan of the thorax, abdomen and pelvis (looking for
lymphadenopathy) may be justiﬁed if the patient is otherwise ﬁt and
has signiﬁcantly abnormal tests
• Chasing mildly elevated markers in the frail elderly person is often
unrewarding, and can be very distressing for the patient. If initial
assessment is unhelpful, watchful waiting my be a valid approach

PRESENTATION OF MALIGNANCY

Anaemia
• Iron deﬁciency anaemia should always raise the query of
gastrointestinal malignancy, and investigation tailored to the individual
situation (see b ‘Iron deﬁciency anaemia: diagnosis’, p.454)
• A normochromic normocytic anaemia with normal haematinics
is rather more difﬁcult—it may represent anything from mild
myeloﬁbrosis or renal failure to disseminated malignancy
• Screening history, examination, and tests should be performed. If
normal, then a decision about suitability for bone marrow biopsy needs
to be made on an individual patient basis. Does the patient have a
reasonable life expectancy? Would treatments (eg chemotherapy) be
appropriate if haematological malignancy was conﬁrmed?

HOW TO . . . Screen for malignancy
History
Should include:
• Dietary history
• Mood assessment
• History of fevers and night sweats
• Travel history
• HIV risk factor assessment (if appropriate)
• Full systems enquiry (especially meticulous enquiry into
gastrointestinal symptoms and postmenopausal bleeding)
Examination
Full examination required, including:
• Lymphadenopathy
• Skin nodules or rashes (expose the patient fully)
• ENT
• Male external genitalia (testicular masses)
• Female breast and pelvic examination
• Rectal examination
• Thyroid examination
Investigations
• FBC with ﬁlm; and haematinics
• Urea and electrolytes
• LFTs
• Calcium and phosphate
• Glucose
• TFTs
• ESR and CRP
• Urine and blood electrophoresis
• Urinalysis (dipstick for blood)
• CXR
• Faecal occult bloods (if anaemic)
• PSA in men
2Tumour markers have a role in monitoring of established disease, but
are controversial in screening—false positive rates are high.

631

632

CHAPTER 25

Malignancy

Treating malignancy in older people
Overall, the response to treatment is as good in ﬁt elderly people as in
younger patients. Frailty and comorbidity will alter tolerance to treatments
more than age. There are specialist MDTs for cancer care that should help
to ensure that the most appropriate treatment modalities are considered.
Any treatment should be discussed (where possible) with the patient, outlining beneﬁts, potential harm, and practical considerations (such as travelling daily to the hospital for a course of treatment, or supplying support
for activities of daily living when weakened by therapy).
2Decisions about cancer treatment should not be based on chronological age, rather on biological age, functional status, and the presence of
comorbid conditions.
The patient should be at the centre of the decision-making process—
decisions are rarely clear-cut and require balancing of the side effects of
therapy against potential beneﬁts. Frank discussion of what to expect
should facilitate patient-led decisions, and there will be a wide variety of
choices. Some older people will wish to avoid interventions while others
will accept a high level of discomfort for the chance of a few extra months
of life. Ask the patient.
• Surgery can be well tolerated if the patient is pre-selected and receives
optimal attention before, during, and after an operation. Curative
operations should always be considered regardless of age and even
palliative surgery may be appropriate, eg in a frail octogenarian,
defunctioning colostomy for a sigmoid tumour may be preferable to
constant diarrhoea that causes skin breakdown
• Radiotherapy is well tolerated by ﬁt elderly people, and side effects may
be acceptable to even the more frail if the beneﬁts are sufﬁcient. It is
often pragmatic issues such as prolonged daily travel to the hospital
that is the most difﬁcult for an older person, perhaps worse than
the treatment itself. Hospital transport may mean an early start, a
late ﬁnish, and an uncomfortable journey. These problems should be
discussed prior to treatment and psychosocial support offered where
possible
• Hormonal therapy is often very useful in older people, being well
tolerated and effective. It forms the mainstay of treatment for
postmenopausal women with breast cancer and for men with prostate
cancer. Its role is in disease control, not cure, but is often provides very
effective palliation until they die from another cause
• Chemotherapy agents are improving all the time, being better tolerated
and more effective. Cardiac comorbidity can cause problems with the
amount of ﬂuid that is required. Social isolation can make transport
to and from treatments and managing the side effects difﬁcult.
Recognition of this and provision of support is essential if treatment
is considered

TREATING MALIGNANCY IN OLDER PEOPLE

HOW TO . . . Manage symptomatic hypercalcaemia
Older patients often present with acute confusion and constipation; the
classical symptoms of thirst, itch, and bone pain may be less prominent.
2Important to check serum calcium for any unexplained confusion or
constipation.
2Beware hypoalbuminaemia which can mask a high calcium—always
check the corrected calcium level
If corrected calcium is high, send off a PTH level and screen
for tumours. Commonest malignant causes include myeloma and
carcinomatosis with bone secondaries (eg prostate or breast) and
squamous carcinoma of the lung (where calcitonin-like substances are
excreted). Commonest benign cause is hyperparathyroidism.
Management
1. Rehydration with intravenous ﬂuids—aim for 3–4L/day (but more
cautious in heart failure)
2. Once patient is rehydrated, give furosemide 20–40mg with each
bag as this promotes urinary calcium excretion and prevents ﬂuid
overload
3. Monitor calcium daily and adjust treatment
In malignant disease, consider:
• Intravenous bisphosphonates, eg pamidronate
• Steroids, eg prednisolone 30mg/day or dexamethasone 2–4g/day
Work by slowing tumour turnover. Can cause confusion or
hyperglycaemia
• Speciﬁc tumour therapy (eg antiandrogens for prostate carcinoma,
radiotherapy for myeloma) but localized therapies seldom inﬂuence
serum calcium levels
• There is a group of patients with malignant hypercalcaemia who
respond to treatment but relapse as soon as iv ﬂuids are stopped.
If all avenues of treatment have been tried a palliative approach is
sometimes appropriate in which the calcium is allowed to rise and
only symptoms are treated
• In hyperparathyroidism, consider parathyroidectomy
• Management of the confused hypercalcaemic patient:
• Can be particularly difﬁcult especially as patients often pull out iv
cannulae
• Consider opiate analgesia (there may be bone pain which the
patient cannot tell you about)
• Benzodiazepine sedation may be required

633

634

CHAPTER 25

Malignancy

Cancer with an unknown primary
Cancer with an unknown primary makes up around 2% of all malignancy
diagnoses, but this proportion increases with age because older patients
may have less speciﬁc and less aggressive presentation. They also tend
to seek medical attention less promptly. Presentation is with metastases,
usually in liver, lungs, bones, or lymph nodes.
Finding metastases during investigation for vague symptoms or when
looking into more speciﬁc problems (such as bone pain, abnormal liver
function tests, breathlessness, enlarged lymph nodes etc.) is a commonly
encountered problem in geriatric practice, and a structured approach to
management is essential.

Aetiology
• After biopsy, 70% of cancers with an unknown primary are is found to
be adenocarcinoma, 15–20% poorly differentiated carcinomas, and 10%
poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma
• The primary becomes clear in only 20% after investigation
• At postmortem, 40–50% are found to be pancreatic, hepatobiliary or
lung, and most of the remainder are from the gastrointestinal tract
while 20–30% still do not have a primary identiﬁed

Approach to investigation
Sometimes, once metastatic cancer is identiﬁed, no further investigations
are appropriate—eg if the patient is frail and asymptomatic, or if death
is very near. In most cases, however, there is something to be gained by
determining the primary and extent of metastases—ranging from (very
rare) cure, through prolongation of life (eg for hormonally sensitive
tumours), to the targeted palliation of symptoms.
Treatment has been greatly advanced by obtaining biopsy samples
and using immunohistochemical techniques to improve diagnosis and
recognising clinical syndromes that can predict responses to certain
chemotherapy combinations.
Arrange the following:
• Careful history and examination (including thyroid, breast, pelvis in
women and a rectal examination) looking for hints of the primary
• Blood tests, including FBC, U,C+E, LFTs, calcium, phosphate, LDH, and
PSA.
• Tumour markers (CEA, CA 15-3, CA 19-9, CA125, A-fetoprotein,
B-human chorionic gonadotrophin) are not useful in diagnosis or
prognosis, but may be used to monitor response to any treatment
• Urinalysis
• Faecal occult bloods (×3)
• CXR
• Consider thyroid ultrasound
• Consider mammogram (in women)
• Abdominal CT scan—identiﬁes the primary site in 10–35% and shows
additional metastatic sites
2Further radiological or endoscopic investigation is rarely helpful, often
uncomfortable and a poor use of resources.

CANCER WITH AN UNKNOWN PRIMARY

Biopsy specimens
• Should usually be obtained if possible (radiology may show the best
site). Information from biopsy assists greatly in further management.
• Occasionally there will be histological hints as to the primary source
(eg signet rings in the glandular cells indicating gastric cancer), but more
commonly there is not enough differentiation to allow diagnosis.
• Immunohistochemical stains have helped considerably, and there are
speciﬁc stains for prostate, thyroid, and bronchogenic adenocarcinoma
and stains highly suggestive of a breast primary.
• Combinations of stains (eg CEA, CA 19-9, CA 125, cytokeratins, breast
cancer antigen) may reveal patterns that suggest the primary but these
are less speciﬁc.

Prognosis
Prognosis is better if:
• Fewer metastases
• Metastases only in lymph nodes and soft tissues (less good if bones or
liver involved)
• Certain histological sub-types
• Female patient, with few comorbidities, and a good performance status
• Normal serum lactate dehydrogenase level
2It is unrelated to age.

Treatment options
Women with peritoneal metastases
• Usually ovarian or other gynaecological cancer
• Some show extremely good response to chemotherapy, with 15–20%
long-term remission in papillary serous carcinoma
Women with axillary lymph node metastases
• Usually breast cancer
• Investigate with mammogram and MRI breasts if negative
• Even if no breast lesion found, treat as breast cancer in the
standard way
• Involvement of axillary nodes only means potentially curable disease
(by mastectomy, node clearance, and radiotherapy)
Bone metastases
• In men these are usually from prostate cancer (especially if sclerotic
or blastic metastases) and elevated PSA may conﬁrm this. Standard
hormonal treatment for prostate cancer often provides effective
palliation
• Lung cancer is the other common cause, with liver, kidney, thyroid, and
colon being rarer primary sources
Single metastatic focus in brain, lung, adrenal, liver, bone or lymph node
• Occasionally actually an unusual primary
• Usually will metastasize to other sites fairly quickly
• Consider surgical resection
• Radiotherapy for a solitary brain metastasis can occasionally produce
long-term survival

635

636

CHAPTER 25

Malignancy

None of the above
• Empirical chemotherapy (based on histology and clinical syndrome)
produces some response in around 40%, and a good response in
around 10%
• Overall, there is up to 20% 3-year survival with treatment (median
survival around 10 months)

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Breaking bad news
Geriatricians frequently break bad news. No matter how old and frail the
patient, the news can always come as a devastating blow. Equally, news
that may seem bad may be taken well—someone who has felt unwell for
ages may welcome an explanation, even if it means a terminal diagnosis.
Sometimes they will have been expecting worse (‘I’ve had a stroke? Thank
God it isn’t cancer’).
2Each case needs to be considered individually and carefully modiﬁed as
reactions become apparent.

Who should be told bad news?
• Information about a patient’s diagnosis and prognosis belong to the
patient, and that individual has a right to know. The paternalistic
tendency to ‘protect’ a patient or their relatives from bad news is now
largely obsolete, but some patients and relatives still believe this exists
and this may need to be corrected
• Very often, fears that an older person will not cope with bad news
are unfounded. They may not have asked questions because they are
not culturally used to quizzing doctors, but will often have an idea
that something is wrong. Anxieties about remaining family members
(particularly spouses) can be addressed once everyone knows a
patient’s diagnosis and management plan. Open dialogue may ease
distress
• Equally, there are some older people who simply do not wish to know
details about diagnosis and prognosis, preferring to trust others to
make decisions for them. It is inappropriate to force information on
such patients and crucial to identify them. Approaches range from
blunt questioning—‘If you turn out to have something serious, are
you the sort of person who likes to know exactly what is going on?’
to a more subtle line—‘We have some test results back, and your
daughter is keen to talk to me about them. Would you like to know
about them too?’ The response to this is usually informative—either
‘Yes, of course I want to know’ or ‘Oh, well I’d rather let my daughter
deal with all that’
• Well-meaning relatives (usually children, who are more used to
challenging authority) may be more proactive in seeking information
than the patient, and then try to shield their relative from the truth,
believing that they would not be able to cope. In such situations, try
to avoid giving information to relatives ﬁrst—explain that you cannot
discuss it with them without the patient’s permission. Be sympathetic—
these wishes are usually born from genuine concern. Explore why they
don’t want news told, and encourage reality—the patient knows that
they are unwell and must have had thoughts about what is wrong. Point
out that it becomes almost impossible to continue to hide a diagnosis
from a patient in a deteriorating condition and that such an approach
can set up major conﬂicts between family and carers. Be open—tell the
relative that you are going to talk to the patient, and promise discretion
(ie you will not force unwanted information). A joint meeting can be
valuable if the patient agrees. They may be right, and the patient does
not want to be told, but establish this for yourself ﬁrst and always get
permission from the patient before disclosing details to anyone else

BREAKING BAD NEWS

HOW TO . . . Break bad news
1. Make an appointment and ensure that there will be no
interruptions
2. Ensure that you are up to date on all the latest information—
about the disease itself and the latest patient condition. (Have you
seen them that morning?)
3. Talk in pleasant, homely surroundings away from busy clinical
areas
4. Ensure that you are appropriately dressed (eg not covered in
blood from a failed resuscitation attempt)
5. Suggest that family members or friends come along to support
6. Invite other members of the MDT (usually a nurse) who are
involved in the patient’s care
7. Begin with introductions and context (‘I am Dr Brown, the doctor
in charge of your mother’s care since arriving in the hospital. This
is Staff Nurse Green. I already know Mrs. Jones but perhaps I
could also know who everyone else is?’). It is sometimes useful to
make some ‘ice-breaking’ non-medical comments (eg ‘How was
the journey?’), but do not be ﬂippant
8. Establish what is already known (‘A lot has happened here today—
perhaps you could begin by telling me what you already know?’ or
in a non-acute setting ‘When did you last speak to a doctor?’)
9. Set the scene and give a ‘warning shot’. (‘Your mother has been
unwell for some time now, and when she came in today she had
become much more seriously ill’ or ‘I’m afraid I have some bad
news’)
10. Use simple jargon-free language to describe events, giving ‘bitesized’ chunks of information, gauging comprehension and response
as you go
11. Avoid euphemisms—say ‘dead’ or ‘cancer’ if that is what you mean.
Avoid false reassurances and platitudes
12. Allow time for the news to sink in—long silences may be
necessary; try not to ﬁll them because you are uncomfortable
13. Allow time for emotional reactions, and reassure in verbal and
non-verbal ways that this is an acceptable and normal response
14. Encourage questions
15. Do not be afraid to show your own emotions, while maintaining
professionalism—strive for genuine empathy
16. Summarize and clarify understanding if possible. If you feel that the
message has been lost or misinterpreted, ask them to summarize
what they have been told, allowing reinforcement and correction.
Complex medical terms are usefully written down to take away
and show to relatives or look up
17. Someone should stay for as long as is needed, and offer
opportunity for further meeting to clarify questions that will come
up later
18. Document your meeting carefully in the medical notes

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Bereavement
Common experience in older people—causes huge psychological morbidity. A quarter of older widowers/widows develop clinical anxiety and/
or depression in the ﬁrst year.
2The grieving process is amenable to positive and negative inﬂuences, so
awareness of those at risk can help target care.

Normal stages of grief
Not linear—often go back and forth between stages.
• Shock/denial: lasts from minutes to days. Longer if unexpected death.
Resolves as reality is accepted
• Pining/searching: feel sad, angry, guilty, vulnerable; urge to look back
and search for the dead person; restless, irritable, and tearful. Loss
of appetite and weight. Poor short-term memory and concentration.
Resolved by feeling pain and expressing sadness. May be hampered by
social or cultural pressures to behave in a certain way
• Disorganization/despair: feel life has no meaning. Tend to relive events
and try to put it right. Common to experience hallucinations of the
deceased when falling asleep (reassure that this is normal). Resolves as
adjust to the new reality without the deceased
• Reorganization: begin to look forward and explore a new life without
the deceased. Find things to carry forward into the future from the
past. May feel guilt and need reassurance. Period of adjustment
• Recurrence: grief may recur on anniversaries, birthdays, etc.

Abnormal grief
Hard to deﬁne as everyone is different (both individual and cultural variability) and the process cannot be prescribed. In general, weight is regained
by 3–4 months, interest is regained after several more months, and the
beginnings of recovery have usually been recognized by 2 years.

Risk factors for abnormal grief
These include:
• Sudden or unexpected loss
• Low self-esteem or low social support
• Prior mental illness (especially depression)
• Multiple prior bereavements
• Ambivalent or dependent relationship with the deceased
• Having cared for the deceased in their ﬁnal illness for more than
6 months
• Having fewer opportunities for developing new interests and
relationships after the death
Although older people are generally more accepting of death than
younger people, they commonly have a number of these risk factors (eg an
80-year-old man who has cared for his demented wife for 3 years prior to
her death, is likely to have had an ambivalent relationship as well as being her
carer. He may have limited social support and opportunity for alternative
social contacts).
2Older widowers have the highest rate of suicide among all groups of
bereaved persons

BEREAVEMENT

HOW TO . . . Promote a ‘healthy bereavement’
• Identify those at risk of abnormal grief (see b ‘Risk factors for
abnormal grief’, p.640)
• Encourage seeing the body after death if wished
• Encourage involvement in funeral arrangements
• A visit by the GP after death to answer questions, or a meeting with
the hospital team can be very helpful
• Good social support initially is crucial and professional/voluntary
groups (eg CRUSE at M www.crusebereavementcare.org.uk) or
counsellors can be helpful if family/friends are not present
• There needs to be permission for ‘time out’ and reassurance that they
are experiencing a normal reaction
• As time goes on, setting small goals for progressive change can
structure recovery
For the confused, older patient, repeated explanations, and supported
involvement in the funeral and visiting the grave have been shown to
reduce repetitive questioning about the whereabouts of the deceased.

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Palliative care
Death is inevitable. Physicians should acknowledge their limitations, not
seeing every death as a personal or system failure. Society has a misperception that medical technology can always postpone death—this should
be addressed, and death portrayed when appropriate as a natural and
inevitable end.
Palliative care is concerned with the holistic management of a patient
in whom death is likely to be soon and where curative treatments are
no longer possible. It aims to help the patient (and relatives) come to
terms with death while optimizing the quality of the time left. It involves
an MDT approach, with attention to relief of physical symptoms and to
social, psychological, spiritual, and family support.
Traditionally used in cases of incurable cancer (where a diagnosis has
often been made and a prognosis given), the approach is valuable in many
other situations. Death from, eg end-stage heart failure is as predictable as
death from cancer, yet application of palliative care measures is less frequent.
Discussing impending death with a patient is often difﬁcult for doctor and
patient, but it allows the goals to shift from hopeless (patient cure) to
realistic and achievable (planning a good death). With the complexity of
illness in older people, deciding when death is inevitable can be difﬁcult and
there is often a degree of uncertainty—not least about timescale—but the
rewards to the patient and carers are many.
Most people die not in a hospice, but in other settings—sometimes
an acute hospital but more typically in a community-based facility (eg a
community hospital or care home) or their own home. The challenge
that health professionals often face is to deliver the more desirable
characteristics of hospice care in a less specialist setting. That is usually
achievable—primary and secondary care teams have huge experience and
skills in caring for the dying patient, reinforced when necessary by specialist
palliative care teams. But patients and families often need reassurance that
exemplary end-of-life care can be delivered outside the hospice setting, in
all but the most challenging cases.

General principles of palliative care
• All symptoms should be evaluated and a diagnosis made, based on
probability and pattern recognition
• Explanation of cause and planned treatment empowers the patient and
keeps expectations realistic
• Treatment involves correcting what can be corrected (eg treating oral
candida that is contributing to anorexia), counselling to help patients
accept the limitations imposed by the disease (eg a patient with COPD
may never be able to walk in the garden, but supplying a wheelchair
will allow them to be taken), and drugs to control symptoms
• Treatment is planned for each individual with careful attention to detail.
Effects are monitored closely, and treatment discontinued if ineffective

PALLIATIVE CARE

At the very end
• Basic care should always be continued (warmth, comfort, shelter,
freedom from pain, cleanliness, symptom control, offer of oral nutrition,
and hydration)
• ‘Artiﬁcial’ nutrition and hydration (ie that which bypasses swallowing) is
considered by many to be a treatment, and as such may be withheld
• Simplify medications. Use subcutaneous routes where appropriate
• Communication with the patient and family becomes even more
important—continue regular visits, even if there is no apparent change
• Ask nurses and family about concerns they have (eg pain on turning)
• Enlist help from specialist palliative care teams if symptom control is
difﬁcult
• A proactive, positive approach at this time can transform the
experience of losing a relative

The principle of double effect
Sometimes treatments given to relieve symptoms can worsen the
underlying disease, eg opiates given for pain also cause respiratory
depression.
It is not a duty of the physician to prolong life at all costs. The British
Medical Association states: ‘A single act having two possible foreseen
effects, one good and one harmful, it is not always morally prohibited if
the harmful effect is not intended.’ In other words, if the primary aim of
the morphine is to relieve pain, and a secondary (foreseen) consequence
of this is respiratory depression and death, then the primary aim justiﬁes
the secondary consequence.
Good communication with family and other members of the team
ensures that everyone understands the rationale behind a treatment
plan.
The Liverpool Care Pathway for the Dying Patient (LCP) is used
increasingly in the UK. It lays out systematically the elements of care that
may form part of best quality care of a patient in the last hours or few
days of life.
Such a pathway may be appropriate when the MDT (often comprising
an experienced nurse and doctor) is agreed that a patient will inevitably
die in the near future (ie that reversible causes have been excluded).
Where there is doubt, a second opinion is often helpful.

643

644

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Symptom control in the terminally ill
2Is delivered usually by general primary and secondary care teams, not by
palliative care specialists.

Pain
• Use the analgesia ladder, starting with non-opioids (paracetamol, NSAIDs)
• Next, add weak opioids (codeine, dihydrocodeine, tramadol); escalate
the dose then replace with strong opioids (eg morphine slow release).
Give regularly and treat all side effects (nausea, constipation)
• Aim to give orally if possible, but consider subcutaneous bolus/infusion,
transdermal or rectal routes if necessary
• Identify likely cause(s)—there may be different pains with different
causes in one individual—and target treatment to cause
• Neuropathic pain is often opioid responsive, but antidepressants and
anticonvulsants can be added
• Treat muscle spasm with physiotherapy, heat, antispasmodics and
benzodiazepines
• Treat nerve compression pain with steroids

Nausea and vomiting
• Identify cause—is it reversible? (eg medication, hypercalcaemia, bowel
obstruction)
• Give small portions of palatable food, avoid strong smells
• Use regular antiemetics:
• Metoclopramide is indicated when there is gastritis, stasis and
functional bowel obstruction
• Cyclizine is used with raised intracranial pressure and functional
bowel obstruction
• Haloperidol treats chemical causes such as hypercalcaemia
• Domperidone
• Ondansetron

Constipation
• Start with a stimulant laxative (eg senna) or stool softener if not on
opiates depending on stool characteristics
• Opiates cause decreased peristalsis; a stimulant laxative is usually
appropriate
• Danthron-containing stimulant laxatives are banned in all but terminal
care, as they may be carcinogenic. They also cause skin burns so are
usually avoided in incontinent patients
• Suppositories, enemas or digital evacuation may be needed

SYMPTOM CONTROL IN THE TERMINALLY ILL

Anorexia
• Normal in advanced cancer, and other conditions as death approaches
• Family concerns may be the main problem—they may feel their relative
is giving up
• Deal with this directly—eating more will not alter the outlook and
pressurizing the patient can make them miserable
• Decrease medications that cause nausea or anorexia (opiates, SSRIs)
• Give good mouth care
• Help with feeding if weak
• Offer frequent small meals
• Prokinetics (eg metoclopramide) or steroids (prednisolone,
medroxyprogesterone) may help

Dyspnoea
• Treat cause (transfuse for anaemia, drain effusion, etc.)
• A terrifying symptom—plan approach for how to deal with an attack
without panicking
• Oxygen can help, as can an anxiolytic or opiates, fresh air or fans, and
physiotherapy if mucus retention is an issue

Confusion
• Identify cause (infection, drugs, withdrawal from alcohol, electrolyte
imbalances)
• Nurse in calm, well-lit environment. Relatives can often help with
reorientation
• Drugs (eg haloperidol, benzodiazepines) should be used only when
non-drug measures have proven ineffective

Dehydration
• Dying patients drink less (weakness, nausea, decreased level of
consciousness) but often do not feel thirsty
• Good mouth care is all that is required where the decreased intake is
part of the dying process and the patient is not distressed by thirst
• Reassure relatives (and staff) that it is the disease that is killing the
patient, not the dehydration

‘Death rattle’
• The patient is usually unaware. Reassure the family of this
• If excess secretion is causing distress or discomfort to the patient or
the family, use hyoscine butylbromide, hyoscine hydrobromide, or
glycopyrronium (available subcutaneously or as patches)

645

HOW TO . . . Prescribe a subcutaneous infusion for
palliative care
Is the subcutaneous route appropriate?
• Use regular oral route where possible
• Consider when:
• Vomiting/nausea/malabsorption
• Difﬁculty swallowing, eg near the end or if semi-conscious

Is the patent already on an opiate?
• Calculate the current total dose given per 24hr (including prn
administration)
• Has this been adequate? (Ask nurses, family, and patient)
• Convert the oral opiate dose to an equivalent parental dose
(see BNF), eg morphine sulphate MR 20mg bd is equivalent to
diamorphine 15mg s/c per 24hr
• If starting strong opiates de novo, start low (eg 1mg/hr morphine with
allowances on the prn side for breakthrough pain)
• Morphine is cheaper and more readily available, but diamorphine is
more soluble so can be given in a smaller infusion volume and is less
likely to precipitate with multiple other drugs. Morphine has about
2/3 potency of diamorphine



Are there any other symptoms?
• Other agents can be added to the pump
• Eg metoclopramide for nausea (30–60mg/24hr)
• Hyoscine hydrobromide for respiratory secretions (0.6–2.4mg/24hr)
• Haloperidol for nausea, restlessness and agitation (5–15mg/24hr)
• Midazolam for sedation (10–60mg/24hr)

Write the prescription
• How large are the infusion pumps on the ward? (Usually 10mL or 50 mL)
• Are the components compatible with each other, and water for
injection eg diamorphine 30mg + haloperidol 5mg made up to 10mL
with water for injection, run in s/c syringe driver over 24hr

Reassess every 4–6hr
• Do not wait for 24hr
• Check whether there has been good symptom control—if not, increase
the dose
• Check for side effects (eg drowsiness)—consider decreasing the
opiate or benzodiazepine dose
• Check whether any prn doses have been used—add these to the
next total dose you prescribe

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Documentation after death
Veriﬁcation of death
This is the conﬁrmation that death has occurred and may be performed
by an appropriately trained doctor, nurse, or paramedic before a body can
be moved to the mortuary. It is recommended that you look for:
• Absence of response to pain/stimulation
• Fixed dilated pupils
• Absence of a pulse, heart sounds, respiratory movements and breath
sounds (check for at least 30sec)
Some of these tests can be done simultaneously to save time. Always
record your ﬁndings in full along with the time of death, persons present,
and the time of veriﬁcation.

Certiﬁcation of death
This is the writing of a death certiﬁcate. It is an important duty and
legal requirement of the doctor that has recently been looking after the
patient—it allows the family to arrange a funeral and provides very important statistics for disease surveillance and public health.
• Inexperienced doctors tend to record the mechanism of death rather
than the underlying cause, which may lead to under-representation of
the real pathology in national statistics. Patients die of dementia and
stroke although their complications, eg aspiration pneumonia may be
the last thing that was treated
• Always record as much information as possible, eg:
Ia Aspiration pneumonia
Ib Left total anterior circulation infarction
Ic Non-insulin dependant diabetes, atrial ﬁbrillation
II Parkinson’s disease, peripheral vascular disease
is more informative than:
Ia Pneumonia
Ib Stroke
• Be as precise as possible. For example:
• When stating cardiac/renal/liver ‘failure’, qualify it with a more
precise cause (eg heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease)
• When a patient died of a septicaemic syndrome, where possible
state the causative organism and source (eg ‘Escherichia coli
bacteraemia due to ascending urinary tract infection’)
• Old age is an acceptable cause of death in the very elderly person who
has had a non-speciﬁc decline and reasonable assessments to exclude
serious treatable disease
• Use section II to record other diagnoses, which are often multiple in
older people. Multiple causes can be stated on one line
• You must have seen the patient alive during their recent illness (usually
in the last 2 weeks) to write a certiﬁcate—sometimes the GP writes
a certiﬁcate for a hospital patient and vice versa if the patient has
recently moved between sites
• The process of death certiﬁcation is currently being reformed in the
UK to incorporate a medical ofﬁcer who will issue all certiﬁcates in a
locality

DOCUMENTATION AFTER DEATH

Cremation forms
There are two parts to a cremation form, completed by different doctors
who should not be related or work on the same team. You must have
looked after the patient in their terminal illness to complete Part I. If you
do not know the patient well, examine the body, the CXR, and the ECG
for evidence of a pacemaker.
In contrast, a Part II doctor should not have known the patient and
is required by law to be an impartial examiner of the case before the
evidence (the body) is cremated. You must be a senior doctor (2 years
post-MRCP/FRCS) to complete Part II. Ensure that you have seen the
medical notes, and have personally questioned the Part I doctor and
one other person who knew the deceased (another doctor, nurse or
relative). If there are problems with the certiﬁcate or the Part I they can
be corrected or reissued. Sometimes you may need to suggest the case is
discussed with the coroner.
Following the UK scandal surrounding Dr Shipman in which cremation
forms did not highlight a problem, the government is reviewing the
protocols surrounding death and cremation. Cremation forms in their
current iteration are likely to disappear.

649

650

CHAPTER 26

Death and dying

Other issues after death
Bereavement services
• Most hospitals now have a bereavement ofﬁce that coordinates
the paperwork required after a death and provide the family with
information about registration and funeral arrangements.
• Bereavement ofﬁcers provide a friendly, easily accessible interface
between the hospital and relatives and can refer to voluntary
bereavement support groups
• Consent for hospital postmortem may be obtained or coordinated by
bereavement ofﬁcers
• If no family comes forward or if they are incapable/unwilling to arrange
a funeral, the hospital (usually via the bereavement ofﬁce) will arrange
and pay for a low-cost cremation

Postmortems
• The coroner may initiate a postmortem for legal reasons or where no
doctor is able to write a certiﬁcate—the family cannot veto this
• Consented hospital postmortems (at the family’s discretion) are
useful for education and audit especially in unusual or difﬁcult cases.
The rate of hospital postmortems is declining, but careful discussion
with relatives (often coordinated by the bereavement services team)
increases the likelihood of consent. A limited examination
(eg restricted to the torso or one organ) is more acceptable
• After the Alder Hey scandal (retention and disposal of organs from
children without parental consent; Liverpool, UK, 1990s), the new
laws require a separate, explicit consent for retention of tissue for
examination/teaching

The registrar
• The registrar is responsible for recording all births and deaths
• The relatives have to register the death within 5 working days and this
usually involves making an appointment
• The death must be registered before a funeral can be arranged
• If there is an error on the death certiﬁcate they can refuse to register
the death and will refer the case back to the certifying doctor

THE CORONER

The coroner
Coroners are ofﬁcers appointed by the Council to investigate any sudden
or unexplained death. They are independent of both local and central
government. The police, a doctor, or the registrar may report a death
to the coroner. The registrar must await the outcome of the coroner’s
enquiries before registering the death, so families should delay making
funeral arrangements.
Under UK law the following must be reported to the coroner:
• Death occurred in police custody or in prison
• No doctor has treated the deceased during the last illness
• The attending doctor did not see the patient within 14 days of death
• Death occurred during an operation or before recovery from
anaesthesia
• Death was sudden and unexplained or in suspicious circumstances
• Death may be due to an industrial injury or disease, or to accident,
violence, neglect or abortion, or to any kind of poisoning (this may
include injurious falls and head injuries)
• Some coroners also like to be informed when death occurred <24hr
after admission to hospital but this is not a legal requirement
Although there is an obligation to report to the coroner deaths in the
circumstances listed, the coroner might be happy to issue a ‘Part A’ certiﬁcate, which permits the doctor to write a death certiﬁcate. Only a
minority of deaths that are reported will end up with a coroner’s postmortem or an inquest.
Consider discussing:
• Cases of pressure sores or severe malnutrition at home (neglect is
possible)
• Cases of falls where the incident is not fully explained
• Postoperative cases
• Mesothelioma and occupational disease (compensation may rely on a
postmortem)
• Have a low threshold for reporting deaths when relatives are unhappy
with social care or pre-hospital or hospital care, or are overtly litigious
The coroner’s ofﬁcers can advise you about acceptable causes of death on
a certiﬁcate but are not medically qualiﬁed. A ‘Part A’ certiﬁcate records
that you have discussed the case with him/her but more commonly
informal telephone advice is given—if you feel the case is at all contentious ensure that a ‘Part A’ is issued to protect you.
2If in doubt, discuss your case with the coroner.
Following the Shipman murders (Dr Harold Shipman was a GP and a
serial killer of his patients), the documentation after death and the role of
the coroner is likely to be substantially revised by Parliament.
2The information given here applies to the UK only—local guidance
should be sought in other countries.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Capacity
• A patient with capacity is intellectually able to make a decision for
themselves
• Capacity and competency are equivalent terms, but the UK Mental
Capacity Act has increased the use of the former
• It is a fundamental human right and a basic ethical principle that
individuals can make autonomous decisions. However, society also
accepts that some of its members, eg children and adults with severe
cognitive problems, do not have the ability to make decisions for
themselves and mechanisms are in place to protect them
• Older people and ill patients (matched for age) are much more likely
to lack capacity than the general population and it is important that
a geriatrician should be familiar with capacity and its assessment
(Table 27.1)
• Best UK practice has now been enshrined in law by the Mental
Capacity Act 2005
2Always remember that in declaring someone without capacity you may
be robbing them of the ability to be involved in important decisions about
their health and lifestyle—however benevolent your motives, such decisions should never be taken lightly or inexpertly.
Table 27.1 Assessing capacity
Capacity is decision-speciﬁc.
Questions which are more
complex and/or more important
demand a higher level of capacity

Assess capacity for each relevant question
individually. Global tests, eg mental test
scores are not a substitute and can be
misleading

Capacity is assumed for adults

The burden of responsibility is with the
assessor to prove a lack of capacity

Capacity levels may ﬂuctuate.
Some types of dementia and
delirium can cause transient
reversible incompetence

Ensure the patient is functioning at their best
before assessing capacity. If in doubt repeat
the assessment later

Ignorance is not the same
as a lack of capacity

Patients should be educated about a subject
before being asked to make a decision (just
as you would expect a surgeon to explain
an operation before asking you to sign a
consent form)

A patient with capacity may
make an unwise or
unconventional decision

Patients with capacity can make decisions
which lead to illness, discomfort, danger,
or even death. Carers/relatives often need
education and support when the patient
chooses an unwise option

CAPACITY

HOW TO . . . Assess capacity
• Trigger—doctors should be alert to the possibility of a lack of
capacity but it is often people closer to the patient (relatives/carers)
who highlight a problem. In real life a capacity assessment is usually
only employed where there is conﬂict or where an important step
(such as a will or enduring power of attorney) is being attempted.
Previous assessments of capacity for other decisions or at other
times are not a substitute for the latest assessment
• Education—the patient should be given ample time to absorb and
discuss the facts/advice. Several education sessions may be needed.
Encourage other health professionals and relatives to discuss the
topic with the patient as well
• Assessment—probe the patient to assess retention, understanding
and reasoning. The UK Mental Capacity Act outlines a functional test
of capacity. Does the person have the ability to:
• Understand the information?
• Retain information related to the decision?
• Use or assess the information while considering the decision?
• Communicate the decision by any means?
The patient can fail at any step, most commonly the ﬁrst.
In borderline or contentious cases employ a second opinion (often
from a psychogeriatrician).
• Action—document the results of the assessment using observations
and patient quotes. If the patient lacks capacity state how the
substituted decision will be made, eg medical decision in best
interests, involvement of carers, case conference, etc.
For examples of documented capacity decisions see Box 27.1 and
Box 27.2).

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

The Mental Capacity Act 2005
Legislation covering England and Wales that provides a framework to
empower and protect people who may lack capacity to make some decisions for themselves. Prior to the Act, decisions were often made guided
by case law and although this statutory law has not dramatically effected
the way in which geriatricians function it has clariﬁed who can take decisions, in which situations, and how they should go about this. It also allows
people to plan ahead for a time when they may lack capacity by creating
a lasting power of attorney (LPA) which is a legally binding advance directive (AD) (see b ‘Advance directives’, p.664).
The Act covers a range of decisions, from major (eg concerning
property and affairs, healthcare treatment and where the person lives) to
more minor everyday decisions (eg what the person wears), where the
person lacks capacity to make those decisions themselves.
There are ﬁve key principles in the Act:
• Every adult has the right to make his or her own decisions and must be
assumed to have capacity to make them unless it is proved otherwise
• A person must be given all practicable help before anyone treats them
as not being able to make their own decisions
• Just because an individual makes what might be seen as an unwise
decision, they should not be treated as lacking capacity to make that
decision
• Anything done or any decision made on behalf of a person who lacks
capacity must be done in their best interests
• Anything done for or on behalf of a person who lacks capacity should
be the least restrictive of their basic rights and freedoms

Independent mental capacity advocates
Provision of independent mental capacity advocates (IMCAs) was a
requirement of the UK Mental Capacity Act 2005.
An IMCA should be appointed where the following apply:
• The patient lacks, or has borderline capacity
• There is no legal proxy, close relative, or other person who is willing
or able to support or represent the patient
• There is a major decision to be made (eg serious medical treatment
or a change of habitation)
The IMCA will have authority to make enquiries about the patient and
contribute to the decision by representing the patient’s interests, but
cannot make a decision on behalf of the patient.

DEPRIVATION OF LIBERTY SAFEGUARDS

Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards
The DoLS are described in the Mental Health Act (2007) which updates
the UK Mental Capacity Act (2005). They aim to protect people in care
homes and hospitals from being inappropriately deprived of their liberty.
The safeguards have been put in place to make sure that a care home or
hospital only restricts someone's liberty safely and correctly, and that this
is done when there is no other way to take care of that person safely. The
safeguards apply to vulnerable adults who lack capacity but not those who
are detained under the Mental Health Act (1983).

What is deprivation of liberty?
As there is no single legal deﬁnition of ‘deprivation of liberty’ it can sometimes be difﬁcult to establish whether it is taking place. Restrictions of a
person's activity can range from minor (eg not allowing choice of clothing)
to extreme restriction (eg refusing to allow a person to see family or
friends). Whether the restriction is great enough to amount to a deprivation of liberty will depend on the individual circumstances. Case law is
growing in this area.

When should the safeguards be used?
People should be cared for in hospital or a care home in the least restrictive way possible, and those planning care should always consider other
options. However, if all alternatives have been explored and the institution
believes it is necessary to deprive a person of their liberty in order to care
for them safely, then strict processes must be followed. These are the
DoLS, designed to ensure that a person’s loss of liberty is lawful and that
they are protected.
The safeguards provide the person with a representative, allow a right
of challenge to the Court of Protection against the unlawful deprivation
of liberty and require that the decision be reviewed and monitored
regularly.
If there is concern that a person is being deprived of liberty, then the
institution should be approached and concerns addressed. If the institution
believes that the restrictions are necessary for safe care of the patient
then a DoLS authorization must be sought via the relevant body (see b
‘Compulsory detention and treatment’, p.230).

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Making ﬁnancial decisions
Power of attorney (POA)
This is a simple legal document that allows an adult to nominate another
person to conduct ﬁnancial affairs on their behalf. It is only valid while the
person donating the attorney remains competent to do so.

Lasting power of attorney for property and ﬁnancial affairs
• This was introduced in the Mental Incapacity Act 2005 and is often but
not always combined with a health and welfare LPA (see b ‘Making
medical decisions’, p.660)
• It enables nomination of an attorney to make decisions about property
and ﬁnancial affairs—usually trusted family member(s)
• Powers include paying bills, collecting income and beneﬁts or selling
property, subject to any restrictions or conditions that might have been
included in the LPA
• It can only be used once it has been registered at the Ofﬁce of the
Public Guardian, but this can be done before the donor lacks capacity,
so the attorneys can carry out ﬁnancial tasks under the supervision of
the donor
• A registered LPA can be revoked by the donor if they have capacity

Enduring power of attorney (EPOA)
• Before October 2007, people could grant an EPOA so a trusted person
could act for them if they could no longer manage their ﬁnances. This
has now been replaced by property and affairs LPA (see b ‘Lasting
power of attorney for property and financial affairs’, p.658)
• Any EPOA remains valid whether or not it has been registered at the
Court of Protection, provided that both the donor of the power and
the attorney/s signed the document prior to 1 October 2007
• An EPOA can be used while the donor has mental capacity, provided
they consent to its use
• Once capacity to manage ﬁnances is lost, the attorney/s are under a
duty to register the EPOA with the Ofﬁce of the Public Guardian
• An EPOA/POA does not cover anything other than ﬁnancial decisions

Incompetent patients
• An LPA/EPOA cannot be made once the patient is incompetent to
understand the principles of the document (although it is not necessary
for them to be fully competent to run their ﬁnancial affairs)
• If an LPA/EPOA is not available for incompetent patients, sometimes
the ﬁnances can be managed informally, eg the pension can be paid out
and joint bank accounts can continue.
• To formally take over ﬁnancial management in these circumstances
(especially for large estates or where conﬂict exists) an application to
the Court of Protection must be made
• Since the Mental Capacity Act 2005 this court can appoint deputies to
manage ﬁnancial, health, and welfare decisions

MAKING FINANCIAL DECISIONS

Testamentary capacity
This refers to the speciﬁc capacity to make a will. Solicitors and ﬁnancial advisors can help draw up a will and occasionally request a doctor’s
opinion about competence. Legal guidelines are well established (see b
‘Making a will’, p.678).

Signing an LPA
Patients should generally avoid making an LPA while unwell or in hospital
as this would make it harder to prove that the patient had capacity if the
validity of the document was ever challenged.
Before an LPA is valid, there must be a certiﬁcate of capacity drawn up
by an independent third party called a Certiﬁcate Provider. The Certiﬁcate
Provider could be a solicitor, a doctor, or another independent person
whom the donor has known personally for at least 2 years. In some cases
(eg after a stroke) it may be most appropriate to ask a doctor to carry out
the assessment.
If a capacity assessment is required, check that the patient understands
that once registered, the LPA allows the attorney complete ﬁnancial
control, this power extends into the future and they will be unable to
revoke the power if they lack capacity. Document carefully as shown in
Box 27.1.
The signing of an LPA must also be witnessed by an independent person
(often a friend or in hospital by an administrator or manager). This should
not be confused with the role of Certiﬁcate Provider.

Box 27.1 Assessment of capacity to complete an LPA
I interviewed Mrs Jones today. She indicated she wished to make an
LPA in the favour of her husband and did not appear to be under duress
from another person. She explained her health was deteriorating and
she wanted her husband to manage the ‘bills and things’ if she did not
feel up to it in the future. She was able to tell me her that she owned
a current account, savings account, some premium bonds, and that the
mortgage had been paid off on their house. She understood that an LPA
would allow her husband to do as he wished with her money without
necessarily consulting her both now and in the future. She knew that this
power would continue even if she was too ill to be consulted. She conﬁrmed that ‘he has always sorted that sort of thing out and I don’t want
him to be stopped from doing it because I can’t sign my cheques—I trust
him to do the right thing’.
I believe Mrs Jones is competent to give lasting power of attorney to
her husband.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Making medical decisions
Lasting power of attorney for health and welfare
• This was introduced in the Mental Incapacity Act in April 2005
• It enables nomination of an attorney to make decisions about personal
welfare—usually trusted family member(s)
• A personal welfare LPA can only be used once the form is registered at
the Ofﬁce of the Public Guardian and the patient has become mentally
incapable of making decisions about their own welfare
• It can include the power for the attorney to give or refuse consent to
medical treatment if this power has been expressly given in the LPA (a
proxy medical decision maker)
• Also includes power to make some social decisions, eg where the
donor lives

Patients who clearly lack capacity
• Unless a valid LPA is available in the UK no one can make a decision
about medical treatment for another adult without capacity
• It is always worth enquiring if a LPA is completed or if there is a
written or verbal AD made by the patient prior to them becoming
incompetent (see b ‘Advance directives’, p.664)
• Doctors are required by the Mental Capacity Act to make decisions in
the ‘best interests’ of their incompetent patients, and this holds true
even if there is a valid LPA
• In America a hierarchy of next of kin can legally make substitute
decisions. Relatives are often surprised and occasionally angry to ﬁnd
that they have few rights in the UK
• In practice doctors should routinely consult next of kin where
important or contentious medical decisions are made for patients
without capacity. The human rights legislation, through its support of
‘family life’ as a basic human right will reinforce the social shift towards
increasing power for relatives. Relatives can help doctors to decide
what the patient might have wanted under the circumstances, assisting
decisions about best interest
• If there is conﬂict between the medical team and relatives about
what is in the best interests of the patient that cannot be resolved the
doctor involved may wish to seek a second medical opinion, consult
with the hospital legal team, an IMCA, or refer to the courts

Patients who may or may not have capacity
• Patients’ views should always be sought about medical treatments
• Often these views will concur with those of the medical professional,
or they are happy to be guided by the doctor
• Rarely, a patient will express a view at odds with either the medical
team or their family, in which case a careful assessment of capacity to
make their own decision is required
• Assess capacity in line with the principles outlined previously and
document meticulously in the notes (see example in Box 27.2)
see b ‘Making complex decisions’, p.667

MAKING MEDICAL DECISIONS

Box 27.2 Assessment of patient refusing a colectomy for
cancer
Miss Joseph has told me she will not consent to a colectomy. I have
explained the procedure that is being recommended including the beneﬁts and risks and she has been able to remember and understand this
information without difﬁculty. She explains that in view of her age and
lack of current symptoms she would rather not put herself through a
major operation. She said ‘I am 79 years old and I don’t want to be
mucked around’. She understands that by refusing surgery she might
be shortening her life and that she may become ill in the future as the
tumour grows but feels that this is a ‘lesser evil’ than an operation at
the moment. I believe she has capacity to make this decision and we
have agreed to discuss it again in two weeks time during an outpatient
appointment after she has spoken to her family.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Making social decisions
The legal position for social decisions for patients without capacity (eg
where a patient should live) is the same as for medical decisions. Unless
an LPA is in place, the healthcare team should consult with family to try to
ensure that the patient’s best interests are met.
If making a decision against the expressed wishes of patient without
capacity, involve an advocate. Where there are no family members, or
there is a lack of support for the patient, an IMCA may be appropriate (see
b ‘The Mental Capacity Act 2005’, p.656). The DoLS should be followed
(see b ‘Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards’, p.657) and these demand that
decisions are made ‘the least restrictive’.
It may be necessary to apply to the Court of Protection for a court
appointed deputy to supervise welfare decisions.
A very common challenge for the geriatric MDT is the patient who
wants to continue to live alone in their own home after they have
developed physical or cognitive problems which mean they are at risk in
that environment (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Manage a patient insisting on
returning home against advice’, p.663).

Further reading

MAKING SOCIAL DECISIONS

HOW TO . . . Manage a patient insisting on returning
home against advice
First assess whether the patient has capacity to make the decision:
• Patients with capacity should accept that they are at risk and reason
that they prefer to take this risk than accept other accommodation
• In borderline or contentious cases a second opinion, often from a
psychogeriatrician, can be helpful
If the patient has capacity then they cannot be forced to abandon their
home or accept outside help although the healthcare team and family
can continue to negotiate and persuade.
• It is worth determining what motives lie behind the patient’s
insistence; sometimes misconceptions can be corrected
• Patients will sometimes agree to a trial period of residential care or
care package and this often leads to long-term agreement
Where the patient lacks capacity, decisions should be made in the
patient’s best interest, and be the least restrictive option. While the
patient should not be discharged to an environment where they will
be at unreasonable risk, the team should still attempt to accommodate
the patient’s wishes and steps may be taken to reduce risk (eg disconnecting or removing dangerous items, alarm systems, or regular carer
visits, etc. may still allow a patient to return home). There is no such
thing as a ‘safe’ discharge—only a safer one.
Finally ensure you record your capacity assessment clearly, eg:
Mr King has been a patient of mine for 2 years. He has a progressive
dementia which is now severe and concern has been expressed by his
son and the carers that he is at risk to himself in continuing to live alone
at home. He was admitted to hospital on this occasion after a small
house ﬁre (he left an unattended pan on the stove). He has had three
other admissions since Christmas with falls and accidents. Over the last
2 weeks I have had several discussions with him about why his family is
concerned about him. The nurses, his son, and his home carers have also
had such discussions. When I spoke to him today he was disoriented in
person and place (believing he was in a police station and that I was a
policeman). He expressed a wish to go home to be with his wife (who
died 12 years ago) but could not tell me his address. He did not believe
that there were any risks involved in going home and did not accept
that there was a possibility of falling over again saying ‘I am a very strong
man, you would be more likely to fall over than me.’ When I discussed
the ﬁre he started talking about his war-time experiences and would not
accept that there was a risk of ﬁres in the future. At present I believe
that Mr King lacks capacity to make a valid decision about his social
circumstances. I have no reason to believe that his level of competency
will improve with further education or time. A multidisciplinary case
conference has been arranged for next week to discuss if it is practical
to continue to support him in his own home or whether placement
should be sought.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Advance directives
• An AD (also known as advance decision) is a patient-led medical
decision, made when the patient is competent, which is designed to
come into force if a patient becomes incompetent
• ADs were developed to promote personal autonomy
• They may be verbal statements but are more commonly written
(sometimes known as a living will)
• ADs are usually employed by patients to refuse aggressive treatment
but could, theoretically, be used to request or direct treatment.
However ADs cannot be used to request treatment which would not
usually be offered or to withdraw ‘basic care’ (eg nursing or analgesia)
• A valid AD holds the same weight in law as a contemporaneous patient
decision and doctors who provide a rejected treatment could be sued
for battery. However a doctor must ﬁrst assess whether an AD is valid
and applicable (see b ‘HOW TO . . . Assess whether an AD is valid
and applicable’, p.665)
• A template AD can be downloaded from the Compassion in Dying
charity website (M www.compassionindying.org.uk)
The UK Mental Capacity Act clariﬁes the legality of ADs. In an emergency
if an AD is not provided or if there is doubt about the legitimacy of an AD
then clinically appropriate treatment should be provided. Where a healthcare professional has a conscientious objection to implementing a valid
AD the care should be handed to another practitioner. Despite the theoretical advantages of ADs for patients, relatives, and the medical team they
are still rarely seen in clinical medicine. There are several barriers to their
successful implementation:
• Patients are often unaware of ADs or their legal validity
• Patients and doctors are often reluctant to confront these distressing
topics or feel that the other party should initiate discussions
• The transfer of AD from primary care, family homes, and solicitors
(where they are often composed and lodged) to hospital (where they
are most commonly designed to be implemented) is often poor
• Concern that views might change in future altered states of health
• ADs may be too vague to inform physicians, eg a refusal of ‘life
sustaining treatment’ may not help with decisions about iv ﬂuids, etc.
• A high level of competence is required to complete an AD. Patients
with conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease have commonly lost the
ability to make one by the time of diagnosis
Ideally an AD forms part of the wider process of advance care planning
between a patient and the health care professionals, being promoted by
the UK Gold Standards Framework (M www.goldstandardsframework.
nhs.uk/AdvanceCarePlanning).
AD are most likely to be useful when there is a predictable course
of illness (disease-speciﬁc advanced directives have been used in AIDS,
cancer, MND, and COPD)

ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

HOW TO . . . Assess whether an AD is valid and
applicable
If a patient retains capacity then you should discuss management decisions with them in the usual way. An AD is not an excuse for avoiding,
often emotionally difﬁcult, discussions with patients or relatives.
Contemporaneous decisions always outweigh a previous AD.
As long as an AD is valid and applicable, it should usually guide
treatment. This was true under common law before the Mental Capacity
Act but the conditions of validity and applicability are now more clearly
deﬁned.
Verbal statements are theoretically valid but it is much harder to
ensure that they are correctly relayed and refusal of life-sustaining
treatment must be written.
Ensure that the AD was not been given under duress or pressure
from a third party.
It is necessary to assess if the patient had capacity at the time the
AD was created (both capacity to make an AD and capacity in terms
of understanding the pros and cons of the medical treatment they are
refusing) and this can be very difﬁcult to assess.
If the AD is applicable then the circumstances should be the same as
those deﬁned in the AD
The Mental Capacity Act now deﬁnes when an AD is legally
enforceable. The following conditions must be met:
• Written statements must be signed and dated
• Must have at least one signature from a witness who is not a relative,
LPA, or beneﬁciary of the will
• If the AD refuses life-sustaining treatment there must also be a
statement to verify that the decision applies to treatment ‘even if life
is at risk’
• The AD must be valid and applicable
• If a health and welfare attorney has been appointed under a LPA, this
attorney should also be involved in discussions about the person's
treatment, and doctors should take information provided by him or
her into account. An AD overrides a LPA, unless an LPA prepared
after the AD speciﬁcally confers authority on the attorney.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Diagnosing dying and estimating when
treatment is without hope
A high percentage of elderly patients admitted to hospital are destined
to die despite best medical care. A great deal of ﬁnancial and human
resources and most importantly patient suffering could be avoided if this
death was predictable. The art of applying treatment aggressively when
appropriate but backing off compassionately in other circumstances is one
of the most common and challenging tasks in geriatric medicine.
There has been a lot of discussion about do not attempt cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (DNACPR) orders but decisions about less dramatic life-saving
technologies are just as hard (eg whether to admit a patient from a nursing
home for iv antibiotics and ﬂuids or selecting patients for renal replacement
therapy (see b ‘Renal replacement therapy: dialysis’, p.396) or when to
initiate artiﬁcial nutrition (see b ‘The ethics of clinically assisted feeding’,
p.360).
Unfortunately predicting futile treatment is fraught with difﬁculty—
experienced doctors never underestimate the power of some older
people to make a miraculous recovery. The following tips may help:
• Attempt to make a diagnosis (which usually requires some
investigations and minor procedures) before estimating prognosis
• Consider a trial of treatment but constantly monitor the clinical response
and be willing to up or down regulate how aggressively to treat
• Sometimes it is helpful to deﬁne limits at the onset of treatment
(eg oral but not iv therapy, a 2-week trial of NG feeding in a
patient following stroke, a 20-unit maximum transfusion for acute
gastrointestinal bleeding)
• Decide about each intervention separately—every procedure and
patient will have different risk/beneﬁt and tolerability ratios
• If there is doubt or disagreement about the appropriateness of
treatment seek a second medical opinion
• Remember that medical decisions are not made in isolation—relatives,
nurses, therapists, and community carers are ultimately affected by
such decisions and open dialogue will help everyone
The patients’ wishes are paramount but many severely ill patients do not
have capacity to make decisions. Beware patients who reject treatment
out of ignorance, misconceptions or fear. Likewise patients or relatives
who continue to demand treatment which is clearly not effective (or inappropriate) require education and support.
Deciding that treatment is futile is not the same as ‘giving up’—a positive
decision for terminal care allows a change in the therapeutic goal from
‘cure’ to ‘keeping comfortable’ and ensuring a digniﬁed death. While in
some branches of medicine this shift can involve a change in environment
(eg to hospice) and medical team (to community or palliative care team) in
geriatric medicine the line is often blurred, see b ‘Palliative care’, p.642.
The use of the Liverpool Care Pathway (M www.mcpcil.org.uk) is becoming
more widespread, and provides a structure for quality end-of-life care.

MAKING COMPLEX DECISIONS

Making complex decisions
All complex decisions should be made with the following in mind:
• The patient should be presumed to have capacity unless proven
otherwise and as such should be at the centre of the process
• Efforts should be made to optimize decision making capacity
• All decisions should be in the patient’s best interests
• Wide communication avoids misunderstanding at a later date
Use the ﬂow chart in Fig. 27.1 as a guide.
Medical team make a clinical
judgement, considering the
patient’s views and beliefs
Does the patient have capacity?
Yes
Explain options clearly,
outlining risks, burdens
and benefits.
Be honest where there is
uncertainty.
Ensure there is
understanding and
support decision-making.
If there is disagreement
about the decision,
explore the reasons and
ensure the choice is
informed.
Remember a person has
the right to make a
seemingly unwise decision.

No
Is there a proxy
decision-maker
appointed by LPA?

Yes

No

Make a decision in the patient’s
best interest. Involve family and
friends to inform about patient’s
previous views.
Consult other health care
professionals. Independent
advocates may be useful (IMCAs)

If there is disagreement about the decision, attempt to resolve locally seeking
advice from a more experienced colleague, obtaining a second opinion, using
an independent advocate, holding a case conference, or using local mediation
services. If problems persist, involve the appropriate legal body

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
CPR was ﬁrst described in 1967 and is now widely applied both in and out
of hospital. Around 20% of those who die in hospital in the UK will have
at least one attempt at CPR during their terminal admission. Although the
principles of CPR decisions are the same as for other medical decisions
they demand special attention because:
• Cardiac arrest often occurs unpredictably
• Withholding CPR in a cardiac arrest will most likely lead to death
• There is an assumption that all patients will receive CPR in hospital—
unlike most treatments a decision is required to withhold it
• CPR is a highly emotive subject
CPR is undoubtedly a life-saving procedure (in hospital around 20% will
recover a pulse and half of these patients will survive to leave hospital).
Those who survive CPR have a reasonable life expectancy but a small percentage (1–2%) will be left with permanent hypoxic brain damage.

Predicting outcome for CPR (Table 27.2)
• Highest success rates are obtained treating arrests due to cardiac
arrhythmia on coronary care units, lowest on general medical wards in
frail patients with multiple pathologies
• Older patients have lower survival rates but this is probably a feature
of their multiple pathologies and a good outcome is possible if older
patients are carefully selected
• Individual pre-arrest factors are not sensitive or speciﬁc enough to
be useful in predicting outcome. Morbidity scores combine several
variables to attempt to predict outcome of CPR more accurately but
are not in common use

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

The process of CPR decision making
In some circumstances it is appropriate to decide against doing CPR in
the event of a cardiopulmonary arrest. These decisions are known as
do not attempt CPR, or do not attempt cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(DNACPR) or allow natural death (AND) decisions.
There has been much discussion about the best way of approaching
this, with sometimes conﬂicting views from those in favour of patient
autonomy and those who feel this is a medical decision, with many
guidelines published. The 2010 UK GMC guidance ‘Treatment and care
towards the end of life: good practice in decision making’ offers a sensible
balance (M www.gmc-uk.org).

When to consider a DNACPR order
• Where attempting CPR will not restart the patient’s heart and
breathing (medical futility)
• Where there is no beneﬁt in restarting the patient’s heart and
breathing (quality or length of life)
• Where the expected beneﬁt is outweighed by the burdens of CPR
• Where a patient with capacity has decided this is what they want
It may be reasonable to only make decisions for those patients in whom
arrest seems likely (eg critically unwell, actively dying) although facilities
with limited out-of-hours cover may make more prospective decisions.
Where no DNACPR decision is made, the presumption is that resuscitation should be attempted.

Where CPR is clearly futile
• A doctor cannot be compelled to provide a futile treatment, and so
this is a largely medical decision, although remember that ‘futility’ is
rarely clear-cut
• Carefully consider whether it is necessary or appropriate to tell the
patient that a DNACPR decision has been made—balance possible
wish to know with the burden of discussing something that is not
clinically relevant
• In general it is good practice to inform patients with capacity (or at
least offer to discuss the issue and be guided by response) and to
discuss with interested parties/proxy decision-makers for patients who
lack capacity. If a DNACPR order is to be recorded on patient held or
accessible records it could be detrimental if they were not aware of the
order in advance

Where CPR may be successful
• If CPR may be successful, but outcome may be poor, then a decision
made in the best interests of the patient should involve their personal
view of that outcome
• For patients with capacity, a careful discussion should be had, outlining
the risks, burdens and beneﬁts of CPR (see b ’HOW TO . . . Manage
DNACPR decisions’, p.671)
• For those who lack capacity, their views should be approximated from
family and friends. Other healthcare professionals should be consulted
and an independent advocate (IMCA) may occasionally be useful

THE PROCESS OF CPR DECISION MAKING

HOW TO . . . Manage DNACPR decisions
Ensure you know the local guidelines. Hospitals vary in how this decision is made, recorded and who is authorized to make DNACPR. Busy
physicians need to make time for DNACPR decisions, although they
often prove to be easier than anticipated:
• Although it could take 30min to get an elderly patient to make a
fully informed decision (many have not even heard of CPR) you can
often get a fairly accurate idea from a competent patient with a few
quick questions like ‘are you the kind of person that wants everything
done/nature to take its course’
• Never ignore patient cues, eg ‘I don’t suppose I will come out of
this?’ or ‘I’ve had my time’. These are ideal times to discuss end-of-life
issues and such patients are often relieved by this
• Experienced nurses will often provide helpful guidance
In reality, the majority of DNACPR decisions on geriatric wards will
not involve the patient (because of incapacity) so lengthy meetings with
relatives may ensue to establish best interest:
• When sensitively handled there is rarely conﬂict and many are
relieved to be consulted or happy to be guided by the doctor’s
opinion
• Try to use the time to discuss general management (emphasizing
positive management steps ﬁrst—even if that is just maintaining
dignity and comfort) so that the family doesn’t perceive the only
medical priority is avoiding CPR
• Where conﬂict does arise it can be best to leave the patient for CPR
and re-address the question later. Relatives often take some time
to trust the doctors, to come to terms, or to consult other family/
friends and often the conﬂict melts away. Remember, CPR is only
a small fraction of the patient’s care and it may distract from other
more important things. While this might lead to a rise in unsuccessful
CPR attempts (with consequent reduction in morale of resuscitation
teams and resource implications) it does protect patient autonomy
and doctors from complaints/litigation
• No one can be forced to provide a treatment which they feel is
inappropriate so if there is conscientious objection to providing CPR
consider moving the patient to a different doctor/ward
Recording a DNACPR decision
• Write the decision prominently in the medical notes
• Many institutions have a speciﬁc form to record these decisions, but
ensure that any relevant discussion is fully documented
• Sign, date, and time clearly
• Document the rationale for the decision and the names of those
consulted in making the decision
• If the patient was not consulted the reason should be listed
The responsible consultant should endorse a DNACPR order made by
a junior doctor as soon as possible.
2Ensure that nurses are aware as soon as a DNACPR order is made.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Rationing and ageism
Rationing
• This has been present in the NHS since its inception in 1948 but
the ever-increasing cost of modern specialized, technological, and
pharmacological medicine, along with the growing sophistication of
patients has meant that recently rationing has become more explicit
and contentious
• No UK government has ever openly admitted to rationing although
‘cost-efﬁciency’ and ‘budgeting’ are thinly disguised way of handling
difﬁcult rationing decisions
• The level at which rationing decisions are made has gradually moved
up from physicians themselves (which led to considerable inequality),
to hospital managers (which did not remove regional inequality).
The introduction of NICE (National Institute for Health and Clinical
Excellence) in 1999 was designed to help make rationing decisions at a
national level by setting guidelines
• Some initial NICE recommendations that treatments should not be
funded (eg interferon B in multiple sclerosis) led to signiﬁcant lobbying
and the development of risk-sharing schemes (allowing government
and drug manufacturers to share the cost in certain cases)
• In other cases funding has been advised (eg glycoprotein IIb/IIIa
inhibitors in acute coronary syndromes) but this has not led to
widespread implementation.
• So-called ‘postcode prescribing’ refers to the variable availability of
drugs depending on health authority or GP boundaries

Ageism
This is rationing applied by age criteria. Although the UK National Service
Framework (see b ‘The National Service Framework for Older People’,
p.28) has banned explicit rationing (standard 1 states ‘NHS services will
be provided, regardless of age, on the basis of clinical need alone’) it is still
widespread.
It is accepted that some medical interventions, eg ITU may be less
effective when applied to older people, but remember:
• Some older people are physiologically younger (ie chronological age
does not correlate well with biological age). Age is not a good guide to
frailty
• Some treatments (eg thrombolysis in MI) save more lives in an older
age group (number needed to treat is lower because untreated death
rate is higher than in younger groups)
Disability and dependence costs the state dearly; preventing strokes,
operating on severely osteoarthritic hips, etc. are often highly cost-efﬁcient interventions if they enable patients to stay at home rather than go
into costly institutional care (quite apart from the beneﬁt to the patient).
There is good evidence that the average patient uses the majority of
healthcare resources in the last year of their life but it is rarely possible to
predict prospectively when patients are entering their terminal year, nor

RATIONING AND AGEISM

is there evidence that voluntary restriction of medical treatment by ADs
(see b ‘Advance directives’, p.664) has any cost-cutting effect.
There is a more fundamental ideological principle that sectors of the
population who are perceived to have less social worth, are less likely to
complain, and are largely politically inactive should not be discriminated
against—whether those sectors are deﬁned by age, sex, or race. The
commonly quoted ‘fair innings’ argument suggests that after a certain
age you have had your ‘share’ of world resources and younger patients
should therefore take precedence. Older people commonly hold to this
philosophy. This method of rationing assumes that everyone uses equal
resources and enjoys equal quality of life up until the point that it ‘runs
out’. The logical consequence is that high users of resources (eg people
with diabetes) should have had their fair innings at a much younger age. In
reality society accepts that some of it members will take more than they
give to the system—it is prejudice that allows us to accept rationing for
older patients but not for a child with cerebral palsy.

CHAPTER 27

Ethics

Elder abuse
Deﬁned as any act, or lack of action that causes harm or distress to an
older person. Under-recognized, with few prevalence studies. One estimated around 5% of community dwelling older people have suffered
verbal abuse, and 2% physical abuse. Probably more prevalent within care
homes, but precise extent unknown.

Types of abuse
Psychological
• Bullying, shouting, swearing, blaming, etc.
• Look for signs of fear, helplessness, emotional lability, ambivalence
toward caregiver, withdrawal, etc.
Physical
• Hitting, slapping, pushing, restraining, etc.
• May also include inappropriate sedation with medication
• Look for injuries that are unexplained, especially if they are different
ages, evidence of restraint, excess sedation, broken glasses, etc.
Financial
• Inappropriate use of an older person’s ﬁnancial assets
• Includes using cheques, withdrawing money from an account,
transferring assets, taking jewellery or other valuables, failing to pay
bills, altering wills, etc.
Sexual
• Forcing an older person to participate in a sexual act against their will
• Look for genital bruising or bleeding, or sexual disinhibition
Neglect
• Deprivation of food, heat, clothing, basic care
• Occurs in situations where an older person is dependant
• Look for malnutrition, poor personal hygiene, and poor skin condition
• Easier to spot in situations where a certain standard of care is
anticipated (eg patients from care homes being admitted to hospital
who are unkempt, dirty, or inappropriately dressed may raise
concerns)

Who abuses?
• Commonly someone in a caregiver role
• Often arises because of carer anger, frustration, and lack of support,
training or facilities along with social isolation
• Relationship difﬁculties between carer and recipient, and carer mental
illness or substance misuse (eg alcohol) exacerbate the situation
• Sleep deprivation or dealing with faecal incontinence may also
precipitate abuse
2Most are under extreme stress (‘at the end of my tether’) and extremely
remorseful afterwards.

ELDER ABUSE

HOW TO . . . Manage suspected elder abuse
The UK Government’s ‘No Secrets’ guidance, published in 2000, aims to
identify ‘vulnerable adults’ who should be the focus of local safeguarding
policies and procedures. The term ‘safeguarding’ means a range of activities aimed at upholding an individual’s fundamental right to be safe and
local protocols should be in place, under the guidance of safeguarding
adults boards.
The following is a guide:
• An individual does not have to prove abuse to take action, only have
a strong suspicion that it is occurring
• The ﬁrst step is to involve other agencies—this may include social
services, involved agencies (eg home carers), the general practitioner,
the local health authority and (rarely at ﬁrst) the police
• Assessment of the carer and recipient should be detailed,
multiagency, and individually tailored
• As abuse is usually as a result of caregiver stress, a common
approach is to attempt to relieve that stress (eg providing home
care, day care, respite care, health support, advice about sleep or
continence, ﬁnancial help, rehousing, etc.) while maintaining the
patient at home
• Close multidisciplinary supervision is essential until the situation
improves
• Removal of the patient from an abusive situation may occasionally be
done using laws designed primarily for other purposes, eg the Mental
Health Act (provision to act in the best interests of patients with
mental illness)
• Police involvement may occasionally be necessary where there are
no remediable factors or a very high risk of future harm

CHAPTER 28

Finances

Making a will
• Everyone over 18 should make a will. This need not be complicated—
there are cheap will writing ‘kits’ available to buy, and forms can
be downloaded from the Internet even more cheaply, eg M http://
freeguard.co.uk/aboutus.aspx
• The will should be kept in a safe place, and family members informed
• Wills that are more complex should be made through a solicitor
• It is common for the question of wills to arise for the ﬁrst time when
someone becomes ill, often in hospital
• Doctors may become involved where there is doubt about the patients
capacity to make a will
• Capacity (competence) is covered in detail elsewhere (see b
‘Capacity’, p.654). It is decision-speciﬁc so must be reassessed for each
important decision a person makes

Testamentary capacity
This is deﬁned in England and Wales by a speciﬁc set of legal criteria. These
criteria were established in the 1870 court case of Banks v Goodfellow.
A person drawing up a will must:
1. Understand the nature of the act and its effect—ie know that they are
choosing whom to give their property to after death
2. Understand the extent of the property being willed—this need not be
precise, but the person should know roughly what they are willing
(eg a house and savings) along with details of any joint ownership and
debts. The larger the estate, the clearer this understanding should be
3. Understand the nature and extent of claims on them—both included and
excluded parties. This means the person should be able to say who
might reasonably expect to beneﬁt from their will (spouse, children,
etc.) and if people are excluded, give reasons why
4. Have no mental disorder directly inﬂuencing points 1–3—this does
not mean that a will cannot be made if someone has a mental
disorder—rather that this is not colouring his or her speciﬁc
testamentary capacity. This can be hard to prove, but an example
may be where a demented patient develops paranoid delusions about
a caring spouse, and excludes him or her from the will as a result
5. Be under no undue inﬂuence from third parties—this again may be hard
to prove except in very overt circumstances
It is sensible to assess capacity at the time the will is drawn up, and then
brieﬂy check at signing (these can be some time apart).
A doctor asked to assess testamentary capacity should question the
person with direct reference to Banks v Goodfellow criteria, and make
clear contemporaneous notes (with direct quotes) that support the
conclusions drawn.
It is probably better to avoid being a witness to a will signing for patients
in your care (this can be done by anyone), as this may be confused with a
formal capacity assessment.

TAXATION

Taxation
• Most income received by older people in the UK is taxed
• The allowance of tax-free income rises with age—in 2011, people
under 65 can have an income of £7475 per annum without paying tax,
whereas this ﬁgure rises to £10,090 age 75 and over
• Some income is not taxed—eg attendance allowance, pension credit,
winter fuel payments, council tax and housing beneﬁt, and war
pensions
• Some lump sums are also not taxed, for example from certain private
pension schemes. Good ﬁnancial advice will help to optimize an older
person’s resources
• The rate of tax then depends on the total income, ranging from 10% at
lower incomes up to 50% for incomes over £150,000 per annum

CHAPTER 28

Finances

Pensions
As life expectancy extends many older people can now look forward
to long periods in retirement. Although there is a shift away from being
totally ﬁnancially dependent on the state towards ﬁnancial planning and
personal pensions, there is still a real risk of poverty for many very elderly
people. Fuel poverty is one marker (deﬁned as spending more than 10% of
disposable income on fuel) which is a political priority.

UK state pension
• Paid when pensionable age is reached (currently 60 for women, and 65
for men, but will change to 65 for both sexes between 2010 and 2020)
• Age of retirement was originally decided on economic grounds, based
on life expectancy after stopping work with little relation to physical
ability to work. As people live longer, it becomes less economically
viable (see b ‘Demographics: population age structure’, p.6)
• It is not automatically given under the age of 80—a person must qualify
by making enough National Insurance (NI) contributions during their
working lives
• Since 1975, all workers and their employers have made these
contributions via NI payments as a percentage of earnings (prior to this
a weekly stamp was paid)
• Credits are awarded if a person cannot pay NI because of sickness,
disability, or being a carer
• The full basic state pension is paid if enough NI contributions have
been made (in 2010 this is £100 per week for a single person)
• A spouse qualiﬁes for a state pension based on his or her partner’s
contributions—around half the full pension if they are still living
together, but this amount rises if divorced or widowed
• If contribution conditions are not met, then a proportion of the
pension may be paid, but some do not qualify at all
• The ‘additional state pension’ is an earnings related top-up to the basic
state pension for low and moderate earners who are not involved in
occupational or private pension schemes
• Over the age of 80, a pension is paid regardless of NI contributions if
the person has been resident in the UK for 10 years since the age of 60
• State pensions are now paid directly into an account
• This money is often supplemented by income from other pensions or
investments or in lower-income households by beneﬁts

Occupational pensions
• Schemes set up by employers to provide pension and life assurance
beneﬁts for employers (eg tax free lump sum on retirement)
• May be contributory (where around 5% of earnings are taken in
addition to an employer contribution) or non-contributory (employer
makes all the payments)
• The employer pays most of the administrative costs of the scheme and
there are also some tax beneﬁts

PENSIONS

Personal pensions
• Schemes designed to provide an income after retirement (includes
stakeholder pensions which have more ﬂexibility)
• Individuals set these up for themselves, often with the help of a
ﬁnancial adviser
• Major tax incentives to save in this way in the UK

War pensions
Paid to people injured in the forces, or as a civilian during a war, and to
their dependants.

CHAPTER 28

Finances

Beneﬁts
Many pensioners are poor. In 2008/9 there were 1.8 million pensioners in
poverty (deﬁned as below 60% of contemporary median income). Despite
this, many do not claim all the beneﬁts they are entitled to, usually because
they are not aware of them, perceived stigma about ‘hand-outs’ (that can
often be diminished by a few well-judged words from a doctor) or are
daunted by application forms.
Care managers can help ensure all beneﬁts are claimed, as can
professional welfare rights advisers (working for Citizens Advice Bureau,
Age UK, social services departments, etc.). Some charity volunteers will
also assist with ﬁlling in forms (eg Age UK).
Beneﬁts vary with changes in government, and from country to country.
The following describes the situation in the UK.

Beneﬁts for low-income households
Pension credits
Given to >60s, to top income up to a set amount (guarantee credit). This
does not depend on NI contributions. In 2010, a single person is topped
up to around £140 per week. This amount may be more in certain circumstances, eg severe disability.
Housing beneﬁt
Help towards rent and service charges for low-income households.
Council tax beneﬁt
Allows low-income households to pay less council tax, depending on
income and savings.

The Social Fund
Provides lump sum payments, grants, and loans:
• Community care grants can be given to help with exceptional
expenses, such as home adaptations for disability
• Funeral payments can be made to low-income households if needed
• Cold weather payments are made to low-income households to help
with heating costs when the temperature is below 0°C for a week
• Budgeting loans available to low-income households to cover one-off
expenses (eg clothing, household equipment). Repaid (interest-free)
from weekly allowance
• Crisis loans are available to all income households, if there is an
immediate difﬁculty in paying for something in an emergency. Repaid
without interest

Attendance allowance
Given to >65s who need help with personal care because of an illness
or disability (equivalent to the disability living allowance which is paid to
younger people, but no account taken of mobility). Eligibility based on
need for help or supervision, so even if a spouse is already providing this
care, the beneﬁt is still awarded.

BENEFITS

Carers’ allowance
Paid to low-income carers of people receiving attendance allowance or
disability living allowance.

Healthcare assistance
• Free prescriptions for all over the age of 60
• Low-income households can apply for free dental treatment, wigs,
travel to hospital, eye tests and get assistance with paying for glasses

Travel assistance
• Free or reduced fare bus travel for >60s
• Reduced train fares with an appropriate rail card for pensioners
• Free renewal of driver’s licence >70, subject to ﬁlling a medical
questionnaire regarding ﬁtness to drive every 3 years. A report from a
doctor is not routinely required

Other beneﬁts
• Free television licence for >75s
• Winter fuel payments made to all households where there is a person
>60 years
Many of these are available regardless of income and savings, to reﬂect
the additional costs of disability. Often older people (and the professionals
caring for them) assume that they will not be entitled because they are
not poor.

GERIATRIC DEPRESSION SCALE

Geriatric Depression Scale
Suitable as a screening test for depressive symptoms in the elderly.
Ideal for evaluating the clinical severity of depression, and therefore for
monitoring treatment. It is easy to administer, needs no prior psychiatric
knowledge and has been well validated in many environments—home and
clinical.
The original GDS was a 30-item questionnaire—time consuming and
challenging for some patients (and staff). Later versions retain only the
most discriminating questions; their validity approaches that of the original
form. The most common version in general geriatric practice is the
15-item version.

Instructions
The test (Table A.1) is undertaken orally. Ask the patient to reply indicating how they have felt over the past week. Obtain a clear yes or no
reply. If necessary, repeat the question. Each depressive answer (bold)
scores 1.

BARTHEL INDEX

• Aim to record what the patient actually does do in daily life, not what
he/she can do (ie a poorly motivated but capable patient may score
poorly)
• The score reﬂects the degree of independence from help provided by
another person:
• If supervision is required, the patient is not independent
• If aids and devices are used but no help is required, the patient is
independent
• Use the best available evidence, asking the patient or relatives, carers,
nurses and therapists, and using common sense. Observing the patient
is helpful, but direct testing is not necessary
• Middle categories imply that the patient supplies over 50% of the effort
• It is useful to also ask about abilities before admission or acute illness,
and to compare both the total Barthel score and elements of it to
determine the magnitude and nature of the setback

MINI-MENTAL STATE EXAMINATION

Mini-Mental State Examination
The MMSE is a widely applicable and well-validated test of cognitive function.
It is a 30-point test, takes 10–15min to complete, and covers a broader
range of cognitive domains than the AMTS. It is therefore less useful as
a brief screening test in general medical or geriatric practice, but is very
useful in:
• Conﬁrming the nature and magnitude of deﬁcits identiﬁed by clinical
suspicion, or by the AMTS
• Tracking change, for example following the introduction of
cholinesterase inhibitors in dementia
The MMSE is widely used. Its copyright is now being robustly defended,
and permission to publish it has not been granted. It is however widely
available in older texts.
It is possible that the robust defence of copyright will result in a rapid
decline in the use of what has been a useful clinical tool, to be replaced by
other well-validated instruments such as the clock-drawing test.

The positive likelihood ratio is 5.06 and negative likelihood ratio is 0.23.
1. Acute onset and ﬂuctuating course. Evidence of acute change in mental
status from baseline; behavior ﬂuctuates during the day
2. Inattention. Easily distracted, difﬁculty focusing attention and keeping
track with conversation
3. Disorganized thinking. Irrelevant conversation, unclear ﬂow of ideas,
unpredictable switching from subject to subject
4. Any mental state, other than alert, is abnormal. Describe altered states
as: (a) vigilant, (b) drowsy, (c) difﬁcult or unable to arouse

CLOCK-DRAWING AND THE MINI-COG TM

Clock-drawing and the Mini-CogTM
Clock-drawing tests (CDT) are widely accepted and well validated
screening tools for dementia. Their strength is in the brisk assessment
of multiple cognitive domains including long-term memory, auditory and
visual processing, motor planning and execution, etc. There are many test
methods. All ask subjects to draw a clock face showing a speciﬁc time, but
other details and vary. Despite these differences, most appear sensitive and
speciﬁc and are well tolerated. There is also evidence that non-systematic
assessment—simply asking a patient to draw a clock-face showing a named
time and assessing it informally—has great value in ruling in or ruling out
signiﬁcant cognitive dysfunction.

The Mini-CogTM
One test that has found widespread favour is the Mini-Cog, which combines a 3-item recall test with a CDT. It takes 2–3 minutes to administer,
is sensitive and speciﬁc, and largely uninﬂuenced by level of education,
language or other cultural factors.
Administration
1. Get the patient’s attention then say three unrelated words (eg banana,
sunrise, chair). Ask the patient to repeat the words to conﬁrm registration. If the patient is unable to repeat the words after three attempts
move onto the next item
2. Ask the patient to draw a clock face on a blank sheet of paper. You
should prompt with:
• ‘First draw a large circle’
• ‘Now put all the numbers in the circle’
• ‘Now set the hands to show ten past eleven (11.10)’
Instructions may be repeated, but no more detail/help given. If they have
not completed the clock in three minutes move to the next item.
3. Ask the patient to repeat the three words
Scoring
Give a point for each word correctly recalled after the CDT.
A normal clock scores 2, an abnormal clock scores 0 (see Fig. A.2).
Total score is therefore out of 5 points.
Positive screen for dementia is indicated by:
Score of 0, 1 or 2
Negative screen for dementia is indicated by:
Score of 3, 4 or 5

Routine clinical care
Repeat screening
Hospital – weekly
Care homes – monthly
Community – annually
for special groups
eg. those >75 yrs

1
Medium risk
Observe

Treat*

Document dietary intake
for 3 days if subject in
hospital or care home
If improved or adequate
intake – little clinical
concern; if no improvement
– clinical concern - follow
local policy
Repeat screening
Hospital – weekly
Care home – at least monthly
Community – at least every
2–3 months

All risk categories:
Treat underlying condition and provide help and
advice on food choices, eating and drinking when
necessary.
Record malnutrition risk category.
Record need for special diets and follow local policy.

2 or more
High risk
Refer to dietitian, nutritional
support team or implement
local policy
Improve and increase
overall nutritional intake
Monitor and review care plan
Hospital – weekly
Care home – monthly
Community – monthly
* Unless detrimental or no
benefit is expected from
nutritional support
eg. imminent death.

Obesity:
Record presence of obesity. For those with
underlying conditions, these are generally
controlled before the treatment of obesity.

Re-assess subjects identified at risk as they move through care settings

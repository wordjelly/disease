[START_SECTION]Abdominal Pain
Abdominal pain is an extremely common presenting symptom. The pain
may be acute (sudden onset) or chronic (lasting for more than a few days
or presenting intermittently). It is important to be able to distinguish
causes of abdominal pain which need urgent surgery, e.g. ruptured
aortic aneurysm, perforated diverticular disease, from those that do not,
e.g. biliary colic, ureteric colic, acute pancreatitis. The causes of
abdominal pain are legion and the list below contains some of the more
common causes but is not intended to be comprehensive.

History
Age
Certain conditions are more likely to occur in certain age groups, e.g.
mesenteric adenitis in children, diverticular disease in the elderly.

Pain
■ Time and mode of onset, e.g. sudden, gradual.
■ Character, e.g. dull, vague, cramping, sharp, burning.

[START_SECTION]■ Severity.
■ Constancy, e.g. continuous (peritonitis); intermittent (pain of intestinal
colic).
■ Location: where did it start? Has it moved?
■ Radiation, e.g. loin to groin in ureteric colic.
■ Effect of respiration, movement, food, defecation, micturition and
menstruation.
■ Vomiting.
■ Did vomiting precede the pain?
■ Frequency.
■ Character, e.g. bile, faeculent, blood, coffee grounds.

Defecation
■ Constipation: absolute constipation with colicky abdominal pain,
distension and vomiting suggests intestinal obstruction.
■ Diarrhoea: frequency, consistency of stools, blood, mucus, pus.

Fever
■ Any rigors.

Past history
■ Previous surgery, e.g. adhesions may cause intestinal obstruction.
■ Recent trauma, e.g. delayed rupture of spleen.
■ Menstrual history, e.g. ectopic pregnancy.

Examination
General
Is the patient lying comfortably? Is the patient lying still but in pain, e.g.
peritonitis? Is the patient writhing in agony, e.g. ureteric or biliary colic?
Is the patient flushed, suggesting pyrexia?

[START_SECTION]Pulse, temperature, respiration
Pulse and temperature are raised in inflammatory conditions. They may
also be raised with impending infarction of bowel. An increased
respiratory rate might suggest chest infection referring pain to the
abdomen.

Cervical lymphadenopathy
Associated with mesenteric adenitis.

Chest
Referred pain from lobar pneumonia.

Abdomen
■ Inspection. Does the abdomen move on respiration? Look for scars,
distension, visible peristalsis (usually due to chronic obstruction in
patient with very thin abdominal wall). Check the hernial orifices. Are
there any obvious masses, e.g. visible, pulsatile mass to suggest aortic
aneurysm?
■ Palpation. The patient should be relaxed, lying flat, with arms by side.
Be gentle and start as far from the painful site as possible. Check for
guarding and rigidity. Check for masses, e.g. appendix mass, pulsatile
expansile mass to suggest aortic aneurysm. Carefully examine the
hernial orifices. Examine the testes to exclude torsion.
■ Percussion, e.g. tympanitic note with distension with intestinal
obstruction; dullness over bladder due to acute retention.
■ Auscultation. Take your time (30–60 s); e.g. silent abdomen of
peritonitis; high-pitched tinkling bowel sounds of intestinal obstruction.

Rectal examination
Always carry out a rectal examination.

[START_SECTION]Vaginal examination
There may be discharge or tenderness associated with pelvic
inflammatory disease. Examine the uterus and adnexa, e.g. pregnancy,
fibroids, ectopic pregnancy.

General Investigations
■ FBC, ESR
Hb ↓ peptic ulcer disease, malignancy. WCC ↑ infective/inflammatory
disease, e.g. appendicitis, diverticulitis. ESR ↑ Crohn’s disease, TB.
■ U&Es
Urea and creatinine↑uraemia. Electrolyte disturbances in vomiting and
diarrhoea.
■ LFTs
Abnormal in cholangitis and hepatitis. Often abnormal in acute
cholecystitis.
■ Serum amylase
Markedly raised in acute pancreatitis. Often moderately raised with
perforated peptic ulcer or infarcted bowel.
■ MSU
Blood, protein, culture positive in pyelonephritis. Red cells in ureteric
colic.
■ CXR
Gas under diaphragm (perforated viscus). Lower lobar pneumonia
(referred pain).
■ AXR
Obstruction – dilated loops of bowel. Site of obstruction. Local ileus
(sentinel loop) – pancreatitis, acute appendicitis. Toxic dilatation –
dilated, featureless, oedematous colon in ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s
disease. Renal calculi. Calcified aortic aneurysm. Air in biliary tree
(gallstone ileus). Gallstones (10% radio-opaque).
■ US
Localised abscesses, e.g. appendix abscess, paracolic abscess in

[START_SECTION]diverticular disease. Free fluid – peritonitis, ascites. Aortic aneurysm.
Ectopic pregnancy. Ovarian cyst. Gallstones. Empyema, mucocele of
gall bladder. Kidney – cysts, tumour.

Specific Investigations
■ Blood glucose
Raised in diabetic ketoacidosis.
■ Serum calcium
Hypercalcaemia.
■ CRP
Crohn’s disease.
■ VDRL
Syphilis (tabes dorsalis).
■ Sickling test
Sickle cell disease.
■ Urinary porphobilinogens
Acute intermittent porphyria.
■ ABGs
Metabolic acidosis, e.g. uraemia, infarcted bowel, sepsis, diabetic
ketoacidosis.
■ βHCG
Pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy.
■ ECG
Myocardial infarction (referred pain).
■ OGD
Peptic ulcer. Malignancy.
■ IVU
Stones. Obstruction.
■ Barium enema
Carcinoma. Volvulus. Intussusception.
■ Small bowel enema
Small bowel Crohn’s disease. Lymphoma of small bowel. Carcinoma of
small bowel.

[START_SECTION]■ Duplex Doppler
Superior mesenteric artery stenosis (mesenteric angina). Superior
mesenteric artery thrombosis. Mesenteric venous thrombosis.
■ Angiography
Superior mesenteric embolus or thrombosis.
■ CT
Aneurysm. Pancreatitis. Tumour.
■ MRCP
Biliary tract disease.
• Always examine the hernial orifices.
• Always check for localised tenderness if colicky abdominal
pain becomes constant. Tachycardia, fever and a raised white
cell count suggests infarction.

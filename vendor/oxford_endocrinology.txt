About the Oxford American Handbooks in Medicine
The Oxford American Handbooks are pocket clinical books, providing practical guidance in quick reference, note form. Titles cover major medical specialties or cross-specialty topics and are aimed at students, residents, internists,
family physicians, and practicing physicians within speciﬁc disciplines.
Their reputation is built on including the best clinical information, complemented by hints, tips, and advice from the authors. Each one is carefully
reviewed by senior subject experts, residents, and students to ensure that
content reﬂects the reality of day-to-day medical practice.

Key series features
• Written in short chunks, each topic is covered in a two-page spread
to enable readers to ﬁnd information quickly. They are also perfect
for test preparation and gaining a quick overview of a subject without
scanning through unnecessary pages.
• Content is evidence based and complemented by the expertise and
judgment of experienced authors.
• The Handbooks provide a humanistic approach to medicine—it’s more
than just treatment by numbers.
• A “friend in your pocket,” the Handbooks offer honest, reliable
guidance about the difﬁculties of practicing medicine and provide
coverage of both the practice and art of medicine.
• For quick reference, useful “everyday” information is included on the
inside covers.

This material is not intended to be, and should not be considered, a substitute for medical or other professional advice. Treatment for the conditions described in this material is highly dependent on the individual
circumstances. And, while this material is designed to offer accurate information with respect to the subject matter covered and to be current as
of the time it was written, research and knowledge about medical and
health issues is constantly evolving and dose schedules for medications are
being revised continually, with new side effects recognized and accounted
for regularly. Readers must therefore always check the product information and clinical procedures with the most up-to-date published product information and data sheets provided by the manufacturers and the
most recent codes of conduct and safety regulation. Oxford University

Preface
In this era of rapid electronic transfer of medical information, the question is often posed: “Do we need textbooks anymore, as by the time they
are printed much of the information is outdated?” This question is best
answered by this publication, which offers the reader current, practical,
clinical evidence–based information that will beneﬁt patients with endocrine and metabolic disease. This handbook is not meant to be a fully
comprehensive tome but to act as a quick and easily accessible source of
information.
While we have endeavored to include material that is as current as possible, the many advances occurring in the ﬁeld of endocrinology and diabetes made this a daunting task. This meant including emerging advances in
translational research, molecular biology, genomics, diagnostic tests, and
therapies without sacriﬁcing clinical presentations.
Our expert colleagues, to whom we as co-editors are eternally indebted
and who are too numerous to mention individually, have devoted a considerable amount of time to ensuring the provision of the most relevant
information in a very readable fashion. They accepted their assignments
with grace and a willingness to participate, which made our task as editors
so much easier. We are certain that the reader will enjoy this U.S. version
of the Oxford Handbook of Endocrinology and Diabetes and apply this to
their clinical practice.
We thank the authors of the original British edition, Helen E. Turner and
John A.H. Wass. We also thank the editorial staff of the Oxford University
Press for their professional assistance.

CHAPTER 1

Anatomy and physiology of the thyroid

Anatomy and physiology of
the thyroid

Anatomy
The thyroid gland comprises
• A midline isthmus lying horizontally just below the cricoid cartilage.
• Two lateral lobes that extend upward over the lower half of the
thyroid cartilage.
The gland lies deep to the strap muscles of the neck, enclosed in the pretracheal fascia, which anchors it to the trachea, so that the thyroid moves
up on swallowing.

Histology
Fibrous septa divide the gland into pseudolobules. Pseudolobules are composed of vesicles called follicles or acini, surrounded by a capillary network.
The follicle walls are lined by cuboidal epithelium.
The lumen is ﬁlled with a proteinaceous colloid, which contains the
unique protein thyroglobulin. The peptide sequences of thyroxine (T4)
and tri-iodothyronine (T3) are synthesized and stored as a component
of thyroglobulin.

Development
The thyroid develops from the endoderm of the ﬂoor of the pharynx with
some contribution from the lateral pharyngeal pouches. Descent of the midline thyroid anlage gives rise to the thyroglossal duct, which extends from the
foramen caecum near the base of the tongue to the isthmus of the thyroid.
During development, the posterior aspect of the thyroid becomes associated with the parathyroid gland and the parafollicular C cells, derived
from the ultimobranchial body, which become incorporated into its substance. The C cells are the source of calcitonin and give rise to medullary
thyroid carcinoma when they undergo malignant transformation.
The fetal thyroid begins to concentrate and organify iodine at about
10–12 weeks gestation.
Maternal thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) readily crosses the placenta; maternal thyroid-stimulating (TSH) and T4 do not.
T4 from the fetal thyroid is the major thyroid hormone available to the
fetus. The fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis is a functional unit distinct from that of the mother—active at 18–20 weeks.

ANATOMY

Thyroid examination
Inspection
• Look at the neck from the front. If a goiter (enlarged thyroid gland) is
present, the patient should be asked to swallow a mouthful of water.
The thyroid moves up with swallowing.
• Watch for appearance of any nodule not visible before swallowing;
e.g., in an elderly patient with kyphosis, the thyroid may be partially
retrosternal.
Palpation
• Is the thyroid gland tender to touch?
• With the index and middle ﬁngers feel below the thyroid cartilage
where the isthmus of the thyroid gland lies over the trachea.
• Palpate the two lobes of the thyroid, which extend laterally behind the
sternocleidomastoid muscle.
• Ask the patient to swallow again while you continue to palpate the
thyroid.
• Assess size: soft, ﬁrm, or hard? Assess texture: nodular or diffusely
enlarged? Assess whether it moves readily on swallowing.
• Palpate along the medial edge of the sternocleidomastoid muscle on
either side to look for a pyramidal lobe.
• Palpate for lymph nodes in the neck.
Percussion
• Percuss upper mediastinum for retrosternal goiter.
Auscultation
• Auscultate to identify bruits, consistent with Graves’ disease.
• Occasionally, inspiratory stridor can be heard with a large or
retrosternal goiter causing tracheal compression (b see Pemberton’s
sign, p. 45).
Assess thyroid status
• Observe for signs of thyroid disease—exophthalmos, proptosis,
thyroid acropachy, pretibial myxedema, hyperactivity, restlessness, or
immobility and disinterest.
• Take pulse; note the presence or absence of tachycardia, bradycardia,
or atrial ﬁbrillation.
• Feel palms—assess if they are warm and sweaty or cold.
• Look for tremor in outstretched hands.
• Examine eyes for exophthalmos (forward protrusion of the eyes—
proptosis), lid retraction, sclera visible above cornea, lid lag, conjuctival
injection or edema (cheimosis), periorbital edema, or loss of full-range
movement.

CHAPTER 1

Anatomy and physiology of the thyroid

Physiology
Thyroid hormone contains iodine. Iodine enters the thyroid in the form
of inorganic or ionic iodide, which is organized by the thyroid peroxidase
enzyme at the cell–colloid interface. Subsequent reactions result in the
formation of iodothyronines.
The thyroid is the only source of T4. The thyroid secretes 20% of circulating T3; the remainder is generated in extraglandular tissues by the
conversion of T4 to T3 by deiodinases (largely in the liver and kidneys).
Synthesis of the thyroid hormones can be inhibited by a variety of agents
termed goitrogens.
• Perchlorate and thiocyanate inhibit iodide transport.
• Thioureas and mercaptoimidazole inhibit the initial oxidation of iodide
and coupling of iodothyronines.
• In large doses, iodine blocks organic binding and coupling reactions.
• Lithium has several inhibitory effects on intrathyroidal iodine
metabolism.
In the blood, T4 and T3 are almost entirely bound to plasma proteins. T4
is bound in d order of afﬁnity to T4-binding globulin (TBG), transthyretin
(TTR), and albumin. T3 is bound 10–20 times less avidly by TBG and not
signiﬁcantly by TTR.
Only the free or unbound hormone is available to tissues. The metabolic state correlates more closely with the free than the total hormone
concentration in the plasma. The relatively weak binding of T3 accounts for
its more rapid onset and offset of action.
Table 1.1 summarizes states associated with primary alterations in the
concentration of TBG. When there is primarily an alteration in the concentration of thyroid hormones, the concentration of TBG changes minimally (Table 1.2).
The concentration of free hormones does not necessarily vary directly
with that of the total hormones; e.g., while the total T4 level rises in pregnancy, the free T4 (FT4) level remains normal.

The levels of thyroid hormone in the blood are tightly controlled by
feedback mechanisms involved in the hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid
axis.
• TSH secreted by the pituitary stimulates the thyroid to secrete
principally T4 and also T3. TRH stimulates the synthesis and secretion
of TSH. T4 and T3 inhibit TSH synthesis and secretion directly.
• T4 and T3 are bound to TBG, TTR, and albumin. The remaining free
hormones inhibit synthesis and release of TRH and TSH to inﬂuence
growth and metabolism.
• T4 is converted peripherally to the metabolically active T3 or the
inactive reverse T3 (rT3).
• T4 and T3 are metabolized in the liver by conjugation with glucuronate
and sulfate. Enzyme inducers such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine,
and phenytoin increase the metabolic clearance of the hormones
without decreasing the proportion of free hormone in the blood.

Molecular action of thyroid hormone
T3 is the active form of thyroid hormone. It binds to thyroid hormone
receptors (TRs), of which there are several isoforms and which are members of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. TR/T3 complexes elicit
action by binding to response elements in the DNA of gene promoters.
Recruitment of co-activators alters the chromatin conﬁguration, allowing gene transcription to proceed, whereas co-repressors cause the opposite effect.

Abnormalities of development
Remnants of the thyroglossal duct may be found in any position along the
course of the tract of its descent:
• In the tongue, it is referred to as lingual thyroid.
• Thyroglossal cysts may be visible as midline swellings in the neck.

CHAPTER 1

Anatomy and physiology of the thyroid

• Thyroglossal ﬁstula develops as an opening in the middle of the neck.
• Thyroglossal nodules or
• The pyramidal lobe, a structure contiguous with the thyroid isthmus,
which extends upward.
The gland can descend too far down to reach the anterior mediastinum.
Congenital hypothyroidism results from failure of the thyroid to develop
(agenesis). More commonly, however, congenital hypothyroidism reﬂects
enzyme defects impairing hormone synthesis.

TESTS OF HOMEOSTATIC CONTROL

Thyroid investigations

Tests of hormone concentration
Highly speciﬁc and sensitive chemiluminescent and radioimmunoassays
are used to measure serum T4 and T3 concentrations. Free hormone concentrations usually correlate better with the metabolic state than do total
hormone concentrations because they are unaffected by changes in binding protein concentration or afﬁnity.

Tests of homeostatic control
b See Table 2.1.
Serum TSH concentration is used as ﬁrst line in the diagnosis of primary
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. The test is misleading in patients
with secondary thyroid dysfunction reﬂecting hypothalamic or pituitary
disease.
The TRH stimulation test, which can be used to assess the functional
state of the TSH secretory mechanism, is now rarely used to diagnose
primary thyroid disease, since it has been superseded by sensitive TSH
assays. Its main use is in the differential diagnosis of elevated TSH in the
setting of elevated thyroid hormone levels and in the differential diagnosis
of resistance to thyroid hormone and a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma
(Table 2.3).
In interpreting results of thyroid function tests (TFTs), the effects of
drugs that the patient might be on should be considered. Table 2.2 lists
the inﬂuence of drugs on TFTs. Table 2.3 gives some examples of a typical
TFT panel.

Box 2.1 Thyroid hormone resistance (RTH)
• This syndrome is characterized by reduced responsiveness to
elevated circulating levels of free T4 and free T3, normal or elevated
serum TSH, and intact TSH responsiveness to TRH. Clinical features
apart from goiter are usually absent but may include short stature,
hyperactivity disorders, and attention deﬁcits with mental or learning
disabilities.
• The etiology is a mutation in the thyroid hormone receptor.
• Differential diagnosis includes TSH-secreting pituitary tumor.
• Most cases require no treatment. If therapy is needed, B-adrenergic
blockers may be used to ameliorate the tissue effects of raised
thyroid hormone levels.

CHAPTER 2

Thyroid investigations

Antibody screen
High titers of antithyroid peroxidase (anti-TPO) antibodies or antithyroglobulin antibodies are found in patients with autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, and, sometimes, euthyroid
individuals). b See Table 2.4.
The American Thyroid Association recommends that adults be screened
for thyroid dysfunction with serum TSH measurement, beginning at age 35
years and every 5 years thereafter.1

Screening for thyroid disease2
The following categories of patients are at risk for thyroid disease and
screening should be considered:
• Patients with atrial ﬁbrillation or hyperlipidemia
• Periodic (within every 6 months) assessment in patients receiving
medications such as amiodarone hydrochloride and lithium carbonate.
• Annual check of thyroid function in annual review of diabetic patients
• Women with type 1 diabetes in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy and
post-delivery (3-fold increase in incidence of postpartum thyroid
dysfunction in such patients)
• Women with a past history of postpartum thyroiditis
• Previous thyroid dysfunction or goiter
• History of surgery or radiotherapy affecting the thyroid gland
• Vitiligo
• Pernicious anemia
• Consider annual check of thyroid function in people with Down
syndrome, Turner syndrome, and primary adrenal insufﬁciency (Addison’s
disease) in light of the high prevalence of hypothyroidism in such patients.
• Women with thyroid autoantibodies have 8 × risk of developing
hypothyroidism over 20 years compared to antibody-negative controls
• Women with thyroid autoantibodies and isolated elevated TSH have
38 × risk of developing hypothyroidism, with 4% annual risk of overt
hypothyroidism.

SCINTISCANNING

Scintiscanning
This scanning enables localization of sites of accumulation of radioiodine
or sodium pertechnetate [99mTc], which gives information about the activity of the iodine trap (Table 2.5). This can be used
• To deﬁne areas of hyper- or hypofunction within the thyroid (Table 2.6).
It can be useful to differentiate among causes of thyrotoxicosis
(i.e., Graves’ disease vs. toxic nodular goiter vs. thyroiditis).
• Provide information about the size and shape of the thyroid gland
(detect retrosternal goiter; ectopic thyroid tissue).

The scan may be altered by
• Agents that inﬂuence thyroid uptake: high-iodine foods and
supplements, such as kelp (seaweed)
• Drugs containing iodine, such as amiodarone
• Recent use of radiographic contrast dyes, which can potentially
interfere with the interpretation of the scan

ULTRASOUND (US) SCANNING

Ultrasound (US) scanning
Ultrasound provides an accurate indication of thyroid size and is useful
for differentiating cystic nodules from solid ones, but it cannot be used to
distinguish between benign and malignant disease deﬁnitively. Please see
the Revised American Thyroid Association Management Guidelines for
Patients with Thyroid Nodules and Differentiated Thyroid Cancer (2009)
for further details.

Diagnostic features
• Microcalciﬁcation within nodules favors the diagnosis of malignancy;
microcalciﬁcations <2 mm in diameter are observed in ~60% of
malignant nodules, but in <2% of benign lesions.
• Calciﬁcation is a prominent feature of medullary carcinoma of the
thyroid.
• US can detect whether a nodule is solitary or part of a multinodular
process.
• Irregular nodule capsule is more common in malignancy.

Uses
• Sequential scanning can be employed to assess changes in size of
thyroid over time.
• Assess neck lymph nodes in thyroid cancer patients
Note: Neither scintigraphy nor US is routinely indicated in a patient
with goiter.

CHAPTER 2

Thyroid investigations

Fine needle aspiration (FNAC) cytology
FNAC is now considered the most accurate test for diagnosis of thyroid
nodules. It is performed in an outpatient setting.
One to two aspirations are drawn with a 23- to 27-gauge needle, inserted
into different sites of each nodule; aspiration is carried out at different
sites for each nodule. Cytological ﬁndings are satisfactory or diagnostic in
approximately 85% of specimens and nondiagnostic in the remainder.
In experienced hands, FNAC is an excellent diagnostic technique, as
shown in Table 2.7.
Repeat FNAC after 3–6 months further reduces the proportion of false
negatives. FNAC cannot be used to differentiate between benign and
malignant follicular neoplasm.
Surgical excision of a follicular neoplasm is always indicated.

Computed tomography (CT)
CT is useful in evaluation of retrosternal and retrotracheal extension of
an enlarged thyroid.
Compression of the trachea and displacement of the major vessels can
be identiﬁed with CT of the superior mediastinum.
CT can demonstrate the extent of intrathoracic extension of thyroid
malignancy and inﬁltration of adjacent structures, such as the carotid artery,
internal jugular vein, trachea, esophagus, and regional lymph nodes.
Use of CT imaging with iodine-containing radiocontrast dye interferes
with further radioiodine imaging and treatment for at least 6 weeks.
Urinary iodine testing can be useful to help determine when further radioiodine imaging and treatment can be performed.

SICK EUTHYROID SYNDROME

Additional laboratory investigations
Hematological tests
Long-standing thyrotoxicosis may be associated with a normochromic
anemia and, occasionally, mild neutropenia, lymphocytosis, and, rarely,
thrombocytopenia.
In hypothyroidism, a macrocytosis is typical, although concurrent vitamin B12 deﬁciency should be considered.
There may also be a microcytic anemia due to menorrhagia and impaired
iron utilization.

Biochemical tests
Alkaline phosphatase may be elevated in thyrotoxicosis.
Mild hypercalcemia may occur in thyrotoxicosis and reﬂects i bone
resorption. Hypercalciuria is more common.
In a hypothyroid patient, hyponatremia may be due to an inability to
suppress antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and/or reduced renal tubular water
loss, resulting in retention of ingested water. Less commonly, it may be
due to coexisting cortisol deﬁciency.
In hypothyroidism, creatine kinase is often raised and the lipid proﬁle
altered with i low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.

Endocrine tests
In untreated hypothyroidism, there may be inadequate responses to
provocative testing of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis. In
hypothyroidism, serum prolactin may be elevated as a result of i TRH.
In thyrotoxicosis there is an increase in sex hormone binding globulin
(SHBG) and a complex interaction with sex steroid hormone metabolism,
resulting in changes in the levels of androgens and estrogens. The net
physiological result is an increase in estrogenic activity, with gynecomastia
and a decrease in libido and erectile dysfunction in males.

Sick euthyroid syndrome
(non-thyroidal illness syndrome)
• Biochemistry:
• Low T and T
4
3
• Inappropriately normal/suppressed TSH
• Tissue thyroid hormone concentrations are very low.
• Clinical context—starvation
• Severe illness, e.g., severe infections, renal failure, cardiac failure,
liver failure, end-stage malignancy
• Thyroxine replacement is not indicated because there is no clear
evidence that treatment is effective.

CHAPTER 2

Thyroid investigations

Atypical clinical situations
• Thyrotoxicosis factitia
• No thyroid enlargement
• Elevated free T and suppressed TSH

• Depressed thyroid uptake on scintigraphy
• Low thyroglobulin differentiates from thyroiditis (which shows
depressed uptake on scintigraphy but i thyroglobulin) and all other
causes of elevated thyroid hormones.
• Struma ovarii (ovarian teratoma containing hyperfunctioning thyroid
tissue)
• No thyroid enlargement
• Depressed thyroid uptake on scintigraphy
• A body scan after radioiodine conﬁrms diagnosis.
• Trophoblast tumors: human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has
structural homology with TSH and leads to thyroid gland stimulation,
and usually mild thyrotoxicosis.
• Hyperemesis gravidarum: Thyroid function tests may be abnormal with a
suppressed TSH (b see Chapter 3, p. 31, and Chapter 62, p. 348).
• Choriocarcinoma of the testes may be associated with gynecomastia and
thyrotoxicosis—measure hCG.

ETIOLOGY

Thyrotoxicosis

Etiology
Epidemiology
Graves’ autoimmune thyroid disease is 5 x more common in women than
in men. Annual incidence is 0.5 cases per 1000.

Deﬁnition of thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism
The term thyrotoxicosis denotes the clinical, physiological, and biochemical
ﬁndings that result when the tissues are exposed to excess thyroid hormone. It can arise in a variety of ways (Table 3.1). It is essential to establish
a speciﬁc diagnosis as this determines therapy choices and provides important information for the patient regarding prognosis.
The term hyperthyroidism should be used to denote conditions in which
hyperfunction of the thyroid leads to thyrotoxicosis.

Genetics of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD)
AITD consists of Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, atrophic
autoimmune hypothyroidism, postpartum thyroiditis, and thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy—conditions that appear to share a common genetic
predisposition. There is a female preponderance.
Twin studies show a concordance for Graves’ disease and autoimmune
hypothyroidism in monozygotic compared to dizygotic twins.
It is estimated that genetic factors account for 79% of the susceptibility for Graves’ disease. Sibling studies indicate that sisters and children
of women with Graves’ disease have a 5–8% risk of developing Graves’
disease or autoimmune hypothyroidism.
On the background of a genetic predisposition, environmental factors
are thought to contribute to the development of disease. A number of
interacting susceptibility genes are thought to play a role in the development of disease.
Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) is associated with Graves’
disease in Caucasian populations. Speciﬁcally, the CT60 allele has a prevalence of 60% in the general population, but is also the allele most highly
associated with Graves’ disease, indicating the complex nature of genetic
susceptibility and interplay of environmental factors.
Association of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci with Graves’
disease has been demonstrated in some populations, but not others. HLADR3 is associated with Graves’ disease in whites. HLA-DQA1*0501 is
associated in some populations, especially for men. However, the overall
contribution of MHC genes to Graves’ disease has been estimated to be
only 10–20% of the inherited susceptibility.

Manifestations of hyperthyroidism
Investigation of thyrotoxicosis
• Thyroid function tests reveal elevated FT4 and suppressed TSH
(elevated free T3 [FT3] in T3 toxicosis).
• Thyroid antibodies—b see Table 2.4 (p. 10)
• Radionucleotide thyroid scan if necessary to conﬁrm Graves ‘
hyperthyroidism and exclude other causes (i.e., painless thyroiditis)
(b see p. 169)

TREATMENT

Treatment
Medical treatment
In general, the standard policy in Europe is to offer a course of antithyroid drugs (ATD) ﬁrst. In the United States, radioiodine is more likely to
be offered as ﬁrst-line treatment. See the American Thyroid Association
(ATA) Treatment Guidelines for Patients with Hyperthyroidism and
Hypothyroidism (1995) for further details.
Aims and principles of medical treatment
• To induce remission in Graves’ disease
• Monitor for relapse off treatment initially every 6–8 weeks for 6
months, then every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter
or sooner if symptoms return.
• For patients who relapse, consider deﬁnitive treatment such as
radioiodine or surgery. A second course of ATD rarely results in
remission.
Choice of drugs—thionamides
Methimazole has a longer duration of action and can be given as a single
dose. Carbimazole, the drug of choice in the UK, is converted to methimazole by cleavage of a carboxyl side chain on ﬁrst liver passage. Methimazole
and propylthiouracil are used widely in the United States and elsewhere in
the world. Propylthiouracil is limited by tid dosing.
During pregnancy and lactation propylthiouracil (PTU) is the drug of
choice given the association between PTU and fatal hepatotoxicity, PTU
may be the drug of choice during the ﬁrst trimester, however this remains
an area of controversy. Methimazole is often recommended for second and
third trimester although does have associated risks, such as aplasia cutis.
Action of thionamides
Thyroid hormone synthesis is inhibited by blockade of the action of thyroid peroxidase. Thionomides are especially actively accumulated in thyrotoxic tissue.
Propylthiouracil also inhibits extrathyroidal conversion of T4 to T3 by
type 1 deiodinase, and thus may have advantages when given at high doses
in severe thyrotoxicosis.
Dose and effectiveness
A does of 5 mg of carbimazole is roughly equivalent to 50 mg of propylthiouracil. Carbimazole dosing is 740% higher than methimazole.
Propylthiouracil has a theoretical advantage of inhibiting the conversion of
T4 to T3, and T3 levels decline more rapidly after starting the drug.
According to the ATA, initial daily doses of methimazole range from
10–40 mg daily and for PTU 100–600 mg daily.
Most ATDs as primary therapy are given for 6 months to 2 years, as
there is no established standard for duration of therapy with ATDs.
From 30 to 40% of patients treated with an ATD remain euthyroid 10
years after discontinuation of therapy. If hyperthyroidism recurs after
treatment with an ATD, there is little chance that a second course of
treatment will result in permanent remission. Young patients, smokers,

21

22

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

and those with large goiters, ophthalmopathy, or high serum concentrations of thyrotropin receptor antibody at the time of diagnosis are unlikely
to have a permanent remission.
B-Adrenergic antagonists
Propranolol 10–40 mg up to four times daily or longer-acting B-blockers
can be used to control symptoms such as anxiety, tremor, and palpitations. Relief may be appreciated in the initial 4–8 weeks of treatment.
Atrial ﬁbrillation (AF)
AF should convert to sinus rhythm—otherwise, cardiovert after 4 months
euthyroid.
Side effects
ATDs are generally well tolerated. Uncommonly, patients may complain
of gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms or changes in sense of taste and smell.
Agranulocytosis represents a potentially fatal but rare side effect of
ATD occurring in 0.1–0.5% of patients. Because cross-reactivity between
ATDs has been reported, and may be idiosyncratic and dose dependent,
it is not recommended to switch from one ATD if agranulocytosis has
developed to another. It is controversial whether agranulocytosis is more
frequent with methimazole or propylthiouracil.
Agranulocytosis usually occurs within the ﬁrst 3 months after initiation
of therapy (97% within the ﬁrst 6 months, especially on higher doses).
Although rare, it is important to be aware of the documented cases, which
have occurred a long time after starting treatment.
As agranulocytosis occurs very suddenly and is potentially fatal, routine
monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) is thought to be of little use.
Patients typically present with fever and evidence of infection, usually in
the oropharynx, and each patient should therefore receive written instructions to discontinue antithyroid drug therapy and contact their doctor for a
CBC should a severe sore throat and fever arise.
Neutrophil dyscrasias occur more frequently in males; however these
are more often fatal in the elderly.
Allergic-type reactions are more common in the form of rash, urticaria,
and arthralgia, which occur in 1–5% of patients taking these drugs. These
side effects are often mild and do not usually necessitate drug withdrawal,
although one ATD may be substituted for another in the expectation that
the second agent may be taken without side effects.
Thionamides may cause cholestatic jaundice; elevated serum aminotransaminases and fulminant hepatic failure have also been reported.
However, hepatic necrosis due to PTU and cholestatic jaundice due to
methimazole is rare enough that routine liver function tests monitoring is
unnecessary, according to the American Thyroid Association.1
All patients should be given written and verbal warnings about the
potential side effects of thionamides.
Rarely, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-positive vasculitis develops with propylthiouracil therapy, manifesting as arthralgias,
1 Singer PA, Cooper DS, Levy EG, et al. (1995). Treatment guidelines for patients with hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. JAMA 273:808–812.

TREATMENT

skin lesions, glomerulonephritis, fever, and/or alveolar hemorrhage. Skin
lesions include ulcers. Biopsy reveals vasculitis. Treatment is discontinuation of propylthiouracil and initiation of steroids if needed.
Treatment regimen
Two alternative regimens are practiced for Graves’ disease: dose titration
and block and replace.
Dose titration regime
The primary aim is to achieve a euthyroid state with relatively high drug
doses and then to maintain euthyroidism with a low stable dose.
The dose of methimazole or propylthiouracil is titrated according to the
thyroid function tests performed every 4–8 weeks, aiming for a serum free
T4 in the normal range and a detectable TSH. High serum TSH indicates
the need for a dose reduction. TSH may remain suppressed for weeks or
months.
The typical starting dose of methimazole is 10–20 mg/day. Higher initial
doses (40 mg) may be indicated in severe hyperthyroidism.
When the plasma FT4 level returns to normal, the dose should be
adjusted to maintain normal FT4 levels. No consensus exists on the optimal
duration of therapy, although 12 months to 24 months is most common.
Relapses are most likely to occur within the ﬁrst year and may be more
likely in the presence of a large goiter and high T4 level at the time of
diagnosis, or the presence of TSH-receptor antibodies at the end of treatment (b see p. 33.)
Patients with multinodular goiters and thyrotoxicosis frequently relapse
on cessation of antithyroid medication, and deﬁnitive treatment with
radioiodine or surgery is usually advised. Long-term low-dose thionamide
therapy is also an option.
Block and replace regimen
After achieving an euthyroid state on methimazole or PTU alone, T4 at a
dose of 100 mcg can be prescribed. The patient can be continued on the
combination of antithyroid drug and T4 for an additional 12–24 months. If the
size of the gland returns to normal or the former time period is reached, the
drugs are discontinued. The main advantages of this regimen are fewer hospital visits for checks of thyroid function and shorter duration of treatment.
Most patients achieve an euthyroid state within 4–6 weeks of carbimazole therapy.
During treatment, FT4 values are measured 4 weeks after starting thyroxine and the dose of thyroxine is altered, if necessary, in 25 mcg increments to maintain FT4 in the normal range. Most patients do not require
any dose adjustment.
The originally reported higher remission rate was not conﬁrmed in a
large, prospective, multicenter European trial when combination treatment was compared to carbimazole alone, but side effects were more
common.2
Relapses are most likely to occur within the ﬁrst year.

Radioiodine treatment—radioiodine therapy
b See Table 3.2.
Indications
• Deﬁnitive treatment of multinodular goiter or adenoma
• Relapsed Graves’ disease
Contraindications
• Young children, because of the potential risk of thyroid carcinogenesis
• Pregnant and lactating women
• Situations where it is clear that the safety of other people cannot be
guaranteed
Graves’ ophthalmopathy
There is some evidence that Graves’ ophthalmopathy may worsen after
the administration of radioactive iodine, especially in smokers. In cases of
moderate to severe ophthalmopathy, radioiodine may be avoided.
Alternatively, steroid cover in a dose of 40 mg prednisone daily should
be given on the day of administering radioiodine, with taper over the next
1–2 months following radioiodine treatment. It is essential that euthyroidism be closely maintained following radioiodine to avoid worsening
of ophthalmopathy.

TREATMENT

Caveats
• The control of disease may not occur for a period of weeks or a few
months.
• More than one treatment may be needed in some patients, depending
on the dose given; 15% require a second dose and a few patients
require a third dose. The second dose should only be considered at
least 6 months after the ﬁrst dose.
• Compounds that contain iodine, such as amiodarone, block iodine
uptake for a period of several months following cessation of therapy.
Iodine uptake measurements may be helpful in this instance in
determining the activity required and the timing of radioiodine therapy.
• Women of childbearing age should avoid pregnancy for a minimum of
6 months following radioactive iodine ablation.
• The prevalence of hypothyroidism is about 50% at 10 years and
continues to increase thereafter.
Side effects are rare
• Anterior neck pain caused by radiation-induced thyroiditis
• Transient rise (72 hours) in plasma T4 may occur within the ﬁrst 2
weeks after therapy, which may exacerbate heart failure if present.
Hypothyroidism after radioiodine
After radioiodine administration, ATDs may be restarted. The ATDs
should be withdrawn gradually, guided by TFTs every 6–8 weeks. Early
post-radioiodine hypothyroidism may be transient. TSH should be monitored initially, then annually after radioiodine therapy to determine lateonset hypothyroidism.
In patients treated for autonomous toxic nodules, the incidence of
hypothyroidism is lower since the toxic nodule takes up the radioactive iodine; the surrounding tissue will recover normal function once the
hyperthyroidism is controlled, though this is disputed by some experts.
Cancer risk after radioiodine therapy
In a recent large series, no overall excess risk of cancer was found. It is
unclear whether the risk of death from thyroid cancer is slightly higher.
Clinical guidelines
The goal is to administer enough radioiodine to achieve euthyroidism with
the acceptance of a moderate rate of hypothyroidism, e.g., 15–20% at 2
years.
Instructions to patients before treatment
Discontinue ATDs 2–7 days before radioiodine administration, since their
effects last for 24 hours or more, though PTU has a prolonged radioprotective effect. ATDs may be restarted 3–7 days after radioiodine administration without signiﬁcantly affecting the delivered radiation dose.
Administration of radioiodine (Table 3.2)
• Radioactive iodine-131 is administered orally as a capsule or a drink.
• No universal agreement exists regarding optimal dose. Dosing
according to size alone is not successful in 90% of cases.

25

26

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

• A dose of 10–21.6 mCi (400–800 MBq) should be sufﬁcient to cure
hyperthyroidism in 90%.
• Most patients are treated with 10–16 mCi (400–600 MBq) as the ﬁrst
dose.
• It is contraindicated in women who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
• For precaution, b see Table 3.3.
Outcomes of radioiodine treatment
In general, 50–70% of patients have restored normal thyroid function
within 6–8 weeks of receiving radioiodine. Shrinkage of goiter occurs but
is slower.

Surgery
Thyroidectomy is rarely recommended for patients with Graves’ disease.
Indications for subtotal or total thyroidectomy include patients with very
large, multinodular goiters causing obstruction of the airway, or those
who cannot tolerate or are noncompliant with antithyroid drugs. Pregnant
women with severe Graves’ disease allergic to antithyroid therapy may be
advised to undergo surgery.
There is disagreement regarding which operation to perform. Often
patients require LT4 following thyroidectomy. See Box 3.2.
Indications
• Documented suspicious or malignant thyroid nodule by FNAC
• Pregnant mothers who are not adequately controlled by ATDs or in
whom serious allergic reactions develop while being treated medically.
Thyroidectomy is usually performed in the second trimester.
Thyroidectomy is also indicated in the following patients:
• Those who reject or fear exposure to radiation
• Those with poor compliance to medical treatment
• Those in whom a rapid control of symptoms is desired

Box 3.2 Complications of thyroidectomy
Immediate
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage
• Hypoparathyroidism
• Thyroid crisis
• Local hemorrhage, causing laryngeal edema
• Wound infection
Late
• Hypothyroidism
• Keloid formation

of benign thyroid disease. London: Royal College of Physicians of London[JH2].

TREATMENT

• Those with severe manifestations of Graves’ ophthalmopathy, since
total and subtotal thyroidectomy does not worsen eye manifestations
• Those with relapsed Graves’ disease
• Those with local compressive symptoms that may not improve
rapidly with radioiodine. Operation removes these symptoms in most
patients.
• Those with large thyroid glands and relatively low radioiodine uptake
Preparation of patients for surgery
ATDs should be used preoperatively to achieve euthyroidism (approximately 6 weeks).
B-blockers can be added as preparation for surgery, especially in those
patients where surgery must be performed sooner than achieving euthyroid state.
Potassium iodide, 5 drops twice daily, can be used during the preoperative period (for 7–10 days) to reduce the vascularity of the gland.
Operating later than this can be associated with exacerbation of thyrotoxicosis as the thyroid escapes from the inhibitory effect of the iodide.
In practice, it is rarely needed, as good control of thyrotoxicosis can be
achieved with ATDs in the majority of patients.
In patients who are noncompliant with ATDs and thyrotoxic prior to
surgery, hospital inpatient admission may be necessary for supervised
administration of high-dose ATDs, together with B-blockade, and measurement of FT4 and FT3 twice weekly. There is a risk of thyroid crisis, or
storm, if a patient undergoes operation when thyrotoxic.
Most patients can be rendered euthyroid within 2–4 weeks and potassium iodide can be administered as above to coincide with the timing of
surgery.
Additional measures are as for thyroid storm.

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

Thyroid crisis (storm)
Thyroid crisis represents a rare but life-threatening exacerbation of the
manifestations of thyrotoxicosis. It should be promptly recognized since
the condition is associated with a signiﬁcant mortality; see Box 3.3. Thyroid
crisis develops in uncontrolled hyperthyroid patients who
• Have a complicating acute infection.
• Undergo thyroidal or non-thyroidal surgery or (rarely) radioiodine
treatment.
Thyroid crisis should be considered in a very sick patient if there is
• Recent history suggestive of thyrotoxicosis.
• Acute stressful precipitating factor such as surgery.
• History of previous thyroid treatment.

Laboratory investigations
• Routine hematology may indicate a leukocytosis, which is well
recognized in thyrotoxicosis even in the absence of infection.
• The biochemical screen may reveal a raised alkaline phosphatase and
mild hypercalcaemia.
• Thyroid function tests and thyroid antibodies should be requested,
although treatment should not be delayed while awaiting the results.
• Thyroid hormone levels will be raised but may not be grossly elevated
and are usually within the range of uncomplicated thyrotoxicosis.

Treatment
General supportive therapy
The patient is best managed in an intensive care unit where close attention
can be paid to cardiorespiratory status, ﬂuid balance, and cooling.
Standard antiarrhythmic drugs may need to be used, including digoxin
(usually in higher than normal dose) after correction for hypokalemia.
Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be given if infection is suspected.
Speciﬁc treatment
The aim is to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis completely.
• Antithyroid drugs in large doses (propylthiouracil or methimazole) i.e.,
PTU 200–300 mg every 6 hours via nasogastric (NG) tube if necessary.
Propylthiouracil is preferred because of its ability to block T4-to-T3
conversion in peripheral tissues. Alternatively, methimaole 60 mg
every 24 hours can be given. ATDs should be started ﬁrst and quickly.

THYROID CRISIS (STORM)

• Potassium iodide 10 drops, twice daily, after starting antithyroid drugs,
will inhibit thyroid hormone release.
• B-Adrenergic blocking agents are essential in management to control
tachycardia, tremor, and other adrenergic manifestations.
• Propranolol 160–480 mg/day in divided doses or as an infusion at a
rate of 2–5 mg/h.
• Calcium channel blockers can be tried in patients with known
bronchospastic disease or severe heart failure when B-blockade is
contraindicated.
• High doses of glucocorticoids are capable of blocking T4-to-T3
conversion: prednisone 60 mg daily or hydrocortisone 50 mg IV every
6 hours.
• Plasmapheresis and peritoneal dialysis may be effective in cases
resistant to the usual pharmacological measures in order to remove
high levels of circulating thyroid hormones.
• Colestyramine (3 g tid) reduces the enterohepatic circulation of
thyroid hormones and may help improve thyrotoxicosis.

Subclinical hyperthyroidism
Values of thyroid hormones should be repeated to exclude nonthyroidal
illness.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is deﬁned as undetectable thyrotropin (TSH)
concentration in patients with normal levels of T4 and T3. Subtle symptoms
and signs of thyrotoxicosis may be present.
It may be classiﬁed as endogenous in patients with thyroid hormone
production associated with nodular thyroid disease or underlying Graves’
disease, and as exogenous in those with undetectable serum thyrotropin
concentrations as a result of treatment with levothyroxine.
Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a risk factor for development of atrial
ﬁbrillation or osteoporosis.1
The increased risk of fracture reported in older women taking thyroid
hormone disappears when those with a history of hyperthyroidism are
excluded.
In many patients with endogeneous subclinical hyperthyroidism who
do not have nodular thyroid disease or complications of excess thyroid
hormone, treatment is unnecessary, but TFTs should be performed every
6 months.
In older patients with atrial ﬁbrillation or osteoporosis that could have
been caused or exacerbated by mild excess of thyroid hormone, ablative
therapy with 131I is the best initial option.
In patients with exogeneous subclinical hyperthyroidism, the dose of
levothyroxine should be reduced, excluding those with prior thyroid cancer in whom thyrotropin suppression may be required. The dose of levothyroxine used for treating hypothyroidism may also be reduced if the
patient develops the following:

mortality in elderly people from one low serum thyrotropin result: a 10-year cohort study. Lancet

30

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

• New-onset atrial ﬁbrillation, angina, or cardiac failure
• Accelerated bone loss
• Borderline high serum T3 concentration

Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP)
TTP is more common in Asians (5–10% of all with thyrotoxicosis due to
Graves’ disease or multinodular goiter) (0.1–0.2% of non-Asian Europeans/
North Americans). The etiology is probably disordered function of ion
channels in muscle cell membranes.
TPP is the most common form of acquired periodic paralysis. The usual
age of onset is 20–40 years and it occurs mostly in men.
There are recurrent episodes of painless muscle weakness lasting minutes to days. Flaccid paralysis occurs, usually spreading from the legs proximally, with depressed or absent deep tendon reﬂexes.
Clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis may be few, thus TSH should
be checked in anyone presenting with periodic paralysis The condition
improves as thyrotoxicosis is treated.
Serum potassium is low during attacks. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK)
is i during the recovery phase.
TPP is precipitated by carbohydrate intake, insulin, cold, and vigorous
exercise.
Treatment is with potassium replacement, usually by oral route.
However, in treatment of thyrotoxicosis, one needs to avoid overtreatment of hypokalemia resulting in hyperkalemia.
Symptoms usually improve within 2–4 hours; full resolution in 24–48
hours.
Nonselective B-blockers, such as propranolol (3 mg/kg), help reverse
attacks as well as prevent attacks until a euthyroid state is achieved.

THYROTOXICOSIS IN PREGNANCY

Thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy
b Also see p. 53.
Thyrotoxicosis occurs in about 0.2% of pregnancies. Graves’ disease
accounts for 90% of cases.
Less common causes include toxic adenoma and multinodular goiter.
Other causes are gestational hyperthyroidism (hyperemesis gravidarum)
and trophoblastic neoplasia.
Diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis during pregnancy may be difﬁcult or delayed
due to the normal physiological changes of pregnancy, which are similar to
those of hyperthyroidism
Total T4 and T3 are elevated in pregnancy secondary to an elevated
level of TBG. Free hormone assays can be used to better assess thyroid
function.
Physiological features of normal pregnancy include an increase in basal
metabolic rate, cardiac stroke volume, palpitations, and heat intolerance.
Serum free T3 concentrations remain within the normal range in most
pregnant women; serum TSH concentration decreases during the ﬁrst
trimester.

Symptoms
Hyperemesis gravidarum may cause mild hyperthyroidism, also known as
“gestational thyrotoxicosis.” Tiredness, palpitations, insomnia, heat intolerance, proximal muscle weakness, shortness of breath, and irritability
may be presenting symptoms.
Thyrotoxicosis may occasionally be diagnosed when the patient presents
with pregnancy-induced hypertension or congestive heart failure.

Signs
• Failure to gain weight despite a good appetite
• Persistent tachycardia with a pulse rate >90 beats/min at rest
• Other signs of thyrotoxicosis as described previously

Natural history of Graves’ disease in pregnancy
There is aggravation of symptoms in the ﬁrst half of the pregnancy, amelioration of symptoms in the second half of the pregnancy, and often recurrence of symptoms in the postpartum period.

Transient hyperthyroidism of gestational hyperthyroidism
(hyperemesis gravidarum)
The mechanism is likely due to raised B-hCG level, which activates the
TSH receptor.
B-hCG, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH),
and TSH are glycoprotein hormones that contain a common A-subunit and
a hormone-speciﬁc B-subunit. There is an inverse relationship between
the serum levels of TSH and hCG, best seen in early pregnancy. Structural
homology exists between the TSH and hCG receptors.
Serum free T4 concentration may be i and the TSH levels suppressed
in women with hyperemesis gravidarum.
Thyroid function tests recover after the resolution of hyperemesis.

31

32

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

Pregnant women with gestational hyperthyroidism (hyperemesis gravidarum), accounting for 2/3 of hyperemesis, are not usually given ATD
treatment but managed supportively with ﬂuids, antiemetics, and nutritional support.
There is no i risk of thyrotoxicosis in subsequent pregnancies.
This condition can be differentiated from Graves’ disease by the absence
of a goiter, antithyroid antibodies, family history of Graves’ disease, history
of other autoimmune phenomena, or a previous history of ophthalmic
Graves’ disease.

Management of Graves’ disease in the mother
The aim of treatment is alleviation of thyroid symptoms and normalization of thyroid function tests in the shortest time. Patients should be seen
every 4–8 weeks and TFTs performed. Serum free T4 is the best test to
follow the response to ATDs. Block and replace regimen should not be
used, as this will result in fetal hypothyroidism.
Both propylthiouracil (250 mg daily in divided doses or less) and methimazole
control the disease in pregnancy; however, given the recent data regarding the
risk of fatal hepatotoxicity with PTU, in an alert issued on 6/4/2009, the FDA
recommended that given the risk of fetal hepatotoxicity, “PTU may be more
appropriate for patients with Graves’ disease who are in their ﬁrst trimester
of pregnancy.” The choice of antithyroid agent during pregnancy remains controversial. PTU is more bound to plasma proteins and theoretically less of the
drug would be transferred to the fetus than would methimazole. In addition,
methimazole has been associated with aplasia cutis. A B-blocker (propranolol
20–40 mg q6–8h) is effective in controlling the hypermetabolic symptoms but
should be used only for a few weeks until symptoms abate.
The dosage of ATDs is frequently adjusted during the course of the
pregnancy; therefore, thyroid tests should be done at 2- to 4-week intervals, with the goal of keeping free thyroid hormone levels in the upper 1/3
of the reference range.
Thyroid tests may normalize spontaneously with the progression of a
normal pregnancy as a result of immunological changes.
The use of iodides and radioiodine is contraindicated in pregnancy because
it crosses the placenta and may cause toxicity to the fetal thyroid gland.
Surgery is rarely performed in pregnancy. It is reserved for patients not
responding to ATDs. It is preferable to perform surgery in the second
trimester.
Breast-feeding mothers should be treated with the lowest possible dose
of propylthiouracil or methimazole. The low levels of ATD in breast milk
do not affect the fetal thyroid gland.

Pre-pregnancy counseling
Hyperthyroid women who want to conceive should attain euthyroidism
before conception, since uncontrolled hyperthyroidism is associated with
an i risk of congenital abnormalities (most seriously, stillbirth and cranial
synostosis). b See Table 3.3.
There is no evidence that radioactive iodine treatment given to the
mother 6 months or more before pregnancy has an adverse effect on the
fetus or on offspring in later life.

THYROTOXICOSIS IN PREGNANCY

Antithyroid medication requirements decrease during gestation; in
about 50–60% of patients, the dose may be discontinued in the last few
weeks of gestation.
The risk of recurrent hyperthyroidism should be discussed with the
patient. The rare occurrence of fetal and neonatal hyperthyroidism should
be included during counseling sessions and the diagnosis of Graves’ hyperthyroidism conveyed to the obstetrician and neonatologist.

Management of the fetus
The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis is well developed at 12 weeks
gestation but remains inactive until 18–20 weeks. Circulating TSH receptor antibodies (TSH-RAb) in the mother can cross the placenta. The risk
of hyperthyroidism to the neonate can be assessed by measuring TSHRAb in the maternal circulation at the beginning of the third trimester.
Antithyroglobulin antibodies and thyroid peroxidase antibodies have no
effect on the fetus.
Long-term follow-up studies of children whose mothers received either
methimazole or propylthiouracil have not shown an i incidence of any
physical or psychological defects.
Monitoring of the fetal heart rate and growth rate is the standard means
by which fetal thyrotoxicosis may be detected. A rate >160 beats/min is
suspicious of fetal thyrotoxicosis in the third trimester. Fetal thyrotoxicosis may complicate the latter part of the pregnancy of women with
Graves’ disease even if they have previously been treated with radioiodine
or surgery, since TSH receptor antibodies may persist.
If there is evidence of fetal thyrotoxicosis, the dose of ATD should be
increased. If this causes maternal hypothyroidism a small dose of T4 can be
added since, unlike methimazole, T4 crosses the placenta less. A pediatrician should be involved to monitor neonatal thyroid function and detect
thyrotoxicosis.
Hypothyroidism in the mother should be avoided because of the potential adverse effect on subsequent cognitive function of the neonate; b
see Table 3.3.
If the mother has been treated with methimazole, the post-delivery
levels of T4 may be low and neonatal levels of T4 may only rise to the

Thyrotoxicosis

thyrotoxic range after a few days. In addition, TSH is usually absent in
neonates who subsequently develop thyrotoxicosis.
Clinical indicators of neonatal thyrotoxicosis include low birth weight,
poor weight gain, tachycardia, and irritability. Methimazole can be given
and withdrawn after a few weeks after the level of TSH-RAb declines.

Postpartum thyroiditis
This is deﬁned as a syndrome of postpartum thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism in women who were euthyroid during pregnancy.
Postpartum thyroid dysfunction, which occurs in women with autoimmune thyroid disease, is characterized in 1/3 by a thyrotoxic phase in the
ﬁrst 3 months postpartum, followed by a hypothyroid phase occurring 3–6
months after delivery, followed by spontaneous recovery. In the remaining
2/3, a single-phase pattern or the reverse occurs.
Approximately 5 to 7% of women develop biochemical evidence of thyroid dysfunction after delivery. An i incidence is seen in patients with type
I diabetes mellitus (25%) and other autoimmune diseases, in the presence
of anti-TPO antibodies, and in the presence of a family history of thyroid
disease.
Hyperthyroidism due to Graves’ disease accounts for 10–15% of all
cases of postpartum thyrotoxicosis. In most cases, hyperthyroidism occurs
later in the postpartum period (>3–6 months) and persists.
Providing the patient is not breast-feeding, a radioiodine uptake and
scan can differentiate the two principal causes of autoimmune thyrotoxicosis by demonstrating i uptake in Graves’ disease and low uptake in
postpartum thyroiditis.
Graves’ hyperthyroidism should be treated with ATDs. Propylthiouracil
is preferable if the patient is breast-feeding. Thyrotoxic symptoms due
to postpartum thyrotoxicosis are managed symptomatically using
propranolol.
One-third of affected women with postpartum thyroiditis develop
symptoms of hypothyroidism and may require LT4 for 2–3 months followed by a trial of 4–6 weeks off of LT4 and measurement of plasma TSH.
There is a suggestion of an i risk of postpartum depression in those with
hypothyroidism.
Histology of the thyroid in the case of postpartum thyroiditis shows
lymphocytic inﬁltration with destructive thyroiditis, predominantly occurring at 16 weeks in women with positive antimicrosomal antibodies.
Subsequent permanent hypothyroidism occurs in 25–30% of patients
with postpartum thyroiditis. Given the increased risk, these patients
should be followed up with annual TSH measurements.

HYPERTHYROIDISM IN CHILDREN

Hyperthyroidism in children
Epidemiology
Thyrotoxicosis is rare before the age of 5 years. Although there is a progressive increase in incidence throughout childhood, it is still rare and
accounts for <5% of all cases of Graves’ disease.

Clinical features
Behavioral abnormalities, hyperactivity, and declining school performance
may bring the child to medical attention. Features of hyperthyroidism are
as described under Manifestations of hyperthyroidism (p. 19).
Accelerated growth rate is common in patients and presents as increasing height percentiles on growth charts. The disease may be part of
McCune–Albright syndrome, myasthenia gravis, Down syndrome, diabetes mellitus, or other associated diseases.
Clinical exam should include examination for café-au-lait pigmentation,
precocious puberty, and bony abnormalities.

Investigations
The primary cause of thyrotoxicosis in children is Graves’ disease (positive
antibodies to thyroid-stimulating antibodies, thyroglobulin, and/or thyroid
peroxidase). Thyroiditis and toxic nodules have been described and a
radioiodine scan may be useful if the diagnosis is not clear.
Hereditary syndromes of thyroid hormone resistance, often misdiagnosed as Graves’ disease, are now increasingly recognized in children.

Treatment
ATDs represent the treatment of choice for thyrotoxic children. Therapy
is generally started with propylthiouracil 6–8 mg/kg in three divided doses
or methimazole (0.6–0.8 mg/kg per day).
Since relapse after withdrawal of ATDs is common, these drugs may be
continued long term, until education is complete and deﬁnitive treatment
with surgery or radioiodine can be offered (if ATDs result in serious side
effects or if there is a recurrence after thyroidectomy).

35

36

CHAPTER 3

Thyrotoxicosis

Secondary hyperthyroidism
An elevated serum free T4 and non-suppressed serum TSH are characteristic of TSH-secreting adenomas or resistance to thyroid hormone These
conditions must be differentiated (Table 3.4).

TSH-secreting pituitary tumors
These tumors account for <1% of all pituitary tumors. Characteristically,
there are elevated serum free T4 and T3 concentrations and non-suppressed
(inappropriately normal or frankly elevated) serum TSH levels.
Among the 280 TSHomas reported in the literature (until 1998), 72%
secreted TSH alone; the remainder co-secreted growth hormone (GH)
(16%), prolactin (11%), or, rarely, gonadotropins. Approximately 90%
were macroadenomas (>1 cm in diameter) and 71% exhibited suprasellar
extension, invasion, or both into adjacent tissues (b see p. 131).
Patients with pure TSHomas may present with typical symptoms and
signs of thyrotoxicosis and the presence of a diffuse goiter.
Patients may exhibit features of oversecretion of the other pituitary hormones, e.g., most commonly, prolactin or growth hormone. Headaches,
visual ﬁeld defects, menstrual irregularities, amenorrhea, delayed puberty,
and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism have also been reported.
Careful establishment of the diagnosis is key to treatment. Inappropriate
treatment of such patients with subtotal thyroidectomy or radioiodine
administration not only fails to cure the underlying disorder but may also
be associated with subsequent pituitary tumor enlargement and an i risk
of invasiveness into adjacent tissues.

SECONDARY HYPERTHYROIDISM

Treatment options are as follows:
• Transphenoidal surgery
• Pituitary radiotherapy if surgical results are unsatisfactory or surgery is
contraindicated or not desired
• Medical therapy with somatostatin analogs such as octreotide or
lanreotide may be useful preoperatively and suppresses TSH secretion
in 80% of the cases.

Resistance to thyroid hormones
Patients with generalized resistance to thyroid hormone (GRTH) may
present with mild hyperthyroidism, deaf mutism, delayed bone maturation, raised circulating thyroid hormone concentrations, non-suppressed
TSH, and failure of TSH to decrease normally upon administration of supraphysiological doses of thyroid hormones.
Most patients present with goiter or incidentally found abnormal TFTs.
Treatment is determined by thyroid status.
In selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones (PRTH), the thyroid hormone resistance is more pronounced in the pituitary. Thus the
patient exhibits deﬁnite clinical manifestations of thyrotoxicosis.
About 90% of thyroid hormone resistance syndromes result from mutations in the gene encoding TRB. Mutant receptors have a reduced afﬁnity
for T3 and are functionally deﬁcient. It is usually inherited in an autosomal
dominant pattern with the affected individuals being heterozygous for the
mutation.
A subset of RTH receptors has been identiﬁed that are capable of inhibiting wild-type receptor action. When coexpressed, the mutant proteins
are able to inhibit the function of their wild-type counterparts in a dominant negative manner.
Common features of patients with thyroid hormone resistance syndromes include goiter (most commonly) and, less frequently, tachycardia,
hyperkinetic behavior, emotional disturbances, ear, nose, and throat infections, language disabilities, auditory disorders, low body weight, cardiac
abnormalities, and subnormal intelligence quotients.
Treatment options in RTH are not usually necessary.
In PTRH, treatment may be needed, but this is uncommon. Treatment
is with chronic suppression of TSH secretion with LT4, triiodothyroacetic
acid, octreotide, or bromocriptine. If this is ineffective, thyroid ablation
with radioiodine or surgery can be tried, with subsequent close monitoring of thyroid hormone status and pituitary gland size.

GRAVES’ OPHTHALMOPATHY

Graves’ ophthalmopathy,
dermopathy, and acropachy

Graves’ ophthalmopathy
 See European Working Group on Graves’ Ophthalmopathy at www.
EUGOGO.org.
This organ-speciﬁc autoimmune disorder is characterized by swelling
of the extraocular muscles, lymphocytic inﬁltration, late ﬁbrosis, muscle
tethering, and proliferation of orbital fat and connective tissue. The lesions
are due to localized accumulation of glycosaminoglycans.
The disorder is clinically evident in 30% of patients. Most have mild
disease, but 5% have severe disease that threatens sight.
Incidence is higher in women (except for severe disease, for which there
is equal sex-incidence). There is a bimodal age distribution in women, with
peak onsets between 40–44 years and 60–64 years. In men, a single peak
incidence occurs at 65–69 years.
There are two stages in the development of the disease: an active
inﬂammatory (dynamic) stage and a relatively quiescent static stage. 5%
of patients with Graves’ ophthalmopathy have hypothyroidism and 5% are
euthyroid. 75% of patients develop Graves’ disease within a year of developing Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
The temporal relationship between the onset of thyroid dysfunction
and ophthalmopathy is variable. In a minority of patients, there is a lag
period between the presentation of hyperthyroidism and the appearance
of eye ﬁndings.
Smoking and hypothyroidism moderately worsen Graves’ ophthalmopathy, and current smokers (>20 cigarettes/day) are more likely to develop
ophthalmopathy.
The endocrinologist should be prepared to identify ocular emergencies, such as corneal ulceration, congestive ophthalmopathy, and optic
neuropathy.

Clinical features
Retraction of eyelids is extremely common in thyroid eye disease. The
margin of the upper eyelid normally rests about 2 mm below the limbus.
Retraction can be suspected if the upper eyelid margin is either level with or
above the superior limbus, thus allowing the sclera to be visible below the lid.
Additionally, the lower lid normally rests at the inferior limbus, and retraction
can be suspected when the sclera is visible above the lower eyelid.
Proptosis or exopthalmos can result in failure of lid closure, thereby
increasing the likelihood of exposure keratitis and a gritty eye sensation.

39

40

CHAPTER 4

Graves’ ophthalmopathy

Damage to the eye can be conﬁrmed with a ﬂuorescein or rose Bengal
stain.
Fundoscopy should be performed to rule out papilledema. Proptosis
may result in periorbital edema and chemosis because the displaced orbit
results in less efﬁcient orbital drainage.
Persistent visual blurring may indicate an optic neuropathy requiring
urgent treatment. Severe conjunctival pain may indicate corneal ulceration
requiring urgent referral.
Features are unilateral in approximately 15% of cases.

Investigation of proptosis
The NOSPECS classiﬁcation is not universally accepted; for detailed classiﬁcation see  www.EUGOGO.org and The European Group on Graves’
Orbitopathy.1
Documentation using a Hertel exophthalmometer
The feet of the apparatus are placed against the lateral orbital margin as
deﬁned by the zygomatic bones. The distance between the lateral angle of
the bony orbit and an imaginary line tangent to the most anterior aspect
of the cornea is recorded.
A normal result is considered <20 mm (<18 mm in Asians, <22 in AfroCarribeans). A reading of 21 mm or more is abnormal, and a difference of
2 mm between the eyes is suspicious.
Soft tissue involvement
Soft-tissue signs and symptoms include conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis,
and foreign-body sensation.
CT or MRI scan of the orbit
This demonstrates enlargement of the extraocular muscles, which can be
useful in cases of diagnostic difﬁculty. This is also more accurate for demonstration of proptosis.

Examining for possible ophthalmoplegia
Patients may complain of diplopia due to ocular muscle dysfunction caused
by either edema during the early active phase or ﬁbrosis during the later
phase. Assessment using a Hess chart may be helpful.
Intraoptic pressure may increase on upgaze and result in compression
of the globe by a ﬁbrotic inferior rectus muscle. Ocular mobility may be
restricted by edema during the active inﬂammatory phase or by ﬁbrosis
during the ﬁbrotic stage.
The two most common ﬁndings are defective eye elevation caused
by ﬁbrotic contraction of the inferior rectus muscle, and a convergence
defect caused by ﬁbrotic contraction of the medial rectus. Disorders of
the medial rectus, superior rectus, and lateral rectus muscle produce typical signs of defective adduction, depression, and abduction, respectively.

GRAVES’ OPHTHALMOPATHY

Examining for possible optic neuropathy
History of poor vision, a recent or rapid change in vision, and poor color
vision are reasons for prompt referral. A visual acuity of <6/18 warrants
referral to an ophthalmologist.
For color vision, each eye should be evaluated using a simple 15-plate
Ishihara color vision test. Color vision is a subtle indicator of optic nerve
function. Failure to identify >2 of the plates with either eye is an indication
for referral. This is unhelpful in the 8% of men who may be color blind.

of an afferent pupillary defect.

Medical treatment
See Box 4.1.
Lid retraction
Most patients do not require any treatment, as clinical signs usually improve
with treatment of hyperthyroidism or spontaneously with time (40%).
• Sunglasses help with photophobia and excess tears.
• In patients with signiﬁcant lid retraction and exposure keratopathy,
topical lubricants improve symptoms (surgery to reduce the vertical lid
ﬁssures can be considered).
• Botulinum toxin injection may reduce upper lid retraction.
• Head elevation during sleep and diuretics may help congestion.
• Tape eyelids at night to avoid corneal damage
Active ophthalmopathy threatening sight
• Glucocorticoids at high doses (e.g., prednisone 60–80 mg/day) improve
ophthalmopathy in 60–75% of cases.
• Effectiveness of glucocorticoids is more likely in those with diplopia at
neutral gaze and an inﬂammatory component to ophthalmoplegia.
• Treatment should be given for 2 weeks and then tapered gradually.
• Urgent referral to an ophthalmologist is indicated for any suspicion of
optic neuropathy or corneal ulceration.
Orbital radiotherapy
• Indications for lens-sparing orbital radiotherapy are similar to those for
high-dose glucocorticoids.
• Radiotherapy probably works by reducing the activity and number of
activated T lymphocytes in the retrobulbar tissues.
• 20 Gray administered in 10 doses of 2 Gray over 2 weeks
• Treatment with both radiotherapy and glucocorticoids is more
effective than either alone.
• Effectiveness in 60% of patients <40 years of age
Other medical therapies
• Other immunosuppressive regimens have no proven place in the
general management of Graves’ ophthalmopathy.
• Use of depot octreotide has been shown to be of no beneﬁt in
management.

Surgical treatment
See Box 4.1.
Surgery for decompression
• Orbital decompression may be indicated for urgent treatment of optic
neuropathy.
• Posteromedial wall of orbit is usually removed.
• Complications include dysmotility of the eye, blindness, orbital
cellulitis, cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) leak, cerebral hematoma,
obstruction to nasolacrimal ﬂow, and anosmia.
Surgery for strabismus
• Should be performed after any necessary orbital decompression
• Aims are to allow correct binocular vision
• Performed when eyes are in a quiescent phase for at least 6 months
after active disease
• Involves alteration, loosening or tightening of eye muscles, often over
several operations, to improve binocular vision.
Eyelid surgery
This is the ﬁnal stage of any surgical approach. The aims are to adjust the
upper and lower eyelid position to improve comfort and appearance.

THYROID ACROPACHY

Graves’ dermopathy
This is a rare complication of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis (0.5%). It is usually
pretibial in location (99%) and hence called pretibial myxedema. It is associated with ophthalmopathy (97%) and acropachy (18%).
Typically, raised, discolored, and indurated lesions are on the front or
back of the legs or on the dorsum of the feet. Occasionally, these have
been described in other areas, including the hands and face.
Lesions are due to localized accumulation of glycosaminoglycans. It is
now recognized that there is a lymphocytic inﬁltrate. Lesions are characteristically asymptomatic, but they can also be pruritic, tender, and
disﬁguring.

Treatment
This condition is usually not treated. Potent topical ﬂuorinated steroids
such as ﬂuocinolone acetonide may be effective (4–8 weeks) for treatment
of localized pain and tenderness and occasionally may result in resolution
of the visible skin signs. Surgery may worsen the condition.
One-quarter of cases remit completely; 50% are chronic on no therapy.
The effect of topical steroids on remission rates is unclear.

Thyroid acropachy
This is the rarest manifestation of Graves’ disease. It presents as painless
clubbing of the digits and subperiosteal new bone formation. The softtissue swelling is similar to that seen in localized myxedema and consists
of glycosaminoglycan accumulation.
Patients almost inevitably have Graves’ ophthalmopathy or pretibial
myxedema. If not, an alternative cause of clubbing should be looked for.
There is no effective treatment.

CHAPTER 5

Multinodular goiter

Multinodular goiter and
solitary adenomas

Background
Nodular thyroid disease denotes the presence of single or multiple palpable or nonpalpable nodules within the thyroid gland.
Prevalence rates range from 5 to 50% depending on the population
studied and sensitivity of detection methods. Prevalence increases linearly
with age and exposure to ionizing radiation and iodine deﬁciency.
Clinically apparent thyroid nodules are evident in 4–7% of the U.S.
population. Incidence of thyroid nodules is about 4 × more common in
women.
Thyroid nodules always raise the concern of cancer, although <5% are
cancerous.
Nodules are more likely to be malignant in patients <20 or >60 years of
age. Thyroid nodules are more common in women but approximately 4×
more likely to be malignant in men.

CLINICAL EVALUATION

Clinical evaluation
An asymptomatic thyroid mass may be discovered either by a clinician on
routine neck palpation or by the patient during self-examination.
History should concentrate on the following:
• An enlarging thyroid mass
• A previous history of radiation, especially childhood head and neck
irradiation
• A family history of thyroid cancer
• Development of hoarseness or dysphagia
Physical ﬁndings suggestive of malignancy include a ﬁrm or hard nontender nodule, a recent history of enlargement, ﬁxation to adjacent tissue,
and the presence of regional lymphadenopathy.
Pemberton’s sign is facial erythema and jugular venous distension upon
raising the arms. It is a sign of superior venacaval obstruction caused by a
substernal mass.
A hot nodule on a radioisotope scan makes malignancy less likely.
See Table 5.1 for the etiology of thyroid nodules.

• Lymphadenopathy
• History of Hashimoto’s disease (Increased incidence of lymphoma)

Studies
• FNA (see p. 14)
• Serum TSH concentration. If TSH is suppressed, a radioisotope thyroid
scan should be performed.
• Serum calcitonin if there is a family history of medullary carcinoma or
MEN 2A or 2B
• Respiratory ﬂow loop, especially for a large goiter possibly causing
tracheal obstruction
• CT scan or MRI if there are concerns about retrosternal goiter or
tracheal compression

TREATMENT

Treatment
Toxic multinodular goiter or nodule
ATDs
ATDs are effective in controlling the hyperthyroidism but are not curative. As the hot nodules are autonomous, the condition will recur after
stopping the drugs.
Methimazole and propylthiouracil are useful treatments to gain control
of the disease in preparation for surgery or radioiodine treatment or as
long-term treatment in those patients unwilling to accept radioiodine or
surgery.
Radioiodine
This form of treatment is often considered the ﬁrst choice for deﬁnitive treatment. 131I is preferentially accumulated in hot nodules but
not in normal thyroid tissue, which, because of the thyrotoxic state, is
nonfunctioning.
Radioiodine treatment commonly induces a euthyroid state as the hot
nodules are destroyed and the previously nonfunctioning follicles gradually
resume normal function. A dose of 14–16 mCi for small to medium goiters
and 16–22 mCi for medium to large goiters is recommended.
Surgery
The aim of surgery is to remove as much of the nodular tissue as possible and, if the goiter is large, to relieve local symptoms. Postoperative
follow-up should involve checks of thyroid function.
Goiter recurrence, although rare, does occasionally occur.

Nontoxic multinodular goiter or nodule
Surgery
This is the preferred treatment for patients with the following:
• Local compression symptoms
• Cosmetic disﬁgurement
• Solitary nodule with FNA suspicious for malignancy
Radioiodine
This may be indicated in elderly patients for whom surgery is not appropriate. It may require admission. Up to 50% shrinkage of goiter mass has
been reported in recent studies.
Hypothyroidism following radioiodine is relatively low but is still
recognized.

Medical treatment
Use of T4 to suppress TSH is associated with a risk of cardiac arrhythmias and
bone loss. T4 is useful only if TSH is detectable but is not generally indicated.

BACKGROUND

Thyroiditis

Background
The term thyroiditis refers to a varied group of disorders all characterized
by some form of thyroid inﬂammation (Table 6.1). It includes conditions
characterized by thyroid pain and tenderness (i.e., subacute granulomatous, infectious, traumatic, and radiation-induced thyroiditis) and those
characterized primarily by thyroid dysfunction or goiter without pain (i.e.,
painless, postpartum, drug-induced and ﬁbrous thyroiditis, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis [Hashimoto’s]).
Inﬂammation of the thyroid gland often leads to a transient thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism (Table 6.2).

See Tables 6.1 and 6.2.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis
This is characterized by a painless, variably sized goiter with rubbery consistency and an irregular surface. The normal follicular structure of the
gland is extensively replaced by lymphocytic and plasma cell inﬁltrates
with formation of lymphoid germinal centers.
The patient may have normal thyroid function, or subclinical, or overt
hypothyroidism. Occasional patients present with thyrotoxicosis in association with a thyroid gland that is unusually ﬁrm and with high titers of
circulating antithyroid antibodies.

Atrophic thyroiditis
This probably indicates end-stage thyroid disease. These patients do not
have goiter and are antibody positive. Biochemically, the picture is that of
frank hypothyroidism.

Studies
• Thyroid function tests
• Thyroid antibodies (antithyroglobulin antibodies positive in 20–25%,
and antithyroperoxidase antibodies in >90%).
• FNA to exclude malignancy in patients who present with a goiter and
dominant nodule

Prognosis
The long-term prognosis of patients with chronic thyroiditis is good,
because hypothyroidism can easily be corrected with T4 and the goiter is
not usually of sufﬁcient size to cause local symptoms.
In the atypical situation where Hashimoto’s thyroiditis presents with
rapidly enlarging goiter and pain, a short course of prednisone at a dose of
40 mg daily may prove helpful.

OTHER TYPES OF THYROIDITIS

Other types of thyroiditis
Silent thyroiditis
This is associated with transient thyrotoxicosis or hypothyroidism. A signiﬁcant percentage of patients have a personal or family history of autoimmune thyroid disease. It may progress to permanent hypothyroidism.

Postpartum thyroiditis
Also see p. 34. Thyroid dysfunction occurs within the ﬁrst 6 months postpartum. Prevalence ranges from 5 to 7%. Postpartum thyroiditis develops in 30–52% of women who have positive thyroid peroxidase (TPO)
antibodies.
Most patients have a complete remission but some may progress to
permanent hypothyroidism. It is three times as common in patients with
type I diabetes mellitus.

Chronic ﬁbrosing (Riedel’s) thyroiditis
This rare disorder is characterized by intense ﬁbrosis of the thyroid gland
and surrounding structures, leading to induration of the tissues of the
neck. It may be associated with mediastinal and retroperitoneal ﬁbrosis,
salivary gland ﬁbrosis, sclerosing cholangitis, lachrymal gland ﬁbrosis, and
parathyroid gland ﬁbrosis leading to hypoparathyroidism.
Patients are usually euthyroid. The main differential diagnosis is thyroid
neoplasia.
Management
Corticosteroids are usually ineffective. Surgery may be needed to relieve
obstruction and to exclude malignancy. Tamoxifen may be of beneﬁt.

Pyogenic thyroiditis
This disorder is rare; it is usually preceded by a pyogenic infection elsewhere. It is characterized by tenderness and swelling of the thyroid gland,
redness and warmth of the overlying skin, and constitutional signs of
infection.
Piriform sinus should be excluded. Excision of the tract is preferable to
incision and drainage.
Treatment consists of antibiotic therapy and incision and drainage if a
ﬂuctuant area within the thyroid should occur.

Subacute thyroiditis (granulomatous or de Quervain
thyroiditis)
This condition is most likely viral in origin. Symptoms include pronounced
asthenia, malaise, pain over the thyroid, or pain referred to the lower jaw,
ear, or occiput. Less commonly, the onset is acute with fever, pain over
the thyroid, and symptoms of thyrotoxicosis.
Characteristic signs include exquisite tenderness and nodularity of the thyroid gland. There is often an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and depressed radionuclide uptake. Biochemically, the patient may be initially
thyrotoxic, though later the patient may become hypothyroid (15%).

51

52

CHAPTER 6

Thyroiditis

In mild cases, nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents offer symptomatic
relief. In severe cases, glucocorticoids (prednisone 20–40 mg/day) are
effective. Propranolol can be used to control associated thyrotoxicosis.
Treatment can be withdrawn when T4 returns to normal.
T4 replacement is required if the patient becomes hypothyroid.
Treatment with methimazole or propylthiouracil is not indicated.

Drug-induced thyroiditis
Causes
• Amiodarone
• Lithium
• Interferon-A (15% develop thyroid peroxidase antibodies and or
thyroid dysfunction)
• Interleukin 2

BACKGROUND

Hypothyroidism

Background
Hypothyroidism results from a variety of abnormalities that cause insufﬁcient secretion of thyroid hormones (Table 7.1). The most common cause
is autoimmune thyroid disease.
Myxedema is severe hypothyroidism in which there is accumulation of
hydrophilic mucopolysaccharides in the ground substance of the dermis
and other tissues leading to thickening of the facial features and doughy
induration of the skin.
Subclinical hypothyroidism refers to elevated TSH levels in the presence
of normal concentrations of free thyroid hormones.

Epidemiology
In community surveys, approximately 0.1–2% of adults have overt
hypothyroidism.
In the United States Nation Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), 4.3% of people without known thyroid disease had subclinical hypothyroidism, and 0.3% had overt hypothyroidism.
Incidence is higher in whites than in Hispanics or African-American
populations. Incidence is higher in areas of high iodine intake.
An elevated TSH is associated with higher serum lipid concentrations,
which may be an additional reason to initiate therapy.

CHAPTER 7

Hypothyroidism

Treatment of hypothyroidism
Normal metabolic state should be restored gradually as a rapid increase in
metabolic rate may precipitate cardiac arrhythmias. The average replacement dose is 1.6 mcg/kg per day.
In younger patients, start levothyroxine at 50–100 mcg. In the elderly,
with a history of ischemic heart disease, an initial dose of levothyroxine
25–50 mcg can be increased by 25-mcg increments at 4-week intervals
until normal metabolic state is attained.
The optimum dosage is determined by clinical criteria, the objective of
treatment being to restore serum TSH to the normal range.
TSH should be checked only 2 months after any dose change. Once
stabilized, TSH should be checked on an annual basis.
In patients with secondary hypothyroidism, free T4 is the most useful
parameter to follow.
Dose requirements can increase by 25–50% in pregnancy because of
the increase in thyroid-binding globulin (TBG). Recent data have shown
that mild maternal hypothyroidism in the ﬁrst trimester is associated with
slightly impaired cognitive function in offspring. Thus, some now recommend a routinely increased levothyroxine dose by 25 mcg in any women
on replacement therapy when she learns she is pregnant.

Combined T4 and T3 replacement
Some studies have suggested that the additional replacement with T3 and
T4 in combination improves well-being and cognitive function in patients
compared to treatment with T4 alone.
A recent meta-analysis of double-blind crossover studies showed no
beneﬁt of this therapy; thus it is not recommended.

TREATMENT OF SUBCLINICAL HYPOTHYROIDISM

Treatment of subclinical
hypothyroidism
Treatment is indicated if the biochemistry is sustained in patients with a
past history of radioiodine treatment for thyrotoxicosis or positive thyroid antibodies. In these situations, progression to overt hypothyroidism
is almost inevitable (at least 5% per year of those with positive antithyroid
peroxidase antibodies).
Two samples should be taken 2–3 months apart to distinguish from
nonthyroidal illness.
There is controversy over the advantages of T4 treatment in patients
with negative thyroid antibodies and no previous radioiodine treatment.
If treatment is not given, follow-up with annual thyroid function tests is
important.
There is no generally accepted consensus of when patients should
receive treatment. Some authorities suggest treatment when the serum
TSH is >10 U/L, because of an increased rate of progression to overt
hypothyroidism.
Increased incidence of cardiac risk is probably greater if >65 years old.

Identify and treat concurrent precipitating illness.
Give antibiotic therapy after blood cultures.
Manage hypothermia with passive external rewarming.
Manage patient in an intensive treatment unit if they are comatose.
Give warm humidiﬁed oxygen by facemask. Mechanical ventilation is
needed if the patient is hypoventilating.
Aim for a slow rise in core temperature (0.5°C/h).
Use a cardiac monitor for supraventricular arrhythmias.
Correct hyponatremia (mild ﬂuid restriction), hypotension (cautious
volume expansion with crystalloid or whole blood), and hypoglycemia
(glucose administration).
Monitor rectal temperature, oxygen saturation, blood pressure (BP),
central venous pressure (CVP), and urine output hourly.
Take blood samples for thyroid hormones, TSH, and cortisol before
starting treatment. If hypocortisolemic, administer glucocorticoids.

On thyroid hormone replacement no consensus has been reached. The
following is an accepted regimen:
• T4 300–500 mcg IV or by NG tube as a starting dose followed by
50–100 mcg daily until oral medication can be taken
• If no improvement within 24–48 hours, T3 10 mcg IV q8h or 25 mcg IV
q8h can be given in addition to above.
Give hydrocortisone 50–100 mg q6–8h in case of cortisol deﬁciency.

CHAPTER 7

Hypothyroidism

Congenital hypothyroidism
Incidence is about 1 in 5000 neonates. All neonates should be screened.

Thyroid agenesis
This occurs in 1 in 1800 births.

Thyroid hormone dysgenesis
This is caused by inborn errors of thyroid metabolism. The disorders may
be autosomal recessive, indicating single protein defects.
The disorder can be caused by inactivation of the TSH receptor, abnormalities of the thyroid transcription factors TTF1, TTF2, and PAX8, or
defects in iodide transport, organiﬁcation (peroxidase), coupling, deiodinase, or thyroglobulin synthesis.
In a large proportion of patients with congenital hypothyroidism, the
molecular background is unknown.

Pendred’s syndrome
This is characterized by overt or subclinical hypothyroidism, goiter, and
moderate to severe sensorineural hearing impairment. The prevalence
varies between 1 in 15,000 and 1 in 100,000. There is a partial iodide
organiﬁcation defect detected by increased perchlorate discharge.
Thyroid hormone synthesis is only mildly impaired and so may not be
detected by neonatal thyroid screening.

Box 7.2 Clinical features and congenital hypothyroidism
The following features are late sequelae of congenital hypothyroidism.
With routine screening now available, they should not be seen.
• Physiological jaundice
• Goiter
• Hoarse cry, feeding problems, constipation, somnolence
• Delay in reaching normal milestones of development; short stature
• Coarse features with protruding tongue, broad ﬂat nose, wide-set
eyes
• Sparse hair and dry skin, protuberant abdomen with umbilical hernia
• Impaired mental development, retarded bone age
• Epiphyseal dysgenesis, delayed dentition

Laboratory tests
• Neonatal screening by measurement of serum TSH
• Imaging procedure: ultrasonography or 123I scintigraphy
• Measurement of serum thyroglobulin and low molecular weight
iodopeptides in urine to discriminate between various types of defects
• Measurement of neonatal and maternal autoantibodies as an indication
of possible transient hypothyroidism

CONGENITAL HYPOTHYROIDISM

Treatment
Irrespective of the cause of congenital hypothyroidism, early treatment
is essential to prevent cerebral damage. Sufﬁcient T4 should be given to
maintain TSH in the normal range.

CHAPTER 8

Amiodarone and thyroid function

Amiodarone and thyroid
function

Background
Amiodarone is a potent antiarrythymic drug used to treat various tachyarrhythmias. It is a benzofuranic derivative with a high concentration of
iodine, and it bears structural resemblance to thyroxine. Each 200 mg tablet contains approximately 75 mg of organic iodine.
Amiodarone is distributed in several tissues from where it is slowly
released. In one study, terminal elimination half-life of amiodarone averaged 52.6 days with a standard deviation of 23.7 days.
Abnormalities of thyroid function occur in up to 14–18% of patients1
(Table 8.1). In the UK and United States, 2% of patients on amiodarone
develop thyrotoxicosis and about 13% develop hypothyroidism.
Patients residing in areas with high iodine intake develop amiodaroneinduced hypothyroidism (AIH) more often than amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT), but AIT occurs more frequently in regions with low
iodine intake. AIT can present several months after discontinuing the drug
because of its long half-life.
Hypothyroidism is more common in women and in patients with thyroid autoantibodies.
Thyroid function tests should be monitored initially and then every
6 months in patients taking amiodarone.

PATHOGENESIS

Pathogenesis
The high iodine content of amiodarone may either inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis and release, thus causing AIH (failure to escape the
Wolff-Chaikoff effect), or may result in iodine-induced thyrotoxicosis
(Jod–Basedow phenomenon).
Thyrotoxicosis resulting from iodine excess and therefore increased
hormone synthesis is referred to as AIT type I. Thyrotoxicosis due to a
direct toxic effect of amiodarone is referred to as AIT type II (Table 8.2).
Drug-induced destructive thyroiditis results in leakage of thyroid hormones from damaged follicles into the circulation and, like subacute
thyroiditis, can be followed by a transient hypothyroid state before euthyroidism is restored.

CHAPTER 8

Amiodarone and thyroid function

Diagnosis and treatment
See Table 8.3. After chronic administration of amiodarone, a steady state
is achieved, typically reﬂected in mild elevation of free T4 and reduction
in free T3. Thus in clinically euthyroid patients on amiodarone, a slightly
elevated T4 is not indicative of hyperthyroidism, nor is a low T3 indicative
of hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroidism is indicated by signiﬁcantly i free T4, together with
elevated free T3 and suppressed serum TSH.
Hypothyroidism is indicated by elevation of TSH with low serum free
T4. See Box 8.1 for treatment.
Discontinuation of amiodarone does not always control the thyrotoxic
state because of its long half-life (particularly in the obese) due to its very
high volume of distribution and fat solubility.
Numerous complex published algorithms exist for management, but
since classiﬁcation into type I and type II is often difﬁcult (see Table 8.2),
in practice most patients are treated with ATDs ± glucocorticoids (see
Table 8.4).

Step 1
Aim: restore
euthyroidism

Methimazole up to
40 mg/day or
propylthiouracil
400 mg/day.
If possible, discontinue
amiodarone*

Discontinue amidarone if
possible*
Prednisone 40 mg/day
In mixed forms, add
methimazole or propylthiouracil as in type 1 AIT

Step 2:
Deﬁnitive
treatment

Radioiodine treatment
or thyroidectomy

Follow up for possible
spontaneous progression
to hypothyroidism

*If amiodarone cannot be withdrawn and medical therapy is unsuccessful, consider total
thyroidectomy.

The ﬁrst line of treatment is ATDs (methimazole or propylthiouracil).
A combination of corticosteroids and ATDs may be effective in AIT type
II. A high dose of prednisone, 40–60 mg daily, may be required for 8–12
weeks; studies where steroids have been discontinued after 2–3 weeks
have been associated with a high relapse rate.
Potassium perchlorate may be of additional beneﬁt, but it is currently
not available in the United States
Radioiodine is not usually effective because of reduced uptake by the
thyroid gland, reﬂecting the iodine load associated with the drug.
Surgery remains a very successful form of treatment, with euthyroidism
being restored within a matter of days. Achieving preoperative euthyroidism may be difﬁcult, however.
Cardiac function may be compromised by propranolol used in combination with amiodarone, since this may produce bradycardia and sinus
arrest.

Thyroid cancer

Thyroid cancer

Epidemiology
Clinically detectable thyroid cancer is rare. It accounts for <1% of all cancer and <0.5% of cancer deaths. Thyroid microcarcinoma (diameter <1 cm)
may be found in multinodular goiters.
Thyroid cancers are most common in adults aged 40–50 and are rare in
children and adolescents. Women are affected more frequently than men.
See Table 9.1 for classiﬁcation of thyroid cancer and Table 9.2 for a
comparison of the various types of carcinoma.

ETIOLOGY

Etiology
Irradiation
There does not appear to be a threshold dose of external irradiation for
thyroid carcinogenesis; doses of 200–500 rad seem to produce thyroid
cancer at a rate of about 0.5%/year.
There is no evidence that therapeutic or diagnostic 131I administration can
induce thyroid cancer, although there is a small increase in death rates from
thyroid cancer after 131I. At present it is unclear whether this is due to an
effect of 131I or part of the natural history of the underlying thyroid disease.
External irradiation at an age <20 years is associated with an increased
risk of thyroid nodule development and thyroid cancer (most commonly
papillary). The radioactive fallout from the Chernobyl nuclear explosion
in 1986 resulted in a 4.7-fold increase in thyroid cancer in the regions of
Belarus from 1985 to 1993, including a 34-fold increase in children. Most
of these were papillary carcinomas.
The risk is greater for women and when irradiation occurs at a
younger age.
There is a latency of at least 5 years with maximum risk at 20 years
following exposure, though this was not seen following the Chernobyl
disaster.

Other environmental factors
Most investigators agree that iodine supplementation has resulted in a
decrease in the incidence of follicular carcinoma.

Genetic syndromes and oncogenes
RET/PTC1 proto-oncogene abnormalities in the long arm of chromosome
10 are associated with some papillary tumors (5–30%), especially after irradiation (60–80%). It is similar to the abnormality associated with medullary
thyroid carcinoma in MEN2A.
Two new proto-oncogenes have been have been identiﬁed: RET/PTC2
and RET/PTC3 TRK (less common).
The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been found to be mutated in some
de-differentiated cancers.
Overexpression of the ras and PTTG oncogenes is found in papillary
thyroid cancers. These were found to be markers for adverse prognosis.
c-myc mRNA expression has been correlated with histological markers
of papillary cancer aggression.

Papillary microcarcinoma of the thyroid (PMC)
PMC is deﬁned by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a tumor
focus of 1.0 cm or less in diameter. It is detected coincidentally on histopathological examination of resected thyroid
Autopsy studies show the following:
• Prevalence ranges from 1 to 35.6%.
• No signiﬁcant difference in the prevalence rates of PMC has been
demonstrated between the sexes.
• PMC rarely progresses to clinically apparent thyroid cancer with
advancing age.

67

68

CHAPTER 9

Thyroid cancer

• PMC can be multifocal.
• Cervical lymph node metastasis from PMC ranges from 4.3 to 18.2%.
• Lymph node metastasis was most often associated with multifocal tumors.
Although exposure to irradiation increases the likelihood of developing
papillary thyroid cancer, the tumors will usually be >1.0 cm in diameter
and thus not PMC.
Follow-up studies suggest that PMC is a slow-growing lesion that rarely
spreads to distant sites and carries a good prognosis. The recommendations for treatment of PMC vary widely:
• The low morbidity and long survival mean that collection of
randomized, prospective data has never been performed and
comparisons of therapies are based on retrospective studies.
• The treatment of PMC should not cause more morbidity than the
disease process itself.
• Surgical treatment recommendations range from simple excision to
ipsilateral lobectomy.
• With adjuvant therapy, the consensus is routine use of T4 but not the
use of radioiodine, as there is no difference in the recurrence rate.
There is some evidence to keep TSH below the reference range, but
robust supporting data are not available.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma
Papillary carcinoma constitutes approximately 80% of all thyroid cancers.
It is more common in women (3:1).
It is rare in childhood Peaks occur in the second and third decades and
again in later life (bimodal frequency).
Incidence is 3–5 per 100,000 population.

Pathology
The carcinoma is slow growing and usually non-encapsulated and may
spread through the thyroid capsule to structures in the surrounding neck,
especially regional lymph nodes.
Recognized variants are follicular, papillary, dorsal, columnar cell, tall
cell, and diffuse sclerosing.
It is conﬁned to the neck in over 95% of cases, although 15–20% have
local extra thyroidal invasion.
Metastases (1–2% of patients) occur via lymphatics to local lymph nodes
and more distantly to lungs.

Histology
The tumor contains complex branching papilla that have a ﬁbrovascular
core covered by a single layer of tumor cells.
Nuclear features include the following:
• Large size with pale staining, “ground-glass” appearance (Orphan
Annie–eye nucleus)
• Deep nuclear grooves
The characteristic and pathognomonic cytoplasmic feature is the psammoma
body, which is a calciﬁed, laminated, basophilic, stromal structure.

CHAPTER 9

Thyroid cancer

Surgery
Indeterminate nodules
• Lobectomy as initial approach
• Total thyroidectomy if >4 cm, marked atypia on biopsy, “suspicious for
papillary cancer,” family history of thyroid cancer, history of radiation
exposure, bilateral nodular disease

Malignancy
• Lobectomy if <1 cm, low-risk, unifocal, intrathyroidal papillary thyroid
carcinomas (PTC) in the absence of prior head and neck irradiation or
radiological or clinically involved cervical nodal metastases
• Total thyroidectomy if >1 cm unless contraindications

Completion thyroidectomy
• Offer completion thyroidectomy to all patients for whom a total
thyroidectomy would have been recommended had the diagnosis
been available before initial surgery (all patients with thyroid cancer
except those with unifocal subcentimeter disease that was completely
intrathyroidal and node negative)

Neck dissection
• Central (level VI) dissection for patients with clinically involved central
or lateral neck lymph nodes
• Prophylactic central dissection in patients with T3, T4 PTC
• No central dissection for T1, T2 PTC when noninvasive, clinically
node-negative PTCs/most follicular cancer
• Lateral neck dissection for biopsy-proven metastatic lateral cervical
lymphadenopathy

Postoperative thyroid hormone
therapy
For stage TNM I and II disease, the serum TSH concentration should be at
or slightly below the lower half of the reference range (0.1–2.0 mU/L).
For stage III and IV disease, the serum TSH should be <0.1 mU/L.
The presence of heart disease or low bone density may necessitate a
lower level of TSH suppression with smaller doses of thyroxine.
The dose also may be decreased to allow the TSH to rise into the normal range in low-risk patients who remain disease-free for 5 to 10 years
after primary therapy.

RADIOACTIVE IODINE THERAPY

Radioactive iodine therapy
Postoperative radioactive iodine (RAI) ablation is generally performed 1–3
months after total thyroidectomies without remnant thyroid tissue.
RAI is indicated for almost all nonpapillary histologies (i.e., follicular,
Hurthle) as well as various papillary histologies (Table 9.4).

* High-risk features (think about when “selective use”)
• Worrisome histological subtypes (tall cell, columnar, insular, solid,
poorly differentiated)
• Intrathyroidal vascular invasion
• Gross or microscopic multifocal disease
• Recombinant TSH is used for routine RAI remnant ablation
• Levothyroxine (LT4) withdrawal is used if patient has known gross
residual disease or distant metastases
• Discontinue LT 74 weeks before rechecking the TSH (must be
4
>30 mU/L) and proceeding with RAI ablation or scanning.
• Supplement with T 25 mcg bid for 2 weeks after stopping T ,
3
4
followed by a 2-week T3 withdrawal prior to RAI ablation.
• LT may be resumed on second or third day after RAI
4
administration.
• The patient is placed on a low iodine diet for 1–2 weeks to facilitate
the uptake of the radioisotope
Pretreatment scan
• Either 2–5 mCi 131-I with whole body scan (WBS) 48–72 hours later
or 1.3–5 mCi 123-I with WBS 6–24 hours later (may be skipped if very
low risk of metastases and the goal is to ablate remnants)
If using rTSH: obtain a 24-hour 123-I scan on day 3 prior to that day’s
administration of RAI ablation. For example:
• Day 1: rhTSH 0.9 mg IM
• Day 2: rhTSH 0.9 mg IM + 1.5 mCi 123-I
• Day 3: pretreatment WBS then 150 mCi 131-I
• Day 10: post-treatment WBS
Dosing (maximum lifetime dose: 600–800 mCi)
• Low risk: 30–75 mCi (primarily patients under age 45 with tumors
conﬁned to the thyroid gland)
• Intermediate risk: 100 mCi
• High risk of recurrence or death: 100–150 mCi
• Pulmonary metastases: 150 to 200 mCi
• Skeletal metastases: 200 mCi
Post-treatment scan
A post-treatment scan is used to conﬁrm tumor uptake of the treatment
dose 2–8 days later.
Directions after treatment:
• <30 mCi: 5 feet distance for 7 days

• >30–100 mCi: 10 feet distance for 7 days, sleep alone for 2 days, drink
ﬂuids
• Avoid IV contrast for 6–8 weeks, pregnancy for 6–12 months
Side effects
• Short term: nausea, local neck pain, dry mouth (salivary gland toxicity),
bone marrow toxicity, pulmonary toxicity, gastritis, thyroiditis, salty
saliva
• Long term: salivary and bone toxicity, secondary malignancies, fertility,
teratogenicity, dry eyes/conjunctivitis. If xerostomia occurs, see dentist
to avoid dental caries

Management of recurrent disease
Locoregional metastases
• Persistent or recurrent disease conﬁned to the neck: therapeutic
comprehensive lateral and/or central neck dissection
• Patients with recurrent disease who have already undergone prior
comprehensive dissection or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT):
limited lateral and/or central neck dissection

Aerodigestive invasion
• Surgery and RAI and/or EBRT

Pulmonary metastases
• RAI therapy 100–200 mCi repeated every 6–12 months as long as
disease continues to concentrate RAI and respond clinically

Bone metastases
• Surgical resection (especially if age <45), RAI, glucocorticoids.
• If not amenable to surgery, RAI, EBRT, intra-arterial embolization,
radiofrequency ablation (RFA), frequent pamidronate or zolendronate
infusions

Brain metastases
• Surgical resection regardless of RAI avidity
• If not amenable to surgery, EBRT
• If RAI avid, RAI (with prior EBRT and concomitant glucocorticoid
therapy)

FOLLICULAR THYROID CARCINOMA (FTC)

Follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC)
FTC constitutes 15% of all thyroid cancers. The mean patient age in most
studies is 50 years. FTC is more common in women (2:1).
It is relatively more common in endemic goiter areas.

Pathology
Follicular carcinoma is a neoplasm of the thyroid epithelium that exhibits
follicular differentiation and shows capsular or vascular invasion.
Differentiation of benign follicular adenoma from encapsulated low-grade
or minimally invasive tumors is difﬁcult, particularly for the cytopathologist, and therefore surgery is often necessary for a follicular adenoma. FTC
may be minimally invasive or widely invasive.
Metastases (15–20% cases) are more likely to be spread by hematogenesis to the lung and bones and less likely to local lymph nodes.
Hurthle cell carcinoma is an aggressive type of follicular tumor with a
poor prognosis because it fails to concentrate 131I.

Treatment
Treatment is as for papillary thyroid carcinoma.

75

76

CHAPTER 9

Thyroid cancer

Follow-up of papillary and follicular
thyroid carcinoma
For patients with differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) who undergo subtotal thyroidectomy or total thyroidectomy without RAI:
• Follow periodic thyroglobulin (Tg) and perform ultrasound.
• Rising Tg over time is suspicious.
For DTC patients after undergoing total thyroidectomy and remnant ablation, the following schedule is recommended.

6–12 months
• Clinical examination, serum TSH, free thyroxine, neck ultrasound,
thyroglobulin (Tg), and thyroglobulin antibodies while on T4
• If the neck ultrasound is suspicious for lymph nodes or nodules
>5–8mm, send for biopsy for cytology and Tg wash
• If biopsy positive, send for compartment dissection
• If biopsy negative, monitor size of lymph nodes or nodules
• If the ultrasound is negative and TgAb are negative, send for rhTSH
or THW Tg stimulation and diagnostic RAI WBS
• If negative WBS but stimulated Tg>5–10, send for neck/check CT
or PET/CT
• If imaging negative, consider repeat 1–131 therapy
• If imaging positive, consider surgery, 1–131 therapy, EBRT,
clinical trial or tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy
• If negative WBS and stimulated Tg<5–10, monitor Tg and neck
ultrasound. If Tg rising, consider repeat 1–131 therapy
• If positive WBS, consider repeat 1–131 therapy
• If the ultrasound is negative but Tg Ab are positive, follow TgAb and
neck ultrasound

Years 2–10
• Clinical examination, measurements of serum free thyroxine, TSH, and
thyroglobulin annually
• Neck ultrasonography every 1–2 years or less frequently in low-risk
patients with no evidence of disease
• Thyrogen-stimulated Tg and WBS if serum Tg increases or there is
other evidence of recurrence

Years 11–20
• Clinical examination and measurements of serum free thyroxine, TSH,
and thyroglobulin annually
• Neck ultrasonography every 1–3 years or less frequently in low-risk
patients with no evidence of disease
• Thyrogen-stimulated Tg and WBS if serum Tg increases or there is
other evidence of recurrence

FOLLOW-UP OF PAPILLARY

Years 21+
• Clinical examination and measurements of serum free thyroxine, TSH,
and thyroglobulin annually
• Neck ultrasonography every 3–5 years or less frequently in low-risk
patients with no evidence of disease
• Thyrogen-stimulated Tg and radioiodine imaging if serum Tg increases
or there is other evidence of recurrence

Box 9.1 Thyroid cancer in children
• Uncommon, with an incidence of 0.2–5 per million per year
• >85% are papillary, but with more aggressive behavior than in adults
(local invasion and distant metastases are more common)
• An i incidence reported in children in Belarus and Ukraine
following the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986. RET oncogene
rearrangements are common in these tumors.
• Management is similar to that for adults, with a similar controversy
as to the extent of initial surgery.
• Various studies report an overall recurrence rate of 0–39%; diseasefree survival of 80–93%; and disease-speciﬁc mortality of 0–10%.
• Evidence is lacking on the independent risks or beneﬁts of
radioactive iodine or extensive surgery.
• Many investigators recommend lifelong follow-up with a combination
of thyroglobulin and radionuclide scanning.

Thyroid cancer and pregnancy
The natural course of thyroid cancer developing during pregnancy may be
different from that in nonpregnant women. Any woman presenting with
a thyroid nodule during pregnancy appears to have an i risk for thyroid
cancer.
Evaluation should be undertaken with FNAC. Radioiodine scan is
contraindicated.
Lesions <2 cm diameter or any lesion appearing after 24 weeks’ gestation should be treated with TSH suppression and further evaluations
carried out postpartum.
If FNAC is suspicious or diagnostic, operation should be performed at
the earliest safe opportunity—generally the second trimester or immediately postpartum.
131
I ablation should be scheduled for the postpartum period and the
mother advised to stop breast-feeding. She should avoid pregnancy for 6
months after any 131I ablation.

CHAPTER 9

Thyroid cancer

Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)
Also see Chapter 92, MEN type 2 (p. 503).
Accounts for 5–10% of all thyroid cancers. Should be managed by a
dedicated regional service.

Presentation
• Lump in neck
• Systemic effects of calcitonin including ﬂushing and diarrhea

Diagnosis
• FNAC
• Unsuspected at surgery
• Comprehensive family history and screening in search for features of
MEN-2 is needed.
• Pathology specimens show immunostaining for calcitonin and staining
for amyloid.

Management
• Baseline plasma calcitonin
• Baseline biochemical investigations for pheochromocytoma and
hyperparathyroidism
• Genetic screening
• Staging with thoracoabdominal CT/MRI
• MIBG and pentavalent 99mTc DMSA scintography may also be used.

Treatment
• Total thyroidectomy and central node dissection is the preferred
treatment modality.
• Germline RET mutation carriers should ideally undergo thyroidectomy
before 5 years of age.

Adjuvant therapy
• Radioiodine and TSH suppression do not play a role.
• External radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy have not been
shown to be of beneﬁt.
• Therapeutic MIBG may help in some cases.

Follow-up
All patients should have lifelong follow-up at the dedicated regional

Anaplastic (undifferentiated)
thyroid cancer
Rare
Peak incidence: seventh decade. 5:4 = 1:1.5
Characterized by rapid growth of a ﬁrm/hard ﬁxed tumor
Often inﬁltrates local tissue such as larynx and great vessels and so
does not move on swallowing. Stridor and obstructive respiratory
symptoms are common.
• Aggressive, with poor long-term prognosis—7% 5-year survival rate
and a mean survival of 6 months from diagnosis
• Optimal results occur following total thyroidectomy. This is usually not
possible and external irradiation is used, sometimes in association with
chemotherapy.

•
•
•
•

Lymphoma
• Uncommon
• Almost always associated with autoimmune thyroid disease
(Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). Occurs more commonly in women and in
patients aged >40 years.
• Characterized by rapid enlargement of the thyroid gland
• May be limited to thyroid gland or part of a more extensive systemic
lymphoma (usually non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma). Trucut-needle biopsy
may be required.
• Treatment with radiotherapy alone or chemotherapy if more extensive
often produces good results.

Pituitary gland anatomy and physiology

CHAPTER 10

Pituitary gland anatomy and
physiology
Embryology and anatomy
The anterior gland comprises ~2/3 of the pituitary gland and is derived
from the oral ectoderm (Rathke’s pouch). The posterior pituitary gland is
derived from the diencephalon.
The pituitary gland resides in a portion of the sphenoid bone called the
sella turcica and is covered by dura (diaphragma sella).
The pituitary gland is contiguous with the hypothalamus via the pituitary stalk. Anatomically, the pituitary gland is adjacent to several critical
structures, including the optic chiasm (superiorally), the cavernous sinuses
(laterally, and which contain the internal carotid arteries and cranial
nerves [oculomotor(III), trochlear (IV), abducens (VI) and the trigeminal
branches(V1 and V2]) and the sphenoid sinus (inferiorally).
The anterior pituitary gland is vascularized by superior hypophyseal
arteries that form a capillary bed (hypophyseal-portal circulation) into
which hypothalamic releasing and inhibitory factors are delivered.
The pituitary stalk and posterior pituitary gland receive direct arterial
blood supply via the middle and inferior hypophyseal arteries.

ANTERIOR GLAND PHYSIOLOGY

Anterior gland physiology
See Table 10.1. The pituitary gland consists of ﬁve differentiated cell
types that secrete six hormones important for growth, metabolism, stress
responses and reproductive function.

Prolactin (PRL)
PRL is a single-chain polypeptide that belongs to the somatotropin/prolactin family. PRL has a diurnal pattern of secretion, with a sleep-associated
augmentation of PRL levels.

Growth hormone (GH)
GH is a single-chain polypeptide of which the 22 KDa variant is the major
isoform. Pulsatile GH secretions are usually undetectable in the serum
apart from 5–6 noctural bursts, which occur during early sleep stages.

Luteinizing hormone and follicle stimulating
hormone (LH/ FSH)
These are glycoprotein hormones with an α chain common to LH, FSH,
TSH and hCG, but a β chain that is speciﬁc for each hormone. LH and FSH
have complex pulsatile secretion patterns, particularly during puberty and
across the menstrual cycle.

Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
TSH is secreted in a circadian pattern and has increased pulse amplitudes
at night.

Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)
ACTH is derived from a larger precursor polypeptide, proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which also encodes for β endorphins and melanocyte
stimulating hormone. ACTH has a circadian pattern of secretion, with a
peak level at 6–8 A.M. and a nadir level between 11 and 12 P.M. (with
normal sleep-wake cycles).

POSTERIOR GLAND PHYSIOLOGY

Posterior gland physiology
The posterior pituitary gland secretes antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin,
which are synthesized in the hypothalamic neurons of the supraoptic and
paraventricular nuclei.

Antidiuretic hormone (ADH)
ADH is a nonapeptide that is released in response to hyperosmotic and
hypovolemic stimuli. ADH acts on V2 renal collecting tubule receptors to
mediate free water retention, and acts on V1 blood vessel receptors, at
higher concentrations, to cause vasoconstriction. ADH also acts synergistically with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) to augment ACTH
release.

Oxytocin
In women, oxytocin facilitates uterine contraction, during parturition, and
milk let-down in the post-partum period. In men, oxytocin has no known
function but may aid in seminal vesicle contractions.

CHAPTER 11

Imaging

Imaging
Background
High-resolution, contrast-enhanced, thin-cut (3mm) magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) provides the optimal evaluation of the sellar and parasellar
regions.
Coronal and sagittal T1-weighted images, before and after gadolinium
administration, are recommended. T2-weighted imaging is usually unnecessary, but may assist in the diagnosis of cystic lesions. In addition, axial
imaging may be helpful to deﬁne lateral extension with large tumors.
Computed tomography (CT) scans are most useful for patient with
contra-indications to MRIs. In addition, they may demonstrate boney
destruction and calciﬁcation with some tumors (e.g., meningiomas and
craniopharyngiomas).

MRI appearances
See Figure 11.1.
The size, shape and signal characteristics of the pituitary gland vary with
age, gender and physiological status. Non-contrasted T1 images of the
anterior pituitary gland are isointense with cerebral white matter, whereas
the posterior pituitary gland appears hyperintense (as a bright spot), in
most normal subjects.
Following contrast administration, the pituitary gland and stalk enhance,
because they are below the blood–brain barrier.
2 There is signiﬁcant overlap in the imaging characteristics of adenomas,
and other pituitary diseases such as craniopharyngiomas, inﬂammatory/
inﬁltrative lesions and cysts.

PITUITARY ADENOMAS

Fig. 11.1 Normal and abnormal pituitary MRI images. A. Normal coronal, postcontrast T1 image showing optic chiasm (OC). B. Normal saggital image showing
pituitary stalk (PS) and OC. C. Pituitary macroadenoma with evidence of pituitary
gland (PG) compression, left cavernous sinus invasion, and encroachment of carotid
artery (CA). D. Rathke’s cleft cyst—bright T1 image consistent with mucinous,
proteinaceous or blood products.

Pituitary adenomas
See Figure 11.1.
Microadenomas are best appreciated on contrast-enhanced, T1 weighted,
coronal MRI images. They appear as hypointense signals, and often with
associated pituitary gland asymmetry and stalk deviation (contralateral to
the tumor).
Macroadenomas are characterized radiographically by their size and
extrasellar extension. Important considerations include the proximity of
the adenoma to the optic chiasm and any radiological evidence for cavernous sinus invasion. Macroadenomas are frequently heterogenous appearing and may undergo spontaneous necrotic and/or hemorrhagic changes.
On T1-weighted images:
• Low-intensity areas indicate necrotic or cystic changes.
• High-intensity signals indicate hemorrhage (particularly after the acute
phase, days 1-2).
• The normal pituitary gland enhances more avidly with contrast than
tumors, so is commonly seen as an enhanced signal that is peripherally
located.

87

88

CHAPTER 11

Imaging

Craniopharyngioma/Rathke’s cleft cyst
Craniopharyngiomas are typically suprasellar in location. They vary in
content from cystic to mixed solid/cystic (most commonly) to predominantly solid. Imaging characteristics vary with the tumor composition.
Calciﬁcations are a distinguishing feature of adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas, and are best detected by CT scans.
Rathke’s cleft cysts (RCC) are typically intrasellar, but may extend into
the suprasellar space. MRI images vary by cyst content from hypointense
(with serous ﬂuid), to hyperintense (with mucinous, proteinaceous or
blood products) on T1-weighted images.

THYROTROPES

Pituitary function testing
Background
• Pituitary function is best assessed with basal concentrations of the
pituitary hormones and their corresponding target gland hormones.
• Pituitary hormone deﬁciency is established by a low target hormone
level in the setting of a low, or an inappropriately normal pituitary
hormone level. In equivocal cases, stimulation tests are used to
assess the pituitary hormone reserve (e.g., Insulin tolerance test for
GH deﬁciency).
• Pituitary hormone excess (or less commonly, resistance to target
organ hormone) is established by a high target hormone level in the
setting of an inappropriately normal or a high pituitary hormone
level. In equivocal cases, suppression tests are used to assess for a
hyper-secretory state. (e.g., OGTT for acromegaly).

Lactotropes
Basal testing
Lactotrope function is best assessed by a fasting PRL level.
Dynamic testing
None is used.

Thyrotropes
Basal testing
Thyrotrope function is best assessed with concomitant TSH and circulating thyroid hormone levels (free T4 and less commonly, T3).
Dynamic testing
None is used; TRH is not commercially available in the United States.

89

90

CHAPTER 12

Pituitary function testing

Gonadotropes
Basal testing
Gonadotrope function is best assessed with concomitant gonadotropin
(FSH and LH) and sex steroid levels: estradiol (in females) and testosterone (in males).
In premenopausal females, because the gonadotropin levels differ signiﬁcantly across the menstrual cycle, hormone testing should be performed
in the early follicular phase (days 1–5 after the onset of menses), when the
LH and FSH levels are approximately equal.
In males, testosterone levels are best assessed in the early morning (7–9
A.M.), which corresponds to normal peak levels.

Dynamic testing
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnHR) testing is most commonly used
to assess pubertal disorders, particularly precocious puberty.

CORTICOTROPES

Corticotropes
Basal testing
Basal cortisol levels have a broad normal range: 3–18 mcg/dL. Random
A.M. cortisol levels <3 mcg/dL indicate adrenal insufﬁciency, whereas
levels >18 mcg/dL exclude adrenal insufﬁciency. A stimulation test is indicated for equivocal cortisol values to exclude adrenal insufﬁciency.
Midnight salivary or serum cortisol levels, which correspond to
the normal nadir level, are used as screening tests for cortisol excess
(Cushing’s syndrome).

Stimulation testing
Insulin tolerance test (ITT) and metyrapone tests are the gold standards
for assessing corticotrope deﬁciency.
The ITT is based on the physiological stressor of insulin-induced hypoglycemia on CRH–ACTH–cortisol activation (and GH release) and assesses
the complete hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis.
• Test protocol: Insulin bolus (0.1-0.15 units/kg IV). Goal glucose <40
mg/dL. Normal serum cortisol >18 mcg/dL
• ITT has the disadvantages of being labor intensive, requiring close
monitoring and having a number of important contraindications.

Contraindications to ITT
•
•
•
•

Abnormal ECG
Ischemic heart disease
Seizures
Elderly

Metyrapone test protocol: Metyrapone (30 mg/kg) is given at 11–12 P.M.,
and 11-dexocycortisol (DOC), ACTH and cortisol are measured the next
morning.
• Normal response: 11-DOC >7 mcg/dL, ACTH >50 pg/mL and
cortisol < 5 mcg/dL.
2 Metyrapone must be obtained by written request from Novartis in the
U.S.
• Cosyntropin stimulation test: The Synacthen® test is performed
with synthetic ACTH (amino acids 1–24) which stimulates the adrenal
glands See Box 12.1.
2 Importantly, the Cosyntropin test is unreliable for assessing adrenal
dysfunction attributable to acute CRH/ACTH deﬁciencies (within
several weeks).

CRH test for Cushing’s disease
Administration of 100 mcg of CRH (IV) leads to an exaggerated rise in
cortisol (20%, above basal at 30/45 minutes (mean)) and ACTH (35% above
basal at 15/30 minutes (mean)) in patients with Cushing’s disease.
The test sensitivity and speciﬁcity are 91% and 88%, respectively.

91

92

CHAPTER 12

Pituitary function testing

Box 12.1 Cosyntropin stimulation test
• The test can be done at any time of the day.
• Prednisone and hydrocortisone, but not dexamethasone, interfere
with the cortisol assay.
• Synacthen® is administered 250 mcg IV, and cortisol is measured at 0,
30 and 60 minutes.
• A normal post-stimulation cortisol level should increase to >18 mcg/dL.
• Controversy still exists regarding the utility of the low-dose (1 mcg)
ACTH test, although this test is limited by the lack of a commerciallyavailable preparation. In addition, a number of studies showed
comparable test performance characteristics between the high-dose
(250 mcg) and the low-dose ACTH tests.

Suppression tests for Cushing’s syndrome
• 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test: 1 mg dexamethasone is given
between 11 and 12 P.M., and a serum cortisol is drawn the following
morning (8 A.M.).
• Interpretation: cortisol <1.8 mcg/dL (with a sensitive cortisol assay)
excludes Cushing’s syndrome
• 8 mg dexamethasone suppression test is used to distinguish ectopic
Cushing’s from Cushing’s disease. 8 mg dexamethasone is given at
11–12 P.M., and a random cortisol is drawn the following morning.
• Interpretation: A  50% decreases in basal cortisol level is suggestive
of CD, although ~20% of ectopic ACTH tumors (particularly
bronchia Carcinoids) may suppress to this degree.
• DEX-CRH test is used to distinguish pseudo-Cushing’s disease from
Cushing’s disease: Dexamethasone (0.5 mg q6h x 8 doses) starting at
12 noon, followed by CRH administration (1 mcg/kg) at
8 A.M. (2 hours after the ﬁnal dexamethasone dose).
• Normal cortisol suppression will be observed in pseudo-Cushing’s
disease: cortisol <1.4 mcg/dL (5-15 minutes after CRH), but not in
Cushing’s disease. Test sensitivity and speciﬁcity are 98% and 70%,
respectively.

SOMATOTROPES

Somatotropes
Basal testing
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) represents integrated GH secretion
and varies signiﬁcantly with age and gender.
2 IGF-1 is generally not a good indicator for GH deﬁciency in adults
>40 years of age.
Random growth hormone levels are generally not useful unless very low
(excludes acromegaly) or very elevated [(suggestive of acromegaly) and
excludes growth hormone deﬁciency (GHD)].
Patients with 3 pituitary hormone deﬁciencies, and a low IGF-1 level,
have a >95% probability of GHD and can generally forego GH stimulation
testing.

Suppression test for acromegaly
Oral glucose (75 g) is given after an overnight fast, followed by serial GH
measurements every 30 minutes × 2 hours. Normal response is GH <1
mcg/dL (with RIA) and <0.30 mcg/dL (with ultrasensitive GH assays).

Stimulation tests for growth hormone deﬁciency
The insulin tolerance test is the gold standard for GHD testing, although
it has limited use because of the disadvantages stated above. GHRH plus
arginine (Semorelin) is the second-best provocative test for GH deﬁciency, but is no longer commercially available in the U.S.
• Glucagon and arginine, although suboptimal GH secretagogues, are
now commonly used to assess GHD.
• Glucagon test protocol: Glucagon-1 mg IM is given, followed by serial
GH measurements q 30 minutes for 3 hours.
• Normal response: GH level >3 mcg/dL (using an ultrasensitive
assay). Test sensitivity and speciﬁcity are >95%.
• Arginine test protocol: Arginine 0.5g/kg (max 30 g) in 100 mL
normal saline is infused IV over 30 minutes, followed by serial GH
measurements q 30 minutes for 2 hours.
• Normal response: GH level >0.4 mcg/dL. Test sensitivity is 87% and
speciﬁcity is 91%.

CHAPTER 13

Hypopituitarism

Hypopituitarism

Deﬁnition
Hypopituitarism is deﬁned as the partial or complete deﬁciency of one or
more pituitary hormones from hypothalamic or pituitary gland diseases.

Etiologies of hypopituitarism
2 Pituitary tumors and/or their treatments account for 775% of cases
(in adults)
• Radiotherapy—hypothalamus, pituitary, skull base tumors
• Pituitary infarction/hemorrhage
• Inﬁltrative diseases—sarcoidosis, lymphocytic hypophysitis
hemochromatosis, Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis, metastases.
• Infection—tuberculosis, pituitary abscess, meningitis
• Traumatic brain injury
• Isolated hypothalamic releasing hormone deﬁciency—e.g., Kallmann’s
syndrome is congenital GnRH deﬁciency + anosmia
• Parasellar tumors—craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas, chordomas,
gliomas, schwanomas
• Congenital pituitary transcription factor mutations: POU1F1 gene
mutations (GH, PRL, and TSH deﬁciencies). PROP1 gene mutations
(GH, PRL, TSH, FSH/LH ± ACTH deﬁciencies). Isolated ACTH
deﬁciency (very rare)

FEATURES

Features
The clinical features of hypopituitarism depend on the severity of the hormone deﬁciency (from partial to complete) and the rate of development
(from acute to chronic) (see Table 13.1).
2The loss of anterior pituitary hormone function, from pituitary diseases
and/or their treatments, generally follows a predictable order:
GH 8 GnRH > ACTH 8 TSH >PRL
• ADH deﬁciency is very rare with pituitary adenomas.
• The clinical features of hypopituitarism are generally similar to
those of target gland insufﬁciency. A notable exception is the lack of
pigmentation and hyperkalemia in secondary adrenal insufﬁciency vs.
primary adrenal insufﬁciency.
• Houssay phenomenon is deﬁned as the improvement of diabetes
mellitus in patients with hypopituitarism due to a reduction in
counterregulatory hormones (GH and cortisol).

Apoplexy
Apoplexy is the clinical syndrome of sudden headache, visual impairment,
ophthalmoplegia, and/or altered mental status caused by hemorrhage or
infarction of the pituitary gland. It occurs in 710–15% of pituitary adenomas.
Subclinical apoplexy is more common than clinically-apparent disease.
Treatment
Surgical decompression is indicated for patients with severe neuroophthalamologic signs, such as severely reduced visual acuity or a deteriorating level of consciousness. Secondary adrenal insufﬁciency complicates
up to 70% of apoplectic patients, and is a major cause of morbidity and
mortality in untreated cases.
Stress-dose glucocorticoids (50–100 mg IV hydrocortisone q 6–8 hours)
are indicated for patients with proven or presumptive adrenal insufﬁciency
(i.e., hemodynamic instability). Panhypopituitarism is common and should
be evaluated and managed expectantly after an acute apoplectic event.

Empty sella syndrome (ESS)
ESS is deﬁned as a sella that is partially or completely ﬁlled with CSF.
• Primary ESS is most often due to arachnoid herniation through a
congenital diaphragmatic defect. Hyperprolactinemia occurs in 710% of
cases, but hypopituitarism is uncommon.
• Secondary ESS is due to a pituitary tumor and/or its treatment (e.g.,
apoplexy, surgery or radiotherapy). Hypopituitarism is common with
this condition.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
TBIs associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage and skull-based fractures
have a high incidence of hypopituitarism. In addition, patients with moderate-to-severe head traumas are also at increased risk for hypopituitarism.
The most common deﬁciencies are GH and gonadotropins (10–15% of
cases), and these are best assessed at 6–12 months, post-TBI.

TREATMENT

Investigations
Basal levels
Basal concentrations of the anterior pituitary hormones and their target
organ hormones should be measured. Pituitary hormone deﬁciencies are
characterized by low levels of target hormones in the setting of low or
inappropriately normal pituitary hormone levels.
• TSH and free T4
• ACTH and A.M.Cortisol
• PRL
• LH, FSH, A.M. testosterone (4), estradiol (5)
• GH, IGF-1

Dynamic pituitary hormone testing
This testing is done to assess for GHD and adrenal insufﬁciency (b see
p. 92).

Posterior pituitary function
• Serum sodium, serum osmolality, urine osmolality and 24-hour urinary
volume
• A formal water deprivation test should be performed in cases of
suspected diabetes insipidus.

Treatment
Hypopituitarism treatment involves management of the underlying etiology, and hormone replacement as indicated (b see p. 99)

CHAPTER 14

Anterior pituitary hormone replacement

Anterior pituitary hormone
replacement

Background
Anterior pituitary hormone deﬁciencies are usually repleted with the target hormones. Exceptions are GH replacement in adults, and gonadotropin replacement for fertility treatment.

Glucocorticoid replacement
See Table 14.1.
• Patients with ACTH deﬁciency need only glucocorticoid replacement,
as mineralcorticoid secretion, via the renin–angiotension–aldosterone
axis, is still intact.
• Prednisone and hydrocortisone are the most commonly used medications.
Dexamethasone is generally avoided in secondary adrenal deﬁciency
because of its long half-life (36 hours), and non-physiological proﬁle.
• The goal for replacement is the lowest possible glucocorticoid dose that
eliminates clinical features of glucocorticoid deﬁciency (see Table 13.1),
and also avoids clinical signs and symptoms of glucocorticoid excess (e.g.,
Cushingoid features, weight gain, hypertension, dyslipidemia, impaired
glucose tolerance and decreased bone mineral density).
1 Patients with concomitant thyroid hormone deﬁciency should initiate
glucocorticoid replacement ﬁrst, because T4 accelerates cortisol metabolism and may precipitate an adrenal crisis.

Safety and stress-dose steroids
Patients with adrenal insufﬁciency should be encouraged to carry appropriate medical identiﬁcation and should also be instructed in the indications for increased glucocorticoid dosing, as follows:
• Mild disease without fever: no change in glucocorticoid replacement
• Febrile illness: double or triple the replacement dose for the duration
of fever. “3 x 3” day rule
• Vomiting or diarrhea: parenteral therapy and seek medical assistance
• Minor surgery (e.g., under local anesthetic, arthroscopy, dental
procedure): 25 mg hydrocortisone at the time of the procedure, then
usual replacement dose.
• Moderate surgical stress (e.g., cholecystectomy, joint replacement):
50–75 mg hydrocortisone QD × 2 days, then usual replacement dose
• Severe illness/major operation: parenteral therapy (IV) hydrocortisone
50–100 mg q6–8h × 2–3 days, with subsequent taper to maintenance
glucocorticoid dose

Growth hormone replacement
X GH replacement has been approved for use in adult since 1996, but is
still somewhat controversial regarding the cost–beneﬁt ratio relative to
other medical therapies for GHD-related comorbidities.
GH therapy is most likely to beneﬁt those patients who have severe
clinical and biochemical manifestations of GH deﬁciency.

Treatment and Monitoring
• Start with a low, age-appropriate GH dose, and titrate according to
clinical response, IGF-1 levels and side effects.
• Goal: IGF-1 in the upper half of the normal range for age and gender
• Annual lipid level, fasting blood sugar, DEXA scans (every 1–2 years)
• Reversible, dose-dependent side effects: peripheral edema, headaches
hypertension, arthralgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, impaired glucose
tolerance or diabetes
2 In general, premenopausal women and women taking oral estrogens
require higher GH doses than do males, because estrogen antagonizes
GH at the liver.
1 GH increases the conversion of T4 to T3, so GH replacement may
decrease free T4 levels. In addition, GH increases cortisol metabolism to cortisone, so GH replacement may unmask subclinical adrenal
insufﬁciency.

CHAPTER 14

Anterior pituitary hormone replacement

Thyroid hormone replacement
This is as discussed in the section on primary hypothyroidism (b p. 58).

Monitoring
In central hypothyroidism, unlike in primary hypothyroidism, the TSH level
cannot be used to assess the adequacy of thyroid hormone replacement,
and instead the free T4 level is used exclusively for monitoring.
• The free T4 level should be maintained in the upper half or third of the
normal range.

Sex hormone replacement

Epidemiology
• Pituitary adenomas are the most common pituitary disease in adults
(Box 15.1).

most commonly microadenomas (<5 mm).
• Clinically-apparent pituitary disease occurs in an estimated 71:10,000
people/year.
• Pituitary carcinomas are very rare (<0.1% of tumors), and but most
commonly involve ACTH and PRL-secreting tumors.

CHAPTER 15

Pituitary tumor basics

Functional status
This is deﬁned by clinical and biochemical evidence of hormone excess.
Tumor Types and Distribution
• Nonfunctioning adenomas (bonadotropinoma/null cell adenoma) 30–35%
• Prolactinoma: 35–40%
• Growth hormone adenoma (acromegaly): 10–15%
• ACTH adenoma (Cushing’s disease): 10–15%
• TSH adenoma: <2%

Mass effects
Common with macroadenomas and include the following:
• Headache
• Visual ﬁeld defects (uni- or bitemporal quadrantanopia or hemianopia)
• Hypopituitarism
• Ophthalmoplegia/cranial nerve palsies (CN III, IV and VI)
• Vision loss (optic nerve atrophy)
• CSF rhinorrhea (rarely from inferior tumor extension)

Pathophysiology
• Adenomas are monoclonally-derived tumors, and they are categorized
by their hormone expression, as determined by clinical/biochemical
features and immunohistochemical staining (on surgically-resected
pathology specimens).
• The most important oncogene involved in sporadic pituitary adenomas
tumorgenesis is gsp-which encodes a constitutively-active mutation in
the A-subunit of the stimulatory G protein. This mutation occurs in
740% of GH tumors.
• Various other mutations, including: growth factor receptors (FGFR4),
tumor suppressor genes (ZAC, MEG3, menin, GADD45G), oncogenes
(PTTG), cell signaling pathways (BMP-4), and cell cycle regulators (p53,
p27, p16, p18, cyclin D/E), have been detected in pituitary adenomas
but do not account for most mutations. In addition, RAS mutations
occur in rare pituitary carcinomas.
• Inheritable diseases associated with pituitary tumors are uncommon
(<5%) and include MEN-1, McCune–Albright syndrome, Carney’s
complex and familial somatotropinoma syndromes. PRL- and
GH-secreting tumors are the most common tumor types.

Investigations
• For microadenomas, evaluate clinically and biochemically for
hormone excess. Check basal PRL TSH, free T4, FSH, LH,
testosterone (in males), estradiol (in females) and IGF-1 levels.
Screen for Cushing’s disease if clinically indicated (see , b p. 118).
• For macroadenomas, assess for hormone excess and deﬁciencies.
• Conduct formal visual ﬁeld tests for patients with subjective vision loss
and with tumors that abut the optic chiasm.

MANAGEMENT AND NATURAL HISTORY

Management and natural history
Adenomas with excess hormone secretion (of any size) and non-functioning
macroadenomas associated with mass effects require treatment.
• Medical therapy, with dopamine agonists, is ﬁrst-line therapy for
prolactinomas (micro- or macroadenomas).
• Transsphenoidal resection is indicated for all other functioning and
non-functioning tumor types.
• For patients without speciﬁc indications for treatment, periodic MRI
surveillance is recommended.
• Approximately 10% of incidentally-detected microadenomas and
730–50% of macroadenomas will signiﬁcantly enlarge, without
treatment, over a 8 year period.

CHAPTER 16

Prolactinomas

Prolactinomas
Epidemiology
• Prolactinomas account for 735–40% of pituitary tumors and are the
most common functioning tumor
• Female-predominance 10:1, 5:4
• Microadenomas are more common in females, whereas macroadenomas
are more common in males at the time of presentation.

Etiology/pathogenesis
See Box 16.1 for causes of hyperprolactinemia.
Prolactinomas are the most common pituitary tumor in MEN-1, occur in
20% of cases, and may be more aggressive than sporadic prolactinomas.

Clinical features
Hyperprolactinemia effects (microadenomas and
macroadenomas)
• Galactorrhea (up to 90% of women, <10% of men)
• Hyperprolactinemia inhibits GnRH release, leading to
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.
• Women present with menstrual disturbance—amenorrhea,
oligomenorrhea, reduced libido and infertility.
• Men present with loss of libido, erectile dysfunction and in fertility.
Gynecomastia is uncommon.
• Hyperprolactinemia is associated with a long-term risk of d bone
mineral density.
• Hyperprolactinemia was an adverse effect on libido, independent from
hypogonadism.

Physiological
• Pregnancy
• Sexual intercourse
• Nipple stimulation, suckling
• Physical and/or psychological stressors
Pituitary tumors
• Prolactinomas
• Mixed GH/PRL tumor
• Macroadenoma-related stalk compression
Parasellar causes
• Hypothalamic disease—stalk compression (craniopharyngioma,

serotonin reuptake inhibitors)
• Antihypertensive drugs—verapamil, methyldopa, reserpine.
• Opiates and cocaine

106

CHAPTER 16

Prolactinomas

Investigations
Serum PRL
• Normative PRL levels differ by gender and are slightly higher in females
(e.g., 20–25 ng/mL in females, and 15–20 ng/mL in males).
• A slightly elevated PRL may represent a stress response or a pulsed
secretion and should be conﬁrmed with additional PRL measurements.
• Serum PRL levels >100–150 ng/mL are suggestive of pituitary
prolactinomas, whereas lower PRL levels are generally more
consistent with non-tumoral etiologies (e.g., medications, renal
insufﬁciency, stalk effect) or very small prolactinomas.
• PRL levels generally trend with adenoma size.
2 Exclude GH co-secretion with a prolactinoma (20–25% of tumors) as
clinically indicated.

Issue with PRL measurements
Hook effect
This is a lab artifact of a two-site immunoassay is which very high PRL
levels (most commonly from giant [>4 cm] prolactinomas) saturate both
the capture and the detection antibodies and prevent “sandwich” complex
formation. The PRL levels are spuriously normal or only slightly elevated.
2 PRL assays of large tumors, and suspected prolactinomas, should be
performed as a 1:100–1000 diluted serum sample.

Hyperprolactinemia and drugs
Antipsychotics and antidepressants are among the most common medications that cause hyperprolactinemia (dopamine agonists are contraindicated with psychiatric diseases). For cases of medication-induced
hyperprolactinemia that are complicated by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, consideration could be given, under the guidance of a psychiatrist or a mental health professional, to a trial of an alternate psychiatric
medication that is not associated with hyperprolactinemia. Alternatively,
the hypogonadism could be treated with sex steroid replacement.

Idiopathic hyperprolactinemia
Hyperprolactinemia of unclear etiology is designated idiopathic but is likely
due to an undetected microprolactinoma on imaging or to hypothalamic
dysregulation. PRL normalizes in 71/3 of idiopathic cases.

TREATMENT

Treatment
Aims of therapy
Microprolactinomas
• Restoration of normal gonadal function and libido
• Relief from galactorrhea
Macroprolactinomas
• Reduction in tumor size and prevention of tumor growth
• Clinical improvement in signs and symptoms of tumor mass effects
(e.g., headaches, vision impairment or hypopituitarism)
• Restoration of normal gonadal function and libido

Drug therapy—dopamine agonists
Dopamine agonist (DA) treatment (b see Dopamine agonists, p. 144) is
ﬁrst-line medical therapy for patients with prolactinomas and normalizes
prolactin levels, and signiﬁcantly decreases tumor size in >90% of cases.
Dopamine agonist resistance is uncommon (see Box 16.2)
• Cabergoline (Dostinex) is the preferred therapy because of its greater
efﬁcacy at normalizing PRL levels and decreasing tumor size than
bromocriptine. In addition, cabergoline is better tolerated and requires
less frequent dosing (twice weekly).
• Bromocriptine (Parlodel) is recommended for women seeking fertility,
because of the greater safety data in pregnancy.
• Monitoring: Adjust DA agonist every 1–2 months as needed to maintain
PRL in the normative range. Repeat MRI at 76–12 months, particularly
with macroadenomas, to ensure that the tumor size decreases with
the PRL levels. PRL normalization generally precedes a decreased
tumor size by several weeks to months.

Sex steroids
Estrogen/progesterone replacement (in females) or testosterone therapy
(in males), rather than dopamine agonist therapy, may be appropriate

Box 16.2 Dopamine agonist resistance
• General deﬁnition: failure to normalize prolactin and/or failure to
decrease tumor size by <50%. More commonly, drug non-compliance
or drug intolerance lead to an erroneous diagnosis of DA resistance.
• Prevalence: resistance is observed in 711% and 5–10% of cabergolinetreated patients, respectively.
• Etiology: reduced tumor D2 receptors concentration
• Treatment options: switch dopamine agonists, increase dose as
tolerated, surgery, fertility treatment, sex steroid replacement or
radiation therapy (for macroprolactinomas)

Prolactinomas

for patients with idiopathic hyperprolactinemia or microprolactinomas in
whom fertility, galactorrhea and/or decreased libido are not of concerns.

Surgery
b See Transsphenoidal surgery (p. 140).
Transsphenoidal surgery is second-line therapy and is indicated for
patients who are resistant to, or intolerant of, dopamine agonists. In addition, prolactinoma patients who have severe or vision-threatening apoplexy that is unresponsive to initial medical management are also potential
surgical candidates.
• The surgical success rates vary by the tumor size, the neurosurgery
expertise and previous treatment, but range between 73.3 ± 10.7%
for microadenomas and 38.0 ± 21.3% for macroadenomas (in large
surgical series).

Radiotherapy
b See Radiation therapy for pituitary tumors (p. 147).
Radiation therapy is generally indicated for patients with residual or
recurrent prolactinomas after failed medical and surgical approaches.

Long-term management (see Box 16.3)
Pituitary Society Guidelines support attempted DA dose reduction or discontinuation if, after 72 years of medical therapy, the PRL level remains
normal and the MRI shows a marked tumor reduction.
• PRL should then be closely monitored for recurrence, which is
usually observed in the ﬁrst several months after drug withdrawal.
The best predictor of reoccurrence is the presence of residual
tumor on MRI.
• In cases of DA re-initiation or long-term use, patients should be
maintained on the lowest possible DA dose that achieves the
desired treatment goals.

Box 16.3 Cabergoline and cardiac valvulopathy
• Cabergoline, but not bromocriptine is a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2B
receptor agonist.
• High doses of cabergoline (e.g., 3 mg/day for 6 months in
Parkinson’s patients) have been associated with valvular heart disease
(aortic, mitral, and tricuspid regurgitations) via a 5-HT2B off-target
effect.
• The risk of cardiac valvulopathy appears to be low in prolactinoma
patients on standard doses of cabergoline (2 mg/week).
• For patients requiring higher cabergoline doses, annual clinical
cardiac exams are warranted, and consideration should be given to
periodic echocardiograms.

CHAPTER 17

Acromegaly

Acromegaly

Deﬁnition
Acromegaly is the clinical condition resulting from prolonged exposure to
excessive GH/IGF-1 levels in adults.

Epidemiology
Estimated annual incidence is 3–4 cases/million population. There is equal
sex distribution. Acromegaly has an insidious onset which often results in
a delayed diagnosis (77–10 years).

Etiologies of acromegaly
• Pituitary adenoma (95% of cases)
Rare causes of GH excess
• GHRH secretion—hypothalamic tumor (gangliocytoma)
• Ectopic GHRH—carcinoid tumors (e.g., pancreas, lung),
pheochromocytoma and medullary thyroid cancer
• Ectopic GH secretion—pancreatic islet cell tumor and lymphoma

Pathophysiology
• Constitutively-active mutations of the A-subunit of the stimulatory G
protein are seen in 730–40% of densely granulated GH tumors.
• Familial syndromes: MEN-1, Carney complex, and McCune–Albright
syndrome can manifest with GH tumors in 710% of cases.
• Isolated familial somatotropinomas are associated with aryl
hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein (AIP gene) mutations in
710–15% of cases.

Clinical features
The clinical features arise from the somatic and metabolic effects of prolonged excess GH/IGF-1 exposure.

Symptoms
• Hyperhidrosis (i Sweating)
• Headaches—independent of tumor effect

CLINICAL FEATURES

CHAPTER 17

Acromegaly

Investigations
Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)
IGF-1 is the single best screening test for acromegaly (Fig. 17.1). IGF-1 has
a long half-life (18–20 hours), reﬂects integrated GH secretion, and correlates with clinical features of acromegaly. It is important to use age- and
gender-based normative ranges for IGF-1.
2 Etiologies for false negative (low) IGF-1 levels include: malnutrition,
hypothyroidism, poorly controlled type I diabetes mellitus (DM), and
chronic liver disease.

INVESTIGATIONS

Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)
OGTT is a conﬁrmatory test for acromegaly and is indicated for an equivocal IGF-1 level (on screening), or after transsphenoidal surgery to assess
for disease control. An abnormal test is deﬁned by a failure to suppress
GH to <1 mcg/dL (in response to a 75 g oral glucose load), as assessed by
GH measurements every 30 minutes over a 2-hour period. Lower cutoffs
(<0.30 mcg/dL) are recommended for ultrasensitive GH assays.
2 Etiologies for false positive results (failure to suppress GH) include:
chronic renal and liver failure, malnutrition, anorexia, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, heroin addiction, estrogen use, pregnancy and adolescence
(due to high pubertal GH surges).

Random GH
This is generally not useful for the diagnosis of acromegaly, but a low random GH level (<0.40 mcg/dL with an ultrasensitive assay), in conjunction
with a normal IGF-1 level, excludes the diagnosis.

MRI
MRI usually demonstrates a pituitary tumor (>95%), of which 80% are
macroadenomas.

Pituitary function testing
Serum PRL may be elevated from stalk effect or GH/PRL tumors’ cosecretion. In case of macroadenomas, assess other anterior pituitary
hormones (e.g., free T4, cortisol, testosterone or estradiol) to exclude
hypopituitarism.

GHRH
In cases where a pituitary tumor is not identiﬁed, a serum GHRH level
and chest and abdomen imaging are recommend to identify a potential
extrapituitary source of GH excess.

Comorbidities
Evaluate and treat potential comorbid conditions, including: impaired glucose intolerance/diabetes, dyslipidemia, sleep apnea, cardiac disease (baseline EKG and echocardiogram) and colonic polyps (colonoscopy).

113

114

CHAPTER 17

Acromegaly

Management
Transsphenoidal surgery
See Transsphenoidal surgery (p. 140). This is ﬁrst-line therapy in most U.S.
neurosurgery centers. Cure rates are generally 80–90% for microadenomas
and 40–60% for macroadenomas.
Role of preoperative somatostatin analog treatment
There is limited evidence to recommend preoperative treatment to
improve surgical outcomes or postoperative complications, although
treatment can be considered for large, invasive tumors (if anticipated surgical delays), or for signiﬁcant GH-related co-morbidities such as congestive heart failure or severe OSA.

Criteria for cure
Deﬁned as
• Absence of clinical signs and symptoms of GH excess
• Normalization of IGF-1 levels
• GH nadir following OGTT to <1 mcg/dL (or <0.30 mcg/dL with an
ultrasensitive GH assay)
• Failed OGTT, with normal IGF-1, is a potential marker of recurrence
risk.
• 730% discordance rates between the IGF-1 and the OGTT results
have been observed in acromegalics:
– High GH/normal IGF-1 is more common in young estrogensufﬁcient females and somatostatin-treated patients.
– Normal GH/high IGF-1 is more common in older patients and
radiation-treated patients.

Medical therapies
Somatostatin analogs
b See Somatostatin analogs (p. 145).
• Somatostatin analogs are the ﬁrst-line medical therapy after failed or
incomplete surgical resection.
• They may be used as primary therapy in patients who are not surgical
candidates.
Efﬁcacy
• Normalizes IGF-1 levals in 750–60% /of patients.
• More efﬁcacious with densely-granulated GH tumors than the
sparsely-granulated GH sub-type.
• Constrains tumor growth (>90%) and decreases tumor size (mild to
moderately) in 750% of patients.
GH receptor antagonists (pegvisomant)
b see Pegvisomant (p. 146).
• Indicated for somatostatin non-responders or intolerance
• Normalizes of IGF-1 levels in >90% of patients
• IGF-1 levels are used exausively to monitor therapy (not GH).

MORTALITY DATA

Dopamine agonists
b See Dopamine agonists (p. 144).
• Therapy is generally ineffective at normalizing IGF-1 levels, but may be
useful for GH/PRL co-secretors.
• Only cabergoline is effective (not bromocriptine), but requires
signiﬁcantly higher doses than those used for prolactinomas (3 mg/
week).

Radiotherapy
b Also see Technique (p. 147).
Generally this is third-line therapy after failed surgery and medical
approaches, although radiation therapy can be used to decrease the need
for lifelong medications.
• Normalization of GH hypersecretion may take several years (e.g.,
5–10 years) with conventional radiotherapy, although it is likely
faster with smaller tumors ± stereotactic radiosurgery.
• Adjunctive medical treatment (e.g., somatostatin analogs or
pegvisomant) is usually required during the latency period after XRT.
• Prevention of tumor growth precedes control of GH hypersecretion
by several months to years.

Mortality data
A recent meta-analysis found an overall 772% increase in all-cause mortality in patients with acromegaly compared with the general population.
• Historically, major causes of mortality in acromegalic patients
include cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases and
malignancies.
• A greater awareness of acromegaly, newer medications and
improved treatment strategies, over the past decade, have resulted
in earlier diagnosis, better outcomes and decreased mortality rates.

CHAPTER 18

Cushing’s disease

Cushing’s disease

Deﬁnition
Cushing’s syndrome (CS) is a disease complex that results from chronic
hypercortisolemia of any cause.
Cushing’s disease (CD) is hypercortisolemia from an ACTH-secreting
pituitary tumor chronic. Untreated hypercortisolemia leads to a 73 to
5-fold increased mortality rate.

Epidemiology
• Annual incidence of CD is approximately 2–4/million population
• Female prevalence (3–15:1, 5:4)
• Age at diagnosis-20–40 years
X Subclinical CS may be more common than clinically-Apparent CS,
although this is still a controversial area regarding deﬁnition, diagnosis and
optimal management.

Differential diagnosis
• Iatrogenic etiologies (e.g., oral, inhaled or topical steroids) are the
most common cause of CS
• Pseudo-Cushing’s disease, deﬁned as non-tumorous activation of the
HPA axis from multiple potential stressors, including: psychiatric
disorders (i.e., severe depression, anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive
disorder), uncontrolled diabetes, alcoholism and severe obesity.
• Glucocorticoid resistance syndrome

Etiologies of CS
The majority of endogenous Cushing’s syndrome is due to ACTH-secreting

CHAPTER 18

Cushing’s disease

Investigations
Step 1. Conduct screening tests
Consider screening patients who have multiple and progressive
‘high-discriminatory’ features consistent with Cushing’s syndrome, particularly with an early onset (Box 18.2). In addition, patients with an adrenal
adenoma >1 cm should be screened.
2 Note: All screening tests can give false-positive results with pseudoCushing’s disease.
Outpatient screening tests (Fig. 18.1).
24-hour urinary free cortisol (UFC)
• At least two measurements
• Upper limit of normal for costisol is assay dependent (e.g.,
antibody-based
> chromatography-based).
2 Caveats: 1) Some medications can interfere with the cortisol assays
(e.g., fenoﬁbrate, carbamazepine and digoxin can give false-positive results
on HPLC-based assays), and 2) reduced glomerular ﬁltration rates (GFR)
<60 mL/min may lead to false-negative results.
Overnight dexamethasone suppression test (DST)
• Administration of 1 mg dexamethasone (DEX) at 11–12 P.M., followed
by a serum cortisol measurement the following morning (between 7 and
9 A.M.). A longer, low-dose dexamethasone suppression test (2 mg/day
for 48 hours) is a comparable screening test.
• Normal: Serum cortisol < 1.8 mcg/dL (with a sensitive cortisol assay)
2 Caveats: The following interfering conditions should be excluded:
d dexamethasone absorption, hepatic enzyme inducers (e.g., phenytoin,
carbamazepine, and rifampin), and i (cortisol-binding globulin (CBG)
(from oral contraceptive pills, which should be discontinued 6 weeks
before testing or pregnancy). A morning dexamethasone level can be
drawn to exclude rapid metabolism in speciﬁc cases.
Midnight salivary cortisol
• At least two measurements
2 Caveats: Patients must have a normal sleep–wake cycle.

Step 2. Establish the cause
ACTH
A basal A.M. ACTH level should be measured to distinguish between
ACTH-dependent vs. ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome.
• ACTH >10 pmol/mL indicate an ACTH-dependent etiology
• ACTH levels are generally higher in ectopic patients, although 1/3
are within the normal range.
• ACTH values <10 pmol/mL indicate an ACTH-independent tumor.
• Equivocal ACTH values require additional testing.

Step 3. Localize the tumor
Pituitary imaging
80% of corticotrope adenomas are microadenomas, but MRI localizes
these tumors in only 7 50% of cases (with 1.5 Tesla MRI technology).

<5 mm), patients with very small tumors or undetectable adenomas on

CHAPTER 18

Cushing’s disease

MRI should undergo an inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) for deﬁnitive diagnosis of Cushing’s disease.
Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (Fig 18.2)
2 IPSS is the single best test to distinguish Cushing’s disease from ectopic
CS, with a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of >95%. Comparatively, the 8 mg DST
and CRH stimulation tests are inferior diagnostic tests.
• Bilateral IPSS involves the measurement of ACTH centrally and
peripherally, in the basal state and following stimulation with CRH (100
mcg IV). A basal central-to-peripheral ACTH ratio of >2:1 (or >3:1
stimulated, 5-15 minutes after CRH injection) is diagnostic of CD.
• Ideally, IPSS should be performed only in experienced centers.

INVESTIGATIONS

Abdominal and chest CT/MRI
These are indicated for suspected ectopic ACTH tumors and identify 7 75%
of tumors. Detection may be augmented by the complimentary use of functional studies, such as an octreotide scan or a positron emission tomography
(PET) scan.
Additional tests
• Serum potassium: Hypokalemia is found in >95% of patients with
ectopic, ACTH tumors but only 10% of patients with CD. Confounding
issues for hypokalemia, such as diuretic use must be excluded.
• High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (b see Pituitary function
testing, p. 92).
• Corticotropin-releasing hormone test (b see Pituitary function testing,
p. 92).
• Assess other pituitary hormones: Hypercortisolism suppresses the
thyroidal, gonadal and GH axes.
• Assess and treat hypercortisolemia-associated co-morbidities: impaired
glucose tolerance, diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and low bone
mineral density

121

122

CHAPTER 18

Cushing’s disease

Treatment
Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS)
b Also see Transsphenoidal surgery (p. 140).
This is the ﬁrst-line therapy in most Cushing’s disease cases. Selective
hypophysectomy is curative in up to 80–90% of microadenomas, and 750%
of macroadenomas.
A post-operative cortisol level of <2 mcg/dL is reassuring for shortterm remission, although long-term studies indicate a recurrence rate for
Cushing’s disease of approximately 15-20% at 5 years.

Medical therapies (see Table 18.1)
To date, there are no effective tumor-directed therapies for Cushing’s
disease. Most of the adrenal-directed therapies are ineffective at normalizing hypercortisolemia and have poor side-effect proﬁles. As such, medical
therapies are generally used as a temporizing measure (e.g., preoperatively
or during the latency period after radiation therapy).

Pituitary radiotherapy (see p. 147)
Radiation therapy is usually third-line treatment following incomplete surgical resection and inadequate medical therapies.
Control of hypersecretion is frequently delayed (e.g., fractionated radiation therapy controls hypercortisolemia in 750–60% of patients within 3–5
years).

Adrenalectomy
In ACTH-dependent Cushing’s, bilateral adrenalectomy is the treatment
of last resort, but may be indicated for patients with severe persistent
hypercortisolism and/or an unlocalizable ectopic ACTH tumor.
Nelson’s syndrome is caused by an enlargement of a pituitary adenoma
(often aggressively), and may occur in up to 30% of Cushing’s disease
patients who have undergone a bilateral adrenalectomy. These tumors are
associated with a marked increase in ACTH levels, hyperpigmentation and
mass effects. Monitoring should be performed annually with a basal ACTH
measurement and pituitary MRI (as indicated for signs and symptoms of
mass effects or a markedly elevated ACTH level). Transsphenoidal surgery
and radiation therapy are the main treatment options.

CHAPTER 18

Cushing’s disease

Follow-up
• After a successful transsphenoidal tumor resection, periodic
assessment of basal and stimulated cortisol levels are indicated to
monitor for recovery from central adrenal insufﬁciency (which is
typically prolonged [>1 year]).
• Monitor periodically for disease recurrence, particularly in patients
at high risk for CD recurrence (i.e., non-suppressed post-op cortisol
levels, rapid glucocorticoid taper, macroadenomas and/or failed
intraoperative adenoma detection).
• ACTH-secreting macroadenoma are generally not cured with TSS and
require subsequent radiation therapy ± medical therapies. In addition,
“silent” ACTH adenomas are among the most aggressive tumors with
730% recurrence rates.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Gonadotropinomas

Epidemiology
Gonadotropinomas are the most common non-functioning pituitary
tumors and account for 740–50% of all pituitary macroadenomas. They
are most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged men.

Pathology
• Gonadotropinomas synthesize but generally do not efﬁciently secrete
intact glycoprotein hormones (FSH, LH) or their free (A or B) subunits.
• Null cell tumors are deﬁned by the absence of immunoreactive
hormone expression and likely represent poorly differentiated
gonadotrope cells.

Clinical features
Mass effects

Headache
Visual ﬁeld defects (uni- or bitemporal quadrantanopia or hemianopia)
Ophthalmoplegia (III, IV and VI cranial nerve palsies)
Vision loss (optic nerve atrophy)
Cerebrospinal ﬂuid rhinorrhea (rarely)
Hypopituitarism. At diagnosis, > 50% of patients are growth hormone
and/or gonadotrope deﬁcient. Adrenal and thyroid insufﬁciencies are
less common (<30%).

Hormone effects
Rarely, gonadotropinomas can present with hormone hypersecretory syndromes, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, testicular enlargement or precocious puberty.

125

126

CHAPTER 19

Gonadotropinomas

Investigations
• Pituitary imaging: Usually presents as a macroadenoma on MRI/CT
• Visual ﬁelds assessment: Vision ﬁeld defects are observed in 760–70% of
patients.
• PRL: Mild hyperprolactinemia is common due to stalk compression.
0 Pituitary function: Gonadotropinomas rarely present with elevated
serum FSH, LH, and/or A-subunit levels, but may be confused with primary gonadal failure and or the postmenopausal state. Headaches, visual
ﬁeld disturbances and hypopituitarism are distinguishing features of a large
gonadotropinoma.

Management
Surgery
Transsphenoidal resection is the preferred therapy in most cases.

Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy is indicated for invasive or recurrent tumors, after
initial surgical resection, or for patients who are deemed poor surgical
candidates.
• Conventional fractionated or stereotactic radiotherapies are
effective at controlling tumor growth in (>80–90% of cases).
• XRT carries a long-term risk of hypopituitarism (750% at 5–10 years
with conventional XRT).

Medical treatment
Medical therapies, such as dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogs and
GnRH agonist/antagonists are ineffective for gonadotropinomas.
• Hormone replacement therapy is required for any hypopituitarism
(b see p. 98).

Follow-up and prognosis
• Surgical gross-total resection rates for gonadotropinomas are 760–70%,
with experienced neurosurgeons.
• Risk of tumor recurrence and growth are estimated at 75–10% at
5 years following gross-total resection of gonadotropinomas, and
20–50% at 10 years with subtotal resection.
• Most patients with gonadotropinomas lack a detectable serum
hormone marker (e.g., FSH/LH), so must be followed clinically and
radiographically (with MRIs).
• For patients with asymptomatic/residual tumors or microadenomas,
a watchful waiting approach with annual imaging is recommended
Consideration should be given to repeat TSS, or XRT, for evidence of
signiﬁcant interval tumor growth.

CHAPTER 20

Thyrotropinomas

Thyrotropinomas

Epidemiology
• Less than 2% of pituitary adenomas are thyrotropinomas (TSHsecreting).
• Female predominance-10:1,5:4.
• Thyrotropinomas are frequently misdiagnosed and treated as primary
hyperthyroidism.

Clinical features
• Hyperthyroidism (b see p. 17)
• Most thyrotropinomas are macroadenomas at the time of diagnosis
and present with mass effects, including headaches (20%), vision
defects (25%) and hypopituitarism (50%).
• Goiter is common at presentation.

Differential diagnosis of elevated free T4 /T3 and nonsuppressed TSH
• TSH-secreting tumor
• Thyroid hormone resistance
• Inherited abnormalities of thyroid-binding globulin proteins

Investigations
• Elevated Free T4 and T3 levels with an inappropriately normal or
elevated TSH level
• Elevated glycoprotein hormone A-subunit/TSH molar ratio
• PRL and/or GH may be elevated in mixed tumors (725%).
• Elevated sex hormone binding globulins (hyperthyroid effect)
• Failed suppression of TSH with T3 (80–100 mcg x 8–10 days) with
TSH-secreting tumor
• Pituitary imaging MRI

Management
Surgery
• First-line therapy, with >80% cure rates for microadenomas and 750%
cure rates for macroadenomas

MANAGEMENT

Medical therapies
Somatostatin analogs
b See Medical therapies for pituitary tumors (p. 144).
• Somatostatin analogs, including octreotide LAR and lanreotide, are
second-line therapy after failed or incomplete surgical resection.
• Normalizes TSH secretion in >80% of patients and decreases tumor
size in 740–50% of patients.
Antithyroid medications
• Short-term use only, for preoperative normalization of thyroid
hormone levels. Long-standing use has potential adverse effects of
tumor growth.
• B-blockers as needed for symptomatic hyperthyroidism.
Radiotherapy
Radiation therapy is used as adjuvant therapy following incomplete surgical
resection or inadequate medical response.

CHAPTER 21

Craniopharyngiomas & Rathke’s cleft cysts

Craniopharyngiomas and
Rathke’s cleft cysts

Craniopharyngiomas
Epidemiology
Craniopharyngiomas comprise 72–5% of all intracranial tumors and 710% of
all intracranial tumors in children. There is an equal gender prevalence, and
a bimodal distribution, with peaks at ages 5–14 years and 50–74 years.

Pathology
Tumors arise from squamous epithelial remnants of Rathke’s pouch.
Histological classiﬁcation includes two sub-types:
• Adamantinomatous—predominantly affects the young. Calciﬁcations
are common.
• Papillary—adult predominance. Calciﬁcations are rare.
2 Although craniopharyngiomas are benign tumors, they are biologically
aggressive tumors which have a proclivity to invade and adhere to critical
neurovascular structures (i.e., the hypothalamus and the third ventricle).

Clinical features
• Mass effects: headaches, vision loss or visual ﬁeld deﬁcits, cranial nerve
palsies and obstructive hydrocephalus (in children)
• Pituitary disturbances:
• Children commonly present with growth failure and delayed
puberty.
• Adults commonly present with hypopituitarism.
• DI occurs in 715–20% of cases.
• Hypothalamic syndrome: hyperphagia, severe obesity, cognitive
impairment, thirst and water/electrolyte imbalances, temperature
dysregulation and sleep disturbances.

FOLLOW-UP

Investigations
•
•
•
•

MRI/CT (CT better depicts boney erosions and calciﬁcations)
Visual ﬁeld testing
Anterior and posterior pituitary assessment
Neuropsychological testing (particularly in children)

Management
• Surgical resection is ﬁrst-line therapy for most cases. The surgical
approach (transfrontal vs. transsphenoidal) is dependent on the tumor
size and suprasellar extension.
• Gross-total resection is feasible only for relatively small tumors with a
predominantly intrasellar location.
• Subtotal resection, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy, is preferred
over aggressive resection to minimize the potentially devastating
effects of hypothalamic damage (see Hypothalamic syndrome,
p. 130).
• Craniopharyngiomas are radiosensitive, and therefore radiation
therapy is indicated for residual disease, recurrent tumor growth, or
for patients who are deemed poor surgical candidates.
• Data regarding additional adjuvant therapies, including: intracavitary
irradiation (brachytherapy), bleomycin and systemic chemotherapy are
limited.
• Restoration of pituitary hormone deﬁciencies is unlikely following
surgery, and the need for lifelong pituitary hormone replacement is
common.

Follow-up
• Craniopharyngiomas have a high recurrence rate following surgery
(730% at 10 years), with most occurring in the ﬁrst 3 years. Radiation
therapy is very effective at constraining tumor growth.
• The recommended frequency of clinical evaluation, imaging and
anterior pituitary hormone assessment depends on the disease
status. In general, imaging is recommended initially at 6- to 12-month
intervals.
• Patients who have received radiotherapy should undergone
pituitary hormone testing biannually in anticipation of developing
hypopituitarism. For patients on a stable pituitary hormone regimen,
annual testing is usually sufﬁcient.

131

132

CHAPTER 21

Craniopharyngiomas & Rathke’s cleft cysts

Rathke’s cleft cysts (RCC)
Epidemiology
Rathke’s cleft cysts account for 71% of primary intracranial tumors. There
is a female predominance (2:1 5:4), and the mean age at presentation is
738 years.

Pathology
RCCs are derived from the remnants of Rathke’s pouch and are lined by
epithelial cells (ciliated cuboidal/columnar epithelium). Squamous metaplasia is associated with a higher risk of RCC recurrence.

Clinical features
• RCCs are usually asymptomatic
• Large cysts (>1 cm) can be associated with mass effects, including
headaches (765–85%) and vision problems (720–40%).
• Rarely, RCCs are associated with apoplexy (see b Apoplexy, p. 95).
• Pituitary dysfunction, with large cysts occurs in 30–60% of cases,
with hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism being the most common
abnormalities. DI is uncommon.

Investigations
MRIs with variable signals characteristics are observed, depending on the
cyst content (see b Imaging, p. 88). RCCs may be indistinguishable from
cystic adenomas or cystic craniopharyngiomas.

Management
• Transsphenoidal surgery is recommended for RCCs associated with
mass effects (i.e., headaches or vision defects or pituitary hormone
insufﬁciency).
• Conservative decompression (cyst drainage and cyst wall biopsy) is
preferred over aggressive cyst wall resection to minimize the risk of
DI and hypopituitarism.
• Transsphenoidal surgery results in >80% symptomatic improvements
in headaches and vision defects and with low complication rates
(see b Transsphenoidal surgery, p. 140).
• Hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadism commonly normalize after
surgery whereas other pre-existing pituitary hormone abnormalities
less commonly improve.

FOLLOW-UP

Follow-up
Recurrence rates for RCC vary by surgical procedure, deﬁnition of recurrence, and length of follow-up, but are generally low (<10% symptomatic
recurrence rates at 5 years) at experienced neurosurgery centers.

Parasellar tumors

Parasellar tumors
See b Table 15.1, Lesions of the sellar turcica and parasellar region
(p. 101).

Meningiomas
Most common benign tumors of the sellar region, after adenomas
Peak incidence between the ages of 40–70 years
Strongly associated with previous radiation therapy
Usually present with vision disturbances and occasionally with pituitary
dysfunction
• Enhancing “dural tail” on contrasted T1 MRI is highly characteristic of
this tumor type.
• Management is surgical, when possible, and/or radiation therapy for
persistent or recurrent tumors.
• Rarely transforms to malignant tumors (poor prognosis)

•
•
•
•

Germ cell tumor (GCT)
• Malignant tumors that most commonly present in the ﬁrst two
decades of life
• GCTs are classiﬁed as germinomas or nongerminomatous.
• Most develop around the third ventricle (80% in the region of the
pineal gland), followed by suprasellar/hypothalamic locations.
• For pineal gland involvement and treatment, see b Pineal gland
(p. 161).
• Suprasellar GCT typically presents with DI, hypopituitarism and vision
disturbances.
• Diagnosis is based on histological conﬁrmation (gold standard) or
elevated tumor markers (B-hCG, A-fetoprotein in germinomas) and
imaging characteristics.
• A multimodal treatment approach, from among surgical resection,
radiation therapy and chemotherapy, is used depending on tumor type
and stage.

Gangliocytomas
• Neuroepithelial tumors comprised of ganglion cells either alone
(gangliocytoma) or in combination with glial cells (ganglioglioma)
• Frequently found in association with hormonally active pituitary
adenomas, particularly growth hormone tumors
• Surgical resection is usually ﬁrst-line therapy.

METASTATIC TUMORS TO THE PITUITARY

Chordomas/condrosarcomas
• Cartilaginous tumors originating from the primitive notochord.
• Incidence: chordomas > chondrosarcomas
• Both tumors are locally aggressive and cause extensive boney
destruction.
• Clinically, patients most commonly present with vision complaints
(diplopia) and headaches.
• The preferred treatment is surgical resection followed by radiotherapy
in most cases.

Hamartomas
• Hypothalamic hamartomas are congenital, neuronal-derived
heterotopic tumors.
• They typically present in childhood with seizures—commonly gelastic
(laughing).
• They may release GnRH, leading to precocious puberty, or very rarely
secrete GHRH, leading to gigantism
• Treatment consists of surgical resection and medical therapies when
indicated by harmonl hypersecretion (see b,p. 214).

Metastatic tumors to the pituitary
• Most commonly includes colon, lung and breast cancers (in 2/3 of the
cases).
• Typically these tumors present in the sixth to seventh decades of life
as part of widespread metastatic disease.
• DI is common (>70% of cases) and is a distinguishing characteristic.
• Mass effects and hypopituitarism are less commonly observed (<30%).
• Treatment is mainly palliative. Surgical debulking and radiation therapy
are rarely indicated for pituitary mass effects.
• Pituitary hormone replacement, particularly dDAVP, glucocorticoids
and thyroid hormone, as indicated for these deﬁciencies.

Background
Inﬂammatory, inﬁltrative and granulomatous diseases of the hypothalamus and pituitary gland are uncommon but should be considered in cases
of systemic illnesses that are associated with pituitary enlargement, mass
effects (e.g., headaches, vision disturbances) and neurogenic diabetes
insipidus.

• Idiopathic—giant cell
• Infectious—tuberculosis (TB)
• Systemic granulomatous disease
• Sarcoidosis
• Wegner’s granulomatosis
• Systemic histiocytosis
• Langerhan’s cell histiocytosis
• Erdheim–Chester disease
Infectious disease (e.g., viral, fungal, syphilis)

LYMPHOCYTIC HYPOPHYSITIS

Investigations
Inﬂammatory lesions typically appear as an enlarged pituitary gland and
stalk and may mimic a pituitary mass. In contrast to adenomas, however, these lesions typically show marked enhancement on contrasted
T1-weighted MRI images. Biopsy of the pituitary lesion, by a transsphenoidal approach, may be indicated for a deﬁnitive diagnosis.

Lymphocytic hypophysitis
Lymphocytic hypophysitis is a disease characterized by lymphocytic inﬁltration of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland and is an autoimmune
(T cell–mediated) process.
• It varies between focal (adenohypophysitis) and diffuse
(panhypophysitis) processes.
• Lymphocytic hypophysitis is associated with other autoimmune
conditions (e.g., Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, Addison’s disease, pernicious
anemia) in >30% of cases.
• Anti-pituitary antibodies, although variably present, are not sensitive or
speciﬁc markers.

Clinical presentation
LAH is associated with pregnancy (last trimester and within 1 year postpartum) in 770–80% of cases. LINH has an equal gender distribution.
• Mass effects; headaches (60%) and visual disturbances (40%)
• 1 Hypopituitarism-ACTH and TSH deﬁciencies are slightly more
common (60–65%), than gonadotropin and GH deﬁciencies (40–54%)
• PRL levels are variable: frequently elevated with mass effects (20–40%),
or may be low with a destructive/inﬁltrative process.
• DI is common with neurohypophyseal involvement (e.g., LINH, LPH).

Treatment
An empiric trial of pharmacological glucocorticoids, early in the disease
process (<6 months), has been advocated in the setting of mass effects
and progressive pituitary dysfunction, although data are limited regarding
its true beneﬁt relative to the diseases’ natural history.
• Transsphenoidal surgery is sometimes indicated for diagnostic
conﬁrmation and mass effects.
• Adjuvant therapies such as other immunosuppressive agents (e.g.,
azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine A) and radiation therapy
have been tried in selective cases and with variable success.

Pathology
Histopathology is the gold standard for the diagnosis and shows a lymphocytic inﬁltration of T cells, particularly CD4 cells.

Natural history
Outcomes vary between spontaneous resolution and normal pituitary gland function to progressive pituitary gland ﬁbrosis and permanent
hypopituitarism.

CHAPTER 23

Inﬂammatory & inﬁltrative pituitary diseases

Sarcoidosis
Sarcoidosis is a chronic, multisystem disease of unknown etiology that is
characterized by the presence of granulomas.

Clinical features
• Sarcoidosis affects young and middle-aged adults most commonly and
has an equal gender prevalence.
• Most cases have multivisceral (e.g., lungs, cardiac, sinonasal, eye, skin)
involvement at the time of diagnosis.
• Isolated CNS disease occurs in 75% of cases and can involve the
hypothalamus, pituitary gland, cranial nerves and leptomeninges.
• Hypopituitarism is common, including gonadotrope deﬁciencies,
hyperprolactinemia and diabetes insipidus as early manifestations.
• Hypothalamic involvement may also manifest with disturbances in
sleep, thirst (primary polydipsia/adipsia), appetite and temperature
regulation.

Investigations
Serum and CSF angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels may be elevated, although these tests are not sensitive or speciﬁc for neurosarcoidosis. MRI ﬁndings are as described earlier under Investigations (see p. 137).
In addition, MRI may demonstrate meningeal enhancement.

Management
Glucocorticoid therapy is the mainstay of treatment.
• Pharmacological doses of glucocorticoid (e.g., 1 mg/kg/day prednisone
for 2–4 weeks) are recommended for initial treatment. Subsequent
steroid dosage and duration are dependent on the disease response
and severity.
• Adjuvant therapies, including azathioprine, methotrexate, inﬂiximab,
and radiation therapy, have been tried in selective cases and with
variable success.

Natural history
The disease course varies from monophasic (66% of cases) to relapsing/
remitting to progressive disease. Glucocorticoid therapy generally does
not reverse the hormonal deﬁciencies.

HEMOCHROMATOSIS

Langerhans’ cell histiocytosis
This rare, multisystemic disease is characterized by aberrant proliferation
of dendritic cells (called Langerhan’s cells).

Clinical features and treatment
• Incidence is 3–5 cases per million.
• Most cases occur in children; up to 50% manifest with pituitary disease,
with DI and growth hormone deﬁciencies being the most common
abnormalities.
• In adults, diffuse disease (e.g., skin, bone, lung) is usually present at the
time of diagnosis and is associated with a 20% mortality rate.
• Standard Langerhan’s-directed therapy of vinblastine and steroids does
not reverse pituitary hormone deﬁciencies.

Hemochromatosis
This disorder is characterized by increased iron absorption and multi-organ deposition, including the heart, liver, pancreas and the pituitary gland.

Clinical features and treatment
• Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is the most common pituitary
manifestation of hemochromatosis and reﬂects a predilection for iron
deposition in gonadotrope cells.
• MRI may show decreased T1 and T2 signaling from paramagnetic iron
deposition.
• Phlebotomy is the mainstay of treatment and may reverse the pituitary
dysfunction, although long-term sex steroid replacement is frequently
required.

CHAPTER 24

Surgical treatment of pituitary tumors

Surgical treatment of
pituitary tumors

Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS)
Minimally-invasive, endonasal TSS is the preferred approach, for pituitary
tumors, and accounts for 795% of pituitary surgeries. See Box 24.1 for
indications. Compared to craniotomy, TSS has the following advantages:
• Reduced associated morbidity and mortality
• Better visualization of small tumors
• Reduced duration of hospital stay

Preoperative management
• Optimize medical comorbidities.
• In apoplexy, correct ﬂuid, electrolyte and hormone deﬁciencies
(as indicated), with an emphasis on glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone
replacement.
• In macroadenomas, assess and treat hypopituitarism, particularly
glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone deﬁciencies as indicated.

Box 24.1 Indications for transsphenoidal surgery (TSS)
• Nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (usually macroadenomas)
• Gonadotropinomas
• Null cell adenomas
• Functioning pituitary adenomas
• GH-secreting adenoma
• ACTH-secreting tumor
• Prolactinoma—if patient is dopamine agonist resistant or
intolerant
• TSH-secreting adenoma
• Nelson’s syndrome
• Pituitary apoplexy
• Recurrent pituitary tumors
• Parasellar tumors
• Craniopharyngioma
• Rathke’s cleft cyst
• Chordoma
• Arachnoid cyst
• Pituitary biopsy for deﬁnitive diagnosis (e.g., hypophysitis, pituitary
metastases)

TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY (TSS)

• Discontinue antiplatelet therapies and substitute anticoagulants as needed.
• Consider preoperative medical treatment for severe Cushing’s disease.
• Consider medical treatment of acromegalic patients with signiﬁcant
preoperative comorbidities (e.g., congestive heart failure [CHF], OSA).
• Establish euthyroid status for thyrotropinomas associated with
hyperthyroidism.

Perioperative management
• Prophylactic antibiotics are given perioperatively to reduce the risk of
meningitis.
• Immediate postoperative issues include monitoring for DI and neuroophthalmalogic complications.
2 Patients with Cushing’s disease require peri- and postoperative glucocorticoid treatment because of persistent secondary adrenal insufﬁciency
with successful tumor resection (see b, Cushing’s disease, p. 116).
• DVT prophylaxis is necessary for Cushing’s patients because
hypercortisolism induces a hypercoagulable state.

Complications of transsphenoidal surgery (see Table 24.1)
• The complication risks are highly dependent on the neurosurgeon and
correlate inversely with TSS experience.
• For experienced neurosurgeons (>200 transsphenoidal surgeries),
mortality rates are low (<1%).
• Morbidity related to ﬂuid and electrolyte balances, such as DI,
complicates an estimated 10–15% of transsphenoidal surgeries, but is
usually transient.

CHAPTER 24

Surgical treatment of pituitary tumors

• Newer surgical techniques such as computerized navigation,
endoscopy, and intraoperative imaging are used in selected cases and
centers, although they are still not widely available.

Postoperative management
• Clinical evaluation on postoperative days 14, to assess for symptomatic
improvement and to exclude complications (e.g., hyponatremia and
sinusitis).
• Pituitary hormone function is preserved in most patients with
preoperative normal function and may improve in 730% of patients
with pre-operative hypoprturtarism. This percentage is likely higher
with an experienced neurosurgeon and for hypogonadism caused by
hyperprolactinemia-related stalk effects.
• Vision improves in >80% of patients following optic nerve
decompression but varies by disease duration and severity and may
take several months to fully recover.
• A postoperative MRI and pituitary hormone testing (basal ± dynamic)
are recommended at 3-month initially, and then annually for the ﬁrst
ﬁve years.

Box 24.2 Postoperative disorders of ﬂuid balance
• Acute and transient DI
• Hyponatremia from excessive hypotonic ﬂuid administration or
SIADH
• Permanent DI “classic triphasic DI response:” initial DI due to
axon shock (hours–days) followed by antidiuretic phase due to
uncontrolled release of ADH from damaged posterior pituitary
(2–14 days) followed by DI due to depletion of ADH. Permanent DI
complicates <2% of TSS.
• Isolated SIADH phase, delayed hyponatremia at 7–10 days
postoperative, usually mild and self-limiting. More common in the
elderly population.

TRANSFRONTAL CRANIOTOMY

Transfrontal craniotomy
Indications
Craniotomy is often the preferred surgical approach for a giant pituitary
tumor (>4 cm) or a purely suprasellar location (e.g., craniopharyngiomas,
meningiomas).

Complications (see Table 24.1)
Craniotomy has higher complication rates than does TSS. The potential
complications are as listed for TSS (Box 24.1), and include the following:
• Brain retraction may lead to cerebral edema or hemorrhage.
• Manipulation of the optic chiasm may lead to visual deterioration.
• Damage to the olfactory nerve.

Perioperative management
• Recovery is typically slower than after transsphenoidal surgery.
• Prophylactic anticonvulsants are commonly used.
• Patients are typically given dexamethasone over 1–2 weeks to
minimize the risk of brain edema.

CHAPTER 25

Medical treatment of pituitary tumors

Medical treatment of
pituitary tumors

Dopamine agonists (DA)
For indications for use see Prolactinomas (p. 107) and Acromegaly (p. 114).

DA formulations/doses
• Bromocriptine (Parlodel): short-acting, non-ergot derivative.
Usually administered orally, twice daily. Therapeutic daily dose for
prolactinomas ranges between 5.0 and 30 mg; usual dose is 10 mg
a day. Bromocriptine is the preferred medication in women seeking
fertility because of the greater safety data during pregnancy.
• Cabergoline (Dostinex): long-acting ergot derivative. Usually
administered twice a week. The usual therapeutic dose is 1.0 mg a week.
• Better side-effect proﬁle and more efﬁcacious than bromocriptine
• Pergolide (Permax): no longer available in the United States

Mechanism of action
DAs activate D2 receptors, which are coupled to inhibitory G proteins,
and decrease cAMP production.

Side effects
Side effects, particularly with bromocriptine, may be minimized by starting
a low dose (e.g., 1.25 mg/day), and titrating up slowing. In females, vaginal
administration can be tried if GI intolerance is dose limiting.
Common side effects (>10%)
• Nausea
• Fatigue
• Headache
Less common side effects (<10%)
• Postural hypotension, dizziness, nasal stufﬁness, constipation and a
Raynaud-like phenomenon in the hands.
• Very rarely, patients develop hallucinations and psychosis (usually at
higher doses).
Uncommon side effects
The problems of cardiac valvulopathy, as noted in Parkinson’s patients on
high-dose cabergoline (>3 mg/day), is uncommon in prolactinoma patients
on standard cabergoline doses (< 2 mg/week).

SOMATOSTATIN ANALOGS

Somatostatin analogs
Box 25.1 Uses of somatostatin analogs
•
•
•
•

Acromegaly
Carcinoid tumors
Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
TSH-secreting pituitary tumors

Indications for use
See Acromegaly (p. 114).

Mechanism of action
• Analogs of the naturally-occurring GH inhibitor somatostatin, but with
increased serum half-lives and higher somatostatin receptor afﬁnities.
• The somatostatin analogs signal predominantly through somatostatin
receptors subtypes 2 and 5.

Formulations/doses
• Octreotide LAR® (Sandostatin LAR) (10–30 mg intramuscular [IM])
administered every 4–6 weeks
• Lanreotide Autogel® (Somatuline) (60–120 mg deep subcutaneous
[SC]) administered every 4–6 weeks
• SC octreotide (50–200 mcg) administered 3 × daily.
• Lanreotide SR (30 mg IM) administered every 7–14 days.

Side effects
• Gallstones or sludge develops in 720–30% of patients, but only 1%/year
develop symptomatic cholecystitis.
• Abdominal cramps, bloating and mild steatorrhea, due to inhibition
of motor activity and pancreatic enzymes secretion, commonly occur
early in treatment, although symptoms usually improve, or resolve,
over the ﬁrst few months.
• Transient worsening of diabetes (from inhibition of B-cell function).
• Injection site pain is minimized by allowing the medication to warm to
room temperature before administration.
• Hair loss (<10%)

Issues
• The long-acting somatostatin analogs have similar efﬁcacies and sideeffect proﬁles.
• The need for dose titrations should be assessed at 3 month intervals,
based on the IGF-1 levels.
• IGF-1 levels, but not GH-OGTT suppression tests, are recommended
to monitor the therapeutic response to somatostatin analogs in
acromegaly.

145

146

CHAPTER 25

Medical treatment of pituitary tumors

Growth hormone receptor antagonists
Indications for use include medical therapy for acromegalic patients who
are incompletely responsive to, or intolerant of, somatostatin analogs.

Mechanism of action
• Mutated GH molecule that binds to peripheral GH receptors
(predominantly on the liver) and blocks GH receptor signaling

Formulations and doses
• Pegvisomant (Somavert) 40 mg SC loading dose, followed by 10–40 mg
SC administered daily

Side effects
• Abnormal liver function tests (transaminitis), in 75%, but are usually
transient
• Injection site reactions (i.e., atopic reactions or lipohypertrophy)

Issues
• High cost
• Successful weekly and biweekly administrations of pegvisomant have
been reported, based on its long half-life (70 hours).
2 Therapeutic response is assessed by IGF-1 levels only (GH levels are
elevated on GH antagonist therapy).
• The need for dose titrations should be assessed at 73-month intervals.
• Medication has no effect on tumor size. MRI of the pituitary is
indicated 6 months after starting therapy and then annually thereafter.
Long-term studies indicate a low risk for tumor growth (<5 % over
5 years).
• Pegvisomant can be given concomitantly with somatostatin analogs to
control GH hypersecretion.

TECHNIQUES

Pituitary radiotherapy

Background
Pituitary radiotherapy is used to control pituitary tumor growth and excess
hormone secretion for patients with residual or recurrent tumors that are
not adequately treated by surgical and medical approaches.

Techniques
Conventional external beam radiation
A three-ﬁeld crossﬁre technique is used to deliver ionizing irradiation.
The standard 45–50 Gy dose is delivered in 25 fractions (72 Gy/day)
over 75–6 weeks.

Stereotactic radiation therapy (see Box 26.1)
This therapy represents improved immobilization, radiation beam focusing
and imaging techniques. Stereotactic irradiation can be given as a singlefraction radiosurgery (SRS) or delivered as fractionated doses. SRS is limited to relatively smaller tumors with tumor margins that are >5 mm from
the optic apparatus.

Box 26.1 Stereotactic forms of radiotherapy
• Gamma knife: ionizing radiation from a cobalt 60 source delivered by
convergent collimated beams
• LINAC: delivers photons via a linear accelerator and frequently
incorporates a cyberknife.
• Proton beam: utilizes heavy-charge particle proton beams, produced
by a cyccotron but has limited availability in the U.S.
• Cyber knife: a frameless, robotic radiosurgery delivery system

147

148

CHAPTER 26

Pituitary radiotherapy

Efﬁcacy
• Radiotherapy is effective and rapid in controlling pituitary adenoma
growth, with progression-free survivals of 80–90% at 10 years.
• Effects of radiation therapy on normalizing hormone hypersecretion
are delayed. For example, normalization of GH/IGF-1 levels is
observed in 730–50% of acromegalic patients at 75–10 years after
conventional radiation therapy.
• Stereotactic techniques have the theoretical advantage, over
conventional radiation therapy, of decreased complication rates
(i.e., hypopituitarism), and a more rapid normalization of hormone
hypersecretion, although this is still a controversial area.
• To potentially optimize treatment efﬁcacy, consideration should
be given to the temporary discontinuation of pituitary-directed
medications, such as somatostatin analogs (for at least 1 month) prior
to radiation therapy.

Hypopituitarism
• Anterior pituitary hormone deﬁciency is the most common late
complication of radiation therapy, and occurs in 30–60% of patients
710 years after conventional radiation (Fig. 26.1).
• The loss of anterior pituitary hormones, after radiation therapy, generally
develops in a predictable order: GH 7 FSH/LH >> ACTH 7 TSH
• Posterior pituitary deﬁciencies are rare after XRT.
• Expectant management is recommended for hypopituitarism with
biannual pituitary hormone testing to include basal ACTH, cortisol, free
T4, IGF-1, testosterone (in males), and estradiol (in females). Cosyntropin
stimulation test is indicted for an equivocal A.M. cortisol value.

CHAPTER 26

Pituitary radiotherapy

Visual impairment
The optic chiasm is radiosensitive, whereas cranial nerves are generally
radioresistant. The risk of vision impairment is related to the total administered dose and the dose per fraction (highest with SRS). A standard total
dose of 4500 cGy (and a daily dose of 180 cGy in conventional radiation)
poses very little risk to the optic chiasm (<1% risk of blindness).

Long-term radiation complications
• Radiation is associated with the development of secondary brain
tumors, particularly meningiomas and gliomas, with an estimated risk
of 2.4% at 20 years.
• The effects of pituitary radiation on long-term neuro-cognitive and
neuro-psychological function are not well deﬁned.
XIncreased cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality rates have been
reported with conventional radiation treatment of pituitary adenomas,
although the relative contribution of radiation to stroke risk remains to
be determined.

• Inﬁltrating lesions—sarcoidosis, amylodosis
• Chronic renal disease
• Sickle cell anemia
Dipsogenic
• Psychogenic polydipsia
• Hypothalamic diseases—similar lesions as in neurogenic DI

Features
• Clinical presentation
•Adults-polyuria, polydipsia and nocturia
•Children-polyuria, polydipsia, enuresis and failure to thrive.
• Rapid dehydration and hypernatremia can occur if the patient does not
have access to water or has impaired thirst mechanisms.
• Transient DI complicates an estimated 10–15% of pituitary surgeries,
although permanent DI is uncommon (requires the destruction of
>90% of AVP neurons).
• Pregnancy results in increased AVP metabolism from placental
vasopressinase, but is generally not clinically relevant.
2 Neurogenic DI may be masked by cortisol deﬁciency and uncovered by
the administration of glucocorticoids.

INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations
Diagnosis of DI
• Conﬁrm large urine output (>40 mL/kg/day in adults) with a 24-hour
urine collection.
• Exclude diabetes mellitus and renal failure (osmotic diuresis).
• Exclude hypokalemia and hypercalcemia (nephrogenic DI).
• Consider water deprivation test (see Box 27.2)
• Pituitary MRI is recommended for suspected neurogenic DI.

Box 27.2 Water deprivation test
1. The patient is water deprived in a monitored setting for 78 hours.
2 Urine output and osmolality are monitored hourly, and plasma
sodium and osmolality are measured every 2 hours.
3 The test is stopped when one of the following parameters is met:
a. Urine osmolality is normal (>600 mOsm/kg), thereby excluding DI.
b.. The plasma osmolality or sodium values become clearly
elevated.
c.. The urine osmolality is stable (<10% change) on three
consecutive readings.
4 A plasma sample is sent for ADH measurement and dDAVP is
administered (1–2 mcg SQ), followed by hourly measurements of
urinary volume and urine osmolality × 2.

154

CHAPTER 27

Diabetes insipidus (DI)

Treatment
Maintenance of adequate ﬂuid input
In patients with partial DI, mild polyuria and an intact thirst mechanism,
drug therapy may not be necessary.

Drug therapy
Neurogenic DI
• Arginine vasopressin (Pitressin): short half-life and vasopressor effect
when administered intravenously limits its general utility.
• Desmopressin (1-deamino-8-D-arginine-vasopressin)
• Vasopressin analog, acts predominantly on the V2 receptors in the
kidney, and has the following advantages: longer half-life than the
native hormone, increased antidiuretic efﬁcacy, and no vasopressor
(V1 receptor) activity.
• In the hospital setting: 1–2 mcg parenteral (SQ, IM, or IV)
administration is preferred.
• Chronic administration: intranasal spray use is preferable (10–40
mcg/day in divided doses) or oral tablets (50–1200 mg/day).
Additional medications can be used to augment ADH release or actions
(e.g., chlorpropamide, carbamazepine, cloﬁbrate, NSAIDs), but these are
less efﬁcacious than dDAVP and may cause adverse side effects.
Nephrogenic DI
• Correct underlying causes and discontinue offending drug when
possible.
• Low-sodium/protein diets
• Thiazide diuretic
• Amiloride (for lithium-induced DI)
• NSAIDs
Dipsogenic
Management is often difﬁcult. Treat any underlying tumor or psychiatric
disorder, when possible.

CAVEATS FOR WATER DEPRIVATION STUDY

Caveats for water deprivation study
• Differentiating between partial neurogenic/nephrogenic DI and
psychogenic polydipsia is best done by comparing the plasma
AVP level with urinary and plasma osmolalities (using established
nomograms) during a hyperosmotic state.
• Chronic psychogenic polydipsia may result in reduced urineconcentrating ability because of medullary solute washout.

Hyponatremia

Hyponatremia

Incidence
Hyponatermia is the most common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized
patients. Mild to moderate hyponatremia (sodium 126–135 mmol/L) and
severe hyponatremia (sodium <125 mmol/L) occur in 14% and 1% of hospitalized patients, respectively.

Etiologies

Salt deﬁciency
• Renal loss: salt wasting nephropathy—tubulointerstitial nephritis,
polycystic kidney disease, analgesic nephropathy, recovery phase
of acute tubular necrosis, cerebral salt wasting, mineralcorticoid
deﬁciencies
• Nonrenal loss: mucosal losses, burns, sweating, GI tract (bowel
sequestration, ﬁstulae, pancreatitis)

CHAPTER 28

Hyponatremia

Investigations
• Assess volume status
• Serum osmolality (normal in pseudohyponatremia from hyperlipidemia/paraproteinemia)
• Urine sodium level (spot)
• Other investigations as indicated (e.g., urine osmolality, cortisol,
thyroid function tests, renal/liver biochemistry and B-type natriuretic
peptide [BNP] levels).

Hyponatremia treatment
Hypovolemic hyponatremia
• Treat underlying condition (e.g., diarrhea, vomiting, nephropathy).
• IV normal saline and increased dietary salts

Traditional formula for calculating sodium deﬁcit
• Na+ required = Total Body Water (TBW) × Na(desired - current)
• TBW = lean body weight × 0.5 (females) and × 0.6 (males)
• Rate of Na+ normalization (mmol/h) varies by extent and acuity of
hyponatremia.
• Overly rapid correction of severe, chronic hyponatremia can lead to
osmotic demyelination syndrome.
• In general, limit the rise of plasma sodium concentration by <8–12
mmol/L in the ﬁrst 24 hours, and <18–24 mmol/L in the ﬁrst 48 hours.

Euvolemic hyponatremia/SIADH
b See Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) (p. 159).

Hypervolemic hyponatremia
• Treatment of underlying disorder (e.g., CHF, liver disease)
• Diuretics
• Fluid restriction

Artifactual/pseudohyponatremia
Treat underlying disorder only (e.g., normalize hyperglycemia).

TYPES OF SIADH

Syndrome of inappropriate
ADH (SIADH)

Deﬁnition
SIADH is a syndrome of sustained AVP release or response in the absence
of appropriate hyperosmotic or hypovolemic stimuli.

Features
• SIADH clinically manifests with neurological symptoms from
hyponatremia caused by osmotic ﬂuid shifts and brain edema.
• Symptoms range from mild to severe depending on the extent of
hyponatremia and the rate of development (acute, <48 hours).
Symptoms include headaches, fatigue, anorexia, nausea, vomiting,
altered sensorium, seizure, coma, respiratory arrest and death.
• Mild chronic hyponatremia is common in the elderly because of
ineffective suppression of ADH.

Criteria for diagnosis
• Hyponatremia and hypotonic plasma (osmolality <275 mOsm/kg of
water)
• Inappropriate urine concentration (>100 mOsm/kg)
• Excessive renal sodium loss (>40 mmol/L), with normal salt intake and
exclusion of recent diuretic use
• Euvolemic status
• Normal renal, adrenal and thyroid function

Types of SIADH
• Type AI—erratic excess ADH secretion, unrelated to plasma
osmolality (most common)
• Type B—elevated basal secretion of AVP, despite normal regulation by
osmolality
• Type C—“reset osmostat,” AVP secretion at a lower serum osmolality
• Type D—low vasopressin secretion, possible vasopressin receptor defect

Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH)

Box 29.1 Causes of SIADH
Malignant diseases
• Small-cell lung carcinoma, thymoma, lymphoma, leukemia, sarcoma,
mesothelioma, GI/GU tumors
Pulmonary disorders
• Infections (pneumonia, tuberculosis, empyema)
• Pneumothorax
• Asthma
• Respiratory failure, positive pressure ventilation
CNS disorders
• Infections (meningitis, encephalitis, abscess)
• Vascular disorders (subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebrovascular
accident, traumatic brain injury, hydrocephalus)
• Other (multiple sclerosis, Guillain–Barre, Shy–Drager syndromes, HIV)
Drugs
• Chemotherapy (vincristine, vinblastine, cyclophosphamide)
• Psychiatric drugs (phenothiazines, SSRIs, TCAs)
• Other (carbamazepine, cloﬁbrate, chlorpropamide, nicotine,
narcotics, ‘ectasy’)
Metabolic
• Hypothyroidism
• Glucocorticoid deﬁciency
• Other (pain, stress, nausea, idiopathic)

Treatment
• Treat underlying cause.
• Fluid restriction to 500–1000 mL/24 hours
• Vasopressin antagonists (e.g., tolvaptan (oral route, V1 speciﬁc) and
Conivaptan (IV route, V1/V2 antagonism). Expense currently limits their
practical use in most cases
• Hypertonic saline (3% infusion) for severe symptomatic hyponatremia
(eg. seizures or altered mentation). It is important to limit the rate
of sodium correction to  8–12 mmol/L during the ﬁrst 24 hours
to avoid central pontine myelinolysis, particularly if hyponatremia is
chronic (>48 hours duration).

INVESTIGATIONS AND STAGING

Pineal gland

Physiology
The pineal gland lies behind the third ventricle and produces melatonin,
which is important for sleep and entraining some pituitary hormones to
light–dark cycles.

Pineal and intracranial germ cell
tumors
• Incidence: 0.5%–3% intracranial neoplasms
• Epidemiology: more common in children and in males
• Three most common pineal gland tumors: germ cell >> pineal
parenchymal > gliomas; 2/3 malignant and 1/3 benign
• Germ cell tumors are classiﬁed as germinomas or nongerminomatous.
• Pineal parenchymal tumors and gliomas have histological subtypes that
vary from low- to high-grade tumors.

Features
• Obstructive hydrocephalus: i intracranial pressure, headaches,
vomiting, ataxia and lethargy
• Parinaud’s syndrome (paralysis of upward gaze, convergent nystagmus,
Argyll–Robertson pupils)
• Vision disturbances (bitemporal hemianopsia)
• Hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction: hypopituitarism and DI
• Sexual precocity (if tumor secretes B-hCG which mimics LH)

CHAPTER 30

Pineal gland

Management
• Multimodal approach from among surgical resection, radiation therapy
and chemotherapy, depending on the tumor type and stage.
• Pure germinomas are very radiosensitive.

Prognosis
The prognosis is excellent for germinomas (90% 5-year survival), but is
less favorable for nongerminomatous germ cell tumors (60–70% 5-year
survival). Prognosis for pineal parenchymal tumors and gliomas, varies by
histological sub-type and disease extent, and trends with tumor grade.

Anatomy and physiology

Anatomy
The normal adrenal glands weigh 4–5 g. The cortex represents 90% of the
normal gland and surrounds the medulla. The arterial blood supply arises
from the renal arteries, aorta, and inferior phrenic artery. Venous drainage
occurs via the central vein into the inferior vena cava on the right, and into
the left renal vein on the left.

CHAPTER 31

Anatomy and physiology

Physiology
Glucocorticoids
Glucocorticoid (cortisol 10–20 mg/day) (Table 31.1) production occurs
from the zona fasciculata, and adrenal androgens arise form the zona
reticularis. Both of these are under control of ACTH, which regulates
both steroid synthesis and adrenocortical growth.

Mineralocorticoids
Mineralocorticoid (aldosterone 100–150 mcg/day) (Table 31.1) synthesis
occurs in zona glomerulosa predominantly under the control of the
renin–angiotensin system (b see Fig 31.2), although ACTH also
contributes to its regulation.

Androgens
The adrenal gland (zona reticularis and zona fasciculata) also produces
sex steroids, in the form of dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA) and
androstenedione. The synthetic pathway is under the control of ACTH.
Urinary steroid proﬁling provides quantitative information on the
biosynthetic and catabolic pathways. Proﬁling can be useful in the
following:
• Mineralocorticoid hypertension
• Polycystic ovary syndrome
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
• Steroid-producing tumors
• Precocious puberty and virilization
• Hirsutism

CHAPTER 32

Imaging

Imaging

Computed tomography (CT) scanning
CT is the most widely used modality for imaging the adrenal glands. It is
able to detect masses >5 mm in diameter. It can be useful in differentiating
between different adrenal cortical pathologies (Fig. 32.1).

Adrenal
adenoma

Adrenal

Fig. 32.1 Typical appearance of adrenal adenoma on CT scan.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
MRI can also reliably detect adrenal masses >5–10 mm in diameter and
in some circumstances provides additional information to CT data, e.g.,
differentiation of cortical from medullary tumors.

Ultrasound (US) imaging
US detects masses >20 mm in diameter, but normal adrenal glands are
not usually visible except in children. Body morphology and bowel gas can
provide technical difﬁculties.

VENOUS SAMPLING

Normal adrenal
Normal adrenal cortex is assessed by measuring limb thickness and
is considered enlarged at >5 mm, approximately the thickness of the
diaphragmatic crus nearby.

Radionucleotide imaging
123
Iodine-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG)
This is a guanethidine analog, concentrated in some pheochromocytomas,
paragangliomas, carcinoid tumors, and neuroblastomas, and is useful diagnostically. A different isotope, 131I-MIBG, may be used therapeutically, e.g., in
malignant pheochromocytomas when the diagnostic imaging shows uptake.
75

Se 6B-selenomethyl-19-norcholesterol
This isotope is concentrated in functioning steroid-synthesizing tissue and
is used to image the adrenal cortex. It can be used in determining whether
a nodule is functioning or not and can be helpful in localizing residual
adrenal tissue following failed bilateral adrenalectomy.
However, high-resolution CT and MRI have largely replaced it in localizing functional adrenal adenomas.

Positron emission tomography (PET)
PET can be useful in locating tumors and metastases. Radiopharmaceuticals
for speciﬁc endocrine tumors are being developed, e.g., [11C] metahydroxyephedrine for pheochromocytoma. Combined with CT (PET-CT) it
may offer particular value in localizing occult neuroendocrine tumors.

Venous sampling
Adrenal vein sampling can be useful to lateralize an adenoma or to
differentiate an adenoma from bilateral hyperplasia. It is technically
difﬁcult—particularly, catheterizing the right adrenal vein because of its
drainage into the IVC.
It may also be used to conﬁrm the diagnosis of bilateral pheochromocytoma. It is of particular value in lateralizing small aldosterone-producing
adenomas that cannot easily be visualized on CT or MRI.

CHAPTER 33

Mineralocorticoid excess

Mineralocorticoid excess
Deﬁnitions
Most cases of mineralocorticoid excess are due to excess aldosterone
production, which may be primary or secondary, and are typically associated with hypertension and hypokalemia.
Primary hyperaldosteronism is a disorder of autonomous aldosterone
hypersecretion with suppressed renin levels.
Secondary hyperaldosteronism occurs when aldosterone hypersecretion
occurs secondary to elevated circulating renin levels. This is typical of heart
failure, cirrhosis, or nephrotic syndrome, but can also be due to renal artery
stenosis and, occasionally, a very rare renin-producing tumor (reninoma).
Other mineralocorticoids may occasionally be the cause of this syndrome
(b see Box 33.1).

Box 33.1 Causes of mineralocorticoid excess
Primary hyperaldosteronism
• Conn’s syndrome (aldosterone-producing adrenal adenoma): 35%
• Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia: 60%
• Glucocorticoid remedial aldosteronism (GRA): <1%
• Aldosterone-producing adrenal carcinoma
Secondary hyperaldosteronism
• Renal artery stenosis
• Renal hypoperfusion
• Cirrhosis
• Congestive cardiac failure
• Nephrotic syndrome
• Renin-secreting tumor
Other mineralocorticoid excess syndromes
• Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (b see p. 182)
• Liquorice ingestion (p. 183) (inhibits II B HSOH) d aldosterone, d
renin, d K+ found in sweets, chewing tobacco, cough mixtures, and
herbal medicines
• Deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone (b see p. 183)
• Ectopic ACTH secretion (b see p. 183)
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (b see p. 239)
• Exogenous mineralocorticoids

CONN’S SYNDROME—ALDOSTERONE-PRODUCING ADENOMA

Primary aldosteronism

Epidemiology
Primary hyperaldosteronism is present in approximately 5% of hypertensive patients. The most common cause is bilateral adrenal hyperplasia
(b see Table 34.1).

Pathophysiology
Aldosterone causes renal sodium retention and potassium loss. This
results in expansion of body sodium content, leading to suppression of
renal renin synthesis.
The direct action of aldosterone on the distal nephron causes sodium
retention and loss of hydrogen and potassium ions, resulting in a hypokalemic alkalosis, although serum potassium may not be signiﬁcantly reduced
and may be normal in up to 50% of cases.
Aldosterone has pathophysiological effects on a range of other tissues, causing cardiac ﬁbrosis, vascular endothelial dysfunction, and
nephrosclerosis.

Clinical features
Moderately severe hypertension occurs, which is often resistant to
conventional therapy. There may be disproportionate left ventricular
hypertrophy.
Hypokalemia is usually asymptomatic. Occasionally, patients may present
with tetany, myopathy, polyuria, and nocturia (hypokalemic nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus) due to severe hypokalemia.

Conn’s syndrome—aldosteroneproducing adenoma
Very high levels of the enzyme aldosterone synthase are expressed in
tumor tissue. Although aldosterone production is autonomous, ACTH has
a greater stimulatory effect than angiotensin II (aldosterone often displays
a diurnal variation that mirrors that of cortisol), although a subtype that
remain more responsive to angiotensin II has been described.
Very rarely, Conn’s adenomas may be part of the MEN1 syndrome.

ALDOSTERONE-PRODUCING CARCINOMA

Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia
(bilateral idiopathic
hyperaldosteronism)
This is the most common form of primary hyperaldosteronism in adults.
Hyperplasia is more commonly bilateral than unilateral and may be
associated with micronodular or macronodular hyperplasia. However,
CT-demonstrable nodules have a prevalence of 2% in the general population, including hypertensive patients without excess aldosterone
production.
The pathophysiology is not known, although aldosterone secretion is
very sensitive to circulating angiotensin II. The pathophysiology of bilateral
adrenal hyperplasia is not understood; it is possible that it represents an
extreme end of the spectrum of low rennin-essential hypertension.

Glucocorticoid-remedial aldosteronism
(GRA)
This is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited condition due to the presence of a chimeric gene (8q22) containing the 5´ sequence that determines
regulation of the 11B-hydroxylase gene (CYP11B1) coding for the enzyme
catalyzing the last step in cortisol synthesis, and the 3´ sequence from the
aldosterone synthase gene (CYP11B2) coding for the enzyme catalyzing
the last step in aldosterone synthesis.
This results in expression of aldosterone synthase in the zona fasiculata as well as the zona glomerulosa, and aldosterone secretion becomes
under ACTH control. Glucocorticoids lead to suppression of ACTH and
suppression of aldosterone production.
• There is early hypertension and family history.
• Hybrid steroids (18OHcortisol and 18oxocortisol) are elevated.

Aldosterone-producing carcinoma
This is rare and usually associated with excessive secretion of other corticosteroids (cortisol, androgen, estrogen). Hypokalemia may be profound,
and aldosterone levels very high.

CHAPTER 34

Primary aldosteronism

Screening
Indications
• Patients resistant to conventional antihypertensive medication (i.e., not
controlled on three agents)
• Hypertension associated with hypokalemia (potassium < 3.7 mmol/L,
irrespective of thiazide use)
• Hypertension developing before 40 years of age
• Adrenal incidentaloma

Method
False-negative and false-positive results can occur if the test is not performed under controlled circumstances.
• Give oral supplements of potassium to control hypokalemia.
• Stop medication that can interfere with the test using appropriate
washout period (Table 34.2).
• Blood pressure (BP) can be controlled using doxazosin or verapamil
(rather than other calcium antagonists).
• Measure aldosterone/renin ratio.

SCREENING

A high ratio is suggestive of primary hyperaldosteronism (aldosterone
[ng/dL]/plasma renin activity [ng/mL/h] >30–50). Newer assays that measure renin mass (rather than activity) will require development of different
cutoffs. The greater the ratio, the more likely the diagnosis of primary
aldosteronism.
A false negative can occur in patients with chronic renal failure due to
an inappropriately high plasma renin activity.

175

176

CHAPTER 34

Primary aldosteronism

Conﬁrmation of diagnosis
Conﬁrmation of autonomous aldosterone production is made by demonstrating failure to suppress aldosterone in the face of sodium/volume
loading. This can be achieved through a number of mechanisms after optimizing test conditions as described.

Dietary sodium loading
Patients can be instructed to take a diet with high sodium content (sufﬁcient to raise the sodium intake to 200 mmol/day for 3 days. If necessary,
this can be achieved by adding supplemental sodium chloride tablets.
It is important to ensure that potassium is maintained during this period;
potassium supplementation may also be required. Failure to suppress
24-hour urinary aldosterone secretion at the end of this period is diagnostic of primary aldosteronism.

Saline infusion test
• Administer 2 L normal saline over 4 hours, preferably between
8 A.M. and noon.
• Measure plasma aldosterone at 0 and 4 hours.
• Aldosterone fails to suppresses to <7.5 ng/mL (7.5–10 equivocal) in
80–90% of primary aldosteronism.
Frequently, this test is followed by measurements of plasma rennin activity
(PRA) with upright posture and use of a diuretic (furosemide up to 80 mg).
Low PRA under these conditions supports the diagnosis.

Other testing
A number of tests have been described that are said to differentiate between
the various subtypes of primary aldosteronism (solitary Conn’s adenoma,
bilateral adrenal hyperplasia, GRA). However, none of these are sufﬁciently
speciﬁc to inﬂuence management decisions, and more speciﬁc investigations
(imaging and adrenal vein sampling) are necessary if there is doubt.
Additional tests, such as postural response of aldosterone and the basal
plasma 18-hydroxycorticosterone >100 ng/dL, are suggestive of primary
aldosteronism.
Diagnosis of GRA is best made using a speciﬁc genetic test rather than
on the ability of dexamethasone (0.5 mg q6h for 3 days) to suppress
aldosterone.

Other dynamic tests
If these tests are nondiagnostic, then it is usual to proceed to venous sampling
rather than dynamic testing. However, such tests can sometimes be helpful.

CONFIRMATION OF DIAGNOSIS

Captopril suppression test
• Plasma aldosterone is measured in the sitting position, basally, and
60 minutes after captopril 25 mg.
• Inhibition of angiotensin II leads to a fall in aldosterone in patients with
idiopathic hyperaldosteronism but not in Conn’s syndrome.
Fludrocortisone suppression test
• Give ﬂudrocortisone 100 mcg q6h for 4 days.
• Measure aldosterone basally and on last day.
• Aldosterone is suppressed in hyperplasia but unchanged in adenomas.

LOCALIZATION & CONFIRMATION OF DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS

Localization and conﬁrmation of
differential diagnosis
CT/MRI scan
CT and MRI scanning are of value in identifying adrenal adenomas. It
should be noted, however, that the frequency of adrenal incidentalomas
rises with age and, for this reason, it is prudent to consider adrenal vein
sampling in older patients (age >50) with primary aldosteronism who have
an apparent solitary adenoma on scanning.
• Identiﬁes most adenomas >5 mm diameter. Bilateral abnormalities or
tumors <1 cm in diameter require further localization procedures.
• In bilateral adrenal hyperplasi,a both glands can appear enlarged or
normal in size.
• Macronodular hyperplasia may result in identiﬁable nodules on
imaging.
• A mass >4 cm in size is suspicious of carcinoma but is unusual in
Conn’s syndrome.
• In essential hypertension, nodules are described.

Adrenal vein sampling
Aldosterone measurements from both adrenal veins allow a gradient
between the two sides to be identiﬁed in the case of unilateral disease. It
is the gold standard for differentiation between uni- and bilateral aldosterone production, but cannulating the right adrenal vein is technically
difﬁcult, as it drains directly into the inferior vena cava.
Cortisol measurements must also be taken concomitantly with aldosterone to conﬁrm successful positioning within the adrenal veins and should
be more than 3× a peripheral sample (central/peripheral ratio >3). The
aldosterone/cortisol ratio with an adenoma is >4.1.

Radiolabeled iodocholesterol scanning
This test has low sensitivity and speciﬁcity and offers no advantage over a

CHAPTER 34

Primary aldosteronism

Treatment
Surgery
Laparascopic adrenalectomy is the treatment of choice for aldosteronesecreting adenomas and is associated with lower morbidity than open
adrenalectomy.
Surgery is not indicated in patients with idiopathic hyperaldosteronism,
as even bilateral adrenalectomy may not cure the hypertension.
Presurgical spironolactone treatment may be used to correct potassium
stores before surgery.
The BP response to treatment with spironolactone (50–400 mg/day)
before surgery can be used to predict the response to surgery of patients
with adenomas.
Hypertension is cured in about 70% of patients. If it persists (more likely
in those with long-standing hypertension and increased age), it is more
amenable to medical treatment.
Overall, 50% become normotensive in 1 month and 70% within 1 year.

Medical treatment
Medical therapy remains an option for patients with a solitary adrenaladenoma who are unlikely to be cured by surgery, who are unﬁt for operation, or who express a preference for medical management.
The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone (50–400 mg/day) has
been used successfully for many years to treat the hypertension and
hypokalemia associated with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and idiopathic
hyperaldosteronism.
There may be a delay in response of hypertension of 4–8 weeks.
However, combination with other antihypertensive agents (ACE inhibitor
and calcium channel blockers) is usually required.
Side effects are common, particularly gynecomastia and impotence in
men, menstrual irregularities in women, and GI effects.
Eplerenone (50–100 mg/day) is a mineralocorticoid antagonist without
antiandrogen effects and greater selectivity than that of spironolactone.
Alternative drugs include the potassium-sparing diuretics amiloride and
triamterene. Amiloride may need to be given in high dose (up to 40 mg/day)
in primary aldosteronism, and monitoring of serum potassium is essential.
Calcium channel antagonists may also be helpful.
Glucocorticoid-remedial aldosteronism can be treated with low-dose
dexamethasone (0.5 mg on going to bed). Side effects often limit therapy,
and spironolactone or amiloride treatment is often preferred.
For adrenal carcinoma, surgery and postoperative adrenolytic
therapy with mitotane is usually required, but the prognosis is usually
poor (b see Treatment, p. 186).

CHAPTER 35

Excess other mineralocorticoids

Excess other
mineralocorticoids

Epidemiology
Occasionally, the clinical syndrome of hyperaldosteronism is not associated with excess aldosterone, and a process due to another mineralocorticoid is suspected. This can either be due to an increase in an alternative
mineralcorticoid or to i mineralocorticoid effect of cortisol. These conditions are rare.

Apparent mineralocorticoid excess
The aldosterone receptor has an equal afﬁnity for cortisol and aldosterone, but there is a 100-fold excess of circulating cortisol over aldosterone. The receptor is usually protected from the effects of stimulation by
cortisol by the 11B-hydroxysteroid type 2 dehydrogenase enzyme, which
converts cortisol to cortisone.
In this syndrome, there is deﬁciency of 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSD) enzyme type 2 encoded on chromosome 16q22. Congenital
absence (autosomal recessive) of the enzyme or inhibition of its activity
allows cortisol to stimulate the receptor and leads to severe hypertension.
Type 1 is seen predominantly in children, presenting with failure to
thrive, thirst, polyuria, and severe hypertension. Patients are not cushingoid as there is intact negative feedback, and circulating cortisol levels are
not raised. The urinary terahydrocortisol and allotetrahydrocortisol-toterahydrocortisone ratio is raised to 10 × normal.
Type 2 is a milder form that may be a cause of hypertension in adolescence or early adulthood. The urinary terahydrocortisol and allo-tetrahydrocortisol-to-terahydrocortisone ratio is normal.
However, multiple mutations have been found in the 11B-HSD2 gene
for both types, and some authors believe there is a spectrum of disease:
mild forms may present with salt-sensitive hypertension.

Biochemistry
Suppression of renin and aldosterone
Hypokalemic alkalosis
Urinary free cortisol-to-cortisone ratio i
Ratio of urinary tetrahydrocortisol and allotetrahydrocortisol to
tetrahydrocortisone is raised (>10 ×) in type 1 but is normal in type 2.

DEOXYCORTICOSTERONE (DOC) EXCESS

Treatment
Dexamethasone leads to suppression of ACTH secretion, reduced cortisol
concentrations, and lowered BP in 60%. It has a much lower afﬁnity for the
mineralocorticoid receptor.
Other antihypertensive agents are often required.
One patient with hypertensive renal failure was cured with a renal
transplant.

Licorice ingestion
Licorice contains glycyrrhetinic acid, which is used as a sweetener. It inhibits the action of 11B-HSD, making the aldosterone receptor more sensitive to cortisol.
It is found in candies, chewing tobacco, cough mixtures, and some
herbal medicines.

Ectopic ACTH syndrome
b See p. 184.
In the syndrome of ectopic ACTH, the 11B-HSD protection is overcome
because of high cortisol secretion rates, which saturate the enzyme, leading
to impaired conversion of cortisol to cortisone, and thus hypokalemia and
hypertension.

Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) excess
Two forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (b see Part 4 p. 239) are
associated with excess production of DOC, which acts as an agonist at
the mineralocorticoid receptor, resulting in hypertension with suppression of renin:
• 17A-hydroxylase deﬁciency
• 11B-hydroxylase deﬁciency
Glucocorticoid replacement to inhibit ACTH is effective treatment for
these conditions.
Adrenal tumors rarely secrete excessive amounts of DOC. Usually this
is concomitant with excessive aldosterone production, but occasionally it
may occur in an isolated fashion.

CHAPTER 36

Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome

Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome

Deﬁnition and epidemiology
Cushing’s syndrome results from chronic excess cortisol and is described
in Chapter 18 (b Cushing’s disease, p. 116).
The causes may be classiﬁed as ACTH dependent and ACTH independent. This section describes ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome,
which is due to adrenal tumors (benign and malignant) and is responsible
for 10–20% cases of Cushing’s syndrome.
Adrenal tumors causing Cushing’s syndrome are more common in
women. The peak incidence is in the fourth and ﬁfth decades.
Causes and relative frequencies of adrenal Cushing’s syndrome in adults
are as follows:
• Adrenal adenoma: 12%.
• Adrenal carcinoma: 6%.
• Bilateral micronodular adrenal hyperplasia: 1%.
• Bilateral macronodular hyperplasia: 1%.

Pathophysiology
Benign adenomas are usually encapsulated and <6 cm in diameter. They
are usually associated with pure glucocorticoid excess.
Adrenal carcinomas are usually >6 cm in diameter, although they may
be smaller, and are often associated with local invasion and metastases at
the time of diagnosis. They may be associated with secretion of excess
androgen production in addition to cortisol. Occasionally, they may be
associated with mineralocorticoid or estrogen secretion.
Carney complex (b see Carney complex, p. 496) is an autosomal dominant condition characterized by atrial myxomas, spotty skin pigmentation,
peripheral nerve tumors, and endocrine disorders, e.g., Cushing’s syndrome due to pigmented adrenal nodular hyperplasia.
Adrenal hyperplasia may be micronodular (<1 cm diameter) or macronodular (>1 cm).

Bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia
Most cases of bilateral macronodular hyperplasia do not have an identiﬁable cause.
Abnormal gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), vasopressin, B-agonist, human
chorionic gonadotropin\luteinizing hormone, and serotonin receptors have
been described.
Several cases of food-dependent Cushing’s syndrome have been
described that are due to GIP receptor expression.

INVESTIGATIONS

Clinical features
The clinical features of ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome are as
described in b Clinical features, p. 157 in Chapter 18, Cushing’s disease.
It is important to note that in patients with adrenal carcinoma, there
may also be features related to excessive androgen production in women,
as well as a relatively more rapid time course of development of the
syndrome.

Investigations
Once the presence of Cushing’s syndrome is conﬁrmed (b see Clinical
features, p. 157), subsequent investigation of the cause depends on
whether ACTH is suppressed (ACTH independent), or measurable or
elevated (ACTH dependent).
Patients with ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome do not suppress
cortisol to <50% basal on high-dose dexamethasone testing and fail to
show a rise in cortisol and ACTH following administration of CRH. (The
latter test is often important when patients have borderline or low ACTH
to differentiate pituitary-dependent disease from adrenal diesase.)
ACTH-independent causes are adrenal in origin, and the mainstay of
further investigation is adrenal imaging.
CT scanning allows excellent visualization of the adrenal glands and
their anatomy.
Adenomas are usually small and homogeneous and usually associated
with contralateral gland atrophy.
Adrenal carcinomas are usually >6 cm in diameter, are heterogeneous
with calciﬁcation and necrosis, and have evidence of local invasion.

Bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia
• Monitor ACTH and cortisol response to a mixed meal, luteinizing
hormone releasing hormone (LHRH), and posture.
• ACTH independent
• Medical treatment may be possible, e.g., octreotide, for GIP-dependent
disease.

185

186

CHAPTER 36

Adrenal Cushing’s syndrome

Treatment
b See Treatment, p. 356.

Adrenal adenoma
Unilateral adrenalectomy (normally laparoscopic) is curative.
Postoperative temporary adrenal insufﬁciency ensues because of
long-term suppression of ACTH and the contralateral adrenal gland,
requiring glucocorticoid replacement for up to 2 years.

Adrenal carcinoma
Surgery is useful to debulk tumor mass, and occasionally adrenalectomy
and local clearance leads to cure. However, most patients have distant
metastases at the time of diagnosis.
Postoperative drug treatment with the adrenolytic agent mitotane
(orthopara DDD) 3–12 g daily may prolong survival. This may lead to
adrenal insufﬁciency, and glucocorticoid replacement may be required.
Side effects may limit therapy and include nausea and vomiting, dizziness,
and diarrhea. Monitoring of drug levels can be helpful to ensure concentrations within the therapeutic range (14–20 mcg/mL) and thus limit unwanted
side effects.
Other drugs may be required to control cortisol hypersecretion
(e.g., metyrapone).
Newer treatments such as suramin, 5-ﬂuorouracil, and gossypol have also
been tried without evidence of beneﬁt.

Bilateral adrenal hyperplasia
Bilateral adrenalectomy is curative. Lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid treatment is required.
Medical treatment may be possible for cases with aberrant receptors,
e.g., octreotide for GIP-dependent disease.

Prognosis
Adrenal adenomas, which are successfully treated with surgery, have a
good prognosis, and recurrence is unlikely. The prognosis depends on
the long-term effects of excess cortisol before treatment—in particular,
atherosclerosis and osteoporosis.
The prognosis for adrenal carcinoma is very poor, despite surgery.
Reports suggest a 5-year survival of 22% and median survival time of 14
months. Age >40 years and distant metastases are associated with a worse
prognosis.

SUBCLINICAL CUSHING’S SYNDROME

Subclinical Cushing’s syndrome
This describes a subset of 5–10% of patients with an adrenal incidentaloma
with autonomous glucocorticoid production that is insufﬁcient to produce
overt Cushing’s syndrome.
Urinary free cortisol measurement may be within the normal range, but
there is a failure to suppress with low-dose dexamethasone.
An associated i risk of diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, and hypertension has been reported.
Data are insufﬁcient to indicate the superiority of a surgical or nonsurgical approach to management.
Hypoadrenalism post-adrenalectomy has been reported that is due to
suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland. Perioperative steroid cover
is therefore required with re-evaluation postoperatively.

CHAPTER 37

Adrenal surgery

Adrenal surgery

Adrenalectomy
Open adrenalectomy may still be necessary for large and complex
pathology. However, laparoscopic adrenalectomy (ﬁrst performed in
1992) has become the procedure of choice for removal of most adrenal
tumors.
Retrospective comparisons with open approaches suggest reduced hospital stay and analgesic requirements and lower postoperative morbidity.
However, there are few long-term outcome data on this technique. It is
most useful in the management of small (<6 cm) benign adenomas.
Laparoscopic bilateral adrenalectomy, although technically demanding,
offers a useful approach to patients with macronodular hyperplasia and
in selected patients with ACTH-dependent Cushing’s syndrome where
alternative therapeutic options are not appropriate.

Preoperative preparation of patients
• Cushing’s—metyrapone or ketoconazole (b see p. 123)
• Phaeochromocytoma—A- and B-blockade (b see p. 218).

Perioperative management
See Box 37.1.

ADRENALECTOMY

Box 37.1 Perioperative management of patients
undergoing adrenalectomy
Management is for adrenal cortical tumors (benign and malignant) and
bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing’s syndrome.
Perioperative glucocorticoid cover is required, as even “silent” adenomas may be associated with subclinical excess cortisol secretion and
hence suppression of the contralateral adrenal gland.
Hydrocortisone is given as for pituitary surgery—100 mg IM with the
premedication, and then continued every 6 hours for 24–48 hours, until
the patient can take oral medication and is eating and drinking.
This is changed to oral hydrocortisone at double replacement
dose—20 mg on waking, 10 mg at lunchtime and 10 mg at 5 P.M., and
mineralocorticoid replacement commenced if bilateral adrenalectomy
has been performed (0.1 mg ﬂudrocortisone daily). Electrolytes and
BP guide adequacy of treatment. Normal replacement hydrocortisone
(20–25 mg/24 hours) can be commenced when the patient is recovered
and may be omitted altogether if the patient did not have preoperative
evidence of Cushing’s syndrome/suppression of the contralateral gland/
bilateral adrenalectomy. Mineralocorticoid replacement is only required
in patients who have had bilateral adrenalectomy.
A Cortrosyn® stimulation test (off hydrocortisone for at least
24 hours) is performed after at least 2 weeks to demonstrate adequate function of the contralateral adrenal. However, in patients with
ACTH-independent Cushing’s syndrome, it may take up to 2 years for
full recovery of the contralateral adrenal gland to recover.
The exception is patients undergoing adrenalectomy for mineralocorticoid-secreting tumors. These patients do not usually require
perioperative glucocorticoid replacement, but preoperative amiloride
or spironolactone allows recovery of potassium stores and control of
hypertension prior to surgery.

CHAPTER 38

Renal tubular abnormalities

Renal tubular abnormalities

Background
Bartter’s syndrome is associated with hypokalemic alkalosis and activation
of the renin–angiotensin system, but without hypertension. Liddle’s syndrome is associated with hypokalemic alkalosis and hypertension but low
renin and aldosterone levels.

Liddle’s syndrome
This is a rare autosomal dominant (AD) condition with variable penetrance. Mutations have been localized to genes on chromosome 16.

Cause
A mutation occurs in the gene encoding the B- or G-subunit of the highly
selective epithelial sodium channel in the distal nephron. This leads to constitutive activation of sodium transport independent of circulating mineralocorticoid; secondary activation of the sodium–potassium exchange occurs.

Features
• Hypokalemia and hypertension

Investigation
• Hypokalemic alkalosis
• Suppressed renin and aldosterone levels
• b See Table 38.1

Treatment
Hypertension responds to amiloride (doses up to 40 mg/day) but not
spironolactone, because amiloride acts on the sodium channel directly,
whereas spironolactone acts on the mineralocorticoid receptor.

BARTTER’S SYNDROME

Bartter’s syndrome
Cause
There is loss of function of the bumetanide-sensitive Na–K–2Cl co-transporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. Mutations in three
genes have been reported to account for the phenotype—these encode
regulatory ion channels (NKCC2, ROMK, CLCNKB).
Inactivation of the co-transporter leads to salt wasting, activation of the
renin–angiotensin system, and i aldosterone, which leads to i sodium
reabsorption at the distal nephron and causes hypokalemic alkalosis.
Reabsorption of calcium also occurs in the thick ascending loop and thus
inactivation leads to hypercalciuria.
The lack of associated hypertension is thought to be due to i prostaglandin production from the renal medullary interstitial tissue in response
to hypokalemia.
Rare (71/million) autosomal recessive hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis is
associated with salt wasting and normal or reduced BP.
The syndrome is usually present at an early age (<5 years).

Features
•
•
•
•

Intravascular volume depletion
Seizures
Tetany
Muscle weakness

Investigations
• Hypokalemic alkalosis
• i PRA and aldosterone
• Hypercalciuria

Treatment
Potassium replacement
Potassium-sparing diuretics may help, but they are usually inadequate
to correct hypokalemia. Prostaglandin synthase inhibitors (NSAIDS),
e.g., indometacin 2–5 mg/kg per day or ibuprofen, may be required.

CHAPTER 39

Mineralocorticoid deﬁciency

Mineralocorticoid deﬁciency

Epidemiology
This deﬁciency is rare, apart from the hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism
associated with diabetes mellitus.

Causes
Congenital
• Adrenal hypoplasia: X-linked failure of development of the adrenal
gland. Presents in infancy with salt-losing state. Differentiated from
CAH by normal external genitalia and steroid levels
• Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH): certain types, most commonly
21-hydroxylase deﬁciency, are associated with MC deﬁciency;
b see p. 239.
• Rare inherited disorders of aldosterone biosynthesis
• Adrenoleukodystrophy: X-linked affecting 1/20,000 men, where
very long-chain fatty acids cannot be oxidized in peroxisomes and
accumulate in tissues. CNS symptoms may be absent but progressive
demyelination can lead to hypertonic tetraparesis, dementia, epilepsy,
coma, or death.
• Pseudohypoaldosteronism: inherited resistance to the action of
aldosterone; b see p. 570. Autosomal dominant and recessive forms
are described. Usually presents in infancy. Treated with sodium
chloride

Acquired
• Adrenal insufﬁciency: b see p. 193
• Drugs: heparin (heparin for >5 days may cause severe hyperkalemia
due to a toxic effect on the zona glomerulosa); ciclosporin
• Hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism: interference with the renin– angiotensin
system leads to mineralocorticoid deﬁciency and hyperkalemic acidosis
(type IV renal tubular acidosis), e.g., diabetic nephropathy. Treatment is
ﬂudrocortisone and potassium restriction. ACE inhibitors may produce a
similar biochemical picture, but here the PRA will be elevated as there is
no angiotensin II feedback on renin.

Treatment
• Fludrocortisone

DEFINITION

Adrenal insufﬁciency

Deﬁnition
Adrenal insufﬁciency results from inadequate adrenocortical function and
may be due to destruction of the adrenal cortex (primary or Addison’s
disease) or to disordered pituitary and hypothalamic function (secondary).

193

194

CHAPTER 40

Adrenal insufﬁciency

Epidemiology
• The prevalence of Addison’s disease is approximately 93–140/million
adults. Incidence is 4.7–6.2 per million in the white population.
• Secondary adrenal insufﬁciency is most commonly due to suppression
of pituitary–hypothalamic function by exogenous glucocorticoid
administration.

Causes of secondary adrenal insufﬁciency
Lesions of the hypothalamus and/or pituitary gland
• Tumors—pituitary tumor, metastases, craniopharyngioma
• Infection—tuberculosis
• Inﬂammation—sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, hemochromatosis,
lymphocytic hypophysitis
• Iatrogenic—surgery, radiotherapy
• Other—isolated ACTH deﬁciency, trauma
Suppression of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis
• Glucocorticoid administration
• Cushing’s disease (after pituitary tumor removal)

Features of secondary adrenal insufﬁciency
As primary (b see Clinical features, p. 198), except:
• Absence of pigmentation—skin is pale
• Absence of mineralocoticoid deﬁciency
• Associated features of underlying cause, e.g., visual ﬁeld defects if there
is a pituitary tumor
• Other endocrine deﬁciencies may manifest due to pituitary failure
(b see p. 352).
• Acute onset may occur due to pituitary apoplexy.

Isolated ACTH deﬁciency
• Rare
• Pathogenesis is unclear. It may be autoimmune (associated with other
autoimmune conditions, and antipituitary antibodies are described in
some patients).
• Absent ACTH response to CRH
• POMC mutations and POMC processing abnormalities (e.g.,
proconvertase PC1).

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Pathophysiology
Primary
Adrenal gland destruction or dysfunction occurs from a disease process
that usually involves all three zones of the adrenal cortex, resulting in
inadequate glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen secretion.
Autoimmunity is the main etiologic factor.
The manifestations of insufﬁciency do not usually appear until at least
90% of the gland has been destroyed and are usually gradual in onset, with
partial adrenal insufﬁciency leading to an impaired cortisol response to
stress, and the features of complete insufﬁciency occurring later.
Acute adrenal insufﬁciency may occur in the context of acute septicemia
(e.g., meningococcal or hemorrhage).
Mineralocorticoid deﬁciency leads to reduced sodium retention and
hypotension with d intravascular volume, in addition to hyperkalemia due
to d renal potassium and hydrogen ion excretion.
Androgen deﬁciency presents in women with reduced axillary and pubic
hair and reduced libido. (Testicular production of androgens is more
important in men.)
Lack of cortisol negative feedback increases CRH and ACTH secretion.
An increase in other POMC-related peptides leads to skin pigmentation
and other mucous membranes.

Secondary
Inadequate ACTH results in deﬁcient cortisol production (and d androgens
in women).
There is no pigmentation because ACTH and POMC secretion is reduced.
Mineralocorticoid secretion remains normal, as it is mainly regulated by the
renin–angiotensin system.
The onset is usually gradual with partial ACTH deﬁciency resulting in
reduced response to stress. Prolonged ACTH deﬁciency leads to atrophy
of the zona fasiculata and reduced ability to respond acutely to ACTH.

Investigations
b See p. 94 for pituitary/hypothalamic disease and p. 206 for long-term
endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids.

CHAPTER 41

Addison’s disease

Addison’s disease

Causes of primary adrenal insufﬁciency
• Autoimmune—most common cause in the developed world
(approximately 70% cases).
• Autoimmune polyglandular deﬁciency—type 1 or 2 (b see p. 198, 199).
Malignancy
• Metastatic (lung, breast, kidney—adrenal metastases found in 750% of
patients, but symptomatic adrenal insufﬁciency much less common)
• Lymphoma
Inﬁltration
• Amyloid
• Hemochromatosis
Infection
• Tuberculosis (medulla more frequently destroyed than cortex)
• Fungal, e.g., histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis
• Opportunistic infections in, e.g., AIDS—CMV, mycobacterium
intracellulare, cryptococcus (up to 5% patients with AIDS develop
primary adrenal insufﬁciency in the late stages)
Vascular hemorrhage
• Anticoagulants
• Waterhouse–Friedrichson syndrome in meningococcal septicemia
Infarction
• E.g., secondary to thrombosis in antiphospholipid syndrome
Adrenoleucodystrophy
• Inherited disorder of fatty acid metabolism
• Diagnosed by measuring very long-chain fatty acids
• Presents in childhood
• Progresses to quadraparesis and dementia in association with adrenal
failure
• Treat with Lorenzo’s oil
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
• b See p. 239
Congenital adrenal hypoplasia
• Rare familial failure of adrenal cortical development due to mutations
and deletion of DAX 1 gene

AUTOIMMUNE ADRENALITIS

Iatrogenic
• Adrenalectomy
• Drugs: ketoconazole and ﬂuconazole (inhibit cortisol synthesis),
phenytoin, rifampicin (increases cortisol metabolism), etomidate,
aminoglutethamide (usually do not cause hypoadrenalism unless
reduced adrenal or pituitary reserve)

Autoimmune adrenalitis
This is mediated by humoral and cell-mediated immune mechanisms.
Autoimmune insufﬁciency associated with polyglandular autoimmune syndrome is more common in women (70%).
Adrenal cortex antibodies are present in the majority of patients at
diagnosis, and although titers decline and eventually disappear, they are
still found in approximately 70% of patients 10 years later. Up to 20%
patients/year with positive adrenal antibodies develop adrenal insufﬁciency. Antibodies to 21-hydroxylase are commonly found, although the
exact nature of other antibodies that block the effect of ACTH for example are yet to be elucidated.
Antiadrenal antibodies are found in <2% of patients with other autoimmune endocrine disease (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, diabetes mellitus,
autoimmune hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, pernicious anemia).
In addition, antibodies to other endocrine glands are commonly found
in patients with autoimmune adrenal insufﬁciency (thyroid microsomal in
50%, gastric parietal cell, parathyroid, and ovary and testis).
Polyglandular autoimmune conditions also occur (b see Autoimmune
polyglandular syndrome [APS] type 1, p. 198; APS types 2–4, p. 199). The
presence of 17-hydroxylase antibodies in association with 21-hydroxylase
antibodies is a good marker of patients at risk of developing premature
ovarian failure in association with primary adrenal failure.
Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disease
only rarely develop autoimmune adrenal insufﬁciency. Approximately 50%
of patients with Addison’s disease have other autoimmune or endocrine
disorders.

CHAPTER 41

Addison’s disease

Investigation of primary adrenal
insufﬁciency
Electrolytes
• Hyponatremia is present in 90% and hyperkalemia in 65%.
• Elevated urea

Serum cortisol and ACTH
Undetectable serum cortisol is diagnostic of adrenal insufﬁciency, but
the basal cortisol is usually in the normal range. A cortisol >21 mcg/dL
precludes the diagnosis. At times of acute stress, an inappropriately low
cortisol is very suggestive of the diagnosis.
Simultaneous 8 A.M. cortisol and ACTH will show an elevated ACTH
for the level of cortisol. This is a very sensitive means of detecting
Addison’s disease.
Drugs causing i cortisol-binding globulin (e.g., estrogens) will result in
higher total cortisol concentration measurements.

Response to ACTH
Cortrosyn® stimulation test
Following basal cortisol measurement, 250 mcg Cortrosyn® is administered IM and serum cortisol checked at 30 and 60 minutes.
Serum cortisol should rise to a peak of 21 mcg/dL (note that this cutoff
may depend on local assay conditions).
Failure to respond suggests adrenal failure.

Increased plasma renin activity (assessment of
mineralocorticoid sufﬁciency)
This is one of the earliest abnormalities in developing primary adrenal
insufﬁciency.

Thyroid function tests
Reduced thyroid hormone levels and elevated TSH may be due to a direct
effect of glucocorticoid deﬁciency (cortisol inhibits TRH) or to associated
autoimmune hypothyroidism. Re-evaluation is therefore required after
adrenal insufﬁciency has been rectiﬁed.

INVESTIGATION OF PRIMARY ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY

Establish cause of adrenal insufﬁciency
Adrenal autoantibodies
These detect antibodies to adrenal cortex and, more recently, speciﬁc antibodies to 21-hydroxylase, side-chain cleavage enzyme, and
17-hydroxylase.
21-hydroxylase antibodies are the major component of adrenal cortex
antibodies and are present in 80% of recent-onset autoimmune adrenalitis. Adrenal cortex antibodies (present in 80% patients with recent-onset
autoimmune adrenalitis) are not detectable in non-autoimmune primary
adrenal failure.
Imaging
Adrenal enlargement with or without calciﬁcation may be seen on CT of
the abdomen, suggesting tuberculosis, inﬁltration, or metastatic disease.
The adrenals are small and atrophic in autoimmune adrenalitis.
Speciﬁc tests
These include serological or microbiological investigations directed at
particular infections, or very long-chain fatty acids (adrenoleucodystrophy) in men and women with antibody-negative isolated primary adrenal
insufﬁciency.

Acute adrenal insufﬁciency
Clinical features
• Shock
• Hypotension (often not responding to measures such as inotropic
support)
• Abdominal pain (may present as acute abdomen)
• Unexplained fever
• Often precipitated by major stress such as severe bacterial infection,
major surgery, unabsorbed glucocorticoid medication due to vomiting
• Occasionally occurs due to bilateral adrenal infarction
Investigations
• As chronic
• In the acute situation, if the diagnosis is suspected, an inappropriately
low cortisol (i.e., <19 mcg/dL) is often sufﬁcient to make the diagnosis.
b See Box 41.1 for Emergency management.

CHAPTER 41

Addison’s disease

Box 41.1 Emergency management of acute adrenal
insufﬁciency
This is a life-threatening emergency and should be treated if there is
strong clinical suspicion, rather than waiting for conﬁrmatory test
results.
Blood should be taken for urgent analysis of electrolytes and glucose,
in addition to cortisol and ACTH.
Fluids
Large volumes of 0.9% saline may be required to reverse the volume
depletion and sodium deﬁciency. Several liters may be required in the
ﬁrst 24–48 hours, but caution should be exercised where there has been
chronic hyponatremia; in this circumstance rapid correction of the deﬁcit exposes the patient to risk of central pontine myelinolysis.
If plasma sodium is <120 mmol/L at presentation, aim to correct this
by no more than 10mmol/L in the ﬁrst 24 hours.
Hydrocortisone
A bolus dose of 100 mg hydrocortisone is administered intravenously.
Hydrocortisone 100 mg IM is then continued 6-hourly for 24–48 hours or
until the patient can take oral therapy. Double replacement dose hydrocortisone (20, 10, and 10 mg orally) can then be instituted until well.
This traditional regimen causes supraphysiological replacement, and
some authors suggest lower doses, e.g., 150 mg IV/24 hours.
Speciﬁc mineralocorticoid replacement is not required, as the highdose glucocorticoid has sufﬁcient mineralocorticoid effects (40 mg
hydrocortisone 7100 mcg ﬂudrocortisone). Once the dose of glucocorticoid is reduced after a couple of days and the patient is taking food and
ﬂuids by mouth, ﬂudrocortisone 100 mcg/day can be commenced.
Glucose supplementation
Occasionally, this is required because of risk of hypoglycemia (low glycogen stores in the liver as a result of glucocorticoid deﬁciency).
Investigate and treat precipitant
This is often infection.
Monitoring treatment
Monitor electrolytes, glucose, and urea.

TREATMENT

Treatment
Maintenance therapy
Glucocorticoid replacement
Hydrocortisone is the treatment of choice for replacement therapy, as it
is reliably and predictably absorbed and allows biochemical monitoring
of levels.
It is administered 3 × daily 10 mg on waking, 5 mg at midday, and 5 mg at
6 P.M. Some patients can be managed adequately with twice-daily administration of hydrocortisone.
An alternative is prednisone 5 mg once daily. This has the disadvantage
that levels cannot be biochemically monitored, but its longer t½ may lead
to better suppression of ACTH if pigmentation and markedly elevated
morning ACTH levels are a problem. Occasionally, dexamethasone is
required for this purpose.
Mineralocorticoid replacement
Fludrocortisone (9-ﬂurohydrocortisone) is given at a dose of 0.1 mg daily.
Aim to avoid signiﬁcant postural fall in BP (>10 mmHg).
Occasionally, lower (0.05 mg) or higher (0.2 mg) doses are required.
A dose of 40 mg hydrocortisone has the equivalent mineralocortisone
effects as 0.1 mg ﬂudrocortisone.
Renin activity can help guide adequacy of therapy.
DHEA replacement
Dihydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is also deﬁcient in hypoadrenalism.
DHEA replacement (25–50 mg/day) may improve mood and well-being
(as dietary supplement).

Monitoring of therapy
Clinical
• For signs of glucocorticoid excess, e.g., i weight
• BP (including postural change)
Hypertension and edema suggest excessive mineralocorticoid replacement, whereas postural hypotension and salt craving suggest insufﬁcient
treatment.
Biochemical
• Serum electrolytes
• Plasma renin activity (elevated if insufﬁcient ﬂudrocortisone
replacement). Very dependent on when the last dose was taken
• Cortisol day curve to assess adequacy of treatment
Monitor ACTH levels prior to and following morning glucocorticoid
replacement if the patient develops i pigmentation. If levels are elevated
or rising with little suppression following glucocorticoid, obtain an MRI
scan to exclude the rare possibility of pituitary hyperplasia or, very rarely,
the development of a corticotrope adenoma.

203

CHAPTER 41

Addison’s disease

Intercurrent illness
Cortisol requirements increase during severe illness or surgery.
For moderate elective procedures or investigations, e.g., endoscopy or
angiography, patients should receive a single dose of 100 mg hydrocortisone before the procedure.
For major surgery, patients should take 20 mg hydrocortisone orally or
100 mg intramuscularly with the premedication and receive:
• 50–100 mg IM hydrocortisone 6-hourly for the ﬁrst 3 days or
• 100–150 mg per 24 hours IV in 5% dextrose before reverting rapidly to
a maintenance dose.
To cover severe illness, e.g., pneumonia, patients should receive 50–100 mg
IM hydrocortisone q6h until resolution of the illness.

Box 41.2 Adrenal insufﬁciency in pregnancy
b Also see Normal changes during pregnancy (p. 361).
During normal pregnancy:
• Cortisol-binding globulin gradually increases.
• Free cortisol increases in the third trimester.
• Progesterone increases exerting an antimineralocorticoid effect.
• Renin levels increase.
In Addison’s disease, therefore:
• The usual glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement is
continued initially.
• Increase the hydrocortisone 50% in the third trimester.
• Adjust mineralocorticoids to BP and serum potassium (not renin).
Severe hyperemesis gravidarum during the ﬁrst trimester may require
temporary parenteral therapy and patients should be warned about this
to avoid precipitation of a crisis.
During labor and for 24–48 hours:
• Parenteral glucocorticoid therapy is administered (100 mg IM every
6 hours).
• Or hydrocortisone 100 mg IV in 5% dextrose per 24 hours.
• Fluid replacement with IV 0.9% saline may be required.

Drug interactions
Rifampicin
• Increases the clearance of cortisol
• Double usual dose of hydrocortisone
Mitotane
• Increases cortisol binding globulin
• Double usual dose of hydrocortisone

TREATMENT

Education of the patient
Patient education is the key to successful management. Patients must be
taught never to miss a dose. They should be encouraged to wear a Medic
Alert bracelet.
Every patient should know how to double the dose of glucocorticoid
during febrile illness and to get medical attention if unable to take the tablets because of vomiting. They should have a vial of 100 mg hydrocortisone
with a syringe, diluent, and needle for times when parenteral treatment
may be required.

CHAPTER 42

Long-term glucocorticoid administration

Long-term glucocorticoid
administration
Both exogenous glucocorticoid administration and endogenous excess
glucocorticoids (Cushing’s syndrome) lead to a negative feedback effect
on the hypothalamo–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, leading to suppression
of both CRH and ACTH secretion and atrophy of the zona fasiculata and
reticularis of the adrenal cortex.

Short-term steroids
Any patient who has received glucocorticoid treatment for <3 weeks is
unlikely to have clinically signiﬁcant adrenal suppression, and if the medical condition allows it, glucocorticoid treatment can be stopped acutely.
A major stress within a week of stopping steroids should, however, be
covered with glucocorticoids.
Exceptions to this are patients who have other possible reasons for
adrenocortical insufﬁciency, who have received >40 mg prednisolone (or
equivalent), where a short course has been prescribed within 1 year of cessation of long-term therapy, or evening doses (i HPA axis suppression).

Steroid cover
While receiving glucocorticoid treatment and within 1 year of steroid
withdrawal, patients should receive standard steroid supplementation
(Box 42.1) at times of stress, e.g., major trauma, surgery, and infection
(b p. 562).

CUSHING’S SYNDROME

Box 42.2 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)
• DHEA is an abundant circulating adrenal androgen with a production
rate of 25–50 mg/day. Its levels undergo a progressive decline with i
age, and there has been interest in its physiological role.
• Epidemiological data suggest a link between changes in DHEA and
age-related changes including an inverse relationship between DHEA
and cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer disease, and malignancy.
• Although animal studies have suggested potential therapeutic beneﬁt
of DHEA therapy, small studies in humans have so far failed to
demonstrate convincing beneﬁt otherwise and apart from short-term
improvement in well-being.
• Recent evidence suggests that DHEA replacement in patients with
Addison’s disease may have beneﬁcial effects on well-being.

Long-term steroids
When patients are receiving supraphysiological doses (>5.0 mg prednisone, or equivalent) of glucocorticoid, dose reduction depends on disease
activity. Once a daily equivalent of 5.0 mg prednisone is reached, the rate
of reduction should be slower to allow recovery of the HPA axis.
If concerned about disease resolution, the rate of reduction of glucocorticoids is determined by the disease process until 5.0 mg equivalent is
reached. If the disease has resolved, the dose can be rapidly reduced to 5.0
mg prednisone by a reduction of 2.5 mg every 3–5 days.
Once the patient is established on 5.0 mg prednisolone, consider changing to hydrocortisone (20 mg in the morning), as this has a shorter t½ and
will therefore lead to less prolonged suppression of ACTH.
The daily hydrocortisone dose should be reduced by 2.5 mg every 1–2
weeks or as tolerated until a dose of 10 mg is reached. After 2–3 months,
a 9 A.M. cortisol is checked 24 hours after last dose of hydrocortisone. If it
is >10 mcg/dL, then hydrocortisone can be stopped and a Cortrosyn® test
performed. If the 9 A.M. cortisol is <10 mcg/dL, then continue hydrocortisone 10 mg for another 2–3 months and repeat the 9 A.M. cortisol.
When basal cortisol is >14 mcg/dL, stop regular hydrocortisone and
administer in emergency only. Supplemental steroids during intercurrent
illness are not required.

Cushing’s syndrome
Patients with Cushing’s syndrome who are on metyrapone or have recently
treated disease, whatever the cause, may also have HPA axis suppression
and may therefore need steroid replacement at times of stress.

CHAPTER 43

Adrenal incidentalomas

Adrenal incidentalomas

Deﬁnition and epidemiology
A true incidentaloma is an incidentally detected lesion with no pathophysiological signiﬁcance. It needs to be differentiated from incidentally
detected but clinically relevant masses.
The incidental detection of an adrenal mass is becoming more common
as i numbers of imaging procedures are performed and with technological
improvements in imaging.
Autopsy studies suggest an incidence of adrenal adenomas of 1–6%.
Imaging studies suggest an incidence of approximately 3.5%.

Importance
It is important to determine whether the incidentally discovered adrenal
mass is
• Malignant
• Functioning and associated with excess hormonal secretion

Differential diagnosis of an
incidentally detected adrenal nodule
• Cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma causing Cushing’s syndrome or
subclinical Cushing’s syndrome (5.2%)
• Mineralocorticoid-secreting adrenal adenoma
• Androgen-secreting adenoma
• CAH
• Adrenal carcinoma (12%)
• Metastasis (2%)
• Pheochromocytoma (11%)
• Adrenal cysts (5%)
• Lipoma
• Myelolipoma (8%)
• Hematoma
• Ganglioneuroma (4%)

MANAGEMENT

Investigations
• Clinical assessment for symptoms and signs of excess hormone
secretion and signs of extra-adrenal carcinoma
• Urinary free cortisol and overnight dexamethasone suppression test
• Urinary free catecholamines/metadrenalines
• Plasma free metanephrines if available (b see p. 215)
• Aldosterone/renin ratio if hypertensive or hypokalemic
• A homogeneous mass with a low attenuation value (<10 HU) on CT
scan is likely to be a benign adenoma.
Additional tests if adrenal carcinoma suspected:
• 24-hour urinary excretion of corticosteroid metabolites
• DHEA, 17A OH progesterone
• 17A estradiol (in males only)
• Testosterone, androstendione (in virilizing tumors)

Management
Up to 20% of patients may develop hormonal excess during follow-up.
This is unlikely if the tumor is <3 cm. Cortisol is the most common excess
hormone.
Surgery is indicated if there is the following:
• Evidence of a syndrome of hormonal excess attributable to the tumor
• Biochemical evidence of pheochromocytoma
• Mass diameter >4 cm (i likelihood of malignancy and deﬁnitely if >6
cm in diameter)
• Imaging features suggestive of malignancy (e.g., lack of clearly
circumscribed margin, vascular invasion)
Nonsurgical management includes the following:
• Repeat MRI at 6 and 12 months
• Repeat biochemical screening annually
• In patients with tumors that remain stable on two imaging studies
carried out at least 6 months apart and do not exhibit hormonal
hypersecretion over 4 years, further follow-up may not be warranted.

CHAPTER 44

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas

Pheochromocytomas and
paragangliomas

Deﬁnition
Pheochromocytomas are adrenomedullary catecholamine-secreting tumors
Paragangliomas are tumors arising from extra-adrenal medullary neural
crest derivatives, e.g., organ of Zuckerkandl (sympathetic) or carotid body,
aorticopulmonary, intravagal, or jugulotympanic (parasymapthetic). They
are usually in the head and neck, and only 25% are secretory.

Incidence
These are rare tumors, accounting for <0.1% of causes of hypertension.
However, it is a very important diagnosis because of the following:
• The development of potentially fatal hypertensive crises
• The reversibility of all its manifestations after surgical removal of the
tumor
• The lack of long-term efﬁcacy of medical treatment
• The appreciable incidence of malignancy

Epidemiology
There is equal sex distribution, and tumors most commonly present in the
third and fourth decades. Up to 50% may be diagnosed postmortem.
Tumors may be bilateral, particularly where part of an inherited syndrome (Table 44.1).

CHAPTER 44

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas

Pathophysiology
Sporadic tumors are usually unilateral and <10 cm in diameter. Tumors
associated with familial syndromes (see Box 44.1) are more likely to be
bilateral and associated with pre-existing medullary hyperplasia.

Box 44.1 Who should be screened for the presence of a
pheochromocy-toma?
• Patients with a family history of MEN, VHL, neuroﬁbromatosis (NF),
or SDH gene mutations
• Patients with paroxysmal symptoms
• Young patients with hypertension
• Patient developing hypertensive crisis during general anesthesia or
surgery
• Patients with unexplained heart failure
• Patients with an adrenal incidentaloma

Malignancy
Approximately 15–20% are malignant, and these are characterized by local
invasion or distant metastasis rather than capsular invasion.
Differentiating benign and malignant tumors is difﬁcult and based mainly
on presence of metastases, although chromosomal ploidy may be useful.
Paragangliomas are more likely to be malignant and to recur.
Typical sites for metastases are retroperitoneum, lymph nodes, bone,
liver, and mediastinum.

Secretory products
Catecholamine secretion is usually adrenaline or noradrenaline and
may be constant or episodic. Phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase
(PNMT) is necessary for methylation of noradrenaline to adrenaline and
is cortisol dependent.
Paragangliomas (except organ of Zuckerkandl) secrete noradrenaline
only, as they lack PNMT. Small adrenal tumors tend to produce more
adrenaline, whereas larger adrenal tumors produce more noradrenaline,
as a proportion of their blood supply is direct rather than corticomedullary and therefore lower in cortisol concentrations.
Pure dopamine secretion is rare and may be associated with hypotension. These tumors are more likely to be malignant.
Other non-catecholamine secretory products may also be produced,
including VIP, neuropeptide Y, ACTH (associated with Cushing’s syndrome), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and PTH-related peptide (PTHrP).

COMPLICATIONS

CHAPTER 44

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas

Investigations
Demonstrate catecholamine hypersecretion
A 24-hour urine collection is the standard test for screening for a pheochromocytoma. In a patient with suggestive symptoms, this is usually sufﬁcient to conﬁrm or exclude the diagnosis.
False negatives are more common when patients are asymptomatic and
early in the disease. Particular care is needed in familial cases, incidentalomas, and those in whom a general anesthetic has precipitated a hypertensive episode.
Metadrenalines (either urine or plasma) offer more speciﬁc diagnostic
tools than measurement of unmetabolized catecholamines and provide
the best biochemical tests for diagnosing pheochromocytoma.
24-hour urine collection for vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)/catecholamines/
metadrenalines (b see Table 44.2)
Urine is collected into bottles containing acid (warn patient).
Because of the episodic nature of catecholamine secretion, at least
2 × 24-hour collections should be performed. It is useful to perform a collection while a patient is having symptoms if episodic secretion is suspected.

INVESTIGATIONS

The sensitivity of urinary VMAs (Table 44.3) is somewhat less than free
catecholamines or metadrenalines and also inﬂuenced by dietary intake.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and labetalol interfere with adrenaline
measurements and should be stopped for 4 days.
Plasma catecholamine measurement
Intermittent secretion, and the short t½ of catecholamines, makes this
test of limited use in screening. Plasma metadrenalines may be more useful
as their t½ is longer and offer high speciﬁcity.
Normal levels drawn during an episode are strongly against the diagnosis.
Routine measurement requires controlled conditions—supine and cannulated
for 30 minutes, 10 mL blood drawn into a lithium heparin tube and cold spun.
Plasma catecholamines are elevated by renal failure, caffeine, nicotine,
exercise, and some drugs.
Plasma catecholamines 3 × the upper limit of normal are suspicious of a
pheochromocytoma in symptomatic individuals.
Catecholamine levels in asymptomatic individuals investigated for an
adrenal incidentaloma or due to a familial condition are often diagnosed at
an earlier stage and may therefore have lower catecholamines.
Suppression tests (b see Box 44.2)
These tests may be used to differentiate patients who have borderline catecholamine levels but may offer little advantage over the screening tests
already described.
• Clonidine 300 mcg orally—failure of suppression of plasma catecholamines
into normal range at 120 and 180 minutes is suggestive of tumor
Provocative tests
These are not used routinely as they do not enhance diagnostic accuracy
and are potentially dangerous.

Clonidine suppression test
• Patient supine and cannulated for 30 minutes
• Clonidine 300 mcg orally
• Plasma catecholamines measured at time 0, 120, and 180 minutes
• Failure to suppress into the normal range is suggestive of a tumor.
• 1.5% false-positive rate in patients with essential hypertension

Localization of tumor
Imaging
These are large tumors, in contrast to Conn’s syndrome, and not
easily missed with good-quality imaging to the bifurcation of the aorta.
Approximately 98% will be detected in the abdomen.
Less than 2% are in the chest and 0.02% are in the head.
Adrenal imaging with nonionic contrast should be performed initially,
then body imaging (ideally MRI) if tumor is not localized in adrenal.
• MRI: bright hyperintense image on T2
• CT: less sensitive and speciﬁc—less good at distinguishing between
different types of adrenal tumors
123

I-MIBG scan (b see Box 44.3)
Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine is a chromafﬁn-seeking analog. Imaging using
MIBG is positive in 60–80% pheochromocytomas and may locate tumors
not visualized on MRI, e.g., multiple and extra-adrenal tumors. Speciﬁcity
is nearly 100%.
An MIBG scan is performed preoperatively to exclude multiple
tumors.

scans should be preformed before commencing this drug.

INVESTIGATIONS

18F ﬂuorodopamine PET scanning is superior to MIBG in localizing metastatic disease. No K+ iodide is necessary to block thyroid uptake.
Positron emission tomography (PET)
[18F]ﬂuorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and the norepinephrine analog [11C]metahydroxyephedrine (mHED) have both been used as
radionucleotides.
Current data are insufﬁcient to determine which radionucleotide has
the greatest sensitivity and speciﬁcity.
Sensitivity is better than MIBG and approaches 100%, but speciﬁcity is
worse with false positives being reported.
Venous sampling
This is used to localize a pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma if imaging is
unhelpful.
Caution: A- and B-blockade should be administered before the
procedure.
Reversal of the ratio of noradrenaline to adrenaline (N <1) in the adrenal vein is suggestive of a pheochromocytoma.

Screening for associated conditions
Up to 24% of patients with apparently sporadic pheochromocytomas may
have a familial disorder. Therefore, high-risk patients should be screened
for the presence of associated conditions, even if asymptomatic. Screening
can be performed either by looking for associated clinical manifestations
or by genetic testing.
Genetic testing in nonsyndromic pheochromocytoma has shown a
hereditary predisposition in 24%, of which 45% had germ-line mutations
in VHL, 20% had mutations in RET, 18% mutations in SDHD, and 17%
mutations in SDHB.
MEN (p. 504)
• Serum calcium
• Serum calcitonin (pheochromocytomas precede medullary thyroid
carcinoma in 10%)
VHL (p. 494)
• Opthalmoscopy—retinal angiomas are usually the ﬁrst manifestation
• MRI posterior fossa and spinal cord
• US of kidneys—if not adequately imaged on MRI of adrenals
NF1 (see p. 490)
• Clinical examination for café-au-lait spots and cutaneous neuromas

Indications for screening for genetic conditions as
a cause for a pheochromocytoma
• Bilateral tumors
• Extra-adrenal tumor including head and neck
• Age of onset (<50 years 45% positive, >40 years 7% positive, >50 years
1% positive)
• Malignancy

CHAPTER 44

Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas

Management
Medical
It is essential that any patient be fully prepared with A- and B-blockade
before receiving IV contrast or undergoing a procedure such as venous
sampling or surgery.
A-Blockade must be started before B-blockade to avoid precipitating a
hypertensive crisis due to unopposed A-adrenergic stimulation.
• A-blockade—begin phenoxybenzamine, as soon as diagnosis is made.
Start at 10 mg 2 × day by mouth, and increase up to 20 mg 4 × day.
• B-blockade—use a B-blocker such as propranolol 20–80 mg q8h
by mouth 48–72 hours after starting phenoxybenzamine and with
evidence of adequate A-blockade blockade (generally noted by a
postural fall in BP).
Treatment is started in the hospital. Monitor BP, pulse, and hematocrit.
The goal is a BP of 130/80 or less sitting and 100 mg systolic standing, pulse
60–70 sitting and 70–80 standing. Reversal of A-mediated vasoconstriction
may lead to hemodilution (check Hb preoperatively).
To ensure complete blockade before surgery, IV phenoxybenzamine
(1 mg/kg over 4 hours in 100 mL 5% dextrose) is administered on
the 3 days before surgery. There is less experience with competetive
A-adrenergic blockade such as prazosin.

Surgical
Surgical resection is curative in most patients, leading to normotension
in at least 75%.
Mortality from elective surgery is <2%. It is essential that the anesthetic
and surgical teams have expertise of management of phechromocytomas
perioperatively.
Surgery may be laparoscopic if the tumor is small and apparently benign.
Careful perioperative anesthetic management is essential, as tumor handling may lead to major changes in BP and also occasionally cardiac
arrythmias.
Phentolamine, nitroprusside, or IV nicardipine are useful to treat perioperative hypertension, and esmolol or propranolol for perioperative arrythmias. Hypotension (e.g., after tumor devascularization) usually responds to
volume replacement, but occasionally requires inotropic support.

Follow-up
Cure is assessed by 24-hour urine free catecholamine measurement, but
since catecholamines may remain elevated for up to 10 days following
surgery, these should not be performed until 2 weeks postoperatively.
Lifelong follow-up is essential to detect recurrence of a benign tumor,
or metastasis from a malignant tumor, as it is impossible to exclude malignancy on a histological specimen.
Chromogranin A is also a useful marker (falsely elevated with proton
pump therapy, steroids, and renal failure).

MANAGEMENT

Malignancy
Malignant tumors require long-term A- and B-blockade. The tyrosine
kinase inhibitor A-methylparatyrosine may help control symptoms.
High-dose 131I MIBG can be used to treat metastatic disease.
Chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dacarbazine has been associated with symptomatic improvement.
Radiotherapy can be useful palliation in patients with bony metastases.

Prognosis
Hypertension may persist in 25% patients who have undergone successful
tumor removal.
• 5-year survival for benign tumors is 96%, and the recurrence rate is
<10%.
• 5-year survival for malignant tumors is 44%.
• SHB gene mutation is associated with a shorter survival.

CHAPTER 45

Hirsutism

Hirsutism

Deﬁnition
Hirsutism (not a diagnosis in itself) is the presence of excess hair growth
in females as a result of i androgen production and i skin sensitivity to
androgens. b See Table 45.1 for causes.

Physiology of hair growth
Before puberty, the body is covered with ﬁne, unpigmented vellus hairs.
During adolescence, androgens convert vellus hairs into coarse, pigmented
terminal hairs in androgen-dependent areas. The extent of terminal hair
growth depends on the concentration and duration of androgen exposure
as well as on the sensitivity of the individual hair follicle.
The reason different body regions respond differently to the same
androgen concentration is unknown but may be related to the number of
androgen receptors in the hair follicle.
Genetic factors play an important role in the individual susceptibility to
circulating androgens, as evidenced by racial differences in hair growth.

ANDROGEN PRODUCTION IN WOMEN

Androgen production in women
In females, testosterone (T) is secreted primarily by the ovaries and
adrenal glands, although a signiﬁcant amount is produced by the peripheral
conversion of androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).
Ovarian androgen production is regulated by lutenizing hormone (LH),
whereas adrenal production is ACTH dependent.
The predominant androgens produced by the ovaries are T and androstenedione, and DHEA sulfate (DHEAS) by the adrenal glands. Circulating
T is mainly bound to sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) and it is the
free T that is biologically active.
Testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the skin
by the enzyme 5A-reductase. Androstenedione and DHEA are not signiﬁcantly protein-bound. See Fig. 45.1.

CHAPTER 45

Hirsutism

Evaluation
Androgen-dependent hirsutism
Normally, this develops at puberty. Hairs are coarse and pigmented and
typically grow in a male pattern. It is often accompanied by other evidence
of androgen excess, such as acne, oily skin and hair, and male-pattern alopecia. Virilization refers to severe hirsuitism associated with male pattern
balding, anabolic phenotype and clitoromegaly and is associated with very
high androgen levels. For signs of virilization, indicating hyperandrogenism,
see Box 45.1.

History
• Age and rate of onset of hirsutism: Slowly progressive hirsutism
following puberty suggests a benign cause, whereas rapidly progressive
hirsutism of recent onset requires further immediate investigation to
rule out an androgen-secreting neoplasm.
• Menstrual history: ?oligomenorrheic or amenorrhea
• Presence of other evidence of hyperandrogenism, e.g., acne or
bitemporal hair recession
• Drug history: Some progestins used in oral contraceptives may be
androgenic (e.g., norethisterone. levonorgestryl).

Physical examination
Distinguish between androgen-dependent and androgen-independent hair
growth.
Assess the extent and severity of hirsutism. The Ferriman–Gallwey
score (b see Table 45.2) is used to assess the degree of hair growth in 11
regions of the body. This provides a semi-objective method of monitoring
disease progression and treatment outcome.
Virilization should be looked for, as this indicates severe hyperandrogenism and should be further investigated (see Box 45.1).
Acanthosis nigricans is indicative of insulin resistance of any cause.
Rare causes of hyperandrogenism, such as Cushing’s syndrome and
acromegaly, should be ruled out.

Laboratory investigation
Serum testosterone should be measured in all females presenting with
hirsutism. If this is <150 ng/dL the risk of a tumor is low.
Further investigations and management of the individual disorders will
be discussed in the following chapters.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS)

Deﬁnition
PCOS is a heterogeneous genetic clinical syndrome characterized by
hyperandrogenism (both ovarian and/or adrenal), ovulatory dysfunction,
and hyperinsulinemia, in which other causes of androgen excess have been
excluded (b see Box 46.1).
The diagnosis is further supported by the presence of characteristic
ovarian morphology on ultrasound (US).

Box 46.1 2003 Joint European Society of Human
Reproduction and Embryology and American Society of
Reproductive Medicine consensus on the diagnosis criteria
for PCOS (Rotterdam criteria)
At least two out of three of the following are present:
• Oligo- or amenorrhea
• Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical)
• Polycystic ovaries on US and exclusion of other disorders

Epidemiology
PCOS is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age.
The estimated prevalence of PCOS ranges from 5 to 10% on clinical
criteria. Polycystic ovaries on US alone are present in 20–25% of women
of reproductive age.

Other causes of hyperandrogenic
anovulation
•
•
•
•
•

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Acromegaly
Cushing’s syndrome
Testosterone-secreting tumors
Obesity-induced hyperandrogenic anovulation

Pathogenesis
The fundamental pathophysiological defect is unknown, but both genetic
and environmental factors contribute to the disorder.
Genetic
• Familial aggregation of PCOS in 50% of women. A family history of
type 2 diabetes mellitus is also more common in women with PCOS.
• PCOS is probably a polygenic disorder.
• Insulin synthesis genes, steroid enzyme biosynthesis genes, and genes
involved in reproduction and metabolism are possible candidates, e.g.,
INS, VNTR, and CYP11 genes; also FTO gene.
Hyperandrogenism
The main sources of hyperandrogenemia are the ovaries and adrenals.
The biochemical basis of ovarian dysfunction is unclear. Studies suggest an abnormality of cytochrome P-450c17 A activity. However, this is
unlikely to be the primary event, rather, an index of i steroidogenesis by
ovarian theca cells.
There is also an increase in the frequency and amplitude of GnRH
pulses, resulting in i LH concentrations (high LH/FSH ratio), which is characteristic of the syndrome. This may be secondary to anovulation and low
progesterone levels.

OTHER CAUSES OF HYPERANDROGENIC ANOVULATION

Hyperinsulinemia
The overwhelming majority of women with PCOS are insulin resistant.
The defect in insulin sensitivity appears to be selective, mainly affecting
the metabolic effects of insulin (effects on muscle and liver) rather than
its mitogenic actions (e.g., effects on ovaries). Hyperinsulinemia is further
exacerbated by obesity.
Women with PCOS have insufﬁcient B-cell response to a glucose challenge, which is known to be a precursor to type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Insulin and IGF-1 receptors are found in abundance in the ovarian stroma,
and it has been shown that insulin, in the presence of LH, stimulates ovarian
production of androgens. This is exaggerated in PCOS ovaries.
Insulin also inhibits SHBG synthesis by the liver with a consequent rise
in free androgen levels.

229

230

CHAPTER 46

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Features
• Onset of symptoms: Symptoms begin at puberty, often with early
menarche.
• Oligo- and amenorrhea (70%): Due to anovulation. These women are
usually well-estrogenized, so there is little risk of osteoporosis, unlike
other causes of amenorrhea.
• Hirsutism (66%)
• 25% of women also suffer from acne or male-pattern alopecia.
Virilization is not a feature of PCOS.
• There is often a family history of hirsutism or irregular periods.
Hirsutism secondary to adrenal or ovarian tumors, in contrast, is
usually rapidly progressive, associated with virilization and higher
testosterone concentrations.
• Rarely, hirsute women have nonclassical congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (bsee Classic presentation, p. 241). This should be
excluded, particularly in women with a family history .? Not all CAH
women have high T levels
• Obesity (50%): Symptoms worsen with obesity, as it is accompanied
by i testosterone concentrations as a result of the associated
hyperinsulinemia. Acanthosis nigricans is common in insulin-resistant
women with PCOS.
• Infertility (30%): PCOS accounts for 75% of cases of anovulatory
infertility. The risk of spontaneous miscarriage is also thought to be
higher than that in the general population

Rule out an androgen-secreting tumor
If there is the following:
• Evidence of virilization
• Testosterone >200 ng/dL
• Rapidly progressive hirsutism
• MRI or CT of adrenals and US of ovaries detecting tumors >1 cm
Selective venous sampling has not been shown to be useful in detecting
tumors.

Risks associated with PCOS
Type 2 diabetes mellitus
Type 2 diabetes mellitus is 2–4 x more common in women with PCOS.
Impaired glucose tolerance affects 10–30% of women with PCOS, and
gestational diabetes is also more prevalent.
The prevalence of diabetes mellitus is i in women with PCOS independent of weight but is highest in the obese group.
Dyslipidemia
Several studies have shown an i risk of hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in women
with PCOS.

FEATURES

Cardiovascular disease
There is evidence that atherosclerosis develops earlier in women with
PCOS. For example, women with PCOS have been found to be twice as
likely to have coronary artery atherosclerosis compared with controls.
However, in epidemiological studies, women with PCOS have not been
found to have i mortality from ischemic heart disease despite their multiple cardiovascular risk factors. No prospective studies are available.
Endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma
In anovulatory women, endometrial stimulation by unopposed estrogen
results in endometrial hyperplasia.
Several studies have also shown that this results in a 2- to 4-fold excess
risk of endometrial carcinoma in women with PCOS. However, larger
prospective studies are required to conﬁrm this excess risk.

231

232

CHAPTER 46

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Laboratory evaluation
Selected lab tests are used to conﬁrm the diagnosis, to exclude serious
underlying disorders, and to screen for complications.

Conﬁrmation of diagnosis
Testosterone concentration
• Performed to conﬁrm biochemical hyperandrogenism and to exclude
other causes of hyperandrogenism
LH concentration
• Raised in 50–70% of anovulatory patients with high LH/FSH ratio.
SHBG
• Low in 50% of women with PCOS owing to the hyperinsulinemic state,
with a consequent increase in circulating free androgens
• Indirect marker of insulin resistance
Free androgen index (FAI)
This is used as a surrogate for free T levels.
FAI = 100 × (total testosterone)
SHBG
Pelvic US of ovaries and endometrium
• 91% sensitivity in experienced hands, with transvaginal ultrasound
giving the highest yield
• Ultrasonic diagnosis of PCOS is made by the presence of >12 follicular
cysts between 2 and 9 mm in diameter or ovarian volume >10 cm3.
• Measurement of endometrial thickness is also useful in the diagnosis of
endometrial hyperplasia in the presence of anovulation. Endometrial
hyperplasia is diagnosed if the endometrial thickness is >10 mm.
• Transvaginal US will also identify 90% of ovarian virilizing tumors.

Exclusion of other disorders
Serum prolactin
This is used in the presence of infertility or oligoamenorrhea.
• Mild hyperprolactinemia may be present in up to 30% of women with
PCOS, and dopamine agonist treatment of this may be necessary if
pregnancy is desired.
17 OH (17OHP) progesterone level
• Used to exclude late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia
• Indicated in those with family history
• One may also conduct a Cosyntropin stimulation test looking for an
exaggerated rise in 17OHP 30 minutes after ACTH in the presence of
nonclassic 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency (b see Clinical presentation,
p. 192).

LABORATORY EVALUATION

• If the patient is ovulating, all 17OHP measurements should be taken
during the follicular phase of the cycle since androgen levels are higher
at midcycle and in the luteal phase.
DHEAS and androstenedione concentrations
• Both can be moderately raised in PCOS. DHEAS is a useful adrenal
marker of hyperandrogenism. In cases of suspected tumors, levels are
usually in excess of 800 ng/mL.
• Useful as a marker of adrenal hyperandrogenism
Other
• Depending on clinical suspicion, e.g., 1) urinary free cortisol or
overnight dexamethasone suppression test if Cushing’s syndrome is
suspected or 2) IGF-1 if acromegaly suspected, but not routinely

Screening for complications
• Serum lipids, blood glucose, and hemoglobin A1C: All women with PCOS
should have an annual fasting glucose hemoglobin A1C and fasting lipid
proﬁle.
• All women with PCOS who become pregnant should be screened for
gestational diabetes.

233

234

CHAPTER 46

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Management
Weight loss
Studies have uniformly shown that weight reduction in obese women with
PCOS will improve insulin sensitivity and signiﬁcantly reduce hyperandrogenemia. Obese women are less likely to respond to antiandrogens and
infertility treatment.
With weight loss, women with PCOS show improvement in hirsutism
and restoration of menstrual regularity and fertility.

Metformin
In obese and lean insulin-resistant women with PCOS, metformin (1 g,
2 × daily) improves insulin sensitivity with a corresponding reduction in
serum androgen and LH concentrations and an increase in SHBG levels.
Metformin may regulate menstruation by improving ovulatory function
and thus inducing fertility. Frequency of menstruation may be improved
within 3 months of starting therapy. Metformin does not seem to improve
response rates to ovulation induction using clomifene or gonadotropins.
Experience of metformin in pregnancy is limited, so it should be discontinued once pregnancy has been conﬁrmed until further data accrue.
However, it does not appear to be teratogenic.
The effects of metformin seem to be independent of weight reduction,
although the beneﬁts are greatest in obese women when weight reduction
occurs. The effect of metformin on weight loss remains unclear.
There have been few long-term studies looking at the effect of metformin on hirsutism, but it appears that its effects are modest at best, and
most women with signiﬁcant hirsutism will require an antiandrogen.
Women should be warned of its gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. To
minimize these, patients should be started on a low dose (500 mg once
daily) that may be i gradually to a therapeutic dose. A low-fat diet will
decrease side effects and improve response.

Other insulin sensitizers
Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione, another insulin sensitizer that showed
encouraging effects on menstruation and hyperinsulinemia in women with
PCOS. However, it was withdrawn from the market because of liver
toxicity.
In the future, other thiazolidinediones may be used in the treatment of
PCOS, but currently there is insufﬁcient evidence for their use in PCOS.
The thiazolidinediones are associated weight gain and are potentially
teratogenic. Their use is therefore not recommended in women seeking
fertility.

Hirsutism
Pharmacological treatment of hirsutism is directed at slowing the growth
of new hair but has little impact on established hair. It should be combined
with mechanical methods of hair removal, such as electrolysis and laser
therapy. Therapy is most effective when started early.

MANAGEMENT

There is slow improvement over the ﬁrst 6–12 months of treatment.
Patients should be warned that facial hair is slow to respond, treatment is
prolonged, and symptoms may recur after discontinuation of drugs.
Adequate contraception is mandatory during pharmacological treatment of hirsutism because of possible teratogenicity.

Ovarian androgen suppression
Oral contraceptive pill (OCP)
The estrogen component increases SHBG levels and thus reduces free
androgen concentrations; the progestin component inhibits LH secretion
and thus ovarian androgen production.
A birth control pill with a nonandrogenic progestin is recommended
(norgestryl norgestrel ?or similar progestin).
The effect of the OCP alone on hair growth is improved with combination with an antiandrogen.
GnRH analogs
These suppress gonadotropin secretion and thus ovarian androgen
production.
They are rarely used. They cause estrogen deﬁciency so have to be
combined with “add-back” estrogen treatment. Also, they are expensive
and require parenteral administration.
Use is conﬁned to women with severe hyperandrogenism in whom
antiandrogens have been ineffective or not tolerated.

Androgen receptor blockers
These are most effective when combined with oral contraceptives. All are
contraindicated in pregnancy.
They act by competitively inhibiting the binding of testosterone and
dihydrotestosterone to the androgen receptor.
Spironolactone
• Antiandrogen of choice
• Dose: 50–200 mg/day
• Side effects: irregular menstrual bleeding if not combined with the
OCP. A ﬁfth of women complain of GI symptoms when on high doses
of spironolactone. Potassium levels should be monitored if the dose is
100 mg/day or greater, and other potassium-sparing drugs should be
avoided.

Eﬂornithine
This agent irreversibly blocks the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, which
is involved in growth of hair follicles.
It is administered as a topical cream on the face; its long-term use
reduces new hair growth. Studies have shown its efﬁcacy in the management of mild facial hirsutism following at least 8 weeks of treatment.
Treatment should be discontinued if there is no beneﬁt at 4 months.
It is not a depilatory cream and so must be combined with mechanical
methods of hair removal.
Side effects include skin irritation with burning or pruritus, acne,
hypersensitivity.

235

236

CHAPTER 46

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)

Amenorrhea
A minimum of a withdrawal bleed every 3 months minimizes the risk of
endometrial hyperplasia.
Treatment
• OCP with nonandrogenic progestin
• Desogestrel is a relatively new progesterone-only contraceptive
pill with minimal androgenic properties. It may be used to minimize
endometrial hyperplasia in amenorrhoeic women with PCOS.
• Metformin (up to 1 g bid)
Alternatives
A progestin may be added for the latter half of the cycle. However, there
is a risk of exacerbating hirsutism. Less androgenic progestins include
medroxyprogesterone, e.g., 5–10 mg 12 day/month.

Infertility
Ovulation induction regimens are indicated. Obesity adversely affects fertility outcome with poorer pregnancy rates and higher rates of miscarriage, so weight reduction should be strongly encouraged.
Metformin
Use remains controversial but probably does not improve ovulation and
pregnancy rates in insulin-resistant, particularly overweight women with
PCOS. There are no reported teratogenic or neonatal complications.
• Dose: 500 mg od before meals to be i gradually to 1 g bid. If ovulation
is restored following 6 months of treatment, then continue for up to 1
year. If pregnancy does not occur, consider other treatments.
• Side effects: nausea, bloating, diarrhea, vomiting
Clomifene citrate
This inhibits estrogen negative feedback, i FSH secretion, and thus stimulating ovarian follicular growth.
• Dose: 25–150 mg/day from days 5 to 9 of menstrual cycle
• Response rates: 80% of women with PCOS will ovulate, although the
pregnancy rate is only 67% and live births are lower. Recent studies
have shown that treatment with metformin may improve response to
clomifene in resistant cases.
• Complications: 8% twins, 0.1% higher-order multiple pregnancy. Risk of
ovarian neoplasia following prolonged clomifene treatment remains
unclear, so limit treatment to a maximum of 6 cycles.
Gonadotropin preparations
(human menopausal gonadotropin [hMG] or FSH)
These are used in those unresponsive to clomifene. Low-dose regimes
show better response rates and less complications, e.g., 75 IU/day for
2 weeks then increase by 37.5 IU/day every 7 days as required.
• 94% ovulation rate and 40% conception rate after 4 cycles
• Complications: hyperstimulation, multiple pregnancies
• Close ultrasonic monitoring is essential.

MANAGEMENT

Surgery
Surgery is particularly effective in slim women with PCOS and high LH
concentrations.
• Complications: surgical adhesions, although usually mild
In vitro fertilization (IVF)
• In women who fail to respond to ovulation induction
• 60–80% conception rate after 6 cycles

Acne
Treatment for acne should be started as early as possible to prevent scarring. All treatments take up to 12 weeks before signiﬁcant improvement
is seen. All treatments other than benzoyl peroxide are contraindicated
in pregnancy.
Mild to moderate acne
Topical benzoyl peroxide 5% has bactericidal properties. It may be used in
conjunction with oral antibiotic therapy to reduce the risk of developing
resistance to antibiotics
• Side effects: skin irritation and dryness. Add oral antibiotics if no
improvement is seen after 2 months of treatment.
Moderate to severe acne
Topical retinoids, e.g., tretinoin, isotretinoin, are useful alone in mild acne
or in conjunction with antibiotics in moderately severe acne. Continue as
maintenance therapy to prevent further acne outbreaks.
• Side effects: irritation, photosensitivity. Apply high factor sunscreen
before sun exposure. Avoid in acne involving large areas of skin.
Oral antibiotics, e.g., tetracycline 500 mg bid, doxycycline 100 mg od, or
minocycline 100 mg OD can also be used. Response is usually seen by
6 weeks and full efﬁcacy by 3 months. Continue antibiotics for 2 months
after control is achieved. Prescription is usually given for a 3- to 6-month
course. Continue topical retinoids and/or benzoyl peroxide to prevent
further outbreaks.
Spironolactone and birth control pills containing nonandrogenic progestins will improve acne.
Severe acne
Isotretinoin is very effective in women with severe acne or acne that has
not responded to other oral or topical treatments. Used early it can minimize scarring in inﬂammatory acne. However, it is highly toxic and can
only be prescribed by a dermatologist.

PATHOGENESIS

Congenital adrenal
hyperplasia (CAH) in adults

Deﬁnition
CAH is an inherited group of disorders characterized by a deﬁciency of
one of the enzymes necessary for cortisol biosynthesis. More than 90% of
cases are due to 21A-hydroxylase deﬁciency.
There is a wide clinical spectrum, from presentation in the neonatal
period with salt wasting and virilization to nonclassic CAH in adulthood.
CAH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

Epidemiology
• Wide racial variations, most common in those of Jewish origin
• Carrier frequency of classic CAH: 1:60 in white people
• Carrier frequency of nonclassic CAH: 19% in Ashkenazi Jews, 13.5% in
Hispanics, 6% in Italians, and 3% in other Caucasian populations

Pathogenesis
Genetics
CYP21 encodes for the 21A-hydroxylase enzyme, located on the short arm
of chromosome 6 (chromosome 6p21.3). In close proximity is the CYP21
pseudogene, with 90% homology but no functional activity.
21A-Hydroxylase deﬁciency results from gene mutations, partial gene
deletions, or gene conversions in which sequences from the pseudogene
are transferred to the active gene, rendering it inactive.
There is a correlation between the severity of the molecular defect and
the clinical severity of the disorder. Nonclassic CAH is usually due to a
point mutation (single base change); missense mutations result in simple
virilizing disease, whereas a gene conversion or partial deletion usually
results in presentation in infancy with salt wasting or severe virilization.

239

240

CHAPTER 47

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

Biochemistry
b See Fig. 47.1.
21A-Hydroxylase deﬁciency results in aldosterone and cortisol deﬁciency. There is ACTH oversecretion because of the loss of negative
feedback, and this causes adrenocortical hyperplasia and excessive accumulation of 17-hydroxy progesterone (17OHP) and other steroid precursors. These are then shunted into androgen synthesis pathways, resulting
in testosterone and androstenedione excess.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Clinical presentation
Classic CAH
Most patients are diagnosed in infancy; their clinical presentation is discussed elsewhere (b see Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, p. 239).
Problems persisting into adulthood include sexual dysfunction and subfertility in women, particularly in salt wasters. Reconstructive genital surgery is required in the majority of women who were virilized at birth to
create an adequate vaginal introitus. With improvement of medical and
surgical care, pregnancy rates have improved. Fertility rates of 60–80%
have been reported in women with classic CAH.
In men, high levels of adrenal androgens suppress gonadotropins and
thus testicular function. Spermatogenesis may therefore be affected if
CAH is poorly controlled.
Suboptimally controlled CAH in men also predisposes them to developing testicular adrenal rests. These are always benign but may be misdiagnosed as testicular tumors.

Nonclassic CAH
Nonclassic CAH is due to partial deﬁciency of 21A-hydroxylase.
Glucocorticoid and aldosterone production are normal, but there is overproduction of 17OHP and, thus, androgens.
Patients present with hirsutism (60%), acne (33%), and oligomenorrhea
(54%), often around the onset of puberty. Only 13% of women present
with subfertility.
One-third of women have polycystic ovaries on US, and adrenal incidentalomas or hyperplasia is seen in 40%.
The nonclassic form is asymptomatic in men. The effect of nonclassic
CAH on men fertility is unknown.

241

242

CHAPTER 47

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

Laboratory evaluation
Because of the diurnal variation in adrenal hormonal secretion, all investigations should be performed in the morning.

Diagnosis of non-classic CAH—17OHP measurement
Timing of measurement
• Screen in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. 17OHP is
produced by the corpus luteum, so false-positive results may occur if
measured in the luteal phase of the cycle.
• Must be measured A.M . to avoid false-negative results, as 17OHP has a
diurnal variation similar to that of ACTH
ACTH stimulation test
• Measure 17OHP 30 minutes after ACTH administration.
• An exaggerated rise in 17OHP is seen in nonclassic CAH.
• 17OHP level <1000 ng/dL post-ACTH excludes the diagnosis.
• Most patients have levels >1500 ng/dL.
• Levels of 1000–1500 ng/dL suggest heterozygosity or nonclassic CAH.
• Cortisol response to ACTH stimulation is usually low to normal.

Other investigations
Androgens
In poorly controlled classic CAH in women, testosterone and androstenedione levels may be in the adult male range. Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels are usually only mildly, and not consistently, elevated in CAH.
Circulating testosterone and, particularly androstenedione, are elevated
in nonclassic CAH, but there is a large overlap with levels seen in PCOS
so serum androgen concentrations cannot be used to distinguish between
the disorders.
Renin
Plasma renin levels are markedly elevated in 75% of patients with inadequately treated classic CAH, reﬂecting deﬁcient aldosterone production.
A proportion of women with nonclassic CAH may also have mildly
elevated renin concentrations.
ACTH
• Greatly elevated in poorly controlled classic CAH
• Usually normal levels in nonclassic CAH

CHAPTER 47

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

Management
The aims of treatment of CAH in adulthood are as follows:
• To maintain normal energy levels and weight and avoid adrenal crises
in all patients
• To minimize hyperandrogenism and to restore regular menses and
fertility in women
• To avoid glucocorticoid over-replacement
• To treat stress with adequate extra glucocorticoid

Classic CAH
Prednisone
A total dose is 5–7.5 mg/day. This is given in one dose, either in the morning or at bedtime depending on the authority. There are no controlled
studies comparing the two regimens. The evening dosing is to suppress
the early-morning peak of ACTH and thus androgen secretion. The optimum dose is the minimum dose required to normalize serum androgens.
Occasional patients who are not controlled on prednisone may be
treated with nocturnal dexamethasone instead (0.25–0.5 mg).
Other therapies
As with other forms of adrenal insufﬁciency, glucocorticoid doses should be
doubled during illness, as discussed in detail elsewhere (b p. 337, 363).
Three-quarters of patients are salt wasters and thus require mineralocorticoid replacement therapy. Fludrocortisone in a dose of 50–200 mcg/
day is given as a single daily dose. The aim is to keep plasma renin levels
in the mid-normal range.
Bilateral adrenalectomy may very occasionally be considered in patients
with severe virilization resistant to conventional therapy.
Experimental therapies
Trials have been performed using a combination of low-dose hydrocortisone, ﬂudrocortisone, testolactone (an aromatase inhibitor), and ﬂutamide (antiandrogen) in children. This 4-drug regimen appears to improve
ﬁnal height and minimize glucocorticoid side effects with no signiﬁcant
adverse effects. However, long-term effects are currently unknown.
Pregnancy
Screen the patient and her partner prior to pregnancy and give genetic
advice. If the partner is a carrier, there is a 50% risk of having an affected
child (1 in 63 is a carrier of the 21OH gene).

Nonclassic CAH
Oligo- and amenorrhea are treated with glucocorticoid therapy—e.g.,
noctural dexamethasone 0.25–0.5 mg or prednisone 2.5–5 mg/day, may
be used. Slightly higher doses may be required to normalize ovulatory
function.
If fertility is not desired, symptoms may be treated with OCPs and
antiandrogen.

MANAGEMENT

Hirsutism and acne may be treated using OCPs (b see Management,
p. 237). Spironolactone should be avoided because of the potential risk of
salt wasting and thus hyperreninemia.
If the plasma renin level is elevated, then ﬂudrocortisone given in a
dose sufﬁcient to normalize renin concentrations may improve adrenal
hyperandrogenism.
Men do not usually require treatment. The occasional man may need
glucocorticoids to treat subfertility.

Management of pregnancy in CAH
Indications for prenatal treatment
• Maternal classic CAH: Screen patient and partner using basal ± ACTHstimulated 17OHP levels (b see Investigations, p. 242). If levels
are elevated, proceed to genotyping. If heterozygote, then prenatal
treatment of the fetus is recommended.
• Previous child from same partner with CAH
Aims of prenatal treatment (b see Fig. 47.2)
The aim is to prevent virilization of an affected female fetus.
Treatment (commenced before 10 weeks gestation)
Dexamethasone (20 mcg/kg maternal body weight) in 3 divided doses a
day crosses the placenta and reduces fetal adrenal hyperandrogenism.
Discontinue treatment if the fetus is male.
Outcome
From 50 to 75% of affected women do not require reconstructive surgery.

Start dexamethasone 20 mcg/kg per day (prepregnancy weight)
Best results if started at 4–6 weeks, certainly before week 9 of gestation

CHAPTER 47

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia

Complications
There are no known fetal congenital malformations or neonanatal complications from dexamethasone treatment.
Subtle effects of glucocorticoids on neuropsychological function are
unknown. No signiﬁcant long-term follow-up studies on treated children
have been published to date.
Maternal complications of glucocorticoid excess include mood swings,
weight gain, gestational diabetes, and hypertension. Monitor maternal
weight, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and urinary glucose.
There is debate about whether women with nonclassic CAH should
be offered prenatal treatment with dexamethasone. There have been no
cases of women with nonclassic CAH giving birth to a virilized female.
Additionally, the estimated risk of conceiving an infant with classic CAH
is 1:1000. As the risk of fetal virilization is therefore low, dexamethasone
treatment of this group of women seems unwarranted. However, these
infants should be screened in the neonatal period by measuring 17OHP
levels.

Monitoring of treatment
Annual follow-up is usually adequate in adults.
• Clinical assessment: Look for evidence of hyperandrogenism and
glucocorticoid excess. Amenorrhea in women usually suggests
inadequate therapy. Measure BP.
• 17OHP: Aim for a mildly elevated level (about 2–4 x normal).
Normalizing 17OHP will result in complications from
supraphysiological doses of glucocorticoids.
• Plasma rennin: Aim for renin in mid-normal range. Hyperandrogenism
will be difﬁcult to control if the patient is mildly salt depleted (ACTH
production stimulated by hypovolemia).
• Androgens: Aim to normalize serum testosterone/androstenedione
taken before A.M . steroids.
• Consider bone density, which may be reduced by supraphysiological
steroid doses.
In females:
• Good control ensures fertility.
• Testes should be intermittently checked for masses—adrenal cell rests.

PROGNOSIS

Prognosis
Adults with treated CAH have a normal life expectancy. Improvement in
medical and surgical care has also improved quality of life (QoL) for most
sufferers. However, there are a few unresolved issues.

Height
Despite optimal treatment in childhood, patients with CAH are, on average, signiﬁcantly shorter than their predicted genetic height. Studies suggest that this may be due to overtreatment with glucocorticoids during
infancy.

Fertility
Fertility remains reduced in women with CAH, particularly in salt wasters,
from factors including inadequate vaginal introitus and anovulation secondary to both hyperandrogenism and high 17OHP levels.
Fertility may also be affected in men with poorly controlled classic
CAH.

Adrenal incidentalomas and testicular adrenal rest tumors
Benign adrenal adenomas have been reported in up to 50% of patients
with classic CAH. Men with CAH may develop adrenal rests. These are
ACTH-responsive and should be treated by optimizing glucocorticoid
therapy.
Occasionally, adults with nonclassic CAH develop adrenal adenomas or
testicular rests and should then be started on steroids.

EPIDEMIOLOGY AND PATHOLOGY

Androgen-secreting tumors

Deﬁnition
These rare tumors of the ovary or adrenal gland may be benign or malignant and cause virilization in women through androgen production.

Epidemiology and pathology
Androgen-secreting ovarian tumors
Three-quarters develop before the age of 40 years. They account for 0.4%
of all ovarian tumors. 20% are malignant.
Tumors are variable in size. The larger they are, the more likely they are
to be malignant. They are rarely bilateral. There are two major types:
• Sex cord stromal cell tumors often contain testicular cell types.
• Adrenal-like tumors often contain adrenocortical or Leydig cells.
Other tumors, e.g., gonadoblastomas and teratomas, may also on occasion
present with virilization.

Androgen-secreting adrenal tumors
Half of these tumors develop before the age of 50 years. Larger tumors,
particularly >6 cm, are more likely to be malignant.

249

250

CHAPTER 48

Androgen-secreting tumors

Clinical features
Onset of symptoms
• Usually recent onset of rapidly progressive symptoms
Hyperandrogenism
• Hirsutism of varying degree, often severe (Ferriman–Gallwey score)
(b see Table 45.2, p. 225). Male-pattern balding and acne are also
common.
• Usually oligo- or amenorrhea
• Infertility may be a presenting feature.
Virilization (b Box 45.1, p. 224)
• Indicates severe hyperandrogenism is associated with clitoromegaly
and is present in 98% of women with androgen-producing tumors. Not
usually a feature of PCOS
Other
• Abdominal pain
• Palpable abdominal mass
• Ascites
• Symptoms and signs of Cushing’s syndrome are present in 50% of
females with adrenal tumors.

PROGNOSIS

Management
Surgery
• Adrenalectomy or ovarian cystectomy/oophorectomy
• Curative in benign lesions

Adjunctive therapy
Malignant ovarian and adrenal androgen-secreting tumors are often resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.

Prognosis
Benign tumors
Prognosis is excellent. Hirsutism improves postoperatively, but clitoromegaly, male-pattern balding, and deep voice may persist.

Malignant tumors
• Adrenal tumors: 20% 5-year survival. Most patients have metastatic
disease at the time of surgery
• Ovarian tumors: 30% disease-free survival; 40% overall 5-year survival

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Premature ovarian
insufﬁciency (POI)

Deﬁnition
POI is a disorder characterized by amenorrhea, estrogen deﬁciency, and
elevated gonadotropins developing in women <40 years as a result of loss
of ovarian follicular function.

Epidemiology
Incidence is 0.1% of women <30 years and 1% of those <40 years. POI
accounts for 10% of all cases of secondary amenorrhea.

Causes of POI
• Chromosomal abnormalities (60%) (see Table 50.1)
• Turner’s syndrome (see Box 50.1)
• Fragile x syndrome
• Other x chromosomal abnormalities
• Gene mutations
• B subunit of FSH
• FSH receptor
• LH receptor
• Autoimmune disease (20%)
• Iatrogenic
• Chemotherapy
• Radiotherapy
• Hysterectomy
• Other
• Familial ovarian failure
• Galactosemia
• Enzyme deﬁciencies, e.g., 17-hydroxylase deﬁciency.
• Infections, e.g., mumps, CMV, HIV, Shigella
• Idiopathic
• ?Environmental toxin

Follow-up
• Baseline renal US, thyroid autoantibodies
• Annual BMI, BP, TFT, lipids, fasting blood glucose liver function
• 3- to 5-yearly echocardiogram and bone densitometry
• Hearing loss every 5 years

PATHOGENESIS

Pathogenesis
Failure of normal ovarian follicular response to gonadotropins leads to
consequent failure of ovarian steroidogenesis. POI is the result of either
ovarian follicle depletion or failure of the follicles to function (resistant
ovary syndrome). It may be distinguished by ovarian US or histologically
by ovarian biopsy.
Treatment options are the same, so invasive techniques looking for the
presence of follicles are not indicated.
POI is usually permanent; however, more data show a variable intermittent pattern of hormone production. Additionally, <50% of karyotypically
normal women with established disease produce estrogen intermittently
and up to a 1/5 of women may ovulate despite high gonadotropin levels.
Spontaneous pregnancy has been reported in 5%.

CHAPTER 50

Premature ovarian insufﬁciency (POI)

Clinical presentation
Amenorrhea
• May be primary, particularly in those with chromosomal abnormalities
Symptoms of estrogen deﬁciency
• Not present in those with primary amenorrhea
• 75% of women who develop secondary amenorrhea report hot
ﬂushes, night sweats, mood changes, fatigue, or dyspareunia; symptoms
may precede the onset of menstrual disturbances.
Autoimmune disease
• Screen for symptoms and signs of associated autoimmune disorders.
Other
• Past history of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, or pelvic surgery
• Positive family history in 10% of patients

Box 50.2 Autoimmune diseases and POI
Autoimmune disease is responsible for 20% of all cases of POI. A second
autoimmune disorder is present in 10–40% of women with autoimmune
POI:
• Addison’s disease (10%)
• Autoimmune thyroid disease (25%)
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus (2%)
• Myaesthenia gravis (2%)
• B12 deﬁciency
• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is also more common
POI is present in the following:
• 60% of 5 with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1
(b p. 198)
• 25% of 5 with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2
(b p. 199)

Steroid cell antibodies are positive in 60–100% of patients with Addison’s
disease in combination with POI. Presence of positive steroid cell antibodies in women with Addison’s disease confers a 40% risk of ultimately developing POI. Other ovarian antibodies have no predictive value.

LABORATORY EVALUATION

Laboratory evaluation
Serum gonadotropins
• Diagnosis is conﬁrmed by serum FSH >40 mIU/L (actual level depends
on the assay) on at least two occasions at least 1 month apart
associated with a low estradiol.
• Disease may have a ﬂuctuating course with high FSH levels returning
to normal and later regaining of ovulatory function.
• LH is also elevated; FSH is usually disproportionately higher than LH.
Serum estradiol levels
• Usually low
Karyotype
• All women below age 40 presenting with hypergonadotropic
amenorrhea should have karyotyping performed.
• Women with Y-chromosomal material should be referred for bilateral
gonadectomy to prevent the development of gonadoblastoma.
Pelvic US
• To identify normal ovarian and uterine morphology
Transvaginal US
• Ovarian volume and blood ﬂow
• Uterine size and anatomy
Bone mineral density
• Risk of osteoporosis
Screen for autoimmune disease
• Thyroid and adrenal cortex autoantibodies. If positive, this increases
the risk of progression to overt adrenal or thyroid insufﬁciency.
• Ovarian antibodies are of no proven clinical value.
• TSH and fasting blood glucose, FBC
• Cosyntropin stimulation test only if adrenal insufﬁciency is suspected
clinically
• Other tests as clinically indicated
Ovarian biopsy
• Not indicated

Annual assessment of women with POI
Assess adequacy of sex hormone replacement therapy:
• Tolerance and compliance
• Side effects and complications
• Persistent symptoms of sex hormone deﬁciency
Address fertility issues.
Screen for other autoimmune disease (in autoimmune POI):
• Clinical evaluation
• TSH and fasting blood glucose
• Cosyntropin stimulation test if clinically indicated.
Screen for complications:
• Osteoporosis
• Cardiovascular disease

CHAPTER 50

Premature ovarian insufﬁciency (POI)

Management
Sex hormone replacement therapy
Exogenous estrogens (hormone replacement therapy [HT]) are required
to alleviate symptoms and prevent the long-term complications of estrogen deﬁciency—osteoporosis and possibly cardiovascular disease (b see
Table 50.2).
In non-hysterectomized women, a progestagen should be added for
12–14 days a month to prevent endometrial hyperplasia.
Low-dose androgen replacement therapy may improve persistent
fatigue and poor libido despite adequate estrogen replacement.
Oral contraceptives are an alternative convenient approach to HT in
younger women with POI.

Fertility
A minority of women with POI and a normal karyotype will recover spontaneously. There is a 5% spontaneous fertility rate.
Oocyte donation and in vitro fertilization offer these women their best
chance of fertility. Results are promising, with a pregnancy rate of 35%
per patient. Results are less good in women with chemotherapy-induced
gonadal damage or after pelvic radiotherapy.
Ovulation induction therapy has been tried, but the results have been
poor. Glucocorticoid therapy has been used in autoimmune POI, but efﬁcacy is poor.

PROGNOSIS

There is currently much research into the removal of functioning ovarian tissue in women prior to undergoing cancer chemotherapy followed
by its cryopreservation with the aim of reimplantation at a later stage
when fertility is required.
Research into this technique is still in its infancy so if considered, patients
and their families must be counseled about the uncertainty of future success rates associated with ovarian cryopreservation.
Recent improvements in methods of oocyte cryopreservation using
rapid freezing in liquid nitrogen (vitriﬁcation) have allowed women with
high chance of POI (e.g., before chemo- or radiotherapy) to store oocytes
collected after superovulation. However, this is also experimental, and
quoted success rates are 20–30% per patient and depend on age and egg
quality at the time of collection.
b See Chapter 51, Menopause, p. 264–274, for a full review of hormone therapy.

Prognosis
Mortality of women with POI left untreated may be i 2-fold.
Estrogen deﬁciency leads to the following:
• i Risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease
• i Risk of osteoporosis. Up to 2/3 of women with POI and a normal
karyotype have d bone mineral density (BMD), with a z score of –1 or
less despite at least intermittent HT. This may be due to a combination
of factors, including an initial delay in initiating HT, poor compliance
with HT, and estrogen “underdosing.”

CHAPTER 51

Menopause

Menopause

Deﬁnition
The menopause is the permanent cessation of menstruation as a result of
ovarian failure (see Box 51.1) and is a retrospective diagnosis made after
12 months of amenorrhea. The average age of women at the time of the
menopause is 750 years, although smokers reach the menopause 72 years
earlier.
The perimenopause encompasses the menopause transition and the ﬁrst
year following the last menstrual period.

Box 51.1 Physiology
The physiology of the menopause remains poorly understood. Ovaries
have a ﬁnite number of germ cells, with maximal numbers at 20 weeks of
intrauterine life. Thereafter, there is a gradual reduction in the number
of follicles until the perimenopause when there is an exponential loss
of oocytes until the store is depleted at the time of the menopause.
Table 51.1 summarizes hormonal changes during the menopausal
transition.
Inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are ovarian glycoprotiens
produced by follicles as they develop from pre-antral to antral stages.
Both may participate in ovarian paracrine regulation and, with other
molecules, regulate the rate of attrition of follicles. Inhibin B and AMH
fall with ovarian aging, before any detectable rise in FSH, and are thus
early markers of incipient ovarian failure and onset of perimenopause.
In the early perimenopausal period, FSH levels ﬂuctuate, but the gradual rise in FSH levels maintains estradiol production by the ovarian follicles. So, contrary to previous belief, average serum estradiol levels may
be high at the onset of the meno-pause transition, falling only toward the
end as the follicles are depleted.

CHAPTER 51

Menopause

Long-term consequences
• Osteoporosis: During the perimenopausal period there is an accelerated
loss of BMD, with postmenopausal women being more susceptible to
osteoporotic fractures.
• Ischemic heart disease (IHD): Postmenopausal women are 2–3 x more
likely to develop IHD than are premenopausal women, even after
age adjustments. The menopause is associated with an increase in
risk factors for atherosclerosis, including less favorable lipid proﬁle, d
insulin sensitivity, and an i thrombotic tendency.
• Dementia: Women are 2–3 x more likely to develop Alzheimer disease
than men. It is suggested that estrogen deﬁciency may play a role in
the development of dementia.

Clinical presentation
There are marked cultural differences in the frequency of symptoms
related to the menopause. In particular, vasomotor symptoms and mood
disturbances are more commonly reported in Western countries.
Menstrual disturbances (90%)
Cycles gradually become increasingly anovulatory and variable in length
from about 4 years prior to the menopause. Oligomenorrhea often precedes permanent amenorrhea. In 10% of women, menses cease abruptly
with no preceding transitional period.
Hot ﬂashes (40%)
These are often associated with sweats and skin ﬂushing. They are highly
variable and thought to be related to ﬂuctuations in estrogen concentrations. They tend to resolve spontaneously within 5 years of menopause.
Urinary symptoms (50%)
There is atrophy of urethral and bladder mucosa after the menopause
and d sensitivity of A-adrenergic receptors of the bladder neck in the
perimenopausal period. This may result in urinary incontinence and an i
risk of urinary tract infections.
Sexual dysfunction (40%)
Vaginal atrophy may result in dyspareunia and vaginal dryness. Additionally,
falling androgen levels may reduce sexual arousal and libido.
Mood changes (25–50%)
Anxiety, memory problems, difﬁculty in concentration, and irritability have
all been attributed to the menopause. Women with a history of affective disorders are at i risk of mood disturbances in the perimenopausal
period.

Investigations
FSH levels ﬂuctuate markedly in the perimenopausal period and correlate
poorly with symptoms. A raised FSH in the perimenopausal period may
not necessarily indicate infertility, so contraception, if desired, should continue until the menopause.
Mammography is indicated prior to starting estrogen replacement therapy and then following national guidelines.
Endometrial biopsy does not need to be performed routinely but is used
in women with abnormal uterine bleeding and an abnormal US.

CHAPTER 51

Menopause

Hormone replacement therapy (HT)
The aim of treatment of postmenopausal women is to alleviate menopausal symptoms. HT is no longer indicated for the prevention of chronic
disease in postmenopausal women.
However, women who have POI should receive HT unless there is an
absolute contraindication, until the age of 50 years.

Beneﬁts of HT
Hot ﬂashes
These respond well to estrogen therapy in a dose-dependent manner.
Start with a low dose and increase gradually as required to control symptoms. Higher doses may be required after hysterectomy, particularly in
younger women.
For 75% of women, vasomotor symptoms are resolved, so the dose is
tapered to the lowest one to control symptoms. The dose of HT should
be gradually reduced over weeks, as sudden withdrawal of estrogen may
precipitate the return of vasomotor symptoms.
In women with a contraindication to HT or who are intolerant of it,
nonhormonal therapies are available, summarized in Table 51.2.
Urinary symptoms
A trial of HT, local or systemic, may improve stress and urge incontinence
as well as the frequency of cystitis.

Symptom

Management

Vasomotor
symptoms

Venlafaxine (75 mg od), paroxetine (20 mg od), and
ﬂuoxetine (20 mg od) have been shown to signiﬁcantly
reduce the frequency and severity of hot ﬂashes, with
minimal side effects.
Gabapentin (300 mg tid) has also been shown to reduce
the frequency and severity of hot ﬂashes. Side effects
include dizziness, somnolescence, and weight gain.
Megestrol acetate in a dose of 20 mg bid also reduces
hot ﬂashes by up to 70%, but its use is limited by side
effects, particularly weight gain.
Clonidine is less effective, reducing the occurrence of
ﬂushes by 20%, and is often associated with disabling side
effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and dry mouth.

Genitourinary
symptoms

Vaginal lubri-cants, e.g., Replens®

Osteoporosis

Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), e.g.,
raloxifene; however, these may exacerbate vasomotor
symptoms if present.
Bisphosphonates, e.g., alendronic acid and risedronate

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HT)

Vaginal atrophy
Systemic or local estrogen therapy improves vaginal dryness and dyspareunia. A maximum of 6 months’ use of vaginal cream is recommended
unless combined with a progestin, as systemic absorption may increase the
risk of endometrial hyperplasia.
An estradiol vaginal ring (Estring®) has little stimulatory effect on
endometrial tissue and does not increase serum estradiol concentrations.
Concomitant progestin therapy is therefore not necessary. If estrogens
are contraindicated, then vaginal moisturizers, e.g., Replens®, may help.
Osteoporosis
HT has been shown to increase BMD in the lumbar spine by 3–5%/year
and at the femoral neck by about 2%/year by inhibiting bone resorption.
There is an associated 30–50% reduction in fracture risk, protection being
highest in women on HT for at least 10 years.
The Women’s Health Initiative trial (WHI) conﬁrmed that HT reduces
the risk of both hip and vertebral fractures by a third. Timing of initiation
of treatment to achieve maximal bone protection remains controversial.
Evidence suggests that initiation of HT soon after the menopause is
associated with the lowest hip fracture risk, but discontinuation of HT
ultimately results in bone loss to pretreatment levels.
Colorectal cancer
Observational studies have shown that HT may protect against colon cancer. This has been conﬁrmed by WHI, which showed a 20% reduction in
the incidence of colon cancer in HT users. However, HT should currently
not be prescribed solely to prevent colorectal cancer.

Risks of HT (see Box 51.2)
Breast cancer
No personal or family history of breast cancer
There is an i risk of breast cancer in HT users, which is related to the
duration of use. The risk increases by 35% following 5 years of use and falls
to never-used risk 5 years after discontinuing HT.
For women aged 50 not using HT, about 45 in every 1000 will have
cancer diagnosed over the following 20 years, that is, up to age 70. This
number increases to 47/1000 women using HT for 5 years, 51/1000 using

Menopause

HT for 10 years, and 57/1000 after 15 years of use. The risk is highest in
women on combined HT compared with estrogens alone.
Mortality has not been shown to be i in breast cancer developing in
women on HT.
Family history of breast cancer
Risk of breast cancer may be i 4-fold as a result of family history, but
there is little evidence that the risk is i further by the use of HT. HT may
be used short term at lower doses in these women if severe vasomotor
symptoms are present, after counseling regarding the above risks.
Past history of breast cancer
Avoid HT in women with a past history of breast cancer.
Venous thromboembolism (DVT)
HT increases the risk approximately 3-fold, resulting in an extra
2 cases/10,000 woman-years. The risk is highest in the ﬁrst year of use of
HT and has been shown to be halved by aspirin or statin therapy.
This risk is i in women who already have risk factors for DVT, including
previous DVT, cardiovascular disease, and within 90 days of hospitalization. Many suggest discontinuation of HT with any hospitalization.
Low-risk women
• Absolute risk remains small—30 per 100,000 women.
• Stop HT during immobilization or use prophylactic anticoagulation.
Family history of DVT
If HT is being considered because of severe vasomotor symptoms, do a
thrombophilia screen. If positive, then avoid HT or use it with anticoagulation therapy.
Women with a positive family history of thromboembolism are still at a
slightly i risk themselves, even if the results of the thrombophilia screen
are negative, so prescribe HT with caution after counseling the patient.
Transdermal E2 may be preferable.
Past history of DVT/PE
Risk of recurrence is 5% per year, so avoid HT unless the patient is on
long-term warfarin therapy.
Cerebrovascular disease
HT has been shown to increase the risk of ischemic stroke in older women,
particularly in the presence of atrial ﬁbrillation. HT should therefore not
be used in women with a history of cerebrovascular disease or atrial ﬁbrillation unless they are anticoagulated.
Endometrial cancer
There is no i risk in women taking continuous com-bined HT preparations. Women using sequential combined preparations do not appear to
have an i risk of endometrial cancer initially, but the risk of endometrial
hyperplasia does increase with long-term use (>5 years) despite regular
withdrawal bleeds, so these women need regular follow-up.
Women with cured stage I tumors may safely take HT.

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HT)

Ovarian cancer
It is unclear if HT may be associated with an i risk of ovarian cancer.
A couple of large casecontrol studies have shown anrisk of ovarian cancer in long-term (>10 years) users of unopposed estrogen replacement
therapy.
There are few data available on the risk of ovarian cancer in women
taking combined HT. However, studies have also shown that HT does not
have a negative effect in ovarian cancer survivors.
Gallstones
The risk of gallstones is i 2-fold in HT users.
Migraine
Migraines may increase in severity and frequency in HT users. A trial of HT
is still worthwhile if indications are present, providing there are no focal
neurological signs associated with the migraine. Modiﬁcation in the dose
of estrogen or its preparation may improve symptoms.
Endometriosis and uterine ﬁbroids
The risk of recurrence of endometriosis or of growth of uterine ﬁbroids
is low on HT.
Liver disease
Use transdermal estrogens to avoid hepatic metabolism and monitor liver
function in women with impaired liver function tests. Do not use HT in the
presence of active liver disease or liver failure.

Areas of uncertainty with HT
Cardiovascular disease (CVD)
Data from >30 observational studies suggest that HT may reduce the risk
of developing CVD by up to 50%. However, randomized placebo-controlled trials, e.g., the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study
(HERS) and the WHI trial, have failed to show that HT protects against
CVD.
Currently, HT should not be prescribed to prevent cardiovascular disease. Analysis of the WHI showed that women 50–59 had cardiac protection on HT, whereas older women had increased risk. These data support
the primary prevention hypothesis.
Alzheimer disease
Recent evidence suggests that the risk of developing Alzheimer disease
may be reduced by up to 50% in women receiving HT, particularly if
started early in the menopause.
However, in women with established Alzheimer disease, there is no
evidence to suggest reversal of cognitive dysfunction following initiation of
HT. There is currently insufﬁcient evidence to recommend the use of HT
to prevent Alzheimer disease.
In postmenopausal women without dementia, HT may improve certain
aspects of cognitive function.

271

272

CHAPTER 51

Menopause

Mood disturbances
There has been a strongly held belief that HT improves well-being and
QoL in perimenopausal and post-menopausal women. However, in recent
trials in which QoL was assessed, notably HERS and WHI, in women many
years after menopause, the improvement in QoL and improved sleep was
only seen in women with vasomotor symptoms.

Side effects commonly associated with HT
Breast tenderness usually subsides within 4–6 months of use. If troublesome, use a lower estrogen dose and increase it gradually.
Mood changes commonly associated with progestin therapy can be managed by changing the dose or preparation of progestin.
Irregular vaginal bleeding may be a problem in women on a continuous combined preparation. It usually subsides after 6–12 months of treatment. Spotting persists in 10%; patients may change to a cyclic preparation.
b See Box 51.3.

Summary of WHI trial
• WHI was a ran-domized, controlled trial of effects of continuous
combined conjugated estrogen and medroxyprogesterone acetate on
healthy postmenopausal women, with a mean follow-up 5.2 years.
• Mean age was 63 years, with 66% of women >60 years of age.
• 70% of partici-pants were overweight or obese and 50% were current
or past smokers.
• Absolute risk was highest in the older age group (>65 years).

Box 51.3 Whom and how to investigate for irregular
uterine bleeding
Sequential cyclical HT
• Three or more cycles of bleeding before the ninth day of progestin
therapy or change in the duration or intensity of uterine bleeding
Continuous combined HT
• In ﬁrst 12 months if bleeding is heavy or extended, if it continues
after 12 months of use, or if it starts after a period of amenorrhea
Endometrial assessment
• Essential in women with irregular uterine bleeding. Vaginal US,
looking at endometrial thickness, is a sensitive method of detecting
endometrial disease.
Endometrial thickness of <5 mm excludes disease in 96–99% of cases, a
sensitivity similar to that of endometrial biopsy.
However, speciﬁcity is poor, so if the endometrium is >5 mm (as it
will be in 50% of postmenopausal women on HT), endometrial biopsy
will be required to rule out carcinoma

HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY (HT)

• Results of WHI cannot be extrapolated to younger HT users
(<55 years of age).
• It is unclear whether different HT preparations or routes of
administration would necessarily have the same beneﬁt/risk pro-ﬁle.

Dietary phytoestrogens
Phytoestrogens are found in foods such as soybeans, cereals, and seeds.
Although they have estrogen-like activity, data from clinical trials are conﬂicting. It appears that the effect of phytoestrogens on vasomotor symptoms is modest at best.
Research does suggest that soy protein has a favorable effect on plasma
lipid concentrations and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.
However, the actual daily dose required is unclear.
Finally, data regarding the effect of phytoestrogens on bone loss and breast
cancer risk are inconclusive. Phytoestrogen supplements cannot therefore
be recommended for the prevention of chronic disease in peri- and postmenopausal women until they are adequately evaluated in clinical trials.

HT regimens
Estrogen preparations
b See Table 51.3. Only symptomatic women should be treated with HT
and dose tapered to the lowest dose to control symptoms.
Route of administration
Oral route is the most popular. Disadvantages are as follows:
• First-pass hepatic metabolism means that plasma estrogen levels are
variable.
• Transdermal patches avoid the ﬁrst-pass effect and are thus ideal in
women with liver disease or hypertriglyceridemia. Additionally, patches
provide constant systemic hormone levels. However, 10% of women
develop skin reactions. Patients should try to avoid moisture and
rotate patch sites to limit side effects.
• Gels have the advantages of patches, but skin irritation is less common.
Progestin preparations
b See Table 51.4. These must be added in non-hysterectomized women
to avoid endometrial hyperplasia and subsequent carcinoma.
Sequential cyclical regimen
Give progestin for a minimum of 12 days a month. It is usually given for
the ﬁrst 12 days of each calendar month. As the estrogen dose is tapered,

intermittent progestin 4 × a year may be feasible. However, the risk of
endometrial hyperplasia on such a regimen is unknown.
Ninety percent of women have a monthly withdrawal bleed; 10% may
be amenorrheic with no harmful consequences. Bleeding should start after
the ninth day of progestin therapy.
Continuous combined regimen
Lower doses of progestin are given on a daily basis. Uterine bleeding is
usually light in amount but timing is unpredictable. Bleeding should stop in
90% of women within 12 months, in the majority in 6 months.
This regimen is suggested for older women who do not want monthly
withdrawal bleeds, but in the WHI trial continuous combined therapy was
associated with i risk of breast cancer.
The impact of other forms of HT is unknown.

INTRODUCTION

Oral contraceptive
pill (OCP)

Introduction
The OCP is very effective contraception, with approximately 5 per 100
users becoming pregnant per year.
Ethinylestradiol (EE2)
• The standard dose is 30 mcg, but in older women or those with
possible cardiovascular risk factors, 20 mcg EE2 may be appropriate.
• A dose of 50 mcg EE2 may be indicated in patients on antiepileptic
medication but is otherwise associated with an excess risk of arterial
and venous thromboembolism.
Progestin
• Commonly used OCPs contain second-generation progestagens, such
as levonorgestrel (150–250 mg) and norethisterone or norithindrone
(1 mg).
• OCPs containing third-generation progestagens (e.g., norgestimate
and desogestrel) are less androgenic; however, they may be associated
with an i risk of thromboembolism.
• Yasmin® contains a new progestagen, drospirenone, which is derived
from spironolactone. It therefore has antimineralocorticoid activity. It
may have antiandrogenic properties.
For a list of OCP preparations b see Box 52.1.

Beneﬁts
Ovarian cancer
The risks of ovarian cancer are halved in women who have been taking
the OCP for 5 years or more. This risk reduction persists long after discontinuation of the OCP.

Acne
The OCP reduces free testosterone concentrations by suppressing ovarian production of androgens and by i hepatic SHBG production. OCP
with low androgenic progestins often result in an improvement in acne.

Menstrual disorders
OCPs are associated with reduced menstrual ﬂow and can therefore
improve menorrhagia. They also reduce dysmenorrhea.

RISKS

Risks
Venous thromboembolism
The risk of venous thromboembolism in nonpregnant women (5 per
100,000 women per year) is i 3-fold in women on the OCP. The risk
is highest in the ﬁrst year of use, increases with age, and is i in obese
women.
The risk of venous thromboembolism appears to be higher in women
taking OCPs containing desogestrel or gestodene.
Women with a family history of thromboembolism should undergo
a thrombophilia screen before starting the OCP (see Table 52.1 for
contraindications).

Arterial thrombosis
There is a 10-fold excess risk of IHD in female smokers over the age of 35
years who are on the OCP. The risk of IHD does not seem to be signiﬁcantly i in nonsmokers who take a low-dose OCP.
The relative risk of ischemic stroke is only slightly i in women taking a
low-dose OCP. The risk is i in women over the age of 35 years, smokers

or women with hypertension. The risk of hemorrhagic stroke does not
seem to be i by taking the OCP.
Risk of either arterial or venous thrombosis returns to normal within 3
months of discontinuing the OCP.

Hypertension
Hypertension may be caused by the OCP, and if already present, may be
more resistant to treatment.

Hepatic disease
Raised hepatic enzymes may be seen in women on the OCP. The incidence of benign hepatic tumors is also increased.

Gallstones
The risk of developing gallstones is slightly increased by taking the OCP
(RR = 1.2).

Breast cancer (controversial)
There may be a slightly i risk of breast cancer in women using the OCP
(RR = 1.3), particularly in those who began taking the OCP in their teens.
The risk does not seem to be related to the duration of exposure to the
OCP nor to the EE2 dose.
The relative risk of developing breast cancer returns to normal 10 years
after discontinuing the OCP.

Cervical cancer
Use of the OCP appears to be associated with an excess risk of cervical
cancer in women who are human papillomavirus (HPV) positive. The risk
increases with the duration of OCP use. It is not known whether the risk
falls again following discontinuation of the OCP.

Hormonal emergency contraception
This refers to contraception that a woman can use after unprotected
sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy.
A single 1.5 mg dose of the progestin levonorgestrel is highly efﬁcacious
with a pregnancy rate of 2–4% if taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse. It is most effective the earlier it is taken. The dose is repeated if
vomiting occurs within 3 hours of taking the pill.
The mechanism of action is not clear but is thought to be due to inhibition of ovulation as well as an d likelihood of endometrial implantation.
Side effects include nausea in up to 60% of women, vomiting in 10–20%.
Consider antiemetic 1 hour before taking contraception. Other side
effects are breast tenderness, fatigue, and dizziness.
Contraindication is pregnancy. Women should be advised to use barrier
contraception until their next period.

PRACTICAL ISSUES

98% of women menstruate within 3–4 weeks of taking levonorgestrel.
They should be encouraged to seek medical advice if they do not bleed
in that time.
If pregnancy does occur, levonorgestrel is not known to be
teratogenic.

Practical issues
Age and the OCP
Women with no risk factors for arterial or venous thrombosis may continue to use the combined OCP until the age of 50 years.
Those with risk factors for thromboembolism and IHD should avoid the
OCP after the age of 35 years, particularly if they are smokers.
All women on the OCP after the age of 35 years should be on the lowest effective estrogen dose (e.g., 20 mcg EE2).
Regarding contraception after the menopause, assume that the woman
is fertile for the ﬁrst year after the last menstrual period if >50 years.

Breakthrough bleeding
Causes include the following:
• Genital tract disease
• Insufﬁcient estrogen dose
• Inappropriate progestin
• Missed pill
• Taking 2 packets continuously
• Gastroenteritis
• Drug interactions, e.g., antibiotics, hepatic enzyme inducers

Antibiotics and the OCP
Broad-spectrum antibiotics interfere with intestinal ﬂora, thereby reducing
bioavailability of the OCP. Additional methods of contraception should
be used.

OCP and surgery
Stop the OCP at least 4 weeks before major surgery and any surgery to
the legs. Resume after mobile for at least 2 weeks.
With emergency surgery, stop the OCP and start antithrombotic
prophylaxis

CHAPTER 53

Testicular physiology

Testicular physiology

Anatomy
Normal adult male testicular volume is 15–30 mL. Testicular temperature
is 2°C lower than the rest of body because of the scrotal location. This is
necessary for normal spermatogenesis.
There are two main units with differing functions:
• Interstitial cells: Comprised of Leydig cells, which are found in between
the seminiferous tubules and close to the blood vessels. These cells
produce testosterone.
• Seminiferous tubules: Make up 90% of testicular volume.
Spermatogenesis occurs here, in the presence of high intratesticular
concentrations of testosterone. They are made up of germ cells and
Sertoli cells. Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis and secrete various
hormones, including inhibin and, in the embryo, Müllerian inhibitory
factor (AMH). The former inhibits FSH secretion from the pituitary
gland and the latter is responsible for suppressing female sex organ
development during sexual differentiation in utero.

REGULATION OF TESTICULAR FUNCTION

Regulation of testicular function
Regulation of androgen production
Hypothalamic hormones
Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) is secreted by thehypothalamus
in a pulsatile manner in response to sex hormones and gonadal peptides,
neurotransmitters, and neuropeptides (kisspeptin, leptin, etc.).
Episodic GnRH secretion is present at birth, is inhibited across midchildhood, and then is augmented initially during sleep in early puberty and
then throughout the day in adulthood. It stimulates the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the pituitary
gland.
The pattern of GnRH secretion is crucial for normal gonadotropin
secretion. Faster pulse frequencies are essential for LH secretion, whereas
slower frequencies favor FSH secretion. Continuous administration of
GnRH abolishes both LH and FSH secretion.
Pituitary hormones
LH binds to Leydig cell receptors and stimulates the synthesis and secretion of testosterone.
FSH binds to Sertoli cell receptors and stimulates the production of
seminiferous tubule ﬂuid as well as a number of substances thought to be
important for spermatogenesis.
Their secretion is regulated by GnRH pulses and through negative feedback from testicular hormones and peptides.
Testis
Testosterone is the main androgen produced by the Leydig cells of the
testis. Small amounts of androstenedione, DHEA, and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) are also produced. Testosterone has a circadian rhythm with
maximum secretion at around 8 A.M . and minimum at around 9 P.M .
Small amounts of estradiol are also produced in the testis by the conversion from testosterone. Additionally, most of the circulating estradiol
in men occurs as a result of aromatization of androgens in adipose tissue.
FSH, in the presence of adequate testosterone levels, stimulates the
secretion of inhibin B by Sertoli cells. This in turn acts as a potent inhibitor
of FSH secretion.
The secretion of pituitary gonadotropins is tightly regulated by testicular function. LH secretion is inhibited by testosterone and its metabolites
whereas, FSH secretion is controlled by both inhibin B and testosterone.
High concentrations of testosterone or of inhibin B results in a negative
feedback inhibition of FSH secretion (b see Fig. 53.2).
Testicular function is also under paracrine control. Inhibin and insulinlike growth factor-1 (IGF-1) act with LH to enhance testosterone production, whereas cytokines inhibit Leydig cell function.

281

282

CHAPTER 53

Testicular physiology

Regulation of spermatogenesis
b See Fig. 53.2.
Both FSH and LH are required for the initiation of spermatogenesisat
puberty. LH, by stimulating Leydig cell activity, plays an important part in
the early phases of sperm production, when high intratesticular concentrations of testosterone are essential. FSH, through its action on the Sertoli
cells, is vital for sperm maturation.
The whole process of spermatogenesis takes approximately 74 days, followed by another 12–21 days for sperm transport through theepididymis.
This means that events that may affect spermatogenesis may not be apparent for up to 3 months.

PHYSIOLOGY

Physiology
Testosterone transport
From 2 to 4% of circulating testosterone is free and therefore biologically
active. The rest is bound to proteins, particularly albumin and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG).

Testosterone metabolism
Testosterone is converted in target tissues to the more potent androgen
DHT in the presence of the enzyme 5A reductase. There are multiple
5A-reductase isoenzymes; type 2 is the isoenzyme responsible for DHT
synthesis in the genitalia, genital skin, and hair follicles. It is therefore
essential for normal male virilization and sexual development.
Both testosterone and DHT exert their activity by binding to androgen
receptors, the latter more avidly than testosterone. The androgen receptor
is encoded by a gene found on the long arm of the X chromosome (Xq).
Testosterone may alternatively be converted into estradiol through the
action of the aromatase enzyme, found in greatest quantities in the testes
and adipose tissue.
Testosterone and its metabolites are inactivated in the liver and
excreted in the urine.

Androgen action
• Male sexual differentiation during embryogenesis
• Development and maintenance of male secondary sex characteristics
after puberty
• Normal male sexual function and behavior

CHAPTER 54

Male hypogonadism

Male hypogonadism

Deﬁnition
Male hypogonadism is the failure of testes to produce adequate amounts
of testosterone, spermatozoa, or both.

Epidemiology
Klinefelter’s syndrome (XXY) (b see p. 289–290) is the most common
congenital cause and is thought to occur with an incidence of 1:500 live
births.
Acquired hypogonadism is even more common, affecting 1:200 men.

Evaluation of male hypogonadism
Presentation
• Failure to progress through puberty
• Sexual dysfunction
• Infertility
• Nonspeciﬁc symptoms, e.g., lethargy, reduced libido, mood changes,
weight gain
The clinical presentation depends on the following:
• Age of onset (congenital vs. acquired)
• Severity (complete vs. partial)
• Duration (functional vs. permanent)

SECONDARY HYPOGONADISM

Secondary hypogonadism
(hypogonadotropic hypogonadism)
Deﬁnition
This is hypogonadism as a result of hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction.

Diagnosis
• Low serum testosterone
• Low–normal or low LH and FSH (normal inhibin B and anti-Müllerian
hormone)

Causes
b See Box 54.1.
Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)
• The congenital form is indistinguishable from Kallmann syndrome
apart from the absence of anosmia. >90% of patients are men.
• GnRH receptor gene mutation is an uncommon cause of IHH.

Box 54.1 Causes of secondary hypogonadism
Idiopathic
• Kallmann syndrome.
• Other genetic causes, e.g., mutations of GnRH-R or GPR54 genes
• Idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (IHH)
• Fertile eunuch syndrome
• Congenital adrenal hypoplasia (DAX-1 gene mutation)
Functional
• Exercise
• Weight changes
• Anabolic steroids
• Stress—physical or psychological
• Systemic illness
• Medication and recreational drugs
Structural
• Tumors, e.g., pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, germinoma
• Inﬁltrative disorders, e.g., sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis
• Head trauma
• Radiotherapy
• Surgery to the pituitary gland or hypothalamus
Miscellaneous
• Hemochromatosis
• Prader–Willi syndrome
• Laurence–Moon–Biedl syndrome

285

286

CHAPTER 54

Male hypogonadism

• Men with acquired IHH may go through normal puberty and have
normal testicular size, but present with infertility or poor libido and
potency. It may be temporary, with normalization of gonadal function
after stopping GnRH or testosterone therapy.
Fertile eunuch syndrome
• Incomplete GnRH deﬁciency. Enough to maintain normal spermatogenesis
and testicular growth but insufﬁcient for adequate virilization
• May require testosterone/hCG for fertility
Congenital adrenal hypoplasia (CAH)
• Rare X-linked or autosomal recessive disease caused by mutation of
the DAX gene, located on the X chromosome
• Presents with primary adrenal failure in infancy
• Hypothalamic hypogonadism is also present.
Structural
• Usually associated with other pituitary hormonal deﬁciencies
• In children, craniopharyngiomas are the most common cause. Cranial
irradiation for leukemia or brain tumors may also result in secondary
hypogonadism.
• The most common lesions in adulthood are prolactinomas.
Kallmann syndrome
This genetic disorder is characterized by failure of episodic GnRH secretion ± anosmia. It results from failure of the proper migration of GnRHproducing neurons into the hypothalamus.
Epidemiology
• Incidence of 1 in 10,000 men
• 4:5 ratio = 4:1.
Diagnosis
• Anosmia in 75%
• i Risk of cleft lip and palate, sensorineural deafness, cerebellar ataxia,
and renal agenesis
• Low testosterone, LH, and FSH levels
• Rest of pituitary function is normal
• Normal MRI pituitary gland and hypothalamus; absent olfactory bulbs
may be seen on MRI
• Normalization of pituitary and gonadal function in response to
physiological GnRH replacement
Genetics
• Most commonly a result of an isolated gene mutation
• May be inherited in an X-linked (KAL1), autosomal dominant FGFR1
mutation/KAL2, or recessive trait
• KAL1 gene mutation responsible for some cases of X-linked Kallmann
syndrome is located on Xp22.3. It has a more severe reproductive
phenotype.

SECONDARY HYPOGONADISM

• Mutations of FGFR1 (ﬁbroblast growth factor receptor 1) gene, located
on chromosome 8p11, is associated with the autosomal dominant
form of Kallmann syndrome. Affected men have an i likelihood of
undescended testes at birth.
• 12–15% incidence of delayed puberty in families of subjects with
Kallmann syndrome compared with 1% general population
• Men with autosomal dominant form (FGFR1 mutation): 50%
transmitted to offspring.
Management
• Androgen replacement therapy
• When fertility is desired, testosterone is stopped and exogenous
gonadotropins are administered (b see p. 294).
Systemic illness
Severe illness of any kind may cause hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
(b see Box 54.2).
Obstructive sleep apnea may present with low normal testosterone levels and erectile dysfunction together with metabolic syndrome.
Drugs
Anabolic steroids, cocaine, and narcotic drugs may all result in secondary
hypogonadism.
All drugs causing hyperprolactinemia (b see Box 16.1, p. 105) will also
cause hypogonadism.
Prader–Willi syndrome
This is a congenital syndrome affecting 1:25000 births caused by loss of an
imprinted gene on paternally derived chromosome 15q11–13.
It should be suspected in infancy in the presence of characteristic facial
features (almond eyes, down-turned mouth, strabismus, thin upper lip),
severe hypotonia, poor feeding, and developmental delay. The child
then develops hyperphagia due to hypothalamic dysfunction, resulting

in severe obesity. Other characteristic features include short stature,
hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and learning disability.
Diabetes mellitus type II occurs in 15–40% of adults.
Laurence–Moon–Biedl syndrome
This congenital syndrome is characterized by severe obesity, gonadotropin
deﬁciency, retinal dystrophy, polydactyly, and learning disability.

PRIMARY HYPOGONADISM

Primary hypogonadism
(hypergonadotropic hypogonadism)
This condition is due to testicular failure with normal hypothalamus and
pituitary function.

Diagnosis
• Low serum testosterone
• Elevated LH and FSH (low inhibin B and anti-Müllerian hormone)

Causes
Genetic: Klinefelter’s syndrome
This is the most common congenital form of primary hypogonadism.
It is thought that a signiﬁcant number of men with Klinefelter’s syndrome are not diagnosed. Clinical manifestations will depend on the age
of diagnosis. Patients with mosaicism tend to have less severe clinical
features.
Adolescence
• Small ﬁrm testes (mean 5 mL)
• Gynecomastia
• Tall stature (i leg length)
• Other features of hypogonadism
• Cognitive dysfunction
Adulthood
• Reduced libido and erectile dysfunction
• Gynecomastia
• Reduced facial hair
• Obesity
• Infertility
Risks
• Type 2 diabetes mellitus
• Osteoporosis
• Thromboembolism
• Malignancies e.g., extragonadal germ cell tumors
Diagnosis
• Karyotyping: 47,XXY in 80%; higher-grade chromosomal aneuploidies
(e.g., 48,XXXY) or 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism in the remainder
• Low testosterone, elevated FSH and LH
• Elevated SHBG and estradiol
• Azoospermia
Management
• Lifelong androgen replacement
• May need surgical reduction of gynecomastia

289

290

CHAPTER 54

Male hypogonadism

• Fertility: Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI, b see Chapter
59, Infertility, pp. 316–331) using testicular spermatozoa from men
with Klinefelter’s syndrome has resulted in successful pregnancies.
However, couples should be counseled about the i risk of
chromosomal abnormalities in offspring.
Genetic: Other chromosomal disorders
XX males
• Due to an X to Y translocation with only a part of the Y present in
one of the X chromosomes
• Incidence is 1:10,000 births
• Similar clinical and biochemical features to Klinefelter’s syndrome. In
addition, short stature and hypospadias may be present.
XX/X0 (mixed gonadal dysgenesis)
• Occasionally, phenotypically men with hypospadias and intraabdominal dysgenetic gonads
• Bilateral gonadectomy is essential because of the risk of neoplasia,
followed by androgen replacement therapy.
XYY syndrome
• Taller than average, but often have primary gonadal failure with
impaired spermatogenesis
Y chromosome microdeletions:
• Causes oligo- and azoospermia. Testosterone levels are not usually
affected.
Noonan’s syndrome
• Autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1:1000 to 1:2500
live births
• 46,XY karyotype and secondary external genitalia. However, several
stigmata of Turner’s syndrome (short stature, webbed neck, ptosis,
low-set ears, lymphedema) and i risk cardiac anomalies (valvular
pulmonary stenosis and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Most have
cryptorchidism and primary testicular failure.
Cryptorchidism
• 10% of secondary neonates have undescended testes, but most of
these will descend into the scrotum eventually, so that the incidence
of postpubertal cryptorchidism is < 0.5%.
• 15% of cases have bilateral cryptorchidism.
Consequences
• 75% of males with bilateral cryptorchidism are infertile.
• 10% risk of testicular malignancy, highest risk in those with intraabdominal testes
• Low testosterone and raised gonadotropins in bilateral
cryptorchidism

PRIMARY HYPOGONADISM

Treatment
• Orchidopexy: best performed before 18 months, certainly before age
5 years, to reduce risk of later infertility
• Gonadectomy: in patients with intra-abdominal testes, followed by
androgen replacement.
Orchitis
• 25% of males who develop mumps after puberty have associated
orchitis and 25–50% of these will develop primary testicular failure.
• HIV infection may also be associated with orchitis.
• Primary testicular failure may occur as part of an autoimmune
disease.
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy
Cytotoxic drugs, particularly alkylating agents, are gonadotoxic. Infertility
occurs in 50% of patients following chemotherapy for most malignancies,
and a signiﬁcant number of males require androgen replacement therapy
because of low testosterone levels.
The testes are radiosensitive, so hypogonadism can occur from
scattered radiation during the treatment of Hodgkin’s disease, for
example.
If fertility is desired, sperm should be cryopreserved prior to cancer
therapy.
Other drugs
Sulfasalazine, colchicine, and high-dose glucocorticoids may reversibly
affect testicular function.
Alcohol excess will also cause primary testicular failure.
Chronic illness
Any chronic illness may affect testicular function, in particular chronic
renal failure, liver cirrhosis, and hemochromatosis.
Testicular trauma
Testicular torsion is another common cause of loss of a testis, and it may
also affect the function of the remaining testis.

Clinical assessment
History
• Developmental history: congenital urinary tract abnormalities,
e.g., hypospadias, late testicular descent, or cryptorchidism
• Delayed or incomplete puberty
• Infections, e.g., mumps, orchitis
• Abdominal or genital trauma
• Testicular torsion
• Anosmia
• Drug history: e.g., sulfasalazine, antihypertensives, chemotherapy,
cimetidine, radiotherapy; alcohol and recreational drugs also
important
• General medical history: chronic illness, particularly respiratory,
neurological, and cardiac
• Gynecomastia: common (b see Chapter 56, Gynecomastia, pp. 301)
during adolescence. If recent-onset gynecomastia in adulthood, must
rule out estrogen-producing tumor
• Family history: Young syndrome (b p. 321), cystic ﬁbrosis, Kallmann’s
syndrome
• Sexual history: erectile function, frequency of intercourse, sexual
techniques. Absence of morning erections suggests an organic cause of
erectile dysfunction.

Hormonal evaluation of testicular function
Serum testosterone
There is diurnal variation in circulating testosterone, with peak levels
occurring in the early morning. A 30% variation occurs between the highest and lowest testosterone levels, so morning plasma testosterone is useful. If the level is low, this should be repeated.

294

CHAPTER 54

Male hypogonadism

Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
Only 2–4% of circulating testosterone is unbound; 50% is bound to SHBG
and the rest to albumin.
Concentrations of SHBG should be taken into account when interpreting a serum testosterone result. SHBG levels may be affected by a variety
of conditions (b see Table 54.1).
Gonadotropins
Raised FSH and LH levels occur in primary testicular failure and are
inappropriately low in pituitary or hypothalamic hypogonadism. One
should always exclude hyperprolactinemia in secondary hypogonadism.
Estradiol
Estradiol results from the conversion of testosterone and androstenedione by
aromatase. b See Table 54.2 for causes of elevated estradiol. Request serum
estradiol level if gynecomastia is present or a testicular tumor is suspected.

CLINICAL ASSESSMENT

Inhibin B and AMH
Gonadal glycoproteins secrete into the circulation. These are useful markers of normal testicular functions. They are low if there is primary testicular failure and normal with pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction.
Other investigations
• Scrotal US (testicular volume/blood ﬂow with Doppler/presence of
hydrocele, etc.)
• Semen analysis (A normal semen analysis is indicative of gonadal
health. Men with low sperm count should consider sperm
cryopreservation to preserve fertility.)
Dynamic tests
These are of limited clinical value and are rarely performed routinely.
hCG stimulation test
• Diagnostic test for examining Leydig cell function
• hCG 2000 IU IM given on days 0 and 2; testosterone measured on
days 0, 2, and 4
• In prepubertal boys with absent scrotal testes, a response to hCG
indicates intra-abdominal testes. Failure of testosterone to rise after
hCG suggests absence of functioning testicular tissue. An exaggerated
response to hCG is seen in secondary hypogonadism.
Clomifene stimulation test
• Used to assess integrity of the hypothalamic–pituitary testicular axis
• Normal response to 3 mg/kg (max 200mg) clomifene daily for 7 days
is a 2-fold increase in LH and FSH measured on days 0, 4, 7, and 10.
• A subnormal response indicates hypothalamic or pituitary
hypogonadism but does not differentiate between the two.

CHAPTER 55

Androgen therapy

Androgen therapy

Treatment goals
• Improve libido and sexual function
Testosterone therapy will induce virilization in the hypogonadal males and
restores libido and erectile function.
• Improve mood and well-being
Most studies show an improvement in mood, well-being, and QoL following physiologic testosterone therapy.
• Improve muscle mass and strength
Testosterone has direct anabolic effects on skeletal muscle and has been
shown to increase muscle mass and strength when given to hypogonadal
men. Lean body mass is also i with a reduction in fat mass.
• Prevent osteoporosis
Hypogonadism is a risk factor for osteoporosis. Testosterone inhibits
bone resorption, thereby reducing bone turnover. Its administration to
hypogonadal men has been shown to improve bone mineral density and
reduce risk of developing osteoporosis. Few fracture data are available.
• Fertility
Fertility is inhibited by testosterone therapy. Men with secondary hypogonadism who desire fertility may be treated with gonadotropins to initiate and maintain spermatogenesis (b see p. 296). Prior testosterone
therapy will not affect fertility prospects but should be stopped before
initiating gonadotropin treatment.
Men with primary hypogonadism will not respond to gonadotropin or
GnRH therapy.

INDICATIONS FOR TREATMENT

Indications for treatment
• Men with established primary or secondary hypogonadism of any cause

CHAPTER 55

Androgen therapy

Risks and side effects
Prostatic disease
Androgens stimulate prostatic growth, and testosterone replacement
therapy may therefore induce symptoms of bladder outﬂow obstruction
in men with prostatic hypertrophy.
It is unlikely that testosterone increases the risk of developing prostate
cancer, but it may promote the growth of an existing cancer.

Polycythemia
Testosterone stimulates erythropoiesis. Androgen replacement therapy
may increase hemoglobin levels, particularly in older men. It may be necessary to reduce the dose of testosterone in men with clinically signiﬁcant
polycythemia.

Cardiovascular disease
Testosterone replacement therapy may cause a fall in both LDL and HDL
cholesterol levels, the signiﬁcance of which remains unclear. The effect of
androgen replacement therapy on the risk of developing coronary heart
disease is unknown.

Other (see Table 55.1)
• Acne
• Gynecomastia is occasionally enhanced by testosterone therapy,
particularly in peripubertal boys. This is the result of the conversion of
testosterone to estrogens.
• Fluid retention may result in worsening symptoms in those with
underlying congestive cardiac failure or hepatic cirrhosis.
• Obstructive sleep apnea may be exacerbated by testosterone therapy.
• Hepatotoxicity may be induced by oral androgens, particularly the 17A
alkylated testosterones.
• Mood swings

MANAGEMENT

Management
Treat underlying disorder when present. Withdraw offending drugs where
possible.
Reassurance is adequate treatment in the majority of idiopathic cases.
The condition often resolves spontaneously.
Treatment may be required for cosmetic reasons or to alleviate pain
and tenderness.
Drug treatment is only partially effective. It may be of beneﬁt in treating
gynecomastia of recent onset.

Medical
b See Table 56.1.

Surgical
Reduction mammoplasty may be required in males with severe and persistent gynecomastia.
Table 56.1 Medical treatment of gynecomastia
Tamoxifen (10–30 mg/day)

Antiestrogenic effects. Particularly
effective in reducing pain and swelling if
used in gynecomastia of recent onset.
A 3-month trial before referral for surgery
may be of beneﬁt.

Clomifene (50–100 mg/day)

Antiestrogenic. May be effective
in reducing breast size in pubertal
gynecomastia

Danazol (300–600 mg/day)

Nonaromatizable androgen. May also
reduce breast size in adults. Its use is
limited by side effects, particularly weight

CHAPTER 57

Erectile dysfunction

Erectile dysfunction

Deﬁnition
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is the consistent inability to achieve or maintain
an erect penis sufﬁcient for satisfactory sexual intercourse. ED affects
approximately 10% of men and >50% of men >70 years.

Physiology of male sexual function
The erectile response is the result of the coordinated interaction of
nerves, smooth muscle of the corpora cavernosa, pelvic muscles, and
blood vessels. It is initiated by psychogenic stimuli from the brain or physical stimulation of the genitalia, which are modulated in the limbic system,
transmitted down the spinal cord to the sympathetic and parasympathetic
outﬂows of the penile tissue.
Penile erectile tissue consists of paired corpora cavernosa on the dorsum of the penis and the corpus spongiosum. These are surrounded by
ﬁbrous tissue known as the tunica albuginea.
In the ﬂaccid state, the corporeal smooth muscle is contracted, minimizing corporeal blood ﬂow and enhancing venous drainage.
Activation of the erectile pathway results in penile smooth muscle
relaxation and cavernosal arterial vasodilatation. As the corporeal sinuses
ﬁll with blood, the draining venules are compressed against the tunica
albuginea so venous outﬂow is impaired. This results in penile rigidity and
an erection.
Corporeal vasodilatation is mediated by parasympathetic neuronal activation, which induces nitric oxide release by the cavernosal nerves. This
activates guanyl cyclase, thereby i cGMP, and causing smooth muscle
relaxation.
Detumescence occurs after the inactivation of cGMP by the enzyme
phosphodiesterase, resulting in smooth muscle contraction and
vasoconstriction.
Ejaculation is mediated by the sympathetic nervous system.

PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Pathophysiology
Erectile dysfunction may occur as a result of several mechanisms:
• Neurological damage
• Arterial insufﬁciency
• Venous incompetence
• Androgen deﬁciency
• Penile abnormalities
• Iatrogenic: medications or supplements
• Psychogenic

Evaluation
History
Sexual history
• Extent of the dysfunction, its duration, and progression
• Presence of nocturnal or morning erections
• Abrupt onset of erectile dysfunction that is intermittent is often
psychogenic in origin.
• Progressive and persistent dysfunction indicates an organic cause.
Symptoms of hypogonadism
• Reduced libido, muscle strength, and sense of well-being.
Full medical history
• E.g., diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis, or neurological, cardiovascular, or
endocrine disease
• Intermittent claudication suggests a vascular cause.
• A history of genitourinary trauma or surgery is also important.
• Recent change in bladder or bowel function may indicate neurological
cause.
• Psychological history
Drug history
• Onset of impotence in relation to commencing a new medication
Social history
• Stress
• Relationship history
• Smoking history
• Recreational drugs, including alcohol

Physical examination
• Evidence of primary or secondary hypogonadism
• Evidence of endocrine disorders:
• Hyperprolactinemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypopituitarism.
• Other complications of diabetes mellitus, if present
• Evidence of neurological disease
• Autonomic or peripheral neuropathy
• Spinal cord lesions
• Evidence of systemic disease, e.g.:
• Chronic liver disease
• Chronic cardiac disease
• Peripheral vascular disease

Additional investigations
Evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea
This is rarely required. To assess vascular causes of impotence if corrective surgery is contemplated:
• Intracavernosal injection of a vasodilator, e.g., alprostadil E1 or
papaverine. A sustained erection excludes signiﬁcant vascular
insufﬁciency.
• Penile Doppler ultrasonography: Cavernous arterial ﬂow and venous
insufﬁciency are assessed.

MANAGEMENT

Management
Treat underlying disorder or withdraw offending drugs where possible.

Androgens
This should be ﬁrst-line therapy in males with hypogonadism (b see p. 296).
Hyperprolactinemia, when present, should be treated with dopamine agonists and the underlying cause of hypogonadism treated.

Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors
b See Table 57.1 and Box 57.2.
These act by enhancing cGMP activity in erectile tissue by blocking the
enzyme PDE-5, thereby amplifying the vasodilatory action of nitric oxide
and thus the normal erectile response to sexual stimulation.
Trials indicate a 50–80% success rate.

Alprostadil
Alprostadil results in smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilatation. It is
administered intraurethrally and is then absorbed into the erectile bodies.
• 60–66% success rate
• Side effects: local pain

Intracavernous injection
This has a 70–100% success rate and is highest in men with non-vasculogenic impotence.
Alprostadil is a potent vasodilator. The dose should be titrated in 1 mcg
increments until the desired effect is achieved to minimize side effects.
Papaverine, a PDE inhibitor, induces cavernosal vasodilatation and penile rigidity but causes more side effects.
Side effects
• Priapism in 1–5%. Patients must seek urgent medical advice if an
erection lasts >4 hours.

Contraindications
• Recent myocardial infarction or stroke
• Unstable angina
• Current nitrate use, including isosorbide mononitrate/GTN
• Hypotension (<90/50 mmHg)
• Severe heart failure
• Severe hepatic impairment
• Retinitis pigmentosa
• Ketoconazole or HIV protease inhibitors
Cautions (reduce dose)
• Hypertension
• Heart disease
• Peyronies disease
• Sickle cell anemia
• Renal or hepatic impairment
• Elderly
• Leukemia
• Multiple myeloma
• Bleeding disorders e.g., active peptic ulcer disease
Avoid concomitant opiates as they may result in prolonged erections.

• Fibrosis in the injection site in up to 5% of patients. Minimize risk by
alternating sides of the penis for injection and injecting a maximum of
twice a week.
• Infection at injection site is rare.
Contraindication
• Sickle cell disease
Injection technique
Avoid the midline so as to avoid urethral and neurovascular damage.
Clean the injection site, hold the penis under slight tension, and introduce the needle at 90º. Inject after the characteristic “give” of piercing the
ﬁbrous capsule. Apply pressure to injection site after removing the needle
to prevent bruising.

Vacuum device
Results are good, with 90% of men achieving a satisfactory erection. The
ﬂaccid penis is put into the device and air is withdrawn, creating a vacuum
that then allows blood to ﬂow into the penis.
A constriction band is then placed on to the base of the penis so that
the erection is maintained. This should be removed within 30 minutes.
• Side effects: pain, hematoma

MANAGEMENT

Penile prosthesis
This is usually tried in men either reluctant to try other forms of therapy
or when other treatments have failed. The prosthesis may be semi-rigid
or inﬂatable.
• Complications: infection, mechanical failure

Psychosexual counseling
Consider counseling particularly for men with psychogenic impotence and
in men who fail to improve with the above therapies.

Surgical
Surgery is rarely indicated, as results are generally disappointing.
Revascularization techniques may be available in some centers.
Ligation of dorsal veins may restore erectile function temporarily in men
with venous insufﬁciency, although rarely permanently.

EVALUATION

Evaluation
Sexual history
• Frequency of intercourse: sexual intercourse every 2–3 days should be
encouraged.
• Use of lubricants should be avoided because of the detrimental effect
on semen quality.

Female factors
History
• Age: Fertility declines rapidly after the age of 36 years.
Menstrual history
• Age at menarche
• Length of menstrual cycle and its regularity (e.g., oligo- or amenorrhea)
• Presence or absence of intermenstrual spotting
Other
• Hot ﬂashes may be indicative of estrogen deﬁciency.
• Spontaneous galactorrhea may be caused by hyperprolactinemia.
• Hypothalamic hypogonadism is suggested by excessive physical exercise
(e.g., running >4 miles/day) or weight loss in excess of 10% in 1 year.
Drug history
• Drugs that may cause hyperprolactinemia (b see Box 16.1, p. 106),
including cocaine and marijuana
• Smoking is thought have an adverse effect on fertility.
• The use of anabolic steroids may cause secondary hypogonadism.
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiotherapy may cause ovarian failure.
Medical history
• Diabetes mellitus, thyroid or pituitary dysfunction, and other systemic
illnesses
Exclude tubal disease
• Recurrent vaginal or urinary tract infections may predispose to pelvic
inﬂammatory disease (PID).
• Dyspareunia and dysmenorrhea are often present.
• Sexually transmitted disease and previous abdominal or gynecological
surgery all predispose to fallopian tube obstruction.
Secondary infertility
• Details of previous pregnancies, including abortions (spontaneous and
therapeutic) and ectopic pregnancies, should be ascertained.

CHAPTER 59

Infertility

• Secondary sexual characteristics: If absent, look for evidence of Turner’s
syndrome.
• Hyperandrogenism: PCOS
• Galactorrhea: hyperprolactinemia
• External genitalia and pelvic examination
Investigations
b See Fig. 59.1.
Assess ovulatory function
• In women with regular menstrual cycles, measure midluteal
progesterone (day 21 or approximately 7 days before expected onset
of menses).
• Check serum FSH and LH. In women who are not amenorrheic this
should be measured on days 2–6 of the menstrual cycle (day 1 =
ﬁrst day of menses). Follicular phase FSH >10 is indicative of reduced
ovarian reserve. Ovarian failure is diagnosed if FSH is >30.
• Measure TSH, free T4, and serum prolactin in women with irregular
menstrual cycles or who are not ovulating.
Other investigations
• Karyotype: if primary ovarian failure is present (raised FSH, LH)

EVALUATION

• MRI of the pituitary fossa: in hyperprolactinemia and hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism
• Exclude cervical infection: Send vaginal discharge for bacteriology and
do Chlamydia trachomatis serology
• Pelvic US: Assess uterine and ovarian anatomy.
Assess tubal patency (refer to specialist multidisciplinary fertility clinic)
• Hysterosalpingography (HSG) or laparoscopy and dye test (do in the
early follicular phase of cycle to avoid doing during pregnancy)
• Give prophylactic antibiotics if Chlamydia status is unknown, to avoid
postoperative infection.
Postcoital test
• To assess cervical mucus receptivity to sperm penetration and
measurement of antisperm antibodies. These tests are rarely performed,
as they are unreliable and the results do not alter management.
Male factors
History and physical examination
Symptoms of androgen deﬁciency
• Reduced libido and potency
• Reduced frequency of shaving
• May be asymptomatic
Drug history
• Drug or alcohol abuse and the use of anabolic steroids may all
contribute to hypogonadism.
• Other drugs that may affect spermatogenesis, e.g., sulfasalazine,
methotrexate
• Cytotoxic chemotherapy may cause primary testicular failure.
Other factors
• History of infection, e.g., mumps, orchitis, sexually transmitted disease,
or epididymitis.
• Bronchiectasis may be associated with epididymal obstruction (Young
syndrome) or severe asthenospermia (immotile cilia syndrome).
• Testicular injury or surgery may cause disordered spermatogenesis.
• Secondary sex characteristics may be absent in congenital
hypogonadism.
• Anosmia: Kallmann’s syndrome
• Eunuchoid habitus (b see Box 54.3, p. 293) suggestive of prepubertal
hypogonadism
• Gynecomastia may suggest hypogonadism.
Testicular size (using orchidometer)
• Normal: 15–25 mL
• Reduced to <15 mL in hypogonadism
• In Klinefelter’s syndrome, they are often <5 mL.
• In patients with normal testicular size, suspect genital tract obstruction,
e.g., congenital absence of vas deferens.

CHAPTER 59

Infertility

Examine the rest of external genitalia, looking for penile and urethral
abnormalities and epididymal thickening.
Investigations
b See Fig. 59.2.
Semen analysis
This is essential in the diagnostic workup of any infertile couple.
• If normal (b see Table 59.1 ), then a male cause is excluded.
• If abnormal, then repeat semen analysis approximately 6–12 weeks later.
• Semen collection should be performed after 3 days of sexual
abstinence. b See Table 59.1 for interpretation of results
.• If azoospermia is present, rule out obstruction if FSH and testosterone
concentrations are normal.
• Asthenospermia, or immotile sperm, is usually due to immunological
infertility or infection, e.g., of the prostate (high semen viscosity and
pH, and leukocytospermia).
FSH, LH, and testosterone levels
FSH may be elevated in the presence of normal LH and testosterone levels and oligospermia. This may be seen in men who are normally virilized
but infertile as a result of disordered spermatogenesis.
Low FSH, LH, and testosterone concentrations suggest secondary hypogonadism. An MRI of the pituitary gland and hypothalamus is necessary to
exclude organic disease.

Further investigations
• Urinary bacteriology should be performed in men with
leukocytospermia.
• Scrotal US may help in the diagnosis of chronic epididymitis. Men being
investigated for infertility are at i risk of testicular tumors.
• Karyotyping may be helpful in men with primary testicular failure.
Klinefelter’s syndrome (47,XXY) is a cause of infertility, and deletions
on the long arm of the Y chromosome have been found in a signiﬁcant
proportion of azoospermic men.
• Sperm antibodies in semen should not be measured routinely, as
speciﬁc treatment is rarely effective.
• Testicular biopsy is rarely diagnostic but may be used to retrieve sperm
for assisted reproduction techniques in specialist fertility centers.
• Sperm function tests are not performed routinely.

CHAPTER 59

Infertility

Management
Female partner
Anovulation
Hypogonadotropic (WHO class 1)
• If hyperprolactinemic, then dopamine agonists are usually effective
• Lifestyle changes if underweight or excessive exercise
• Otherwise, ovulation induction (b see Ovulation induction, p. 328)
Normogonadotropic (WHO class 2)
• Usually PCOS: weight reduction if obese
• Ovulation induction (b see Ovulation induction p. 328)
Hypergonadotropic (WHO class 3)
• POF ovum donation followed by IVF is the only option.
• Spontaneous transient remission is possible in early POF.
• If still cycling and FSH is 15–25 IU/L, ovarian hyperstimulation and IVF
may be attempted, but with poor results.
Tubal infertility
Surgical tubal reconstruction may be attempted in specialist centers.
There is a 50–60% 2-year cumulative pregnancy rate in patients with
mild disease, but only 10% in more severe disease and a high risk of
ectopic pregnancy, so IVF may be more appropriate in women with severe
disease.
Cumulative pregnancy rate is at least 50% following IVF (20–25% per
cycle) unless hydrosalpinx is present. Women with hydrosalpinx should be
offered salpingectomy prior to IVF to improve success rates.
Endometriosis
Minimal/mild
• GnRH agonists, danazol, and progestins do not improve fertility.
• Laparoscopic destruction of superﬁcial disease improves pregnancy
chances. Resection of ovarian endometriomas may improve ovarian
folliculogenesis and thus fertility.
• Assisted reproductive techniques (ART) (Table 59.2) have a pregnancy
rate of 25–35% per cycle.
Moderate/severe
• Surgery may improve fertility. However, ART is often necessary.
Vaginal and cervical factors
Each episode of acute PID causes infertility in 10–15% of cases.
Chlamydia trachomatis is responsible for half the cases of PID in the
developed countries. Treat both partners with antibiotics.
Uterine factors
Intracavity ﬁbroids, polyps, and uterine septum can be resected hysteroscopically with a high chance of restoring fertility.

MANAGEMENT

Intramural ﬁbroids may also reduce fertility and require myomectomy.
Fibroid embolization is not recommended for women wishing fertility,
as safety in pregnancy is not established.

Male partner
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
• Gonadotropins: chorionic gonadotropin 1500–2000 IU IM 3 × week.
Most also require FSH/hMG 75–150 IU IM 3 x week. Monitor serum
testosterone and testicular size. The main side effect is gynecomastia.
or
• Pulsatile GnRH using an SC infusion pump (b see p. 331). Dose varies
from 25 to 500 ng/kg every 90–120 minutes. Titrate to normalize LH,
FSH, and testosterone. This will not work in pituitary disease.
• Once testes are >8 mL, get semen analysis every 3–6 months. It
takes at least 2 years to maximize spermatogenesis. Normalization
of spermatogenesis occurs in 80–90% of men.
• Once spermatogenesis is induced it may be maintained by hCG
alone.

Idiopathic semen abnormalities
There is no evidence to suggest that the use of androgens, gonadotropins,
or antiestrogens help improve fertility in men with idiopathic disorders of
spermatogenesis.
Obstructive azoospermia
Reversal of vasectomy will result in successful pregnancy in up to 50% of
cases within 2 years.
Microsurgery is possible for most other causes, with successful pregnancies in 25–35% of couples within 18 months of treatment. During surgery,
sperm is often retrieved and stored for possible future intracytoplasmic
sperm injection (ICSI).
Varicocele
There is a controversial association with male subfertility. Surgical correction is currently not recommended for fertility treatment as there is little
evidence that surgery improves pregnancy rates.

Unexplained infertility
Deﬁnition
This is infertility despite normal sexual intercourse occurring at least twice
weekly, normal semen analysis, documentation of ovulation in several
cycles, and normal patent tubes (by laparoscopy).
Management
From 30 to 50% will become pregnant within 3 years of expectant management. If not pregnant by then, chances that spontaneous pregnancy will
occur are greatly reduced and ART should be considered.
In women >34 years of age, expectant management is not an option
and up to 6 cycles of intrauterine insemination (IUI), or IVF should be
considered.

support using progesterone supplementation (pessaries
or PO) is then provided until pregnancy is conﬁrmed.
May adopt a similar technique in women with premature
ovarian failure using donated ova which are then fertilized
in vitro with the partner’s sperm. Hormonal support will

Results
IUI can achieve a pregnancy rate of 15% per cycle, and cumulative delivery
rate after several cycles is 50%.
IVF offers a live birth rate per cycle of >25% in younger women and a
cumulative delivery rate approaching 80%. ICSI allows IVF to be offered
in severe oligospermia, with pregnancy rates equivalent to standard IVF.
There is a slight increase in congenital malformations after ICSI.
A signiﬁcant risk of multiple pregnancy occurs with any form of ART.

CHAPTER 59

Infertility

Ovulation induction
Indications
• Anovulation due to the following:
• PCOS
• Hypopituitarism
• Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
• Controlled ovarian hyperstimulation for ART

Pretreatment assessment
Exclude thyroid dysfunction and hyperprolactinemia.
Check rubella serology.
Conﬁrm normal semen analysis.
Conﬁrm tubal patency (laparoscopy, hysterosalpingogram [HSG], or
hysterosalping-contrast sonography [HyCoSy]) prior to gonadotropin
use and/or after failed clomifene use.
• Optimize lifestyle: maintain satisfactory BMI, exercise in moderation,
reduce alcohol intake, and stop smoking.
• Baseline pelvic US is essential to exclude ovarian masses and uterine
abnormalities prior to treatment.
•
•
•
•

Clomifene citrate
Mode of action
• Binds to estrogen receptors in hypothalamus, blocking normal negative
feedback, thereby i pulse frequency of GnRH. This stimulates FSH
and LH release, thereby stimulating the production of one or more
dominant ovarian follicles.
• Antiestrogen effect on endometrium, cervix, and vagina
Indications
• Eugonadotropic anovulation, e.g., PCOS. May also be used in
unexplained infertility. It requires normal hypothalamic–pituitary–
ovarian axis to work, thus is ineffective in hypogonadotropic
hypogonadism.
Contraindications
• Hepatic dysfunction
Administration
• Start on days 5 of menstrual cycle (may have to induce bleed by giving
a progestin for 10 days) and take for a total of 5 days.
Dose
• Start on 50 mg/day and increase by 50 mg every month until midluteal
progesterone is >30 nmol/L.
• Spontaneous ovulation should occur 5–10 days after the last day of
medication.
• Remain on optimum dose for 6–12 months.
• Most patients require 50–100 mg/day.

OVULATION INDUCTION

• Ideally, follicle growth should be monitored by regular vaginal US to
minimize the risk of multiple pregnancies and ovarian hyperstimulation.
Efﬁcacy
• 80–90% ovulate, with conception rates of 50–60% in ﬁrst 6 ovulatory
cycles. Chances of ovulation can be enhanced in nonresponders
by administration of 10,000 IU of hCG mid-cycle (use US guidance;
administer hCG when leading follicle is at least 20 mm).
• In overweight women with PCOS who remain anovulatory, the
addition of metformin (500 mg tid) to clomifene may improve
ovulation rates.
Side effects
• Hot ﬂashes in 10%, mood swings, depression and headaches in 1%,
pelvic pain in 5%, nausea in 2%, breast tenderness in 5%, hair loss in
0.3%, visual disturbances in 1.5%
• Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in 1%
• Multiple pregnancies in 7–10%
Risk of ovarian cancer
This risk is unknown. Infertility is associated with an i risk of ovarian cancer. Additionally, one study suggests a 2-fold i risk of low-grade ovarian
cancer following long-term clomifene use. Further studies are necessary, but currently recommended maximum treatment duration is 6–12
months.
Tamoxifen
Tamoxifen is also an antiestrogen that has similar properties to clomifene.
It can be used to induce ovulation with results comparable to clomifene.
The dose used is 20–40 mg od for 5–7 days starting on days 2–5 of menstrual cycle.

Ovarian drilling
Laparoscopic ovarian drilling by laser or diathermy in 4–10 points on the
surface of the ovaries may be used in women with PCOS who have failed
to conceive on clomifene.
Its ovulation rate of >80% and pregnancy rate of >60% are comparable
to gonadotropin therapy, without the risk of multiple pregnancy or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. It is most effective in slim women with
PCOS with a high LH. There are few controlled studies, however.
There is a low risk of pelvic adhesions following ovarian diathermy and
a theoretical risk of premature ovarian failure.

Gonadotropins
Indications
• Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism
• Women with PCOS who are clomifene resistant
• For superovulation as part of ART

329

330

CHAPTER 59

Infertility

Dose and administration
Several regimens are available, all requiring close monitoring with twiceweekly estradiol (E2) measurements and vaginal US. One suggested
regime (low-dose step-up approach) is as follows:
• Start at 50–75 IU/day hMG (or FSH) on days 2–4 of the menstrual
cycle. On day 7 (or 14) of treatment measure serum E2 and perform
a vaginal US. If E2 <60 pg/mL and there has been no change in follicle
development, then increase hMG (or FSH) by 37.5 IU. Continue to
monitor and increase hMG (or FSH) by 37.5 IU (maximum dose 225
IU/day) on a weekly basis until there is an ovarian response.
• If >3 mature follicles (>14 mm) develop or E2 >800 pg/mL, then abandon
cycle and restart on half-dose hMG/FSH because of risk of OHSS.
• Otherwise, give hCG at a dose of 5000 IU to trigger ovulation when
follicle is >18 mm in diameter. The dose may be increased to 10,000
IU in the subsequent cycle if ovulation doesn’t occur.
• Gonadotropins may be used for a total of 6 cycles. If unsuccessful,
consider ART.
Efﬁcacy
• 80–85% pregnancy rate after 6 cycles
Side effects
• Multiple pregnancy (20%)—OHSS
OHSS
OHSS is a potentially fatal syndrome of ovarian enlargement and i vascular permeability with accumulation of ﬂuid in the peritoneal, pleural,
and pericardial cavities. It occurs during the luteal phase of the cycle, i.e.,
after hCG stimulation, and is more severe if pregnancy occurs, because of
endogenous hCG production.
Mild OHSS occurs in up to 25% of stimulated cycles and results in
abdominal bloating and nausea. It resolves with bed rest and ﬂuid replacement. Severe OHSS, associated with hypotension, markedly enlarged
ovaries, ascites, and pleural and pericardial effusions, occurs in <0.1%.
Women with OHSS need to be hospitalized and resuscitated, as there is i
mortality from disseminated intravascular coagulation and pulmonary emboli.
Management should be led by an expert reproductive endocrinologist.
OHSS is triggered by hCG, so it is best prevented by withholding hCG
during at-risk cycles. Risk factors include the presence of multiple ovarian
follicles, PCOS, young age, and a previous history of OHSS.
IVF superovulation
This should be accompanied by use of a GnRH agonist starting from the
mid-luteal phase of the preceding cycle (long protocol) or a GnRH antagonist starting in the mid-follicular phase of the stimulation cycle (antagonist protocol). These strategies prevent premature ovulation before eggs
can be collected and signiﬁcantly improve pregnancy rates.

GnRH treatment
Indications
• Hypothalamic hypogonadism with normal pituitary function

OVULATION INDUCTION

Dose and administration
• Pulsatile GnRH using an infusion pump that is worn continuously.
This delivers a dose of GnRH every 60–90 minutes. The dose
may be administered either intravenously (2.5–10 mcg/90 min) or
subcutaneously (20 mcg/90 min).
Monitoring
• Monitor E2 levels because of risk of hypoestrogenemia if GnRH is
given too frequently.
• There is little risk of OHSS or multiple pregnancies, so ultrasonic
monitoring is not usually necessary.
Side effects
• Allergic reaction
Efﬁcacy
• Cumulative pregnancy rate of 70–90%

Cryopreservation, fertility, and cancer treatment
Chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy for some cancers can adversely affect
male and female fertility, resulting in gonadal failure.
Male patients should be offered the chance of sperm cryopreservation
and storage prior to starting cancer treatment so that future fertility may
be an option.
Cryostorage of oocytes and/or ovarian tissue is less successful. However,
it should still be offered to women of reproductive age about to embark
on cancer treatment if they are well enough to undergo ovarian stimulation and egg retrieval. They should be counseled about the low chance of
a successful pregnancy using such techniques.
Storage of frozen embryos is more successful but requires the young
female cancer patient to be in a stable relationship with the potential
father of her children. Superovulation/IVF with embryo freezing requires a
3- to 6-week delay in initiation of chemo- or radiotherapy, which must be
sanctioned by the lead oncologist.

ANDROGEN INSENSITIVITY SYNDROME

Androgen insensitivity syndrome
Pathogenesis
This syndrome results from a mutation in the androgen receptor gene
located on chromosome Xq11–12. Several mutations may occur, inherited
in an X-linked recessive fashion. However, approximately 40% of patients
have a negative family history. Major gene deletions result in complete
androgen insensitivity, but the more common amino acid substitutions can
result in any of the phenotypes.
Incidence is 1:20 000–1:64 000.

Clinical features
Complete androgen insensitivity (testicular feminization) results in normal
female external genitalia. However, the vagina is often shorter than normal and may rarely be absent.
No male external sex organs are present, but remnants of Müllerian
structures are occasionally present. Testes are usually located in the abdomen or in the inguinal canal. There is no spermatogenesis.
The syndrome often presents during puberty with primary amenorrhea.
Height is above the female average and breast development may be normal. Patients have a normal female habitus but little or no pubic and axillary hair. Gender identity and psychological development are female.
Partial androgen insensitivity has a wide phenotypic spectrum, ranging
from ambiguous genitalia to a normal male phenotype presenting with
infertility.
• Phenotypic female with mild virilization
• Reifenstein’s syndrome (undervirilized male with gynecomastia and
hypospadias)
• Infertile male
There is a 9% risk of seminoma.

Hormonal evaluation
Testosterone levels are in the normal or often above-normal male range.
hCG stimulation results in a further rise in testosterone, with little increase
in SHBG.
Estradiol levels are higher than those in normal males, but lower than
the female average. Estrogen is produced by the testes and from peripheral aromatization of testosterone.
LH levels are usually markedly elevated, but FSH is normal.
Genetic testing is possible in some centers.

Management
Orchidectomy is performed to prevent malignancy. Exact timing of surgery
is controversial but it is usually performed in adolescence after attaining
puberty. In phenotypic females with partial androgen insensitivity, gonadectomy may be performed before puberty to avoid virilization.
Estrogen replacement therapy is given in phenotypic females.
High-dose androgen therapy in males with Reifenstein’s syndrome may
improve virilization.

335

336

CHAPTER 60

Disorders of sexual differentiation

True hermaphroditism
Pathogenesis
Pathogenesis is unknown. It may be familial.
Affected individuals have both ovarian and testicular tissue, either in the
same gonad (ovotestis), or an ovary on one side and a testis on the other.
A uterus and a fallopian tube are usually present, the latter on the side of
the ovary or ovotestis.
Wolfﬁan structures may be present in a 1/3 of individuals on the side of
the testis. The testicular tissue is usually dysgenetic, although the ovarian
tissue may be normal.

Clinical features
Most individuals have ambiguous genitalia and are raised as males, but just
under 10% have normal female external genitalia.
At puberty, 50% of individuals menstruate, which may present as cyclic
hematuria in males, and most develop breasts.
Feminization and virilization vary widely. Most are infertile, but fertility
has been reported.
There is a 2% risk of gonadal malignancy, higher in 46,XY individuals.

Evaluation
• 46,XX in 70%, 46,XX/46,XY in 20%, and 46,XY in 10%
• Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism is usual.
• Diagnosis can only be made on gonadal biopsy.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MANAGEMENT

General principles of management
Assignment of gender and reconstructive surgery
Virilized females (female pseudohermaphroditism)
Most individuals are brought up as females.
The timing of feminizing surgery remains controversial but is usually
deferred until adolescence. The decision should be made on an individual
basis, by a multidisciplinary specialist team, the parents and ideally the
patient. It appears that a signiﬁcant number of children who have surgery
performed during infancy will require further surgery in their teens.
The results of feminizing genitoplasty, which involves clitoral reduction
and vaginoplasty, with regard to sexual function are unclear.
Undervirilized males (male pseudohermaphroditism)
The decision regarding gender reassignment is more complex and depends
on the degree of sexual ambiguity in addition to the cause of the disorder
and the potential for normal sexual function and fertility.
Individuals with complete androgen insensitivity are assigned a female
sex, as they are resistant to testosterone therapy, develop female sexual characteristics, and have a female gender identity. They may require
vaginoplasty in adolescence.
Sex assignment of other forms of male pseudohermaphroditism depends
on phallic size. However, the decision should be made by a specialist multidisciplinary team involving parents who should be fully informed.
A trial of 3 months of testosterone may be used to enhance phallic
growth.
Penile reconstruction and orchidopexy by an experienced urologist may
be considered in some patients. Testicular prostheses may be required if
orchidopexy is not possible. The optimal procedure and timing of surgery
remain controversial and the decision should ideally be made with the
patient when he is old enough to give informed consent. Results of surgery
on sexual function are mixed.

Gonadectomy
There is i risk of gonadoblastoma in most individuals with abdominal testes. Risk is highest in those with dysgenetic gonads and Y chromosome
material. Bilateral gonadectomy should therefore be performed (usually
laparascopically).
Optimal timing of the gonadectomy is unknown. In androgen insensitivity,
the risk of gonadoblastoma appears to rise only after the age of 20 years,
so orchidectomy is recommended in adolescence after attaining puberty. In
most other disorders, gonadectomy prior to puberty is recommended.
Early bilateral orchidectomy should also be performed in 46, XY subjects with 5α-reductase deﬁciency or 17BHSD deﬁciency who are being
raised as females, to prevent virilization at puberty.

Hormonal therapy
Patients with disorders of adrenal biosynthesis, e.g., CAH, require lifelong
glucocorticoid and usually mineralocorticoid replacement therapy.

CHAPTER 60

Disorders of sexual differentiation

Most male pseudohermaphrodites and hermaphrodites being raised as
males require long-term testosterone replacement therapy.
Individuals with 5α-reductase deﬁciency usually receive supra-physiological doses of testosterone to achieve satisfactory DHT levels.
Subjects with androgen insensitivity and male pseudohermaphrodites
being raised as females should receive estrogen replacement therapy to
induce puberty and this should be continued thereafter.

Psychological support
Disorders relating to sexual identity and function require expert
counseling.
Patient support groups are often helpful.

ETIOLOGY

Transsexualism

Deﬁnition
Transsexualism is a condition in which an apparently anatomically and genetically normal person feels that he or she is a member of the opposite
sex. There is an irreversible discomfort with the anatomical gender, which
may be severe, often developing in childhood.

Epidemiology
• More common in males
• Estimated prevalence of 1:13,000 males and 1:30,000 females

Etiology
Etiology is unknown and controversial.
There is some evidence that it may have a neurobiological basis. There
appear to be sex differences in the size and shape of certain nuclei in
the hypothalamus. Male-to-female transsexuals have been found to have
female differentiation of one of these nuclei, whereas female-to-male
transsexuals have been found to have a male pattern of differentiation.

339

CHAPTER 61

Transsexualism

Management
Standards of care
A multidisciplinary approach between psychiatrists, endocrinologists, and
surgeons is required. The patient should be counseled about treatment
options, risks, and implications and realistic expectations discussed.
Endocrine disorders should be excluded prior to entry into the gender
reassignment program—i.e., ensure normal internal and external genitalia,
karyotype, gonadotropins, and testosterone/estradiol.
Psychiatric assessment and follow-up is essential before deﬁnitive therapy. The transsexual identity should be shown to have been persistently
present for at least 2 years to ensure a permanent diagnosis.
Following this period, the patient should dress and live as a member of the
desired sex under the supervision of a psychiatrist. This should continue for
at least 3–6 months before hormonal treatment and 1 year before surgery.
Psychological follow-up and expert counseling should be available if
required throughout the program, including after surgery.
In adolescents, puberty can be reversibly halted by GnRH analog therapy, to prevent irreversible changes in the wrong gender, until a permanent diagnosis is made.

Hormonal manipulation
For contraindications, b see Box 61.1.
Male-to-female transsexuals
• Suppress male secondary sex characteristics: GnRH analog or highdose sex steroids
• Induce female secondary sex characteristics
• EE2 100 mcg/day or Premarin 1.25 mg or estradiol patch 100 mcg
2 x /week
Aims
• Breast development—maximum after 2 years of treatment. Add
progestin short term after maximal estrogen therapy to differentiate
ductules, but not needed long term
• Development of female fat distribution

• The dose of estrogen may be halved after gender reassignment surgery
(Table 61.1).
• Change to transdermal estrogens if >40 years old. Change to HT
doses once >50 years old.
• Adjust estrogen dose depending on plasma LH and estradiol levels.
Side effects

• Venous thromboembolism
• Atherosclerosis
• Abnormal liver enzymes
• Depression
• ?i Risk of breast cancer
Female-to-male transsexuals

secondary sex characteristics: parenteral testosterone (b see Table 61.1).
Aims
• Cessation of menstrual bleeding
• Atrophy of uterus and breasts
• Increase muscle bulk and strength
• Deepening of voice (after 6–10 weeks)

CHAPTER 62

Thyroid disorders

Thyroid disorders

Normal physiology
Effect of pregnancy on thyroid function
• Iodine stores fall due to i renal clearance and transplacental transfer to
fetus.
• Thyroid size: increase in thyroid volume by 10–20% due to hCG
stimulation and relative iodine deﬁciency
• Thyroglobulin: rise corresponds to rise in thyroid size.
• Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG): 2-fold increase in concentration as a
result of reduced hepatic clearance and i synthesis stimulated by
estrogen. Concentration plateaus at 20 weeks’ gestation and falls again
postpartum.
• Total T4 and T3: i concentrations, corresponding to rise in TBG
• Free T4 and T3: small rise in concentration in ﬁrst trimester due to
hCG stimulation then fall into normal range. During the second and
third trimesters, FT4 concentration is often just below the normal
reference range.
• Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) is within normal limits in pregnancy. However, it is suppressed in 13.5% in the ﬁrst trimester, 4.5%
in the second trimester, and 1.2% in the third trimester due to hCG
thyrotropic effect. There is a positive correlation between free T4 and
hCG levels and a negative correlation between TSH and hCG levels in
the ﬁrst half of pregnancy.
• Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is normal.
• TSH receptor antibodies: When present in high concentrations in maternal serum these may cross the placenta. Antibody titer decreases with
progression of the pregnancy.

Fetal thyroid function
TRH and TSH synthesis occurs by 8–10 weeks’ gestation, and thyroid hormone synthesis occurs by 10–12 weeks’ gestation.
TSH, total and freeT4 and T3, and TBG concentrations increase progressively throughout gestation.
Maternal TSH does not cross the placenta, and although TRH crosses
the placenta, it does not regulate fetal thyroid function. Iodine crosses the
placenta and excessive quantities may induce fetal hypothyroidism. Maternal
T4 and T3 cross the placenta in small quantities and are important for fetal
brain development in the ﬁrst half of gestation.

MATERNAL HYPERTHYROIDISM

Maternal hyperthyroidism
b See Thyrotoxicosis in pregnancy (p. 31).

Incidence
This condition affects 0.2% of pregnant women. Most patients are diagnosed before pregnancy or in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.
In women with Graves’ disease in remission, exacerbation may occur in
the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy.
Graves’ disease
The most common scenario is pregnancy in a patient with pre-existing
Graves’ disease on treatment, as fertility is low in patients with untreated
thyrotoxicosis. Newly diagnosed Graves’ disease in pregnancy is unusual.
Aggravation of disease occurs in the ﬁrst trimester with amelioration in
second half of pregnancy because of a decrease in maternal immunological
activity at that time.
Symptoms of thyrotoxicosis are difﬁcult to differentiate from those
of normal pregnancy. The most sensitive symptoms are weight loss and
tachycardia. Goiter is found in most patients.
Management
Risks of uncontrolled hyperthyroidism to mother include heart failure and
arryhthmias.
Antithyroid drugs (ATDs) are the treatment of choice but cross the
placenta. Propylthiouracil is preferred, although the risk of aplasia cutis,
a rare fetal scalp defect, with carbimazole is negligible. There is also less
transfer to breast milk.
Avoid B-blockers, as they may be associated with fetal growth impairment with prolonged use. They can be used initially for 2–3 weeks while
antithyroid drugs take affect.
Most patients will be on a maintenance dose of an ATD. A high dose
of ATD may be necessary initially to achieve euthyroidism as quickly as
possible (carbimazole 20–40 mg/day or propylthiouracil 200–400 mg/day)
in newly diagnosed patients, then the minimal dose of ATD can be used
to maintain euthyroidism.
Do not use a block-replace regime, as higher doses of ATDs are
required and there is minimal transplacental transfer of T4, thereby risking
fetal hypothyroidism.
Monitor TFTs every 4–6 weeks.
Aim to keep FT4 at the upper limit of normal and TSH low–normal.
In approximately 30% of women, ATDs may be discontinued at 32–36
weeks’ gestation. Consider doing this if the patient is euthyroid for at
least 4 weeks on the lowest dose of propylthiouracil, but continue to
monitor TFTs frequently. Presence of a large goiter or ophthalmopathy
suggests severe disease; the chances of remission are low, so do not stop
the ATD.
Risks of neonatal hypothyroidism and goiter are reduced if the woman
is on 200 mg propylthiouracil or less (or carbimazole 20 mg) in the last
few weeks of gestation.

347

348

CHAPTER 62

Thyroid disorders

Propylthiouracil (PTU) is secreted in negligible amounts in breast milk.
Carbimazole is secreted in higher amounts. Breast-feeding is not contraindicated if the mother is on <150 mg PTU or 5 mg carbimazole. Give in
divided doses after the feeds and monitor neonatal thyroid function.
Surgical management of thyrotoxicosis is rarely necessary in pregnancy.
The only indication is serious ATD complication (e.g., agranulocytosis) or
drug resistance. There is a possible i risk of spontaneous abortion or premature delivery associated with surgery during pregnancy.
Radioiodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnancy and for 4 months
beforehand.
Infants born to mothers with Graves’ disease
Risks to fetus of uncontrolled thyrotoxicosis
• i Risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth
• Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)
• Premature labor
• Fetal or neonatal hyperthyroidism.
Follow-up of babies born to mothers on ATDs shows normal weight,
height, and intellectual function.
Fetal hypothyroidism
This may occur following treatment of a mother with high doses of ATDs
(>200 mg PTU/day), particularly in the latter half of pregnancy. This condition is rare and may be diagnosed by demonstrating a large fetal goiter on
fetal US in the presence of fetal bradycardia.
Fetal hyperthyroidism
This may occur after week 25 of gestation. It results in IUGR, fetal goiter,
and tachycardia (fetal heart rate >160 bpm). It may develop if the mother
has high titers of TSH-stimulating antibodies (TSAb). Treat by giving the
mother an ATD, and monitor fetal heart rate (aim <140 bpm), growth,
and goiter size.
Neonatal thyrotoxicosis
This develops in 1% of infants born to thyrotoxic mothers. It is due to placental transfer of TSAb. It is transient, usually subsiding by 6 months, but
there is up to 30% mortality if left untreated.
Treat with ATD and B-blockers.
Hyperemesis gravidarum (gestational hyperthyroidism)
• Characterized by severe vomiting and weight loss. Cause unknown
• Begins in early pregnancy (week 6–9 of gestation) and tends to resolve
spontaneously by week 20 of gestation
• Biochemical hyperthyroidism in two-thirds of affected women, but T3
is less commonly elevated. Mechanism: hCG has TSH-like effect, thus
stimulating the thyroid gland and suppressing TSH secretion
• Degree of thyroid stimulation correlates with severity of vomiting.
• No other evidence of thyroid disease, i.e., no goiter or history of
thyroid disease, no ophthalmopathy, and negative thyroid autoantibodies
• Antithyroid drugs are not required and do not improve symptoms of
hyperemesis.

MATERNAL HYPOTHYROIDISM

Causes of maternal hyperthyroidism
•
•
•
•

Graves’ disease (85% of cases)
Toxic nodule
Toxic multinodular goiter
Hydatidiform mole

Maternal hypothyroidism
Prevalence
• 2.5% subclinical hypothyroidism
• 1–2% overt hypothyroidism

Risks of suboptimal treatment during pregnancy
• Spontaneous abortion: 2-fold i risk.
• Pre-eclampsia: 21% of suboptimally treated mothers have pregnancyinduced hypertension (PIH).
• Also, i risk of anemia during pregnancy and postpartal hemorrhage
• Risk of impaired fetal intellectual and cognitive development
• i Risk of perinatal death
• Other risks to fetus include those associated with PIH (IUGR,
premature delivery, etc).
• The risk of congenital malformations is not thought to be i.

Management
Spontaneous pregnancy in overtly hypothyroid women is unusual, as hypothyroid women are likely to have anovulatory menstrual cycles.
• Levothyroxine therapy: Start on 150 mcg. Measure TSH 4 weeks later.
• If already on T4 before pregnancy, assess TSH at 6–8 weeks’ gestation,
then between weeks 16–20, then again between weeks 28–32 of gestation.
• Aim: TSH—lower part of normal range; FT4—upper end of normal
• Increase T4 dose by 30% (an average of 25–50 mcg) when pregnancy
is conﬁrmed. After delivery, thyroid requirements decrease to prepregnancy levels.Do not give FeSO4 simultaneously with T4—this
reduces its efﬁcacy. Separate times for drug ingestion by at least 2 hours.

Causes of maternal hypothyroidism
•
•
•
•

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (most common cause)
Previous radioiodine therapy or thyroidectomy
Previous postpartum thyroiditis
Hypopituitarism

Positive thyroid antibodies but euthyroid
2-Fold excess risk of spontaneous abortion
No other complications
No risk of neonatal hypothyroidism
Risk of PIH not i
The occasional mother will develop hypothyroidism toward the end of
the pregnancy, so check TSH between weeks 28–32 of gestation.
• i Risk of postpartum thyroiditis, so check TSH at 3 months postpartum

CHAPTER 62

Thyroid disorders

Postpartum thyroid dysfunction
Prevalence
• 5–10% of women within 1 year of delivery or miscarriage
• 3 × more common in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus

Etiology
• Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis ( b see Other types of thyroiditis,
p. 49)

Clinical presentation
Hyperthyroidism (32%)
• Within 4 months of delivery
• The most common symptom is fatigue.
• Usually resolves spontaneously in 2–3 months
Hypothyroidism (43%)
• Develops 4–6 months after delivery
• Symptoms may be mild and nonspeciﬁc.
• There may be an i risk of postpartum depression.
Hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism (25%)
• Spontaneous recovery in 80% within 6–12 months of delivery

Differential diagnosis
Graves’ disease may relapse in the postpartum period. This is differentiated
from postpartum thyroiditis by a high uptake on radioiodine scanning.
Lymphocytic hypophysitis may cause hypothyroidism. However, serum
TSH concentrations are inappropriately low.

Investigation
Thyroid peroxidase antibodies are positive in 80%.
Radionuclide uptake scans are rarely necessary. However, there is low
uptake during the thyrotoxic phase, differentiating it from Grave’s disease
where uptake is increased.

Management
• B-blockers if thyrotoxic and symptomatic until TFTs normalize.
Antithyroid medication is unnecessary.
• Levothyroxine if TSH>10 or if TSH between 4–10 and symptomatic
There is no consensus on how long to treat with thyroxine. There are
two options:
• Halve the dose at about 12 months postnatal and check TFTs 6 weeks
later. If normal, then withdraw T4 and check TFTs 6 weeks later.
• Withdraw treatment 1 year after completion of family.

Prognosis
There is recurrence in future pregnancies in 70% of women.
Permanent hypothyroidism develops in up to 50% of women within 10 years.
If treatment is withdrawn, then annual TSH measurements are essential.

Pituitary disorders

Pituitary disorders

Normal anatomical changes
during pregnancy
• Prolactin (PRL)-secreting cells: marked lactotrope hyperplasia during
pregnancy
• Gonadotropin-secreting cells: marked reduction in size and number
• TSH and ACTH-secreting cells: no change in size or number
• Anterior pituitary: Size increases by up to 70% during pregnancy. It
may take 1 year to shrink to near pre-pregnancy size in nonlactating
women. Gradual slight increase in size with each pregnancy
• MRI: enlarged anterior pituitary gland, but stalk is midline. Posterior
pituitary gland may not be seen in late pregnancy.

NORMAL PHYSIOLOGY DURING PREGNANCY

Normal physiology during pregnancy
Serum PRL
Concentrations increase markedly during pregnancy and fall again to
pre-pregnancy levels approximately 2 weeks postpartum in nonlactating
women.
Serum LH and FSH
There are undetectable levels in pregnancy and a blunted response to
GnRH because of negative feedback inhibition from high levels of sex hormones and PRL.
Serum TSH, T4, and T3
TSH may be suppressed in the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. Free thyroid
hormones usually within the normal range.
Growth hormone (GH) and IGF-I
There are low maternal GH levels and a blunted response to hypoglycemia due to placental production of a GH-like substance. IGF-I levels are
normal or high in pregnancy.
ACTH and cortisol
CRH, ACTH, and cortisol levels are high in pregnancy, as both CRH
and ACTH are produced by the placenta. In addition, estrogen-induced
increase in cortisol-binding globulin (CBG) synthesis during pregnancy will
further increase maternal plasma cortisol concentrations.
During the latter half of pregnancy there is a progressive increase of ACTH
and cortisol levels, peaking during labor. Incomplete suppression of cortisol
occurs following dexamethasone suppression test, along with an exaggerated
response of cortisol to CRH stimulation. However, normal diurnal variation
persists.

353

354

CHAPTER 63

Pituitary disorders

Prolactinoma in pregnancy
Effect of pregnancy on tumor size
Risk of signiﬁcant tumor enlargement (i.e., resulting in visual ﬁeld disturbances or headaches):
• Microadenoma (1–2%)
• Macroadenoma (15–35%)
• Macroadenoma treated with surgery and/or radiotherapy before
pregnancy (4–7%)

Effect of dopamine agonists on the fetus
Bromocriptine
Over 6000 pregnancies have occurred in women receiving bromocriptine
in early pregnancy, and the incidence of complications in these pregnancies
with regard to fetal outcome is similar to that of the normal population,
indicating that bromocriptine is probably safe in early pregnancy.
Data are available on children whose mothers received bromocriptine
throughout pregnancy, and again the incidence of congenital abnormalities
is negligible.
Cabergoline
This is also probably safe in early pregnancy, with no i risk of fetal loss
or congenital abnormalities, although fewer data are available. It is thus
recommended that women with prolactinomas seeking fertility receive
bromocriptine to induce ovulation, as there are more data on the longterm safety of bromocriptine. Cabergoline is being used increasingly, as it
is better tolerated.

Management
Microprolactinoma
Initiate dopamine agonist therapy to induce normal ovulatory cycles and
fertility. Stop bromocriptine as soon as pregnancy is conﬁrmed.
Assess for visual symptoms and headache at each trimester, although
the risk of complications is low (<5%). Serum PRL levels are difﬁcult to
interpret during pregnancy, as they are normally elevated and are thus are
not routinely measured.
MRI is indicated in the occasional patient who becomes symptomatic.
In the postpartum period, recheck serum PRL level after cessation of
breast-feeding. Reassess size of microprolactinoma by MRI only if the
serum PRL level is higher than pre-pregnancy concentrations.
There is a 40–60% chance of remission of microprolactinoma following
pregnancy.
Macroprolactinoma
Management is controversial and must therefore be individualized. There
are three possible approaches:
• Bromocriptine may be used throughout pregnancy to reduce the risk
of tumor growth. The patient is monitored by visual ﬁelds at each
trimester, or more frequently if symptoms of tumor enlargement
develop. This is probably the safest and thus preferred approach.

PROLACTINOMA IN PREGNANCY

• Bromocriptine or cabergoline may be used to induce ovulation
and then stopped after conception. However, the patient must be
monitored very carefully during pregnancy with monthly visual ﬁeld
testing.
• If symptoms of tumor enlargement develop or there is deterioration
in visual ﬁelds, an MRI should be performed to assess tumor growth. If
signiﬁcant tumor enlargement develops, bromocriptine therapy should
be initiated.
• Alternatively, the patient may undergo surgical debulking of the tumor
and/or radiotherapy before seeking fertility. This will signiﬁcantly
reduce the risk of complications associated with tumor growth.
However, this approach may render them gonadotropin deﬁcient.
These patients should again be monitored during pregnancy using
regular visual ﬁelds.
• There is no contraindication to breast-feeding.
• MRI should be performed in the postpartum period in women with
macroprolactinomas to look for tumor growth.

355

356

CHAPTER 63

Pituitary disorders

Cushing’s syndrome
Pregnancy is rare in women with untreated Cushing’s syndrome, as 75% of
them will experience oligo- or amenorrhea.
The diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome is difﬁcult to establish during pregnancy. However, the presence of purple striae and proximal myopathy
should alert the physician to the diagnosis of Cushing’s syndrome.
If suspected, the investigation of Cushing’s syndrome should be carried out as in the nonpregnant state. However, high urinary free cortisols
and nonsuppression of cortisol production on a low-dose dexamethasone
suppression test may be features of a normal pregnancy. The diurnal variation of cortisol secretion is preserved in normal pregnancy.
Diagnosis is important, as pregnancy in Cushing’s syndrome is associated
with a high risk of maternal and fetal complications ( b see Table 63.1).
Adrenal disease is the most common cause of Cushing’s syndrome
developing in pregnancy, responsible for over 50% of reported cases.

Management
First trimester
• Offer termination of pregnancy and instigate treatment, particularly if
adrenal carcinoma
• Alternatively, surgical treatment early in the second trimester
Second trimester
• Surgery, e.g., adrenalectomy or pituitary adenomectomy. There is a
minimal risk to the fetus.
Third trimester
• i Risk of diabetes mellitus
• Deliver baby as soon as possible (preferably by vaginal delivery to
minimize the risk of poor wound healing following a Caesarian section)
and instigate treatment.

ACROMEGALY

Metyrapone used in doses of <2g/day appears to be safe in pregnancy.
Postoperative glucocorticoid replacement therapy will be required.
Treatment of Cushing’s syndrome in pregnancy may reduce maternal
and fetal morbidity and mortality.

Acromegaly
Fertility in acromegaly is reduced, partly due to hyperprolactinemia (if
present) in addition to secondary hypogonadism. However, there have
been several reported cases of pregnancy in acromegaly.
Acromegaly increases the risk of gestational diabetes and hypertension.
However, in the absence of diabetes mellitus, there does not appear to
be an excess of perinatal morbidity or mortality in babies born to women
with acromegaly.
Signiﬁcant tumor enlargement occasionally occurs together with
enlargement of the normal pituitary lactotropes, so monthly visual ﬁeld
testing is recommended. It may be treated with bromocriptine until there
are more safety data on other forms of treatment. However, treatment
may be deferred until after delivery in the majority of patients.
Few data are available on the use of somatostatin analogs during pregnancy, so their routine use is currently not recommended as they cross
the placenta. However, there have been a few reports of uneventful pregnancies in patients treated with octreotide.

357

358

CHAPTER 63

Pituitary disorders

Hypopituitarism in pregnancy
Pre-existing hypopituitarism
This is most commonly due to surgical treatment of and/or radiotherapy
for a pituitary adenoma. Ovulation and thus conception may be induced
by gonadotropin stimulation.

Lymphocytic hypophysitis
b See also Lymphocytic hypophysitis (p. 137).
• Rare disorder thought to be autoimmune in origin
• Characterized by pituitary enlargement on imaging and variable loss of
pituitary function
• Most commonly seen in women in late pregnancy or in the ﬁrst year
postpartum.
• Symptoms are due to pressure effects, e.g., visual ﬁeld defects and
headaches, or to hormonal deﬁciency.
The most common hormonal deﬁciencies are as follows:
• ACTH and vasopressin deﬁciency
• TSH deﬁciency may also exist.
• Gonadotropins and GH levels are usually normal.
• PRL levels may be mildly elevated in a third, and low in a third.
Differential diagnosis
• Pituitary adenoma
• Sheehan’s syndrome
MRI often reveals diffuse homogenous contrast enhancement of the pituitary gland. However, the diagnosis is often only made deﬁnitively by pituitary biopsy.
There is an association with other autoimmune diseases, particularly
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.
The course is variable. Pituitary function may deteriorate or improve
with time.
Management
• Pituitary hormone replacement therapy as required
• Surgical decompression if pressure symptoms persist
• A course of high-dose steroid therapy is controversial, with mixed
results.

HYPOPITUITARISM IN PREGNANCY

Management of pre-existing hypopituitarism
during pregnancy
Hydrocortisone
The dose may need to be i in the third trimester of pregnancy by 10 mg/
day as the increase in CBG will reduce the bioavailability of hydrocortisone. Parenteral hydrocortisone in a dose of 100 mg IM every 6 hours
should be given during labor and the dose reduced back to maintenance
levels in the postpartum period (24–72 hours).
Thyroxine
Requirements may increase as the pregnancy progresses. Monitor free T4
each trimester and increase T4 dose accordingly.
GH
There are few data on the effects of GH on pregnancy, but case reports
do not suggest a detrimental effect on fetal outcome. However, until more
data accrue, GH should be stopped prior to pregnancy. Moreover, as the
placenta synthesizes a GH variant, GH therapy is unnecessary.
Vasopressin
The placenta synthesizes vasopressinase, which breaks down vasopressin
but not desmopressin. Women with partial diabetes insipidus may therefore require desmopressin treatment during pregnancy. Those already
receiving desmopressin may require a dose increment during pregnancy.
Vasopressinase levels fall rapidly after delivery.

Sheehan’s syndrome
Postpartum pituitary infarction or hemorrhage results in hypopituitarism.
This syndrome is increasingly uncommon in developed countries with
improvements in obstetric care.
Pathogenesis
The enlarged pituitary gland of pregnancy is susceptible to any compromise to its blood supply.
Investigations will conﬁrm hypopituitarism.
Risk factors
• Postpartum hemorrhage
• Type 1 diabetes mellitus
• Sickle cell disease
Clinical features
• Failure of lactation
• Involution of breasts
• Fatigue, lethargy, and dizziness
• Amenorrhea
• Loss of axillary and pubic hair
• Symptoms of hypothyroidism
• Diabetes insipidus is rare.
Management
• Pituitary hormone replacement therapy ( b see Background, p. 98)

NORMAL CHANGES DURING PREGNANCY

Adrenal disorders
during pregnancy

Normal changes during pregnancy
Changes in maternal adrenocortical function
Markedly iconcentrations of all adrenal steroids are due to i synthesis
and d catabolism.

Fetoplacental unit
Fetal adrenal gland
DHEAS is produced in vast quantities by the fetal adrenal gland. This is the
major precursor for estrogen synthesis by the placenta. The fetal adrenal
gland has a large capacity for steroidogenesis. Stimulus for fetal adrenal
gland is unknown—possibly hCG or PRL.
Placenta
Maternal glucocorticoids are largely inactivated in the placenta by 11BHSD.
Maternal androgens are converted to estrogens by placental aromatase,
thus protecting the female fetus from virilization.

361

CHAPTER 64

Adrenal disorders during pregnancy

Addison’s disease in pregnancy
There is no associated fetal morbidity in women who have pre-existing
primary adrenal insufﬁciency, as the fetus produces and regulates its own
adrenal steroids.
Management of Addison’s disease does not differ in pregnancy.
Glucocorticoids metabolized by placental 11BHSD are preferred (i.e.,
prednisolone or hydrocortisone), to avoid fetal adrenal suppression.
Increase hydrocortisone dose by about 10 mg during the third trimester
of pregnancy and at any time in case of intercurrent illness.
High-dose intramuscular hydrocortisone should be given at the time of
delivery to cover the stress of labor.
Doses may be tapered to normal maintenance doses in the postpartum
period ( b see Box 64.1).
Addison’s disease developing in pregnancy may result in an adrenal crisis, particularly at the time of delivery, because of a delay in diagnosis.
In early pregnancy, vomiting, fatigue, and hyperpigmentation and low BP
may be wrongly attributed to pregnancy. However, persisting symptoms
should alert the clinician.
If suspected, the diagnosis is conﬁrmed by the presence of low serum
cortisol concentrations with failure to rise following ACTH stimulation,
and high ACTH levels. However, the normal ranges for serum ACTH and
cortisol concentrations have not been established in pregnancy.
Chronic maternal adrenal insufﬁciency may be associated with intrauterine fetal growth restriction.
There is no i risk of developing Addison’s disease in the immediate postpartum period.

Box 64.1 Management of adrenal insufﬁciency
during pregnancy
• Hydrocortisone 20–30 mg PO in divided doses, as per pre-pregnancy
dose
• Fludrocortisone 50–200 mcg PO, as per pre-pregnancy dose
During uncomplicated labor
• Hydrocortisone 100 mg IM q6h for 24 hours, then reduce to
maintenance dose over 72 hours
• Keep the patient well hydrated.
• Fludrocortisone may be discontinued while on high doses of
hydrocortisone.

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Fertility is reduced, particularly women with the salt-wasting form of CAH.
Reasons for this are as follows:
• Inadequate vaginal introitus despite reconstructive surgery
• Anovulation as a result of hyperandrogenemia
• Adverse effects of elevated progestagen levels on endometrium
From 60 to 80% of women with CAH and an adequate vaginal introitus are
fertile. Fertility may be maximized by optimal suppression of hyperandrogenism by glucocorticoid therapy ( b see Management, p. 244).
No major complications in pregnancy are known in women with CAH,
apart from a possibly i incidence of pre-eclampsia. However, women are
more likely to require Caesarean section for cephalopelvic disproportion.
Management is the same as in the nonpregnant woman, and steroids are
i at the time of delivery as for Addison’s disease ( b p. 203).
Monitor serum testosterone and electrolytes every 6–8 weeks.
Risk to fetus
• There is no risk of virilization from maternal hyperandrogenism, as the
placenta will aromatize androgens to estrogens.
• Glucocorticoids do not increase the risk of congenital abnormalities.
• If the partner is a heterozygote or homozygote for CAH, the fetus
has a 50% risk of CAH. Prenatal treatment with dexamethasone
will then be necessary to avoid virilization of a female fetus (b see
Management of pregnancy in CAH, p. 245).

363

364

CHAPTER 64

Adrenal disorders during pregnancy

Pheochromocytoma
This condition is rare but potentially lethal in pregnancy. Maternal mortality
may still be as high as 17%, with 30% fetal mortality if not treated promptly.
The highest risk of hypertensive crisis and death is during labor.
Suspect pheochrocytoma in women with hypertension, persistent or
intermittent, especially in the absence of proteinuria or edema, hypertension developing before 20 weeks’ gestation, or persistent glycosuria.
Suspect it if paroxysmal symptoms are present: palpitations, sweating,
and headache.
Prenatal screening is recommended in high-risk women, e.g., those with
a history or family history of MEN-2 or von Hippel–Lindau syndrome.
Diagnose by 24-hour urinary catecholamine collection.
Tumor localization is important—MRI is the imaging of choice in
pregnancy.

Management
A-blockade
Phenoxybenzamine reduces fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. It
appears to be safe in pregnancy. The starting dose is 10 mg q12h and is
built up gradually to a maximum of 20 mg every 8 hours.
B -blockade
Propranolol is given only after adequate A-blockade. It may increase the
risk of intrauterine fetal growth restriction if started in the third trimester.
Give in a dose of 40 mg q8h.
Surgery
This is controversial. Some clinicians offer surgical removal of pheochromocytoma before 24 weeks’ gestation (which is relatively safe following
A- and B-blockade). After 24 weeks’ gestation, surgery should be deferred
until fetal maturity, and then it can be combined with Caesarean section
with removal of the tumor.
Ensure adequate adrenergic blockade before surgery. Operate after safe
delivery of the fetus.

Bone turnover
In order to ensure that bone can undertake its mechanical and metabolic
functions, it is in a constant state of turnover (see b Fig. 65.1).
• Osteoclasts, derived from the hematopoetic stem cell series, resorb
bone.
• Osteoblasts, derived from the mesenchymal cell precursors, make
bone.
• Osteocytes, buried osteoblasts, sense mechanical strain and secrete
factors important in bone homeostasis.

BONE MASS DURING LIFE

Bone mass during life
b See Fig. 65.2.
Bone is laid down rapidly during skeletal growth at puberty. Following
this there is a period of stabilization of bone mass in early adult life. After
the age of ~40, there is a gradual loss of bone in both sexes. This occurs
at the rate of approximately 0.5% annually.
However, in women after the menopause there is a period of rapid
bone loss. The accelerated loss is maximal immediately after the cessation of ovarian function but remains increased throughout life. The excess
bone loss associated with the menopause is of the order of 10% of skeletal
mass.
This menopause-associated loss coupled with lower peak bone mass
largely explains why osteoporosis and its associated fractures are more
common in women.

BONE TURNOVER MARKERS

Investigation of bone

Bone turnover markers
These may be useful in
• Assessing overall risk of osteoporotic fracture.
• Judging response to treatments for osteoporosis.

Resorption markers
Collagen cross-links
These make use of the fact that when collagen is laid down in bone, the
ﬁbers are held in trimers by covalent links. These links are chemically very
stable and are speciﬁc to the type of collagen. The excretion of fragments
containing these cross-links is a much better indicator of bone turnover.
It can be measured either as the excretion of the linking molecules
themselves, known as deoxypyridinoline cross-links, or as small fragments
of the ends of the collagen molecule including these cross-links, known as
telopeptides. These latter markers can be derived from either the N- or
the C-terminal of the collagen molecule, and separate assays are available
for each.
Assays are available for both blood and urine, although the former are
subject to less error and are preferred.
Urinary hydroxyproline
This relies on the fact that hydroxyproline is unique to collagen, thus
any hydroxyproline in urine must come from collagen breakdown.
Unfortunately, this is not speciﬁc to bone (type 1) collagen; furthermore,
hydroxyproline is variably metabolized before excretion and so its urinary
levels are not a true index of collagen destruction. It has accordingly been
superseded.

Formation markers
Total alkaline phosphatase is not speciﬁc; it is also found in the liver,
intestine, and placenta. It is relatively insensitive to small changes in bone
turnover and has only found general use in the monitoring of the activity
of Paget’s disease.
Bone-speciﬁc alkaline phosphatase is more speciﬁc but its clinical utility
is not yet clear.
Osteocalcin is a vitamin K–dependent protein that accounts for about
1% of bone matrix. The serum level of osteocalcin appears to reﬂect osteoblast activity. However, the results obtained with bone-speciﬁc alkaline
phosphatase and osteocalcin do not always correlate. This is particularly
true in Paget’s disease, where the osteocalcin is frequently scarcely elevated despite the marked increase in bone turnover.

369

370

CHAPTER 66

Investigation of bone

P1NP is a procollagen fragment released from the N terminal as type 1
collagen is laid down. When measured in the serum it is the most sensitive and speciﬁc marker of bone formation, although its clinical utility is
as yet unclear.

Bone imaging
Skeletal radiology
This is useful for the following:
• Diagnosis of fracture
• Diagnosis of speciﬁc diseases (e.g., Paget’s disease and osteomalacia)
• Identiﬁcation of bone dysplasia
It is not useful for assessing bone density.

Isotope bone scanning
Bone-seeking isotopes, particularly 99mtechnetium-labeled bisphosphonates, are concentrated in areas of localized i bone cell activity. They
are useful for identifying localized areas of bone disease such as fracture,
metastasis, or Paget’s disease.
However, isotope uptake is not selective, and so i activity on a scan
does not indicate the nature of the underlying bone disease. Hence, subsequent radiology of affected regions is frequently needed to establish
the diagnosis.
Isotope bone scans are particularly useful in Paget’s disease to establish
the extent of skeletal involvement and the underlying disease activity.

BONE MASS MEASUREMENTS

Bone mass measurements
b See Table 66.1.

Interpretation of results
The differences in normal ranges between the machines of different
manufacturers has led to the practice of quoting bone mass measurements in terms of the number of standard deviations (SDs) they lie from
an expected mean. This can be done in two ways: T score and Z score;
b see Table 66.2.
It is generally accepted that a reduction of 1 SD in bone density will
approximately double the risk of fracture.
The WHO has developed guidelines for the diagnosis of osteoporosis in
postmenopausal women (b see Table 66.3).
No similar criteria have been set in males, but the same thresholds are
generally accepted.
For some secondary causes of osteoporosis, particularly corticosteroid
use, it has been suggested that the less stringent criterion of T score <–1.5
be used as a treatment intervention threshold.

Bone biopsy
Bone biopsy is occasionally necessary for the diagnosis of difﬁcult patients
with metabolic bone disease. This is usually in the context of suspected
osteomalacia or a secondary cause of osteoporosis when the diagnosis is
uncertain.
Bone biopsy is not indicated for the routine diagnosis of osteoporosis.
It is best undertaken in specialist centers and requires ﬂuorescent labeling,
e.g., tetracycline.

BLOOD CONCENTRATION

Investigation of calcium,
phosphate, and magnesium

Blood concentration
Calcium
The importance of obtaining blood for calcium measurement in the fasting
state with little venous stasis has been overstated. It is, however, important to collect blood for the estimation of parathyroid hormone (PTH)
and phosphate levels after an overnight fast.
In most clinical situations, direct measurement of the ionized calcium
concentration is not necessary. However, it is important to correct
the measured calcium concentration for the prevailing level of albumin
(b see Box 67.1).

Phosphate and magnesium
Measurements of plasma phosphate and magnesium do not normally
require to be corrected for plasma proteins. However, phosphate should
be measured after an overnight fast.

374

CHAPTER 67

Investigation of calcium

Urine excretion
Calcium
A measurement of 24-hour excretion of calcium may be useful for the
assessment of the risk of renal stone formation, although the relationship is
not that robust to show calciﬁcation in states of chronic hypercalcemia.
In other circumstances, particularly the assessment of the cause of
hypercalcemia (primary hyperparathyroidism vs. familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia), an estimate of the renal handling of calcium is more useful. This is most commonly estimated from the ratio of the renal clearance
of calcium to that of creatinine in the fasting state (b see Box 67.2). If all
values are in mmol/L, the ratio is usually >0.02 in primary hyperparathyroidism; values <0.01 are suggestive of hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.
Other causes of hypocalciuria should be excluded, e.g., renal insufﬁciency, vitamin D deﬁciency, and some drugs.

Phosphate
A 24-hour measurement of phosphate excretion largely reﬂects dietary
phosphate intake and has little clinical utility.

Box 67.2 Calculation of calcium/creatinine excretion ratio

CALCIUM-REGULATING HORMONES

Calcium-regulating hormones
Parathyroid hormone
Reliable immunoassays for PTH are now available. In general, these are
two-site assays aimed at estimating the concentration of the intact PTH
molecule. PTH is relatively labile and specimens require careful handling,
including early separation from the cells and speedy freezing for storage if
the assay is not performed immediately.
Since PTH secretion is suppressed by calcium ingestion, it should be
measured in the fasting state. The normal range depends on the precise
assay employed, but typical values are 10–60 pg/mL (1–6 pmol/L).
In African Americans, levels are typically higher than in Caucasians.

Vitamin D and its metabolites
25OH vitamin D (25OHD)
This is the main storage form of vitamin D and the best measure of vitamin D status. It is relatively stable, and samples do not require as speedy
handling as PTH. In clinical terms, it is the total vitamin D concentration
that is important.
The conventionally accepted normal range is 5–30 ng/mL (roughly 12.5–75
nmol/L). However, this normal range was set with the idea of avoiding frank
osteomalacia. If the 25OHD is 5–15 ng/mL, there is likely to be a state of vitamin D insufﬁciency with elevated PTH concentration and i bone turnover.
This can be associated with i risk of fracture, particularly in the elderly.
Low levels of 25OHD can result from a variety of causes (b see vitamin D deﬁciency, p. 399). Likewise, it is unlikely that serious intoxication
will occur unless the 25OHD is >100 ng/mL. A more pragmatic reference
range might be in the region of 20–80 ng/mL (50–200 nmol/L). (For conversion from ng/mL to nmol/L, multiply by 2.46.)
1,25(OH)2 vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D)
Although this is the active form of vitamin D, measurement of its concentration is less often clinically useful than measurement of 25OHD or PTH.
It is sometimes useful as a marker of PTH activity and in diseases such as
sarcoidosis where there is i extrarenal synthesis of 1,25(OH)2D.
The normal range is generally accepted as 20–60 pg/mL (50–125 pmol/L),
depending on the assay.

Parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP)
It is possible to measure the level of this oncofetoprotein in serum.
Although it is raised in many cases of humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, the diagnosis is usually readily made from other sources (i.e., Ca
with suppressed PTH) and this measurement is noncontributory.
PTHrP is highly labile. Specimens need to be collected into special preservative (Trasylol®), separated, and stored rapidly after venipuncture.

Calcitonin
Calcitonin assays are available but are limited to diagnosis and monitoring of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. There is no role for calcitonin
measurements in routine investigation of calcium and bone metabolism.

CHAPTER 68

Hypercalcemia

Hypercalcemia

Epidemiology
Hypercalcemia is found in 5% of hospital patients but in only 0.5% of the
general population.

Causes
Many different disease states can lead to hypercalcemia. These are listed
by order of importance in hospital practice in Box 68.1. In asymptomatic
community-dwelling subjects, the vast majority of hypercalcemia is the
result of hyperparathyroidism.

Box 68.1 Causes of hypercalcemia
Common
Hyperparathyroidism
• Primary
• Tertiary
Malignancy
• Humoral hypercalcemia
• Multiple myeloma
• Bony metastases
Less common
• Vitamin D intoxication.
• Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia
• Sarcoidosis and other granulomatous diseases
Uncommon
• Thiazide diuretics
• Lithium
• Immobilization (may be more common with Paget’s patients)
• Hyperthyroidism
• Renal failure
• Addison’s disease
• Vitamin A intoxication

CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical features
Notwithstanding the underlying cause of hypercalcemia, the clinical features
are similar. With corrected calcium levels <3.0 mmol/L (<12 mg/ml) it is
unlikely that any symptoms will be related to the hypercalcemia itself. With
progressive increases in calcium concentration the likelihood of symptoms
increases.
The clinical features of hypercalcemia are well recognized (listed in
Box 68.2). Unfortunately, they are nonspeciﬁc and may equally relate to
underlying illness.
Clinical signs of hypercalcemia are rare. With the exception of band
keratopathy, these are not speciﬁc. It is important to seek clinical evidence
of underlying causes of hypercalcemia, particularly malignant disease.
In addition to these speciﬁc symptoms of hypercalcemia, symptoms of
the long-term consequences of hypercalcemia should be sought. These
include the presence of bone pain or fracture and renal stones. These tend
to indicate the presence of chronic hypercalcemia.

Investigation of hypercalcemia
Conﬁrm the diagnosis
• Plasma calcium (corrected for albumin)

HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

Hyperparathyroidism
Primary hyperparathyroidism is present in up to 1 in 500 of the general population where it is predominantly a disease of postmenopausal women.
The normal physiological response to hypocalcemia is an increase in
PTH secretion. This is termed secondary hyperparathyroidism and is not
pathological in as much as the PTH secretion remains under feedback control. Continued stimulation of the parathyroid glands can lead to autonomous production of PTH.
This in turn causes hypercalcemia, which is termed tertiary hyperparathyroidism. This is usually seen in the context of renal disease but can
occur in any state of chronic hypocalcemia, such as vitamin D deﬁciency
or malabsorption.

Pathology: primary hyperparathyroidism
• 85% single adenoma
• 14% hyperplasia
• Often associated with other endocrine abnormalities, particularly
multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) types I and II (b see Chapter 91,
MEN type 1, p. 499; Chapter 92, MEN type 2, p. 503).
• <1% carcinoma

Clinical features
• Most patients are asymptomatic.
• Features of hypercalcemia
• End-organ damage—b see Box 68.3.

Natural history
In most patients without end-organ damage disease is benign and stable.
A signiﬁcant minority (2–3% per annum, depending on the series) will
develop new indications for surgery.
Excess deaths are due to diabetes and vascular diseases.

Investigation (Box 68.4)
Potential diagnostic pitfalls are as follows:
• Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH)—differentiate with
calcium/creatine excretion ratio (b see Familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia, p. 387) (<0.01 in FHH, >0.02 in hyperparathyroidism)
• Long-standing vitamin D deﬁciency in which the concomitant
osteomalacia and calcium malabsorption can mask hypercalcemia,
which becomes apparent only after vitamin D repletion. Consider
other causes of a raised PTH (Box 68.5.)
• Drugs associated with hypercalcemia (e.g., thiazides and lithium)
Investigation is, therefore, aimed primarily at determining the presence of
end-organ damage from the hypercalcemia to determine whether operative intervention is indicated.

HYPERPARATHYROIDISM

Exclusion of underlying condition
Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHP) can be associated with genetic abnormalities, especially MEN I and II, as well as familial hyperparathyroidism.
These conditions should be sought in patients presenting with PHP and
a family history in 1 ﬁrst-degree relative, or at a young age (<40 years).

Localization of abnormal parathyroid glands
This should only form part of a preoperative assessment and is not indicated in the initial diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism.
Localization with two separate techniques (usually US and 99mTc-sestamibi) is usual before performing minimally invasive parathyroidectomy.
Otherwise, bilateral neck exploration by an experienced surgeon is optimal in the ﬁrst instance.
After failed neck exploration, other techniques may be needed:
• 99mTc-sestamibi
• –thallium/technetium subtraction scanning (less sensitive)
• CT
• US
Following failed neck exploration, it is often useful to undertake angiography with selective venous sampling. This should be conﬁned to specialist
centers.

This approach is suitable for patients with mild disease with no evidence
of end-organ damage. Such patients can continue for many years without
deterioration.
They require follow up:
• Annual plasma calcium
• Creatinine annually
• Every 1–2 years BMD
Any signiﬁcant deterioration is an indication for surgery.

Medical management
This is only indicated if the patient is not suitable for surgery.
Hormone replacement therapy
• Reduces plasma and urine calcium
• Preserves bone mass
Consider the long-term risks (breast cancer, venous thrombosis, heart
disease, and stroke).
Bisphosphonates
• Only transient effect on plasma and urine calcium
• Preserve bone mass
Calcium-sensing receptor agonists
Cinacalcet (30 mg tid) will reduce plasma, but not urinary, calcium concentrations. It increases the sensitivity of calcium-sensing receptors decreasing
PTH secretion.
It is licensed for use in secondary hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid
carcinoma. It is not licensed for use in primary hyperparathyroidism.

Indications for surgery in primary hyperparathyroidism
It is generally accepted that all patients with symptomatic hyperparathyroidism or evidence of end-organ damage should be considered for parathyroidectomy. This would include the following:
• Deﬁnite symptoms of hypercalcemia. There is less good evidence
that nonspeciﬁc symptoms such as abdominal pain, tiredness, or mild
cognitive impairment beneﬁt from surgery.
• Impaired renal function

TREATMENT

• Renal stones (symptomatic or on radiograph)
• Parathyroid bone disease, especially osteitis ﬁbrosis cystica (low BMD
T score <2.5 and/or previous fragility fracture)
• Pancreatitis
Surgery may also be indicated when medical surveillance is neither desired
nor required.
Guidelines for the management of asymptomatic hyperparathyroidism
have been produced on the basis of a consensus development conference
in the United States.1 Indications for surgery in asymptomatic patients are
presented in Table 68.1.

Conservative management
Patients not managed with surgery require regular follow-up (see
Table 68.2).

CHAPTER 68

Hypercalcemia

Complications of parathyroidectomy
Mechanical
Vocal cord paresis
• Usually transient
• May be permanent with extensive exploration, particularly repeated
surgery
• May require Teﬂon® injection of vocal cord
Tracheal compression from hematoma

Metabolic (hypocalcemia)
Transient
• Due to suppression of remaining glands
• Usually causes little problem
• May sometimes require oral therapy with calcium ± vitamin D
metabolites
Severe
• Due to hungry bones (calcitriol 1 mcg/day and oral calcium, e.g.,
calcium citrate 1200 mg daily may be required for several weeks)
• Occurs in patients with pre-existing bone disease
• Prevent postoperative hypocalcemia or hungry bone disease through
pretreatment with calcium and vitamin D (1 g and 20 mcg
[800 IU], respectively, daily) for several weeks. Vitamin D insufﬁciency
is common in primary hyperparathyroidism. Serum calcium must be
monitored while on vitamin D replacement therapy.
• May settle with oral therapy but often requires IV calcium.

Outcome after surgery
Less than 10% fail to become normocalcemic; of these, half will respond
to a second operation. Relapse occurs in 1/20 patients with adenoma but
in 1/6 with hyperplasia.
All patients with parathyroid hyperplasia (including MEN) need indeﬁnite follow-up.
If the patient is rendered hypoparathyroid by surgery, they will need
lifelong supplements of calcium ± active metabolites of vitamin D. This can
lead to hypercalciuria, and the risk of stone formation may still be present
in these patients.

OTHER CAUSES OF HYPERCALCEMIA

Other causes of hypercalcemia
Hypercalcemia of malignancy
Mechanism (b See Table 68.3)
Clinical features
Hypercalcemia is usually a late manifestation of malignant disease and frequently indicates the presence of an untreatable tumor load (50% due
within 30 days). One exception to this is in small endocrine tumors such
as carcinoids and islet cell tumours, which can produce humoral mediators
of hypercalcemia (PTHrP) in the absence of signiﬁcant spread.
Hypercalcemic symptoms are nonspeciﬁc and frequently difﬁcult to distinguish from those of the underlying disease.
Investigation
b See investigation of hypercalcemia in Clinical features, p. 377.
Factors suggesting hypercalcemia of malignancy include the following:
• i Calcium
• d PTH
• Other features of malignant disease
• i PTHrP—not usually measured in clinical practice
Treatment
Frequently, patients requiring treatment will have severe symptomatic
hypercalcemia. Often emergency treatment is necessary to stabilize the
patient before conﬁrmation of the diagnosis of the underlying malignant
state can be conﬁrmed.

CHAPTER 68

Hypercalcemia

In such circumstances, the principles of management are the same as
those for severe hypercalcemia from any cause (b see Box 68.6).

Box 68.6 Management of severe hypercalcemia
1. Stabilization
Stabilize the level of hypercalcemia and prevent any further decline in
renal function. This requires the IV infusion of large quantities of 0.9%
saline, frequently 3–6 L over the ﬁrst 24 hours.
If there is a danger of salt and water retention, a loop diuretic should
be added. This is the only role of diuretics in the management of hypercalcemia. There is no evidence that they lead to sustained reduction in
plasma calcium. As they cause intravascular volume depletion, they can
worsen the situation and so should otherwise be avoided.
In very severe renal impairment, dialysis might help both stabilize the
ﬂuid balance and assist in the removal of calcium from the plasma.
2. Treating hypercalcemia
Once the patient is volume replete, it is necessary to treat the cause of the
hypercalcemia. The most effective therapy available for this is IV bisphosphonate. Although these agents are speciﬁc inhibitors of bone resorption,
they are often beneﬁcial when hypercalcemia is the result of i tubular
reabsorption of calcium brought about by PTHrP production.
• Vigorous rehydration 200–500 mL/hr
• Calciuresis with loop diuretics when normovolemia
• Disodium pamidronate 60–90 mg. Zoledronic acid 5 mg IV infusion
over 20 minutes, but creatinine clearance should be above 35 mL/min
• Calcium falls within 12 hours nadix 4–7 days
• Remains normal for 1–3 weeks.
IV bisphosphonate therapy is generally well tolerated, but a minority
of patient may develop i bone pain or a transient pyrexia and ﬂu-like
symptoms. Rarer complications include rashes and iritis.
Bisphosphonates have been associated with deterioration in renal
function. For this reason, they should not be given to patients until adequate rehydration has been administered. In addition, dose reduction
should be considered for patients with GFR <30 mL/min.
3. Treatment of resistant hypercalcemia
Although most patients will respond to IV bisphosphonates, not all will
do so. In such cases, treatment with calcitonin may be helpful. This is
usually given as salmon calcitonin and may need to be given as high
doses of up to 400 IU by IM injection every 6 hours. In addition to the
large volume of injection required, this is frequently poorly tolerated,
with side effects such as ﬂushing and nausea.
Some cases of resistant hypercalcemia will respond to corticosteroid
therapy, which needs to be given in high doses, such as prednisolone
40 mg daily.

VITAMIN D INTOXICATION

Familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia (FHH)
FHH is also known as familial benign hypercalcemia.
• 2% of all asymptomatic hypercalcemia
• Autosomal dominant with virtually complete penetrance
• Mutation occurs in the calcium-sensing receptor that reduces its
sensitivity such that the body behaves as if it were experiencing
normocalcemia, even though the plasma calcium level is elevated.
• Generally benign and is not usually associated with symptoms or
adverse effects such as renal stones or bone disease
• Does not usually show any sustained beneﬁt from parathyroidectomy
• A few adults with FHH have had recurrent pancreatitis. In such cases,
parathyroidectomy may reduce the frequency of attacks.
• The homozygous state produces severe life-threatening hypercalcemia
soon after birth (neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism). In such cases,
total parathyroidectomy is life saving.
• Patients have low urine calcium excretion (24 hours <2.5 mmol, fasting
calcium/creatine excretion ration <0.01; b see Box 68.2, p. 377).

Pallais JC, Kifor O, Chen YB, et al. (2004). Acquired hypocalciuric hypercalcemia due to autoantibodies against the calcium-sensing receptor. N Engl J Med 351(4):362–369.

Vitamin D intoxication
The diagnosis is established by the presence of greatly elevated concentrations of 25OHD (>100 ng/mL) and 1,25(OH)2D together with suppressed
PTH. If calcitriol or alfacalcidol is the offending compound, then 25OHD
levels will not be elevated.
In mild cases, particularly when the active vitamin D metabolites are
involved, the only treatment necessary is to withdraw the offending
treatment and let the calcium levels settle. If the longer-acting vitamin D
metabolites are involved, active treatment may be necessary depending on
the level of increased calcium.
Patients should ﬁrst be stabilized with a saline infusion (b see Box 68.4,
p. 380).
Following this, the traditional management has been to give high-dose
oral corticosteroids such as prednisolone 40 mg daily. This reduces the
vitamin D–stimulated calcium absorption and may have beneﬁcial effects
on vitamin D metabolism following intoxication.
However, there is now emerging evidence to suggest that bisphosphonates given as for hypercalcemia of malignancy are equally effective.

387

388

CHAPTER 68

Hypercalcemia

Sarcoidosis
Together with other granulomatous disorders, sarcoidosis causes hypercalcemia by extrarenal production of 1,25(OH)2D in granulomata. This
process is not under feedback inhibition, but is substrate regulated. The
hypercalcemia is therefore dependent on vitamin D supply.
Patients frequently present with hypercalcemia in the summer or following foreign holidays when endogenous production of vitamin D is
maximal.
The biochemical picture is of normal 25OHD, raised 1,25(OH)2D, and
suppressed PTH. In addition, other markers of sarcoid activity, such as
raised angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity, are frequently
present.
Treatment with high-dose corticosteroids as in vitamin D intoxication
is generally recommended to control sarcoid activity and to minimize the
GI effects of the excess 1,25(OH)2D. The antifungal ketoconazole and the
antimalarial chloroquine (or its derivative, hydroxychloroquine) modulate
vitamin D metabolism and have been reported to reduce hypercalcemia
in patients with sarcoidosis.
If the calcium levels do not respond to these, there is evidence that
bisphosphonates might be useful in this situation.

CAUSES

Hypocalcemia

Causes
Although hypocalcemia can result from failure of any of the mechanisms
by which plasma calcium concentration is maintained, it is usually the
result of either failure of PTH secretion or the inability to release calcium
from bone. These causes are summarized in Box 69.1.

Box 69.1 Causes of hypocalcemia
Hypoparathyroidism
Destruction of parathyroid glands
• Autoimmune
• Surgical
• Radiation
• Inﬁltration
Failure of parathyroid development
• Isolated, e.g., X-linked
• With other abnormalities, e.g., DiGeorge syndrome (with thymic
aplasia, immunodeﬁciency, and cardiac anomalies)
Failure of PTH secretion
• Magnesium deﬁciency
• Overactivity of calcium sensing receptor
Failure of PTH action
• Pseudohypoparathyroidism—due to G protein abnormality
Failure of 1,25(OH)2D levels
• Drugs, e.g., ketoconazole
• Acute pancreatitis
• Acute systemic illness
Failure of release of calcium from bone
Osteomalacia
• Vitamin D deﬁciency
• Vitamin D resistance
• Renal failure
Inhibition of bone resorption
• Hypocalcemic drugs, e.g., cisplatin, calcitonin, oral phosphate,
bisphosphonates, rankl inhibitors

• Osteoblastic metastases (e.g., prostate)
• Hungry bone syndrome
Complexing of calcium from the circulation
• i Albumin binding in alkalosis
• Acute pancreatitis
• Formation of calcium soaps from autodigestion of fat
• Abnormal PTH and vitamin D metabolism
• Phosphate infusion
• Multiple blood transfusion—complexing by citrate

CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical features
The clinical features of hypocalcemia are largely a result of i neuromuscular excitability. In order of i severity, these include the following:
• Tingling—especially of ﬁngers, toes, or lips
• Numbness—especially of ﬁngers, toes, or lips
• Cramps
• Carpopedal spasm
• Stridor due to laryngospam
• Seizures
The symptoms of hypocalcemia tend to reﬂect the severity and rapidity of
onset of the metabolic abnormality.
Clinical signs of hypocalcemia depend on the demonstration of neuromuscular irritability before this necessarily causes symptoms:
• Chvostek’s sign is elicited by tapping the facial nerve in front of the ear.
A positive result is indicated by twitching of the corner of the mouth.
Slight twitching is seen in up to 15% of normal women, but more
major involvement of the facial muscles is indicative of hypocalcemia
or hypomagnesemia.
• Trousseau’s sign is produced by occlusion of the blood supply to the
arm by inﬂation of a sphygmomanometer cuff above arterial pressure
for 3 minutes. If positive, there will be carpopedal spasm, which may
be accompanied by painful paraesthesiae.In addition, there may be
clinical signs and symptoms associated with the underlying condition:
• Vitamin D deﬁciency may be associated with bone pain, fractures, or
proximal myopathy (b see p. 399).
• Hypoparathyroidism can be accompanied by mental retardation and
personality disturbances, as well as extrapyramidal signs, cataracts, and
papilloedema, basal ganglia calciﬁcation
• If hypocalcemia is present during development of the permanent teeth,
these may show areas of enamel hypoplasia. This can be a useful
physical sign indicating that the hypocalcemia is long-standing.

Pseudohypoparathyroidism
Resistance to parathyroid hormone action
Due to defective signaling of PTH action via cell membrane receptor
Also affects TSH, LH, FSH, and GH signaling
Most commonly caused by autosomal dominant mutation of GNAS1
gene
• Signiﬁcant imprinting:
• Maternal transmission leads to full-blown syndrome of hormone
resistance.
• Paternal transmission causes only phenotypic features of Albright’s
hereditary osteodystrophy.

CHAPTER 69

Hypocalcemia

Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy
Patients with the most common type of pseudohypoparathyroidism (type
Ia) have a characteristic set of skeletal abnormalities known as Albright’s
hereditary osteodystrophy. This comprises the following:
• Short stature
• Obesity
• Round face
• Short metacarpals
Some individuals with Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy do not
appear to have a disorder of calcium metabolism. In the past, the term
pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism was used to describe these patients’
condition. However, it is now clear that this reﬂects different manifestations of the same underlying genetic defect as a result of imprinting.
In light of the same underlying cellular abnormality, there has been a
tendency to avoid the more cumbersome designations and refer to all
such patients as having Albright’s hereditary osteodystrophy.

INVESTIGATION

Investigation
• Plasma calcium
• PTH—presence of a low or even normal PTH concentration implies
failure of PTH secretion.
• Serum 25 and 1-25 dihydroxy vitamin D
• Magnesium may be needed if the patient fails to respond.
• Ellsworth–Howard test if pseudohypoparathyroidism suspected
(b see Box 69.2)
In chronic hypocalcemia, skull radiographs will frequently demonstrate
calciﬁcation of the basal ganglia. As this is of no clinical consequence, it is
debatable whether the investigation can be justiﬁed.

Box 69.2 Modiﬁed Ellsworth–Howard test
Method
1. Fast overnight.
2. Give 200 mL water every 30 minutes from 6 A.M. to 11 A.M.
3. From 8:30 A.M., collect timed 30-minute urine samples for
phosphate, creatinine, and cAMP.
4. At 8:45 A.M., 10:15 A.M., and 10:45 A.M., collect blood for creatinine
and phosphate.
5. At 10:00 A.M., commence 10-minute infusion of synthetic PTH 1–34,
5 units/kg to a maximum of 200 units.
6. Calculate urinary cAMP excretion as:
cAMPE = [urine cAMP] × [plasma creatinine]/[urine creatinine]
7. Calculate tubular maximum for phosphate reabsorption:
TmP/GFR = ([plasma PO4] – PE)/(1 – 0.01 × loge([plasma PO4]/PE)
where PE = [urine PO4] × [plasma creatinine]/[urine creatinine] and
all measurements are in mmol/L
or using the nomogram of Walton and Bijvoet (1975; Lancet 2:309).
Interpretation
• Patients with a normal response to PTH will demonstrate a brisk
increase in cAMP excretion and a decrease in TmP.
• Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism type I show neither
response.
• There is a rarer condition, pseudohypoparathyroidism type II, in
which there is a normal cAMP response but a blunted phosphaturic
response.
• A similar pattern can be seen in some patients with profound
hypocalcemia due to vitamin D deﬁciency. It is therefore important
to ensure that patients are vitamin D replete before undertaking a
PTH infusion test.

394

CHAPTER 69

Hypocalcemia

Treatment
Acute symptomatic hypocalcemia is a medical emergency and demands
urgent treatment, whatever the cause (bsee Box 69.3).
Treatment of chronic hypocalcemia is more dependent on the cause.

Chronic hypocalcemia
Hypoparathyroidism
In hypoparathyroidism the aim is not to achieve normalization of the
plasma calcium, rather to render the patient asymptomatic with a plasma
calcium at or just below the normal lower limit. The reason for this is that
the renal retention of calcium brought about by PTH has been lost. Thus,
any attempt to raise the plasma calcium well into the normal range is likely
to result in unacceptable hypercalciuria, with the risk of nephrocalcinosis
and renal stones.

Box 69.3 Treatment of acute hypocalcemia
• Patients with tetany or seizures require urgent IV treatment with
calcium gluconate (less irritant than the chloride).
• This is a 10% w/v solution (10 mL = 2.25 mmol elemental calcium).
• The solution should always be further diluted to minimize the risk
of phlebitis or tissue damage if extravasation occurs.
• Initially, 20 mL of 10% calcium gluconate should be diluted in
100–200 mL of 0.9% saline or 5% glucose and infused over about
10 minutes.
• Repeat if symptoms are not resolved.
• Care must be taken if the patient has heart disease, especially if
taking digoxin, as too-rapid elevation of the plasma calcium can cause
arrhythmias. In such patients it is advisable to monitor the cardiac
rhythm during calcium infusion.
• To maintain the plasma calcium, give a continuous calcium infusion:
40 mL of 10% calcium gluconate should be added to 1 L of saline or
glucose solution and infused over 24 hours.
• The plasma calcium should be checked regularly (not less than
q6h) and the infusion rate adjusted in response to change in
concentration.
• Failure of the plasma calcium to respond to infused calcium should
raise the possibility of hypomagnesemia. This can be rapidly
ascertained by plasma magnesium estimation and, if appropriate, a
magnesium infusion commenced (b see Treatment, p. 566).
• In circumstances where hypoparathyroidism could be predicted
(such as block dissection of the neck), infusion of calcium gluconate
in an initial dose of 50 mL 10% solution (~11 mmmol Ca) diluted in
normal saline over 24 hours should be given to avoid postoperative
hypocalcemia. This dose should be adjusted in light of regular
calcium estimations.
• Once oral or NG tube intake is possible, calcium and active vitamin D
metabolites should be substituted as above.

TREATMENT

In patients with mild parathyroid dysfunction, it may be possible to
achieve acceptable calcium concentrations by using calcium supplements
alone. If used in this way, these need to be given in large doses, perhaps as
much as 1 g elemental calcium 3 × daily.
Most patients will not achieve adequate control with such treatment. In
those cases it is necessary to use vitamin D or its metabolites in pharmacological doses to maintain plasma calcium. The more potent analogs of
vitamin D, such as calcitriol or alfacalcidol, have the advantage over highdose calciferol that it is easier to make changes in therapy in response to
plasma calcium levels.
If hypercalcemia does occur, it settles much more quickly following
withdrawal of these compounds than ergocalciferol. The dose of vitamin D is determined by the clinical response but usually lies in the range
of 0.5–2 mcg of the potent analogs daily.
Hypercalcemia is the main hazard of such therapy. Plasma calcium levels
must be checked frequently after any change in therapy and no less than
every 3 months while on maintenance.
It is essential to ensure an adequate intake of calcium as well as vitamin D analogs. In some patients it is necessary to give calcium supplementation, particularly in the young. It is very rarely needed in patients
aged >60 years.
Pseudohypoparathyroidism
The principles underlying the treatment of pseudohypoparathyroidism are
the same as those underlying hypoparathyroidism.
Patients with the most common form of pseudohypoparathyroidism
may have resistance to the action of other hormones that rely on
G-protein signaling. They therefore need to be assessed for thyroid and
gonadal dysfunction (because of defective TSH or gonadotrophin action).
If these deﬁciencies are present, they need to be treated in the conventional manner.
Vitamin D deﬁciency
b Treatment of osteomalacia and vitamin D deﬁciency is described on
p. 399.
Overactivity of calcium-sensing receptor
This leads to a condition known as autosomal dominant hypocalcalcemia. It
is a benign condition in which the hypocalcemia is usually asymptomatic.
Treatment should be avoided in the absence of symptoms, as elevation of calcium levels even to within the normal range may cause renal
impairment.

CHAPTER 70

Rickets and osteomalacia

Rickets and osteomalacia

Deﬁnitions
Osteomalacia occurs when there is inadequate mineralization of mature
bone. Rickets is a disorder of the growing skeleton in which there is inadequate mineralization of bone as it is laid down at the epiphysis.
In most instances, osteomalacia leads to build-up of excessive unmineralized osteoid within the skeleton. In rickets there is build-up of unmineralized osteoid in the growth plate. This leads to the characteristic
radiological appearance of rickets with widening of the growth plate and
loss of deﬁnition of the ossiﬁcation centers.
These two related conditions may coexist.

Clinical features
Osteomalacia
•
•
•
•
•

Bone pain
Deformity

Hypocalcemia (in vitamin D deﬁciency)

• Growth retardation.
• Bone pain and fractures often occurring in unusual locations, e.g.,
scapular, pubic rami
• Skeletal deformity
• Bowing of the long bones
• Widening of the growth plates widening of the wrists, “rickety
rosary” (costochondral junctions enlarged)

DIAGNOSIS

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of osteomalacia is usually based on the appropriate biochemical ﬁndings (b see Table 70.1). Most patients with osteomalacia will
show no speciﬁc radiological abnormalities.
The most characteristic abnormality is the Looser’s zone or pseudo-fracture. If these are present they are virtually pathognomonic of
osteomalacia.
If the diagnosis of osteomalacia remains in doubt, a bone biopsy may be
necessary. This is often the only way of establishing the diagnosis in lowturnover conditions such as the toxic osteomalacias.
Bone biopsy shows not only excess osteoid but also prolonged mineralization lag time.

Box 70.1 Vitamin D resistance
Several different kindreds have been shown to have a defective vitamin
D receptor. This is inherited as an autosomal recessive condition. It
produces hypocalcemia and osteomalacia with elevated serum levels of
1,25(OH)2 D.
Approximately 2/3 of affected individuals have total alopecia. This condition is known as vitamin D–dependent rickets type II. If alopecia is
present, it is often termed type IIA, in contrast to type IIB, in which hair
growth is normal.
Treatment usually requires administration of large doses of active
vitamin D metabolites, sometimes reaching doses of 60 mcg of calcitriol daily.

Box 70.2 Abnormal vitamin D metabolism
Although liver disease could in theory lead to deﬁcient 25-hydroxylation
of vitamin D, there is so much functional reserve that this is seldom
a clinical problem. Two cases of rickets due to hereditary defects of
25-hydroxylase have been reported.
The most common cause of failure of 1A-hydroxylase is renal failure.
Congenital absence of this enzyme leads to a condition known as vitamin D–dependent rickets type I. This is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and results in profound rickets with myopathy and enamel
hypoplasia.
Very large doses of calciferol are needed to heal the bone lesions,
which, in contrast, will respond to physiological doses of alfacalcidol or
calcitriol.

VITAMIN D DEFICIENCY

Vitamin D deﬁciency
Causes
• Poor sunlight exposure
• Elderly and housebound
• Asian women who cover their entire bodies with clothing
• Excess sunscreen application
• Pigmented skin
• Poor diet (especially vegetarians)
• Malabsorption
• iCatabolism of vitamin D
• Secondary hyperparathyroidism
•
•
•

Malabsorption
Post-gastrectomy
Enzyme-inducing drugs, e.g., phenytoin

Investigation
Diagnosis of vitamin D deﬁciency is based on the characteristic biochemical abnormalities (b see Table 70.1, p. 398). Frank osteomalacia is usually
associated with very low levels of 25OHD (<5 ng/mL, but this can occur
at <8 ng/ml). The associated secondary hyperparathyroidism often results
in normal or even elevated concentrations of 1,25(OH)2 D.

Treatment
Treatment is best given in the form of vitamin D2 or D3, which will restore
the biochemistry to normal and heal the bony abnormalities. Although
active metabolites of vitamin D will heal the bony abnormalities, they will
not correct underlying biochemical problem and are associated with i
risk of hypercalcemia.
In adults, treatment is given as a daily dose of ergocalciferol/cholecalcifero of 20–25 mcg (800–1000 IU), which is often most easily administered
in combination with a calcium supplement.
An alternative that is particularly helpful if poor compliance is suspected
is to give a single large dose of 3.75–7.5 mg (150,000–300,000 IU). This is
most effectively given as a single oral dose (3–6× 1.25 mg tablets of ergocalciferol/cholecalciferol), which can be supervised in the clinic. This can
be repeated at 2- to 3-month intervals depending on the dose.
It is possible to give a similar dose by IM injection, but the absorption
from this route is variable.
Toxicity is very uncommon and doses of 10,000 IU may be needed for
toxicity or above 200 ng/mL serum 25(OH) D.
Following treatment, there usually is a rapid improvement of myopathy
and symptoms of hypocalcemia.
Bone pain frequently persists longer, and biochemical abnormalities may
not settle for several months. Following the onset of therapy, markers of
bone turnover such as alkaline phosphatase might even show a transient
increase as the osteoid is mineralized and remodeled.
Watch for hypercalcemia once osteomalacia is healed. Calcium concentrations should be monitored and vitamin D dosage reduced if necessary.

Rickets and osteomalacia

X-linked hypophosphatemia
• X-linked dominant genetic disorder
• Severe rickets and osteomalacia
• Mutation of an endopeptidase gene (PHEX)
Clinical features
The abnormal phosphate levels are often detected early in infancy, but
skeletal deformities are not apparent until walking commences.
Typically there is severe rickets, with short stature and bony deformity.
This continues into adult life with bone pain, deformity, and fracture in the
absence of treatment. Proximal myopathy is absent.
Adults suffer from excessive new bone growth affecting particularly
entheses and the longitudinal ligaments of the spinal canal. This can cause
spinal cord compression, which may need surgical decompression.

Oncogenic osteomalacia
Certain tumors may be able to produce FGF23, which is phosphaturic.
This is rare and usually occurs with mesenchymal tumors (such as hemangiopericytomas, hemangiomata, or osteoid tumors) but has also been
reported with a variety of adenocarcinomas (particularly prostatic cancer)
and hematological malignancies (e.g., myeloma and chronic lymphocytic
leukemia).
A similar picture can be seen in some cases of neuroﬁbromatosis.
Clinically, such patients usually present with profound myopathy as well
as bone pain and fracture.
Biochemically, the major abnormality is hypophosphatemia, but this is
usually accompanied by inappropriately low 1,25(OH)2D concentrations.
In some patients, other abnormalities of renal tubular function such as
glycosuria or aminoaciduria are also present.
FGF3 levels are elevated and fall with tumor removal. Tumor may be
localized by PET or CT.
Complete removal of tumor results in resolution of biochemical and
skeletal abnormalities. If this is not possible, or if a causal tumor is not
identiﬁed, treatment with vitamin D metabolites and phosphate supplements (as for X-linked hypophosphatemia) may help skeletal symptoms.

Fanconi syndrome
The Fanconi syndrome is a combination of renal tubular defects that can
result from several different pathologies. In particular, there is renal wasting of phosphate, bicarbonate, glucose, and amino acids.
The combination of hypophosphatemia with renal tubular acidosis
means that osteomalacia is a frequent accompaniment. This can be exacerbated by defective 1A-hydroxylation of vitamin D to its active form.
The osteomalacia is treated by correction of the relevant abnormalities.
This might involve the administration of phosphate, alkali, or 1,25(OH)2D
depending on the precise circumstances.

HYPOPHOSPHATEMIA

Hypophosphatemia
Phosphate is important for normal mineralization of bone. In the absence
of sufﬁcient phosphate, osteomalacia results. Clinically, the osteomalacia is
often indistinguishable from others that are due to other causes, although
there may be features that will help distinguish the underlying cause of
hypophosphatemia.
In addition, phosphate is important in its own right for neuromuscular function, and profound hypophosphatemia can be accompanied by
encephalopathy, muscle weakness, and cardiomyopathy.
Because phosphate is primarily an intracellular anion, a low plasma
phosphate does not necessarily represent actual phosphate depletion.
Several different causes of hypophosphatemia are recognized (b see
Box 70.3).

Treatment
The mainstay is phosphate replacement, usually orally in tablet form.
Ideally, patients should receive 2–3 g of phosphate daily between meals,
but this is not easy to achieve. All phosphate preparations are unpalatable
and act as osmotic purgatives causing diarrhea.

CHAPTER 70

Rickets and osteomalacia

Long-term administration of phosphate supplements stimulates parathyroid activity. This can lead to hypercalcemia, a further fall in phosphate,
with worsening of the bone disease due to development of hyperparathyroid bone disease, which may necessitate parathyroidectomy.
To minimize parathyroid stimulation, it is usual to give one of the active
metabolites of vitamin D in conjunction with phosphate. Typically, alfacalcidol or calcitriol in a dose of 1–3 mcg daily is used.
Patients receiving such supraphysiological doses of vitamin D metabolites are at continued risk of hypercalcemia and require regular monitoring of plasma calcium, preferably at least every 3 months. The adequacy
of calcitriol replacement can be assessed by maintaining 24-hour urinary
calcium excretion at >4–6 mmol/day.
In adults, the role of treatment for X-linked hypophosphatemia is probably conﬁned to symptomatic bone disease. There is little evidence that it
will improve the long-term outcome. There has even been some evidence
that treatment might accelerate new bone formation.
In children, treatment is usually given in the hope of improving ﬁnal
height and minimizing skeletal abnormality. The evidence that it is possible
to achieve these goals is conﬂicting.

INTRODUCTION

Hypomagnesemia

Introduction
Low plasma magnesium levels are common in acutely ill patients. Clinical
manifestations of this are less common.
The most common clinical feature of magnesium deﬁciency is neuromuscular excitability, which is virtually indistinguishable from that associated with hypocalcemia, which frequently coexists. ECG abnormalities
include a prolonged P-R interval and Q-T interval.
The diagnosis is made by measurement of serum magnesium, with normal values being 1.5–1.9 mEq/liter (1.8–2.2 mg/day), but it does not reﬂect
the major source, which is intracellular. However, hypomagnesemia must
be suspected if low calcium is difﬁcult to correct.
In some circumstances, the magnesium tolerance test is performed but
requires a normal renal function. The two major routes of loss are the GI
tract and kidney.
With magnesium deﬁciency, PTH secretion is defective, leading to
the presence or worsening of hypocalcemia, which will not respond to
treatment unless the magnesium deﬁciency is corrected. In magnesium
depletion there is defective trans-membrane electrolyte transport. This
can cause loss of intracellular potassium and of the renal tubule’s ability
to retain potassium.
See Box 71.1 for various causes of hypomagnesemia.
Treatment with potassium supplementation is often unsuccessful unless
magnesium is replaced at the same time.

• Loop diuretics
• Aminoglycosides
• Cisplatin
• Cyclosporin
• Amphotericin
Other causes
• Diabetes
• Metabolic acidosis
• Hypercalcemia
• Phosphate depletion
• Hungry bone syndrome

Treatment
Symptomatic magnesium deﬁciency, especially if associated with hypocalcemia or hypokalemia, requires parenteral treatment. The total deﬁcit
may be of the order of 200–400 mEq. This should be replaced gradually
parenterally.
A dose of 2 g Mg SO4-.7H2O (16.2 mEq Mg) as a 50% solution every
8 hours intramuscularly can be given. However, as these doses are frequently painful, a continuous IV infusion of 48 mEq over 24 hours may
be preferred. This should be continued until the clinical and biochemical
manifestations (hypocalcemia and hypokalemia) are resolved.
In the presence of renal impairment, plasma magnesium can rise quickly,
so particular care must be used if magnesium infusion is contemplated in
this situation.
After repletion has been achieved intravenously, or in less severe cases,
treatment can be continued orally.
Patients who have chronic Mg loss can be given oral supplementation
of 300–600 mg of elemental Mg in divided doses to avoid the purgative
effects. In all of these instances the dose is frequently limited by the purgative properties of magnesium salts.
There is some evidence to suggest that the addition of calcitriol or alfacalcidol might improve magnesium absorption.

INTRODUCTION

Osteoporosis

Introduction
Although the term osteoporosis refers to the reduction in the amount of
bony tissue within the skeleton, this is generally associated with a loss of
structural integrity of the internal architecture of the bone. The combination of both of these changes means that osteoporotic bone is at high risk
of fracture, after even trivial injury.
Although most fractures are related to bone mass to some extent,
the most common osteoporotic fractures are those of the hip and wrist
(Colles) and compression fractures of vertebral bodies. Patients who fracture ribs, the upper humerus, leg, and pelvis also have a higher incidence
of osteoporosis.

405

406

CHAPTER 72

Osteoporosis

Pathology
Osteoporosis may arise from a failure of the body to lay down sufﬁcient
bone during growth and maturation; an earlier-than-usual onset of bone
loss following maturity; or an i rate of that loss. In females, the loss of
estrogen at the menopause is the major etiological factor.

Peak bone mass
This is mainly genetically determined:
• Racial effects (bone mass higher in Afro-Caribbean, lower in
Caucasians)
• Family inﬂuence on the risk of osteoporosis—may account for 60–70%
of variation
It is also inﬂuenced by environmental factors:
• Exercise—particularly weight-bearing
• Nutrition—especially calcium
Exposure to estrogen is also important. Early menopause or late puberty
(in males or females) is associated with i risk of osteoporosis.

Early onset of loss
• Early menopause
• Conditions leading to bone loss, e.g., glucocorticoid therapy

Increased net loss
• Aging
• Vitamin D insufﬁciency
• Declining bone formation
• Declining renal function
• Underlying disease states (b see Box 72.1)

Lifestyle factors affecting bone mass
Increase
• Weight-bearing exercise
Decrease
• Smoking
• Excessive alcohol
• Nulliparity
• Poor calcium nutrition

PATHOLOGY

Epidemiology
The risk of osteoporotic fracture increases with age. Fracture rates in
men are approximately one-half those seen in women of the same age.
A woman aged 50 has approximately a 1/2 chance of sustaining an osteoporotic fracture during the rest of her life. The corresponding ﬁgure for
men is 1/5, although this is increasing.
In the United States, 10 million Americans older than 50 years of age
have osteoporosis. There are 1.5 million fractures each year, and another
34 million are at risk for the disease.
There are approximately 500,000 hip fractures per year. These are a
particular health challenge as they invariably result in hospital admission.
One-ﬁfth of hip fracture victims will die within 6 months of the injury and
only 50% will return to their previous level of independence.
It has been estimated that the overall cost of osteoporotic fractures in
the United States is $22 billion annually.

PRESENTATION

Presentation
Osteoporosis is usually clinically silent until the onset of fracture. Twothirds of vertebral fractures do not come to clinical attention.
Typical vertebral fracture has the following features:
• Sudden episode of well-localized pain
• May or may not have been related to injury or exertion
• May be radiation of the pain in a girdle distribution
• Pain may initially require bed rest but gradually subsides over the
following 4–8 weeks. Even after this time there may be residual pain at
the fracture site.
• Osteoporotic vertebral fractures only rarely lead to neurological
impairment.
Any evidence of spinal cord compression should prompt a search for
malignancy or other underlying cause.
Following vertebral fracture, a patient may be left with persistent back
pain, kyphosis, or height loss.
Although height loss and kyphosis are often thought to be indicative of
osteoporosis, they are more frequently the result of degenerative disease.
They cannot be the result of osteoporosis in the absence of vertebral
fracture.
Peripheral fractures are also more common in osteoporosis.
If a bone breaks from a fall from less than standing height, this represents a low-trauma fracture that might indicate underlying osteoporosis.
Osteoporosis does not cause generalized skeletal pain.

409

410

CHAPTER 72

Osteoporosis

Investigation
Establish the diagnosis
Plain radiographs are useful for determining the presence of fracture.
Apart from this, they are of little utility in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.
Bone densitometry
In order to identify the presence of osteoporosis, it is important to actually measure the bone mineral density (BMD). This is usually carried out
at the hip and/or lumbar spine with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
(DXA).
The presence of degenerative disease or arterial calciﬁcation can elevate the apparent bone density of the spine without adding to skeletal
strength. Increased reliance is thus being placed on measurements derived
from the hip.
The schema for diagnosis of osteoporosis that was proposed by the
WHO has been accepted for general use (b see Table 72.1).
Biochemical markers
Biochemical markers of bone turnover may be helpful in the calculation
of fracture risk and in judging the response to antiresorptive therapy, but
they have no role in the diagnosis of osteoporosis.

Exclude underlying causes
An underlying cause for osteoporosis is present in approximately 1/3 of
women and over 1/2 of men with osteoporosis. Many of the underlying
causes (b see Box 72.1, pp. 407–408) should be apparent from a careful
history and physical examination.
A few basic investigations are useful to exclude the more common
underlying causes. Other investigations may be needed to exclude other
speciﬁc conditions (see Box 72.2).
It is most helpful to target these investigations at those people who have
a lower-than-expected bone mass for their age (Z score < –2).

Monitoring therapy
Repeat bone densitometry is advocated by most, depending on cost
and availability. A time interval of 18 months to 2 years is recommended
between scans. However, in certain conditions, e.g., glucocorticoid and

Useful in most patients

• Renal function
• Liver function
• Calcium
• Thyroid function
• Testosterone and LH (only in men)
• Vitamin D level
Useful in speciﬁc instances
• Estradiol and FSH (in women whose menopausal status is not clear)
• Serum and urine electrophoresis (if raised ESR or plasma globulin is
elevated)
• Anti-endomysial antibodies (if any suggestion of celiac disease)
• Other investigations for speciﬁc diseases
• Bone turnover markers to assess drug efﬁcacy or compliance and
response to treatment
Low-trauma fractures associated with osteoporosis
Any fracture other than those affecting the ﬁngers, toes, or face that is
caused by less trauma than a fall from standing height is potentially the
result of osteoporosis. Patients suffering this kind of fracture should be
considered for investigation and/or treatment for osteoporosis.

post-transplantation bone disease, more frequent measurements may be
advocated.
Effective treatment leads to increases of 5–8% at the spine. Bone densitometry may be replaced by biochemical markers as assays improve (e.g.,
P1NP).

Medical management of osteoporosis
Fracture risk assessment and treatment guidelines are essential to management of osteoporosis. One of the tools is FRAX which was developed
by the WHO, in collaboration with a number of centers worldwide, l to
evaluate an individual’s risk of fracture during the ensuing 10 years.
The population-based data incorporate clinical risk factors such as age,
low BMI, smoking, oral glucocorticoid use, previous fractures, parental
history of fractures, alcohol intake, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary causes
of osteoporosis, and femoral neck BMD. On the basis of these risk factors,
which are weighted, a score is calculated that determines an individual’s
10-year probability of fracture. FRAX can be viewed online.
The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF), with consideration of
FRAX, has recently revised its guidelines (see Fig. 72.1).

Osteoporosis Foundation.
It is recommended that treatment be considered in postmenopausal
women or men older than 50 years if they have low bone mass (T score
between –1.0 and –2.5) and a 10-year probability of hip fracture 3% or a
10-year probability of major osteoporotic-related fracture 20%, based on
FRAX calculations. These thresholds were determined with heavy emphasis on cost-effectiveness.
These guidelines are not intended to replace clinician judgment and
patient preference.

TREATMENT

Treatment
Treatments should, whenever possible, be judged by their effect on fracture reduction. Although some treatments are speciﬁc to certain clinical
situations, there are also general measures that apply to all patients with
osteoporosis.
In addition to treatments aimed at improving bone mass, it must be
remembered that fractures can be prevented in other ways. Thus it is
prudent to try and minimize the risk of falling by adjusting the home environment and reviewing the need for medications such as hypnotics and
antihypertensives, antidepressants, proton pump inhibitors, etc.
There is conﬂicting evidence on the use of wearing hip-protecting pads.
These can only be recommended in an institutional setting where compliance can be assured.

Lifestyle measures
• Smoking cessation
• Moderate alcohol consumption. (2 glasses per day)
• Encourage weight-bearing exercise:
• Impact exercise such as skipping or jumping increases bone mass.
• Lower-impact exercise, e.g., walking outdoors for 20 minutes
3 × × week may reduce fracture risk.
• Encourage a well-balanced diet.
• Ensure adequate calcium and vitamin D intake: 1000–1200 mg
elemental calcium and at least 800 IU vitamin D daily.

Choice of therapy
N-containing bisphosphonates
Either oral or IV agents are the ﬁrst line of treatment, as they are relatively
cheap and are effective in reducing fractures rates by approximately 50%
at the spine and hip. They also have a very long history of patient exposure
to the drug in clinical practice. Patients who cannot take these drugs orally
may beneﬁt from IV preparations.
HRT
The use of estrogen or combined estrogen progesterone preparations has
fallen off as a result of the ﬁndings of the Women’s Health Initiative studies (WHI). The data showed an increased risk of breast cancer and stroke
that outweighed the beneﬁts of reduction in hip fracture.
The results are still considered controversial and it is recommended
that estrogen be given for the shortest possible time and in the smallest
effective dose to control postmenopausal symptoms, e.g., hot ﬂashes, and
other therapies, e.g., bisphosphonates, be given as ﬁrst line for osteoporosis management.
Other agents
Raloxifene is recommended in females who have mainly spinal osteoporosis and who are at risk or have a history of breast cancer. It is not effective
in reducing nonvertebral fractures, including hip.

However, it may be useful in patients in whom bisphosphonates are
contraindicated or who are intolerant of the medication.
Calcitonin given as a nasal spray is not a very effective anti-osteoporotic
therapy but may reduce spinal fractures in selected patients.
Strontium ranelate, although used elsewhere, is not approved in the
United States. Calcitriol is also not approved for therapy of osteoporosis
in the United States.
Denosumab (Prolia) is a RANK ligand inhibitor indicated for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. In a 3-year randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 7808
women aged 60–91 years, denosumab decreased new vertebral fractures
by a relative risk reduction of 68%, hip fractures by 40%, and nonvertebral
fractures by 20%. All fracture reductions were signiﬁcant.

TREATMENT

It must be administered by a health care professional. The dosage is 60
mg every 6 months as an SC injection in the upper arm, upper thigh, and
abdomen. Patients should also take 1000 mg calcium and at least 400 IU
vitamin D daily.
Physicians should check serum calcium, as it must not be administered in
the presence of hypoclacemia. Adverse events include skin infections and
osteonecrosis of the jaw. As with other antiosteoporotic drugs, it should
not be given to pregnant or lactating women.
Teriparatide is reserved for use in postmenopausal females with severe
osteoporosis at high risk of fracture (previous fractures, multiple risk factors, failure or intolerance of previous therapy).

Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis
Glucocorticoid treatment is one of the major secondary causes of osteoporosis (Boxes 72.3, 72.4). Not all patients receiving steroid treatment
lose bone, and it is not clear what determines this.
There is some suggestion that patients on corticosteroids may have
bones that are more fragile than would be suggested by the BMD. It is
often suggested that such patients be treated at a higher bone density than
would be case for other causes of osteoporosis (Box 72.5).

Box 72.3 Most common form of secondary osteoporosis
• Use in general population between 0.5 and 1.7 % in postmenopausal

• Decrease dose of glucocorticoids as rapidly as possible
• Replace sex hormones if hypogonadal
• Calcium and vitamin D
• Bisphosphonates
• Human PTH with or without HRT

COMPLICATIONS OF THERAPY

Complications of therapy
HRT
Because of adverse effects (breast cancer, venous thromboembolism,
coronary disease, and stroke), HRT is no longer recommended as primary
treatment for osteoporosis in normal postmenopausal women.
When a woman is receiving HRT for climacteric symptoms it will provide protection to her skeleton for the duration of treatment. Skeletal
protection is rapidly lost on cessation of HRT.
In women with a premature menopause, HRT remains the most appropriate means of preventing bone loss in the absence of other contraindications (e.g., breast cancer) (see Box 72.6).
Women who are unable to take conventional HRT might be able to
take progestogens alone (e.g., norethisterone 5 mg daily); several of these
agents have been shown to have bone-sparing properties.

Box 72.6 Special considerations in premenopausal women
• Osteoporosis in premenopausal women is rare but well recognized.
The Z score should be used.
• It is important to exclude underlying causes of bone loss.
• Osteoporosis can very rarely occur in conjunction with pregnancy
or lactation. This is frequently self-limiting and usually requires little
treatment other than calcium supplementation.
• In the absence of a pre-existing fracture and continued menses,
fracture risk is low. Frequently, all that is needed is calcium and
vitamin D supplementation and lifestyle advice until the menopause,
when more active therapy is needed to counteract menopausal bone
loss.
• In other situations, particularly when fractures are present, most
of the therapies that are used in postmenopausal women, with the
exception of HRT, can be used (although not approved).
• Some caution needs to be exercised with the use of bisphosphonates
in younger people:
• Teratogenic in animals
• Long skeletal retention time, making their long-term use cautious
An alternative strategy is to give no treatment unless there is an
osteoporotic fracture if the BMD is stable over 2–4 years.

Side effects are less marked following nasal administration. When given in
doses of 50–100 units IM or 200 units nasally daily, it has analgesic properties and can be used in the management of acute fracture pain.

Raloxifene
• Similar increase in risk of venous thrombosis as HRT
• May induce or worsen climacteric symptoms
• Reduces risk of breast cancer

Strontium ranelate (not approved in the U.S.)
• Diarrhea
• Venous thromboembolism
• Strontium is incorporated into bone making bone densitometry

• It may affect measurement of calcium in plasma.

Teriparatide
• Contraindcations include hypercalcemia, renal impairment unexplained
elevation of alkaline phosphatase, Paget’s disease, prior irradiation.
• Risk of hypercalcemia is not great and no speciﬁc monitoring of
treatment is needed.
• Vomiting
• Leg cramps
• i Risk of osteosarcoma seen in rats given teriparatide for most of
their life. Black box warning in package insert. It should be avoided in
patients with i risk of bone tumors (Paget’s disease, raised alkaline
phosphatase, previous skeletal radiotherapy).

Male osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is less common in men for the following reasons:
• Greater accumulation of bone mass during growth
• Greater bone size and strength
• Absence of a distinct equivalent of menopause
• Shorter life expectancy
• Lesser propensity to fall

COMPLICATIONS OF THERAPY

Box 72.7 Special considerations in men
• Secondary causes of osteoporosis are more common in men and
need to be excluded in all men with osteoporotic fracture.
• Bisphosphonates beneﬁt bone mass in men in a similar way to
postmenopausal women.
• Hypogonadal men show an improvement in bone mass on
testosterone replacement. This can be used as primary treatment
in hypogonadal men. However, hypogonadal men respond to
bisphosphonates the same as those with normal testosterone levels.
• Parathyroid hormone SC injections have also been shown to be
beneﬁcial in improving BMD.

Box 72.8 BMD testing in males: recommendations
• Men over the age of 50 who have suffered a fracture or with a
vertebral deformity
• Men with secondary causes of osteoporosis, e.g., glucocorticoids
• Screening BMD measures recommended for men over 70 years—
cost-effectiveness?
• Ideally, male reference range to grade risk is desirable.

Causes of increased bone mineral density
Artifacts
• Excess skeletal calcium (lumbar spondylosis, ankylosing spondylitis)
• Extra skeletal calcium (vascular, gallstones)
• Vertebral fracture
• Radiodense material (surgical implants, strontium)
Focal increase in bone
• Paget’s disease
• Tumors (e.g., hemangioma, Hodgkins, plasmacytoma)
Generalized increase in bone
• Acquired osteosclerosis (general osteodystrophy, ﬂuorosis,
mastocytosis, hepatitis C, myeloﬁbrosis, acromegaly)
Genetic sclerosing bone dysplasias
• d Absorption (e.g., osteopetrosis)
• i Formation (e.g., sclerosteosis)
• Disturbed balance of formation and resorption

PATHOLOGY

Paget’s disease
Paget’s disease is the result of greatly i local bone turnover, which occurs
particularly in the middle-aged or elderly.

Pathology
The primary abnormality in Paget’s disease is gross overactivity of the
osteoclasts, resulting in greatly i bone resorption. This secondarily results
in i osteoblastic activity. The new bone is laid down in a highly disorganized manner and leads to the characteristic pagetic abnormality, with
irregular packets of woven bone being apparent on biopsy and disorganized internal architecture of the bone on plain radiographs.
Paget’s disease can affect any bone in the skeleton but is most frequently found in the pelvis, vertebral column, femur, skull, and tibia. In
most patients it affects several sites, but in about 20% of cases a single
bone is affected (monostotic disease).
Typically, the disease will start in one end of a long bone and spread
along the bone at a rate of about 1 cm per year. Although it can spread
within an affected bone, it appears that the pattern of disease is ﬁxed by
the time of clinical presentation, and it is exceedingly rare for new bones
to become involved during the course of the disease.
Paget’s disease alters the mechanical properties of the bone. Thus,
pagetic bones are more likely to bend under normal physiological loads
and liable to fracture.
This can take the form of complete fractures, which tend to be transverse, rather than the more common spiral fractures of long bones. More
frequently, ﬁssure or incremental fractures are seen on the convex surface
of bowed pagetic bones. These may be painful in their own right but are
also liable to proceed to complete fracture.
Pagetic bones are also larger than their normal counterparts. This can
lead to i arthritis at adjacent joints and to pressure on nerves, producing
neurological compression syndromes and, when it occurs in the skull base,
sensorineural deafness.

Etiology of Paget’s disease
The etiology is unclear. There are two major theories.
Familial
• Some genetic associations, especially with sequestomma at 18q.
• These are not invariable.
Viral
• Inclusion bodies similar to those seen in viral infections are present in
pagetic osteoclasts.

421

422

CHAPTER 73

Paget’s disease

• Some investigators have found paramyxoviral (measles or canine
distemper) protein or nucleic acid in pagetic bone.
• Others are not able to replicate this.

Epidemiology
Paget’s disease is present in about 2% of the UK population over the age
of 55. Its prevalence increases with age and it is more common in men
than women. Only about 10% of affected patients will have symptomatic
disease.
It is most common in the UK or in migrants of British descent in North
America and Australasia, but is rare in Africa. Recent studies in the UK
and New Zealand have suggested that the prevalence may be declining
with time.

Clinical features
• 90% asymptomatic
• The most notable feature is pain. This is frequently multifactorial:
• i Metabolic activity of the bone
• Changes in bone shape
• Fissure fractures
• Nerve compression
• Arthritis
• Pagetic bones tend to increase in size or to become bowed (16%
cases): bowing can be so severe as to interfere with function.
• Fractures (either complete or ﬁssure) are present in 10%.

INVESTIGATION

Investigation
The diagnosis of Paget’s disease is primarily radiological (Box 73.1)

Box 73.1 Radiological features of Paget’s disease
Early disease—primarily lytic
• V-shaped ‘cutting cone ’ in long bones
• Osteoporosis circumscripta in skull
Combined phase (mixed lytic and sclerotic)
• Cortical thickening
• Loss of corticomedullary distinction
• Accentuated trabecular markings
Late phase—primarily sclerotic
• Thickening of long bones
• Increase in bone size
• Sclerosis
An isotope bone scan is frequently helpful in assessing the extent of
skeletal involvement with Paget’s disease. It is particularly important to
identify Paget’s disease in a weight-bearing bone because of the risk of
fracture. The uptake of tracer depends on the disease activity, and isotope bone scans can also be used to assess the response to therapy.
In active disease, plasma alkaline phosphatase activity is usually (85%)
elevated. An exception to this is in monostotic disease, when there may
be insufﬁcient bone involved to raise the enzyme levels above normal.
Alkaline phosphatase activity responds to successful treatment. There
is little advantage in using the more modern markers of bone turnover
over the total alkaline phosphatase activity for the monitoring of pagetic
activity. A possible exception to this is in patients with liver disease,
where changes in bone alkaline phosphatase might be masked by the
liver isoenzyme.

Paget’s disease

Complications
Deafness is present in up to 1/2 of cases of skull base Paget’s. Other neurological complications are rare. These can include the following:
• Compression of other cranial nerves with skull base disease
• Spinal cord compression is most common with involvement of the
thoracic spine and is thought to result as much from a vascular steal
syndrome as from physical compression. It frequently responds to
medical therapy without need for surgical decompression.
• Platybasia, which can lead to an obstructive hydrocephalus that may
require surgical drainage
Osteogenic sarcoma:
• Very rare complication of Paget’s disease
• Rarely amenable to treatment
• Presents with i pain and radiological evidence of tumor, and a mass
Any increase of pain in a patient with Paget’s disease should arouse suspicion of sarcomatous degeneration. A more common cause, however, is
resumption of activity of disease.
Pagetic sarcomas are most frequently found in the humerus or femur
but can affect any bone involved with Paget’s disease.

TREATMENT

Treatment
Treatment with agents that decrease bone turnover reduces disease activity as indicated by bone turnover markers and isotope bone scans. There
is evidence to suggest that such treatment leads to the deposition of histologically normal bone.
Although such treatment has been shown to help pain, there is little
evidence that it beneﬁts the other consequences of Paget’s disease. In particular, the deafness of Paget’s disease does not regress after treatment,
although its progression may be halted.
Nonetheless, it has become generally accepted to treat patients in the
hope that future complications of the disease will be avoided. Typical indications for treatment of Paget’s disease are listed in Box 73.2.
The bisphosphonates have become the mainstay of treatment (Table 73.1).
Calcitonin and plicamycin are no longer used.
Patients should also be fully replete in both calcium and vitamin D
before and during treatment.

Goals of treatment
• Normalize bone turnover
• Alkaline phosphatase in normal range
• The more aggressive the initial therapy, the longer the disease
remission.
• Minimize symptoms
• Prevent long-term complications
• No actual evidence that treatment achieves this

OSTEOGENESIS IMPERFECTA

Inherited disorders of bone

Osteogenesis imperfecta
Osteogenesis imperfecta is an inherited form of osteoporosis in which
there is a genetic defect in one of the two genes (COLIA1 and COLIA2)
encoding the A-chain of collagen type I collagen production.
Several different mutations are recognized, and these produce different clinical pictures. These are generally separated into four and, more
recently, seven different types (b see Table 74.1).
In addition to the osteoporosis and easy-fracture predisposition, there
may also be abnormalities of the teeth (dentigenesis imperfecta), blue
sclerae, hearing loss, hypermobility, and cardiac valvular lesions.
Radiological features include the following:
• Generalized osteopenia
• Multiple fractures with deformity
• Abnormal shape of long bones
• Wormian bones in skull

Diagnosis
• Features (as above) and family history
• Analysis of collagen type I genes (detect 90%)
• Differential diagnosis includes Brock syndrome, panostotic
ﬁbrous dysplasia, hyper- and hypophatasia, and idiopathic juvenile
osteoporosis.
There are three criteria:
• Three fragility fractures aged <20 years
• At least one of the following: blue sclerae, scoliosis, hearing loss, joint
laxity, dentinogenesis imperfecta, and affected family member
• Osteoporosis
Recent studies have demonstrated that infusions of pamidronate lead to
i bone mass and reduced fracture incidence in affected children. Patients
with milder disease might only be recognized in adulthood. It appears that
oral bisphosphonates may be helpful in their disease management.
Prenatal diagnosis of severe types is possible from US, and genetic counseling should be offered to at-risk families.

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Growth and stature
Growth
Regulation of growth
Normal human growth can be divided into three overlapping stages (the
Karlberg model), each under the control of different factors.
Infancy
Growth is largely under nutritional regulation, and wide interindividual variation in rates of growth is seen. Many infants show signiﬁcant “catch-up”
or “catch-down” in weight and length, and by 2 years, length is much more
predictive of ﬁnal adult height than at birth.
Childhood
Growth is regulated by growth hormone (GH) and thyroxine. It is characterized by alternating periods of mini-growth spurts with intervening
stasis, each phase lasting several weeks. However, over years, a child will
tend to maintain their centile position on height charts with a height velocity between the 25th and 75th centiles.
Puberty
The combination of GH and sex hormones promotes bone maturation and
a rapid growth acceleration, or growth spurt. In both sexes estrogen eventually causes epiphyseal fusion, resulting in the attainment of ﬁnal height.

Sex differences
Adult heights differ between men and women by on average 13 cm. During
childhood, onset of the pubertal growth spurt is earlier in girls, who are
thus on average taller than boys between the ages of 10–13 years.

Tempo
Within each sex there may also be marked interindividual differences in
tempo of growth (or rate of attainment of ﬁnal height) and the timing of
puberty. Delay or advance of bone maturation is linked with timing of
puberty. Constitutional delay in growth and puberty often runs in families,
reﬂecting probable genetic factors.
Comparison of bone age (estimated from a hand and wrist radiograph)
with chronological age is thus an important part of growth assessment.

Final height
Final height is estimated as the height reached when growth velocity slows
to <2 cm/year and can be conﬁrmed by ﬁnding epiphyseal fusion on hand
or wrist radiograph ± knee radiograph.
Final height is largely genetically determined, and a target height can be
estimated in each individual from their parent’s heights.

GROWTH

Assessment of growth
Measurement
From birth to 2 years old, supine length is measured ideally using a measuring board (e.g., Harpenden neonatometer). Two adults are needed to
ensure that the child is lying straight with legs extended.
From 2 years old, standing height is measured against a wall-mounted or
free-standing stadiometer with the measurer applying moderate upward
neck traction and the child looking forward in the horizontal plane.
To minimize error in the calculation of height velocity (cm/year), height
measurements should be taken at least 6 months apart using the same
equipment and by the same person.
Measurement of sitting height and comparison with leg length (standing
height – sitting height) allows an estimate of body proportion.
Growth charts (Figs. 75.1 and 75.2)
Height and weight velocity should be compared to age- and sex-appropriate reference data by plotting values on standard growth charts (e.g., US
2000 CDC Growth Charts: http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts/).

Mid-parental height (MPH)
MPH is an estimate of the child’s genetic height potential and is calculated as
[(mother’s height + father’s height)/2] + 7 cm (for boys) or – 7 cm
(for girls).
It can be used to estimate a child’s expected ﬁnal height, but there is a
wide target range (MPH ± 10 cm for boys and ± 8.5 cm for girls), and it is
more commonly used to assess whether the child’s current height centile
is consistent with genetic expectation.
Bone age
Skeletal maturation proceeds in an orderly manner from the ﬁrst appearance of each epiphyseal center to the fusion of the long bones. From
chronological age 3–4 years, bone age may be quantiﬁed from radiographs
of the left hand and wrist by comparison with standard photographs (e.g.,

GROWTH

Greulich and Pyle method) or by an individual bone scoring system (e.g.,
Tanner–Whitehouse method).
The difference between bone age and chronological age is an estimation
of tempo of growth. The initiation of puberty usually coincides with a bone
age around 10.5–11 years in girls and 11–11.5 years in boys, although the
correlation between bone age and pubertal timing is approximate.
Girls reach skeletal maturity at a bone age of 15 years and boys when
bone age is 17 years. Thus, bone age allows an estimation of remaining
growth potential and can be used to aid in the prediction of ﬁnal adult
height.
Final height prediction
Predictions of ﬁnal height can be derived from information on current
height, age, pubertal status, and bone age using calculations described by
Tanner and Whitehouse, or Bailey and Pinneau, among others (b see
Further reading, p. 446, De Waal et al., 1996).

Secular trends
Population growth references used should be appropriate to the population studied and may occasionally need to be updated.

433

434

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Short stature
Deﬁnition
Short stature is deﬁned as height at least 2 standard deviations (SD) below
the mean for age and sex or at least 2 SD below the predicted MPH.
However, abnormalities of growth may be present long before attained
height falls below this level and may be detected much earlier by assessing
growth velocity and observing height measurements

Assessment
History
• Who is concerned, the child or parents?
• What are the parental heights?
• Has the child always been small, or does the history suggest recent
growth failure? Try to obtain previous measurements (e.g., from
parents, primary care physician, school).
Ask about maternal illness in pregnancy, drug intake and possible substance abuse in pregnancy, gestation at delivery, size at birth (weight,
length, and head circumference), childhood illnesses, medication, and
developmental milestones.
• Conduct a systematic inquiry regarding headaches, visual disturbance,
asthma and respiratory symptoms, abdominal symptoms, and diet.
• Is there a family history of short stature or pubertal delay?
• What are the psychosocial circumstances of the child and the family?
Examination
• Assess height and height velocity over at least 6 months.
• Measure sitting height and derive subischial leg length (standing height –
sitting height [cm] if skeletal disproportion suspected).
• Assess for the presence and severity of chronic disease. Low weightfor-height suggests a nutritional diagnosis, GI cause, or other signiﬁcant
systemic disease.
• Pubertal stage using Tanner’s criteria
• Observe for dysmorphic features and signs of endocrinopathy, and
presence and severity of chronic disease.
• Measure parents’ heights and calculate MPH.

Investigations
Laboratory tests should include CBC, ESR, electrolytes, thyroid function, calcium, phosphate, tissue transglutaminase antibodies, IGF-1
and IGF BP-3 levels, karyotype (of particular importance in girls), and
urinalysis.
The following tests may also be clinically indicated: GH provocation
testing (e.g., arginine, clonidine, or glucagon) (see Table 75.1) with other
anterior pituitary function tests, MRI scan with speciﬁc reference to the
hypothalamus and pituitary, skeletal survey (for bone dysplasia), and, very
rarely, an IGF-1 generation test (b for GH resistance, see Growth hormone deﬁciency, p. 437).

Causes
• Genetic short stature
• Constitutional delay in growth and puberty
• These ﬁrst two together account for ~40% of cases.
• Chronic illness (including untreated celiac disease, congenital heart
disease, chronic renal failure, inﬂammatory bowel disease)
• Psychosocial deprivation (which may be associated with reversible GH
deﬁciency)
• Small for gestational age (SGA), including intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) (7.5%).
• Dysmorphic syndromes (e.g., Turner’s, Noonan, or Down syndrome)
• Malnutrition
GH deﬁciency (8%)
• Undeﬁned etiology (idiopathic, including those with abnormal pituitary
morphology on MRI)
• Congenital malformation in the hypothalamus and pituitary
(HP) (e.g., septo-optic dysplasia) or acquired HP disorders (e.g.,
craniopharyngioma, trauma), the GH-1 gene or GH-releasing hormone
receptor gene, or rarely, mutations in transcription factors controlling
pituitary development
• GH resistance (rare genetic mutations in the GH receptor or GH
signaling molecules)
• Endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, Cushing’s
syndrome)
Other
• Skeletal dysplasia (e.g., achondroplasia, hypochondroplasia)
• Metabolic bone disease (e.g., nutritional or hypophosphatemic rickets)

435

436

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Genetic short stature
Although stature does not follow strict Mendelian laws of inheritance, it
does relate to parental height and is probably a polygenic trait. It should
be remembered that short parents may themselves have an unidentiﬁed
dominantly inherited condition (e.g., hypochondroplasia).

Constitutional delay of growth
and puberty
Clinical features
This condition often presents in adolescence but may also be recognized
in earlier childhood and is more prevalent in boys.
Characteristic features include short stature and delay in pubertal development by >2 SD and/or bone age delay in an otherwise healthy child. In
the adolescent years, short sitting height percentile compared to that of
leg length is typical. There is often a family history of delayed puberty.
Bone age delay may also develop in a number of other conditions, but
in constitutional delay, bone age delay usually remains consistent over
time, and height velocity is normal for the bone age. Final height may not
reach target height.
GH secretion is usually normal, although provocation tests should be
primed by prior administration of exogenous sex hormones if bone age
is >10 years.

Management
Often only reassurance is necessary. Treatment is sometimes indicated
in adolescent boys who have difﬁculty coping with their short stature or
delayed sexual maturation.
• For the older boy (>14 years) with concerns about puberty:
testosterone (50–100 mg IM, monthly for 3–6 months)
• For the older girl (>13 years) with concerns about puberty: estradiol
(0.5 mcg qod for 3–6 months) or Premarin 0.3 mg qod.

GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY

Growth hormone deﬁciency
Primary GH deﬁciency
Primary GH deﬁciency is usually sporadic, but rarely it may be inherited as
autosomal dominant, recessive, or X-linked recessive and may be associated with other pituitary hormone deﬁciencies. It may represent a defect
in homeobox genes (e.g., Pit1 [leading to GH, TSH, and PRL deﬁciency],
Prop1 [leading to GH, TSH, PRL, gonadotropin, and later ACTH deﬁciencies], or Hesx1) that control HP development.
Mutation in Hesx1 has been associated with midline defects, such as
optic nerve hypoplasia and corpus callosum defects (i.e., septo-optic dysplasia). GH deﬁciency usually arises because of failure of release of GHRH
from the hypothalamus.
Clinical features
Infancy
GH deﬁciency may present with hypoglycemia. Coexisting ACTH, TSH,
and gonadotropin deﬁciencies may cause prolonged hyperbilirubinemia
and micropenis. Size may be normal, as fetal and infancy growth are more
dependent on nutrition and other growth factors than on GH.
Childhood
Typical features include slow growth velocity, short stature, d muscle
mass, and i SC fat. Underdevelopment of the mid-facial bones, relative
protrusion of the frontal bones because of mid-facial hypoplasia, delayed
dental eruption, and delayed closure of the anterior fontanelle may be
seen. These children have delayed bone age and delayed puberty.

Secondary GH deﬁciency
Brain tumors and cranial irradiation
Pituitary or hypothalamic tumors may impair GH secretion, and deﬁciencies of other pituitary hormones may coexist. Cranial irradiation, used to
treat intracranial tumors, facial tumors, and acute leukemia, may also cause
GH deﬁciency.
Risk of HP damage is related to total dose administered, fractionation
(single dose more toxic than divided), location of the irradiated tissue, and
age (younger children are more sensitive to radiation damage).
GH secretion is most sensitive to radiation damage, followed by
gonadotropins, TSH, and ACTH. Central precocious puberty may also
occur and may mask GH deﬁciency by promoting growth but will compromise ﬁnal height if untreated. At-risk children should therefore be
screened regularly by careful examination and multiple pituitary hormone testing.
These survivors of childhood cancer may also have other endocrine
problems, including gonadal damage related to concomitant chemotherapy or radiation scatter, hypothyroidism related to spinal radiation, or
glucose intolerance related to total body irradiation. It is recommended
that all such patients undergo endocrine surveillance.

437

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Psychosocial deprivation
Severe psychosocial deprivation may cause reversible disturbance of GH
secretion and growth failure. GH secretion improves within 3 weeks of
hospitalization or removal from the adverse environment and catch-up
growth is often dramatic (see Fig. 75.3), although these children may continue to exhibit other features of emotional disturbance.

Treatment of GH deﬁciency (Fig. 75.4)
Recombinant human GH has been available since 1985 and is administered
by daily SC injection.
Dose
The replacement dose for childhood GH deﬁciency is 0.3 mg/kg per week,
divided into 7 days/week. Catch-up growth is optimized if GH is commenced early. A higher dose can be used in puberty, reﬂecting the normal
elevation in GH levels at Tanner stage 3–4.

Side effects
Local lipoatrophy and benign intracranial hypertension occur rarely.
Slipped upper femoral epiphyses are associated with GH deﬁciency, but
the incidence is similar before or after GH treatment.
Other pituitary hormone deﬁciencies may be unmasked by GH therapy,
and thyroid function should be checked within 4–6 weeks of commencing
therapy.
Retesting in adulthood
Once ﬁnal height is achieved, GH secretion should be retested, as a signiﬁcant percentage of subjects (25–80%) with GH deﬁciency in childhood
subsequently have normal GH secretion in adulthood.
In those with conﬁrmed GH deﬁciency, continuation of GH treatment
(at a dose of 3–6 mcg/kg/day) through the late adolescent years into early

439

440

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

adulthood (the transition phase) is recommended in order to complete
somatic development (increasing lean body mass and muscular strength,
reducing fat mass, improving bone density, and maintaining a healthy lipid
proﬁle). GH treatment may need to be continued beyond this phase, as
adult GH replacement.
The transition from pediatric to adult care is an important time to not
only re-evaluate GH status but also reassess other pituitary function and
management of any underlying disorder.
It is also recommended that assessment of bone mineral density, body
composition, fasting lipid proﬁle, and QoL by questionnaire be undertaken at this time and repeated at 3- to 5-year intervals for those restarting GH treatment.

GH resistance
GH resistance may arise from primary GH receptor defects or post-receptor defects secondary to malnutrition, liver disease, type 1 diabetes,
or, very rarely, circulating GH antibodies.
Laron syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive condition caused by a
genetic defect of the GH receptor. Affected individuals have extreme
short stature, high levels of GH, low levels of IGF-1, and impaired
GH-induced IGF-1 generation (b see Box 75.1, p. 440). Treatment with
recombinant IGF-1 is available.

Hypothyroidism (Fig. 75.5)
Congenital primary hypothyroidism is detected by neonatal screening.
Hypothyroidism presenting in childhood is usually autoimmune in origin.
Incidence is higher in girls and those with personal or family history of
other autoimmune disease.

Box 75.1 GH assessment
GH is normally secreted overnight in regular pulses (pulse frequency 180
minutes). Frequently sampled overnight GH proﬁles are costly and laborious, thus standardized stimulation tests are more commonly useful.
There can be large variation between different GH assay methods and
exact cut-offs must be locally validated.
A number of different agents may be used to stimulate GH secretion
(arginine, clonidine, glucagon, or insulin; see Table 75.1, p. 435). All tests
should be performed in the morning following an overnight fast, and
serial blood samples are collected over 90–180 minutes.
An IGF-1 and IGF BP-3 level should also be measured in the baseline
sample, as an additional marker of GH status.
IGF-1 generation test
In those with high basal and stimulated GH levels and low IGF-1 levels,
measurement of IGF-1 levels before and following administration of GH
0.1 IU/kg (30 mcg/kg/day) daily SC for 4 days allows an assessment of
GH sensitivity and resistance. This test is rarely necessary.

In childhood, hypothyroidism may present with growth failure alone,
and bone age is often disproportionately delayed. Very rarely, early
puberty may occur.
Investigations show low T4 and T3, high TSH, positive anti-thyroglobulin,
and antithyroid peroxidase (microsomal) antibodies.
Replacement therapy with oral levothyroxine (100 mcg/m2 per day titrated
with thyroid function) results in catch-up growth unless diagnosis is late.

Celiac disease
This is more common in children with other autoimmune disorders.
Although the classical childhood presentation is an irritable toddler with
poor weight gain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and distension, in later childhood poor growth with bone age delay may be the presenting feature.
Measurement of tissue transglutaminase is a valuable screening test, but
diagnosis needs to be conﬁrmed by small-bowel biopsy. Catch-up growth
usually follows commencement of a gluten-free diet.

441

442

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Skeletal dysplasias
This heterogeneous group of mostly dominantly inherited disorders
includes achondroplasia and hypochondroplasia.
These children usually have severe disproportionate short stature and a
positive or suspicious family history.
Radiological assessment by skeletal survey often allows a speciﬁc diagnosis to be made.
High-dose GH therapy has been used in these disorders, with variable
success. Surgical leg-lengthening procedures before and/or after puberty
are also an additional option.

Small for gestational age (SGA) and intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR)
SGA is deﬁned as birth weight and/or length at least 2 SD below the mean
for gestational age. IUGR is deﬁned as growth failure on serial antenatal US
scans, and that would usually lead to a baby being born SGA. However,
IUGR in late gestation may result in a baby who is within 2 SD of the mean
for birth weight or length.
Ninety percent of infants with SGA show catch-up growth by age
3 years; 8% of subjects born SGA will remain small at 18 years of age.
Catch-up growth is more common in infants with relative sparing of birth
length and head circumference (>10th centile).
In severe IUGR, length and head circumference are also reduced. Severe
IUGR may be due to maternal factors such as hypertension in pregnancy,
placental dysfunction, or a wide range of chromosomal or genetic conditions in the fetus.
Russell-Silver syndrome is characterized by severe IUGR, lateral asymmetry, triangular facies, clinodactyly, and extremely poor infancy feeding
and postnatal weight gain.
Children with severe IUGR who do not undergo catch-up growth may
have early-onset puberty despite bone age delay and therefore achieve a
very poor ﬁnal height.
Numerous epidemiological studies have shown a relationship between
low birth weight and an i risk of a number of disorders in later life, including hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The risk is i with rapid postnatal
weight gain. These associations relate to relatively low birth weight and
not exclusively to those born SGA.
Management
GH therapy is used in the SGA/IUGR child who has failed to show
catch-up growth by age 3 years. GH (at doses of 0.48 mg/kg/week) can
increase growth velocity and ﬁnal height. The effect of GH on later risk of
insulin resistance as type 2 diabetes is not known.

Turner’s syndrome
b Also see Box 50.1 (p. 258).
Turner’s syndrome should always be considered in a girl who is short
for her parental target. The classical dysmorphic features may be difﬁcult to identify at younger ages. Karyotype usually conﬁrms the diagnosis,

although sufﬁcient cells (>30) should be examined to exclude the possibility of mosaicism.
Clinical features
There may be a history of lymphedema in the newborn period. Typically,
growth velocity starts to decline from 3 to 5 years old (Fig. 75.6) and
gonadal failure combined with a degree of skeletal dysplasia results in loss
of the pubertal growth spurt.
Mean ﬁnal height is consistently 7.9 inches below the normal average
within each population (4 ft 8 inches in the U.S).
GH secretion is normal, although IGF-1 levels may be low. Ten percent
progress through puberty spontaneously but only 1% develop ovulatory
cycles.
Management
High-dose GH therapy (0.375 mg/kg/week) increases ﬁnal height, although
individual responses are variable. The height gained is related to time on GH
treatment, and thus GH therapy should be started early. If the diagnosis has
been made in early life, treatment is usually started at 3 to 5 years of age.

443

444

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Oral estrogen is started between 12 and 14 years of age, tailored to the
individual patient, to promote secondary sexual development and pubertal growth. It should be started in low dose (estradiol 0.5 mcg qod or
Premarin 0.6 mg qod), and gradually i with age.
Progesterone should be added if breakthrough bleeding occurs or when
estrogen dose reaches estradiol 1 mg/day or Premarin 0.6 mg/day.

TALL STATURE AND RAPID GROWTH

Tall stature and rapid growth
Deﬁnition
Although statistically as many children have heights >2 SD above the mean
as have heights >2 SD below the mean, referral for evaluation of tall stature is much less common than for short stature.
Socially, for boys heights up to 6 ft 9 in are typically considered acceptable, whereas for girls heights >6 ft may be problematic. Tall stature and
particularly accelerated growth rates in early childhood can indicate an
underlying hormonal disorder, such as precocious puberty.
For causes, see Box 75.2.

Assessment
History
• Is tall stature long-standing, or does the history suggest recent growth
acceleration? Try to obtain previous measurements.
• Inquire about size at birth, infancy weight gain, intellectual
development, and neurological development.
• Inquire about headaches, visual disturbance, and evidence of puberty.
• Is there a family history of tall stature or early puberty?

Box 75.2 Causes of tall stature in childhood
Normal variants
• Familial tall stature
• Early maturation (largely familial but also promoted by earlychildhood nutrition and obesity. Height is not excessive for bone
age, which is advanced)
Hormonal
• See Precocious puberty (p. 449)
• GH or GHRH excess (pituitary gigantism) resulting from pituitary
adenoma or ectopic adenomas is a very rare cause of tall stature
(b p. 110).
• Other hormonal excess, e.g., hyperthyroidism, congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (associated with signs of virilization), familial
glucocorticoid deﬁciency
• Rarely, estrogen receptor or aromatase deﬁciencies delay puberty
and epiphyseal fusion, resulting in tall adult height.
Chromosomal abnormalities
• XXY (Klinefelter’s syndrome)
• XYY, XYYY (each extra Y confers on average 13 cm additional height)
Other rare syndromes
Overgrowth and dysmorphic features are seen in Marfan syndrome,
homocystinuria, Sotos syndrome, Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, and
Weaver syndrome.

445

446

CHAPTER 75

Growth and stature

Examination
• Assess height and height velocity over at least 4–6 months.
• Measure sitting height and arm span.
• Pubertal stage?
• Dysmorphic features?
• Measure parents’ heights and calculate MPH (b see Assessment of
growth, p. 445).
Investigations
The following investigations may be clinically indicated:
• Left hand and wrist radiograph for bone age
• Sex hormone levels (testosterone, estrogen, androstenedione,
DHEAS), baseline and stimulated LH and FSH levels
• Karyotype
• Serum IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 levels
• Oral glucose tolerance test—GH levels normally suppress to low or
undetectable levels (<1 mU/L)
• Speciﬁc molecular tests for overgrowth syndromes

Management of tall stature
After excluding abnormal pathology, often only reassurance and information on predicted ﬁnal height are necessary. In younger children, early
induction of puberty using low-dose sex steroids advances the pubertal
growth spurt and promotes earlier epiphyseal fusion.
In older children already in puberty, high-dose estrogen therapy in girls,
or testosterone in boys, has been used to induce rapid skeletal maturation.
However, theoretical side effects of high-dose estrogen therapy include
thromboembolic disease and oncogenic risk.

NORMAL PUBERTY

Puberty

Normal puberty
Puberty is the sequence of physical and physiological changes occurring at
adolescence culminating in full sexual maturity.

Age at onset
Average age at onset of puberty is earlier in girls (~11 years) than in boys
(~12 years) but varies widely (~±2 years from the mean age of onset) and
is inﬂuenced by a number of factors:
• Historical: Age of menarche has d this century from 17 years in 1900
to 12.8 years today, presumably as a result of improved childhood
nutrition and growth.
• Genetic: Age at onset of puberty is partly familial.
• Ethnicity: Afro-Caribbean girls tend to have earlier puberty than whites.
• Weight gain: Earlier puberty is seen in girls who are overweight,
whereas girls who engage in strenuous activity and are thin often have
delayed puberty.

Hormonal changes prior to and during puberty
Adrenal androgens (DHEAS and androstenedione) rise 2 years before
puberty starts (adrenarche). This usually causes no physical changes but
occasionally results in early pubic hair and acne (premature adrenarche).
Pulsatile secretion of LHRH from the hypothalamus at night is the ﬁrst
step in the initiation of puberty and occurs well before physical signs of
puberty. This results in pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH from the pituitary, and the gonadotropin response to LHRH administration reverses from
the prepubertal FSH predominance to a higher response in LH levels.

Physical changes
The ﬁrst indication of puberty is typically breast development in girls
and increase in testicular size in boys. In each sex, puberty then typically
progresses in an orderly manner through distinct stages (see Table 76.1).
Puberty rating by an experienced observer involves identiﬁcation of
pubertal stage, particularly breast development in girls and testicular volume (by comparison with an orchidometer) in boys.

Pubertal growth spurt
Increased estrogen levels in both boys and girls lead to i GH secretion.
Peak height velocity occurs at puberty stage 2–3 in girls and is later in boys,
at stage 3–4 (testicular volume 10–12 mL).

PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY

Precocious puberty
Deﬁnition
Early onset of puberty is deﬁned as <8 years in girls and <9 years in boys.
Gonadotropin-dependent (“central” or “true”) precocious puberty is
characterized by early breast development in girls or testicular enlargement in boys.
Gonadotropin-independent puberty occurs from abnormal peripheral
sex hormone secretion, resulting in isolated development of certain secondary sexual characteristics. This may involve autonomous testosterone
production in a boy or autonomous estrogen production in a girl. In addition, testosterone production from the adrenal or an ovarian tumor can
induce virilization in a girl.

Assessment of precocious puberty
History
• Age when secondary sexual development ﬁrst noted
• What features are present and in what order did they appear?
E.g., virilization (pubic, axillary, or facial hair, acne, body odor), genital
or breast enlargement, galactorrhea (very rare), menarche, or cyclical
mood changes?
• Is there evidence of recent growth acceleration?
• Family history of early puberty?
• Past history of adoption or early weight gain or prior CNS abnormality
or insult (e.g., radiation)?
Examination
• Breast or genital and testicular size; degree of virilization
(clitoromegaly in girls indicates abnormal androgen levels)
• Neurological examination, particularly visual ﬁeld assessment and
fundoscopy
• Abdominal or testicular masses
• Skin (?café-au-lait patches—McCune–Albright [b see Chapter 85,
McCune–Albright syndrome, p. 486], or NF1)
• Assess height and height velocity over 4–6 months.
Investigations
The following investigations may be clinically indicated:
• Radiograph of left wrist and hand for bone age
• Thyroid function
• Sex hormone levels (testosterone, estrogen, androstenedione,
DHEAS)
• LH, FSH, and estradiol levels (baseline and after SQ leuprolide)
• 17AOH progesterone levels (baseline and 60 minutes post IV
cortrosyn) if congenital adrenal hyperplasia is suspected
• Tumor markers (AFP, BhCG)
• Midnight salivary cortisol
• Abdominal US scan (adrenal glands; ovaries)
• MRI scan (cranial; adrenal glands)

449

450

CHAPTER 76

Puberty

Central precocious puberty
This is due to premature activation of pulsatile LHRH secretion from the
hypothalamus, and the normal progression in physical changes is maintained. As precocious puberty is deﬁned as occurring younger than 2 SD
before the average age, in a normal distribution, 2.5% of children will have
early-onset puberty.
In practice, in girls, central precocious puberty is more likely to be idiopathic or familial, whereas boys have a greater risk of intracranial or other
pathology.
Causes
• Idiopathic or familial
• Intracranial tumors, hydrocephalus, or other lesions
• Post–cranial irradiation or trauma
• Intracranial tumors (in particular, optic nerve glioma and hypothalamic
germinoma), harmatoma, hydrocephalus, and nonspeciﬁc brain injury
(e.g., cerebral palsy)
• May also be triggered by long-standing elevation in sex hormones
resulting from any peripheral source or adrenal enzyme defect
(e.g., late-presenting simple virilizing CAH or inadequately treated
CAH)
• Hypothyroidism (elevated TRH stimulates FSH release)—rare
• Gonadotropin-secreting tumors (e.g., pituitary adenoma or
hepatoblastoma) are rare.
Treatment
The aims of treatment are as follows:
• Avoid psychosocial problems for the child or family
• Prevent reduced ﬁnal height due to premature bone maturation and
early epiphyseal fusion. A ﬁnal height prediction is often necessary
when considering the need for inhibition of puberty
Pituitary LH and FSH secretion can be inhibited by the use of LHRH analogs, e.g., Lupron 0.3 mg/kg IM monthly (comes as 7.5, 11.25, or 15 mg
doses).
Treatment efﬁcacy should be monitored regularly by clinical observation. The dose may need to be increased if there is evidence of inadequate
suppression of pubertal development.

Gonadotropin-independent precocious puberty
At least two genetic syndromes have been identiﬁed, both resulting in
abnormal activation of gonadotropin receptors independent of normal ligand binding. Thus, in these conditions, the gonads autonomously secrete sex
hormones and levels of LH and FSH are suppressed by feedback inhibition.
McCune–Albright syndrome
b Also see Chapter 85, McCune–Albright syndrome (p. 486). This is a
sporadic condition due to a somatic activating mutation of the GSA protein
subunit that affects bones (polyostotic ﬁbrous dysplasia) and skin (café-aulait spots) and potentially contributes to multiple endocrinopathies.

PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY

A number of different hormone receptors share the same G protein–
coupled cyclic AMP second messenger system, and hyperthyroidism or
hyperparathyroidism may also be present.
All cells descended from the mutated embryonic cell-line are affected,
while cells descended from nonmutated cells develop into normal tissues.
Thus, the phenotype is highly variable in physical distribution and severity.
Treatment is with an aromatase inhibitor (letrozole).
Testotoxicosis
This is a rare familial condition resulting in precocious puberty only in
boys, due to an activating LH receptor mutation. Testes show only little increase in size and on biopsy Leydig cell hyperplasia is characteristic.
Treatment is with a combination of androgen receptor–blocking agents
(cyproterone acetate) and aromatase inhibitors or with ketoconazole.

Peripheral sex hormone secretion
Excessive peripheral androgen secretion may occur due to CAH or androgen-secreting adrenal or gonadal tumors. These children usually have
rapid growth, advanced bone age, and moderate to severe virilization in
the absence of testicular or breast development. (Note: a testicular tumor
may cause asymmetrical enlargement).
Peripheral estrogen production from ovarian tumors is a rare cause of
precocious breast development in girls.

Premature thelarche
Premature breast development in the absence of other signs of puberty
may present at any age from infancy. Breast size may ﬂuctuate and is often
asymmetrical.
The cause is unknown, although typically FSH levels (but not LH) are
elevated and ovarian US may reveal a single large cyst. Bone maturation,
growth rate, and ﬁnal height are unaffected.
Thelarche variant
This is an intermediate condition between premature thelarche and central precocious puberty. The etiology is unknown.
These girls demonstrate i height velocity and rate of bone maturation
and ovarian US reveals a more multicystic appearance, as seen in true
puberty. There is probably a whole spectrum of presentations between
premature thelarche and true precocious puberty.
The decision to treat should take into account height velocity and ﬁnal
height prediction as well as the rate of physical maturation and the severity of accompanying pubertal features (e.g., mood swings and difﬁcult
behavior).

Premature adrenarche and pubarche
The normal onset of adrenal androgen secretion (adrenarche) occurs 1–2
years before the onset of puberty. Premature or exaggerated adrenarche
is thought to be due to i androgen production or sensitivity and presents
with mild features of virilization, such as onset of pubic hair (pubarche) or
acne, in the absence of other features of puberty.

451

452

CHAPTER 76

Puberty

Clitoromegaly in girls suggests a more severe pathology with excessive
androgen production (e.g., CAH or androgen-secreting tumor).
The diagnosis is made in the presence of pubic hair and/or axillary hair;
the absence of breast or testicular development in children aged <8 years.
It is more common in girls.
Management
The management of premature adrenarche usually only requires reassurance after exclusion of other causes, as there is no signiﬁcant impact on
ﬁnal height and onset or progression of puberty.
Some of these girls may subsequently develop features of polycystic
ovary disease. In these cases, treatment should be directed at the presenting feature (e.g., hirsutism, menstrual irregularities).

DELAYED OR ABSENT PUBERTY

Delayed or absent puberty
Deﬁnition
Delayed puberty is deﬁned as failure to progress into puberty by >2
SD later than the average, i.e., >13 years in girls and >14 years in boys.
Clinically, boys are more likely to present with delayed puberty than girls.
In addition, some children present with delay in progression from one
pubertal stage to the next for >2 years.
Psychological distress may be exacerbated by declining growth velocity
relative to that of peers. In the long term, severe delay may be a risk factor
for d bone mineral density and osteoporosis.

Causes
General
• Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (this is the most common
cause; b see Constitutional delay of growth and puberty, p. 436).
• Chronic childhood disease, malabsorption (e.g., celiac disease,
inﬂammatory bowel disease), or undernutrition
Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism
Gonadal failure may be either of the following:
• Congenital (e.g., Turner’s syndrome in girls, Klinefelter’s syndrome in
boys)
• Acquired (e.g., following chemotherapy, local radiotherapy, infection,
torsion)
In these conditions, basal and stimulated gonadotropin levels are raised.
Gonadotropin deﬁciency
• Kallman syndrome (including anosmia)
• HP lesions (tumors, post-radiotherapy, dysplasia)
• Rare inactivating mutations of genes encoding LH, FSH (or their
receptors)
These conditions may also present in the newborn period with micropenis
and undescended testes in boys.

Investigation
The following investigations may be clinically indicated:
• LH and FSH levels
• Plasma estrogen or testosterone levels
• Measurement of androgen levels before and after hCG therapy may be
used to indicate presence of functional testicular tissue in boys.
• Karyotype
• Pelvic US in girls to determine ovarian morphology
• US or MRI imaging in boys to detect an intra-abdominal testes
It may be difﬁcult to distinguish between constitutional delay and gonadotropin deﬁciency, as gonadotropin levels are low in both conditions. In
these cases, pharmacological induction of puberty may be indicated with
regular assessment of testicular growth in boys (which is independent of

453

CHAPTER 76

Puberty

testosterone therapy) followed by withdrawal of treatment and reassessment when ﬁnal height is reached.

Management
Depending on the age and concern of the child and parents, shortcourse exogenous sex steroids can be used to induce pubertal changes.
If gonadotropin deﬁciency is permanent or the gonads are dysfunctional
or absent, then exogenous sex steroids are required to induce and maintain pubertal development (b see Constitutional delay of growth and
puberty, p. 436).
Long-term treatment
See Table 76.2.
Boys
Testosterone (by IM injection): 50 mg q4–6 weeks, gradually i to 250 mg
q4 weeks.
• Monitor penile enlargement, pubic hair, height velocity, and adult body
habitus.
• Side effects include severe acne and rarely priapism.
Girls
Estrogen (oral): Start at low dose (estradiol 0.5 mcg qod or Premarin
0.3 mg qod) and gradually increase.
• Promotes breast development and adult body habitus
• Progesterone (oral) should be added if breakthrough bleeding occurs or
when estrogen dose reaches 1 mcg/day.

NORMAL SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

Sexual differentiation

Normal sexual differentiation
Gonadal development
In the male or female embryo, the bipotential gonad develops as a thickening of mesenchymal cells and coelomic epithelium around the primitive
kidney. This genital ridge is then colonized by primordial germ cells that
migrate from the yolk sac to form the gonadal ridge. In the absence of a Y
chromosome, the gonad will develop into an ovary.
In the presence of a normal Y chromosome, immature Sertoli cells,
germs cells, and seminiferous tubules can be recognized by 7 weeks, and
testis differentiation is complete by 9 weeks. The SRY gene is an essential sex-determining region on the Y chromosome that signals for testis
differentiation.

Internal genitalia
Embryonic Müllerian structures form the uterus, fallopian tubes, and
upper 1/3 of the vagina.
In males, by 6 weeks, anti-Müllerian hormone is secreted by immature
Sertoli cells in the testis, and this causes regression of the Müllerian structures. Leydig cells appear in the testis around day 60 and produce testosterone under placental hCG stimulation.
Testosterone promotes growth and differentiation of the Wolfﬁan
ducts to form the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles.

External genitalia
In the absence of any androgen secretion, the labia majora, labia minora,
and clitoris develop from the embryonic genital swelling, genital fold, and
genital tubercle, respectively.
Development of normal male external genitalia requires testosterone
production from the testis and its conversion to dihydrotestosterone by
the enzyme 5A-reductase. In the presence of dihydrotestosterone, the
genital tubercle elongates to form the corpora cavernosa and glans penis,
the urethral fold forms the penile shaft, and the labioscrotal swelling forms
the scrotum.
This process commences at around 9 weeks and is completed by
13 weeks. Testicular descent in males occurs in the later two-thirds of
gestation under control of fetal LH and testosterone.

455

456

CHAPTER 77

Sexual differentiation

Assessment of ambiguous genitalia
Most cases of ambiguous genitalia present at birth. Involvement of an
experienced pediatric endocrinologist and surgeon should be sought as
early as possible.

History
• Any maternal medications during pregnancy?
• Are parents consanguineous, or is there a family history of ambiguous
genitalia?
• Is there a neonatal history of hypoglycemia or prolonged jaundice?

Examination
• Assess clitoris or phallus size, degree of labial fusion, and position of
urethra and urogenital sinus (anterior or posterior).
• Are gonads palpable? Check along line of descent.
• Are there any signs indicating panhypopituitarism (e.g., midline defects,
hypoglycemia, hypocortisolemia, prolonged jaundice)?
• Dysmorphic features of Turner’s syndrome may be seen in XO/XY
mosaicism.

Investigations
• Blood for karyotype, electrolytes, glucose, 17AOH progesterone
• US of pelvis and labial folds (for Müllerian structures and gonads)
• After the infant is 48 hours old, when the neonatal hormonal surge has
decreased, repeat blood tests for 17AOH progesterone, cortisol, LH,
FSH, and androgen levels.
• Examination under anesthesia (EUA) and cystogram may be required.

Speciﬁc tests
• ACTH stimulation test may be required when CAH is suspected, to
assess cortisol secretion and aid in diagnosis.
• 3-day HCG test in an undervirilized “male” (testes present or 46,
XY) assesses stimulated gonadal production of androgens and may be
diagnostic of androgen biosynthesis defects or androgen insensitivity.
• Glucagon test is an alternative test to examine cortisol and GH
secretion.
• Androgen receptor function can be tested on cultured ﬁbroblasts from
a genital skin biopsy.
• DNA analysis for androgen receptor mutation, CAH mutations, and
androgen biosynthesis mutations

DISORDERS OF SEX DEVELOPMENT (DSD)

Disorders of sex development (DSD)
Male and female internal and external genitalia develop from common
embryonic structures. In the absence of male-differentiating signals, normal female genitalia develop.
Genital ambiguity may therefore occur as a result of chromosomal
abnormality, gonadal dysgenesis, biochemical defects of androgen synthesis, inappropriate exposure to external androgens, or androgen receptor
insensitivity.

46XX DSD
Disorders of ovarian development
Normal male differentiation can occur if the SRY gene has been translocated onto an autosome.
Biochemical defects leading to androgen oversecretion
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH, 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency most
commonly) is the most common cause of ambiguous genitalia in 46, XX.
Maternal hyperandrogenism
The female fetus may be virilized if maternal androgen levels exceed the
capacity of placental aromatase to convert these to estrogen.
This may occur from maternal disease (e.g., CAH, adrenal and ovarian
tumors) or use of androgenic medication in pregnancy or, rarely, placental
aromatase deﬁciency.

46XY DSD
Disorders of testis development
XY gonadal dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in a number of genes
controlling male sexual differentiation, including SRY, SF-1, WT-1, and SOX,
and can present with normal external genitalia.
There is early testicular failure resulting from torsion or infarction.
Biochemical defects of androgen synthesis
Rare deﬁciencies of the enzymes 5A-reductase, 17β-hydroxysteroid
dehydrogenase, or 3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which are also
associated with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid deﬁciencies, are
autosomal recessively inherited and may result in variable degrees of
undervirilization.
Androgen receptor insensitivity syndrome
b Also see Androgen insensitivity syndrome (p. 335).
Defects of the androgen receptor gene on the X chromosome, or autosomal post-receptor signaling genes, may result in complete or partial
androgen insensitivity.
Complete androgen insensitivity results in normal female external genitalia and usually only presents with testicular prolapse in childhood or
primary amenorrhea in adolescence.
In partial androgen insensitivity, presentation may vary from mild
virilization to micropenis, hypospadias, undescended testes, or only d
spermatogenesis.

457

458

CHAPTER 77

Sexual differentiation

Gonadotropin defects
Gonadotropin deﬁciency may occur in hypopituitarism or may be associated with anosmia (Kallmann syndrome). It usually presents with delayed
puberty but is an occasional cause of micropenis and undescended
testes.
LH receptor gene defects are rare and result in complete absence of
virilization, as the testes are unable to respond to placental hCG.
Anti-Müllerian hormone deﬁciency or insensitivity
Testes are usually undescended and uterus and fallopian tubes are
present.

Management of ambiguous genitalia
In the newborn period, the infant should be monitored in the hospital for
the following:
• Hypoglycemia (until hypopituitarism is excluded)
• Salt-wasting (until CAH is excluded)
Explain to the parents that the infant appears to be healthy but has a
defect that interferes with determining sex. It is helpful to show the parents the physical ﬁndings as you explain this. Advise them to postpone the
registration of the birth until after further investigations, and discuss what
they will say to relatives and friends.
Sex assignment
Decision on the sex of rearing should be based on the optimal expected
outcome in terms of psychosexual and reproductive function. Parents
should be allowed discussion with an endocrinologist, a surgeon specializing in urogenital reconstruction, a psychologist, and a social worker.
Following the necessary investigations and discussions, early gender
assignment is thought to optimize the psychosexual outcome, but further
research into this area is still required.
Further management
• If female sex is assigned, any testicular tissue should be removed.
• Reconstructive surgery may include clitoral reduction, gonadectomy,
and vaginoplasty in girls, and phallus enlargement, hypospadias repair,
and orchidopexy in boys. In both sexes, multiple-stage procedures may
be required.
• Testosterone may enhance phallus size in male infants and a trial of
therapy is sometimes useful before sex assignment.
• Hormone replacement therapy may also be required from puberty
into adulthood.
• Continuing psychological support for the parents and child is very
important.

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
b Also see Chapter 47, Congenital adrenal hyperplasia in adults (p. 239).
A number of autosomally inherited enzyme deﬁciencies result in cortisol deﬁciency, excess pituitary ACTH secretion, and adrenal gland
hyperplasia.

21-hydroxylase deﬁciency (>90%)
The most common cause of CAH results in cortisol and mineralocorticoid deﬁciency, while the build-up of precursor steroids is channeled
toward excess adrenal androgen synthesis. Different gene defects in the
21-hydroxylase gene (e.g., deletion, splice site, or point mutation) result
in different degrees of enzyme dysfunction and thus wide variation in
phenotypes.
Clinical features
Virilization of female fetuses may result in clitoromegaly and labial fusion
at birth. 75% have sufﬁcient mineralocorticoid deﬁciency to cause renal
salt-wasting.
Because males have normal genitalia at birth, they may present acutely ill
in the neonatal period with vomiting, dehydration, collapse, hyponatremia,
and hyperkalemia. Non-salt-wasting boys present with early genital
enlargement, pubarche, and rapid growth.
If untreated or poorly treated, both sexes may develop pubic hair, acne,
rapid height velocity, advanced bone maturation, and precocious puberty
that may result in very short ﬁnal height.
Nonclassic CAH is due to milder 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency, and affected
girls present in later childhood or adulthood with hirsutism, acne, premature or exaggerated adrenarche, menstrual irregularities, and infertility.

11B-hydroxylase deﬁciency (~5%)
This enzyme, which converts 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol, is the ﬁnal step
in cortisol synthesis. In addition to excess adrenal androgens, the overproduced precursor corticosterone has mineralocorticoid activity. Thus, in
contrast to salt-wasting in 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency, these subjects may
have hypernatremia and hypokalemia.
Hypertension is rarely seen in infancy but may develop during childhood
and affects 50–60% of adults.

Speciﬁc investigations for CAH
b See also Assessment of ambiguous genitalia (p. 456).
• Plasma 17AOH progesterone: An elevated level indicates
21-hydroxylase deﬁciency. It may be difﬁcult to distinguish this
from the physiological hormonal surge that occurs in the ﬁrst 2
days of life. This test should therefore be repeated (together with
11-deoxycortisol) after 48 hours of age.
• An ACTH stimulation test may be required to discriminate between
the different enzyme deﬁciencies.
• Plasma electrolytes may need to be monitored over the ﬁrst 2 weeks.
• Plasma renin level is also useful to conﬁrm salt-wasting in those with
normal serum sodium and relatively mild 21-hydroxylase deﬁciency.

459

460

CHAPTER 77

Sexual differentiation

Other rare enzyme deﬁciencies
17A-Hydrolxylase deﬁciency
This impairs cortisol, androgen, and estrogen synthesis, but overproduction of mineralocorticoids leads to hypokalemia and hypertension.
3B-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase deﬁciency
This impairs cortisol, mineralocorticoid, and androgen biosynthesis. Males
have hypospadias and undescended testes. However, excess DHEA, a
weak androgen, may cause mild virilization in females.

Steroid acute regulatory protein
• STAR mutation: 46XY sex reversal and severe adrenal failure.
Heterozygous defect. Extremely rare
• CYPIIAI (P450: side-chain cleavage cytochrome enzyme): 46XY sex
reversal and severe adrenal failure. Heterozygous defect. Extremely rare
• P450 oxidoreductase deﬁciency: Biochemical picture of combined
21-hydroxylase/17A-hydrolxylase/17, 20 Lyase deﬁciencies. Spectrum
of presentation from children with ambiguous genitalia, adrenal failure,
and the Antley–Bixler skeletal dysplasia through to mildly affected
individuals with polycystic ovarian syndrome

Management
• Hydrocortisone (10–20 mg/m2 per day orally in 3 divided doses). In
older patients, prednisone or dexamethasone can also be employed.
In addition to treating cortisol deﬁciency, this therapy suppresses
ACTH and thereby limits excessive production of adrenal androgens.
Occasionally, higher doses are required to achieve adequate androgen
suppression, however overtreatment may suppress growth.

Box 77.1 Deﬁnitions
Disorders of chromosomes
These include the following:
• 45X Turner and variants
• 47XXY and variants
• 45X/46XY mixed gonadal dysgenesis
• 46XX/46XY gonadal chimera
46XX DSD
These include the following:
• Disorders of gonadal (ovarian) development
• Androgen excess
• Structural disorders, e.g., cloacal extrophy, vaginal atresia
46XY DSD
These include the following:
• Disorders of gonadal (testicular) development
• Disorders in androgen synthesis and action
• Structural disorders, e.g., severe hypospadias, cloacal extrophy

CONGENITAL ADRENAL HYPERPLASIA

• In salt losers, initial IV ﬂuid resuscitation (10–20 mL/kg normal saline) may
be required to treat circulatory collapse. Long-term mineralocorticoid
replacement (ﬂudrocortisone 0.05–0.3 mg/day) may have incomplete
efﬁcacy, particularly in infancy, and sodium chloride supplements are also
needed. Up to 4–5 meq/kg/day split qid may be needed in infancy.
• Reconstructive surgery (clitoral reduction, vaginoplasty) is often
performed in infancy and further procedures may be required during
puberty. This requires an experienced surgeon.
• Warn of the need for extra steroid during stress.

Monitoring of hormonal therapy
Height velocity and bone age
If hydrocortisone therapy is insufﬁcient, the growth rate will be above normal and bone age will be advanced. Conversely, if hydrocortisone therapy
is excessive, growth is suppressed.
17AOHP
Blood levels should be assessed periodically, especially when clinical signs of
rapid growth or bone age advancement occur. Complete normalization of
17AOHP levels should be avoided, as this often leads to overtreatment.
In girls and prepubertal boys, androgen levels (testosterone and androstendione) can be measured if there is concern about poor control and/
or virilization.
Mineralocorticoid and sodium replacement
This should be monitored by measuring plasma electrolytes and renin levels and by regular blood pressure assessments.

Genetic advice
The inheritance of CAH is autosomal recessive, and parents should be
informed of a 25% risk of recurrence in future offspring.
If the mutation is identiﬁable on DNA analysis in the child and parents,
chorionic villus sampling may allow prenatal diagnosis.
Maternal dexamethasone therapy from around 5–6 weeks of pregnancy
can be used to prevent virilization of the female fetus.

CHAPTER 78

The neuroendocrine system

The neuroendocrine system

Introduction
Neuroendocrine cells are found in many sites throughout the body. They
are particularly prominent in the GI tract and pancreas and share a common embryological origin. These cells have the ability to synthesize, store,
and release peptide hormones.
Given the prevalence of neuroendocrine cells, most neuroendocrine
tumors occur within the gastroenteropancreatic axis. Of these tumors,
>50% are traditionally termed carcinoid tumors and have been usually subclassiﬁed into foregut, midgut, and hindgut lesions, with the remainder
largely comprising pancreatic islet cell tumors.
Carcinoid and islet cell tumors are generally slow growing.

11(1):1–18.

INCIDENCE

Carcinoid tumors

Deﬁnition and classiﬁcation
Historically, these tumors have been divided into those arising in the
foregut, midgut, or hindgut.
Strictly speaking, carcinoid tumors are serotonin secreting and argentafﬁn positive (take up silver stain), so the term should be reserved for
those tumors that fulﬁll these criteria. Increasingly, the remainder are
being classiﬁed as neuroendocrine tumors together with their tissue of
origin.
About 85% of carcinoid tumors develop in the GI tract, 10% in the lung,
and the rest in various organs such as the thymus or ovary.
In 30% of patients, carcinoid tumors are multiple, and associations with
other malignancies such as adenocarcinomas of the GI tract and prostate
are recognized.

Incidence
The annual incidence of carcinoid tumors is approximately 2.5 per 100,000
population, although postmortem studies suggest that this may be a signiﬁcant underestimate.

465

466

CHAPTER 79

Carcinoid tumors

Carcinoid syndrome
This syndrome only occurs in a subset of patients with carcinoid tumors
(<10%). It occurs when sufﬁcient vasoactive substances (e.g., serotonin,
histamine, tachykinins, kallikrein, and prostaglandins) are released into the
systemic circulation. For this reason, almost all patients with the carcinoid
syndrome due to GI tumors have hepatic metastases.
In contrast, some bronchial carcinoids may present with classical features of the syndrome without metastatic disease.
The original description of the syndrome includes ﬂushing, diarrhea,
asthma, right heart valvular lesions, and pellagra-like skin lesions.
In a published series of patients from Sweden with known GI carcinoids,
84% presented with diarrhea, 75% with ﬂushing, and 44% with intestinal
obstruction. During the course of the illness, it was noted that 33% of the
patients had carcinoid heart disease and 15% complained of symptoms of
wheezing.1
The carcinoid ﬂush may be precipitated by spicy food, hot drinks, alcohol, exercise, and postural changes. The cause of ﬂushing is heterogeneous
and results from the release of a variety of vasoactive substances. Acute
attacks typically cause a diffuse erythematous ﬂush affecting the face and
upper thorax, whereas long-standing carcinoid may be associated with a
violacious ﬂush and facial telangiectasia.
A life-threatening carcinoid crisis (ﬂushing, BP ﬂuctuations, bronchoconstriction, arrhythmias, altered mental status) can be provoked in these
patients as a result of anesthesia or surgical manipulation of the tumor.

Box 79.1 Carcinoid heart disease
• Occurs in up to two-thirds of patients with the carcinoid syndrome
• The mechanism is poorly understood although is thought to be
related to serotonin.
• Pathologically, the lesions are characterized by ﬁbrous thickening of
the endocardium in plaques.
• The right side of the heart is typically involved. Thickening and
retraction of the tricuspid and pulmonary valve leaﬂets lead to
tricuspid regurgitation in nearly all cases and, less commonly, to
pulmonary regurgitation, tricuspid stenosis, and pulmonary stenosis.
The left side of the heart is involved in <10% of cases.
• Valve replacement can be beneﬁcial, but surgery may be associated
with signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality.

206(2):115–125.

DIAGNOSTIC INVESTIGATIONS

Diagnostic investigations
Pathology
Historically, carcinoid tumors have been identiﬁed by their reaction to
silver stains (argentafﬁn positive).
Characterizing the tumor histpathologically is very important and currently includes the use of speciﬁc immunohistochemical stains such as
chromogranin A, synaptophysin, serotonin, and gastrin.
Ki67, a marker of cell proliferation, is also used by some centers to
guide treatment.

Biochemical investigations
A 24-hour urinary 5HIAA (serotonin metabolite) assessment has traditionally been the mainstay of both diagnosis and monitoring. The test offers a
speciﬁcity of nearly 100% and a sensitivity of 70%.
Elevated levels are usually only associated with midgut tumors and only
once they have metastasized. Elevated levels correlate well with symptoms of the carcinoid syndrome and are useful in monitoring response
to treatment.
False-positive tests may result from dietary sources of serotonin (e.g.,
bananas, avocados, tomatoes, walnuts, pecan nuts, caffeine, pineapples,
and chocolate) and interference from drugs (e.g., acetaminophen, nicotine,
phenobarbital, phenacetin).
Plasma or platelet serotonin are alternatives to urine testing, although
the speciﬁcity is uncertain.
The most sensitive biochemical marker for neuroendocrine tumors is
plasma chromogranin A (false positive—renal/liver failure, proton pump
inhibitors [PPIs], gastritis, inﬂammatory bowel disease; false negative—
L-dopa, phenothiazines). For carcinoid tumors the sensitivity of the test is
nearly 100%, but the speciﬁcity is lower than for urinary 5HIAA as raised
levels are found in most neuroendocrine tumors.
A plasma gut hormone proﬁle may also be useful for identiﬁcation of
tumor markers such as gastrin, pancreatic polypeptide, and somatostatin.
Liver biochemistry is an unreliable marker of hepatic involvement as the
alkaline phosphatase may remain in the normal range despite extensive
metastatic disease.

Exclude associated inherited syndromes
Carcinoid tumors may rarely be associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 1 (MEN1), von Hippel–Lindau syndrome (VHL), type
1 neuroﬁbromatosis (NF1), and tuberous sclerosis.

467

468

CHAPTER 79

Carcinoid tumors

Tumor localization and staging
The aim of imaging with abdominal US, CT, and MRI is to both localize the
primary tumor and assess the extent of metastatic spread.
On CT, hepatic carcinoid metastases are usually multifocal, showing
enhancement after IV contrast and frequently with low-attenuation areas
of necrosis. MRI is at least as sensitive as CT, with lesions being iso-intense
on T1-weighted images but of high signal on T2-weighted images.
More than 80% of carcinod tumors have somatostatin receptors, and
scanning with radiolabeled octreotide can provide very useful information about the localization and extent of metastatic disease. It frequently
reveals previously unidentiﬁed extrahepatic sites of disease.
PET scanning, where available, can be useful for tumor localization and
staging in difﬁcult cases.

Box 79.2 Monitoring treatment
• Urinary 5HIAA or serum chromogranin A can be useful to monitor
response to therapy if these markers were elevated at diagnosis.
• Imaging modalities are also essential to monitor tumor bulk.

TREATMENT

Treatment
A multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of these tumors is essential.

Surgical treatment
In patients with local disease, surgery can be curative, but most patients
have metastatic disease by the time they seek treatment.
Even in patients with widespread local disease or distant metastases,
surgery may still be of beneﬁt by reducing overall tumor bulk and thereby
affording a more favorable response to subsequent nonsurgical therapies.
Surgery may be required to alleviate obstructive intestinal disease.
Liver transplantation may be considered in a very few selected patients
in whom extrahepatic tumor spread and primary tumor recurrence has
been excluded.

Box 79.3 Perioperative management of carcinoid tumors
It may be useful to give IV octreotide in the perioperative period, as
anesthesia, surgery, and embolization may be associated with the release
of various vasoactive peptides that can result in hypotension and bronchospasm, leading to a potentially fatal carcinoid crisis.

Medical treatment
Certain symptom speciﬁc medical agents can be useful, such as loperamide
or codeine for diarrhea.

Somatostatin analogs
Octreotide and its longer-acting analogs reduce the level of biochemical
tumor markers in the majority of patients and control symptoms in around
70% of cases. However, radiological evidence of tumor regression with
these agents is rare.
Patient resistance to somatostatin analogs is common after a few years.
This potential for tachyphylaxis makes the early use of somatostatin analogs in asymptomatic patients controversial.
Patients are usually given a test dose of SC octreotide and then generally started on the more convenient longer-acting analogs. Short-acting SC
octreotide tid may be continued until cover with the longer-acting analog
is complete.
A continuous IV infusion of octreotide is the most effective treatment
for a carcinoid crisis and is generally given at a rate of 50–100 mcg/h.
A new somatostatin analog (SOM230—pasireotide) with high afﬁnity
for receptor subtypes 1, 2, 3, and 5 is currently under evaluation in phase
III trials.

Hepatic embolization
This can be performed by surgeons or, increasingly, by interventional radiologists. It is a palliative procedure offering symptom relief by decreasing
tumor bulk.

469

470

CHAPTER 79

Carcinoid tumors

The duration of improvement may be short-lived, and occasionally signiﬁcant side effects such as the hepatorenal syndrome may occur.

External beam radiotherapy
This may provide palliation in those with symptomatic bone metastases or
spinal cord compression.

Chemotherapy
Cytotoxic chemotherapy may be considered in patients with advanced,
progressive, or uncontrolled symptomatic disease. The beneﬁt is
debatable.
The most promising combination of streptozotocin and 5-ﬂuorouracil
(5-FU) produces only short-lasting responses in 10–30% of patients with
carcinoid tumors, in contrast to the 50–60% response rate of pancreatic
neuroendocrine tumors. Capecitabine (prodrug of 5-FU) can be administered orally, and it may offer a more speciﬁc antitumor effect.
Side effects (e.g., ﬂu-like symptoms, fatigue, weight loss, bone marrow
suppression) are generally less severe than with conventional chemotherapy but are still the main limitation to its use.
Alpha2b-Interferon
There is a good biochemical response rate (about 45%), with clinical
improvement of the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome in 70% of patients.
Tumor shrinkage has rarely been described.
A combination of octreotide and A2b-interferon has been shown to
produce biochemical and symptomatic improvement in some patients
previously resistant to either drug alone. However, there is limited effect
on tumor size.

Radioactive isotope therapy
These are relatively new modalities with few long-term data.
There is increasing evidence to suggest that if a positive diagnostic
uptake scan is obtained, therapeutic treatment with the relevant radionuclide can offer at least signiﬁcant symptomatic improvement. A few studies have suggested tumor stabilization or regression may be achieved in
some cases.
Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs
Radiolabeled somatostatin analogs, such as 111InDTPA octreotide, the
newer 90YDOTA octreotide, and 177Lu octreotate, which have high afﬁnity
for type 2 somatostatin receptors, have been used as therapy. Because
111
InDTPA octreotide has low tissue penetration, and a stable coupling
of alpha- or beta-emitting isotopes to DTPA octreotide could not be
achieved, newer compounds (90YDOTA octreotide, 177Lu octreotate)
were developed.
90
YDOTA octreotide may result in partial remission in 10–25% of
patients, while 177Lu octreotate has proved very successful in achieving
tumor regression in animal models with encouraging preliminary human
studies (remission in 38% and stable disease in 4% at 3 months).

PROGNOSIS

Radiolabeled MIBG
MIBG is structurally related to norepinephrine. After IV injection, up to 70%
of carcinoid tumors concentrate signiﬁcant amounts of the compound.
Limited published data suggest 65–80% of these patients treated with
MIBG have palliation of symptoms for varying lengths of time (6–24
months).

Future treatments
Antiangiogenic agents such as inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth
factor are currently being evaluated and may be of beneﬁt in preventing
tumor progression.

Pellagra
Rarely, pellagra may develop due to nicotinamide deﬁciency secondary to
excessive tryptophan metabolism.
Nicotinamide supplementation is therapeutic.

Prognosis
The site of origin and the size of the primary tumor, together with the
extent of metastatic disease, largely determine the prognosis.
Many carcinoid tumors are indolent and are frequently a postmortem
ﬁnding having caused no signiﬁcant symptoms during life.
When the disease is conﬁned locally to the region of the primary tumor,
the 5-year survival is >90%.
Individual patients have been reported to live 20–30 years after the
diagnosis of metastatic carcinoid tumor, but this should not be considered
a benign disease. The 5-year survival rate when hepatic metastases are
present is approximately 20–40% with a median survival time being about
2 years.
Increasingly, evidence is suggesting that both survival time and quality
of life for patients are improved by the use of more active and aggressive
therapy.
The prognosis is greatly inﬂuenced by the development of carcinoid
heart disease and whether it is then amenable to treatment by heart valve
replacement.

CHAPTER 80

Insulinomas

Insulinomas

Deﬁnition
An insulinoma is a tumor of the endocrine pancreas that causes hypoglycemia through its inappropriate secretion of insulin. Unlike other endocrine
tumors of the pancreas, where malignancy is common, >90% of insulinomas are benign.
More than 80% of insulinomas are solitary, 10% are multiple and 10% are
malignant. 50% of patients with multiple insulinomas have MEN1.
Insulinomas are found with equal frequency throughout the head, body
and tail of the pancreas.

Incidence
The annual incidence of insulinoma is of the order of 1–2 per million
population.

Clinical presentation
Symptoms of hypoglycemia may include both adrenergic (e.g., pallor,
sweating, tremor, and tachycardia) and neuroglycopenic (e.g., irritability,
confusion, aggression, seizures, and coma) symptoms.
Patients typically give a history of relief of symptoms with food. Weight
gain occurs in at least 30% of patients.

Biochemical investigations
The gold standard test remains the supervised 72 hour fast. More than
95% of cases can by diagnosed by the 72 hour fast. While fasting, the
patient may consume only caffeine-free beverages, must remain active
and exercise normally. A laboratory glucose measurement of <40 mg/dL
should be found during symptoms in association with an inappropriately
normal or elevated insulin and C-peptide level. An insulin/glucose ratio of
>0.3 is abnormal and consistent with organic hyperinsulinism.
The presence of sulfonylurea metabolites in the urine or plasma should
be excluded, and the abuse of exogenous insulin considered.

TUMOR LOCALIZATION

Tumor localization
b See Table 80.1.
Islet cell tumors are often small and may not be detected by any imaging technique. The available radiological modalities have a wide reported
range of sensitivity that is frequently dependent on the equipment and
the operator.
MRI or spiral CT correctly detects >60% of tumors, but preoperative
localization can be difﬁcult in tumors <1 cm in diameter.
Arterial stimulation (with calcium or secretin) followed by venous sampling can localize approximately 90% of insulinomas but carries the risks of
a more invasive technique.
Endoscopic US, which requires specialized equipment and expertise,
may identify tumors as small as 5 mm. The head of the pancreas is visualized with the probe in the duodenum and the body and tail with it in the
stomach.
Intraoperative US using a transducer applied directly to the pancreas
improves the sensitivity of US to over 90%.
Experienced surgeons can frequently identify the lesions intraoperatively by palpation alone. The risk of multiple tumors makes a thorough
examination of the whole pancreas essential at operation.
Somatostatin receptor scintigraphy has been shown to be useful in
detecting insulinomas but it is dependent on somatostatin receptor subtype expression by the tumor.

CHAPTER 80

Insulinomas

Treatment
The treatment of choice in all but very elderly or debilitated patients is
surgical removal. The perioperative mortality rates are <1% in the hands
of an experienced surgeon. The mortality is largely inﬂuenced by the incidence of acute pancreatitis and peritonitis.
Postoperative hyperglycemia may occur even following partial
pancreatectomy.
Medical treatment to control symptoms may be achieved using a combination of diazoxide and octreotide.
Radiolabeled somatostatin analog therapy may induce a biochemical and
symptomatic response in patients with malignant insulinomas, and some
small-scale studies report tumor regression.

Prognosis
Following removal of a solitary insulinoma, life expectancy is restored to
normal.
Malignant insulinomas, with metastases usually to the liver, have a natural history of years rather than months and symptoms may be controlled
with medical therapy or speciﬁc antitumor therapy using streptozotocin
and 5-FU.
Average 5-year survival estimated to be approximately 35%.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

Gastrinomas

Deﬁnition
Gastrin, synthesized by the G cells situated predominantly in the gastric
antrum, is the principal gut hormone stimulating gastric acid secretion.
The Zollinger–Ellison (gastrinoma) syndrome is due to the excessive
release of gastrin by neuroendocrine tumors of the GI tract and pancreas.
Gastrinomas most commonly arise in the duodenum (70%), with the
remainder arising from the pancreas or adjacent lymph nodes.
About 60% of patients have metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis.

Prevalence
The estimated prevalence is of the order of 1 per million population.

Clinical presentation
Patients typically present with peptic and/or esophageal ulcers that are
multiple and refractory to standard medical treatment.
Complications of peptic ulcer disease, such as perforation, hemorrhage,
and pyloric stenosis, are frequently seen.
Malabsorption and diarrhea may be the main presenting complaint in
10–20% of patients and is due to acid-related inactivation of enzymes and
mucosal damage in the upper small bowel.
Up to 25% of gastrinoma patients may have MEN1. In this context, the
prevalence of multiple gastrinomas is higher than for sporadic tumors.

475

476

CHAPTER 81

Gastrinomas

Biochemical investigations
The diagnosis rests on ﬁnding an inappropriately elevated fasting plasma
gastrin in the presence of increased gastric acid secretion.
Patients should have antisecretory treatment stopped prior to the test
(3 days for H2 blockers and 2 weeks for PPIs), since these drugs are associated with hypergastrinemia. However, gastrin levels above 1000 pg/mL in
the presence of elevated gastric acid production, are virtually diagnostic
of a gastrinoma.
The secretin stimulation test is the most sensitive and speciﬁc stimulation test. A dose of 2 mcg/kg of secretin is given intravenously and blood
samples are drawn for gastrin at 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 minutes. A rise of >150
pg/mL is highly suggestive of gastrinoma.
A gut hormone proﬁle may identify elevated plasma levels of pancreatic
polypeptide or other gut hormones.
The tumor localization techniques described for insulinomas are also
relevant for gastrinomas (b Tumor localization, p. 473). Very small
tumors or duodenal tumors can be very hard to localize and even small
tumors are frequently associated with local lymph node disease.
Selective arterial angiography may be combined with a provocative test
for gastrin release using a bolus of calcium gluconate or secretin for elusive
small tumors.
For causes of hypergastrinemia, see Box 81.1.

Box 81.1 Causes of hypergastrinemia
Low or normal gastric acid production
• H2 blockers
• PPIs
• Vagotomy
• Hypochlorhydria
• Short gut syndrome
• Renal failure
• Hypercalcemia
Elevated gastric acid production
• Gastrinoma
• G-cell hyperplasia

TREATMENT

Treatment
The treatment of choice is complete surgical tumor removal, although this
is usually only considered after the tumor has been identiﬁed preoperatively. Surgery is rarely justiﬁed in patients with known hepatic metastases,
but some small studies have raised the possibility of beneﬁt from tumor
debulking.
Where preoperative imaging has failed to identify a tumor, the patient
is often best maintained on medical therapy with regular imaging to reassess (PPIs need to be given less frequently than H2 antagonists). Check
B12 annually.
Somatostatin analogs do not appear to be more effective at controlling gastric acid hypersecretion and relieving symptoms than PPIs or H2
blockers.
The data are currently limited, but as for insulinomas, radiolabeled
somatostatin analogs may be a future treatment option for gastrinomas.
In patients with MEN1, management is more controversial. The usual
policy is to operate when a well-deﬁned tumor can be identiﬁed.

CHAPTER 82

Glucagonomas

Glucagonomas

Deﬁnition
Glucagonomas are neuroendocrine tumors that usually arise from the
alpha cells of the pancreas and produce the glucagonoma syndrome
through the secretion of glucagon and other peptides derived from the
preproglucagon gene.
The large majority of glucagonomas are malignant, but they are also very
indolent tumors, and the diagnosis may be overlooked for many years.
Up to 90% of patients will have lymph node or liver metastases at the
time of presentation.
They are classically associated with the rash of necrolytic migratory
erythema.

Incidence
The annual incidence is estimated at 1 per 20 million population.

Clinical presentation
See Table 82.1.
The characteristic rash—necrolytic migratory erythema—occurs in
>70% of cases and usually manifests initially as a well-demarcated area
of erythema in the groin before migrating to the limbs, buttocks, and
perineum.
Mucous membrane involvement is common, with stomatitis, glossitis,
vaginitis, and urethritis being frequent features.
Glucagon antagonizes the effects of insulin, particularly on hepatic glucose metabolism, and glucose intolerance is a frequent association (>90%).
Sustained gluconeogenesis also causes amino acid deﬁciencies and results
in protein catabolism, which can be associated with unrelenting weight
loss in >60% of patients.
Glucagon has a direct suppressive effect on the bone marrow, resulting
in a normochromic normocytic anemia in almost all patients.
Up to 20% of glucagonoma patients will have associated MEN1.

A gut hormone proﬁle may also show elevated neuroendocrine markers such as pancreatic polypeptide.
Impaired glucose intolerance and hypoaminoacidemia may be present.

Tumor localization
At the time of diagnosis >60% of glucagonomas will have metastasized to
the liver and most primary tumors will be >3 cm in diameter.
These tumors rarely present problems of radiological localization.
Transabdominal US and CT scanning are usually adequate.
Small tumors may require more sophisticated imaging techniques
(b see Tumor localization, p. 473). Octreotide scanning probably offers
the best means of evaluating the extent of metastatic disease.

479

480

CHAPTER 82

Glucagonomas

Treatment
Surgery is the only curative therapeutic option, but the potential for a
complete cure may be as low as 5%.
In malignant disease, a surgical cure may still be achieved in those rare
cases where the metastases are conﬁned to the liver and the patient is
deemed suitable for a liver transplant.
Somatostatin analogs are the treatment of choice with excellent
response rates in treating the necrolytic migratory erythema. They are
less effective at reversing the weight loss and have an inconsistent effect
on glycemic control such that diabetes mellitus may need to be managed
with insulin therapy.
If octreotide fails, the rash may be improved using IV amino acids and
fatty acids.
Palliative chemotherapy using streptozotocin and 5-FU has been shown
to produce a 50% reduction in glucagon levels in 75% of patients, but the
beneﬁt is frequently only temporary.
Hepatic artery embolization may result in a dramatic relief of symptoms
with remissions of several months recorded.
As for the other pancreatic islet cell tumors, there are preliminary data
to suggest that radiolabeled somatostatin analogs may be therapeutic in
the glucagonoma syndrome.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION

VIPomas
Deﬁnition
In 1958, Verner and Morrison1 ﬁrst described a syndrome consisting of
refractory watery diarrhea and hypokalemia associated with a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas.
The syndrome of watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and acidosis (WDHA)
is due to secretion of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP).
Tumors that secrete VIP are known as VIPomas. VIPomas account for
<10% of islet cell tumors and mainly occur as solitary tumors. More than 60%
are malignant and metastasize to the lymph nodes, liver, kidneys, and bone.

Clinical presentation
The most prominent symptom in most patients is profuse watery diarrhea
that is secretory in nature and therefore rich in electrolytes (Box 83.1).
Other causes of secretory diarrhea should be considered in the differential diagnosis (see Box 83.2).
VIPomas are rare in MEN1 patients, occurring in <1% of cases.

CHAPTER 83

VIPomas

Biochemical investigations
Elevated levels of plasma VIP are found in all patients with the VIPoma
syndrome, although false positives may occur in dehydrated patients due
to diarrhea from other causes.
A gut hormone proﬁle may identify other raised tumor markers such as
pancreatic polypeptide and aid detection of some other causes of watery
diarrhea, e.g., gastrinomas.
Urinary catecholamine excretion should be assessed, especially in children, in whom it is common to ﬁnd the tumors residing in the adrenal
medulla.

Tumor localization
The majority of tumors secreting VIP originate in the pancreas, whereas
others arise from the sympathetic chain.
Primary VIPomas have very rarely been reported to arise from a variety of other sites, such as the lung, esophagus, small bowel, colon, and
kidney.
Most patients present with large tumors that can be easily identiﬁed by
transabdominal US or CT, although small tumors may require additional
methods of tumor localization as previously discussed (b p. 473).

Treatment
Severe cases require IV ﬂuid replacement and careful correction of electrolye disturbances.
Surgery to remove the tumor is the treatment of ﬁrst choice if technically possible and may be curative in around 40% of patients. Surgical
debulking may also be of palliative beneﬁt.
Somatostatin analogs produce effective symptomatic relief from
the diarrhea in most patients. Long-term use does not result in tumor
regression.
Glucocorticoids in high dosage have also been shown to provide good
relief of symptoms. A trial of lithium may be warranted in resistant cases
and this therapy may be combined with octreotide.
Chemotherapy using streptozotocin in combination with 5-FU has
resulted in response rates of >30%.
Hepatic artery embolization can offer temporary respite from severe
diarrhea.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Somatostatinomas

Deﬁnition
Somatostatinomas are very rare neuroendocrine tumors occurring both
in the pancreas and in the duodenum. More than 60% are large tumors
located in the head or body of the pancreas.
The clinical syndrome may be diagnosed late in the course of the
disease when metastatic spread to local lymph nodes and the liver has
already occurred.

Clinical features
See Box 84.1.
Glucose intolerance or frank diabetes mellitus may have been observed
for many years prior to the diagnosis and retrospectively often represents
the ﬁrst clinical sign. It is probably due to the inhibitory effect of somatostatin on insulin secretion.
A high incidence of gallstones has been described similar to that seen as
a side effect with long-term somatostatin analog therapy.
Diarrhea, steatorrhea, and weight loss appear to be consistent clinical
features and may be associated with inhibition of the exocrine pancreas
by somatostatin.
Small duodenal somatostatinomas may occur in association with NF1
(43%). Although these rarely cause the inhibitory clinical syndrome, they
present with obstructive biliary disease through local spread of the tumor.
Somatostatinomas are infrequently associated with MEN1 (7%).

484

CHAPTER 84

Somatostatinomas

Biochemical investigations
Plasma somatostatin levels will be raised and may also be associated with
raised levels of other neuroendocrine tumor markers, including ACTH
and calcitonin.
Multisecretory activity is more common with pancreatic (33%) than with
duodenal (16%) somatostatinomas.

Tumor localization
Transabdominal US and CT scanning may demonstrate the tumor, since
metastatic disease is often apparent at presentation.
Additional methods of tumor localization as previously described may
also be required (b see p. 473)

Treatment
Surgery should be considered ﬁrst-line treatment. Although a cure is rare,
even debulking surgery may result in signiﬁcant palliation.
Hepatic embolization can be considered and chemotherapy with streptozotocin and 5-FU may be used to control malignant disease.

McCune–Albright syndrome

McCune–Albright syndrome

Deﬁnition
The syndrome is characterized by the following:
• Polyostotic ﬁbrous dysplasia
• Café-au-lait pigmented skin lesions
• Autonomous function of multiple endocrine glands
A clinical diagnosis requires two of these pathologies.

Genetics
This syndrome is a genetic but not an inherited condition due to a postzygotic somatic mutation in the gene (GNAS1) that encodes the A-chain of
the stimulating G protein of adenyl cyclase (GSA mutation). This results in
activation of adenyl cyclase.
The somatic mutation results in mosaicism. Consequently, the proportion and distribution of affected cells in a tissue will be determined by the
precise stage in development at which the mutation occurred.
Mutational analysis of the GNAS1 gene from affected tissues or blood
may be available.

CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical features
Polyostotic ﬁbrous dysplasia
Solitary or multiple expansile bony lesions that can cause fracture deformities and nerve entrapment typically develop before the age of 10 years.
The femoral and the pelvic bones are most frequently affected.
Radiographs of these bones are useful for screening. Osteosarcomas are
a rare complication.
For treatment, b see Box 85.1.

Box 85.1 Treatment of polyostotic ﬁbrous dysplasia
• Surgery may be complicated by bleeding, and radiotherapy has a
limited effect.
• There is recent evidence to support the use of bisphosphonates,
particularly pamidronate, for both symptomatic pain relief and the
radiological healing of bone.

Café-au-lait pigmentation
The lesions are characterized by an irregular border (in neuroﬁbromatosis
the border is smooth), do not cross the midline, and tend to be ipsilateral
to the bone lesions.

Endocrinopathies
See Table 85.1.

Involvement of other organs
Hepatobiliary complications such as neonatal jaundice, elevated transaminases, and cholestasis are relatively common.
Cardiomegaly, tachyarrythmias, and sudden cardiac death may occur.
Gastrointestinal polyps, splenic hyperplasia, and pancreatitis are reported
complications. Recognized CNS associations include microcephaly, failure
to thrive, and developmental delay.

DEFINITION

Neuroﬁbromatosis

Deﬁnition
Neuroﬁbromatosis type 1 (NF1) is also known as von Recklinghausen disease and refers to the occurrence of multiple neuroﬁbromas, café-au-lait
spots, and Lisch nodules affecting the iris.
Endocrinopathies are sometimes associated with NF1. The prevalence
of NF1 is estimated to be 1 in 3500 of the population.
NF type 2 (NF2) is characterized by the presence of bilateral acoustic
neuromas typically resulting in deafness. Other features of NF2 include
posterior subcapsular cataracts, retinal gliomas, pigmented retinopathy,
and gaze palsies.
NF2 has no common associated endocrinopathies. NF2 is rare with an
estimated frequency of 1 in 40,000 live births.

489

490

CHAPTER 86

Neuroﬁbromatosis

NF1
Genetics
NF1 is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant condition.
The NF1 gene is located on chromosome 17 and encodes a GTPaseactivating protein (neuroﬁbromin).
Neuroﬁbromin promotes cleavage of GTP to GDP.

Epidemiology
The incidence of NF1 is 1 per 3000 of the population. NF1 is nearly 100%
penetrant but shows variable clinical expression.
Approximately 50% of cases are sporadic.

Clinical features
Diagnosis is generally apparent by the age of 1 year. The café-au-lait spots
become visible shortly after birth (95%), and 70% have axillary or grain
freckling.
The multiple cutaneous and subcutaneous neuroﬁbromas appear
around puberty (95%). Lisch nodules affecting the iris start to appear typically after the age of 5 years (95%).
The endocrine features are detailed in Box 86.1.
Learning disabilities occur in 60% of patients with NF1.

Box 86.1 Endocrine features of NF1
Puberty and pregnancy
• Both are associated with a change in size of neuroﬁbromas.
Hypothalamus and pituitary
• Optic gliomas impinge on adjacent tissues and may affect
hypothalamic and/or pituitary function.
Pheochromocytoma 0.1–5.0%
• Serious complication of NF1
• Uncommon before age 20 years
• Most commonly adrenal (20% bilateral) but extra adrenal lesions are
reported
Gut neuroendocrine tumors
• Found in around 1% of NF1 patients—carcinoid

Gliomas may be found in around 15% of patients, most commonly affecting
the optic pathways. Neuroﬁbrosarcomas complicate around 6% of cases.
Skeletal dysplasias (e.g. sphenoid wing dysplasia, scoliosis, tibial pseudoarthrosis, pectus excavatum) may be found in up to 5% of cases.
Vascuar dysplasia may occur, the most common region affected being
the renal vasculature, resulting in renovascular hypertension in up to 3%
of cases.

NF1

Macrocephaly (16%), seizures (5%), and short stature (6%) are all
reported features of NF1.
Associated pheochromocytomas are seen in <5% of NF1 patients.

The condition occurs in approximately 1 in 36,000 live births. The average
age of presentation is 27 years, and the condition is nearly 100% penetrant
by the age of 65 years.
VHL may be subdivided into type 1 and type 2 disease.

GENETICS

• Type 1 VHL is the commonest form of the disease and is characterized
by a tendency to develop tumors in the eyes, brain, spinal cord, kidney,
and pancreas
• Affected family members with VHL type 2 are also susceptible to
developing pheochromocytomas. This may be further subdivided into
VHL type 2A (develop phecochromocytomas and renal cell carcinomas).

Genetics
VHL is a highly penetrant, autosomal dominant condition. The VHL gene
is on chromosome 3 and is a tumor suppressor gene.
Genetic testing in affected families is recommended from the age of
5 years.

493

494

CHAPTER 87

Von Hippel–Lindau disease

Clinical features
Retinal angiomas are the initial manifestation of VHL in 40% of patients.
They are uncommon before the age of 10 years but continue to develop
throughout life. They tend to be peripheral in the retina, appearing as red,
oval lesions. Bleeding and retinal detachment may occur, and treatment is
with laser therapy.
Seventy-ﬁve percent of hemangioblastomas occur in the cerebellum.
They are the initial presenting feature in 40% of VHL patients. Treatment
is with surgery or radiotherapy.
Renal carcinoma is the most common cause of death in VHL patients.
By the age of 60 years, 70% of VHL patients will be affected, with a mean
age of presentation of 44 years. The lesions tend to be multifocal. The
management of choice is surgical resection.
Pheochromocytomas occur in up to 20% of VHL families and are bilateral in 40% of cases. The frequency of this condition varies widely among
families, as certain mutations are particularly associated with a high risk
of pheochromocytoma. Regular biochemical screening is essential in
these high-risk families. Treatment is with A- and B-blockade followed
by surgical resection.
Most pancreatic tumors associated with VHL are nonfunctioning, but
they may secrete VIP, insulin, glucagons, or calcitonin. They occur in
10–20% of VHL patients and should be treated expectantly unless symptomatic, enlarging, or >2–3 cm.

Prognosis
Until recently, the median survival for a VHL patient was 40–50 years of
age with the majority of deaths attributable to renal cell carcinoma.
Currently, the prognosis for individual patients depends on the location
and complications of the tumors but overall is improving as a result of
the institution of screening programs and consequent earlier therapeutic
interventions.

Incidence
This syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 200,000 individuals.

Genetics
• Autosomal dominant condition
• Inactivating mutations in the PTEN tumor suppressor gene can be
identiﬁed in approximately 80% of affected probands.

Clinical presentation
Also b see Box 89.1.
The condition is characterized by multiple hamartomas involving organ
systems derived from all three germ cell layers. Patients are also at risk for
breast, thyroid, and endometrial carcinomas.
Thyroid pathology occurs in > 2/3 of patients, and the lesions may be
multifocal.

POEMS syndrome

POEMS syndrome

Deﬁnition
Progressive polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal
gammopathy, and skin changes (POEMS) is a rare disorder of unclear
pathogenesis that is probably mediated by i production of λ light chains
from abnormal plasma cells.

Clinical presentation
• Progressive polyneuropathy
• Organomegaly, especially hepatosplenomegaly and lymphadenopathy
• Common endocrinopathies (84%) (multiple in 65%) include
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (70%—2/3 central, 1/3 primary),
hypothyroidism (60%), hypoadrenalism (60%), and diabetes mellitus
(50%) hyperprolactinemia (20%).
• Monoclonal gammopathy
• Skin changes

Treatment
Treatments include chemotherapy, irradiation, and surgery.

CLINICAL FEATURES

MEN type 1

Deﬁnition
Characterized by
• Parathyroid tumors/hyperplasia
• Anterior pituitary adenomas
• Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
A clinical diagnosis of MEN1 is reached in the presence of two out of
three of these tumors or one of these tumors in the context of a family
history of MEN1.
The prevalence of MEN1 has been estimated at 1 in 10,000 of the
population.

Genetics
MEN1 is an autosomal dominant condition with an estimated penetrance
of 98% by the age of 40 years.
The MEN1 gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 11 (11q13)
and is a tumor suppressor gene, although the function of the encoded
protein, MENIN, is unknown.
The mutations causing MEN1 are inactivating mutations. Many mutations in the MEN1 gene have been described in affected families. There is
no clear genotype–phenotype correlation.
Mutational analysis is available in the US, although it is important to
note that up to 10% of MEN1 patients will not have mutations identiﬁable
within the coding region of the MEN1 gene.

Clinical features
Primary hyperparathyroidism is the most common presenting feature in
MEN1 and occurs in up to 95% of patients with MEN1.
Pituitary adenomas are found in approximately 30% of MEN1 patients
(b see Table 91.1).
The incidence of pancreatic endocrine tumors varies between 30% and
80% in different series (b see Table 91.2).
Other lesions are also associated with MEN1 (b see Table 91.3).

MUTATIONAL ANALYSIS

Management
Primary hyperparathyroidism
The hypercalcemia is frequently mild with an early age of onset and is the
ﬁrst manifestation of the disease in 90% of patients.
Multiple gland disease (adenomas or hyperplasia) is common, in contrast with sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism, where usually a single
adenoma is found.
No effective medical treatments are currently available and surgical
management is the gold standard. In view of the potential for multigland
disease, total parathyroidectomy with lifelong oral calcitriol replacement
should always be considered.
The timing of surgery in asymptomatic patients with borderline hypercalcemia is still controversial.

Pituitary adenomas
These are managed with surgery, medical therapies, or radiotherapy as per
sporadic pituitary tumors (b see p. 87).

Pancreatic tumors
An experienced surgeon is essential to resection of these tumors.
For patients with aggressive disease, the pancreas and duodenum
together with surrounding lymph nodes may be removed, whereas simple
enucleation may be sufﬁcient for some lesions.
Gastrinomas are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in MEN1
patients and these may respond to medical therapy with proton pump
inhibitors.

Mutational analysis
The criteria for performing mutational analysis are controversial. One
approach is to recommend assessing the following categories of patient:
• Patients with 2 MEN1 tumors
• First- and second-degree relatives of patients with MEN1
• Consider screening in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism <40
years of age, particularly in the presence of multigland disease.
• Consider screening in patients with isolated pancreatic neuroendocrine
tumors, especially gastrinomas or insulinomas.

CHAPTER 91

MEN type 1

Screening
Screening is relevant for affected patients, asymptomatic mutation carriers, and ﬁrst- and second-degree relatives in families with a clinical
diagnosis of MEN1 but where a mutation has not been identiﬁed.
Manifestations of MEN1 are very rare before the teenage years but have
been described in patients as young as 5 years. Careful parental counseling
can encourage some childhood monitoring, which should include a careful
history for symptoms (e.g., hypoglycaemia) and height and weight assessment in addition to calcium and prolactin measurements.
Screening involves a careful clinical history and examination as well as
biochemical assessment and imaging modalities (b see Table 91.4).
Age-related penetrance is as follows: age 10–7%, age 20–52%, age 30–87%,
age 40–98%, age 60–100%.

GENETICS

MEN type 2

Deﬁnition
MEN2 may be divided into three forms (see Table 92.1):
• MEN2a comprises familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC) in
combination with pheochromocytoma and parathyroid tumors.
• MEN2b is deﬁned as the occurrence of familial MTC in association
with pheochromocytoma, mucosal neuromas, and a marfanoid habitus.
• FMTC may also occur in isolation.
MEN2a accounts for >75% of all MEN2 cases.

Genetics
MEN2 is an autosomal dominant condition. The C-RET protooncogene,
mutations in which cause MEN2, is located on the long arm of chromosome 10 (10q11.2).
This gene encodes RET, which is a transmembrane receptor with an
extracellular cysteine-rich domain and an intracellular tyrosine kinase
domain.
The mutations causing MEN2 are activating mutations.
Different germline mutations cause different clinical syndromes,
so in contrast to MEN1, MEN2 shows a strong genotype–phenotype
correlation.
The C-RET proto-oncogene is also involved, via inactivating mutations,
in the etiology of Hirschsprung’s disease.

503

504

CHAPTER 92

MEN type 2

Clinical features—MEN2a
Medulllary thyroid cancer (MTC)
MTC is often the initial manifestation and is generally multifocal.
Pheochromocytoma and parathyroid disease typically develop later.
Diagnosis of MTC requires histological analysis that reveals C-cell
hyperplasia and stromal amyloid. Circulating calcitonin levels are generally
elevated (see Box 92.1), but hypocalcemia is not seen.
With metastatic disease, diarrhea is common (30%).
Rarely, these tumors secrete ACTH, resulting in Cushing’s syndrome
due to ectopic ACTH secretion.

Box 92.1 Pentagastrin test
• Indication borderline basal calcitonin and screening of families with
medullary carcinoma (calcitonin slightly raised with thyroiditis)
• Patient fasting
• 0.5 mcg/kg pentagastrin IV over 5 seconds and ﬂush cannula
• Calcitonin measured at 0, 2, and 10 minutes
• Elevated basal levels of calcitonin, which do not rise with
pentagastrin stimulation, are seen in children, pregnancy, with some
tumors (e.g., carcinoids), pernicious anemia, thyroiditis, and chronic
renal failure.
• Side effects of the test include nausea, ﬂushing, and substernal
tightness, which typically resolves in <5 minutes.

• These lesions must be excluded prior to surgery for any other

• Generally results from hyperplasia of the glands
• Hypercalcemia is typically mild.

MANAGEMENT

Clinical features—MEN2b
Mucosal neuromas can be found on the distal tongue, conjunctiva, and
throughout the gastrointestinal tract.
A marfanoid habitus is typically evident.
MTC tends to present earlier than in MEN2a and frequently follows a
more aggressive course.

Management
MTC
The deﬁnitive treatment is adequate surgery by total thyroidectomy and
careful lymph node dissection. Postoperative levothyroxine is administered to all patients.
Tumor spread is usually local but distant metastases do occur.
Regular postoperative calcitonin assessment (ﬁrst 3 months, then
every 6–12 months) is used to monitor for disease recurrence.
MRI, octreotide scanning, and venous catheterization may all be helpful
in staging disease recurrence.
Treatment of recurrent disease responds poorly to radiotherapy or
chemotherapy and consequently is generally surgical if appropriate.
Somatostatin analogs may help symptom control, e.g., diarrhea, but do
not appear to have an antitumor effect.
Few data are available to date, but therapy with radiolabeled MIBG or
somatostatin analogs appears to offer signiﬁcant symptomatic improvement, although tumor stabilization and/or regression was observed only
rarely.
Children with MEN2 should be considered for early prophylactic surgery. This should generally be performed before the age of 5 years, and
before the age of 1 year in patients with the highest risk mutations.

Pheochromocytoma
These tumors are best treated medically with A- and B-blockade followed
by surgical removal.
The risk of multifocal and/or recurrent disease must be considered.
Screening has resulted in earlier detection of these lesions.

Primary hyperparathyroidism
The criteria for diagnosis and the indications for surgery are broadly similar to those for sporadic primary hyperparathyroidism.

505

506

CHAPTER 92

MEN type 2

Mutational analysis
Mutational analysis is indicated for ﬁrst- and second-degree relatives of
patients with MEN2 and genetic analysis should be performed as early as
possible in at-risk children.
Consider screening in patients with sporadic MTC or sporadic pheochromocytoma or in patients with mucosal neuromas or other phenotypic
features compatible with MEN2b.
Somatic RET oncogene mutations confer a worse prognosis in sporadic
medullary carcinoma.

Screening
Biochemical and radiological screening is relevant for affected patients,
asymptomatic mutation carriers, and ﬁrst- and second-degree relatives in
families with a clinical diagnosis of MEN2 but where a mutation has not
been identiﬁed (b see Table 92.2).

Causes
•
•
•
•

MEN1
MEN2a
Hyperparathyroidism–jaw tumor syndrome (HPT-JT)
Familial isolated hyperparathyroidism (FIHP)

HPT-JT
This is an autosomal dominant condition. It is characterized by pathology
in three main tissues:
• Parathyroid tumors, which show a high penetrance in these patients
and in up to 15% of cases will be parathyroid carcinomas
• Ossifying ﬁbromas, which affect the maxilla and/or mandible in around
30% of HPT-JT patients
Renal manifestations may also occur, the most common being bilateral renal
cysts (19% of patients) but also including hamartomas and Wilms’ tumors.
Benign and malignant uterine pathology is seen in up to 75% of women
with HPT-JT and reduces reproductive ﬁtness.
Other tumors have also been reported in these patients, including
pancreatic adenocarcinomas, testicular mixed germ-cell tumors, Hürthle
cell thyroid adenomas, and benign and malignant uterine tumors.
The gene (HRPT2) in activating mutations that are responsible for
HPT-JT has been identiﬁed on the long arm of chromosome 1. Mutational
analysis is available in the US.
The function of the protein product (paraﬁbromin) encoded by this
tumor suppressor gene is unknown.

507

508

CHAPTER 93

Inherited primary hyperparathyroidism

FIHP
Affected individuals within a kindred suffer only from primary hyperparathyroidism as an isolated endocrinopathy.
In some kindreds, mutations in the MEN1 or HRPT2 genes have been
identiﬁed, but in the majority the cause is still unknown.

DEFINITIONS

Inherited renal calculi

Deﬁnitions
Renal calculi affect 12% of men and 5% of women by the seventh decade
of life. Renal calculi arise due to a reduced urine volume or i excretion of
stone-forming components such as calcium, oxalate, urate, cystine, xanthine,
and phosphate.
A variety of causes for renal stones are established (b see Box 94.1
for general causes of nephrolithiasis), but the most common etiology is
hypercalciuria.
Calcium stones account for >80% of all renal calculi. Uric acid stones
comprise 5–10% of all renal calculi.
The most common cause of hypercalciuria is hypercalcemia. This in turn
is most frequently secondary to primary hyperparathyroidism.
Nephrolithiasis is frequently a recurrent condition with a relapse rate
of 75% in 20 years.
Features associated with recurrence include early age of onset, positive family history, and lithiasis related to infection or underlying medical conditions.

CHAPTER 94

Inherited renal calculi

Genetics
Renal calculi generally arise from complex multifactorial disease resulting from an interaction between genetic and environmental factors. The
disorder may be familial in up to 45% of patients.
The majority of causative genes are probably as yet unidentiﬁed and
account for much of “idiopathic” calcium nephrolithiasis.
Many cases of hypercalciuria are likely to be polygenic, but two examples of monogenic causes are Dent’s disease and autosomal dominant
hypocalcemic hypercalciuria (ADHH).

Box 94.2 Mutational analysis
• Currently largely a research tool
• Mutations in a variety of genes have been reported to result in
renal calculi due to hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, cystinuria, or
hyperuricosuria.
• As these research tests move into the clinical domain, family
screening will become increasingly relevant.

Dent’s disease
• X-linked condition
• Due to inactivating mutations in a chloride channel (CLC5) gene
• Characterized by hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, B2 microglobinuria,
progressive glomerular disease, and mild rickets due to renal phosphate
loss in affected males

ADHH
• Autosomal dominant condition
• Due to activating mutations in the calcium-sensing receptor gene
• May be asymptomatic or present early with neonatal or childhood seizures

Investigation of renal calculi
• 24-hour urine volume and urine osmolarity (low urine volume raises
production of solutes)
• 24-hour urinary calcium excretion
• Urine pH
• Stone composition, if possible
• Exclude causes of hypercalcemia (hyperparathyroidism, immobilization,
or renal tubular acidosis)
• Exclude hypercalciuria (excess chloride, excess sodium, malignancy,
sarcoidosis, renal calcium leak, and drugs, e.g., levothyroxine or loop
diuretics)
• Exclude causes of hyperoxaluria (primary hyperoxaluria, vitamin B6
deﬁciency, short bowel syndrome, and excess dietary oxalates)
• Exclude urinary tract infection
• Exclude causes of hyperuricosuria (gout, dietary, uricosuric drugs,
binge drinking, or myeloproliferative disorders)

MANAGEMENT

• Exclude causes of hypocitraturia—citrate is the primary agent for removal
of excess calcium (renal tubular acidosis, potassium or magnesium
deﬁciency, urinary tract infection, renal failure, and chronic diarrhea)
• Exclude cysteine (usually genetic in origin) or xanthine (usually
secondary to allopurinol treatment) stones

Management
• Increase ﬂuid intake.
• Appropriate dietary modiﬁcations
• Treat underlying cause.

CHAPTER 95

Hypoglycemia

Hypoglycemia
Deﬁnition (Whipple’s triad)
• Plasma glucose of <50 mg/dL associated with
• Symptoms of neuro-glycopenia and
• Reversal of symptoms with correction of glucose levels.
For causes, see Box 95.1.

Box 95.1 Causes of hypoglycemia
• Spontaneous hypoglycemia
• Drug induced (the most common cause; both accidental and nonaccidental)
• Antidiabetic agents used either alone (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas,
prandial glucose regulators) or in combination (e.g., insulin and
thiazolidinediones)
• Alcohol (impairs hepatic gluconeogenesis and is often associated
with poor glycogen stores)
• Quinine can promote hyperinsulinemia.
• Salicylates can act by inhibiting hepatic glucose release and
increase insulin secretion.
• Organ failure and critical illness
• Acute liver failure
• Chronic renal failure
• Hormone deﬁciency
• Addison’s disease
• Isolated ACTH deﬁciency
• GH deﬁciency
• Hypopituitarism
• Insulinoma
• Benign 85%, malignant 15%
• Occasionally part of MEN1 (~10%)
• Other tumors
• Excessive IGF-2 secretion from large mesenchymal tumors
(non–islet cell tumor hypoglycemia [NICH]), e.g., ﬁbrosarcoma,
mesothelioma (~ 1/3 are retroperitoneal, 1/3 intra-abdominal, and
1/3 intra-thoracic)
• Hepatocellular carcinoma
• Adrenal carcinoma, pheochromocytoma
• Lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia
• Advanced metastatic malignancy

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Box 95.1 (Contd.)
• Infection
• Septicemia, e.g., gram-negative or meningococcal; related to high
metabolic requirements, reduced energy intake, and possibly
cytokines from the inﬂammatory process
• Malaria
• Starvation or malnutrition
• Anorexia nervosa
• Kwashiorkor or marasmus
• B-cell hyperplasia: very rare in adults
• Autoimmune
• Antibodies to insulin (antibody-bound insulin dissociates leading
to elevated free insulin; typically associated with postprandial
hypoglycemia)
• Insulin receptor activating antibodies (rare, most common in
middle-aged women; may require treatment with plasmapheresis or
immunosuppression)
• Inborn errors of metabolism
• Glycogen storage disease
• Hereditary fructose intolerance
• Maple syrup disease
• Hypoglycemias of infancy and childhood
• Reactive (postprandial) hypoglycemia: b see p. 520

Epidemiology
Hypoglycemia is uncommon in adults, apart from patients with diabetes
being treated with certain agents either alone or in combination (e.g., insulin, sulfonylureas, prandial glucose regulators, thiazolidinediones).

CHAPTER 95

Hypoglycemia

Pathophysiology
Physiology of glucose control
The liver is the major regulator (80–85%) of circulating blood glucose levels in healthy individuals and responds to changes in circulating insulin,
growth hormone (GH), cortisol, glucagon, and adrenaline.
• Postprandial state: Hepatic glucose production is inhibited by both
raised glucose and insulin concentrations.
• Fasting state: Serum glucose falls with a consequent decrease in insulin
secretion, stimulating hepatic efﬂux of glucose (in the presence of
cortisol, GH, and glucagon).
The brain is dependent on circulating glucose for its energy demands,
which are high and comprise up to 50% hepatic glucose output.

Mechanisms of hypoglycemia
• Excessive or inappropriate action of insulin or IGF-1: inhibiting hepatic
glucose production despite adequate glycogen stores, while peripheral
glucose uptake is enhanced
• Impaired neuroendocrine response, with inadequate counterregulatory
response (e.g., cortisol or GH) to insulin
• Impairment of hepatic glucose production, due to either structural
damage or abnormal liver enzymes

Types of spontaneous hypoglycemia
• Fasting hypoglycemia occurs several hours (typically >5 hours) after
food intake (e.g., early morning, following prolonged fasting or
exercise) and almost always indicates underlying disease.
• Postprandial (reactive) hypoglycemia occurs 2–5 hours after food intake
( b see Post-prandial reactive hypoglycemia, p. 520).

Symptoms of hypoglycemia
• Autonomic (adrenergic) symptoms: sweats, pallor, tachycardia, tremor,
hunger, anxiety
• Neuroglycopenic symptoms: poor concentration, drowsiness, double
vision, irritability, perioral tingling, poor judgment, confusion, violent
behavior, personality change, unexplained collapse, focal neurological
signs, seizures, loss of consciousness, and death

CLINICAL FEATURES

Clinical features
Responses to hypoglycemia are sequential with the following:
• Deterioration in neuropsychological performance at plasma glucose
50–60 mg/dL
• Subjective perception of hypoglycemia at 50 mg/dL
• EEG changes at 35 mg/dL
Patients with recurrent hypoglycemia may not get symptoms until glucose concentrations are very low (so-called hypo-unawareness), whereas
patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus may experience hypoglycemic symptoms at “normal” blood glucose levels.
Most symptoms of acute hypoglycemia are adrenergic, but neuroglycopenic symptoms occur with subacute and chronic hypoglycemia.

Investigation of fasting hypoglycemia
• Glucose strip: unreliable for low-glucose concentrations. If the level is
<70 mg/dL, a laboratory glucose should be measured.
• Liver and renal function tests
• Fasting insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, and glucose during hypoglycemia
(Table 95.1)
• Inappropriately elevated insulin in the presence of hypoglycemia
suggests insulinoma or self-administration of insulin or sulfonylurea.
• Presence of C-peptide indicates endogenous insulin release—either
insulinoma or sulfonylurea.
• Insulinomas are often associated with elevated pro-insulin/insulin ratio.
• Consider an assay for presence of sulfonylureas.
• Ethanol concentration
• Cortisol (± cosyntropyn stimulation test)
• Fasting B-hydroxybutyrate (elevated in most causes of hypoglycemia,
but suppressed if insulin is present, e.g., insulinoma, self-administration
of insulin or sulfonylureas)
• Consider IGF-1 and 2: IGF-2 may be normal in NICH, but this is in
association with suppressed IGF-1 and GH; the usual IGF-2/IGF-1 ratio
is 3:1, ratio >10 is seen in NICH ( b see Box 95.2).
• Chest and abdominal radiographs/CT—?NICH source
• Consider insulin and insulin receptor antibodies.

CHAPTER 95

Hypoglycemia

Box 95.2 Non-islet cell tumor hypoglycemia (NICH)
Excess secretion of abnormal IGF-2 (i IGF-2) from tumors such as ﬁbrosarcomas and mesotheliomas leads to hypoglycemia associated with
the following:
• Suppressed insulin, C-peptide, and IGF-1
• Low GH
• Low B-hydroxybutyrate levels
• Autonomous IGFBP-2 secretion by tumors leads to suppression of
GH secretion and reduced IGF-1 and IGFBPs and a high IGF-2/IGF-1
ratio.
• IGF-2 is usually IGFBP bound, which maintains it within the
circulation.
• IGF-2 may therefore remain “free” in the circulation, with i tissue
bioavailability, leading both to suppression of IGF-1 and GH and to
hypoglycemia due to binding and stimulation of insulin receptors.
Deﬁnitive treatment is removal of the tumor.
High-dose glucocorticoids are the most effective medical therapy.
Therapy with GH replacement stimulates an increase in binding proteins (IGFBP-3) and IGF-1 and a reversal of hypoglycemia.

Further investigation of fasting hypoglycemia
Glucose and insulin
After a 15-hour fast, glucose <40 mg/dL and insulin >5 mU/L is inappropriate. This a good screening test if repeated 3 times.
72-hour fast
This is the most reliable test for hypoglycemia (detects 98% patients with
insulinoma, compared with 71% at 24 hours).
The patient should remain active. Plasma glucose, insulin, C-peptide,
and pro-insulin are measured q6h (unless the patient is symptomatic or
the glucose level is <60 mg/dL when measurements are made every 1–2
hours). The test is terminated if the laboratory glucose is <40 mg/dL or
after 72 hours. B-hydroxybutyrate should be measured at the end of the
fast (its presence makes insulinoma unlikely).
Exercise test
This is used to precipitate hypoglycemia in patients with endogenous
hyperinsulinism who might tolerate prolonged periods of fasting.
Blood is collected before and at 10-minute intervals during 30 minutes
of intense exercise and for 30 minutes afterward.
Patients with spontaneous hypoglycemia become exhausted and their
glucose concentration falls below 40 mg/dL.
Localization of tumor
b See Tumor localization (p. 473). This is only performed once an insulinoma is conﬁrmed biochemically. MRI or spiral CT are usually ﬁrst-line
investigations (equal sensitivity 50–70%); endoscopic and intraoperative
US have an improved resolution and sensitivity but are more invasive.

MANAGEMENT
111
I Octreotide scan
This has 50% sensitivity and may detect metastases. It is less good for
insulinomas than for other pancreatic tumors.

Selective angiography
Angiography with selective arterial calcium gluconate or secretin stimulation (rarely required) is done in centers with experienced radiologists,
when biochemically proven insulinomas cannot be visualized on imaging.

Management
Acute hypoglycemia
If the patient is conscious, oral carbohydrate (ideally food and a sugary
drink) should be administered as soon possible. A glucose-containing gel,
which is absorbed by the buccal mucosa, may be used in drowsy, but
conscious, individuals.
If the patient is unconscious, administer 25–50 mL 25% glucose IV into a
large vein, followed by a saline ﬂush, as the high concentration of glucose
is an irritant and may even lead to venous thrombosis. A maintenance
infusion of 5% or 10% dextrose is often required thereafter, especially
if there is an ongoing risk of recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g., overdose of a
long-acting insulin/analog).
A dose of 1 mg glucagon IM may be administered if there is no IV access.
This increases hepatic glucose efﬂux, but the effect only lasts for 30 minutes, allowing other means of blood glucose elevation (e.g., oral), before
the blood glucose falls again. It is
• Ineffective with hepatic dysfunction and if there is glycogen depletion,
e.g., ethanol-related hypoglycemia.
• Relatively contraindicated in patients with known insulinoma, as it may
induce further insulin secretion.
• Ineffective within 3 days following a previous dose of glucagon.
Secondary cerebral edema may complicate hypoglycemia and should be
considered in cases of prolonged coma despite normalization of plasma
glucose. Mannitol and/or dexamethasone may be helpful.

Recurrent chronic hypoglycemia
If deﬁnitive treatment of the underlying condition is unsuccessful or
impossible, symptoms may be alleviated by frequent (e.g., q4h) small
meals, including overnight.
Diazoxide, administered by mouth, is useful in the management of
patients with chronic hypoglycemia from excess endogenous insulin secretion due to an insulinoma or islet cell hyperplasia.

CHAPTER 95

Hypoglycemia

Postprandial reactive
hypoglycemia (PRH)
Deﬁnition
PRH is hypoglycemia following a meal due to an imbalance between glucose inﬂux into (exogenous from food, and endogenous glucose production) and glucose efﬂux out of the circulation.

Pathophysiology and causes
• Exaggerated insulin response related to rapid glucose absorption, e.g.,
post-gastrectomy dumping syndrome. This results in a delayed insulin
peak with respect to the peak blood glucose, probably related to an
exaggerated GLP-1 (glucagons-like peptide 1) response.
• Incipient diabetes mellitus occasionally presents with postprandial
hypoglycemia, possibly related to disordered insulin secretion.
• Insulin resistance related hyperinsulinemia, e.g., obese subjects with or
without impaired glucose tolerance
• Increased insulin sensitivity with deﬁciency of counterregulatory
hormones, glucagon, and adrenaline (rapid action), as well as cortisol
and GH (delayed action, up to 12 hours)
• Impaired glucagon sensitivity and secretion in response to hypoglycemia
are involved in the pathogenesis of PRH.
• Renal glycosuria accounts for up to 15% of patients with PRH.
Body composition
• 20% of very lean people are prone to PRH.
• Massive weight reduction increases the risk of PRH.
• Lower-body obesity (especially in women) is associated with highnormal insulin sensitivity and PRH.
Diet
• High-carbohydrate, low-fat diet, by i insulin sensitivity
• Prolonged very low–calorie diets (>2 weeks), by reducing
counterregulatory hormones, especially GH.
Alcohol
• Inhibits hepatic glucose output
• Increases insulin secretion in response to glucose and sucrose
There are also idiopathic causes of PRH.

Investigation
Prolonged oral glucose tolerance test is not physiological; 10% of the normal
(asymptomatic) population has a positive response with blood glucose
levels <47 mg/dL.
The mixed-meal test is more physiological; 47% of patients with suspected PRH have a positive test vs.1% of asymptomatic subjects.
Ambulatory glucose sampling is gaining favor, as it may correlate symptoms with low sugar readings, and improvement of symptoms with recovery from hypoglycemia.

POSTPRANDIAL REACTIVE HYPOGLYCEMIA (PRH)

Management
Diet
• Frequent, small, low-carbohydrate, high-protein meals
• Avoid rapidly absorbed carbohydrates
• Avoid sugary drinks, especially in combination with alcohol
• Addition of soluble dietary ﬁbers, e.g., 5–10 g guar gum, or pectin, or
hemicellulose per meal, delays absorption and lowers the glycemic and
insulinemic indices (especially effective in rapid gut transit time).
Drugs
• Acarbose, an intestinal A-glucosidase inhibitor, delays sugar and starch
absorption, thus reducing the insulin response to a meal.
• Metformin 500 mg can be useful with meals.
• Supplemental chromium is reported to down-regulate B-cell activity
and increase glucagon secretion.
• In exceptional cases, with debilitating PRH, diazoxide (side effects are
water retention, hypertrichosis, digestive disorders), or somatostatin
analogs may be required.
• Propranolol and calcium antagonists have been used; however,
controlled studies are lacking.

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Obesity

Deﬁnition
Obesity is deﬁned as an excess of body fat (adiposity) sufﬁcient to adversely
affect health. In the almanac of direct measurements of body fat mass, body
mass index (BMI) is a commonly used surrogate marker (see Box 96.1).
• Obesity is often deﬁned in terms of BMI.
• BMI does not take body build or fat distribution into consideration,
and thus can be misleading in the presence of large muscle mass.
• Lower cutoff values may be applicable to non-Caucasian ethnic groups.
• Fat distribution: central (abdominal) obesity (“apple shape”) vs.
gluteofemoral obesity (“pear shape”).
• Apple-shaped people have an i cardiovascular risk compared to that
of pear-shaped people.
• Adverse consequences of central obesity may reﬂect i visceral (intraabdominal fat) stores, (blood draining into the portal vein may expose
the liver directly to the efﬂuent from visceral fat).
Assess fat distribution using waist circumference (see Boxes 96.2 and 96.3).

Box 96.2 Waist circumference
Suggested indicators of central obesity (and i cardiovascular risk):
Waist circumference
• Men >40 in (102 cm)
• Women >35 in (88 cm)
Another study suggested a waist circumference of <100 cm makes insulin resistance unlikely (irrespective of sex).
Waist circumference cutoffs should be adjusted for individuals of certain racial and ethnic backgrounds.

Box 96.3 Measurement of waist circumference
Measurements should be recorded over underwear or light clothing.
The subject should stand with their arms by their sides.
The position of the waist is midway between the lower rib margin
and the iliac crest.
1. Identify the bony landmarks in the mid-axillary line.
a. The lower rib margin (bottom of the rib cage)
b. The iliac crest (highest bony part of the pelvis)
2. Measure the vertical distance between them. Note the midpoint.
3. Ask the subject to stand with their feet 23–30 cm apart.
4. Ensure that the tape measure is at the same level around the body at
the midpoint. Gently tighten the tape measure so that it is taut but
not too tight.
5. Ask the subject to breathe normally and record the measurement at
the end of normal expiration.
6. Record waist circumference.

Epidemiology
There has been a rapid increase in obesity in both the developed and
developing worlds.
In the United States, the prevalence of obesity has increased—in 1980,
12% of men and 16% of women were obese. By 2004, the ﬁgures had
increased to 31% and 33%, respectively. Now, 2/3 of the population is
either overweight or obese.
Prevalence in children has also increased rapidly (17% of adolescents in
2004) with an attendant risk of type 2 diabetes.
In some ethnic populations, prevalence of overweight is >75%.
Prevalence varies with age (peak prevalence at 50–70 years) and socioeconomic class.

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Etiology
Genetic factors
Monogenic
This is rare.
• Leptin deﬁciency or resistance (massive obesity and hyperphagia in
early childhood) (see Box 96.4)
• Prader–Willi syndrome (obesity, learning difﬁculties, chromosome 15)
• Lawrence–Moon–Biedl syndrome (obesity, polydactyly, learning
difﬁculties, retinitis pigmentosa)
• Melanocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) deﬁciency (obesity, hyperphagia,
dominant inheritance (see Box 96.5)

Box 96.4 Leptin

•
•

First hormone described to be secreted from adipose tissue
Encoded by Lep gene (chromosome 7q31.3)
Synthesized in and secreted by adipose tissue
Affects the hypothalamus to decrease food intake and increase
energy expenditure (by sympathetic activation)
Primary role in humans may be to indicate nutritional depletion
or fasting and for falling leptin levels to indicate insufﬁcient energy
reserves for growth and reproduction
Exerts potent anti-obesity effects in animals such as the ob/ob (leptin
deﬁcient) mouse
Leptin therapy beneﬁts humans with congenital leptin deﬁciency and
leptin-deﬁcient partial lipodystrophy.
Most obese humans do not have abnormalities of the leptin gene.
Plasma leptin i in obese humans, and obese humans appear to be
leptin resistant. Reduced leptin transport to the brain has been
suggested as a potential mechanism of leptin resistance in humans.
Trials in humans with polygenic obesity are equivocal (high doses
of SC leptin lead to more weight loss than placebo, but longterm consequences of supraphysiological doses are unknown;
sympathetic activation for weight loss by other agents has unwanted
side effects).
Loss of function mutations in the leptin receptor gene is associated
with hyperphagia and early-onset obesity; serum leptin levels do not
predict leptin receptor mutations.
Leptin is stimulated by glucocorticoids.

ETIOLOGY

Box 96.5 Melanocortin peptides
• Melanocortin peptides are derived by cleavage from proopiomelanocortin (POMC).
• Mutations result in ACTH deﬁciency, obesity, and pale skin (and no
hair in Caucasians).
• Mutations in the receptor (MC4R) are the most common mongenic
causes of obesity found—1% of adults with BMI >30 kg/m2 and 5–6%
of overly obese children under the age of 10.
• MC4R mutations are dominantly inherited.

Polygenic
Estimates of heritability range from 40 to 80%, thus genetic factors play a
major role in obesity.

Environmental factors
Excess energy intake or d energy expenditure due to physical inactivity are
major determinants of obesity in genetically susceptible individuals.

Secondary causes
These include Cushing’s disease or syndrome, hypothyroidism, and
hypothalamic lesions (i appetite).

525

526

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Pathophysiology
There is complex regulation of appetite and energy expenditure that is
still not fully understood. Understanding has not yet been translated into
therapeutic modalities (perhaps reﬂecting that long-term attempts to
change one pathway leads to compensatory changes in other pathways).
Long-term signals associated with body-fat stores are provided by leptin
and insulin. These circulating molecules also modulate short-term signals
that determine meal initiation and termination.
Short-term information about hunger and satiety is provided by gut hormones, such as cholecystokinin, ghrelin (Box 96.6), and peptide YY3–36
(PYY), and signals from vagal afferent neurons within the GI tract that
respond to mechanical deformation, macronutrient balance, pH, tonicity,
and hormones.
Neural and humoral signals from speciﬁc regions of the hypothalamus,
brain stem, and neural networks are involved in regulation of energy
homeostasis and are regulated by peripheral signals such as leptin, which
regulates neuropeptides and neurotransmitters expressed in these brain
areas.
In fat vs. carbohydrates, overall, there is close regulation of metabolism
and storage of carbohydrates, but not of fat.
In terms of weight homeostasis, overeating increases both fat-free mass
(FFM) and fat mass (~1 kg FFM gain for ~2 kg fat gain). FFM is the major
determinant of resting energy expenditure.

Box 96.6 Ghrelin
• Plasma concentrations inversely proportional to degree of obesity
• Peptide (28 amino acids) from oxyntic cells in the stomach fundus
• Acts on GH secretagogue receptors to increase release of GH from
the pituitary
• Also important in energy homeostasis
• Appears to regulate pre-meal hunger and meal initiation
• Circulating ghrelin concentrations increase preprandially and
decrease postprandially.
• Ghrelin increases food intake through the stimulation of ghrelin
receptors on hypothalamic neuropeptide Y–expressing neurons and
agouti-related protein-expressing neurons (b see Box 96.7).
• Patients with Prader–Willi syndrome have disproportionately
elevated levels of ghrelin, although the relevance of this ﬁnding is
unclear.

CONSEQUENCES OF OBESITY

Box 96.7 Neuropeptide Y (NPY)
• Synthesized in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and
transported axonally to the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus
• A potent appetite stimulant and reduces sympathetic output, thus
reducing energy expenditure
• i By insulin and glucocorticoids, and d by leptin and estrogen
• Genetic studies have not shown any association between the genes
for NPY or its receptor in human obesity.

Consequences of obesity
Increased body fat is associated with i morbidity and mortality, but the
causal link is unclear. For example, low cardiorespiratory ﬁtness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular disease, irrespective of body fat.
Standardized mortality rates rise sharply at BMI of 30 kg/m2.
Diseases associated with obesity include the following:
• Type 2 diabetes (BMI >40 in <55-year-old leads to i risk 18-fold in
men, 13-fold in women)
• Hypertension (BMI 25–29.9 leads to i risk 1.6-fold; BMI >40 leads to i
risk 5.5-fold)
• Dyslipidemia (moderate relationship with total cholesterol, closer
relationship with i triglycerides, d HDL cholesterol)
• Cardiovascular disease (BMI >29 leads to i risk 4-fold)
• Gall bladder disease (men, BMI >40 leads to i risk 21-fold; women,
BMI >40 leads to i risk 5-fold).
• Osteoarthritis, varicose veins, obstructive sleep apnea, some cancers
(e.g., endometrium, breast, ovary, prostate, colon)
However, obesity protects against osteoporosis.

527

528

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Evaluation of an obese patient
• Weight history from birth on (early onset is associated with genetic
syndromes)
• Previous treatment or management strategies and their success
• Current eating habits and activity levels
• Triggers for eating
• Family history of obesity
• Comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, psychological
issues (depression, low self-esteem), osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep
apnea, polycystic ovarian syndrome
• Assess for coexistent cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and
diabetes, family history of cardiovascular disease.
• Look for eruptive xanthomata (hypertriglyceridemia), acanthosis
nigricans (insulin resistance), skin tags (insulin resistance), striae
(Cushing’s syndrome), and fat distribution (Cushing’s, partial
lipodystrophy—probably underdiagnosed).
Consider a secondary cause if there are additional clinical features:
• Hypothyroidism (measure TSH)
• Cushing’s syndrome (measure 24-hour urinary free cortisol and
consider dexamethasone suppression testing)
• Hypothalamic disorder (uncontrolled appetite—MRI)
• Prader–Willi syndrome
• Lawrence–Moon–Biedl syndrome
Consider coexistent conditions, e.g., polycystic ovary syndrome.

Box 96.8 Metabolic syndrome
• A clustering of metabolic risk factors: hyperinsulinemia, impaired
glucose tolerance or frank diabetes, i triglycerides, d HDL
cholesterol, hypertension, and central obesity
• Associated with i risk of vascular disease. Data suggest that
>95% of centrally obese patients have some risk factors; <50% of
subcutaneously obese patients do as well.
Different diagnostic criteria exist. A typical deﬁnition is three of the
following criteria:
• Abdominal obesity (see abdominal circumference cutoff values)
• Raised plasma triglyceride concentrations
• Low plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations
• Raised blood pressure
• Impaired fasting glucose

INVESTIGATIONS

Investigations
Consider the following:
• CBC (polycythemia)
• Electrolytes
• Liver function tests (LFTs) (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, subsequent
cirrhosis)
• Glucose (impaired fasting glucose, diabetes)
• Fasting lipid proﬁle (raised triglycerides, total and LDL-cholesterol,
lowered HDL cholesterol)
• TSH (hypothyroidism)
• Urine dipstick (glycosuria with diabetes, proteinuria with glomerular
hyperﬁltration)
• ECG (coronary vascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy)
• Waist circumference
• Height and weight

529

530

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Management
Weight normalization and maintenance rarely occurs. Even in the best
weight management programs about 10% of weight is lost, but most
people regain 2/3 of the lost weight in a year, and 95% of it is gained in 5
years. A weight loss of 5–10% of the initial body weight reduces the health
risks associated with obesity.
The aims should be modest weight loss maintained for the long term,
with treatment methods and goals being decided for each individual
after careful assessment of the degree of overweight and any associated
comorbid conditions. See Box 96.9.
There is a limited range of treatments available. The ﬁrst-line strategy
for weight loss and its maintenance is a combination of supervised diet,
exercise, and behavior modiﬁcation.

Diet
Diet alone does not usually maintain weight loss, and most dieters regain
weight within 3 years.
Reduce calorie intake to 500 kcal below current intake. Reduce fat
intake—standard dietary advice is to limit fat intake to 20–35% of total
calorie intake. Reduction of fat intake can lead to weight loss, often without a conscious reduction in calorie intake.
Extreme diets may have problems:
Very low–calorie diets (<600–800 kcal/day) are used occasionally for up
to 26 weeks in specialized centers in combination with high-quality proteins (daily intake of 1 g/kg of ideal body weight), electrolytes, vitamins,
and trace elements. These can produce weight loss of ~2 kg/week (more
in the ﬁrst week as glycogen-bound ﬂuid is lost).
Weight is often regained after stopping the diet. Side effects include
fatigue, malaise, and electrolyte disturbances.
Very high–carbohydrate/low-fat diets have been associated with hypertriglyceridemia and lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations.

Box 96.9 Effects of losing weight
• Diabetes: weight loss of 5 kg
• Halves the risk of developing type 2 diabetes
• Improves glycemic control
• Hypertension: weight loss of 1 kg reduces blood pressure by 1–2 mmHg.
• Dyslipidemia: weight loss of 1 kg:
• Lowers LDL cholesterol by 0.77 mg/dL
• Lowers triglycerides by 1.33 mg/dL
• Raises HDL cholesterol by 0.35 mg/dL
• Obesity-related cancers: weight loss of 0.5–9 kg is associated with a
53% reduction in cancer-related deaths.
• Osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea: weight loss has signiﬁcant
mechanical beneﬁts.
• Gallstones: weight loss (or weight gain) can provoke gallstone
formation by altering the cholesterol saturation of bile.

MANAGEMENT

Low-carbohydrate/high-protein diets (>25% of calories as protein) have little or no long-term safety data (especially on renal disease, ischemic heart
disease; diets tend to be high in saturated fat and cholesterol). Side effects
include constipation, renal stones, and i urinary calcium losses.
They can be effective in inducing weight loss. They probably work by i
sense of satiety, leading to a d calorie intake.

Exercise
Exercise is the most effective method of maintenance of weight loss when
combined with calorie restriction and behavioral modiﬁcation. It promotes the preservation of FFM (the major determinant of resting energy
expenditure) in the face of weight loss.
Current recommendations are 20+ minutes exercise 3–5 times/week.
Regular exercise induces cardiorespiratory ﬁtness and leads to a beneﬁcial effect on other risk factors, with a reduction in blood pressure and
improvement in lipid proﬁle.
Interestingly, nonvoluntary activity (“ﬁdgeting”) is a signiﬁcant determinant of resting energy expenditure. Factors controlling nonvoluntary
activity are unclear.

Behavioral interventions
Few relevant data are available, but these should probably include selfmonitoring of behavior and progress, stimulus control, goal setting, slowing rate of eating, social support, problem solving, assertiveness, cognitive
restructuring (modifying thoughts), reinforcement of changes, relapse prevention, and strategies for dealing with weight regain.
A formal psychological assessment of patients with eating disorders (a
minority of obese patients) is helpful.

Drug treatment
This should be used in combination with other treatments (exercise, calorie restriction, behavior modiﬁcation).
It is for the following patients:
• Those at medical risk from obesity (BMI >30kg/m2); or
• Those with BMI >27 with established comorbidities (e.g., diabetes,
heart disease, severe respiratory problems, dyslipidemia).
Use drug treatment only after dietary and lifestyle modiﬁcations have
been unsuccessful (deﬁned as not achieving a 10% weight reduction after
at least 3 months of supervised care).
Not all obese patients respond to drug therapy.
• Stop drug treatment if 5% weight reduction is not achieved.
• If a 5% weight loss is attained, treatment may be continued, provided
body weight is continually monitored and weight is not regained.
• Rapid weight regain is common after short-term use of anti-obesity
drugs (12 weeks or less).
Fat-absorption inhibitors
Orlistat
• Intestinal pancreatic lipase inhibitor; reduces fat absorption

531

532

CHAPTER 96

Obesity

Increases dietary fat loss to 30% (compared to <5% on placebo)
Average weight loss of 5–10%
Licensed for use up to 2 years.
Contraindications: cholestasis, malabsorption syndromes
Drug interactions with warfarin (possible d vitamin K absorption) and
cyclosporine (reduced serum drug levels)
• No data on patients aged >75 years
• Dosing: 60–120 mg with main meals
• Consider vitamin supplementation (especially vitamin D) if there is
concern about fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciency.

•
•
•
•
•

Side effects include ﬂatus (24%), oily rectal discharge, fatty stool (20%),
fecal urgency (22%), fat-soluble vitamin deﬁciency, and incontinence (8%).
Side effects are limited by dietary fat reduction (to <35% of energy).
Appetite-suppressant drugs
Phentermine
• Centrally acting noradrenergic/dopamine release inhibitor
• Decreases food intake
• Average weight loss 5%
• Cautions: hypertension, vascular disease
• Drug interactions: sympathomimetics, MAO inhibitors, other
anorexants
• Side effects: increased BP and HR, insomnia, agitation, dry mouth,
headache, tremor
• Approved for only 3 months use only
• Dosing between 15 and 37.5 mg daily
Other appetite-suppressant drugs, such as fenﬂuramine and dexfenﬂuramine, have been withdrawn because of associations with valvular heart
disease and pulmonary hypertension.

Surgery
Bariatric
• Associated with signiﬁcant weight loss for at least 8 years
• Improves QoL, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperuricemia, and reduces
the incidence of type 2 diabetes
• Data on beneﬁt to BP and cholesterol concentrations unclear
• Jejunoileal bypass and jaw wiring are not recommended.
• Only indicated in severely obese (>100% above ideal weight, BMI >40
or BMI >35 with serious comorbidities) adults (>18 years)
• Failure to lose weight before surgery is not a contraindication.
• Candidates for surgery should be thoroughly assessed with
multidisciplinary assessment (including a biopsychosocial assessment).
• Long-term follow-up is required.
Malabsorptive bariatric surgery:
• Shortening the length of gut so that the amount of food absorbed by
the body is reduced

MANAGEMENT

• Most common procedure now is Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.
Jejunoileleal or biliopancreatic diversions are less common and
associated with dumping syndrome or recurrent hypoglycemia.
Restrictive bariatric surgery:
• Induces early satiety, limits rate of food intake, or both
• E.g., laparoscopic gastric banding (reduction in functional capacity of
stomach by partitioning off part of the body of the stomach)
Liposuction
The beneﬁt of liposuction on metabolic parameters is equivocal.
One study has shown that removal of 10 kg SC abdominal adipose tissue
by liposuction failed to improve parameters such as BP, plasma glucose, and
insulin concentrations.

CHAPTER 97

Endocrinology and aging

Endocrinology and aging

Introduction
Aging causes changes in many hormonal axes. How much of this change
is normal physiology associated with aging and how much represents true
endocrine dysfunction and thus warrants treatment is unclear.
Concomitant disease and polypharmacy are common in the elderly
population, with frequent secondary effects on the endocrine system.

FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE HOMEOSTASIS IN THE ELDERLY

Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in
the elderly
Elderly patients are particularly prone to ﬂuid and electrolyte disturbances due to changes associated with aging, concomitant disease, and
drug usage.
Elderly patients have d renal function compared with that of younger
patients:
• d Glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR) with creatinine clearance d by
8 mL/min/1.73 m2 per decade after age 30
• i Renovascular disease
• d Renal sensitivity to circulating hormones
• Aldosterone
• Vasopressin
• Atrial natriuretic peptide (probable)
• d Ability to dilute or concentrate urine
Elderly patients have d renin levels with secondary decreases of aldosterone levels (both basal and stimulated levels). Aldosterone levels may be
<50% normal by 70 years of age. Increased renal sensitivity to aldosterone
may result in isolated mineralocorticoid deﬁciency (distal renal tubular
acidosis [type 4] with hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, hyperchloremia, and
normal anion gap acidosis); this is more common with diabetes mellitus.

Vasopressin and ADH
Unlike many other hormones, vasopressin (ADH) responses are potentiated in elderly patients with i release from the neurohypophysis in
response to an osmotic stimulus and less effective suppression.
Normal vasopressin release is a balance of inhibitory and stimulatory
effects at baroreceptors and osmoreceptors. It may be that loss of inhibition with aging due to degenerative changes results in relatively unopposed stimulation of ADH and a d ability to suppress ADH release.
In addition, altered renal sensitivity to vasopressin results in d ability to
excrete free water.

Hypernatremia and dehydration
Perception of thirst is altered in elderly persons (in younger people, thirst
is perceived at plasma osmolalities >292 mOsm/kg, whereas in older people, thirst is perceived at plasma osmolalities >296 mOsm/kg). Elderly
patients may also be unable to ingest ﬂuids because of other disabilities
and/or effects of medications.
Thus, elderly persons are particularly susceptible to dehydration (e.g.,
during hot summers).

Hyponatremia
This is particularly common in elderly patients (prevalence of 2–20%). In
hospital patients, overall incidence of hyponatremia (Na <137mmol/L) is
7%, but in geriatric facilities it is 18–22%, with 53% incidence of one or
more episodes of hyponatremia at any time during admission to geriatric
care facilities.

CHAPTER 97

Endocrinology and aging

Mortality rates in hospitalized elderly patients with hyponatremia are
high (in patients aged >65 years, 16% mortality in those with hyponatremia
compared with 8% without hyponatremia).
Hyponatremia is often associated with medication (e.g., diuretics). It is
the most common electrolyte disturbance in cancer (b see SIADH due
to ectopic vasopressin production, p. 550).
Symptoms include confusion, lethargy, coma, and seizures.
The overall approach to investigation and management is similar to that
for hyponatremia in younger patients (b see Hyponatremia, p. 156).
Mild idiopathic hyponatremia is also recognized in elderly patients, without necessarily having a sinister cause or consequence, and is thought to
be secondary to an altered threshold for ADH secretion.

BONE DISEASE

Bone disease
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is not an inevitable part of aging but it is a common disease
in elderly people and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in
both males and females. b See Osteoporosis (p. 405).

Vitamin D deﬁciency and osteomalacia
This is very common in the elderly. Vitamin D insufﬁciency (evidence of
secondary hyperparathyroidism, i bone turnover, BMD loss) occurs at
levels of 25OH-vitamin D <50 nmol/L.
Vitamin D deﬁciency is usually deﬁned at levels <30 nmol/L (with additional problems of myopathy, i sway, d psychomotor function, and frank
osteomalacia).
Vitamin D deﬁciency and/or insufﬁciency is common particularly in elderly institutionalized patients in extreme latitudes and in fracture patients.
In a Danish study, 40% of postmenopausal women had vitamin D levels of
25–50 nmol/L, with a further 7% with frank deﬁciency (<25 nmol/L). 80%
of elderly men and women (aged >65 years) have vitamin D insufﬁciency.
44% of nursing home patients have severe vitamin D deﬁciency (25OH
vitamin D <12 nmol/L). In patients with hip fracture, 75% have vitamin D
insufﬁciency, 25% have vitamin D deﬁciency, and 5% have severe vitamin
D deﬁciency (25OH vitamin D <12.5 nmol/L).
Supplementation with 800 IU vitamin D and 1200 mg calcium daily in institutionalized elderly patients reduces falls and fractures Supplementation in
free-living elderly patients (>65 years of age) also d fracture risk.
Vitamin D is known to have an antitumor effect with d proliferation, i
differentiation of cells, and i apoptosis of malignant cells. Vitamin D may
also boost the immune response with further antitumor effect.
Vitamin D insufﬁciency and/or deﬁciency may contribute to higher rates of
malignancy in elderly patients (e.g., breast, colon, and prostate). Therapeutic
use of vitamin D in malignant disease is limited by hypercalcemia.

Primary hyperparathyroidism
Prevalence of primary hyperparathyroidism is 10/100,000 in women <40
years old, rising to 190/100,000 in women >65 years old. Half of all cases
of primary hyperparathyroidism occur in women >60 years old.
Elderly people are more prone to symptoms (weakness, fatigue, confusion) at relatively mild levels of hypercalcemia (2.8–3.0 mmol/L).
Other causes of hypercalcemia must be excluded.
Coexisting vitamin D insufﬁciency and deﬁciency is common.
Management is similar to that described in b Chapter 68, Hypercalcemia
(p. 376). Surgery is not contraindicated by age alone.

Paget’s disease

CHAPTER 97

Endocrinology and aging

GH and IGF-1 in the elderly
Many of the features of aging resemble growth hormone deﬁciency.
Changes in body composition include d lean body mass (d body water,
d muscle mass, and d bone mass) and i total body fat and visceral fat
mass, associated with abnormal lipid proﬁle (i total and LDL cholesterol,
i TGs), insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease.
Overall, integrated GH concentrations show a decrease with age with d
GH pulse amplitude and duration, but pulse frequency unchanged.
IGF-1 falls with i age (reﬂected in age-adjusted normative ranges). IGFBP3 also falls with age (and is also GH dependent).
Older patients with GH deﬁciency related to pituitary disease are usually easily differentiated from other subjects with age-related decline in
IGF-1 using standard provocative testing (GH response to insulin-induced
hypoglycemia, arginine, or glucagon). Treatment with GH in patients with
clear GH deﬁciency results in i lean body mass and bone mineral density, and d adipose tissue, as well as possibly psychological and functional
improvement.
Small, frequently open-label studies of supraphysiological doses of
GH given to healthy older persons have shown that GH may result in
improved body composition (improved physiological function has not
been observed). Side effects are frequently observed in the treated group
(edema, arthralgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, glucose intolerance) and theoretical concerns of malignancy related to raised IGF-1 levels remain.
GH is not approved for healthy elderly people without clear evidence
of GH deﬁciency.

GONADAL FUNCTION IN THE ELDERLY

Gonadal function in the elderly
Women
The mean age of menopause is 51 years (range 35–58 years) and is deﬁned
retrospectively after 12 months of amenorrhea as the permanent cessation of menstruation due to loss of ovarian follicular activity.
• FSH 10–15 x higher than premenopausal levels
• LH 3–5 x higher
• Estrogen 10% of previous level (often lower than those of men of
similar age)
• Inhibin is often undetectable.
The adrenal gland is the major source of sex steroids postmenopausally,
with estrogen production mainly from aromatization of adrenal androgens
(androstenedione) in adipose tissue.
Low FSH/LH may indicate hypopituitarism, although gonadotropins may
be depressed by serious illness.
b See Chapter 51, Menopause (p. 264) for further discussion.

Men
Men may remain potent and fertile until their death. However, sexual activity, libido, and potency decline gradually and progressively from midlife.
As with GH, there is an overlap between clinical features of hypogonadism and normal aging (loss of lean body mass and muscle function, increase
in fat mass, loss of virility, loss of libido, and d sexual and overall wellbeing). Functional secondary hypogonadism is common in serious chronic
illness, especially when associated with malnutrition and debilitation.
Normal ranges for testosterone in men of different ages have not been
well established.
Free testosterone levels decrease slowly with age, but there is signiﬁcant
intra- and interindividual variation. SHBG increases with age. Testicular
weight, Leydig cell function, and FSH/LH response to GnRH stimulation
all decrease with age.
The extent to which lower testosterone per se and/or a lower free
androgen index explain the age-related decline in sexual function is not
clear. Although testosterone levels may be lower than in younger men,
testosterone levels are still sufﬁcient for normal libido and sexual function. Profoundly low testosterone levels (<230 ng/dL in an A.M. blood
sample) in the appropriate clinical setting should prompt investigation for
hypoandrogenism.
Gonadotropins should be raised in primary testicular failure. Low levels associated with low testosterone should prompt a search for secondary causes, although gonadotropins may be low because of other serious
disease.
Fat body mass increases more than lean body mass with age. Thus
there is i aromatization of androgens to estrogens. The effects of this
are unclear.
Hypoandrogenism may also result from hyperprolactinemia due to
pituitary/hypothalamic disease, renal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, or drugs

539

CHAPTER 97

Endocrinology and aging

(psychotropic and antidopaminergic agents), all more common in the elderly population.
Testosterone therapy
There are a few small studies in elderly men, either as replacement in
patients with clear hypogonadism or in healthy men.
Data point toward a positive effect on well-being, muscle mass, and
strength and in d fat mass in elderly patients, the greatest effect being in
patients with clear hypogonadism.
Risks include secondary polycythemia, liver dysfunction (particularly if
testosterone is taken orally), prostatic hyperplasia, exacerbation of prostate adenocarcinoma, and possibly dyslipidemia.
Erectile dysfunction
This is common in elderly men; 50% of men >60 have erectile dysfunction;
90% of these men have concurrent medical problems or are on medication potentially causing impotence.
Etiology is often multifactorial:
• Atherosclerosis—most common cause with both macro- and
microvascular disease
• Penile denervation—autonomic neuropathy (most commonly due to
diabetes mellitus); pelvic surgery (including prostatectomy—30% of
men >75 develop erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy [cf. 7% of
younger men after prostatectomy])
• Drugs (B-blockers, calcium channel antagonists, other antihypertensive
agents, psychotropic drugs)
• Psychogenic
Delayed or absent ejaculation
Increased incidence is common with age, due to autonomic nerve dysfunction, drugs, previous surgery, and is usually the harbinger of erectile
dysfunction.
Evaluation is similar to that of younger patients (b see Evaluation, p. 308).
Management is similar to that for younger patients, with the caveat that
phosphodiesterase inhibitors may interact with nitrates and antihypertensive agents.
Fertility
Spermatogenesis persists into old age. There are very few data regarding
spermatozoa number, motility, and morphology in elderly men.
However, errors in DNA replication increase with age, as reﬂected in
paternal age effects in some genetic disorders.

ADRENAL FUNCTION IN THE ELDERLY

Adrenal function in the elderly
Cortisol
Overall, cortisol secretion in elderly persons is generally very similar to
that in younger persons.
Dynamic testing shows more prolonged release of ACTH and cortisol
to stress (physiological, insulin-induced hypoglycemia, and/or CRH administration) and slower inhibition of ACTH secretion by cortisol.

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate
DHEA and DHEAS levels peak in humans aged 20–30 years and thereafter
decline with age (20% of peak values in men and 30% of peak values in
women by age 70 years). Responsiveness to ACTH-stimulated secretion
also reduces with age.
The physiological relevance of the fall of DHEA and DHEAS levels with
age is not established.
Replacement in otherwise healthy elderly patients has not consistently
demonstrated improved longevity, well-being, bone density, cognitive
function, body mass composition, or cardiovascular status in double-blind
placebo-controlled trials, despite many Internet claims to the contrary.

Aldosterone
b See Fluid and electrolyte homeostasis in the elderly (p. 535).

542

CHAPTER 97

Endocrinology and aging

Thyroid disease
Thyroid disease is twice as common in the elderly as in younger patients.

Goiter
Diffuse goiter becomes less frequent with age in both men and women
(found in 31% of women aged <45 years compared with 12% of women
aged >75 years on clinical examination).
Multinodular goiter as assessed by both clinical and US examination
increases with age (incidence of US-detected multinodular goiter is 90% of
women >70 years, 60% of men >80 years).
Management is similar to that of multinodular goiter in younger patients
(b see Multinodular goiter and solitary adenomas, p. 44).

Abnormal thyroid function tests
Concomitant disease and polypharmacy are common in the elderly and
may alter the interpretation of results. For example, glucocorticoids (prescribed to 2.5% of the population aged 70–79 years) cause decreased TSH,
d thyroid hormone release, d concentration of thyroid hormone binding
proteins, and d T4-to-T3 conversion.
Sick euthyroid syndrome is more common in the elderly because of
frequent, concurrent nonthyroidal illness, with reduced free tri-iodothyronine (FT3), i reverse free tri-iodothyronine, and (less commonly) reduced
free thyroxine (FT4), along with inappropriately normal or suppressed
TSH levels.

Hypothyroidism
This is the most common thyroid problem in elderly people, affecting
2–7% of elderly people. The male-to-female ratio increases with aging.
The most common causes are autoimmune thyroiditis, previous surgery, or radioiodine therapy.
Only 25% present with classical symptoms of hypothyroidism. An insidious decline in health and mobility is more common than cold intolerance,
hair loss, or skin coarsening.
The elderly are more susceptible to hypothyroid (myxedema) coma
than younger people; it remains rare, however.
Hypothyroidism should be considered in elderly patients with increased
CK or transaminases, d Na, macrocytic anemia, or dyslipidemia.
Thyroid replacement therapy should be done cautiously as ischemic
heart disease may be unmasked or exacerbated, e.g., 12.5–25 mcg/day of
levothyroxine i by 12–25 mcg increments every 3–8 weeks until TSH is
normalized.
Total replacement T4 dosage is lower in the elderly than in younger
patients (in younger patients approximately 1.6 mcg/kg is required but
older patients may require 20–30% less).

Hyperthyroidism
This affects 2% of elderly people. Presentation is often atypical, often with
few signs or symptoms.

THYROID DISEASE

Commonly, symptoms are mainly in a single, vulnerable organ system,
e.g., depression, lethargy, anxiety, confusion and agitation; muscle wasting
and weakness; heart failure, arrhythmias, atrial ﬁbrillation; weight loss; and
osteoporotic fracture.
An isolated suppressed TSH concentration is associated with an i cardiovascular mortality and a 3-fold higher risk of atrial ﬁbrillation in the
next 10 years. From 2 to 24% of elderly patients with atrial ﬁbrillation are
hyperthyroid and 9–35% of elderly patients with hyperthyroidism have
atrial ﬁbrillation.
The underlying cause may be toxic multinodular goiter or Graves’ disease.
Treatment options are similar to those in younger patients ( b see
Treatment p. 21).
Radioactive iodine is favored because it is deﬁnitive and it avoids risks of
surgery. Hypothyroidism is common after radioiodine therapy.

Thyroid cancer
The total incidence rate for all thyroid cancers is unchanged in the elderly,
but the relative frequencies are altered. Papillary carcinoma is more common in young and middle-aged patients, but the prognosis is poorer in the
elderly. Follicular carcinoma is more common with aging.
Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma occurs almost exclusively in patients >65
years. It presents with a rapidly growing hard mass that is often locally
invasive and may be associated with metastatic lesions. The prognosis is
poor.
Sarcomas and primary thyroid lymphomas are more common in elderly
patients.
Overall evaluation and treatment are similar to that of younger patients,
but accurate preoperative histology is very important, as tumors not
treated surgically (e.g., anaplastic carcinoma and lymphoma) are relatively
more common.

Glucose homeostasis
Elderly patients have impaired glucose homeostasis and are more likely to
manifest hyperglycemia in response to acute illness and stress (e.g., post–
myocardial infarction).

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Endocrinology of critical
illness

Endocrine dysfunction and AIDS
Wasting syndrome
Deﬁnition
This is the involuntary loss of >10% of baseline body weight in combination
with diarrhea, weakness, or fever. Wasting is an AIDS-deﬁning condition.
Cause
The cause is unknown but in part reﬂects d calorie intake due to anorexia
associated with secondary infection. Underlying i resting energy expenditure is associated with HIV infection per se. Hypogonadism is common in
men with wasting syndrome.
Treatment
Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)
HAART is associated with overall weight gain, though lean body mass may
remain unchanged.
Nutritionally based strategies
Adequate caloric intake is required to meet metabolic demands. Efﬁcacy
is limited as refeeding generally increases fat body mass with little or less
effect on lean body mass.
Appetite stimulants
Megestrol acetate increases caloric intake and weight compared to placebo, although most of the weight gain is due to i fat mass. Dronabinol
stimulates appetite but weight gain is minimal.
Exercise
Although exercise can increase total and lean body mass in patients with
AIDS, its role in patients with wasting syndrome is not known.
Androgen therapy
In hypogonadal male patients with wasting syn-drome, testosterone
increases overall weight and in particular lean body mass. Both IM and
transdermal testosterone are effective. Testosterone therapy not indicated in eugonadal men with wasting.
Growth hormone therapy
Patients with the wasting syndrome generally have GH resistance, as suggested by high serum GH and low IGF-1 levels. The most likely cause for
this is undernutrition.

ENDOCRINE DYSFUNCTION AND AIDS

High-dose GH has shown improvements in lean body mass and protein
balance in patients with acquired GH deﬁciency or severe catabolic states.
Side effects (peripheral edema, arthralgias, myalgias) are common due
to the high doses required. GH may improve fat redistribution that occurs
with refeeding.
Cytokine modulators
Although many inﬂammatory cytokines are i during acute illness and sepsis,
their speciﬁc role in wasting syndrome is not known. Thalidomide, a potent
inhibitor of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), can increase body weight and
reduce protein catabolism but has a very high rate of serious side effects
and is contraindicated in women of childbearing age due to phocomelia.

Lipodystrophy
Loss of SC fat occurs, particularly in the face, peripheries, and buttocks,
in some cases with concomitant SC fat deposition, particularly in the
abdominal area, neck, dorsocervical area (“buffalo hump”). Visceral fat
deposition also occurs.
Lipodystrophy is associated with dyslipidemia with hypertriglyceridemia,
low HDL cholesterol, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, and (less
commonly) frank diabetes mellitus. There is i cardiovascular mortality
from myocardial infarction.
It is also associated with HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs), used as part
of HAART. 40% of patients treated with PIs will develop lipodystrophy
by 1 year. HIV PI-naive patients have similar body composition and fat
distribution to that of non-HIV-infected men. Indinavir may be less potent
in inducing lipodystrophy than ritonavir and saquinavir.
Abnormal body composition and hypertriglceridemia may be part of the
refeeding phenomenon following improved well-being and loss of anorexia.
Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors may be associated with fat
loss and accumulation as well, but this may be a separate phenome-non
from that seen with PIs.
Management
• Observation in mild cases
• Very low–fat diets and exercise (particular resistance exercise)
• Withdrawal or switching of PIs in some circumstances may be warranted.
• Anabolic agents (testosterone, GH) are not effective.
• Liposuction from areas of fat accumulation; fat pad insertions for areas
of lipoatrophy also used
• Standard lipid-lowering agents for hypertriglyceridemia (e.g.,
gemﬁbrozil)
• HMG CoA reductase inhibitors metabolized by P4503A4 (which is
inhibited by PIs) so risk of myopathy may be i
• The role for thiazolidinediones is unclear.

Adrenal
Adrenal insufﬁciency
This is uncommon (<4% of patients with AIDS). In patients with clinical
signs suggestive of adrenal insufﬁciency (hyponatremia, and hypovolemia),
there is a 30% incidence of inadequate response to Cortrosyn.

545

546

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Causes
Infection
This is histologically common. Adrenal function is usually maintained, since
10% of residual adrenal tissue is adequate for normal function.
• CMV (adrenalitis found postmortem in 40–90% of patients dying of
AIDS)
• Mycobacterium avium intracellulare (MAI) complex, tuberculosis
• Cryptococcus
Neoplasm
• Lymphoma, Kaposi’s sarcoma
Hemorrhage
Drug induced
• Rifampicin induces i hepatic metabolism of corticosteroids. In patients
with already compromised adrenal reserve, this may precipitate an
addisonian crisis.
• Ketoconazole inhibits cortisol synthesis.
• Megestrol acetate possesses glucocorticoid activity and may cause
secondary adrenal insufﬁciency. Abrupt cessation after long-term
treatment may precipitate an adrenal crisis.
Secondary adrenal insufﬁciency
• Drugs (megestrol acetate)
• Hypopituitarism secondary to toxoplasmosis, Cryptococcus, CMV
• Idiopathic anterior pituitary necrosis
Hypercortisolism
Mild hypercortisolemia is common in all stages of HIV infection, without
clinical manifestation of Cushing’s syndrome.
Possible causes
• Chronic stress
• Proinﬂammatory cytokines
• Binding protein dysfunction
• Glucocorticoid resistance

Gonads
Males
Testosterone deﬁciency is common in male patients with AIDS (6% of
patients with asymptomatic HIV infection compared with 50% of patients
with AIDS).
Hypogonadism is associated with wasting, d muscle mass, fatigue, loss
of libido, and impotence. Hypogonadism may be primary or secondary; up
to 75% of patients with hypogonadism have low or inappropriately normal
gonadotropins.

ENDOCRINE DYSFUNCTION AND AIDS

Causes
Primary hypogonadism
• Testicular destruction/inﬁltration: due to infection (CMV most
commonly, MAI, toxoplasma, TB) or neoplasm (lymphoma, Kaposi’s
sarcoma, germ cell tumors)
• Drug induced: ketoconazole (inhibits steroidogenesis causing lowered
testosterone levels); megestrol acetate, other glucocorticoids
Secondary hypogonadism
This is due to malnutrition, severe acute illness, destructive disorders of
pituitary/hypothalamus (CMV, toxoplasmosis, lymphoma), and medications such as megestrol acetate (glucocorticoid-like action causes hypogonadotropic hypogonadism).
Females
Hypogonadism in women as evidenced by oligo- and amenorrhea is less
common than in men unless there is advanced disease. Fertility rates are
not affected until there is advanced disease.
Hypoandrogenism (testosterone, DHEA) is common in women with
wasting syndrome.

Electrolyte disturbance due to endocrine pertubation in
HIV/AIDS
Hyponatremia
This is very common in advanced disease and is due to SIADH in 50%.
Adrenal insufﬁciency also a common cause.
Calcium disorders
Hypocalcemia
• Common (18% of patients with AIDS). Main cause is vitamin D
deﬁciency. Other causes include severe illness; hypomagnesemia;
altered PTH secretion/metabolism; malabsorption of calcium and
vitamin D due to GIT opportunistic infection; and medications
(foscarnet [complexes with calcium], pentamidine [induces renal
magnesium wasting and secondary PTH deﬁciency]).
Hypercalcemia
• Rare. It may relate to lymphoma or granulomatous disease.

Thyroid
Overt thyroid dysfunction is uncommon. The most common thyroid dysfunction is sick euthyroid syndrome (nonthyroidal illness). Increased thyroid-binding globulin is often observed (signiﬁcance is unknown).
Subclinical hypothyroidism may occur during HAART.
Infections
These are rare and are usually postmortem diagnoses. Thyroid function is
usually euthyroid or sick euthyroid.
• Pneumocystis jirovecii (may also cause a thyroiditis)
• Mycobacteria

547

548

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

• Cryptococcus neoformans
• Aspergillosis
Neoplasm
This is rare and is usually euthyroid or sick euthyroid. It may be hypothyroid due to inﬁltrative destruction.
• Kaposi’s sarcoma
• Lymphoma

Pituitary
• Anterior hypopituitarism is very rare.
• Posterior pituitary dysfunction causing diabetes indipidus (DI) is
common.
• Infection, toxoplasmosis, TB
• Neoplasm, cerebral lymphoma

CANCER

Cancer
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have endocrine effects.

Anticancer chemotherapy
There are three types of anticancer chemotherapeutic agents.
Cytotoxics
These have no direct hormonal sequelae. Alkylating agents are more likely
to induce permanent male sterility (without affecting potency) and in
women they may induce premature menopause, which may increase the
likelihood of osteoporosis.
Immunomodulators
Prednisolone in excess causes Cushing’s syndrome, and acute withdrawal
may precipitate adrenal insufﬁciency. Cyclophosphamide in particular may
cause early menopause.
Thyroid dysfunction has been reported rarely with tacrolimus and interferon-A and -B therapy.
Hormones
Progestogens are used in breast cancer. Of these, megestrol acetate has
potent glucocorticoid activity and thus may cause Cushing’s syndrome in
excess or adrenal insufﬁciency if abruptly withdrawn.
Aromatase inhibitors such as aminoglutethimide may cause adrenal insufﬁciency and corticosteroid replacement is necessary.
Trilostane, which inhibits 3B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, may also
cause adrenal insufﬁciency.
Gonadorelin analogs, used for prostatic cancer and breast cancer, cause
an initial increase in LH levels and then suppression and cause side effects
similar to those of orchiectomy in men and menopause in women.
Antiandrogens used in prostatic cancer have predictable side effects such
as gynecomastia, hot ﬂashes, impotence, and impaired libido.

Radiotherapy
Cranial radiotherapy whose ﬁeld encompasses the hypothalamic–pituitary
area may result in hypopituitarism (see Chapter 13, Hypopituitarism,
p. 94).
Head and neck irradiation may result in hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism.
After 5 or more years of follow-up, 50% of patients treated with radiotherapy only for laryngeal and pharyngeal carcinoma will develop hypothyroidism. Combined surgery and radiotherapy results in roughly 90% of
patients developing hypothyroidism. The rates for hypoparathy-roidism
are 88% and 90%, respectively.
Radiotherapy affects the testes dose dependently. Fertility is af-fected
much more than androgensynthesizing capacity, so most men have normal
testosterone levels unless given testicular doses >20–30 Gy.
The effects of radiotherapy to both ovaries are ampliﬁed with age.
Premature menopause may be elicited by doses >10 Gy.

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Syndromes of ectopic hormone
production
Deﬁnition
The secretion into the systemic circulation, of a hormone or other biologically active molecule, by a neoplasm (benign or malignant) that has arisen
from tissue that does not normally produce that hormone or molecule,
results in a clinically signiﬁcant syndrome. See Table 98.1 for common
syndromes associated with ectopic hormone production.

SIADH due to ectopic vasopressin production
Diagnosis
• Hyponatremia (Na <130 mmol/L)
• Dilute plasma (serum osmolality <270 mmol)
• Inappropriately concentrated urine (in the face of hyponatremia and
plasma hypoosmolality, any urine osmolality >plasma osmolality is
inappropriate)
• Persistant renal Na excretion
• Euvolemia (or very mild hypervolemia)
• Normal renal, adrenal, and thyroid function
Plasma urea and uric acid levels can be helpful markers of plasma dilution.
The most common tumors causing SIADH are tumors with neuroendocrine features, most commonly small-cell lung carcinoma and carcinoid
tumors. Small-cell lung carcinomas have usually metastasized by the time
SIADH is present.
Lung diseases and neurological disorders (including malignancies) may
cause SIADH due to aberrant hypothalamic vasopressin release rather
than vasopressin release from the tumor per se. In SIADH due to ectopic
hormone secretion, release of vasopressin from the neurohypophysis may
be suppressed.
Other causes of SIADH must be excluded (b see Syndrome of
inappropriate ADH, p. 159).
Management
Hyponatremia
The initial management is ﬂuid restriction with daily monitoring of the
plasma sodium and osmolality. Hyponatremia has usually developed gradually, and its correction should be similarly gradual. Fluid restriction to 500
mL total ﬂuid intake per day may be needed for several days.
Urate levels can be useful as a marker of water intoxication and its
resolution. As hyponatremia is corrected, ﬂuid restriction can be relaxed
depending on the plasma sodium; 1500–2000 mL/day is usual.
For patients in whom ﬂuid restriction is insufﬁcient or not possible,
demeclocycline (150–300 mg daily) can be used to produce a nephrogenic
diabetes insipidus to achieve a normal plasma sodium. Demeclocyline can
result in photosensitivity,thus patients should be warned to avoid prolonged exposure to sunlight.
Life-threatening hyponatremia (e.g., convulsions) may rarely require hypertonic saline and furosemide. However, rapid correction of hyponatremia may

result in central pontine myelinolysis and in the vast majority of cases, water
restriction is safe, effective, and sufﬁcient.
Management of the underlying tumor
Curative surgery will also cure the SIADH, as will curative chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy may have an
important palliative role, as the tumor is usually incurable by the time
hyponatremia is detected.

Humeral hypercalcemia of malignancy
Hypercalcemia is a common complication of malignancy. It may be due
to ectopic hormone secretion (PTHrP; rarely 1,25(OH)2 cholecalciferol),
cytokine and inﬂammatory mediators that activate osteoclastic bone
resorption (such as IL-6 and RANK-L production by myeloma cells), or
bone destruction by metastases.
Parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP)
PTHrP binds to and activates PTH/PTHrP receptor type 1, resulting in
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption and reduced renal excretion of
calcium.
The biochemical picture of hypercalcemia and hypophosphatemia may
be indistinguishable from that of primary hyperparathyroidism. However,
PTH levels are suppressed in PTHrP-mediated hypercalcemia (primary
hyperparathyroidism can coexist with malignancy).
PTHrP secretion by metastatic cells within bone also causes hypercalcemia by causing local osteolysis.
PTHrP can be measured directly and is elevated in 80% of cancer
patients with hypercalcemia.
Tumors that metastasize to bone are more prone to produce PTHrP
than tumors that do not metastasize to bone (50% of primary breast cancer express PTHrP compared with 92% of metastases of breast cancer
to bone). This may be due to induction of PTHrP secretion by the bone
microenvironment; alternatively PTHrP production by tumor cells may
enhance their ability to metastasize to bone.
b For tumors associated with humoral hypercalcemia see Table 98.1.
Management
This is as per normal management of hypercalcemia (b see Other causes
of hypercalcemia, p. 385).
Glucocorticoids may be particularly effective in treatment of hypercalcemia associated with malignancy. This may be due to direct effects of
glucocorticoids on the tumor cells (e.g., hemopoietic malignancies) and/or
down-regulation of production of 1,25(OH)2 cholecalciferol.
Bisphosphonates may also have antitumor effects in myeloma as well as
control osteoclastic destruction of bone.

Cushing’s syndrome due to ectopic ACTH production
Ectopic ACTH production is responsible for 10–20% of all endogenous
Cushing’s syndrome.
The most common tumor types are those with neuroendocrine features.
Half of ectopic ACTH-secretion is due to small-cell lung carcinoma. Carcinoid

SYNDROMES OF ECTOPIC HORMONE PRODUCTION

tumors are also very common (thymic carcinoid 15%; pancreatic endocrine
tumors including pancreatic carcinoids 10%; bronchial carcinoid 10%).
Diagnosis
Despite often extremely high cortisol levels, patients often do not manifest central weight gain, due to the underlying malignant process with its
rapid progress and associated cachexia.
Hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis are common features (overwhelming of the 11B-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme
resulting in exposure of the mineralocorticoid receptor to high circulating
glucocorticoids).
Glucose intolerance, susceptibility to infection, thin skin, poor wound
healing, and steroid-associated mood disturbance are all common features.
Patients may be pigmented from MSH arising from high POMC levels.
ACTH levels may be extremely high (usually >100 pg/mL).
In 90% of ectopic ACTH-secreting tumors, high-dose dexamethasone
testing (2 mg qds) shows a failure of cortisol levels to drop to 50% of baseline values, due to a lack of any normal physiological feedback on ACTH
production. However, some carcinoid tumors may behave indistinguishably
from pituitary-dependent ACTH production. CRH testing and/or inferior
petrosal sinus sampling may be necessary to distinguish these conditions.
Ectopic ACTH-producing tumors can be extremely difﬁcult to localize
and may require multiple modalities of imaging.
Management
Excision of the underlying tumor may be possible. Other options include
medical management using metyrapone and/or ketoconazole, although
very high doses may be needed.
Bilateral adrenalectomy with glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid
replacement is also an option.
Macronodular adrenal hyperplasia
• A rare cause of ectopic Cushing’s syndrome
• Most commonly due to synthesis of ectopic GIP receptors in adrenal
tissues
• GIP secretion associated with meals results in activation of adrenal
glands and food-related hypercortisolemia.
• Other ectopic receptors reported include B-adrenergic receptors and
LH receptors.

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Liver disease
Sex hormones—males
See Table 98.2.
Hypogonadism occurs in 70–80% of men with chronic liver disease.
There is a combination of primary testicular failure and failure of hypothalamo–pituitary regulation.
Alcohol acts independently to produce hypogonadism, leading to a combination of primary testicular failure and failure of hypothalamic–pituitary
regulation.
The effects of elevated estrogens result in i loss of the male escutcheon, loss of body hair, redistribution of body fat, palmar erythema, spider
nevi, and gynecomastia.
The i conversion of testosterone and androstenedione to estrone is
attributed at least in part to portosystemic shunting. In addition, the large
increase in SHBG concentration will increase the estrogen/testosterone
ratio as testosterone has a higher afﬁnity for SHBG.
Spironolactone may result in iatrogenic feminization by inhibiting testosterone action.
There is no evidence that exogenous administration of androgens
reverses hypogonadism in chronic liver disease.

Sex hormones—females
See Table 98.2.
Alcoholism increases the frequency of menstrual disturbances and spontaneous abortion but does not affect fertility. Liver dysfunction of whatever
etiology is associated with an early menopause.
Alcohol rather than liver disease is the prime cause of hypogonadism. Nonalcoholic liver disease is only associated with hypogonadism in
advanced liver failure when it is accompanied by encephalopathy and
impaired GnRH secretion.

CAH, chronic active hepatitis; PBC: primary biliary cirrhosis.

Plasma testosterone and estrone concentrations are usually normal,
androstenedione concentration is increased, and dehydroepiandros-tenedione and dehydroepiandrostenedione sulfate levels are reduced.

Thyroid
The liver synthesizes albumin, T4-binding prealbumin (TBPA), and T4binding gobulin (TBG), all of which bind thyroid hormones covalently and
reversibly.
Thyroid function tests (TFTs) must be interpreted with caution in
patients with liver disease. In acute liver disease, e.g., acute viral hepatitis,
TBG levels are increased, which increases the measured total circulating
T4 and T3 levels.
In biliary cirrhosis and chronic active hepatitis, TBG may be increased. In
other chronic liver disease and in hepatomas, TBG is also increased.
In severe cases of acute liver disease, TBG may be low due to reduced
synthesis. The liver deiodinates T4 to T3 and this is impaired in liver disease. The T4 is preferentially converted to rT3 and there is an increase in
the rT3/T3 ratio. In liver cirrhosis, TBG, T4, and T3 are low.
Table 98.3 summarizes the changes in TFTs with liver disease. Free T4
and T3 assays are essential for the accurate interpretation of thyroid status
in liver disease.

Adrenal hormones
Patients who abuse alcohol may develop a clinical phenotype of Cushing’s
syndrome with moon faces, centripetal obesity, striae, and muscle wasting,
and may have increased plasma cortisol concentrations. This is termed
pseudo-Cushing’s syndrome.
Reversible (on abstention) adrenocorticorticoid hyperresponsiveness
occurs in alcoholics. In liver disease, cortisol metabolism may be impaired,
leading to elevated plasma cortisol levels, loss of diurnal cortisol variation,
and failure to suppress with dexamethasone.

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Renal disease
Calcitriol
There is impaired renal conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 to 1,25
(OH)2D3 in end-stage renal failure (ESRF) leading to metabolic bone
disease.

Parathyroid hormone and renal osteodystrophy
Serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion is stimulated by low serum
calcium in ESRF. This is due to the following:
• d Renal phosphate clearance (resulting in i cacium/phosphate mineral
ion product, precipitation of vascular calciﬁcation with consequent
hypocalcemia triggering PTH release). Vascular calciﬁcation is a major
contributor to vascular death in ESRF. High phosphate may increase PTH
secretion directly, but evidence of the mechanism for this is lacking.
• Impaired renal calcitriol secretion
As renal function declines, an elevated PTH and a d calcitriol can be
detected with creatinine clearance of 50 mL/min. This rise in PTH is initially sufﬁcient to maintain the serum calcium in the normal range.
In ESRF, patients are markedly hyperphosphatemic and hypocalcemic. The
degree of hyperparathyroidism progresses inversely with the fall in renal
function. Tertiary hyperparathyroidism occurs when PTH secretion becomes
autonomous, and hypercalcemia will persist even after renal transplantation.
Hyperparathyroid bone disease and osteomalacia are the main mechanisms behind the development of high-turnover bone disease in renal
osteodystrophy. Hypogonadism is also common in both men and women
with ESRF. Adynamic bone disease also contributes, probably due to
direct toxic effects from urea and other nitrogenous compounds on bone
cells. Renal osteodystrophy causes bone pain and fractures.
Treatment of renal osteodystrophy
The goals are maintenance of normal phosphate levels with phosphate
binders (such as calcium carbonate) and treatment of osteomalacia. The
i use of calcium carbonate has been suggested as the cause of the i incidence of adynamic renal osteodystrophy, but intensive vitamin D therapy
and peritoneal dialysis are probably also contributory.
Calcitriol (which does not require renal 1A-hydroxylation) is effective in
treating osteomalacia. A dose of 1–2 mcg/day is used for established renal
osteodystrophy. Lower doses of calcitriol (0.25–0.5 mcg/day) are used in
early ESRF to prevent the devel-opment of renal osteodystrophy.
Parathyroidectomy is advocated in bone disease uncon-trolled by vitamin
D therapy or the development of tertiary hyperpara-thyroidism.
Cinacalcet acts directly at the calcium-sensing receptor to lower PTH
secretion. This markedly improves secondary hyperparathy-roidism, calcium and phophate levels, and renal osteodystrophy. Improvement in
mortality due to d vascular calciﬁcation has not yet been demonstrated.

RENAL DISEASE

Prolactin
Hyperprolactinemia is common in ESRF but is usually mild, i.e., <100
mcg/L. The cause is both i secretion and d renal clearance.

Gonadal function
Hypogonadism—clinical and biochemical—is common in ESRF.
In men, there is impaired pulsatile release of LH, although basal LH levels are usually elevated because of impaired renal clearance. Serum FSH is
usually normal or mildly elevated.
In women, levels of estradiol, progesterone, and FSH are reported to
be within the normal range in the early follicular phase but fail to show the
usual cyclical changes. Menstrual disturbance is common. Amenorrhea,
polymenorrhea, and menorrhagia can also occur on dialysis. Infertility is
the rule, and conception on dialysis is the exception.
Sexual dysfunction is common in both sexes but has been better studied
in men. 60% of men have some degree of impotence and examination
yields 80% to have testicular atrophy and 14% to have gynecomastaia.
Treatment of hypogonadism in ESRF is suboptimal. Testosterone therapy is not associated with any clinical beneﬁt in men.

Growth hormone and growth retarda-tion
Basal GH levels are normal, but there is impaired secretion following an
adequate hypoglycemic stimulus in 40–70% of patients with ESRF.
There is impaired growth in children, particularly during periods of
greatest growth velocity, and puberty is delayed. This combination leads
to short stature. The improved growth velocity after renal transplantation
is often too little too late in order to attain a normal stature.
Recombinant human GH (rhGH) has been shown to be an effective
treatment for growth retardation in children with stable chronic kidney
disease (CKD) and ESRF as well as after renal transplantation.

Thyroid
The “euthyroid sick” ﬁnding is common in CKD (b see Sick euthyroid
syndrome, p. 15).

Adrenal
The adrenal axis is not impaired clinically by CKD.
There is evidence of blunted cortisol response to hypoglycemia but this
is not relevant clinically.
Patients with amyloidosis are at risk of hypoadrenalism due to adrenal
amyloid inﬁltration.

CHAPTER 98

Endocrinology of critical illness

Endocrinology in the critically ill
b See Table 98.4.

ACTH and cortisol
CRH, ACTH, and cortisol increase rapidly during all forms of acute illness.
Low albumin and CBG cause free cortisol to be substantially higher. This
physiological adaptation results in the following:
• Provision of substrates for major organ energy expenditure (via
catabolism)
• Hemodynamic advantages (enhanced sensitivity to angiotensin II, i
vaso-pressor and inotropic response to catecholamines
• Prevention of an ex-cessive immune response
Inﬂammatory cytokines result in i cortisol metabolism and reduced
receptors, i.e., peripheral cortisol resistance.
After moderate to severe injuries, plasma cortisol starts to fall af-ter a
day or two but only reach normal levels after a week.

ENDOCRINOLOGY IN THE CRITICALLY ILL

Cortisol is elevated for at least 2 weeks in patients with severe
burns.
Prolonged critical illness results in low CRH and ACTH with a normal
or slightly raised cortisol, perhaps driven by an alternative pathway involving endothelin.
Cortisol deﬁciency should be suspected in an acutely ill patient with a
plasma cortisol of <20 mcg/dL, or an increment of <9 mcg/dL on a 250
mcg cortrosyn test.
Drugs used in intensive care may contribute to adrenal insufﬁciency by
• Reducing cortisol metabolism, e.g., etomidate (frequently used in
induction of anesthesia) and ketoconazole.
• Promoting cortisol metabolism, e.g., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and
rifampicin.

Metabolism
Hyperglycemia is common in critical illness (even in non-diabetic subjects)
due to i cortisol, catecholamines, GH, and glucagon. These hormones and
inﬂammatory cytokines also contribute to insulin resistance.
IV insulin titrated to maintain normoglycemia (glucose <6.1mmol/L)
reduces mortality by >40%.

TSH and thyroid hormones
TSH levels usually remain stable in acute injury. Total T4 and T3 tend to fall
but may remain within the normal range.
Thyroid hormone metabolism is enhanced by increased activity of liver
deiodinase type 3 (peripheral hormone deactivator).
With prolonged illness, the total T4 tends to fall below the normal
range. The FT4 remains in the normal range.
Total and free T3 levels fall after injury and may remain suppressed for
2–3 weeks after a severe injury. The rT3 level rises.
In prolonged critical illness, the thyroid function conforms to the “sick
euthyroid syndrome” (b see Euthyroid sick syndrome, p. 15).

Gonadotropins and gonadal steroids
In prolonged illness hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs.

Growth hormone
In critical illness, the GH axis is profoundly affected with initially raised
GH secretion, but low IGF-1, IGFBPs, and GHBP related to peripheral GH
resistance. Prolonged critical illness >5–7 days results in low GH and a
blunted response to GHRH.
Recombinant GH was proposed as a beneﬁcial agent for critical illness, but the evidence is lacking, and there are reports of a detrimental
effect.

Hormone replacement and critical illness
There is no evidence that, other than insulin, hormonal supplementation
in the critically ill improves outcome.

of endocrine patients

Transsphenoidal surgery/craniotomy
Preoperative assessment
Conﬁrm the following:
• Anterior and posterior pituitary function is normal or on adequate
replacement:
• Cortrosyn stimulation test (CST; note both the 0- and 30-minute
values) and/or normal ACTH/cortisol before 9 A.M. Patients with
recent loss of LFTH will have a normal response to CST, as adrenal
atrophy will not have evolved. If there is in any doubt, replace with
glucocorticoids.
• FT

• LH, FSH, estradiol, or testosterone
• Prolactin
• Serum and urine osmolality and electrolytes if polyuric
• Recent (<3 months) MRI pituitary
• Formal visual ﬁeld perimetry and visual acuity assessment
• Document extraocular muscle movements
• Urea and electrolytes (<1 week presurgery)
• Group and save serum
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) screen should be done
at least 2 weeks prior to admission for surgery if the patient has been in
the hospital within the last year.
Record therapeutic options discussed with patient:
• Risks of surgery (e.g., CSF leakage, meningitis, bleeding, partial or total
hypopituitarism including diabetes insipidus and potential effects on
fertility and visual deterioration)
• Risk of recurrence requiring further surgery or radiotherapy
Warn patients that a sample of fat may be taken from their thigh or abdomen for packing of the pituitary fossa. Reiterate the need for lifelong
follow-up.
Ensure antibiotic prophylaxis is given prior to surgery (the precise
regimen may vary depending on the center and patient. Some surgeons
advocate a prolonged course of antibiotics if CSF leakage occurs, whereas
others recommend close surveillance and prompt treatment if concern
about possible meningitis [lower threshold for patients with Cushing’s
disease]).
MRSA-positive patients require prophylaxis with IV vancomycin.

561

562

CHAPTER 99

Perioperative management

If the patient is steroid-deﬁcient, steroid reserve is unknown, or a
patient has Cushing’s disease (inadequate stress response), give hydrocortisone 20 mg orally with morning premedication.

Postoperative (Table 99.1)
Consider steroid status; if the patient requires steroid coverage:
• Start IV hydrocortisone (HC), 50–100 q6–8h, postoperatively.
• Convert to oral glucocorticoids once patient is eating and drinking.
• After nasal packs are removed (following transsphenoidal surgery),
stop glucocorticoids (usually <48 hours).
• Check 9 A.M. cortisol level the following two mornings, having omitted
the evening dose for the preceding day. Continue off steroids if patient
is asymptomatic, however if symptomatic only omit the evening dose.
In patients with Cushing’s disease, 9 A.M. cortisol (x2) <1.8 mcg/dL indicates cure; occasionally, cortisol takes a few days to fall to undetectable
levels.
See Table 99.1 for patients without Cushing’s disease.
If the patient is acutely unwell with postural BP drop when hydrocortisone is stopped, check random cortisol and restart HC without delay.
Fluid balance—watch for diabetes insipidus:
• Review the clinical status of the patient at regular intervals
(euvolemic, hypovolemic, hypervolemic).
• Record ﬂuid input and output assiduously (ﬂuid replacement in surgery
may be excessive, therefore always include perioperative ﬂuids in ﬂuid
balance charts and note sodium content).
• Check plasma electrolytes and plasma and urine osmolalities on a
regular basis (at least once daily and more frequently if there are
clinical concerns).
• Postoperatively, restrict to 2 L total ﬂuid input (IV and PO).
• Record ﬂuid input and output assiduously.

*In female patients who have stopped estrogen replacement therapy <6 weeks before surgery,
interpret results with caution (potential confounding effect of raised CBG levels).

TRANSSPHENOIDAL SURGERY/CRANIOTOMY

• If the patient becomes polyuric, i.e., >200 mL/h for 3 consecutive
hours (in the context of a 2 L/24-hour ﬂuid restriction), urgently check
plasma electrolytes, plasma and urine osmolalities, and urinary sodium.
While waiting for results allow free ﬂuids; the aim is to replace the
ﬂuid deﬁcit. (Fluid replacement in surgery may be excessive, always
include perioperative ﬂuids in ﬂuid balance sheets.)
• If diabetes insipidus is conﬁrmed by the results, give a single dose of
desamino-D-arginine vasopressin (desmopressin) (1 mcg SC).
• When the ﬂuid deﬁcit has been replaced (usually orally), restart 2–3 L
ﬂuid restriction (again include IV and PO routes).
• If polyuria recurs, treat as before.
• Regular plasma electrolytes and plasma and urine osmolalities are
required.
• If polyuria continues to recur up to and after 96 hours postoperatively,
consider regular DDAVP orally or intranasally, if possible (not if a
transsphenoidal approach is used).
Hyponatremia occurring 1 week after a transsphenoidal adenectomy is
most commonly due to SIADH; rarely, cerebral salt wasting may occur.
Check urinary sodium and assess ﬂuid status (cerebral salt wasting causes
very high urinary sodium and is associated with dehydration).
Check thyroid function (FT4) between days 5 and 7 postoperatively.
Check for CSF leakage.
Recheck visual acuity and visual ﬁeld perimetry and eye movements
formally prior to discharge.

563

564

CHAPTER 99

Perioperative management

Thyroidectomy
Preoperative
Ensure euthyroidism.
If surgery is required in the presence of hyperthyroidism, give potassium
iodide (60 mg 3x a day for 10 days); this reduces thyroid hormone release
and probably decreases perioperative blood loss. The radiographic contrast agent iopanoic acid, which is rich in iodine, provides a useful alternative, and has the additional beneﬁt of potently inhibiting the 5-deiodinase,
thus reducing T4 to T3 conversion.
Oral propranolol (30–120 mg 3x a day) reduces clinical manifestations
of thyrotoxicosis.
Check vocal cord function by indirect laryngoscopy.
Warn of postoperative risks: recurrent laryngeal nerve damage <1%,
keloid scarring, hemorrhage, permanent hypoparathyroidism <0.5%, and
hypothyroidism (10% of partial thyroidectomy patients).

Postoperative
There is a risk of hemorrhage in ﬁrst 24 hours, particularly major hemorrhage deep to the strap muscles, leading to airway compression. Watch for
stridor, respiratory difﬁculties, and wound swelling. Drainage from wound
drains is unhelpful. Treat by evacuating the hematoma, and consider intubation or a tracheostomy. Clip removers and artery forceps should be
kept to hand on the ward.
Recurrent laryngeal nerve damage is permanent in <1% and transient in
2–4%. The patient’s voice is often husky for about 3 weeks postoperatively
and may be treated with lozenges and humidiﬁed air.
Symptomatic unilateral damage can be treated by stabilization of the
affected cord in adduction by submucosal Teﬂon® injection under direct
laryngoscopy.
Bilateral damage leads to unopposed adductor action of the cricothyroid
muscle, which causes glottis closure and airway obstruction. Treatment
involves reintubation, paralysis, hydrocortisone (100 mg 4x a day IM for
edema), and extubation at 24 hours. If that fails, a tracheostomy should
be performed.
If recurrent laryngeal nerve damage is persistent at 9 months, an attempt
can be made to resuture the nerve.
Monitor calcium. Transient hypoparathyroidism is usually evident within
7 days. b See Hypoparathyroidism (p. 394) for treatment.
Following total thyroidectomy for malignancy, thyroid hormone withdrawal may be necessary prior to postoperative radioiodine ablation
(b see Follow-up of papillary and follicular thyroid carcinoma, p. 76).
Alternatively, recombinant TSH can be used.
If total thyroidectomy is performed for hyperthyroidism, levothyroxine
(~1.5 mcg/kg) should be started 4–5 days postoperatively, as during the
operation, handling of the thyroid results in release of stored thyroid hormones and levothyroxine has a long t½. Check TSH in 6–8 weeks.
Following partial thyroidectomy, transient biochemical hypothyroidism
may occur during the ﬁrst 2 months and does not warrant treatment
unless the patient is symptomatic or it becomes persistent.

PARATHYROIDECTOMY

Parathyroidectomy
Parathyroidectomy of one or two glands undertaken for primary hyperparathyrodism may result in transient and self-limited hypocalcemia.
Total parathyroidectomy (e.g., for MEN1 or as part of surgical management of advanced head and neck malignancy) may be complicated
by severe and permanent hypocalcemia, which may be very difﬁcult to
manage.

Postoperative care for patients undergoing
parathyroidectomy of 1–2 glands
Check calcium, phosphate, magnesium, and albumin on the evening of
surgery and daily thereafter. Calcium begins to fall postoperatively after
about 4–12 hours; the nadir is usually reached by 24 hours. Calcium may
recover spontaneously, however 1/3 of patients will require calcium support perioperatively.
With the advent of minimally invasive parathryoidectomy and short hospital stays (<24 hours) many centers advocate prophylactic calcium and
vitamin D replacement in all cases in the immediate aftermath of surgery.
This treatment is continued until the patient is reviewed 1–2 weeks later
in the outpatient clinic.
Symptoms of hypocalcemia (mainly due to neuromuscular irritability)
include perioral parasthesias, Chovstek’s sign, Trousseau’s sign, tetany,
laryngospasm, bronchospasm, seizures, prolonged QT interval on ECG,
extrapyramidal movement disorders, and delirium. Calcium levels are
often <7.0 mg/dL before symptoms manifest, although rapid changes in
calcium result in more pronounced symptomatology.
Magnesium deﬁciency is common due to previous hyperparathyroidism
(causes renal wasting of magnesium). Chronic magnesium deﬁciency
impairs release of PTH and causes functional hypoparathyroidism and
hypocalcemia.
Causes of hypocalcemia after 1–2 gland removal
Functional hypoparathyroidism
This is common. Causes include delayed recovery of the other parathyroid
glands due to long-term suppression, parathyroid gland ischemia, parathyroid gland “stunning” by intraoperative handling, and hypomagnesemia.
The PTH level will be detectable; phosphate should be normal. It usually
improves spontaneously over days to weeks.
Management of symptomatic hypocalcemia (Ca usually <7.2 mg/dL) is with
calcium (up to 2 g/day in divided doses). Add in vitamin D and vitamin D
metabolites for persistent hypocalcemia. Replace magnesium as necessary.
Gradual withdrawal of therapy is needed to assess recovery.
Hungry bone syndrome
This is due to extensive skeletal remineralization once the skeleton is
released from PTH excess. There is ongoing i alkaline phosphatase (ALP),
d calcium, d PO4, and d Mg. PTH levels may be normal or high. Preexisting vitamin D deﬁciency will exacerbate hypocalcemia.
The patient may require large doses of calcium and vitamin D and
vitamin D metabolites for weeks to months.

565

566

CHAPTER 99

Perioperative management

Permanent hypoparathyroidism.
This is rare (<2% of cases). Check PTH level after day 3; the level will be
undetectable (<1 pg/mL). Replace with oral calcium and vitamin D and
vitamin D metabolites long term.
Other complications
• Recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy (<1%)
• Failure to correct hypercalcemia
Overall, both minimally invasive and conventional parathyroidectomy are
very safe operations with low morbidity and mortality.

Calcium management following total parathyroidectomy
Hypocalcemia is inevitable unless management is instituted.
Preemptive treatment is worth considering (e.g., calcitriol 1–2 mcg/
day—this dose may be insufﬁcient to completely prevent hypocalcemia
but may prevent life-threatening hypocalcemia and is unlikely to cause
serious toxicity in the short term).
Acute management is required in patients with life-threatening hypocalcemia (e.g., Trousseau’s sign, laryngospasm, seizures):
• 10 mL of 10% calcium gluconate diluted 1 in 10 in normal saline or
dextrose 5% infused into a large vein over 10 minutes. Monitor cardiac
rhythm.
• Repeat as necessary to control acute emergency.
• Patients will need ongoing calcium replacement: 100 mL of 10%
calcium gluconate in 1 L of 5% dextrose or 0.9% sodium chloride
infused over 24 hours (monitor calcium regularly (q4–6h) and adjust
rate as necessary.
• Start oral vitamin D analogs and oral calcium.
Vitamin D analogs (calcitriol)
These are potent and effective in acute hypocalcemia because of the rapid
correction of calcium. The short half-lives allow rapid and careful titration
of a dose in response to calcium levels. There is a narrow therapeutic
window (hypercalcemia is much shorter-lived if it develops).
Reassess often (at least every 1–2 days) in the early stages of management. Longer-term options include ergocalciferol or colecalciferol, but
hypercalcemia will be more prolonged if it develops.
Calcium
Give 1–2 g/daily in divided doses. A maximum daily absorbable dose of
calcium is probably 3 g/day.
Absorption may vary from different types of calcium salts and may be
greater when calcium is given away from food.
The long-term aim is to manage without calcium just on vitamin D or
vitamin D metabolites.
The long-term goal of management is to prevent symptoms of hypocalcemia without toxicity. Aim for the lower half of normal range (8.0–
9.2 mg/dL) with normal urinary calcium excretion (to minimize risk of
nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis.

PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

Pheochromocytoma
Preoperative
Check for bilateral disease or metastases: MRI chest and abdomen and an
MIBG scan (10% multiple).
Ensure adequate A- and B-blockade once the diagnosis is made. Start
A-blockade before B-blockade (unopposed B-blockade can lead to marked
vasoconstriction, ischemic damage, and hypertension).
• A-blockade: Start phenoxybenzamine (10–20 mg, orally, 3–4x day),
an irreversible A-blocker. Adequacy of dosage can be assessed
by monitoring hematocrit and postural drop in BP (reﬂects BP
vasodilation).
• Start treatment at least 1 week, ideally >3 weeks, before surgery.
• B-blockade: Start propranolol (20–80 mg, orally, 3x day) at least 48
hours after initiating phenoxybenzamine.
To control BP, A- and B-blockers are often sufﬁcient. If not, add a calcium
channel blocker or ACE inhibitor; A-methyltyrosine 1–4 g/day (a false catecholamine precursor that inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase, the rate-limiting
step for catecholamine synthesis) is rarely used to control BP.
Some centers advocate the use of additional IV phenoxybenzamine
(0.5–1.0 mg/kg in 250 mL 5% dextrose given over 2 hours) for the 3 days
prior to surgery (titrate the dose according to BP; often 0.5 mg/kg is
sufﬁcient).
Group and save serum, and cross-match 2 units of blood.
Ensure that the patient is well hydrated (if necessary, use an IV infusion
of saline) prior to going to surgery.

Postoperative
Watch for d BP: sudden withdrawal of catecholamines leads to marked
arterial and venous dilatation. This is worsened by inadequate volume
loading and should initially be treated with volume replacement rather
than by pressor agents.
If hypertension persists 2 weeks postoperatively, residual tumor or
metastases must be considered.
Long-term monitoring is required as approximately 14% recur.
If bilateral adrenalectomy is performed, see the next section.

Bilateral adrenalectomy
Give hydrocortisone (100 mg, 4x day, IM) postoperatively. This will provide adequate mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid coverage. Continue
this until the patient is eating and drinking (often <48 hours). Monitor
electrolytes.
From day 3, give hydrocortisone PO (double usual replacement dose,
e.g., 20 mg/10 mg/10 mg) and add ﬂudrocortisone PO (100 mcg daily).
Long-term replacement is with hydrocortisone 10/5/5 and ﬂudrocortisone 50–150 mcg daily.

CHAPTER 99

Perioperative management

Pheochromocytoma in pregnancy (see p. 364)
This is a rare condition. It may present as paradoxical supine hypertension,
with pressure from the gravid uterus causing release of catecholamines,
and normal blood pressure in the supine and erect positions.
Start A-blockade then B-blockade, phenoxybenzamine can cross the
placenta but is generally safe for the fetus (may cause perinatal CNS
depression and transient hypotension).
Surgery is more controversial, although some authors advocate surgery
in the ﬁrst and second trimesters up to 24 weeks’ gestation.
Caesarian section is advocated with a combined tumor resection.
Vaginal delivery carries a signiﬁcant maternal risk.

GLUCOCORTICOID RESISTANCE

Syndromes of hormone
resistance
Deﬁnition
In these syndromes there is reduced responsiveness of target organs to
a particular hormone, usually secondary to a disorder of the receptor or
distal signaling pathways. This leads to alterations in feedback loops and
elevated circulating hormone levels.

Thyroid hormone resistance
b see Resistance to thyroid hormones (p. 37).

Androgen resistance
b see Androgen insensitivity syndrome (p. 335).

Glucocorticoid resistance
Autosomal dominant and recessive forms have been described.
Diminished sensitivity to glucocorticoid leads to reduced glucocorticoid
feedback on CRH and ACTH, leading to i CRH, ACTH, and cortisol
concentrations.
The clinical features are not due to excess glucocorticoid, as there is
reduced peripheral tissue sensitivity. However, elevated ACTH leads to
i secretion of mineralocorticoid (e.g., deoxycorticosterone) and androgen (DHEA and DHEAS). This may lead to hypertension and hypokalemic
alkalosis, hirsutism, acne, oligomenorrhea in females, and sexual precocity
in males.
Glucocorticoid resistance may be differentiated from Cushing’s syndrome because, despite evidence of i urinary cortisol, abnormal suppression with dexamethasone, and i responsiveness to CRH, the diurnal
rhythm of cortisol secretion persists, there are no clinical features of
Cushing’s syndrome, BMD is normal or i, and there is a normal response
to insulin-induced hypoglycemia.
Low-dose dexamethasone treatment (2 mg/day) may efﬁciently suppress
ACTH and androgen production.

569

570

CHAPTER 100

Syndromes of hormone resistance

ACTH resistance
This is a rare autosomal recessive disorder in which the adrenal cortex
fails to respond to ACTH in the presence of an otherwise normal gland.
(mineralocorticoid secretion is preserved under angiotensin II control).
The presenting clinical features include hypoglycemia, which is often
neonatal, neonatal jaundice, i skin pigmentation, and frequent infections.
Occasionally, ACTH resistance is a component of the triple-A syndrome of alacrima (absence of tears), achalasia of the cardia, and ACTH
resistance.
Biochemical features include undetectable or low 9 A.M. cortisol, with
grossly elevated ACTH (often >1000 ng/mL), and normal renin, aldosterone, and electrolytes, and impaired response to the cortrosyn stimulation
test.
Treatment is with steroid replacement.

Mineralocorticoid resistance
Also known as type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism, this is a rare inherited
disorder that usually presents in children with failure to thrive, salt loss,
and dehydration. Both autosomal dominant and recessive forms have been
described.
Biochemical features are as follows:
• d Serum sodium
• i Serum potassium (hyperkalemic acidosis)
• i Urinary sodium (despite hyponatremia)
• i Plasma and urinary aldosterone
• i Plasma renin activity
Diagnosis requires proof of unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids (no
effect of ﬂudrocortisone on urinary sodium).
Treatment with sodium supplementation has been used successfully.
With time, treatment can often be weaned, and salt wasting is unusual
following childhood.

DEFINITION

Stress and the endocrine
system
Deﬁnition
Stress may be considered as a state of threatened or perceived as threatened homeostasis. The principal effectors of the stress response are
corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), glucocorticoids (GCs), catecholamines, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and POMC-derived peptides (especially B-endorphins).
Allostasis is a state of dyshomeostasis occurring from an inadequate,
excessive, or prolonged adaptive stress response.

575

576

CHAPTER 101

Stress and the endocrine system

Endocrine effects of stress
Hypothalamic–pituitary axis
• i Amplitude of synchronized pulsatile release of CRH and AVP
(potent synergistic factor of CRH) into the hypophyseal portal system
• i Stimulated ACTH production
• i Adrenal glucocorticoid and androgen secretion
GCs also play a role in termination of the normal stress response by
negative feedback at the pituitary, hypothalamus, and extrahypothalamic
regions.

Growth hormone axis
GCs suppress GH production and inhibit the effects of IGF-1 (thus, children with anxiety disorders may have short stature).
CRH increases somatostatin production, inhibiting GH production.
GH response to IV glucagon is blunted.

Thyroid axis
GCs reduce the production of TSH and limit the conversion of T4 to the
more active T3 by reducing deiodinase activity.
Somatostatin suppresses both TRH and TSH release.
b See Sick euthyroid syndrome (p. 15).

Reproductive axis
CRH reduces GnRH secretion.
GCs suppress GnRH neurons and pituitary gonadotropes and render
the gonads resistant to gonadotropins. GCs also render peripheral tissues
resistant to estradiol.
Chronic stress leads to amenorrhea in females and low LH and testosterone in males.
Estrogens increase CRH expression via an estrogen response element
in the promoter region of the CRH gene. This may account for the sexrelated differences in the stress response and HPA axis activity.
CRH is produced by the ovary, endometrium, and placenta during the
latter half of pregnancy leading to physiological hypercortisolism.

Metabolism
GCs via their direct effect, and via reduced GH and sex hormone activity,
result in muscle and bone catabolism and fat anabolism.
Chronic activation of the stress system is associated with i visceral
adiposity, d lean body mass, and suppressed osteoblastic activity (which
may ultimately lead to osteoporosis).
GCs induce insulin resistance and other features of the metabolic
syndrome.

INTRODUCTION

Alternative or
complementary therapy
and endocrinology
Introduction
Many patients use natural products alongside or instead of conventional
therapy. Products and information are available from many sources, particularly the Internet.
Patients need to be asked speciﬁcally about usage.
Hospital pharmacists can be extremely helpful in sourcing information about natural products, including interactions with conventional
medicines.
Quality control of natural products is usually poor, with content ranging
anywhere from 0% of stated level to several-fold higher.
Safety data are often absent or inadequate.
Discussion of any natural products listed here is not intended in any
way to imply efﬁcacy or safety of these products or to recommend their
usage but rather to illustrate the compounds being promoted for these
conditions by alternative information sources.

577

578

CHAPTER 102

Alternative therapy and endocrinology

Alternative therapy used in
patients with diabetes mellitus
A major concern with natural products used by patients with diabetes
mellitus is of interaction with conventional medicines placing the patient
at risk of hypoglycemia.

Hypoglycemic agents
These work by i insulin secretion from the pancreas or through direct
insulin-like action at the insulin receptor.
Banaba (Lagerstroemia speciosa)—crepe myrtle
Banaba extracts contain corosolic acid and ellagitannins, which may have
direct insulin-like effects at insulin receptors.
Bitter melon (Momordica charantia)
This contains a polypeptide with insulin-like effects. It is used as juice,
powder and extracts and in fried food. It is often part of Asian and Indian
foods.
Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-gracum)
This is used as powder, seeds, or part of a dietary supplement. It may
enhance insulin release and may also decrease carbohydrate absorption
due to a laxative effect. It may also inhibit platelets and thus increase
bleeding diathesis.
Gymnema (Gymnema sylvestre)
Gurmar in Hindi means “sugar destroying”. The extract GS4 is also used.
Gymnema may increase endogenous insulin secretion (i C-peptide levels
noted in users). In some preliminary studies, gymnema improved HbA1c
and d insulin or OHA requirements.

Insulin sensitizers
Cassia cinnamon (Cinnamomum aromaticum)
This is also known as Chinese cinnamon. It may increase insulin sensitivity and lower fasting blood glucose levels. It appears to be safe and well
tolerated.
Chromium
Chromium deﬁciency is associated with impaired glucose tolerance,
hyperglycemia, and d insulin sensitivity. Chromium forms part of a glucose tolerance factor complex, thus supplements are sometimes labeled
“chromium GTF.”
In patients with diabetes and chromium deﬁciency, addition of chromium improves glycemic control. However the role of chromium in
patients without deﬁciency is not clear.
The American Diabetes Association (ADA) only recommends chromium usage in patients with documented chromium deﬁciency. Excessive
chromium may cause renal impairment.

ALTERNATIVE THERAPY USED IN PATIENTS

Vanadium
Vanadium is thought to stimulate hepatic glycogenolysis; inhibit gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and intestinal glucose transport; and increase skeletal
muscle glucose uptake, utilization, and glycogenolysis. High-dose vanadium
(taken as vanadyl sulfate) may improve insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes, with large doses of elemental vanadium required for these effects. However, doses >1.8 mg/day vanadium
may cause renal impairment.
Ginseng
This includes both Panax ginseng and American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius). They both contain ginsenoisides, which may improve insulin sensitivity. Efﬁcacy and safety are not established.
Prickly pear cactus (Opuntia ﬁcus-indica)
Also called opuntia or nopals (referring to the cooked leaves of the cactus, this agent is prominent in Mexican folk medicine as a treatment for
diabetes. Opuntia streptacantha stems may improve glycemic control by
either acting as an insulin sensitizer or slowing carbohydrate absorption;
however this is not observed with other prickly pear cactus species.

Carbohydrate absorption inhibitors
Soluble ﬁber increases viscosity of intestinal contents, thus slowing gastric
emptying time and carbohydrate absorption, resulting in lower posprandial blood glucose levels.
The following products have some evidence of reducing postprandial
blood glucose levels and may also improve total and LDL cholesterol levels in patients. They may also interfere with absorption of drugs and thus
should not be taken at the same time as conventional medicines:
• Blond psyllium seed (Plantago ovata)
• Guar gum (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba)
• Oat bran (Avena sativa)
• Soy (Glycine max)—contains both soluble and insoluble ﬁber and may
improve insulin resistance, fasting basal metabolism, lipid proﬁle, and
HbA1c in type 2 diabetes
Insoluble ﬁber. Glucomannan (Amorphophallus konjac)—can delay glucose
absorption.

Other products used by patients with diabetes mellitus
• A-Lipoic acid. Antioxidant. May improve insulin resistance. It may help
symptoms of diabetic neuropathy (?mechanism).
• Stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) may enhance insulin secretion. It may be
toxic.

CHAPTER 102

Alternative therapy and endocrinology

Alternative therapy used in menopause
Phytoestrogens
The main types are isoﬂavones (which are the most potent and most
widespread), lignans, and coumestans.
Sources include the following:
• Isoﬂavones: legumes (soy, chickpea, garbanzo beans, red clover, lentils,
beans). The main active isoﬂavones are genistein and daidzein.
• Lignans: ﬂaxseed, lentils, whole grains, beans, many fruits and
vegetables
• Coumestans: red clover, sunﬂower seeds, sprouts
Other phytoestrogens include chasteberry (vitex agnus-castus)
These agents are not structurally similar to estrogen or to selective
estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) but contain a phenolic ring that
allows binding to estrogen receptors-A and -B. Effects of binding depend
on ambient estrogen levels, relative ratio and concentration of ER-A and
ER-B, and tissue type and location. Phytoestrogens are relatively much less
potent than endogenous estrogen (by 100- to 10000-fold).
Phytoestrogens in vitro stimulate proliferation of normal human breast
tissue and of estrogen-sensitive breast tumor cells. Theoretically, phytoestrogens may stimulate ER+ breast cancer and other estrogen-sensitive
tumors. Phytoestrogens may also antagonize the effects of tamoxifen or
other SERMs.
Phytoestrogens have not been shown to stimulate endometrial growth;
however, they are not usually taken with progestogenic compounds. It is
not known whether the other serious side effects of conventional estrogens (e.g., DVT, pulmonary emboli, IHD, stroke) occur with phytoestrogen use. Many sources of phytoestrogens (e.g., coumestans) interfere with
warfarin.
Soy protein (20–60 mg/day; containing 34–76 mg isoﬂavones) modestly
decreases frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms in a proportion
of menopausal women.
Synthetic isoﬂavones (ipriﬂavone) do not have antivasomotor activity.
Phytoestrogens from red clover have not shown consistent improvement in vasomotor symptoms. Other sources of phytoestrogens have not
shown improvement in menopausal symptoms.
b For use in osteoporosis, see Alternative therapy used by patients
with osteoporosis (p. 582).

ALTERNATIVE THERAPY USED IN MENOPAUSE

Other substances used
Black cohosh (Actaea racemosa, formerly Cimicifuga racemosa) is not to be
confused with blue cohash and white cohash, which are entirely separate
plants. Black cohash is widely used in menopause. Although often advertised as such, black cohash does not bind to estrogen receptors or have
estrogen effects and there is little evidence for efﬁcacy for hot ﬂashes.
Dong quai (Angelica sinensis)—it is not clear if it is estrogenic. There is
in vitro evidence of promotion of breast cancer cells.

581

582

CHAPTER 102

Alternative therapy and endocrinology

Alternative therapy used by patients
with osteoporosis
Calcium
There are hundreds of preparations available.
Several types of calcium salts are available (including citrate, carbonate,
lactate, gluconate, and phosphate) with little evidence of superiority of
absorption between the different compounds, other than calcium citrate,
which is useful in patients with low gastric acidity (e.g., on concomitant
proton pump inhibitors or H2 antagonists).

Magnesium
Magnesium is necessary for release of PTH.
It is not effective alone in treating osteoporosis unless patients are deﬁcient in magnesium.

Fluoride
Fluoride increases bone density but not strength—bones are less elastic,
and more brittle, with resultant i fracture rate.

Trace elements
Examples are manganese, zinc, boron, and copper.
While many trace elements are important for multiple enzyme systems
including those in bone, most patients are not deﬁcient, thus supplements
have negligible positive effect on osteoporosis. Moreover, many minerals
in high doses cause serious side effects (e.g., manganese doses >11 mg/day
can cause extrapyramidal side effects).

Vitamin D
Multiple preparations are available, mainly as ergocalciferol or colecalciferol (vitamin D metabolites require prescription).

Isoﬂavones
b See Alternative therapy used in menopause (p. 580), for more detail
about phytoestrogens’ mechanism of action.
Soy protein in doses >80 mg/day may improve bone mineral density but
no studies of soy have shown improvement in fracture rate. There are
possible adverse effects on estrogen-sensitive tissues such as ER-positive
breast cancer.
Ipriﬂavone—semisynthetic isoﬂavone—is produced from daidzein.
There are no estrogenic effects. There is no evidence of improved fracture outcome. Some studies of ipriﬂavone with calcium have reported
improved BMD, although other studies have not shown an improvement.
Ipriﬂavone can cause serious lymphopenia (<1 x 109 mL), which may take
up to a year to recover.

ALTERNATIVE THERAPY USED BY PATIENTS

Tea
Tea consists of green tea (unfermented), oolong tea (partially fermented),
and black tea (completely fermented). All teas contain ﬂuoride and have
high isoﬂavonoid content in addition to caffeine.
Coffee (with a high caffeine content) has been associated with i hip
fracture risk. However, tea drinking of all types of has been associated
with higher BMD, although no fracture outcome has been reported.

DHEA
b See Miscellaneous (p. 203).

Wild yam
Wild yam contains diosgenin, which is used commercially as a source for
DHEA synthesis; however this does not occur in humans.

Other compounds used by patients for osteoporosis
•
•
•
•
•
•

Flaxseed (alphalinolenic acid and lignans)
Gelatin
Dong quai
Panax ginseng
Alfalfa
Licorice

There is no evidence of a positive effect on bone of these compounds.

583

584

CHAPTER 102

Alternative therapy and endocrinology

Miscellaneous
Iodine and the thyroid
Sources include kelp and shellﬁsh-derived products.
Effects include iodine-induced goiter or hypothyroidism, particularly in
patients with underlying thyroid disease (may have a Wolff–Chaikoff effect
in patients with Graves’ disease, causing inhibition of iodide organiﬁcation
and thus thyroid hormone production).
Iodine-induced hyperthyroidism occurs in areas of endemic goiter and
iodine deﬁciency.

DHEA—“elixir of youth”
DHEA is reported to slow or improve changes associated with aging,
including general well-being, cognitive function, sexual function, energy
levels, body composition, and muscle strength, and to aid weight loss and
treat the metabolic syndrome.
The mechanism of action is that DHEA is secreted by the adrenal glands
and interconverted to DHEAS. Both DHEAS and DHEA are converted to
androgens and estrogens that then act directly at their receptors.
DHEA and DHEAS may play a role in replacement of adrenal androgens
in patients with adrenal insufﬁciency, resulting in improved well-being, particularly with respect to sexual function.
It is not proven in controlled trials to improve health in other patients
without adrenal insufﬁciency.
There are risks of androgenic effects in women when taken at high
doses (100–200 mg/DHEA daily). DHEA has a theoretical risk of promoting hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate and breast cancers. DHEA
may also interfere with antiestrogen effects of anastrazole and other aromatase inhibitors.

CHAPTER 103

Classiﬁcation and diagnosis

Classiﬁcation and diagnosis
Background
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by an elevated blood glucose. The
classiﬁcation of diabetes gives an idea of the underlying cause or defect.
Currently, 4–7% of the U.S. population has diabetes, with about half
that many still undiagnosed. In 2003, worldwide, 189 million people were
known to have diabetes; this ﬁgure may reach 324 million by 2025.

Diagnosis
DM is a biochemical diagnosis based on fasting and postprandial glucose
levels. The venous plasma glucose levels for this are shown in Table 103.1.
In 1997, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) suggested lowering
the normal fasting plasma glucose level to <110 mg/dL and the diabetic
level to >126 mg/dL. A fasting glucose is therefore the diagnostic test of
choice. Only pregnant woman are expected to have a 2-hour postprandial
level checked routinely.
A diagnosis of diabetes is made in any symptomatic person with a random blood glucose >200 mg/dL. Asymptomatic patients or those with
intercurrent illness still require a further abnormal result before a diagnosis of diabetes can be made.

CLASSIFICATION

Classiﬁcation
The ﬁrst accepted classiﬁcation of diabetes was drawn up by the WHO
and modiﬁed in 1985 (b see Table 103.1). The original classiﬁcation into
insulin-dependent DM (IDDM), or type 1, and non–insulin-dependent DM
(NIDDM), or type 2 (Table 103.2), is now no longer used but is still seen
in non-diabetes literature.
The current classiﬁcation includes both clinical stage and etiology and
has been used since 1997. The clinical staging is from normal glucose tolerance through impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or impaired fasting
hyperglycemia (IFG) and on to frank DM, which is split into non-insulin
requiring, insulin requiring for control, and insulin requiring for survival.
The etiological groups are listed in Box 103.1.

CHAPTER 103

Classiﬁcation and diagnosis

Genetics
Type 1diabetes
The overall lifetime risk in a Caucasian population of developing type 1
diabetes is only 0.4%, but this rises to
• 1–2% if your mother has it.
• 3–6% if your father has it.
• 6% if siblings have it.
• Monozygotic twins have a 40% concordance rate.
Islet cell antibodies are seen in only 0.3% of the general population but
in 40–50% of monozygotic twins and 5% of siblings of type 1 patients. A
genetic predisposition is therefore suggested, but this also highlights the
importance of environmental triggers, as not all those with antibodies go
on to develop diabetes. Genetic predisposition accounts for 1/3 of susceptibility to type 1 diabetes.
Although several different regions of the human genome are linked to
the development of type 1 diabetes, the most common are the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens and human leukocyte antigens
(HLA). In the United States, more than 90% of patients with type 1 diabetes have HLA-DR3, DR4, or both.
Certain variants of the DQB1 or DQA1 gene result in expression of
susceptible alleles of DR3/DR4. This association is not true in all races,
notably the Japanese.
There are currently 10 distinct genetic areas (IDDM1–IDDM10) known
to be linked to type 1 diabetes; some relate to MHC genes, others to the
insulin gene region. MHC antigens commonly found in those with type
1 diabetes and felt to predispose to it are B15, B8, and DQ8. The DR2,
DQ6, and DQ18 genes appear to be protective.
Linkage studies have suggested type 1 susceptibility genes on the following chromosomes:
• 6q (also known as IDDM5)
• 11p (IDDM2)
• 11q (IDDM4)
• 15q (IDDM3)
These genetic variations may help explain susceptibility, but their link
to i levels of islet cell antibodies, antiglutamate decarboxylase (GAD)
antibodies, and antityrosine phosphatase antibodies (anti-IA-2 antibodies)
often seen soon after diagnosis is less clearly decided.
If all of these three antibodies are present in a nondiabetic individual,
the person has an 88% chance of developing type 1 diabetes within the
next 10 years.

Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY)
The genes known to be involved in MODY are gradually i as our understanding of insulin signaling and receptors expands.

GENETICS

MODY 1 (HNF4A)
• Accounts for <0.0001% of all type 2 patients and about 5% of cases of
MODY
• Usually presents in adolescence or early adulthood, <25 years of age
• Can give severe hyperglycemia, with 20% needing insulin therapy and
40% needing oral agents
• Results in a high frequency of microvascular complications
• Inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with a defect on
chromosome 20q, resulting in altered activity of the hepatic nuclear
factor (HNF)4A gene, which is a positive regulator of HNF1A. This is
a transcription factor found in the liver and B cells of the pancreas,
where it acts as a transactivator of the insulin gene in rat models.
MODY 2 (glucokinase)
• Accounts for <0.2% of type 2 patients and 10–14% of cases of MODY
• Presents in early childhood
• Gives only mild hyperglycemia and thus infrequent microvascular
complications, with 90% of patients being controlled on diet alone and
insulin usually only needed when becoming pregnant
• Autosomally dominantly inherited with a defect in the glucokinase
gene on chromosome 7. This results in altered glucose sensing in the
B cells of the pancreas and impaired hepatic production of glycogen.
MODY 3 (HNF1A)
• Affects 1–2% of type 2 patients and accounts for 70% of MODY
patients
• Presents in adolescence or early adulthood (peaks around 21 years of
age)
• Causes severe hyperglycemia and frequent microvascular
complications; 1/3 require insulin therapy and 1/3 require oral agents
• Linked to a mutation on chromosome 12q24 that directly alters
HNF1A activity. How this causes type 2 diabetes is not fully
understood.
MODY 4 (IPF-1)
• Accounts for <1% of cases of MODY
• A mutation occurs in transcription factor gene IPF-1, which in its
homozygous form leads to total pancreatic agenesis.
• MODY 5 (HNF1-B)
• Accounts for 3% of cases of MODY
• Average age of presentation is 22 years, with renal cysts (RCAD—renal
cysts and diabetes) and often uterine abnormalities, gout, and insulin
resistance

Type 2 diabetes
In patients with type 2 diabetes, the concordance between monozygotic
twins for diabetes is much higher (60–100% vs. 40% for type 1), but the
rate among dizygotic twins is much less, suggesting a much stronger
genetic element in its etiology than for type 1 diabetes. Unlike patients

591

592

CHAPTER 103

Classiﬁcation and diagnosis

with type 1 diabetes, however, those with type 2 do not seem to have the
same HLA-linked genes.
In most families this appears to be polygenic, although the much less
common MODY is autosomal dominant but only accounts for a few percent of all type 2 patients.
MODY is currently split into four types, with type 4 accounting for
15% of cases and for those cases that do not ﬁt into types 1–3, although
a chromosome 13 defect in the insulin promoter factor 1 gene may fall
into this group.
Other recognized genetic subtypes of type 2 diabetes include mitochondrial diabetes, which affects 1–3% of type 2 patients and is maternally transmitted. It is associated with deafness and other neurological abnormalities.
Insulin resistance is an important part of type 2 diabetes, and rare genetic
defects causing this are recognized. A 40% reduction in the biological effect
of any given insulin molecule is suggested by clamp studies in type 2 patients,
but these rarer genetic syndromes may result in a more severe picture.

BACKGROUND

General management and
treatment
Background
After diagnosis, all patients with diabetes need to see a dietitian and have
a full medical assessment. The ﬁrst priority is to decide whether this is a
person with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, as the former needs insulin immediately whereas the later needs initial dietary advice. Such advice should
always take into account the patient’s circumstances and culture and be
individually tailored to be achievable.

Investigations
Initial investigations will be modiﬁed by the history and examination but as
a minimum should include the following:
• Blood tests for urea and electrolytes, liver and thyroid function, and a
full lipid proﬁle
• Urine tests for ketones, macro- and (if negative) microalbuminuria
• An ECG in all patients with type 2 diabetes

Treatment
In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin therapy is mandatory, along with
dietary advice and standard diabetes education. The education of all newly
diagnosed patients is intended to provide an incentive for good compliance. A full education package should include the following:
• An explanation of what diabetes is and what it means to the patient
• Aims of treatment, e.g., rationale of reducing complications and exact
values to aim for
• Types of not just drugs but also dietary advice and lifestyle
modiﬁcation, such as i physical activity, stopping smoking, and
reducing alcohol intake
• Self-monitoring, the reasons for doing it, and what to do with the results
• An idea of some chronic complications of diabetes and what to watch
for, e.g., a podiatrist’s input and review is advised, especially for those
with type 2 diabetes.
All patients with type 2 diabetes should be considered for such an
educational package.
In most patients the next step is to try diet, exercise, and weight
reduction (if obese, which most will be) before initiating drug therapy if
control is not adequate. If this fails to improve control adequately after
1–2 months, consider oral therapy with metformin in the overweight and
sulfonylureas in the lean if there are no contraindications.

ORAL HYPOGLYCEMIC AGENTS

After the initial assessment, all patients should be put into a formal
review system, whether by their PCP or an endocrinologist, for further
education, maintenance of good control, and complication screening.

Dietary advice
In the overweight patient (e.g., BMI >27), a reduction in total calorie intake
to aid weight reduction is also required. A standard diabetic diet should
aim to have the following:
• <10% of its energy in the form of saturated fat (<8% if hyperlipidemic)
• <30% from all fats
• 50% as carbohydrate, which is mostly complex high ﬁber
• Sodium content <6 g/day in most people or <3 g/day if hypertensive
Alcohol is a signiﬁcant source of calories; reduced intake is advised in the
overweight or hypertriglyceridemic patient.
The current “standard” diet for a person with diabetes is a weightreducing low-fat, low–glycemic index diet with reduced sodium content.
Most patients will have type 2 diabetes and are slightly overweight, so this
diet needs to be modiﬁed to the individual.

Oral hypoglycemic agents
Sulfonylureas (Table 104.1)
These agents are used as ﬁrst-line treatment in non-obese patients with
type 2 diabetes. The ﬁrst-generation agents, chlorpropamide, tolbutamide,
and tolazamide, are rarely used today.
Second-generation agents such as glibenclamide, gliclazide, and glipizide
are more commonly used. Third-generation agents such as glimepiride are
also available.
Mode of action
Sulfonylureas act by stimulating a receptor on the surface of B cells, closing a potassium channel, and opening a calcium channel with subsequent

insulin release. A doubling of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion can be
expected with both ﬁrst- and second-phase insulin secretion affected. This
results in a 1–2% reduction in HbA1c over the long term.
Side effects
These are hypoglycemia and weight gain. The elderly are particularly at
risk of hypoglycemia with the longer-acting agents such as glibenclamide,
and these should be avoided in this age group.
Occasional skin reactions, alterations in liver function tests, and minor
GI symptoms may occur. Also avoid sulfonylureas in porphyria.

Biguanides (Table 104.2)
Metformin is ﬁrst-line therapy in obese or overweight people with type
2 diabetes. It is also used in some insulin-treated, insulin-resistant, overweight subjects to reduce insulin requirements.
The UK Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) showed signiﬁcantly better results from metformin for complications and mortality compared to
other therapies in overweight patients with type 2 diabetes. Although a
1–2 kg weight loss is seen initially, UKPDS data suggest metformin does
not signiﬁcantly alter weight over a 10-year period.
Mode of action
Metformin works by d hepatic gluconeogenesis and i muscle glucose
uptake/metabolism, thus increasing insulin sensitivity. With long-term use
a 0.8–2.0% reduction in HbA1c can be expected.
Side effects and contraindications
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal (creatinine >1.4),
hepatic, or cardiac impairment or those who consume signiﬁcant amounts
of alcohol.
GI side effects include nausea, epigastric discomfort, and diarrhea and
occur in up to 30% of patients in the ﬁrst 1–2 weeks of treatment but are
usually transient. If the starting dose is low (e.g., 500 mg once daily), most
people develop a tolerance to these and are able to take higher doses;
<5% are totally intolerant.
Rarely, skin rashes may occur. When seen, they usually occur in patients
with hepatic, renal, or cardiac impairment.
Use of radiological contrast media with metformin is associated with
an i risk of lactic acidosis. Therapy should be stopped at the time of or
prior to such investigations and restarted 2 days after the test unless renal

function has been affected by the procedure, in which case this should be
resolved ﬁrst.
Lactic acidosis occurs very infrequently, e.g., 0.024–0.15 cases/1000
patient years in a Swedish study. Although it is known to reduce folic acid
and vitamin B12 absorption, this is not usually a signiﬁcant problem clinically
with metformin.

Prandial glucose regulators (Table 104.2)
These agents can be used in type 2 patients who have inadequate control
on diet or metformin. They predominantly target postprandial hyperglycemia because of their short duration of action.
Repaglinide, a carbamoylmethyl benzoic acid derivative, is a nonsulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agent that stimulates the secretion of
insulin from pancreatic B cells. It works on separate parts of the B-cell
sulfonylurea receptor from the sulfonylureas.
Its use results in an approximate 0.6–2% reduction in HbA1c levels. Its
very short duration of action reduces the risk of hypoglycemia compared
to that with some sulfonylureas.
It has an insulinotropic effect within 30 minutes of oral administration
and a return to normal insulin levels within 4–6 hours (elimination half-life
is around 1 hour). It should not, however, be used in patients with renal
or hepatic impairment and may result in hepatic dysfunction, so periodic
liver function test monitoring is required.
Nateglinide is a D-phenylalanine derivative with an insulinotropic effect
within 15 minutes of oral administration and a return to normal insulin
levels by 2 hours (elimination half-life 1.5 hours), thus reducing the risk of
subsequent hypoglycemia. Efﬁcacy is similar to that of repaglinide.
A-glucosidase inhibitors (Table 104.3)
These are used in type 2 patients who have inadequate control on diet
or other oral agents alone. When taken with food, acarbose reduces

postprandial glucose peaks by inhibiting the digestive enzyme A-glucosidase,
which normally breaks carbohydrates into their monosaccharide components, thus retarding glucose uptake from the intestine and reducing postprandial glucose peaks.
Some improvement in lipids has also been reported.
These undigested carbohydrates then pass into the large intestine where
bacteria metabolize them. This may explain the common side effects of
postprandial fullness or bloating, abdominal pain, ﬂatulence, and diarrhea.

Thiazolidinediones (Table 104.3)
This class of drugs acts as insulin-sensitizing agents by activating the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR-G), which stimulates gene
transcription for glucose transporter molecules such as Glut 1 and Glut 4.
The ﬁrst of this class was troglitazone, which was withdrawn soon after its
launch because of reports of hepatotoxicity.
Other agents, such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, are available, giving
a 0.6–1.5% drop in HbA1c. These do not seem to have the same problem
with hepatotoxicity, and there is often an improvement in liver function,
especially with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH).
Although the risk of hepatic dysfunction is not high, initial checks of liver
function and monitoring of liver function test are still currently advised. In
view of the more common problem with ﬂuid retention, avoidance of use
in patients with heart failure is also strongly suggested.
Recent studies suggest a link with osteoporosis with both the currently
available agents. The weight gain seen with both agents is also an important factor when considering the best therapy for any patient.
Indications
• Type 2 diabetes, oral combination with metformin or a sulfonylurea or
a meglitinide
Dose
• Rosiglitazone 4–8 mg/day (combination metformin and rosiglitazone
tablets are also available, either 2 mg or 4 mg rosiglitazone with 500
mg or 1 g metformin per tablet)
• Pioglitazone 15–45 mg/day (combination metformin and pioglitazone
as 15 mg pioglitazone and 850 mg metformin per tablet)
Side effects
• Fluid retention
• Weight gain
• Hepatotoxicity

The incretin system (GLP-1 mimetics and DPP4 inhibitors)
Glucagon-like polypeptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide
(GIP), also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, are hormones made in the L- and K-cells of the jejunum and ileum in response
to a food load entering the GI tract. These incretin hormones stimulate
glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppress glucagon secretion, and
slow gastric emptying, with an improvement in insulin sensitivity.

INSULIN

Exenatide is a GLP-1 mimetic. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) breaks
down GIP and GLP-1. This enzyme can be inhibited by oral drugs such as
sitagliptin and vildagliptin (i.e., DPP-4 inhibitors) with a resultant 0.4–0.7%
reduction in HbA1c over a 12-month period. They are weight neutral if
not help in reducing weight.
Liver monitoring with vildagliptin is currently recommended. The GLP-1
mimetic exenatide is available and is taken as a twice-daily injection of 5 mcg
or 10 mcg per dose. It yields a 0.6–0.8% reduction in HbA1c after 30 weeks’
use and a 1.6–2.8 kg weight loss over the same period.
Several depot preparations of GLP-1 analogs/mimetics are in development. Long-acting GLP-1analogs are coming to the market as well.
Indications
• Sitagliptin/vildagliptin—type 2 diabetes, combination with metformin or
thiazolidinediones
• Exenatide—type 2 diabetes, combination with metformin or
sulfonylurea or both
Dose
• Sitagliptin 100 mg/day orally
• Vildagliptin 100 mg/day orally
• Exenatide 5–10 mcg twice daily by injection
Side effects
• Sitagliptin—GI disturbance, upper respiratory tract infection,
nasopharyngitis, peripheral edema
• Vildagliptin—as sitagliptin + abnormal liver function tests
• Exenatide
• GI upset with nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, diarrhea
• Headache, dizziness and increase sweating
• Injection site reactions

Insulin
Insulin is required in all patients with type 1 diabetes and in some with
type 2, for the preservation of life; in other patients with type 2 diabetes
it is needed to achieve better glycemic and metabolic control or for the
relief of hyperglycemic symptoms (see Table 104.4 for detailed aims of
treatment). Most insulin is in a biosynthetic human form (from yeast or
bacteria) at a standard concentration: U100 (100 units/mL).
Insulin can be given by IV or SC route. More recently, short-acting
insulin was also given as an inhaled formulation, but this was withdrawn.
Standard insulins come as 10 mL vials for use with a 0.5 mL or 1.0 mL
syringe or as 3.0 mL cartridges for use in pen devices.
The insulin itself is unmodiﬁed/neutral or mixed with agents such as
protamine or zinc to alter its onset of action, peak effect, and duration of
action (see Table 104.5 for a summary of insulins).
Analogs of human insulin to give more rapid onset or greater duration
of action are also widely available and used. There are >30 types of insulin

preparation available, which should allow full 24-hour cover for a wide
variety of lifestyles.
The main problems with all insulin regimens are weight gain and hypoglycemia. The latter condition occurring overnight can be troublesome, especially as the patient may not know it has occurred and may react to the
morning hyperglycemia by increasing their evening insulin dose. Occasional
checks of 3 A.M. blood glucose levels may help sort this out.

Types of insulin
Short-acting (soluble/neutral) insulins
Humulin® and Novolin® are two regular insulins that have an onset
30 minutes after injection, with a peak onset at 2–4 hours, and a duration
of up to 6–8 hours. They are rarely used now in the United States.

INSULIN

Insulin analogs
Insulin lispro (Humalog®), insulin aspart (NovoRapid®), and insulin glulisine
(Apidra®) have been modiﬁed to allow injecting and eating to occur simultaneously. They have a more rapid onset of action and earlier peak effect
with peak blood insulin levels approximately 1.5–2.5 times that from the
same dose of regular human insulin.
The duration of action is also shorter at 5 hours. This may cause problems if there are long gaps between meals.
Long-acting analogs, insulin glargine (Lantus®) and insulin detemir
(Levemir®), are also available. These have a ﬂatter proﬁle with a duration
of action of 22–24 hours. They can be used as part of a basal bolus regimen
with short-acting analogs or regular insulins.
They appear to have less hypoglycemia than other background insulins
and may reduce the risk of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Their use as a oncedaily insulin alone or in combination with oral agents, such as glimepiride
or the prandial glucose regulators, is also proving popular in the elderly
type 2 patient.
While insulin glargine has a slightly longer duration of action, making it
a popular once-daily preparation insulin detemir, because of its albuminbinding properties is reported to give less between-dose variability in the
same individual. With a duration of action of 20–22 hours, it may be used
in similar situations, although a signiﬁcant proportion of people need to
use this twice daily.
Intermediate-acting (isophane) insulins
Insulin action can be extended by addition of protamine to give isophane insulin, with an onset of action 1–2 hours after injection, a peak at
4–6 hours, and duration of action of 8–14 hours. Different preparations
have slightly different proﬁles in terms of peak effect and maximal insulin
concentrations, as with soluble preparations.
Biphasic/mixed insulins
Combinations of soluble/neutral or short-acting analogs with isophane
insulins are extremely popular. The amount of soluble insulin present varies from 10 to 50%, with 30% being the most popular.
Depending on its monocomponents, onset is normally at 30 minutes, peak
effect at 2–6 hours, and duration 8–12 hours. Insulin analog biphasic preparations have an onset, peak, and duration all slightly shorter than these.

Insulin regimens
Twice-daily free mixing
Historically, these were very popular, although now they are used less.
The usual starting regimen was 2/3 isophane, 1/3 soluble, and 2/3 of the
total daily dose was given pre-breakfast and 1/3 before the evening meal.
The main problems are mixing them and pre-lunch hypo- or hyperglycemia. If on the same doses twice daily, watch for pre-evening meal
hyperglycemia and increase the morning isophane dose to compensate
for this. A reduction in the morning soluble is often needed to reduce
pre-lunch hypoglycemia.

CHAPTER 104

General management and treatment

Twice-daily ﬁxed mixture
This is most commonly a 30% soluble/70% isophane mixture. Although this
is not ideal for pre-lunch control or alterations in diet and exercise that
are not preplanned, it is indicated in type 2 patients with poor control,
those with signiﬁcant osmotic symptoms, and those in whom there is no
room to increase oral agents.
A suitable starting regimen is a 30/70 mixture with 2/3 pre-breakfast and
1/3 pre-evening meal. The exact doses tend to vary widely depending on
insulin sensitivity, but a reasonable starting regimen may be 10–15 units
pre-breakfast and 5–10 units pre-evening meal.
Basal bolus regimen
This is regular insulin (rarely) or an insulin analog given 3 × day pre-meal
with a pre-bed isophane or long-acting analog. It may have more ﬂexibility
with meal times, portions, and exercise than that of previous regimens.
The larger number of injections and more frequent capillary blood glucose
measurements needed make it less popular with some patients.
If starting this as the ﬁrst type of insulin, 3 equal pre-meal doses should
be given and altered as required, e.g., 4–6 units is a reasonable starting
dose, with 6–8 units of isophane pre-bed. If converting to a basal bolus
regimen from a twice-daily biphasic regimen, the total daily insulin dose
needs to be reduced by up to 10%.
Initially, 30–50% of the total daily insulin needed is given as a pre-bedtime isophane or long-acting analog and split the remaining insulin evenly
between meals as soluble or short-acting analog insulin. Once the patient
is on this regimen, the evening isophane or analog often needs to be
increased to maintain adequate fasting sugars.
In patients using short-acting insulin analogs and, less often, those on
standard soluble insulins, a 2 × daily isophane or a long-acting analog is
occasionally needed, especially if there is a long gap between lunch and
the evening meal.
Continuous SC insulin infusion (CSII)
Insulin pumps are used infrequently in patients with type 1 DM. Potential
problems are pump failure, ketoacidosis, and cannula site infections,
although with improvements in technology these are less common problems. Intensive diabetes education is a must.
Insulin and oral agent mixtures
In type 2 patients, several combinations are occasionally used. The two
most popular ones are bedtime insulin + daytime tablets, and more frequent insulin + metformin.
In the ﬁrst mixture, oral agents continue during the day with a pre-bed
isophane or long-acting insulin analog used to give acceptable fasting sugar
levels pre-breakfast. Although patients often start at 10 units/night, doses
5–6 times that are not infrequently needed.
In the second regimen, up to 2 g/day of metformin is added to any standard insulin regimen in order to reduce insulin requirements and improve
control without the problem of further weight gain often seen if the insulin
is continually increased.

Diabetic eye disease

Diabetic eye disease

Epidemiology
Diabetic retinopathy remains the most common cause of blindness in the
working population of developed countries. Currently, diabetic eye disease gives a person with diabetes a 10- to 20-fold i risk of blindness. It is
suggested that 84,000 of the 7.8 million North American patients with diabetics will develop proliferative retinopathy each year and another 95,000
will develop macular edema.
The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy depends on the duration of
diabetes, glycemic control, BP control, and the racial mix of the group
being examined. A prevalence of 730% in a general diabetic population
is often quoted.
In type 1 patients, <2% have any lesions of diabetic retinopathy at diagnosis and only 8% have any features of it by 5 years (2% proliferative).
But 87–98% have abnormalities 30 years later, 30% of these having had
proliferative retinopathy. In type 2 patients, 20–37% can be expected to
have retinopathy at diagnosis; 15 years later, 85% of those on insulin and
60% of those not taking insulin will have abnormalities.
The 4-year incidence for proliferative retinopathy in a large North
American epidemiological study was 10.5% in type 1 patients, 7.4% in
older-onset/type 2 patients on insulin, and 2.3% in those not on insulin.
In the US, currently maculopathy is a more common and thus more signiﬁcant sight-threatening complication of diabetes. It is suggested that 75%
of those with maculopathy have type 2 diabetes, and there is a 4-year incidence of 10.4% in this group. Although type 2 patients are 10 times more
likely to have maculopathy than type 1 patients, 14% of type 1 patients
who become blind do so because of maculopathy.
Diabetic retinopathy, like many microvascular complications, is more
common in ethnic minorities than in Caucasians. Cataracts are more
common in people with diabetes and are actually the most common eye
abnormality found. These occur in up to 60% of 30- to 54-year-olds.
Other abnormalities to look for include vitreous changes such as asteroid hyalosis, which occur in about 2% of patients. These are small spheres
or star-shaped opacities seen in the vitreous that appear to sparkle when
illuminated under an examining light and do not normally affect vision.
b See Box 105.1 for classiﬁcation.

CLINICAL FEATURES AND HISTOLOGICAL FEATURES

Box 105.1 Classiﬁcation and features of diabetic retinopathy
Background retinopathy
• Microaneurysms
• Hemorrhages
• Hard exudates
Preproliferative retinopathy
• Soft exudates/cotton wool spots
• Intraretinal abnormalities (IRMAs)
• Venous abnormalities (e.g., venous beading, looping, and reduplication)
Proliferative retinopathy
• New vessels on the disc or within 1 disc diameter of it (NVD)
• New vessels elsewhere (NVE)
• Rubeosis iridis (± neovascular glaucoma)
Maculopathy (graded as M0 if none and M1 if present)
• Hemorrhages and hard exudates in the macula area
• Reduced visual acuity with no abnormality seen

Clinical features and histological
features
The classiﬁcation of diabetic retinopathy is based on ophthalmoscopic
examination or retinal photographs. Several other changes not seen macroscopically may also explain some of these clinical ﬁndings.
One of the ﬁrst histological changes seen is thickening of the capillary
basement membrane and loss of the pericytes embedded in it. Both have
been linked to hyperglycemia in experimental models; sorbitol accumulation and advanced glycation both have a role.
In normal retinal capillaries there is a 1:1 relationship between endothelial
cells and pericytes. Pericytes may control endothelial cell proliferation, maintain the structural integrity of capillaries, and regulate blood ﬂow. Altering
these roles, along with the i blood viscosity, abnormal ﬁbrinolytic activity,
and reduced red cell deformity also seen in diabetes, may lead to capillary
occlusion, tissue hypoxia, and the stimulus for new vessel formation.
Exactly how locally produced growth factors, altered protein kinase C,
alterations in oxidative stress responses, and alterations in the autoregulation of retinal blood ﬂow combine to cause this remains unclear.
The natural progression is from background to preproliferative then to proliferative retinopathy/maculopathy and, ultimately, sight-threatening disease.

Background retinopathy
Capillary microaneurysms are the earliest feature seen clinically, as red dots.
Small intraretinal hemorrhages, or “blots,” also occur, as can hemorrhage

605

606

CHAPTER 105

Diabetic eye disease

into the nerve ﬁber layer, which are often more ﬂame shaped. With i capillary leakage, hard exudates, which are lipid deposits, can also be seen.

Preproliferative retinopathy
A cotton wool spot is an infarct in the nerve ﬁber layer that alters axoplasmic transport in ganglion cell neurons, giving an edematous infarct seen as
a pale gray, fuzzy-edged lesion, which gives it its name. IRMAs are tortuous dilated hypercellular capillaries in the retina that occur in response to
retinal ischemia.
A further change seen is alternating dilatation and constriction of veins
(venous beading) as well as other venous alterations such as duplication
and loop formation. Overall, there are large areas of capillary non-perfusion occurring in the absence of new vessels.
The Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) suggested
that certain of these features matter and suggested a 4–2–1 rule:
• 4 quadrants of severe hemorrhages or microaneurysms
• 2 quadrants of IRMAs
• 1 quadrant with venous beading
If the patient has one of these features, there is a 15% risk of developing
sight-threatening retinopathy within the next year; if two are present, the
risk rises to 45%.

Proliferative retinopathy
New vessels are formed from the retina and can grow along, into, or out
from it. A scaffolding for ﬁbrosis then forms. There are two forms of new
vessels: those on the disc or within 1 disc diameter of the disc (NVD) and
new vessels elsewhere (NVE).
Both give no symptoms but can cause the problems of advanced retinopathy, such as hemorrhage, scar tissue formation, traction on the retina,
and retinal detachment, which actually results in loss of vision. Thus panretinal photocoagulation, which can result in the regression of these new
vessels, is used when such problems are seen.

Diabetic maculopathy
Edema in the macula area can distort central vision and reduce visual acuity. Any of the above changes can coexist with maculopathy. The changes
seen can be as follows:
• Edematous—clinically it may just be difﬁcult to focus on the macula
with a hand-held ophthalmoscope.
• Exudative—with hemorrhages, hard exudates, and circinate exudates
• Ischemic—capillary loss occurs but clinically the macula may look
normal on direct ophthalmoscopy but the unperfused area will show
up on ﬂuorescein angiography.
• Any combination of these
A ring or circinate pattern of lipid deposits suggest a focal defect that may
be treated with focal laser therapy, whereas more diffuse problems may
require more extensive treatment with a macula grid of laser.

EYE SCREENING

Eye screening
Because so many patients can expect to develop eye complications, some
of which are sight threatening but with treatment can be reduced, a suitable screening program is advisable. Patients with diabetes should undergo
ophthalmic examination at least once a year. A full examination should
include the elements discussed below.

Visual acuity
Use a standard chart for distance and check each eye separately. Let the
patient wear their glasses for the test. If vision is worse than 20/30, also
check with a pinhole as this will correct for any refractive (glasses) error.
If vison does not correct to 20/30 or better, consider more careful
review; some maculopathy changes cannot be seen easily with a hand-held
ophthalmoscope and an ophthalmology review may be needed. Cataracts
are a more likely cause, so look carefully at the red reﬂex. If vision gets
worse with a pinhole, assume maculopathy until proven otherwise.
High blood glucose readings can give myopia (difﬁculty in distance
vision) and low blood glucose can produce hypermetropia (difﬁculty in
reading), although this is not universal.

Eye examination
Dilate the pupil before looking into the eye.
• Use tropicamide 1% in most cases, as it dilates the pupil adequately in
15–20 minutes and lasts only 2–3 hours.
• In those with a dark iris, you may also need phenylephrine (2.5%) added
soon after the tropicamide to give adequate views.
• The main reasons not to dilate are closed-angle glaucoma and recent
eye surgery, although as such patients are usually under an eye clinic
already, most people are suitable for dilatation.
• 1% pilocarpine drops can be used (although not routinely) if acuity is
>20/40 after dilatation. They may speed up reversal and allow driving
sooner.
Once the pupil is dilated, look at the red reﬂex to check for lens opacities.
Examine the anterior chamber; although rare, rubeosis iridis is important
to pick up. The vitreous is examined before examining the retina.
When examining the retina, use the optic disc as a landmark, follow
all four arcades of vessels out from it, examine the periphery, and, at the
end, examine the macula. This examination can be uncomfortably bright
through a dilated pupil and if done at the start makes it difﬁcult for anyone
to keep their eye still enough to complete it adequately.

Retinal photographs
Although consultant diabetologists are more accurate than general practitioners, they still miss some cases of retinopathy, compared to the gold
standard of an ophthalmologist.
One way to reduce the false-negative rate for a screening program is to
use retinal photography and ophthalmoscopy. More than 90% of people

607

608

CHAPTER 105

Diabetic eye disease

can have good-quality photos performed. This was often performed using
35 mm slide ﬁlm, although digital images are now of sufﬁciently good quality, require a less intense ﬂash, and avoid the delay of having to develop
the ﬁlm.
A digital image should be used with a minimum of 27 pixels per degree
and a 45° ﬁeld of vision for each of the two images taken per eye (one
centered on the macula the other on the optic disc).
The images obtained should then be graded and assessed by a trained
observer with a quality assurance system to maintain consistency of grading.

When to refer
The physician performing eye screening will need consultation with an
experienced ophthalmologist (see Box 105.2).

Box 105.2 Reasons for and timing of referral to an
ophthalmologist
Immediate referral
• R3/proliferative retinopathy, as untreated NVD carries a 40% risk of
blindness in <2 years and laser treatment reduces this
• Rubeosis iridis/neovascular glaucoma
• Vitreous hemorrhage
• Advanced retinopathy with ﬁbrous tissue or retinal detachments
Early referral (<6 weeks)
• R2/preproliferative changes
• M1/maculopathy, for nonproliferative retinopathy involving the
macula or for any hemorrhages/hard exudates within 1 disc diameter
of the fovea
• Fall of >2 lines on a Snellen chart (regardless of what fundoscopy
shows)
Routine referral
• Cataracts
• Nonproliferative retinopathy with large circinate exudates not
threatening the macula/fovea
Other categories
• R0/no retinopathy—annual screening
• R1/background retinopathy—annual screening and inform diabetes
care team

TREATMENT

Treatment
Glycemic control
There is good epidemiological evidence for an association between poor
glycemic control and worsening of retinopathy (see Box 105.3).
The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) looked at intensive glycemic control in type 1 patients over age 6.5 years and showed a
76% reduction in risk of initially developing retinopathy in the tightly managed group compared to the control group. The rate of progression of
existing retinopathy was slowed by 54% and the risk of developing severe
nonproliferative or proliferative retinopathy was reduced by 47%.
The UKPDS looked at type 2 patients over a 9-year period and showed
a 21% reduction in progression of retinopathy and 29% reduction in the
need for laser therapy in those with good glycemic control. The long-term
beneﬁts of improved glycemic control are therefore clear.
However, the DCCT, the UKPDS, and several previous studies also
showed an initial worsening of retinopathy in the ﬁrst 2 years in the groups
with tight or improved glycemic control. Thus all patients need careful monitoring over this period. The long-term beneﬁts outweigh this initial risk.

Blood pressure control/therapy
There is good evidence for an association between both systolic and
diastolic hypertension and retinopathy in type 1 patients, but the link may
only be with systolic hypertension in type 2 patients.
The UKPDS looked at BP control in type 2 patients and showed that
the treatment group, with a mean BP of 144/82 mmHg, compared to the
control group, which had a mean of 154/87 mmHg, had a 35% reduction
in the need for laser therapy. Adequate BP control, e.g., <140/80 in type
2 patients, is therefore advocated.
Use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors as ﬁrst-line
therapy should be considered with caution in those with pre-existing renal

Box 105.3 Risk factors for development or worsening of
diabetic retinopathy
• Duration of diabetes
• Type of diabetes (proliferative disease is more common in type 1
and maculopathy in type 2)
• Poor diabetic control
• Hypertension
• Diabetic nephropathy
• Recent cataract surgery
• Pregnancy
• Alcohol (variable results, which may be related to the type of
alcohol involved, e.g., worse in Scotland than Italy)
• Smoking (variable results, but appears worse in young people with
exudates and older women with proliferative disease)

609

CHAPTER 105

Diabetic eye disease

disease, as these agents may cause hyperkalemia and may worsen renal
function in those with undiagnosed renal artery stenosis.
Experimental evidence suggests these agents may have antiangiogenic
effects by altering local growth factor levels and reducing blood pressure.
Studies using enalapril and lisinopril have both shown a reduction in the
progression of retinopathy in type 1 patients.

Lipid control/therapy
Experimental evidence suggests that oxidized low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol may be cytotoxic for endothelial cells. Epidemiological
data also suggest an association between higher LDL cholesterol and
worse diabetic retinopathy, especially maculopathy with exudates.
A total cholesterol of >270 mg/dL gives a 4-fold greater risk of proliferative retinopathy than a total cholesterol of <200 mg/dL. A worse outcome
from laser therapy in those treated for maculopathy has also been seen
if hyperlipidemia is present. Aggressive lipid lowering is therefore advocated, especially in patients with maculopathy.

Antiplatelet therapy
In view of the altered rheological properties of diabetic patients, these
agents have been tried, but the results are variable. No evidence that
they make things worse has been shown, and some studies suggest that
aspirin and ticlopidine may slow the progression of retinopathy, although
the beneﬁt was small.

Lifestyle advice
Although stopping smoking reduces macrovascular risk, its effect on retinopathy is less clear. Alcohol consumption and physical activity also show
no consistent effect.

Other therapies
The use of agents such as protein kinase-C inhibitors and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors (e.g., bevacizumab) are currently being
investigated to see if they can delay the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Initial studies are encouraging.

Surgical treatment
Laser treatment
Up to 1500–7000 separate burns of 100–500 micron diameter, each taking
about 0.1 seconds to apply, are needed for panretinal or “scatter” laser
photocoagulation. For edematous/exudative maculopathy, a macula grid
may use only 100–200 burns of 100–200 micron diameter separated by
200–400 micron gaps, avoiding the fovea.
Laser therapy is usually performed as 3–4 sessions of outpatient treatment on conscious patients. Topical local anesthetic drops allow a contact
lens to be placed on the cornea and are often all that is needed.

SURGICAL TREATMENT

In some patients, however, this procedure may be slightly uncomfortable. A retro-orbital injection (performed through the inside of the lower
eyelid) can be given to anesthetize the eye.
The laser energy is absorbed by the choroid and the pigment epithelium, which lie below the neurosensory layer. This also absorbs the energy
and heat and is destroyed.
In patients with severe proliferative retinopathy, panretinal photocoagulation reduces visual loss by >80%, wheras a macula grid reduces visual
loss in maculopathy by >50%.
The aim of laser treatment is to prevent further visual loss, especially in
maculopathy, not to restore vision, and this distinction must be emphasized to all patients requiring treatment. The beneﬁts from laser therapy
currently outweigh the risks, which include accidental burns to the fovea
if the eye moves during therapy, a reduction in night vision, and, in a small
number of patients, interference with visual ﬁeld severe enough to affect
the ability to drive.

Vitrectomy
If the vitreous contains scar tissue, hemorrhage, or any opacity, a vitrectomy to remove it may help restore vision and allows the possibility of
intraoperative laser treatment or a better view for postoperative laser
therapy. It can also help reduce retinal traction and allows retinal reattachment to be performed.
A success rate at restoring vision of 70% is seen, but the risk of worsening vision, detaching the retina, or worsening lens opacities should also
be considered.

Cataract extraction
This is a common procedure with a slightly higher complication rate than
that in the nondiabetic population. Approximately 15% of patients undergoing a cataract extraction can be expected to have diabetes.
A large lens implant should be considered, especially if laser therapy is
going to be needed subsequently. Worsening of maculopathy after cataract extraction is also a risk that needs careful monitoring.

CHAPTER 106

Diabetic renal disease

Diabetic renal disease

Background
Diabetic nephropathy is now a major cause of premature death in patients
with all types of diabetes. Approximately 1/6 patients entering most renal
replacement programs in developed countries have diabetes, at least 50%
with type 2 diabetes.

Deﬁnition
Diabetic nephropathy is deﬁned as albuminuria (albumin excretion rate
>300 mg/24 hours, which equates to 24-hour urinary protein >0.5 g) and
declining renal function in a patient with known diabetes who does not
have a urinary tract infection, heart failure, or any other renal disease.
This is usually associated with systemic hypertension, diabetic retinopathy, or neuropathy. In the absence of these, the diagnosis needs to be
carefully evaluated. b See Box 106.1.

Box 106.1 Investigations of lipid abnormalities
• Proteinuria—urinary protein >0.5 g/24 hours
• Albuminuria—urinary albumin excretion rate >300 mg/24 hours or
>200mcg/min
• Microalbuminuria—urinary albumin excretion rate 30–300 mg/day or
20–200 mcg/min

MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS

Epidemiology
Microalbuminuria has a prevalence of 6–60% of patients with type 1 diabetes after 5–15 years’ duration of diabetes. Diabetic nephropathy occurs in
up to 35% of patients with type 1 diabetes, more commonly in males and
in those diagnosed <15 years of age, with a peak incidence approaching
3%/year 16–20 years after the onset of diabetes.
Of those type 1 patients who develop proteinuria, 2/3 will subsequently develop renal failure. In the UK, 15% of all deaths in diabetic
patients <50 years old are due to nephropathy.
In type 2 patients there are more obvious racial differences, with up
to 25% of Caucasians and 50% of Asians expected to develop nephropathy, giving a prevalence in a general clinic of 4–33%. The duration
of diabetes before development of clinical nephropathy is also often
shorter in type 2 than in type 1 patients. This may be due to an initial
delay in diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.

Making the diagnosis
A urine positive on dip testing for protein (i.e., >0.5 mg/L protein or >300
mg/L albumin) suggests diabetic nephropathy. A timed urine collection
either overnight or over 24 hours will conﬁrm proteinuria or albuminuria, but other causes of proteinuria must be excluded before labeling this
diabetic nephropathy.
Proteinuria from nondiabetic renal disease occurs in up to 10% of
type 1 and 30% of type 2 patients. Urinary tract infections, acute illness,
heavy exercise, and cardiac failure are the most common causes to
exclude (Box 106.2). The absence of hypertension or diabetic retinopathy would also put the diagnosis in question; conﬁrmation from a renal
biopsy may be required.
If the urine is standard dip test negative for albumin, microalbuminuria should be looked for. The implementation group for the St. Vincent
Declaration recommends that all patients with negative protein on conventional urinalysis be annually screened for microalbuminuria.
A urinary albumin/creatinine ratio >2.5 mg/mmol in males and >3.5mg/
mmol in females or a positive urine dip test (urine albumin >20 mcg)
should be followed by a timed urine collection repeated 3× with at least
two being abnormal.

CHAPTER 106

Diabetic renal disease

Pathology
Although macroscopically there is an increase in kidney size, microscopically there is thickening of the glomerular basement membrane, expansion
of glomerular supporting tissues (the mesangium), and ﬁbrotic changes in
both efferent and afferent arterioles. If localized, this is termed nodular
glomerular sclerosis (Kimmelsteil–Wilson nodules) and if more widespread,
diffuse glomerular sclerosis.
The thickened basement membrane initially results in alteration in its
electrical charge but not in pore size, which allows i passage of albumin
into the glomerular ultraﬁltrate, seen clinically as microalbuminuria.

Pathogenesis
Hyperglycemia
As with all microvascular diabetic complications, hyperglycemia has been
implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy via metabolic alterations. The DCCT showed a reduction in the development of microalbuminuria in patients with better glycemic control, which would support this.
The UKPDS showed similar improvements. These metabolic alterations
may be due to sorbitol accumulation from the polyol pathway, which in
turn is the result of the accumulation of advanced glycation end-products
(AGE) or an as-yet unknown mechanism.
AGE have been linked to the extracellular matrix accumulation known
to occur in nephropathy. The use of aminoguanidine to block renal AGE
accumulation and an associated slowing in the progression of albuminuria
and mesangial expansion would support their role in the pathogenesis of
nephropathy.
The evidence for the polyol pathway’s importance comes from aldose
reductase inhibitor trials, the results of which are more variable. Ongoing
studies (e.g., Action 1 and Action 2 for aminoguanidine) will examine
whether any agents are useful clinically.

Hemodynamic alterations
Increased intraglomerular pressures can be associated with elevations in
systemic blood pressure (85% of type 1 patients with nephropathy are
hypertensive), i vasoactive hormones (e.g., angiotensin-II, endothelin), or
altered levels of speciﬁc growth factors (e.g., TGF-B, IGF-I, and VEGF).
Hormonal and growth factor alterations have been suggested as important in the initial hyperﬁltration phase seen in type 1 patients who progress
to nephropathy. A role for angiotensin-II in the accumulation of extracellular matrix has also been postulated. Whether these changes are secondary
to or independent of hyperglycemia is not certain.

Genetic predisposition
There is an increase in red blood cell sodium–lithium countertransport
activity in nephropathic patients and their parents in some populations,

NATURAL HISTORY

and an i incidence of hypertension in the relatives of diabetic patients
with nephropathy.
An association between nephropathy and polymorphisms of the ACE
gene has also been noted.

Smoking
A consistent link between cigarette smoking and nephropathy has been
known for some time, but an etiological mechanism is not yet known.

Natural history
In 20–40% of type 1 diabetic patients there is initially a period of glomerular hyperﬁltration. The ﬁrst sign of nephropathy, however, is microalbuminuria, usually occurring 5–15 years after the onset of type 1 diabetes
but possibly present at the time of diagnosis in those with type 2 diabetes.
Associated with this is often the development of hypertension, a reduction in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and an increase in LDL
cholesterol and triglycerides.
This progresses to the next stage of frank proteinuria or albuminuria,
which has a peak incidence 717 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes.
This is the start of overt nephropathy; in both type 1 and type 2 patients an
approximate 10 mL/min–1 1.73 m–2 reduction in glomerular ﬁltration rate
(GFR) occurs each year once the albumin excretion rate has reached 300
mg/day, although in some patients the deterioration may be more rapid,
and treatment may reduce it.
Once serum creatinine concentration reaches 200 μmol/L, a fall of
1 mL/min per month in GFR is expected. This leads to end-stage renal
failure (ESRF) with uremia and potentially death 7–10 years after onset
of albuminuria. A plot of the reciprocal of creatinine against time is a
relatively straight line showing the projected rate of deterioration.
Patients with diabetes and persistent proteinuria/albuminuria have a high
mortality rate, due to cardiovascular disease in 40% of cases. Nephropathy
carries a 20–100 × greater mortality than that in age-matched diabetic
patients without proteinuria. See Box 106.3.

CHAPTER 106

Diabetic renal disease

Treatment
Treatment options for ESRF are either renal dialysis (hemodialysis or
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis) or renal transplantation, but life expectancy with either is no better than that of some common malignancies.
Several other therapies can, however, delay the progression to this stage.

Blood pressure
Controlling hypertension reduces the progression to microalbuminuria
and from this to albuminuria and subsequent progression to ESRF. BP
should be reduced to <130/85 mmHg, with avoidance of hypotension,
although if proteinuria is >1 g/day, a better target is <120/75 mmHg.
Weight loss, alcohol restriction, and reduced salt intake help, but drugs
are usually needed to achieve this.
Studies show beneﬁts from B-blockers, furosemide, hydralazine, and
calcium channel blockers, but the ACE inhibitors are currently the preferred ﬁrst-line agent in both microalbuminuric and albuminuric patients
as they also have an effect on kidney function independent of their hypotensive action. Several studies suggest, however, that more than one agent
will be required to control BP adequately.
Large studies with several ACE inhibitors have conﬁrmed their beneﬁt
in hypertensive patients. These agents delay the progression of microalbuminuria to albuminuria and then to ESRF. There is no documented beneﬁt
in treating normotensive patients without microalbuminuria.
Captopril (50 mg 2 × day) for 2 years in type 1 patients with microalbuminuria reduced progression to albuminuria by 68%.
Enalapril (10 mg daily) given to type 2 patients with microalbuminuria
for 5 years reduced progression to albuminuria by 67%. When used for
4 years in type 1 patients with nephropathy, captopril (50 mg 2 × day)
reduced the risk of death, dialysis, and transplantation by 50% and slowed
the reduction in creatinine clearance.
The EUCLID study looked at treating normotensive microalbuminuric
type 1 patients. In this study, lisinopril reduced the albumin excretion rate
by nearly 20% compared to placebo, but there was a 3 mmHg lower BP in
the treatment group. From this result it was suggested that normotensive
type 1 patients be treated with ACE inhibitors. An enalapril study in normotensive type 2 patients showed similar results.
Angiotensin II receptor antagonists can also reduce progression of
microalbuminuria and ESRF from trials with losartan (RENAAL) and irbesartan (IDNT, IRMA-II).

Glycemic control
Correction of hyperglycemia can reverse glomerular basement membrane
thickening and mesangial changes. Studies looking at progression to microalbuminuria and subsequent progression to frank albuminuria (e.g., the
Steno 1 and II Studies, the KROC Study) also suggest a clinical beneﬁt
from improving glycemic control. In the DCCT, tight glycemic control of
type 1 patients was shown to reduce progression to microalbuminuria by
30% and subsequent progression to albuminuria by 54%.

TREATMENT

Not all trials conﬁrm this ﬁnding (e.g., the Microalbuminuria Collaborative
Study Group Trial), and not all patients with good control in the above
trials gained beneﬁt. Even so, the current treatment aim is to normalize
or signiﬁcantly reduce HbA1c (< 7.2%) while avoiding any weight gain or
hypoglycemia associated with the increased use of both oral agents and
insulin needed to do so.

Dietary protein restriction
High dietary protein can damage the kidney by increasing renal blood ﬂow
and intraglomerular pressures in experimental situations. For microalbuminuric type 1 patients, in small studies, reducing dietary animal protein
intake appears to reduce both hyperﬁltration and micralbuminuria, and
the beneﬁt in more severe renal impairment is more evident.
In type 2 patients, the UKPDS showed an initial reduction in microalbuminuria with dietary modiﬁcation, which may in part be related to protein
reduction. A dietary protein content <0.8 g/kg is suggested.

Lipid lowering
Although diabetic nephropathy is not shown to reduce the progression
of microalbuminuria to albuminuria or renal failure, these patients have a
signiﬁcant dyslipidemia and a high cardiovascular mortality. They require
careful lipid monitoring and aggressive treatment. The use of aspirin for
similar reasons is also advisable.

PATHOLOGY

Diabetic neuropathy

Deﬁnition
Involvement of cranial, peripheral, and autonomic nerves may be found in
patients with diabetes and is termed diabetic neuropathy. This usually suggests a diffuse, predominantly sensory peripheral neuropathy. The effects
on nerve function can be acute or chronic as well as transient or permanent. The consequences of neuropathy include the following:
• Neuropathic ulcers, usually on the feet
• Charcot arthropathy
• Altered sensation (both pain and i sensitivity to normal sensation)
• Impotence (with autonomic neuropathy)
b See box 107.1 for classiﬁcation.

Box 107.1 Classiﬁcation of diabetic neuropathies
• Sensory neuropathy
• Acute
• Chronic
• Autonomic neuropathy
• Mononeuropathy
• Entrapment neuropathy
• External pressure palsies
• Spontaneous mononeuropathy
• Proximal motor neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy)

Pathology
Diabetic neuropathy is one of the microvascular complications of diabetes. Pathologically, distal axonal loss occurs with focal demyelination and
attempts at nerve regeneration.
The vasa nervorum often shows basement membrane thickening,
endothelial cell changes, and some occlusion of its lumen. This results
in slowing of nerve conduction velocities or a complete loss of nerve
function. Both metabolic and vascular changes have been implicated in
its etiology.

619

620

CHAPTER 107

Diabetic neuropathy

Pathogenesis
Hyperglycemia is probably the underlying cause of the histological and
functional changes. Several possible mechanisms have been suggested:
• Overloading of the normal pathways for glucose metabolism resulting
in i use of the polyol pathway, which leads to i levels of sorbitol
and fructose and d levels of myoinositol and glutathione. This may
result in more free radical damage and lowers nitric oxide levels, thus
altering nerve blood ﬂow. Experimental models using aldose reductase
inhibitors, which can improve some aspects of diabetic neuropathy,
add some weight to this theory.
• Possible accumulation of AGE (via nonenzymatic glycation) may also
have a role to play, as could the hypercoagulable state and altered
blood rheology known to occur in all patients with diabetes. When
used in animal studies, aminoguanidine, which blocks AGE formation,
can increase nerve conduction velocities and nerve blood ﬂow in
diabetic subjects, strengthening the role of AGE accumulation in this
process.
• In the more acute neuropathies, acute ischemia of the nerves due to
vascular abnormalities has been suggested as the cause, but again the
underlying reason for this is still unclear. Insulin-induced neuritis may
occur when insulin therapy is started and blood glucose levels fall.
Other potential etiological factors include changes in local growth factor
production and oxidative stress.
Further work is needed to clarify the exact role of each of the above
mechanisms. In the meantime, studies showing improvements in neuropathy associated with good diabetic control strengthen the argument for
the role of hyperglycemia and offer us a treatment option while we await
other therapies.

PERIPHERAL SENSORIMOTOR NEUROPATHY

Peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy
Although hyperglycemia can alter nerve function and often gives some
sensory symptoms at diagnosis, correcting the hyperglycemia can often
resolve these. Chronic sensorimotor neuropathy, however, is the most
common feature of peripheral nerve involvement seen in patients with
diabetes (see Box 107.2).
The exact prevalence of diabetic neuropathy varies in most studies
because of the different deﬁnitions and examination techniques used.
For example, sensitive nerve conduction studies can show up to 80% of
patients having abnormal results.
In more normal practice, however, 20–30% of unselected patients can
be expected to have either symptomatic neuropathy or abnormalities on
examination that are clinically signiﬁcant. At least 50% of these patients are
asymptomatic. This ﬁgure will increase with longer duration of diabetes, so
although 7–8% of type 2 patients may have abnormalities at diagnosis, 50%
can be expected to have them 25 years later.

Mononeuropathies
Peripheral mononeuropathies and cranial mononeuropathies are not
uncommon. These may be spontaneous or due to entrapment or external
pressure. Of the peripheral mononeuropathies, median nerve involvement

Box 107.2 Features of peripheral sensorimotor
neuropathy
• Usually insidious onset with numbness or paresthesia, often found on
screening rather than as a presenting problem
• Starts in the toes and on the soles of the feet, then spreads up to
mid-shin level, mostly in a symmetrical fashion. Less often, it also
involves the ﬁngers and hands.
• Affects all sensory modalities and results in reduced vibration
perception thresholds, pinprick, ﬁne touch, and temperature sensations.
• d Vibration sensation and absent ankle reﬂexes are often the ﬁrst
features found. Another risk factor for ulceration is the inability to
feel a 10 g monoﬁlament.
• Less often, the skin is tender or sensitive to touch (hyperesthesia),
or frank pain can occur.
• Painful neuropathy affects up to 5% of a general clinic population.
This pain may be sharp, stabbing, or burning in nature and at times
very severe.
• There may also be some wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the foot
with clawing of the toes.

621

622

CHAPTER 107

Diabetic neuropathy

and carpal tunnel syndrome may be found in up to 10% of patients and
require nerve conduction studies and then surgical decompression.
Entrapment of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the thigh is also seen more
commonly in those with diabetes, producing pain over the lateral aspect
of the thigh. Common peroneal nerve involvement causing foot drop and
tarsal tunnel syndrome are also recognized but less common.
Cranial mononeuropathies usually occur suddenly and have a good
prognosis. Palsies of cranial nerves III and VI are the most common ones
seen, although these are not a common problem in patients with diabetes.
In the third nerve palsy, sparing of the pupillary responses is usual.
Spontaneous recovery is slow over several months and no treatment
apart from symptomatic help such as an eye patch is needed. Unlike
entrapment neuropathies, where decompression may help, no effective
treatment is currently available in most of these cases with spontaneous
mononeuropathies.

Proximal motor neuropathy (diabetic amyotrophy)
This is an uncommon but disturbing condition that mostly affects men in
their 50s with type 2 diabetes. It presents with severe pain and paresthesia
in the upper legs and is felt as a deep, aching pain that may be burning in
nature and can keep patients awake at night, prevent them from eating,
and result in marked cachexia.
This neuropathy, with proximal muscle weakness and wasting of the
quadriceps in particular, can be very debilitating. The lumbar sacral plexus
lower motor neurons are affected, and improvement is usually spontaneous over 3–4 months. Before making this diagnosis, however, consider
other causes, such as malignancies and lumbar disc disease.
Oral antidiabetic agents may play a part in the etiology of this problem.
Conversion to insulin therapy is advised, although the anorexia experienced when the pain is severe can make this difﬁcult. Although recovery
happens over a few months, only 50% recover fully. No other treatment is
currently known to improve on this rate.

Examination
• Mandatory at diagnosis and at least yearly in all asymptomatic patients
• Test vibration, ﬁne touch (with a 10 g monoﬁlament), and reﬂexes as a
minimum. Use of a neurothesiometer or biosthesiometer gives a more
quantitative measure of vibration than a 128 Hz tuning fork. Inability
to feel the vibrating head at >25 V in the toes is associated with a
signiﬁcant risk of neuropathic ulceration and should be considered a
sign of at-risk feet.

PERIPHERAL SENSORIMOTOR NEUROPATHY

Treatment
For all patients
All patients should be reviewed by a podiatrist and, if indicated, an orthotist to give them education on foot care and suitable footwear. If followed
by regular chiropody review, this can help prevent some problems from
developing.
Asymptomatic patients
No drugs are currently available. In the past, aldose reductase inhibitors,
such as tolrestat, were advocated by some for this indication, but a recent
Cochrane review suggests no beneﬁt over placebo.
Painful neuropathy
Initially, try capsaicin 0.075% topically to the affected area, being careful to
avoid normal skin because this chili pepper extract, which depletes sensory nerve terminals of substance P, can be uncomfortable when applied
to normal skin. It can take several weeks to be effective and may induce
tingling and thus worsening of symptoms initially.
In some patients, simple analgesics have been shown to help. In more
severe cases, tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are the ﬁrst-line treatment
of choice, with imipramine 20–100 mg at night being less sedative than
amitriptyline 25–75 mg.
Although agents such as carbamazepine, phenytoin, and paroxetine have
less anticholinergic effects, they are also not as effective and are therefore
used as second-line treatment.
Gabapentin and pregabalin are well tolerated and more effective and
thus are usually used before other anticonvulsants and antidepressants.
If the pain is severe and like an electric shock, anticonvulsants such as
carbamazepine and phenytoin may be effective.
A more recent addition to the therapy for painful neuropathy is
duloxetine, a combined serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor.
Comparative trials against other agents are currently not available, but it is
effective compared to placebo in over half of people who have tried it.
For hyperesthesia, occlusive dressings such as Opsite® may prove helpful. For more severe pain, oral agents are needed.
More recent studies with agents such as the protein kinase C inhibitors
show more encouraging results, and treatment with these agents may
soon be available.

General treatments
While speciﬁc treatments are available for each form of neuropathy, there
is some evidence for more general therapies.
Poor diabetic control appears to be associated with worsening neuropathy. Improving glycemic control is advocated in any patient, especially
if neuropathy is present.
Results from the use of evening primrose oil in rats and in preliminary
human studies suggest that this may improve some aspects of diabetic neuropathy. The mechanism by which this works is not certain, but it does increase

623

624

CHAPTER 107

Diabetic neuropathy

production of cyclooxygenase-mediated prostanoids such as prostacyclin,
which could act as a vasodilator and thus improve nerve blood supply.
Other more speciﬁc vasodilators have also been examined, with
blockers and ACE inhibitors showing particularly useful results in experimental settings.
An alternative approach is not to try to improve the underlying problem
but to alter the body’s response to it. Nerve growth factor (NGF) and
IGF-I have been examined for their ability to cause nerve regeneration and
growth; NGF in particular may be promising in this role.
Other such agents are also under investigation, such as the protein
kinase C B inhibitors. Study results of these are encouraging.

Autonomic neuropathy
The most common effect of autonomic neuropathy is erectile dysfunction,
which affects 40% of males with diabetes. Only a small number develop
severe GI and bladder dysfunction.
The recent interest in sildenaﬁl has highlighted this effect. Abnormal
autonomic function tests can be expected in 20–40% of a general diabetic
clinic population.
The increased problems during surgery from cardiac involvement should
also be remembered.

Clinical features
• Impotence
• Postural hypotension, giving dizziness and syncope in up to 12%
• Resting tachycardia or ﬁxed heart rate/loss of sinus arrhythmia in up
to 20%
• Gustatory sweating—sweating after tasting food
• Dysphagia with delayed gastric emptying, nausea/vomiting
• Constipation or diarrhea
• Urinary retention or overﬂow incontinence
• Anhidrosis—absent sweating on the feet is especially problematic as it
increases the risk of ulceration
• Abnormal pupillary reﬂexes

Assessment
At least annually check the following:
• Lying and standing BP (measure systolic BP 2 minutes after standing;
normal is <10 mmHg drop, >30 mmHg is abnormal)
• Pupillary responses to light
Other less commonly performed tests to consider if the diagnosis is uncertain or in high-risk patients include the following:
• Loss of sinus arrhythmia: Measure inspiratory and expiratory heart
rates after 5 seconds of each (<10 beats/min difference is abnormal,
>15 is normal).

AUTONOMIC NEUROPATHY

• Loss of heart rate response to Valsalva maneuver: Look at the ratio of
the shortest R–R interval during forced expiration against a closed
glottis compared to the longest R–R interval after it (<1.2 is abnormal).
• BP response to sustained hand-grip: Diastolic BP prior to the test
is compared to diastolic BP after 5 minutes of sustaining a grip
equivalent to 30% of maximal grip. A diastolic BP rise >16 mmHg is
normal, <10 mmHg is abnormal. A rolled-up BP cuff to achieve the
required hand-grip may be used.
• For gastric symptoms consider a radioisotope test meal to look for
delayed gastric emptying.

Treatment
This is based on the speciﬁc symptom and is usually symptomatic only. In
all patients, improvement in diabetic control is advocated in case any of it
is reversible, although this is not usually very helpful or effective.
Postural hypotension
• May be exacerbated by drugs such as diuretics, vasodilators, and TCAs
• Mechanical measures such as sleeping with the head elevated and
wearing support stockings may help.
• Ensure an adequate salt intake.
• Fludrocortisone 100 mcg once daily initially and i as required up to
400 mcg may be helpful, but watch for hypertension or edema.
• Desmopressin and octreotide have also been used.
Impotence (b see Erectile dysfunction, p. 306)
Libido is not normally affected and pain is also unusual, so look for hypogonadism and Peyronie’s disease if these conditions are present. Autonomic
neuropathy is the likely cause, but many drugs, especially thiazides and
B-blockers, can also cause it, as can alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and stress.
These agents should be assessed by direct questioning.
Examination should include the following:
• Genitalia and secondary sexual characteristics
• Peripheral pulses, as vascular insufﬁciency may play a part
• Lower limb reﬂexes and vibration thresholds to conﬁrm that
neuropathy is present
Biochemical screening should at least include the following:
• Prolactin
• Testosterone
• Gonadotrophins (LH/FSH)
Exacerbating factors such as alcohol and antihypertensive drugs should be
modiﬁed. The main therapies are as follows:
• Oral therapies include sildenaﬁl (start at 25–50 mg, increase to
100 mg if needed and taken 1 hour prior to sexual intercourse),
vardenaﬁl (start at 10 mg, i to 20 mg if needed and taken 25–60 minutes
prior to sexual intercourse), and tadalaﬁl (start at 10 mg i to 20 mg if
needed and taken 30 minutes to 12 hours prior to sexual intercourse).

625

626

CHAPTER 107

Diabetic neuropathy

• Intraurethral alprostadil (start at 125 mcg, increase to 250 or 500 mcg if
needed)
• Intracavernosal alprostadil (trial dose is 2.5 mcg, treatment is 5–40 mcg)
• Vacuum devices
None of these therapies is ideal. Sildenaﬁl, although an oral therapy, is
effective in only 60% of those with diabetes and is contraindicated in those
with severe heart disease and those on nitrates, which rules out many
individuals.
Gastroparesis
Delayed gastric emptying can cause recurrent hypoglycemic episodes.
Promotilic agents can also help. Treatment options are as follows:
• Metoclopramide (5–10 mg pre-meals/3 × day)
• Domperidone (10–20 mg pre-meals)
• Erythromycin acts as a motilin agonist to increase gastric emptying but
may make patients feel nauseated so it is of limited use.
• Surgery—gastric drainage procedures should not be undertaken lightly.
Large bowel involvement
Constipation is treated with standard bulking and softening laxatives. The
episodic diarrhea is more troublesome. Treatment for this may include
• Loperamide (2 mg 4 × day) or codeine phosphate (30 mg 4 × day)
• Antibiotics in case of bacterial overgrowth, such as erythromycin
250 mg 4 × day for 7 days, or tetracycline 250 mg 2 × day for 7 days
Neuropathic bladder
Sacral nerve involvement can cause bladder abnormalities with reduced
sensations of bladder fullness and i residual volume after micturition.
Regular toileting initially may help, but intermittent self-catheterization or
a long-term catheter may be required.
Anhidrosis
Dry feet can cause cracks in the skin and act as a site for infection. Use of
emollient creams may help prevent this.

EPIDEMIOLOGY

Macrovascular disease
People with diabetes have a signiﬁcantly greater risk of coronary heart
disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease than that
of the nondiabetic population.
Most people with diabetes will die from one of these conditions (75%
of patients with type 2). It has been suggested that a diagnosis of type 2
diabetes equates to a cardiovascular risk equivalent to aging 15 years.

Epidemiology
The exact prevalence and incidence of macrovascular disease and its outcomes vary depending on the age, sex, and ethnic mix of patients being
assessed. In general, cardiovascular disease accounts for 75% of deaths in
type 2 patients and 35% in type 1 patients.
Although the atheroma seen is histologically the same as that in a nondiabetic population, it tends to be more diffuse and progresses more rapidly.
It also occurs at an earlier age and affects both sexes equally. Women,
therefore, seem to lose their natural premenopausal advantage.
Overall, peripheral vascular disease occurs in up to 10% of patients and
they have up to 15-fold greater risk of needing a nontraumatic amputation
than that of the nondiabetic population.
Thromboembolic cerebrovascular events occur in up to 8%, which is a
2- to 4-fold i risk compared to that of the nondiabetic population, and
accounts for 15% of deaths in type 2 patients.
The risk of having a myocardial infarction is also i 2–4 times. Women
seem particularly at risk of cardiovascular disease compared to the nondiabetic population.
Patients with type 1 diabetes have half the rate of coronary heart disease, 1/3 the rate of cerebrovascular disease, and 2/3 the rate of peripheral
vascular disease compared to rates for type 2 patients, but their incidence
rate for all of these conditions is greater than that of the nondiabetic
population.
Males and females are equally affected, with the incidence rates for
ischemic heart disease being about 6 times that of both cerebrovascular
and peripheral vascular disease.

CHAPTER 108

Macrovascular disease

Pathogenesis
Atherosclerosis has a well-known set of risk factors, such as smoking and
family history, all of which still apply in a diabetic population. Some factors,
however, are more common in those with diabetes and may also confer a
greater risk to the diabetic population. These include the following:
• Glycemic control. In patients with type 1 diabetes, worsening levels
of hyperglycemia, as suggested by higher average HbA1c levels, are
said to relate to the degree of disease present. In those with type 2
diabetes, this association is less clear-cut, although the UKPDS does
suggest that this is the case, as better glycemic control was associated
with a trend for fewer myocardial infarctions.
• Hypertension is more common in both type 1 and type 2 patients and
results in vascular endothelial injury, thus predisposing to atheroma
formation. The UKPDS suggests that BP control may be a more
important individual risk factor than glycemic control.
• Hyperlipidemia is common—e.g., hyperinsulinemia in insulin-resistant
type 2 patients causes reduced HDL cholesterol, elevated triglycerides
(and VLDL), and smaller, denser, and, therefore, more atherogenic
LDL cholesterol.
• Obesity is an independent risk factor, being more common in type 2
patients. Central obesity in particular is more atherogenic.
• Insulin resistance or elevated circulating insulin/proinsulin-like molecule
levels are known to increase the risk of atherosclerosis in both
diabetic and nondiabetic populations. This may be linked to impaired
endothelial function.
• Altered coagulability. Circulating ﬁbrinogen, platelet activator inhibitor
(PAI)-1, and von Willebrand factor levels are i and platelets are less
deformable. This alteration may be more prothrombotic, but the exact
signiﬁcance remains uncertain.
The UKPDS has shown the major risk factors for coronary heart disease in
type 2 patients to be elevated LDL cholesterol, d HDL cholesterol, hypertension, hyperglycemia, and smoking. Exactly why these risk factors are
commonly seen or linked in the same patient, particularly type 2 diabetic
patients, is uncertain.
Several hypotheses have been put forward, but none as yet explains
them all adequately. However, each suggests an element of genetic susceptibility mixed with environmental effects. A genetic predisposition to
insulin resistance, for example, may combine with poor intrauterine nutrition to produce a low–birth weight infant with a susceptibility to vascular
disease and diabetes later in life.
But other factors must be involved, as not all those who later develop
diabetes and vascular disease were small at birth.

LIPID ABNORMALITIES FOUND IN PATIENTS WITH DIABETES

Lipid abnormalities found in
patients with diabetes
Hyperlipidemia in a patient with diabetes, at any level of cholesterol, is associated with a greater risk of macrovascular disease than that for a nondiabetic
population. Patients with diabetes may have altered activity of insulindependent enzymes such as lipoprotein lipase that results in delayed systemic
clearance of certain lipids. This, combined with altered hepatic production of
apoprotein-B-containing lipoproteins, gives a more atherogenic proﬁle.
Usual ﬁndings are i triglyceride-containing lipoproteins, chylomicrons,
and VLDL. Although more common in insulin-resistant type 2 patients,
this can also be seen in type 1 patients, as can a low HDL cholesterol level
(HDL2 especially).
Other atherogenic changes include a tendency to develop small, dense
LDL cholesterol particles and a greater tendency toward oxidative damage, which renders patients even more atherogenic. Lipoprotein (Lpa)
levels are also often raised.
Even so, other common primary causes of hyperlipidemia, such as
familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia, should
not be missed. Screening for secondary causes of hyperlipidemia such as
hypothyroidism or drug-induced causes (alcohol, thiazides, and B-blockers
in particular) is also strongly advised.

Management
In all patients, the ﬁrst treatment is dietary modiﬁcation. In a patient who
is actually following a good diabetic diet, however, there is often not much
room for improvement.
Other standard advice should also be given:
• Stop smoking—this reduces risk of death by about 50% over a 15-year
period.
• Reduce weight if overweight or obese.
• Increase physical activity.
While the reductions in mortality, reinfarction, and stroke in the major
lipid-lowering trials such as the 4S study (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival
Study), CARE (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events Trial), LIPID (Long-term
Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease), and WOSCOPS (West
of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) are all very impressive, the diabetic subgroups show as good if not better reductions, although the numbers in each were relatively small (b see Table 108.1).
In the 4S study, for example, the simvastatin-treated diabetic subgroup
(4.5% of those in the study) had a 23% rate of major coronary events compared to 45% in the diabetic placebo group; the nondiabetic simvastatin
group had a rate of 19% and the placebo nondiabetic group, 27%.
On the basis of these results, it is suggested that if 100 patients with
diabetes who have angina or are post–myocardial infarction are treated
with simvastatin for 6 years, 24 of the 46 expected coronary deaths and
nonfatal myocardial infarctions can be prevented.

and ASPEN (Atorvastatin Study for the Prevention of Endpoints in Noninsulin dependent diabetes) again show signiﬁcant beneﬁt, but the AngloScandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial lipid-lowering arm (ASCOT-LLA)
was not quite so encouraging.
Once lifestyle measures have been implemented, drug therapy should
be considered. In the past, the Shefﬁeld tables, New Zealand tables, Joint
British Societies Coronary Risk Prediction Chart, and the Framingham
Risk Score calculations (b see Tables 113.1, pp. 664–665, and 113.2,
pp. 666–667) were used to determine risk in primary prevention, but now
any person with diabetes is thought of as being at such a high risk that secondary prevention targets of a total cholesterol <150 mg/dL, an LDL <80
mg/dL, and an HDL >38 mg/dL are now advocated.
A ﬁt patient with diabetes has a similar risk to that of a nondiabetic of
the same age and sex who has also had a coronary event. Other targets are
advocated by many, especially for those patients post–coronary artery bypass
grafting or post-angioplasty. Triglycerides should be brought to <140 mg/dL,
as above this level atherogenic lipoprotein changes are said to occur.
In those with mixed hyperlipidemia, a ﬁbrate or statin licensed for this
indication should be considered. A ﬁbrate will reduce triglycerides by
30–40% and LDL cholesterol by 20%, while a statin would reduce triglycerides slightly less (10–15%) and LDL cholesterol slightly more (25–35%).
Fibrates also alter LDL cholesterol to its less atherogenic form. The choice
of agent must be tailored to the individual patient.
For hypercholesterolemia alone, a statin is ﬁrst choice, as in the nondiabetic patient, and in severely resistant patients combination therapy
with statins, ezetimibe, ﬁbrates, and, less often, resins may be required.
Combination statin and ezetimibe may reduce LDL more effectively than
increasing the statin dose alone.

Treatment aims for lipids
• Total cholesterol <4.0 mmol/L
• LDL cholesterol <2.0 mmol/L
• Aim to have triglycerides <1.5 mmol/L

Box 108.1 Investigations of lipid abnormalities
Take a full history and carefully examine the patient. In all patients, then
check the following:
• Dip test urine for protein
• Serum urea, electrolytes, and creatinine (and creatinine clearance if
creatinine is raised)
• Fasting lipids
• ECG (for left ventricular hypertrophy and signs of ischemia)
Also consider the following:
• The need for a chest X-ray for signs of heart failure or cardiomegaly
• An echocardiogram
• Cortisol + dexamethasone suppression test
• Catecholamines
• Renin/aldosterone

CHAPTER 108

Macrovascular disease

Hypertension
Epidemiology
Hypertension is twice as common in the diabetic population as in the
nondiabetic population, and standard ethnic differences in the prevalence
of hypertension still hold true. Hypertension worsens the severity and
increases the risk of developing both microvascular and macrovascular
disease. With a cutoff of >160/90 mmHg, hypertension occurs in
• 10–30% of patients with type 1 diabetes
• 20–30% of microalbuminuric type 1 patients
• 80–90% of macroalbuminuric type 1 patients
• 30–50% of Caucasians with type 2 diabetes
With suggested targets of 130/80, hypertension is even more common.

Pathogenesis
Type 1 diabetes
Hypertension is strongly associated with diabetic nephropathy and microalbuminuria and occurs at an earlier stage than that seen in many other
causes of renal disease.
This may in part be linked to a genetic predisposition toward i activity
in red blood cell sodium–lithium countertransport activity, which leads to
i peripheral vascular resistance. Insulin may also have a suppressive effect
on renin release, producing hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism.
Type 2 diabetes
Hypertension is associated with insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia;
again, this may be genetically mediated. Hyperinsulinemia can directly cause
hypertension through i sympathetic nervous system activity, i proximal
tubule sodium resorption, and stimulating vascular smooth muscle cell
proliferation.
Hyperglycemia also has an antinatiuretic effect, which, along with hyperinsulinemia leading to hypokalemia, results in both glucose and sodium
reabsorption being increased. All of these factors increase the potential
for hypertension.

Management
Treatment aim
The current recommendation is for all patients with diabetes to have a
blood pressure <140/80 mmHg. The hypertension study in the UKPDS
highlights the beneﬁts for type 2 patients of this treatment level on mortality, diabetes-related end points, and microvascular end points. In this
study, a 10/5 mmHg difference in BP was associated with a 34% risk reduction in macrovascular end points, a 37% risk reduction in microvascular
end points, and a 44% risk reduction in stroke.
The Hypertension Optimum Treatment (HOT) study again suggests a
target of <140/80 mmHg, although in those who already have signiﬁcant
end-organ damage a lower target (<130/80) is advocated by some.

HYPERTENSION

The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial–Blood Pressure
Lowering Arm (ALLHAT–BPLA) reinforced the beneﬁcial role of calcium
channel blockers and ACE inhibitors in combination.
Predisposing conditions
Other conditions that can cause both hypertension and hyperglycemia should be considered, e.g., Cushing’s syndrome, acromegaly, and
pheochromocytoma.
End-organ damage
Look for evidence of end-organ damage (eyes, heart, kidneys, and peripheral vascular tree in particular).
Assessment of cardiac risk factors
Look for associated risk factors for coronary heart disease.

Treatment
General
Once this initial assessment is complete, modify other risk factors such as
glycemic control, smoking, and dyslipidemia. Then look at the following:
• Weight reduction if obese
• Reduced salt intake (<6 g/day)
• Reduced alcohol intake (<21 units/week in males, <14 in females)
• Exercise (20–40 minutes of moderate exertion 3–5×/week)
Pharmacological
After modifying risk factors, drug therapy should be started for the hypertension. Most agents currently available will drop systolic BP by no more
than 20 mmHg. In the UKPDS BP study, 1/3 of those achieving the tight BP
targets now aimed for required three or more drugs to do so.
Recently, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE)
guidelines for BP treatment were updated and now advocate an “A/CD”
approach: starting with an ACE inhibitor (or an angiotensin II receptor
blocker/antagonist if the ACE inhibitor is not tolerated) and then adding in
either a calcium channel blocker or a thiazide-type diuretic with an A-blocker,
a B-blocker, or further diuretic therapy if this fails to reduce BP adequately.
In the presence of microalbuminuria or frank proteinuria, an ACE inhibitor should always be considered ﬁrst line, or an angiotensin II receptor
antagonist if ACE inhibitors are not tolerated.
In Afro-Caribbean diabetics, a diuretic may also be needed to improve
the efﬁcacy of ACE inhibitors, as these and B-blockers are less effective
than calcium channel blockers and diuretics in these patients.
Several agents, such as high-dose thiazides and B-blockers, can worsen
diabetic control, mask hypoglycemia, and exacerbate dyslipidemia. Thus
the drugs chosen need to be tailored to each patient.
A recent review of data from the Nurses Health Study (NHS I and II)
and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) suggested that while
these agents may increase the risk of developing diabetes, they may not be

Box 108.2 Management of acute myocardial infarction
Patients with diabetes are more likely to have a myocardial infarction
(MI) and more likely to die from it than the nondiabetic population. This
may be due to a greater likelihood of myocardial pump failure. Several
studies highlight this:

In those with angina, a B-blocker has added beneﬁts.
In those with peripheral vascular disease, vasodilators such as the calcium channel blockers may be beneﬁcial.
Up to 20–40% of patients admitted to the hospital with an MI will have
hyperglycemia, many of whom not previously diagnosed with diabetes.
As in the nondiabetic population, streptokinase, aspirin, and acute
angioplasty have proven beneﬁts. The previous contraindication for
thrombolysis in those with proliferative diabetic retinopathy has been
questioned by many investigators.
Tight glycemic control (blood glucose 120–180 mg/dL) using IV glucose and insulin for at least 24 hours followed by SC insulin, as used
in the DIGAMI study, also has beneﬁts. In this study, patients with an
admission blood glucose >200 mg/dL who were treated with this regimen had a 7.5% absolute risk reduction in mortality at 1 year and an
11% risk reduction at 3.5 years compared to the control group (i.e., 33%
mortality with treatment vs. 44% in controls at 3.5 years). This equates
to 1 life saved for every 9 treated with this regimen. The exact reason
for this outcome is unclear.
It is suggested that all patients with a blood glucose >200 mg/dL beneﬁt from such treatment whether previously known to have diabetes
or not. Using an admission HbA1c to detect those with undiagnosed
or stress-related hyperglycemia can be useful, but should not result in
withholding acute treatment of this hyperglycemia in such patients. It
may, however, help to identify those who may be troubled by hypoglycemia and may not therefore be suitable for SC insulin or sulfonylureas
in the intermediate or long term.

HYPERTENSION

Box 108.2 (Contd.)
Use of ACE inhibitors early after an MI gives a 0.5% absolute risk
reduction in 30-day mortality and a 4–8% risk reduction over 15–50
months in the general population.
Analysis of the diabetic subgroup in the GISSI-3 study showed a 30% relative risk reduction in 6-week mortality for the diabetics (8.7% vs. 12.4%)
compared to a 5% reduction for nondiabetics. In view of the greater proportion of diabetics with poor left ventricular function after MI than that
of the nondiabetic population, this difference is very important.

RISK FACTORS FOR FOOT ULCER DEVELOPMENT

Risk factors for foot ulcer development
Several features and factors are thought to predispose to ulcer formation.
Awareness of these may help in identifying at-risk patients for education
and other preventive strategies.
These ulcers can occur anywhere on the foot, but the tips of claw toes
and hammertoes and over the metatarsal heads are the most frequent
sites. The risk factors and features include the following:
• Peripheral neuropathy (seen in up to 80% of diabetic patients with foot
ulcers) reduces awareness of pain and trauma caused by footwear and
foreign bodies in shoes. Look for reduced monoﬁlament sensation
(e.g., reduced to a 10 g monoﬁlament) and reduced vibration
perception thresholds (e.g., reduced sensation to a 128 Hz tuning fork
for <10 seconds or >25 V with a biosthesiometer), which suggest
at-risk feet.
• Autonomic neuropathy leading to anhidrosis can dry out the skin and
cause it to crack, thus allowing a portal of entry for infection. These
feet are often warm and dry with distended veins.
• Motor neuropathy can result in altered foot muscle tone, wasting of
small muscles, raising of the medial longitudinal arch, and clawing of
the toes. This can produce more pressure on the metatarsal heads
and heels, thus predisposing them to callus and ulcer formation.
Electrophysiology can help in examining this condition but is too
invasive for widespread routine use.
• Peripheral vascular disease (seen in up to 10% of patients) and
microvascular circulatory disease lead to local ischemia, increasing the
potential for ulcer formation, and can delay wound healing when
ulceration occurs. Always examine peripheral pulses and consider
getting Doppler studies if they are abnormal. An ankle/brachial artery
ratio of >1.1 suggests arterial disease (a ratio of the BP in the ankle
and the arm measured while at rest).
• Duration of diabetes relates to the presence of the above factors but
is often quoted as an independent risk factor, as is i age. But type 2
diabetes may be present and have gone undiagnosed for some time.
• The presence of other microvascular complications, such as nephropathy
and retinopathy, is also a risk factor for foot ulcer development.
• Previous ulceration is another important risk factor. Anyone with
previous problems deserves very careful monitoring and follow-up.
• Lack of diabetes monitoring and lack of previous examinations of the
feet are also recognized risk factors.
• Mechanical, chemical, or thermal trauma or injury is often the
predisposing factor. Any profession or pastime that increases the risk
of any of these is a risk factor.

637

638

CHAPTER 109

Diabetic foot

Treatment
This is a multidisciplinary problem requiring collaboration among diabetologists, podiatrists, orthtopedic, and vascular and plastic surgeons.
Treatment is aimed at several distinct areas:
• At-risk feet with no current ulceration
• Treating existing ulcers
• Treating infected ulcers
• Treating osteomyelitis
• Treating vascular insufﬁciency

At-risk feet with no current ulceration
When at-risk feet are identiﬁed in any patient with diabetes, standard
advice should be given. This will need to be repeated and reinforced regularly. Such advice would usually include the following:
• General advice on nail care, hygiene, and care with footwear
• Reinforce the need for regular daily examination of the feet by the
patient or caregiver.
• Consider regular podiatry review and self-monitoring. Also reinforce
the need for more urgent review if the patient discovers problems.
• Consider the need for modiﬁcation of footwear or special footwear if
there are abnormalities with foot posture or problems with pressure
loading on certain parts of the foot. Padded socks can also reduce
trauma. Advise patients to examine shoes before putting them on,
wear lace-ups or shoes with lots of room for toes, and avoid ill-ﬁtting
shoes. For some people, protective toecaps can prove useful.
• Avoid walking barefoot.
Currently, no other therapy is advocated in this group of patients. As
discussed in Chapter 107 (Diabetic neuropathy), good diabetic control
is important and other agents may be useful in the future, such as aldose
reductase inhibitors, inhibitors of nonenzymatic glycation, and various
growth factors.

Existing ulcers
All ulcers should be considered deep and involving bone until proven otherwise. The following factors are also important:
• Optimize diabetic control.
• Reduction of edema is important to aid healing.
• Regular debridement of callus and dead tissue and skin is important for
both neuropathic and ischemic ulcers.
Debridement is usually best done with a scalpel and forceps, although
chemical agents (such as varidase, which contains streptokinase) can occasionally help. Because these agents can also damage healthy tissue, they
should be used under careful supervision.
After debridement, dressings should be applied, and changed regularly.
Be careful that tight dressings do not further impair a poor circulation and
that thick dressings or quantities of sticky tape holding them on do not
cause their own skin trauma or pressure effects.

TREATMENT

Infection control
Infection may be localized, but any evidence of deeper infection or sinus
formation raises the possibility of osteomyelitis. Systemic symptoms of an
infection may be minimal, as may pain and tenderness in the foot itself, so
be suspicious of more severe infection than those usually seen.
The organisms may be ordinary skin commensals that have found a port
of entry. Send swabs for culture and think of Staphylococcus aureus or
streptococci as likely organisms.
If a sinus is present, probe it and if down to bone, assume there is
osteomyelitis. Culture anything you get out. Plain radiographs may show
bone erosion or destruction with osteomyelitis; radioisotope scans with
technetium can show i uptake with both infection and Charcot arthropathy. MRI scanning can be useful to differentiate the two.
If infection is present, use triple therapy with ﬂucloxacillin (500 mg 4× daily),
ampicillin/amoxicillin (500 mg 3× daily), and metronidazole (200mg 3× daily) or
consider using amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (250/125 mg 3× daily) or ciproﬂoxacin
(500–750 mg 2× daily) and clindamycin (300–450 mg 2× daily) depending on
the organisms grown and patient tolerability. This will need to be given IV
initially if the infection is severe. For deeper infections, several months of
therapy may be needed.
If osteomyelitis is present, consider using ciproﬂoxacin or sodium fusidate,
both of which have better bone penetration. Use for several months.
Linezolid is also useful as a second- or third-line agent, but requires
extra caution used in those with hepatic and renal impairment. This caveat
and the need to monitor for potential thrombocytopenia, anemia, or pancytopenia may limit its use.
In some patients, this approach fails to control osteomyelitis adequately
and resection or amputation is required. Regular consultation with a capable surgeon is imperative.
Reducing trauma and pressure relief
For treatment of neuropathic ulcers, padded socks can reduce sheer stress
and trauma. Suitable shoes and insoles can help relieve pressure to enable
healing, as long as unnecessary walking is minimized.
If these measures are not enough, a pneumatic or Aircast boot or a total
contact cast may be needed. These allow the patient to be mobile while
taking the weight away from the ulcerated area or foot. Instead, all of the
weight and pressure is directed through to the calf. The involvement of
podiatrists and orthotists is essential.
Revascularization
Always consider coexistent vascular disease in a neuropathic foot or predominantly ischemic ulcers and feet. Vascular bypass grafting and reconstruction or angioplasty can give excellent results, with a 70–95% limb
salvage rate often quoted. The improved blood supply will also help healing of existing ulcers and may negate the need for amputation or minimize
the area requiring resection.
If vascular intervention is unsuccessful or not possible, then amputation
is required, preferably as a below-knee procedure, to give a better mobilization potential postoperatively.

639

640

CHAPTER 109

Diabetic foot

Box 109.3 The Charcot foot
Epidemiology
This is a relatively rare complication of diabetes: an average general hospital clinic will have 3–10 patients with this problem.
Pathogenesis
Blood ﬂow increases from sympathetic nerve loss. This causes osteoclast activity and bone turnover to increase, thus making the bones of
the foot more susceptible to damage. Even minor trauma can result in
destructive changes in this susceptible bone.
Clinical features
The most likely site is the tarsal–metatarsal region or the metatarsophalangeal joints. Initially, the foot is warm or hot, swollen, and often
uncomfortable, features that may be indistinguishable from cellulitis and
gout. Peripheral pulses are invariably present, and peripheral neuropathy
is evident clinically.
Plain radiographs will be normal initially and later show fractures with
osteolysis and joint reorganization with subluxation of the metatarsophalangeal joints and dislocation of the large joints of the foot.
Isotope scans with technetium are abnormal from early on; differentiation from infective or other inﬂammatory causes can be difﬁcult. MRI
scanning may prove more useful for this, as may 111indium-labeled white
cell studies if infection is suspected.
Eventually, in the untreated patient, two classic deformities are seen:
• A “rocker bottom” deformity due to displacement and subluxation
of the tarsus downward
• Medial convexity due to displacement of the talonavicular joint or
tarsometatarsal dislocation
Management
If diagnosed early, immobilization may help prevent joint destruction.
While the best means of doing this is not agreed on, use of a nonwalking plaster cast or an Aircast type of boot is needed for at least
2–3 months while bone repair or remodeling is taking place.
Some clinicians advocate immobilization for up to a year. The recent
use of bisphosphates to speed up the repair process by reducing osteoclast activity is interesting and under further evaluation.

RISKS

Diabetes and pregnancy

Background
Of women who become pregnant, 0.27% have previously diagnosed diabetes and account for 0.10% of live births, and 2–3% of pregnant women
have a diagnosis of gestational diabetes made during their pregnancy. In
both cases, there are risks to both the mother and the fetus. These fetuses
have a historical fetal abnormality rate of up to 30%, or 12 x that of the
background population.
Given the increasing proportion of women with type 2 diabetes, these
pregnancies should also be looked for.

Risks
Fetal
With greater emphasis on improving glycemic control, a 2.5- to 3-fold i in
congenital malformation rate in mothers with previously known diabetes
and a 1.8-fold increase in those without it being known, compared to rates
in the nondiabetic population, is more realistic now. Cardiac, renal, and
neural tube defects occur, particularly sacral agenesis.
Hyperglycemia in the ﬁrst 8 weeks of fetal life, during organogenesis, is
thought to be the underlying cause. This explains the lower rate in those
with gestational diabetes, which classically occurs later, but not completely. Alterations in oxygen free radicals, myosinositol, and arachidonic
acid metabolism and alterations in zinc metabolism are also implicated.
The most common problem seen in the infant is macrosomia (in
8–50%), which can result in birth trauma and an i intervention rate. As
well as causing obesity, fetal hyperinsulinemia also accelerates skeletal
maturation, delays pulmonary maturation, and causes i growth of insulinsensitive tissues producing hypertrophy of the liver and heart.
These infants also have an i risk of hypoglycemia, seen transiently in
up to 50%, and jaundice, with rates of 6–50% quoted. Up to 50% of these
infants require phototherapy. Polycythemia is also seen.

Maternal
Maternal problems include an i risk of infection and of pre-eclampsia,
which is 2–3 times as likely to occur as in a nondiabetic mother. Women
with type 1 diabetes have a 3-fold i prevalence of thyroid dysfunction during the pregnancy and postpartum, so this needs to be screened for.

641

642

CHAPTER 110

Diabetes and pregnancy

Inheritance of diabetes
If the background rate of diabetes is 0.15%, the infant of a diabetic mother
has a 2% risk and the infant of a diabetic father a 6% risk of developing
diabetes. The risk of type 2 diabetes in a child of a type 2 mother is
much higher, at 15–30%, and rises to 50–60% if both parents have type
2 diabetes.

Known diabetes and pregnancy
Most women with diabetes have normal deliveries and normal babies. In
most instances, these are women with type 1 diabetes, although in some
ethnic groups type 2 patients may make up a sizable group. In both groups
it is of utmost importance to have pre-conception glycemic control optimized, e.g., preferably an HbAlc level in the nondiabetic range or <7.0% if
that is not possible.
The congenital malformation and spontaneous abortion rates are signiﬁcantly higher when the HbA1c is elevated. Once the HbA1c is 4–6
standard deviations above the normal nondiabetic range, there is a 4-fold
increase in the malformation rate; at over 6 standard deviations above
normal, this rises to a 12-fold risk.
In type 2 patients, converting from oral agents to insulin is important.
If this is not possible prior to conception, it should be done as soon as a
woman is found to be pregnant.

Pre-conception management
Pre-conception and post-conception advice to diabetic women is similar to
that given to nondiabetic women: stop smoking, reduce alcohol intake, avoid
unpasteurized dairy products, and add oral folate supplements (5 mg/day).
Any potentially teratogenic drugs they may be taking (e.g., antihypertensive
agents) also need to be reviewed.
Ideally, all patients who have diabetes and are pregnant should be managed in a combined clinic by an obstetrician and a diabetologist. Reviews
are initially every 2–4 weeks then every 1–2 weeks in the last 1/3 of pregnancy. Screening and monitoring for conditions such as associated thyroid
disease at these reviews is also advisable.

Maintaining good glycemic control
This is important not just because of the risk of ketoacidosis, which occurs
in <1 % of diabetic pregnancies and is associated with fetal loss in 20%
of episodes, but also because of macrosomia in the fetus and the i fetal
mortality (up to 2.2% of births in diabetic mothers) and i intervention
rate at delivery.
The aim is to keep the glucose and HbAlc levels in the nondiabetic
range, to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with pregnancy
and diabetes (Box 110.1). Even with perfect control, however, there is a
small but signiﬁcant excess of major congenital malformations in these
children and an unexplained risk of late stillbirths.

Target glycemic control
• Fasting glucoses of <90 mg/dL
• Postprandial glucoses of <126 mg/dL
• Keep the HbA1c level in the nondiabetic range.

Treatment regimen
A basal bolus regimen gives the greatest ﬂexibility and is commonly used
to achieve this target. In type 1 patients, insulin requirements often fall in
the ﬁrst trimester, increase slightly in the second, then continue to rise
until about 36 weeks, falling back to pre-pregnancy levels after delivery.
In type 1 women, early pregnancy is a cause of falling insulin requirements and recurrent hypoglycemia. It has been suggested that up to 40%
of women with type 1 diabetes will experience signiﬁcant hypoglycemic
episodes when pregnant and hypoglycemic awareness may alter. Advice
regarding care with driving and other potentially hazardous pursuits is
therefore needed early in pregnancy, if not before conception.
Type 2 women requiring insulin usually need 0.9 units/kg/day initially and
1.6 units/kg/day later in the pregnancy.

Monitoring of diabetic complications during pregnancy
Certain diabetic complications are known to worsen during pregnancy.
Screening for nephropathy and retinopathy in particular is advised at least
each trimester.

Fetal monitoring
Scanning of the fetus is performed at 10–12 weeks to look for congenital
abnormalities and to conﬁrm dates.
Repeat scanning is used to check for excessive growth or macrosomia
at 18–20 weeks, 28 weeks, 32 weeks, and 36 weeks, although the exact
timing and frequency can vary between centers.

Management of delivery
At delivery, most units have set protocols (see Box 110.2). In general, induction soon after 38 weeks’ gestation (or not later than the expected delivery
date) and use of a continuous insulin infusion with a separate dextrose and
potassium infusion to maintain stable blood glucose levels are advisable.
This infusion is important, as maternal hyperglycemia during delivery
can be associated with neonatal hypoglycemia and an adverse neurological
outcome in the infant. The infant responds to a hyperglycemic environment in utero by increasing its own insulin production.

After delivery
Monitoring of the infant’s capillary blood glucose levels post-delivery is
also often performed. The i potential for hypoglycemia in the mother

CHAPTER 110

Diabetes and pregnancy

Box 110.2 Treatment regimen for labor and delivery
• If labor is induced, omit the previous evening’s long-acting insulin.
• Infuse 10% glucose at 75–125 mL/h (with 20 mmol potassium per
500 mL bag). Infuse via syringe driver 2–4 units/h of soluble insulin
initially (usually made as 50 mL soluble insulin in 50 mL of 0.9% saline
in a 50 mL syringe).
• Monitor capillary blood glucose levels hourly and adjust infusion rate
of the insulin to keep blood glucose levels in the 110–150 mg/dL range.
• Monitor ﬂuid balance carefully (especially if oxytocin is also being
given).
• Check serum sodium if labor lasts over 24 hours (or 8 hours with
oxytocin)

and the baby if breast-feeding also needs to be watched for. Extra carbohydrate snacks for the mother are often needed, along with a 20–25%
reduction in pre-conception insulin requirements.
One day’s worth of breast milk contains about 50 g of carbohydrate.
Also consider monitoring thyroid function at 3 and 6 months postdelivery.

After delivery
• Halve the IV insulin infusion rate.
• Continue to monitor capillary blood glucose hourly for at least 4 hours
then every 2–4 hours until the mother is eating normally.
• Return to the pre-pregnancy regimen when the mother is eating normally,
but be careful, as insulin requirements can be low for the ﬁrst 24 hours.

Gestational diabetes
Epidemiology
Pregnancy induces a state of insulin resistance with increases in the levels
of growth hormone, placental growth hormone, progesterone, placental
lactogen, and cortisol. This can result in altered glucose handling.
Impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy occurs in up to 2–3% of
pregnant women and may be associated with an i risk of subsequent type
2 diabetes in 20–50% of patients. Worsening maternal insulin resistance
and associated hyperglycemia usually becomes evident from the second
trimester on if it is going to occur.
As with women previously known to have diabetes, there is an association with worsening carbohydrate intolerance and a worse maternal and
fetal outcome.
Untreated gestational diabetes has a perinatal mortality of 4.4–6.4% compared to 0.5–1.5% in a similar ethnic normoglycemic population. Intensive
insulin treatment has been shown to reduce such complications. This is the
rationale for careful multidisciplinary care of these patients.

GESTATIONAL DIABETES

Treatment
Initial treatment is with dietary advice; in 10–30%, insulin is also required.
Insulin therapy should be considered if fasting blood glucoses are >110 mg/dL
or postprandial levels are >150 mg/dL.
Obesity is not uncommon in these patients. The importance of postdelivery dietary modiﬁcation and weight reduction, to reduce the risk of
future type 2 diabetes, should also be reinforced.
The varying insulin requirements during pregnancy occur as in those
with previously known diabetes, and most (but not all) patients will not
need insulin treatment following delivery. Monitoring is with home capillary blood glucose measurements, daily if on diet alone and more frequently if on insulin therapy.
The frequency needed depends on the results obtained, with the aim
of keeping all readings <126 mg/dL. If diet alone fails, a basal bolus insulin
regimen as used in the known diabetic is usually required. The total initial daily dose is determined on the basis of the degree of hyperglycemia
present; 4–6 units per bolus is usual.
As with the previously known diabetic mother, the aim is to have a normal delivery, more often at 38 weeks to term, depending on fetal growth.
An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be performed 6 weeks
after delivery in all patients not requiring insulin post-delivery, to conﬁrm
a return to normal glucose metabolism. A further reinforcement of diet
and weight advice at this time is also usual practice.
Whether these patients should be followed up because of their i
risk of diabetes is unclear, although annual fasting blood glucose levels
in asymptomatic women with a normal 6-week postpartum OGTT is
often advised. More careful review is suggested for those with abnormal
OGTTs.

High-risk groups
Most women with gestational diabetes are found on routine screening at
about 30 weeks, but certain high-risk groups should be screened earlier
(see Box 110.3 for screening methods).
These risk factors include the following:
• Previous gestational diabetes
• A large baby in their last pregnancy, e.g., >4.0 kg at term
• A previous unexplained stillbirth or perinatal death
• Maternal obesity
• Family history of diabetes (ﬁrst-degree relatives)
• Polyhydramnios

Contraception and diabetes
Oral contraceptives
The early combined oral contraceptive pills (OCP) impaired glucose tolerance and so were not advised in patients with diabetes. The use of thirdgeneration low-dose estrogen-containing combined OCPs (e.g., 20 mcg
ethinylestradiol) is safe in women <35 years of age. Third-generation OCPs
are advised, as they have a better risk proﬁle for arterial disease and only
occasionally increase insulin requirements.

645

646

CHAPTER 110

Diabetes and pregnancy

Box 110.3 Methods of screening
• Urine dip testing for glucose should be performed on every pregnant
woman at every antenatal visit.
• If glycosuria is found, a fasting glucose test is performed, and if >110
mg/dL, a 75 g OGTT is needed (see Table 110.1).
• Routine screening at 28–32 weeks is also often done, either with
random blood glucose tests or a fasting blood glucose level. If a
fasting level is >110 mg/dL or a postprandial level is >126 mg/dL, an
OGTT is required.
• The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are no different from those in
the nonpregnant population. A diagnosis of gestational diabetes or
gestational IGT is made if the fasting glucose is 110–140 mg/dL and/
or the 2-hour postprandial level is 160–200 mg/dL by St. Vincent
deﬁnition. The WHO deﬁnition has a fasting level of 140 mg/dL and/
or a 2-hour postprandial level of 140–200 mg/dL.

As in the nondiabetic population, standard advice regarding the pill
should be given. Its use should be avoided in at-risk groups such as overweight smokers with a family history of thromboembolism and coronary
heart disease. There is an i risk of cerebral thromboembolism in type 1
patients, but the OCP dose not increase this.
In those with microvascular disease or coronary risk factors, the progesterone-only “mini-pill” (POP) is safer than the combined OCP, as it
has no signiﬁcant adverse effects on lipid metabolism, clotting, platelet
aggregation, or ﬁbrinolytic activity.
It has been suggested that levonorgestrel- and norethisterone-containing POPs may reduce HDL2 cholesterol subfractions. The avoidance of
POPs in those with established arterial disease is advised.
Barrier methods
The condom and the diaphragm were historically the contraceptive
method of choice in people with diabetes and do not have the metabolic
risks of the oral contraceptives described above.
But both are less effective forms of contraception with a failure rate of
0.7–3.6/100 couple years for the condom and 2/100 couple years for the
diaphragm, compared to nearly 0.2/100 female years with the combined

GESTATIONAL DIABETES

OCP. In a population in which pregnancy carries signiﬁcant risks, other
forms of contraception are now more often advocated.
Intrauterine contraceptive devices (lUD)
There is concern that diabetes might make a pelvic infection associated
with an IUD more severe and render both copper-containing and inert
IUDs less effective, but not all studies have conﬁrmed these worries.
Nevertheless, if an IUD is used in a woman with diabetes, a progestagenreleasing variety or a small copper device with regular use of spermicides
are the current favorite options.
Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
As with the OCP, diabetes itself is not a contraindication to the use of
HRT. The estrogens in HRT differ from those in the OCP and may actually reduce insulin resistance and also protect against coronary disease,
although they may not actually reduce cardiovascular events in those with
established coronary artery disease.

CHAPTER 111

Intercurrent events or disease

Intercurrent events or
disease
Surgery
Preoperative assessment
Careful preoperative assessment is essential because of an i risk of death
and complications such as ﬂuid overload from coronary heart disease
and diabetic nephropathy. Any preoperative assessment in a patient with
known diabetes should therefore include the following:
• An adequate history of diabetic complications
• A full examination looking for evidence of peripheral vascular disease,
peripheral neuropathy, and lying or standing BPs in case of autonomic
neuropathy
• Assessment of current and overall diabetic control using blood glucose
measurements in all patients and glycated hemoglobin
• General investigations should include serum urea + electrolytes/
creatinine, FBC, urine dip testing for protein, and an ECG (in anyone
>45 years old).
Any further investigation will be based on problems found in the history
or examination, such as foot ulceration and potential osteomyelitis, which
may give a source for infection such as an MRSA.
Attempts should be made to improve diabetic control, either on the
ward or in a diabetic clinic, for any patient undergoing an elective procedure whose control is inadequate. An HbA1c <7.2% is considered good
control, but an acceptable levels for most procedures would be <9%.
Even with a good HbA1c level, the preoperative glucose level (and if
>200 mg/dL, the urine ketones) should always be measured, as the perioperative treatment is based on this and some stabilization before administration of an anesthetic may be required, particularly in an emergency
situation.

Perioperative management
Ideally, patients with diabetes are best operated on in the morning at the
start of the list.
Patients normally on diet alone should have their capillary blood glucose
levels checked hourly. IV dextrose, should be avoided in these patients.
Often no other modiﬁcation to their treatment is needed.
Patients taking oral agents should stop metformin for at least 48 hours
preoperatively and miss their other agents on the morning of the procedure. Capillary blood glucose levels are again monitored regularly (every
1–2 hours) and insulin IV infusion may be started if necessary.

SKIN, CONNECTIVE TISSUE, OR JOINT DISEASE

In patients taking insulin who are undergoing a morning operation, from
0 to one-half of the morning insulin dose might be given and IV insulin infusion may be started. The aim is to keep the blood glucose in the
120–180 mg/dL range.
Every hospital in the United States has developed insulin infusion protocols used in the intensive care unit (ICU) in pre-, peri- and postoperative
patients as well as in patients on enteral and parenteral nutrition.

Skin, connective tissue, or joint disease
Skin
Diabetes results in an i occurrence of infections such as vaginal candida,
Candida balanitis, and Staphylococcus aureus folliculitis. Ulceration in the
feet due to neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease should also be
considered. Other skin features to look for include the following.
Conditions speciﬁc to diabetes
• Pretibial diabetic dermopathy—shin spots
• Diabetic bullae—bullosis diabeticorum, very rare tense blistering on
feet and lower legs classically
• Diabetic thick skin—cleroderma of diabetes seen in 2.5% with type 2
diabetes
• Periungual telangectasia—venous capillary dilatation at the nail fold
seen in up to 50% of people with diabetes
The most common skin lesion in diabetes is shin spots, or diabetic dermopathy. These occur more commonly in males than in females and affect
up to 50% of people with diabetes. Their etiology is uncertain.
They present initially as red papules and progress to give well-circumscribed atrophic areas that are brownish in color. Usually seen on the
shins, they can also be found on the forearms and thighs.
There is no effective treatment of these; they usually resolve spontaneously over 1–2 years.
Conditions seen more commonly in those with diabetes
• Necrobiosis lipoidica
• Vitiligo (seen in 2% with type 1 diabetes)
• Granuloma annulare (although this association is not proven
conclusively)
Necrobiosis lipoidica is seen in 0.3–1% of people with diabetes, and
40–60% of those with necrobiosis also have diabetes. It is more common
in females than in males.
Classically seen on the shins, it has an atrophic centre with telangectasia
around the edge of an oval or irregular lesion, although early lesions can
be dull red plaques or papules.
Treatment with topical or injectable steroids may help improve these
lesions; skin grafting and cosmetic camouﬂage have also been used.

649

650

CHAPTER 111

Intercurrent events or disease

Conditions associated with the other biochemical features
seen in diabetes
• Acanthosis nigricans—with insulin resistance
• Eruptive xanthomata—with hypertriglyceridemia
When looking at the skin do not forget to check injection sites for lipohypertrophy or lipoatrophy as these are often much more amenable to
treatment or correction. In the past, an insulin allergy rash was also commonly seen, but more recently a transient local reaction, thought to be an
IgE-mediated reaction, is more often seen.

Connective tissue and joint disease
Diabetes is associated with an i incidence of pseudogout and osteoarthritis, but the classical condition to consider is the “stiff hand syndrome,” or
diabetic cheiroarthropathy.
In this disorder, the skin thickens and tightens, which, in association
with sclerosis of the tendon sheaths, results in limited joint mobility in the
hands and, less commonly, the feet. This reduced joint mobility leads to an
inability to place the palms of the hand ﬂat together and make the “prayer
sign.” No speciﬁc treatment for this currently exists.

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS

Emergencies in diabetes

Diabetic ketoacidosis
Diabetic ketoacidosis has a mortality of 2–5%. Many deaths occur from
delays in presentation and initiation of treatment. It has a mortality rate of
up to 50% in the elderly.

Diagnosis
This is usually based on a collection of biochemical abnormalities:
• Hyperglycemia >200 mg/dL
• Acidosis arterial pH <7.3, serum bicarbonate <15 mmol/L, base excess
<–10
• Ketonuria. Some dip testing methods only check for acetoacetate and
acetone but not B-hydroxybutyrate. Captopril can also give a falsepositive test for urinary acetone. Ketones may interfere with some
creatinine assays and give falsely high readings.
There is an uncommon condition of euglycemic ketoacidosis (in 1–3% of
cases at most) when ketones are produced early on in patients with a
reduced carbohydrate intake. Blood glucose is <300 mg/dL, acidosis is
marked, and dehydration is not usually severe. Clinical features are listed
in Box 112.1.

Box 112.1 Clinical features of diabetic ketoacidosis
Polyuria, polydypsia, and weight loss are often seen. Muscle cramps,
abdominal pain, and shortness of breath (air hunger or Kussmaul’s
breathing, with deep, regular, rapid breaths, suggesting acidosis) can also
occur. Subsequent nausea and vomiting can worsen both the dehydration and electrolyte losses that often precede the onset of coma (occurring in about 10% of cases).
Consider other causes of coma and a raised blood glucose level, such
as head injury, alcohol, and drug overdose.
On examination, the breath can smell of ketones (like nail-varnish
remover). Postural hypotension (exacerbated by peripheral vasodilatation due to acidosis) and hypothermia are also frequently seen. Infection
and trauma can precipitate this problem and should be carefully looked
for, especially in the unconscious patient.
Hypovolemia at presentation is usually at least 5 L, along with electrolyte losses of 300–700 mmol of sodium, 200–700 mmol of potassium,
and 350–500 mmol of chloride. The daily intake of both sodium and
potassium is 60 mmol, so the severity of this condition is apparent

651

652

CHAPTER 112

Emergencies in diabetes

Initial treatment is to start oral carbohydrate intake and monitor the
need for IV insulin/ﬂuids as in full-blown hyperglycemic ketoacidosis.

Epidemiology
Diabetic ketoacidosis is common in patients with type 1 diabetes. The
incidence is 5–8/1000 diabetic patients per year, usually patients with type
1 diabetes. Up to 25% of cases are patients with newly diagnosed or presenting diabetes, some of whom subsequently obtain adequate control
with oral agents or diet alone.
In up to 50% of cases an infection is the precipitant, and in 10–30% of
cases it is their ﬁrst presentation with diabetes.

Pathogenesis
Diabetic ketoacidosis occurs as a result of insulin deﬁciency and counterregulatory hormone excess. Insulin deﬁciency results in excess mobi
lization of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. This provides the substrate
for ketone production from the liver. Ketones (B-hydroxy-butyrate, acetoacetate, and acetone) are excreted by the kidneys and buffered in the
blood initially, but once this system fails, acidosis develops.
Hyperglycemia also occurs, as the liver produces glucose from lactate
and alanine generated by muscle proteinolysis. The reduced peripheral
glucose utilization associated with insulin deﬁciency exacerbates this.
Hyperglycemia and ketonuria cause an osmotic diuresis and hypovolemia with both intracellular and extracellular dehydration. Glomerular
ﬁltration is reduced and blood glucose levels thus rise even further, as do
the levels of counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon.
The metabolic acidosis due to ketone accumulation leads to widespread
cell death that, combined with hypovolemia, is fatal if untreated.

Management
Having ﬁrst assessed the need for immediate resuscitation and started a
0.9% saline IV infusion, take a history and examine the patient to look for
obvious precipitants, such as surgery, trauma, sites of infection, or myocardial infarction (Box 112.2). While initial investigations will be modiﬁed
by the history and examination and suggested site of infection, they should
include at least the following:
• Blood for urea/electrolytes (note ketone/creatinine assay interaction)
• CBC (a leukocytosis can occur without infection)
• Arterial blood gases (PaCO2 will be low due to hyperventilation with a
metabolic acidosis; check pH and bicarbonate)
• Cultures of blood and urine
• Chest X-rays and ECG
• In the older patient (>40 years), also include an ECG and cardiac
enzymes, even if asymptomatic.
Replacement of ﬂuids, electrolytes, and insulin is the mainstay of treatment, along with treatment of any precipitant, such as infection. To monitor this treatment, central venous access and urinary catheterization are
often necessary and an NG tube may be useful, especially in the unconscious patient.

DIABETIC KETOACIDOSIS

Box 112.2 Precipitants of diabetic ketoacidosis

(i.e., errors by patient or doctor)
• Newly diagnosed diabetes
• Myocardial infarction

30–40%
25%
13%
10–20%
1%

In elderly people, those with a cardiac history, or those with autonomic
neuropathy, central venous access is imperative.
Monitoring
Once treatment has commenced, monitor ﬂuid balance carefully and
avoid ﬂuid overload. Check capillary blood glucose hourly, serum potassium, sodium, and glucose every 2 hours, and arterial blood gases every
2–4 hours depending on response.
Reduce the frequency of tests once the patient is stabilized, but check
electrolytes at least daily for the ﬁrst 72 hours. Continuous ECG monitoring will aid in detection of hypo- and hyperkalemia in the acute phase.
Magnesium and phosphate levels should also be checked, as these can
occasionally require replacement therapy.
Additional therapies
IV bicarbonate is only rarely indicated, as it can cause hypokalemia and
paradoxically worsen intracellular acidosis. If used, give only when the pH
is <6.9 using 250 mL of 1.26% bicarbonate given over 30–60 minutes initially. Monitor arterial blood gases to assess response, aiming for pH no
greater than 7.1.
This should probably only be used in an intensive care setting. Do not
use 8.4% bicarbonate, as its high sodium load can too rapidly alter electrolyte levels and precipitate pulmonary edema as well as cause local tissue
necrosis if it extravasates.
In severe hypotension unresponsive to colloids and crystalloids, inotropes may be required, but agents such as dopamine, dobutamine, and
adrenaline will all exacerbate insulin resistance, necessitating a more
aggressive sliding-scale regime.
Heparin in SC prophylactic doses can be given in the unconscious or
immobile patent.
Cover with IV broad-spectrum antibiotics should be used if no obvious
precipitant is found and appropriate antibiotics used if a site of infection
is found.
Cerebral edema typically presents 8–24 hours after starting IV ﬂuids
with a declining conscious level and can have a mortality rate as high as
90%. If this occurs, dexamethasone (12–16 mg/day) and mannitol (1–2 g/kg
body weight) may be given.

653

654

CHAPTER 112

Emergencies in diabetes

Subsequent treatment
Once the blood glucose is stable in the 180–270 mg/dL range, the ketoacidosis has settled, and the patient is eating and drinking normally, consider
switching to a SC insulin regimen, but overlap the IV and the ﬁrst SC dose
by 2 hours. Stabilize the patient on this therapy before discharge from
the hospital.
Once the IV potassium supplements have been stopped, give oral supplements for at least 48 hours with regular serum monitoring.
Patient education on determining the cause and avoiding a further
occurrence, or on earlier presentation if it does occur, should also ideally
be given before discharge.

Initial treatment of ketoacidosis
IV 0.9% saline
• 2 L in 2 hours, then 1 L over 2 hours, 2 L in next 8 hours, and 4 L/
day thereafter until blood glucose is <200 mg/dL. Then convert to
dextrose saline or 5% dextrose.
If the patient is profoundly shocked (e.g., systolic BP <80 mmHg with
severe dehydration or sepsis) or oliguric, this dosage may need to be given
more rapidly and colloids may also be needed. If the patient is elderly or
there are signs of heart failure or cerebral edema, it may need to be given
more slowly.
Potassium
Once the serum potassium is known, potassium is added to the 0.9%
saline. The dose of potassium is adjusted on the basis of hourly serum
potassium measurements until the patient is stable, and measured every
2–4 hours over the next 12–24 hours. Add the following:
• 40 mmol/L if K+ <3.0 mmol/L
• 30 mmol/L if K+ 3.0–4.0 mmol/L
• 20 mmol/L if K+ 4.1–5.0 mmol/L
• 10 mmol/L if K+ 5.1–6.0 mmol/L
• None if K+>6.0 mmol/L
Insulin (via continuous IV infusion)
Every hospital in the United States has developed IV insulin infusion protocols. Following these protocols is mandatory and the safest way of administering insulin IV.

HYPEROSMOLAR, NONKETOTIC HYPERGLYCEMIA

Hyperosmolar, nonketotic
hyperglycemia
This is a more sinister complication than ketoacidosis with a mortality rate
as high as 50%. It is found in 11–30% of adult hyperglycemic emergencies.
It affects an older population than that with ketoacidosis (middle-aged or
elderly), 2/3 of cases are in patients with previously undiagnosed diabetes,
and its insidious onset can be mistaken for many other conditions, including stroke. See Box 112.3 for clinical features.

Diagnosis
This is again a biochemical diagnosis:
• Hyperglycemia (usually 30–70 mmol/L)
• Serum osmolality is high (>350 mmol/kg)
• No acidosis arterial pH 7.35–7.45, serum bicarbonate >18 mmol/L, but
lactic acidosis with infection or a myocardial infarction may alter this.
• No ketonuria + on urine dip testing can occur with starvation and
vomiting.
Serum osmolality (in mosmol/kg) can be calculated if not available from
the laboratory using the following equation:
Osmolality = 2(sodium + potassium) + glucose + urea

Epidemiology
This condition occurs in an older age group of insulin-producing type 2
patients, a large proportion of whom will not previously be known to
have diabetes.
Ingestion of high-sugar-containing drinks, intercurrent infection, and
myocardial infarction are all commonly seen as precipitants of this condition. Drugs such as glucocorticoids, cimetidine, phenytoin, thiazide, and
loop diuretics are all implicated in the pathogenesis of this problem.

Pathogenesis
This condition results from a combination of insulin deﬁciency and counterregulatory hormone excess. The insulin present stops ketone production but in insufﬁcient quantities to prevent worsening hyperglycemia.

Box 112.3 Clinical features of hyperosmolar, nonketotic
hyperglycemia
There is normally an insidious onset with several days of ill health and
profound dehydration at presentation (equivalent to a 9–10 L deﬁcit).
Confusion is not uncommon, nor is coma (especially once serum osmolality >440). Occasionally, ﬁts occur.
Gastroparesis and associated vomiting with gastric erosions and subsequent hematemesis can occur. These patients are also hypercoagulable, and venous thromboses and cerebrovascular events are important
to exclude.

655

656

CHAPTER 112

Emergencies in diabetes

Management
Initial investigation and treatment are the same as for ketoacidosis, with
ﬂuid, electrolyte, and insulin replacement, although there are a few important exceptions as these are older patients:
• The ﬂuid regimen should be less rapid and vigorous. Central venous
access for monitoring is more often required, e.g., 1 L of 0.9% saline
over the ﬁrst hour, 1 L q2h for the next 2 hours, then 1 L q4–6h.
• If hypernatremic (serum sodium >155 mmol/L) consider 0.45% saline,
rather than 0.9%, although this may increase the risk of cerebral edema
if serum sodium or osmolality is altered too rapidly, which has a
mortality as high as 70%.
• Prophylactic SC heparin should be considered, although recent
evidence suggests more formal anticoagulation carries a high risk of
upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
• A gentler insulin regimen is needed, with 3–6 units/hour of soluble insulin
IV, aiming to reduce the blood glucose by a maximum of 5 mmol/h to
avoid precipitating cerebral edema.
• A more aggressive use of IV antibiotics is encouraged.
Subsequent treatment
Continue IV ﬂuids and insulin for at least 24 hours after initial stabilization and then convert to maintenance therapy such as SC insulin or oral
hypoglycemic agents. Patient education on how to avoid further episodes
is also advisable.

Hypoglycemia
This complication of the treatment of diabetes should be excluded in any
unconscious or relevant patient. If prolonged it can result in death. Most
insulin-treated patients can expect to experience hypoglycemic episodes
at some time, with up to 1/7 having a more severe episode each year and
3% suffering recurrent episodes. The 25% of people on long-term insulin
who lose their hypoglycemic awareness are of particular concern.
Nocturnal hypoglycemic episodes with a hyperglycemic response the
next morning (due to i counterregulatory hormones—the Somogyi
phenomenon), which tend to occur in younger insulin-treated patients,
should be assessed for and may only present with morning headaches or
a drunken feeling.

Diagnosis
This is a biochemical diagnosis from a blood glucose <50 mg/dL, but is
often ﬁrst picked up by the patient, their family, or their doctor from the
clinical features listed in Box 112.4.
Saving serum before treatment for blood glucose, insulin, and C-peptide
levels will conﬁrm the diagnosis and may help determine the cause.

HYPOGLYCEMIA

Box 112.4 Clinical features
The features of hypoglycemia can be divided into two main groups: autonomic symptoms and neuroglycopenic symptoms, as shown in Box 112.5.
The autonomic symptoms usually occur ﬁrst (when the blood glucose
is <65 mg/dL), but some drugs, such as the nonselective B-blockers,
and alcohol may mask these with neuroglycopenia (at blood glucose
<46 mg/dL), causing confusion with no warning. Some patients lose
these predominantly autonomic warning symptoms and are therefore
at higher risk of injury.

Box 112.5 Signs and symptoms of hypoglycemia
Autonomic
• Sweating
• Pallor
• Anxiety
• Nausea
• Tremor
• Shivering
• Palpitations
• Tachycardia

Neuroglycopenia
• Confusion
• Tiredness
• Lack of concentration
• Headache
• Dizziness
• Altered speech
• Incoordination
• Drowsiness
• Aggression
• Coma

Pathogenesis
Hypoglycemia results from an imbalance between glucose supply, glucose
utilization, and insulin levels that results in more insulin than is needed at
that time.
A reduced glucose supply occurs when a meal or snack is missed, or as
a late effect of alcohol. It can also be due to delayed gastric emptying with
autonomic neuropathy or be associated with celiac disease, Addison’s disease, or an acute illness, such as gastroenteritis.
Increased utilization occurs with exercise and high insulin levels mostly
with sulfonylurea or exogenous insulin therapy. The net result of this
imbalance is hypoglycemia.
Human insulins have a slightly faster onset of action and a shorter duration of action than their animal predecessors, and a lot of patients report
alterations in hypoglycemic awareness when they switch from one form
to the other. Even so, no deﬁnite evidence of speciﬁc hypoglycemic alterations due to human insulin itself has been reported.
Sulfonylurea therapy can cause hypoglycemia due to B-cell stimulation.
This is most commonly seen from glibenclamide, especially in the elderly
and those with reduced renal excreting ability, but can occur in anyone
who takes this therapy and fasts.

CHAPTER 112

Emergencies in diabetes

The biguanide metformin and the A-glucosidase inhibitor acarbose are
unlikely to precipitate hypoglycemia.

Management
In the conscious patient, oral carbohydrate (20–30 g) is often sufﬁcient to
resolve the problem. This can be given as 5–6 glucose tablets or as a glass
of milk or orange juice. Having raised the sugar rapidly, the patient should
then eat something to maintain a normal blood glucose.
In the confused patient, a buccal gel (e.g., GlucoGel®, a 30% glucose
gel) is an alternative, although this should not be used in the unconscious
patient as there is a risk of aspiration.
In the unconscious patient, once a blood sample has been taken for
glucose estimation, treat with 25–50 mL of 50% glucose IV or 1 mg of IM
or deep SC glucagon. Glucagon mobilizes glycogen from the liver and will
not work if given repeatedly or in starved patients with no glycogen stores.
In this situation or if prolonged treatment is needed, IV glucose is better
(50% initially then 10%).
The worry with 50% glucose is tissue necrosis if extravasation occurs.
Subsequent management
Having corrected the acute event, determine why it happened and, if possible, alter treatment or lifestyle to prevent recurrance. Extreme exercise
may require an alteration in insulin doses for 24 hours, and alcohol causes
not only initial hyperglycemia but also a degree of hypoglycemia 3–6 hours
after ingestion, and may alter insulin requirements the next morning.
Education on how to avoid precipitating hypoglycemic episodes in
these situations is advisable. Recurrent hypoglycemic events may also herald deterioration in renal or liver function; these conditions should be
excluded.
Patients on long-acting sulfonylureas who experience hypoglycemia will
need careful monitoring, as the drug may last longer than the glucose
or glycogen given to correct it and repeated hypoglycemic episodes may
occur. A continuous IV glucose infusion is therefore often needed in this
situation, particularly in overdose with these agents.

Lipids and coronary
heart disease

Physiology
The two main circulating lipids, triglycerides and cholesterol, are bound
with phospholipid and lipoproteins to make them more water soluble
for transportation throughout the body. The apoproteins on the surface
of these soluble masses help the body to recognize each of the different
transport complexes.
Chylomicrons
These contain 85% triglycerides and 4% cholesterol. Made in the mucosa
of the small intestine, they are broken down in the liver and peripheral tissues by lipoprotein lipase. Initially they contain apoprotein B-48 (apo B-48)
but also acquire apo E and apo C-II from circulating HDL.
Following metabolism by lipoprotein lipase in capillary endothelial cells,
which is activated by apo C-II, chylomicron remnants are then removed by
speciﬁc apo B and apo E receptors in the liver.
Very low–density lipoproteins (VLDLs)
VLDLs contain 50% triglyceride, 15% cholesterol, and 18% phospholipid.
They are the main carrier of triglycerides in circulation. Made with triglycerides synthesized in the liver, they also contain apo B-100 and apo E.
VLDLs are broken down by lipoprotein lipase in peripheral tissue to
give IDLs, or other remnants that are removed by the liver.
Intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs)
These VLDL remnants contain mostly cholesterol and phospholipid and
are either removed by the liver or metabolized to form LDLs.
Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs)
LDLs contain 45% cholesterol, 10% triglycerides, and 20% phospholipid.
LDL has apo B-100 in its surface and transports most of the cholesterol
in circulation.
The liver has speciﬁc LDL receptors to extract it from the circulation.
Half of the body’s circulating LDL is removed from the plasma each day,
mostly by the liver. Small dense or oxidized LDL (usually only 15% of the
LDL pool) is not so easily recognized by these receptors and a scavenger
pathway in macrophages and liver sinusoidal endothelial cells removes
these via an acetyl-LDL receptor.
Accumulation of oxidized LDL in macrophages produces the foam cells
seen in atheromatous plaques.

PATHOGENESIS

High-density lipoproteins (HDLs)
HDLs are made in the liver and gut and contain 17% cholesterol, 4% triglycerides, and 24% phospholipid. HDL transports 20–50% of circulating
cholesterol.
In practice, patients are managed by their levels of cholesterol (total
[TC], LDL, HDL) and triglycerides. Elevated total or LDL cholesterol
with normal triglycerides is hypercholesterolemia. Isolated elevation of
triglycerides is hypertriglyceridemia; both together is combined or mixed
hyperlipidemia.
There is a direct linear relationship between hypercholesterolemia and
coronary heart disease (CHD). A man with a TC of 250 mg/dL has double
the risk of CHD of a man with a TC of 201 mg/dL and half the risk of a man
with a cholesterol of 302 mg/dL. Intervention studies show that reductions
in total and LDL cholesterol reduce coronary and cerebrovascular events,
as well as mortality.
HDL cholesterol has an inverse relationship with CHD, i.e., increased
levels are beneﬁcial. A low HDL cholesterol may be due to lack of physical
exercise, obesity, or the presence of hypertriglyceridemia and occurs in
smokers and the metabolic syndrome.1 Whether isolated hypertriglyceridemia causes vascular disease is still debated.
Mixed hyperlipidemia is clearly associated with CHD. The Helsinki
Heart Study2 showed a 4-fold greater risk of cardiac events if the LDL:HDL
ratio was >5.0 and the triglycerides >203 mg/dL compared to the rate for
those with lower levels of triglycerides.
Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a low HDL cholesterol level as
well as small, dense LDL particles. The aim of keeping triglycerides <132
mg/dL is to indirectly increase the HDL cholesterol as well as for the small,
dense LDL to revert to the more benign, less dense LDL.
Small, dense LDL has a lower binding afﬁnity for the LDL receptor,
resulting in a longer t½ as well as greater susceptibility to oxidation.

Pathogenesis
Hyperlipidemia is due to a combination of genetic factors and dietary
intake and is secondary to other conditions. It is a major risk factor for
atherosclerosis.
• Primary hyperlipidemias are usually genetically determined.
• Secondary hyperlipidemias are due to a combination of other diseases,
drugs, and dietary anomalies.

CHAPTER 113

Lipids and coronary heart disease

Atherosclerosis
In atherosclerosis, subintimal plaques start in medium-sized blood vessel walls when LDL cholesterol accumulates. A cholesterol-rich necrotic
core surrounded by smooth muscle cells and ﬁbrous tissue then develops.
These plaques can calcify. If the surface of the plaque ulcerates, thrombosis occurs, which can obliterate the lumen of a blood vessel.
Plaques may result from diffusion of elevated LDL cholesterol, a qualitative abnormality of LDL cholesterol, endothelial cell damage, or a combination of these. Endothelial cell damage may be due to the following:
• Physical trauma, e.g., with hypertension
• Toxins, e.g., tobacco or alcohol
• Low-grade infection or inﬂammation, e.g., Chlamydia
• Immune complex damage

CHD/atherosclerosis risk factors
Male sex, iage, and a positive family history are all linked with a greater
risk for atherosclerosis, but these factors are beyond our control. Several
modiﬁable risk factors are, however, recognized:
• Cigarette smoking >10 cigarettes/day increase the CHD odds ratio by
6.7-fold, while stopping smoking reduces risk of myocardial infarction
(MI) by 50–70% within 5 years.
• Hypertension increases the CHD odds ratio by 2.7-fold. Each 1 mmHg
drop in diastolic blood pressure reduces the MI risk by 2–3%. Aspirin
reduces MI risk by 33%.
• Diabetes mellitus (b see Epidemiology, p. 605)
• Hyperlipidemia: A 10% fall in total cholesterol results in a 25% decrease
in CHD risk, and plaque regression with reducing lipids is well
documented.
• Other: Less strongly associated factors include type A personality,
hyperuricemia, lack of exercise or sedentary lifestyle, and obesity.

ASSESSMENT OF CHD RISK

Assessment of CHD risk
According to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines, lipid-lowering therapy should be based on a person’s absolute risk for CHD. This risk
for CHD is divided into three categories: established CHD and CHD risk
equivalents, multiple (2+) risk factors, and 0–1 risk factor.
Risk factors include cigarette smoking, hypertension (BP >140/90 mmHg
or on antihypertensive therapy), HDL <40 mg/dL, family history of premature CHD (<55 years for males and <65 years for females, and age
(men 45 years and women 55 years old).
One risk factor is subtracted from the count for an HDL >60 mg/dL.
CHD risk equivalents include diabetes and clinical atherosclerotic diseases such as peripheral arterial disease and carotid artery disease.
If an individual is noted to have multiple (2+) risk factors for CHD, a
10-year risk assessment for CHD should be carried out using Framingham
risk scoring (see Tables 113.1 for men and 113.2 for women). The number
of points for each risk factor is ﬁrst calculated (risk factors include age,
smoking, TC, HDL, and systolic BP), then management is determined on
the basis of risk (see Chapter 116, p. 677).

Lipid measurements
Measurements should not be taken during an acute illness or during periods
of rapid weight loss as these artiﬁcially lower the results. It is therefore recommended to measure a full lipid proﬁle 8–12 weeks after the acute event.
However, according to the ATP III guidelines, a lipid analysis should be
measured within 24 hours of an acute coronary event. This analysis is to
serve as a guideline for initiating therapy in these individuals in which LDL
lowering is crucial.
Pregnancy or recent weight gain will increase lipid levels. Following
rapid weight gain or weight loss, at least one month should pass before
reassessing lipid levels.
Full lipid proﬁle
This gives the following:
• TC
• HDL cholesterol
• LDL cholesterol
• Triglycerides

CHAPTER 113

Lipids and coronary heart disease

This should be a fasting sample, preferably after a 9- to 12-hour1 overnight
fast (water is allowed). If nonfasting, only TC and HDL cholesterol measurements are accurate. Triglycerides rise postprandially and LDL is usually
calculated with the formula below, so is inaccurate if not fasting. It is also
invalid if triglycerides are >400 mg/dL:
LDL (in mg/dL) = TC – HDL – (TG/5)
ATP III introduced a new secondary target for patients with elevated triglycerides 200 mg/dL, non-HDL-C:`
TC-HDL = LDL + VLDL= non-HDL-C
The goal for non-HDL-C is 30 mg/dL above the LDL goal.1

FAMILIAL HYPERCHOLESTEROLEMIA (FH)

Primary hyperlipidemias

Background
There are two distinct elements in the diagnosis of primary hyperlipidemias:
the genotype and the phenotype. The family history and the phenotypic
ﬁndings in other family members are used as a surrogate for a genetic
diagnosis. DNA-based technology currently employed in research can be
clinically useful, not just for initial diagnosis but also for family screening.

Polygenic hypercholesterolemia
This is the most common cause of isolated hypercholesterolemia. LDL
clearance appears to be reduced by a variety of mechanisms, and the E4
allele of apo E is a common association. Patients do not have the characteristic xanthelasmata or extensor tendon deposits (xanthomata) seen in
familial hyperlipidemia.
It is usually diagnosed by primary screening programs or when investigating some manifestation of atherosclerosis.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH)
FH is an autosomal dominant disorder. Its gene frequency is 1 in 500 in
Western Europe and North America.
In FH, hypercholesterolemia is mainly (>95%) due to an increase in LDL
cholesterol because of an LDL receptor mutation (on the short arm of
chromosome 19) reducing the number of high-afﬁnity LDL receptors by
up to 50%, so reducing LDL clearance and thus prolonging the circulating
time before catabolism from the normal 2.5 days to >4.5 days.
More than 1000 mutations have so far been described. Less commonly,
FH is due to familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (3–4%) and proprotein
convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 gene (PCSK9) mutation (<1%).
These can lead to several situations causing elevation of circulating LDL
cholesterol by
• Not producing any LDL receptors.
• Failure of LDL receptors to move to the cell surface.
• Abnormal binding of the receptor to LDL.
• Inability to adequately internalize LDL for metabolism.
Patients with FH have premature CHD (i.e., men <55 years old, women
<65 years old) and must be treated vigorously, as their standardized mortality ratio is at least 9 x greater than normal.

669

670

CHAPTER 114

Primary hyperlipidemias

Clinical characterization
• TC >300 mg/dL (>481 mg/dL in homozygotes), LDL is high from birth.
• Normal triglycerides
• Clinical stigmata: xanthelasmic deposits around the eyes and on the
tendons (i.e., ﬁngers, hands, elbow, knee, and the Achilles tendon)
Tendon xanthoma is more speciﬁc for FH than corneal arcus or xanthelasma. 7% of heterozygote FH patients (aged >19 years of age) have tendon
xanthomas, although 75% of their parents exhibit this feature. Separate
studies suggest 75% of males and 72% of females with homozygous FH
have tendon xanthomas. It is important to note that tendon xanthomata
may not be present until after 40 years of age.
Early onset of a corneal arcus (in the 30- to 40-year age group) may
occur.
Achilles tendonitis in childhood may be the ﬁrst clue to the presence
of FH.
Homozygotes can have CHD presenting in childhood and certainly
before the age of 30. Heterozygotes usually present after 30 years of age.
A strong case can be made for FH where there may not be clinical
stigmata but there is a strong family history and ﬁrst-degree relatives with
early-onset CHD, e.g., before 50 years of age.
It is estimated that >50% of heterozygous FH patients will die from
CHD before reaching 60 years of age if left untreated. One in 20 patients
under 60 years old surviving an MI are FH heterozygotes.
FH patients need to have their families investigated and the homozygous
FH may need nonpharmacological therapies, such as plasmapheresis, or
surgical procedures such as ileal bypass, portocaval shunts, or liver transplantation. These treatments are not readily available and, along with
pharmacological treatments, may be superseded by gene therapy in the
future.
Screening is by measurement of blood lipids and looking for clinical
stigmata or signs. It should involve immediate family members and can be
done at any age.
In newborn infants, cord blood has been used to look at LDL cholesterol levels, but this screening method may be unreliable, especially in
heterozygote FH.
Screening children is best carried out before 10 years of age, and then
again at adolescence and early childhood. Between the ages of 1 and 16
years, heterozygotes will have a 2-fold higher cholesterol level than that of
unaffected siblings, so standard lipid proﬁles can be used.
Over 16 years of age, a full fasting lipid proﬁle and clinical examination
should be used.

RARE GENETIC HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIAS

Familial defective apolipoprotein
B-100 (FDB)
FDB is an autosomal dominant trait in which a genetic defect of apo B-100
results in the delayed clearance of cholesterol. It is due to a single point
mutation on apo B (e.g., Arg 3500 l Gln). This condition affects about
1/600 people.
All lipids originating from the liver are bound to apo B-100. Two different mutations have also been described that result in i levels of an LDL
more prone to oxidation, causing delayed receptor pathway clearance of
LDL, which overloads the scavenger pathways, thereby increasing circulating cholesterol levels.
The diagnosis is made on slowly rising cholesterol levels and DNA studies for the point mutation. The management is similar to that of FH. 2% of
cases previously described as FH are estimated to be due to FDB. Protease
inhibitors have been reported to exacerbate this condition, which may
present with eruptive xanthomata.

Familial hypertriglyceridemia
This affects up to 1/300 people, often as an autosomal dominant
trait with elevated VLDL levels, and is frequently accompanied by
hypercholesterolemia.
Eruptive xanthomata (red and painful) and lipemia retinalis can accompany massive triglyceridemia, as can pancreatitis.
Exacerbating factors include alcohol and drugs such as thiazide diuretics,
glucocorticoids, and the oral contraceptive pill.
Adherence to a low-fat, alcohol-free diet with weight reduction usually
helps.

Rare genetic hypertriglyceridemias
Two rare but important familial causes of gross hypertriglyceridemia are
lipoprotein lipase deﬁciency and apolipoprotien C-II deﬁciency. Both are
autosomal recessive conditions that present in childhood and are characterized by the presence of hyperchylomicronemia.
Lipoprotein lipase is the enzyme needed to metabolize chylomicrons;
complete absence of this enzyme and production of an inactive form are
both recognized defects. A usually heterozygous, but much rarer and
more severe homozygous form is also seen.
Apo C-II is needed for the activation of lipoprotein lipase, and its deﬁciency results in hyperchylomicronemia. Patients do not have premature
CHD but can have recurrent abdominal pain due to pancreatitis.

671

672

CHAPTER 114

Primary hyperlipidemias

Familial combined hyperlipidemia
(FCHL)
FCHL is a deﬁnite risk factor for CHD. It occurs in 1/250 people.
Patients usually present around 10 years later than those with FH. The
etiology is not yet known.
It is the most common type of inherited dyslipidemia, estimated to
cause 10% of cases of premature CHD.
It has no unique clinical manifestations and the diagnosis is based on
raised lipids (>95th centile for age) and a family history of premature CHD
in ﬁrst-degree relatives.

Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia
This is also known as type III hyperlipidemia or broad beta disease. It is
associated with early-onset CHD.
It is an uncommon disorder affecting 0.01–0.04% of people, with elevated IDL and chylomicron remnants.
A characteristic clinical feature is the presence of palmar striae xanthoma (orange-yellow discolorations of the palmar creases). Tuberous
xanthomata, found over the tuberosities of the elbows and knees, may
also be present. The xanthomata of this familial disease can also be found
in pressure areas, e.g., heels.
Apo E is a constituent lipoprotein of IDL that has three genetically
determined isoforms: E2, E3, and E4.
• E3/E3 occurs in 55% of people, E2/E2 occurs in 1%.
• E2 has the lowest binding afﬁnity to the apo receptors and is therefore
cleared from serum mostly slowly.
• Apo E4 has the greatest afﬁnity and is more rapidly cleared.
• Patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia are phenotype E2/E2.

RARE FAMILIAL MIXED DYSLIPIDEMIAS

Rare familial mixed dyslipidemias
These should be considered in any patient with unexplained neurological
symptoms, organomegaly, or corneal opacities.
Two inborn metabolic disorders associated with atherosclerosis are as
follows:
• Apolipoprotein A1-CIII deﬁciency: should be suspected if hyperlipidemia
is corrected within 24 hours of infusing 500 mL of normal fresh frozen
plasma
• Familial lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deﬁciency: In this
recessively inherited disorder, an enzyme necessary for intravascular
lipoprotein metabolism is deﬁcient, resulting in elevated cholesterol
and triglycerides. Clinically, corneal lipid deposits result in visual
disturbances and renal deposits in glomerular damage, proteinuria, and,
often, renal failure.
The following disorders are not linked to the occurrence of premature
atheroma formation:
• Tangier disease (analphalipoproteinemia or familial alphalipoprotein
deﬁciency): In this autosomal recessive condition, apo A-I, which is
found on HDL, is deﬁcient. HDL level is low (<5 mg/dL), as is TC,
while triglycerides are normal or high. Cholesterol accumulation gives
enlarged, orange tonsils, hepatosplenomegaly, polyneuropathy, and
corneal opacities.
• Fish eye disease: a rare disorder from northern Sweden characterized
by high VLDL levels, low HDL, fasting hypertriglyceridemia, and a
triglyceride rich LDL. It is a variant of familial LCAT deﬁciency. Dense
corneal opacities occur, resulting in visual impairment.
• Abetalipoproteinemia: results in fat accumulation due to failure of apo
B-100 production. Cholesterol levels are low with, in many cases,
no LDL and VLDL. This results in fat accumulation in the gut and
nerves. Vitamin E injections may prevent some of the neurological
abnormalities observed (ataxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, and motor plus
sensory neuropathies), but usually not the retinitis pigmentosa and
acanthocytes, which are also features.
• Hypobetalipoproteinemia: This autosomal dominantly inherited
condition gives a TC of 38.5–154 mg/dL and can be associated with
organomegaly and neurological changes in middle age due to fat
deposition and abnormal red cells. The homozygous state is similar to
abetalipoproteinemia.
• Hyperalphalipoproteinemia or HDL hyperlipoproteinemia: results in
mildly elevated HDL and TC, and may be beneﬁcial. No treatment is
needed; raised HDL can also occur with exercise, exogenous estrogen,
and phenytoin and phenobarbital use, or from alcohol.

Secondary hyperlipidemias

Secondary hyperlipidemias

Background
Secondary dyslipidemias are relatively common, accounting for 10–20%
of hyperlipidemic adults. These can give a mixed hyperlipidemia or a lone
increase in cholesterol or triglycerides.
There are multiple causes, and treatment is based on managing the primary disease before making a further decision on the raised lipids. Often
more than one cause is apparent in secondaryehyperlipidemias.

Causes
Causes include those described below and listed in Table 115.1.

CAUSES

Diet
Excessive consumption of saturated fats and carbohydrate can contribute
to this condition. Anorexia nervosa can also cause hypercholesterolemia,
as a strict low-fat, low-calorie diet results in reduced cholesterol and bile
acid turnover, thus increasing circulating levels.
Obesity
b See Clinical features (p. 528).
Diabetes mellitus
b See Lipid abnormalities found in patients with diabetes (p. 629).
Hypothyroidism
This is estimated to occur in 4% of those with hyperlipidemia, and compensated (subclinical) hypothyroidism in a further 10%. It usually results in
hypercholesterolemia with a TC of 349–776 mg/dL. It also worsens genetic dyslipidemias through d synthesis of hepatic LDL receptors.
Chronic renal disease
Increased creatinine clearance is accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia and
a reduction in HDL cholesterol. Proteinuria in the nephrotic syndrome is
associated with hypercholesterolemia. Peritoneal dialysis may increase gut
glucose load and worsen hypertriglyceridemia. Remember—cyclosporine
increases LDL cholesterol.
Liver disease
Cholestatic liver disease results in hypercholesterolemia. Primary biliary
cirrhosis produces marked increases in LDL and may elevate TC to >462
mg/dL. Severe hepatocellular damage may lower LDL cholesterol by d
production of its component parts and the enzymes that metabolize it.
Cushing’s syndrome
Glucocorticoids increase VLDL production and thus hypertriglyceridemia.
The associated weight gain and glucose intolerance can make this effect
more pronounced.
Lipodystrophies
This is a very rare group of congenital or acquired disorders whose hallmark is regional, partial, or generalized fat loss associated with hyperlipidemia, especially unusually raised triglycerides. They are also associated
with severe insulin resistance.
Glycogen storage diseases
Elevated lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol and mixed hyperlipidemia) are
common, but usually only in type I (Von Gierke disease), type III (Forbes
disease), and type IV (Hers disease).
Gout
Hypertriglyceridemia occurs in about one-third of those with gout. Alcohol
excess plays a part but it is not the sole cause.

675

676

CHAPTER 115

Secondary hyperlipidemias

Drugs
Medications commonly implicated are as follows:
• B-blockers, especially the noncardioselective ones
• Thiazide diuretics
• Exogenous estrogens
• Anabolic steroids
• Glucocorticoids
• Isotretinoin
• Protease inhibitors (said to cause hyperlipidemia in 50% after
10 months of treatment)
Excessive alcohol consumption
There is a J-shaped relationship between alcohol consumption and CHD.
The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends no more than
1 alcoholic drink per day for women, and 2 drinks per day for men.
Pregnancy
Cholesterol rises throughout pregnancy, mostly in the second trimester,
with LDL-C levels peaking mid-third trimester. Triglyceride levels follow a
similar pattern to that of LDL-C. Levels decrease by 6 weeks postpartum
but may take up to 1 year to return to normal.

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PREVENTION

Management of dyslipidemia

Background
The emphasis will depend on the cause of the hyperlipidemia and is aimed
at reducing cardiovascular, peripheral vascular, and cerebrovascular risk.
There are now recommended target values when treating patients.

Primary and secondary prevention
It is universally accepted that tackling hypercholesterolemia in secondary
prevention works. We now have solid evidence to support this, especially
in the context of CHD, where a 10% fall in TC is estimated to result in a
25% decrease in CHD risk.
Fatty lesion regression has also been clearly demonstrated. The gain is
within 2 years of lowering the cholesterol, whether by diet or a combination of diet and drugs.
Two groups need special mention: patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
and those with acute coronary syndrome. Both groups show early beneﬁt
with statin treatment (high-dose atorvastatin 80 mg).
In post-MI patients, omega-3 fatty acids are recommended as they
reduce the incidence of sudden death due to arrhythmias.
Tackling cholesterol in primary prevention is controversial. There have
been primary prevention trials showing beneﬁt from lowering cholesterol.
The ﬁnancial burden of this has to be confronted.

Speciﬁc interventions
Dietary advice
All patients should see a dietitian. Total fat intake should constitute <35%
of energy consumed (with the majority of fat intake being from polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats) and saturated fats must be <30% of
the total fat content. Vegetable and marine mono- and polyunsaturated
fats should be i in the diet. Total dietary cholesterol should not exceed
200 mg/day.
Foods advocated include fresh fruits and vegetables, which are also
important sources of antioxidants. These foods should be tried for 3
months to see if dietary manipulation will work (monitor at 6-week intervals). It is unusual to see >15% fall in cholesterol from dietary measures; a
reduction of 5% is more likely in free-living individuals on a diet.
Alcohol intake should be no more than 1 drink per day for a female and
no more than 2 drinks per day for a male. At this level, alcohol intake confers CHD protection in men >40 years old and postmenopausal women.

677

678

CHAPTER 116

Management of dyslipidemia

Plant sterols and stanols, 2 g daily, can reduce blood cholesterol by
10–15%. They are available commercially in enriched margarine spreads,
yogurt, and milky drinks.
Weight control
All overweight patients must be encouraged to lose weight. Weight
reduction is closely attuned to dietary advice and physical exercise. Most
weight is lost in the ﬁrst 4 months of a regimen. A 10 kg weight loss in
an obese subject can reduce LDL cholesterol by 7% and increases HDL
cholesterol by 13%.
Physical activity
Physical activity, especially aerobic exercise, is recommended. This should
involve moderate intensity exercise performed for a minimum of 30 minutes, at least 5 times per week.
Acute exercise will transiently change lipoprotein levels and increase
lipoprotein lipase activity. These effects become more permanent with
regular training.
Triglyceride levels fall, HDL cholesterol levels rise, especially the HDL2
subfraction, with more vigorous exercise, and the LDL cholesterol is of
the less-dense variety, which is not so atherogenic. The changes are dose
dependent with i exercise, and a 20% alteration in each variable is achievable after 6 weeks.
Modiﬁcation of other risk factors
Other risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes mellitus
must also be addressed.

Drug therapy
Numerous agents can be used for both primary and secondary prevention
in patients in whom diet has been ineffective.

HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins)
Indications
These include high LDL or VLDL, i.e., primary hypercholesterolemia,
heterozygous + homozygous FH, mixed hyperlipidemia. Not all of these
medications are licensed for use in children and should be used with caution in women of childbearing age because of insufﬁcient safety data on
pregnancy and of potential teratogenicity.
The medication should be stopped for at least 3 months before pregnancy
is planned. Women must be warned about pregnancy when on these drugs.
Mechanism of action
There is competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A
(HMG CoA), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Its
activation increases hepatocyte LDL receptor numbers and reduces VLDL
synthesis while enhancing its hepatic clearance.

116.2 for dosage.

Side effects
Statins are usually very well tolerated but are known to cause headaches,
nausea, and some abdominal discomfort. The main concerns are a hepatitis-like picture and myopathy.
LFTs and creatine kinase should be measured before statins are prescribed. They should be used with caution in those with excessive alcohol
intake. It is recommended that the medication be discontinued if liver
enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST) and/or alanine transaminase (ALT)
show >3-fold elevation above the upper limit of normal.
LFTs should be checked every 3–4 months initially and at least annually
in the long term. Statin-associated myopathy is rare and tends to occur
when prescribed with other medications, e.g., cyclosporine, ﬁbrates, or
macrolide antibiotics or when renal impairment or untreated hypothyroidism is present.
Clinically, there is a picture of swollen tender muscles and creatine
kinase >10 x the upper limit of normal. Rhabdomyolysis is even rarer.
Interactions
All statins can interact with cyclosporine and nicotinic acid and are used
with caution with ﬁbrates.
Warfarin interacts with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
Erythromycin interacts with all statins.
Digoxin interacts with atorvastatin and simvastatin. Rifampicin interacts
with ﬂuvastatin and pravastatin.
Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin may also interact with the oral contraceptive pill, antacids, and some antifungals.

Fibrates
Indications
These are high VLDL, triglycerides, or IDL, i.e., mixed hyperlipidemias that
have not responded adequately to diet or other therapy. These medications are less effective than the statins at lowering cholesterol but better
at i HDL cholesterol and more effective in lowering triglycerides.
Reduce triglycerides by 20–60%, increase HDL by 15–30%, and reduce
LDL by 5–25%.

679

680

CHAPTER 116

Management of dyslipidemia

Mechanism of action
Fibrates alter lipoprotein metabolism to reduce VLDL triglyceride synthesis by i lipoprotein lipase activity and LDL-receptor-mediated LDL clearance while increasing HDL synthesis.
The effect on LDL cholesterol may vary in isolated hypertriglyceridemia
to increase LDL cholesterol. b See Table 116.2 for dosage.
Side effects
Occasionally, ﬁbrates cause nausea, anorexia, or diarrhea and precipitate
gallstones (mostly cloﬁbrate, although this is not approved in the U.S.).
Also, pruritus, rashes, hair loss, and impotence can occur.
They should not be used in patients with severe liver disease (AST/ALT
>2–3 x upper limit of normal) and renal dysfunction (creatinine >2 mg/dL),
as they are conjugated in the liver prior to excretion by the kidney.
Myopathy, although rare, is the main concern, and the risk of this
increases if ﬁbrates are used with statins.

DRUG THERAPY

Interactions
Use with caution in combination with statins. Fibrates can enhance the
effects of warfarin and antidiabetic agents and are contraindicated in those
on orlistat.

Anion exchange resins (bile acid sequestrants)
Indications
These include high LDL, i.e., hypercholesterolemia. Although largely
superseded by statins, these are now best used as adjuncts when LDL has
not fallen enough with a statin alone. They are also the only drug licensed
for use during pregnancy.
Mechanism of action
These agents bind to bile acids in the gut, thus reducing their enterohepatic circulation and increasing bile acid excretion. This increases hepatocyte cholesterol requirements, which increases LDL receptor production,
thus reducing circulating LDL levels.
Under optimum conditions, LDL cholesterol can be reduced by 20–30%,
triglycerides rise by 10–17%, and HDL increases by 3–5%.
Side effects
These agents remain in the gut, so constipation, bloating, nausea, and
abdominal discomfort are not uncommon. Constipation, found in 35–40%
of those on these agents, can be helped with bulking laxatives. Less often a
bleeding tendency due to vitamin K malabsorption can be seen.
These agents can also exacerbate hypertriglyceridemia, but HDL cholesterol is often i slightly. To reduce the side effects, patients should start
with low doses and build up gradually over the next 3–4 weeks while
maintaining a good ﬂuid intake.
Interactions
These agents can reduce the absorption of warfarin, digoxin, B-blockers,
pravastatin, ﬂuvastatin, and hydrochlorothiazide. Many other agents such
as simvastatin have not been checked, so to avoid any potential interaction, advise patients to take all other drugs 1 hour before or 4 hours after
the resin.

Nicotinic acid
Indications
These include high LDL, VLDL, IDL, or triglycerides. Nicotinic acid is the
most effective medication for i HDL-cholesterol.
In practice, however, their use is limited by the side-effect proﬁle, especially ﬂushing. Niaspan®, a modiﬁed-release nicotinic acid product, is now
available and does seem to cause fewer unwanted side effects and should
be the ﬁrst choice.
Mechanism of action
Nicotinic acid works by inhibiting lipolysis in adipocytes, thus altering fatty
acid ﬂux and reducing VLDL synthesis and HDL clearance. VLDL levels
fall, as do those of triglycerides (by 20–50%) and LDL (by 5–25%), whereas
HDL levels rise (by 10–50%).

681

682

CHAPTER 116

Management of dyslipidemia

Side effects
Side effects are common, with 30% of patients being unable to tolerate
these agents. Vasodilatation giving cutaneous/facial ﬂushing occurs in most
patients but tends to improve after 2–3 weeks of therapy or if patients are
given prostaglandin inhibitors such as aspirin in combination with nicotinic
acid.
Patients should avoid taking it with hot drinks as these increase its
absorption and worsen the ﬂushing. Gastritis is also a common problem;
the more severe hepatitis occurs in only 3%.
Tachycardias, dry skin, and exacerbations of gout and precipitation of
acanthosis nigricans and retinal edema are also recognized side effects.
Nicotinic acid can adversely affect glucose control in diabetes mellitus.
Interactions
These agents potentiate the effects of antihypertensive therapies.

Omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor®, Lovaza®)
Indications
These include severe hypertriglyceridemia.
Mechanism of action
They inhibit the secretion of VLDL through i intracellular apo B-100
destruction. Normal patients see both a fall in VLDL and LDL, but LDL
may rise in the hypertriglyceridemic individual.
Side effects
As high doses are needed, this high-calorie load may increase obesity.
More commonly it gives nausea and belching. Omacor® produces fewer
unwanted effects and is less caloriﬁc, as it is used in a smaller dose.
Interactions
There are none that are signiﬁcant.

Cholesterol absorption blocker
Presently only one preparation, ezetimibe, is available, and is now the
second-line of treatment after a statin.
Indications
This agent is used for LDL cholesterol-lowering in patients who are intolerant of statins or in combination with a statin in those whose levels are
not adequately controlled with a statin alone.
It is also used in the very rare condition of sitosterolemia, where there
is an i absorption of plant sterols.
Mechanism of action
Dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption is selectively inhibited. Ezetimibe
(10 mg) monotherapy produces an 18% fall in LDL cholesterol, an increase
in HDL cholesterol of 1–3%, and triglycerides are not affected. In combination therapy with a statin, ezetimibe reduces levels by an additional 22% to
that obtained by statin alone.

DRUG THERAPY

Interactions
None are signiﬁcant.

Which drug to use when (for diet-resistant dyslipidemias)
Elevated LDL cholesterol only
First choice
• Statins
Second choice
• Cholesterol absorption blocker
Then:
• Bile acid sequestrants
• Nicotinic acid
• Fibrates
Combination therapy if the above fail to reduce LDL adequately includes:
• Statin + bile acid sequestrant (can give 50% fall in LDL + 10–15% rise
in HDL)
• Statin + cholesterol absorption blocker (can give an additional 22% fall
in LDL + 3% rise in HDL)
• Statin + nicotinic acid (can give 50% fall in LDL + 25–50% rise in HDL)
• Nicotinic acid + bile acid sequestrants (can give 35% fall in LDL +
25–50% rise in HDL)
• Statin + bile acid sequestrant + nicotinic acid (can give 66% fall in LDL
+ 25–50% rise in HDL)
Elevated triglycerides only
First choice
• Fibrates
Second choice
• Omega-3 fatty acids
Third choice
• Nicotinic acid
All three groups can occasionally be used together if one or two of the
above groups are insufﬁcient.
Mixed hyperlipidemia
First choice
• Fibrate
Second choice
• Fibrate + statin (but needs close monitoring)
• Fibrate + nicotinic acid
As with elevated LDL alone, combination therapy may sometimes be useful with emphasis on avoiding side effects and interactions as above.

683

684

CHAPTER 116

Management of dyslipidemia

Aims of treatment
In the United States the decision to treat lipids is based on an assessment
of any individual’s cardiovascular risk:
• For individuals with 0–1 risk factor, the LDL goal is <160 mg/dL.
• For individuals with multiple (2+) risk factors, LDL goal is <130 mg/dL.
For patients with CHD and CHD risk equivalents, the primary treatment
goal is as follows:
• LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dL with a therapeutic option for <70 mg/dL
• Although an optimal triglyceride value is <150 and an optimal HDL is
>40 (men), the primary goal of treatment is LDL lowering.
An alternative to the above is to begin assessment with the Framingham
risk scoring (10-year risk assessment) (see Tables 113.1, pp. 664–665 and
113.2, pp. 666–667) and use the associated goals listed in Table 116.3.

Pitfalls in laboratory
endocrinology

Introduction
The previous issue of this Handbook contained a chapter entitled “Normal
ranges” for endocrine-related laboratory tests. The purpose of this chapter is to explain why this compendium of data needs to be viewed with
a degree of caution and why you, as a clinical endocrinologist, should be
actively liaising with your laboratory service about the assays that they
provide, their reference ranges, and the performance of these assays.
Laboratory methods are complex and are affected by a number of
factors (Box 117.1) that can often only be considered and explored if
information is shared by frequent liaison between clinicians and laboratory
scientists. Uncritical use of numbers obtained from the literature may lead
to errors and bad management decisions.

Box 117.1 Factors to be considered for laboratory
investigations
Pre-analytical factors
• Sample timing
• Which tube?
• Sample transport factors
• Biological variation
• Which stimulation test?
Analytical factors
• Assay speciﬁcity
• Assay standardization
• Analytical performance
• Hook effects
• Antibody interference
• Particularly problematic assays
Post-analytical factors
• Reference ranges
• Units
• Interpretation

PRE-ANALYTICAL FACTORS

Pre-analytical factors
Half of all errors in the diagnostic process are due to pre-analytical factors
(Box 117.2), and 20% of errors are related to sample collection. Even in
hospitals where there is a heightened awareness of these problems, there
is a prevalence of 1% pre-analytical errors.
These effects can be of sufﬁcient magnitude to alter the analysis enough
to create situations for clinical errors. Most problems can be prevented by
clear instructions and documented policies for sampling.
Some issues are relatively straightforward, such as collecting the sample
into the correct blood tube and ensuring that samples are transported to
the laboratory fast enough at the correct temperature. A comprehensive
list can be found at http://www.specimencare.com/.
In order to be certain whether two or more samples taken from an
individual are different, it is important to consider the biological variation
that naturally occurs (see Box 117.3). A comprehensive list can be found
at http://www.westgard.com/intra-inter.htm.
In addition, the clearance t½ of each hormone should be considered:
endogenous hormones and tumor markers are like pharmaceuticals and
90% of the change occurs after 4.5x t½.

CHAPTER 117

Pitfalls in laboratory endocrinology

Many endocrine function tests require stimulation tests. What is the
evidence for the one you plan to use? How much difference exists for different stimulation tests? For examples of the effects of different stimulants
of GH see Rahim et al. (1996).1

Analytical factors
Most endocrine assays are immunoassays that rely on binding of a hormone or metabolite by a diagnostic antibody. The binding speciﬁcity will
depend on the care and attention with which the manufacturer has chosen
the reagents.
Typical interferences may be due to slightly different molecular forms
such as occurs with steroid or thyroid hormones. Peptide hormones are
more complex because so many differently glycosylated isoforms of those
peptides exist.
Standards for pituitary hormones are generally derived from puriﬁed
pituitary extracts that contain a mixture of peptides. This leads to different assays having quite marked biases between each other due to different
binding afﬁnities of the antibodies to the different isoforms. A similar situation exists with hCG, for which many multiple molecular forms co-exist.
Attempts to ﬁnd international consensus for standards that can be used
in diagnostic systems are being made, particularly for growth hormone and
glycated hemoglobin.
Analytical performance or assay reproducibility is important in determining the critical differences between patient samples. A signiﬁcant difference
between consecutive samples at 95% conﬁdence will require a difference of
1.96x the method standard deviation at the appropriate concentration.
The hook effect occurs when very high hormone concentrations ﬂood
the available antibody in vitro, leading to artifactually low results. It is less
common as assays have larger dynamic ranges, but new cases continue to
be reported, and there are published case reports for all hormones and
tumor markers.
Antibody interference is a widespread problem that affects approximately 1% of immunoassays. It is insidious and due to endogenous antibodies that interfere with hormone binding in vitro. Most importantly,
they cannot be detected by usual-quality control mechanisms. There are
a number of laboratory techniques that can be used to clarify whether
such interference is present, but it is inherent on the clinician to alert the
laboratory to a potential clinical mismatch.
Some assays can only be classiﬁed as problem assays. These include
thyroglobulin and low concentrations of estradiol (<300 pmol/L) and
testosterone (<5 nmol/L). The former is due to the high prevalence of
endogenous antithyroglobulin antibodies, which are particularly prevalent
in patients with thyroid disease. The latter are due to antibody speciﬁcity;
however, it is hoped that this will be resolved with the introduction of
mass spectrometry into routine clinical practice.

young adult males using a variety of provocative agents. Clin Endocrinol 45:557–562.

POST-ANALYTICAL FACTORS

Post-analytical factors
Interpretation of assay results is made in relation to reference ranges provided by the laboratory. These usually represent the 95th percentiles of
a population of healthy individuals. However, the deﬁnition of normality
is subjective, and reference ranges are affected by such factors as age,
gender, and, in some cases, ethnicity.
Moreover, for hormones, time of day, month, and season are important.
For some hormones, it is difﬁcult to obtain appropriate samples to construct ranges, such as in children, and in circumstances that make it difﬁcult
to obtain samples in health, e.g., following pharmacological stimulation or
samples of CSF.
If the central 95th percentile reference ranges are used, there is a 5%
chance that a result will be out of range due to chance. As the number of
tests taken are i, so will the risk of a chance abnormality. The increase will
be x% (where x = 1 – 0.95a, and a is the number of tests performed).
Literature from U.S. and European journals may use different units—beware! SI units use molar or mass (g) and volumes are reported in liters.
Most assays are standardized with international preparations. These are
usually the molecular forms that are most prevalent when basal samples
are taken. However, following stimulation, nonstandard molecules are
released into the circulation that have different clearance rates and different binding characteristics to the diagnostic antibodies in vitro.
This can lead to marked differences between methods. For example, following stimulation by ACTH, corticosteroid precursors are released that will
compete with cortisol for binding in the assay. Similarly, following stimulation
of GH release, different isoforms of GH are secreted and the most abundant
20 and 22kDa isoforms clear at different rates, leading to variations in recognition by the diagnostic antibodies at different times during the test.

Pitfalls in laboratory endocrinology

Box 117.4 Disastrous outcomes
Assay interference
A series of patients has been described in whom aggressive therapy for
choriocarcinoma was instituted for diagnoses based on assays affected
by in vitro artifacts.
Antibody speciﬁcity
A patient has been described who had prolactin measured by three
different assays, giving three different answers. The solution awaited a
clinical answer when the hyperprolactinemia resolved after the offending medication was stopped.
Interference by insulin autoantibodies
A patient has been described with recurrent hypoglycemia due to insulin
autoantibodies caused by myeloma. This patient demonstrated in vivo
interference by endogenous antibodies as well as in vitro interference.
Hook effect
A patient presents with a large pituitary tumor that appears nonfunctioning; prolactin is normal and the patient is treated surgically. The next
day, the blood sample is reassayed after dilution, and high prolactin is
uncovered when the antibody is no longer ﬂooded by excess prolactin.

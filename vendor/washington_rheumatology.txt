Chairman’s Note

is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual ®
I tSubspecialty
Consult Series: Rheumatology Subspecialty Consult. This pocketsize book continues to be a primary reference for medical students, interns,
residents, and other practitioners who need ready access to practical clinical
information to diagnose and treat patients with a wide variety of disorders. Medical
knowledge continues to increase at an astounding rate, which creates a challenge for
physicians to keep up with the biomedical discoveries, genetic and genomic
information, and novel therapeutics that can positively impact patient outcomes. The
Washington Manual Subspecialty Series addresses this challenge by concisely and
practically providing current scientific information for clinicians to aid them in the
diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, which include house officers, fellows, and
attendings at Washington University School of Medicine and Barnes-Jewish
Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education is unsurpassed, and their
efforts and skill in compiling this manual are evident in the quality of the final
product. In particular, I would like to acknowledge our editor, Dr. Leslie Kahl, and
the series editors, Drs. Tom De Fer and Katherine Henderson, who have worked
tirelessly to produce another outstanding edition of this manual. I would also like to
thank Dr. Melvin Blanchard, Chief of the Division of Medical Education in the
Department of Medicine at Washington University School of Medicine, for his
advice and guidance. I believe this Subspecialty Manual will meet its desired goal
of providing practical knowledge that can be directly applied at the bedside and in
outpatient settings to improve patient care.

Preface

have written this manual as a guide to inpatient and outpatient rheumatology
W econsultations.
The target audience includes medical students, residents, and
other medical professionals who care for patients with rheumatologic problems. In
addition, this manual could also serve as a pocket reference for medical
professionals specializing in rheumatology. It is not intended as a compendium of
rheumatology but, rather, focuses on how to approach rheumatologic problems. As
such, it provides guidance on how to perform the musculoskeletal examination and
arthrocentesis, what laboratory testing may prove useful, and which medications are
appropriate (including dosages and recommended monitoring), all framed within a
brief overview of the major rheumatologic diseases.
The editor would like to thank the contributing authors for their participation in
this project. A special thanks goes to Dr. Tom De Fer for his ongoing support and
oversight, and to the authors and editors of the first edition of the manual for leading
the way.

Approach to the Rheumatology Patient
Maria C. Gonzalez-Mayda and
Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Musculoskeletal conditions may be classified according to their symptom
presentation, that is, inflammatory versus noninflammatory and articular versus
nonarticular.

• A thorough history and physical examination is necessary in order to help
narrow your diagnosis.

• Use specific ancillary tests such as radiographs, labs, and arthrocentesis to
help confirm your initial diagnosis.

• Rheumatic diseases mainly involve the musculoskeletal system.
Inflammatory disorders are often accompanied by systemic features (fever
and weight loss) and other organ involvement (kidney, skin, lung, eye,
blood).
Since these diseases affect multiple organ systems, they are therefore
challenging to diagnose, complicated to treat, and often humbling to study.

• Musculoskeletal complaints account for a majority of outpatient visits in the
community.
Many are self-limited or localized problems that improve with symptomatic
treatment.
Other conditions (e.g., septic arthritis, crystal-induced arthritis, fractures)
require urgent diagnosis and treatment.

• Musculoskeletal problems may also be the initial presentation of diseases such
as cancer and endocrinopathies.

• Inpatient consultations usually involve patients with known diagnoses (a patient
with lupus admitted with a flare) or with multiple organ system involvement
and the suspicion of a systemic rheumatic disease (a patient with respiratory
and kidney failure with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA]).
18

Classification
The following is an approach to patients with musculoskeletal complaints and to
common inpatient consults. Regional problems (i.e., nonsystemic musculoskeletal
disorders) are discussed in Chapter 8, Regional Pain Syndromes.
Inflammatory versus Noninflammatory
The characteristics of inflammatory and noninflammatory disorders are presented in
Table 1-1.

• Inflammatory disorders
Characterized by systemic symptoms (fever, stiffness, weight loss, fatigue).
Signs of joint inflammation on physical examination (erythema, warmth,
swelling, pain).
TABLE 1-1 NONINFLAMMATORY VERSUS INFLAMMATORY
DISORDERS

Lab evidence of inflammation (elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
[ESR], elevated C-reactive protein [CRP], hypoalbuminemia, normochromic
normocytic anemia, thrombocytosis).
Joint stiffness is common after prolonged rest (morning stiffness) and
improves with activity.
Duration of >1 hour suggests an inflammatory condition.
Noninflammatory conditions may cause stiffness usually lasting <1 hour
19

and the joint symptoms increase with use and weight bearing.
These distinctions are useful but not absolute.
Inflammatory disorders may be immune-mediated (systemic lupus
erythematosus [SLE], rheumatoid arthritis [RA]), reactive (reactive arthritis
[ReA]), infectious (gonococcal [GC] arthritis), or crystal induced (gout,
pseudogout).

• Noninflammatory disorders
Characterized by absence of systemic symptoms, pain without erythema or
warmth, normal lab tests.
Osteoarthritis (OA), fibromyalgia, and traumatic conditions are common
noninflammatory disorders.
Articular versus Nonarticular

• Pain may originate from:
Articular structures (synovial membrane, cartilage, intra-articular
ligaments, capsule, or juxtaarticular bone surfaces).
Periarticular structures (bursae, tendons, muscle, bone, nerve, skin).
Nonarticular structures (i.e., cardiac pain referred to the shoulder).

• Articular disorders
Cause deep or diffuse pain that worsens with active and passive movement.
Physical examination may show deformity, warmth, swelling, effusion, or
crepitus.
Synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane that covers the joint) is
a boggy, tender swelling around the joint. The joint loses its sharp edges
on examination. Synovitis is easy to detect in finger and wrist joints.
Arthralgia refers to joint pain without abnormalities on joint examination.
Arthritis indicates the presence of abnormality in the joint (warmth,
swelling, erythema, tenderness).

• Nonarticular disorders
Usually have point tenderness and increased pain with active, but not
passive, movement.
Physical examination does not usually show joint deformity or swelling.

20

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The evaluation of musculoskeletal complaints should determine whether the
disorder is inflammatory or noninflammatory, whether the joints or the
periarticular structures are involved, and the number and pattern of joints
involved.

• Number and pattern of joints involved:
The number and pattern of joints involved are important in the diagnosis.
Acute monoarthritis suggests infection but gout and trauma are possible.
Asymmetric, oligoarticular (<5 joints) involvement, particularly of the
lower extremities, is typical of OA and ReA.
Symmetric, polyarticular (≥5 joints) involvement is typical of RA and SLE.
Involvement of the spine, sacroiliac (SI) joints, and sternoclavicular joints
is characteristic of ankylosing spondylitis (AS).
In the hands, distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints are involved in OA
(Heberden’s nodes) and in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) but are spared by RA.
Proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint involvement is seen in OA
(Bouchard’s nodes) and RA.
Metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints are involved in RA but not in OA.
Acute first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint arthritis is classic for gout
(podagra) but is also seen in OA and ReA.
Vasculitis and SLE may present with multiple organ system involvement,
often without major joint complaints.
Fibromyalgia presents with diffuse pain but without arthritis.
Myositis presents with muscle weakness and rashes and occasionally
peripheral arthritis.
History

• A comprehensive history and physical examination are often enough to make a
diagnosis.

• Ask about pain, swelling, weakness, tenderness, limitation of motion, stiffness,
as well as constitutional symptoms when presented with a musculoskeletal
21

complaint since these clues will help you narrow your diagnosis.
For example, joint pain that occurs at rest and which worsens with movement
suggests an inflammatory process versus pain elicited with activity and
relieved by rest usually indicates a mechanical disorder such as a
degenerative arthritis.

• Inquire about what medications they are taking since many have side effects
and patients on immunosuppressive drugs are predisposed to developing
infections.
Some medications may cause a lupus-like syndrome (e.g., hydralazine,
procainamide), myopathies (e.g., statins, colchicine, zidovudine), or
osteoporosis (e.g., corticosteroids, phenytoin).
Alcohol commonly precipitates gout and may rarely cause myopathies and
avascular necrosis (AVN).
Vasculitis, arthralgias, and rhabdomyolysis may also be seen with substance
abuse (e.g., cocaine, heroin).

• Certain areas of the United States and Europe have an increased incidence of
Lyme disease; therefore, it is important to inquire about recent trips to these
areas.

• A family history may be important in AS, gout, and OA.
• The review of systems may identify other organ involvement and support the
diagnosis.
The nervous system may be involved in SLE, vasculitis, and Lyme disease.
Eye involvement may be severe and occurs in Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), RA,
seronegative spondyloarthropathies, giant cell arthritis, Behçet’s disease,
and Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG).
Oral mucosal ulcers are common in SLE, enteropathic arthritis, and Behçet’s
disease.
Rashes are seen in SLE, vasculitis, PsA, dermatomyositis (DM), adult-onset
Still’s disease, and Lyme disease.
Raynaud’s phenomenon is a reversible, paroxysmal constriction of small
arteries that occurs most commonly in fingers and toes and is precipitated by
cold. The classic sequence is initial blanching followed by cyanosis and
finally erythema due to vasodilation and is accompanied by numbness or
tingling. It may be idiopathic or associated with scleroderma, SLE, RA, and
mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD).
22

Pleuritis and pericarditis may be seen in RA, SLE, MCTD, and adult-onset
Still’s disease.
Gastrointestinal (GI) involvement is seen in enteropathic arthritis;
polymyositis (PM), and scleroderma. The latter may be associated with
dysphagia.

• Certain diseases are more frequent in specific age groups and genders.
SLE, juvenile RA, and GC arthritis are more common in the young.
Gout, OA, and RA are more common in middle-aged persons.
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell arthritis occur in the elderly.
Gout and AS are more common in men; gout is rare in premenopausal
women.
SLE, RA, and OA are more common in women.
Physical Examination

• Tailor the physical examination based on the presenting complaint.
• If the main complaint is arthritis or arthralgia, look for signs of inflammation
such as swelling, warmth, erythema over the joint and surrounding structures,
tenderness, deformity, limitation of motion, instability of the joint, and crepitus.

• If the pain appears to be nonarticular in origin, examine the surrounding bursae,
tendons, ligaments and bones for tenderness and inflammation.

• If there is suspicion of systemic involvement, make sure to perform a thorough
examination from head to toe so as not to miss any important findings that could
help you determine the etiology of their symptoms.
Examine the hair for signs of alopecia and or rashes.
The skin for any type of discoloration, rash, ulceration, blistering as well as
the nails for pitting.
The nose and mouth for signs of ulceration.
The heart and lungs for signs of pericardial and or pleural rubs, and/or
decreased breath sounds from underlying pulmonary fibrosis.
The abdomen for signs of serositis, pain related to ischemic bowel, etc.
A thorough examination of all the joints to look for the signs mentioned
above.
Examine the back thoroughly at the spinous processes, paraspinal and
23

surrounding muscles. Do not forget to examine the SI joints as well.
If there is clinical suspicion for Behçet’s disease and/or inflammatory bowel
disease, a genital examination would be indicated since ulcerations can be
seen.
Differential Diagnosis
Approach to Monoarthritis

• Common causes of monoarthritis are infection, crystal-induced arthritis, and
trauma (Table 1-2).

• Acute pain or swelling of a single joint requires immediate evaluation for
septic arthritis that can rapidly destroy the joint if left untreated (Fig. 1-1).

• It is also important to distinguish pain arising from periarticular structures
(tendons, bursa), which usually requires only symptomatic treatment, and cases
of referred pain (shoulder pain due to peritonitis or heart disease).

• The history should exclude trauma and can provide clues such as:
History of tick bite (Lyme disease).
Sexual risk factors (GC arthritis).
Colitis, uveitis, and urethritis (ReA).

• Physical examination usually distinguishes between articular and nonarticular
disorders.

• Perform arthrocentesis in patients with acute monoarthritis (see Chapter 4,
Synovial Fluid Analysis). Send synovial fluid for:
Leukocyte count with differential (>2000/mm3 suggest an inflammatory
process).
Gram stain and culture.
Crystal analysis. A wet mount of the fluid examined under polarizing
microscopy may identify crystals, but the presence of crystals does not
exclude infection.

• Culture other potential sources of infection (throat, cervix, rectum, wounds,
blood).

• Synovial biopsy and arthroscopy are sometimes used to diagnose chronic
monoarthritis.

24

• Radiographs are useful in cases of trauma and may show OA or
chondrocalcinosis in calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease.

• A patient with synovial fluid that is highly inflammatory requires empiric
antibiotic therapy until the evaluation, including cultures, is completed.
TABLE 1-2 FEATURES AND CAUSES OF MONOARTHRITIS

Approach to Polyarthritis

• Polyarthritis is one of the most common problems in rheumatology (Fig. 1-2).
• The number and pattern of joint involvement suggest the diagnosis (Table 1-3).
• There are many nonarticular causes of generalized joint pain.
Disorders of periarticular structures (tendons, bursae) cause joint pain but
usually involve a single joint.
25

Myopathies occasionally cause widespread pain, but muscle weakness is the
primary symptom.
PMR causes shoulder and pelvic girdle pain with morning stiffness, but there
is usually no arthritis on examination; weakness is not a feature of this
disease.
Neuropathies, primary bone diseases (Paget’s disease), and fibromyalgia can
also cause widespread pain but are distinguished by history and physical
examination.

Rheum. 1996;39:1.)

27

• Rheumatoid arthritis is the prototypical polyarticular arthritis.
Given its frequency (1%), it is important to recognize and distinguish RA
from other types of arthritis.
RA usually begins with symmetric peripheral arthritis of multiple small
joints of hands, wrists, and feet which progresses over weeks to months.
Morning stiffness is prominent and usually lasts >1 hour. Other joints (knees,
ankles, shoulders, elbows) are sequentially involved. Involvement of the
cervical spine, temporomandibular joint, and sternoclavicular joint may also
be seen.
Lumbar spine and SI involvement is very rare.

• SLE may present with polyarthritis similar to RA that may be intermittent.
Fever, rashes, serositis, and other organ involvement may accompany arthritis
in SLE.

• Viral arthritis (due to parvovirus B19, hepatitis B, rubella, HIV) may have an
acute onset with fever and rashes and persist for months.

28

TABLE 1-3 CAUSES OF POLYARTHRITIS

• Palindromic rheumatism causes recurrent attacks of symmetric arthritis that
affect hands, wrists, and knees and are self-limited over several days.

• The seronegative spondyloarthropathies are characterized by spine and SI
joint involvement, enthesopathy (pain at sites of tendon insertion to bone) and
varying degrees of peripheral joint, eye, skin, and GI involvement.
Peripheral joint involvement is usually asymmetric, oligoarticular, and of
the lower extremities (knee, ankle).
Dactylitis, a diffuse swelling of a digit (“sausage digit”), may be seen in
fingers and toes and is characteristic of ReA and PsA.
29

A symmetric, polyarticular form of PsA exists that is similar to RA.

• Oligoarticular disease may also be seen with Behçet’s disease, sarcoidosis,
and relapsing polychondritis.

• Bacterial arthritis may be polyarticular in patients with preexisting joint
damage (RA).

• GC arthritis may be migratory and is accompanied by fever, pustular skin
lesions, and tenosynovitis.

• Fever and migratory arthralgias or mild arthritis may be seen in early Lyme
disease, and a persistent oligoarticular arthritis occurs months later.

• Bacterial endocarditis often presents with fever, low back pain, and
arthralgias and may have a positive RF.

• Gout is usually monoarticular, but polyarthritis is sometimes seen, particularly
later in disease.

• Pseudogout may present as “pseudo-RA” with bilateral hand and wrist
involvement.

• Rheumatic fever occurs after streptococcal infection and is characterized by
migratory arthritis of large joints, fever, and extra-articular involvement
(carditis, chorea, rash).

• OA is the most common form of noninflammatory polyarthritis.
DIP, PIP, first carpometacarpal (CMC), knees, hips, and first MTP joints
are typically involved.
Hemochromatosis predisposes to OA in unusual joints (second and third
MCP).
Approach to Patients with Positive Antinuclear Antibodies

• Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are autoantibodies that target nucleic acid and
nucleoprotein antigens, and are usually detected by indirect
immunofluorescence (see Chapter 5, Laboratory Evaluation of Rheumatic
Diseases) (Figure 1-3).

• ANAs are very sensitive (their absence by current assays practically rules out
SLE) but not too specific for SLE.

• ANAs are present in other rheumatic diseases (e.g., scleroderma, MCTD, PM,
SS), in drug-induced lupus (DIL), in some infectious diseases (e.g., HIV), and
30

in up to 5% of healthy individuals (in low titers).

• They are also present in many patients with chronic liver or lung disorders, and
in those with nonarticular autoimmune diseases such as thyroiditis.

• An ANA test should be ordered only when you suspect a patient has an
underlying autoimmune condition such as SLE.

• A positive ANA should be followed by a complete history and physical
examination to identify those conditions.
A history of hydralazine or procainamide use suggests DIL.
Myositis, skin changes, and Raynaud’s phenomenon suggest MCTD, myositis,
or scleroderma.
Sicca symptoms (dry eyes and dry mouth) suggest SS.

• SLE is a multisystem disease that is diagnosed clinically.
Criteria developed for the classification of lupus (see Chapter 12, Systemic
Lupus Erythematosus) can be used as a framework for assessing whether a
patient has SLE.
Certain other diseases (acute HIV infection, endocarditis, autoimmune
hepatitis) may fulfill criteria for SLE.
High-titer ANAs (>1:640) should be followed by assays for antibodies to
certain antigens (double-stranded DNA, SSA/Ro, SSB/La, ribonucleoprotein
[RNP], Smith [Sm]) that may be more specific for SLE and other rheumatic
diseases.
If no certain diagnosis is made, follow-up may be indicated.
Up to 40% of patients referred to a rheumatologist for evaluation of positive
ANAs who do not fulfill criteria on presentation do fulfill criteria for SLE
after months to years of follow-up.
Approach to Patients with Possible Systemic Vasculitis

• The vasculitides are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by
inflammation of blood vessels.

• Vasculitis is often suspected in patients with multiple organ involvement.
Vessels in the respiratory tract, kidneys, GI tract, peripheral nerves, and skin
may be involved in varying degrees depending on the category of vasculitis
and the size of the blood vessel involved.

• Perform a complete history and physical examination on these patients.
31

Patients with suspected vasculitis should be questioned about fever, rashes,
arthralgias or arthritis, abdominal pain, weight loss, and any underlying
rheumatic diseases (SLE, RA).
The physical examination should identify other organ system involvement
(purpura, peripheral neuropathy, joint abnormalities) that may not be obvious
on initial presentation

• ANCA should be ordered if suspecting some types of vasculitis.
ANCA is sensitive and specific for some vasculitides but may be seen in
infections (such as HIV).
Positive ANCA tends to require confirmation with more specific assays for
antibodies against myeloperoxidase (MPO) and proteinase-3 (PR3) (see
Chapter 5, Lab Evaluation of Rheumatic Diseases).

• Other lab tests (ANA, complement levels, hepatitis panels, cryoglobulins,
urinalysis) may be useful to establish etiology.

• Chest and sinus radiographs may reveal occult respiratory tract involvement.
• Diagnosis may require pathologic examination of skin, nerve, kidney, or lung
tissue.

• Infection should be ruled out before treatment with corticosteroids or
immunosuppressives is considered.

• Bacterial endocarditis, embolic disease and cocaine use may mimic vasculitis
and therefore should also be considered.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Perioperative Considerations

• There are special considerations for patients with rheumatic diseases who
undergo elective surgical procedures, related to joint deformities that limit
mobility, medications the patient is taking, and existing end-organ damage.

• Joint deformities in patients with RA, juvenile RA, and AS may include
limited jaw opening and cervical spine fusion or laxity, which can contribute
to difficult intubation.
Patients with RA should have preoperative cervical spine radiographs
(lateral in flexion and extension) to detect severe instability.
Fiberoptic or awake intubation may be needed.

of the antinuclear antibody test and test for specific autoantibodies to nuclear
antigens. Arch Pathol Lab Med. 2000;124:71–81.)

Patients with AS may also have limitations in thoracic expansion that may
33

complicate mechanical ventilation.

• Cystitis, skin infections, and possible sources of bacteremia such as caries
should be treated before joint replacement to prevent seeding of the prosthesis.

• Patients with SS are at risk for corneal abrasions in surgical settings and need
to receive ocular lubricants before and after surgery.
NPO orders may be made more tolerable with artificial saliva.
Particular care is needed with intubation given the usual poor state of
dentition in these patients.

• Many patients with rheumatologic diseases are on nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and/or biologic agents (see Chapter 9, Drugs
Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases). Below are recommendations
on when to hold specific medications perioperatively.
Aspirin and other NSAIDs affect platelet aggregation and should be
discontinued 5 to 7 days before surgery. Selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibitors do not affect platelet aggregation and may be used until the day
of surgery.
Patients who are on or have received corticosteroids in the previous year
may be at risk for adrenal insufficiency during the stress of surgery.
Hydrocortisone, 100 mg IV q8h, is the traditional “stress dose,” but lower
doses may be sufficient. Taper the corticosteroid dose to the daily dose (or
to zero in patients not previously on corticosteroids) within a few days if the
patient is stable.
Methotrexate should be withheld 48 hours before surgery and restarted within
1 to 2 weeks to prevent a flare of arthritis.
Nephrotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide should also be withheld
preoperatively.
Biological agents including etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, and anakinra
may be withheld for 1 week before and after surgery.

• Prophylaxis against deep vein thrombosis is mandatory in joint replacement
patients.

• Aggressive physical therapy is essential for rehabilitation.
• Acute crystalline arthritis is common in the postoperative period, and
management may be difficult in patients with renal dysfunction or who cannot
have oral intake. In these patients, narcotic analgesics or intra-articular
34

corticosteroids (after excluding infection) may be an option (see Chapter 13,
Gout).
FOLLOW-UP

• Many rheumatologic diseases have similar clinical pictures at onset but evolve
into distinct patterns over time and close follow-up is needed to make a
diagnosis.

• A patient with symmetric, peripheral polyarthritis may have a self-limited viral
arthritis, but persistence for >12 weeks suggests that RA will be the final
diagnosis.

• Urgent treatment is required in cases with active infection. Other patients may
be treated with NSAIDs and should be referred to a rheumatologist if disease
persists.

Rheumatologic Joint Examination
Michael L. Sams and Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• The full joint examination is often excluded from the general complete physical
examination because it is considered too time-consuming for minimal
diagnostic gain. The joints are usually addressed only if the patient has a
specific complaint.

• Musculoskeletal disorders, however, are common in patients who present to
physicians and are the most common reason for disability in the population.

• The joint examination, if done consistently, can be performed with increasing
efficiency and brevity.

• A brief screening examination is presented in Table 2-1.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• History should focus on the following points: The onset of the symptoms,
insidious versus abrupt, the length of time symptoms have been present, the
specific location of the symptoms within or around the joint, aggravating and
relieving factors, the presence of stiffness, and if stiffness is present how long
it takes for it to resolve with activity.

• It is also important to ascertain functional impairment, including how well the
patient can perform activities of daily living (e.g., dressing, grooming,
cooking) and how the musculoskeletal disorder interferes with occupation or
hobbies.
Physical Examination

• In general, the examination should begin with a visual inspection noting
36

asymmetry, alignment, swelling, deformities, and changes in color.

• The examination continues with palpation for warmth, tenderness, and crepitus.
Any specific structures of the joint that are tender should be noted, as patients
with rheumatologic disease can also have common musculoskeletal
complaints, such as meniscal tear.
Hard swelling around joints may be due to bony deformities, whereas tender,
“boggy” swelling may be due to synovial inflammation (synovitis).

• Simultaneously notice the bulk, tone, and strength of the associated muscle
groups.

• Assess active and passive ranges of motion, making note of any pattern of
joint involvement.
TABLE 2-1 BRIEF JOINT SCREENING EXAMINATION

• Finally, perform specific provocative tests for each joint to help identify a
source of pain. A good example is Phalen’s test for carpal tunnel syndrome.

• Note the patient’s gait as he or she walks into the room. Is the patient using any
adaptations to protect a particular joint? How does the patient sit in a chair? Is
37

the patient able to get up to the examination table unassisted? Note the use of
canes or other assistive devices. Look for uneven wear on shoes.

• Perform a general physical examination, paying close attention to the skin,
eyes, oropharynx, and nervous system.
Examining Individual Joints
Hands

• Begin with visual inspection by instructing the patient to stretch out all fingers
with the palms down. Then, palms up, have the patient make a fist and oppose
the thumb to the base of the fifth finger. Note any finger lag. Inspect for visible
swelling or erythema. Observe for deformity. For example, sublimations of the
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints with ulnar deviation of the digits are seen
with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Lastly, note any atrophy of the lumbrical or
thenar muscles, which can suggest nerve compression.

• Palpate each joint for tenderness. If there is finger lag with extension palpate
the flexor tendon for a snapping with extension or the presence of a nodule.
Either of these findings may suggest trigger finger.

• Also note grip strength and ability to fine pinch. Normal patients should be
able to make a completely closed fist.

• Heberden’s nodes: Hard, painless nodules on the dorsolateral aspects of the
distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints and are characteristic of osteoarthritis
(OA).

• Bouchard’s nodes: Similar to Heberden’s nodes, except found on the proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints (also characteristic of OA).

• “Swan neck” deformity: Hyperextension of the PIP joint with fixed flexion of
the DIP joint.

• “Boutonniere” deformity: Fixed flexion of the PIP joint with hyperextension
of the DIP joint.

• Other findings include tophi (hard or soft uric acid deposits seen in chronic
gout), fingernail and cuticle abnormalities (seen in psoriatic arthritis,
dermatomyositis) and sclerodactyly (thin, tapered fingers with tight overlying
skin and loss of soft tissue seen in scleroderma).
Wrists
38

• Passively flex, extend, and deviate the wrists medially (ulnarly) and laterally
(radially). Normal range of motion for flexion is 80 degrees and extension is
70 degrees.

• Note any swelling, warmth, or tenderness along the joint.
Elbows

• Passively flex, extend, pronate, and supinate the forearms. Normal range of
motion is extension to 0 degrees (hyperextension occurs with > minus 10
degrees extension) and flexion to 150 degrees (the thumb should be able to
touch the shoulder). With the elbow flexed at 90 degrees, the forearms should
supinate and pronate to 80 degrees.

• Palpate along the extensor surface of the ulna and over the olecranon bursa for
rheumatoid nodules. These fleshy nodules are usually firm, nontender, and
mobile with respect to the overlying skin. Gouty tophi, which often occur in the
same area, are usually more firm.

• Palpation of the elbow joint is easier posteriorly and laterally as less soft
tissue obscures the joint. Tenderness over the medial or lateral epicondyles
should be noted.

• Finally, observe the olecranon bursa for any swelling, warmth or erythema.
Shoulders

• The shoulder is a highly mobile joint with normal flexion and abduction of up
to 180 degrees.

• A brief screening test of shoulder range of motion is the Apley Scratch Test. It
includes the following maneuvers: To evaluate external rotation and abduction
ask the patient to touch the contralateral scapula by reaching behind the neck.
To evaluate internal rotation and adduction ask the patient to touch the
contralateral scapula by reaching behind the back.

• To evaluate the rotator cuff perform both impingement and drop arm tests.
The Neer impingement sign can be elicited by passive forward flexion of the
internally rotated arm while the examiner stabilizes the scapula. A positive test
produces pain with this maneuver. The drop arm test evaluates for a tear of the
rotator cuff. The test is performed by placing the patient’s shoulder in 90
degrees abduction. Have the patient slowly lower the arm to the side. The test
39

is considered positive if the arm cannot be smoothly lowered to the side.
Neck

• Ask the patient to flex and extend the neck. Normal range of motion permits the
chin to touch the chest. Ask the patient to turn his or her neck to the right then
the left. Normal rotation is about 60 degrees. To evaluate lateral flexion, ask
the patient to bring his or her ear toward each shoulder.

• Palpation of the spinous processes should be performed on the basis of the
clinical history to assess for tenderness that can suggest infection, fracture or
joint involvement. Examine for tender points in the paraspinal musculature.

• Spurling’s test may be performed to help assess if radicular pain from the neck
is present. The patient’s neck is extended and rotated to the side of the pain and
then firm pressure is applied to the top of the head pushing downwards. If
radicular symptoms are present it suggests foraminal stenosis as the cause.

• Finally, RA can lead to atlantoaxial subluxation. Caution should be taken with
passive range of motion testing in these patients.
Back

• Assess the curvature of the spine. The normal spine has three curves: Lumbar
lordosis, thoracic spine kyphosis, and cervical lordosis. Identify the presence
of abnormal lordosis, kyphosis, scoliosis, or list (lateral tilt of the spine).

• Palpate for any tenderness along the spine and paraspinal muscles. While the
patient is standing, instruct him or her to bend forward, backward, right, and
left.

• If spondyloarthropathy (see Chapter 15, Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis) is
suspected, perform the modified Schober test. With the patient standing, mark
two midline points, one 10 cm above the lumbosacral junction (midline
between the posterior iliac spines) and one 5 cm below the junction. The
points will be 15 cm apart. Ask the patient to flex forward and measure the
distance between the two points. In a normal individual, the span will increase
by ≥4 cm.
Hips

40

• While the patient is lying supine on the examination table, passively flex one
hip and knee while the other leg is held straight. Normal flexion is 120 degrees
(the patient should be able to touch the heel to the buttock). While the hip and
knee are flexed at a 90-degree angle, rotate the hip to measure hip external and
internal rotation. Normal values are 45 degrees for each. Internal rotation is
often limited with arthritis of the hip. Note any limitation, crepitus, or pain.

• A quick screening maneuver to assess the hip joint is the FABER test: Flexion,
abduction, and external rotation of the hip are tested by exerting light
downward pressure on the knee while the hip is flexed with the heel touching
the opposite knee. Pain suggests hip or sacroiliac joint pathology.
Knees

• Note the alignment of the knees in standing including valgus or varus
deformities.

• Palpate along the joint margins for tenderness and bony ridges (seen with OA).
Palpate surrounding tendons and bursa.

• Passively flex and extend the knee while feeling for crepitus. The knee
normally extends to 10 degrees of hyperextension and flexes to 135 degrees.

• Effusions are relatively easy to detect in the knee. Feel for joint effusion by
palpating the medial and lateral aspects of the patella while using the other
hand (placed proximal to the patella) to gently “milk” fluid toward the patella.
One can also assess for fluid with the “bulge” sign: Observe for a “bulge”
medial or lateral to the patella as pressure is applied from the opposite side.
Ankles

• Passively flex and extend the ankle (tibiotalar joint) to assess range of motion.
Normal dorsiflexion (from the ankle at a 90-degree angle to the leg) is 20
degrees, and normal plantar flexion is 50 degrees.

• Then medially (varus) and laterally (valgus) deviate the calcaneus to elicit
abnormalities of the subtalar joint motion. To test the midtarsal joint, stabilize
the heel with one hand, then use the other hand to invert and evert the forefoot.

• In order to palpate the tibiotalar joint (ankle joint) the best approach is
anteriorly with the foot in plantar flexion, as the dome of the talus nestled
between the distal tibia and fibula becomes more exposed.
41

• Other common sources of pain in the ankle should be palpated and include the
anterior talofibular ligament and the posterior tibialis/peroneal tendons.
Metatarsophalangeal Joints

• Ask the patient to plantar flex and dorsiflex the toes.
• Palpate each joint for tenderness, warmth and effusion.
• Observe for hallux valgus, lateral deviation of the great toe with respect to the
first metatarsal. With hallux valgus, the head of the first metatarsal is more
prominent and may enlarge on the medial side. Observe for tophi at the first
metatarsophalangeal joint.

42

3
Arthrocentesis: Aspirating and Injecting Joints and
Bursa
Rebecca Brinker and Leslie E. Kahl
INTRODUCTION

• Arthrocentesis is an essential tool for evaluating and treating articular disease.
• Acute monoarthritis necessitates immediate aspiration to rule out a septic joint.
• Do not inject steroids if there is still suspicion of a septic joint. Rule out
septic arthritis first.

• Procedures on artificial joint replacements should ideally be done by the
treating surgeon.

• Do not forget to check labs and to ask the patient about anticoagulants or
antiplatelet therapy.
Indications

• Suspected crystalline disease.
• Suspected infection.
• Posttraumatic effusion (to rule out hemarthrosis).
• Undiagnosed acute monoarthritis.
• Monoarticular joint effusion in a patient with polyarticular inflammatory
arthritis.

• Intra-articular injections (with steroids, anesthetic, contrast for arthrography or
hyaluronidate derivatives).
Contraindications

• Overlying cellulitis.
43

• Patients predisposed to bleeding have a relative contraindication to
arthrocentesis, that is, platelets <50,000, coagulopathy, or anticoagulant
therapy.

• Contraindications to intra-articular injection with steroids include septic
arthritis/bursitis, bacteremia, unstable joints, fractures, Charcot joint, prior
failure to respond to injection, joint prosthesis, and tumor.
Possible Complications

• Bleeding (local hematoma or hemarthrosis).
• Iatrogenic infection (rare and is estimated to occur only in 1:50,000
procedures).

• Rupture of tendon or damage to periarticular structure.
• Nerve damage (e.g., median nerve atrophy following a steroid injection).
• Allergic reaction to the equipment or injected medications.
• Postinjection flare.
• Subcutaneous fat atrophy with steroid injections (more common with
fluorinated steroids: Dexamethasone, betamethasone, and triamcinolone).
Table 3-1 lists various steroids for intra-articular injection.
TABLE 3-1 STEROID PREPARATIONS FOR JOINT INJECTIONS

• Skin discoloration at injection site (more common with fluorinated steroids).
44

• Hyperglycemia if systemic absorption of steroids is significant.
• Osteoporosis, avascular necrosis, and tissue fragility with chronic and frequent
injections.
Equipment

• Iodine or chlorhexidine
• 3-, 5-, 10-, 30-, or 60-cc syringes
• 18-, 20-, 25-gauge needles
• 1% lidocaine
• Hemostat/Kelly clamp
• Gloves
• Gauze, bandages
• Alcohol pads
• Glass slides with coverslips
• Test tubes (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] and heparinized)
• Blood culture bottles, culture swab
• Ballpoint pen
GENERAL APPROACH

• To access the joint space, palpate and define the anatomy of the joint. Mark the
desired location of entry by applying pressure to the patient’s skin with a
retracted ballpoint pen. This will leave a circular impression on the skin.

• Put on your gloves (they do not have to be sterile).
• Clean the skin thoroughly and perform the procedure with aseptic technique.
• Using a 25-guage infiltrate 1% lidocaine into the skin and subcutaneous tissues
for local anesthesia.

• Attach the appropriate gauge needle to the desired size syringe for joint
aspiration.

• Using your previous skin mark and anatomic landmarks, carefully introduce the
45

needle into the desired joint space. During needle advancement into the joint,
slightly pull back on the plunger of the syringe to create suction. Aspiration of
synovial fluid should result.
TABLE 3-2 RECOMMENDED COMPOSITION OF INJECTATE BY JOINT
SIZE

• If injecting a steroid preparation after joint aspiration (Table 3-1 and Table 32), or if you require more than one syringe for removal of all the joint fluid,
you may change the syringe while leaving the needle in the joint. A Kelly
clamp/hemostat may be used to grasp and provide stability to the hub of the
needle while unscrewing the syringe. Take great care not to withdraw or
advance the remaining needle during the syringe exchange.

• If joint aspiration is unsuccessful or assistance is needed for anatomically
complex joints, ultrasound guidance may be useful.

• If injecting superficial bursa, it is wise to enter the skin and bursa in a “Z” line
to avoid establishing a drainage track.

• It is recommended to limit steroid injections to—three to four injections
per site per year.

• After any arthrocentesis, record the amount of synovial fluid removed and
grossly examine the fluid for viscosity, clarity, and color.

46

• If you desire to perform microscopic analysis, place a small drop of fluid onto
a slide and apply a coverslip.

• Send the synovial fluid to the lab for cell count (in an EDTA lavender-top
tube), routine Gram stain and culture, and crystal analysis. Glucose, protein,
autoantibodies, pH, and complement levels from the fluid are rarely helpful
and should not be ordered. Acid-fast bacilli, fungal cultures (in a culture
bottle/swab), and cytology can be ordered if clinically indicated.
FIGURE 3-1. Anterior view of the hip for trochanteric bursitis.

HIP

• Aspiration and injection of the femoral acetabular joint is only done under
ultrasound or radiographic guidance and therefore is not described in this
chapter.

• The trochanteric bursa is a lubricating sac located between the femoral
trochanteric process and the gluteus medius tendon on the lateral aspect of the
hip. Point tenderness is often identified by the patient on top of the femoral
trochanter. The bursa may be injected with the patient lying in the lateral
decubitus position on the unaffected side. Insert the needle perpendicular to the
skin into the site of maximal tenderness. You may feel resistance as you pass
through the gluteus medius tendon as the needle advances to the underlying
bursa and femoral trochanter (Fig. 3-1).
KNEE

47

• The knee joint is formed by the articulation of the femur, the tibia, and the
patella (which lies in the femoral intercondylar groove). The joint space of the
knee extends from the proximal tibia to the suprapatellar region below the
quadriceps muscle. Therefore, the knee joint may be entered through the medial
or lateral approach. Both are discussed here.

• There should never be any resistance to knee injections. If resistance is
encountered you may be attempting the injection into a tendon or bone.
Lateral Suprapatellar Approach

• Position the patient supine on the table with the knee extended (some physicians
prefer up to 90 degrees of flexion) and with the quadriceps tendon relaxed.

• Palpate the superior lateral aspect of the patella (approximately 2 o’clock on
the left, and 10 o’clock on the right) and mark the skin one finger space
superior and lateral to this location.

• Advance the needle into the joint space at approximately a 45-degree angle
from the skin toward the underside of the superior lateral aspect of the patella
(Fig. 3-2).
FIGURE 3-2. Medial view of the knee joint.

Medial Approach

• Position the patient supine on the table with the knee extended or flexed at up to
90 degrees and the quadriceps tendon relaxed.
48

• Palpate the medial patella and mark the skin medially at the base of the patella
(9 o’clock on the left and 3 o’clock on the right).

• Advance the needle perpendicular to the skin. You may need to adjust
inferiorly slightly depending on specific patient anatomy or presence of severe
osteoarthritis (Fig. 3-2).
Prepatellar Bursa

• This bursa is located directly over the patella. Cystic swelling at this location
represents bursitis.

• Position the patient in the supine position with the leg extended.
• Enter the bursa on the medial or lateral aspect of the bursa with the needle
parallel to the bed.
Anserine Bursa

• This superficial bursa is located at the medial tibial plateau, about 3 cm below
the medial joint line. Inflammation often results from abnormal gait.

• Position the patient supine on the table. Identify the anserine bursa and its point
of maximal tenderness.

• While staying relatively superficial, enter the bursa perpendicular to the skin.
ANKLE

• The leg should be rested with the foot at a 90-degree angle. The tibialis
anterior tendon and the medial malleolus should be identified.

• The needle should enter the skin medial to the tendon and lateral to the midsuperior portion of the malleolus. Direct the needle posteriorly to enter the
joint space (Fig. 3-3).
FIGURE 3-3. Medial view of the ankle joint.

49

SHOULDER
Posterior Approach

• With the patient sitting, palpate the posterior margin of the acromion.
• The needle is inserted and directed anteriorly 1 cm below and 1 cm medial to
the posterior corner of the acromion. Direct the needle toward the coracoid
process until bone is touched at the articular surface (Fig. 3-4).
FIGURE 3-4. Posterior view of the shoulder.

FIGURE 3-5. Anterior view of the shoulder.
50

Anterior Approach

• The patient should be sitting or supine with the affected shoulder internally
rotated.

• The point medial to the head of the humerus and slightly inferior and lateral to
the coracoid process should be located and marked. Introduce and direct the
needle posteriorly. Redirect superiorly and laterally if bone is hit (Fig. 3-5).
Acromioclavicular Joint

• With the patient in the supine or seated position, palpate the clavicle and
follow it distally to its lateral termination. This slight depression is the
articulation of the acromioclavicular joint.

• Insert the needle into the joint at the superior or anterior aspect of the joint.
This space is small and you may only be able to insert the tip of the needle into
the space (Fig. 3-5).
Subacromial Bursa

• The posterolateral approach is generally easier and safer. Identify the posterior
51

corner of the acromion. The entry point is 1 cm inferior and medial to this
landmark.

• Enter the subacromial bursa with the needle directed anteromedially under the
acromion (Fig. 3-5).
Biceps Tendon Sheath

• Bicipital tendonitis results from inflammation of the head of the biceps tendon
as it passes through the bicipital groove in the humerus.

• With the patient sitting, externally rotate their relaxed arm. Palpate the biceps
tendon in the bicipital groove. To confirm anatomy, flex and extend the
patient’s externally rotated arm to feel the tendon slide in the groove.

• When injecting, aim the needle superiorly to the tendon at a tangential angle.
Take care to only inject around the tendon as injection into the tendon itself
may result in tendon rupture. There should be no resistance to injection when
done appropriately (Fig. 3-5).
ELBOW

• The elbow should be flexed at 90 degrees and the joint should be entered in the
center of the triangle formed by the lateral epicondyle, radial head, and
olecranon process.

• Insert the needle perpendicular to the skin at the joint.
Common Extensor Tendon

• Lateral epicondylitis (“tennis elbow”) is caused by injury of the common
extensor tendon at its insertion of the lateral epicondyle of the humerus.

• When injecting around this tendon, enter the skin directly over the prominence
of the lateral epicondyle and perpendicular to the skin. Take care not to inject
directly into the tendon (Fig. 3-6).
Common Flexor Tendon

• Medial epicondylitis (golfer’s elbow) is caused by injury to the common flexor
tendon at the medial epicondyle of the humerus.
52

• When injecting around this tendon enter half inch distal to the medial
epicondyle. Take care not to inject directly into the tendon.
FIGURE 3-6. Lateral view of the elbow.

FIGURE 3-7. Dorsal view of the right wrist.

Olecranon Bursa
53

• This superficial bursa is located at the extensor surface of the ulna distal to the
olecranon process. Position the patient with their arm comfortably flexed or
extended and supported.

• Enter the superficial bursa perpendicular to the skin in a “Z” line to avoid
establishing a drainage track.

• Try to avoid areas of the elbow with callus as these areas harbor more
bacteria.
WRIST

• Entry into the radiocarpal joint may be performed easily.
• Palpate the joint between the distal radius and the navicular bone. This is on
the radial side of the second digit extensor tendon. Mark this joint accurately
so as not to injure the extensor tendons of the first or second digits.

• Enter into the joint perpendicular to the wrist (Fig. 3-7).
HAND

• Use the smallest needle available for injections of the hand.
• To inject the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP)
joints, flex the fingers slightly and inject the desired joint on the medial or
lateral side of the joint on the dorsal half of the joint.

• The needle should enter perpendicular to the skin on either side of the finger.
• Take care not to injure the extensor tendon on the dorsal side of the finger.
• Trigger finger results from inflammation of the flexor tendon of the finger
preventing it from passing easily through the tendon sheath. Place the patient’s
hand in the supine position. Inject the flexor tendon sheath at the base of the
finger just distal to the metacarpal head. Take care not to inject directly into the
tendon.

54

Synovial Fluid Analysis
Jeffrey Sparks and Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Synovial fluid analysis is useful in distinguishing between inflammatory, septic,
noninflammatory, or hemorrhagic conditions.

• New effusions, suspected septic arthritis, and acutely tender, erythematous, and
swollen single joints generally require arthrocentesis and synovial fluid
analysis.

• Synovial fluid analysis includes: Gross inspection, microscopic inspection for
crystals and birefringence, cell count and differential, Gram stain, and
microbiologic cultures.

• Repeated unsuccessful arthrocenteses may require injection of a small amount
of saline to analyze a diluted sample of synovial fluid, or aspiration with
ultrasound or radiographic guidance.
Definitions

• Normal synovial fluid is an ultrafiltrate of plasma that contains small amounts
of high molecular weight proteins (fibrinogen, complement, globulin)
complexed with hyaluronan.

• Synovial fluid has viscoelastic properties, normally acting as a lubricant and
shock absorber for the joint.

• Birefringence of synovial fluid crystals is evaluated by orientating the polarizer
parallel to the long axis of the crystal. Positive birefringence is blue while
negative birefringence is yellow. For example, monosodium urate crystals are
needle shaped and have strongly negative birefringence, while calcium
pyrophosphate dihydrate crystals are rhomboid shaped and have weakly
positive birefringence.
Classification
55

• Many rheumatologic and nonrheumatologic conditions may disrupt the normal
composition of synovial fluid.

• Other causes of effusions and synovial fluid abnormalities include: Trauma,
hemarthrosis, recent arthroplasty, and prosthetic orthopedic devices.

• See Table 4-1 for general analysis of synovial fluid.
• See Table 4-2 for crystal analysis of synovial fluid.

Laboratory Evaluation of Rheumatic Diseases
Kristine A. Kuhn and Leslie E. Kahl
ERYTHROCYTE SEDIMENTATION RATE
General Principles

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate of erythrocytes settling in
anticoagulated blood; it is a nonspecific marker of tissue inflammation. The
presence of asymmetric macromolecules produced by the liver during
inflammation promotes erythrocyte aggregation and increases the ESR.

• The ESR is affected by many conditions, some of which may be present in
patients with rheumatologic diseases.
Noninflammatory conditions that tend to raise the ESR include anemia
(except sickle cell anemia), renal disease (including nephrotic syndrome and
glomerulonephritis), hypercholesterolemia, female sex, pregnancy, oral
contraceptives, malignancy, thyroid disease, and increasing age.
Conditions that can lower the ESR include high-dose steroid use, sickle cell
anemia, polycythemia, anisocytosis, spherocytosis, microcytosis, hepatic
failure, and cachexia.

• The ESR is sometimes used to monitor the activity of inflammatory conditions
such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
although other markers of disease activity such as clinical signs and symptoms
and lab indicators of organ function are more useful.
Laboratory Assessment

• Anticoagulated whole blood is allowed to stand for one hour. The distance
between the erythrocyte sediment and top of the tube in millimeters is the ESR.

• The presence of acute phase reactants makes the cells fall faster and raises that
distance.
C-REACTIVE PROTEIN
58

General Principles

• C-reactive protein (CRP) is a beta globulin normally present in the serum in
trace amounts. Serum concentrations rapidly increase during inflammation
within 4 to 6 hours and normalize over a week.

• CRP is a component of the innate immune response whose major function is to
recognize foreign pathogens and damaged cells by binding to phosphocholine
surfaces. Activation of complement proteins or phagocytic cells follows.

• Similar to ESR, CRP levels are elevated in acute or chronic inflammatory
states. Obesity, smoking, coronary artery disease, malignancy, and diabetes
mellitus may also elevate CRP levels.

• The use of CRP levels in addition to the ESR in the rheumatic diseases is
limited.
In patients with RA, a persistently elevated CRP level may be associated
with radiographic progression of joint disease and with long-term disability.
CRP levels may also be useful in patients with SLE. In contrast to ESR, CRP
levels are usually normal in active SLE except in chronic synovitis or acute
serositis. In SLE patients with fever in whom synovitis or serositis can be
excluded, elevated CRP levels suggest a bacterial source of inflammation
and fever.
Laboratory Assessment

• Nephelometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are used to
measure CRP.

• Levels <0.2 mg/dL are normal and >1 mg/dL are consistent with active
inflammation.
ANTINUCLEAR ANTIBODIES
General Principles

• Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) are directed against nuclear antigens. The ANA
pattern reflects different nuclear antigens targeted. Antibodies against specific
nuclear antigens can be detected (see later) and have improved specificity for
certain diseases.1

• ANAs can be useful in the diagnosis of many autoimmune diseases including
59

SLE and other connective tissue diseases (CTDs).
The specificities and sensitivities of ANA titers vary for each disease and
vary on the basis of the type of lab assay used. Therefore, one must be
cautious in interpretation of ANA results.
Titers do not correlate with disease activity and remain fairly stable
throughout the disease course. There is no need to repeat the ANA once
the diagnosis is clearly established.
Testing should only be performed to support a suspected, specific clinical
diagnosis.
While the absence of an ANA virtually excludes a diagnosis of SLE, the
presence of ANAs does not establish the diagnosis.

• Some ANAs such as anti–double-stranded DNA (anti–dsDNA) antibodies are
thought to contribute to disease pathogenesis by cross-reacting with selfantigens or forming immune complexes, while most ANAs are not considered
pathogenic.
Laboratory Assessment

• ANAs are detected by indirect immunofluorescence or ELISA. Due to minor
variations in assay protocols, the sensitivity and specificity varies on the basis
of the assay used and the titer cut-off for a positive result.
Higher titers convey increased clinical significance but do not correlate with
disease activity.
ANAs in healthy individuals tend to be of low titers.

• When indirect immunofluorescence is performed, most laboratories use the
human epithelial HEp-2 cell line as the substrate.

• Several staining patterns have been described. With the exception of the
centromere pattern, which is specific for limited systemic sclerosis (LSSc or
calcinosis, Raynaud’s, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and
telangiectasias [CREST]), the ANA staining pattern is generally unhelpful
because it is subject to observer interpretation.

• Specific ANAs are tested by ELISA.
Extractable Nuclear Antigens
60

• Extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs) are specific antigenic targets for ANAs
that can be extracted from the nucleus.

• These include anti-Smith (anti-Sm), which is included in the American
College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the diagnosis of SLE, and antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP), which is specific for mixed connective tissue
disease (MCTD). Anti-Ro (anti-SSA) and anti-La (anti-SSB), associated
with Sjögren’s syndrome, subacute cutaneous lupus, and neonatal lupus, are
also included in the ENA test battery.

• Patients with negative ANA titers will also have negative ENAs, although
positive ANAs do not necessarily result in detectable antibodies to ENAs. A
positive ANA in a patient with clinically suspected CTD should prompt one to
test more specific ENAs.

• See Table 5-1 for a summary of specific ENAs and disease associations.
Other Antinuclear Antibodies

• Anti-dsDNA, anti–Scl-70, and anti-histone are other ANAs that can be
associated with particular CTDs and carry prognostic information. These are
also summarized in Table 5-1.
RHEUMATOID FACTOR
General Principles

• Rheumatoid factor (RF) is a polyclonal antibody directed against the Fc
portion of immunoglobulin (Ig), most commonly IgM directed against IgG,
although IgG and IgA isotypes of RF are also detected in sera.

• RF is associated with chronic inflammatory diseases including RA (see
Table 5-1).
RF has a sensitivity of 60% to 80% for RA and a specificity of about 70%.
RF is also found elevated in Sjögren’s syndrome, hepatitis C infection,
multiple myeloma, interstitial lung disease, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis, and
sarcoidosis, among other chronic inflammatory and infectious disorders. A
small percentage of healthy individuals will have a positive RF.

• The role of RF in the pathogenesis of disease is unclear, although one
hypothesis suggests that RF initiates immune complexes in the synovium, which
61

activate, complement and release chemoattractants that recruit immune cells.
Laboratory Assessment

• RF is classically detected using a latex immunofixation test and reported as a
titer.

• Newer methods, including nephelometry and ELISAs, report results in
international units.

• The inverse ratio of the nephelometric result correlates roughly with the titer
result; for example, 120 IU correlates roughly with a titer of 1:120.

ANTI-CITRULLINATED PROTEIN ANTIBODIES
General Principles

• Anti-citrullinated protein antibodies (ACPAs) include antibodies directed
against cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), filaggrin, vimentin, and fibrinogen,
among others yet unidentified. CCP is a synthetic peptide derived from
filaggrin that confers high sensitivity and specificity when testing for
antibodies in individuals with RA.

• These peptides/proteins are unique in that they contain citrulline, an amino acid
formed by post-translational deimination of arginine.

• ACPAs are sensitive (70%) and highly specific (95%) for RA.2
65

• Anti-CCP antibodies have been detected in sera of patients with RA up to 10
years prior to the onset of disease. About one-third of patients with RA will be
positive for these antibodies, but RF negative, on presentation.

• There is evidence that these antibodies contribute to disease pathogenesis as
higher titers correlate with more erosive disease.3 The stimuli for the induction
of these antibodies and the mechanism by which they contribute to disease
activity are under investigation.
Laboratory Assessment

• The only ACPA that is currently available for clinical testing is anti-CCP
antibody.

• Newer generations of an ELISA with CCP have increased the specificity for
RA.
ANTINEUTROPHIL CYTOPLASMIC ANTIBODIES
General Principles

• Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) are directed against
cytoplasmic antigens in human neutrophils.

• ANCAs are not ANAs, although proximity of perinuclear-ANCA (p-ANCA)
staining to the nucleus may be mistaken for an ANA. Hence, a positive ANA or
p-ANCA may result in false-positive results for p-ANCA or ANA,
respectively.

• Two distinct staining patterns have been described: Cytoplasmic-ANCA (cANCA) and p-ANCA.
c-ANCA is associated with Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) and p-ANCA is
associated with Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), microscopic polyangiitis
(MPA), and polyarteritis nodosa (PAN).
The specific antigen for most c-ANCA is proteinase 3 (PR3) and for most pANCA is myeloperoxidase (MPO).
PR3 is a protein present in azurophil granules in neutrophils and is involved
in the function and activation of neutrophils. Antibodies to PR3 have high
sensitivities and specificities for active, fulminant WG. It is believed that
neutrophil modification by anti-PR3 antibodies in WG may account for some
of the disease manifestations.
66

MPO is a protein involved in the generation of reactive oxygen species and in
the modulation of macrophage function. Since p-ANCA and anti-MPO
antibodies are present in a large number of diseases, their roles in
pathogenesis are poorly understood.

• ANCAs are present in other inflammatory conditions, including autoimmune
hepatitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and ulcerative colitis. Further, they may be
induced by certain infections such as Staphylococcus aureus and mycobacteria,
and by drugs such as propylthiouracil and hydralazine.
Laboratory Assessment

• ANCAs are identified with indirect immunofluorescent staining assays using
ethanol-fixed neutrophils.

• Testing for anti-PR3 and anti-MPO antibodies is performed by ELISAs at a
reference lab.
MYOSITIS-SPECIFIC ANTIBODIES

• The three best-described myositis-specific antibodies (MSAs) are anti–Jo-1
(directed to t-RNA histidyl synthetase), anti–signal recognition protein (antiSRP), and anti–Mi-2. Their sensitivities for inflammatory myopathies are low,
ranging 25% to 30%.

• Specific MSA may be associated with certain clinical features and prognosis
(see Table 5-1).4

• These antibodies are detected by ELISA.
ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES
General Principles

• Antiphospholipid antibodies (APAs) are directed against phospholipids and
are associated with hypercoagulable and thrombotic states.

• APA is detected by assays for the lupus anticoagulant (LAC), anticardiolipin
antibodies (aCL), and false-positive serologies for syphilis.

•

Of the three APAs, LAC has the strongest association with
hypercoagulation. The name LAC is derived from the fact that the antibody
67

was first described in patients with SLE, and from its tendency to cause
prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) that did not correct
with the addition of normal plasma. We now know that LAC can be found in
other CTDs or in isolation.5

• The association between aCL and hypercoagulable states is related to antibody
titers and Ig isotype. As a general rule, increasing titers of aCL are associated
with increasing risk of hypercoagulation and thrombosis. IgG aCL carry more
risk than IgM aCL, and the risk with IgA aCL is questionable.

• Some aCL bind to complexes composed of phospholipids and beta-2glycoprotein I (beta-2-GPI), a natural serum anticoagulant. Beta-2-GPI–
dependent aCL are associated with increased risk of hypercoagulable states.
Laboratory Assessment

• LAC is identified in a stepwise manner using functional phospholipiddependent clotting assays that reveal a coagulation inhibitor that is neutralized
by phospholipids.5
First, phospholipid-dependent clotting assays such as a dilute prothrombin
time, aPTT, kaolin clotting time, or a dilute Russell viper venom time
(dRVVT) are drawn; prolonged times are considered positive results. Each
test has different sensitivities in detecting LAC, and the use of more than
one test is recommended.
The preferred screening test is an aPTT-based test using silica as an
activator in the presence of low levels of phospholipids. A prolonged time
suggests the presence of LAC. Positive tests should then be confirmed with a
dRVVT. In this assay, Russell viper venom activates factor X, which leads
to the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, dependent upon the presence
of phospholipids. If a LAC is present, the phospholipids are unavailable and
the dRVVT is prolonged.
Mixing studies are then performed on samples with prolonged times to
exclude factor deficiencies. If a prolonged time corrects in mixing studies,
the sample is further incubated in different temperatures to exclude a
temperature-sensitive inhibitor of coagulation. A sample that does not
correct with mixing studies or with variable-temperature incubation is
identified as having an inhibitor of coagulation. This sample is then
incubated with excessive phospholipids to characterize the inhibitor as either
a phospholipid-dependent or a phospholipid-independent inhibitor.
68

Excessive phospholipids neutralize the LAC and the prolonged times correct.
Although LAC is a phospholipid-dependent inhibitor of coagulation in
laboratory assays, in vivo the LAC’s interactions with phospholipid-rich
endothelial and platelet surfaces are thought to activate both platelets and the
coagulation cascade and result in hypercoagulation and thrombosis.

• Serologic assays for syphilis such as the venereal disease research
laboratory (VDRL) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests detect cardiolipin
phospholipids. When VDRL or RPR is positive, perform a confirmatory test
for antibodies against treponemes such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody
absorbed (FTA-ABS) test. A false-positive test for syphilis identifies an APA;
however, newer ELISAs for aCL have improved sensitivity and specificity and
are the preferred method for detection.

• Antibodies to beta-2-GPI are detected by IgM and IgG specific ELISAs.
• Testing for all APAs can be influenced by anticoagulants and acute thrombotic
events. Therefore, testing should be repeated in 6 weeks to verify results.
CRYOGLOBULINS
General Principles

• Immunoglobulins that are soluble at body temperature but reversibly precipitate
at lower temperatures are known as cryoglobulins.

• Cryoglobulins are classified into three types depending on the characteristics of
the immunoglobulins, and each type is associated with different diseases.
Type I cryoglobulins are monoclonal antibodies, usually of the IgM isotype.
They do not typically activate complement. Type I cryoglobulins are
typically
observed
in lymphoproliferative disorders and cause
vasooclusive symptoms.
Type II cryoglobulins are a mixture of polyclonal IgG and monoclonal IgM
antibodies, while type III cryoglobulins are polyclonal IgG and IgM
antibodies. These are associated with viral hepatitis and CTDs. As they
activate complement, types II and III cryoglobulins result in small vessel
vasculitis symptoms.
Laboratory Assessment

69

• A cryocrit is obtained using a minimum of 10 to 20 mL of fresh venous blood
that is drawn into prewarmed test tubes and transported to the lab in sand or
water warmed to 37°C. The specimen is allowed to clot at 37°C for 30 to 60
minutes before centrifugation. The supernatant is then left at 4°C for as long as
7 days; types I and II usually precipitate within 24 hours, whereas type III may
take days.

• Newer methods using electrophoresis can detect and quantify cryoglobulins,
but preheated tubes and warm transportation are still required.
COMPLEMENT
General Principles

• The complement cascade involves >30 proteins and accounts for 15% of the
globulin portion of plasma protein.

• Three pathways have been identified.
The classical pathway involves the opsonization and/or lysis of cells
covered with antibodies to cell surface antigens.
The alternative pathway involves the nonspecific opsonization and/or lysis
of foreign cells that lack cell membrane complement regulators.
The mannose-binding lectin pathway involves the opsonization and/or lysis
of foreign cells with mannose groups on the cell membrane.

• The rheumatic diseases that involve immune complex formation and subsequent
activation of the classic pathway include SLE, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis,
and Henoch–Schönlein purpura.

• The total hemolytic complement activity is a functional assay that tests the
integrity of the classical pathway. Low total hemolytic complement activity
suggests a deficiency of ≥1 factors.

• C3 and C4 are individual components of the complement cascade.
In SLE, low C3 and C4 complement levels may correlate with disease
activity, especially in lupus nephritis.
Conversely, complement proteins may act as acute phase reactants and
appear elevated during increased disease activity.
Not all patients have complement levels that correlate with disease activity,
and the pattern of correlation may vary with each patient. Nevertheless, once
70

a pattern is established in a particular patient, levels may be used to monitor
disease activity.
Low C4 levels are present in patients with cryoglobulinemic vasculitis,
reflective of complement activation by immune complex deposition.

• Congenital deficiencies in complements C1 and C4 increase the risk for SLE.
Laboratory Assessment

• Individual complement proteins such as C3 and C4 are measured by ELISA or
nephelometry.

• Total hemolytic complement activity (CH50) is measured by adding diluted
patient serum to antibody-coated sheep red blood cells (RBCs), and reported
as the amount serum required to lyse 50% of the RBCs.

Radiographic Imaging of Rheumatic Diseases
Ashwini Komarla and Leslie E. Kahl
APPROACH TO BONE AND JOINT RADIOGRAPHS

• The availability and technology behind imaging techniques has expanded
greatly in recent years. Imaging can aid in diagnosis and provide objective
assessment of disease severity and progression. Modalities useful in the
assessment of rheumatologic conditions include conventional radiography,
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound,
arthrography, angiography, radionuclide imaging, and bone densitometry.

• Conventional radiographs are the initial imaging choice for most rheumatic
conditions. Radiography has the ability to demonstrate fine bone detail and
detect small calcification, but it lacks the capacity to distinguish soft tissue
structures.
Its poor sensitivity to soft tissue contrast does not allow direct visualization
of inflamed synovial tissues, articular cartilage, bone marrow edema, or
periarticular tendons.
In inflammatory arthritis, it can detect the osseous erosions and joint space
narrowing that are the later irreversible sequelae of preceding synovitis. In
this manner, plain radiographs can provide limited yet very valuable
information about disease activity.
Despite its constraints, conventional radiography is universally available and
inexpensive and remains the mainstay in the basic imaging of arthritis.

• A simplified systemic approach using the mnemonic ABCDS can be used to
interpret bone and joint plain films.
A refers to joint alignment.
B refers to bone.
C refers to cartilage and joint space.
D refers to distribution.
S refers to soft tissue findings.
72

• Not all features described for each disease below are present at any one time,
and no individual abnormality is pathognomonic. See Table 6-1 for commonly
ordered radiographs for evaluation of arthritic joints and Table 6-2 for
radiographic findings of common types of arthritis.
OSTEOARTHRITIS

• Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common arthropathy.
• The most characteristic findings are nonuniform joint space narrowing and
formation of osteophytes, also known as bone spurs. Joint involvement can
be unilateral or bilateral.
TABLE 6-1
COMMONLY ORDERED RADIOGRAPHS FOR
EVALUATION OF ARTHRITIC JOINTS

• Joint erosions commonly seen in inflammatory arthropathies are not
present in OA.

• Subchondral bone cysts or subchondral bone formation (sclerosis) is also
associated with OA.

• OA most commonly affects the hands, feet, hips, knees, and the lumbar and
cervical spine. Involvement of the shoulders, elbows, and ankles is uncommon
unless there is a history of trauma or other preexisting disease.

• OA most frequently targets the hand, involving the distal interphalangeal
(DIP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints.
Bouchard’s and Heberden’s nodes refer to osteophyte formation at the DIP
and PIP joints, respectively.
73

There is usually sparing of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints.
The first carpometacarpal or trapeziometacarpal is the typical site of
degenerative abnormalities in the wrist.
Radial subluxation of the first metacarpal base is also common.
Without significant occupational trauma, degenerative arthropathy in other
joints of the wrist, like the radiocarpal joint, should suggest a diagnosis other
than primary OA.

• The most commonly affected joint in the feet is the first metatarsophalangeal
(MTP) joint.
It is commonly associated with hallux valgus (lateral deviation of the tip of
the first toe) or hallux rigidus (stiffness and painful restriction of
dorsiflexion in the first MTP joint).
Dorsal osteophytes are characteristic of OA in the foot, and subchondral bone
cyst formation is more common in the feet than in the hands.

• OA of the knees is common.
Bone growth may form and extend into the joint space when cartilage has
been lost.
Joint space narrowing is usually asymmetric and worse on the medial side,
although women often have lateral femorotibial disease. Varus angulation
of the knee is the most common deformity, demonstrating more severe
involvement of the medial femorotibial compartment than the lateral one.
TABLE 6-2 RADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS OF COMMON TYPES OF
ARTHRITIS

74

OA changes in the patellofemoral compartment are also common and can be
seen either alone or in addition to medial femorotibial compartment disease.
Assessment of cartilage thinning is best provided on tunnel projection or
weight-bearing position radiographs. Cartilage space narrowing is
documented if the joint space width is less than 3 mm, narrower than half the
width of the other articulation in the same knee or the same articulation in the
other knee, or smaller on weight-bearing compared to non–weight-bearing
radiographs. While joint space width has been shown to correlate with
cartilage thickness, a decrease in the joint space can also occur as a result of
meniscal degeneration.
Degenerative tears can be evaluated by MRI.

• OA of the hip may lead to significant disability.
Most often cartilage loss is focal and usually involves the weight-bearing
superolateral aspect of the joint, leading to upward migration of the
femoral head.
Diffuse loss of cartilage with axial migration of the femoral head is more
commonly seen in inflammatory arthropathies and secondary OA from
diseases like calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) deposition disease
(pseudogout).
OA of the sacroiliac joint (SI) is extremely common in elderly patients. On
radiography, it is characterized by joint space narrowing with a thin, distinct
band of subchondral sclerosis, especially around the ilium.
Osteophytes may appear as radiodensities at the superior synovial aspect of
the joint in the anteroposterior (AP) view.

75

• OA of the spine is commonly referred to as degenerative disk disease or
spondylosis and involves osteoarthritic changes of the apophyseal joints
between the vertebral bodies.
Disk space narrowing or apophyseal joint space narrowing and bone
sclerosis are commonly seen.
A potentially important complication of severe degenerative disk disease is
spondylolisthesis, which is movement of a vertebral body on the vertebral
body below it or on the sacrum. Movement occurs either forward
(anterolisthesis) or backward (posterolisthesis).
RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

• Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common systemic inflammatory
rheumatologic disease.
The distribution of arthritis is usually bilateral and symmetric in the small
joints but unilateral in large joints. RA also affects the appendicular skeleton
and cervical spine.
Joint changes are most frequently seen in hands, feet, knees, and hips,
and less commonly in the shoulder and elbow joints.

• Radiographs show periarticular soft tissue swelling and joint malalignment.
• The earliest radiographic change in RA is symmetric soft tissue swelling
around the involved joints in the hands and feet, with juxta-articular
osteoporosis often present.
Soft tissue swelling is caused by joint effusion, synovial proliferation, and
periarticular soft tissue edema.
In the hand, the MCP and PIP joints are involved.
Soft tissue atrophy and subcutaneous rheumatoid nodules develop in the later
stages of the disease.
Early marginal erosions are often subtle.

• Bony structures commonly have marginal erosions initially that may develop
into severe subchondral bone erosions.
New bone formation is not a feature of RA.
Erosions first appear where the articular cartilage is absent or thinnest and
may be subtle (first appearing as a disruption of the white cortical line).
76

In the wrist, early erosions often occur at the waist of the capitate, the
articulation of the hamate with the base of the fifth metacarpal, and the ulnar
styloid.
Later in the disease course, the MCPs and PIPs are uniformly involved and
all the carpal bones may be affected as a unit.

• Subluxations and dislocations such as ulnar deviation at the MCP joints are
common.

• Osteopenia due to hyperemia from chronic joint inflammation starts in the
juxta-articular region and progresses to generalized osteoporosis.

• Subchondral cysts are also common. They appear as radiolucent areas in the
bone. Occasionally, very large cystic lesions are found in the bones of the
elbow, hip, and knee joints, predisposing to pathologic fractures.

• Joint space narrowing is diffuse and uniform due to the progressive
destruction of articular cartilage. With increasing cartilage damage, the joint
space may become partially or completely obliterated by fibrous ankylosis and
eventually bony ankylosis can develop. This most characteristically occurs in
the wrist and the midfoot.

• In RA, the feet are almost as commonly involved as the hands.
In general, the feet are evaluated with posteroanterior and lateral views.
As in the hands, early involvement of the feet results in juxta-articular
osteoporosis and erosion of the bare areas at the metatarsal heads.
The lateral aspect of the head of the fifth metatarsal is usually involved
first. The heads of other metatarsals generally erode in a medial to lateral
direction.
At later stages of the disease, there are lateral subluxations of the proximal
phalanges and uniform loss of the MTP joint cartilage space. This leads to
forefoot deformities such as hallux valgus, hammer toes, cock up
deformities of the MTP joints, fibular deviation of the toes, and plantar
subluxation of the metatarsal heads.

• MRI, with its superior soft tissue contrast, offers a greater sensitivity for the
detection of some of the early changes of RA.
Inflammatory changes such as joint effusions, acute synovitis, pannus, and
synovial sheath effusions can be recognized with MRI.
The synovial membrane can be seen on MRI depending on the imaging
77

sequence and the nature of the tissue.
MRI is also the preferred method of imaging musculoskeletal complications
of RA, such as tendon ruptures, ischemic necrosis, insufficiency fractures,
and cervical spinal cord compression.
ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS

• Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) primarily affects the axial skeleton and less
commonly the appendicular skeleton.

• It is more ossifying than erosive in comparison to other inflammatory
arthropathies.

• The axial distribution of disease and the classic “bamboo spine” changes are
the two features that make the radiographic diagnosis relatively easy.

• Bone density is usually normal before ankylosis and becomes osteoporotic
after ankylosis.

• AS involves the SI joints and spine, especially the lumbar spine. The hips and
glenohumeral joints are the most common extra-spinal locations of disease.
Peripheral joints are usually only mildly involved.

• Subluxations, as seen in RA and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), are not seen in AS.
• The first abnormalities usually seen are in the SI joints.
The SI joints are commonly involved bilaterally and symmetrically and often
fuse completely.
Erosions and sclerosis are mild and sometimes subtle.
Abnormalities are usually more prominent on the iliac side of the articulation.
Subchondral bone resorption with loss of definition of the articular margins,
superficial osseous erosions, and osteoporosis are interspersed with focal
areas of bony sclerosis. This can progress to complete intra-articular bone
fusion with disappearance of the prior periarticular sclerosis.
The modified Ferguson view provides a better assessment of the SI joints
than standard AP views of the pelvis.
CT and MRI define the complex anatomy of the SI joints better than
conventional radiographs and are more sensitive to early changes. However,
most patients with clinical sacroiliitis can be diagnosed with high-quality
radiographs.
78

• The lumbosacral and thoracolumbar junctions are the usual sites of initial spine
involvement, with changes progressing in a caudocranial direction.
Osteitis of the anterior portion of the discovertebral junction is a common
initial finding.
On lateral radiographs, the vertebrae often look “squared.” This is due to
erosions at the anterosuperior and anteroinferior vertebral margins leading to
loss of the normal concavity of the anterior facet of the vertebral body.
Bony sclerosis adjacent to sites of erosion can produce a “shiny corner sign”
on radiographs.
Ossification of the outer fibers of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral
disk leads to vertically oriented bony outgrowths that are called
syndesmophytes.
The anterior longitudinal ligaments are the first visible sites of ossification.
With disease progression, the extensive syndesmophyte formation bridges
intervertebral disks producing a smooth vertical spinal contour labeled as
“bamboo spine.”
Erosions of the odontoid process may occur in cases of cervical spine AS
and result in atlantoaxial subluxation.
Enthesitis, bony proliferation and inflammation at sites of tendon and
ligament insertion, is notable in AS and other seronegative
spondyloarthropathies.
PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS

• PsA affects the axial and appendicular skeleton. An asymmetric bilateral or
unilateral polyarthritis is the most common presentation, but PsA can follow
varying patterns.

• PsA differs from RA radiographically in many important ways, particularly
with regard to periosteal
mineralization.

bone

proliferation and normal

bone

• In decreasing order of frequency, PsA involves the hands, feet, SI joints, and
spine. DIP joint involvement in the hands also differentiates PsA from RA.

• Periarticular soft tissue swelling can be striking in the hands and feet. The
swelling often extends beyond the joint into the soft tissue in the digit, forming
a “sausage digit”, which is very characteristic of this disease.
79

• The arthritis may be very erosive.
In severe cases, erosions can destroy large portions of the underlying bone
and give the appearance of a widened joint space.
In severe cases, the ends of the bones involved become pointy and produce
“pencil-in-cup” deformities.
Acroosteolysis and resorption of the distal phalanges of the hands and feet
is characteristic of PsA.
Bony proliferation is also relatively unique to PsA. It occurs adjacent to
areas of erosions, along the shafts of the bones, across joints, and at
tendinous and ligamentous insertion sites. Initial bone proliferation appears
fluffy and spiculated.
The radiographic changes of PsA in the feet are similar to those in the hands.
In particular, involvement is seen at the posterior and inferior aspects of the
calcaneus, sites of tendinous insertion.

• SI joint involvement on radiographs is found in 30% to 50% of patients with
PsA.
It is usually bilateral and may or may not be symmetric.
Erosions and bone proliferation are the usual findings and are more common
on the iliac side.
Bony ankylosis may occur in the SI joints, but it is much less frequent than in
AS.
Spondylitis usually occurs along with SI joint involvement.

• Large, bulky, and unilateral or asymmetric paravertebral ossification is a
characteristic finding in PsA, but the ossification may also appear as thin and
curvilinear densities.

• The cervical spine may be involved with atlantoaxial subluxation similar to
that in RA and AS.
REACTIVE ARTHRITIS (REITER’S SYNDROME)

• Many of the radiographic findings in reactive arthritis (ReA) are
indistinguishable from those in PsA.

• As in PsA, bone erosions, bone proliferation, uniform joint space
narrowing, ligamentous and tendinous ossification, a bilateral asymmetric
80

distribution, fusiform soft tissue swelling, and lack of osteopenia are
common in ReA.

• However, ReA has a different distribution with a predilection to the lower
extremities. It affects the feet, ankles, knees, and SI joints with less frequent
involvement in the hands, hips, and spine.

• Joint ankylosis is less common than in PsA, but heel changes may be more
prominent than in PsA.

• Clinical correlations are particularly important in differentiating ReA from
PsA.
SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

• Characteristic radiographic findings of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
include deforming nonerosive arthritis and osteonecrosis.

• Unlike other inflammatory arthropathies, there are no erosions or joint space
loss in SLE. However, subluxations and dislocations are often seen in SLE.

• The arthropathy is most commonly seen in the hands, wrists, hips, knees, and
shoulders. Symmetric involvement of the hands is typical, but the specific type
of deformity varies.

• Bone infarcts or osteonecrosis can occur as a result of chronic steroid use or,
less commonly, vasculitis. The femoral heads, femoral condyles, tibial
plateaus, humeral heads, and tali are the sites most frequently involved in
osteonecrosis.
CALCIUM PYROPHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE DEPOSITION DISEASE

• CPPD deposition disease is the most common crystalline arthropathy and
affects about 5% of the elderly population.

• The radiographic spectrum of disease ranges from subtle to striking, but certain
features are constant.
The hallmark of CPPD deposition disease is chondrocalcinosis, the
deposition of calcium salts in cartilage.
This finding is quite specific for CPPD deposition disease, and is most
commonly seen in the knee menisci and the triangular fibrocartilage of
81

the wrist. Other sites that are affected are the hips, pubic symphysis, and
spine.
The presence of chondrocalcinosis is not necessary to make the diagnosis
of CPPD arthritis, and conversely, some patients with chondrocalcinosis
are asymptomatic.

• Features of CPPD arthropathy are uniform joint space loss and sclerosis with
or without radiographically detectable intra-articular or periarticular
calcifications.
This is similar to OA, but the joints affected differ.
The pattern of distribution is bilateral and usually symmetric with the
patellofemoral, radiocarpal, and MCP joints often involved.

• Like OA, there are subchondral cysts, but they are typically more prominent in
CPPD deposition disease.
CPPD cysts appear as clusters of coalescent lucencies of variable size and
shape with indistinct margins.
This radiologic appearance is not usually seen in OA.

• As with other nonrheumatoid arthritides, bone mineralization is normal.
• CPPD arthropathy may be associated with rapid subchondral bone collapse
leading to fragmentation with intra-articular loose bodies, resembling
neuropathic osteoarthropathy.

• During acute attacks of pseudogout, the usual radiographic findings are soft
tissue swelling and joint effusion. Chondrocalcinosis may or may not be
present.
GOUT

• Chronic tophaceous gout is an asymmetric and erosive process with a
polyarticular distribution that most commonly involves the feet (especially
with first MTP joint) early, and hands, wrists, elbows, and knees later.

• Although tophi are not radiopaque unless they calcify, their effects on the
surrounding tissues allow for radiographic detection.
Periarticular tophi produce “punched-out” lesions in the adjacent bone.
Bone proliferation next to these lesions produces “overhanging edges.”

• Since tophaceous gout does not involve the cartilage directly, joint space is
82

preserved.

• This and preserved bone mineralization allow differentiation from RA and
other inflammatory arthropathies.

• The radiographic findings in acute gouty arthritis are nonspecific and include
soft tissue swelling, joint effusion, and periarticular osteopenia.

• When the acute arthritic attack subsides, the bone remineralizes, and the more
chronic, slowly progressive bony changes described above may develop.

• In severe cases, gout can lead to secondary OA, disuse osteopenia, and
occasionally mutilating arthritis.
SEPTIC ARTHRITIS

• No single radiographic feature distinguishes septic arthritis from the other
arthropathies.

• Typically, the history and physical exam lead one to suspect the diagnosis.
• The possibility of the superinfection of an already abnormal joint further
complicates the picture.

• When there is clinical suspicion of septic arthritis, joint aspiration should
be performed as soon as possible to confirm diagnosis and determine specific
treatment.

• Radiographic findings are relatively nonspecific.
Soft tissue swelling around the joint is the earliest finding, followed by
marginal erosions.
The synovial hyperemia and early disuse atrophy may result in periarticular
osteopenia.
Nongonococcal septic arthritis is typically monoarticular, with a rapidly
progressive radiologic course.
Destruction of the central cartilage and subchondral cortex causes central
erosion with loss of the cortical white line from the articular surfaces.
This is especially suggestive of the diagnosis.
Without proper treatment, deformities progress and ankylosis can develop.

• The most commonly involved joints are the knee and hip.
• Although radiologic findings are not specific to certain organisms, generally
83

nongonococcal bacterial arthritis is characterized by rapid destruction of bone
and articular cartilage with preservation of bone mineralization.

• Gonococcal arthritis rarely produces severe bony changes.
• Tuberculous arthritis is characterized by juxta-articular osteoporosis,
marginal erosions, and absent or mild joint space narrowing (Phemister’s
triad).

• The radiographic manifestations of fungal arthritis are similar to the
manifestations of tuberculosis.

• The MRI appearance of septic arthritis is also nonspecific, as similar findings
can be seen in inflammatory arthritis and early neuropathic joints. MRI can be
used to determine complications of septic arthritis, such as abscesses and
osteomyelitis.

• Radionuclide imaging is also not specific in differentiating septic arthritis from
inflammatory arthritis but is useful in ruling out osteomyelitis.

84

Rheumatologic Emergencies
Reeti Joshi and Leslie E. Kahl
emergencies, albeit uncommon, present diagnostic challenges and
R heumatologic
require prompt action. This chapter highlights common rheumatologic
1

emergencies.
INFECTIOUS ARTHRITIS

• The differential diagnosis of acute monoarthritis must always include
infectious (septic) arthritis. Fever and other constitutional signs are usually
present; however, they may be absent in immunosuppressed or geriatric
population.

• The common mimics of septic arthritis include acute gout or pseudogout,
reactive arthritis, hemarthrosis, and primary or metastatic bone tumors.

• The diagnosis of septic arthritis is made unequivocally by synovial fluid
analysis.
The fluid is sent for cell count and crystals (in a heparinized, lavender-top
tube), Gram stain and culture (in plain/red-top tube/culture media).
Synovial fluid white blood cell (WBC) counts more than 50,000 are
associated with septic joint; however, partially treated infections or
immunosuppression may be associated with lower cell counts.

• Therapy should not be delayed while awaiting confirmatory diagnosis as
septic arthritis has a mortality rate of about 10% and serious sequelae
including sepsis and joint destruction. Risk factors include delay in diagnosis
>3 days, increasing age, diabetes mellitus, and immunosuppression.

• Joints with orthopedic hardware warrant urgent surgical consultation.
• Empiric antibiotic treatment should include staphylococcal (including
methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) and streptococcal
coverage. Specific coverage for Salmonella, Pasteurella, and Gram-negative
organisms is to be provided on a case-by-case basis.
85

• Duration of therapy is guided by culture and sensitivity and is usually 3 to 4
weeks.

• See Chapter 32, Infectious Arthritis for a full discussion.
GIANT CELL ARTHRITIS

• Giant cell arthritis (GCA) or temporal arthritis (TA) is a primary systemic
vasculitis affecting large vessels distal to aortic arch. It is an often
overlooked rheumatologic emergency—given the risk of sudden and permanent
vision loss.

• The clinical presentation includes jaw claudication, headache (present in
about two-thirds of the patients), scalp tenderness, and nodularity along the
temporal arteries. Visual changes including acute, usually unilateral, vision
loss may occur.

• It is often associated with polymyalgia rheumatica, which is characterized by
aching and stiffness of hips and shoulder girdle muscles. It may include
symptoms of fever and symmetrical arthralgias in shoulder, hip, neck, and
torso.

• When the diagnosis of GCA is suspected, especially when associated with
symptoms of transient visual loss, blurry vision, diplopia, light scotomas,
and/or visual field narrowing, initiate treatment with oral prednisone at 1
mg/kg/day and then proceed with other evaluation.

• Definitive diagnosis requires a temporal artery biopsy.
As vessel involvement may be patchy, obtaining an adequate length of
affected tissue is essential.
Biopsy will still show characteristic histologic abnormalities after as much
as 2 weeks of high-dose steroid therapy.

• In suspected cases, a temporal artery ultrasound may be useful when done by
a center experienced in its use.2 A halo around the vessel indicates edema
along the vessel wall and is a specific but insensitive finding. This halo
resolves 2 to 3 weeks after therapy.

• Lab studies usually show a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (>50)
or C-reactive protein (CRP), anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase.

• Symptoms often rapidly resolve with steroid initiation.
86

• See Chapter 22, Giant Cell Arthritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica for a full
discussion.
SCLERODERMA RENAL CRISIS

• Scleroderma renal crisis (SRC) is a severe, sometimes life-threatening
complication that occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of patients with diffuse
scleroderma.

• SRC is characterized by rapidly progressive azotemia, malignant
hypertension, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia.

• Approximately 10% of patients are normotensive at presentation but
demonstrate these manifestations as well.

• Features of hypertensive encephalopathy including seizures may be present as
well.

• Risk factors include diffuse scleroderma, rapidly progressive skin disease,
presence of RNA polymerase III antibodies, presence of new pleural effusion
or congestive heart failure, cool ambient temperatures, and use of cocaine,
corticosteroids, or cyclosporine.

• Differentiating true SRC from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is
critical as the treatments are different.

• The pathogenesis of SRC reflects a severe vasculopathy leading to ischemic
activation of the renin–angiotensin system.

• Treatment involves blood pressure (BP) control starting with the use of shortacting angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors such as captopril
(initiate at 25 mg bid and titrate to maximum of 50 mg PO tid). Once the patient
is stabilized, long-acting ACE inhibitors may be used.

• ACE inhibitors must always be used even in the face of deteriorating renal
function with the goal of normalizing BP. Angiotensin receptor blockers
(ARBs) and direct renin inhibitors have a theoretical benefit; corticosteroids,
plasma exchanges and immunosuppressants have no benefits.

• For patients intolerant of ACE inhibitors, ARBs may be effective.
• Avoid intravenous (IV) antihypertensives, such as nitroprusside and
labetalol, and all nephrotoxins. Calcium channel blockers can be added to the
regimen of ACE inhibitor if necessary for BP control.
87

• Dialysis may be necessary for those patients with severe acute kidney injury.
• See Chapter 38 Scleroderma for a full discussion.
CERVICAL SPINE ABNORMALITIES IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

• Cervical spine involvement is a common manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA). Neurologic deficits can occur even in the absence of pain and, when
present, should be addressed urgently.

• The atlantoaxial joint is the second most commonly involved joint in RA after
the MCP joints.

• C1–C2 instability may result from tenosynovitis of the transverse ligament of
C1, erosion of the odontoid process, ligament laxity, ligament rupture, or
apophyseal joint erosion.

• Approximately 10% to 85% patients with RA have neck pain and radiographic
evidence of instability while approximately 10% to 60% will have neurologic
deficits.

• Risk factors include seropositivity, steroid use, rheumatoid nodules, and
erosive disease.

• The lesions most likely to lead to myelopathy are nonfixed atlantoaxial anterior
subluxation or downward/upward subluxation of the C1–C2 facet joints.
Cranial settling (also known as basilar invagination) in which the odontoid
process pushes up into the foramen magnum may also occur.

• Clinical features include headaches (compression of greater occipital branch
of cranial nerve II), loss of pain or touch over trigeminal nerve, sleep apnea,
downbeat nystagmus and internuclear ophthalmoplegia, facial diplegia and
dysphagia (cranial nerve IX dysfunction), and myelopathy.

• Radiographic changes of the C1–C2 joints are common but do not always
correlate with neurologic deficits.
Appropriate radiographs include cross-table lateral and dynamic flexion and
extension views with calculation of anterior atlanto-dens interval (ADI).
ADI >9 mm is associated with neurologic injury and requires fusion and
wiring.
MRI can provide additional information about cord compression, bone
destruction and the presence of pannus.
88

• Most severe instability occurs in flexion and the main goal is to prevent flexion
operatively with fusion or nonoperatively with an orthosis (Headmaster
Cervical Collar).

• Neurologic symptoms should be addressed with a neurosurgical evaluation for
possible stabilization procedures.

• In addition, patients with cervical spine arthritis are at increased risk of
traumatic injury during intubation and should be appropriately managed
perioperatively.
CRICOARYTENOID ARTHRITIS

• Cricoarytenoid arthritis (CA) is a rare complication reported in RA patients. It
is often asymptomatic and more common in women.

• Clinical symptoms and signs include hoarseness, inspiratory stridor,
sensation of foreign body in throat, dyspnea, and wheezing. These findings
may be mistaken for asthma.

• Fiberoptic laryngoscope with CT or MRI can be used to make the diagnosis.
• Nonurgent patients can be managed by local or systemic steroids.
• Surgical treatment is done only after failure of medical management. When
patients present with acute airway obstruction from CA, intubation is difficult
and tracheostomy and arytenoidectomy may be needed.
SUBGLOTTIC STENOSIS

• Subglottic stenosis is partial or complete narrowing of the subglottic area
presenting
distress.

as stridor, hoarseness, brassy voice, or acute respiratory

• Although acquired causes are commonly trauma, surgery and malignancy, this
can be seen in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated
vasculitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis), relapsing polychondritis, sarcoidosis,
and infections including diphtheria, syphilis and tuberculosis. It may occur in
Wegener’s granulomatosis even when the disease is clinically silent.

• Diagnosis is made by fiberoptic laryngoscopy with MRI/CT scan. Flow
volume loops showing fixed obstruction and virtual bronchoscopy may also
89

be useful.

• Although systemic immunosuppression can help, glucocorticoids and
intratracheal dilatation with intralesional steroids are necessary in clinically
significant disease.
Transverse Myelitis

• Transverse myelitis develops as an acute or subacute inflammatory disorder
of the spinal cord.

• Most cases occur following an infection or immunization. In addition,
transverse myelitis can be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE), other collagen vascular diseases, Sjögren’s syndrome, Behçet’s
disease, antiphospholipid syndrome, multiple sclerosis (MS), and
sarcoidosis.

• Symptoms of transverse myelitis may include focal neck and back pain,
paresthesias, weakness, sensory loss, urinary retention or incontinence,
fecal incontinence, and fever.
Symptoms typically start in the lower extremities and ascend.
The disease usually progresses over hours to days and varies in severity from
mild neurologic involvement to functional transection of the spinal cord.

• Diagnostic workup includes urgent spinal MRI, brain MRI (to evaluate for
MS), and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) analysis. MRI of the spinal cord reveals
variable spinal edema and signal enhancement.

• Obtaining normal CSF is useful to rule out acute infections. Alternatively,
pleocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose may be present.

• Treatment of transverse myelitis has not been well researched; however, highdose IV corticosteroids are usually initiated within 24 hours of diagnosis.
CAUDA EQUINA SYNDROME

• Cauda equina syndrome is a rare complication of the seronegative
spondyloarthropathies (related to arachnoiditis), in particular ankylosing
spondylitis (AS), lumbar disk rupture, spinal or epidural anesthesia, or mass
lesions from malignancies or infections.

90

• In patients with AS, symptoms may be slowly progressive. Cauda equina
syndrome from any cause, however, has the potential for rapid onset and
progression.

• Symptoms include severe low back pain, rectal pain, and pain in both legs.
In addition, with progressive disease patients can develop saddle anesthesia
w i th loss of bladder and bowel control, poor anal sphincter tone, and
impotence.
Patients may also develop variable lower extremity areflexia and asymmetric
leg weakness or loss of sensation.

• Cauda equina syndrome should be distinguished from sciatica or plexopathy,
which do not involve symptoms of incontinence or impotence.

• MRI can help confirm the diagnosis, and urgent neurosurgical consultation is
required to prevent irreversible neurologic changes.

• Steroids and localized radiation treatment may be beneficial with lesions
caused by malignancies.
PULMONARY HEMORRHAGE

• Pulmonary hemorrhage can be a complication of several rheumatologic and
nonrheumatologic diseases including ANCA-associated vasculitis and other
pulmonary renal syndromes, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (APS),
Behçet’s syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, mixed connective tissue disease,
polymyositis, RA, scleroderma, and SLE.

• Common presenting signs and symptoms include progressive dyspnea with
hypoxemia, hemoptysis, radiographic appearance of alveolar or interstitial
infiltrates, and anemia or a drop in hemoglobin level of 1.5 to 4 g/dL.

• Hypoxia and hemoptysis may be absent in one-third of the patients.
• Correction of hypoxemia and appropriate control of airway (possibly requiring
intubation and mechanical ventilation) and correction of coagulopathies should
be addressed immediately.

• Obtain early consult with a pulmonologist to assess the need for urgent
bronchoscopy to help refine the diagnosis.

• Demonstration of active bleeding or hemosiderin-laden macrophages in
bronchoalveolar lavage or sputum helps confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary
91

hemorrhage.

• Other possible etiologies include uremia, congestive heart failure, infection,
pulmonary infarction, pulmonary hypertension, and coagulopathy.

• Laboratory evaluation should include routine chemistries, liver function tests,
complete blood count, and coagulation studies as well as antinuclear
antibodies, antiglomerular basement membrane antibody, ANCA, and
complement levels (C3, C4, and CH50).

• Lung (or other involved tissue) biopsy may be required for a definitive
diagnosis.

• In addition to supportive treatment, target specific therapies at the underlying
disorder. Pharmacologic therapy may involve a combination of corticosteroids
(usually in high IV doses), cytotoxic agents, and sometimes plasmapheresis.
INTESTINAL INFARCTION

• Intestinal infarction is a rare complication associated with SLE and
polyarthritis nodosa. The disease is manifested by diffuse vasculitis of the
mesenteric blood vessels.

• Patients typically present with symptoms of an acute abdomen, which may be
masked however by corticosteroids or may occur late in the clinical
presentation.

• MRI may be useful in making the diagnosis.
• Emergent surgical exploration and resection is important, but overall
prognosis is poor.
CATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME

• Catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome (CAPS) is the most severe
presentation of APS with acute multiorgan involvement and vascular
microthrombi.

• The diagnosis of “definite CAPS” is made by histopathologic diagnosis, hightiter antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies and failure of three or more organ
systems in 1 week. Less than three organ system involvement is considered as
“probable APS.”

92

• Differential diagnosis includes TTP/hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS),
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), hemolysis, elevated liver
enzymes, low platelet count (HELLP) syndrome, sepsis and heparin-induced
thrombocytopenia.

• Fortunately this form only affects about 1% of APS patients. Infection is thought
to be a trigger.

• Mortality rate is high at around 30% but can be reduced with a combination of
anticoagulants, IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and plasma exchange.

• Selected cases may benefit from cyclophosphamide. Rituximab trials for CAPS
are under way.

• Patients who recover do relatively well on continued anticoagulation.
• See Chapter 39, for full discussion of the Antiphospholipid Syndrome.

8
Regional Pain Syndromes
Michael L. Sams and Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Regional pain syndrome refers to pain localized to one area of the body and not
caused by systemic disease. It encompasses many common musculoskeletal
sources of pain.

• These syndromes (also called soft tissue rheumatic pain syndromes) occur
frequently. They include disorders of bone, cartilage, ligament, muscle, tendon,
enthesis (sites where tendons attach to bone), bursa, fascia, and nerve.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Regional pain syndromes may be caused by trauma, injury from overuse, or
degeneration with aging.

• Consider infections, fractures, or other serious problems (e.g., deep venous
thrombosis in a patient with leg pain) in patients who develop regional pain
while in the hospital.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• History and physical examination are usually enough to make a diagnosis and
exclude systemic diseases such as cancer, infection, and arthritis
(inflammatory and noninflammatory) that may present as regional pain. Signs
and symptoms of a systemic process include weight loss, fever, rash, bilateral
symptoms, and synovitis (Table 8-1) and should lead to further investigation.

• Question patients about the location and characteristics of their pain, radiation
of the pain, duration, presence of numbness or tingling, their ability to function,
precipitating events, aggravating and ameliorating factors, underlying diseases
94

and systemic complaints. It may be helpful to ask the patient to locate the pain
with one finger.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination should include inspection (looking for atrophy,
asymmetry, alignment, swelling, erythema), palpation (warmth, crepitus, point
tenderness), evaluation of active and passive ranges of motion, and a
neurologic examination.

• Specific maneuvers exist to help identify involvement of specific structures.
• Always compare to the other side and examine at least one joint above and
below the suspected involved joint as too focused an examination may miss
abnormalities in other parts of the body or sources of referred pain.
TABLE 8-1 FEATURES THAT SUGGEST SYSTEMIC DISEASE

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Order laboratory tests only if there is suspicion of systemic disease.
• In particular, tests such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), rheumatoid
factor (RF), and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) have a low predictive value in
the general population. Abnormal results may be seen in patients with diseases
other than inflammatory arthritis or in healthy persons.
Imaging

• Imaging is rarely indicated at the initial evaluation.
• Problems of tendons, bursae, or nerves are not detected by plain radiographs.
95

• Osteoarthritis (OA) is a very common finding on plain radiographs but may be
misleading as in the case of patients with OA of the knee on radiographs but
knee pain due to anserine bursitis.

• Consider imaging in patients with a history of trauma, atypical symptoms, lack
of improvement or if surgery is planned.
Electrodiagnostic Testing
Electromyogram/nerve conduction velocities (EMG/NCV) may be helpful in
confirming nerve compression or involvement, especially if surgery is planned.
TREATMENT

• Most regional pain syndromes improve with conservative treatment. Table 82 presents a general guideline for managing regional pain syndromes.

• Some patients benefit from assistive devices such as splints.
TABLE 8-2 GUIDELINES FOR MANAGEMENT OF REGIONAL PAIN
SYNDROMES

• A referral to physical or occupational therapy to increase flexibility, strength,
endurance, improve alignment and receive education may help.

• Heat or cold application may also be beneficial.
• When needed, treat pain with medications; however, exercises, physical
modalities, and splinting are often more helpful. Medications include
nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, muscle
relaxants, and opiate analgesics.

• Some conditions improve with intralesional injections of lidocaine or
corticosteroids.

• Reassure patients that with time, most regional pain syndromes improve.
96

NECK PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Neck pain is less common than lower back pain but still affects one-third of the
population at some time. The majority of neck pain is not serious and most
cases are nonspecific.

• Pain may be due to involvement of the spine or surrounding soft tissues, spinal
cord, or nerve roots, or referred from other structures or organs (Table 8-3).
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Most causes of neck pain are benign and are due to strain/sprain in young adults
or OA in an older population. However, suspect a serious cause of neck pain
(e.g., meningitis, epidural abscess, septic discitis, vertebral osteomyelitis, or
metastatic lesions) in patients with a history of fever, intravenous drug use,
weight loss, progressive neurologic findings, or cancer.
TABLE 8-3 CAUSES OF NECK PAIN

97

• Sprains/strains of the cervical spine are common, especially in the young.
They may produce pain and are often the result of a maintained abnormal
posture, trauma or overuse of muscles. Whiplash is a subtype of sprain/strain
resulting after an acceleration/deceleration injury.

• In addition to causing strains and sprains, trauma can result in fractures.
• Spasm of the cervical musculature is a common component of pain after an
acute or chronic injury of the spine and may account for a substantial portion of
the pain.

• The neck is frequently involved in arthritis, both noninflammatory (OA) and
inflammatory (rheumatoid arthritis [RA], ankylosing spondylitis [AS]).
OA/spondylosis is a common cause of chronic neck pain in adults and the
elderly.
Spondylosis results from the degeneration of the disk, leading to loss of
disk height and creating abnormal mechanics with resultant OA of the
anterior (vertebral body) and posterior (facet) portions of the
intervertebral joints.
Bulging of the disk as well as vertebral subluxation can also occur with
this process.
98

Osteophytes can result and together with the loss of disk height, can lead to
mechanical pain and compression of nerve roots.
RA causes an erosive synovitis that frequently involves the neck in addition
to peripheral joints.
The synovitis and bony changes may encroach on the nerve roots.
Ligament involvement leads to laxity, instability and C1–C2 subluxation.
Acute subluxation causes severe pain and may compress the cord and
become life threatening. Subluxation may be spontaneous or follow mild
trauma, so maintain a high index of suspicion with RA patients who
develop neck pain. In the worst cases this can lead to impingement of the
spinal cord. Many patients may have radiographic evidence of subluxation
but be asymptomatic.
AS also affects the cervical spine, usually following progressive involvement
of the lumbar and thoracic spine. The cervical spine becomes stiff and
fractures may occur even with mild trauma.

• Cervical radiculopathy is due to encroachment on a nerve root as it exits its
intervertebral foramen. It can result from many causes including herniated disk,
degenerative disk disease and OA/spondylosis. Compression of the nerve root
can lead to neck pain and sensory changes that radiate into the arm. In
more severe cases it can cause motor weakness. Symptoms vary with the root
involved (Table 8-4).

• Cervical spine stenosis denotes narrowing of the central canal and can lead to
myelopathy, which is less common than radiculopathy but more serious. It can
result from both congenital causes and spondylosis. Spondylosis leads to
osteophytes, protruding disks and thickening of the ligamentum flavum that
cause narrowing of the canal and can compress the spinal arteries. Initially
patients may have localized neck and arm pain due to radicular involvement.
However, if the narrowing is more central it may lead to myelopathy with
upper motor neuron signs in the legs.
TABLE 8-4 NEUROLOGIC FINDINGS IN CERVICAL RADICULOPATHY

99

• Less common causes of pain include thoracic outlet syndrome, which is due
to compression of the neurovascular bundle as it exits the neck. Compression
may occur at several sites including between the anterior and middle scalene
muscles, the first rib and the clavicle or on a cervical rib.

• Other less common causes include brachial plexopathy and fibromyalgia.
• Nonmusculoskeletal causes of pain include angina, aortic dissection,
thyroiditis, and peritonsillar/retropharyngeal abscess.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• A good history should focus on the basic questions used to assess
musculoskeletal pain. The answers to onset, location, duration, symptom
quality, radiation, symmetry, sensory changes, motor changes, aggravating, and
relieving factors help to identify the source of pain.

• The presence of pain in other joints and other systemic symptoms are important
to decipher if there is a systemic process.

• A typical history of spasm/strain includes pain localized to the neck with
symptoms of muscle spasm. Typical inciting events are trauma, poor posture,
and overuse. It is more common in the young.

• Neck pain with or without radiculopathy in an older adult is likely due to
spondylosis/OA.

• Neck pain that radiates into the arm in a dermatomal pattern with associated
100

numbness and paresthesia is highly suggestive of cervical radiculopathy.
Weakness may or may not be present.

• Clinical manifestations of cervical myelopathy include weakness and
incoordination of the hands, lower extremity weakness and gait disturbances.
Incontinence is a late finding.

• Patients with RA or AS present with symptoms of the disease in other joints.
They will complain of morning stiffness that may take more than an hour to
resolve.

• Patients with thoracic outlet obstruction will likely have neurologic
symptoms in multiple dermatomes in addition to neck pain. Symptoms can be
aggravated by overhead activities.

• Other important questions include a history of drug use, infection, or fever to
identify a potential epidural abscess or septic discitis. A history of trauma to
suggest fracture, diffuse pain to suggest fibromyalgia, headache and fever to
suggest meningitis, or a history of cancer to suggest metastasis.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination of the patient with neck pain should include cervical
range of motion in all planes (which normally decreases with age). In RA
patients, limit range of motion testing to active range and not passive, given the
risk of subluxation.

• Palpation for spinous process tenderness is important to detect osteomyelitis
and fracture, but it is often also present due to mechanical problems. Tender
spots and muscle spasms may be noted in neck paraspinal muscles.

• A neurologic examination is crucial to detect the presence of radiculopathy
and myelopathy. Radicular compression may lead to sensory changes,
weakness, and diminished reflexes depending on the severity in a dermatomal
pattern. Neurologic defects may not be detected with mild radiculopathy.
As spondylosis can be extensive, more than one cervical root level can be
involved. Important findings suggesting myelopathy include upper and lower
extremity weakness with hyperreflexia/spasticity and a Babinski sign in the
lower extremities.

• Spurling test is helpful to assess if symptoms in the arm may be related to
radiculopathy. The test is performed with cervical extension and rotation to the
suspected side while providing axial pressure. This compresses the neural
101

foramina on that side, thereby aggravating nerve compression.

• Lhermitte sign is the sensation of an electric shock down the spine and into the
arms and legs with cervical extension. It may be present in cervical cord
compression.

• Roos hyperabduction/external rotation test is used to assess for thoracic
outlet syndrome. The arm is abducted to 90 degrees and externally rotated to
90 degrees and maintained in this position for 1 minute. The patient opens and
closes the hand throughout this time. It is considered positive if it provokes the
pain and paresthesias.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

• Consider imaging in patients with neck pain after trauma or with neurologic
findings and in cases of suspected fractures, metastatic lesions, or infections.

• Plain films may identify osteophytes and intervertebral space narrowing that
suggests disk degeneration. Oblique views may show narrowing of neural
foramina. Occasionally, a cervical rib may be noted which could support a
diagnosis of thoracic outlet syndrome.

• Open mouth and lateral flexion/extension radiographs may be needed to
evaluate the atlantoaxial joint for subluxation in RA. If not conclusive,
computed CT can be ordered.

• CT and MRI are more accurate in cases of suspected tumor or infection.
• MRI is the best technique to identify the cause and location of root
impingement.

• Radiographic abnormalities are extremely common in the elderly and correlate
poorly with symptoms.
Electrodiagnostic Testing

• Nerve conduction studies may be used to document the nerve root involved, but
are seldom necessary unless surgery is contemplated.

• They also may be helpful in determining if the location of nerve compression is
outside of the neck.

102

TREATMENT

• Most mechanical causes of neck pain will resolve with time and conservative
treatment.

• Strain/sprain: These cases may improve with heat application or rest and
usually resolve with time. Education on posture, avoidance of repetitive
motion or strengthening may help to treat the underlying cause.

• Treatment of neck OA is conservative. Some activity restriction is beneficial.
Soft cervical collars may provide symptomatic relief. Use rigid cervical
collars only in cases with instability and under close supervision. NSAIDs
are helpful, and local injections and cervical traction are sometimes used.
Symptoms may recur periodically with stress of the degenerated structures.

•

Myelopathy:
decompression.

Progressive

myelopathy

surgical

• Pharmacologic therapy includes NSAIDs, acetaminophen, muscle relaxants,
opiate analgesics, and gabapentin, depending on the symptoms that are present.
Opiates should be used with caution as they can be habit forming and are
ideally used only with acute pain.

• Epidural corticosteroid injections may be used for cervical radiculopathy.
• Physical therapy can be beneficial to educate the patient on appropriate
posture to reduce stress/compression on the involved structures. Patients can
be instructed on appropriate exercise to strengthen the involved structures and
to improve range of motion. Ultrasound and electrical stimulation can also be
performed which may help to provide some pain relief.

• Specific indications for surgery include bowel/bladder incontinence,
worsening neurologic function, progressive myelopathy and intractable pain
and radicular symptoms.1

LOW BACK PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Low back pain is one of the most common problems people experience. It is the
second most common reason to seek medical care (after upper respiratory
103

problems) and is the most common cause of disability in young workers.

• Most patients improve with conservative treatment over time, so education
and reassurance are important to prevent unnecessary testing and anxiety.

• About 1% of patients who present with new-onset back pain have systemic
diseases (cancer, infection, inflammatory disease).
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Many different conditions cause low back pain (Table 8-5).
• Mechanical disorders (muscle sprain, herniated nucleus pulposus, OA) are by
far the most common causes of back pain. Sprains may result from overuse,
trauma, or poor body mechanics. Herniated disks can compress a nerve
root(s) as they exit, or occur more centrally and cause cord compression,
depending on the size of the herniated fragment. As in the neck, spondylosis
can occur as well, leading to compression of nerve roots or myelopathy.
TABLE 8-5 DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF LOW BACK PAIN

104

• Spondylolysis is a defect of the pars interarticularis that can occur in young
patients who are active in sports that require frequent extension, flexion, and
rotation of the lumbar spine.

• Spondylolisthesis results from a bilateral defect of the pars interarticularis that
allows the vertebral body to slip forward relative to the rest of the spine. It
may be caused by congenital, developmental or degenerative causes.

• Cauda equina syndrome is the compression of the nerve roots as they exit the
distal spinal cord. The nerves can be compressed by any mechanism that
narrows the spinal canal. It is a surgical emergency.

• Inflammatory diseases that can cause low back pain include AS, inflammatory
bowel disease–related arthritis, reactive arthritis (ReA), and psoriatic arthritis
(PsA). Lumbar spine involvement in RA is rare.
105

• Cancer may present as a metastasis or a local tumor. In a study of >2000
patients with low back pain, no cancer was found in any patient aged <50 years
without a history of cancer, unexplained weight loss, or failure of conservative
therapy.2 The pain may be due to damage of the bone and joints themselves, or
to compression of neurologic structures.

• Infectious causes of low back pain include osteomyelitis, epidural abscess,
and septic discitis. Predisposing conditions include intravenous (IV) drug use,
concomitant infection, and endocarditis.

• Other visceral disorders can cause pain referred to the back and include
abdominal aortic aneurysm and dissection, pancreatitis, cholecystitis,
pyelonephritis, nephrolithiasis, and pelvic inflammatory disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• A careful history and physical examination are often enough to identify
systemic disease (Table 8-6).

• Inquire about the nature of the pain, aggravating and relieving factors and
neurologic symptoms.

• Clues to cancer in the history are age >50 years, history of cancer, unexplained
weight loss, lack of relief with bed rest, duration of pain and failure to
improve over 1 month, and nocturnal pain.

• Fever, concomitant infections and a history of IV drug use suggest infection
(spinal osteomyelitis, discitis.) Also suspect infection in patients who develop
low back pain while hospitalized.

• Morning stiffness of >1 hour with improvement with exercise, and onset before
the age of 40 years, suggests AS.

• Disk herniation may cause sciatica: pain, numbness, and paresthesias radiating
to the lower extremity below the knee.

• Bowel or bladder dysfunction, saddle anesthesia, and bilateral lower extremity
weakness are signs of spinal cord compression (cauda equina syndrome).
Patients with these symptoms should undergo immediate imaging and surgical
referral (see Chapter 7, Rheumatologic Emergencies).
106

• Symptoms of spinal stenosis due to degeneration/spondylosis mimic those of
vascular insufficiency and are often referred to as neurogenic claudication.
There is typically pain in the bilateral buttocks and thighs with walking upright,
as this position causes lumbar extension which narrows the spinal canal. The
pain is better when patients lean forward to increase lumbar flexion, as
happens when walking with a shopping cart. The pain resolves after a very
brief period of sitting down, in contrast to the pain of vascular claudication,
which may take much longer to resolve.

• Spondylolisthesis and spondylolysis are often aggravated by lumbar extension.
Radicular symptoms are not typically present.

• A history of older age, female sex, thin build, and prednisone use may suggest
osteoporosis with a compression fracture.

• Inquire about non-lumbar spine-related symptoms of RA, ReA and
inflammatory bowel disease associated arthritis if an inflammatory cause is
suspected.

• A history of vascular disease may suggest abdominal aortic aneurysm or
vascular claudication.
Physical Examination

• Lumbar range of motion should be assessed in all planes. Often pain will be
worse in flexion with a herniated disk. Pain is likely to be worse in extension
with spondylolysis and spinal stenosis. Other sources of back pain can limit
range and cause pain in multiple directions.

• Localized tenderness over the midline is seen in vertebral fractures due to
osteoporosis, metastatic disease, multiple myeloma or osteomyelitis. Spinal
tenderness can also be present from mechanical causes. Tenderness in the
paraspinal muscles may represent spasm or a muscle strain.

• The general physical examination may provide clues to underlying systemic
disease. Fevers (infection, inflammatory disease, cancer), murmurs
(endocarditis), breast masses (metastases), pulsatile abdominal masses, and
pulse abnormalities (aortic aneurysm) are important findings.

• The neurologic examination should identify spinal nerve root involvement or
cord symptoms (Table 8-7). Sphincter tone and saddle anesthesia should be
assessed if suspecting cauda equina.

• A positive straight-leg raising test suggests nerve root compression. The test
107

is performed with the patient supine, and the leg is raised with the knee fully
extended. A positive test reproduces pain radiating below the knee when the
leg is raised. Compare the excursion of the straight-leg raise from one side to
other. The involved side will have less range of motion. Low back pain
without radiation below the knee does not constitute a positive test.

• Schober’s test should be performed to help assess for limited flexion with
suspected spondyloarthropathy
Examination).

Joint

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory tests (e.g., ESR, CRP, UA, CBC, cultures) may occasionally help
exclude systemic disease.
Imaging

• Plain radiographs are overused. They are recommended only for patients with
fever, unexplained weight loss, history of cancer, neurologic deficits,
alcohol or injection-drug abuse, and trauma.

• CT scans and MRI are more sensitive than plain radiographs. However, they
often reveal abnormalities even in asymptomatic adults. On MRI, up to 40% of
young, asymptomatic volunteers have herniated disks and >90% of subjects
>60 years have degenerative disks. CT and MRI should be reserved for
cases with a strong suspicion of cancer or infection or for patients with
persistent neurologic deficits.

ROOT INVOLVEMENT

109

• A bone scan may reveal a stress injury at the pars interarticularis in a young
active adult.
TREATMENT

• Most patients improve with conservative treatment over time, so education
and reassurance are important to prevent unnecessary testing and anxiety.

• Acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants are effective for idiopathic
acute low back pain. Opioids may be required. Gabapentin may be needed for
pain from nerve compression.

• Physical therapy may be useful for patients with persistent pain. Patients may
benefit from strengthening of abdominal and back muscles as well as education
on rest and body mechanics.

• Encourage patients to return rapidly to their normal activities, but avoidance of
heavy lifting may be prudent until the pain improves.

• Patients with herniated disks may require short-term opioids for pain control.
• Bed rest does not accelerate recovery in idiopathic low back pain or
sciatica.

• Patients should be reassured that pain resolves in most cases within 12 weeks.
• Spinal stenosis may also benefit from NSAIDs, but the prognosis for relief of
symptoms is not so good.

• Surgical evaluation should be immediate in patients with cord/cauda equina
compression or progressive neurologic deficits. Patients with spinal stenosis
and persistent, disabling pain and patients with herniated disks and persistent
sciatica with neurologic findings may benefit from surgical referral.

• Chronic lower back pain is difficult to manage and sometimes requires a
multidisciplinary approach to address rehabilitation, depression, or substance
abuse.

SHOULDER PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

110

• Shoulder pain is the second most common musculoskeletal complaint after low
back pain.

• The shoulder is exceedingly mobile at the expense of some stability. Stability is
provided by the glenoid fossa, labrum ligaments, and rotator cuff. Hence
damage of these structures can reduce stability and lead to further injury and
pain.

• The rotator cuff is composed of the tendons of the supraspinatus, infraspinatus,
teres minor, and subscapularis muscles, and attaches to the humeral
tuberosities. The supraspinatus location between the acromion and the humeral
head explains why pain from rotator cuff disease worsens with elevation of the
arm (impingement).

• The shoulder is made up of four joints that are typically affected in different
types of arthritis: glenohumeral joint (affected in RA, calcium pyrophosphate
deposition disease [CPPD], septic arthritis, and OA), acromioclavicular (OA),
sternoclavicular (AS, septic arthritis), and scapulothoracic.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• There are many causes of shoulder pain (Table 8-8).
• Impingement is caused by impingement of the rotator cuff and/or subacromial
bursa on the under surface of the acromion and/or acromioclavicular ligament.
The acromion and ligament form an arch over the humeral head, and the
supraspinatus and bursa lie between the humeral head and this arch.
When reaching up, especially with shoulder in internal rotation these
structures are opposed to each other.
Normally the rotator cuff helps to stabilize the humeral head in the glenoid
fossa, but with injury, weakness or tendinopathy of the rotator cuff the
humeral head may translate superiorly during overhead activities leading to
impingement.
Scapular muscle weakness may also contribute to impingement.

• Rotator cuff tendinopathy is the most common cause of shoulder pain. It
may be acute or chronic and may be associated with calcium deposits in the
tendon (calcific tendinitis). It may be due to overuse, mild trauma, age-related
degeneration, and osteophytes on the inferior portion of the acromion.

• Subacromial bursitis may be associated with rotator cuff tendinitis or other
111

abnormal mechanics that cause impingement of the bursa against the acromion
or coracoacromial ligament.

• Rotator cuff tears may be partial or complete and may be due to trauma or the
result of gradual degeneration. Complete tears cause inability to abduct the
shoulder.

• Bicipital tendinitis can result from overuse, especially in laborers or weight
lifters. A bicep tendon tear may occur in an older adult.

• Adhesive capsulitis (“frozen shoulder”) is an inflammation of the shoulder
capsule that causes generalized pain with severe loss of active and passive
ranges of motion. It may be due to diabetes, inflammatory arthritis, or
prolonged shoulder immobilization.

• Acromioclavicular OA may occur with chronic repetitive irritation.
• Instability may occur secondary to injury of the ligaments through trauma,
including dislocation. It may also be due to a primary laxity of the patient’s
connective tissue. The end result can be pain from impingement.
TABLE 8-8 CAUSES OF SHOULDER PAIN

112

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• Impingement/subacromial bursitis/rotator cuff tendinopathy: Pain is usually
over the lateral deltoid and worsens with overhead activity. Night pain due to
difficulty positioning the painful shoulder is common.

• Rotator cuff tendon tears: Complete tears cause inability to actively abduct
the shoulder.

• Biceps tendinopathy usually causes anterior shoulder pain.
• Adhesive capsulitis causes a painful shoulder with loss of range of motion.
113

Patients will complain of difficulty reaching behind their backs to put on a shirt
or reaching overhead to comb their hair.

• Acromioclavicular (AC) arthritis causes pain over the AC joint that is
aggravated by reaching across the body or overhead.
Physical Examination

• Both passive and active ranges of motion should be assessed. In adhesive
capsulitis passive and active ranges will be decreased, whereas in many other
shoulder disorders active range will be decreased, but passive range will be
normal or near normal.

• Palpation of the subacromial space should be performed to assess for bursitis
or supraspinatus tenderness. The subscapularis can be palpated anteriorly just
inferiolaterally to the coracoid process. The infraspinatus and teres minor can
be palpated posteriorly and inferiorly to the acromion. Also palpate the
acromioclavicular joint for tenderness.

• The impingement sign is typically positive in supraspinatus tendinopathy,
impingement, and subacromial bursitis (but may also be seen in other shoulder
diseases). The sign is elicited by passively forward flexing the patient’s
internally rotated arm with the examiner holding down the scapula with the
other hand. This produces pain in cases of impingement.

• The drop arm test is positive with a large rotator cuff tear. It is performed by
placing the arm at 90 degrees abduction and instructing the patient to lower it
slowly to the side. The test is positive when the patient is unable to perform the
motion smoothly.

• Biceps tendinitis is suspected when the bicipital groove along the anterior
humeral head is tender on palpation. Pain with supination of the forearm
against resistance or forward flexion of the externally rotated arm against
resistance is seen.

• Have the patient horizontally adduct the arm across the chest to stress the AC
joint. Pain at the AC joint suggests that this joint is irritated.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

• Plain films are needed if the history and physical examination suggest a
dislocation, fracture, or a primary/metastatic tumor.
114

• MRI (or ultrasound) may distinguish between partial and complete rotator cuff
tears.
TREATMENT

• Treatment of rotator cuff/bursitis/impingement injuries includes rest and
specific exercises to strengthen the rotator cuff and improve range of motion.
Prolonged immobilization of the shoulder in any shoulder disease should be
avoided as it may cause adhesive capsulitis. NSAIDs and local anesthetic with
corticosteroid injections are also used. Surgery may be needed to address the
impingement.

• Biceps tendinitis is treated with rest and rotator cuff strengthening as is rotator
cuff tendinitis.

• Adhesive capsulitis treatment is with physical therapy for aggressive range of
motion, injections, and occasionally surgery.

• The AC joint may be injected if needed and surgery may be performed if
conservative treatment does not help.

• Surgery is necessary to repair complete rotator cuff tears.
ELBOW PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Elbow pain is usually caused by periarticular disorders.
• The elbow joint is frequently involved in RA but rarely in OA.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Olecranon bursitis may be septic or idiopathic, due to inflammatory conditions
(RA, gout), or trauma. It can be caused by repetitive low-pressure trauma, such
as frequently resting on the olecranon. The bursa is located just proximal to the
olecranon.

• Lateral and medial epicondylitis are known as tennis and golfer’s elbow,
respectively, but may be due to any type of activity. Lateral epicondylitis is
115

more common. They occur at the origin of the common extensor tendon (lateral
epicondylitis) and flexor tendons (medial epicondylitis). The name is
somewhat of a misnomer as the pathologic process is a degeneration of the
tendon due to overuse. This misnomer applies to tendinitis throughout the body.
Actual inflammation is rare and microscopic tearing and scarring may be
present.

• The biceps and triceps tendons and the epicondylitis muscles can also produce
pain with overuse.

• Ulnar nerve entrapment occurs at the cubital tunnel where the nerve passes
through. The nerve can become irritated by direct pressure, repetitive motion,
osteophytes, and prolonged elbow flexion.

• Other causes of pain include septic arthritis, RA, gout, pseudogout, and
compression of the posterior interosseous nerve just distal to the posterior
elbow as it passes through the supinator.
Clinical Presentation
History

• Olecranon bursitis can begin acutely or chronically. If it is infectious it will be
quite painful. Patients will complain of a visible swelling posteriorly that will
vary in the amount of pain present depending on the cause.

• Patients with medial or lateral epicondylitis will complain of pain localized to
the respective epicondyle. Pain is aggravated with repetitive use of the hand.
They may often occur in laborers.

• Ulnar nerve compression will produce symptoms of posteromedial elbow
soreness that is aggravated by resting on the medial elbow. Tingling will be
noted in the fourth and fifth digits. Complaints of numbness may be present.
Weakness is possible.

• Gout pain will be acute with complaints of swelling. RA will involve other
joints. A septic joint will be quite painful with fever present.

• Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment may produce complaints of
posterolateral elbow pain and occasionally numbness/tingling in the lateral
forearm and hand. Weakness of the wrist and finger extensors is expected.
Physical Examination

116

• Begin the examination by noting flexion, extension, supination, and pronation
range of motion. Palpate the major tendons at their origins or insertions for
tenderness. Visually inspect for joint or bursa swelling, warmth, and erythema.

• Olecranon bursitis presents with swelling over the posterior elbow. The
surrounding area may be swollen, warm, and erythematous in septic bursitis.
Septic bursitis usually does not compromise elbow mobility as a septic elbow
joint does. Septic bursitis should be aspirated (taking care to avoid penetrating
into the elbow joint).

• Lateral epicondylitis presents with tenderness localized to the lateral
epicondyle at the insertion of the common extensor tendon. Pain is exacerbated
by resisted wrist extension as well as resisted middle finger extension.

• Medial epicondylitis is diagnosed by tenderness over the medial epicondyle at
the insertion of the flexor tendons and by painful resisted wrist flexion and
forearm pronation.

• Percussion of the ulnar nerve in the cubital tunnel and prolonged elbow flexion
will produce pain and paresthesia in ulnar nerve entrapment. Check the
sensation in the fourth and fifth digits.

• Posterior interosseous nerve entrapment symptoms can be aggravated with
resisted supination with the elbow at 90 degrees and fully flexed. There will
be tenderness 5 to 6 cm distal to the lateral epicondyle over the supinator.
Weakness is present on testing wrist and finger extension.
TREATMENT

• Non-septic olecranon bursitis due to trauma can be treated with NSAIDs,
avoiding aggravating activity and a compression strap. It may need aspiration.
It can be injected with corticosteroids but may recur. Septic bursitis should be
treated with antibiotics and may need to be aspirated daily. Surgery may be
required.

• Treatment of lateral and medial epicondylitis includes rest and avoidance of
exacerbating activities. NSAIDs may be helpful for both conditions. A tennis
elbow strap may be beneficial. Corticosteroid injections may be needed for
short-term relief, if an inflammatory component is suspected. The injection
should not be directly into the tendon. Surgery to debride degenerative portions
of the tendon is an option if conservative treatment fails.

117

• Ulnar nerve entrapment can be treated conservatively with the use of an
elbow pad. The pad cushions the posteromedial elbow during the day to
reduce pressure on the cubital tunnel. At night the pad can be rotated so that it
is anterior in the cubital fossa. This placement prevents excessive elbow
flexion at night. Occasionally, ulnar nerve transposition is required.

• Posterior interosseous nerve compression can be treated with rest from
offending motions. If symptoms do not improve then surgery for decompression
is possible.

HAND AND WRIST PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• The hand and wrist are frequently affected by arthritis, both inflammatory (RA,
lupus, PsA) and noninflammatory (OA). The presence or absence of synovitis,
joint deformities, and the specific joints involved may lead to a diagnosis.

• OA typically affects the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints and the first
carpometacarpal (CMC) joints.

• RA affects the wrist, metacarpophalangeal (MCP), and the proximal
interphalangeal joints, sparing the distal interphalangeal joints and the first
CMC.

• Hand and wrist pain may also be due to periarticular disorders and infections.
• Unilateral pain is often due to trauma, overuse or infection; consider arthritis or
systemic diseases in patients with bilateral pain.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a very common cause of hand pain. The
median nerve and the flexor tendons pass through a tunnel at the wrist limited
by the carpal bones and the transverse carpal ligament. CTS may be idiopathic
but is also seen in pregnancy, RA, diabetes, obesity, and myxedema and with
disorders that encroach on the nerve (osteophytes, tophi, amyloid deposits).

• The ulnar nerve, as discussed earlier, may become entrapped at the elbow,
causing hand pain and numbness or paresthesias of the ulnar side of the ring
and little fingers. Compression of the ulnar nerve at the wrist causes similar
118

symptoms and may be due to trauma or fracture of the carpal or fifth
metacarpal bones.

• De Quervain’s tenosynovitis is the inflammation of the extensor pollicis
brevis and abductor pollicis longus tendons at the level of the radial styloid
that causes pain, tenderness, and occasionally swelling of that area. It may be
due to repetitive thumb pinching while moving the wrist.

• Tenosynovitis and tendinopathy may also occur in other flexor and extensor
tendons. Localized pain and tenderness on palpation and with resisted
movement are seen. Tenosynovitis/tendinopathy may be due to overuse,
trauma, RA or may be idiopathic.

• Infectious tenosynovitis may be seen in gonococcal arthritis and as a result of
puncture wounds.

• Ganglions are the most common soft tissue tumors of the hand and wrist. They
are mucin-filled cysts that arise from adjacent tendon sheaths or joint capsules.
They usually appear on the dorsal aspect and are painless but may limit
movement if large.

• Trigger finger is a common cause of hand pain and discomfort. Trigger finger
is due to thickening of the retinacular pulley in the palm or a fibrous nodule on
the tendon that interferes with flexion. The thumb, ring, and long fingers are
most commonly affected. Corticosteroid injections or surgery are helpful.

• Dupuytren’s contracture is a thickening and shortening of the palmar fascia
that results in visible thickening and cording of the palm that is usually
painless. The ring finger is affected most frequently. It may be idiopathic and is
also seen in diabetics or in patients with chronic alcohol abuse.
Clinical Presentation
History

• CTS: Pain and tingling of the hand is characteristic but may extend to the wrist,
forearm, arm, and sometimes, shoulder. Numbness and paresthesias are felt in
the distribution of the median nerve (thumb, index, and middle fingers; radial
aspect of ring finger). The hand may be weak and clumsy and feel swollen.
Bilateral disease is common. Women are affected more frequently.

• Patients with de Quervain’s tenosynovitis will complain of radial-sided wrist
pain that is worse with gripping tightly.

119

• Tendinopathy presents with pain localized to a tendon that is aggravated by
activity and relieved with rest.

• Patients with infectious tenosynovitis will complain of significant pain and
swelling along the tendon. They are likely to complain of fever, depending on
the acuity of the infection.

• Patients with trigger finger note painful clicking on the palmar aspect, and
locking of the finger in flexion. These symptoms may be intermittent.
Physical Examination

• To diagnose CTS the examination should identify median nerve involvement
and exclude cervical or brachial plexus abnormalities. Weakness and atrophy
of the thenar muscles are usually late findings. Tinel and Phalen’s signs may be
present but are neither sensitive nor specific. Tinel’s sign is distal paresthesias
produced by sharp tapping over the median nerve at the wrist. Phalen’s sign is
reproduction of symptoms when the wrists are held flexed against each other.
The “flick” sign may be more accurate: When asked “What do you actually do
with your hand(s) when the symptoms are at their worst?” patients with CTS
do a flicking movement with their hand(s) similar to how someone would
shake water off their hands.3

• Finkelstein’s test is positive in de Quervain’s tenosynovitis when passive
ulnar deviation of the wrist while the fingers are flexed over the thumb
reproduces pain.

• Tenosynovitis /tendinopathy can be diagnosed by localized pain and tenderness
on palpation and with resisted movements. Infectious tenosynovitis will
display edema, warmth, and erythema with likely surrounding cellulitis and
drainage.

• On examination of trigger finger, difficulty extending the finger from flexion is
noted. A palpable nodule may be felt.

• Dupuytren’s presents with a lump in the hand and difficulty extending the
fingers. The contraction worsens with time.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging
Order radiographs in patients with hand trauma and visible abnormalities of the
joints.
120

Electrodiagnostics
Nerve conduction studies are usually diagnostic in unclear cases of CTS.
TREATMENT

• Treatment of CTS begins with conservative measures including nighttime
splinting in a wrist cock-up splint, rest, and NSAIDs. Careful injection with
corticosteroids is helpful. Surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament is
beneficial if conservative measures fail.

• De Quervain’s tenosynovitis responds to rest, splinting, and NSAIDs. Surgery
or corticosteroid injection may be indicated in refractory cases.

• Tenosynovitis and tendinopathy are treated with rest, ice, and NSAIDs.
• Infectious tenosynovitis requires drainage and antibiotics.
• Dupuytren’s contracture benefits from stretching and corticosteroid injections
in the initial stages, but surgery may be needed to release chronic contractures.

• Ganglions are treated with aspiration and surgical excision if they limit motion
or are cosmetically unacceptable.

• Corticosteroid injections or surgery is helpful for trigger finger.
HIP PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Hip pain is a very common complaint and may be due to articular and
periarticular disorders, or may be referred from other structures (Table 8-9).

• Different disorders cause pain in different areas around the hip joint, which
may be useful for diagnosis. Ask the patient to point to the location of maximal
pain.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Hip OA is a very common cause of hip pain and increases with age. True hip
joint arthritis usually causes pain in the anterior groin that worsens with
weight bearing (see Chapter 11, Osteoarthritis).
121

• Lumbosacral spine and sacroiliac (SI) joint disease cause buttock pain, as do
spinal stenosis and vascular insufficiency.
TABLE 8-9 CAUSES OF HIP PAIN

• The hip joint is affected in RA (usually late in the disease) and in juvenile RA
and the seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

• Fractures of the femoral neck are common in elderly women with osteoporosis
and may occur after a fall.

• Avascular necrosis (AVN) commonly affects the hip joint. Refer patients with
fractures and osteonecrosis for orthopedic consultation.

• Trochanteric bursitis is very common and causes lateral hip pain that may
radiate down the thigh and can be severe. It is more common in the elderly and
is often associated with OA of the lumbar spine or hip.
122

• Ischiogluteal bursitis is caused by trauma or prolonged sitting on hard
surfaces. It results in pain over the ischium.

• Iliopsoas bursitis is caused by inflammation of the bursa located between the
hip joint and the overlying psoas muscle. Anterior thigh and groin pain are
present.

• Meralgia paresthetica is caused by compression of the lateral femoral
cutaneous nerve at the groin. This condition is seen in pregnant or obese
patients, and in people who wear tight garments or heavy belts. Eliminating the
source of compression and, occasionally, corticosteroid injections are useful.

• Labral tears of the hip are more common in young active patients. They may
occur with trauma or insidiously. Patients complain of groin pain that is
worsened with activity.

• Piriformis syndrome is a compression of the sciatic nerve as it passes deep to
or through the piriformis and can cause pain in the buttock with numbness and
tingling in the leg in a non-dermatomal pattern.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• Hip arthritis will cause pain in the groin that is aggravated with weightbearing activities. Patients will also note decreased range of motion when
attempting to sit with legs crossed.

• OA of the lumbar spine can refer pain to the buttock and patients will often
complain that this is hip pain.

• AVN of the hip will present with groin pain that is aggravated with weight
bearing.

• Patients with trochanteric bursitis will complain of pain that is worse with
lying on the affected side. They often note pain when they first stand up that
improves after walking for a few minutes but, may worsen if they walk for a
prolonged period.

• In ischiogluteal bursitis the pain is over the buttocks, may radiate down the
thigh, and is worse with sitting. As this is the origin of the hamstring muscles
differential diagnosis includes hamstring tendinopathy.
123

• Meralgia paresthetica causes anterior or lateral thigh pain that can be
accompanied by numbness or paresthesias.

• Labral tears typically cause chronic hip pain in a younger patient that often is
difficult to diagnose. Activity aggravates symptoms.

• Piriformis syndrome presents with complaints of buttock pain with paresthesia
and pain in the posterior leg.
Physical Examination

• Hip arthritis is identified by decreased range of motion and pain in the groin
with combined flexion/adduction and internal rotation. Combined
flexion/abduction/external rotation (FABER test) can also illicit pain in the
groin.

• Pain originating in the hip joint in general will be aggravated by combined
flexion/internal rotation and adduction. The FABER test will also provoke
symptoms.

• On examination of trochanteric bursitis, localized tenderness with palpation
of the trochanteric area (the uppermost area with the patient lying on his or her
side) and pain with resisted abduction are seen.

• Iliopsoas bursitis is identified by a combination of pain with palpation or with
hyperextension or with resisted flexion. Ischiogluteal bursitis is noted with
palpation over the ischium.

• Labral tear symptoms can be elicited with the FABER test.
• In piriformis syndrome the posterior buttock will be tender and stretching of
the piriformis muscle may aggravate the symptoms.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

• Imaging is reserved for cases of trauma and suspected fracture, for patients
with hip pain and risk factors for AVN (corticosteroid use, alcohol abuse), and
for patients with chronic hip pain.

• MRI is useful to establish the presence of a labral tear.
TREATMENT
124

• Trochanteric bursitis treatment consists of stretching exercises, weight loss,
and NSAIDs. Injection of the trochanteric bursa area with lidocaine and
corticosteroids is a relatively simple procedure and may bring relief.

• Both ischiogluteal and iliopsoas bursitis respond to conservative measures of
rest, NSAIDs and, potentially, corticosteroid injections.

• Meralgia paresthetica can be addressed by eliminating the source of
compression. Occasionally, corticosteroid injections are useful.

• Labral tears can be treated with arthroscopic surgery.4
• Piriformis syndrome is treated with stretching, massage and, if recalcitrant,
surgery.

KNEE PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Knee pain is a very common complaint and can be due to articular or
periarticular disorders (Table 8-10).

• Common arthritides such as OA, RA, and gout frequently affect the knee.
Etiology and Pathogenesis

• Knee OA is a very common cause of knee pain. It is insidious in onset, but
often has its origins after trauma earlier in life that damaged the normal
cartilage or created abnormal mechanics in the knee.
TABLE 8-10 CAUSES OF KNEE PAIN

125

• There are multiple intra-articular structures (articular cartilage, meniscal
cartilage, cruciate ligaments) that may degenerate with age, overuse, or trauma
and lead to internal derangement.

• Knee pain may be referred from hip disorders.
• Anserine bursitis derives its name from the pes anserinus, composed of the
conjoined tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles that
insert in the medial proximal tibia. The associated bursa often becomes
inflamed, causing medial knee pain. Anserine bursitis often coexists with knee
OA or occurs with athletic activity.

• Prepatellar bursitis causes pain (and occasionally erythema, warmth, and
swelling) anterior to the patella and is common in people who spend a lot of
time on their knees. This bursitis is occasionally septic, so send fluid for
cultures. Infrapatellar bursitis presents similarly to prepatellar bursitis.

• Tendinopathy: Degeneration of the tendons around the knee may occur with
overuse. Tendinitis may occur with inflammatory arthritis.

• Patellar tendinopathy is seen in young athletes who engage in repetitive
jumping or kicking (jumper’s knee). Pain is over the patellar tendon.

• Popliteal tendinopathy causes posterolateral knee pain.
126

• The quadriceps and patellar tendons may rupture due to trauma and repetitive
injuries and in patients with RA and lupus and those who are receiving
corticosteroids. Sudden pain and inability to extend the knee result.

• Iliotibial band syndrome is due to friction as the band passes over the lateral
femoral condyle with flexion and extension. Repeated motions such as running
promote repetitive friction. Excessive pronation may increase the amount of
stress on the band as it passes over the condyle.

• Patellofemoral pain is thought to be due to malalignment (poor positioning of
the patella) as it moves up and down the trochlear groove of the femur during
flexion and extension. Softening of the cartilage with some non–full thickness
breakdown may occur resulting in chondromalacia patellae.

• Popliteal cysts (Baker’s cysts) may be asymptomatic or cause swelling in the
popliteal fossa area. Cysts may be seen in patients with OA or RA and often
communicate with the knee joint cavity. Large popliteal cysts may rupture and
cause pain, swelling, and erythema of the calf, mimicking venous thrombosis.

• Osgood–Schlatter disease is seen in adolescents and presents with pain at the
site of the insertion of the patellar tendon to the tibial tuberosity.

• Osteochondritis dissecans occurs most often in the teenage years and is due to
focal necrosis of the subchondral bone. The overlying cartilage is thereby
fragile and fragments of cartilage and bone can break off and form a loose
body in the joint. It usually occurs in patients involved in athletics.

• Other less common causes of knee pain can include a synovial plica, which can
be irritated and cause anteromedial knee pain. Pigmented villonodular
synovitis is an overgrowth of the synovial lining of a joint and can occur in the
knee. It leads to vague knee pain and swelling.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• OA symptoms include brief morning stiffness and pain with use.
• Suspect internal derangement in patients, often young adults, who complain of
“locking” or “catching” sensations after trauma (particularly sports injuries).
Commonly they will report acute, painful swelling (due to hemarthrosis) at the
127

time of injury. They may also note the knee giving way with pivoting after an
anterior cruciate ligament tear.

• Medial knee pain occurs with anserine bursitis. Young patients are typically
active in athletics. Pain is noted with using stairs and may improve after a few
minutes of activity.

• Lateral knee pain occurs with iliotibial band syndrome. It is typical in runners
and bikers.

• Anterior knee pain aggravated by activity can reflect patellofemoral pain. It is
characterized by pain in the patellar region that is worse with using stairs and
running. Brief stiffness after prolonged sitting is common. Osgood–Schlatter’s
may be causing the pain in a pubertal male who is involved in sports. Patellar
tendinopathy can cause anterior knee pain with activity as well.

• Posterior knee pain can result from hamstring tendinitis, popliteal tendinitis, or
Baker’s cyst.

• Knee pain occurs in osteochondritis dissecans. There may be symptoms of
catching or limited range of motion if a loose body is present.
Physical Examination

• On physical examination of the osteoarthritic knee, tenderness along the joint
line, small effusions, and crepitus may be found. There may be decreased range
of motion (see Chapter 11, Osteoarthritis).

• Specific maneuvers on physical examination may detect damage to the internal
structures with internal derangement.

• Palpation is helpful in locating the specific structure involved.
• Arthrocentesis is relatively simple to perform on the knee and should be done
in cases of monoarthritis to exclude infection, crystal-induced arthritis, or
hemarthrosis.

• The anserine bursa is point tender to palpation just inferior to the medial joint
line. Swelling is not usually appreciated.

• Prepatellar bursitis will present as a large swelling anterior to the patella. It
may be red and warm suggesting possible infection. Arthrocentesis can help to
establish the presence of infection.

• The popliteal tendon will be tender to palpation in the posteriolateral knee with
tendinopathy. Resisted knee flexion with the tibia externally rotated may
128

reproduce pain.

• In iliotibial band syndrome there is point tenderness over the band at the
lateral condyle of the femur. Swelling is not typically present.

• Patellofemoral pain can be identified by palpating for tenderness on the
posterior surface of the patella while the knee is extended and the quadriceps
are relaxed. The pain can also be reproduced when the patella is held
immobile while the patient contracts the quadriceps muscle.

• Tenderness and a prominent size of the tibial tuberosities will be noticed with
Osgood–Schlatter disease.

• With the patient lying prone with both knees extended a swelling in the
popliteal fossa will be notable if Baker’s cyst is evident.

• A painful plica may be palpated medial to the medial border of the patella.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

• In general, reserve imaging for post-traumatic pain and for patients with
chronic pain. Ligament and meniscal tears are noted with MRI.

• Ultrasound can be used to diagnose Baker’s cyst and to rule out more serious
pathology, such as a popliteal artery aneurysm or a soft tissue tumor.

• Plain films can identify osteochondritis dissecans. Then MRI can be used to
determine the extent and stability of the lesion.

• Pigmented villonodular synovitis can be identified on MRI.
TREATMENT

• Anserine bursitis treatment includes rest, ice, and stretching. If symptoms do
not improve then corticosteroid injections can be helpful.

• In prepatellar bursitis, recommend avoiding kneeling to help resolve the
bursitis. However, aspiration may be needed in cases with abundant fluid.
Surgical excision may be necessary for frequent recurrences.

• Patellar tendinitis treatment is rest, ice application, and stretching exercises.
Corticosteroid injections are contraindicated due to the risk of tendon rupture.

• Popliteal tendinopathy responds to hamstring strengthening. Be sure to rule out
129

an acute ligamentous injury to the knee if the injury is traumatic.

• Treatment of rupture of the patellar tendon and quadriceps tendon is surgery.
• Iliotibial band syndrome is treated by rest, physical therapy, orthotics, and
stretching of the band. Corticosteroid injections may be needed if no
improvement occurs with therapy. Surgery is a last resort.

• Patellofemoral pain is treated initially with rest from aggravating activities.
Gradual pain-free strengthening of the quadriceps muscle and hip abductors is
recommended. Orthotics may help improve knee alignment in those with
increased pronation. Patellofemoral supports may provide some patients relief.

• Treatment of Osgood–Schlatter syndrome is rest from offending athletic
activities. It usually resolves as the patient grows older.

• A symptomatic Baker’s cyst can be treated with aspiration and injection of the
knee joint with corticosteroids.

• Treatment of osteochondritis dissecans can be conservative or surgical
depending on the extent of the lesion.

• Treatment of pigmented villonodular synovitis is surgical removal of the
overgrown synovium; however, it can recur.

• Treatment of a painful plica involves quadriceps strengthening and hamstring
stretching. Surgery can be performed to remove the plica if it does not
improve.

ANKLE AND FOOT PAIN
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Ankle and foot pain are common problems and may be due to periarticular
disorders, arthritis, or trauma, and are often worsened by inappropriate
footwear.

• The history and physical examination usually lead to a diagnosis. A history of
diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, or peripheral vascular disease is particularly
important.
Etiology and Pathogenesis
130

• Arthritis frequently affects the ankle and foot. OA spares the ankle but often
involves the first metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joint causing lateral deviation
(hallux valgus or bunion). Bunions are more common in women.

• RA affects the ankle and forefoot in most of the patients. Bilateral ankle pain
and synovitis and forefoot pain usually accompanies other joint involvement.

• The first MTP is the most commonly affected joint in acute gout.
• Motor, sensory, and autonomic neuropathies (seen in diabetic and other
peripheral neuropathies) may lead to ankle and foot pain and severe deformity
in neuropathic arthropathy (Charcot joint).

• Ankle sprains are very common in outpatients and usually follow ankle
inversion after a misstep or fall.

• Stress fractures are common causes of foot pain and occur as a result of
overuse. They are often seen in dancers, runners, or military recruits and affect
the second or third metatarsals most frequently.

• Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of plantar foot pain and is due to
inflammation of the plantar fascia at its insertion into the calcaneus. It may be
idiopathic or due to overuse, and is sometimes seen in patients with
seronegative spondyloarthropathies.

• Achilles tendinitis occurs when the Achilles tendon becomes inflamed due to
trauma or overuse (dancers, runners). Heel pain due to Achilles tendon
enthesopathy is characteristic of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies. The
tendon may rupture due to trauma, or spontaneously in patients taking
corticosteroids or quinolone antibiotics. Injection of the Achilles tendon with
corticosteroids may also lead to rupture. Patients with tendon rupture have
difficulty walking and foot dorsiflexion.

• Inflammation of the retrocalcaneal bursa may be difficult to distinguish from
Achilles tendinitis.

• Posterior tibial tendinitis causes pain along the tendon near the medial
malleolus.

• Peroneal tendinitis causes pain anterior to the lateral malleolus.
• Tarsal tunnel syndrome is characterized by pain, numbness, and paresthesias
of the sole. The posterior tibial nerve is compressed at the flexor retinaculum,
posterior to the medial malleolus.

• Morton’s neuroma is due to compression of an interdigital nerve, most
131

commonly between the third and fourth toes. It causes forefoot pain and
numbness and tingling of these toes. It occurs more frequently in middle-aged
women and is exacerbated by walking and by wearing narrow shoes or high
heels.

• Metatarsalgia (pain arising from the metatarsal heads) may be due to high
heels, everted foot, arthritis, trauma, or deformities, and is quite common.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• Stress fractures become more painful as an activity continues.
• Plantar fasciitis causes pain that is worse in the morning, especially when the
patient first stands up. Pain may also occur after prolonged standing or walking
and may be severe.

• Tendinitis is often most painful when beginning an activity and then becomes
less painful as the area “warms up.”

• Patients often feel a pop as if they have been “shot” when the Achilles ruptures.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination should include inspection (looking for deformities,
abnormal calluses), palpation (of tender areas), testing of sensation, and
evaluation of distal pulses.

• Examine the patient’s footwear. Signs of abnormal (or unilateral) wear or
frequent use of high heels or narrow pointed shoes are important clues.

• Tophi and deformities at the first MTP joint may be seen in chronic gout.
• Ankle sprains will present with edema and tenderness to palpation over the
ligament(s) involved. Valgus and varus testing is provocative for ligament
injury.

• Palpation of the involved bone will produce tenderness with a stress fracture.
• Tenderness over the distal edge of the plantar surface of the calcaneus will be
present in plantar fasciitis.

• Tenderness over the tendon will be present with Achilles tendinitis.
132

• Tenderness just proximal to the insertion of the Achilles and between the
tendon and the calcaneus will be present with retrocalcaneal bursitis.
However, it is difficult to distinguish the two.

• Rupture of the Achilles tendon can be noted as an anatomical defect, but also
by the Thompson test. The patient lies prone with the knee extended.
Squeezing the calf muscle will cause plantar flexion if the tendon is intact. If
the tendon is ruptured, plantar flexion will not occur.

• In tarsal tunnel syndrome tapping over the nerve as it passes around the
medial malleolus may reproduce symptoms. The area may be tender to
palpation.

• Squeezing the metatarsal heads together can aggravate the pain of Morton’s
neuroma.

• Palpation over the metatarsal heads reveals tenderness in metatarsalgia.
Diagnostic Testing
Imaging

• Radiographs are rarely useful except in cases of trauma.
• According to the Ottawa guidelines for ankle sprains, obtain radiographs to
rule out fracture in patients with medial or lateral malleolar tenderness or with
inability to bear weight after the event or in the emergency department (ED).

• The Ottawa guidelines for foot injuries recommend plain films to rule out
fracture if there is pain in the midfoot after the injury and if any of the
following are present: There is tenderness at the base of the fifth metatarsal or
the navicular, or if the patient cannot bear weight after the event or in the ED.

• Radiographs sometimes do not detect stress fractures. Bone scan or MRI may
be used for diagnosis.
Electrodiagnostic Testing
When considering surgery for tarsal tunnel syndrome, electrodiagnostic testing will
help confirm the diagnosis.
TREATMENT

• Treatment of foot and ankle pain is conservative. Rest, stretching exercises, and
133

NSAIDs are frequently used.

• Orthoses and appropriate footwear are an essential part of care in many
cases. Assistance from podiatrists and orthotists is invaluable.

• A shoe with a wide toe box provides symptomatic relief for bunions, but
surgery is often performed for cosmetic reasons.

• Stress fracture treatment is usually conservative.
• Ankle sprains are initially treated with rest, ice, compression, and elevation
followed by gradually increasing range of motion and strengthening exercises.

• Plantar fasciitis is treated with stretching of the calf muscles, heel
inserts/orthotics and NSAIDs. Occasionally corticosteroid injections are used.

• Treatment of Achilles tendinitis is conservative, but rupture requires surgical
evaluation. Retrocalcaneal bursitis treatment involves rest and NSAIDs.

• Posterior tibial and peroneal tendinopathy respond well to rest. Arch
supports/orthotics help to decrease pronation and the stress that it causes on
these tendons.

• In tarsal tunnel syndrome corticosteroid injections are helpful but should be
done carefully. If excessive pronation is present, orthotics should be provided.
Surgical decompression may be needed.

• Properly fitting footwear with sufficient width or a metatarsal pad is helpful in
treating Morton’s neuroma. Corticosteroid injections are sometimes used for
relief. Some patients require surgery.

• Proper footwear and a metatarsal pad are helpful in treating metatarsalgia.

Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases
Alfred H.J. Kim and Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• While rheumatologic diseases encompass a wide range of organ systems, there
are a relatively limited number of drug classes for treatment.

• The main classes of medications used in rheumatology include:
Analgesics
Salicylates/Non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory
(NSAIDs)/Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors
Glucocorticoids (GCs)
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)
Biologics
Gout medications
Antihyperuricemics
Antiinflammatory
Osteoporosis medications

drugs

ANALGESICS

• Analgesics largely reduce pain, not inflammation. Consequently, their use is
limited in rheumatology as many diseases are strongly inflammatory.

• Analgesics are very useful for osteoarthritis (OA) given their minimal side
effect profiles.

• Medications
Acetaminophen
Dosage: 325 to 650 mg PO q4 to 6 hours or 1000 mg PO q6 to 8 hours.
Limit to 4 g/24 hours in liver-competent patients and ≤2 g/24 hours with
hepatic insufficiency.
136

Mechanism: Largely unclear, although it inhibits prostaglandin synthesis
in central nervous system (CNS). There may also be inhibition of COX
isoenzymes.
Side effects: It is generally well tolerated. Combination with
hepatotoxicity agents, such as ethanol, potentiates hepatotoxicity. It can
increase INR when large doses are given with warfarin.
Contraindications/precautions: Chronic alcohol use, liver disease,
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency.
Tramadol
Dosage: 50 to 100 mg PO q4 to 6 hours.
Mechanism: It binds to μ-opiate receptors in CNS, inhibiting ascending
pain pathways, and also inhibits norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake.
Side effects: Somnolence, dizziness, headache, nausea, vomiting.
Contraindications/precautions: History of alcohol or drug use, chronic
respiratory disease, liver disease, concomitant use of tricyclic
antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), or
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), seizure disorder.
Tramadol has a synergistic effect on pain when combined with
acetaminophen. They are often prescribed together.
SALICYLATES/NSAIDS/COX-II INHIBITORS

• Used for antiinflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic purposes.
• These drugs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX), with other
unidentified mechanisms likely contributing to effect.

• Salicylates and NSAIDs block COX-I and COX-II nonspecifically, while
COX-II inhibitors predictably inhibit only COX-II.

• COX converts arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, leukotrienes, or
thromboxanes, leading to a complex response involving both pro- and
antiinflammatory actions.

• COX-II is an inducible enzyme that leads to a proinflammatory phenotype.
• Adverse effects seen with salicylates and NSAIDs are diverse, including
Gastrointestinal (GI): Gastritis and ulcer formation which can lead to
perforation (particularly with age >65, smoking, higher duration and dose of
137

NSAIDs; risk=1%/patient year).
Renal: Hypertension, hyperkalemia, reduction in efficacy of diuretics and
antihypertensives, edema (due to vasoconstriction and water and sodium
retention), rarely interstitial nephritis (with long-term, chronic use).
CNS: Headaches, aseptic meningitis, tinnitus (with ASA), altered mental
status, aseptic meningitis.
Hepatic: Transaminitis, Reye’s syndrome in children with viral illness.
Hematologic: Impaired platelet aggregation (reversible except with
salicylates), anemia (usually from GI blood loss).
Hypersensitivity reactions: Samter’s triad of nasal polyps, asthma, and
hypersensitivity to all NSAIDs is due to excessive leukotriene production
after NSAID administration. Other hypersensitivity reactions, such as rash,
can also occur separately from Samter’s triad.

• COX-II inhibitors reduce GI events by 20%–40%, and do not inhibit
platelet aggregation. Renal and hypersensitivity reactions equal to NSAIDs.

• See Table 9-1 for a list of medications.
GLUCOCORTICOIDS

• GCs, also referred to as corticosteroids or steroids, remain one of the most
effective antiinflammatory and immunosuppressive medications, and also
possess significant toxicity with prolonged use.

• Patients taking alternate day GC therapy, low dose prednisone (<5 mg/day), or
GCs less than 3 weeks usually do not have suppression of the
hypothalamic/pituitary axis (HPA). Anyone who is on ≥20 mg/day or has
clinical Cushing’s syndrome is assumed to have HPA axis suppression.
Otherwise, there is variable suppression of the HPA axis.
TABLE 9-1 NSAIDS AND SELECTIVE COX-2 INHIBITORS

138

139

• Medications
Prednisone (PO), prednisolone (PO), hydrocortisol (PO/IM/IV),
methylprednisolone (IV/intraarticular), dexamethasone (PO/IV/IM),
triamcinolone (intraarticular) (see Table 9-2 for equivalent doses of
GCs).1
Dosage: Highly dependent on disease and clinical situation (Table 9-3).2
Mechanism: Effects are pleiotropic and include: Inhibition of leukocyte
trafficking, restriction of leukocyte access to inflamed tissue, attenuated
production of inflammatory humoral mediators and inhibition of various
functions of leukocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells.
Side effects: Adverse effects are usually seen with doses ≥10 mg/day
and may impact the following systems:
Musculoskeletal (secondary osteoporosis, myopathy).
Endocrine (hyperglycemia, weight gain, iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome).
Cardiovascular (dyslipidemia, hypertension).
TABLE 9-2 COMPARISON OF REPRESENTATIVE CORTICOSTEROID
PREPARATIONS
140

Dermatologic (acne, purpura and cutaneous atrophy due to catabolic
effects).
Ophthalmologic (cataract, glaucoma).
Infectious (overall relative risk of infection is 2.0, but is dosedependent).
Psychological (psychosis, minor mood disturbances).
Contraindications/precautions: Systemic infection (especially fungal),
heart failure (due to fluid retention), diabetes mellitus (hyperglycemia),
hepatic impairment, acute myocardial infarction (risk of myocardial
rupture), myasthenia gravis (exacerbation of symptoms may occur).
Special considerations: For patients with suspected HPA axis
suppression, GCs must be tapered off gradually, not discontinued abruptly,
to allow for recovery of the HPA axis. Additionally, those undergoing
major surgery may need stress-dose GCs until 48 hours postoperatively
and should be monitored for signs of adrenal insufficiency.
DISEASE-MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUGS

• This group of medications has both anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
effects, with highly variable clinical responses.

• They are usually used as steroid-sparing therapy, and have a slow onset of
141

action.

• There is a high rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy or drug toxicity.
TABLE 9-3 APPROXIMATE DOSAGES OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS FOR
VARIOUS CLINICAL SITUATIONS AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE
EFFECTS

• Medications
Hydroxychloroquine
Dosage: 4 to 6 mg/kg/day, which is usually 200 to 400 mg PO qday. The
400 mg dose can be split into 200 mg bid.
Mechanism: It inhibits neutrophil trafficking and complement-dependent
antigen–antibody responses. It also interferes with lysosomal enzymes.
Onset of action: 4 to 6 weeks.
142

Side effects: This drug is generally well tolerated, but some patients may
have indigestion or hypersensitivity rash; retinopathy and bone marrow
suppression are rare complications.
Contraindications/precautions: It carries a boxed warning for use by
experienced physicians only. History of hypersensitivity or visual changes
on related therapy, G6PD deficiency, psoriasis (may worsen on therapy),
macular degeneration are contraindications to its use. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) pregnancy category: C (animal reproduction
studies have shown an adverse effect on the fetus and there are no
adequate and well-controlled studies in humans, but potential benefits may
warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks).
Monitoring: Ophthalmologic examination is required q6 to 60 months
(depending on dose, length of therapy, age, and baseline retinal health).
Methotrexate
Dosage: Start with 10 to 15 mg/week (PO/IM/SC), and increase 5 mg q2
to 4 weeks as needed to a maximum of 20 to 25 mg/week.
Mechanism: It inhibits dihydrofolate reductase, acting as folate
antimetabolite that inhibits DNA synthesis.
Onset of action: 3 to 6 weeks, but additional improvement can be seen up
to 12 weeks.
Side effects: Anorexia, nausea, diarrhea, stomatitis, transaminitis are not
rare, and all can be reduced with administration of folic acid 1 mg daily;
pneumonitis and infection are much less common.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for acute renal
failure, bone marrow suppression, dermatologic reactions (including toxic
epidermal necrolysis), diarrhea/stomatitis, hepatotoxicity, lymphomas,
infections, pneumonitis, and ascites/pleural effusions (reduced
eliminationof methotrexate). Chronic alcohol use is a contraindication.
FDA pregnancy category: D (positive evidence of human fetal risk
based on adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing
experience or studies in humans, but potential benefits may warrant use of
the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks), and breastfeeding is
contraindicated.
Monitoring: A baseline complete metabolic profile (CMP), complete
blood count (CBC), and chest radiographs are required. CMP and CBC
should be done q2 to 4 weeks for first 3 months, then q8 to 12 weeks next
143

3 to 6 months, then q12 weeks afterward. Liver biopsy should be
performed if persistent hepatic function profile (HFP) abnormalities,
alcoholism, or chronic hepatitis B or C, and pulmonary function tests if
lung toxicity suspected.
Leflunomide
Dosage: 10 to 20 mg PO qday.
Mechanism: It inhibits dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, inhibiting de novo
pyrimidine synthesis.
Onset of action: 4 to 8 weeks.
Side effects: These include diarrhea, alopecia, hepatitis, rash, infection,
hypertension, and headache.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for severe
liver injury. Renal or hepatic impairment, chronic alcohol use, and
preexisting bone marrow suppression are contraindications to its use. It is
teratogenic; FDA pregnancy category: X (Studies in animals or humans
have demonstrated fetal abnormalities and/or there is positive evidence of
human fetal risk based on adverse reaction data from investigational or
marketing experience, and the risks involved in use of the drug in
pregnant women clearly outweigh potential benefits).
Monitoring: Screen for pregnancy and tuberculosis prior to therapy.
Baseline CMP and CBC are required. Blood pressure, CMP, phosphate
(leflunomide can occasionally increase renal excretion of phosphate), and
CBC should be monitored q4 weeks for first 6 months, then q12 weeks.
Discontinue leflunomide and initiate cholestyramine therapy if alanine
aminotransferase ALT ≥2 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or other
serious adverse effects occur.
Sulfasalazine
Dosage: Start with 500 to 1000 mg PO daily, increasing weekly as needed
to 2 to 3 g/day divided in 2 equal doses.
Mechanism: This drug interferes with prostaglandin synthesis.
Onset of action: 8 to 12 weeks.
Side effects: Headache, rash, anorexia, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting,
reversible oligospermia, dizziness, bone marrow suppression,
transaminitis may all occur. GI symptoms are less common with the
enteric-coated form of the drug.
144

Contraindications/precautions: Sulfa allergy, G6PD deficiency, renal or
hepatic impairment, GI or genitourinary (GU) obstruction. FDA
pregnancy category: B (animal reproduction studies have failed to
demonstrate a risk to the fetus and there are no adequate and wellcontrolled studies in pregnant women or animal studies have shown an
adverse effect, but adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant
women have failed to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in any trimester).
Monitoring: Baseline CMP and CBC are required, and should be repeated
q2 weeks for first 3 months, then q4 weeks for the next 3 months, then q12
weeks afterward.
Azathioprine
Dosage: Start with1 mg/kg/day PO daily or divided bid for 6 to 8 weeks,
then increase by 0.5 mg/kg q4 weeks as needed until response or up to a
maximum of 2.5 mg/kg/day.
Mechanism: This drug antagonizes purine metabolism, with 6-thioguanine
nucleotides mediating most of the effects.
Onset of action: 6 to 8 weeks.
Side effects: Leukopenia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, myalgia, malaise,
dizziness, hepatotoxicity, and HFP abnormalities may all occur and are
usually dose-dependent.
Contraindications/precautions: Boxed warning for use by experienced
physicians only and increased risk of neoplasia. History of treatment with
alkylating agents. FDA pregnancy category: D.
Monitoring: Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) genotyping or
phenotyping prior to therapy can help guide initial dosing. CBC and CMP
should be done at baseline. CBC should be repeated qweekly during first
month, q2 weeks during months 2 and 3, then qmonthly, with CMP q3
months.
Mycophenolate mofetil
Dosage: Start with 500 mg PO bid, and increase by 1000 mg q3 to 4
weeks as needed to a maximum dose of 1500 mg PO bid.
Mechanism: This drug inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase
(IMPDH), which inhibits de novo guanosine nucleotide synthesis, thereby
reducing lymphocyte proliferation.
Onset of action: Unknown.
145

Side effects: The most common adverse effect is nausea. The following

divided twice daily, increasing by 0.5 to 0.75 mg/kg/day after 8 weeks.
146

Additional dosage increases can be done again at 12 weeks as needed to a
maximum of 4 mg/kg/day. For lupus nephritis, start at 4 mg/kg/day for 1
month, then reduce by 0.5 mg/kg/day q2 weeks to maintenance dose of 2.5
to 3 mg/kg/day.
Mechanism: This drug inhibits interleukin (IL)-2 production and release
from T lymphocytes.
Onset of action: 4 to 12 weeks.

experienced physicians only. Patients should be monitored for
development of hypertension, infection, malignancy (lymphoma and skin),
nephrotoxicity, and skin cancer. FDA pregnancy category: C.
Monitoring: Baseline studies should include blood pressure and
creatinine. Thereafter, monitor creatinine q2 weeks for the first 3 months,
then qmonthly. If hypertension develops, decrease dose by 25 to 50%; if
hypertension persists, discontinue the drug. No additional benefit has been
seen in monitoring cyclosporine levels.
BIOLOGICS

• Biologics represent a novel class of therapeutics that take advantage of modern
recombinant protein engineering techniques that selectively block a pathway
important in immunity.

• Biologics have revolutionized the treatment of many rheumatic conditions,
leading to response rates that have been unmatched with prior therapies. This
class has also occasionally reactivated prior infections that have lead to
significant morbidity and mortality.

• Prior to initiating any biologic, ensure patient is up-to-date with vaccinations
and screened for tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Live virus
vaccines are contraindicated once a biologic has been initiated. Biologic
use is discouraged with any of these infections.

GI perforation (especially with concurrent NSAID use) may occur.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for infections,
151

including TB. Avoid use in patients taking NSAIDs, or with a history of
diverticulosis or peptic ulcer disease, active hepatic disease, or hepatic
impairment. Patients should be monitored for bone marrow suppression
and demyelinating disease. Avoid concurrent use with other biologics.
Monitoring: CBC, CMP, and lipid panel should be checked at baseline
and q4 to 8 weeks (lipid panel can be checked q6 months following
initiation).
If transaminases >1–3× ULN, reduce dose to 4 mg/kg or hold therapy
until they normalize. If transaminases >3–5× ULN, discontinue until they
are <3× ULN, then resume at 4 mg/kg. If increases persistent,
permanently discontinue therapy. If transaminases >5× ULN,
discontinue therapy.

cells/mm3, discontinue therapy.
GOUT MEDICATIONS

• Understanding which medications should be used during flares versus
maintenance periods is the key to treating gout (see Chapter 13, Gout).

• In general, drugs used for acute flares possess antiinflammatory activity, while
maintenance drugs work on reducing uric acid levels either by reducing uric
acid synthesis (xanthine oxidase inhibitors) or increasing uric acid excretion
(uricosuric agents).

• Medications
Glucocorticoids (see Glucocorticoids above)
NSAIDs/COX-II inhibitors (see NSAIDs/COX-II inhibitors above)
Avoid use of aspirin due to the paradoxical effect of salicylates on serum
urate (uric acid retention at low doses and uricosuria at high doses).
Colchicine
Dosage: Flare treatment—start with 1.2 mg PO, followed by 0.6 mg PO 1
hour later. Then 0.6 mg PO bid for the next one or two days, followed by
152

several days of 0.6 mg PO qday. Prophylaxis—0.6 mg PO qday or bid.
Mechanism: Colchicine inhibits β-tubulin polymerization into
microtubules, preventing activation, degranulation, and migration of
neutrophils. It may also interfere with assembly of the inflammasome.
Side effects: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
pharyngolaryngeal pain, hepatotoxicity, bone marrow suppression,
myotoxicity (including rhabdomyolysis) may occur, and are generally
dose-related.
Contraindications/precautions: Avoid use when concurrently
administered with strong CYO3A4 inhibitors or P-glycoprotein in
presence of hepatic or renal impairment. Use caution with renal and liver
impairment, bone marrow dysfunction, use of protease inhibitors,
cyclosporine, diltiazem, verapamil, fibrates, and statins.
Anakinra (off-label use; see also under Biologics: IL-1 blockade above)
Dosage: 100 mg SC qday for 3 days.
Allopurinol
Dosage: The range is 200 to 800 mg PO qday, and dose is adjusted to
maintain serum uric acid <6 mg/dL. Doses >300 mg should be divided
into two doses. Do not begin therapy during acute gouty flares. If a
flare occurs in a patient already taking allopurinol, continue
allopurinol.
Mechanism: It inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing uric acid
production.
Side effects: Rash may occur, and may be associated with life-threatening
complications
of toxic epidermal necrolysis and allopurinol
hypersensitivity syndrome (AHS) which presents as rash, fever,
hepatitis, eosinophilia, and acute renal failure. Gout flare, diarrhea,
nausea, hepatotoxicity, rare bone marrow suppression may also occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Use with caution with renal and liver
impairment, bone marrow dysfunction, use of angiotensin converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or diuretics (due to increased risk of
hypersensitivity), amoxicillin or ampicillin (due to rash risk), or
azathioprine or mercaptopurine.
Febuxostat
Dosage: The range is 40 to 80 mg PO qday. Do not begin therapy during
153

acute gouty flares. If a flare occurs in a patient already taking
febuxostat, continue febuxostat.
Mechanism: It inhibits xanthine oxidase, thereby reducing uric acid
production. Unlike allopurinol, it is not a purine base analogue.
Side effects: Hepatotoxicity, nausea, arthralgia, gout flare, and rash may
occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Use with caution with severe renal and
liver impairment, cardiovascular disease, or azathioprine or
mercaptopurine.
Monitoring: Obtain CMP at baseline, 2 and 4 months after initiation.
Probenecid
Dosage: Start at 250 mg PO bid for 1 week, then either 250 to 500 mg/day
or 500 mg/month up to a maximum dose of 2 to 3 grams/day. Do not begin
therapy during acute gouty flares. If a flare occurs in a patient already
taking probenecid, continue probenecid.
Mechanism: This is a uricosuric drug, which competitively inhibits
reabsorption of uric acid at the proximal convoluted tubule.
Side effects: Rash, gout flare, GI intolerance, and uric acid stone
formation may occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Use with caution with renal impairment,
peptic ulcer disease, and concurrent use of penicillins and salicylates.
OSTEOPOROSIS MEDICATIONS

• Virtually all patients with rheumatic diseases are at risk for osteoporosis,
especially those on long-term glucocorticoid therapy.

• Treatment options include calcium and vitamin D supplementation,
bisphosphonates, calcitonin, hormone replacement therapy, parathyroid
hormone (PTH) supplementation, and receptor activator of nuclear factor
kappa-B ligand (RANKL) inhibition (see Chapter 48, Osteoporosis).

• Vitamin supplementation
Calcium carbonate
Dosage: 1000 to 1200 mg PO qday (elemental calcium). This should be
taken with food to improve absorption.
154

Mechanism: Supplementation of nutritional element.
Side effects: Abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation,
flatulence, hypophosphatemia, hypercalcemia, milk–alkali syndrome, renal
failure may occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Avoid use in hypoparathyroid patients
and those with a history of calcium-containing renal stones.
Special considerations: For those on a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or an
H2 blocker for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), use of calcium
citrate is recommended.
Vitamin D (D3 = cholecalciferol, D2 = ergocalciferol)
Dosage: Cholecalciferol: 800 to 1000 IU/day. Ergocalciferol: 800 to 1000
IU po qday, unless 25(OH) vitamin D levels are low, where doses range
from 50,000 IU qweek to qmonth.
Mechanism: Supplementation.
Side effects: Hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, and nephrolithiasis may
occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Use with caution in those with
hypercalcemia, sarcoid or malabsorption syndrome.
Special considerations: Some data suggests that cholecalciferol increases
25(OH) vitamin D levels more effectively than ergocalciferol. Calcitriol
(1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol) also increases 25(OH) vitamin D levels
but frequently causes hypercalcemia and/or hypercalciuria, and its use is
not recommended.
In November of 2010, the Institute of Medicine has recommended lower daily
dietary intake of both calcium (800–1000 mg/day) and vitamin D (400
IU/day). The impact of this on patients with rheumatic diseases is unclear,
and updated recommendations for this patient population are pending.

• Bisphosphonates
General principles
Mechanism: These drugs inhibit bone resorption by their actions on
osteoclasts and osteoclast precursors.
All bisphosphonates should be given on an empty stomach, since
absorption of drug is <1% of dose. Patients are advised to remain upright
for 30 minutes to minimize risk of reflux.

155

Caution is advised with patients experiencing upper GI disease or
esophagitis, and chronic kidney disease. If creatinine clearance <30 to 35
mL/minute, avoid use.
All patients should limit treatment to 3 to 5 years maximum to reduce risk
of atypical fractures of the femur.
Oral formulations
Class side effects: Hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, headache,
GERD, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea/constipation, myalgias, and
arthralgias.
Contraindications/precautions: Avoid use in those with stage 3 or
greater chronic kidney disease, hypocalcemia, esophageal
abnormalities which would delay esophageal emptying, and those who
cannot remain upright for at least 30 minutes after administration. Use
caution in those who experience musculoskeletal pain, GI irritation, or
have had recent oral surgery (risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw).
Alendronate
– Dosage: 10 mg PO qday or 70 mg PO qweek. For prophylaxis, 5 mg
PO qday or 35 mg PO qweek.
Risedronate
– Dosage: 5 mg PO qday, 35 mg PO qweek, or 150 mg PO qmonth.
Ibandronate
– Dosage: 2.5 mg PO qday or 150 mg PO qmonth. Also IV formulation
(see below).
IV formulations
Class side effects: A self-limited flu-like reaction lasting 3 to 4 days is
common after infusion. Bone pain, edema, hypertension, fatigue, fever,
headache, hypocalcemia, renal failure, dyspnea, GERD, abdominal
pain, diarrhea/constipation, nausea, myalgias, and arthralgias may
occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Avoid use in those with stage 3 or
greater chronic kidney disease or hypocalcemia. Use caution in those
who experience musculoskeletal pain, GI irritation, and recent oral
surgery (risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw). Patients with aspirinsensitive asthma may develop bronchospasm from taking zoledronic
acid.
156

Ibandronate
– Dosage: 3 mg IV q3 months.
Zoledronic acid
– Dosage: 5 mg IV qyear.

• Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)
Raloxifene
Dosage: 60 mg PO qday.
Mechanism: It binds to estrogen receptors, exhibiting both agonist and
antagonist properties, inhibiting bone resorption. It also reduces total and
LDL cholesterol (but not the risk of CAD), and reduces risk of breast
cancer.
Side effects: Hot flushes, flu-like syndrome, infections, leg cramps,
arthralgias, edema, venous thromboembolic disease, and fatal stroke may
occur.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for stroke risk
and thromboembolic disease. Use with caution in those who have renal or
liver impairment, hypertriglyceridemia, concurrent estrogen therapy, and
unexplained uterine bleeding.

• Estrogen hormone therapy
Estrogen–progestin
Dosage: 0.35 to 0.45 mg conjugated estrogen with 1.5 mg
medroxyprogesterone PO qday.
Mechanism: It inhibits bone resorption through poorly understood
mechanisms.
Side effects: Data from Women’s Health Initiative demonstrated
increased risk of breast cancer, stroke, venous thromboembolism, biliary
tract disease, shorter survival if prior diagnosis of non-small cell lung
carcinoma, and perhaps coronary artery disease. Headache, generalized
pain, and GI upset also occur.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for risk of
invasive breast cancer, dementia, endometrial carcinoma, and
cardiovascular disease. Use with caution in those who have unexplained
vaginal bleeding, biliary disease, and SLE. Because of these concerns,
estrogen–progestin is no longer first line therapy.
157

• Parathyroid hormone therapy
Teriparatide
Dosage: 20 mcg SC qday.
Mechanism: This is an “anabolic” agent, which stimulates bone growth
and activates bone remodeling. It stimulates preosteoblasts to mature into
osteoblasts.
Side effects: Hypercalcemia, hypercalcuria, hypotension, tachycardia,
muscle cramps, hyperuricemia may occur, and there is a theoretical risk of
osteosarcoma.
Contraindications/precautions: There is a boxed warning for
osteosarcoma risk. Use with caution in those who have renal or liver
impairment, coronary artery disease, and urolithiasis. Limit use to 2 years.

• RANKL therapy
Denosumab
Dosage: 60 mg SC q6 months.
Mechanism: This is a humanized mAb to RANK which reduces
osteoclastogenesis, leading to decreased bone resorption.
Side
effects:
Musculoskeletal
pain,
dermatitis,
eczema,
hypercholesterolemia, cystitis, infections, and hypocalcemia may occur.
Contraindications/precautions: Do not use in hypocalcemic patients. Use
with caution in those with renal impairment.

• Other therapies
Calcitonin
Dosage: 200 IU intranasally (one nostril) qday, or 100 IU SC qother day.
Mechanism: It binds to osteoclasts and inhibits bone resorption.
Side effects: Rhinitis, flushing, nausea, and musculoskeletal pain are
fairly common. Nasal mucosal erosion may develop with intranasal
administration, particularly in those >65 years old.
Contraindications/precautions: Temporarily discontinue if nasal ulcers
develops.

Rheumatoid Arthritis
Richa Gupta and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is inflammatory symmetric polyarthritis which
untreated can lead to erosions, joint space loss, and destruction of the affected
joints.

• RA causes significant morbidity and increased mortality.
• On rare occasions, RA is self-limited but more often is chronic, disabling, and
sometimes associated with systemic manifestations.
Epidemiology

• RA affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide.
• RA increases in incidence with age. Women are affected approximately three
times more often than men. However, after the age of 60, RA affects both
genders equally.

• Genetic studies have demonstrated that certain shared epitopes, a group of
related epitopes in the DR4 and DR1 alleles of the class II major
histocompatibility (MHC) region, increase susceptibility to RA.
Pathophysiology

• Although the etiology of RA is still unknown, there have been major strides in
understanding how the inflammatory process leads to joint destruction.

• Evidence supports initial T-cell activation triggered by an unknown antigen,
leading to joint inflammation and destruction.

• RA is characterized by synovial inflammation with hyperplasia and increased
vascularity (pannus formation). The synovium shows leukocytic infiltration,
160

increased expression of adhesion molecules, proteolytic enzymes and
cytokines including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a, and interleukins (IL)-1, 6,
and 17. These cytokines provide potential targets for blockade and therapy.

• B lymphocytes act as antigen-presenting cells in the synovium. They also
produce antibodies, and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. B-cell depletion
therapy has been shown to be beneficial in patients with RA.

• The synovial membrane enlarges to become the pannus and begins to invade the
cartilage and bone. Finally, proliferation of the pannus leads to more profound
cartilage destruction, subchondral bone erosions, and periarticular ligament
laxity. Cytokine-stimulated osteoclast activity also contributes to erosions and
periarticular osteoporosis found in RA.

• Various citrullinated proteins are present in the rheumatoid joint, including
fibrinogen, collagen, and fibronectin, and have recently been implicated in the
pathophysiology of RA. The process of citrullination involves conversion of
arginine to citrulline by the enzyme peptidylarginine deiminases (PADIs). Of
the four isoforms, PADI 2 and PADI 4 are most abundant in the inflamed
synovium. In RA, increased citrullination occurs in the inflamed synovium, and
antibodies directed against these citrullinated proteins (anti-cyclic
citrullinated peptide [anti-CCP] antibodies) are produced by resident B
cells.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• The presentation and course of RA is variable. Typically, patients present with
an insidious onset of symmetric joint pain, swelling, and morning stiffness
worsening over several weeks. Less common presentations include acute,
rapidly progressive polyarthritis and, more rarely, monoarthritis.

• RA commonly involves the small joints of the hands (wrists,
metacarpophalangeal [MCP] joints, and proximal interphalangeal [PIP] joints)
and feet (metatarsophalangeal [MTP] joints) (Fig. 10-1). Large joints can also
be involved and include the shoulder, knee, ankle, elbow, and hip.

• The severity and duration of morning stiffness often correlate with the overall
disease activity.
161

• Generalized malaise and fatigue can often accompany active inflammation.
• Through the course of RA, patients often experience a waxing and waning
pattern of synovitis coupled with progressive structural damage, leading to
significant deformities and disabilities with advanced disease. Extensive joint
damage can lead to functional limitations in joints as well as neurologic
compromise, leading to symptoms of muscle weakness and atrophy.

• Most of the articular destruction occurs in the early years of disease. Hence, it
is important to diagnose and treat RA early.
Physical Examination

• Physical findings in RA involve the identification of symmetric joint
inflammation early in the course of the disease, and manifestations of joint
destruction with chronic disease.

• Active synovitis is characterized by warmth, swelling, pain, and palpable
effusions. Synovial proliferation is appreciated on physical examination by
the presence of soft or rubbery tissue around the joint margins. Joint warmth
is frequently appreciated, although redness is uncommon.

• Range of motion can be restricted in joints with significant effusions,
including deeper joints that may not demonstrate other signs of inflammation.
Chronic joint destruction with significant degree of cartilage loss produces
crepitus on palpation. Specific joint manifestations follow:
The wrists are involved in most patients and, over time, can lead to radialulnar subluxation and subluxation of carpal bones with radial deviation.
Synovitis at the wrist can lead to median nerve entrapment, resulting in
carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) or, more rarely, ulnar nerve entrapment,
resulting in Guyon’s canal syndrome.
In the hands, the MCPs are commonly involved and, with extensive damage,
may lead to ulnar deviation of the hand. The PIP joints are often involved
with sparing of distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints. Chronic inflammation
with destruction of surrounding tendons can lead to Z-shaped thumb
(hyperextension of first interphalangeal joint with palmar subluxation of first
MCP), swan-neck (hyperextension at PIP, flexion at DIP), and boutonniere
(flexion at PIP, hyperextension of DIP) deformities. Tenosynovitis of finger
tendon sheaths can lead to nodule formation with subsequent catching or
tendon rupture.
162

FIGURE 10-1. Distribution of rheumatoid arthritis.

Elbow involvement is evident by fullness at the radial-humeral joint with the
tendency of patients to maintain the joint in flexion. Over time, this can lead
to flexion contractures. In addition, inflammation can lead to compressive
neuropathy of the ulnar nerve with paresthesias and weakness in the ulnar
distribution.
Involvement of the shoulder usually manifests as loss of range of motion,
with decreased abduction and limited rotation. Effusions are difficult to
appreciate, because the shoulder joint lies underneath the rotator cuff. Pain in
the shoulder can lead to limited range of motion, and adhesive capsulitis, or
frozen shoulder, can develop rapidly.
Cervical spine involvement with RA is common. Inflammation with
involvement of the odontoid process, lateral masses, or tenosynovitis of the
transverse ligament can lead to C1–C2 cervical instability. This may
manifest with neck stiffness with decreased range of motion. Compression of
cord, nerve roots, or vertebral arteries can occur, leading to neurologic
compromise, and may require emergent stabilization. RA involvement of the
163

thoracic and the lumbar spine is rare.
Hip involvement with RA is also common, but symptoms are often delayed.
When present, examination findings include decreased range of motion and
pain radiating to the groin, thigh, buttock, low back, or knee.
Involvement of the knee includes detectable effusions and synovial
thickening. Prolonged inflammation can lead to significant instability.
Posterior herniation of the synovial capsule can result in a popliteal
(Baker’s) cyst, and rupture can mimic thrombophlebitis.
Because of weight-bearing, RA involvement of the foot and ankle is often
symptomatic. The joints most commonly affected include the MTP,
talonavicular, and ankle joints. MTP joints can develop cocking-up
deformities with subluxation of the MTP fat pads, causing pain with
ambulation. Inflammation of the talonavicular joint and ankle joints results in
eversion of the foot and can cause nerve entrapment, resulting in paresthesias
of the sole.
With the discovery of more effective treatments, extra-articular
manifestations of RA occur much less commonly than they did in previous
decades. However, severe RA can manifest with sequelae of systemic
inflammation, especially in rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive patients.
Common extra-articular manifestations follow:
Skin manifestations include formation of subcutaneous rheumatoid
nodules and vasculitic skin ulcerations. Rheumatoid nodules typically
form during active inflammation over pressure points in bursae and tendon
sheaths. Common sites include the olecranon bursa, the extensor surface of
the forearm, the Achilles tendon, and the tendons of the fingers.
Ocular involvement usually involves sicca symptoms of dry eyes (and dry
mouth in Sjögren’s syndrome) but can include episcleritis or a more
concerning scleritis and scleromalacia perforans.
Pulmonary involvement of RA may include interstitial fibrosis, pulmonary
nodules, pleuritis, or bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia.
Interstitial fibrosis generally involves the lower lung fields and is often
not clinically symptomatic, but it may be severely debilitating in some
cases.
Neurologic manifestations of RA are usually related to nerve entrapment
or cervical spine instability. Vasculitis of vasa vasorum can lead to
symptoms of mononeuritis multiplex.
164

Cardiac involvement may include pericardial effusions, pericarditis,
valvular lesions, conduction defects, or cardiomyopathy
Gastrointestinal (GI) and renal manifestations of RA are rare.
Amyloidosis can sometimes occur, affecting these organs.
Hepatic involvement may include nodular regenerative hyperplasia or
portal fibrosis.
Hematologic effects of RA include hypochromic-microcytic anemia,
Felty’s syndrome (the triad of leukopenia, lymphadenopathy, and
splenomegaly), cryoglobulinemia, and the large granular lymphocyte
syndrome.
TABLE 10-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY CRITERIA
FOR THE DIAGNOSIS OF RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

Diagnostic Criteria

• The diagnosis of RA involves the accumulation of clinical, lab, and radiologic
features that develop over the course of the disease. Early RA is often difficult
to diagnose definitively, yet it can usually be confirmed as the disease
progresses. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has provided
criteria for the diagnosis of RA (Table 10-1).1
These criteria were designed for inclusion and monitoring of patients in
clinical studies and not for routine clinical diagnosis. However, they can
serve as diagnostic guidelines for evaluation of patients with suspected RA.
They have 91% to 94% sensitivity and 89% specificity for established RA;
165

the sensitivity of these criteria to diagnose early RA decreases to 40% to
60% with a specificity of 80% to 90%.
In practice, a patient with symmetric, inflammatory polyarthritis of the small
joints of the hands with positive serologies (RF and anti-CCP antibody
described below) most likely has RA.

• The ACR has created a new revised classification criteria for RA, in
collaboration with the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).2
This new classification system redefines the preexisting criteria for diagnosis
of RA by focusing on features at earlier stages of disease that are associated
with persistent and/or erosive disease, rather than defining the disease by its
late-stage features.
This will focus attention on the important need for early diagnosis and
treatment to prevent or minimize the occurrence of undesirable
sequelae (Table 10-2).2
Differential Diagnosis

• The other common causes of symmetric inflammatory polyarthritis are
systemic connective tissue disorders such as SLE, psoriatic arthritis, and viral
(parvovirus B19 and hepatitis B and C associated) arthritis.

• Other causes of inflammatory arthritis that are less symmetric and typically
oligo- or monoarticular include gout, pseudogout, septic arthritis, HLA-B27
associated spondyloarthropathies, and adult-onset Still’s disease.

• Conditions with noninflammatory polyarthralgias should not be confused
with RA, such as fibromyalgia, osteoarthritis, malignancy, hypo- or
hyperthyroidism, or hyperparathyroidism.
TABLE 10-2 THE 2010 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF
RHEUMATOLOGY/EUROPEAN LEAGUE AGAINST RHEUMATISM
CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS

166

• Palindromic rheumatism is a condition similar to RA in which patients
develop recurrent onset of acute, self-limited arthritis.
167

Attacks usually last hours to a few days and may involve any set of joints.
Laboratory tests are nonspecific, and synovial fluid analysis reveals an
inflammatory reaction.
Joint damage and systemic manifestations are rare.
Diagnosis is based on the presence of a relapsing and remitting course of
arthritis.
Many patients with palindromic rheumatism later progress to develop
RA.
Treatment is similar to that for RA. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) may provide pain relief. Corticosteroids and some diseasemodifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may also be beneficial.

• Relapsing seronegative symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE)
is a condition usually characterized by the sudden onset of polyarthritis
associated with pitting edema of the hands and/or feet.
Laboratory markers of inflammation are variable, and RF is absent.
Synovitis is commonly present but rarely leads to joint destruction.
Treatment involves the use of low-dose corticosteroids (prednisone, 5–
10 mg), typically with dramatic improvement of symptoms. NSAIDs and
hydroxychloroquine may also provide symptomatic relief and may be useful
as steroid-sparing agents.
RS3PE may be related to polymyalgia rheumatica and sometimes occur in
association with malignancies.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Laboratory evaluation should include a baseline complete blood count (CBC),
electrolyte panel, creatinine, hepatic function panel (HFP), urinalysis (UA),
and stool occult blood to assess general organ function and comorbidities
before initiating medications.

• Serologic markers for RA, including RF and anti-CCP antibodies, should be
tested. Anti-CCP antibodies have been found in the serum of affected patient’s
years before the onset of clinically apparent disease, and are more specific for
RA than RF.3

• RF should be drawn at baseline and repeated 6 to 12 months later if initially
168

negative, as approximately 50% of RA patients are positive in the first 6
months of illness and 85% become positive over the first 2 years. Once RF
is positive and the diagnosis of RA is made there is no need to repeat this test.

• A low-titer RF can be associated with other chronic inflammatory
conditions such as bacterial endocarditis, hepatitis C with cryoglobulinemia,
and primary biliary cirrhosis. A high-titer RF usually indicates RA.

• The sensitivity and specificity of RF for the diagnosis of RA are roughly 66%
and 82%, respectively

• The sensitivity of anti-CCP antibodies for the diagnosis of RA is 70% but
specificity is 95%, superior to RF.

• Up to 35% of patients with a negative RF at presentation will test positive
for anti-CCP antibody.

• A small number of RA patients (10%–15%) will remain seronegative (RF and
CCP antibody negative) throughout the course of the disease.

• 20% to 30% of RA patients have a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA), but
this is at a low titer. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) are markers of inflammation and may be useful to monitor
disease activity, although they are not specific for RA.

• The synovial fluid in RA patients is inflammatory. Arthrocentesis is useful to
rule out infectious and crystalline arthritis, if these are suspected, particularly
if one joint is inflamed out of proportion to the others.
Imaging

• Radiographs of involved joints may be uninformative early in disease but can
be used to monitor disease progression and treatment responses.

• MRI and ultrasound have been proven to be more sensitive methods for
detecting early joint erosions; synovitis and tenosynovitis (refer to Chapter 6,
Radiographic Imaging of Rheumatic Diseases).

• Of note, plain radiographs of feet are more likely to show erosions with early
RA than hands.
TREATMENT

• The goals of treatment of RA are to alleviate pain, control inflammation,
169

preserve and improve activities of daily living, and prevent progressive joint
destruction.

• Early recognition of disease and pharmacologic treatment provide the
cornerstones for management of RA and hence early referral to a
rheumatologist is imperative.

• Medical treatment includes the use of NSAIDs, DMARDs, and corticosteroids.
• Equally important in the management of RA is non-pharmacologic treatment,
including patient education, physical therapy, occupational therapy, orthotics,
and surgery.
Medications
Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs

• The use of NSAIDs in high doses can help alleviate symptoms from pain and
inflammation in most patients with RA.

• Patients should be closely monitored for toxicities, especially GI ulcerations
and renal dysfunction.

• Some patients may benefit from selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors
that have documented reduced GI toxicities or addition of GI prophylaxis in the
form of misoprostol or proton pump inhibitors.

• NSAIDs do not prevent progression of bone and cartilage damage;
therefore, current treatment strategies recommend NSAID use in combination
with DMARDs for initial therapy.

• For details on dosing, toxicities, and monitoring of specific agents see Chapter
9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.
Glucocorticoids

• Corticosteroids in low doses (e.g., prednisone, 5–10 mg) are extremely
effective for promptly reducing the symptoms of RA and are useful in helping
patients recover their previous functional status.

• Unfortunately, short courses of oral corticosteroids produce only interim
benefit, and chronic therapy is often necessary to maintain symptom
management.

• Corticosteroids are appropriate in patients with significant limitations in their
170

activities of daily living, particularly early in the course of disease while
awaiting the efficacy of slow-acting DMARDs.

• Every effort should be made to taper to the lowest possible dose and to
eliminate steroid therapy when feasible.

• Toxicities of corticosteroids are well known and include weight gain,
cushingoid features, osteoporosis (for details on treatment and prevention of
osteoporosis related to corticosteroids, see Chapter 48, Osteoporosis),
avascular necrosis (AVN), infection, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and
increases in serum cholesterol levels. Keeping the daily dose of prednisone at
≤5 mg can often reduce toxicities.

• Corticosteroid doses should be slowly tapered over several months to avoid
adrenal insufficiency.
Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs

• DMARDs can slow or arrest the progression of RA. DMARDs should be
instituted early (within the first few weeks to 3 months of diagnosis). Evidence
indicates
that outcomes are improved for patients treated more
aggressively at presentation. Therefore, initiation of therapy with NSAIDs
and DMARDs simultaneously is recommended.

• Many of the DMARDs have significant potential toxicities and may take
several months to attain optimal clinical benefit; therefore, careful
monitoring for side effects and symptom relief is required.

• For severe disease flares, the use of oral corticosteroids may also be necessary
while waiting for optimal benefit from DMARDs.

• The choice of an initial DMARD is based on disease severity, and the presence
of erosive disease and anti-CCP antibodies; the latter are typically associated
with a more aggressive disease course. Following is a list of commonly used
DMARDs with associated toxicities and monitoring recommendations.

• For details on dosing, toxicities, and monitoring of specific agents see Chapter
9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.
Oral methotrexate is considered to be the DMARD of choice for most
patients, and is imperative in patients with rapid disease progression or
functional limitations.
From a starting dose of 7.5 to 10 mg once a week, the dose may be
increased to 20 mg weekly rapidly.
171

If methotrexate is at least partially effective, it is continued as background
therapy while other agents are added.
Common side effects include stomatitis, nausea, diarrhea, and hair loss.
Supplementation with folic acid, 1 to 2 mg daily, can reduce such side
effects without significantly reducing efficacy.
Bone marrow suppression is uncommon, but it may occur at low doses in
elderly patients.
The risk of liver toxicity is increased by alcohol consumption, preexisting
liver disease, and possibly by diabetes and obesity.
Important contraindications to methotrexate therapy include liver disease,
abnormal liver function tests, and regular alcohol consumption.
Liver function tests and blood counts are checked every month until the
dose is stable and every 2 to 3 months thereafter.
A liver biopsy is performed in patients with persistent elevation of liver
transaminases or decrease in serum albumin to rule out methotrexateinduced hepatotoxicity.
Methotrexate is to be avoided in patients with serum creatinine of greater
than 2.0 mg/dL; as such patients are at higher risk of toxicity because of
impaired renal clearance of the drug. Women of childbearing age must use
appropriate contraceptive measures because of the teratogenic effects of
this drug.
Hydroxychloroquine is effective in mild to moderate, nonerosive RA, at
doses of 200 to 400 mg/day, but not to be used in patients with moderate to
severe renal or hepatic insufficiency.
Macular toxicity is extremely unusual if the dose does not exceed 6 to
7 mg/kg/day, and it rarely occurs before 6 years of treatment.
Nonetheless, an ophthalmologist should perform a baseline examination
and monitor the patient every 6 to 12 months.
Nausea and skin discoloration occur occasionally.
Sulfasalazine should be started at 500 mg twice daily and gradually
increased to 2 to 3 g daily in divided doses.
An enteric-coated preparation improves GI tolerability.
Monitoring for neutropenia and hepatotoxicity should be performed every
1 to 3 months.
GI intolerance due to nausea or abdominal pain may occur.
172

Sulfasalazine should be avoided in patients with sulfa allergies or glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
Leflunomide is a pyrimidine synthesis inhibitor with efficacy comparable to
methotrexate in treatment of RA.
Diarrhea, nausea, and hair loss are common side effects. Liver functions
need to be monitored every 1 to 3 months.
The effective starting dose is 20 mg/day which can be reduced to 10
mg/day if the medication is not tolerated or if transaminase levels become
elevated.
Cyclosporine is an inhibitor of T-cell activation with known clinical efficacy
in treatment of RA.
Efficacy is increased when used in combination with methotrexate.
Cost and potential for severe renal toxicity, even in low doses, have
limited its use to the treatment of severe, refractory RA.
Blood pressure and renal function should be monitored closely.

• Other DMARDs less commonly used to treat RA include gold salts,
azathioprine,
vasculitis).

penicillamine,

and

cyclophosphamide

(for

rheumatoid

Biologics

• Biologic therapy should be initiated when adequate disease control is not
achieved with the oral DMARDs.

• These include TNF-αantagonists and other non–TNF-αmediated biologic
agents.

• TNF-αantagonists are the initial biologic therapies used in RA patients who
fail oral DMARDs. They are often administered in conjunction with
methotrexate therapy, as there is more effective disease control with
combination therapy.4

• Serious infections have occurred rarely.
Hence, TNF-α antagonists are contraindicated in patients with indolent
chronic infections such as osteomyelitis or tuberculosis (TB), and in anyone
with an active infection.
Screening for latent TB should be performed with a tuberculin skin test
before beginning therapy with a TNF antagonist, and patients who test
173

positive for latent TB should be treated with isoniazid before beginning
therapy. Also, annual skin testing for latent TB is now recommended during
treatment with a TNF-α antagonist.
Treatment with TNF-α antagonist should be temporarily suspended in patients
undergoing surgery.

• TNF-αantagonists should be used with extreme caution in patients with
congestive heart failure or significant coronary artery disease.

• Rare side effects include demyelinating disorders and lupus-like syndromes,
with positive antibodies such as ANA, with or without other features of SLE.

• There is no consensus at the present time regarding the risk of lymphoma and
malignancy with use of these drugs, but if their use is warranted in patients
with these conditions, these patients need to be monitored closely.

• Many patients who do not respond to one TNF-αantagonist may respond to
a different agent in the same class.

• Choices for patients with an inadequate response to three or more TNF- α
antagonists include abatacept, a T-cell costimulation inhibitor, rituximab, an
anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, and tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody to
the IL-6 receptor.

• For details on dosing, toxicities, and monitoring of specific agents see Chapter
9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases.

• The five currently available TNF-α antagonists are etanercept, infliximab,
adalimumab, golimumab, and certolizumab. Non–TNF antagonizing biologics
include anakinra, rituximab, abatacept, and tocilizumab.
Etanercept is a recombinant DNA-derived protein composed of TNF
receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. Etanercept binds TNF and
blocks its interaction with cell surface receptors.
Infliximab is a chimeric human/murine monoclonal antibody to TNF.
Adalimumab and golimumab are fully human monoclonal antibodies to TNF.
Certolizumab pegol is made of Fab antigen-binding domain of a humanized
anti-TNF antibody, which is pegylated allowing for delayed elimination and
an extended half-life.
Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist.
Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody directed against the CD20 antigen on B
lymphocytes.
174

Abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator which inhibits Tlymphocyte activation by blocking the interaction between antigen-presenting
cells and T cells.
Tocilizumab is an antagonist of IL-6.

• Combination regimens of multiple DMARDs or DMARDs plus biologic agents
are increasingly popular treatment regimens. If tolerated, methotrexate should
be part of every combination.
Other Non-pharmacologic Therapies

• Ancillary medical services can augment treatment strategies for patients with
RA at any stage of disease.

• Occupational therapy usually focuses on the hand and wrist and can help
patients with splinting, work simplification, activities of daily living, and
assistive devices.

• Physical therapy assists in stretching and strengthening exercises for large
joints such as the shoulder and knee, gait evaluation, and fitting with crutches
and canes. Moderate exercise is appropriate for all patients and can help
reduce stiffness and maintain joint range of motion. In general, an exercise
program should not produce pain for >2 hours after its completion.
Surgical Management

• Orthopedic surgery to correct hand deformities and replace large joints such
as the hip, knee, and shoulder may benefit patients with advanced disease.

• The primary indication for reconstructive hand surgery is refractory functional
impairment limiting activities of daily living.

• Total joint arthroplasty to replace the knee or hip should also be considered
when pain cannot be controlled adequately with medications or when joint
instability causes significant fall risk.
COMPLICATIONS

• RA patients are susceptible to infections due to the immunosuppressive
medications used for treatment.

175

• RA patients are at increased risk for lymphoproliferative disorders,
particularly lymphomas.

• Cervical instability at the atlantoaxial articulation is a complication of longstanding, severe RA. Evaluation for cervical instability is particularly
important in the perioperative setting, when extension of the neck for intubation
may lead to cord compromise with resultant neurologic impairment.
Radiographs of the cervical spine, including lateral flexion and extension
views, should be taken.

• Rheumatoid vasculitis is usually associated with long-standing, severe, erosive
RA. Mononeuritis multiplex and skin ulcers are common manifestations of
rheumatoid vasculitis.

• There is emerging data on the inflammatory state in RA being an independent
risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
FOLLOW-UP

• The course of RA differs between patients. Whereas some patients may
experience mild disease and have spontaneous remission, others may suffer a
chronic course with intermittent disease flares and progressive joint
destruction.

• Patients should be monitored on a frequent basis for disease progression or
remission, response to therapy, and drug toxicities.

• Drug therapies should be adjusted to attain the minimal effective doses with an
emphasis on limiting use of chronic steroids.

• Mortality rates are increased in RA patients due to cardiovascular disease,
other comorbidities include infections, pulmonary and renal disease, and
GI bleeding and drug toxicities.
PROGNOSIS

• The presence of erosions at baseline, and high titers of RF and anti-CCP
antibodies predict radiographic progression in RA.

• Female sex, smoking, extra-articular disease, functional limitations, a large
number of tender and swollen joints, elevated ESR or CRP, HLADRB1*0401/*0404 positivity are other poor prognostic factors.

Osteoarthritis
Hyon Ju Park and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Osteoarthritis (OA) has evolved from being considered a natural part of the aging
process and noninflammatory to now being known as the result of a complex process
involving genetic susceptibilities, mechanical forces, and variable inflammation of
the synovium, leading to degradation of the articular cartilage.
Classification

• Primary or idiopathic: The localized form affects one to two joint groups:
distal interphalangeal (DIP), proximal interphalangeal (PIP), or
carpometacarpal (CMC) joints of hands; cervical or lumbar spine; first
metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints of feet; knees; and hips (Fig. 11-1). The
generalized form involves three or more joint groups and is frequently
associated with Heberden’s nodes (bony enlargements of the DIP joints) or
Bouchard’s nodes (bony enlargements of the PIP joints).

• Secondary: This should be considered if a patient develops OA in atypical
joints, such as metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, wrists, ankles, shoulders, or
elbows. Assessment should be made for previous trauma, metabolic disease,
blood dyscrasias, or neuropathic joints.

• Erosive OA: Also known as inflammatory OA, it affects the DIP and PIP joints
of the hand, with negative rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated
protein (CCP) antibodies.
Epidemiology

• OA is the most common articular disease, affecting more than 20 million
people in US alone.

• The prevalence of OA increases with age so that, in men and women aged >60
178

years, the prevalence is 17% and 29.6%, respectively.
Etiology
Cause is unknown although obesity, heredity, biomechanical injuries or overuse, and
age are risk factors.
Pathophysiology

• Chondrocytes are responsible for balancing the anabolic and catabolic
processes in the joint.

•

Biomechanical stressors cause chondrocytes to trigger matrix
metalloproteinases and synthesis of matrix proteins including fibrillar type II
collagen.
FIGURE 11-1. Distribution of osteoarthritis.

• The triggering of various metalloproteinases lead to cartilage degradation.
179

Synthesis of matrix proteins leads to new bone growth resulting in osteophyte
(bony projections at edges of joints) formation.

• Over years, this process of cartilage degradation and osteophyte formation
results in the bone-on-bone grinding sensation, and sometimes even instability
of the joint with use.
Risk Factors

• Risk factors for primary OA:
Age: The prevalence of OA greatly increases with age.
Gender: Women suffer from OA more often than men.
Obesity: Increased risk in weightbearing joints like knees and hips, as well
as the first CMC.
High bone mass: Women with osteoporosis are less likely to have OA.
Mechanical factors: Joints that have been subjected to repetitive use.
Genetic: Although typically thought to be a disease in people over the age of
50, animal models suggest that mutations in genes encoding for extracellular
matrix proteins could lead to premature OA.

• Risk factors for secondary OA:
Injured or damaged joints: This includes mechanical injuries as well as
joint damage inflicted by inflammatory arthritides such as rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and even septic arthritis.
Metabolic/infiltrative diseases: Acromegaly, Paget’s disease, Cushing’s
syndrome, crystalline arthropathies, ochronosis, hemochromatosis, Wilson’s
disease, and amyloidosis increase the risk of OA.
Hemarthrosis: Whether it be due to trauma, disease states with factor
deficiencies or inhibitors, or anticoagulation, persistent or recurrent blood in
the synovial fluid leads to cartilage destruction.
Neuropathic joints: The pattern of joints involved depends on the underlying
disease state. Diabetic neuropathy tends to involve foot and ankle; tabes
dorsalis involves knees, hips, ankles; and syringomyelia tends to involve
shoulders and elbows.
DIAGNOSIS
180

• Diagnosis is based on history and physical examination.
• If the clinical presentation is confusing, synovial fluid analysis, inflammatory
markers, and radiographs can be used to assist in diagnosis.
Clinical Presentation
Unless there is a strong family history, the patient presents with pain usually after the
age of 50.
History

• Patients complain of pain or “locking” of affected joints that are mechanical in
nature and worsening with activity.

• As the disease progresses, stiffness can become a manifestation but is typically
less than 30 minutes, compared to the stiffness in RA lasting more than
60 minutes. Stiffness can occur after a period of inactivity, called a “gelling”
effect.
Physical Examination

• Examination of the suspected joint may demonstrate mild tenderness to
palpation, usually without evidence of inflammation. Crepitus, bony
enlargement, decreased range of motion, joint effusion, and osteophytes along
the periphery of the joint may be found.

• The joints most commonly involved are DIP, PIP and first CMC joints,
knees, hips, and spine. Secondary OA or another disease process should be
considered if other joints are involved.
Diagnostic Criteria

• Listed below are American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for OA
involving hands, hips, and knees but it is important to remember that these
were created to meet eligibility for clinical trials and should be used more as
guidelines rather than absolute criteria:
Hand: Hand pain or stiffness and at least three of the following: hard tissue
enlargement of more than one of the selected joints (second and third DIP or
PIP; the first CMC joint of each hand), hard tissue enlargement of more than
one DIP joint, deformity of at least one of ten selected joints, and fewer than
181

three swollen MCP joints.
Hip: Hip pain and at least two of the following: erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) <20 mm/hr, radiographic acetabular or femoral osteophytes, and
radiographic joint space narrowing.
Knee: Knee pain plus three of the following: ESR <20 mm/hour, age >50,
stiffness <30 minutes, crepitus, no palpable warmth, bony hypertrophy.
Differential Diagnosis
The following diagnoses must be considered when diagnosing OA: RA;
seronegative spondyloarthropathies such as PsA, reactive arthritis (ReA),
ankylosing spondylitis (AS), and enteropathic arthritis; crystalline arthropathies;
infectious arthritis, including bacterial and viral etiologies; paraneoplastic and
neoplastic synovitis; hemarthroses, periarticular bursitis and tendonitis; and referred
pain from a different joint.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
There are no laboratory tests confirming the diagnosis of OA but if the history is
confusing, inflammatory markers can be obtained (ESR should be <20).
Imaging

• Radiographic evidence of OA is very common and does not necessarily
correlate with symptomatic disease.

• Typical features seen on radiographs include: joint space narrowing,
subchondral sclerosis, osteophytes at the periphery of joints, and
subchondral cysts.
Diagnostic Procedures

• If the patient has an effusion and the clinical picture is confusing, joint
aspiration can be performed.

• Synovial fluid has a few WBCs (<2000 WBCs/mL).
TREATMENT

182

Both the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2007 guidelines and
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) 2008 guidelines recommend
a combination of nonpharmacologic modalities and the use of pharmacologic agents
in a stepwise fashion.
Medications
First Line

• Although the data for using acetaminophen up to 4 g/day is not convincing, it is
the first line therapy of choice based on its safety profile.

• In practice, most patients require 2 to 3 g/day for pain relief.
Second Line

• No one nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) has been proven to be
more effective than another.

• NSAIDs are often more effective than acetaminophen therapy but long term use
has to be balanced with increased cardiovascular, renal, and gastrointestinal
(GI) toxicity.
Third Line
Opioid therapy is clearly superior to acetaminophen in terms of pain relief but
studies show high drop-out rates secondary to constipation, falls, hypersomnolence,
and confusion.
Fourth Line

• Various small trials have demonstrated efficacy of corticosteroid injections in
about 60% of patients.

• Trials with hyaluronic acid injections show similar efficacy.1
• Current recommendation is to repeat injections at a maximum of every three
months.
Topical Therapies

• Although not included in current guidelines, some patients report significant
relief with topicals either alone or in conjunction with any of the above
therapies.
183

• 0.025% capsaicin cream applied four times a day over a 6-week period was
efficacious in decreasing knee OA pain.

• Topical diclofenac solution (1.5% w/w) at 50 drops four times a day had pain
relief equivalent with 150 mg of diclofenac daily but with less GI side effects.

• Randomized controlled studies have not been performed with lidocaine patches
for OA pain but they have been shown to be efficacious for neuropathic pain.
Novel Therapies

• Diacerein is a novel drug with interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitory activity. In animal
models, this drug leads to potent inhibition of metalloproteinases necessary for
cartilage destruction. Several large, randomized controlled trials have been
performed with conflicting results. Diacerein is currently available in many
countries including France and Armenia but is not approved for use in the US
due to significant side effect profile without much benefit.2

• Tanezumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against nerve growth factor
(NGF).3 Elevated levels of NGF are seen in synovial fluid of patients with
inflammatory arthritis and animal models had suggested a benefit in OA.
Dramatic response was seen in phase II trials but phase III trials for knee, hip,
and shoulder OA were closed by the FDA due to some of the patients
developing bone necrosis. Trials for use in metastatic bone disease,
endometriosis, and prostatitis are still ongoing.

• ADAMTS5 is a type II collagen protease thought to be central in cartilage
degradation in OA. Research into its role, regulation, and expression in OA is
ongoing.4
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Physical therapy, aerobic, water-based exercises, weight reduction, walking
aids, knee braces, footwear, insoles, thermal modalities, transcutaneous
electrical nerve stimulation, acupuncture, education, and regular telephone
contact to assess for pain have all been shown to improve the functional status
of patients both in combination with pharmacologic therapies and by
themselves.

• There are no guidelines or data to recommend some of these therapies over
others but recommendations should be based on what is readily available to
the patient.
184

Surgical Management

• Arthroscopic irrigations have failed to demonstrate any benefit in knee and hip
OA.

• Knee and hip arthroplasty or total joint replacements have demonstrated
improvement in function and pain in about 85% of people receiving surgeries.

• Prosthetic joints typically last 15 years.

Systemic Lupus Erythematosus
Alfred H.J. Kim and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic, systemic, inflammatory
disease characterized by autoantibodies (particularly antinuclear antibodies
[ANAs]) and immune complex deposition in multiple target organs.

• Affected organs include skin, musculoskeletal system, nervous system
(including psychiatric), serous membranes, hematologic system, reproductive
system, heart, lungs, kidneys, and gut.

• Symptoms can range from mild to life-threatening.
• Pattern of symptoms experienced within the first several years of illness tends
to predominate throughout the remainder of the disease.

• Mainly affects women of child-bearing age.
• Criteria exist to assist in the diagnosis of SLE, but SLE remains a challenging
disease to diagnose due to the absence of pathognomonic signs, symptoms, or
laboratory findings.
Definition

• The diagnosis of SLE requires the presence of multiorgan disease in the
setting of immune dysfunction, specifically the presence of autoantibodies.

• The American College of Rheumatology has defined diagnostic criteria for SLE
(Table 12-1). While helpful for diagnosis, the main role of these criteria is
defining SLE for clinical studies. They also fail to highlight common
nonspecific manifestations of SLE, such as Raynaud’s phenomenon,
lymphadenopathy, keratoconjunctivitis sicca (secondary Sjögren’s syndrome),
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and hypocomplementemia.
Classification
186

• While SLE is the most prevalent form of lupus, there are subsets of lupus that
are less severe. These are defined either by the presence of only one aspect of
lupus or by a secondary cause.
Discoid lupus
Subacute cutaneous lupus
Drug-induced lupus (DIL)
Epidemiology

• Roughly 20 to 150 cases of SLE per 100,000 patients have been reported.
• Prevalence and severity of the disease depends on gender and ethnicity.
Gender
In children, female-to-male ratio is 3:1. This ratio increases in adults to 7–
15:1.
TABLE 12-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY CRITERIA
FOR DIAGNOSIS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

187

Ethnicity
In females, prevalence ranges from 164 (Caucasian) to 406 (AfricanAmerican) per 100,000.
Higher in Asians, African-Americans, Afro-Caribbeans, and HispanicAmericans compared to Caucasians. Disease is thought to be rare in
Africa.
Etiology

• The etiology of SLE is unknown.
• Multiple factors appear to play a role in disease susceptibility, including
genetic, hormonal, immune, and environmental.
188

Genetic
There is a high concordance of SLE between monozygotic twins (14%–
57%). In addition, relatives of patients with SLE have a 5% to 12%
prevalence rate of SLE.
The genetic factors that confer the highest risk of SLE include the
following:
Deficiencies of the complement component C1q, C4A and B, C2.
Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) mutations (enzyme needed to
degrade DNA).
The most common genetic factors associated with SLE include the
following:
HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3.
Genes involved with high levels or enhanced responsiveness to
interferon-α (such as STAT4, PTPN22, and IRF5).
Genes involved in lymphocyte signaling or clearance of immune
complexes have been also identified, but the significance on disease
prevalence remains unclear.
Hormonal
The significant increase in risk seen in women strongly suggests a role of
sex hormones in SLE; sex hormones are well-established regulators of the
immune system, leading to the hypothesis that they play a role in SLE
pathophysiology. Estrogen-containing contraceptives increase the risk of
developing SLE (relative risk 1.5).
Post-menopausal administration of estrogen and early menarche (age ≤10
years) double the risk of SLE development.
Immune
Numerous abnormalities of the immune system have been observed in SLE
patients, but the significance of these abnormalities remains unclear.
Currently, it is believed that many of these abnormalities are due to the
loss of tolerance to self-antigens.
Environmental
Several environmental factors are associated with triggering disease onset
or worsening disease activity in SLE.
Viruses activate the interferon-α pathway, which is an important antiviral
immune mechanism. This is the same pathway thought to be critical in
189

promoting SLE activity. Recurrent Epstein–Barr virus infections have
been associated with a higher risk of SLE development.
Ultraviolet light exposure commonly triggers cutaneous manifestations of
SLE.
Several drugs are associated with DIL (Laboratories below).
Pathophysiology

• Many of the clinical manifestations of SLE are thought to be due to the
presence of autoantibodies and generation of immune complexes.

• For example, in renal disease, autoantibodies to nuclear antigens either deposit
or form within mesangial, subendothelial, or subepithelial regions of the
glomerulus. These immune complexes activate the complement system, leading
to the inflammation and recruitment of inflammatory cells to the kidney. This
cycle eventually leads to fibrinoid necrosis, scarring, and reduction in kidney
function.
Risk Factors
Female gender, certain ethnicities, geographical location, ultraviolet exposure, and
certain medications (Table 12-2) have been associated with increased SLE
prevalence or severity of disease.

POSSIBLE RISK OF DRUG-INDUCED LUPUS

190

Prevention
Since the etiology of disease remains unknown, no primary preventative measures
are known though patients are routinely advised to avoid sunlight, wear sunscreen,
and wide-brimmed hats to prevent disease flares.
Associated Conditions

• As the prototypical connective tissue disease, SLE can overlap with signs and
symptoms from other connective tissue diseases. For example, SLE can
overlap with rheumatoid arthritis (“rupus”), primary Sjögren’s syndrome,
Raynaud’s disease, systemic sclerosis, or polymyositis/dermatomyositis.

• Mixed connective tissue disease was initially described as a specific illness
consisting of the overlap of SLE, polymyositis, and systemic sclerosis,
associated with a positive ANA and very high titers of antiribonucleoprotein
(anti-RNP) antibody. These patients were thought to have a generally milder
disease than those with these diseases separately. The term is often misused by
non-rheumatologists to mean an undifferentiated rheumatic illness.
191

• Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (particularly diffuse large B cell) is associated with
SLE.

• Many other conditions are associated with SLE. These will be covered in the
Diagnosis section.
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of SLE remains one of the most challenging diagnoses in medicine.
No single sign, symptom, or laboratory value is pathognomonic for SLE.
Clinical Presentation

• SLE presents in a highly variable manner, both in terms of onset and in course.
• Many of the early symptoms are nonspecific (i.e., fatigue, malaise, arthralgias
or arthritis, and fever).

• Severe manifestations (i.e., nephritis) usually occur at the onset or early on the
course of disease.

• Many of the patient’s complaints may be due to SLE, medication side effects,
or unrelated intercurrent illnesses.
General Signs and Symptoms

• Virtually all SLE patients present with fatigue. This may be due to disease
activity but anemia, infections, medications, or fibromyalgia are other causes.

• Weight loss, lymphadenopathy, and fever are also common in SLE. Weight
loss usually precedes that diagnosis. All fevers must be evaluated for infection.
Musculoskeletal Signs and Symptoms

• Arthralgias and arthritis are the most common presenting symptoms in SLE.
Arthralgias may involve any joint, but symmetric involvement of hands,
wrists, and knees is most typically seen.
Arthritis tends to be symmetric, migratory, and nonerosive.
Although deformities are rare, most deformities associated with SLE are
reversible. Both reversible “swan-neck” and “boutonniere” deformities (see
Chapter 2, Rheumatologic Joint Examination) can be seen. Jaccoud’s
192

arthropathy occurs when there is reversible ulnar deviation and subluxation
of the second to fifth metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints.

• Diffuse myalgias are also commonly seen, sometimes in association with
fibromyalgia (see Chapter 36, Fibromyalgia Syndrome). Myositis is
uncommon but muscle inflammation otherwise typical of primary
polymyositis/dermatomyositis may be associated with SLE. Myopathy induced
from steroids or hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) can be seen (see Chapter 9, Drugs
Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases).

• Osteoporosis is common and worsens from steroids used to treat flares (see
Chapter 48, Osteoporosis).
Mucocutaneous Signs and Symptoms

• Approximately 50% of patients have photosensitivity.
Photosensitivity can take the form of skin rash or blistering, but more
commonly, extreme fatigue or malaise occurs. Usually, symptoms occur
within minutes of exposure to ultraviolet rays.

• Malar rash is seen in 50% of SLE patients.
Malar rash (also known as a butterfly rash) is a fixed erythema, either flat or
raised, over the malar eminences, sparing the nasolabial folds.
The differential diagnosis for malar rash includes acne rosacea, seborrheic
dermatitis, polymorphous light eruption, and contact dermatitis.

• Discoid rash starts as erythematous papules or plaques that become infiltrated
and have an adherent scale. Follicular plugging is prominent. The lesions
expand, leaving central hypopigmentation, atrophic scarring, and permanent
alopecia. They commonly occur along the hairline and in the ear canals.
Some lupus patients only have discoid lesions. This type of lupus is called
discoid lupus. Only 10% of these patients will develop SLE.

• Oral and/or nasopharyngeal ulcers are typically nonpainful. In contrast,
herpetic chancre blisters are usually painful.

• 10% of SLE patients have subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE),
while 50% of SCLE patients have SLE.
Erythematous, papulosquamous, or annular lesions commonly occur on sunexposed skin.
Photosensitivity is a prominent feature of SCLE.
193

Most patients with SCLE will have SSA antibody.

• Nonscarring alopecia, livedo reticularis, and vasculitis may also be present.
Soft tissue swelling and erythema can also occur on the fingers, in between
joints (compared to Gottron’s papules seen in dermatomyositis, see Chapter
35, Inflammatory Myopathies).
Renal Signs and Symptoms

• Renal involvement is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in SLE patients.
• Clinical involvement of the kidney occurs in over 50% of SLE patients, but
pathologic abnormalities can be seen in patients with no known renal disease
(silent lupus nephritis).

• Findings range from asymptomatic proteinuria to frank nephritic and nephrotic
syndrome.

• Classification criteria initially were presented in 1978, but were revised by the
International Society of Nephrology/World Health Organization (ISN/WHO) in
2003 (summarized in Tables 12-3 and 12-4).1,2 The revised criteria are based
on glomerular findings on kidney biopsy.
TABLE 12-3 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF NEPHROLOGY/RENAL
PATHOLOGY SOCIETY REVISED CLASSIFICATION OF LUPUS
NEPHRITIS

194

In general, classes III and IV have more severe nephritis and are associated
with poorer prognosis.

• Kidney biopsies should be performed when renal functioning is worsening,
abnormal urinary sediments are seen, or when the clinical picture is unclear.
Other conditions observed in SLE patients and worsening renal function
include nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) toxicity, uncontrolled
hypertension, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).

• Vascular disease occurs in the setting of immune complex deposition within
the endothelium of the vessel, immunoglobulin microvascular casts, vasculitis,
or a thrombotic microangiopathy similar to TTP.

• Tubulointerstitial nephritis is often seen with glomerular disease, and
correlates with increased creatinine, hypertension, and advanced clinical
course.

• End-stage lupus nephritis requires hemodialysis, and some patients may be
suitable for transplantation.
Interestingly, many symptoms of SLE become quiescent once dialysis is
initiated.
Recurrence of nephritis in allograft transplantation occurs in 5% of patients.
Gastrointestinal Signs and Symptoms
195

• Most symptoms are from medication side effects, rather than SLE itself.
NSAIDs, azathioprine (AZA), and corticosteroids are associated with
pancreatitis.
TABLE 12-4 CLINICAL CORRELATES TO LUPUS NEPHRITIS CLASSES

Abnormal hepatic function tests can be seen, particularly in the setting of
concurrent NSAID use. Frank autoimmune hepatitis is rare in the setting of
SLE.

• Most common symptoms include anorexia, nausea, or vomiting.
• Abdominal pain has a wide range of etiologies.
Infection, thrombosis (sometimes associated with antiphospholipid antibody
syndrome [APLS]), medication side effects, appendicitis, peptic ulcer
disease (from steroids or NSAIDs), and gastroenteritis are the most common
causes.
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection should be considered for patients on
immunosuppression who have abdominal pain and gastrointestinal
bleeding.
Abdominal pain due to SLE is usually from peritoneal inflammation, though
this is much less common than pleural inflammation.
Less commonly, mesenteric vasculitis can occur.
This can present with lower abdominal pain that can be mild in nature due
196

to the inflammatory blunting associated with immunosuppressive
medications.
However, these patients can rapidly deteriorate and end up with bowel
infarction, perforation, and peritonitis.
Consideration for abdominal CT with arteriogram may be necessary to
differentiate from more benign causes of abdominal pain. Keep in mind that
high-dose steroid use may mask serious abdominal conditions.
Pulmonary Signs and Symptoms

• Pleuritic chest pain is the most common pulmonary symptom. This may be due
to costochondritis and can be distinguished from pleuritis by palpating the
painful areas.

• The most common sign is pleural effusion, and is usually associated with
pleuritis.
Most pleural effusions are asymptomatic.
Pleural fluid is typically exudative with 3,000 to 5,000 white blood cells
(WBC)/mm3, normal glucose, decreased complement levels, and positive
ANA.

• Less commonly (<10%), pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, pulmonary
hypertension, and alveolar hemorrhage can occur.
Acute pneumonitis and alveolar hemorrhage both can present identically.
Fever, cough, dyspnea, pleurisy along with late inspiratory crackles occur in
both settings. CT scanning will demonstrate a ground glass appearance, seen
with alveolitis. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) can differentiate the two, as
the diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is elevated
with alveolar hemorrhage. Bronchoscopy may also be useful for directly
observing frank blood associated with alveolar hemorrhage.
The prevalence of interstitial lung disease is increased in those who were
diagnosed with SLE as a child and now are in their 20s to 30s. These
patients will have a restrictive pattern in their PFTs.

• Thromboembolic involvement occurs in the setting of APLS (see Chapter 39,
Antiphospholipid Syndrome).

• A rare complication is shrinking lung syndrome, characterized by dyspnea,
episodic pleuritis chest pain, and progressive reduction in lung volume in the
absence of interstitial fibrosis or pleural disease on CT.
197

Cardiovascular Signs and Symptoms

• The most frequent cause of symptomatic cardiac disease is pericardial disease.
Typically presents with positional substernal chest pain that may be
associated with an audible rub on auscultation.
Often co-presents with other serositis symptoms (pleuritis and pleural
effusion).
Echocardiogram usually reveals a pericardial effusion that is not
hemodynamically compromising.
Pericardial effusion is one of the most common echocardiographic findings
and may occur in asymptomatic patients.
Pericardial tamponade most commonly occurs after prolonged periods of
uncontrolled pericarditis; it is very unusual to be a presenting
manifestation of SLE. When the effusion is severe, pericardiocentesis must
be performed. Purulent, neoplastic, or tuberculous causes should be
considered.

• Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a common cardiac manifestation in SLE
patients but is rarely due to coronary artery vasculitis. Most often it is due to
accelerated atherosclerosis.
Young women have up to a 55-fold increase in the risk of CAD compared to
their non-lupus cohort.
Suspicion for CAD must be high in any SLE patient, even in young females.

• Systolic murmurs are common, occurring in up to 40% of SLE patients.
Most are functional murmurs, occurring from anemia, fever, tachycardia, or
cardiomegaly.
Mitral valve involvement, particularly mitral valve prolapse, is the most
common valvular etiology of systolic murmur.
Valvular disease in SLE patient confers an increased risk of serious
complications from cerebrovascular disease, peripheral embolism, heart
failure, and infectious endocarditis.
A more extreme example of valvular disease is Libman–Sacks endocarditis,
developing in 6% to 10% of SLE patients.
Nonbacterial verrucous lesions near the edge of the mitral, aortic, or
tricuspid valves can lead to regurgitation in the most severe cases.
While lesions are usually asymptomatic, fragments can break off
198

producing systemic emboli. The risk of infective endocarditis is also
increased.
The development of lesions does not correlate with disease activity.

• A common complaint is Raynaud’s phenomenon of the hands, feet, ears, or
nose, which can be induced by cold or emotion. Two color changes (red,
white, or blue) must be reported in order to confirm the diagnosis.

• Myocarditis is an uncommon, asymptomatic manifestation usually seen
concurrently with pericarditis.
Most typical presentation is a resting tachycardia out of proportion to
temperature with nonspecific EKG findings and cardiomegaly.
Global hypokinesis on echocardiography is a common finding.

• Pediatric considerations
In mothers with positive anti-SSA (Ro) or anti-SSB (La) antibodies, there
is a 3% risk for the fetus of developing neonatal lupus with congenital
heart block.
Neuropsychiatric Signs and Symptoms

• The range of symptoms is extremely broad, encompassing subtle symptoms
such as poor concentration and emotional disturbance to severe symptoms such
as stroke, seizures, and psychosis.

• The American College of Rheumatology has defined criteria on the basis of
either central or peripheral manifestations (Table 12-5).
Even with these criteria, it can be very difficult to determine whether the
symptom is functional (i.e., from a psychological basis) or organic (i.e.,
from a central or peripheral source). If organic, one has to determine if the
symptom is from SLE or another cause. Some believe that antineuronal
antibodies may be able to distinguish SLE-derived disease.
From the most to least common, symptoms range from depression, cognitive
disturbance, headache, mood disorder, cerebrovascular disease, seizure,
polyneuropathy, anxiety, and psychosis.
Often, other signs and symptoms of SLE will accompany the central
nervous system (CNS) manifestations.
CNS lupus patients may have antiribosomal P protein antibody.

• Many find it easier to separate symptoms into psychiatric or neurologic
199

manifestations.
Psychiatric

• A diagnosis of psychiatric disturbance from SLE is always one of exclusion.
• One must first consider infection, electrolyte abnormalities, renal failure, drug
effects, mass lesions, arterial emboli, and primary psychiatric disorders.
TABLE 12-5 ABRIDGED VERSION OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF
RHEUMATOLOGY DEFINITIONS FOR NEUROPSYCHIATRIC
MANIFESTATIONS OF SYSTEMIC LUPUS ERYTHEMATOSUS

• Depression is the most common psychiatric symptom seen in SLE patients, but
this is thought to be of functional etiology rather than from SLE itself.

• Most acute psychiatric disturbances occur within the first two years of
diagnosis.

• SLE-associated psychosis is a medical emergency

(see Chapter 7,
Rheumatologic Emergencies). Treatment with antipsychotics and pulse-dose
corticosteroids must be started as soon as possible to prevent permanent brain
damage.
Corticosteroids are themselves often associated with psychosis. Symptoms
often correlate with initiation or dose increase of drug.
200

Nevertheless, given the significant impact SLE-associated psychosis has on
long-term brain function, increasing the corticosteroid dose is justified when
in doubt.

• Cognitive defects range from short- or long-term memory difficulty, impaired
judgment and abstract thinking, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, and personality
changes.
Cognitive dysfunction has not been directly correlated with disease activity.
Neurologic

• Stroke syndrome is seen in 19% of SLE patients, with an age- and sexadjusted odds ratio of 1:5.
Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and baseline disease activity are established
risk factors. Each factor contributes to the vasculopathy seen in SLE patients.
Antiphospholipid antibodies are often present in patients with stroke
syndrome and SLE (see Chapter 39, Antiphospholipid Syndrome). Transient
ischemic attacks and small recurrent strokes are most commonly seen in this
cohort.

• Seizures are observed in 10% to 20% of SLE patients.
Both partial (both complex and focal) and generalized seizures occur.
Associated with antiphospholipid and anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibodies.

• Headaches, both tension and migraine, commonly occur in SLE.
• Neuropathy occurs in 10% to 15% of patients, usually due to a vasculopathy
of the small vessels affecting peripheral nerves.
Sensory nerves are more affected than motor nerves. Most commonly,
bilateral asymmetric paresthesias or numbness occurs and is worse at night.
Underdiagnosed is a small-fiber neuropathy causing painful symptoms in
the absence of nerve conduction study changes.
Generalized sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy also occurs with
electromyographic and nerve conduction abnormalities, suggesting axonal
degeneration.
Typically, symptoms are worse later in the course of disease.

• Uncommon manifestations include transverse myelitis, CNS vasculitis,
reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), movement
disorders (such chorea or ataxia), cranial neuropathies, and aseptic meningitis.
201

Transverse myelitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate
assessment. It presents with sudden onset of bowel and bladder incontinence
and lower extremity weakness that rapidly ascends, possible with sensory
loss (see Chapter 7, Rheumatologic Emergencies). Cerebrospinal fluid
(CSF) analysis reveals increased protein and pleocytosis. Urgent imaging
with MRI is essential.
CNS vasculitis is an extremely rare manifestation of SLE. This entity
distinctly presents with fever, severe headache, and confusion progressing
rapidly to psychosis, seizures, and coma.
RPLS presents with seizures, altered mental status, vision changes, and
headache. MRI can help differentiate this from CNS lupus by demonstrating
vasogenic cerebral edema predominantly in the posterior cerebral
hemisphere.
Hematologic Signs and Symptoms

• Anemia is the most common hematologic abnormality in SLE.
Anemia of chronic disease (AOCD) is the most common etiology, but
autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA), microangiopathic hemolytic anemia
(MAHA), renal failure, and iron deficiency are also seen.
AIHA is characterized by elevated reticulocyte count, low haptoglobin
levels (which may be obscured by its increase as an acute phase reactant
in inflammation), increased indirect bilirubin levels, and a positive
Coombs’ test. However, a positive Coombs’ test can be seen in the
absence of AIHA and vice versa.
MAHA is characterized with a peripheral blood smear demonstrating
schistocytes and elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and bilirubin
levels. One must be vigilant to the features of TTP (see below) that
requires different therapy.

• Leukopenia is also common and correlates with disease activity.
Neutropenia may result from disease activity, medications (i.e.,
cyclophosphamide [CYC] or AZA), bone marrow dysfunction, or
hypersplenism.
Interestingly, CNS lupus has been associated with severe neutropenia.
Lymphopenia, particularly of T cells, is observed in over 50% of SLE
patients, and is also caused by steroid therapy.
202

Depressed eosinophil and basophil counts are typically associated with
steroid therapy.

• Thrombocytopenia has several potential causes, including iatrogenic (i.e.,
heparin). Mild thrombocytopenia (platelet counts between 100,000 and
150,000/μL) is seen in up to 50% of patients, with counts of less than
50,000/μL in only 10%.
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a major etiology, with
antibody binding to platelets, followed by splenic phagocytosis causing
immune-mediated destruction. ITP may be the first presenting sign of SLE in
some patients.
TTP leads to platelet consumption, and is a medical emergency (see Chapter
7, Rheumatologic Emergencies).
Affected patients will have concurrent renal failure, MAHA, fever, and
neurologic involvement.
Schistocytes on peripheral blood smear with an elevated LDH, reduced
haptoglobin, and elevated bilirubin will be seen.
Urgent plasmapheresis should be initiated.
Antibodies that function to inhibit ADAMTS13 are typically seen, but
therapy should not be delayed until results of this specialized test are
reported.

• Thrombocytosis is infrequent, and is associated with increased risk of
thromboembolic disease, particularly in the setting of APLS or nephrotic
syndrome (renal vein thrombosis).

• Pancytopenia can be due to peripheral destruction or bone marrow failure.
Acute leukemia, large granular lymphocyte leukemia, myelodysplastic
syndromes, overwhelming infection and paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria (PNH) all can induce bone marrow failure with autoimmune
features resembling SLE.
Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a form of hemophagocytic
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) seen in connective tissue diseases.
Marked cytopenias of two or three cell lines are seen, with a reduction
in ESR, elevations in prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT), hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperferritinemia.
Low or absent natural killer cell activity and elevations in soluble CD25
(interleukin [IL]-2 receptor) are typically seen.
203

Fever, weight loss, arthritis, and rash are common symptoms.
Bone marrow biopsy will reveal hemophagocytosis.
MAS responds well to immunosuppression.

• APLS (see Chapter 39, Antiphospholipid Syndrome) is associated with
elevated aPTT, thrombocytopenia, arterial and venous thrombosis, and fetal
loss. The presence of lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, or
anti–beta-2-glycoprotein-1 antibodies characterizes this syndrome.
Ophthalmologic Signs and Symptoms

• The most common manifestation of the eye is conjunctivitis sicca, also seen in
Sjögren’s syndrome (see Chapter 37, Sjögren’s Syndrome).

• Anterior uveitis, keratitis, and episcleritis present with photophobia and pain.
Eye pain in the absence of photophobia is characteristic of scleritis.

• Retinal vasculopathy is characterized by cotton–wool exudates and usually is
associated with CNS lupus. Retinal vasculitis can be detected with fluorescein
dye angiography where microaneurysms are visible.

• Corticosteroids may worsen or cause glaucoma and cataract formation.
• In addition, retinal detachment associated with a fibrinous exudate can be
confused with retinal vasculopathy or vasculitis.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The American College of Rheumatology has defined revised classification
criteria in 1997 to establish the diagnosis of SLE for clinical studies (Table
12-1).

• The diagnosis of SLE requires multiorgan involvement with evidence of
autoimmunity.
A patient who likely has SLE may complain of fatigue, joint pain, chest pain,
and photosensitivity.
Exam reveals malar rash, nontender oral ulcers, and several swollen and
tender joints.
Laboratory results demonstrate a mild anemia, proteinuria, positive Coombs’
test, and ANAs, usually with anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA)
antibodies.
204

Chest radiograph shows small bilateral pleural effusions.

• Symptoms are often vague at initial presentation, and the diagnosis may become
more apparent over time.

• A thorough history and physical examination is necessary to confidently
diagnose SLE since no single diagnostic test is pathognomonic.
Differential Diagnosis

• The highly variable manifestations of SLE lead to a very broad differential
diagnosis.

• Typically, infection, other connective tissue diseases, and other systemic
conditions such as sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, and malignancies are considered.
Diagnostic Testing
SLE is one of the diseases where the diagnostic testing only supplements a careful
history and physical examination.
Laboratories

• Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), complete blood count (CBC) with
differential, ESR, C-reactive protein (CRP), and urinalysis (UA) provide
diagnostically useful information and should be obtained for every suspected
and established SLE patient. Complement (C3 and C4) levels can be
beneficial in those patients whose complement levels correlate with disease
activity (lower complement levels, higher disease activity).

• Autoantibodies are characteristic of SLE, and represent autoreactivity to
nuclear proteins and nucleic acids. As a result, these are usually the first
diagnostic tests ordered (see Chapter 5, Laboratory Evaluation of Rheumatic
Diseases).
ANA is present in >99% of SLE patients, meaning that its absence virtually
rules out SLE.
Patients with SLE typically have ANA positivity in significant titers
(>1:160). Suspicion of an autoimmune disorder should be elevated when
titers >1:640.
The pattern of ANA reactivity has little diagnostic value since
recognition of patterns is dependent on the experience of the operator and
205

serum dilution.
The false positive rate in healthy people varies from 30% with titers of
1:40 (high sensitivity, low specificity) to 3% with titers of 1:320 (low
sensitivity, high specificity).3
Among patients referred to a rheumatologist with a positive ANA (titer
≥1:40), only 19% were diagnosed with SLE.4 Most of the ANA-positive
patients without SLE had no disease whatsoever, or had fibromyalgia-like
manifestations.
Low-titer ANAs can be found in other autoimmune diseases such as
Sjögren’s syndrome, scleroderma, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, rheumatoid
arthritis, interstitial lung disease, primary autoimmune cholangitis, or
autoimmune hepatitis or thyroiditis.
Certain medications (Table 12-2) can induce ANA positivity and a
condition called DIL.
DIL presents with mild manifestations of lupus, and typically without
internal organ involvement.
Symptoms usually cease after stopping the offending medication.
Antihistone antibodies are characteristic of this condition.
Most drug-induced ANAs are not associated with clinical symptoms of
SLE.
Once a significant titer ANA is obtained, speciation of the autoantibodies
should be performed, including assays for anti-dsDNA, anti-Sm, anti-SSA
(Ro), anti-SSB (La), anti-RNP, antiphospholipid antibodies, and antiribosomal P protein antibodies.
Anti-dsDNA and anti-Sm are highly specific for SLE. Anti-dsDNA
antibodies may correlate with disease activity and nephritis.
Unfortunately, they have poor sensitivity with only about 30% of SLE
patients showing positivity for these tests.
Anti-RNP associates with SLE, mixed connective tissue disease, and
scleroderma.
Anti-SSA and anti-SSB are associated with Sjögren’s syndrome and
neonatal lupus. Anti-SSA is seen with lymphopenia, photosensitivity, C2
deficiency, and subacute cutaneous lupus.
Anti-ribosomal P protein is associated with CNS lupus.

Imaging

• Decision to pursue imaging is dependent on the patient’s symptom complex and
whether the test will add diagnostic or prognostic value.
For chest pain, consider chest radiograph and/or CT, EKG.
For joint pain, consider plain radiographs of affected joints.
For renal involvement, consider renal ultrasound to assess kidney size and
rule out urinary tract obstruction.
For abdominal pain, consider abdominal and pelvic CT and/or angiogram if
vasculitis is suspected.
For CNS manifestations, consider brain MRI.
For peripheral neuropathies or weakness, consider nerve conduction studies
with electromyography.
Diagnostic Procedures

• As with imaging, decision to obtain fluid or tissue is dependent on the
symptoms and the value to diagnosis or prognosis.
For rash, consider skin biopsy.
For renal involvement, consider kidney biopsy.
For fluid associated with serositis (pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, or
ascites), consider draining fluid.
For cytopenias with suspected bone marrow involvement, consider bone
marrow biopsy.
For joint effusions, consider arthrocentesis.
TREATMENT

• Treatment is based on type and severity of clinical manifestations (see
Chapter 9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases). For example,
mild photosensitive rash requires much different treatment than life-threatening
lupus nephritis.

• Symptoms that are mild and not organ- or life-threatening are typically treated
with less potent immunosuppressive medications or non-pharmacologic
therapies in order to minimize side effects.

•

Conversely, organ- or life-threatening disease
207

requires maximal

immunosuppression.
A way to think about which immunosuppressant to use in these cases is to
divide the medications into induction and maintenance therapies.
Since SLE is a chronic, incurable condition characterized with flares, certain
drugs are reserved for quickly resolving lupus flares and some are best for
suppression of subsequent flares. Typically, drugs used for flares have side
effect profiles preventing their long-term use.
The maintenance medications are used for cytotoxic- and steroid-sparing
purposes, and to suppress future flares. These medications do not rapidly
resolve active flares.
Medications
For Mild Disease

• Usually, mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic (excluding hemolytic
anemia and MAS), and serositis complaints can be treated with less potent
immunosuppressive therapies.

• NSAIDs/cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors
Used for the treatment of arthralgias, arthritis, fever, and mild serositis.

• Aspirin
Low-dose aspirin is used for primary prevention of APLS, where it has
limited efficacy.

• HCQ (antimalarial)
Very useful for mucocutaneous disease, arthritis, alopecia, and fatigue.
Because of its beneficial effect on lipid profiles it may also help prevent
CAD. Daily dose of 4 to 6 mg/kg (200–400 mg) after meals is typical.
Onset of action is very slow (about 6 weeks) and peak efficacy may not be
reached for 4 months.
GI side effects, especially nausea, are the most common.
Regular ophthalmologic visits (q6–60 months depending on age, liver and
kidney function, and dose) should occur as HCQ can bind to melanin in the
retina damaging rods and cones leading to blindness.
Test for glucose-6-phosphate deficiency as these patients are at increased
risk for hemolysis.

208

If there are no contraindications, most SLE patients are placed on HCQ
therapy regardless of type of disease. There is evidence for a reduced
frequency of major kidney and CNS damage for those on HCQ therapy.5

• Dapsone
Used in cutaneous lupus such as bullous lupus, subacute cutaneous lupus,
and discoid lupus. Starting dose is 50 mg PO q day, with a typical dose of
100 mg PO q day.
Test for glucose-6-phosphate deficiency as these patients are at increased
risk for hemolysis. Hemoglobin and reticulocyte count should be monitored
during therapy.

• Topical steroids
Hydrocortisone can be used early in mild skin disease, but most require
fluorinated preparations that possess increased potency. Do not use
fluorinated steroids on the face.
Ointments are more effective than creams.
Scalp lesions should be treated with lotions, gels, or solutions.

• Low-dose systemic corticosteroids
Doses of prednisone ≤15 mg PO daily are effective until a steroid-sparing
agent (i.e., HCQ) can take effect.
For Moderate–severe Disease

• High-dose systemic corticosteroids
The most potent and fastest acting class of immunosuppressive medications.
Used primarily for induction therapy.
Pulse-dose corticosteroids (methylprednisolone):
Reserved for organ-threatening disease.
Dosed 1 g IV q day × 3 days, followed by a taper with oral steroids
(prednisone ≤60 mg PO q day).
This approach is entirely empiric, with no clinical data supporting this
dosing regimen; nevertheless, it is widely used.
Oral corticosteroids (prednisone):
Used for moderately severe flares or tapering from pulse-dose steroids.
Goal is to change to steroid-sparing therapies as quickly as possible to
209

reduce the risk of the numerous side effects associated with steroids.
Every SLE patient on corticosteroids should be considered for a steroidsparing agent, especially once the acute flare has been controlled, and
osteoporosis prevention should be considered.

• CYC
Reserved for severe disease manifestations, such as severe lupus nephritis,
CNS lupus, APLS, or vasculitis. Strongly considered for any lifethreatening disease.
Considered induction therapy, but onset of action is somewhat longer than
that for corticosteroids, so it is often used concomitantly with high-dose
steroids in induction therapy.
Can be delivered IV (monthly) or PO (daily).
In general, IV CYC has shown efficacy in inducing the remission of severe
SLE manifestations, such as diffuse proliferative nephritis. This approach
is advantageous to daily PO CYC since the total dose of drug is less over
a fixed period of time. This reduces the risk of severe side effects seen
with CYC therapy. Concomitant use of 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate sodium
(MESNA) may also reduce the risk of cystitis and bladder cancer.
However, oral CYC is considered to be more potent.
High-dose IV CYC (National Institutes of Health protocol) has been
traditionally used for severe disease. More recently, low-dose IV CYC
protocol (Euro-Lupus protocol) has been increasingly used with equal
efficacy for proliferative lupus nephritis.6
Check a CBC 8 to 10 days after IV CYC infusion to monitor for a dosedependent nadir leukocyte count. The target count should be 2.5 to
3.5/mm3. Lymphopenia will be common, but neutropenia should be
avoided.
Nausea, vomiting, alopecia, bone marrow suppression, infections, and
bladder carcinoma are the most common adverse reactions.

• Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)
Typically used to prevent renal allograft rejection, data suggest MMF
noninferiority to IV CYC in short-term remission from lupus nephritis with a
better safety profile.7
May also be useful as a steroid-sparing agent.
Dosing ranges from 500 to 1,500 mg PO bid.
210

Side effects include GI upset, cytopenias, and increased risk of infections.

• AZA
Used as a steroid-sparing agent, and thus is considered a maintenance
mediation.
Dosage is 2 to 2.5 mg/kg/day.
Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) inactivates AZA, so TPMT enzyme
activity should be checked prior to use to prevent bone marrow toxicity.
Even low doses of AZA can cause pancytopenia in individuals with low
TPMT enzyme activity.
Regularly monitor hepatic and renal function as it is hepatic metabolized
and renal excreted.
Be cautious with its use with allopurinol, since acute pancytopenia can occur
with concurrent use.
Can be used in pregnancy, but does pass into breast milk and breastfeeding is
not advised.

• Methotrexate (MTX)
Conflicting results with the use of MTX for SLE exist within the literature.
It appears that MTX is efficacious for cutaneous and articular
manifestations, allowing for tapering of steroid. Considered a steroidsparing agent.
Usually dosed between 7.5 and 20 mg PO q week.
Folic acid supplementation (1 mg PO q day) may be needed to abrogate some
of the side effects of MTX, including alopecia, gastrointestinal complaints,
hepatic function test elevations, and mucositis.
MTX should be discontinued 6 months prior to pregnancy for both males and
females.

• Cyclosporine
Not commonly used for SLE, but has been efficacious for moderate systemic
manifestations of lupus as a steroid-sparing agent.
Dosages range from 2.5 to 5 mg/kg/day.
Side effects are dose dependent and reversible, including hypertension,
hepatic function test and creatinine elevations, GI complaints, tremor, and
infections.
Although effective for membranous glomerulonephritis, long-term treatment
211

can induce interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy.

• B cell modulating agents
Off-label use of rituximab has been efficacious in a subset of SLE patients,
with or without nephritis. Despite these promising preliminary reports,
placebo-controlled randomized trials did not see benefit.8

• Belimumab has recently been shown to be efficacious in phase III trials.9
• Other therapies that have been utilized with varying success include
intravenous immunoglobulin, plasmapheresis, and immunoablation with or
without autologous stem cell transplantation.

• Drug development for SLE is advancing at a very rapid rate with several
candidate drugs demonstrating potential.
Other Medications

• Bisphosphonates should be started with long-term high-dose prednisone use,
or with evidence of osteopenia. Treatment should last for 3 to 5 years.

• Statins should be used on the basis of guidelines for the general population.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

• Sedentary lifestyle is an important feature of SLE. Low impact exercise (i.e.,
water aerobics) is extremely beneficial for SLE patients. This prevents
deconditioning and weight gain.

• For patients with photosensitivity, avoiding intense sun exposure with routine
sunscreen use and appropriate clothing is necessary.

• Smoking cessation is important, as smoking is associated with higher disease
activity and can reduce the efficacy of several medications. Strongly advise
patients to stop smoking.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

• While variable, SLE may significantly worsen during pregnancy.
• Best outcomes occur when the disease has been quiescent from 6 to 12 months
prior to conception.

• Fetal loss is highest when high lupus activity occurs in the first or second
212

trimester or when new onset lupus nephritis occurs in the first trimester.

• Preeclampsia can mimic SLE flares (proteinuria, thrombocytopenia).
• Pregnant SLE patients should be followed closely by a rheumatologist and
high-risk obstetrician.
REFERRAL

• It is appropriate to refer to a rheumatologist when you suspect that a patient has
symptoms consistent with SLE and has a positive ANA.

• Any patient with established SLE should see a rheumatologist for disease
management and monitoring for side effects from immunosuppressive
medications.
For difficult skin manifestations from lupus, dermatology referral is highly
recommended.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• At the time of initial diagnosis, patients are unfamiliar with the disease and its
complexity. Consequently, education and counseling are important. Several
foundations and organizations dedicated to patients with lupus have excellent
resources for the newly diagnosed.

• Patients must be informed of the side effects associated with their specific
immunosuppression regimen to avoid life-threatening complications.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• The goal during follow-up is to monitor for drug-induced toxicity, infection,
and flares.

• A history and physical examination, along with laboratory testing, should be
routinely done during the follow-up period.
When relapses occur, the history and physical findings will typically mimic
the patient’s initial presentation.
CMP, CBC, ESR, CRP, and UA should be obtained with each visit. In some
patients complement levels and anti-DNA titers parallel disease activity and
may be useful in monitoring activity.
213

Lipid profiles and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels should be checked annually.
Dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan should be obtained every
two years.
Routine vaccinations with killed-virus vaccines should be performed.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• SLE has a variable clinical course.
• Many patients relapse, requiring high-dose steroids or induction treatment with
cytotoxic agents.

• Despite this, the 5-year survival rate is greater than 90%. Likelihood of
survival is highly dependent on organs involved. Best outcomes are associated
with skin or musculoskeletal involvement only, while kidney and CNS
involvement confer the poorest prognoses.

• Early in disease, the major cause of mortality is active disease or infection
related to medications. Late in disease, SLE itself (i.e., end-stage renal
disease), vascular disease, infections, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and lung cancer
are the leading causes of death.

Gout
Richa Gupta and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Gout is a disease related to deposition of uric acid, classically in the joints, soft
tissues (termed tophi), or kidney interstitium, and/or formation of uric acid
nephrolithiasis.
Classification

• The natural history of gout classically has three stages:
Asymptomatic hyperuricemia usually exists for years before the initial acute
attack. It is important to note that most patients with hyperuricemia do not
develop gout.
Acute intermittent gout then develops. Patients have acute attacks of
arthritis followed by symptom-free intercritical periods. The attacks become
more frequent and severe.
Chronic gouty arthritis may then ensue. In these patients, the intercritical
periods are no longer asymptomatic, and joint pain persists. Tophi (uric acid
deposits) are often seen in these patients. Gout may also involve the kidneys
(causing gouty nephropathy) and the urinary tract (uric acid stones).
Epidemiology

• Gout is relatively common among the rheumatic diseases.
• Approximately 90% of gout occurs in men between the ages of 30 and 50.
• Gout is very uncommon in premenopausal women.
Pathophysiology

216

• Hyperuricemia may be a primary disorder, i.e., in the absence of conditions or
medications that cause hyperuricemia, or secondary.

• Uric acid is normally produced in the liver in the purine metabolism pathway;
its immediate precursors are hypoxanthine and xanthine which are converted
by xanthine oxidase to uric acid.

• “Normal” uric acid levels reported by clinical laboratories may be misleading
with respect to the pathophysiology of gout.
In comparison to age-matched controls, two standard deviations above the
mean is typically used as the cutoff level to indicate abnormally high levels,
frequently >8.5 mg/dL.
However, uric acid levels >6.8 mg/dL in men and women are supersaturated
in bodily fluids, i.e., they exceed normal soluble concentrations.1

• Uric acid levels in children are typically low (<4.0 mg/dL), rising in men at the
time of puberty.

• In postmenopausal women, uric acid levels approach those of men because of
the loss of the uricosuric effects of estrogen.

• Two-thirds of uric acid excretion is via the kidney, with a small portion of uric
acid excretion by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.

• Primary hyperuricemia
Patients with a complete deficiency of hypoxanthine–guanine phosphoribosyl
transferase (HGPRT) have the X-linked Lesch–Nyhan syndrome with
hyperuricemia, severe neurologic defects, gout, and uric acid stones.
Patients with a partial defect in HGPRT display X-linked, primary
hyperuricemia and classically present with early onset gout and/or uric acid
nephrolithiasis without neurological problems.
However, most patients with primary hyperuricemia do not have an
identifiable cause.

• Secondary hyperuricemia
Many medications, especially thiazide and loop diuretics, can cause
hyperuricemia.
Other medications include cyclosporine, tacrolimus, low-dose aspirin,
niacin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and L-dopa.
Overproduction of uric acid can occur with psoriasis, myeloproliferative
disorders, multiple myeloma, hemoglobinopathies, and cytotoxic drugs.
217

Underexcretion of uric acid may occur in chronic renal disease,
hypothyroidism, and lead poisoning, leading to hyperuricemia.

• Acute gout is an inflammatory response to monosodium urate (MSU)
crystal deposition in the joint space. This is more likely to happen in patients
with high uric acid levels. It is not clear what initiates the inflammatory
process, as crystals can be present in the joint space during asymptomatic
periods without inflammation.

• MSU-induced inflammation appears to be a consequence of activation of the
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like (NLR) family pyrin
domain containing 3 (NLRP3, also known as cryopyrin) inflammasome,
proteolytic cleavage and activation of caspase 1, proteolytic cleavage and
maturation of pro-interleukin-1β, and secretion of mature interleukin (IL)-1b.2
This process is related to inflammation in diseases associated with gain of
function mutations in NLRP3, including familial cold autoinflammatory
syndrome, Muckle–Wells syndrome, and neonatal-onset multisystem
inflammatory disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The sudden onset of severe pain, erythema, swelling, and disability of a
single joint and tenosynovial inflammation characterizes an acute gout attack.
The erythema and swelling may be accompanied by pruritus and fever.
Inflammation often extends beyond the affected joint. Desquamation of the skin
overlying the affected joint frequently occurs after the attack resolves.

• Acute gout initially presents in men between the ages of 40 and 50 and in
postmenopausal women. A much earlier age of onset should lead to an
investigation for an inborn error of metabolism. Acute gout may be precipitated
by alcohol binges, dehydration, recent trauma, surgery, and initiation of drugs
that change uric acid levels (either increase, such as cytotoxic drugs, or
decrease, such as allopurinol, uricase).

• Early attacks of gout are typically monoarticular and involve joints in the
lower extremities.

• The initial attack involves the MTP joint of the great toe (podagra) in about
50% of cases, with about 90% of patients ultimately experiencing podagra
with recurrent attacks. Other common sites are the ankle, knee, and wrist. Gout
218

rarely involves the hips or shoulders.

• An acute attack involves more than one joint in only 20% of cases, but rarely in
initial attacks. When it does, it is usually in an asymmetric distribution. A
polyarticular distribution occurs more frequently with recurrent attacks or
gout attributed to secondary causes (e.g., myeloproliferative disease,
lymphoproliferative disease, or transplant recipient).

• Acute attacks usually peak within the first 12 hours from onset, typically lasts 5
to 7 days, but a severe attack may last up to 2 weeks. Gouty attacks are selflimited and eventually resolve spontaneously.

• Acute intermittent gout: Between acute attacks, patients are asymptomatic for
prolonged periods, termed intercritical periods. Without treatment, the typical
patient can expect a recurrent attack within 2 years of the initial attack.
However, some patients may not experience another attack. Recurrent attacks
are usually more severe and more likely to be polyarticular.

• Chronic gouty arthritis: Left untreated, the disease may progress to chronic
gouty arthritis in approximately 12 years (range, 5–40 years).

• Chronic tophaceous gout is characterized by the deposition of MSU in
connective tissue as soft tissue masses known as tophi. Smaller tophi may
cause joint erosions seen on radiographs, manifested as polyarticular
deforming arthritis that particularly involves the hands. In some patients, this
arthritis may be difficult to differentiate in clinical appearance from
rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

• Tophi occur most commonly at the base of the great toe, fingers, wrists, hands,
olecranon bursa, and Achilles tendon. Higher uric acid levels are associated
with more tophi. Complications of tophi include pain, deformity, joint
destruction, and nerve compression.
Differential Diagnosis

• An acute attack of gout needs to be distinguished from cellulitis, septic arthritis,
pseudogout, and RA.

• Gout mimics cellulitis in that the affected area is swollen, erythematous, and
painful and may be accompanied by fever and leukocytosis.
If cellulitis is suspected, the joint should not be aspirated through the
overlying skin infection to avoid seeding a secondary septic arthritis.
219

In some cases, it may be necessary to treat with antibiotics for 1 to 2 days
while awaiting blood cultures and other indications of infection before
considering gout as a leading diagnosis.

• Septic arthritis must always be considered in a patient with acute
monoarticular arthritis, especially with fever and leukocytosis.
Joint aspiration is critical to rule out bacterial infection; treat suspicious
cases with antibiotics as for cellulitis.
Gouty joints are more susceptible to bacterial infection, and the two
conditions may occur simultaneously.

• Pseudogout should always be considered when entertaining the diagnosis of
gout. It is most readily distinguished from gout by the presence of calcium
pyrophosphate crystals in the joint.

• Chronic gout may mimic RA because some chronic gout patients may display a
symmetric polyarthritis. They may also develop tophi in sites where
rheumatoid nodules typically occur. In contrast to RA, chronic gout typically
presents at an older age and is seronegative. Radiographs may show changes
typical of gout.
Diagnostic Testing

• The diagnosis is based primarily on history, physical examination, and the
presence of MSU crystals in joint fluid or tophus.

• Hyperuricemia alone is not diagnostic for gout, even with a history of acute
arthritis, which could be due to many other possible disorders.
Laboratories

• Patients with gout almost invariably have hyperuricemia, but uric acid levels
may be normal during an attack.

• Attacks are also associated with an increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) and leukocyte count.

• None of these laboratory tests are helpful in making the diagnosis of gout.
Imaging

• Joint radiographs early in the course of the disease are normal, but as the
disease

progresses, characteristic punched-out joint erosions with
220

overhanging edges (“rat-bite lesions”) in the bone may be evident.

• Significant joint destruction may occur.
• Tophi may be evident on other radiographs.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Aspiration of the joint is essential for diagnosis and reveals intracellular
monosodium urate crystals.

• Monosodium urate crystals are needle-shaped and demonstrate negative
birefringence with polarized microscopy. Crystals can also be identified
during the intercritical period in an asymptomatic patient but are usually not
intracellular.

• Leukocyte counts are elevated in the joint fluid, usually 15,000/μL or higher
with a predominance of neutrophils. Leukocyte count of greater than 50,000/μL
should raise suspicion for a bacterial joint infection.
TREATMENT
First and foremost, one should treat the acute attack; later, consider the need for
treating hyperuricemia and also the other components of the metabolic syndrome that
are commonly present.
Acute Gouty Attack

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered first line
therapy, though contraindications may limit their use because the typical gout
patient is somewhat older and has comorbid conditions.
Essentially any NSAID may be used but most have not been adequately
studied.
NSAIDs are typically used at full maximal daily doses with improvement in
symptoms expected within a few hours.
Contraindications include peptic ulcer disease, chronic renal insufficiency,
and drug allergy.
Commonly used NSAIDs are ibuprofen in full doses of 800 mg qid, naproxen
as 500 mg bid, or indomethacin as 50 mg tid.
Selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors may also be used with similar
221

efficacy and lower GI toxicity as compared to indomethacin.
Aspirin should not be used, as it impairs uric acid secretion.

• Intraarticular or systemic corticosteroid therapy is of particular benefit in
patients with contraindications to NSAID usage.3 Septic arthritis should be
ruled out before initiating any corticosteroid therapy.
Intraarticular steroid injections are used frequently as a safe, local treatment
in all patients (e.g., methylprednisolone or triamcinolone 10–40 mg).
Oral corticosteroid therapy is reserved for patients who have failed or have a
contraindication to NSAIDs or colchicine, or are experiencing a
polyarticular attack. A typical regimen of prednisone is started at 40 to 60
mg PO qd and tapered over 7 to 10 days. A rebound attack may occur with
tapering of corticosteroids.

• Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is an option in patients who cannot
tolerate other recommended therapies.
ACTH was believed to exert its main beneficial effect by adrenal
corticosteroid release. New evidence shows that, instead, peripheral
activation of a melanocortin receptor, melanocortin type 3 receptor (MC3R),
could be responsible, at least in part, for ACTH’s efficacy in acute gout.4
The dosage 40 to 80 IU in a single dose or every 12 hours for 1 to 2 days, SC
or IM.

• Colchicine was once the drug of choice for acute gout but toxicity and delayed
effectiveness have diminished enthusiasm for its use in the typical patient.
However, it may have a role in a patient with contraindications for other
treatment choices.
It is most effective if started within the first 12 to 24 hours of the attack. Oral
dosing is limited by GI side effects, most predominately diarrhea with
cramping that may be severe.
At the first sign of an attack in patients with normal renal function, this agent
is usually administered as one or two 0.6-mg tablets, followed by one 0.6mg tablet 1 hour later. The maximum recommended treatment dosage 1.8 mg
over a 1-hour period.5 The patient should respond within 48 hours.
Recommended prophylactic dosage is 0.6 mg once or twice daily.
Drug-drug interactions with colchicine occur largely with agents that interfere
with the functions of the membrane P-glycoprotein multiple drug resistance
transporter and/or the cytochrome P450, as both these are involved in
222

colchicine metabolism.
In patients with creatinine clearance of <30 mL/minute, colchicine dose
adjustment is not required but redosing within 2 weeks is not recommended.
In hemodialysis patients, a maximum dose of 0.6 mg/attack is recommended.
Intravenous colchicine use is associated with the potential for very
serious toxicity and in 2008 the United States Food and Drug
Administration banned the manufacturing or shipping of IV colchicines in
the US.

•

Experimental antiinflammatory therapy: IL-1 is a prominent
proinflammatory cytokine released as a result of innate immune mechanisms
activated by the inflammasome. It is suspected to play a role in inducing the
symptoms of the acute gout flare. Hence, there are currently trials underway
examining the recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, in acute gouty
arthritis.6 Although not yet FDA approved for this indication, it may be
considered for use in acute gout at a dose of 100 mg subcutaneously daily for 3
days where standard therapy is contraindicated or not effective.

• Analgesia: Acute attacks usually resolve spontaneously within 5 to 7 days.
Patients with contraindications to the above therapies or complicating factors
(e.g., postoperative patients with NPO orders, renal failure, and coagulopathy)
may require opioid analgesics.
Prophylactic Therapy

• Prophylactic therapy may be given daily to prevent the recurrence of acute
attacks.

• It must also be given before the initiation of treatment to lower uric acid levels,
as changes in uric acid levels may precipitate acute attacks.

• The dose of colchicine is 0.6 mg PO qd or bid or even once every other day,
unless the patient has renal or hepatic disease. Possible side effects of longterm colchicine therapy include myositis and mixed peripheral neuropathy.

• Daily indomethacin or other NSAIDs are also useful in prophylaxis. Use with
caution in the elderly because of the risk of peptic ulcer disease and chronic
renal insufficiency. Indomethacin at the dose of 25 mg bid may be effective
although the data are very limited.

223

Treatment of Hyperuricemia

• Asymptomatic hyperuricemia does not require treatment.
Hyperuricemia is highly prevalent among hypertensive patients.
Almost 75% of patients with hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency
have increased uric acid levels.
Hyperuricemia is independently associated with increased mortality in
patients with cardiovascular disease, especially in women, but it is not clear
whether treatment of hyperuricemia in these patients is beneficial.

• Treatment of hyperuricemia aims to reduce serum uric acid levels and prevent
progression of disease to chronic gouty arthritis.

• Criteria for initiating treatment of hyperuricemia in patients with
symptomatic gout include:
Tophaceous gout.
Gouty nephropathy.
Uric acid kidney stones
Repeated attacks (generally >2/year).
It is debatable whether to institute treatment of hyperuricemia after a single
acute gout attack.

• The goal of therapy is to achieve a serum uric acid level of approximately 6
mg/dL.7 When the uric acid level is <6.0 mg/dL, monosodium urate crystals are
reabsorbed from the joint and soft-tissue tophi.

• Suppression with chronic therapy eventually leads to alleviation of the arthritis,
although bony abnormalities and other structural defects are not affected.
Normalization of serum uric acid should prevent further structural damage.

• Do not start these agents during an acute attack, rather, start them 4 to 6
weeks after the attack subsides and while the patient has had at least one week
of prophylactic therapy.

• If the patient is on an antihyperuricemic agent, do not discontinue it during
an acute attack because any alteration in serum uric acid levels may
precipitate or prolong attacks.

• Continue therapy to lower uric acid levels indefinitely. A common mistake is
stopping treatment when uric acid level has normalized, which usually
precipitates another attack.
224

Xanthine Oxidase Inhibitors

• Allopurinol is currently the preferred agent for lowering uric acid levels in
patients with arthritis and/or kidney involvement. It is useful in patients with
overproduction of uric acid and is also beneficial for tophaceous gout.
It decreases urate production by inhibiting the final step of urate synthesis
and, thus, decreases uric acid levels, facilitating tophus mobilization.
Allopurinol may also precipitate acute attacks when started; therefore,
continue prophylactic colchicine or NSAIDs for 2 weeks after initiation of
allopurinol or change in allopurinol dose.
The initial dose is 100 mg PO qd. After 2 weeks, if the uric acid is still
elevated, increase the dose to 300 mg qd. Further titration of allopurinol
dose may be necessary depending on the uric acid levels. Because
allopurinol is primarily cleared by the kidney, initial doses must be
adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency.
Multiple drug interactions may occur with allopurinol, including
azathioprine, probenecid, ampicillin, and cyclosporine.
The most common side effects of allopurinol are rash, diarrhea, nausea, liver
dysfunction, and pruritus. If a rash develops, stop the allopurinol
immediately. The rash may herald a more severe but rare (<1 case per 1000
patients treated) reaction especially in patients with renal insufficiency:
exfoliative dermatitis, which can be accompanied by vasculitis, fever, liver
dysfunction, eosinophilia, and acute interstitial nephritis. This Stevens–
Johnson syndrome can carry a 25% mortality.

• Febuxostat is a newly developed and FDA-approved selective inhibitor of
xanthine oxidase and is associated with a sharp reduction in serum uric acid
levels.
Febuxostat produces a dose-dependent decrease in serum urate levels. A
daily dose of 40 mg produces a reduction that is roughly equivalent to that
seen in patients who are treated with allopurinol at a dose of 300 mg per
day.8 Febuxostat is started at a dose of 40 mg/day and can be increased to 80
mg/day if the goal uric acid is not achieved in 2 weeks on low dose 40 mg
daily dose.
It has high bioavailability, and less than 5% is excreted as unchanged drug in
the urine. No dose reduction of febuxostat is recommended in chronic kidney
disease patients.
The place for febuxostat within the urate-lowering agents would be for
225

patients showing intolerance to other urate lowering drugs, and those with
severe gout in whom the target serum uric acid levels should be lower than
usually targeted in order to deplete urate deposits rapidly.
Uricosuric Agents

• Probenecid and sulfinpyrazone inhibit tubular reabsorption of urate. These
agents are ineffective if the serum creatinine level is >2 mg/dL. Do not use
them if the patient has a history of uric acid kidney stones, low urinary flow
(<1 mL/minute), or high levels of urine uric acid at baseline (>800 mg/24
hours).

• Before initiation of therapy, perform a 24-hour urine collection for creatinine
and uric acid to determine if patient fits guidelines for use of uricosuric agents.

• Probenecid is started at 250 mg PO bid, and increments in dose are titrated
according to the serum urate concentration. The dose is typically raised every
several weeks to a maintenance dose of 500 to 1000 mg two or three times
daily; the maximal effective dose is 3 g/day.

• Sulfinpyrazone, where available, is started at a dose of 50 mg twice daily, and
increased in increments over several weeks to 100 to 200 mg three or four
times daily as needed. The maximum effective dose of sulfinpyrazone is 800
mg/day.

• Advise the patient to maintain a daily urine output >2 L to avoid precipitation
of uric acid stones. To decrease this risk, alkalinizing agents (potassium
citrate) may be added. Potassium citrate can be used at 10 mEq PO tid. for
target urinary citrate >320 mg/day, and urinary pH 6 to 7.

• Less potent uricosuric agents include the angiotensin 1 receptor antagonist
losartan, and the lipid lowering agents atorvastatin and fenofibrate.
Other Urate Lowering Drugs

• Pegloticase is a new recombinant porcine PEGylated uricase developed for
the treatment of refractory gout.
Uricase (urate oxidase) is the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of urate to a
more soluble purine degradation product, allantoin. Uricase is present in
most mammals but is absent in humans. Uricase is indicated as an
alternative to xanthine oxidase inhibitors or uricosuric agents in gout patients
intolerant of standard therapy.
226

Pegloticase is given as intravenous infusions at a dose of 8 mg every 2
weeks.9 Gout flare prophylaxis is recommended at least 1 week prior to
infusion and continuing for 6 months after the infusion. Side effects may
include infusion reactions, development of low titer anti-PEG uricase
antibodies, acute gout flares, nausea, and vomiting.
Pegloticase is contraindicated in glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency due to the risk of hemolysis and methemoglobinemia.

• Brief courses of non-PEGylated recombinant uricase (rasburicase) have
been used for the prevention of acute uric acid nephropathy due to tumor lysis
syndrome in patients with high risk lymphoma and leukemia. Severe
hypersensitivity reactions have been reported. Experience with this agent for
the treatment of gout is limited largely by the expectation that this unmodified
foreign protein is likely to be more immunogenic than PEGylated uricases over
the longer term of treatment needed for achieving the aims of gout
management.10
OTHER NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL THERAPIES

• After the initial attack, educate the patient about weight loss and decreasing
alcohol intake. In addition, reevaluate the patient’s drug regimen.

• For example, if the patient is being treated with niacin for
hypercholesterolemia or diuretics (especially thiazides) for hypertension,
consider substitute medications.

Calcium Pyrophosphate Dihydrate Crystal Deposition
Disease
Amy Archer and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) crystal deposition disease is
characterized by an inflammatory reaction to CPPD crystals in connective
tissues.

• CPPD can affect ligaments, tendons, articular cartilage, and the synovium.
• It can have a clinical presentation that mimics other rheumatologic diseases
such as gout, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and osteoarthritis (OA).
Classification

• Asymptomatic
• Acute CPPD
“Pseudogout”

• Chronic CPPD
“Pseudo-osteoarthritis”
“Pseudo-rheumatoid”
“Pseudo-neuropathic”
Spinal involvement
Extra-articular
Epidemiology

• CPPD is primarily a disease of the elderly.
Radiographic evidence of CPPD deposition increases with age, reaching
229

approximately 17% by age 80.
There is no predominance among a certain sex although subclassifications
may have predilection toward females or males as noted below.
Etiology

• The majority of cases of CPPD are idiopathic.
• The occurrence of early onset CPPD is often related to the presence of risk
factors or associated conditions.
Pathophysiology

• The pathologic formation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals is believed to be
secondary to high levels of calcium or inorganic pyrophosphate, which can
precipitate to form crystals in a conducive microenvironment.

• The primary components involved in crystal formation are chondrocytes,
matrix, and, articular cartilage vesicles (ACVs).

• The crystal formation can be modulated by several factors including
transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β), retinoic acid, nitric oxide, thyroid
hormone, transglutaminase, and interleukin (IL)-1.
Risk Factors

• The largest risk factor for CPPD is age.
• Joint trauma and/or surgery have also been associated with an increased risk
of developing CPPD.

• Familial CPPD has been linked to mutations in ankylosis, progressive homolog
(mouse) (ANKH), which has been identified as a pyrophosphate transporter.
Prevention
It has been hypothesized that an increase in dietary calcium could help in the
prevention of CPPD.1
Associated Conditions
230

• Hereditary hemochromatosis, hyperparathyroidism, hypomagnesaemia, and
OA have been shown to be associated with CPPD. In addition, Gitelman’s or
Bartter’s syndromes that cause hypomagnesaemia are also associated with
CPPD.2

• Pseudogout has been reported to be associated with bisphosphonates, joint
injections of hyaluronate, and parathyroidectomy.3–5
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Asymptomatic CPPD

• Identified when calcium pyrophosphate crystals are seen incidentally in
cartilage on radiographs.

• This finding is termed chondrocalcinosis.
Acute CPPD/Pseudogout

• Acute CPPD is more common in men.
• Attacks may be precipitated by severe illness, trauma, or surgery.
• It manifests as severe, sudden-onset mono- or oligoarthritis with erythema,
swelling, and pain.

• Acute attacks can involve any joint but most frequently affects the knee
(50% of cases). Subacute attacks can involve more than one joint.

• Acute CPPD can be associated with fever, leukocytosis, and an increased
erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Chronic CPPD

• “Pseudo-osteoarthritis” or “pseudo-OA”
Pseudo-OA is more common in women.
It can present as a slowly progressive joint pain that may affect multiple
joints.
The patient’s chronic disease course may be punctuated by acute attacks
similar to gout.
231

There is involvement of joints that are not typically associated with OA
(e.g., wrists, shoulders, and ankles).

• “Pseudorheumatoid” arthritis
“Pseudorheumatoid” arthritis occurs in less than 5% of patients with CPPD.
Patients will typically present with symmetric joint involvement and
prominent systemic complaints (e.g., morning stiffness and fatigue).
TABLE 14-1 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR CALCIUM
PYROPHOSPHATE DIHYDRATE DEPOSITION DISEASE
(PSEUDOGOUT)

Patients’ joints will exhibit synovial thickening, local edema, flexion
contractures, and decreased range of motion.

• “Pseudoneuropathic arthritis”
Reports describe patients that will present with a severe destructive and
painful monoarthritis, which is not associated with neurological
abnormalities

• Spinal involvement
The presentation may mimic polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).6
Cervical spine involvement is more unusual than the lumbar spine but is
believed to be an under-recognized etiology of acute neck pain.7
Cases of cervical cord compression secondary to CPPD have been reported,
232

particularly in older women.

• Extra-articular CPPD
The eye and the spleen have been reported as extra-articular manifestations.
Diagnostic Criteria
Diagnostic criteria for CPPD are presented in Table 14-1.8
Differential Diagnosis

• Infection, RA, OA, neuropathic joint disease, trauma, other crystal-associated
diseases (e.g., gout, basic calcium phosphate crystal deposition), and
malignancy should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting.

• It is important to realize that CPPD is not mutually exclusive to the alternative
diagnoses stated above.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Screening for the metabolic diseases mentioned above may be appropriate after
CPPD diagnosis, particularly in young patients or patients with severe arthritis.

• Check calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, alkaline phosphatase, ferritin, iron,
total iron-binding capacity, and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels.
Imaging
Plain Radiographs

• Chondrocalcinosis
Chondrocalcinosis represents the accumulation of calcium salt in
cartilaginous tissue, but can be found in the articular or periarticular regions.
It can be visualized in the absence of an arthropathy.
It is classically seen on radiographs in fibrocartilage (knee menisci,
triangular ligament of the wrist, symphysis pubis, glenohumeral joint) but
may be seen in hyaline and articular cartilage, as well as joint capsules and
tendon insertion sites (Achilles, quadriceps).
Fibrocartilage calcification appears as shaggy and irregular radiodense
233

areas that are typically in the center of the joint. Hyaline cartilage
calcifications are represented as a parallel thin line in close proximity to the
subchondral bone. Synovial calcification usually appears as an amorphous
opacity in the joint margin. Tendon calcifications are thin and linear.

• Structural Joint Changes
CPPD can be associated with subchondral sclerosis, subchondral cyst
formation, and joint space narrowing. Although the findings are also seen
in osteoarthritis, the location may help differentiate the two diseases.
Unlike RA, CPPD does not have typical bony erosions.
Ultrasound

• There is increasing utilization of ultrasound to differentiate between CPPD and
gout.

• Calcium pyrophosphate crystals can appear as a thin hyperechoic band parallel
to the hyaline cartilage, a punctate collection of hyperechoic spots in fibrous
cartilage and tendons, or a nodular or oval shape of the hyperechoic densities
that are often mobile in the bursa or articular recesses.

• Initial studies suggest a sensitivity and specificity as high as 86.7% and 96.4%
respectively.9
Alternative Imaging

• Calcifications can be visualized on CT but it is not typically utilized in the
assessment of an arthropathy. However, it is the preferred method of
identifying calcium deposits in the upper cervical spine and craniovertebral
junction.

• Although MRI is often utilized to evaluate a painful joint, it can be difficult to
visualize the calcifications.
Diagnostic Procedures
Arthrocentesis

• In an acute attack, the typical synovial leukocytes count is 15,000–30,000
cells/mm3, with a neutrophilic predominance.

234

• CPPD crystals show positive birefringence that may vary in intensity (weak to
none). They are smaller than urate crystals, frequently intracellular, vary in
shape from needle to rhomboid (monoclinic or triclinic crystal structure) and
are usually more difficult to find. In addition, they can appear in the presence
of urate crystals.

• CPPD crystals can be visualized from joints aspirated between acute attacks.
• Even if crystals are seen, it is important to send synovial fluid for culture to
rule out coincident infection.
Paraffin Embedded Tissue

• CPPD crystals classically appear as amorphous basophilic to amphophilic
material that can be surrounded by foreign body giant cell reaction.

• Nonaqueous alcoholic eosin staining allows for the observation of positive
birefringence that may not be present on routine hematoxylin and eosin stain
slides.
TREATMENT

• Therapeutics are targeted at controlling symptoms.
• The basis for the majority of the treatment options are based on case reports
and expert opinion.
Medications
Acute Symptomatic Treatment

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are frequently utilized if they
are tolerated and renal function is normal.

• Oral or intra-articular corticosteroids are sometimes needed for severe cases
but should be held until infection is ruled out.
Recurrent/Chronic Symptom Treatment

• Colchicine (0.6 mg qd or bid) may decrease the frequency of attacks.
• Methotrexate (5–20 mg/week) and hydroxychloroquine may be considered in
resistant cases.10,11
235

• Anakinra, an IL-1 inhibitor, is a novel therapy that may also be utilized in
refractory cases at the dosage of 100 mg subcutaneously per day, or three times
a week with hemodialysis treatment.12
Other Non-pharmacologic Therapies

• Joint aspiration usually provides some pain relief in acute cases.
• Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation has been reported
to improve symptoms in some patients with general inflammatory joint pain.13
Surgical Management
In the cases of spinal CPPD disease that are complicated compressive cervical
myelopathy, surgical decompression is performed.

Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis
Kristine A. Kuhn and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• A group of clinically related disorders were previously known as the
seronegative spondyloarthropathies, reflecting the absence of rheumatoid
factor and primary involvement of the axial skeleton (spondylopathy) with less
prominent involvement of the peripheral joints. These disorders can be
contrasted with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) which is typically rheumatoid factor
(RF) positive with prominent involvement of the peripheral joints and rare
involvement of the axial skeleton. These diseases have recently been renamed
spondyloarthritides (SpAs) to reflect the inflammatory nature of the disease.1

• SpAs are often associated with HLA-B27.
• There are five types of SpA: ankylosing spondyloarthritis (AS), psoriatic
arthritis (PsA), reactive arthritis (ReA), enteropathic arthritis, and
undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (USpA). This chapter focuses on USpA; the
other types of SpA are discussed in the following chapters.
Definition
Patients with SpA who do not meet the criteria for AS, PsA, ReA, or enteropathic
arthritis but meet criteria for SpA (see below) are considered to have USpA.
Classification

• Common features among the classification criteria for SpA include:
Age of onset <45 years old.
Inflammatory back pain present >3 months, defined as insidious onset,
improves with exercise (but not rest), and morning stiffness. Sacroiliitis may
be a component.
Peripheral arthritis, usually asymmetric and involving the lower extremities.
Enthesopathy, which is inflammation of tendon and ligament insertions into
238

bone. This may result in dactylitis, or a “sausage-digit.”
Family history of SpA.
History of associated diseases such as psoriasis, inflammatory bowel
disease, or urethritis, cervicitis, or diarrhea within one month before the
onset of arthritis, which would classify the SpA as PsA, enteropathic
arthritis, or ReA, respectively.

• Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS, Table 15-1)1
have improved sensitivity and specificity over previous criteria sets,
particularly for early disease. Separate criteria exist for axial and peripheral
SpA.1,2
TABLE 15-1 ASAS CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR AXIAL AND
PERIPHERAL SPONDYLOARTHRITIS

Epidemiology

• Of the subtypes of SpA, AS is the most prevalent followed by USpA.
239

• The prevalence of HLA-B27 within patient populations with SpA ranges 50%
to 95%.

• SpAs occur in about 2% of the general population and in just over 10% of
HLA-B27 positive individuals.

• The frequency of HLA-B27 in the general Western European population is
about 10%, but the rate fluctuates based on the population studied.
Etiology

• At present, the etiology of SpA is not known but several observations suggest it
likely results from a combination of genetic risk factors and an environmental
trigger.
The most studied genetic risk factor for SpA is HLA-B27. HLA-B27
positivity carries a 20-fold increased risk for SpA but only explains about
one-third of the genetic risk for disease.
Other genes associated with USpA include the genes for chemokine receptor
type 4 (CXCR4), interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-8, and integrin-1. Other genes are
being identified and risk assessed in genome-wide association scans.

• Specific environmental triggers have not been identified, but SpA is associated
with prior enteropathic illnesses (reactive SpA) and IBD, suggesting possible
links to gastrointestinal (GI) flora. Moreover, animal models that have
suggested enterobacterial infections may elicit disease in a favorable genetic
setting.
Pathophysiology

• Two major observations support the concept that SpAs are immune-mediated
diseases.

• SpAs associated with HLA-B27 possibly result from the presentation of
“arithrogenic” peptides to T cells. Alternatively, enterobacterial antigens
may carry sequence homology with HLA-B27 subtypes, suggesting that HLAB27 itself may be recognized.
Either possibility is supported by animal studies: Mice transgenic for HLAB27 can develop enthesopathy and ankylosis similar to human AS; however,
in germ-free environments, these mice do not develop disease.

• Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α appears central to the pathology of SpA
240

because TNF blockade ameliorates disease activity of most forms of SpA.
TNF may act through several mechanisms because it:
Stimulates production of adhesion molecules and recruitment of inflammatory
cells.
Activates T cells and production of other inflammatory cytokines.
Induces expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and matrix
metalloproteinases that lead to angiogenesis and bone erosions.
Stimulates production of receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand
(RANKL) resulting in osteoclast maturation.
DIAGNOSIS

• Diagnosis of SpA relies upon clinical presentation and imaging.
• Classification criteria (Table 15-1) provide a guide to the diagnosis of SpA but
it should be emphasized that they were developed for purposes of unifying
clinical studies. They may be less helpful in an individual patient, particularly
when seen just once early in the disease.
Clinical Presentation

• Clinical manifestations include inflammatory back pain, sacroiliitis,
peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, and anterior uveitis. Cardiovascular
involvement is a relatively rare, late manifestation.

• The majority of patients present before the age of 45.
• The highest likelihood ratios for disease include inflammatory back pain lasting
longer than 3 months, positive MRI findings, and positive HLA-B27 status.
History

• A thorough history will elicit symptoms of inflammatory back pain such as
morning stiffness, improvement of pain with activity and worsening with rest,
and insidious onset. Alternating buttock pain may be present.

• Additional articular symptoms include:
Peripheral, asymmetric inflammatory arthritis, usually in the lower limbs
and usually oligoarticular.
Enthesitis, which can lead to dactylitis, plantar fasciitis, and Achilles’
241

tendinitis.

• Extra-articular symptoms may identify the type of SpA:
Psoriasis (PsA).
Symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or infectious diarrhea
(enteropathic arthritis or ReA, respectively).
Urethritis or cervicitis (ReA), often asymptomatic in women.
Uveitis typically causing eye pain with exposure to bright lights.

• A family history of SpA or related disease such as psoriasis or inflammatory
bowel disease may suggest SpA.
Physical Examination

• The musculoskeletal examination can be divided into the axial skeleton and
peripheral joints.
Within the axial skeleton, early findings are reduced lateral spinal flexion,
chest expansion, and cervical rotation. Restriction of spinal mobility and
kyphosis are more advanced findings.
Peripheral joint findings include swelling, effusions, erythema, reduced
range of motion, and dactylitis.

• The skin should be thoroughly assessed for evidence of psoriasis, including
small patches in the umbilicus or gluteal fold. Dermatology referral and skin
biopsy may need to be considered.

• Referral to an ophthalmologist may be required for evaluation for uveitis.
Diagnostic Criteria

• Many refer to the classification criteria to aid in diagnosis of SpA.
• Strictly, a diagnosis of USpA is given when a patient meets the classification
criteria for SpA but not specific criteria for AS, PsA, ReA, or enteropathic
arthritis.
Differential Diagnosis

• Mechanical back pain is the most common cause of lower back pain.
Typically, its symptoms are acute onset, often with an inciting event, and pain
242

that is worse with exercise and relieved by rest. Contrast these symptoms with
the classical symptoms of SpA. Only 5% of patients seen in a primary care
setting with chronic low back pain are ultimately diagnosed with SpA.

• For inflammatory back pain, the differential diagnosis includes the five types of
SpA.

• Peripheral inflammatory arthritis may be infectious arthritis, seronegative RA,
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or undifferentiated connective tissue
disease (CTD).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• The serum acute phase reactants such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and C-reactive protein (CRP) are of limited use to follow disease activity as
they have poor sensitivity and specificity.

• HLA-B27 testing is included in the ASAS classification criteria. However,
given that SpA occurs in only approximately 10% of HLA-B27 individuals, the
positive predictive value for disease is relatively low. Thus, HLA-B27
testing is generally not clinically useful by itself.
Imaging

• Plain radiography of the sacroiliac joints is included in the classification
criteria for SpA.
Definite sacroiliitis can be difficult to evaluate and requires expertise.
When present it carries nearly 80% specificity.
However, structural damage appears late in disease.
Only 30% of patients with early disease have radiographic changes; thus, it
has a poor sensitivity in early disease.

• MRI has emerged as a valuable tool for the assessment of early SpA.
Bone marrow edema and fat infiltration on MRI are signs of inflammation
with about 60% sensitivity for early sacroiliitis.3
However, over 20% of patients with mechanical low back pain and healthy
individuals have inflammatory features on MRI as well.4
Further, not all patients with evidence of sacroiliitis on MRI will develop
radiographic evidence. The positive predictive value of MRI for the
243

development of sacroiliitis on radiographs several years later is less than
20%.
Therefore, the patient’s history and examination remain critical in interpreting
the results from MRI.
TREATMENT
Medications

• Pharmacologic treatment of SpA varies on the type. For USpA, treatment is
based on whether symptoms are predominantly axial, in which therapy will be
most similar to that for AS, or peripheral, in which therapy is similar to PsA.

• Most clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of medications for the treatment of
SpA have focused on either AS or PsA; little data exist to support specific
treatments for USpA.
Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

• First line treatment of SpA is nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
for either axial or peripheral disease.

• These agents decrease inflammation and control pain but do not alter the
underlying course of disease.

• Initially indomethacin was the preferred agent, but any NSAID can be effective.
• NSAIDs work quickly, with improvement in morning stiffness and pain within
48 hours. Conversely, stiffness and pain return quickly, within 48 hours, after
discontinuation of the NSAID.

• In the case of inefficacy, trial of an alternate NSAID is indicated before
changing class of agents.

• Use of NSAIDs is limited by side effects of GI intolerance and increased risk
of cardiovascular events.
Oral Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

• Oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) have limited efficacy
in axial SpA, although methotrexate, sulfasalazine, leflunomide, and
azathioprine have been used. There are conflicting data on the efficacy of
these agents.5
244

• Sulfasalazine and methotrexate are commonly used for the treatment of
peripheral SpAs; again the data regarding efficacy of these agents in USpA are
lacking.
TABLE 15-2 BATH ANKYLOSING SPONDYLITIS DISEASE ACTIVITY
INDEX (BASDAI)

Antitumor Necrosis Factor Agents

• Etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab have been demonstrated to be
effective in the treatment of SpA. Few patients with USpA have been evaluated
in trials utilizing these agents for SpA and thus the long-term efficacy is
unknown. Nevertheless, of the few patients evaluated, antitumor necrosis factor
(anti-TNF) agents have been demonstrated to improve in axial and peripheral
symptoms. However, they do not alter the potential for progression of
radiographic disease, as they do in RA.

• Anti-TNF agents have also been demonstrated to have good efficacy in
controlling extra-articular manifestations.

• International ASAS and US consensus guidelines for the use of anti-TNF agents
in AS suggest use of these agents when patients have severe disease (Bath
Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index score >4, see
245

Monitoring/Follow-Up and Table 15-2) and have failed NSAIDs. As a
significant number of patients with USpA progress to AS the same guidelines
are appropriate for use of anti-TNF agents in USpA.
Analgesics and Glucocorticoids

• Analgesic medications are often needed for pain control. Opiates carry high
risk of addiction in these patients with a chronic disease.

• Systemic glucocorticoids have historically been felt to be ineffective for the
treatment of SpA; however, intra-articular and systemic corticosteroids may
be useful in cases of peripheral joint involvement. They have minimal efficacy
in axial disease.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Physical therapy and exercise are mainstays for all SpAs.
• A combination of an exercise program with pharmacologic agents has been
shown to be more effective than pharmacologic treatment alone.

• Extension exercises are preferred.6
Surgical Management

• Surgical intervention may be required to treat late manifestations of axial
disease such as deformities, traumatic fractures, and radiculopathy.7
Corrective surgery for kyphosis of the lumbar spine and cervicothoracic
junction can improve field-of-vision, swallowing function, gait stability,
axial pain, and radiculopathy symptoms.
Decompression surgery such as laminectomy is warranted in some cases of
symptomatic spinal stenosis and cauda equina syndrome.
Three column fractures are stabilized with instrumentation.

• Peripheral joint arthroplasty, fusion, or soft tissue release for contractures is
indicated when there is significant joint pain unresolved by medical treatment
or loss of function.
COMPLICATIONS

246

• Complications of SpA result from long-standing inflammation affecting the
target joint(s).
In the case of axial USpA, 30% to 60% of patients will ultimately develop
AS. As a result, these patients may develop ankylosis of the spine and major
joints (hips, shoulders) and decreased chest wall expansion, which may
cause restrictive lung disease.
Radiculopathies can also result from ankylosis of the spine.
Inflammatory arthritis and enthesitis of peripheral joints may lead to joint
erosions and/or ankylosis of the affected joint.

• Extra-articular manifestations may result in other complications.
Uveitis can lead to vision loss.
Late cardiac complications include aortic dilation, aortic and mitral
regurgitation, atrioventricular conduction blocks, and arrhythmias.
Restrictive lung disease may develop due to late stage stenosis of
costovertebral and costosternal joints in AS but typically not in other SpA.
Bilateral apical pulmonary fibrosis may develop
Renal amyloidosis may develop

• Pharmacologic treatments also have side effects that may lead to other
complications. See Chap. 9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic
Diseases for further discussion.
REFERRAL

• Patients with chronic back pain lasting longer than three months and one or
more of the following should be referred to a rheumatologist:
Inflammatory back pain.
HLA-B27 positivity.
Sacroiliitis on imaging.
Refractory peripheral arthritis.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Patients should be educated on the manifestations, complications, and
therapeutic options of their disease.
247

• Additionally the benefits of exercise and physical therapy for improving
functional status and limiting pain should be emphasized.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• As noted above, monitoring serum acute phase reactants is of limited value for
assessing disease activity.

• Rather, disease activity should be monitored based on clinical features of
morning stiffness, pain, physical examination, and imaging when indicated.
The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI, Table
15-2) was developed for assessment of symptoms for clinical trials;
however, it can serve as a guide for monitoring disease activity in a clinical
setting.8

• Monitoring for development of late cardiovascular, pulmonary and renal
complications is warranted.

• Monitoring of pharmacologic agents is discussed in Chapter 9.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Prospective studies over a duration of 10 years have shown that, in patients
classified as USpA, up to 40% will go into remission and 30–60% will meet
criteria for AS.

• The outcome and prognosis of AS is discussed in Chap. 16, Ankylosing
Spondylitis.

Ankylosing Spondylitis
Lesley Davila and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) belongs to a group of clinical disorders characterized
by prominent involvement of the axial skeleton, known as the spondyloarthritides
(SpAs).
Definition

• AS is an inflammatory arthritis causing back pain and progressive stiffness of
the spine.

• It involves the sacroiliac (SI) joints and the articular joints of the spine.
• Additionally, AS may be associated with peripheral arthritis of the knees, hips,
and shoulders as well as extra-articular manifestations involving the eyes,
heart, and lungs.

• AS may be difficult to distinguish from the other SpAs.
If the patient has psoriasis, a recent history of enteric or genitourinary
infection, or inflammatory bowel disease, the patient is considered to have
psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, or enteropathic arthritis, respectively,
rather than AS.
Some patients do not meet the classification criteria for AS (see below), in
which case they are considered to have undifferentiated spondyloarthritis.
These disorders are discussed separately in their respective chapters.
Epidemiology

• AS occurs with a male to female ratio of approximately 2 to 3:1. The age of
onset is most often <40 years, with peak incidence between the ages of 20 and
30. The prevalence of AS ranges from 0% to 1.4% with a wide variation noted
in different ethnic populations.
250

• HLA-B27 is well known to be associated with AS; the primary reason for
ethnic variation relates to the expression of HLA-B27.
In the United States, HLA-B27 is more common in whites of Northern
European descent and less common in blacks.
In white males, 80% to 95% of AS patients express HLA-B27.
The prevalence of AS in HLA-B27-positive individuals is estimated to be
10% to 20%.
Like all of the seronegative spondyloarthropathies, AS has a strong familial
aggregation; however, HLA-B27 confers only about 30% of the genetic risk,
suggesting other genes may also predispose to AS.
Pathophysiology

• The etiology of AS is unknown. However, the strong association with HLAB27 suggests an immune-dependent component. Other evidence, particularly
response to therapy with antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents, supports
a role for inflammatory cytokines in disease pathogenesis. Chapter 15,
Undifferentiated Spondyloarthritis discusses this in more detail.

• Pathologically the differentiating feature of AS from rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
is its predominant involvement of the entheses (where ligaments, tendons, and
joint capsules attach to bone) instead of the synovium. Histologically, synovitis
and enthesitis in AS are difficult to distinguish from that of RA.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The key to diagnosing AS is having a high index of suspicion in young to
middle-aged patients who complain of inflammatory-type back pain.

• Direct further history and physical examination at pursuing this diagnosis.
• Family history of similar complaints or rheumatologic diseases is important.
History

• Patients typically complain of low back pain and stiffness. The pain is
inflammatory in nature (e.g., insidious onset without trauma, exacerbation of
pain with rest, and improvement with activity). The pain may wake the patient
251

at night. A warm shower, exercise, and antiinflammatory drugs usually provide
some relief.

• Sacroiliitis, a common initial feature, can present with pain in the buttock,
typically alternating sides, and radiating down the thigh posteriorly.

• Occasionally uveitis, enthesitis, or oligoarticular arthritis may be the
presenting symptom.

• Symptoms progress gradually over a period of months to years and, over time,
may lead to significant spinal deformities and loss of range of motion of the
neck and/or lower back.
Physical Examination

• Significant morbidity and physical disability result from flattening of the
lumbar lordosis, kyphosis of the thoracic spine, flexion of the cervical spine,
and flexion contractures in the pelvis and knee joints.

• The physical examination should include evaluation of range of motion of the
spine.
One measure is the modified Schober’s test: Make marks 10 cm above and 5
cm below the level of the sacral dimples (approximately L5). Next, have the
patient maximally reach for the floor without bending his or her knees. The
distance between these two marks should increase from 15 cm to ≥20 cm if
normal spinal motion is present.
Evaluate lateral rotation and lateral flexion of the spine in both directions
as well. Lateral rotation can be measured by the examiner standing behind
the patient and placing examiner’s hands on the patient’s iliac crest then
having the patient laterally rotate the shoulders. The plane of the shoulders
should normally reach a 45-degree angle with respect to the plane of the
pelvis. For lateral flexion, ask the patient to stand upright and laterally flex
to the floor. The distance from fingertip of the middle finger to the floor can
be measured and followed.
The occiput to wall distance can be measured by having the patient stand
with both heels and buttocks against the wall, and measuring the gap between
the occiput and the wall. The normal distance is zero, and increasing
distance indicates loss of lumbar and cervical lordosis.
Evaluate chest expansion by measuring the circumference of the chest at the
level of T4 at the end of both maximal inspiration and maximal expiration.
Expansion should be >2.5 cm.
252

• Clinical examination for sacroiliitis is variable and generally does not
contribute to the diagnosis.

• Extra-articular manifestations of AS include anterior uveitis, increased risk
of fracture of the fused spine, C1–2 subluxation, and restrictive lung disease
(mostly from stiffness of the chest wall, but these patients can also develop
pulmonary fibrosis). Less common manifestations include cardiac
abnormalities (including conduction abnormalities, myocardial dysfunction, or
aortitis leading to aortic regurgitation), renal disease from nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or amyloid deposition, and bowel mucosa
ulcerations.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The New York criteria for AS, last revised in 1984, are commonly used to
diagnose AS.1 The criteria rely on both clinical and radiologic components.
The clinical criteria consist of the following three components:
Low back pain and stiffness of >3 months duration, improving with
exercise but not relieved with rest.
Limitation of motion of the lumbar spine in both the sagittal and frontal
planes.
Limitation of chest expansion relative to normal values corrected for age
and gender.
The radiographic criteria consist of the following two components:
Sacroiliitis with more than minimum abnormality bilaterally.
Sacroiliitis of unequivocal abnormality unilaterally.
A patient is designated as having definite AS if at least one radiologic
criterion and one clinical criterion are present. A patient is designated as
having probable AS if three clinical criteria are present or if one of the
radiologic criteria is present without any signs or symptoms of the clinical
criteria.
In practice, these criteria are highly specific for AS, but they lack sensitivity
to serve as a reliable screening tool. Therefore, AS is likely to be
underdiagnosed if these criteria are strictly followed. Furthermore, these
criteria fail to address the presence of familial associations, HLA-B27, or
extra-articular manifestations of AS.
253

• The Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS)
classification criteria for axial spondyloarthritis are useful for diagnosing
early AS and are described in Table 15-1.2
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of AS includes noninflammatory causes of low back pain,
other seronegative spondyloarthropathies (see Chapter 15, Undifferentiated
Spondyloarthritis), other peripheral inflammatory arthritides, and diffuse idiopathic
skeletal hyperostosis (DISH).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Most laboratory tests for AS are nonspecific. Indicators of inflammation (e.g.,
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] or C-reactive protein [CRP])
support the diagnosis but may not correlate with disease severity.

• Measurement of HLA-B27 may support the diagnosis and provide evidence of
heritability, but in clinical practice it is only useful for ruling out the diagnosis
if absent in white males.
Imaging

• Radiographs play an important role in the diagnosis of AS.
Anterior–posterior radiographs of the SI joints and other affected joints,
including the spine or peripheral joints, are usually adequate and should be
performed initially.
The modified Ferguson view of the SI joints may be useful (a posterior–
anterior radiograph taken of the SI joints with the patient in the prone
position and the x-ray tube angled 30 degrees obliquely).
Standardization of scoring systems for sacroiliitis has increased the
reliability of x-rays for diagnosis. However, radiographs are less sensitive
in early disease.

• MRI has a higher sensitivity and specificity for sacroiliitis, but is limited by
cost. If the clinical suspicion for AS is high and plain radiographs are negative
or unequivocal for sacroiliitis, an MRI of the SI joints is recommended.
CT is also sensitive for detection of sacroiliitis while offering the same
254

degree of specificity. However, it does involve more radiation than MRI so
it should probably be reserved for patients unable to undergo an MRI.

• Sacroiliitis in AS is typically bilateral and symmetric, as is the sacroiliitis
associated with inflammatory bowel disease. By contrast, sacroiliitis in
psoriatic and reactive arthritis is often asymmetric.

• In severe AS, radiographs of the spine may demonstrate ankylosis of the spine
w i th syndesmophytes (osseous formations that attach to ligaments) and a
“bamboo spine” appearance. Spinal involvement in AS is typically ascending
without “skip” areas whereas discontinuous spinal involvement is more typical
of psoriatic and reactive arthritis.

• MRI of the spine can provide an image of the amount of inflammation in the
spine. Specialized techniques, such as STIR and T1 images obtained after
contrast administration can detect inflammation with a high degree of
specificity. Abnormalities on MRI include vertebral corner erosions and bone
marrow edema. It is unclear if areas of inflammation on MRI correlate to
ankylosis of the spine over time.
TREATMENT

• Treatment of AS is focused on providing symptomatic relief and returning the
patient to best functional capacity, as well as preventing (as much as possible)
the long-term consequences such as spinal fusion, peripheral joint destruction,
and extra-articular manifestations.

• Combinations of medications, stretching, physical therapy, and/or surgical
management are tailored to the individual patient to achieve these goals.
Medications
Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

• The first-line therapy for patients with AS is NSAIDs to limit symptoms of
inflammatory arthritis and back pain.

• Classically, AS is treated with either indomethacin or naproxen but patient
satisfaction should ultimately dictate which NSAID works best.

• Maximum doses of NSAIDs are generally required.
• Monitor NSAID-associated toxicities closely (see Chapter 9, Drugs Used in the
255

Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases).

• One study showed a decrease in radiographic progression of spinal disease
with the continuous use of NSAIDs, although these results have yet to be
replicated.3
Oral Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

• Peripheral joint symptoms have been successfully treated with escalating doses
of sulfasalazine.
Sulfasalazine is initiated at a dose of 500 mg PO bid and is increased until a
daily dose of 3 g is reached or toxicities prevent escalation.
At maximum tolerated doses, sulfasalazine has been shown to improve
peripheral joint symptoms but has limited effects on axial symptoms.
Discontinue sulfasalazine if no response has been attained by 4 months or if
severe toxicities occur.
Monitor patients periodically (at least every 3 months) for leukopenia and
neutropenia.

• Traditional disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) for RA such as
o r a l methotrexate and leflunomide have been used for peripheral joint
symptoms associated with AS.
Methotrexate has conflicting data regarding its efficacy and is not used
frequently.
Leflunomide also has not been shown to be effective in treatment of AS.
Antitumor Necrosis Factor Agents and Other Biologics

• Recent studies have demonstrated significant symptomatic improvement with
the use of antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents in AS. Specifically,
the anti-TNF agents infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab are
approved by the FDA for AS and have been shown to significantly limit
disease activity and signs of inflammation in early AS.
These are the only agents that significantly improve the axial symptoms
(inflammatory back pain and morning stiffness).
They are commonly used as first line DMARD therapy for patients who do
not respond to NSAIDs alone.
Although they significantly improve quality of life, the anti-TNF agents have
not been shown to prevent or slow down spinal fusion although research in
256

this area is ongoing.4

• Recent data have shown that rituximab may be efficacious in reducing disease
activity in TNF-inhibitor naive patients, but not in those previously exposed to
anti-TNF agents.5 Randomized control studies have not yet been published.

• Pamidronate (an IV bisphosphonate) has also been studied in patients with AS
and in a small study has shown to decrease disease activity in a dosedependent fashion.6
Analgesics and Glucocorticoids

• Systemic corticosteroids are not routinely used in treatment of AS, unlike other
inflammatory rheumatic disorders. However, local injections of steroids may
provide symptomatic relief to patients with otherwise poorly controlled joint
pain. Either blind injections of SI joints or radiographically guided injections
can be used.

• Analgesics such as opiates are commonly needed to alleviate the pain caused
by damaged joints and spinal fusion that occurs with prolonged disease.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• All patients diagnosed with AS should be referred for physical therapy to
initiate treatment with range of motion exercises and postural training.
Physical therapy can limit pain and improve functional status in most patients
with AS.
Patients should be taught motion and flexibility exercises of the cervical,
thoracic, and lumbar spine; stretching exercises for shortened muscles; and
chest expansion exercises. Patients should be instructed to perform these
exercises regularly at home.

• Smoking cessation should be encouraged in all patients with AS, as smoking is
a predictor of worse outcome.
Surgical Management

• Surgery may be beneficial for AS patients with significant morbidity from
skeletal deformities.
Total hip arthroplasty can improve pain and decreased mobility resulting
from damaged hip joints. This surgery may be performed at a younger age
257

(40–60 years) than in osteoarthritis patients to improve mobility and quality
of life in patients with AS.
Spinal fusion can be considered in patients with unstable vertebral
articulations (including atlanto-axial subluxation).
Wedge osteotomies can be performed for patients with severe flexion
deformities, restoring their ability to look forward.

• Anesthesiologists should be made aware of the AS diagnosis in an AS patient
undergoing general anesthesia because intubation may be difficult.
COMPLICATIONS
Complications of AS are identical to those discussed in Chapter 15, Undifferentiated
Spondyloarthritis.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Patients should be followed for development of worsened symptoms, physical
deformity, and late complications (cardiovascular, pulmonary and medication
related complications).

• Two functional indexes shown to be sensitive in detecting improvement or
deterioration in clinical disease include the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
Functional Index and the Dougados Functional Index.7 While initially designed
for assessment of symptoms in clinical trials, they can be used to monitor
disease activity in a clinical setting.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• AS has not been associated with an increase in mortality but can produce
significant morbidity if not recognized and treated appropriately.

• AS may progress to fusion of the entire axial skeleton at which point pain from
spondyloarthritis itself frequently subsides. A complication of spinal fusion is
pseudoarthrosis where a false “joint” is formed, frequently as a result of
minor trauma. Clinical clues to pseudoarthrosis are increased local pain and
enhanced spinal mobility. Surgical referral is immediately recommended
because of possible spinal cord encroachment.

• Most patients with AS have mild to moderately severe disease, usually
258

characterized by a chronic relapsing and remitting course.
Severe AS occurs less commonly but produces significant morbidity related
to axial skeletal fusion.
One study has correlated seven prognostic factors with more severe
disease.8 The presence of hip arthritis was the most prognostic of a severe
outcome. The other factors included ESR >30 mm/hour, dactylitis,
oligoarthritis, decreased range of motion of the lumbar spine, limited
efficacy of NSAIDs, and onset before age 16.

Psoriatic Arthritis
Amy Archer and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that is associated with
psoriasis. It is one of the five types of spondyloarthropathies (SpA).

• The disease can range from asymptomatic to severely debilitating.
Classification

• PsA can be classified on the basis of the pattern of arthritis (numbers in
parentheses represent relative occurrence of each pattern).
Asymmetric oligoarthritis: Maximum of five joints affected in an
asymmetric distribution (30%–50%).
Symmetric polyarthritis: Involvement of multiple joints in a symmetric
pattern (30%–50%).
Spondyloarthropathy: Includes sacroiliitis and spondylitis (5%–30%). This
form may be difficult to distinguish from the other spondyloarthritides,
especially reactive arthritis, which can also cause asymmetric sacroiliitis
and discontinuous spondylitis.
Distal arthritis: Involves the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joints (10%).
Arthritis mutilans: Severe destructive arthritis leading to significant joint
deformities (rare).
Some patients will have more than one pattern of arthritis.
Epidemiology

• Consistent with the age of onset of SpA, PsA has a mean age of onset between
35 and 45 years.

261

• The overall prevalence of PsA in the United States is 0.25% and among
patients with psoriasis is 11%. The prevalence appears to be increasing.
Pathophysiology

• As a member of the family of SpA, genetic, immunologic, and environmental
factors are believed to have important roles in the development of the disease.
PsA has a familial association and has been linked to several human major
histocompatibility complex (HLA) class I and II loci.
Like the other spondyloarthritides, PsA is associated with HLA-B27.
However, the association is primarily with the spondyloarthropathy form
of PsA.
The immune system appears to play an active role in the pathogenesis of the
disease.
There is an accumulation of immune cells at sites of disease as well as the
production inflammatory cytokines. T cells and monocytes have a central
role in this process.1
Treatments aimed at blocking tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have improved
symptomatic disease activity, implicating TNF in disease pathogenesis, but
do not alter the radiographic progression of disease.
Bacterial infections, viral infections, and localized trauma have all been
implicated in contributing to the disease.
Associated Conditions
PsA, like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and other chronic inflammatory arthritides, is
associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease.2
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• Typical of SpA, patients with PsA classically present with inflammatory
arthritis (symptoms of pain and stiffness in affected joints that is worsened
with immobility and improved with activity and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs [NSAIDs]). The pattern of arthritis can be variable as mentioned above.
262

• Most patients already have psoriasis when arthritis develops; however, a
small percentage of patients develop arthritis before manifestations in the skin
appear. Hence, it is important to search thoroughly for psoriatic skin lesions in
a patient with rheumatic symptoms reminiscent of PsA, even if the patient does
not complain of a rash. For example, the skin lesions may be present only in the
gluteal fold or the periumbilical area.

• The severity and activity of skin and arthritic disease are independent of each
other.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination should evaluate for musculoskeletal system,
integumentary system, and ocular manifestations of disease.

• Musculoskeletal:
Joint pain and effusions are identified in one of the five distribution patterns
noted above.
Enthesitis can be present and is typically manifested as pain in the heel
and/or sole of the foot.
Dactylitis can be identified as inflammation at tendon insertions, along the
tendon sheaths and in the joint spaces of the fingers and toes. It commonly
causes the appearance of “sausage digits.”

• Integumentary:
The skin changes of psoriasis include salmon-colored hyperkeratotic scaling
plaques commonly located on extensor surfaces. However, occult psoriasis
can be present in the external auditory canal, umbilicus, intergluteal cleft,
and axilla.
Typical nail changes include pitting, onycholysis, leukonychia, nail plate
crumbling, oil-drop discoloration, nail bed hyperkeratosis, splinter
hemorrhages, and red spots in the lunula.
TABLE 17-1 CLASSIFICATION OF PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS (CASPAR)
CRITERIA

263

Onycholysis is commonly mistaken for onychomycosis; therefore, it is
important to examine nail scrapings for fungal elements and culture. Nail
changes can occur in up to 90% of patients with PsA.

• Ocular:
As in other SpA, ocular inflammation may be present.
Diagnostic Criteria
Although the Amor criteria for spondyloarthropathy and European
Spondyloarthropathy Study Group have provided diagnostic criteria for the broad

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• As with SpA in general, laboratory tests are not routinely useful in the
diagnosis of PsA.
264

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are
variably elevated and nonspecific.

• Anemia associated with chronic inflammation can occur but is also not
specific.

• PsA usually occurs in the absence of rheumatoid factor (RF) or antinuclear
antibodies (ANA), but these tests may be positive in a small percentage of
cases.

• Anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) antibody can be present in patients
with PsA and tends to be associated with a greater number of involved joints,
with deformities and functional impairment of peripheral joints and with
radiographic changes.4
Imaging

• Joint radiographs: Classic findings include erosive changes and new bone
growth in the distal joints, “pencil-in-cup” erosion, lysis of terminal phalanges,
periostitis, and new bone growth at sites of enthesitis.

• MRI: As discussed in Chapter 15, MRI may be useful to identify early signs of
disease: subclinical enthesitis, arthritis, and periarthritis. However, cost can
preclude its routine use in diagnosis.
TREATMENT

• The goals of treatment are to provide symptomatic relief of arthritis and skin
disease and limit disease progression. The choice of agent depends on the
severity/presentation of disease. For more aggressive disease or refractory
symptoms steroid-sparing anti-rheumatic drugs are utilized.

• Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and PsA (GRAPPA)
treatment guidelines suggest the approach for selected manifestations of PsA
presented in Table 17-2.5

• Composite measures are being developed by GRAPPA to assess disease
activity in PsA, similar to the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity
Index (BASDAI) for ankylosing spondylitis in Table 15-2.6
Medications
Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs
265

• Symptomatic joint relief can often be attained with the use of NSAIDS or
selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors if the patient is at risk for
gastrointestinal toxicities.

• NSAIDs are not beneficial for skin manifestations.
Intra-Articular Corticosteroids
Intra-articular injections of steroids may also provide symptomatic relief, but are
contraindicated if psoriatic skin lesions overlie access to joint spaces due to risk of
intra-articular seeding with Gram-positive bacteria.
Disease-Modifying Anti-Rheumatic Drugs

• Sulfasalazine has been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of peripheral
PsA.

• Methotrexate
Can be an effective treatment option for peripheral PsA.
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines for monitoring liver
toxicity in RA are often followed with patients who have PsA.
Obtain baseline aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine
aminotransferase (ALT), albumin, bilirubin, hepatitis serologies, complete
blood count (CBC), and creatinine.
Baseline liver biopsy should be considered in patients with a history of
previous or current excessive alcohol consumption, persistently elevated
AST or chronic hepatitis infection.
TABLE 17-2 GROUP FOR RESEARCH AND ASSESSMENT OF
PSORIASIS AND PSA (GRAPPA) TREATMENT GUIDELINES

266

Every 4 to 8 weeks AST, ALT, and albumin should be monitored and only
if there is an increase in AST/ALT or a decrease in albumin should biopsy
be considered.
Folic acid should be administered concomitantly with methotrexate.

• Azathioprine may be effective in the treatment of PsA.
Biologic Agents
TNF Inhibitors

• TNF inhibitors are considered for use in patients who have failed to respond to
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy, and may also be
considered first line in patients with poor prognosis.

• Failure to respond is defined as a lack of improvement after treatment for more
than three months, of which two months need to be at the standard target dose.

• Etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab are equally effective in both
treatment and stopping disease progression. Moreover, it may be possible to
267

tailor therapy within this class of medications as data suggests that etanercept
may be better for articular disease whereas adalimumab and infliximab
may be more effective for cutaneous disease.5,7,8

• Appropriate dosing can depend on the predominant symptom that is being
treated, with twice-weekly dosing sometimes needed for refractory skin
disease.9

• The use of TNF-blockers in RA patients highlights the concern for higher rates
of malignancy and serious infection as well as the need for further long-term
studies.

• All patients should be tested for tuberculosis prior to the initiation of anti-TNF
therapy.
T-cell Modulators
Whe n alefacept is used in combination with methotrexate, patients had more
improvement in both arthritis and psoriasis when compared to methotrexate alone.10
Interleukin-12/23 Antagonists
Studies with ustekinumab reveal improvement in signs and symptoms of arthritis
and psoriasis as well as quality of life.11
Other Systemic Treatments

• Systemic corticosteroid treatment is not recommended for long-term treatment
of PsA but may provide symptomatic relief until the delayed action of steroidsparing anti-rheumatic drugs takes effect. However, a post-steroid psoriasis
flare can occur.

• Cyclosporine
This treatment can be used when both skin and joint symptoms are present, as
it will decrease signs of inflammation and psoriasis when used in
combination with methotrexate.
This approach can take several months to attain a response and has significant
potential for renal toxicity, although dosages for PsA are less than those
utilized in transplantation.
Therapy should be limited to no more than 12 months.
Topical Agents

• Retinoids such as acitretin can be useful for skin involvement.
268

• Psoralen and ultraviolet A photochemotherapy/ultraviolet B (PUVA/UVB) can
be used when both skin and joint symptoms are present.

• The scalp, groin, and axilla are areas that should not be treated with
phototherapy.

• Aggressive immunosuppression should not be utilized after phototherapy due to
the higher risk of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers.
Surgical Management
In severely disabled patients with significant joint deformities, surgery with joint
replacements or arthroplasties may provide functional benefit and symptomatic
relief.
REFERRAL

• As with all seronegative SpA, therapy should include consultation with
physical and occupational therapists.

• Consultation with dermatologist is recommended to coordinate treatment and is
especially useful in patients with severe skin involvement.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• A poor prognosis is associated with an increased number of actively inflamed
joints, elevated ESR, treatment failure, evidence of joint damage, decreased
function as per the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and reduced
quality of life.

• Particular HLA antigens have been associated with disease progression; these
include HLA-B39, B27, and Dqw3.

Reactive Arthritis
Reeti Joshi and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Reactive arthritis (ReA) is a term for disorders that include the disease
previously known as Reiter’s syndrome (arthritis, uveitis, and conjunctivitis).
Hans Reiter was revealed to be a Nazi war criminal who designed studies on
internees in concentration camps.1 For this reason and because ReA is a
broader term, usage of the descriptor “Reiter’s syndrome” is declining, even
though there is no consensus on defining ReA.2–4

• ReA belongs to the group of disorders known as spondyloarthropathies (SpA,
Chapter 15), differentiated from other types of SpA as a syndrome of sterile,
inflammatory arthritis occurring in patients after a genitourinary (GU) or
gastrointestinal (GI) infection. However, the arthritis in ReA is classically
sterile and occurs after a latent period rather than during acute GU or GI
infection, thereby distinguishing it from septic arthritis due to direct infection.

• Extra-articular manifestations include urethritis, uveitis, oral ulcers, skin
rashes, and nail changes.
Epidemiology

• The precise prevalence and incidence of ReA are not well known in part due to
the absence of well-accepted diagnostic criteria and study of different
populations.3,4 For example, among a military personnel cohort, the incidence
was 4.1 cases per 100,000 persons for ReA after GI infections, 5 but other
estimates were much higher (28/100,000) in a Swedish population.6
Nonetheless, ReA appears to be less common than the other SpA.

• Typically, ReA affects the young and middle aged, probably influenced by
infectious exposures.

• ReA occurring after GU infections is generally much more common in men,
271

while ReA occurring after GI infections affects men and women equally.7

• ReA tends to have a familial association, but appears to be less strongly
associated with HLA-B27 than ankylosing spondylitis.8 Nevertheless, the risk
of developing ReA after an infection is about 1% to 4% whereas in HLA-B27+
individuals, the risk increases to more than 20%.3
Etiology

• While the arthritis in ReA is classically sterile (no organisms isolated), ReA
follows GU or GI infections due to only selected bacterial species, such as
Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella (especially S. flexneri) , Yersinia, and
Campylobacter, suggesting that they are causative agents.
However, systematic epidemiologic studies have only been performed after
Salmonella and Shigella enteric outbreaks, primarily for the older, more
restrictive definition of Reiter’s syndrome.4
Koch’s postulates for a causative role of these organisms have not been
satisfied. With the possible exception of Chlamydia, it has been difficult to
reliably isolate live organisms from affected areas, including joints, although
there have been reports of bacterial DNA identified by sensitive techniques,
such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR).9

• In addition to the classic triggers for ReA, numerous case reports also
implicate other organisms but they have not been studied systematically.
Pathophysiology
The pathogenesis of ReA is still poorly understood. However, the strong clinical
associations with certain bacterial infections and HLA-B27 implicate the immune
system in pathogenesis as discussed in Chapter 15.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Clinical features of ReA after GI and GU infections are quite similar.
History

• Acute onset of asymmetric inflammatory oligoarthritis (<4 joints) within 2 to 4
weeks of the initial infection is a common presentation.
272

• As the preceding infection may be clinically mild or occult, relying on
symptoms of a triggering infection often results in underdiagnosis.
Physical Examination

• The joints most commonly affected include knees, ankles, sacroiliac (SI)
joints, lower lumbar spine, and feet.

• Enthesitis (inflammation at the site of insertion of a tendon or muscle into a
bone) is a hallmark feature, the commonest being Achilles tendonitis and
plantar fasciitis, often causing heel pain.

• Dactylitis (“sausage digits”) may be seen.
• Inflammatory low back pain occurs, with symptoms consistent with
sacroiliitis or spondylitis.

• Other symptoms associated with ReA include conjunctivitis and, in more
severe instances, anterior uveitis.

• Mucosal features include painless oral ulcers and sterile pyuria/dysuria (seen
in ReA following either GI or GU infections).

• Skin manifestations occur later and may include circinate balanitis, skin
inflammation on the glans penis, and keratoderma blennorrhagicum,
hyperkeratotic pustular lesions found on the palms and soles that are
histologically identical to pustular psoriasis.

• Nail changes including pitting and onycholysis can mimic psoriatic changes.
• On rare occasions, ReA can lead to cardiac involvement, including aortic
insufficiency.
Diagnostic Criteria

• ReA is essentially a clinical diagnosis. Unlike other rheumatic disorders such
as RA and SLE, there are no validated diagnostic criteria for ReA. 3,4
However, ReA is classified as one of the SpA and there are now classification
criteria for the SpA, including ReA, as discussed in Chapter 15 (Table 15-1).

• Except for the history of a preceding GI or GU infection, there are no clear
clinical features that differentiate ReA from the other seronegative SpA. ReA
can be distinguished from septic arthritis which occurs in the setting of
obvious, acute infection and/or when organisms are cultured from the joint.
273

ReA typically occurs some time after the acute GI or GU infection has passed.

• When symptoms persist for more than 6 months, ReA is considered chronic.10 It
may have all of the features described in the acute phase, as well as chronic
arthritis and enthesitis producing radiographic features described below.

• Other disorders involving arthritis and GI and/or GU tract should be
considered. These include SpA associated with inflammatory bowel disease,
gonococcal infection, Behçet’s syndrome, and Whipple’s disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• General makers of inflammation such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
and C-reactive protein (CRP) may be elevated in ReA but are not useful
diagnostically.

• HLA-B27 has a limited positive predictive value and testing should not be
used as diagnostic tool as discussed in Chapter 15.

• Serologic tests may sometimes substantiate prior infections with typical
organisms but are usually not clinically useful because they have a high falsenegative rate and if positive, usually do not indicate if the infection was recent.
Joint aspirations for microbiologic culture should be negative; positive results
indicate septic arthritis.

• PCR for microorganisms may be helpful for research studies but is generally
not useful clinically.
Imaging

• Imaging studies may help exclude other diagnoses such as rheumatoid arthritis.
• Features including sacroiliitis, syndesmophytes, periosteal new bone
formation, and erosions are often evident in chronic disease.

• Additional findings such as fluffy erosions at the calcaneus or pencil-in-cup
erosions at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints support the diagnosis.

• MRI or ultrasound of SI or other joints to detect earlier changes may be
helpful but has not been studied in patients with ReA.
TREATMENT
274

• Treatment should be guided by the generally good prognosis for ReA which is
usually self-limited and abates spontaneously after several months. For
example, the prognosis is generally better for ReA, as defined by ability to
perform full work capacity, than other inflammatory arthritides.11

• Nonetheless, recurrent or chronic ReA can lead to significant joint destruction
and disability.

• Disease activity is typically monitored primarily by clinical signs and
symptoms. There are no set criteria for disease activity but elevated ESR may
respond to therapeutic intervention.
Medications
First Line

• In most cases of ReA, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
provide symptomatic relief for arthritis, but they are not efficacious for extraarticular manifestations.

• For limited joint involvement, and for circinate balanitis and keratoderma
blennorrhagicum, intra-articular and topical steroids, respectively, provide
symptomatic short-term relief.
Second Line

• Corticosteroids generally should be avoided since they appear to be of
limited benefit and carry significant morbidity and toxicity.

• For more severe or relapsing and chronic disease states, use of steroid-sparing
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be helpful.

• Sulfasalazine (SSZ) is the best studied DMARD for ReA with a modest,
though significant, response rate of 62% for patients on 2,000 mg of SSZ per
day versus 48% on placebo at 36 weeks in a Veterans Affairs Cooperative
study.12 Similar responses were reported by others.13 SSZ is generally
considered to be helpful for peripheral arthritis but not axial disease.14

• Several tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αreceptor antagonists have been FDA
approved for use in ankylosing spondylitis. For ReA specifically, two open
label studies show benefit of etanercept15,16 and other TNF blockers.16

• The use of methotrexate, azathioprine, cyclosporine and other agents in ReA
has been used but not formally studied.
275

• Antibiotic therapy is controversial. With regard to acute GI and GU infections,
antibiotic usage should follow standard infectious disease guidelines for the
specific organism. For chronic ReA, it remains unclear if antibiotic therapy
affects the outcomes of patients. Consequently, routine antibiotic therapy is
not generally recommended for chronic ReA.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies
Physical therapy may be beneficial, especially to prevent contractures and muscle
atrophy in patients with spinal involvement.

Enteropathic Arthritis
Kristine A. Kuhn and Wayne M. Yokoyama
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Enteropathic arthritis is one of the five types of spondyloarthropathies (SpA). It
is distinguished from the other types by its association with the inflammatory
bowel diseases (IBD): Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC).

• This chapter will discuss the features of enteropathic arthritis that are shared
with other SpAs and distinguish enteropathic arthritis from the other forms of
SpA.
Definition
Patients with enteropathic arthritis meet the criteria for SpA as described in Chapter
15, in association with IBD.
Classification

• Three types of arthritis are associated with IBD:1
Type I is a peripheral, pauciarticular arthritis, usually asymmetric, that
occurs during active bowel disease. The inflammation typically is transient,
migratory, and non-deforming. It may precede a diagnosis of IBD.
Type II is a peripheral, polyarticular arthritis that occurs independently of
the activity of bowel disease.
Type III is axial disease, which occurs independently of the activity of
bowel disease. Features of type III arthritis can range from inflammatory
back pain and sacroiliitis to a disease mimicking ankylosing spondylitis
(AS).
Enthesitis can occur with all types.

• Arthralgias (non-inflammatory joint pain) also commonly occur in patients
with IBD; however, these are not part of the spectrum of enteropathic arthritis.
278

Epidemiology

• Overall, arthritis occurs in about 20% of patients with IBD.1 In these patients:
Type 1 arthritis will occur in 10% to 20%;
Type II arthritis in 2% to 4%; and
Type III inflammatory back pain and/or sacroiliitis in 20% to 30%, while
about 2% to 10% will develop AS.
Etiology

• As in other diseases, enteropathic arthritis likely occurs as a result of an
environmental trigger in a genetically appropriate setting. One hypothesis links
chronic gut inflammation to the loss of tolerance to gut pathogens and the
development of arthritis.2

• Several candidate genes for IBD have been linked to the development of SpA.1
Mice transgenic for HLA-B27 and human β2-microglobulin develop
sacroiliitis, peripheral arthritis, colitis, and psoriasiform skin lesions.3
Disease, however, does not develop when mice are housed in germ-free
conditions.
Specific interleukin (IL)-23 receptor polymorphisms have been demonstrated
to be protective against CD, AS, and psoriasis.4,5
Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD 2), also
known as caspase recruitment domain family member 15 (CARD15),
polymorphisms are genetically associated with CD.6 Although no association
is found with SpA, SpA patients with certain CARD15 polymorphisms have
an increased risk for chronic gut inflammation.
Genome-wide association studies are demonstrating other genetic
susceptibility loci that associate with IBD, SpA, and chronic gut
inflammation.
Pathophysiology
Like other SpA, enteropathic arthritis appears to be immune mediated, with tumor
necrosis factor (TNF)-α central to the pathogenesis of disease. See Chapter 15 for
further review.
Risk Factors
279

• No specific risk factors have been identified for the development of
enteropathic arthritis, other than the presence of IBD.

• There is suggestion of a genetic risk with the presence of HLA-B27. However,
the frequency of HLA-B27 in patients with IBD is 30%, compared to up to
95% of patients with AS.1
DIAGNOSIS

• Diagnosis is based on a clinical presentation of SpA and a history of IBD.
• Classification criteria for SpA (Table 15-1) guide which clinical features and
testing suggest a diagnosis of SpA.
Clinical Presentation

• Bowel pathology usually occurs before extra-intestinal manifestations develop;
however, arthritis can sometimes be the presenting symptom of IBD.1

• The peripheral arthritis associated with IBD is typically oligoarticular,
migratory, and asymmetric, and it generally affects the lower limbs. The
inflammatory arthritis may lead to large joint effusions, especially in the knees.

• Other associated conditions include uveitis, aortic regurgitation, and skin
manifestations. Erythema nodosum and pyoderma gangrenosum are
associated with CD and UC, respectively.
History

• The patient may describe symptoms of inflammatory arthritis (morning stiffness
lasting longer than 60 minutes, improvement of stiffness with activity, and/or
joint swelling and warmth).
Peripheral joint involvement is usually asymmetric and affecting the lower
extremity joints.
Axial skeletal involvement may cause alternating buttock pain.

• One should assess for signs and symptoms of IBD in patients presenting with
SpA who do not have a prior history of IBD. In those patients with an
established diagnosis of IBD, activity of disease should be assessed. Signs and
symptoms include the following:
Frequent diarrhea, with or without hematochezia, mucous, steatorrhea, and
280

malabsorption.
Crampy abdominal pain.
Fistulas, abscesses, and aphthous ulcers.
Extra-intestinal manifestations including uveitis, pyoderma gangrenosum,
and erythema nodosum.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination should evaluate for musculoskeletal as well as other
extra-intestinal manifestations of IBD.

• The musculoskeletal exam can be divided into the axial and peripheral
findings:
Examination of the axial skeleton may demonstrate decreased spinal
mobility.
Peripheral joint findings include swelling, effusions, erythema, reduced
range of motion, dactylitis, and enthesitis.

• Scleral injection raises suspicion for eye involvement. Referral to an
ophthalmologist and evaluation for uveitis may be required.

• Evaluation of the skin may reveal enterocutaneous fistulae, erythematous
nodules, or ulcers. Dermatology referral and skin biopsy may need to be
considered.

• Findings upon examination of the gastrointestinal system may reveal aphthous
ulcers, abdominal tenderness, rectal ulcers, and guaiac-positive stool.
Diagnostic Criteria

• No specific diagnostic criteria exist. Diagnosis is based on clinical suspicion
and excluding other causes for symptoms.

• The criteria for SpA, as proposed by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
International Society (ASAS), (Table 15-1) are useful as general diagnostic
guidelines.7,8

• Patients with enteropathic arthritis obviously would be expected to meet the
criteria for diagnosis of SpA and have active IBD or a history compatible with
IBD. Some patients may develop IBD after a diagnosis of undifferentiated
SpA is made.
281

Differential Diagnosis

• Mechanical back pain is the most common cause of lower back pain. Only 5%
of patients seen in a primary care setting with chronic low back pain are
diagnosed with SpA.

• In those without a prior diagnosis of IBD who present with inflammatory back
pain, the differential diagnosis includes the five types of SpA. Peripheral
arthritis may be infectious or rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

• In patients with established IBD presenting with monoarticular arthritis,
infectious arthritis must be considered.

• Arthralgias, joint pain without inflammatory symptoms, may be found in
patients with IBD. These are not part of the spectrum of enteropathic arthritis.
Diagnostic Testing

• Few diagnostic tests are of use for establishing a diagnosis of enteropathic
arthritis.

• Laboratory testing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) may suggest systemic inflammation, but are nonspecific.

• Imaging may demonstrate sacroiliitis or other inflammatory changes in the joint.
Laboratories

• ESR and CRP may indicate a systemic inflammatory process. Unfortunately,
these tests rarely correlate with disease activity.

• HLA-B27 is only positive in about 30% of patients with enteropathic
arthritis. Furthermore, only 1% to 2% of people who carry HLA-B27 develop
SpA. Therefore, HLA-B27 testing is not clinically useful.1
Imaging

• Plain radiography of the sacroiliac joints and spine may demonstrate
sacroiliitis, syndesmophytes, or ankylosis consistent with AS (see Chapter
16).2

• MRI of the spine may demonstrate early inflammatory changes including bone
marrow edema and fat infiltration (see Chapter 15).

• For peripheral joints, three modalities are used for imaging. Plain radiography
282

may demonstrate enthesitis and periosteal reaction. Ultrasound and MRI may
also be helpful in identifying subtle inflammatory changes within the joint and
surrounding structures.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Gastroenterology referral and endoscopy should be considered in patients with
a clinical presentation of SpA and bowel symptoms to evaluate for IBD if not
already established.

• An arthrocentesis should be performed in any patient presenting with
peripheral monoarticular arthritis with synovial fluid submitted for cell count
and culture to evaluate for infectious arthritis.
TREATMENT

• Pharmacologic treatment of enteropathic arthritis depends upon the type of
arthritis.

• Regardless of the type of enteropathic arthritis, all patients benefit from
exercise and/or physical therapy.
Medications

• Often, control of IBD will result in control of arthritis and, therefore, should
be the goal of therapy. However, when the arthritis is independent of bowel
inflammation additional therapy should be considered.

• The pharmacologic therapy of axial and peripheral enteropathic arthritis is
similar to that for AS and psoriatic arthritis (PsA), respectively. Many
statements about treatment of undifferentiated SpA apply to axial enteropathic
arthritis.
Nonsteroidal Antiinflammatory Drugs

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line therapy for the
treatment of SpA and are used in enteropathic arthritis.
They are used with caution in enteropathic arthritis as NSAIDs have been
shown to worsen IBD in some patients.9

• Brief courses (up to two weeks) of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors appear
283

to be safe, but long-term data are lacking.
Oral Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs

• Second-line agents include oral disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs
(DMARDs) such as sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and azathioprine.10
Sulfasalazine is the preferred oral DMARD given its use in controlling IBD.
Although no clinical trials have demonstrated its value in enteropathic
arthritis, clinical experience suggests efficacy in early disease and in
peripheral disease. It does not alter the course of axial disease or peripheral
enthesopathy.
Similarly, there is little trial evidence for the use of methotrexate and
azathioprine; but anecdotally, these agents appear to have greater benefit in
treating peripheral compared to axial disease.
Antitumor Necrosis Factor Agents

• Biologic therapy with antitumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents has
emerged as a mainstay for treatment of IBD and SpA.
Several small trials have demonstrated good results with infliximab in
specifically treating enteropathic arthritis. Patients’ gastrointestinal disease
and arthritis, both peripheral and axial manifestations, rapidly improved
after infusion of the drug.
Other anti-TNF agents have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of SpA.
Etanercept, however, has less efficacy than monoclonal anti-TNF antibody
therapies for the treatment of IBD.11
Analgesics and Glucocorticoids

• Pain control may require use of analgesics.
• Glucocorticoids, oral or intra-articular, are useful in controlling bowel
inflammation and may be useful for peripheral joint involvement. They are
ineffective for the treatment of axial disease.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Physical therapy and exercise are mainstays for all SpAs. An exercise
program in combination with pharmacologic agents has been shown to be more
284

effective than pharmacologic treatment alone.

• Surgical management is discussed in Chapter 15.
COMPLICATIONS

• Complications of SpA depend upon the type of arthritis.
• Type I arthritis is usually non-deforming.
• Type II arthritis can lead to joint erosions and/or ankylosis of an affected joint,
similar to that found in PsA. See Chapter 17.

• Those with type III arthritis may develop complications related to spinal
involvement, similar to AS. See Chapter 16.
REFERRAL

• IBD patients with one or more of the following should be referred to a
rheumatologist:
Inflammatory back pain.
Sacroiliitis on imaging.
Peripheral arthritis, enthesitis, or dactylitis.

• Those patients who have inflammatory back pain or peripheral arthritis,
enthesitis, or dactylitis with signs and symptoms suggestive of IBD should be
referred to a gastroenterologist for further diagnostic testing.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Patients should be educated on the manifestations, complications, and
therapeutic options of their disease.

• In addition, the benefits of exercise and physical therapy for improving
functional status and limiting pain should be emphasized.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Disease activity should be monitored on the basis of clinical features of bowel
disease, morning stiffness, pain, physical exam, and imaging when indicated.
285

Vasculitis
Alfred H.J. Kim and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Vasculitis is inflammation of the vessel wall. It is an uncommon manifestation
of a wide variety of autoimmune, infectious, malignant, and iatrogenic
conditions.

• It is characterized by nonspecific signs and symptoms due to systemic
inflammatory disease, but specific signs and symptoms depend on which
vessels are involved.

• Damage to tissues occurs via ischemia or infarction secondary to a reduction in
perfusion to tissue distal to the vasculitic lesion.

• The severity of symptoms ranges from self-limiting rash to life-threatening
disease.
Definition

• Vasculitis is defined as inflammatory infiltration of vessel walls with damage
to mural structures.

• Vasculitis is a pathologic finding, not a diagnosis. Efforts must be made to
determine the cause.
Classification
Vasculitis can be divided into primary or secondary, on the basis of etiologies.
Primary Vasculitis

• This typically refers to autoimmune causes.
• Several classification schemes exist, but the most commonly used scheme was
derived from the 1993 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference presented in Table
20-1.1
288

• The Chapel Hill Consensus stratified the vasculitides into the size of vessel
affected:
Large
Medium
Small
Often, a vasculitis will affect vessels of more than one size. These are
classified on the basis of which sized vessel the condition primarily affects.
Large Vessel Vasculitides

• Takayasu’s arteritis (see Chapter 21, Takayasu’s Arteritis).
Granulomatous inflammation affects primarily the aorta and its main
branches and may involve all or just a portion of these vessels.
Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis. Typically, in young
women from Far East Asia (Japan) with pulseless disease in the upper
extremities.
TABLE 20-1 CLASSIFICATION OF VASCULITIS

289

• Giant cell arteritis (see Chapter 22, Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia
Rheumatica).
Granulomatous arteritis occurs primarily in the cranial branches of
arteries arising from the aortic arch, also affecting medium-sized vessels.
Classically involves the temporal artery.
Associated with polymyalgia rheumatica.
Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis. Usually seen in patients
>50 years old, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >50, and is
associated with headache and less commonly jaw or tongue claudication.
Medium Vessel Vasculitides

• Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) (see Chapter 23, Polyarteritis Nodosa)
A necrotizing systemic vasculitis affecting both medium and small muscular
arteries, without glomerulonephritis or vasculitis of the arterioles,
capillaries or venules.
Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis. Although accounting for
<10% of cases due to increased vaccinations, PAN is typically associated
with hepatitis B. Clinically, skin nodules, mononeuritis multiplex, orchitis,
and mesenteric artery involvement are most common.

• Kawasaki disease
Primarily a medium vessel vasculitis, but can affect large and small vessels.
Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis. Mostly seen in
children. Predilection for coronary arteries. Occasionally associated with a
mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome.

• Primary angiitis of the central nervous system
A rare granulomatous vasculitis isolated to the medium and small arteries in
the leptomeninges.
Small Vessel Vasculitides

• The small vessel vasculitides are further subdivided into the presence or
absence of immunoglobulin within the vessels.

• Presence of immune complexes in vessels (immune complex related).
290

Henoch–Schönlein purpura (see Chapter 27, Henoch–Schönlein Purpura)
Systemic vasculitis where IgA-containing immune complexes deposit
within tissues, such as the renal glomerulus, skin and gut.
Most common form of systemic vasculitis in children.
Associated with arthralgias or arthritis, myalgias, and subcutaneous
edema.
Post-capillary venules are most affected.
Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (see Chapter 28, Cryoglobulinemia and
Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis)
Characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, serum proteins that
precipitate in the cold.
Associated with hepatitis B and C infection. Skin (extremities) and
glomeruli often involved.
Affects arterioles, capillaries, and venules.
Connective tissue disease–associated vasculitis
Seen in small muscular arteries, arterioles, and venules.
Typically associated with rheumatoid arthritis (see Chapter 10,
Rheumatoid Arthritis), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (see Chapter
12, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus), and Sjögren’s syndrome (see Chapter
37, Sjögren’s Syndrome).
Behçet’s syndrome (see Chapter 31, Behçet’s Syndrome), relapsing
polychondritis
(see Chapter 43, Relapsing Polychondritis), and
inflammatory bowel disease also may present with a vasculitis in a
similar vessel distribution to connective tissue diseases.

• Absence of immune complexes in vessels (pauci-immune); these conditions
are usually associated with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).
Wegener’s granulomatosis, also known as ANCA-associated
granulomatous vasculitis (see Chapter 24, Wegener’s Granulomatosis)
Systemic vasculitis affecting small and medium arteries, along with
arterioles and venules.
Lower respiratory tract chronic granulomatous vasculitic inflammation
is characteristic. Upper airways have chronic inflammation, but typically
in the absence of granulomatous inflammation.
Typically, patients start with sinus and upper airway symptoms, then lower
291

airway and next kidney disease. Systemic vasculitis can occur at anytime
during the disease process.
Necrotizing, pauci-immune glomerulonephritis in the kidneys.
Associated with anti-proteinase 3 (anti-PR3) antibody, with a
cytoplasmic ANCA staining pattern (c-ANCA).
Churg–Strauss syndrome (see Chapter 25, Churg–Strauss Syndrome)
Also known as allergic granulomatosis and angiitis.
Also affects medium-sized vessels.
Classically affects lung and skin arteries, but can be systemic.
Extravascular granulomatosis is characteristic.
Associated in approximately 50% of cases with anti-myeloperoxidase
(anti-MPO) antibodies, yielding a perinuclear ANCA staining pattern (pANCA).
Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis. Classic presentation
is older person with new onset, relatively refractory, and progressive
asthma with eosinophilia.
Microscopic Polyangiitis (see Chapter 26, Microscopic Polyangiitis)
Systemic vasculitis similar to Wegener’s granulomatosis with the
exception of absence of upper airway involvement, granulomatous
inflammation, and serologic specificity.
Associated with anti-MPO antibodies, yielding a positive p-ANCA.
Secondary Vasculitis

• Usually refers to non-autoimmune causes of vasculitis.
• Medications, infections, and malignancies are the most common etiologies
for secondary vasculitis.

• Medications typically cause hypersensitivity vasculitis manifested by skin
findings, specifically leukocytoclastic vasculitis (see Chapter 29, Cutaneous
Vasculitis). Separate classification criteria exist to aid diagnosis of
hypersensitivity vasculitis.

• Viruses associated with medium and small vessel vasculitis include hepatitis
B, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein–Barr virus, and
parvovirus B19.
292

Viral vasculitides often present similarly to PAN or microscopic
polyangiitis.
It is important to differentiate between non-viral and viral vasculitis since
treatment options differ significantly.

• Hematologic, more so than solid, malignancies can be associated with
vasculitis.
Typically presents with palpable purpura.
Hairy cell leukemia presents with a PAN-like picture or as a cutaneous
vasculitis.
Lymphoproliferative disorders including myelodysplastic syndromes,
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia, lymphocytic lymphoma, and chronic
lymphocytic leukemia all can have associated vasculitis, with or without
cryoglobulins.
Etiology
Multiple factors appear to play a role is disease susceptibility, including genetic,
immune, and environmental. Much is yet to be learned about each.
Pathophysiology

• The mechanisms underlying the vasculitides remain poorly understood.
• Currently, it is believed that while immune complexes themselves are not
innately pathogenic, their inflammatory potential can be augmented in the
setting of increased antigen load, decreased clearance efficiency by the
reticuloendothelial system (RES), or decreased solubility. The pathogenic
immune complexes fix complement, leading to intense inflammation.
Regarding immune complex solubility, when there are equal parts of antigen
and antibody, large immune complexes form that are cleared by the RES
without tissue damage.
When an excess of antibody is present, small immune complexes are
generated but remain soluble, and are not pathogenic.
When there is an excess of antigen, the immune complexes precipitate,
and get trapped in capillaries or vessels damaged by turbulent blood flow.
This leads to immune complex–mediated inflammation.

• Activating Fcγ receptors and the alternative pathway of complement are
293

critical for ANCA-associated pauci-immune vasculitis induction. Activation of
neutrophils and macrophages ensues, leading to endothelial injury.

• In giant cell arteritis, dendritic cells, T cells and macrophages are strongly
implicated in arterial wall destruction.

• Several models have been proposed to describe why vasculitic syndromes
have a predilection for certain vessels2:
Antigens distribute preferentially to tissues, thus inducing vasculitis in those
vessels.
Endothelial cells control the severity of inflammation at the vessel through
expression of adhesion molecules and secretion of proteins, peptides, and
hormones. This will control how the immune cell interacts with the
vasculature.
Nonendothelial cells modulate immune cell and/or endothelial cell behavior,
modulating the level of inflammation.
DIAGNOSIS

• The diagnosis of vasculitis should be entertained whenever a patient with
systemic symptoms has organ dysfunction.

• Characteristic symptoms are associated with the involvement of certain sized
vessels. Thus, it is best to try to assign the patient’s signs and symptoms to a
particular vessel size category, then determine what features of each
disease within the category best fit the patient.

• Use laboratory testing and diagnostic procedures to define the extent of disease
or better elucidate any other characteristic features, particularly biopsy of
affected organs as this typically yields the diagnosis.
Clinical Presentation

• Most common constitutional symptoms are fatigue, malaise, fever, and
arthralgias.

• Several clinical features strongly suggest the presence of vasculitis:
Purpura
These are nonblanching skin lesions due to bleeding in the skin.
Those with isolated skin lesions are considered to have cutaneous
294

leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
If the purpura is palpable and systemic involvement is seen, Henoch–
Schönlein purpura or microscopic polyangiitis should be suspected.
Mononeuritis multiplex
This occurs when two or more nerves in separate parts of the body are
damaged.
“Foot-drop” occurs due to damage to the sciatic or peroneal nerve;
“wrist-drop” occurs due to damage to the radial nerve.
Of all the neurologic symptoms seen in vasculitis, mononeuritis multiplex
is the most specific.
Pulmonary–renal involvement
Alveolar hemorrhage from capillaritis can cause hemoptysis. Hemoptysis
can also be associated with a medium-sized vessel vasculitis due to a
ruptured bronchial artery aneurysm.
Glomerulonephritis will be associated with red blood cell casts or
dysmorphic red blood cells in the urine.
While the ANCA-associated vasculitides can cause pulmonary–renal
syndrome, anti-glomerular basement membrane syndrome, embolic
disease, infection, and SLE should also be considered.
History

• Detailed history significantly helps differentiate between primary and
secondary causes of vasculitis.

• Ask about past history of:
Medications (hypersensitivity vasculitis).
Hepatitis B or C (PAN or cryoglobulinemia, respectively).
Connective tissue disease.
Sexual history (HIV infection).
Illicit drug use (ergots, cocaine, or amphetamines).

• Certain age groups and gender are associated with specific vasculitides.
Wegener’s granulomatosis and PAN have mean age of onset between 45 and
50, while HSP and Takayasu’s arteritis between 17 and 26 within the adult
population.
295

Giant cell arteritis affects an older population, with a mean age of onset of
69.
Takayasu’s and giant cell arteritis occur predominantly in females.
Physical Examination
Certain clues are seen depending on vessel size, see Table 20-2.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The American College of Rheumatology has defined classification criteria for
several of the vasculitides, including:
Takayasu’s arteritis (see Chapter 21, Takayasu’s Arteritis).
Giant cell arteritis (see Chapter 22, Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia
Rheumatica).
PAN (see Chapter 23, Polyarteritis Nodosa).
Kawasaki disease.
Churg–Strauss syndrome (see Chapter 25, Churg–Strauss Syndrome).
Hypersensitivity vasculitis (see Chapter 29, Cutaneous Vasculitis).

• The remainder of the vasculitides do not have set criteria for diagnosis, but are
diagnosed clinically with the help of laboratory testing.
Differential Diagnosis

• Look for secondary causes of vasculitis when the patient does not appear to fit
within any of the primary vasculitides.
TABLE 20-2 PHYSICAL EXAMINATION FEATURES OF VASCULITIS

296

• Embolic disorders (endocarditis, left atrial myxoma, cholesterol emboli) can
mimic a small vessel vasculitis.

• Infections such as sepsis, fungal infections (especially mycotic aneurysm with
embolization), mycobacterial infections, Rickettsial infections, and syphilis
may mimic a small vessel vasculitis.

• SLE and amyloidosis, in the absence of vasculitis, can present with vasculitistype symptoms.

• Ergots, cocaine, and amphetamines can mimic medium or small vessel
vasculitis.

• Malignancies seen with vasculitis-like symptoms include lymphomatoid
granulomatosis, intravascular lymphoma, and angioimmunoblastic T-cell
lymphoma.

• Thrombocytopenia and myelodysplastic syndromes can present with nonvasculitic purpura.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Basic laboratory analysis should include:
Complete blood count with differential.
Comprehensive metabolic panel (elevated creatinine).
Muscle enzymes (creatine kinase, aldolase).
ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP).
297

Hepatitis and HIV serologies.
Urinalysis and urine toxicology screen.

• More specific laboratory testing can include (see Chapter 5, Laboratory
Evaluation of Rheumatic Diseases):
Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) if suspecting a connective tissue disease.
Complement
(low
levels
are seen in cryoglobulinemia,
hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis, and the vasculitis associated with
SLE).
Although not diagnostic, when ANCA is directed to PR3 by ELISA, strongly
consider Wegener’s granulomatosis. When directed to MPO, consider
microscopic polyangiitis or Churg–Strauss syndrome.
Imaging

• Decision to pursue imaging is dependent on the patient’s symptom complex.
• Chest radiography may reveal pulmonary infiltration including alveolar
hemorrhage.

• Sinus CT may reveal sinusitis in Wegener’s granulomatosis.
• Echocardiogram to rule out vegetations and atrial myxoma.
• Angiogram may reveal characteristic alternating dilatations and strictures in
large or medium-sized vasculitides—especially in PAN and temporal arteritis.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Usually, biopsy of affected tissue (e.g., skin, nerve, kidney, lungs) can reveal
the pathologic findings of vasculitis.

• Delay in obtaining material from affected tissue is a common mistake in
establishing a diagnosis in these conditions.
TREATMENT

• The goal of treatment is to first induce remission of disease, then maintain the
patient on a less toxic immunosuppressant to prevent relapses.

• Treatment is based on type and severity of clinical manifestations (see Chapter
9, Drugs Used for the Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases).
298

• In general, immunosuppression is the mainstay for treatment.
Medications

• Glucocorticoids are used in virtually all systemic vasculitis patients.
Giant cell arteritis and Churg–Strauss Syndrome often undergo remission
with glucocorticoids alone.

• Cyclophosphamide is combined with corticosteroids for rapidly progressive
vasculitides, such as the ANCA-associated conditions. Mycophenolate
mofetil has been used with efficacy for treatment of relapses in these patients.

• Methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil have been used for
less severe forms of vasculitis and also for maintenance therapy following
cyclophosphamide.

• Rituximab is a B-cell depleting agent and is non-inferior to cyclophosphamide
for ANCA-associated vasculitis. 3 Rituximab may replace cyclophosphamide
due to the potential reduction in long-term side effects.
COMPLICATIONS

• Inadequately treated or aggressive forms of vasculitis can lead to permanent
end-organ damage and death.

• Relapse after induction treatment is unfortunately common, but re-treatment
usually leads to a good response.
REFERRAL

• Referral to a rheumatologist should occur once a vasculitis is suspected to help
confirm the diagnosis and direct the management of immunosuppression.

• Other specialists may be necessary depending on severity of disease in a
particular organ (such as nephrologists).
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Due to the relative infrequency of these syndromes, patient education is
important to help the patient understand their disease and also to dispel
299

inaccuracies found on the internet.

• Patients must be informed of the side effects associated with their specific
immunosuppressive regimen.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• The goal during follow-up is to slowly wean the level of immunosuppression to
reduce potential drug-induced toxicity and monitor for flares and infections.

• Commonly, the procedures used to diagnose the patient are employed for
monitoring, except for biopsy.

• A history and physical examination, along with laboratory testing, should be
routinely done during the follow-up period.
When relapses occur, the history and physical findings will typically mimic
the patient’s initial presentation.
Routine vaccinations with killed vaccines should be done with every
immunosuppressed patient.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• There is limited amount of data regarding outcome.
• Most patients who are treated early and respond appropriately to treatment do
not have significant reduction in survival.

Takayasu’s Arteritis
Michael L. Sams and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference defined Takayasu’s arteritis (TA) as a
rare granulomatous inflammation of the aorta and its major branches.1

• TA may also affect the pulmonary and coronary arteries.
• It is a chronic vasculitis characterized primarily by stenotic, but also, less
frequently, by aneurysmal lesions of the large arteries.
Epidemiology

• TA is most common in Asians. The incidence is highest in Japan, with 100 to
200 new cases documented in this country per year. In the United States, the
incidence is approximately 2.5 cases per million per year.

• TA characteristically affects women more than men, approximately 10:1.
• Peak onset is in the third decade. Onset of the disease after age 40 is rare.
Pathophysiology

• The cause of TA is unknown.
• TA is a focal panarteritis affecting large vessels and their major branches,
with subsequent stenosis and aneurysm formation. Approximately 98% of
patients develop stenoses. Aneurysms are less common but may occur.

• On gross examination, the affected vessels are thick and rigid. The lumen is
affected in a characteristic “skipped” fashion, with normal lumen alternating
with stenoses or aneurysms.

• Microscopic examination of acute aortic inflammation reveals:
301

Infiltration around the vasa vasorum by lymphocytes and plasma cells.
Thickening of the adventitia is present along with leukocytic infiltration of the
tunica media and intimal hyperplasia.2
Granuloma formation and giant cells are typically located in the media.
Destruction and fibrosis of the media can lead to aneurysm formation.
Intimal hyperplasia due to myofibroblast proliferation leads to characteristic
stenotic lesions.

• Chronic inflammation in TA is characterized by fibrosis of all the three vessel
layers. Both acute and chronic inflammations are typically seen in the same
patient at the same time, implying a recurrent process.

• The manifestations of TA are related either to the systemic effects of chronic
inflammation or the effects of localized occlusion or aneurysm formation on
organ function.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• The clinical features of TA have been divided into three monophasic stages.
Phase one is the “prepulseless” inflammatory phase characterized by
nonspecific constitutional symptoms such as fever, malaise, arthralgias, and
weight loss.
Phase two is characterized by vessel inflammation manifesting as vessel
pain and tenderness. This most commonly results in carotidynia (i.e., pain
on palpation of the carotid artery).
Phase three is called the “burnt-out” or fibrotic stage and is characterized
by arterial stenoses leading to ischemic symptoms.

• Disease presentation is variable. Only about half of the patients have
constitutional symptoms, and many patients have both inflammatory and
fibrotic manifestations at the same time. Monophasic disease may also occur.

• The classic presentation of TA is that of a young woman with signs and
symptoms of abnormal cerebral or upper extremity blood flow.

• Diagnosis prior to this stenotic phase of the disease is unlikely, given the
302

nonspecific constitutional symptoms.

• The signs and symptoms are dependent upon the vessels affected.
Subclavian involvement occurs in over 90% of patients, resulting in arm
claudication and pulselessness in about two-thirds.
Aortic involvement occurs in more than half of the patients, and may result in
signs and symptoms of aortic insufficiency, hypertension, and abdominal
angina. Hypertension in this case is believed to be due to aortic stenosis
resulting in decreased blood flow to the kidneys.
Common carotid involvement is also frequent, and poses at risk for visual
defects, strokes and transient ischemic attack (TIA).
The renal arteries are diseased in about one-third of the patients, typically
leading to renovascular hypertension.
Vertebral artery involvement occurs at a similar rate and may trigger for
dizziness and visual impairment.

• Other signs and symptoms include arrhythmia, ischemic chest pain, syncope,
and visual loss. Lastly, congestive heart failure may occur and is typically
related to the presence of hypertension.

• The average time between onset of symptoms and diagnosis is about 10 months.
Physical Examination

• Common findings on physical examination include pulselessness, unequal
brachial blood pressures, subclavian/carotid bruits and carotidynia. These
manifestations are attributed to ascending aorta and aortic arch involvement
with resultant stenoses of their major branches and distal organ hypoperfusion.

• Hypertension may be noted as well and is often due to aortic or renal artery
stenosis.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria for TA
require that at least three of the following six criteria be met for diagnosis
(sensitivity 90.5% and specificity 97.8%)3:
Age of disease onset <40 years.
Claudication of the extremities, especially the upper extremities.
303

Decreased pulses in one or both brachial arteries.
Systolic blood pressure difference of >10 mm Hg between arms.
Bruit over one or both subclavian arteries or abdominal aorta.
Arteriogram showing narrowing or occlusion, usually focal or segmental, of
the aorta, its primary branches, or large arteries in the proximal upper or
lower extremities not due to arteriosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of TA includes the infectious aortitis (e.g., tuberculous,
mycotic, and syphilitic aortitis), Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, Marfan syndrome,
seronegative spondyloarthropathies with aortic root involvement, giant cell
arteritis, sarcoid vasculopathy, and fibromuscular dysplasia.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Lab data in TA are nonspecific. Anemia of chronic disease, mild to moderate
thrombocytosis, hypergammaglobulinemia,
sedimentation rate (ESR) are common.

and

elevated

erythrocyte

• Elevations in C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or ESR may correlate with active
disease, but are not reliable in all patients.
Imaging

• Intra-arterial angiography has been the gold standard for detecting diseased
vessels. However, it does not provide detail of the vessel wall, only the
diameter of the lumen and pressure differences across stenotic lesions.

• MR and CT angiography are now available and can provide details about the
vessel wall itself. Both modalities identify wall edema and vessel thickness.
However, correlation between these wall changes and disease activity is not
clear.

• Ultrasound can be used to evaluate for carotid and abdominal arterial disease.
• 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scanning can detect glucose uptake in inflamed
tissue and is being investigated as a technique to detect active arteritis. Also
being studied is combining PET with CT scanning to help improve location of
the inflammation.2
304

TREATMENT
Medications

• Medical treatment is used to treat the active inflammation in hopes of
preventing the end-stage stenotic and aneurysmal arterial changes.

• Active inflammatory TA is treated initially with oral corticosteroids.
The typical starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day or a maximum of 60 mg of
prednisone per day.
This dose may be continued for 1 to 3 months until improvement.
If the disease continued to respond, steroids may be tapered to an alternate
day regimen.

• If disease fails to improve or if the patient displays intolerance of the steroid
dose a cytotoxic agent is typically started.
Methotrexate 0.3 mg/kg/week is the first choice, with an initial maximum
dose of 15 mg/week that can be titrated up to 25 mg/week.
Steroids are continued in addition to a cytotoxic agent.
Approximately half of the patients will require a cytotoxic agent due to
relapse or insufficient initial response to steroids.1
If steroids cannot be tapered to an alternate day regimen within 6 months or
cannot be discontinued within 12 months of initiating a cytotoxic agent, the
agent is considered a failure and is stopped.
While results of methotrexate promoting remission have been promising,
limited conclusions can be drawn because of the lack of randomized
controlled studies. In addition, given the extremely low prevalence of the
disease, it is difficult to enroll enough subjects to provide sufficient
statistical power to perform a randomized study.

• Other cytotoxic agents that have been used include azathioprine and
mycophenolate mofetil. Cyclophosphamide is avoided given the long-term
risk of cystitis, as well as bladder and other malignancies.

• Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-αantagonists (infliximab and etanercept) have
been studied in an open label investigation in patients with relapsing disease
and steroid toxicity with promising results.4 However, given the lack of
controlled studies, further investigation is needed.

• Hypertension is difficult to treat as ischemia may occur in vascular beds distal
305

to stenotic lesions when blood pressure is lowered.
The risks of ischemia must be weighed against that of prolonged
hypertension.
Furthermore, although limb blood pressure readings are useful in detecting
occlusive disease and in monitoring the progression of stenoses and limb
ischemia, they are inadequate in monitoring the treatment of hypertension.
Stenotic lesions may make peripheral blood pressure readings lower than that
of central pressures.
β-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are not
contraindicated in TA.
Surgical Management

• Bypass surgery and angioplasty are used to treat the permanent arterial
damage that results.

• The indications for surgery may include:
Hypertension associated with renal artery stenosis.
Extremity ischemia that limits activities of daily living.
Severe (>70%) stenosis of at least three cerebral vessels.
Symptoms of cerebral ischemia.
Moderate aortic regurgitation.
Cardiac ischemia with proven coronary artery stenosis.
An expanding aneurysm at risk of rupture also warrants surgical intervention.

• Angioplasty and endovascular stenting may also be used for stenosis. Most
commonly it is used for renal artery stenosis, although there is increasing
experience with angioplasty and stenting of subclavian, coronary, and aortic
stenoses.

• In one long-term cohort of 60 patients, 23 required 50 bypass procedures,
while 11 required angioplasty. Autologous grafts fared better than synthetic
bypass grafts.5

• Angioplasty appears to be complicated by restenosis much more frequently than
bypass surgery.

• Success rates for revascularization procedures are highest in those patients
who have inactive disease by histology at the time of operation.
306

• It is often very difficult to determine clinically whether disease is active, but
systemic features (e.g., fever, myalgias, or arthralgias), elevated ESR, features
of vascular ischemia (e.g., claudication, pulse deficits, bruits, vascular pain, or
asymmetric blood pressure readings), and typical angiographic features are
usually used as indicators. Unfortunately, patients often fail to meet these
criteria of active disease despite pathologic specimens that demonstrate active
inflammation. As mentioned previously, newer imaging modalities, such as CT
and MR angiography, may give information about the vessel wall that
correlates with active inflammation, but further study is needed.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• For most patients, TA is a chronic disease; few patients experience a
monophasic course.

• The follow-up of patients who are in clinical remission has yet to be defined.
• Current markers of active disease are recognized as inadequate indicators of
inflammation. Thus, when to start or taper treatment is a difficult decision.

• Monitoring disease via serial aortography is expensive and associated with
risks and the role of other imaging modalities has yet to be defined.

• Unfortunately, pathologic tissue is difficult to obtain and cannot be used for
following disease activity.

• Reevaluate patients with recurring or relapsing signs and symptoms of systemic
vascular inflammation as described above.

Giant Cell Arteritis and Polymyalgia Rheumatica
Alfred H.J. Kim and John P. Atkinson
GIANT CELL ARTERITIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Giant cell arteritis (GCA, also known as temporal arteritis) is a large- and
medium-vessel vasculitis affecting the second- to fifth-order aortic
branches, often in the extracranial vessels.
It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in vessel walls.
GCA is the most common primary form of vasculitis among adults in the
United States and Europe, and occurs almost exclusively in older adults (>50
years).

• GCA presents with two major symptom complexes:
Vascular insufficiency leading to impaired blood flow.
Vision loss from ischemic optic neuropathy is the most feared
complication.
Headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, or central nervous system
(CNS) ischemia due to cranial arteritis can be seen.
Large-vessel GCA can lead to arm claudication, pulselessness,
Raynaud’s phenomenon, aortic aneurysm or aortic insufficiency. All
patients suspected of GCA should be screened for large vessel
involvement.
Signs of systemic inflammation, including malaise, fever, and weight loss
are common.

• Patients with a reasonable suspicion of GCA should be immediately started
on high-dose oral or intravenous glucocorticoid therapy to suppress the
onset of GCA-related blindness. This will not interfere with temporal artery
biopsy results if the biopsy is done within 10 to 14 days of glucocorticoid
initiation.
309

Once visual compromise has started, recovery in the affected eye rarely
occurs even with aggressive treatment.
Definition

• GCA is defined by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference as granulomatous
arteritis of the aorta and its major branches, particularly the extracranial
branches of the carotid artery.1

• Two forms of GCA have been identified, which are differentiated by the
vascular bed involved:
Cranial arteritis occurs when the extracranial branches of the carotid artery
are involved. This manifests as headache, jaw claudication, and visual
changes.
Large-vessel GCA occurs when the carotid, subclavian, axillary, and other
large vessels branching off the aorta are affected. Aortic arch syndrome
(especially arm claudication) and aortitis can be seen.
Typically, cranial arteritis and large-vessel GCA do not occur in the same
patient.
Epidemiology

• GCA is seen almost exclusively in older individuals. Mean age at diagnosis is
>70 years.

• Incidence is estimated to be 1:500 individuals >50 years of age.
• Women are affected two to three times more often than men.
• 40% to 50% of GCA patients have polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR).
Etiology

• The pathogenesis of GCA is unknown.
• Genetic factors have been correlated with GCA.
The presence of HLA-DR4 has been significantly associated with GCA.
A polymorphism in the second hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1 (the
region of HLA that binds to antigen) has been associated with both GCA and
PMR. This polymorphism is not seen in RA patients.2
310

• Infections may play an influential role in GCA development.
Cyclic (every 5–7 years) peaks of the incidence of GCA suggest that some
triggering event such as infection may be important.3
Gamma-herpes virus infections in interferon-γ receptor deficient mice
promote a large-vessel vasculitis.4
An association with parvovirus B19 has also been proposed.5
Pathophysiology

• Cell-mediated processes appear to drive GCA pathology.
T cells in particular may play an important role, as the majority of vesselinfiltrating lymphocytes are CD4 T cells.6
In addition to T cells, alterations of dendritic cell function have been
identified.7
Macrophages play multiple roles, such as secretion of interleukin (IL)-1, IL6, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β; promoting oxidative damage;
producing nitric oxide; and generating giant cells.6
Components of the humoral immune response appear to be less important. B
cells are not found in GCA lesions, and hypergammaglobulinemia and
autoantibodies are not found in patient sera.6

• Cytokines, particularly IL-6, may play an underappreciated role in disease
activity.
IL-6 levels strongly correlate with disease activity.8
mRNA levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and IL-1β within involved arteries
correlate with ischemic symptoms (vision compromise or jaw claudication),
while serum IL-2 levels associate with PMR.9

• The pathology within vasculitic lesions of GCA explains the mechanism of
vascular compromise.
The vasculitic lesion contains a mononuclear cell infiltrate comprised of T
cells and macrophages that is present initially in the adventitia, and
subsequently in all layers of the arterial wall. As the inflammatory response
progresses, the media of the arterial wall thins while the intima becomes
hyperplastic. This is a mechanism of vascular compromise, in addition to
platelet aggregation.
The infiltrates may be granulomatous (particularly in the media), being
311

characterized by the presence of histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells.
While the presence of giant cells led to the naming of this disease, they
are typically absent.
When present, they are found close to the fragmented internal elastic
lamina. This correlates with elevated platelet-derived growth factor
(PDGF) levels and increased risk of ischemic complications.10
The presence of fibrinoid necrosis should suggest another type of vasculitic
process.
Risk Factors

• Age is the greatest risk factor for both GCA.
• Female gender is associated with GCA.
• Ethnicity is another risk factor for GCA development. Patients of Northern
European descent are 2.5- to 4-fold more likely than Southern Europeans, and
7.5- to 25-fold more likely than Hispanics and African-Americans to develop
GCA.11
Prevention
No known preventive measures have been identified for GCA.
DIAGNOSIS

• It is rare to have GCA in individuals <50 years of age.
• Headache is the most common presenting symptom for GCA, while jaw
claudication mostly highly predicts a positive temporal artery biopsy.

• Anyone suspected to have GCA should be started on high-dose oral or
intravenous glucocorticoid therapy, even if the temporal artery biopsy has not
yet been performed.

• If the temporal artery biopsy is negative, but suspicion for GCA remains high,
treat as if the patient has GCA and consider biopsy of the other temporal
artery.

• GCA should also be considered in patients >50 years of age with fever of
unknown origin.
312

Clinical Presentation
History

• In GCA, the onset of symptoms tends to be gradual rather than abrupt.
• Cranial arteritis: 80% to 90% of all GCA cases present with cranial arteritis.
Headache: over half of the patients will have a chief complaint of headache.
Characterized as throbbing, sharp, or dull.
Located classically over the temporal regions, but can be seen over the
occipital or frontal lobes, or be generalized.
Temporal tenderness: Individuals may also complain about temporal
tenderness when wearing eyeglasses or lying on a pillow.
Jaw claudication: 50% of patients will complain of fatigue or pain while
eating, or trismus-like symptoms.
Patients may not recognize the significance of this, so they must be asked
directly.
Symptoms are due to reduced blood flow through the extracranial branches
of the carotid artery supplying the masseter or temporalis muscles.
A striking feature of GCA-associated jaw claudication is how quickly
fatigue begins upon chewing, and how disabling the pain can be.
Jaw claudication may be the most specific symptom for cranial arteritis.
Fifty-four percent of those with jaw claudication had a positive temporal
artery biopsy, while only three percent of those with a negative biopsy had
jaw claudication.12
Systemic complaints:
50% will have low-grade fever (>37.7 °C), while 15% have fevers >39
°C.13
15% of elderly patients with fever of unknown origin are diagnosed with
GCA.13
10% of patients will have constitutional symptoms or laboratory evidence
of inflammation as the only symptoms/signs of GCA.14
Visual complaints: a wide variety of manifestations occur in GCA.
Vision loss is sudden, painless and usually permanent.
Amaurosis fugax is a temporary monocular loss of vision caused by focal
ophthalmic artery lesions. This leads to transient ischemia of the retina,
choroid, or optic nerve, or a combination of the above. Patients will
313

report visual blurring (associated with heat, exercise, or posture) and
diplopia. If left untreated, the other eye will likely be affected in 1 to 2
weeks.
Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) may follow an episode of
amaurosis fugax. It is due to compromise of blood flow through the
posterior ciliary artery leading to acute ischemia of the optic nerve head.
Typically presenting unilaterally, the other eye can be affected within days
or weeks if left untreated. While AION is the most common ocular
presentation of GCA, only 5% of AION patients have GCA.
Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a rare (approximately 5%)
etiology for the cause of blindness in GCA. This is due to compromised
blood flow to the retrobulbar portion of the optic nerve.
Despite effective therapy, vision loss occurs in one or both eyes in 15% to
20% of GCA patients. This is due in part to the fact that blindness may be
the presenting symptom.
Diplopia can occur not only from amaurosis fugax, but also from ischemic
injury to the oculomotor system or extraocular muscles, paresis of ocular
motor nerves, and brainstem disease.
Bitemporal hemianopia occurs when arteries supplying the optic chiasm
are damaged.
Homonymous hemianopia (vision defect involving either the two right or
left halves of the visual field) results from damage to vessels feeding the
retrochiasmal visual sensory pathways. In GCA, this most commonly
occurs from lesions in the vertebrobasilar circulation, leading to occipital
lobe infarction.
Visual hallucinations can be induced by glucocorticoid-associated
psychosis or from Charles Bonnet syndrome (the presence of visual
hallucinations in psychologically normal patients due to vision loss from
peripheral or central vision pathway lesions).
Musculoskeletal complaints:
PMR (see later for symptoms) is observed in 40% to 50% of GCA
patients, but only 15% of PMR patients have GCA. Five percent of
patients considered to have isolated PMR will have a positive temporal
artery biopsy.
Peripheral synovitis and peripheral edema of the distal extremities are
also seen in a minority of GCA patients. These symptoms can mimic
314

seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or remitting seronegative
symmetrical synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE) (see Differential
Diagnosis).
Neurologic complaints: Neurologic manifestations occur in 20% to 30%.
Transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and strokes are typically due to
extradural internal carotid (less common) or vertebral artery (more
common) vasculitic lesions. Aortic dissection can also compromise blood
flow through these vessels leading to symptoms.
Vertigo and hearing loss can also occur with vertebral or carotid artery
involvement.
Intracranial vasculitis is extremely rare (<1%).

• Large-vessel GCA: Represents 10% to 15% of all GCA cases, and typically
lacks cranial involvement. These patients are marginally younger (mean age =
66 years), have fewer complaints of headache, and more likely to present with
arm claudication. Fifty percent of these patients will have had a negative
temporal artery biopsy.
Aortic arch syndrome: Observed with involvement of the subclavian and
axillary arteries.
Arm claudication is the most common symptom, seen in 51% of largevessel GCA patients.
Absent or asymmetric pulses and paresthesias may also be seen.
Aortitis
Active aortitis was observed in 50% of GCA patients postmortem as well
as at surgery, most commonly affects the ascending aorta, which can lead
to dilatation of the aortic valve.
Aneurysms (particularly thoracic, can present similarly to Takayasu’s
arteritis [see Chapter 21, Takayasu’s Arteritis]) and dissections (due to
chronic aortitis) are the most significant complications.
There is a 17-fold increased incidence of thoracic aortic aneurysm
development, which occurs in approximately 10% of GCA patients.15
Similarities between GCA and Takayasu’s arteritis highlight the possibility
that they are part of a spectrum of the same disease.
Physical Examination

• GCA patients are typically chronically ill appearing, often with fever.
315

• Temporal artery abnormalities:
Decreased or absent pulses: If pulse was absent, likelihood ratio (LR) of a
positive temporal artery biopsy was 2.7 over a patient without this finding.16
Tender or thickened artery: If the patient had a prominent or enlarged
temporal artery, the LR = 4.3; if tender, LR = 2.6.16
Even in the absence of physical examination findings relative to the temporal
artery, 33% will still have a positive temporal artery biopsy.17

• Ophthalmologic findings:
May be normal in those with amaurosis fugax.
Cotton wool spots can be seen at areas of vascular lesions.
Swollen pale optic disc with blurred margins in those with acute vision loss
from AION.
Optic atrophy and pale, flat disc in those with permanent blindness from
AION. These patients will also have a relative afferent pupillary defect
(Marcus Gunn pupil manifested by positive swinging flashlight sign).

• Cardiovascular findings:
Bruits may be heard on auscultation of supraclavicular, carotid, axillary,
brachial, and femoral areas.
Aortic regurgitation murmur may indicate an ascending aortic aneurysm.
Diminished pulses in the extremities may be associated with asymmetric
blood pressures in affected extremities.

• Musculoskeletal (see Polymyalgia Rheumatica later).
Diagnostic Criteria

• No true diagnostic criteria exist for GCA. The ACR criteria, though, can
influence the decision to proceed with subsequent temporal artery biopsy.

• The following clinical findings were effective in distinguishing GCA from
other forms of vasculitis18,19:
Age ≥50 years at time of disease onset.
Localized headache of new onset.
Tenderness or decreased pulse of temporal artery.
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >50 mm/hour.
316

Biopsy revealing necrotizing arteritis with a predominance of mononuclear
cells or a granulomatous process with multinucleated giant cells.

• If a patient has an existing diagnosis of vasculitis, the presence of three of these
five criteria is associated with 94% sensitivity and 91% specificity for the
diagnosis of GCA.18

• There is a 95% probability for a negative temporal artery biopsy with the
following findings20:
ESR <40 mm/hour.
No jaw claudication.
No temporal artery tenderness.
Presence of synovitis.
Differential Diagnosis

• The differential diagnosis for GCA includes:
Other large-vessel vasculitides (such as Takayasu’s arteritis, which does not
involve the temporal artery).
Polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener’s granulomatosis or CNS vasculitis (if
involving the temporal artery).
Amyloidosis (presenting as jaw or arm claudication if vascular involvement
of the temporal or subclavian artery occurs).
Nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAAION) has low
inflammatory markers and is associated with hypertension, diabetes mellitus,
and sildenafil use.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• No single laboratory test is pathognomonic for diagnosing GCA, but they can
strongly suggest the presence of disease. Laboratory abnormalities resolve
with glucocorticoid treatment.

• Complete blood count (CBC)
Normocytic anemia is usually present at diagnosis of GCA. Interestingly, the
white blood cell (WBC) count is generally normal despite systemic signs of
inflammation.
317

• Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP)
Transaminitis and an elevation in alkaline phosphatase are seen in 25% to
35% of GCA patients; serum albumin levels are usually normal.21

• ESR and C-reactive protein (CRP)
Significant elevations of ESR and CRP values are characteristically seen in
GCA.
In GCA, a normal ESR reduces the probability of a positive temporal artery
biopsy by 5-fold.16 An ESR <40 mm/hour correlates to fewer systemic
systems, but does not reduce the likelihood of visual loss in those with GCA.
In GCA, the CRP usually correlates with ESR values.

• IL-6
IL-6 concentrations closely correlate with clinical disease in GCA and
more strongly predict relapse than ESR. IL-6 testing is not yet widespread,
and its clinical usefulness is unclear.8
Imaging

• For GCA-associated cranial arteritis, imaging is typically not necessary.
Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has been utilized to identify areas of
temporal artery inflammation, helping to guide temporal artery biopsy.

• If large-vessel GCA is suspected, the study of choice is MRA. Aortic,
carotid, subclavian, and other large vessels can be visualized for the presence
of vessel wall edema.
While MRA has been investigated in tracking disease activity and in the
evaluation of response to treatment, vessel wall edema has not been always
associated with disease activity or helpful in identifying new lesions.
Therefore, its use should always be in conjunction with clinical findings in
the setting of GCA.
While currently investigational, the future use of positron emission
tomography (PET) may be beneficial in the identification of large-vessel
GCA.

• The role of conventional angiography has been limited with the use of MRA. It
does play a role in those with large-vessel GCA in all the four extremities
where peripheral blood pressure measurements are unreliable. Aortography
with central aortic pressure measurements may be useful in this setting.

318

• Ultrasound has shown mixed success in GCA, and is unreliable at this time.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard in establishing the diagnosis of
GCA, and should be done in all patients suspected to have GCA.

• Sensitivity of temporal artery biopsy is 94%.18
• The predictive value of a positive biopsy was significantly increased in
patients with jaw claudication, and higher yet with the addition of headache,
scalp tenderness or vision changes.22

• A 2-cm length of the temporal artery should be obtained unless the artery is
visibly abnormal, where a smaller segment can yield the diagnosis.
Complications are rare with this procedure.

• Full tissue processing should be performed, as there may be “skip” lesions.
• Controversy exists whether to obtain unilateral or bilateral temporal artery
biopsy samples.
Unilateral biopsy is usually sufficient to diagnose GCA, missing only 13% of
cases compared to bilateral biopsies.23,24

• We suggest the following algorithm to decide on unilateral versus bilateral
temporal artery biopsies (as proposed by the European League Against
Rheumatism)25:
If an obvious temporal artery abnormality is present on examination, or
headache is unilateral, biopsy of that vessel should be performed.
If there are no localizing hints, obtain a unilateral temporal artery biopsy.
If the unilateral biopsy result is negative, and clinical suspicion remains high,
biopsy of the contralateral temporal artery should be considered.
Patient preference may play a role in the decision to obtain a simultaneous
bilateral biopsy.
Regardless, treatment for GCA should be initiated before the biopsy is
scheduled. The inflammatory infiltrate resolves slowly after starting
prednisone, usually not resolving for weeks to months.

• Recognize that negative biopsies do not exclude the possibility of largevessel GCA (look for arm claudication in those patients).

• Biopsy of other vessels: Temporal arteries are typically biopsied since they
319

are easily accessible. If other vessels are abnormal (such as the facial or
occipital arteries), then those can also be biopsied.
TREATMENT
The goal of treatment for GCA is to avoid AION. Unfortunately, once vision has
been lost, the likelihood of significant visual improvement is small (<10%). Thus,
prevention of vision loss is of paramount importance.
Medications
Glucocorticoids

• The standard of care is glucocorticoids, despite the lack of placebo-controlled
studies. Its efficacy in GCA has been established through many years of use
and the known consequences of untreated disease.

• Glucocorticoids must be started immediately once a patient has been
suspected to have GCA, even before the diagnosis has been confirmed. This
is especially true if the patient has recent or potential vascular complications.
Nevertheless, temporal artery biopsies should be obtained as quickly as
possible.

• The optimal initial dose is unclear, but virtually all cases should be started on a
minimum of prednisone 40 to 60 mg PO daily.

• Daily dosing is more efficacious than alternate day dosing. Splitting a single
daily dose into multiple doses during the day is no more effective than single
daily dosing.

• The use of intravenous glucocorticoids (15 mg/kg/day of methylprednisolone
for three doses) has been investigated in a small randomized, double-blind,
placebo-controlled study, concluding that those receiving methylprednisolone
had26:
Higher rates of sustained remission following the discontinuation of
glucocorticoid therapy.
Higher likelihood of achieving and maintaining low doses of prednisone (≤5
mg/day) at 9, 12, and 15 months following initial loading dose.
Lower median total glucocorticoid dose (excluding the initial loading dose).
Those with vision loss at diagnosis did not improve significantly with
parenteral glucocorticoids.
320

In summary, while the use of parenteral glucocorticoids for those with visual
dysfunction has not been rigorously tested, we believe that it is appropriate
to use pulse-dose glucocorticoids for these patients.

• Patients should be maintained on the starting dose of glucocorticoids for at
least 2 to 4 weeks or whenever disease activity resolves, whichever comes
later. A slow taper should follow this over the next 9 to 18 months.
Typically, patients will report resolution of symptoms 24 to 48 hours after
treatment initiation (with the exception of vision loss from AION).
Laboratory measures of inflammation will also begin to normalize during this
time.
The tapering of prednisone should be done with the goal of avoiding flares.
A reasonable initial goal for prednisone tapering is to reach 20 mg/day at
2 months of therapy.
The tapering schedule will slow down after this. Usually, once 10 mg/day is
reached, decrease the dose by 1 mg every month, so that the full course of
treatment is 9 to 12 months in total.
If a patient flares during the tapering process, redosing with the initial
starting dose should be done with a slower tapering schedule afterwards.
Patients rarely flare at doses >15 mg/day, but unfortunately commonly do
below this dose.
Aspirin
The use of daily low-dose aspirin to reduce the risk of vision loss, TIA, and stroke
has been recommended.27 This benefit appears to be due to its antiplatelet effect.
Other Medications

• Methotrexate (MTX)
Data from three randomized trials tested whether MTX can be used as a
steroid-sparing agent with conflicting results.28–30
The use of MTX for GCA is not recommended at this time.

• Infliximab
One randomized trial showed a lack of efficacy for tumor necrosis factor
(TNF) inhibition in GCA.31

• Tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti–IL-6 antibody, has shown efficacy in a few
321

case reports.32
COMPLICATIONS

• Other than visual loss, no long-term complications typically occur directly from
GCA as the disease is self-limited over months or years.

• Most complications occur as a result of prolonged glucocorticoid use, and
should be addressed as necessary. One should anticipate side effects from
prolonged use of prednisone therapy (see Chapter 9, Drugs Used for the
Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases).
Hyperglycemia, weight gain, infection, hypertension, and other side effects
must be monitored.
Loss of bone integrity or frank osteoporosis can also occur. Screen with bone
density scans and prophylactic treatment with calcium, vitamin D, and an
appropriate osteoporotic medication (see Chapter 48, Osteoporosis).
REFERRAL

• Those suspected with GCA should be immediately referred to a rheumatologist.
If there is strong suspicion of disease or if there are vision symptoms, inpatient
management with rheumatology consultation is warranted.

• Anyone requiring prolonged glucocorticoid use should be referred to a
rheumatologist for medication toxicity monitoring.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Patients must be informed of the side effects associated with prednisone and
appropriately managed to avoid long-term complications.

• Recognition of symptoms of GCA must be emphasized to patients to aid in flare
identification.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Monitoring for disease activity is challenging in GCA. It can be difficult to
assess the presence of flares in the setting of a prednisone taper.
322

• Following ESR and CRP is very useful, but they are imperfect markers of
disease activity, as not everyone mirrors clinical activity with these labs.
When the ESR or CRP is elevated, question the patient regarding any
symptoms related to GCA. Close follow-up is warranted in this setting.
IL-6 may prove to be a more reliable measure of disease activity than ESR,
although the clinical usefulness of this assay has not been thoroughly
assessed.8

• Yearly chest radiography to evaluate for aortic aneurysms should be done for at
least 10 years following the initial diagnosis. If dilatation is present, chest CT
every 6 to 12 months should be performed.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Prognosis is typically very good in those with timely and appropriate treatment.
• Some may need life-long low-dose glucocorticoid therapy for suppressing
GCA disease activity.

• In those without visual compromise, new presentation of vision loss is
uncommon once treatment has begun (<1%).

• In those with preexisting visual defects from GCA, the incidence of
contralateral vision loss is estimated to be 13% over the next 5 years, even
with appropriate treatment.33 Age >80 is the most significant risk factor for this
outcome.

• Overall survival appears not to be affected in those with GCA.
POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• PMR is a musculoskeletal syndrome seen in individuals >50 years of age
manifested by symmetric pain and stiffness in the muscles of the neck,
torso, shoulders, and hip girdle for at least 4 weeks.
It is associated with signs of systemic inflammation, elevated ESR and CRP,
and anemia.
PMR is closely related to GCA, and is often considered a form of GCA that
323

lacks fully developed vasculitis.
PMR responds very well to low-dose oral glucocorticoid therapy.
Definition
PMR is a syndrome characterized by symmetric aching and morning stiffness on the
shoulder and hip girdles, neck and torso in individuals >50 years old with an ESR
>50 mm/hour.
Epidemiology

• PMR is seen almost exclusively in older individuals. Mean age at diagnosis is
>70 years.

• Like, GCA, it is rare to have PMR in individuals <50 years old.
• Women are affected —two to three times more often than men.
• 15% of PMR patients develop GCA.
Etiology

• The pathogenesis of PMR is unknown.
• Genetic factors have been correlated with PMR.
A polymorphism in the second hypervariable region of HLA-DRB1 (the
region of HLA that binds to antigen) has been associated with PMR.2
Other genetic polymorphisms in intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1,
TNF-α, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), or carriage of certain
alleles, such as the PIA2 allele of the platelet glycoprotein IIIa gene, may also
be associated with PMR.34–37
Pathophysiology
The pathophysiology driving PMR is unknown.
Risk Factors

• Age is the greatest risk factor for PMR.
• Female gender is associated with PMR.
324

Prevention
No known preventive measures have been identified for PMR.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• PMR is characterized by the subacute or chronic onset of symmetric morning
stiffness and achiness of the shoulder and hip girdles, neck, and torso.

• Morning stiffness and tenderness last >30 minutes, leading to difficulties
dressing or turning over in bed. It is thought to be due to bursitis and/or
synovitis.

• Pain occurs in shoulders more than in hips or neck. It is worse with movement
and can interfere with sleep. It may be associated with subjective weakness.

• Sleep is often disrupted.
• Systemic symptoms occur in up to 40% of patients, and include malaise,
depression, anorexia and weight loss, and fever (almost always low grade
unless GCA is present).
Physical Examination

• Pain with active range of motion of shoulders, neck, and hips.
• Tenderness to palpation of shoulders.
• Synovitis occurs in knees, wrists, and metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint, and
is typically mild, asymmetric, and nonerosive. It is also seen in 15% to 20% of
GCA patients.

• Tenosynovitis and peripheral edema occur most commonly in hands, wrists,
ankles, and the dorsum of feet, and are thought to represent regional
tenosynovitis. Carpal tunnel syndrome is seen in 10% to 15% of patients.
Diagnostic Criteria

• No diagnostic criteria exist for PMR, but the following have been suggested to
strongly support the diagnosis19:

325

Age >50.
ESR >40, or elevated CRP in the setting of normal ESR.
One month duration of morning stiffness >30 minutes and bilateral aching of
the two of the following three areas: neck/torso, shoulders/proximal arms,
and hip/proximal thighs.
Prompt responsiveness (within 3 days) to low-dose glucocorticoid therapy
(10–20 mg/day prednisone) has been suggested by some as another criterion.
Differential Diagnosis

• Early seronegative RA is the most common alternative diagnosis in patients
presenting with symptoms consistent with PMR.
RA patients will have more swollen joints of the hands, wrists and feet and
usually only a partial response to low-dose prednisone compared to PMR
patients. PMR patients will have complete resolution of any swollen joints
and a more rapid decrease in acute phase reactants with low-dose
prednisone.
Nevertheless, there is considerable symptom overlap between seronegative
RA and PMR, making the diagnosis difficult at times.

• Other diagnoses mimicking PMR include:
Remitting seronegative symmetric synovitis with pitting edema (RS3PE)
Bursitis/tendonitis
Spondyloarthropathy
Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD)
Hypothyroidism
Fibromyalgia and depression
Malignancy (such as multiple myeloma)
Infective endocarditis
Inflammatory myopathy (pain is usually not a feature; creatine kinase is
normal in PMR)
Parkinson disease
Hyperparathyroidism
Diagnostic Testing
326

Laboratories

• Similar to GCA, no single laboratory test independently diagnoses PMR, but
can strongly suggest the presence of disease. Laboratory abnormalities resolve
with glucocorticoid treatment.

• Normocytic anemia is usually present at diagnosis of PMR. The WBC count is
generally normal despite systemic signs of inflammation.

• ESR and CRP are typically significantly elevated.
Imaging

• For PMR, imaging is typically not required. Nevertheless, MRI and ultrasound
have been shown to demonstrate inflammation of extraarticular synovial
structures such as tenosynovitis or shoulder bursitis with effusion.

• Plain films of affected joints do not usually reveal abnormalities.
Diagnostic Procedures
No invasive diagnostic procedures aid in the diagnosis of PMR.
TREATMENT
Medications

• The goal of treatment is resolution of symptoms.
• A prompt response (within 24–48 hours) to glucocorticoid therapy is highly
characteristic of PMR.
Prednisone

• Initial dosing of prednisone 15 mg PO daily is sufficient for most patients, but
this may range from 10 to 20 mg/day.38
Symptom reduction should be evident within 3 days of treatment, often
overnight.
Maintain the initial dose of prednisone for 2 to 4 weeks.
If symptoms are not well controlled, increase prednisone by 5 mg/day up to
30 mg/day.
An alternative diagnosis should be entertained if little or no symptom
relief is obtained with prednisone dose of 20 mg/day or higher.
327

• Generally, maintenance dosing and prednisone tapering protocols lack
consensus. We recommend:
For those receiving ≥15 mg/day, reduce prednisone by 5 mg/day every 2 to 4
weeks to 15 mg/day.
For those receiving 10 to 15 mg/day, reduce by 2.5 mg/day every month.
For those receiving ≤10 mg/day, reduce by 1 mg/day every month.
Flares typically occur if tapering is too rapid. Restart prednisone at
approximately the last dose that achieved complete symptom control, and
restart tapering at a slower rate (every 2–3 months).
If a flare occurs off prednisone, the patient may need to completely restart the
initial dosing and tapering protocol.
Continue low-dose prednisone for at least 1 year to minimize the risk of
relapse after discontinuation.
Other Therapies

• MTX
Inconsistent results have been observed in those receiving MTX with
prednisone compared to prednisone alone. Its use in PMR is typically not
recommended.

• Etanercept
In two very small observational studies and one small randomized trial,
etanercept has demonstrated modest efficacy.39–41

• Infliximab
In contrast to etanercept, infliximab in combination with prednisone did not
demonstrate superiority compared to prednisone alone. Ann Intern Med.
2007;146:631–639.42

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs may be effective in some as glucocorticoid-sparing therapy, but
drug-related side effects limit their use in this elderly patient population.
NSAIDs may be used as adjunct therapy with low-dose prednisone for
osteoarthritis or tendonitis pain, but great care must be used to avoid
gastrointestinal side effects. Concurrent proton-pump inhibitor (PPI)
administration should be strongly encouraged.

328

COMPLICATIONS

• No long-term complications typically occur directly from GCA or PMR as the
disease is self-limited over months or years.

• Most complications occur as a result of prolonged glucocorticoid use, and
should be addressed as necessary. One should anticipate side effects from
prolonged use of prednisone therapy (see Chapter 9, Drugs Used for the
Treatment of Rheumatic Diseases).
Hyperglycemia, weight gain, infection, hypertension, and other side effects
must be monitored.
Loss of bone integrity or frank osteoporosis can also occur. Screen with bone
density scans and prophylactic treatment with calcium, vitamin D, and an
appropriate osteoporotic medication (see Chapter 48, Osteoporosis).
REFERRAL
Anyone requiring prolonged glucocorticoid use should be referred to a
rheumatologist for medication toxicity monitoring.
Patient Education

• Patients must be informed of the side effects associated with prednisone and
appropriately managed to avoid long-term complications.

• Recognition of symptoms of GCA must be emphasized to PMR patients.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Monitoring for symptoms in PMR is the best method for picking up flares.
Interpretation of ESR and CRP values must be done in the context of the
patient’s clinical presentation.

• Those with PMR should be continuously monitored for symptoms of GCA.
4.4% of those with “isolated” PMR had positive temporal artery biopsies.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Overall survival appears not to be affected in those with PMR.
329

• Glucocorticoid therapy for PMR typically lasts for 2 to 3 years, but some may
need long-term low-dose (<10 mg/day) treatment. Spontaneous relapse occurs
in up to 25% of patients regardless of glucocorticoid dosing, particularly in the
first two years.

Polyarteritis Nodosa
Maria C. Gonzalez-Mayda and
John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Formal diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) requires the presence of three
out of the ten criteria listed in Table 23-1. Of these, a biopsy or angiogram
demonstrating vasculitis of small- to medium-sized vessels particularly helps
solidify the diagnosis.

• Mesenteric and renal angiography is sensitive and specific for PAN with
gastrointestinal (GI) and kidney involvement.

• Classic PAN spares the lungs and glomeruli.
Definition
Defined by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference as a necrotizing inflammation of
medium- or small-sized arteries, without glomerulonephritis or vasculitis of the
arterioles, capillaries, or venules.1
Epidemiology

• Affects men more frequently than women, between ages 40 to 60, with peak
around 50 years of age.

• Classic PAN is rare with an estimated annual incidence rate of 2.0 to 9.0 per
million.
Etiology

• Most cases of PAN are idiopathic.
• A substantial minority of cases are caused by the Hepatitis B virus (HBV).
The prevalence rates of PAN are higher in populations with endemic HBV
334

infection. Consequently, the widespread use of HBV vaccines has decreased
the rate of HBV-related PAN.

• PAN has also been linked to other viral infections, especially HIV and
Hepatitis C virus (HCV).
In a cohort of 161 patients with HCV-related vasculitis, 31 of them (19.3%)
were classified as having PAN.3
HCV-PAN was associated with a more acute and severe clinical presentation
as well as a higher rate of clinical remission when compared to HCV-related
mixed cryoglobulinemia (HCV-MC).
When compared to HBV-PAN, HCV-PAN was seen more frequently in an
older female population, with a higher prevalence of skin involvement and
relapse rate, and a worse prognosis.

• Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and
hairy cell leukemia have been linked to PAN.
TABLE 23-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1990
CRITERIA FOR POLYARTERITIS NODOSA

Pathophysiology

• The mechanism of PAN is not well understood but typically involves
circulating foreign antigens, antibodies, Fc receptors, and complement.
335

• It appears to involve immune complex–mediated damage to vessel walls.
• In those patients with HBV-related PAN, hepatitis B surface antigen/antibody
interaction triggers activation of the complement cascade and Fcg receptors.

• The clinical symptoms of PAN result from systemic manifestations secondary
to the release of cytokines as well as from local inflammation and vessel
damage.

• The pathologic lesion is a focal segmental necrotizing vasculitis of mediumand small-sized arteries. This inflammation commonly leads to disruption of
the elastic lamina of the vessel wall with subsequent weakening and formation
of microaneurysms, endothelial dysfunction, thrombosis, and stenosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The presentation of PAN may be nonspecific.
• Most of the patients develop systemic symptoms of inflammation (e.g.,
malaise, arthralgias, myalgias, fever, and/or weight loss) along with localized
signs and symptoms of vasculitis (e.g., peripheral neuropathy and GI, testicular
and/or cutaneous manifestations).

• Most of the patients present with acute illness and severe manifestations.
• HBV-related PAN:
Patients tend to be <40 years old and have a more acute and fulminant form of
PAN than those with PAN without HBV.
Malignant hypertension (HTN), renal infarction, and orchitis are more
common in HBV-related PAN.
PAN tends to precede hepatitis which is usually clinically silent at the time of
the vasculitis.
Seroconversion often leads to remission of PAN.

• Limited forms of PAN:
Cutaneous PAN (CPAN) refers to a chronic cutaneous vasculitis of medium
vessels with histologic features similar to PAN but without systemic
vascular involvement.
These patients also usually present with extra-cutaneous manifestations,
which include myalgias, arthralgias, malaise, fever, and neuropathy.
336

Clinical manifestations of CPAN include livedo reticularis, tender
subcutaneous nodules, ulcers, and necrosis.
A workup to exclude systemic involvement is required before the
diagnosis of CPAN can be made.
Treatment ranges from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and
colchicine to steroids and other immunosuppressive agents, depending on
the severity of symptoms.
Its course tends to be chronic with remissions and relapses. Overall, it has
a favorable prognosis, and rarely converts into systemic PAN.
Rarely, microaneurysms and stenoses limited to single organs without
systemic involvement occur.4
History

• Given the systemic involvement in PAN, a thorough history and a detailed
review of systems are indicated.

• Skin: Inquire about the appearance of tender, erythematous nodules, bullous or
vesicular lesions, ulcerations, and/or digital ischemia/gangrene.

• Musculoskeletal: Inquire about myalgias, muscle weakness, and claudication.
• Cardiovascular: Inquire about hypertension, chest pain, and dyspnea on
exertion as microaneurysm and thrombi formation as well as myocardial
ischemia and coronary dissection may occur secondary to PAN.

• GI: Inquire about abdominal pain, especially after a meal, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea, and melena.
Pain may be intermittent or continuous. This may be indicative of mesenteric
vasculitis with subsequent bowel wall ischemia, ulceration, and/or
perforation.
The most commonly involved portion is the small bowel.

• Kidney: Renal ischemia secondary to vasculitis of the medium-sized muscular
arteries leads to hypertension through the activation of the renin–angiotensin
system.
Hematuria has been reported; however, red blood cell (RBC) casts and other
signs of glomerulonephritis are not common in PAN.
Their presence along with pulmonary symptoms such as hemoptysis merits
consideration of a vasculitis affecting primarily the smaller vessels such as
337

microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) or Wegener’s granulomatosis.

• Neurologic: The most common symptom is mononeuritis multiplex, present in
>70% of patients, which may be the presenting symptom.
Characterized by an asymmetric sensory and motor peripheral neuropathy
caused by ischemia and inflammation to the vasa nervorum supplying the
affected nerve.
The lower limbs, especially the sciatic nerve and its peroneal and tibial
branches, are most commonly affected.
Hypoesthesia or hyperesthesia and pain are present in the areas of motor
deficits.
The motor deficits may be abrupt and may precede the sensory symptoms.
Cranial nerve and central nervous system (CNS) involvement are rare but
may include cranial nerve palsies and hemorrhagic or ischemic strokes.

• Acute inflammatory orchitis: PAN should be considered in the differential
diagnosis.
Physical Examination

• A thorough physical examination is necessary in order to determine which
organs are involved and the extent of vascular lesions.

• It is also important to seek the presence of additional disease processes that
may be mimicking PAN.

• Skin: Cutaneous manifestations of classic PAN are uncommon and variable.
They include palpable purpura, which is usually papular/petechial and
sometimes bullous or vesicular, livedo reticularis, tender subcutaneous
nodules, and distal gangrene.

• GI: The stool should be checked for occult blood.
• Renal: New onset hypertension may be indicative of renal involvement.
• Neurologic: Test especially for motor weakness and sensory deficits.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The diagnosis of PAN is based on the presence of systemic features as well as
either an abnormal angiogram demonstrating the presence of aneurysms or
thrombosis and/or a biopsy showing vasculitic involvement of the small- or
338

medium-sized vessels.

• The American College of Rheumatology criteria are presented in Table 23-1.
Differential Diagnosis

• Multiple conditions can mimic PAN, which is why a broad differential must
be considered and evaluated during your workup. These include the following:
Viral infections such as hepatitis B and C, HIV, cytomegalovirus (CMV),
parvovirus B19, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus 1 (HTLV-1).
Connective tissue diseases (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid
arthritis, Sjögren’s syndrome, mixed connective tissue disease, and systemic
sclerosis) may present like PAN.
Bacterial endocarditis, cholesterol embolization, sepsis, and malignancy
should also be excluded.
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides such
as MPA may have signs and symptoms similar to PAN, but are distinguished
by small-vessel vasculitis in the pulmonary and renal vasculature, normal
visceral angiography, presence of ANCA and the greater tendency to relapse
(see Chapter 26, Microscopic Polyangiitis).
PAN has been associated with MDS, chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and
hairy cell leukemia. The course of MDS tends to be more severe if
associated with PAN.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) >50 mm/hour and an elevated C-reactive
protein (CRP) >10 mg/L.

• Leukocytosis.
• Hypereosinophilia (seen in 10%–30% of patients).
• Normocytic normochromic anemia of chronic inflammation.
• Mild renal insufficiency, hypertension, non-nephrotic range proteinuria, and
mild hematuria.
Active urinary sediment is not a feature of PAN.

339

• Check hepatitis serologies and investigate other causes of PAN as appropriate.
• Positive tests for ANCA are uncommon with PAN (<30%).
Imaging

• Visceral angiography may be useful to demonstrate microaneurysms and
stenoses in small- to medium-sized vessels, usually in the renal, mesenteric,
and/or hepatic arterial systems.

• Angiography may also be helpful, before hepatic or renal biopsies, to identify
microaneurysms and minimize the risk of visceral bleeding.

• Coronary angiography can also reveal microaneurysms in the coronary
arteries.

• In patients with coronary arteritis, a spiral CT scan as well as cardiac MRI
scans may better visualize aneurysms and myocardial ischemia.5
Diagnostic Procedures

• Seek biopsies of the affected organ, if possible.
• Although skin is not routinely involved in PAN, a biopsy is indicated if lesions
are present.

• Full thickness skin biopsy is recommended because it requires tissue as deep
as the subcutaneous fat to capture the small- and medium-sized muscularwalled arteries involved in PAN.

• Another potential site to biopsy is the sural nerve, especially if a lower
extremity neuropathy is present.

• A muscle biopsy of the gastrocnemius muscle should be done concurrently, as it
increases the yield of finding vessel involvement with PAN if the sural nerve
biopsy is negative.
TREATMENT

• Depends on the presence of HBV as well as the assessment of disease activity.
• The French Cooperative Study Group (FCSG) for PAN devised a five-factor
score for determining prognosis.6

• The five parameters predicting higher mortality are:
340

Proteinuria >1 g/day.
Serum creatinine >1.58 mg/dL (140 μmol/L).
Cardiomyopathy.
GI involvement.
CNS involvement.
Medications
First Line

• First line treatment includes oral or intravenous corticosteroids.
• PAN without HBV and with none of the five factors above at the time of
diagnosis can be treated with oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day is a commonly
used starting dose).

• Pulse IV methylprednisolone (1 gm daily for 3–5 days) is usually employed if
there are severe, life-threatening manifestations of vasculitis.

• The addition of immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and
azathioprine has prolonged the survival rates of patients with PAN.
Pulse cyclophosphamide, in addition to corticosteroids, induces remission
with fewer side effects in patients with no poor prognostic factors than oral
cyclophosphamide.
Treat patients with a factor score ≥1 with pulse IV methylprednisolone (1000
mg/ day for 3–5 days) followed by oral prednisone, (1 mg/kg/day), and pulse
IV cyclophosphamide 0.5 to 2.5 g every week to every month depending on
the patient’s condition, renal function, response to previous therapy and
hematologic data.
Reserve oral cyclophosphamide for patients failing IV cyclophosphamide or
for those with fulminant manifestations.
Taper prednisone slowly after the patient’s clinical status improves and the
ESR returns to normal, usually in approximately 1 month. The dose may be
dropped by about 25% every 2 to 4 weeks.
IV cyclophosphamide therapy should in most cases not exceed 1 year when
combined with corticosteroids.
Patients receiving cyclophosphamide should receive prophylaxis for
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with oral trimethoprim 160
mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg, three times per week.
341

Once remission has been achieved with steroids and IV cyclophosphamide,
use azathioprine or methotrexate for 12 to 18 months for maintenance
therapy.7
Second Line

• Consider plasma exchange in refractory cases.
• Management of HBV-related PAN involves treatment of both vasculitis and
HBV infection.
Use steroids in the first few weeks to control the vasculitis, then stop them
abruptly to enhance viral clearance and increase the rate of seroconversion
of HBV e antigen to HBV e antibody. Continued use of steroids and other
immunosuppressants jeopardizes viral clearance and promotes chronic
infection.8,9
Standard anti-HBV agents (e.g., interferon-α 2b, lamivudine) are used in
conjunction.
If seroconversion occurs, remission can be obtained and relapses are rare.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies
In patients with PAN associated with HBV infection, plasma exchange has been used
after corticosteroids are withdrawn to control the symptoms.9
COMPLICATIONS
Complications of PAN vary and depend on which organ systems are involved as
well as how much damage has occurred before treatment.
REFERRAL
Patients with suspected PAN should be immediately referred to a rheumatologist for
further management and treatment.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Follow-up involves clinical and laboratory assessment of disease status and
monitoring of medication side effects and toxicities.

342

• In patients with HBV-related PAN, consultation with a hepatologist is strongly
advised.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• PAN tends to be monophasic.
• Prognosis depends on the number of five-factor score risk factors present.6
Patients with no risk factors have 88% 5-year survival rate.
Patients with one risk factor have 74% 5-year survival rate.
Patients with ≥2 risk factors have 54% 5-year survival rate.

Wegener’s Granulomatosis
Jeffrey Sparks and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) is a systemic vasculitis usually associated
with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA).

• WG most often affects the respiratory tract and then the kidney.
• Treatment involves immunosuppressants and is individually tailored primarily
on the basis of severity of end-organ involvement.
Definition
WG, also known as ANCA-associated granulomatous vasculitis, is defined by the
Chapel Hill Consensus Conference as a granulomatous inflammation involving the
respiratory tract and vasculitis affecting small- to medium-sized vessels, commonly
with a necrotizing glomerulonephritis.1
Classification

• The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends
classification based upon disease severity.2

• Localized: upper and/or lower respiratory tract disease, without any other
systemic involvement or constitutional symptoms.

• Early systemic: without organ-threatening or life-threatening disease.
• Generalized: renal or other organ-threatening disease, serum creatinine <5.6
mg/dL.

• Severe: renal or other vital organ failure, serum creatinine ≥5.6 mg/dL.
• Refractory: progressive disease unresponsive to glucocorticoids alone
(common) and cyclophosphamide (uncommon).

344

Epidemiology

• WG affects men and women equally. WG affects mostly Caucasians. The peak
age of onset is in the 65 to 74 range, though there is wide variation.

• The prevalence has been estimated to be about 10 to 20 cases per million,
although this may underestimate the true prevalence. Milder and more limited
forms are being recognized with the availability of ANCA testing.

• The incidence has been estimated to be about 3 to 14 cases per million.
Pathophysiology

• ANCA is positive in WG about 80% to 90% of the time. The c-ANCA in
WG has been identified as an antibody to proteinase-3 (anti-PR3), a
cytoplasmic glycoprotein present in active form in monocytes and endothelial
cells and in the azurophil granules of neutrophils. PR3 is involved in
neutrophil migration and cytokine modulation.

• The role of c-ANCA in the pathogenesis of WG is controversial. Although
animal studies show that serum anti-PR3 antibodies result in lesions similar to
those found in WG, antibodies to PR-3 are not present in all cases.

• WG is a pauci-immune syndrome in which immune complex deposition and
complement activation are not prominent features.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Initial Phase

• The initial phase is characterized by chronic inflammation, usually in the upper
airways. Sinusitis develops as the initial symptom in >50% of patients and
develops in >85% of patients at some time during the course of illness. Other
nasal symptoms include sinus obstruction, mucosal swelling, hearing loss,
ulcers, septal perforations, epistaxis, serosanguinous discharge and saddle
nose deformity. The sinusitis is commonly progressive and refractory to the
usual therapies and severe. Sinus biopsies rarely show granulomatous
inflammation.

• Granulomatous inflammation may occur in the oral cavity, retrobulbar space
and trachea, especially if mass-type lesions are present.
345

• Laryngotracheal disease can be asymptomatic or present as hoarseness, stridor
or acute airway obstruction. Subglottic stenosis occurs in approximately 15%
of adults and 50% of children.

• Myalgias and arthralgias are common presenting symptoms.
Generalized Phase

• The generalized phase is characterized by systemic signs and symptoms of
small-vessel vasculitis. Fever and weight loss are common.

• Pulmonary disease is a cardinal feature. Cough, hemoptysis, and pleuritis are
common. Pulmonary hemorrhage, infiltrates, cavities, nodules, pleural
effusions, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy may be present.

• Renal disease develops in approximately 80% of patients, usually after
other manifestations. The disease progression can be rapid once
glomerulonephritis develops.

• WG may affect any segment of the urinary tract. Hematuria without RBC casts
usually indicates nonrenal urinary tract involvement.

• Although most patients experience arthralgias, some patients exhibit
migratory polyarthritis.
The pattern of joint involvement is variable and includes monoarticular,
oligoarticular, and polyarticular.
Presentation with symmetric polyarthritis can be mistaken for rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), especially if a positive value for rheumatoid factor (RF) is
obtained.
Low titers of RF are seen in 20% to 40% of patients with WG.

• Neurologic disease develops in approximately 50% of patients but is rarely a
presenting feature.
Mononeuritis multiplex and symmetric polyneuropathy are the most
common patterns.
Cranial neuropathies also occur, with II (optic neuritis), VI, and VII being
the most common.

• Common gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are abdominal pain, diarrhea,
and bleeding from ulcerations in both the small and large intestines.

346

TABLE 24-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1990
CRITERIA FOR WEGENER’S GRANULOMATOSIS

• Cutaneous manifestations are typical of the small-vessel vasculitis and
include palpable purpura, ulcers, subcutaneous nodules, papules, and vesicles.
They tend to parallel disease activity.

• WG can also have ocular manifestations, including keratoconjunctivitis,
scleritis, episcleritis, pseudotumor of the orbit, conjunctivitis, and uveitis.
Diagnostic Criteria
The American College of Rheumatology 1990 classification criteria for WG are
presented in Table 24-1.
Differential Diagnosis

• Cocaine, especially when inhaled with the adulterant levamisole, can induce
pseudovasculitis with nasal, upper airway, and lesions that are similar to WG.
ANCA reacting with human neutrophil elastase (HNE) have been reported to
distinguish the cocaine-related syndrome from a true autoimmune vasculitis.3

• The differential diagnosis of WG should be considered carefully. Inappropriate
diagnosis of WG and subsequent treatment with potent immunosuppressants
may prove fatal if the underlying disease is infectious. Conditions to be
considered include the following:
Granulomatous diseases (tuberculosis, histoplasmosis, blastomycosis,
coccidioidomycosis, sarcoidosis).
Neoplastic diseases (lymphomas, head and neck malignancies, metastatic
adenocarcinoma).
347

Connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, relapsing
polychondritis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, scleroderma, mixed
connective tissue disease, Still’s disease).
Small-vessel vasculitides.
Goodpasture’s disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• The presence of c-ANCA and, more specifically, anti-PR3 antibodies,
supports the diagnosis, although c-ANCA may be negative in earlier and less
fulminant forms of WG.

• Elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrate (BUN) indicate renal
impairment.

• Urinalysis may show hematuria and microscopy may reveal red blood cell
(RBC) casts, indicating glomerulonephritis.

• Markers of inflammation, including elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, and thrombocytosis, are
commonly present in WG.

• Anemia of chronic disease is common in WG.
• Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are rarely present in untreated WG and
should prompt a search for other disorders.

• Complement levels are typically normal or slightly elevated.
Imaging

• Chest imaging:
Perform chest radiography on all patients suspected of having WG;
asymptomatic patients may have significant radiologic abnormalities.
Use chest CT scans in patients with hemoptysis with clear plain films, as
early pulmonary hemorrhage, small areas of cavitation, nodules and
interstitial disease may not be visible on plain films. Chest CT should be
considered in patients with abnormal plain films to further define the extent
of disease.4

• Sinus imaging:
348

Sinus CT scans are superior to plain sinus films to define the extent of
disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Pulmonary function tests with flow volume loops may be useful to define
irreversible extrathoracic or intrathoracic obstruction caused by airway
inflammation leading to tracheal stenosis or collapse.

• Bronchoscopy is useful when pulmonary hemorrhage is present or suspected.
Transbronchial biopsy, bronchoalveolar lavage, and endoscopic inspection of
lesions detected on imaging may be useful in helping to establish the diagnosis
of WG, and also in ruling out infectious mimics.

• The yield of tissue diagnosis for WG depends on the biopsy site, specimen size
and the manner in which the tissue is collected.
Open lung biopsies with adequate tissue are most often diagnostic, showing
the hallmark features of vasculitis, necrosis, and granulomatous
inflammation. The yield of open lung biopsy is highest when larger samples
are obtained and is frequently diagnostic, especially if lesions are
radiographically evident.
Transbronchial biopsies are rarely diagnostic; however, when used in
combination with bronchoalveolar lavage and cultures, they are useful for
ruling out infections that mimic or complicate WG.
Renal biopsy
shows pauci-immune, focal and segmental
glomerulonephritis (FSGN) with occasional medium-vessel vasculitis, and
rarely granulomatous changes. Immunofluorescence studies are negative or
weakly positive for antibody and complement deposition.
Head and neck biopsies, especially sinus biopsies, tend to show chronic,
nonspecific inflammation and are rarely diagnostic. Most specimens are
compatible with, but not diagnostic of, WG, as they show acute and chronic
inflammation.
TREATMENT

• Base the treatment plan on the objective presence of activity, its site, and
severity.

• Lungs, kidney, neuropathic, and vision-threatening ocular disease usually merit
high-dose corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
349

• Corticosteroids alone are inadequate in systemic disease, especially in
patients with renal involvement.
Medications

• Induction therapy:
Oral prednisone, 1 mg/kg daily dose.
Oral cyclophosphamide, approximately 2 mg/kg.
IV methylprednisolone (1000 mg) and higher doses of oral cyclophosphamide
(3–5 mg/kg) may be used for the first three days in cases of immediately lifethreatening fulminant disease (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage or rapidly
progressive glomerulonephritis).
Monthly IV cyclophosphamide has less toxic complications compared to
daily oral cyclophosphamide but may have a higher rate of relapse.
MESNA may be given with oral cyclophosphamide to reduce bladder
toxicity.
Rituximab, weekly for four weeks, with corticosteroids has been shown to
be noninferior to cyclophosphamide and may be superior in preventing
relapse.5

• Maintenance therapy:
Once a remission has been achieved, switch to oral methotrexate (20–25
mg/week) and then taper steroids.
Prednisone and methotrexate (20–25 mg/week) may be used for patients with
significant cyclophosphamide-related side effects or who do not have
immediately life-threatening disease.
Azathioprine, 2 mg/kg, is an alternative to methotrexate for maintenance
therapy.
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), 160 mg/800 mg three times a
week, for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis while on
immunosuppressants.

• Limited upper airway involvement:
Local therapy with nasal irrigation and nasal steroids may be given.
TMP/SMX may also be effective.
Subglottic stenosis is treated with mechanical dilatation and intratracheal
350

injection of a long-acting steroid.

• IV immune globulin and plasmapheresis are generally not thought to be
effective, though plasma exchange is sometimes used for severe pulmonary
hemorrhage, renal vasculitis or concomitant anti-glomerular basement
membrane (GBM) disease.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Follow-up should include laboratory and radiographic studies of upper airway
and lung and renal function.

• ANCA and anti-PR3 antibody levels correlate roughly with disease activity in
large groups of patients, but direct studies of organ function should be the
primary guide to therapy.6

• TMP/SMX, 160 mg/800 mg bid, for 24 months during remission has been
shown to prevent relapses.

• Monitor for toxicity of treatment modalities and opportunistic infections.
• Patients with WG have a high rate of deep vein thrombosis.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• There is considerable variability, mostly depending on the presentation. WG
limited to the upper airway has a better prognosis and higher response rate to
treatment than generalized and severe WG.

• Alveolar hemorrhage and severe renal failure portend the worst prognosis.
• Relapse occurs in as many as 50% of patients.
• Untreated patients have a survival rate of only 20% at 2 years. However, the 2year survival rate for treated patients is about 90%.

• Morbidity of treated WG is related to irreversible organ damage, treatment
toxicity, and opportunistic infections.

Churg–Strauss Syndrome
Lesley Davila and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
The Chapel Hill Consensus Conference defines Churg–Strauss Syndrome (CSS),
also known as allergic granulomatosis and angiitis, as an eosinophil-rich,
granulomatous inflammation involving the respiratory tract and necrotizing vasculitis
affecting small- to medium-sized vessels associated with asthma and peripheral
eosinophilia.
Epidemiology

• CSS is a rare disease with an annual incidence of approximately 2.4 cases per
million.

• CSS affects the sexes equally.
• The asthma associated with CSS usually begins in the fourth or fifth decade but
can occur at any age.
Pathophysiology

• The two diagnostic lesions are arterial and venous vasculitis and
extravascular necrotizing granulomas, usually with eosinophilic infiltration
of tissue. These findings coexist temporally only in few patients.

• The signs and symptoms of CSS are caused by the effects these lesions have on
the involved organ system at a given time and by the systemic effects of
inflammation.

• The most commonly affected organ systems (in decreasing order) are
pulmonary, neurologic, cutaneous, otorhinolaryngeal, musculoskeletal, GI,
cardiac, and renal.

• Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), in particular, the perinuclear
353

antimyeloperoxidase (anti-MPO) variant, has been associated with CSS in
40% to 60% of patients, but its role in pathogenesis is not well understood.
Risk Factors

• An association with leukotriene modifiers (zafirlukast and montelukast) has
been recognized in patients with steroid-dependent asthma who were tapered
from corticosteroids after initiation of the leukotriene modifier.

• Most of these patients had milder airway obstruction and a greater incidence of
acute dilated cardiomyopathy than other patients with CSS.

• It is unclear whether the leukotriene modifiers induced the disease or the
steroid tapering led to expression of patients with preexisting CSS. The latter
seems more likely.1
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Three phases of CSS are described:
The first is a prodrome beginning in childhood and lasting up to 30 years
characterized by allergic rhinitis, sinusitis, and nasal polyposis. Asthma
develops later in life at an average age of 35 years. The asthma is usually
severe and requires systemic corticosteroids.
The second phase is characterized by peripheral blood and tissue
eosinophilia. Löffler’s syndrome (transient, pulmonary, and acute
eosinophilic infiltrates), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and eosinophilic
gastroenteritis are common. The pulmonary infiltrates tend to be peripheral,
patchy, parenchymal, migratory, and transient and may be associated with
eosinophilic pulmonary effusions. However, these are neither sensitive nor
specific pulmonary patterns.
The third phase is characterized by small-vessel vasculitis, with a mean time
of onset of 3 years after the development of asthma. The symptoms are
usually nonspecific, representing constitutional manifestations of systemic
inflammation (e.g., myalgias, arthralgias, fatigue, and weight loss). Asthma
usually worsens during this phase.

• Organ system involvement:
Pulmonary manifestations include asthma, which is present in over 95%
354

of patients with CSS. Asthma is usually difficult to treat and requires
corticosteroids. It usually develops years before other organ involvement.
Later on, eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates, effusions, and rarely pulmonary
hemorrhage may develop.2
Cutaneous signs are similar to those of other vasculitides and include
palpable purpura of the lower extremities, subcutaneous nodules of the scalp
and lower extremities, livedo reticularis, and infarction.
Neurologic manifestations are similar to those of polyarteritis nodosa
(PAN), with mononeuritis multiplex in about two-thirds of cases. Distal,
usually symmetric, peripheral neuropathies are also common. Cranial nerve
palsies are less common, with ischemic optic neuritis being the most
common. Cerebral infarctions are rare.
Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death. Eosinophilic
myocarditis and coronary vasculitis are the most frequent cardiac lesions
and can lead to severe heart failure or myocardial infarction (MI).
Pericardial effusions are also common, but only occasionally lead to
hemodynamic compromise. Endomyocardial fibrosis is rare.
Gastrointestinal (GI) tract manifestations account for a substantial number
of deaths and include tissue eosinophilic infiltration and/or mesenteric
vasculitis with resultant ischemia, infarction, and perforation.
Renal involvement tends to be mild. The most common manifestations are
hematuria, albuminuria, and focal segmental necrotizing glomerulonephritis,
although severe necrotizing glomerulonephritis has been described.
Diagnostic Criteria
The American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for CSS are presented in
Table 25-1.3
TABLE 25-1 THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1990
CRITERIA FOR CHURG–STRAUSS SYNDROME

355

Differential Diagnosis

• The differential diagnosis includes PAN, microscopic polyangiitis (MPA),
Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG), chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and
idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (IHS).
PAN usually spares the glomeruli and lungs, demonstrates arterial
microaneurysms and stenoses, and tends to be ANCA negative.
MPA causes necrotizing vasculitis of arterioles, venules, and capillaries
without granulomas. It often involves the glomeruli and lungs.
The key clinical, laboratory, and histologic findings usually make the
distinction between WG and CSS straightforward.
Chronic eosinophilic pneumonia commonly has no extrapulmonary findings,
affects women, and no granulomatous or vasculitic component.
IHS typically has endomyocardial fibrosis and no vasculitic, granulomatous,
asthmatic, or allergic component. IHS responds poorly to systemic steroids.
Diagnostic Testing
A patient with late-onset and worsening asthma, peripheral eosinophilia and
transient migratory lung infiltrates should raise suspicion for CSS.
Laboratories

• Laboratory data supporting CSS include peripheral eosinophilia (usually
5000–9000 eosinophils/μL), elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),
thrombocytosis, and elevated IgE levels.

• A positive p-ANCA, specifically anti-MPO antibody, supports the diagnosis,
but its absence does not rule out CSS.
356

• Urine protein and plasma creatinine and assessment of cardiac function provide
prognostic information.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Biopsies of skin, nerve, or lung lesions may be highly suggestive.
• They may also be nonspecific or helpful in sorting through the differential
diagnosis.
TREATMENT
Medications

• Initial therapy to induce remission of CSS includes the following options:
The response to oral prednisone, 1 mg/kg daily, is dramatic. Within 1 month,
most patients are clinically improved and have a decreasing if not normal
eosinophil count and ESR. Steroids should be tapered once the ESR has
normalized.
Pulse IV methylprednisolone, 1000 mg daily for 3 days, is used for lifethreatening disease.
Studies suggest that combination therapy with cyclophosphamide (usually 0.6
g/m2 monthly IV doses with adjustments based on laboratory response or 2
mg/kg qd PO doses) has increased efficacy in those patients who have signs
and symptoms of severe or life-threatening disease. IV cyclophosphamide is
preferred for initial therapy, with oral administration reserved for severe
disease or relapses.
For milder disease, methotrexate or azathioprine may be used in
combination with corticosteroids to induce disease remission.

• Long-term therapy to maintain remission and allow reduction of
corticosteroid dose is often used in patients with CSS.
Usually azathioprine or methotrexate is employed after induction of
remission (6–12 months) or if patients are in remission, but require >10 to
20 mg of prednisone.
Methotrexate is used more cautiously as it can cause hypersensitivity
pneumonitis that is difficult to distinguish from a reoccurrence of CSS.4

• Mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab, hydroxyurea, and mepolizumab have also
been used for the treatment of steroid-resistant CSS.5–8
357

COMPLICATIONS

• Complications of treatment are usually from opportunistic infections or related
to long-term use of corticosteroids.

• Patients receiving cyclophosphamide should receive prophylaxis for
Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia with oral
mg/sulfamethoxazole 800 mg, three times per week.

trimethoprim

160

• When cyclophosphamide is administered intravenously, mercaptoethane
sulfonate (MESNA) should be given to reduce the risk of drug-induced cystitis
(dosing of MESNA is the same as that of cyclophosphamide). Half of the dose
is administered prior to the cyclophosphamide infusion, and the other half is
infused 2 hours following the cyclophosphamide infusion.

• Corticosteroids should be weaned as quickly as appropriate and patients
should be evaluated for osteoporosis, diabetes, and hypertension and warned
about weight gain.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Follow-up involves clinical and laboratory assessment of disease status and
monitoring of medication side effects and toxicities.

• Perform frequent eosinophil counts, as increases in counts tend to precede
flares of CSS.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• With the use of steroids and immunosuppressants, remission rates have been
>75%.

• Factors associated with lower 5-year survival rates include proteinuria >1
g/day, creatinine >1.6 mg/dL, cardiomyopathy, and GI tract or CNS
involvement.

Microscopic Polyangiitis
Kristine A. Kuhn and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is a small vessel vasculitis initially termed a
microscopic form of polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) because of its clinical similarity to
PAN, with the additional involvement of arterioles, capillaries, and venules giving
rise to glomerulonephritis.1,2 However, unlike PAN, MPA is not associated with
hepatitis B.
Definition

• MPA is defined by the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference as a necrotizing
vasculitis with few or no immune deposits (pauci-immune) affecting small
vessels such as capillaries, arterioles, and venules. Medium vessels may
also be involved. These may result in necrotizing glomerulonephritis and
pulmonary capillaritis.1

• Involvement of small vessels distinguishes MPA from PAN.
Classification
MPA is classified as a small vessel vasculitis. See Chapter 20 for further review of
the classification of vasculitides.
Epidemiology

• The incidence of MPA in Europe is 2 to 11 cases per million. MPA is 2 to 3
times more frequent than Wegener’s granulomatosis (WG) in Southern Europe,
while in Northern Europe WG is more prevalent.

• In Asia, there is a much greater incidence of MPA compared to WG. Kuwait
has the greatest incidence at 24 cases per million. The prevalence in other nonCaucasian populations is less well defined.
360

• The mean age is 50 to 70 years.
Etiology

• The etiology of MPA is not well established. Several environmental triggers
have been implicated, but these do not explain the majority of cases.

• Infections:
Some individuals with glomerulonephritis secondary to MPA have antibodies
directed to human lysosomal membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2). The epitope
recognized by anti-LAMP-2 antibodies is homologous to type 1 fimbrial
adhesin (FimH), an adhesion protein produced by Gram negative bacteria.
Rats immunized with FimH produce anti-LAMP antibodies and develop
crescentic glomerulonephritis.3
Parvovirus B19 infection may induce antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies
(ANCA), but these antibodies typically are transient.4

• Drugs:
Medications including hydralazine, minocycline, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
antagonists, penicillamine, sulfasalazine, and propylthiouracil (PTU) have
resulted in anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO)–ANCA seropositivity and clinical
vasculitis.
PTU-induced MPA is the most recognized form of drug-induced
vasculitis. One-fifth of patients taking PTU will develop ANCA
seropositivity, and of these, about one-forth will develop overt vasculitis.
Both the ANCA seropositivity and clinical vasculitis will resolve with
cessation of PTU.

• Silica:
About 20% to 40% of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis have been
exposed to silica, and about 20% of perinuclear (p)-ANCA positive
individuals have been exposed to silica.
The odds ratio for silica exposure for vasculitis ranges from 2 to 14.5
Pathophysiology

• ANCA may participate in the pathogenesis of MPA in a two-step process:
Low levels of inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-1 and TNF-α
361

prime neutrophils to express MPO on their surface.
Antibodies to MPO–ANCA bind neutrophils via the surface MPO antigen
and/or Fc receptors. Neutrophils become activated causing release of
reactive oxygen species and lytic enzymes.

• This process only occurs if neutrophils are attached to a surface such as a
vessel wall.

• The model fails to address patients with MPA who are ANCA negative.
Risk Factors

• No specific environmental risk factors have been identified for idiopathic
MPA, although infections and other environmental triggers have been
suggested.

• Drugs such as hydralazine, minocycline, TNF antagonists, penicillamine,
sulfasalazine, and PTU can induce MPA, but the risk is low.

• Genetic risk factors have not been identified.
DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on clinical, serologic and pathologic findings.2
Clinical Presentation

• The most common manifestations of MPA are constitutional, renal, pulmonary,
gastrointestinal (GI), cutaneous, musculoskeletal, and neurologic. Onset may be
acute or indolent.

• Constitutional symptoms (e.g., weakness, weight loss, fevers, malaise, and
arthralgias) are present in >70% of patients.

• Renal involvement occurs in >80% and can range from asymptomatic active
urinary sediment to end-stage renal failure requiring hemodialysis.

• Pulmonary manifestations occur in 25% to 55% and include cough, dyspnea,
hemoptysis, and pleuritic chest pain. Pulmonary hemorrhage occurs in
approximately 25% of patients and may be due to either capillaritis or
bronchial arteritis. Patients may also present with findings suggesting
interstitial fibrosis.
362

• Cutaneous manifestations exist in 30% to 60%. Palpable purpura is the most
common finding but livedo reticularis, nodules, urticarial, and ulcers from skin
necrosis may also be found.

• Abdominal pain (30%–60%) and GI bleeding (20%–30%) may be present;
however, severe hemorrhage, ulcerations, ischemia, and perforation are less
likely to occur in MPA than PAN.

• One- to two-thirds of patients will have neurologic manifestations such as
peripheral neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex, and, less commonly,
central nervous system (CNS) manifestations of pachymeningitis and cerebral
infarctions (hemorrhagic or ischemic).
Differential Diagnosis

• Both small and medium-vessel vasculitides are included in the differential
diagnosis of MPA.1
Pauci-immune immunofluorescence on histology differentiates MPA from
the immune-complex mediated small vessel vasculitides, cryoglobulinemic
vasculitis, and Henoch–Schönlein purpura.
Lack of granulomas on histopathology distinguishes MPA from WG.
The presence of asthma and eosinophilia suggests Churg–Strauss syndrome.

• Distinguishing between MPA and PAN can be difficult. Table 26-1 compares
these two diseases.6
TABLE 26-1 DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF PAN AND MPA

363

Involvement of capillaries, arterioles, and venules distinguishes MPA from
PAN.
ANCA associates with MPA, but not with PAN. PAN is associated with
hepatitis B, while MPA is not.

• Other conditions to consider include Goodpasture’s syndrome and vasculitis
associated with other connective tissue diseases (e.g., systemic lupus
erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis).
Diagnostic Testing
The diagnostic workup of MPA includes assessment of renal, pulmonary, and nerve
function (e.g., serum creatinine, urinalysis, spirometry, chest radiography, and nerve
conduction studies).
Laboratories

• Common laboratory findings include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and
normochromic normocytic anemia of chronic inflammation.

• Evaluation of renal function may reveal an elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN)
364

and creatinine and an active urinary sediment (proteinuria, hematuria, red
blood cell [RBC] casts and leukocyturia).

• C3 and C4 levels are normal or elevated.
• ANCA testing, either by indirect immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for specific antigens (i.e., proteinase 3 [PR3]
and MPO) is not uniformly standardized; therefore, diagnostic performance
will vary by laboratory.
ANCA is present in about 75% of patients, usually p-ANCA/anti-MPO.7
ANCA positivity should be confirmed with ELISA testing form anti-MPO
and anti-PR3 antibodies.8
In the appropriate clinical setting, p-ANCA has 98% specificity for MPA.9
The sensitivity of anti-MPO antibodies ranges broadly depending on the kit
used and the cut off value selected.9

• Low titer rheumatoid factor (RF) and antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) may also
be present.
Imaging

• Chest radiography should be performed to evaluate for pulmonary
manifestations. Patchy diffuse opacities are found in the setting of alveolar
hemorrhage.

• CT of the chest demonstrates ground-glass opacifications in the setting of
alveolar hemorrhage, and septal thickening and honeycombing may be present
with interstitial fibrosis.

• Mesenteric angiography may be performed if necessary to differentiate PAN
from MPA.

• Other organ-specific imaging may be required for evaluation of complications.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Almost all patients need renal biopsies.
Focal segmental glomerulonephritis is found in nearly 100% of patients
with renal disease.
Glomerular crescents, frank vasculitis, fibrinoid necrosis, interstitial
nephritis, and tubular atrophy may also be observed.
The immunofluorescence pattern is pauci-immune, with minimal
365

immunoglobulin and complement in glomeruli.

• Bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy and bronchoalveolar lavage
(BAL) is useful in demonstrating capillaritis and ruling out infectious causes of
pulmonary hemorrhage.
BAL fluid is usually grossly hemorrhagic and histology demonstrates
hemosiderin-laden macrophages.
Biopsy of tissue in hemorrhagic areas can demonstrate necrotizing alveolar
capillaritis with pauci-immune immunofluorescence. Other histologic
patterns may demonstrate intra-alveolar and interstitial red blood cells,
fibrinoid necrosis, and intra-alveolar hemosiderosis.

• Cutaneous biopsies

demonstrate leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Again,
immunofluorescence demonstrates a pauci-immune pattern.

• Nerve conduction velocity (NCV) studies can identify peripheral neuropathies
manifested as acute axonopathy, and sural nerve biopsy demonstrates
necrotizing vasculitis in nearly 80% of patients with abnormal NCV studies.
TREATMENT

• Treatment is divided into two phases: induction and then maintenance of
remission.
Glucocorticoids are given at induction and a prolonged taper is prescribed.
Induction of remission is established with cyclophosphamide or rituximab,
w h i l e maintenance therapy is provided with azathioprine or
methotrexate.

• Supportive measures with hemodialysis and mechanical ventilation may be
required.

• Plasmapheresis may be considered in refractory cases.
Medications
Glucocorticoids

• Initially, methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily for 3 days is followed by
prednisone orally at 1 mg/kg daily and then tapered slowly over 12 to 18
months.

• Relapses of MPA are common and usually occur during tapering of prednisone
366

doses. Relapses are usually milder than the initial presentation and can often
be treated with increased doses of prednisone.

• Glucocorticoid monotherapy is not recommended, as remission rates are
lower than when given cyclophosphamide.
Cyclophosphamide

• Cyclophosphamide is given as a daily oral regimen or monthly IV infusions.
Daily oral cyclophosphamide is given as 2 mg/kg (up to a maximum 200 mg)
PO daily for 3 to 6 months followed by maintenance therapy with either
azathioprine or methotrexate.
Alternatively, it may be given 0.5 to 1.0 g/m2 IV once monthly for up to 12
months (usually until remission is induced). Again, this is followed by
maintenance therapy with azathioprine or methotrexate.

• There is no difference in efficacy between the two regimens. However, the
cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide is higher when given orally, which may
lead to increased toxicity. This drug should only be given by a physician
familiar with its use.
Azathioprine

• Once remission has been induced, substitution of cyclophosphamide with
azathioprine has been shown to be effective at the maintenance of remission
while reducing the exposure to cyclophosphamide.

• Azathioprine is given 2 mg/kg PO daily to complete a total of 18 months of
therapy (from induction).
Methotrexate
Methotrexate given 25 mg PO once weekly for 12 months is similar in efficacy and
safety to azathioprine for the maintenance of remission in MPA.10
Rituximab

• Compared to cyclophosphamide, rituximab is equally efficacious in the
induction of remission for the treatment of MPA and without differences in
adverse events.11 However, long-term data are not well established.

• Rituximab is usually given as an IV infusion of 375 mg/m2 once weekly for 4
weeks.
367

Mycophenolate Mofetil
Studies have failed to demonstrate that mycophenolate mofetil 2000 mg PO daily is
equally efficacious to azathioprine as maintenance therapy for ANCA-associated
vasculitides.12 Therefore, it is considered a second line agent.
Other Non-pharmacologic Therapies

• Plasmapheresis may be indicated in refractory cases of ANCA-associated
glomerulonephritis.

• In addition to pulse steroids and cyclophosphamide, plasma exchange reduced
the number of patients requiring hemodialysis.

• Plasmapheresis did not affect overall mortality, though.13
COMPLICATIONS

• MPA can lead to end-organ failure. Complications depend upon the organ(s)
affected. Most commonly renal and pulmonary failure occurs.

• Therapy-specific complications may occur.
REFERRAL

• Patients should be referred to a rheumatologist for diagnosis, treatment, and
management of MPA.

• Referral to other specialists should be considered based on specific organ
involvement (e.g., nephrologist for renal disease).
PATIENT EDUCATION
Patients should be educated on the disease manifestations, complications, and
treatment options for their disease.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Follow-up involves the clinical and laboratory assessment of disease activity
(complete blood count, renal function, urinary sediment and acute phase
reactants) as well as monitoring of medication toxicities.
368

• Patients in remission should be monitored at least every 3 to 6 months for
relapse.

• There is controversy as to whether ANCA levels are useful in monitoring
disease activity. It is not recommended. More important are the assessments
for end organ damage.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• About 20% of patients progress to end-stage renal failure. A normal serum
creatinine at diagnosis carries a more favorable prognosis.2

• Alveolar hemorrhage and pulmonary fibrosis carry a poor prognosis; patients
are nine times more likely to die. Also, higher relapse rates occur in those with
pulmonary disease.

Henoch–Schönlein Purpura
Amy Archer and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP) is defined as a vasculitis with IgA-dominant
immune deposits affecting small vessels, including capillaries, venules, and
arterioles (Chapel Hill Consensus Conference).1
Epidemiology

• The annual incidence is 14 cases per 100,000 people.
• Although HSP can be seen at any age, the majority of patients are children less
than 10 years old. The mean age at presentation is 6.

• HSP is slightly more common in males.
• HSP presents most commonly in the fall and winter months, often after a
respiratory infection.
Etiology

• Although many cases of HSP follow respiratory infections, it may also be
associated with the administration of drugs and vaccines. No single dominant
etiologic agent has been identified.

• There may be genetic susceptibility with particular HLA alleles.2
Pathophysiology

• HSP is characterized by the deposition of IgA-dominant immune complexes in
the walls of arterioles, capillaries, and post-capillary venules with resultant
complement activation and leukocytoclastic vasculitis.
Skin and gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are a direct result of immune371

complex driven inflammation leading to tissue damage and extravasation of
blood cells.
Renal biopsies demonstrate glomerulonephritis with prominent mesangial
immune complex deposition.

• Aberrant glycosylation in the hinge region of the IgA1 subtype may play a role
in pathogenesis.3
Associated Conditions
HSP clinical picture develops in about 3% to 7% of patients with familial
Mediterranean fever.4,5
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• HSP primarily affects the skin, kidneys, and GI tract.
• Is often associated with arthralgias and arthritis.
• Occasionally, it affects the pulmonary vasculature, resulting in pulmonary
capillaritis and alveolar hemorrhage.

• Coronary vessel vasculitis and neurologic sequelae are rare.
• There are two main distinctions between children and adults that present with
HSP.6
Intussusception is rare in adults.
Adults have a greater risk of developing severe renal disease.
History

• The typical presentation of HSP is a child with colicky abdominal pain
associated with nausea and vomiting as well as lower extremity arthritis.
The skin lesions may also be early manifestations.

• The initial presentation is often then followed by bloody diarrhea and
palpable purpura, affecting predominantly the lower extremities and buttocks.

• Boys may present with orchitis.
• Rare presentations occur with headache or seizures.
372

• Symptoms of HSP are usually preceded by an upper respiratory tract
infection (e.g., fever, rhinorrhea, and cough).
Physical Examination

• Palpable purpura
In children, purpura may be preceded by a transient urticaria, angioedema,
and maculopapular rash.
The purpura tends to occur in crops in regions on the legs and buttocks.
However, purpura can present in other areas of the body and often presents
before other manifestations of HSP.
Individual lesions are 2 to 10 mm in diameter, typically last several days and
resolve more quickly with bed rest.

• Arthritis
Arthritis is the second most common manifestation of HSP and presents in
75% of patients.
The knees, ankles, and feet are typically involved.
While joints are usually warm and painful, joint effusions are not consistently
present.

• Gastrointestinal
Abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting
Guaiac-positive stool is seen in about half of the patients, but hemorrhage is
rare.

• Genitourinary
Pain, tenderness, and swelling of the testicle and/or scrotum are less
common manifestations of HSP.

• Neurologic
Rare reports of focal neurologic deficits, ataxia, central and peripheral
neuropathy.
TABLE 27-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1990
CRITERIA FOR THE CLASSIFICATION OF HENOCH–SCHÖNLEIN
PURPURA

373

Diagnostic Criteria

• American College of Rheumatology 1990 criteria for the classification of HSP
are presented in Table 27-1.7

• In 2006 the European League against Rheumatism and Pediatric Rheumatology
European Society published new criteria for pediatric HSP and these are
presented in Table 27-2.8

• For typical presentations of HSP in children, it is necessary to exclude sepsis,
thrombocytopenia, and clotting disorders.

• In adults, further studies are needed to rule out other causes of small vessel
vasculitis.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes other causes of small-vessel vasculitis
(Wegener’s granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, cryoglobulinemic vasculitis,
and leukocytoclastic angiitis), polyarteritis nodosa (in cases of unusually chronic or
severe HSP), systemic lupus erythematosus, thrombotic thrombocytopenic
purpura/hemolytic-uremic syndrome, exanthematous drug eruption, purpura
fulminans, and septic vasculitis.
TABLE 27-2 2006 THE EUROPEAN LEAGUE AGAINST RHEUMATISM
AND PEDIATRIC RHEUMATOLOGY EUROPEAN SOCIETY
CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR HENOCH–SCHÖNLEIN PURPURA

374

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Urinalysis: The most common renal manifestation is microscopic hematuria but
up to one-third of patients with nephritis have gross hematuria.

• Serum creatinine should be checked.
• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) may be elevated.
• Complete blood count should be checked for possible leukocytosis and to
ensure a normal platelet count.

• Coagulation studies to rule out coagulopathies.
• Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
(ANCA).

• Immunoglobulins: IgA may be elevated in up to 72% of children with HSP.9
Imaging

• Abdominal plain films
May have dilated loops of bowel.
Can be used in combination with chest radiography to evaluate for
perforation.

• Abdominal ultrasound
More effective means of identifying ileoileal intussusception.

• Doppler flow and/or radionuclide studies
Utilized in patients presenting with scrotal pain.

• Head CT/MRI
Utilized in rare cases of neurologic presentation to evaluate intracerebral
375

hemorrhage.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Renal biopsy:
In children renal biopsy is recommended when there is impaired renal
function or marked proteinuria, as histologic lesions are prognostic
indicators.
In adults a biopsy may be needed to rule out other causes of small-vessel
vasculitis.
Mild disease often demonstrates focal mesangial proliferation with IgAdominant immune complex deposition and C3 deposits in the mesangial
matrix.
In patients with more severe renal disease, such as nephrotic range
proteinuria, there is likely to be marked cellular proliferation and
crescentic glomerulonephritis.

• Skin biopsy:
In adults a skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis of HSP.
Biopsies will demonstrate small-vessel leukocytoclastic vasculitis, most
prominent in the post-capillary venules.
Immunofluorescence studies show IgA-dominant immune complex
deposition in combination with C3 deposits.
TREATMENT
Most patients completely recover without specific therapy.
Medications

• Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors should be considered in
cases of proteinuria or as a first line agent in patients with hypertension.

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are generally sufficient to
relieve arthralgias and arthritis, but often are avoided due to side effects.

• Corticosteroids
May be used for severe joint pain.
376

May be used in severe abdominal pain, especially when intussusception is
suspected.
Do not have a role in the treatment of purpura as there is no decrease in
the duration of the skin lesion or frequency of recurrences.
Do not appear to have a role in preventing nephritis.10

• Several treatment regimens for renal disease have been suggested including
corticosteroids, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mycophenolate
mofetil, plasmapheresis, IV immunoglobulin, and rituximab.
Surgical Management
Those patients that progress to end-stage renal disease are candidates for a renal
transplant, although the disease can reoccur following transplant.
COMPLICATIONS
GI involvement has the potential for serious complications including
intussusception (typically ileoileal), infarction, massive hemorrhage, and
perforation.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• In patients with mild renal disease, measurement of blood pressure, serum
creatinine, and urinalysis should be obtained at least weekly while the disease
is clinically active and once a month for 3 months when the disease remits.

• Females who were diagnosed with HSP in childhood are at increased risk of
proteinuria and hypertension during pregnancy and need to be carefully
monitored during this time.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• HSP resolves within 2 to 4 weeks in over 80% of childhood cases.
• Children generally have milder disease and are less likely to have nephritis.
• HSP is more severe and prolonged in adults, with renal failure and nephritis
occurring more frequently.

377

• Recurrence of symptoms occurs in one-third of patients; resolution in these
patients often occurs within 4 months.

• Approximately 30% to 50% of patients with nephritis have persistent urinary
abnormalities after long-term follow-up.

• Long-term prognosis of HSP depends on the severity of renal impairment. Only
1% of patients develop end-stage renal disease.
Patients with gross hematuria, nephrotic syndrome, or hypertension are more
likely to progress to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
If a renal biopsy has crescents involving >50% of the glomeruli, there is
increased rate of chronic renal failure and ESRD.

Cryoglobulinemia and Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis
Reeti Joshi and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Cryoglobulins are serum proteins that undergo precipitation upon refrigeration
of serum and redissolve on warming to 37°C.

• They are typically composed of immunoglobulins and complement fragments.
• This phenomenon was first described by Wintrobe and Bruell in 1933 and later
named “cryoprecipitation.”

• About 20 years later, Metzler described the classic clinical triad of purpura,
arthralgias, and asthenia.

• Cryoglobulinemia refers to presence of circulating cryoglobulins.1,2
• Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis (CV) is defined as a vasculitis secondary to
deposition of cryoglobulins in small vessels such as arterioles, venules, and
capillaries (Chapel Hill Consensus Conference).1–3

• An important caveat is that cryoglobulinemia does not necessarily lead to
CV.
Classification

• Cryoglobulins are commonly classified as per Brouet et al.1,2,4,5
Type I: Isolated monoclonal immunoglobulins IgG or IgM.
Frequently associated with myeloma and Waldenström’s
macroglobulinemia, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and B-cell nonHodgkin lymphomas.
Serum levels are often high (5–30 mg/mL) and they usually readily
precipitate in cold.
Type II: Immune complexes of polyclonal or monoclonal IgM rheumatoid
factor directed against polyclonal IgG

380

Most are IgM–IgG, although IgG–IgG and IgG–IgA can occur.
Serum levels are usually high, 40% with levels >5 mg/mL.
Primarily associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV).
Type III: Polyclonal IgM rheumatoid factor directed against polyclonal
IgG
These are consistently heterogeneous (always polyclonal).
More difficult to detect because they precipitate slowly and tend to be
present in much smaller quantities (50–1000 μg/dL).
Associated with HCV to a lesser extent compared to Type II cryoglobulins.

• Type II and III are considered “mixed cryoglobulins” (MC) as they contain a
mixture of IgM and IgG.

• Type II and III are associated with HCV, other viral and bacterial infections
(HIV, hepatitis B virus [HBV]), endocarditis, autoimmune disease (e.g.,
rheumatoid arthritis [RA], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE], and systemic
sclerosis), and lymphoproliferative disorders.

• Essential mixed cryoglobulinemia refers to cases with no identifiable cause;
however, after the identification of HBV and HCV, a large majority of these
cases were shown to be related to these infections.
Epidemiology

• The laboratory assessment of MC is not standardized and requires expertise
beyond the abilities of most labs. Furthermore, improper handling of samples
leads to false negatives. Consequently, the actual prevalence may be
underestimated.

• Prevalence of “essential” MC is reported to be approximately 1:100,000;
however, very few cases are truly “essential” (no identifiable cause).

• Estimates of MC prevalence in HCV infection vary widely, ranging from 10%
to 70%.

• Female-to-male ratio is 3:1.
• Several groups have focused on HLA alleles. Studies from France, Italy, and
China have associated DRB1*11 alleles and DR3, DR5, and DR6 serological
clusters with MC. A group in Japan found no significant association between
HLA and HCV MC.2
381

Cryoglobulinemic Vasculitis in Chronic Hepatitis C Infection

• The natural history and prognosis of MC vasculitis are variable and highly
dependent on renal involvement and overall extent of vasculitic lesions.

• CV is usually associated with advanced age, longer duration of HCV infection,
type II MC, a higher MC serum level, and clonal B-cell expansions in both the
blood and liver.4

• The worse prognostic factors are being older than 60 years at diagnosis and
renal involvement.

• The overall 5-year survival after the diagnosis of vasculitis ranges from 50%
to 90% in cases with renal involvement. Even in the absence of significant
renal failure, increased mortality from liver involvement, cardiovascular
disease, infection, and lymphoma has been reported.
Pathophysiology

• Clinical and histological features indicate vascular deposits of cryoglobulins
leading to cold induced symptoms of vascular insufficiency secondary to
occlusion of various small vessels. This is commonly seen in patients with
Type I or II cryoglobulins.

• Circulating immune complexes are present in occluded blood vessel walls as
well as in serum.

• The monoclonal rheumatoid factors (mRF) that bear the WA cross-idiotype are
responsible for most cases of CV in patients with HCV infection.

• HCV exerts a chronic stimulus on the immune system and provides a chronic
intravascular antigenic source.

• A pathogenic factor in MC is thought to be the production of IgM by B-cell
clones.

• Cutaneous vasculitis and glomerulonephritis are typically seen in Type II
and III cryoglobulins.

• Vasculitic lesions in different organs with HCV may vary. For example, while
complexes of HCV RNA, monoclonal IgM-RF, IgG, and complement
components are detected in skin, demonstration of HCV proteins in kidneys
remains difficult.

• Low C4 is found in patients with CV.
382

• Cryoglobulinemic neuropathy may be caused by vasculitis of vasa nervorum as
well as immunologically mediated demyelination, hyperviscosity, and
microvascular occlusion.

• Vasculitis of intramuscular or cerebral arteries may cause paresis or plegia,
strokes, or a diffuse encephalopathy.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia is by clinical and lab parameters. CV has different
presentations based on organ systems affected.
Clinical Features

• Type I cryoglobulinemia:
Type I is rarely implicated in clinical symptoms related to vasculitis and
tends to cause signs of peripheral vascular occlusion and hyperviscosity.
Raynaud’s phenomenon, purpura, acrocyanosis, dystrophic manifestation,
ulcers, and gangrene may be seen.
Hematologic abnormalities may be present due to the underlying disease.
High cryocrit and cryoglobulins may only be a casual finding.

• Mixed Cryoglobulinemia (MC):
MC syndrome is characterized by the triad of purpura, weakness, and
arthralgias.
Multisystem organ involvement including chronic hepatitis,
membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), and peripheral
neuropathy due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small- and medium-sized
vessels is frequently observed.
History and Physical Examination

• The history should be aimed primarily at identifying an underlying disease.
• General symptoms included Raynaud’s phenomenon, acrocyanosis, rashes
precipitated by cold, and sicca symptoms.
Cutaneous Manifestations
384

• Purpura is the main manifestation of CV.
• Palpable purpura is usually found on lower extremities.
• About 70% patients have this cutaneous finding, which may be transient or may
progress to ulcers and gangrene.
Arthralgias/Arthritis

• Affects small distal joints, oligoarticular, and nonerosive pattern usually seen
in MC.

• Often sensitive to low doses of steroids, with or without hydroxychloroquine.
• In HCV associated MC, rarely an erosive symmetrical polyarthritis may
develop.

• An overlap syndrome of RA and MC must be considered.
• Anti-cyclic citrullinated protein (CCP) antibodies may represent an important
diagnostic tool as they are not increased in MC while RF positivity is seen in
30% to 70% of patients with HCV, even in the absence of RA.
Symmetric Peripheral Neuropathy

• Symmetric peripheral neuropathy is the most common neurologic manifestation.
• It is more frequent in Type III cryoglobulinemia.
• It may have an acute or subacute presentation, usually accompanied by
cutaneous disease.

• It is typically, a sensory axonal neuropathy in glove and stocking pattern.
• Symmetric or asymmetric motor and/or sensory polyneuropathy is common.
• Mononeuritis multiplex may also be seen.
• Causes of neuropathy:
Vasculitis of vasa nervosum.
Hyperviscosity with occlusion of microcirculation.
Immune-mediated demyelination.
Renal Disease

• Most common in type II cryoglobulinemia, being observed in 30% to 60% of
MC and portending a poor prognosis.
385

• HCV RNA detected in kidney of affected patients.
• Non-nephrotic range proteinuria, hematuria, and hypertension. This rarely
presents as an acute nephritis/nephritic syndrome.

• Type I MPGN accounts for 80% of type II cryoglobulinemic nephropathy.
There is thickening of glomerular basement membrane and cellular
proliferation on biopsy.

• Distinguishing histological features in cryoglobulinemic MPGN:
Marked influx of circulating macrophages
Intraluminal thrombi of precipitated cryoglobulins
Fingerprint subendothelial deposits by electron microscopy
IgM deposition in capillary loops by immunofluorescence.

• Less common presentations:
Mild mesangial membranous nephropathy
Acute vasculitis of small- and medium-sized renal vessels
Thrombotic microangiopathy
Occasionally oliguria and rapidly progressive acute renal failure is seen.
Liver Disease

• Diffuse lymphoid infiltration of liver (lupoid hepatitis).
• Usually related to HCV.
• Levels of cryoglobulins typically decrease as cirrhosis progresses.
• Autoimmune hepatitis may share a number of extrahepatic features including
leukocytoclastic vasculitis, hypocomplementemia, glomerulonephritis, and
anti-smooth muscle antibodies, further confounding the diagnosis.
Rare Findings

• Lymphadenopathy.
• Mesenteric vasculitis.
• Subclinical pulmonary fibrosis.
• Coronary vasculitis.
• Pulmonary vasculitis, pleurisy, dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis are often
overlooked.
386

Diagnostic Criteria

• The American College of Rheumatology does not have a set of criteria for CV.
• The Gruppo Italiano di Studio delle Crioglobulinemie published a system for
defining and characterizing the cryoglobulinemic syndrome; this is presented in
Table 28-1.6
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Cryoglobulins are heterogeneous in composition, thermal properties, and
efficiency of complement activation.
TABLE 28-1 PROPOSED SYSTEM FOR DEFINING AND
CHARACTERIZING THE CRYOGLOBULINEMIC SYNDROME

• Serum concentrations do not necessarily correlate with severity.
• Sample collection is a critical step.
• A negative test should not exclude the disease; if clinical suspicion remains
high, the test should be repeated.

• If a cryoprecipitate is present, it should be resolubilized and subject to both
quantitative analysis (cryocrit estimation, immunoglobulin and C4 levels,
rheumatoid factor) and qualitative analysis (serum protein electrophoresis and
immunofixation).7

• Tests for both HCV antibody and HCV RNA should be done, even if hepatic
enzymes are normal.

387

• Negative HCV test may rarely be due to HCV RNA concentrated in circulating
cryoglobulin immune complexes.

• Other lab findings include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), low
C4 with normal or slightly low C3, normocytic normochromic anemia, and RF.
Total hemolytic complement may be zero due to cold activation. (complement
activation may occur after the sample is obtained).7
TREATMENT

• Asymptomatic patients with detectable cryoglobulins can simply be monitored.
• Patients with mild to moderate disease, such as arthralgias, asthenia, and
purpura, may be treated with low to medium dose prednisone (10–30 mg/day).

• Moderate to severe disease, including glomerulonephritis and cutaneous
vasculitis are treated with low to medium dose prednisone and, if HCV
positive, pegylated IFN and ribavirin.

• Patients with life-threatening manifestations including rapidly progressing
glomerulonephritis, sensorimotor neuropathy, and extensive or visceral
vasculitis, should receive plasma exchange and high dose steroids plus
cyclophosphamide or rituximab or, if they have hepatitis C, should receive
sequential therapy with rituximab followed by pegylated IFN and ribavirin.1

• Due to the complexity of etiopathogenesis, the treatment of HCV-associated
MC is particularly challenging.
Three important factors should be considered: HCV infection, the presence of
an autoimmune disorder, and possible neoplastic associations.
The most effective treatment for HCV MC is eradication of underlying HCV
infection (i.e., removal of the antigen driving the process).
In patients with sustained virologic response to anti-HCV therapy, the
symptoms of MC and evidence of B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders
almost always disappear.
HCV relapse is associated with recurrence of symptoms.
The eradication of HCV with pegylated IFN/ribavirin leads to resolution of
MC associated splenic villous lymphomas and immunocytomas.8,9
Current standard of care for HCV is pegylated IFN in combination with
ribavirin. However, the care is complicated in that there are several different
genotypes of HCV, each with a variable response to treatment.
388

Sustained virologic response of 45% to 50% is noted in genotypes 1 and 4,
70% to 80% in genotypes 2 and 3.

• Other therapies for cryoglobulinemia (type II) have relied on cytotoxic agents
or apheresis, although no controlled trials have been undertaken for either
agent.

• There is a concern with immunosuppression leading to worsening of underlying
infectious disease.

• Due to risk of lymphoproliferative disease development, cytotoxic agents are
not preferred but have been used (e.g., chlorambucil in CLL-induced
cryoglobulinemia).10
Medications
Cyclophosphamide

• Cyclophosphamide is typically used in severe cases and remains the first line
cytotoxic agent.

• For severe life-threatening disease, use daily oral cyclophosphamide with
pulse steroids and plasmapheresis (doses similar to those used for Wegener’s
granulomatosis).

• Severe but non–life-threatening disease may be treated with monthly pulse IV
cyclophosphamide along with oral prednisone.

• Once remission of severe disease is achieved, employ daily oral prednisone
with weekly oral methotrexate or azathioprine.

• Treatment of underlying causes such as RA or lymphoma is essential in
preventing relapse.
Rituximab

• Systemic B-cell depletion with rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody
against CD20 antigen, has been utilized successfully in patients with several
autoimmune diseases.

• Several case reports and small uncontrolled case series have reported variable
success with rituximab in cryoglobulinemia and CV.11,12

• Recent treatment guidelines for mixed cryoglobulinemia syndrome in HCV
infected patients suggests that HCV viral load and liver function be carefully
389

monitored in patients receiving rituximab, and antiviral prophylaxis should be
given to HBV carriers.

• Type 1 cryoglobulinemia appears to have a lower response rate than MC.
• In one meta-analysis, 128 patients with CV were reviewed.11
In most studies, rituximab was administered intravenously at doses of 375
mg/m2 weekly for 4 weeks, sometimes followed by two extra infusions at 1
and 2 months. This higher dose was associated with more side effects. A
lower dose of 250 mg/m2 at days 1 and 8 showed a response rate of 80% in
six patients with HCV induced MC.
Neuropathy and renal involvement were more resistant to treatment whereas
skin and joint disease responded quickly.
Side effects were reported in 27 out of 128 patients, including infection,
serum sickness, thrombosis of retinal arteries, and development of cold
agglutinin disease.
Colchicine

• The rationale underlying the use of colchicine (1mg/day) to treat MC is based
on the drug’s activity in reducing immunoglobulin secretion.

• In a small open study, it had favorable effects on purpura, weakness, and leg
ulcers. Minor gastrointestinal side effects are common at this dose.13
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies
Plasmapheresis

• This should be reserved for life-threatening forms of disease including
vasculitis, glomerulonephritis, severe central nervous system disease,
malignant hypertension, vascular insufficiency with distal necrosis, and
hyperviscosity syndrome.

• Concomitant immunosuppressive therapy must be instituted to prevent rebound
antibody formation and relapse of disease after withdrawal of plasmapheresis.
A protocol typically includes methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 days
followed by oral prednisone and cyclophosphamide (doses similar to those
used for treatment of Wegener’s granulomatosis).

• Plasmapheresis, exchanging one plasma volume three times weekly for 2 to 3
weeks is generally used. Replacement fluid can be 5% albumin, which must be
390

warmed to prevent precipitation of cryoglobulins.

• Optimal methods for assessment of efficacy are not clear as cryocrit may not
correlate with disease intensity. Clinical examination is used to guide further
therapy. Skin, arthritic, and renal manifestations can improve rapidly whereas
cryoglobulinemic neuropathy does not remit in short-term therapy.14

Cutaneous Vasculitis
Michael L. Sams and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definitions

• Cutaneous vasculitis (CV) is a small-vessel vasculitis affecting the skin.
However, small-vessel vasculitis is often not specific to just the small-vessels
and there may be overlap involvement of the medium-sized vessels.

• There are multiple different names for CV which leads to confusion.
Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is often used to refer to CV. However, it is
a pathologic term and refers to the nuclear “dust” due to degranulation of
neutrophils seen under light microscopy. Leukocytoclasia is nonspecific and
LCV may be seen with multiple types of CV.

• Necrotizing vasculitis is synonymous with LCV.
• Cutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitis (CLA) refers to isolated CV without
systemic vasculitis or glomerulonephritis. It has also been referred to as
primary cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (PCSVV).1

• Hypersensitivity vasculitis is a CV of the small vessels (arterioles and
venules) secondary to an immune response to an exogenous substance.
However, there is often no clear evidence of an ongoing immune response or
an inciting agent. CLA may be the preferred term over hypersensitivity
vasculitis.

• Lymphocytic vasculitis is also a CV but is different histologically from LCV
as it features a lymphocytic infiltrate. It is more commonly observed with
vasculitis due to the connective tissue disorders and Behçet’s disease (BD).
Etiology

• There are multiple causes of CV. (Table 29-1).
• One-third of cases of CV are idiopathic.
393

• The most common cause of CV is drug-induced. Typically it does not involve
other organs and presents as CLA.

• Urticarial vasculitis results in an urticarial-like rash that lasts longer than 24 to
48 hours. The lesions may progress to a purpuric stage and after resolution,
there is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. There are two types of urticarial
vasculitis: the normocomplementemic form and the hypocomplementemic
form. The latter is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).2

• Viral infections including both hepatitis B and C as well as HIV have also
been linked to vasculitis. In the case of hepatitis C virus (HCV), mixed
cryoglobulins (Types II and III) deposit in the small and medium vessels
leading to inflammation.
TABLE 29-1 CAUSES OF CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS SYNDROMES

• Connective tissue diseases may present with CV. The disorders prone to this
include SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (rheumatoid
vasculitis). The resulting vasculitis can also be lymphocytic.

• There are multiple systemic vasculitides that present with cutaneous
involvement. These include all three of the antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody
394

(ANCA)-associated vasculitides, BD, Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP),
polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), and cutaneous PAN (vasculitic changes as with
PAN but limited to the skin). As mentioned, hypocomplementemic urticarial
vasculitis is often associated with SLE.

• Erythema elevatum diutinum is a specific form of chronic CV typified by
papules and nodules on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The cause,
while unknown, is presumed to be immune complex related. Early lesions
show LCV. Many potential associations have been made including infections
and various rheumatologic disorders.3

• Lymphoma, leukemia, and even solid tumors have been associated with CV.
However, malignancy accounts for less than 5% of cases.

• Hypercoagulable states, while not an inflammatory process, may appear on
physical examination of the skin like a vasculitis due to the ischemia and
damage to the vessel.
Pathophysiology

• The pathophysiology of CV depends on the etiology.
• Certain infections cause direct invasion of blood vessels (e.g., Neisseria,
Rickettsia) or may induce immune complex deposition (e.g., hepatitis B virus
infection).

• Other vasculitides may also be immune-complex mediated (drug-induced or
rheumatoid vasculitis) or due to immunoglobulin deposition (e.g., IgA in HSP).
ANCA-associated vasculitis may involve the skin in addition to other organs
but the role of these antibodies in these cases is unclear.

• The size of the vessel involved dictates the clinical findings. With small-vessel
vasculitis palpable purpura is common but non-palpable purpura, urticaria,
pustules, vesicles, superficial ulcerations, and splinter hemorrhages all
occur.

• When medium-sized vessels are involved skin changes include nodules, livedo
reticularis, digital infarctions, ulcers, and papulonecrotic lesions. These
differences reflect the greater area of ischemia due to obstruction of a larger
blood vessel.

• The majority of CV is classified as small-vessel vasculitides.
• Common types of medium-sized vasculitis include PAN, cutaneous PAN,
395

rheumatoid vasculitis, and Buerger’s disease.
DIAGNOSIS

• The approach to vasculitis of the skin is to answer the following questions:
Are the skin findings due to vasculitis?
What is the etiology?
Are other organ systems involved?
Clinical Presentation
History

• CV usually appears suddenly and the lesions are often painless. In contrast,
urticarial vasculitic lesions are often painful and burning rather than pruriticlike allergic urticaria. Myalgias or arthralgias may accompany the skin lesions.

• A history of a connective tissue disease (e.g., RA, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome) is
important, as are symptoms of an underlying systemic disease (e.g., fever,
weight loss, hematuria, abdominal pain, joint pain, focal or generalized
weakness).

• Often CV is the first sign of a serious illness.
• Examine the medication list for possible etiologic agents, as drugs are the
most common cause. Drug-induced vasculitis usually develops 7 to 21 days
after starting a drug. Almost any drug can cause a vasculitic reaction and the
most common ones are listed in Table 29-1. Drug reactions typically resolve
spontaneously upon discontinuing the medication.
Physical Examination

• Palpable purpura is the classic lesion of CV. Nonpalpable purpura, nodules,
urticaria, vesicles, and shallow or deep ulcerations are also seen, sometimes
in combination.

• Lesions usually occur in the lower extremities or in dependent locations.
However, urticarial vasculitis is more common on the trunk and proximal
extremities.
TABLE 29-2 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 1990
396

CRITERIA FOR HYPERSENSITIVITY VASCULITIS

• The physical examination aims to identify other organ system involvement and
should include a musculoskeletal examination looking for arthritis.
A neurologic examination is important to identify focal or diffuse weakness
that may occur due to mononeuritis multiplex.
Palpate for enlarged lymph nodes that may suggest infection or underlying
malignancy.
Auscultate the heart for murmurs and inspect the nails if endocarditis is
suspected.
Diagnostic Criteria
The American College of Rheumatology criteria for hypersensitivity vasculitis are
presented in Table 29-2.4
Differential Diagnosis
Multiple processes in the skin can result in non-blanching purpura, ulcerations, and
urticaria. See Table 29-3 for common nonvasculitic causes of these findings.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Investigate renal involvement with chemistries and urinalysis.
• A hepatic function panel can be helpful.
• Blood cultures (and cultures from other sites) are mandatory in cases with
fever, as infections, including endocarditis, can cause vasculitis.
397

• The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is often elevated but is
nonspecific. Testing for systemic markers of disease is not recommended
unless there is clinical suspicion.

• Specific labs to help diagnose systemic causes include but are not limited to
antinuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-double stranded DNA (dsDNA),
rheumatoid factor (RF), ANCA, hepatitis serologies, cryoglobulin
determination, C3, C4, CH50, SSA, SSB, and urine protein electrophoresis
(UPEP).
Imaging
Chest radiographs or CT scans may be needed to evaluate the lungs and the upper
respiratory tract and rule out systemic disease.
TABLE 29-3 MIMICS OF CUTANEOUS VASCULITIS

Diagnostic Procedures
Skin Biopsy

• A skin biopsy is essential to confirm the diagnosis.
• Indications for biopsy include symptoms of systemic disease or continual
formation of new lesions for more than 3 weeks.
398

• If possible, perform biopsies within 24 to 48 hours after the appearance of a
lesion. Biopsies performed before or after this time typically show a
nonspecific lymphocytic infiltrate.5

• Ulcerated sites should be avoided. When it is necessary to biopsy an ulcerated
site, the edge should be sampled.

• A punch biopsy provides the appropriate depth for examination, especially for
deeper medium-sized vessels.

• Examine specimens under light microscopy and direct immunofluorescence.
• Under light microscopy, the affected blood vessels are characterized by
fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel wall with an inflammatory infiltrate within
and around the vessel wall.
When the infiltrate is only perivascular, the diagnosis of vasculitis cannot be
made reliably.
Hemorrhage and fragments of leukocytes (leukocytoclasia) are also seen.
Cutaneous vasculitic lesions associated with connective tissue diseases often
have lymphocytic infiltration.
Prominence of eosinophils is suggestive of Churg–Strauss syndrome.
Urticarial lesions have an LCV histopathology.

• Direct immunofluorescence may reveal immunoglobulin and complement
deposition on the vessel wall.
In particular, IgA deposition is characteristic of HSP. C3 fragments may also
be aggregated with IgA.
ANCA-associated vasculitides are considered pauci-immune as few
immune reactants are present on immunofluorescence.
Rheumatoid vasculitis reveals a granular IgM and C3 deposition suggesting
immune-complex mediated disease.
TREATMENT

• In the absence of other organ involvement and underlying diseases, treatment of
CV is symptomatic.
Antihistamines and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may
be helpful.

399

Some severe cases may require corticosteroids.
If drug-induced vasculitis is suspected, stop the offending drug. Most cases
of drug-induced CV resolve within 2–3 weeks to a few months upon stopping
the offending medication.

• For chronic disease, steroid sparing agents may be used.
• The treatment of CV, as a manifestation of an underlying disorder, varies
according to the type of disorder and other organ involvement.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Follow-up is important as CV can be the first manifestation of a systemic disease or
malignancy.

Thromboangiitis Obliterans
Rebecca Brinker and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO), or Buerger’s disease, is a chronic,
recurring inflammatory occlusive disease of medium- and small-sized vessels
in the upper and lower extremities.

• It is characterized by segmental, nonatherosclerotic, thrombotic vessel stenosis,
and occlusion with
thrombophlebitis.

subsequent

limb

ischemia

and

necrosis

or

Epidemiology

• TAO tends to affect male smokers <40 years of age.
• In 1986 the United States prevalence rate of TAO was approximately 12.6
cases per 100,000.

• It is seen with at higher frequency among countries of the “old Silk Route,”
such as India, Israel, Japan, and Manipur.

• The highest prevalence is in Jewish men of Ashkenazi descent.
Pathophysiology

• The exact etiology of TAO is unknown but is clearly related to tobacco use.
• There is cellular, inflammatory thrombus occluding the lumen, with sparing of
the blood vessel wall.

• Increased cellular immunity to Type I and III collagens has been demonstrated.1
• There may be a role for prothrombotic factors in the pathophysiology of TAO.
Prothrombin gene mutation 20210 and anticardiolipin antibodies are
associated with an increased risk of the disorder.2

• TAO may be pathologically divided into three phases:3
401

Acute: Occlusive highly cellular inflammatory thrombi in distal limb arteries
or veins composed of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, micro-abscesses, and
multinucleated giant cells.
Intermediate: Organization of thrombus.
Chronic: Organized thrombus and vascular fibrosis are now prominent,
without inflammatory infiltrate. At this stage the biopsy is nonspecific and
these findings are common in other types of vascular occlusive disease.
Risk Factors

• Smoking, especially heavy smokers (>1.5 packs per day) and those who use
raw tobacco.

• There have been case reports of TAO in patients who use smokeless tobacco,
snuff, or cigars.

• Possibly chronic anaerobic periodontal infections.4
• Chronic arsenic poisoning.
Prevention

• Abstinence of tobacco use is the only known preventative measure.
• No clear evidence that second-hand smoke increases prevalence.
DIAGNOSIS

• Definitive diagnosis is by biopsy of the affected limb revealing pathology
consistent with an acute phase lesion in the vessels of the affected limb in the
appropriate clinical setting.

• Other causes of distal extremity ischemia must be ruled out.
Clinical Presentation

• Typically seen in male smokers, <40 years of age.
• Ischemia usually starts at distal fingertips or toes and progresses proximally.
• Ischemic findings and symptoms may occur (e.g., claudication or ulcerations).
402

Ulcerations are a more common initial symptom because TAO has the
tendency to affect smaller arteries first.

• Pain at rest and sensory deficits are very common and are usually secondary
to ischemic neuritis.

• Migratory superficial thrombophlebitis and Raynaud’s phenomenon are
present in about 40% of patients.3,5

• Signs of peripheral vascular disease (e.g., extremity poikilothermia, pallor,
pulselessness, and paresthesia) are present in the affected as well as unaffected
limbs.

• TAO rarely affects the cerebral, coronary, mesenteric, pulmonary, iliac or
renal arteries, or the aorta. However, if these arteries are affected, ischemic
symptoms in the affected organ may be seen.
History

• Digital pain, ulceration, or color changes from blood vessel obstruction and
eventual tissue necrosis.

• Claudication of upper or lower extremities with use.
• Superficial thrombophlebitis may occur before digital ischemia.
• Symptoms and color changes consistent with Raynaud’s phenomenon.
• Nonspecific, episodic, joint pains in the extremities may be observed months to
years before the occlusive phase of the disease.
Most commonly affected joints are wrists and knees.
Physical Examination

• Digital ulcerations and necrosis that is usually bilateral.
• Claudication with exercise of the extremity in question.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon.
• Superficial thrombophlebitis.
• Altered Allen’s test (used to evaluate radial and ulnar perfusion of the hand).5
Diagnostic Criteria

403

• The American College of Rheumatology does not have diagnostic or
classification criteria for TAO. However, several authors have suggested such
criteria and most propose a combination of clinical, angiographic, and
histopathologic, as well as exclusionary findings.

• Commonly used criteria of Olin and colleagues are presented in Table 30-1.5
TABLE 30-1 CRITERIA FOR THROMBOANGIITIS OBLITERANS

Differential Diagnosis

• Thrombotic or embolic disease.
• Peripheral vascular disease.
• Cholesterol embolic disease.
• Trauma.
• Hypercoagulable states.
• Infection.
• Raynaud’s disease.
• Small vessel vasculitis.
Diagnostic Testing
There is no definitive laboratory or radiographic test to diagnose TAO. However,
disease mimics must be ruled out.
404

Laboratory

• Test for systemic vasculitis or other autoimmune disorders associated with
vasculitis. Consider checking antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil
cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), rheumatoid factor (RF), anti-cyclic
citrullinated protein antibodies (CCP), complement levels, Scl-70 antibodies,
and antiphospholipid antibodies.
Autoimmune serologies should be negative. However, few patients with TAO
may have a low titer positive antiphospholipid screen.

• Evaluate for possible hypercoagulable states.
• Unlike some other vasculitides, TAO does not have laboratory signs of
systemic inflammation (e.g., elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and
C-reactive protein [CRP], thrombocytosis, normochromic normocytic anemia).

• Screen for diabetes mellitus.
Imaging
Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) with follow-up transesophageal
echocardiography (TEE) if there is suspicion of intra-cardiac thrombus.
Diagnostic Procedures
Arteriography

• Perform angiography of all the four limbs, even those without clinical
evidence of occlusive disease.

• Arteriogram should reveal normal proximal arteries with distal segmental
occlusive disease of small- and medium-sized vessels (e.g., palmar, plantar,
tibial, peroneal, radial, ulnar, or digital arteries) with severe distal disease
and collateralization around the occlusion (“corkscrew” collaterals).

• These findings are not pathognomonic as they may be seen in hypercoagulable
states, autoimmune diseases, and vasculitis.

• Disease-modifying interventions may also be taken during this diagnostic study.
TREATMENT

• Crucial to the treatment of TAO is complete smoking cessation.
• It is inconclusive, but unlikely, that second-hand smoke causes disease
405

exacerbation or progression.

• With complete tobacco cessation, patients can largely avoid amputation. 6
Patients may still have claudication or Raynaud’s phenomenon.

• Nicotine replacement therapy may also perpetuate disease activity.3,5
• Many medications are under investigation for treatment, but none have been
proven to be as beneficial as smoking cessation.
Medications

• Smoking cessation aids:
Do not use nicotine replacement therapy as this may duplicate disease
activity.
Consider some FDA approved non-nicotine containing medications such as
bupropion or varenicline.

• The following medications are investigational. Most have been tried in the
acute and chronic phases of the disease.
There is no study showing overwhelming support for the use of aspirin or
anticoagulation during acute or chronic phases of TAO.
Iloprost, a prostaglandin analog, may increase ulcer healing, decrease pain,
and reduce the need for amputation.7 These results have only been seen with
IV but not oral administration. Continuation or re-initiation of smoking may
completely blunt these potentially beneficial effects.
Thrombolytic therapy may be beneficial in a limited number of patients, but
remains investigational.
Calcium-channel blockers, b-blockers, and sildenafil may be of benefit.
However, clear cut evidence for efficacy is not available. These medications
have not been studied in prospective clinical trials.
Medications and procedures to promote therapeutic angiogenesis are
undergoing evaluation. Some of these small studies have showed promise in
increasing ulcer healing and decreasing ischemic pain.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Epidural spinal cord stimulators are under investigation.
• Few studies evaluating the effect of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cell
406

implantation for critical limb ischemia show short-term promising results.
However the long-term efficacy, safety, and complications are not well
defined.8,9
Surgical Management

• Ischemic digits may require amputation.
• Arterial bypass is usually not an option or recommended secondary to the
mostly distal and intermittent occlusive nature of the disease.
However, in other countries, there are reports of successful surgical bypass
with autologous vein or omental transfers.

• Sympathectomy may be tried in patients with resistant disease, but results are
mixed and controversial.
COMPLICATIONS

• Digit ischemia and loss that may become progressive, especially if the patient
continues to use tobacco products.

• Infection of necrotic tissue.
REFERRAL
Consider referral to vascular surgeon.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Educate the patient about the need to stop smoking!
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Hopefully, complete resolution with discontinuation of tobacco products.
Even if digital ischemia resolves, some patients may have persistent
Raynaud’s phenomenon, claudication, or rest pain.
If the patient continues to smoke, they are much more likely to require major
amputations.
407

• Amputation for digital necrosis.

Behçet’s Disease
Maria C. Gonzalez-Mayda and
John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Behçet’s disease (BD) is a systemic vasculitis characterized by recurrent
aphthous oral and genital ulcers and uveitis.

• Skin lesions, joint complaints, vascular disease, and neurologic manifestations
are also associated with BD and may be the presenting problem.

• It is relatively unique among the vasculitides in its ability to affect vessels of
any size.
Epidemiology

• Most commonly seen along the ancient Silk Route extending from eastern Asia
to the Mediterranean basin, but due to immigration BD has extended beyond
the Silk Route to other countries.

• Turkey has the highest prevalence of disease, estimated at 80 to 370
cases/100,000 population, whereas in the United States, the prevalence is
roughly 8.6/100,000 inhabitants.1

• BD is more common in men than in women, but prevalence data may be
inaccurate because women in some cultures may not seek medical attention for
their symptoms.

• Peak age of onset is in the mid-twenties to mid-thirties.
Pathophysiology

• BD is characterized by vascular injury, hyperfunctioning neutrophils, and
immune dysfunction.
409

• Vascular injury consists of vasculitis of small vessels with subsequent
vascular occlusion.

• Larger vessels demonstrate vasculitis of the vasa vasorum with aneurysmal
formation and superimposed hypercoagulability resulting in thrombosis.

• Active ulcerative lesions are infiltrated by hyperfunctioning neutrophils,
which have been stimulated by local hypersecretion of cytokines.

• Immune dysfunction is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of active
lesions and clonal expansion of T-cells.

• The main abnormality in BD has yet to be elucidated, but the clinical
manifestations appear to be due to vasculitis of various sized vessels in
affected organs.
Risk Factors

• HLA-B51 has been associated with BD in those countries with high prevalence
rates.2
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• In most series, the most common symptoms at presentation of BD include oral
and genital aphthosis, eye manifestations, and skin lesions.

• Oral aphthosis is the most common manifestation and is usually seen in
patients throughout the course of the disease.

• Genital aphthosis occurs less frequently.
• Ocular symptoms include changes in visual acuity, pain, photophobia,
lacrimation, floaters, and periorbital erythema.

• Approximately 10% of patients have eye involvement at presentation, while
approximately 50% develop manifestations during the course of the disease.

• Ocular manifestations, as the initial symptom, are more common in females, but
eye involvement tends to be more severe in males.

• Blindness occurs in approximately 25% of patients with eye involvement.
410

•

Cutaneous manifestations of BD
pseudofolliculitis, and acneiform nodules.

include

erythema

nodosum,

• Erythema nodosum is observed in approximately 50% of patients in the
course of disease and is more common in females.
Physical Examination

• Oral aphthosis begins as a raised area of redness that soon ulcerates.
Lesions are typically round or oval shaped, painful, 2 to 10 mm in size, with
a sharp erythematous border, a necrotic white-centered base, and a yellow
pseudomembrane.
They may occur on the gingiva, tongue, buccal, and labial membranes. They
heal within approximately 10 days but tend to recur frequently during the
first few years.

• Ocular findings include the following:
Anterior uveitis which tends to be recurrent and self-limited.
Hypopyon, a layer of pus in the anterior ocular chamber, may be visible.
This finding is classic for anterior uveitis.
Repeated attacks can cause iris deformity and glaucoma.
Retinal disease is characterized by vasculitis leading to vaso-occlusive
disease.
Attacks are recurrent and episodic and result in painless, gradual, bilateral
visual loss.
Retinal hemorrhage, exudative lesions, and cellular infiltration of the
vitreous humor are visible on examination.

• Cutaneous manifestations include the following:
Erythema nodosum: Recurrent and painful subcutaneous nodules that tend to
occur on the anterior portion of the lower legs and last for several weeks.
Nodules often leave an area of hyperpigmentation and, after spontaneous
resolution, they occasionally ulcerate.
Pseudofolliculitis and acneiform nodules are more common in men. The
lesions are found on the back, face, neck, and along the hairline, and are
often precipitated by shaving.
Genital ulcers are rarely the presenting symptoms of BD, but over the course
of the disease they appear in approximately 75% of patients.
411

They are similar in appearance to oral ulcers, but tend to be more painful,
larger, last longer, recur less frequently, and often leave scars.
In young women, the ulcers may be related temporally to the menstrual
cycle and may be the only manifestation of disease during the early years.
The pathergy test is performed by using two subcutaneous pricks with blunt
20-gauge sterile needles to one arm and two subcutaneous pricks with sharp
20-gauge sterile needles to the other arm.
A test is considered positive if a sterile erythematous papule >2 mm forms
at 48 hours.
Blunt needles seem to produce more positive reactions.
The test appears to have high specificity but sensitivity is variable.
Pathergy is less common in European and North American patients.

• Articular manifestations are common.
The inflammatory arthritis of BD is acute, nondeforming, nonerosive,
occasionally recurrent, and rarely chronic.
It tends to be monoarticular, commonly affecting the knee, followed by the
wrist, ankle, or elbow but it can also be oligoarticular or polyarticular.

• Venous thrombosis is a characteristic manifestation.
Superficial thrombophlebitis and deep venous thrombosis are common
after injury to vessels, including cannulation by angiocatheters.
Occlusions and aneurysms of major vessels can cause organ dysfunction,
hemorrhage, or infarction (e.g., Budd–Chiari syndrome or pulmonary
hemorrhage).
Embolic events are rare.

• Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in BD occurs in approximately
10% to 20% of patients.
This is more common and more severe in males, particularly if the disease
begins at a young age.
Manifestations including aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, focal
neurologic deficits, and personality changes tend to develop more than
5 years after the time of diagnosis.
Focal signs include pyramidal tract disease (e.g., spastic paralysis, Babinski
sign, clonus, and speech disturbances), brain stem disease (e.g., dysphagia
and fits of laughter alternating with crying), cerebellar ataxia, and
412

pseudobulbar palsy.
Sensory deficits are uncommon.
Intracranial venous thrombosis can lead to intracranial hypertension,
seizures, and hemorrhage.3
CNS BD tends to recur and becomes irreversible. In a study of 200 Turkish
patients, 41% have a relapsing–remitting course, 28% a secondary
progressive course, 10% a primary progressive course, and 21% had silent
neurologic involvement.4
In the terminal stage, approximately 30% of affected BD patients with CNS
manifestations may have dementia.
Aseptic meningitis or meningoencephalitis, early in the disease course,
successfully treated with steroids, carries a good prognosis.

• Other rare manifestations of BD include myocardial infarction, pulmonary
embolus, epididymitis and ileocecal, colonic, and esophageal ulceration.
TABLE 31-1 1990 INTERNATIONAL STUDY GROUP CLASSIFICATION
CRITERIA FOR BEHÇET’S DISEASE

Diagnostic Criteria

• The 1990 International Study Group classification criteria for BD are presented
in Table 31-1.5
A multi-ethnic study of 300 patients showed an overall sensitivity of 90%
and specificity of 95% but these varied significantly by race.6

• The 2006 International Criteria for Behçet’s Disease are presented in Table
31-2.7
413

A large cohort of Iranian patients demonstrated a sensitivity of 98%,
specificity of 95%, and diagnostic accuracy of 97% for these new criteria.8
Differential Diagnosis

• The differential diagnosis depends on the presenting clinical manifestations.
• If oral and genital ulcers are present, consider reactive arthritis as well as
inflammatory bowel disease.
TABLE 31-2 2006 PROPOSED INTERNATIONAL CRITERIA FOR
BEHÇET’S DISEASE

• If ocular manifestations and acneiform nodules are present, seronegative
arthropathies must be considered in the differential.

• Erythema nodosum, ileocecal involvement, and ulcerative mouth lesions may
suggest Crohn’s disease.

• Sarcoidosis may also produce erythema nodosum.
• CNS involvement may mimic multiple sclerosis and other neurologic
pathologies.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

414

• No specific test for BD is available. Laboratory findings may include an
elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and mild leukocytosis.

• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis may show elevated protein and IgG and
pleocytosis with high numbers of both lymphocytes and neutrophils.

• Joint fluid is inflammatory with increased neutrophils.
Imaging
If neurologic BD is suspected, MRI of the brain as well as magnetic resonance
venography (MRV) can show multiple high-intensity focal lesions in the brain stem,
basal ganglia, and white matter.
Diagnostic Procedures

• A positive pathergy test is often considered diagnostic.
• The result may not be consistent throughout the course of the disease, that is, it
may appear and then disappear.

• It is important to note that a positive pathergy test is much less frequently seen
in Western countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom than in
Eastern countries along the Silk Road.
TREATMENT
Treatment of BD depends on which manifestations are present, how severe they are,
and whether or not they are resistant to first-line treatment.
Medications
First Line

• Treatment is based on systems involved and the severity of that involvement.9
• Mucocutaneous aphthosis (oral and genital):
First-line treatment is colchicine at 1 mg/day.
Side effects are uncommon at this dose.
If there is inadequate response, the dose of colchicine may be increased;
however, this may be limited by the occurrence of undesirable side effects,
usually diarrhea.

415

• Uveitis/retinal vasculitis:
Anterior uveitis is treated with topical steroid drops (e.g., betamethasone,
1–2 drops tid) and mydriatic agents if the symptoms are mild and isolated.
Ophthalmologic referral is indicated.
More severe symptoms require systemic corticosteroids such as 0.5 mg/kg
daily of prednisone as first-line therapy.
Posterior uveitis is treated with either methotrexate (15 mg weekly) or
azathioprine (2–3 mg/kg daily) along with prednisone (0.5 mg/kg daily).
Retinal vasculitis should be treated first with a combination of IV
cyclophosphamide (750–1000 mg/m2 of body surface once monthly),
prednisone (0.5 mg/kg daily) and azathioprine (2–3 mg daily).

• Neurologic involvement is treated with IV cyclophosphamide and prednisone
at 1 mg/kg daily.

• Skin lesions are treated the same as mucocutaneous manifestations.
• Arthralgias/arthritis can usually be treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until resolution of symptoms.

• Thrombosis is treated with anticoagulation as normally would be done for any
clot; however, for clots in larger vessels, cyclophosphamide as well as
corticosteroids are often used.

• Gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are treated with low-dose
corticosteroids and sulfasalazine as first line.
Second Line

• Mucocutaneous aphthosis (oral and genital): Consider switching to
levamisole (150 mg once weekly), dapsone (100 mg daily), or thalidomide
(100–400 mg daily).
If no response is noted, consider switching to methotrexate (7.5 mg weekly)
or azathioprine (2–3 mg/kg daily).
Dermatology consultation may be valuable in this setting.
Add low-dose prednisolone for better results and taper as soon as possible.
If these fail, consider biologic agents.
In resistant cases of genital aphthosis, intra-lesional injection of
triamcinolone acetate may help heal the lesion.
416

• Uveitis/retinal vasculitis:
Anterior uveitis: Since anterior uveitis is known for recurrent attacks that
can eventually lead to cataracts and glaucoma, consider switching to
cytotoxic agents such as azathioprine or methotrexate in these cases.
Posterior uveitis: If no response is noted with either immunosuppressant,
consider switching to another cytotoxic agent such as chlorambucil,
cyclosporine, or IV cyclophosphamide. If still no response, consider a
biologic agent.
Retinal vasculitis: Consider switching to a biologic agent.

• Arthritis/arthralgias: If NSAIDs are ineffective, switch to either
methotrexate or azathioprine with low-dose corticosteroids.

• GI manifestations: Switch to high-dose steroids and IV cyclophosphamide if
first-line treatment does not work.

• In patients with refractory BD, unresponsive to the conventional treatment of
steroids and immunosuppressive agents, anti-tumor necrosis factor (antiTNF) agents may be effective. Although there are no large randomized control
trials on use of anti-TNF agents in BD, multiple case reports and case series
suggest that agents such as infliximab and etanercept should be considered in
patients with relapsing uveitis, active neurologic manifestations or other
symptoms related to BD that are life threatening and/or significantly affecting
their quality of life.10
Surgical Management

• Surgery is indicated for patients with bowel perforation or recurrent bleeding.
• Since surgical procedures can result in excessive infiltration of inflammatory
cells into treated tissues, intermediate doses of steroids may be used
perioperatively to prevent poor wound healing and avoid complications.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Frequency of follow-up depends on one’s assessment of disease activity and
requirements for monitoring drug toxicity.

Infectious Arthritis
Jeffrey Sparks and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Infectious arthritis is caused by bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and viruses.
• Prompt joint fluid analysis and culture is essential to the diagnosis of
infectious arthritis as well as tailoring specific antibiotic therapy.

• Empiric antibiotics are utilized while awaiting specific culture data.
• Treatment often requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving physical
therapy, orthopedic surgery, and infectious diseases consultations.
Definition
Infectious arthritis, also referred to as septic arthritis, is an acute monoarthritis or
oligoarthritis caused by an infectious agent, most often bacteria.
Classification

• Bacterial infectious arthritis is classically divided into gonococcal and nongonococcal arthritis.

• Other etiologies for infectious arthritis include viruses, mycobacteria, and
fungi.

• Please see Chapter 33 for discussion on Lyme disease.
Epidemiology
The estimated incidence of infectious arthritis in the United States is approximately
20,000 cases annually.
Etiology

419

• Most cases of bacterial arthritis in adults are caused by Staphylococcus
aureus, accounting for up to 80% of confirmed cases.1

• The second leading pathogen is Streptococcus pneumoniae, followed by
gram-negative bacteria, although any microbial pathogen is capable of
causing infectious arthritis.

• The leading cause of bacterial arthritis in young, sexually active adults is
Neisseria gonorrhoeae, with a male to female ratio of 1:4.

• Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for developing
opportunistic mycobacterial and fungal infections.

• Viral infections commonly associated with arthritis include hepatitis, rubella,
mumps, Epstein–Barr virus, parvovirus B19, enterovirus, adenovirus, and
HIV.
Pathophysiology

• Hematogenous spread is the most common route by which bacteria reach the
joint following inoculation through the skin or mucosa.

• Bacterial colonization usually occurs within the synovial lining, followed by
bacterial proliferation in the synovial fluid.

• The presence of bacteria in the joint capsule induces an inflammatory response,
recruiting leukocytes that propagate the inflammatory reaction through release
of cytokines.

• Bacterial products, the release of lysosomal enzymes, immune complex
deposition, complement activation, metalloproteases, and chondrocyte
inhibition all contribute to articular damage.

• Non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis is typically more damaging than gonococcal
arthritis.
Risk Factors

• Intravenous drug users, immunocompromised patients, those with
prosthetic joints or heart valves, and chronic debilitating diseases (such as
cancer) all have an increased risk for infectious arthritis, especially with gramnegative organisms.

420

• Immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for developing
opportunistic mycobacterial and fungal infections as well.

• Advanced age and comorbid conditions such as diabetes and chronic renal
insufficiency are risk factors for infectious arthritis.

• Patients with underlying inflammatory arthritis, especially rheumatoid
arthritis, are more prone to bacterial arthritis.

• Sepsis and bacteremia can lead to seeding of joints, and increase the risk of
infectious arthritis.

• Direct inoculation via arthrocentesis or arthroscopy can occur but is quite
uncommon, <1%.2

• Gonococcal arthritis should be considered in sexually active young patients
and patients engaging in high-risk sexual behavior. Other risk factors for
gonococcal arthritis include menstruation, pregnancy, and complement
deficiencies.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The acute onset of mono- or oligoarticular arthritis, especially in the setting
of a fever and constitutional symptoms, should raise the suspicion of
infectious arthritis.

• Delay in diagnosis can lead to rapid and severe joint destruction, causing
significant morbidity and increased mortality.
History

• The most common symptoms are joint pain, swelling, and fever.3
• Fever occurs in most patients, although up to 20% of patients may be afebrile.
Chills and rigors are unusual.

• 50% of cases involve the knee, followed by the hip, shoulder, wrist, ankle,
elbow, and small joints of the hands and feet. Up to 20% of cases may present
with polyarticular symptoms.

• Intravenous drug abusers tend to develop infectious arthritis in joints of the
axial skeleton including sternoclavicular and costochondral joints.
421

• History should focus on risk factors, recent trauma or procedures, high-risk
sexual behavior, and the presence of prosthetic joints.
Physical Examination

• The joint examination should include checking the ability to bear weight, range
of motion, and signs of soft tissue swelling, warmth, erythema, edema, and
synovitis within and around suspected joints.

• As hematogenous spread to the joint often occurs from distant sites, physical
examination should focus on identifying infection in such sites including the
skin, respiratory, cardiac, and genitourinary system.

• The respiratory examination should focus on evaluation for pneumonia,
pharyngitis, and sinusitis.

• The cardiac examination should include evaluation for new murmurs or
friction rubs.

• The genitourinary examination should include evaluation for flank pain,
urethritis, and cervicitis.

• A careful skin examination should be performed for signs of cellulitis. Papules,
pustules, bullae, or necrotic lesions are especially suggestive of gonococcal
arthritis.

• Tenosynovitis, dermatitis, and migratory polyarthritis are the classic triad
for disseminated gonococcal infections. Urethritis in men is more likely to be
symptomatic than cervicitis in women.
Diagnostic Criteria
The presence of a pathogen in synovial fluid culture is the most specific finding in
the diagnosis of septic arthritis. However, timing of antibiotic therapy,
arthrocentesis technique, and limitations in microbiologic analysis may affect culture
results.
Differential Diagnosis
In addition to infectious arthritis, the differential diagnosis of acute monoarthritis
includes trauma, crystalline arthritis (gout and pseudogout), early stages of
inflammatory polyarthritis (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis and seronegative
spondyloarthropathies), acute rheumatic fever, infectious bursitis, and Lyme disease.
422

Diagnostic Testing
Testing should focus on promptly establishing the diagnosis of infectious arthritis
and identifying the responsible pathogen.
Laboratories

• Blood cultures should be obtained prior to initiation of antibiotics in an effort
to isolate the responsible pathogen.

• Inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell (WBC) count, erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP), are often elevated.
The peripheral WBC count is elevated in approximately half of the affected
patients.

• Culture samples from cervix, urethra, rectum, pharynx, and skin lesions
may be helpful in isolating a pathogen, especially if gonococcal arthritis is
suspected.

• Cultures for unusual organisms should be ordered in cases of suspected
tuberculosis, penetrating trauma, animal bites, travel to areas endemic with
particular fungal organisms, immunocompromised patients, or monoarthritis
refractory to conventional antibiotic therapy.

• For Lyme disease, serologies may improve diagnostic yield.
Imaging

• Plain radiographs of the suspected joint can be helpful in evaluating joint
destruction, bony involvement, effusions, erosions, chondrocalcinosis, and
extent of disease, but are rarely helpful in the acute setting as radiographic
changes of bone and joint destruction may take days to weeks to develop.
Radiographic exams help exclude fractures, tumors, and osteomyelitis.

• For difficult to access joints, radiographic guidance with ultrasound,
fluoroscopy, or computed tomography may be necessary for joint aspiration.

• MRI is useful in assessing whether there is osteomyelitis or adjacent abscess,
particularly in joints such as the sternoclavicular that may be difficult to
visualize on plain films.

• Echocardiography can be useful to evaluate for endocarditis as a source of
septic emboli, especially in patients with sepsis, bacteremia, known
valvulopathy, or intravenous drug abuse.

423

Diagnostic Procedures
Arthrocentesis

• Prompt synovial fluid analysis is essential for diagnosing infectious arthritis
and guiding appropriate antibiotic therapy. Arthrocentesis should be
performed in any patient presenting with monoarticular joint pain with an
effusion. Entering a site with active cellulitis is to be avoided to prevent
further seeding of infection.

• Aspiration of purulent drainage is highly suspicious of infectious arthritis.
• The presence of crystals does not exclude the diagnosis of infectious
arthritis.

• WBC counts >50,000/μL with a predominance of polymorphonuclear
neutrophils is consistent with infectious arthritis. The higher the WBC count,
the greater the likelihood ratio (LR) for septic arthritis (>50,000/μL LR 7.7;
>100,000/μL LR 28.0).3

• Routine Gram stain may show bacteria which can guide initial therapy. For
non-gonococcal infections, these are positive 50% to 75% of the time.

• Chemistries such as lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose, and protein have
limited value, although elevated LDH and low glucose is consistent with
bacterial infection.

• Special stains and culture, such as acid-fast bacillus stain and fungal cultures,
are to be considered for atypical presentation or immunosuppressed patients.

• Microbiologic culture growth of an organism capable of causing infectious
arthritis is most helpful in guiding antibiotic therapy. This data may take days
to be finalized and may be falsely negative depending on antibiotic timing and
arthrocentesis technique.

• For suspected gonococcal infection, conventional Gram stain and routine
cultures are less sensitive. Cultures of synovial fluid on chocolate agar or
Thayer–Martin media may enhance recovery.

• Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of synovial fluid to detect gonococcal
DNA may also increase diagnostic yield.
TREATMENT

424

• The mainstay of treatment of bacterial arthritis includes intravenous
antibiotics and joint drainage.

• For non-gonococcal arthritis, initial antimicrobial therapy should be based on
the results of the Gram stain and the clinical setting. If no organisms are seen
on Gram stain, broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage for both gram-positive
and gram-negative organisms should be initiated. Coverage for methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) on local community rates,
comorbidity, indwelling catheters, and healthcare exposure.

• The mortality rate associated with septic arthritis is about 10%, and as high as
perhaps 50% in polyarticular disease.
Medications
Non-gonococcal Arthritis

• If MRSA coverage is not required, coverage for gram-positive organisms with
anti-staphylococcal penicillin such as oxacillin or nafcillin is adequate.

• For MRSA coverage, empiric therapy with vancomycin (30 mg/kg daily IV in
two divided doses) is sufficient. Dosage should be based on weight, renal
function, and subsequent drug levels to ensure therapeutic dosage.

• Third-generation cephalosporins, such as ceftriaxone (2 g IV q24h),
ceftazidime (1–2 g IV q8h), or cefotaxime (2 g IV q8h), should be started for
empiric coverage for gram-negative organisms.

• If Pseudomonas aeruginosa is considered to be a possible pathogen, cefepime
(1 g IV q8h) or ceftazidime with an aminoglycoside such as gentamicin (3–5
mg/kg daily in two to three divided doses) should be initiated.

• When available, culture results and antimicrobial sensitivities should guide
treatment.

• Atypical or resistant organisms may require consultation from infectious
diseases to tailor antimicrobial therapy.

• Most cases of infectious arthritis require 2 to 4 weeks of intravenous
antibiotics. Once a pathogen has been established as causative, this course can
often be completed as an outpatient.
Gonococcal Arthritis

425

• If gonococcal arthritis is suspected, empiric therapy for disseminated
gonococci infection should be initiated.

• Ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h should be continued for 24 to 48 hours after clinical
improvement. This can then be switched to oral cefixime 400 mg PO q12h,
ciprofloxacin 500 mg PO q12h, or ofloxacin 400 mg PO q12h for 1 week.
Non-bacterial arthritis

• Arthralgias and non-bacterial infectious arthritis are common with many viral
infections.

• Viral arthritis tends to present with symmetric polyarthralgias or polyarthritis
and may be accompanied by a typical viral exanthem.

• Supportive treatment with rest and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) is usually effective and sufficient.
Surgical Management

• Surgical or arthroscopic drainage is often necessary in cases of septic hip
joints, septic arthritis with concurrent osteomyelitis, septic arthritis in a
prosthetic joint, persistent infections, complex anatomy, or loculated effusions.

• Most joints can be adequately drained by arthrocentesis or closed needle
aspiration. Daily aspiration is generally necessary, as certain joints (e.g., the
knee) may accumulate fluid for up to ten days. Serial cell counts and cultures
document response to antibiotic therapy.

• Open drainage, arthroscopy, and joint replacement are options for severe and
refractory cases.

• Patients with suspected infections involving prosthetic joints warrant prompt
orthopedic surgery consultation.
REFERRAL
Complicated joint infections often require a multidisciplinary approach, most often
involving orthopedic surgery, infectious diseases, physical therapy, and
occupational therapy.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
426

• Patients should be followed closely with frequent joint examinations for the
first few weeks of treatment with antibiotics.

• Repeated arthrocentesis should confirm sterilization of synovial fluid and
decreasing WBC count.

• Failure to improve may warrant alteration in antibiotic regimen or surgical
consultation.

• Early rehabilitation should include physical therapy with joint mobilization to
prevent loss of joint range of motion.

• Patients should be monitored for side effects from antimicrobials with
complete blood counts (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panels (CMP), and
drug levels, as appropriate.

• ESR and CRP are helpful to follow serially to confirm that inflammation is
resolving.

Lyme Disease
Rebecca Brinker and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Lyme disease is a multisystem illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia
burgdorferi. B. burgdorferi is the only species found in the United States
while all the three species (B. burgdorferi, B. afzelii, and B. garinii) are
found in Europe. Clinical manifestations and severity of disease may vary with
the infecting species. Only B. burgdorferi manifestations will be addressed in
this chapter.

• Lyme disease is the most common tick borne illness in the United States
and is transmitted by the Ixodes tick (blacklegged tick or deer tick).

• It was initially described in 1977 as “Lyme arthritis” after an outbreak of
suspected juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, which was in reality Lyme arthritis, in
Old Lyme, Connecticut.

• The incidence of Lyme disease in the United States has continued to increase
since its identification. This is thought to be secondary to the increased deer
population and consequent increase in Ixodesticks.

• According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) there were
approximately 30,000 confirmed cases of Lyme disease in the United States in
2009.

• When a case of Lyme disease is identified, it should be reported to the CDC.
Epidemiology

• Lyme disease is transmitted to humans by the Ixodes tick. The tick has four
developmental stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. Only ticks in nymph and
sometimes larva stage transmit Lyme disease to humans.

• The Ixodes tick life cycle:
The egg hatches into larva in the spring. The larvae feed on small rodents
428

(e.g., white-footed mouse) and acquire the spirochete infection from these
asymptomatic carriers.
In the fall the larvae become dormant for the winter, but molt into nymphs the
next spring.
The small nymphs feed on rodents, rabbits, and humans. When the nymph
feeds, the spirochete is incidentally transmitted to the host during periods of
extended attachment.
By fall the nymph matures into an adult. The adult transmits the spirochete
less often because it is larger, less likely to go unnoticed during attachment
and not present during peak hiking season.

• Deer are important in the life cycle of the Ixodes tick as they act as blood meal
for the adults, thus perpetuating the tick’s life cycle.
Etiology

• B. burgdorferi is a spirochete, a motile corkscrew-shaped bacterium, with an
outer and an inner membrane and flagella.

• The tick must be attached for 48 hours or more to transmit the spirochete.
Pathophysiology

• The pathophysiology of Lyme disease is not completely understood, but disease
manifestations are thought to be from infection with the spirochete itself as
well as the host’s immune response to the infection.

• A few pertinent observations include1:
Patients with HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR2 are more likely to develop chronic
arthritis that may be erosive.
Spirochetes have been isolated from all affected tissues, except the
peripheral nerves.
Optimum control of the infection requires an intact innate and adaptive
immune response.
B. burgdorferi does not produce toxins or destructive proteases to harm the
host.
Risk Factors
429

• There is a bimodal incidence of infection, ages 5 to 9 and 55 to 59.
• Greater than 50% of cases occur in males.
• Residence in the upper Midwest of the United States and entry into heavily
forested areas.

• The location of tick bite on the body is important. Less visualized areas allow
for longer tick attachment time and therefore increase the possibility of
spirochete transmission.

• The most active season for infection is May to July, with the highest infection
rate in June. Clinical peak of disease manifestations lags 2 to 3 weeks behind
inoculation.
Prevention

• Remove ticks promptly.
• Wear insect repellent when in endemic areas.
• Rodent management.
DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis is clinical, manifestations may vary by stage and laboratory data is
only supportive.
Clinical Presentation
History

• Patients may or may not recall a tick bite or erythema migrans (EM).
• They may complain of constitutional or organ-specific symptoms based on the
stage of disease at presentation.

• Constitutional symptoms may include fever, fatigue, myalgias, arthralgias, and
headache.
Physical Examination

• EM lesions are usually warm, itchy, and nonpainful. They expand slowly over
days to weeks and may reach a diameter of 20 cm or more.
430

• The lesion may develop a central clearing, classically known as the “bull’seye” lesion. This is usually only seen in large lesions that have been present
for days.

• Lesions are typically found in the intertriginous areas, popliteal fossa, and belt
line.

• In one study of 118 microbiologically confirmed cases, EM lesions appeared in
these patterns2:
Homogenous erythema (59%)
Central erythema (32%)
Central clearing (9%)
Vesicular or ulcerated (7%)
Central purpura (2%)
Stage I, Early Localized Disease

• Characterized by the appearance of EM.
This rash is an expanding annular red macule or papule at the site of the tick
bite and is a sign of spirochetemia.
This rash occurs within 3 days to one month after infection and resolves
within 3 to 4 weeks.
The rash occurs in 60% to 80% of patients, but may go unnoticed
secondary to its location.

• Patients may report malaise, headache, fever, neck stiffness, arthralgias,
myalgias, localized lymphadenopathy, and fatigue.
Stage II, Early Disseminated Disease

• Multiple EM lesions (in locations other than the primary bite) result from
hematogenous spread of the spirochete. These lesions are seen days to weeks
after the primary infection.

• Systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, headache, arthralgias, and myalgias
become more severe. These symptoms may be constant or intermittent.

• Cardiac involvement occurs weeks to months after primary infection and may
be the sole manifestation of disseminated disease.
Cardiac disease is rare in patients infected with B. burgdorferi but occurs
431

more commonly with other species of Borrelia.
Symptoms include palpitations, lightheadedness, syncope, chest pain, and
shortness of breath.
Most common manifestations are varying degrees of heart block.
Myocarditis and pericarditis are less common, often self-limited and
frequently clinically silent. Myocarditis may result in transient cardiomegaly
and pericarditis is associated with mild pericardial effusions.
No confirmed cases of valvular damage or chronic cardiomyopathy
secondary to Lyme disease have occurred in the United States.

• Neurologic involvement occurs weeks to months after primary infection and
may affect up to 20% of untreated patients.
The most common manifestation is cranial neuropathy, especially unilateral
or bilateral Bell’s palsy.
Meningoencephalitis may also occur.

• Articular involvement occurs 6 or more months after infection and affects
about 60% of untreated patients.
Arthritis is oligoarticular with lower extremity predominance, particularly
the knee, and is associated with large inflammatory effusions.
Few patients have persistent arthritis even after antibiotic treatment and are
classified as having antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis.
Stage III, Late Lyme Disease

• Occurs months to years after the primary infection and does not have to be
preceded by manifestations of stage I or II disease.

• The most common manifestation is episodic, lower extremity predominant
oligoarthritis.

• Chronic neurologic sequelae such as radiculopathy, axonal polyneuropathy, or
encephalomyelitis may rarely occur.
Differential Diagnosis

• Cellulitis
• Meningitis
432

• Dementia
• Multiple sclerosis
• Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
• Radiculopathy
• Depression
• Ehrlichiosis
• Babesiosis
• Rocky mountain spotted fever
• Reactive arthritis
• Rheumatoid arthritis
• Fibromyalgia
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory

• Confirmatory laboratory testing is not necessary for diagnosis, especially if the
patient has an EM rash. A seropositive test alone is not adequate to
establish the diagnosis.

• The spirochete is difficult to culture as it grows under microaerophilic or
anaerobic conditions. The highest yield for culture is a skin biopsy from the
border of the primary EM rash in an untreated patient. Spirochetes may be
found in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and very rarely in the synovial
fluid. Cultures may take up to 12 weeks to reveal the spirochete.

• The CDC recommends two-step serum testing.
Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence
assay (IFA) as the screening test is designed to be very sensitive. If positive
or equivocal, the same serum should be evaluated with Western blot. If the
ELISA or IFA is negative, it is highly unlikely the patient has Lyme disease
or the testing has occurred too early after primary infection (less than 6
weeks).
Western blot is a more specific test and only run if the ELISA or IFA is
positive.3 If the IgM antibody is positive, the patient should be retested in 4
to 6 weeks as they may have early infection. If IgG antibody is positive, the
433

patient is considered to have infection.
IgM antibodies usually appear 1 to 2 weeks after infection.
IgG antibodies usually appear 2 to 6 weeks after infection.
After successful treatment, antibody levels may remain positive but
titers should fall over time. Titer level and rate of resolution do not
correlate with disease severity, chronicity, or treatment.
Seropositivity occurs in less than 40% of patients with early skin disease
but more often in patients with early disseminated extracutaneous disease.
Patients with late Lyme disease are almost always IgG positive.

• A lumbar puncture is recommended in patients with neurologic manifestations
in an effort to rule out other causes and potentially support the diagnosis.
IgG and IgM antibodies in the CSF help confirm the diagnosis, but are not
mandatory.
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of CSF has low sensitivity.

• Synovial fluid is inflammatory with an average white blood cell (WBC) count
of about 25,000/mm3 and polymorphonuclear leukocytes predominate.

• Mild elevations in transaminases have been observed.
• Although offered by some health departments, testing of ticks removed from a
patient is not recommended as presence of the spirochete does not guarantee
human infection.
Electrocardiography

• Electrocardiographic abnormalities are only seen in disseminated infection.
• Sustained or intermittent first-, second-, or third-degree heart block occurs
depending on the location of conduction system dysfunction.

• Variable bundle branch blocks may also be seen.
• Pericarditis can manifest as diffuse ST and T wave elevations.
Imaging

• MRI of the brain may be helpful to rule out other pathology. There are no
specific MRI findings in Lyme disease.

• Transthoracic echocardiogram is used to evaluate for the presence of
myocarditis and pericarditis.
434

Diagnostic Procedures

• Diagnostic procedures are generally not necessary and often not recommended.
If performed, it is frequently in an effort to rule out other diagnoses. Such
procedures may include:
Skin biopsy
Myocardial biopsy
Lumbar puncture
Electromyography and nerve conduction studies
TREATMENT
Medications
Early Lyme Disease

• Early Lyme disease manifested as only EM may be treated with doxycycline,
amoxicillin, or cefuroxime, all of which have equivalent effectiveness.

• Dosing guidelines in adults are as follows4,5:
Doxycycline 100 mg PO bid for 10 to 21 days.
Amoxicillin 500 mg PO tid for 14 to 21 days.
Cefuroxime axetil 500 mg PO bid for 14 to 21 days.
Macrolides are not recommended.

• Doxycycline is generally preferred because it has better central nervous
system (CNS) penetration.

• Doxycycline also covers the possibility of coincident Anaplasma
phagocytophilum infection which is also transmitted by the Ixodes tick.
Early Disseminated Lyme Disease

• IV antibiotics are recommended if there is CNS involvement (except
isolated facial palsy).4,5
IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin may be used. Duration of therapy is
usually between 10 and 28 days.
Isolate Lyme disease with facial palsy can be treated with a 14 to 21 day
course of oral doxycycline.
Recovery of neurologic symptoms may lag behind clearance of the spirochete
435

and therefore cannot be used to guide length of therapy.

• For cardiac involvement, IV ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, or penicillin is given
until resolution of heart block. After cardiac recovery, the patient may be
switched to oral therapy to complete a total 21-day course of antibiotics.4,5
Late Lyme Disease

• This is mainly manifested by arthritis and often treated successfully with one
month of oral doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil.4,5

• If this fails, another 4-week oral course or 2 to 4 weeks of IV antibiotics may
be given.4,5

• The existence of chronic symptomatic B. burgdorferi infection after
appropriate antibiotic treatment is rather controversial. The Infectious Disease
Society of America does not recommend extended antibiotic treatment for
patient with ≥6 months of subjective symptoms.4–6
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

• Monitor for tick bites.
• Use insect repellent when in endemic areas.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

• Must rule out other diseases in differential diagnosis as seropositivity is not
adequate for diagnosis.

• Pregnant women should not be treated with tetracyclines. Nor should
doxycycline be given to young (<8 years old) children.
COMPLICATIONS

• Complications depend on the stage of infection and may include:
Acute or chronic arthritis.
Cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, pericarditis.
Neuropathy, radiculopathy, encephalopathy.
Cognitive dysfunction, dementia.
436

Conjunctivitis.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Tick Management Handbook from the CDC.
• CDC website: www.cdc.gov/lyme (last access 2/5/12).
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• If seropositive at diagnosis, repeat testing is not recommended as titers do
not reflect efficacy of treatment.

• The best evaluation of improvement is to monitor the patient’s symptoms and
resolution of organ dysfunction.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Children and patients treated at earlier stages of infection have a better acute
and long-term prognosis.

• Infection is rarely fatal.
• Arthritis may take months to resolve or be chronic.
• Cardiac damage and dysfunction is rarely long term.
• Cranial palsies usually resolve after treatment.
• Myocarditis and pericarditis usually resolve after treatment.

Acute Rheumatic Fever
Jeffrey Sparks and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Acute rheumatic fever is characterized by arthritis, carditis, chorea, erythema
marginatum, and subcutaneous nodules occurring after a group A streptococcal
pharyngeal infection.

• Early treatment and long-term prophylaxis with antibiotics are important
measures to prevent long-term sequelae such as valvular heart disease.
Definition

• Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a delayed reaction to a group A β-hemolytic
streptococcal pharyngeal infection, occurring 2 to 3 weeks after the initial
infection.

• Diagnosis is based on the revised Jones criteria (see Table 34-1).1
Epidemiology

• ARF occurs almost exclusively in children and adolescents.
• ARF was associated with significant morbidity and mortality until the late
1800s. There was a dramatic decline in cases after this period which has been
attributed to changes in living conditions and bacterial virulence.

• The introduction of antibiotics in the twentieth century significantly reduced the
incidence of ARF. By 1962, the incidence had declined to 100/100,000 in
many European countries.

• ARF presently continues unabated in developing countries and there are nearly
400,000 new cases each year. The estimated prevalence rate of rheumatic heart
disease is over 15 million, which, depending on the screening method, may be
an underestimate.2–4

• The incidence of disease in the United States ranges from 0.5 to 1.88 per
439

100,000 children. Some areas of the United States have experienced an
unexplained recent increase in disease incidence.5
Pathophysiology

• The pathogenesis of ARF is not clearly understood. Group A streptococcal
pharyngeal infection, either clinical or subclinical, is necessary for the
development of ARF.

• Cellulitis, impetigo, and glomerulonephritis, also caused by group A
streptococci, do not cause ARF.

• Some studies suggest that only a few M serotypes of group A streptococcus
cause ARF, which are referred to as rheumatogenic strains.

• Genetic susceptibility and molecular mimicry, involving the cross-reaction
between group A streptococcal antigens and host antigens, likely play a role in
the pathogenesis of ARF.
TABLE 34-1 REVISED JONES CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS OF ACUTE
RHEUMATIC FEVER

440

Prevention

• Primary prevention of ARF consists of recognition of acute group A
streptococcal pharyngitis and appropriate antibiotic treatment.

• Penicillin remains the treatment of choice.6,7
Penicillin V 500 mg bid to tid PO for 10 days. For children under 60 pounds,
the dose is 250 mg.
Benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units IM once. For children under 60
pounds, the dose is 600,000 units.

• For penicillin allergic patients, appropriate oral alternatives are clindamycin,
azithromycin, and clarithromycin.6,7
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• ARF is characterized by a constellation of symptoms that arises 2 to 4 weeks
after pharyngeal infection.

• The classic manifestations include arthritis, carditis, neurologic involvement,
and rash.

• Arthritis is usually the first symptom of ARF.
It is a migratory polyarthritis of the larger joints, (e.g., knees, elbows,
ankles, and wrists) and usually starts on the lower extremity. Typically, 6 to
16 joints are affected.
The involved joints become tender without evidence of inflammation.
Joints may only be involved for a week before other joints become affected
and the initial joint involvement subsides.
The synovial fluid is generally inflammatory but sterile.

• Carditis is an important manifestation of ARF, as it often results in long-term
damage.
ARF can involve any area of the heart, including pericardium, epicardium,
myocardium, endocardium, and valvular structures.
There may be no symptoms despite cardiac involvement or patients may
experience chest discomfort and dyspnea.
Physical examination may elicit a new murmur.
441

Mitral valvulitis associated with ARF classically causes mitral stenosis, and
a low-pitched early diastolic murmur at the apex (Carey Coombs murmur).
Chronic mitral valve destruction can progress to mitral regurgitation, with a
holosystolic apical murmur.
Aortic valvulitis leads to aortic stenosis, with a high-pitched decrescendo
murmur along the left sternal border, heard best with the patient leaning
forward. Chronic aortic valve destruction can lead to aortic insufficiency,
with a late decrescendo systolic murmur and early diastolic murmur at the
right upper sternal border.
On examination, one may also find evidence of pericarditis, heart failure, or
cardiomyopathy.

• The best known neurologic manifestation of ARF is known as Sydenham’s
chorea, also called chorea minor and the St. Vitus dance.
Chorea is characterized by nonrhythmic involuntary abrupt movements and
muscle weakness. Usually the movements are more distinct on one side.
Muscle weakness is rhythmic, with the strength increasing and decreasing on
exertion.
Frequently, emotional instability (e.g., crying, agitation, and inappropriate
behavior) accompanies the chorea.

• Skin manifestations of ARF include erythema marginatum and subcutaneous
nodules.
Erythema marginatum is a faint, pink, nonpruritic rash that erupts across the
trunk, upper arms, and legs; facial involvement does not occur.
The lesion begins with a central area of normal skin and extends outward
to a distinct border.
The rash is transient, coming and going within hours and worsened by hot
conditions (e.g., baths and showers).
The rash usually occurs at the onset of disease, but it may recur at any time,
including convalescence.
Subcutaneous nodules are firm, nontender nodules under non-inflamed skin
that occur on bony prominences and near tendons.
They may be solitary or occur in groups. They are symmetric, typically
occur on the extensor surfaces, and usually resolve within 4 weeks.
The subcutaneous nodules of ARF differ from those of RA in that they are
smaller, more transient, are typically found on the olecranon and
442

sometimes on the back.8
Both erythema marginatum and subcutaneous nodules usually occur only in
the presence of carditis.

• Other symptoms may include abdominal pain, persistent tachycardia, malaise,
anemia, epistaxis, and chest pain.1
Diagnostic Criteria

• The diagnosis of ARF is clinical and based on the revised Jones criteria (Table
34-1).1

• A diagnosis can be made in the setting of recent streptococcal pharyngeal
infection if:
Two major criteria are present.
One major and two minor criteria are present.

• Exceptions to the Jones criteria:
Sydenham’s chorea may be delayed and, therefore, it can be difficult to
demonstrate evidence of a preceding group A streptococcal infection.
Indolent carditis.
Prior history of ARF.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of ARF includes bacterial infections (e.g., septic arthritis,
osteomyelitis, and bacterial endocarditis), viral infections (e.g., infectious
mononucleosis and Coxsackie virus), rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus
erythematosus, and malignancies (e.g., lymphoma and leukemia).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Evidence of recent streptococcal infection
Increased titers of streptococcal antibodies in serum (e.g., antistreptolysin
O, DNase B, hyaluronidase, or streptokinase).
Positive throat culture for Group A beta-hemolytic streptococci.

• Markers of inflammation, including white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive
443

protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), may be elevated.
Electrocardiography

• ECG classically shows prolonged PR interval in acute rheumatic fever but this
is a nonspecific finding.

• Other nonspecific ECG changes include T wave flattening, ST segment and
repolarization abnormalities, and P wave abnormalities.
Imaging
Echocardiography is useful to characterize possible cardiac involvement, including
valvulopathy and cardiomyopathy.
TREATMENT
Treatment of ARF should include symptom relief, antibiotic treatment, and
prophylaxis.
Medications

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially aspirin, are
useful for symptomatic relief.
Aspirin 4 to 8 g/day for adults.
NSAIDs can be continued until patient is asymptomatic and markers of
inflammation normalize.

• Treatment of chorea includes the use of antiepileptic drugs such as
phenobarbital, phenytoin, and diazepam.

• Penicillin is the treatment of choice for ARF, either IM or PO.6
Benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units IM once. For children under 60
pounds the dose is 600,000 units.
Penicillin V 500 mg PO bid to tid for 10 days. For children under 60 pounds
the dose is 250 mg.
If a penicillin allergy is present, azithromycin or clindamycin can be used.
Family members and close contacts should have throat culture and treatment
if the culture is positive for beta-hemolytic streptococci.

444

Prophylaxis

• Prophylaxis for recurrent ARF (secondary prevention) is important as
symptoms can return, most commonly within 2 years.
Penicillin or erythromycin should be begun immediately after the initial 10day antibiotic treatment course: Penicillin V 250 mg PO bid or erythromycin
250 mg PO bid if a penicillin allergy is present.6
Benzathine penicillin G 1.2 million units IM every 4 weeks is preferred
prophylaxis for high risk individuals.6
Duration of prophylaxis is controversial, but a 5- to 10-year course is usually
recommended.6
COMPLICATIONS
Cardiac involvement with valvular damage is the most common and serious longterm sequela of ARF.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Cardiac involvement is the most serious sequela of ARF. Patients may
develop significant valvular abnormalities and heart failure even decades
after the initial event.

• ARF requires long-term prophylaxis and sometimes monthly antibiotic
injections for years.

• After the planned course for secondary prophylaxis, the risk for group A
streptococcal re-exposure and valvular disease should be assessed.

Inflammatory Myopathies
Hyon Ju Park and Prabha Ranganathan
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The inflammatory myopathies (IM) are a heterogeneous group of disorders
characterized by muscle weakness and inflammation of skeletal muscles (myositis).
Classification

• The three major distinct IM are polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM),
and inclusion body myositis (IBM).

• Other IM include juvenile DM, malignancy-associated myositis, eosinophilic
myositis, granulomatous myositis, and myositis in overlap with other
connective tissue diseases (Table 35-1) but this chapter will focus on the three
major distinct types mentioned above.1
Epidemiology

• IM are rare, systemic, connective tissues diseases with an estimated incidence
of 1 in 100,000.

• PM and DM have a bimodal distribution of prevalence: one in childhood (ages
5–15) and the other in midlife (ages 30–50). IBM peaks after the age of 50.

• Females are affected more often (3:1) in DM and PM. IBM affects more men
than women (3:1).

• African Americans are at increased risk for IM and when they have the disease,
tend to have poorer outcomes.
Etiology

• Etiology is unknown but is likely a result of environmental influences that
trigger chronic immune activation in genetically susceptible individuals.
447

Genetic factors: Several alleles in the MHC locus have been identified to
confer a genetic risk for IM while others have been found to be protective.
The DRB1*0301-DQA1*0501 haplotype confers the strongest risk while
HLA DQA1*0201 seems protective for all forms of IM.2
Autoimmunity: About 50% of patients have myositis-specific, while another
25% have myositis-associated antibodies.
Environmental influences: Infections with group A streptococcus and
influenza have the strongest evidence of association with onset of IM.
Reports of temporal, seasonal, and even geographic clustering of cases also
suggest strong environmental influences.
TABLE 35-1 MYOSITIS-ASSOCIATED AUTOANTIBODIES

Pathophysiology

• The IM are idiopathic but are believed to be immune mediated.
• Each subgroup of myositis has unique pathologic features (described below)
but as a group, they demonstrate inflammation of endomysium, perimysium, and
perivascular areas with infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells, dendritic
cells, and macrophages.

• Furthermore, although it is unclear whether they are pathogenic, myositisspecific autoantibodies define groups of patients with similar clinical features
and prognosis (Table 35-2).

448

TABLE 35-2 MYOSITIS-SPECIFIC AUTOANTIBODIES

Associated Conditions

• IM can precede other signs and symptoms of malignancies up to 2 years.
• Relative risk for cancer is three- to six-fold in DM and about two-fold in PM
and IBM.
Types of cancers seen are similar to normal populations except for an
increased incidence of ovarian cancer.
Asian patients with DM have a several-fold increased risk of nasopharyngeal
carcinoma.

• Workup of myositis has to include age- and risk-appropriate cancer
screenings. When patients with IM do not respond to therapies, more invasive
testing such as endoscopy to look for occult malignancies like gastric or
pancreatic carcinomas should be considered.
DIAGNOSIS

• The diagnosis of IM is based on history, physical examination, and selected
tests. Clinical presentation, muscle biopsy results, and serologies differ
amongst the three subgroups and will be discussed below.

449

• Note that extramuscular manifestations of IM can present at any time.
Polymyositis

• History: Patients develop insidious but progressive, typically painless
symmetric muscle weakness involving the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles.
Usual presentation is about 3 to 6 months after the first onset of symptoms.
Fatigue and anorexia can accompany weakness. Dyspnea is the most common
complaint after weakness. Dysphagia can occur as a result of weakness of
oropharyngeal skeletal muscles.

• Examination: This is notable most for patients having difficulty getting up from
a chair. Reflexes are normal except in muscles with significant atrophy.
Sensation to gross touch, pinprick, and temperatures along with proprioception
remain intact. Dyspnea can be due to muscle weakness (rare) of diaphragmatic
and intercostal muscles which would be evidenced by a decreased peak
inspiratory flow. Fine crackles on lung examination indicate interstitial lung
disease (ILD), which develops in 10% of patients. Some patients develop
cardiac arrhythmias as well.

• Muscle biopsy: Characteristic changes include degeneration and regeneration
of muscle fibers and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the endomysial region with rare
B cells.

• Diagnostic criteria: Table 35-3 demonstrates the original criteria for PM and
DM.3
Multiple diseases must be excluded for these criteria to be applied, including
neuropathies, muscular dystrophies, infections, drugs and toxins,
rhabdomyolysis, metabolic myopathies, and endocrinopathies.
However, these criteria do not account for more recent developments in
serologies and MRI findings. No new criteria have been developed but it is
important to keep in mind that MRIs demonstrating symmetric focal muscle
inflammation and the presence of myositis-specific antibodies can aid in the
diagnosis of IM.
TABLE 35-3 BOHAN AND PETER’S CRITERIA FOR THE DIAGNOSIS
OF POLYMYOSITIS AND DERMATOMYOSITIS

450

Dermatomyositis

• Clinical manifestations of DM can be thought of as PM with cutaneous
manifestations. Rashes often precede muscle weakness. The most common
cutaneous findings are listed.
Gottron’s papules: Lilac papules found on the dorsal aspect of
metacarpophalangeals (MCPs), proximal interphalangeals (PIPs), elbows, or
knees.
Heliotrope rash: Purplish discoloration of the upper eyelids, often
associated with periorbital edema.
Shawl sign: Erythematous rash seen on the upper chest (in the shape of a V)
and back and shoulders which may worsen with UV light exposure.
Mechanic’s hands: Periungual telangiectasias, irregular and thickened
cuticles, and darkened horizontal lines across the lateral and palmar aspects
of fingers and hands.
Subcutaneous calcifications are often seen and their persistent development
generally indicates that DM is not sufficiently controlled.

• Diagnostic criteria: Presented in Table 35-3.3
• Patients with classic cutaneous findings of DM but no clinical evidence of
muscle disease are said to have amyopathic DM.

• Muscle biopsy: Characteristic findings include CD4+ and CD8+ T
lymphocytes along with macrophages and B cells invading predominantly
perimysial and perivascular regions in the setting of perifascicular atrophy.

451

Inclusion Body Myositis

• IBM is the most common myositis found in elderly people.
• History: Onset of weakness is even more insidious and evolves over anywhere
from 1 to 10 years prior to diagnosis. Distribution of weakness is more
asymmetric and can involve distal muscles. Unlike PM and DM, IBM can
cause neuropathic symptoms as well.

• Examination: Decreased grip strength or asymmetric foot drops along with
asymmetric proximal muscle weakness are the most common findings.
Cutaneous manifestations are not seen. IBM is typically not associated with
ILD.

• Muscle biopsy: Characteristic findings include the presence of lined or rimmed
vacuoles and triangulated cells with fiber-type grouping. Note that the presence
of vacuoles on muscle biopsy does not mean that the patient has IBM as similar
vacuoles are seen in muscular dystrophies and drug-induced myopathies.
Differential Diagnosis

• Neuropathies: One of the first steps in diagnosing IM is to evaluate for a
neuropathy being the cause of the weakness. Electromyography (EMG) and
muscle biopsies are the most useful in helping to differentiate between a
neuropathy and a myopathy.

• Muscular dystrophies:
Limb-girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) include a number of disorders
with muscular dystrophy in a pelvic and shoulder girdle distribution.
Unfortunately the age at presentation is highly variable and patients can
present even late in adult life.
Even in mild cases, however, there is a preferential weakness and atrophy of
the biceps muscle.
Creatine kinase (CK) levels can be dramatically elevated and cannot be used
to differentiate between dystrophies and IM.
MRIs are highly useful as active IM shows edema on short tau inversion
recovery (STIR) imaging indicative of inflammation but LGMD shows
extensive fatty replacement.
Muscle biopsies do not demonstrate significant inflammation but
degeneration and regeneration of muscles.
452

Diagnosis is performed by genetic testing, serum protein testing, and if
negative, immunohistochemical testing of muscle biopsy.

• Metabolic myopathies:
These rare diseases of muscle energy metabolism may present with muscle
weakness, elevated CK, and myopathic changes on EMG.
Patients with glycogen metabolism abnormalities or with myoadenylate
deaminase deficiency (the most common metabolic myopathy) have exercise
intolerance and may be asymptomatic at rest.
The forearm ischemic exercise test is a standardized test that involves
checking ammonia and lactate levels before and after vigorous forearm
exercise with a blood pressure cuff inflated above systolic pressure; it is a
useful screening test.
Metabolic myopathies should be suspected in patients who are young, have a
family history of myopathy, or fail to respond to therapy.

• Mitochondrial myopathies:
Mitochondrial disorders can present with isolated proximal muscle weakness
but symptoms tend to be mild or exercise-related.
Checking lactate levels before and after vigorous exercise could be helpful in
the diagnosis.
The classic hallmark of mitochondrial disease is subsarcolemmal and
intermyofibrillar accumulations visualized on Gomori trichrome staining due
to compensatory proliferation of mitochondria, also known as “ragged red
fibers.”
Staining for various enzymes associated with mitochondria to look for
proliferation is also helpful but requires a specialized lab.

• Drug- or toxin-induced myopathies:
Procainamide and penicillamine can cause an immune-mediated myopathy.
Statins and other lipid-lowering agents may cause mitochondrial dysfunction.
Chronic ethanol use is associated with painless proximal muscle weakness
and atrophy with normal CK.
Zidovudine-induced myopathy can have inflammatory infiltrates much like IM
but it is reversible over several months if medication is stopped.

• Endocrine myopathies: Corticosteroid myopathy is common and usually
occurs after months of use; CK level are normal. Hypothyroid myopathy can
453

present like PM with progressive symmetric proximal muscle weakness, but
can be found simply by checking a serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH);
CK may be moderately elevated.
Diagnostic Testing
The tests below can aid in the diagnosis of IM but no one test can confirm the
diagnosis. When patients do not respond to appropriate therapy, the first step should
always be a reevaluation of the diagnosis.
Laboratories

• Evaluation of enzymes that leak from injured skeletal muscle: CK, aldolase,
aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and lactate
dehydrogenase (LDH) are helpful.
Isolated normal enzyme levels do not rule out IM.
CK has to be elevated at some point in the disease.
Unfortunately, an elevated CK does not necessarily indicate active
inflammation and hence, using this to track disease activity is variable
between patients (some do not track at all).
Muscle enzymes should be assessed at the time of diagnosis and correlated
with patient’s symptoms and muscle strength examination to look for a
pattern.
The level of muscle enzyme elevation at diagnosis can also be helpful as
levels less than twice the upper limit of normal or greater than a 100 times
the upper limit of normal should make one think of alternative diagnoses.

• Inflammatory markers like erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive
protein (CRP) can also be used to track disease if elevated at onset of disease.

• Myositis-specific antibodies (Table 35-2) can be checked to aid in diagnosis
as they are specific, but note that sensitivity is only about 50%. They may help
differentiate subsets of myositis, and define prognosis.

• If there is a suspicion of myositis in association with other connective tissue
diseases, based on clinical history and examination, one could send off
myositis-associated autoantibodies (Table 35-1) as well.
Electrocardiography
Cardiac involvement is common, usually manifesting as arrhythmias and can be
454

detected on ECG but results are variable and nonspecific.
Imaging

• MRI is becoming more popular as it can help distinguish active inflammation
(edema) from previously damaged muscles with chronic changes on STIR
images. IM is a patchy disease and can easily be missed on muscle biopsy.
MRI has become very useful in guiding biopsy sites and increasing the
yield of biopsies.4

• Ultrasound and CT are much less sensitive in detection of muscular
inflammation but are cheaper, more convenient, and more readily available in
some areas and have been used to guide biopsy sites as well.

• High resolution CT of the lungs can be used to detect early signs of ILD.5
Diagnostic Procedures

• Electromyography: EMG allows differentiation between neuropathic and
myopathic conditions and should always be done.
EMG is abnormal in greater than 90% of patients with IM but only half of
them show the classic findings of inflammation described in Bohan’s and
Peter’s criteria (Table 35-3).3
Needle insertion can damage muscle fibers for biopsy and hence, EMGs and
muscle biopsies cannot be performed on the same side.

• Muscle biopsy:
Subgroups have different characteristic findings (see above under
PM/DM/IBM) but only a minority of patients will demonstrate all of the
characteristic findings.
Usually, the biopsy report will contain various features of different subgroups
and it is important to remember that a negative biopsy does not rule out
IM.
Also, note that a pathology report is only as good as the lab and the
pathologist. If results are questionable or if a patient is not improving as he
should, it may be prudent to refer the patient and have the pathology
reviewed at a center with more experience.

• Pulmonary function tests: Testing for extramuscular manifestations should be
guided by patient’s symptoms except for lung disease in myositis, as it needs to
be treated aggressively early on to decrease morbidity.5
455

TREATMENT
Medications
Corticosteroids

• High doses of prednisone at 1 to 2 mg/kg PO daily are used as first line
therapy.

• In patients with severe disease and respiratory compromise, IV
methylprednisolone 1 g daily for 3 to 5 days should be used.

• High doses should be maintained for 2 to 3 months with a taper of 10 mg/month
if patient’s CK and strength have normalized.

• Most PM/DM patients respond to steroids whereas IBM patients do not
respond to steroids or other commonly used immunosuppressive agents.
Steroid-Sparing Agents

• The following immunosuppressive agents should only be used in patients who
have responded to corticosteroids but cannot be weaned off without a flare of
disease:
Methotrexate or azathioprine are used alone or even in combination in
PM/DM patients.6,7
Cyclosporine has efficacy in both childhood and adult disease.8
Case reports of patients with myositis and ILD successfully treated with
tacrolimus have been published.9
Mycophenolate mofetil has successfully been used in PM/DM with ILD as
well.10
Intravenous Immune Globulin

• Mechanism of action is unclear but several prospective trials of intravenous
immunoglobulin (IVIG) have shown the efficacy of IVIG in PM/DM/IBM. It is
administered for two consecutive days per month for 3 to 6 months in addition
to other steroid sparing agents like methotrexate and azathioprine.11

• IVIG cannot be continued indefinitely without a steroid-sparing agent.
Currently, recommendations are to use it only as a bridge therapy.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies
456

Physical therapy is essential to preserve muscle function and prevent joint
contractures. In IBM, this is the therapy currently known to be beneficial.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Clinical outcome is variable between patients. Patients who develop myositis
in association with a connective tissue disease tend to have brief illnesses
followed by remission that requires no further treatment.

• PM and DM are generally steroid responsive.
• IBM has not been shown to be responsive to any medications except IVIG.
There are no clear guidelines regarding duration of therapy especially since
this disease is characterized by a very slow but progressive decline.

• Poor prognostic factors include older age, fever and dysphagia at diagnosis,
extramuscular involvement of cardiac and pulmonary systems, delay to
diagnosis and treatment, and positive anti-synthetase or anti-SRP antibodies.

Fibromyalgia Syndrome
Lesley Davila and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) is a chronic pain syndrome of unknown etiology
that is characterized by otherwise unexplained diffuse pain, as well as tender
points, fatigue, and sleep disturbance.

• Whether this is a rheumatologic condition is controversial but it is a condition
seen by rheumatologists because patients present with musculoskeletal pain.
Epidemiology

• Studies in the 1980s estimated a prevalence of 2% to 5%, with a female to
male ratio of 8:1.

• The mean age of patients is 30 to 60 years, but FMS may be present in children
and the elderly.

• Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is seen significantly more frequently in
patients with FMS than in the general population.
Pathophysiology

• The pathophysiology of fibromyalgia is poorly understood.
• FMS is a disorder of heightened pain response, characterized by both
hyperalgesia, defined as increased pain sensitivity, and allodynia, defined as
pain experienced in response to nonpainful stimuli.

• FMS may be a result of neuroendocrine axis alterations with subsequent
disturbances in mood, sleep, and pain perception.

• Abnormalities of the muscle or soft tissue have not been identified in FMS
patients.
459

• Studies show that patients often have low serum serotonin, growth hormone,
and cortisol levels and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) substance P
concentrations. Substance P, regulated by serotonin, can cause exaggerated
perception of normal sensory stimuli.

• Functional MRI studies have demonstrated that the pain centers in the brains of
FMS patients are activated by low level stimuli in a very similar way to how
the pain centers in normals react to more intense stimuli.1

• FMS patients have sleep disturbances, with decreased sleep efficiency,
increased arousals, and increased non-REM sleep resulting in nonrestorative
sleep and daytime sleepiness. It is unknown if pain disturbs sleep, the
disturbed sleep causes pain, or both.2
Associated Conditions

• Comorbid conditions found in patients with FMS include headache, chronic
fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, sleep disturbances, anxiety and/or
depression, and obesity/metabolic syndrome.

• Patients with rheumatologic disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
Sjögren’s syndrome (SS), and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), can have
concomitant FMS.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The cardinal feature of FMS is diffuse soft tissue pain. Often described as
burning, tingling, or gnawing, the pain may be located in the neck, back, chest,
arms, or legs. Usually patients have pain on both sides of the body as well as
above and below the waist.

• In addition, patients may complain of morning stiffness, fatigue, sleep
disturbances, or headaches. The symptoms of pain and fatigue are worsened
by inactivity but also after seemingly minor activity.

• The physical examination is normal except for the presence of tenderness.
Be sure to do a complete joint examination to look for synovitis so you do not
miss a concomitant inflammatory arthritis.

460

Diagnostic Criteria
The American College of Rheumatology recently published preliminary criteria for
the diagnosis and measurement of symptom severity of FMS.3 These criteria are
outlined in Table 36-1.
Differential Diagnosis
Other diagnoses to consider include hypothyroidism, drug-induced myopathies (e.g.,
HMG-CoA inhibitors), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), myofascial pain syndrome,
Lyme disease, sciatica, multiple sclerosis, metabolic myopathy, depression,
temporomandibular joint syndrome, and rheumatologic disorders (e.g., RA, SLE, SS,
ankylosing spondylitis [AS]).
Diagnostic Testing

• The diagnosis of FMS is made clinically.
• Lab tests and radiologic studies often are unrevealing but are helpful in
excluding other diseases.

• Perform a careful sleep history and consider sleep studies in obese patients
and in males with fibromyalgia.

• Screen patients for coexistent depression, which commonly occurs in
patients with chronic pain regardless of the source.
Laboratories

• Initial tests should include a complete blood count (CBC), an erythrocyte
sedimentation rate (ESR), standard chemistries, and thyroid function studies.

• Due to the number of false positives, reserve testing for rheumatoid factor
(RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANAs), and Lyme antibodies for patients in
whom clinical suspicion is high.
TABLE 36-1 THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY 2010
FIBROMYALGIA DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA

461

Imaging
Radiologic studies may be ordered for patients with evidence of arthritis or
radiculopathy.
TREATMENT
Both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies should be included when
tailoring a treatment plan to an individual patient.
Medications

• Pharmacologic therapies with proven effectiveness include antidepressants,
462

antiepileptics, and analgesics.

• Antidepressants, including tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs),
and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) have been
shown to be effective in decreasing symptoms of fibromyalgia.4

• Two SNRI antidepressants, duloxetine and milnacipran, have been approved
by the FDA for FMS. They affect pain and sleep disturbance in FMS, but this
is thought to be independent of their effect on mood.5,6
Duloxetine is usually started at 30 mg daily and increased to 60 or 120 mg
daily.
Milnacipran is titrated slowly to 50 mg twice daily (maximum 200 mg daily).

• The TCA amitriptyline has been shown to reduce pain, sleep disturbance, and
fatigue in FMS patients.

• The MAOIs and SSRIs have been shown to diminish pain in FMS patients.
• Antiepileptic medications such as pregabalin and gabapentin have been
studied in fibromyalgia and pregabalin has been approved by the FDA for
treatment of FMS after being shown to significantly reduce pain and fatigue and
to improve sleep and health related quality of life.7–9
Pregabalin is initiated at 150 mg daily and titrated to 300 to 450 mg/day in
divided doses.
Gabapentin is dosed at 300 to 1800 mg daily in divided doses.

• Medications that target sleep patterns by promoting stage 4 sleep and
providing analgesic effects include the following:
Amitriptyline is usually dosed 10 to 50 mg PO once at bedtime.

• The “muscle relaxant” cyclobenzaprine has been studied several times and a
meta-analysis suggests that it is beneficial in FMS (global assessment, sleep,
and pain). It is usually dosed 10 to 40 mg daily in divided doses.10 The actual
mechanism of action is unclear but its structure is related to TCAs and
cyproheptadine.

• Analgesics that are helpful include the following:
Tramadol in doses of 50 to 400 mg daily.
Acetaminophen.
Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used, but given
the absence of tissue inflammation, they may not be better than placebo in
463

treating patients with FMS.
Topical agents (e.g., capsaicin cream and topical lidocaine) may be used as
adjunctive therapies.
Opioids generally are not recommended because FMS patients have been
found to have diminished response to them, perhaps because they have
decreased availability of central opioid receptors.11
Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• There is strong evidence to support the use of exercise and cognitive
behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) in the treatment of FMS.12
Physical activity helps maintain function in patients. Aerobic activity should
be performed for at least 20 minutes daily, 2 to 3 times a week at a moderate
intensity. It can be split into two 10-minute periods. Strength training should
be performed 2 to 3 times per week with 8 to 12 repetitions per exercise.
Behavioral therapy, CBT, and biofeedback combined with relaxation and
movement therapy have been proven effective.
Acupuncture and balneotherapy can also be of benefit.

• Patient education is an important component of therapy for FMS. Support
groups are also available for these patients.

• Establishing a close patient–physician relationship with frequent visits often
helps patients cope with their disease.

Sjögren’s Syndrome
Maria C. Gonzalez-Mayda and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Sjögren’s syndrome (SS) is one of the more prevalent autoimmune diseases and
its most common features are dry eyes and dry mouth.

• Treatment should be aimed at symptomatic relief by keeping mucous
membranes moist.
Definition

• SS is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by lymphocytic
infiltration and autoimmune destruction of exocrine glands.

• The salivary and lacrimal glands are commonly affected, leading to symptoms
of dry mouth (xerostomia) and dry eyes (keratoconjunctivitis sicca). There may
also be nasal and vaginal dryness.
Epidemiology

• Of the autoimmune conditions, SS is one of the more prevalent, affecting
approximately 0.5 to 3 million persons in the United States. The incidence of
SS in the general population is estimated to range between 1/1000 and 1/100
new cases per year, depending on the diagnostic criteria used.

• SS most often occurs in women (female to male ratio, 9:1) in their fourth and
fifth decades of life.
Pathophysiology

• The primary pathologic mechanism of SS consists of focal infiltration of
lymphocytes into glandular tissue.

• SS most commonly affects salivary and lacrimal glands but may occur in any
466

exocrine glandular tissue.

• Antibodies against nuclear antigens SSA/Ro and SSB/La are commonly
associated with SS, but it is not known if they are pathogenic.

• Although the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms of SS are not completely
understood, several different hypotheses have been formulated.
A combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors are thought to
play a role in the initiation and progression of SS.1
Certain HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles are associated with SS.
Viral infections, including Epstein–Barr virus, retroviruses, and hepatitis C,
might predispose patients to SS by indirectly altering immune response to
favor autoimmune glandular destruction.
Glandular epithelial cells become activated and assist in the attraction of B
cells, T cells, and dendritic cells to the exocrine glands and promote the
release of inflammatory cytokines.1
The inflammation becomes chronic because of immune dysregulation,
resulting in cell-mediated glandular destruction leading to decreased
exocrine secretions.

• The end effect of ocular discomfort in SS is mediated by inadequate tearing,
causing increased friction between mucosal surfaces. This results in distortion
of epithelial cells during the blinking process, leading to corneal irritation
and abrasions. A localized inflammatory response is precipitated. In addition,
the loss of the nutritive effects of tears delays healing.

• Similar pathologic processes affect the oral cavity. Inflammatory destruction of
salivary glands leads to quantitative and qualitative changes in saliva
production. The normal bacterial flora is altered by changes in salivation,
leading to an increased frequency of dental caries, oral candidiasis, and
periodontal diseases.
Associated Conditions

• SS may occur as a primary disease.
• However, it commonly occurs in patients with other systemic autoimmune
diseases (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis [RA], systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE],
scleroderma [SSc], mixed connective tissue disease [MCTD], inflammatory
myopathies, and autoimmune liver and thyroid diseases).
467

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• Symptoms of SS develop insidiously, commonly over several years.
• Mucosal dehydration, manifested as dry eyes and dry mouth, is the most
common complaint associated with SS.

• Symptoms of dry eyes include a foreign body sensation, itching, light sensitivity
worse in the evening, and thick, crusting film present on awakening. Symptoms
are commonly aggravated by airline travel, dry windy conditions, and use of
contact lenses.

• Dry mouth often manifests as increased thirst and difficulty swallowing dry
foods. Rapidly progressive dental caries, recurrent oral and gingival
infections, and discomfort wearing dentures may all be associated with SS.

• Additional features of exocrine gland dysfunction include symptoms of dry
skin (xerosis), vaginal dryness, upper airway dryness creating a dry cough, and
recurrent upper respiratory infections.

• Extraglandular involvement of SS may also occur.
Fatigue and arthralgias (sometimes arthritis) are common complaints with
SS.
Skin lesions include palpable purpura, urticaria, annular lesions, xerosis, and
Raynaud’s phenomenon.
Respiratory involvement includes increased frequency of sinusitis,
bronchitis, pneumonia, and pleural effusions. More severe complications
include development of interstitial pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis.
Cardiac involvement may include pericardial effusions or autonomic
dysfunction.
Neurologic complications may include cognitive dysfunction, demyelinating
disease similar to multiple sclerosis, myasthenia gravis, and peripheral
neuropathies.
Renal involvement may manifest as renal tubular acidosis, renal
insufficiency, or chronic interstitial nephritis.
Gastrointestinal manifestations include dysphagia, esophageal dysmotility,
468

nausea, dyspepsia, atrophic gastritis, and hepatic abnormalities.
Physical Examination

• Salivary gland enlargement occurs in up to half of the affected patients.
• The glands are usually diffusely firm and nontender. Painful episodic swelling
is common and may be either unilateral or bilateral.

• A hard, nodular gland may suggest a neoplasm. This distinction is clinically
significant, as there is an increased incidence of B-cell lymphomas in
salivary glands affected with SS.
Diagnostic Criteria
Table 37-1 presents the revised international classification criteria for SS proposed
by the American-European Consensus Group.2
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of SS includes any disease process that leads to symptoms
of dry eyes and dry mouth, including the following:

• Infiltrative diseases (e.g., sarcoidosis, amyloidosis, hemochromatosis, and
lymphoma).

• Infectious diseases (e.g., viral infections [HIV, hepatitis B and C, mumps,
influenza, coxsackie A, cytomegalovirus], syphilis, trachoma, tuberculosis, and
bacterial infection).

• Fat deposition from diabetes, alcoholism, pancreatitis, cirrhosis, and
hypertriglyceridemia.

• Anticholinergic side effects from medicines (e.g., antidepressants,
neuroleptics, antihypertensives, antihistamines, and decongestants).

• Endocrine dysfunction including acromegaly and gonadal hypofunction.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
A general diagnostic workup for SS should include the following laboratory tests:

• Complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C469

reactive protein (CRP), rheumatoid factor (RF), antinuclear antibodies (ANA),
and serum protein electrophoresis.

• ANA is positive in about 80% and RF is positive in up to 30% of SS patients.
• If the ANA is positive, obtain autoantibodies SSA/Ro and SSB/La. SSA/Ro is
positive in about 75% and SSB/La in about 40% of patients.

• Most patients have mild anemia and increased ESR or CRP, and polyclonal
hypergammaglobulinemia is also common.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Functional studies may include Schirmer’s test for tear secretion.
• Rose bengal or fluorescein staining with slit-lamp examination is used to
detect damaged corneal epithelium.

• Sialometry, sialography, or scintigraphy can be performed to measure
salivary gland function.
TABLE 37-1 REVISED INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA
FOR SJÖGREN’S SYNDROMEA

470

• Confirmation of SS can be obtained by performing a minor salivary gland
biopsy, most often obtained from minor salivary glands in the lower lip.
Pathologic findings of focal lymphocyte aggregates, plasma cells, and
macrophages support the diagnosis.
TREATMENT

• Most patients with SS can be managed with education and simple symptomatic
relief measures designed to keep mucous membranes moist.
471

• For dry eyes, patients should use artificial tears on a regular basis. Numerous
brands are available, and patients are encouraged to try various formulas to
find the most suitable one. In general, preservative-free solutions are better
tolerated.
Some patients may benefit from punctual occlusion to prolong the efficacy of
artificial tears.
Topical 0.05% cyclosporine twice daily for patients with moderate to severe
dry eye disease has been shown to give the best results in terms of
symptomatic relief.3,4
In cases where ocular symptoms are severe and refractory, refer to an
ophthalmologist for initiation of topical steroids or nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) under their monitoring.

• For dry mouth, patients are encouraged to drink water frequently.
Stimulation of salivary glands with sugar-free gum or candy may also be
useful.
Patients should avoid dry foods as well as alcohol and smoking.
Artificial saliva products are available.
Some patients may benefit from treatment with the muscarinic agonists
pilocarpine, 5 mg PO qid, or cevimeline, 30 mg PO tid; however, many
patients experience side effects of increased urination and defecation,
sweating, abdominal cramping, and flushing. 3,5
Patients with xerostomia are at increased risk of dental caries and should be
followed closely by a dentist. Topical fluoride treatments may help prevent
tooth decay. Meticulous daily dental hygiene is of utmost importance.

• Dry skin can be managed with moisturizing lotions.
• Vaginal dryness is improved with lubricants.
• Arthralgias and other musculoskeletal complaints are often remedied with
NSAIDs.

• Hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine, methotrexate, leflunomide, and tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists have all failed to show conclusive efficacy
in SS.3

• In those patients with severe progressive disease manifestations of vasculitis,
nephritis, interstitial lung involvement, or neuropathy a combination of steroids
and IV cyclophosphamide can be considered. Rituximab may also be
472

considered in life-threatening circumstances.3,6
COMPLICATIONS

• SS has been associated with the development of lymphoma with a lifetime risk
between 5% and 10%. This is thought to arise because of unregulated B- and
T-cell stimulation.

• Factors associated with an increased risk of lymphoma include
lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, low CD4 count, parotid gland enlargement,
cryoglobulinemia, low complement levels, and purpura/vasculitis.7–9
REFERRAL
Patients with sicca symptoms should be followed closely by a rheumatologist and
should be referred to both a dentist and an ophthalmologist given their increased
risk of developing caries and corneal abrasions, respectively.
PATIENT EDUCATION

• Patients with SS should be advised to keep mucous membranes moist for
symptomatic relief.

• Encourage patients to avoid dry environments, wind, cigarette smoke, and
medications with anticholinergic side effects.

• Humidifiers can counter low-humidity indoor environments, especially in
winter months when centralized heating leads to dry air.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
In patients with primary SS without transformation to lymphoma there does not
appear to be an increase in all-cause mortality when compared with the general
population; those with lymphoma have a higher mortality rate.

Scleroderma
Hyon Ju Park and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease characterized by skin thickening and
tightening. It is divided into two main forms: localized and systemic.

• Localized scleroderma only involves the skin with, at most, some atrophy of
the subcutaneous tissue underlying the lesions.
Localized scleroderma includes morphea (patches of thickened skin), linear
scleroderma (a line of thickened skin on one or more extremities), and
scleroderma en coup de sabre (linear disease affecting only one side of the
face and scalp).
Patients with localized scleroderma are generally managed by dermatologists
as they have no internal organ involvement.
They may have low titer antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests.

• The rest of this chapter will focus on systemic scleroderma, also known as
systemic sclerosis (SSc).
Definition
SSc is a complex multiorgan disease thought to be the result of autoimmunity,
inflammation, vasculopathy, and progressive fibrosis of the skin and visceral organs.
Classification

• SSc is divided further into limited cutaneous disease (lcSSc, formerly known
as CREST syndrome: calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon [RP], esophageal
dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias), diffuse cutaneous disease
(dcSSc), and scleroderma sine scleroderma on the basis of the extent of skin
involvement.

• Skin involvement in lcSSc is limited to the face, the upper extremities distal to
475

the elbows and the lower extremities distal to the knees; while dcSSc involves
skin proximal to the elbows and knees. This distinction is important in its
prognostic implications. The rare case with visceral organ involvement but no
skin changes is known as scleroderma sine scleroderma.
Epidemiology

• Estimated annual incidence of SSc in the United States is 1.9/100,000.
Prevalence rate is estimated at 28/100,000.1

• SSc is about three to five times more common in women than men, with decline
of predominance after menopause. The most common age of onset is between
30 and 50 years.

• Having a first degree relative with disease confers a relative risk of about 13
but rates between monozygotic and dizygotic twins are similar.

• Blacks have a higher incidence and have earlier disease onset than whites.
Blacks are more likely to have diffuse cutaneous involvement with aggressive
interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary hypertension.
Etiology

• Etiology is unknown and there are no animal models that simulate all the
features of SSc.

• A two-hit process has been hypothesized, where this inflammatory and
vasculopathic disease is triggered by an environmental or infectious agent in
people who have a loss of function mutation in the antifibrotic pathways.
Pathophysiology

• There are four distinct but interrelated pathogenic processes of autoimmunity,
inflammation, vasculopathy, and fibrosis.

• It is thought that autoimmunity with vascular reactivity precedes development
of SSc, as patients usually have autoantibodies and RP prior to the
development of other organ involvement. Autoantibodies against components
of the extracellular matrix found in 50% of SSc patients can activate
fibroblasts, induce collagen production, and prevent collagen degradation,
resulting in tissue fibrosis.2
476

• Endothelial injury appears to occur early in the course of SSc, but the trigger
for the damage has not been identified. Injury results in endothelial cells
becoming activated, producing adhesion molecules and inflammatory
cytokines, which can lead to endothelial damage, resulting in tissue hypoxemia.

• Hypoxemia stimulates production of angiogenesis factors like vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF), tumor (or transforming) growth factor
(TGF) β and endothelin-1 (ET-1), which results in vasoconstriction without
angiogenesis in SSc patients.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History

• RP is almost universally present in SSc. It is usually the first manifestation
of SSc and may precede the development of other features by months to years.
Patients report episodic, bilateral color changes precipitated by the cold or by
emotional stress. Digits, nose, and ears turn white when vasospasm occurs as a
result of sympathetic hyperactivation. As oxygen supply is depleted, they turn
blue and, upon rewarming, they become red as reperfusion occurs.

• Skin changes occur in three phases: edematous, fibrotic, and atrophic. Often
the first complaint specific for scleroderma is swelling or “puffiness” of the
fingers or hands corresponding to the edematous phase. Patients may also
complain of pruritus, dry skin, tightening and decreased flexibility, and skin
ulcerations.

• The extent of skin involvement often correlates with overall clinical course.
lcSSc typically begins with RP followed by thickening of skin of the fingers,
progressing to hands and forearms with possible later features of pulmonary
fibrosis and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).
dcSSc has a more rapid course, with skin changes occurring shortly after the
development of RP, progressing over the first 1 to 5 years, and then
stabilizing thereafter. Unfortunately, internal organ involvement in dcSSc
often occurs in the first 2 years and does not parallel the skin findings.

• Other complaints depend on visceral organ involvement. Gastrointestinal
(GI) complaints are common, with involvement anywhere along the
alimentary tract. Gastroesophageal reflux is the most common complaint.
477

Patients may also note dry mouth, dysphagia, dyspepsia, nausea, early satiety,
cramping abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Intestinal pseudoobstruction may occur secondary to hypomotility.

• With pulmonary involvement, patients may complain of dyspnea on exertion
or nonproductive cough.

• Chest pain may occur due to esophagitis, pleurisy, pericarditis, costochondritis,
coronary vasospasms, and fibrosis of the chest wall.

• Musculoskeletal complaints are nonspecific. Patients often experience
generalized arthralgias with stiffness of the joints under the fibrotic skin.
Physical Examination

• Affected skin is thickened and leathery or hide-bound; sclerodactyly refers to
such skin changes affecting the fingers. Fingertips can appear tapered from
ischemic loss of the digital pulp.

• Since RP is a transient phenomenon, it usually is not seen on examination, but
fingertip ulcerations resulting from chronic hypoxia can be seen. Examination
of a patient’s nailfold capillary bed can be beneficial for early diagnosis.
Using a hand-held ophthalmoscope with power <20 diopters, nailfold
capillaries are visualized through a water-soluble gel.
In cases of secondary RP (associated with scleroderma or inflammatory
myopathies), the examination reveals enlarged capillary loops, loss of
normal capillary beds, and occasional capillary hemorrhages.

• A tight “purse-lip” appearance associated with decreased oral aperture is
attributed to increased fibrotic activity within the perioral skin.

• Telangiectasias may be appreciated over the face, oropharyngeal mucosa and
hands.

• Hyper- and hypopigmentary changes may lead to a “salt-and-pepper”
appearance of the skin.

• Subcutaneous calcinosis can also be seen.
• Other findings depend on organ involvement.
Crackles can be heard in patients with pulmonary fibrosis.
Signs of right heart failure can be seen in the setting of PAH.
Arrhythmias from conduction system fibrosis, pericardial rubs from
478

pericarditis, or signs of congestive heart failure from myocardial fibrosis can
be seen with cardiac involvement.
When inflammation and fibrosis of tendon sheaths is significant, coarse
friction rubs can be heard with joint movement.
Hypertension with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia is seen in
scleroderma renal crisis, a few patients with scleroderma renal crisis are
normotensive.
Diagnostic Criteria

• The American College of Rheumatology classification criteria for SSc are
presented in Table 38-1.
TABLE 38-1 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF RHEUMATOLOGY
CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR SYSTEMIC SCLEROSIS

• Although this diagnostic strategy is purported to have a sensitivity of 97% and
specificity of 98%, individuals with CREST features would not necessarily
fulfill these criteria, but they are considered to have lcSSc.3
Differential Diagnosis

• Skin thickening as that in scleroderma but with some distinguishing features can
be seen in other disorders. Keep in mind that patients with these other
479

diseases do not have RP or digital ulcerations.

• Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), affecting mostly dialysis patients, tends
to affect lower extremities more than upper extremities and generally spares
the hands.

• Three syndromes with paraproteinemia have scleroderma-like skin changes:
Scleredema, complication of long-standing diabetes or paraproteinemia,
causes thickening of the skin in the neck, shoulder girdle, proximal upper
extremities, and back, and is characterized by mucin deposition on skin
biopsy.
Scleromyxedema, which can involve the hands, but involved skin tends to be
more folded and pendulous rather than tight and thickened.
POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy,
monoclonal gammopathy, and scleroderma-like skin changes).

• Eosinophilic fasciitis can have a rapid onset of skin thickening with early
development of flexion contractures due to fascial thickening. Skin tends to be
more puckered appearing, but a deep biopsy will demonstrate eosinophilic
infiltration, separating it from SSc. Eosinophilia is common, and eosinophilic
infiltrates are usually seen on biopsy.

• Other conditions with scleroderma-like skin thickening include diabetic digital
sclerosis, chronic graft-versus-host disease, vinyl chloride exposure, vibratory
injury, bleomycin toxicity, complex regional pain syndrome/reflex sympathetic
dystrophy, amyloidosis, porphyria cutanea tarda, and carcinoid syndrome.

• Diseases with similar organ involvement include primary pulmonary
hypertension, ILD, primary biliary cirrhosis, intestinal hypomotility, and
collagenous colitis.

• Diseases that may present in a similar fashion to scleroderma include systemic
lupus erythematosus (SLE), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD),
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and inflammatory myopathies.
Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is on the basis of clinical findings described above. The following can be
helpful in making the diagnosis or in delineating the extent of organ involvement.
Laboratories

480

• 95% of patients with scleroderma will have a positive ANA, with the
anticentromere staining pattern of the ANA being specific (but not sensitive)
for limited scleroderma. Anti–Scl-70 (anti–topoisomerase-I) antibodies are
specific (but not sensitive) for diffuse scleroderma, and are associated with
risk for ILD.

• Less commonly assayed antibodies associated with scleroderma include antiRNA polymerase I, II, and III and U3-ribonucleoprotein (RNP). RNP is
associated with risk for pulmonary hypertension. Anti–U1-RNP antibodies are
found in MCTD, and anti–PM-Scl antibodies may be present in overlap
syndromes.
Electrocardiography
ECG findings are highly variable, depending on which area of the heart is involved
and the extent of involvement.
Imaging

• Transthoracic echocardiography can be used to evaluate for pulmonary
hypertension or pericardial effusion.

• Patients with ILD will have interstitial infiltrates on high-resolution CT and a
restrictive pattern on pulmonary function testing.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Reflux, dysphagia, and odynophagia are frequent complaints related to
esophageal dysmotility, which can be evaluated with barium esophagram or
esophageal manometry.

• Patients with elevated pulmonary pressures on echocardiography or those with
dyspnea unexplained by other causes should undergo a right heart
catheterization, as echocardiography can under- or over-estimate pulmonary
pressures in about 10% of patients.4
TREATMENT
SSc has the highest mortality rate among the connective tissue disorders. There
is no treatment for the underlying disease process and, hence, treatment is targeted at
specific organ complications and/or patient symptoms.

481

Medications

• Skin involvement: No effective antifibrotic therapy has been discovered to
date.
Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant for severe dSSc has shown
promise in reversing cutaneous disease, improving quality of life, and
maintaining internal organ function. Randomized trials are in progress.5

• RP: Nonpharmacologic measures for treating RP include smoking cessation
and avoiding cold exposure.
Diltiazem and dihydropyridine calcium-channel blockers (CCBs) like
amlodipine, nifedipine, and felodipine have been shown to be effective in
RP.6
Other medications that have been shown to have some efficacy in RP include
the angiotensin II inhibitors, a-antagonists, selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors, nitrates, phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as sildenafil, and, in
severe disease, prostacyclins.6 All of these agents are more effective in
primary RP than in RP associated with scleroderma.

• Digital ulcers: Ulcers are extremely painful and, because they result from
ischemia, are difficult to heal. Analgesics and local wound care can be helpful.
Case series have demonstrated the benefit of sildenafil and tadalafil in
facilitating healing and preventing new ulcer formation.7
Bosentan has been shown to reduce the development of new ulcers but
without any effect on existing ulcers. Iloprost has been shown to help heal
ulcers and prevent new ones, but only epoprostenol is available in the United
States and it must be administered via a central line with close monitoring.6
Sympathectomies, sympathetic blocks, and intra-arterial injections of
vasodilators have been reported to help but responses have been
inconsistent.

• Scleroderma renal crisis used to be the number one cause of death in SSc
patients but that has changed with the advent of angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.8
Early institution of ACE inhibitors now makes this a rare cause of death.
An ACE inhibitor should be started even in the setting of an elevated
creatinine, and a renal specialist consulted.
Patients with early, active, inflammatory diffuse scleroderma are at highest
risk and should be educated about warning signs and encouraged to monitor
482

their pressure weekly.

• Cyclophosphamide has been used for SSc ILD for many years but randomized,
controlled trials have demonstrated only modest benefit in forced vital
capacity, fibrosis, and dyspnea.9
Small open case series demonstrating benefit of mycophenolate mofetil
(MMF) have been published but MMF has not been rigorously studied.
A small randomized controlled study demonstrated improvement in skin and
ILD with rituximab therapy.10

•

The prostaglandins epoprostenol, treprostinil, and iloprost; endothelin
receptor antagonist bosentan; and the phosphodiesterase inhibitors sildenafil
and tadalafil have shown benefit in the treatment of PAH.6

• GI: Reflux symptoms can be controlled with proton pump inhibitors, but it may
be necessary to use up to three times the usual dose.6
Esophageal strictures are treated with dilatation when necessary.
Gastric antral venous ectasia is the most common cause of GI bleeding in
scleroderma and can be treated with endoscopic laser photocoagulation.
Prokinetic agents like metoclopramide can be for aperistaltic symptoms.
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction can be managed with octreotide.6
Patients who develop symptoms of small bowel bacterial overgrowth can
be managed with alternating doses of ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.6
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Avoiding excess bathing and using proper moisturizing creams can aid in skin
care.

• Aggressive occupational and physical therapy may be helpful early in the
course of disease to minimize contractures.
Surgical Management
Post-operative healing can be difficult in SSc patients. However, digital ulcers can
become infected and may need debridement. Amputations may be necessary for
deeper infections.
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
483

Patients with scleroderma are at increased risk for depression and despair. Support
groups may be beneficial. Fear of losing functionality and of increasing pain is a
common emotion but is amenable to intervention by early recognition, patient
education, and encouragement.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• The diagnoses of dcSSc and lcSSc have different prognostic implications.
• dcSSc has widely variable but overall poor prognosis with survival of 40% to
60% at 10 years from the onset of the first non-RP scleroderma sign or
symptom.

• lcSSc has a relatively good prognosis with survival greater than 70% at 10
years.

• Prognosis of scleroderma sine scleroderma is generally poor but difficult to
estimate because it is so rare.

• Most patients with SSc die from pulmonary disease or from infectious
complications.

Antiphospholipid Syndrome
Lesley Davila and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a hypercoagulable disorder manifested by
recurrent arterial and venous thromboses and adverse outcomes in pregnancy that is
associated with antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies.
Classification

• APS may be primary (with no concomitant disorder) or secondary when
associated with another systemic disease (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus
[SLE]).

• Catastrophic APS is a variant of APS characterized by acute thrombotic
microangiopathy that results in multiorgan failure and a high mortality rate.
Epidemiology

• The syndrome most commonly occurs in young females; however, both sexes
and all ages may be affected.

• While aPL occurs in 1% to 6% of the general population, the prevalence of
primary APS is thought to be less than 0.5%.

• In patients with SLE, 10% to 44% will develop aPL and of those, about half
will eventually develop secondary APS. Among patients with APS, 37% have
SLE.1 Catastrophic APS occurs in less than 1% of patients with APS.
Pathophysiology

• The pathophysiology of APS is poorly understood, although aPL is implicated
in the disorder.
486

• aPL affects coagulation and thrombosis in different ways.2–4
These antibodies may bind to platelets, upregulating production of
thromboxane A2 and expression of glycoprotein 2b-3a; to endothelial cells
and monocytes which increases production of tissue factors; or to endothelial
cells resulting in an increase in adhesion molecules. These interactions favor
thrombosis.
The binding of aPL also activates complement, which can initiate an
inflammatory cascade resulting in thrombosis. Complement activation has
also been linked to fetal loss in APS.
Some authors propose that coagulation may result from disruption of proteins
that regulate thrombosis, such as protein C, by aPL. Also, antibodies against
β-2-glycoprotein I (β-2gpI), a naturally occurring anticoagulant, may induce
a prothrombotic state.
Cardiovascular risk factors such as smoking and estrogen use can help
promote thrombosis in APS.

• The importance of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of disease has been
supported by animal studies that have shown that passive transfer of
anticardiolipin (aCL) antibodies may induce thrombocytopenia and fetal
resorption.
Associated Conditions

• Secondary APS has been associated with various rheumatologic conditions,
most commonly SLE, but also Sjögren’s syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,
scleroderma, and systemic vasculitis.

• aPL in the absence of APS has also been found in patients with infections,
neoplasms, medication exposure and other diseases. These aPL are usually
IgM antibodies at low titers and are usually transient and rarely associated
with thrombosis.1
DIAGNOSIS

• APS should be suspected in patients presenting with venous or arterial
thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, stroke,
myocardial infarction, or other presentation) or pregnancy losses
(miscarriage, preeclampsia, or placental insufficiency).
487

• Consider APS when a patient has unexplained or recurrent thromboses or
thrombotic events at unusual sites (e.g., adrenal veins), when thrombosis
occurs in young patients, and when recurrent pregnancy losses occur in the
second and third trimesters.
Clinical Presentation

• Clinical presentation of APS varies on the basis of the affected blood vessel.
Patients typically present in one of four ways:
Venous thrombosis
Arterial thrombosis
Pregnancy loss
Thrombocytopenia

• Other manifestations can include livedo reticularis, Raynaud’s phenomenon,
dementia, premature atherosclerotic lesions, renal insufficiency, and
pulmonary hypertension (Table 39-1).

• Catastrophic APS presents with multiorgan failure as a result of multiplevessel occlusion occurring over a short time period. This carries a mortality
rate of 50% even with treatment.

• Dermatologic symptoms such as livedo reticularis

and Raynaud’s
phenomenon occur in 10% to 30% of patients and may provide a clue to
diagnosis.

Diagnostic Criteria

• The updated International Consensus Statement on classification criteria for
definite APS states that the diagnosis of APS should be considered when at
least one clinical criterion and one lab criterion are met (Table 39-2).5

• The clinical criteria include vascular thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity, and
the laboratory criteria include the presence of aCL antibody, anti–β-2gpI
antibody, and the lupus anticoagulant (LAC).
Differential Diagnosis

• Diagnoses of other prothrombotic conditions must be entertained: Protein C
488

or S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, factor V Leiden mutation,
dysfibrinogenemias, hyperhomocysteinuria, Behçet’s syndrome, malignancies,
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, nephrotic syndrome, severe diabetes,
paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, pregnancy, smoking, estrogen therapy,
and prolonged bed rest.
TABLE 39-1 CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS OF ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID
SYNDROME

• Although often associated with thromboses, aPLs sometimes can be found in a
healthy person or in those with lymphoproliferative disorders, viral infections
(e.g., HIV), or malignancies. These individuals may not necessarily have APS.
The prevalence of aCL antibodies in healthy populations is 1% to 6%.
Diagnostic Testing

• Three types of assays are available to detect aPL:
The LAC is a misnomer; it was characterized by in vitro prolongation of
clotting, but it confers a hypercoagulable state in vivo. It is not a specific
analyte but a lab phenomenon, which may be found in conditions other than
SLE (see Chapter 5, Laboratory Evaluation of Rheumatic Diseases). Assays
for the LAC include the dilute Russell viper venom time, activated partial
thromboplastin time (aPTT), kaolin clotting time, and tissue
489

thromboplastin inhibition; none has a >70% sensitivity to detect all LAC
antibodies. Mixing normal platelet-poor plasma with the patient’s plasma
will not correct an LAC-associated prolonged aPTT, as it would in a patient
with a factor deficiency, but addition of excess phospholipids will.
The aCL and anti–β-2gpI antibodies are measured by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reported by isotypes (IgG, IgA, IgM) and
titers. IgG and IgM antibodies are clinically significant at high titer (>99th
percentile) and have high specificity for the diagnosis of APS.
TABLE 39-2 REVISED CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS
OF ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME

• The diagnostic criteria require the presence of the LAC or medium- to hightiter aCL antibodies or high-titer anti–β-2gpI antibodies to be present on at
490

least two occasions, at least 12 weeks apart. False positive syphilis serology
also represents aPL antibody, but is not included in the criteria.

• Other lab tests to consider in the evaluation of the patient include complete
blood count (CBC) and blood chemistries, to evaluate for renal and liver
dysfunction. Radiologic studies (CT/MRI) are helpful to assess damage and
guide management.
TREATMENT
Prevention of thrombosis is a major goal of therapy in patients with aPL antibodies.
Therapy is divided into two clinical settings: Primary prophylaxis (aPL carriers
without previous thrombosis) and secondary prophylaxis (patients with APS who
have already had a thrombotic event).
Medications
Primary Prophylaxis

• Primary prophylaxis can be considered in purely asymptomatic individuals
(who had testing done for unclear reasons), patients with SLE, or women with
obstetric APS.

• Healthy patients with high aPL titers but no manifestation of thromboses are
advised to take aspirin (325 mg PO daily) as prophylaxis. While it is not
currently known if this benefits patients with aPL but no underlying
autoimmune disease, studies have shown a protective effect in patients with
SLE and aPL.6,7

• On the basis of data from animal models and indirect evidence from human
studies, hydroxychloroquine 400 mg PO daily, has been found to be protective
against future thrombosis by decreasing the titers of aPL; more studies are
needed to determine whether this should be recommended for healthy patients
with aPL.8
Secondary Prophylaxis

• For patients with documented thrombotic events, long-term intensive
anticoagulation is recommended on the basis of the type of thrombotic event.

• Venous event: Unfractionated IV heparin followed by warfarin, with a goal
international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.5 (range 2.0–3.0) is the treatment of
491

choice for patients presenting with a first venous event.1,2,9
The optimal duration of anticoagulation for prevention of recurrent
thrombosis is unknown, but the risk of recurrence appears to be highest in the
6-month period after discontinuing anticoagulant drugs. To date, the general
consensus is to treat indefinitely with anticoagulation.2,9
Recurrent venous thrombosis has been reported from 3% to 24% per year.
If recurrent thrombosis occurs despite adequate anticoagulation, high
intensity anticoagulation is recommended (INR range 3.0–4.0), or warfarin
(INR 2.0–3.0) plus aspirin, or, if unstable INR, switching to low–molecular
weight heparin is recommended.

• Arterial event: Arterial events most commonly involve the cerebral
circulation (i.e., transient ischemic attack, stroke) and less commonly
myocardial infarction or other arterial thrombosis. Evidence for treatment of
these groups is controversial and lacks prospective randomized control trials.
Current therapy includes aspirin only (325 mg/day) or warfarin therapy at
moderate (goal INR 2.0–3.0) or high (goal INR 3.0–4.0) dose.2,9–11

• Pregnancy morbidity prevention: The optimal treatment of pregnant women
with aPL and recurrent fetal loss without thrombosis is controversial. Current
recommendations suggest that combination aspirin and heparin therapy
increases the chance of a successful pregnancy in women with aPL and
recurrent fetal loss.10
Aspirin (81 mg/day) should be started when attempting conception and
heparin should be started when intrauterine pregnancy is confirmed. Both
should be discontinued late in the third trimester.
Heparin can be dosed as either unfractionated (5000–10,000 units q12h) or
low molecular weight as enoxaparin 1 mg/kg or 40–80 mg, dalteparin 5000
units, or nadroparin 3800 units all administered once daily during pregnancy.
Historically, pregnant patients were treated with prednisone, but due to
significant side effects of hyperglycemia, preeclampsia, diabetes, and
infection, as well as lack of compelling benefit, this is no longer
recommended.

• Catastrophic APS is a distinct clinical entity manifesting as multisystem organ
failure with clinical evidence of vessel occlusion developing simultaneously
or in <1week. Histopathology confirms small-vessel occlusion in at least one
organ or tissue. Laboratory tests show presence of aPL. The mortality rate is
high (30%–50%) and recent guidelines recommend combination therapy with
492

the following:12
Treatment of precipitating factors (e.g., infection, underlying SLE flare, etc).
Effective anticoagulation with IV heparin for 7 to 10 days or longer,
depending on patient response.
High-dose steroids (methylprednisolone 1000 mg IV daily) for 3 or more
days.
IV immune globulin (0.4 gm/kg body weight daily for 4–5 days) and/or
plasma exchange (removal of 2–3 liters of plasma for at least 3–5 days) are
used, with the goal of removing aPL and replenishing natural clotting factors
through fresh frozen plasma (FFP) replacement with exchange. Of note,
thrombosis with intravenous immunoglobulin use has been reported, so it
needs to be cautiously given, especially when delivered rapidly or when
anticoagulation needs to be interrupted.
If ineffective, alternative therapies for catastrophic APS with reported
success include cyclophosphamide (in patients with SLE, not patients with
primary APS) and rituximab (in patients with thrombocytopenia or
autoimmune hemolytic anemia).12
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

• Lifestyle modifications are recommended in both patients with APS and
patients with asymptomatic aPL. This includes smoking cessation, avoidance
of supplemental estrogens, and controlling hypertension and diabetes.

• The greatest morbidity and mortality are seen in women with a history of
arterial thrombotic events who become pregnant, so such patients should be
advised not to become pregnant.

Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
Reeti Joshi and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is a unique connective tissue disease
w i th overlapping features of systemic sclerosis (SSc), systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE), and polymyositis (PM), along with the presence of
antibodies to U1 ribonucleoprotein (RNP).

• It was first described by Sharp and colleagues in 1972 in a subset of 25
patients with these overlapping features.

• Initially it was thought to have a benign nature and steroid responsiveness.
Subsequent longitudinal studies have shown that in some patients it may not be
a benign disease.
Epidemiology and Risk Factors

• Prevalence of MCTD is thought to be 10/100,000 with a female to male ratio of
10:1. It does not show the relative preponderance in African-Americans that is
seen in SLE.

• Occupational exposure to vinyl chloride has been described as a risk factor.
• It is associated with HLA-DR4, DR1, and less prominently DR2.
Pathogenesis

• The sine qua non of MCTD is an antibody against U1-RNP, one of the major
components of the spliceosome.

• The pathogenicity of anti–U1-RNP has not been confirmed, but high-titer anti–
U1-RNP is present in most MCTD patients. U1-RNP antibodies in MCTD are
directed against a 70 kD polypeptide linked noncovalently to U1-RNA in the
spliceosome.
495

• Anti–U1-RNP antibodies are thought to induce cytokine and adhesion molecule
production by binding to endothelial cells. This could lead to vascular disease
pathogenesis, such as Raynaud’s phenomenon (RP), puffy hands, sclerodactyly,
pulmonary hypertension, and possibly interstitial lung disease (ILD) and
esophageal dysmotility.1

• Alternatively, U1-RNP antibodies could form immune complexes which
activate complement to induce myositis, arthritis, and perhaps ILD.

• T cells appear to have a central role in the pathogenesis of MCTD and
activation of the innate immune system via Toll-like receptor signaling,
autoantibody production, and autoantigen presentation. CD4 T lymphocytes
provide differentiation factors that induce B-cell isotype gene switching, and
mediate tissue injury via cytokines.1
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Features

• Patients have clinical features of SLE, SSc, and PM, although the features of
each might occur at different times over the course of the disease.

• Polyarthritis affects most patients with MCTD and is often a presenting
feature. Fifty to seventy percent are rheumatoid factor (RF) positive and some
have erosive disease.

• Myalgias and myositis range from mild to severe and can be histologically
indistinguishable from PM or SLE.

• Swollen or puffy fingers, acrosclerosis, or sclerodactyly can be seen.
• RP is seen in MCTD, with findings on nailfold capillaroscopy similar to those
seen in scleroderma.

• Pulmonary hypertension is the leading cause of death in MCTD. Blood
vessels have intimal hyperplasia (plexiform lesion) and smooth muscle
hypertrophy.2

• Other pulmonary manifestations of MCTD include ILD, pleural effusion,
alveolar hemorrhage, diaphragmatic dysfunction, pulmonary vasculitis, and
thromboembolic disease.

• Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and esophageal dysmotility occur
in MCTD, similar to that of scleroderma.
496

• Additional features may include malar or discoid rash, hemolytic anemia,
leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, secondary Sjögren’s syndrome trigeminal
neuralgia, pericarditis, renovascular hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.
Diagnostic Criteria

• There is no American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for MCTD.
• The criteria developed by both Alarcon-Segovia and Kahn have moderate
sensitivity and good specificity. 3 Their criteria include high-titer U1-RNP
antibodies in the appropriate clinical setting.
Alarcon-Segovia’s clinical criteria require three or more of the following
clinical features, one of which must be synovitis or myositis: swollen hands,
synovitis, myositis, RP and acrosclerosis.
Kahn’s clinical criteria require the presence of RP plus at least two of the
following: swollen fingers, synovitis, and myositis.
Diagnostic Testing
Characteristic immunologic findings include speckled pattern fluorescent antinuclear
antibody (ANA) in high titers and antibodies to U1-RNP in moderate to high titer.
Fifty to seventy percent are RF positive.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes SLE, SSc, PM, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Of
note, up to 20% of SLE patients also have anti–U1-RNP antibody positivity but these
are frequently associated with anti-Sm antibodies.
TREATMENT
The mainstay of therapy remains treatment of underlying organ involvement, on the
basis of data extrapolated from SLE, RA, myositis, or SSc and presented in Table
40-1.4

ORGAN SYSTEM

497

PROGNOSIS
498

The inflammatory features (e.g., arthritis, serositis, myositis) of the disease tend to
predominate early in disease course, and fibrotic ones (e.g., esophageal dysmotility,
pulmonary hypertension, ILD) later. The overall prognosis is highly variable.

Undifferentiated Connective Tissue Disease
Rebecca Brinker and Amy Joseph
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Undifferentiated connective tissue disease (UCTD) is also known as early
lupus, latent lupus, or incomplete lupus.

• 30% of patients develop a definite connective tissue disease (CTD) within the
first 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. Transition into a definitive CTD decreases each
year from the time of diagnosis.1
The most common CTD to develop is systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Patients with predominant skin manifestations, such as discoid lupus,
alopecia, and photosensitivity, have a greater chance of evolving into SLE.

• 70% of patients who remain classified as UCTD are considered to have stable
UCTD.
Definition

• UCTD is a condition in which a patient possesses clinical manifestations and
serologic markers suggestive of an autoimmune process but fails to fulfill the
classification criteria for a definite CTD.

• This diagnosis is distinct from overlap syndrome, which occurs when a
patient possesses criteria for more than one rheumatologic diagnosis.
Epidemiology
Few reliable epidemiologic data are available because of lack of criteria for
diagnosis but the following have been noted:

• UCTD is significantly more prevalent in females.1
• Onset typically occurs between 32 and 44 years of age.1

500

Etiology/Pathophysiology
The cause of UCTD is not well understood but it is thought to be caused by immune
dysregulation in a genetically susceptible host.
Risk Factors
Risk factors include female gender and having a family history of autoimmune
disease.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• UCTD physical manifestations are generally mild.
• Raynaud’s phenomenon is a typical feature of UCTD but nailfold
capillaroscopy is normal.

• Inflammatory arthritis is often a prominent feature but is nonerosive. No
reliable studies have evaluated patients for the presence of synovitis or
effusions.

• A nonspecific rash may be present and on biopsy this typically shows interface
dermatitis.
History

• Fever
• Mild to moderate Raynaud’s phenomenon
• Diffuse arthralgias
• Oral or nasal ulcerations
• Nonspecific rash with or without photosensitivity
• Alopecia
• Sicca symptoms
• Chest pain with reclining or deep inhalation
Physical Examination

• Dry oral and nasal mucosa
501

• Nonspecific rash
• Hair loss
• Mild inflammatory arthritis
• Digital color changes consistent with Raynaud’s phenomenon
Diagnostic Criteria
There are no commonly accepted diagnostic criteria but the following are often used
to aid in diagnosis:

• Signs and symptoms suggestive of a CTD are present but without fulfilling any
specific CTD criteria and with a duration of at least 3 years in the setting of
positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA).2

• Proposed exclusion criteria included malar rash, cutaneous lupus, skin
sclerosis, heliotrope rash, Gottron’s plaques, erosive arthritis, and specific
antibodies (anti-double stranded DNA [dsDNA], anti-Sm, anti–Scl-70,
anticentromere, anti-SSB/La, anti-Jo1, and anti–Mi-2).3

• Neurologic involvement is almost always absent.
• Kidney involvement is almost always absent.
• Leukopenia is often present.
• Arthritis is nonerosive and arthralgias are a prominent feature.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential of UCTD includes: Mixed CTD, SLE, Sjögren’s syndrome,
scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), polymyositis/dermatomyositis, vasculitis,
and fibromyalgia.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory

• Immunologic:1
ANA is positive in approximately 90% of patients.
Anti-SSA/Ro and anti-ribonucleoprotein (RNP) are the most commonly
positive specific autoantibodies.
502

Up to 80% of patients have only a single stable autoantibody.
Patients with homogenous ANA, anti-dsDNA, anti-SSA/Ro, anti-Sm, or
anticardiolipin antibodies are more likely to develop SLE.

• Hematologic findings are rarely severe enough to warrant treatment. The most
common finding is leukopenia but anemia and thrombocytopenia have also
been observed.
Imaging
No imaging is specifically required for diagnosis. However, imaging may be
completed to help rule out other diagnoses such as RA.
Diagnostic Procedures
Nailfold capillaroscopy will reveal normal capillaries.
TREATMENT
Medications
Medications are directed against specific manifestations of the disease. There are no
formal studies on medications used for the treatment of UCTD but the following are
often used.
First Line

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of therapy.
They are used to reduce pain and inflammation, and to treat arthralgias.

• Hydroxychloroquine is most commonly used to treat patients with myalgias
and arthralgias resistant to NSAID monotherapy and to treat mucocutaneous
manifestations.

• Corticosteroids may be used for disease resistant to the above treatment or for
disease flares. Recommended length of corticosteroid treatment varies. The
patient should be treated with the lowest dose for the shortest period of time
possible to minimize corticosteroid side effects.
Second Line
Immunosuppressive medications are reserved for rare severe systemic disease
with internal organ involvement.
503

Non-pharmacologic Therapies

• Physical therapy and exercise.
• Decrease sun exposure if photosensitive rash is present.
• Decrease exposure to cold and stress if Raynaud’s phenomenon is present.
REFERRAL
Possible referrals depend on the patient’s manifestation, but may include
rheumatology, dermatology, hematology, and neurology.
MONITORING AND FOLLOW-UP

• Review signs and symptoms of UCTD at each visit in an effort to screen for
progression to definite CTD.

• Periodically check complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistries, and
urinalysis to monitor for the development of CTD.
PROGNOSIS

• 30% of patients develop definitive CTD and outcomes are then determined by
the CTD diagnosis.1

• A large number of patients only require intermittent symptomatic treatment.
• Up to 20% of patients have symptoms that subside over time.
• Internal organ involvement is very rare.

Adult-Onset Still’s Disease
Amy Archer and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Adult-onset Still’s disease (AOSD) is a rare inflammatory condition consisting
of a constellation of clinical and laboratory findings that are similar to those of
systemic juvenile arthritis (Still’s disease).

• AOSD is characterized by spiking fevers, arthritis, and an evanescent rash
that occurs concurrently with the febrile periods.
Epidemiology

• The incidence of AOSD is estimated to be 0.16 to 0.40 new cases per 100,000
patients per year, depending on the population.1,2

• It occurs in a bimodal distribution, most commonly between the age of 15 and
25 and 36 and 46. However, cases of AOSD have been reported in patients
over 60 years old.

• There is no gender predilection.
Pathophysiology
It is speculated that an immune-mediated mechanism as well as a number of viral
and bacterial infections play a role in its pathophysiology.3
DIAGNOSIS
AOSD is a diagnosis of exclusion.
Clinical Presentation
History
506

• Patients can present with myriad symptoms.
• The dominant manifestation is a spiking fever, often greater than 39 °C. The
fever classically follows a quotidian (daily) or double quotidian (twice a
day) pattern of peaks, often with an afebrile period between spikes. The fevers
typically occur in the late afternoon or evening and may follow a regular cycle.

• Coincident with fevers is the appearance of a characteristic transitory salmoncolored rash.

• Arthritis and arthralgias involving the knees, wrists, ankles, proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints, elbows, and shoulders are common manifestations
of AOSD. 4 However, synovitis may not be present at the onset and patients
may never develop inflammatory arthritis.

• Patients can also present primarily with myalgias.
Physical Examination

• The salmon-colored macular or maculopapular rash may be difficult to identify
on routine examination given its transient nature. It is usually found on the trunk
or extremities and may be precipitated by rubbing (the Koebner
phenomenon).

• Oligoarticular joint involvement is usually gradual in onset and mild in nature
but may progress to a more destructive arthritis.

• Additional clinical findings may include pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy,
splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
and cardiopulmonary
(pericarditis, pleural effusions, and pulmonary infiltrates).

involvement

Diagnostic Criteria

• The diagnosis of AOSD is a diagnosis of exclusion.
• The Yamaguchi criteria for AOSD are presented in Table 42-1.5
• These criteria carry an estimated sensitivity of 93% when five of the features
are present with at least two from the major criteria.
Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis includes granulomatous disorders, vasculitis,
connective tissue diseases (systemic lupus erythematous, mixed connective tissue
507

disease), malignancy (lymphoma, leukemia), and infection (viral or bacterial). The
more prolonged the clinical course, in the absence of another definitive diagnosis,
the more likely the diagnosis will be AOSD.
Diagnostic Testing
Although laboratory and radiographic abnormalities may lend support to the
diagnosis of AOSD, no test alone is specific for the disease.
TABLE 42-1 YAMAGUCHI CRITERIA FOR ADULT STILL’S DISEASEA

Laboratory

• The complete blood count (CBC) usually reveals a leukocytosis with a
predominance of neutrophils; a normocytic, normochromic anemia; and
thrombocytosis.

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are
almost always considerably elevated, which is consistent with an
inflammatory condition.

• Liver enzymes often demonstrate mild elevations of aminotransferases, alkaline
phosphatase, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).

• Serum ferritin levels can be markedly elevated.
Elevated ferritin levels usually correlate with disease activity and have been
508

proposed as markers of treatment response.
Levels between 3,000 and 30,000 are common and levels greater than
250,000 have been reported.
The proportion of glycosylated ferritin is low and this may also be a clue to
diagnosis.6,7 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is also associated with
hyperferritinemia and a low percentage of glycosylation.8

• Antinuclear antibodies (ANAs) and rheumatoid factor (RF) are usually
negative but may be present in low titers. Anti-cyclic citrullinated protein
(CCP) antibodies are almost always negative.9
Imaging

• Radiographic findings in AOSD are relatively uncommon.
• A nonerosive narrowing of the carpometacarpal joints and the intercarpal
spaces within the wrist (with sparing of metacarpophalangeal joints) may be
seen, which can lead to ankylosis of the wrist. Other joints may uncommonly
be involved.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Lymph node biopsies display a large range of nonspecific histologic changes
including typical/atypical paracortical hyperplasia, vascular proliferation,
histiocyte aggregation, exuberant immunoblastic reaction, and follicular
hyperplasia.10 Clearly, such findings could be confused with
lymphoproliferative disorders but immunohistochemistry can be used to
differentiate.

• Skin biopsy reveals a nonspecific mild perivascular inflammation of the
superficial dermis with infiltration of lymphocytes and histiocytes.

• Joint fluid aspiration shows a leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance.
TREATMENT
Medications

• Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are effective in most patients
with AOSD for relief of mild to moderate inflammatory symptoms. Indomethacin and naproxen may be more efficacious than salicylates. Monitoring
for renal, hepatic, and gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity is recommended.3,4
509

• Corticosteroids are indicated for severe inflammatory manifestations. Oral
prednisone, dosed at 0.5 to 1 mg/kg daily or IV methylprednisolone followed
by oral prednisone, is usually effective.3,4

• Small studies suggest that oral methotrexate is effective as a steroid-sparing
agent. Polyarthritis, in particular, often responds to methotrexate.3,4,11

• Observational evidence suggests that hydroxychloroquine, azathioprine,
cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, IV immunoglobulin, etanercept, infliximab,12
anakinra,13 abatacept,14 tocilizumab,15 and rituximab may be useful in the
treatment of AOSD.

• Sulfasalazine has been associated with a high rate of toxicity and should be
avoided.16
Other Non-pharmacologic Therapies
Local joint injections with steroids may provide symptomatic relief.
COMPLICATIONS
Patients with AOSD have been noted to develop reactive/secondary
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (also known as the hemophagocytic syndrome
or macrophage activation syndrome),17 cardiac tamponade, acute hepatic failure,
myocarditis, amyloidosis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), interstitial
lung disease and pulmonary hypertension.
REFERRAL
Patients can benefit from the input of physiotherapists, occupational therapists,
psychologists and/or arthritis support groups.
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• The course of AOSD is variable. Approximately one-third of patients
experiences a complete resolution within a year of onset. One-third will
experience a cyclic relapsing and remitting pattern of the disease. The
remaining one-third experiences a chronic active disease, which is often
associated with destructive arthritis similar to rheumatoid arthritis.

• Factors associated with a poor prognosis include disease refractory to

corticosteroids, polyarthritis, and a persistently elevated ferritin.

• Factors associated with a good prognosis are a prompt resolution of clinical
and laboratory abnormalities, and lack of a relapse as steroids are reduced
(usually over a 2–3 month period).

Relapsing Polychondritis
Lesley Davila and John P. Atkinson
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Relapsing polychondritis (RP) is a rare disease characterized by recurrent
inflammation of cartilaginous structures, most commonly the outer ear, nose,
tracheobronchial tree, and peripheral and axial joints. RP can also affect other
proteoglycan-rich structures (e.g., the eye, heart, vessels, and inner ear).
Epidemiology

• RP occurs mostly in Caucasian patients aged 40 to 60 years.
• It tends to occur with equal frequencies in both sexes but, some case series
report a female predominance.

• About one-third of cases is associated with either a myelodysplastic syndrome
or an autoimmune disease, including primary systemic vasculitides and
connective tissue diseases (CTD).1,2
Etiology/Pathophysiology

• The etiology of RP is unknown, but strong evidence suggests that RP is caused
by an immune-mediated attack on cartilaginous structures. Both humoral and
cell-mediated mechanisms are thought to be involved.

• 20% to 50% of patients have serum antibodies to collagen II, which is normally
found in large amounts in cartilage. These antibodies are also found in other
autoimmune diseases so their detection is not a useful clinical test.

• HLA-DR4 has been associated with increased risk for RP.
Associated Conditions
513

• RP is also associated with a number of vasculitides, CTDs especially
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
hematologic and autoimmune diseases.

• These include most other rheumatic diseases and CTDs, myelodysplastic
syndromes, lymphoma, pernicious anemia, acute leukemias, hypothyroidism,
Hashimoto thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, ulcerative colitis, myasthenia gravis,
primary biliary cirrhosis, and diabetes mellitus.1,2
DIAGNOSIS
The main manifestations of RP are otorhinolaryngeal disease, respiratory
compromise, arthritis, and ocular inflammation.
Clinical Presentation

• The most common symptom is auricular chondritis.
It is characterized by the sudden onset of unilateral or bilateral auricular
swelling, pain, warmth, and erythema or violaceous discoloration.
The inflammation affects the cartilaginous structures of the ear with sparing
of the lobes, which do not contain cartilage.
The episode usually resolves, with or without treatment, within days or
weeks.
Recurrent attacks result in soft, nodular, and deformed ears.

• RP causes conductive and/or neurosensory hearing loss in approximately 50%
of patients.
Conductive hearing loss is caused by collapse of auricular cartilage or by
swelling of the external auditory canal or Eustachian tubes. Serous or
purulent otitis media can also occur.
Neurosensory hearing loss is caused by vasculitis of the cochlear branch of
the internal auditory artery.

• Vasculitis of the vestibular branch is also common, resulting in vertigo, ataxia,
nausea, and vomiting.
If acute, these symptoms can mimic a posterior circulation stroke.
Although the hearing loss is often permanent, vestibular symptoms usually
improve.
514

• Nasal chondritis occurs in approximately 50% of patients.
It is more common in women and in those <50 years.
It presents as nasal pain, a sensation of nasal and adjacent tissue fullness,
and, occasionally, epistaxis.
Recurrent attacks may result in saddle nose deformity.

• Respiratory tract involvement is the main cause of death in some case series.
Inflammation of the cartilage in the larynx, trachea, and bronchial tree causes
hoarseness, throat pain, difficulty talking, aphonia, dyspnea, cough, stridor,
wheezing, and choking.
Obstruction can occur in varying degrees and at different levels.
Total obstruction of the upper airways can occur from attempted
bronchoscopy, intubation, or tracheostomy.
Involvement of the lower airways is often asymptomatic until detected by
radiographs, bronchoscopy, or spirometry.
Respiratory infections are common and result from impaired drainage of
secretions caused by airway collapse and impaired mucociliary function.
Parenchymal pulmonary disease is not a feature of RP.

• Arthritis is the second most common manifestation of RP.
It is a presenting symptom in 30% of patients and occurs in up to 80% of
patients during the course of disease.
The arthritis is nondeforming and nonerosive.
The most commonly affected joints are the metacarpophalangeal (MCP),
proximal interphalangeal (PIP), knee, ankle, wrist, and metatarsophalangeal
(MTP).
Acute monoarthritis and tenosynovitis can also occur.

• The eye is involved in approximately 50% of patients.
Eye inflammation is more common in men and is frequently associated with
systemic manifestations.
Inflammation affects any part of the eye, most commonly as scleritis,
episcleritis, keratoconjunctivitis sicca, and peri-orbital edema. Uveitis,
keratitis, corneal thinning, proptosis (from inflammation of posterior globe
elements) and retinal vasculitis can also occur.

• Systemic vasculitis occurs in up to one-quarter of patients with RP. Large,
515

medium, and small vessels may be affected.
In some patients, vasculitis appears to be due to the primary disease process
and in others it is a separate but associated condition.
Described vasculitides include Takayasu’s arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa,
Henoch–Schönlein purpura, Wegener’s granulomatosis, Behçet’s syndrome,
microscopic polyangiitis, cutaneous vasculitis, and urticarial vasculitis.
The overlap between Behçet’s syndrome and RP is sometime referred to as
“MAGIC” syndrome (mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage).3

• The kidney is affected in approximately 15% of patients. The most common
histopathologic findings are mild mesangial proliferation and focal segmental
necrotizing glomerulonephritis caused by glomerular deposition of C3, IgG,
and IgM.

• Skin involvement occurs in approximately 20% of cases. Palpable purpura,
urticaria, and angioedema are the most common cutaneous manifestations.
Livedo reticularis, migratory superficial thrombophlebitis, erythema nodosum,
erythema multiforme, and panniculitis are rare.

• Cardiovascular involvement includes aortic and mitral inflammation with
subsequent aortic root dilatation, valvulitis, papillary muscle dysfunction,
valvular regurgitation, cardiomyopathy, and atrioventricular conduction
blocks.
Diagnostic Criteria
The original criteria proposed by McAdam et al. for RP with modifications
suggested by Damiani et al. are presented in Table 43-1.2,4
Differential Diagnosis

• The differential diagnosis depends on manifestations of RP.
• The auricular chondritis resembles infectious cellulitis of bacterial origin.
Sparing of the earlobe is a diagnostic clue but biopsy is helpful for culture and
histology. Recurrence of relapsing “bacterial infection” of the outer ear should
always raise suspicion for RP.
TABLE 43-1 PROPOSED MCADAM’S DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR
RELAPSING POLYCHONDRITIS
516

• Saddle nose deformity and laryngotracheal chondritis can be mistaken for
Wegener’s granulomatosis, although RP is confined strictly to cartilaginous
portions of the airways. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) are
negative in RP. Trauma, lymphoma, and syphilis should also be considered.

• The arthritis can mimic RA.
• Ocular symptoms and arthritis can be mistaken for some of the seronegative
spondyloarthropathies.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory findings of RP are nonspecific markers of inflammation: elevated ESR,
normochromic normocytic anemia of chronic inflammation, leukocytosis,
thrombocytosis, and hypergammaglobulinemia.
Imaging

• ECG or echocardiography should be considered if valve disease is suspected.
• CT or other imaging should be done of the neck and lungs to assess the
laryngotracheobronchial tree.
Diagnostic Procedures
Spirometry with inspiratory and expiratory volume curves should be performed and
may show various dynamic intrathoracic or extrathoracic obstructive patterns.
TREATMENT
517

Treatment is aimed at prevention of flares and managing complications of the
disease.
Medications
First Line

• Corticosteroids are the main form of therapy for RP.
• Oral prednisone, 1 mg/kg daily, is often necessary to suppress inflammation.
The dose can be decreased on the basis of clinical response to the lowest
necessary dose.

• Pulse IV methylprednisolone 1000 mg daily for 3 days followed by daily PO
prednisone, is used for acute airway closure.
Second Line

• Recommendations for therapy are based on rather limited data and are,
therefore, empiric in nature.

• Other immunosuppressants have been tried as steroid-sparing drugs, with
methotrexate possibly being the most effective.5,6

• Other treatments (e.g., dapsone, colchicine, azathioprine, cyclosporine,
penicillamine, and plasma exchange) have been tried and seem to be less
effective.

• On the basis of other data and case reports regarding RP patients, focal
segmental glomerulonephritis may be successfully treated with steroids and
either daily PO or monthly IV cyclophosphamide.7–10

• Recently, anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) agents such as etanercept,
adalimumab, and infliximab have been used with some success for refractory
disease.11–13

• The interleukin (IL)-1 inhibitor anakinra has also been reported to be effective
in refractory disease.14
Surgical Management
Surgical management of respiratory tract RP includes tracheostomy or bronchial
stent placement. Iatrogenic trauma may cause complete obstruction.
518

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Most patients experience intermittent episodes of inflammation and develop
some degree of disability (e.g., bilateral deafness, impaired vision, phonation
difficulties, or cardiorespiratory problems).

• Follow-up involves clinical assessment of disease activity with careful
attention to the pulmonary status.

• Associated conditions such as CTD or hematologic abnormalities may develop
at any point in the disease course.

Deposition and Storage Arthropathies
Hyon Ju Park and Zarmeena Ali
• Arthropathies can result from deposition of normal materials like metal ions
or from accumulation of abnormally processed biochemical intermediates.
Arthropathy is often the initial presentation of storage and deposition diseases.

• Due to storage and deposition arthropathies being relatively rare, they are often
mistaken for more common diseases like osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid
arthritis (RA).

• Given the systemic nature of these arthropathies, an accurate diagnosis is
important to guide appropriate therapy.

HEMOCHROMATOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Hemochromatosis is a disease characterized by excessive body iron stores and the
visceral deposition of hemosiderin in susceptible organs (i.e., liver, adrenal glands,
heart, skin, gonads, joints, and pancreas).
Classification

• Genetic or hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an autosomal recessive
disorder. More than 90% of patients with HH possess a C282Y mutation of
the HFE gene. Individuals who are heterozygous for C282Y HFE mutation
may have an increased risk for hand OA.

• Secondary hemochromatosis occurs in the setting of prolonged excessive iron
ingestion or repeated blood transfusions in patients with chronic
hypoproliferative anemia, sickle cell anemia, and thalassemia. End-organ
damage due to secondary hemochromatosis tends to be milder than that of HH.
521

Epidemiology

• The incidence is fairly common, one in 200 to 300 people.
• HH affects men more than women (10:1) with age of onset delayed in women
secondary to regular iron loss through menstruation. Median age of men is
about 50, while median age of women is the mid-60s at presentation.

• Patients of European descent are six times more likely to develop HH than
blacks.
Pathophysiology

• HFE gene mutation leads to increased intestinal iron absorption and
decreased hepcidin expression in the liver, resulting in iron deposition in
hepatocytes and other viscera.

• The pathogenesis of HH arthropathy is unknown but there is speculation that
ionic iron inhibits pyrophosphatase activity leading to pseudogout arthropathy.
Associated Conditions
Patients with HH also have an increased susceptibility to certain infectious diseases
caused by siderophilic microorganisms such as Vibrio, Yersinia, Listeria, and
Escherichia coli.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Patients with HH can present with cirrhosis, adrenal insufficiency, heart
failure, diabetes, or polyarthropathy.

• Chronic progressive arthritis, mechanical in nature, is a frequent complaint
(about 50%) and often predates other symptoms of iron overload.
Second and third metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints are the most common joints affected (about
50%) with the dominant hand either solely or more severely involved.
On examination, joints are not inflamed but are mildly tender with slightly
decreased range of motion.
Larger joints like shoulders, hips, and knees may also be affected.
522

Chondrocalcinosis is a late but characteristic feature of arthropathy seen in
HH and can manifest as episodes of acute monoarticular arthritis.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Diagnosis is based on detection of HFE genotype in the setting of elevated ferritin
(300–1000 mg/L) and transferrin saturation greater than 45%.1
Imaging

• Radiologic changes resemble OA with irregular joint space narrowing and
sclerotic cyst formation. HH arthropathy has less osteophytosis and no
involvement of carpometacarpal (CMC) joints as classically seen in OA.

• There may be isolated ulnar styloid erosions.
• Chondrocalcinosis may be the sole abnormality in about 50% of patients with
HH arthropathy.
TREATMENT

• Treatment is aimed at reduction of iron load using phlebotomy and iron
chelators. However, reduction in body iron stores has little effect on HH
arthropathy.

• Symptoms are managed much like OA with acetaminophen, nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and local steroid
injections.

• Limiting alcohol and red meat intake while increasing consumption of
substances that inhibit iron absorption like high tannin teas may be of benefit.

WILSON’S DISEASE
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Wilson’s disease, also known as hepatolenticular degeneration, is an autosomal
523

recessive disorder resulting in excess copper accumulation.
Epidemiology

• Incidence is one in 30,000 to 40,000.
• Age at presentation ranges from 6 to 40 years.
Pathophysiology

• Wilson’s disease is caused by mutations in the ATP7B gene, which is
translated into a membrane-bound copper-transporting ATPase.

• Membrane-bound copper-transporting ATPase deficiency leads to excess
copper accumulation affecting liver, kidney, brain, and joints.

• Pathogenesis of arthropathy is unclear but its severity does not correlate with
neurologic, hepatic, or renal disease. By elemental analysis, copper has been
found in the synovium of Wilson’s disease patients and is thought to contribute
to the development of arthropathy.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Patients presenting before the age of 20 usually have progressive hepatic
failure. Patients presenting after their 20s tend to have more psychiatric or
neurologic manifestations.

• Arthropathy tends to be mild and is present in about 50% of patients.
Joint manifestations are similar to those of OA with mechanical pain and
crepitus.
Commonly affected joints include knees, shoulders, ankles, and spine, but
feet, wrists, and neck can be involved. Hip and MCP involvement is rare.

• Kayser–Fleischer rings are present in more than 99% of patients if neurologic
or psychiatric symptoms are present. The presence of Kayser–Fleischer rings
on slit-lamp examination supports the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease.
Diagnostic Testing
524

Laboratories

• Although serum ceruloplasmin is the cheapest test, it is low only in 90% of
Wilson’s patients.

• 24-hour urine copper (>100 μg/day) has greater than 98% sensitivity but can
easily be contaminated or collected improperly.

• Genetic testing is currently not useful because of the large number of
inactivating mutations.

• The “gold standard” for diagnosis is a liver biopsy with quantitative copper
assays.
Imaging

• Radiographic changes seen resemble OA with irregular joint space
narrowing, sclerotic cyst formation, and marked osteophyte formation with
often calcified loose bodies seen predominately at the wrist.

• Generalized osteoporosis is seen in 50% of patients.
TREATMENT

• Treatment is aimed at reduction of copper load using chelation therapy.
Penicillamine was previously the chelator of choice but due to its toxicity, it
has been supplanted by zinc and trientine (triethylenetetramine).2

• Avoidance of high copper food items including mushrooms, nuts, chocolate,
shellfish, and liver is recommended.

• Arthropathy is managed with local therapy as symptoms are mild.
Acetaminophen and NSAIDs should be used with great caution in patients
with liver and possible renal tubular acidosis.

OCHRONOSIS (ALKAPTONURIA)
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from a deficiency of
525

homogentisic acid oxidase (HGO).
Epidemiology

• Incidence is one in 200,000.
• An unusually high incidence has been found in an area of Germany near the
Czech border, presumably as a result of consanguineous mating.
Pathophysiology

• A loss of function mutation leading to a complete deficiency of HGO leads to
accumulation of homogentisic acid, a normal intermediate in tyrosine
metabolism.

• Homogentisic acid deposits as a pigmented polymer in the cartilage, skin,
and sclerae.

• The pigmented polymers penetrate into bone, synovium, and joint cavity,
possibly triggering formation of osteochondral bodies.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Manifestation

• Diagnosis is suspected in patients who develop early OA in atypical joints or
in those complaining of passing dark urine.

• Patients usually present with progressive degenerative arthropathy involving
spine and larger peripheral joints beginning in their late 30s or early 40s.
Hands and wrists are usually spared.3

• Stiffness and loss of joint mobility lead to severe disability but arthritis is
noninflammatory and nonerosive in nature.

• Cutaneous manifestations are common later in life and include slate-blue or
gray discoloration of sclerae, pinnae, nose, axillae, and groin.

• Pigment may also appear in perspiration, staining clothes.
• Prostatic and renal calculi may form. Cardiac valvular pigment deposits are
rare but may contribute to degeneration of valves.

526

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Diagnosis is supported by fragments of darkly pigmented cartilage seen as
black specks in synovial fluid, patient’s urine turning black upon oxidation or
alkalinization, or darkly pigmented synovium seen incidentally during
arthroscopy.

• Diagnosis is confirmed by quantification of homogentisic acid in serum and
urine.

• Genetic testing is available but usually not necessary for diagnosis.
Imaging

• The earliest radiologic changes are multiple vacuum discs of the spine.
Disease progresses with calcification of the discs with narrowing, collapse,
and even autofusion of the vertebral discs. Sacroiliac (SI) and apophyseal
joints are spared.

• Radiographs of knees, hips, shoulders will show changes much like OA with
joint space narrowing, marginal osteophytes, and subchondral cysts. Pigmented
cartilage is radiolucent.
TREATMENT

• Current available therapy is supportive only. This includes NSAIDs, physical
therapy, protection of joints from overuse injury and weight reduction.

• Nitisinone, an agent blocking an earlier step in tyrosine metabolism, has
been shown to decrease urinary excretion of homogentisic acid. In a small
trial, six out of seven patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week
reported significant improvement in their joint pain.4 There is an ongoing
larger trial evaluating for long-term safety and efficacy.

• Arthroplasty of knees or hips is reserved for the most severe cases.
MULTICENTRIC RETICULOHISTIOCYTOSIS
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

527

Definition
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare dermatoarthritis primarily
affecting middle-aged women and is characterized by cellular accumulation of
glycolipid-laden histiocytes in joints and in skin.
Pathophysiology

• Etiology is unknown but is thought to involve an often self-limited inflammatory
reaction triggered by autoimmunity, malignancy, and infections.5

• Some studies have also demonstrated an increase in tumor necrosis factor
(TNF)-α in blood and tissue.

• MRH is associated with autoimmune diseases like scleroderma, Sjögren’s
syndrome, and dermatomyositis in about 10% to 15% of cases.

• At diagnosis, up to 30% of patients were found to have a concomitant
malignancy.

• Up to 25% of patients were reported to have been exposed to tuberculosis in
the 6 months before being diagnosed with MRH. Five percent of patients were
found to have active tuberculosis at diagnosis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Manifestation

• In 60% of cases, patients present with arthritis as their initial sign of
disease.6

• MRH arthritis is a severe symmetric, erosive, inflammatory polyarthritis
predominately affecting hands, wrists, and knees.

• Active synovitis is seen on examination and hence, is most often mistaken for
aggressive seronegative RA. However, MRH tends to destroy both the distal
interphalangeals (DIPs) and PIPs prior to significant destruction of the
MCPs.

• Cutaneous manifestations comprise papulonodular lesions ranging from a
few millimeters to a centimeter in diameter. The lesions are scattered and
isolated well-circumscribed, round, yellow-brown nodules preferentially
affecting fingers, nailfolds, and oral and nasal mucosa.
528

Diagnostic Testing
Diagnosis is made by skin or synovial biopsy demonstrating the presence of
numerous multinucleated giant cells and histiocytes with an abundant eosinophilic,
finely granular cytoplasm (glycolipids).
Imaging
Hand radiographs may show articular punched out lesions like gouty tophi but these
will rapidly progress to severe joint destruction and even arthritis mutilans.
TREATMENT

• When not associated with a malignancy, MRH spontaneously resolves in an
average time period of about 8 years in most patients.

• Systemic steroids, cyclophosphamide, chlorambucil, or methotrexate may
prevent further joint destruction and cause skin lesions to regress.

• Antimalarials have also been used.
• TNF antagonists’ use is anecdotal.
LYSOSOMAL STORAGE DISEASES
• There are more than 30 different lysosomal storage diseases, which are
classified on the basis of their accumulated material.

• Most are diagnosed during infancy and childhood, with a few milder forms
presenting in adulthood.

• Gaucher’s disease and Fabry’s disease are two of the more common lysosomal
storage diseases with arthritic manifestations. They will be briefly reviewed
but further details are beyond the scope of this manual.
GAUCHER’S DISEASE

• Gaucher’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder resulting from defective
activity
of lysosomal β-glucosidase leading
glucocerebroside in the reticuloendothelial system.7

• Painless splenomegaly is a common presenting feature.
529

to

accumulation

of

• Patients have infiltration of bone marrow by lipid-laden macrophages (Gaucher
cells), which can lead to cortical bone destruction, infarction, and necrosis
of long bones.

• Marrow involvement spreads proximal to distally in limbs and may involve the
spine causing vertebral collapse.

• Patients can develop acute “bone crises” due to sudden ischemia of infiltrated
bone and cause excruciating pain and erythema in the affected area. Fever
simulating osteomyelitis or septic arthritis may also be seen. Bone remodeling
is also defective leading to osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, and vertebral
compression fractures.

• Diagnosis is based on leukocyte β-glucosidase levels.
• Treatment of significantly affected patients is with enzyme replacement therapy
with modified glucocerebroside. Enzyme replacement is effective in
diminishing hematologic findings. Bone pain and disease decrease with
enzyme replacement. Bisphosphonates are used as adjunctive therapy for
osteoporosis and pain.
FABRY’S DISEASE

• Fabry’s disease is an X-linked disorder resulting in mutations in the αgalactosidase gene leading to accumulation of glycosphingolipids in nerves,
viscera, and osteoarticular tissues.

• Disease manifestations include hypohidrosis, corneal and lenticular opacities,
acroparesthesia, angiokeratomas, and small vessel disease of kidneys, brain,
and heart.

• Patients develop degenerative polyarthritis involving shoulders, knees, hips,
wrists, and hands with significant flexion contractures of DIPs.

• Enzyme replacement therapy is effective for renal and cardiac disease only at
early stages. Enzyme replacement therapy does not impact joint disease.
Management of joint disease is palliative.

Sarcoid Arthropathy
Lesley Davila and Leslie E. Kahl
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous inflammatory disease of unknown etiology
that can involve any organ, most commonly the lung, skin, eye, and joints.

• The lung is the most commonly involved organ, occurring in over 80% of
patients. Patients usually present with fatigue and pulmonary symptoms (e.g.,
cough, dyspnea, and chest pain).

• Extrapulmonary involvement frequently accompanies the pulmonary symptoms.
Lymph nodes, liver, and spleen are frequently involved. Heart, kidney, and
pancreas are less commonly involved.

• Sarcoidosis of the musculoskeletal system occurs in 15% to 25% of patients.
• This chapter will focus mainly on musculoskeletal manifestations of
sarcoidosis.
Classification

• Acute sarcoid arthritis occurs most commonly as a polyarthritis of the
ankles, knees, elbows, and wrists.
Erythema, warmth, swelling, and tenderness of joints occur.
Involvement is usually symmetrical, and periarticular swelling, rather than
joint effusions, is common.
Acute arthritis commonly occurs in the presence of erythema nodosum and
acute uveitis.
Acute arthritis usually lasts several weeks to months and often does not recur.

• Löfgren’s syndrome is the triad of acute arthritis, erythema nodosum, and
bilateral hilar adenopathy. It usually has good prognosis.

532

• Chronic sarcoid arthritis is rare, presenting several months after the onset of
disease.
It commonly involves the knee but also can involve the ankles and proximal
interphalangeal (PIP) joints. This arthritis is not associated with erythema
nodosum.
Periosteal bone resorption appears as cysts.
Joint destruction can occur rarely with shortening and deformity of the
phalanges.

• Muscle and bone involvement is also common in sarcoidosis.
Sarcoidosis affects the muscle in the form of myopathy, atrophy, myositis,
or palpable nodules. Asymptomatic granulomatous involvement of the
muscles is documented frequently at autopsy.
Sarcoidosis causes lytic and sclerotic lesions in the bone, both of which can
be painful. Typically, lesions occur in the hands and feet but can potentially
involve any bone. Along with bone resorption, the lesions contribute to a
high risk of fracture in sarcoid patients.
Epidemiology

• The prevalence of sarcoidosis is 10 to 20 cases/100,000 population.
• The incidence is higher among blacks than other races.
• The disease also varies by geographic region and may have a genetic
component.

• Sarcoidosis occurs most commonly in patients aged 20 to 40 years.
Etiology
The underlying etiology of sarcoidosis is not known. Evidence exists for genetic,
environmental, and infectious associations.1
Pathophysiology

• Sarcoidosis is characterized pathologically as the presence of noncaseating
granulomas in affected organs. This process has been best characterized in the
lung.
533

• The earliest clinical manifestation is a mononuclear infiltration of CD4+ T
cells into the organ, which then organizes into noncaseating granulomas.

• Over time the granulomas can heal without sequelae or undergo fibrosis
leading to organ dysfunction.
Associated Conditions
Sarcoidosis has been described in association with other autoimmune disorders,
including rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome,
and psoriatic arthritis.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Clinical manifestations of sarcoidosis vary depending on which organ systems
are involved. It may be easy to diagnose sarcoidosis in a patient with bilateral
hilar adenopathy, pulmonary infiltrates, or characteristic skin and eye
involvement, but more difficult if arthritis is the only manifestation.

• A thorough history and physical examination is important to identify any extraarticular manifestations that can lead to the proper diagnosis.

• Löfgren’s syndrome (i.e., bilateral hilar adenopathy, erythema nodosum, and
acute arthritis) is a common initial clinical presentation of sarcoidosis.

• Bone involvement in chronic arthritis is commonly asymptomatic but pain and
soft tissue swelling over affected areas (joints or bones) can occur.

• Skin lesions may be the first manifestation to occur. They most commonly
present as papules around the eyelids and nasolabial folds or in old scars.
Larger subcutaneous nodules, plaques, or indurated purplish facial lesions
(lupus pernio) may also occur.
Differential Diagnosis

• The differential diagnosis will vary depending on the symptoms manifested by
individual patients.

• Patients with Löfgren’s syndrome have a primarily lower extremity
inflammatory arthritis, which may also be seen in reactive arthritis or
infectious arthritides (viral, gonococcal). Septic arthritis should always be
534

considered if monoarticular or acute in nature.

• In patients with significant lymphadenopathy, infections and malignancy
should be excluded.

• Sarcoidosis can also manifest with pulmonary infiltrates, myositis, and
vasculitis and rheumatologic causes of those symptoms should be considered
as well.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) can be
elevated but are not specific for sarcoidosis.

• Serum angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels are high in three-fourths
of untreated patients; however, false positives occur frequently and limit
diagnostic utility.

• Hypercalcemia and more often hypercalciuria occur due to dysregulated
calcitriol metabolism.

• 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D levels may also be elevated.
Imaging

•

Chest radiograph findings in sarcoidosis include bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy, diffuse parenchymal changes, or a combination of both.
CT or MRI can be used to better characterize the lung and mediastinum,
especially in a patient with suspected Löfgren’s syndrome and a normal chest
radiograph.

• Joint radiographs in acute arthritis can be normal or show soft tissue swelling.
In patients with chronic arthritis or bone involvement, radiographs can be
striking.
Characteristic bone involvement involves bilateral metacarpals, metatarsals,
and phalanges, although any bone can be affected, even vertebra.
Radiographs of affected hands show subchondral lesions or cysts that
sometimes can extend into joint spaces. The bone itself can have a lacyreticulated appearance from granulomatous involvement.
Diagnostic Procedures
535

• Biopsy of the affected organ(s) is the most effective way to demonstrate the
noncaseating granulomas.
Biopsy of lymph nodes, skin, and lacrimal glands often yields diagnostic
histology.
Biopsy of lung tissue requires fiberoptic bronchoscopy with transbronchial
lung biopsy.
Biopsy is required for diagnosis if any other diagnoses (e.g., tuberculosis)
are being considered, as treatment is vastly different.
Synovial biopsy occasionally reveals granulomas but is not often performed.

• Arthrocentesis of an involved joint can be performed and is characterized by
noninflammatory synovial fluid in both acute and chronic forms of arthritis.
TREATMENT

• The decision to medicate patients for sarcoidosis should be based on clinical
assessment of disease activity.

• There is some controversy regarding whom to treat, because sarcoidosis clears
spontaneously in approximately 50% of patients.

• The choice to use corticosteroids is typically guided by persistence of
symptoms for >2 to 3 months, unless there is significant respiratory impairment
or worrisome symptoms (e.g., eye involvement, significant heart involvement,
neurologic impairment, or severe fevers, fatigue, and weight loss).
Medications
There are no FDA-approved treatments for sarcoidosis or any of its manifestations.
Large randomized clinical trials have not been performed and treatments are based
on case reports and unblinded case series.
First Line

• Mild joint symptoms often can be controlled with nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

• Corticosteroids are effective for patients with moderate to severe symptoms,
including musculoskeletal symptoms. Although corticosteroid therapy clearly
reduces inflammation and symptoms attributable to disease, there is a paucity
536

of data regarding the optimal dose and duration of treatment.
For severe vital organ dysfunction initial doses of prednisone 1 mg/kg/day
PO for 4 to 6 weeks are used, followed by slow tapering.
Löfgren’s syndrome can be treated with observation, NSAIDs, or low doses
of prednisone (10–20 mg/day) depending on severity of symptoms.
Disease can often recur after withdrawal of steroids, requiring reinitiation of
therapy.
In patients who have relapse of disease on prednisone or are unable to taper
prednisone to a tolerable dose (5–10 mg/day), second line agents can be
considered.
Second Line

• Methotrexate has been successfully used to treat pulmonary and
extrapulmonary manifestations of sarcoidosis at doses similar to those used in
rheumatoid arthritis.

• Antimalarials (hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine) have also been used to
treat extrapulmonary manifestations successfully.

• There may be a role for other medications such as leflunomide, sulfasalazine,
and minocycline.

• The use of anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medications is controversial.
Preliminary evidence suggests that infliximab and adalimumab may be
efficacious in pulmonary and extrapulmonary sarcoidosis.2 However, many
case reports and series show that sarcoidosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary)
can develop in patients treated with these medications for other diagnoses.3
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Sarcoidosis clears spontaneously in approximately 50% of patients. Relapse
of spontaneous remission is rare and most (90%) of the patients have remission
with few sequelae.

• In patients with chronic sarcoidosis, morbidity, and mortality are often from
sequelae of long-term prednisone use and pulmonary or cardiac involvement.

Amyloidosis and Amyloid Arthropathy
Rebecca Brinker and Zarmeena Ali
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Amyloidosis is a disorder characterized by deposition of various protein
subunits in extracellular tissue.

• Disease manifestations depend on the tissue distribution, concentration of
deposits, and specific precursor protein leading to fibril formation.

• There are four classes of systemic amyloidosis. However, only primary (AL)
and secondary (AA) systemic amyloidosis will be discussed in detail here.
Hereditary amyloidosis and hemodialysis-related amyloid β-2-microglobulin
(AB2M) are the remaining two types.

• Alzheimer’s disease is an example of isolated (brain) amyloidosis and is one
of the most common forms of isolated amyloidosis.

• At this time, 27 different proteins precursors of amyloid fibrils have been
identified. These proteins are not all structurally similar. Therefore,
consideration must be given to the role of cofactors, such as
glucosaminoglycans, apolipoproteins, and serum amyloid P component (SAP)
in the pathologic formation of these fibrils.

• Amyloid arthropathy is infrequent but occurs in up to 5% of patients with
amyloidosis from multiple myeloma (MM).
Definition/Classification

• Amyloid fibrils are extracellular insoluble polymers comprised of various low
molecular weight protein subunits.

• The subunits are composed of soluble precursors which undergo
conformational change leading to the formation of predominately insoluble
antiparallel β-pleated sheets that deposit in tissues.

• Most protein fibrils weigh from 5 to 25kD.
539

• Primary amyloidosis:
Also known as immunoglobulin light chain (AL) amyloidosis.
This group includes all forms of systemic amyloidosis in which the fibrils are
derived from monoclonal light chains. Causal conditions include to
monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), MM, and
Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia (WM).
It may be distinguished from a similar disorder, light chain deposition
disease (LCDD) by the fact that fibril formation of monoclonal light chains
does not occur in LCDD.

• Secondary amyloidosis:
Also known as serum amyloid A (AA) amyloidosis.
It is characterized by extracellular tissue deposition of fragments of an acute
phase reactant protein, serum amyloid A.
Epidemiology

• AL amyloidosis is more common in developed countries and AA amyloiodosis
is more common in second and third world countries.

• The increased incidence of AA amyloid in developing countries is thought to
be secondary to a higher burden of chronic infections promoting long-standing
inflammation.
Pathophysiology

• Except for in Alzheimer’s disease, where direct cell cytotoxicity from amyloid
is observed, other systemic manifestations and organ dysfunction from
amyloidosis are thought to be secondary to mechanical disruption by the
plaques.

• Primary amyloid is a clonal plasma cell proliferative disorder that results in
monoclonal light chain fibril deposition in multiple organs. Seventy-five
percent are derived from the λ light chain variable region and the remaining
25% are derived from the κ light chain variable region.

• Secondary amyloid is characterized by extracellular tissue deposition of
fragments of an acute phase reactant protein, serum amyloid A.

• Hemodialysis related amyloidosis is a result of β-2-microglobulin deposition.
540

Risk Factors

• Primary amyloid: blood cell dyscrasias including MGUS, MM, WM, and nonHodgkin’s lymphoma.

• Secondary amyloid: chronic inflammatory states including infection,
inflammatory disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Susceptibility to developing
the amyloidosis relies on genetic and environmental factors.

• Hereditary amyloid:
Most familial mutations are autosomal dominant missense mutations that alter
the precursor proteins.
Almost all hereditary mutations cause kidney, nervous system, and cardiac
disease.
A significantly higher prevalence of these diseases is seen in patients of
Turkish decent.
Associated Conditions

• Primary amyloid is often associated with plasma cell dyscrasias. Most
classically, MM. (11;14)(q13;32) translocation is frequently found in MM or
MGUS patients.

• Secondary amyloid is associated with systemic inflammatory conditions.
Chronic Infections: tuberculosis, osteomyelitis, and leprosy.
Autoimmune: rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing
spondylitis, familial Mediterranean fever (FMF), psoriatic arthritis, and
Sjögren’s syndrome.
It is less commonly seen as a complication of non-Hodgkins lymphoma,
Castleman’s disease, intravenous drug abuse, systemic lupus erythematosus,
and renal failure requiring chronic dialysis.
DIAGNOSIS
Amyloidosis may often be able to be diagnosed in the appropriate clinical setting,
but definitive diagnosis requires tissue biopsy.
Clinical Presentation
541

• Primary amyloid most classically present with nephrotic range proteinuria
(from deposition of protein in the glomerulus), edema, hepatosplenomegaly,
right-sided heart failure, and carpal tunnel syndrome.
Central nervous system (CNS) disease is almost never seen, but peripheral
nervous system involvement manifested by autonomic instability may occur.
Cardiac involvement is insidious and often advanced at the time of
diagnoses. It may result in dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy.
The most common gastrointestinal (GI) manifestations are stomach and
small intestinal bleeding from ulcers, polyps, or hematomas, and motility
disorders such as dysphagia, gastroparesis, constipation, or pseudoobstruction.

• Secondary amyloid most classically presents with nephrotic range proteinuria,
signs of heart failure, and peripheral neuropathy.

• Hemodialysis related amyloid (AB2M) most commonly presents with
musculoskeletal complaints such as shoulder pain, tendonitis, and nerve
entrapment syndromes. Less commonly it may present with GI predominant
symptoms.

• Amyloid arthropathy is most commonly seen in patients with primary
amyloidosis and usually does not occur in patients with inflammatory arthritis.
Massive infiltration of amyloid into the periarticular structures is rare
(shoulder pad sign, macroglossia, and hip stiffness) and seen in <2% of cases.
History
The clinical presentation is highly variable, depending on the systems involved.
Symptoms may include:

• Constitutional symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, early satiety, or
halitosis.

• Hematemesis, melena, or bloody stool.
• Shortness of breath, hoarseness, sinus congestion.
• Lower extremity edema (signifying renal or cardiac involvement).
• Increased abdominal girth (signifying renal, cardiac, or hepatic involvement).
• Stiffness and pain with active range of motion about the shoulders and hips.
• Enlarged muscles, especially the deltoids or tongue.
542

•

Symmetrical arthritis with disease concentrated at the wrists,
metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints,
thus mimicking rheumatoid arthritis.

• Neurologic manifestations including decreased fine touch sensation and nerve
entrapment syndromes, most classically carpal tunnel syndrome.

• Cutaneous manifestations including waxy skin papules and easy bruising.
• Impaired cognition.
• Hypotension with standing due to autonomic dysfunction.
Physical Examination
Similarly, the physical findings vary with the organ system involved, and may
include:

• Physical signs of rapid weight loss.
• Macroglossia with or without waxy papules, dry mouth, papules in the sinus,
trachea, or larynx and secondary dysfunction.

• Abnormal heart rate or rhythm, S3, elevated jugular venous distention (JVD) or
holosystolic murmur (tricuspid or mitral regurgitation).

• Crackles or decreased breath sounds at the lung bases.
• Increased abdominal girth, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and signs of ascites.
TABLE 46-1 DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR PRIMARY SYSTEMIC
AMYLOIDOSIS

543

• Enlarged soft tissue structure about the rotator cuff (shoulder pad sign); this is
essentially pathognomonic for primary amyloidosis and is most commonly seen
with IgG κ deposition.

• Diffuse lymphadenopathy.
• Decreased peripheral sensation, with or without focal weakness.
• Waxy papules most commonly located on the face, neck, groin, armpits,
perianal area, tongue, external auditory canals; hair loss.

• Signs of cognitive dysfunction.
Diagnostic Criteria

• Primary amyloidosis should be suspected when classic history and physical
examination findings occur along with typical organ involvement in the setting
of a serum or urine monoclonal protein or free light chains (FLC).1

• Diagnostic criteria for systemic AL amyloidosis are presented in Table 46-1.2
• Secondary amyloidosis: Biopsy staining positive by immunohistochemical and
immunoelectron microscopy with anti-AA serum, and absence of AL amyloid.
Laboratory testing is of no confirmatory utility but is useful in ruling out AL
amyloid and related disorders. Eighty percent of patients have renal disease.

• Amyloid arthropathy: Definitive diagnosis is by observing the presence of
amyloid in synovial fluid or synovial membrane biopsy.

• Cardiac amyloid: Definitive diagnosis is by myocardial biopsy or the presence
544

of amyloid on extracardiac tissue biopsy in a patient with appropriate other
cardiac findings.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Primary amyloidosis:
Immunofixation will identify 90% of patients.
Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) will reveal a monoclonal
paraprotein (M protein).
Urine protein electrophoresis (UPEP) will reveal monoclonal light
chains.
Serum free light chain anaylsis may identify monoclonal FLC in patients
who fail to have a positive SPEP or UPEP.1

• Secondary amyloidosis:
No specific serum or urine laboratory testing will reveal the diagnosis.
Electrocardiography
Changes seen in patients with cardiac amyloidosis:

• Most common abnormality is decreased voltage in limb leads.
• Conduction abnormalities (e.g., first-, second-, or third-degree heart block),
nonspecific intraventricular conduction delay, atrial fibrillation or flutter,
ventricular tachycardia, or pseudoinfarct patterns.3
Imaging

• Radiography in amyloid arthropathy:
Radiographic evidence of disease always precedes symptoms.
Preservation or widening of joint space with no periarticular or cartilage
erosions, bone cysts. Amyloid bone erosions are classically extra-articular.4
Soft tissue swelling and bone demineralization.
Lytic lesions may be seen if arthropathy is associated with MM.

• Transthoracic echocardiography:
Amyloid infiltration into the myocardium causes increased echogenicity
545

resulting in a “granular sparkling” appearance to myocardium under
echocardiography.
Left ventricular wall thickening with diastolic dysfunction is the most
commonly observed abnormality. With advanced disease restrictive
cardiomyopahty may be seen with a normal to small left ventricle and
biatrial enlargement, right ventricular dilation, and mitral and aortic valve
thickening may also occur.
Intracardiac thrombus is most commonly seen in the atria and may be a
complication of disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

• Tissue biopsy is required for diagnosis of primary or secondary amyloidosis
and amyloid arthropathy.

• Kidney and liver biopsy will be positive in about 90% of patients but is
invasive and, therefore, not recommended as first line.

• Abdominal fat pad biopsy has a relatively high sensitivity (up to 80%) and
specificity (up to 99%) for identifying primary and secondary amyloidosis in
patients with multiorgan involvement.

• If the above sites are negative and the diagnosis is still in question, a rectal,
bone marrow, or skin biopsy may be considered.

• Amyloid fibers stained with Congo red and will produce green birefringence
under polarized light. Fibers stained with thioflavin T will produce yellow–
green fluorescence.

• Immunohistochemical staining and immunofluorescence microscopy will
reveal κ or λ light chains in primary amyloidosis.

• Amino acid sequencing and mass spectroscopy are useful but only available in
research labs.

• Scintigraphy with radioisotope labeling of SAP component has a high
sensitivity for determining the distribution and amyloid burden in patients with
primary and secondary disease. SAP is derived from donor blood and,
therefore, carries infectious risks and does not reliably identify cardiac
involvement.5
TREATMENT
546

Regardless of the type of amyloid, the goal of treatment is to decrease fibril
production and extracellular deposition.
Medications
First Line

• Primary amyloidosis:
Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is a possibility and a few
patients may have complete remission of disease. Decision making regarding
this therapy is complex.2
In patients who are not candidates for HCT, melphalan and steroid is used.
Complete remission is very uncommon as bone marrow toxicity of melphalan
often limits control of the plasma cell dyscrasia.

• Secondary amyloidosis:
Control of the primary inflammatory disease to stabilize and possibly
reduce amyloid burden. Depending on the inflammatory disease, this may be
done with immunosuppressive, cytotoxic, or biologic medications. For
infectious etiologies, antibiotics, and removal of infected tissue are helpful.
Colchicine is commonly used in FMF and has shown success. However, use
of colchicine for amyloidosis secondary to other etiologies is questionable.6
Second Line

• Primary amyloidosis:
In patients who fail melphalan and prednisone or HCT, thalidomide alone or
in combination with cyclophosphamide may be used.7

• Secondary amyloidosis:
Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may be effective in patients with chronic
inflammatory states; however, literature and experience for this indication is
limited.8
Multiple cytotoxic and immunosuppressive agents have been tried for
treatment of AA amyloid. Results are mixed and each case is unique.
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies
Physical therapy and occupational therapy are useful in amyloid arthropathy
547

Surgical Management

• Organ transplantation for failure or complications (kidney, heart, liver).
• Surgical debridement of infected tissue.
• Surgical resection of enlarged tissue (e.g., tongue).
• Carpal tunnel and other peripheral neuropathy releases.
• Joint replacement.
PATIENT EDUCATION
Amyloidosis Foundation (www.amyloidosis.org).
OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS

• Survival in primary amyloidosis may be months or years depending on organs
affected, bone marrow involvement, and circulating plasma cell percentage.9
Main causes of death are cardiac dysfunction, infection, and hepatic
failure.
Primary amyloidosis is often diagnosed after identification of the blood cell
dyscrasia. Progression to MM after the diagnosis of primary amyloidosis is
rare.

• If untreated, secondary amyloidosis may lead to cardiac or renal failure,
infection, or bowel perforation.

Miscellaneous Skin Conditions
Reeti Joshi, Zarmeena Ali, and
Leslie E. Kahl
skin is often the target organ for autoimmune diseases, and sometimes the first
T heclinical
clues to the diagnosis or a systemic inflammatory disorder are found in
the dermatological exam.
PALPABLE PURPURA

• Palpable purpura is defined as nonblanching, violaceous discoloration of skin
due to extravasated red blood cells (RBCs) in the dermis, representing
leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Smaller lesions are called petechiae and larger
ones are called ecchymoses.

• Associated clinical features are related to the underlying cause.
• Histopathology shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In Henoch–Schönlein
purpura (HSP) immunofluorescence reveals IgA deposits in the dermis.

• The differential diagnosis includes:
Infections: infective endocarditis, septic emboli, Neisseria infections,
Rickettsia infections (e.g., rocky mountain spotted fever, typhus), acute viral
infections (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C, herpes simplex virus [HSV], and
Epstein–Barr virus [EBV]).
Small vessel cutaneous vasculitis (see Chapter 20).
Neoplasia (e.g., myeloma, leukemia, lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome).

• Treatment is management of the underlying cause of disease.
ERYTHEMA NODOSUM

• Clinical features of erythema nodosum (EN) are cutaneous nodules that vary
in size from 1 to 10 cm and usually appear acutely over the anterior aspect of
the legs and, less commonly, on the thighs and forearms. The nodules are
550

usually tender and may be surrounded by erythema and bruising. The lesions
of EN may resolve spontaneously in weeks or become chronic.

• Associated causes:
Infections (e.g., Streptococcus, M. tuberculosis, histoplasmosis).
Medications (e.g., sulfonamides, penicillin, oral contraceptives).
Sarcoidosis (Löfgren’s syndrome is the triad of bilateral hilar
lymphadenopathy, EN, and acute polyarthritis seen in acute sarcoidosis).
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and spondyloarthropathies.
Malignancy.

• Histopathology includes a lobular, septal panniculitis, usually without
vasculitis.

• Treatment includes symptomatic relief with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs). Severe and unresponsive cases may require oral
corticosteroids. Oral potassium iodide may also be useful.1
CHOLESTEROL MICROEMBOLIZATION SYNDROME

• Cholesterol microembolization syndrome (CES), also known as cholesterol
emboli or purple/blue toe syndrome, is caused by embolization of lipid debris
from an ulcerated atherosclerotic plaque, generally from a large artery to
smaller arterioles or end-arteries.

• It may be a complication of interventional arterial procedures, bypass surgery,
intra-aortic balloon pump therapy, thrombolytics, trauma, postcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and warfarin treatment. Time of onset
of embolization varies from hours to days after these events.

• Thrombolytic therapy and anticoagulants may precipitate cholesterol emboli
by dissolving protective thrombi and fibrin deposits coating an atheromatous
plaque, permitting the release of cholesterol. However, a causal relationship
remains uncertain.2

• Clinical features include symptoms related to ischemia of organ(s) distal to
the occlusion.
Common sites are lower extremities (toes), intestine, pancreas, central
nervous system (CNS), kidneys, spleen, liver, and bone marrow.
Acute renal failure (ARF), livedo reticularis, limb pain, and good
551

peripheral pulses in unaffected areas are also noted. Both cutaneous and
renal disease may be progressive due to repeated showers of emboli or
secondary vascular inflammation induced by the emboli.
Up to 40% of patients have ARF at onset, as a direct result of preglomerular
emboli to kidney as well as an inflammatory response to the emboli.
Frequently ARF does not resolve and patients who survive often develop
chronic renal failure.

• Laboratory findings include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), Creactive protein (CRP), eosinophilia, urinary eosinophils, proteinuria, and
hyaline and granular casts.

• Histopathology is the gold standard for diagnosis. Routine staining reveals
biconvex, needle-shaped clefts with intimal proliferation and a chronic
inflammatory infiltrate. Frozen or wet formalin-fixed sections reveal doubly
refractile cholesterol crystals. In paraffin-fixed sections, the cholesterol
crystals are dissolved and leave needle-like clefts.

• Differential diagnosis includes small or medium vessel vasculitis,
thromboangiitis obliterans, cocaine-induced ischemia, septic shock, and
gangrene.

• A high threshold of suspicion is needed for making the diagnosis.
• Medical treatment is mainly supportive.
There is no clear consensus on the use of aspirin and other antiplatelet agents,
pentoxifylline, or low molecular weight dextran.
Steroids have a variable rate of response.
Anticoagulation is probably not indicated and in fact may worsen the
outcome.2
Control of hypertension is indicated. Vasodilators may be used, and some
experts advocate use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors for
efferent arteriolar vasodilation. Statins have a theoretical advantage and
reduce the risk of myocardial infarction from CES.2

• Surgical treatment includes amputation or resection of gangrenous tissues to
prevent infection.
Angiographic confirmation of the embolic source is needed prior to removal
of atheromatous lesions by endarterectomy, stenting, or bypass.
Renal arteries should be protected before manipulation proximal to renal
vasculature.
552

• Prognosis remains guarded with significant mortality rates, limb-threatening
consequences, and chronic renal failure.
PYODERMA GANGRENOSUM

• Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is an uncommon, diffuse, neutrophilic dermatitis
undermining the adjacent epidermis around a shallow ulceration.

• Clinical features include onset as an inflammatory nodule or pustule that
ulcerates and enlarges. The ulcers appear necrotic with violaceous,
undermined borders, and may be as large as 20 cm.

• Clinical variants include pustular, bullous, vegetative, peristomal, and druginduced lesions.

• An important characteristic of PG is pathergy. Normal skin of patients with
PG that is subjected to trauma may develop the lesions. Debridement or
biopsy may, therefore, worsen the lesions.

• Associated conditions include IBD, seronegative rheumatoid arthritis (RA),
hematologic malignancies, and pyogenic arthritis with PG and acne (PAPA
syndrome).

• Histopathology may show marked neutrophilic infiltration but may also be
inconclusive.

• Treatment includes management of the associated disorder, which may result
in improvement of the PG.
Oral corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for PG lesions.
Methotrexate, dapsone, and azathioprine have been used as steroid-sparing
agents.
Secondary infection must be treated if present.
Newer treatment modalities include:
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- αinhibitors (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab,
efalizumab), particularly in patients with Crohn’s disease.3
Alefacept, which reduces T-cell activation, has been successful in
reducing severity in a pilot study.4

• Topical tacrolimus has been used as an off-label treatment for localized,
idiopathic PG of recent onset with negative microbiological results.5
553

SWEET’S SYNDROME

• Sweet’s syndrome is a rare type of neutrophilic dermatosis that may be
associated with many different diseases.

• Clinical features include tender red or purple papules or nodules with
sharply demarcated borders, which appear most commonly over the upper
extremities, face, and neck.

• The lesions may mimic EN when they appear on the lower extremities.
• Cutaneous manifestations are usually accompanied by fever and leukocytosis.
• Arthralgias, arthritis, CNS, and renal involvement sometimes occur.
• Associated disorders may include malignancy (especially acute myelogenous
leukemia), bacterial and viral infections, IBD, certain medications (e.g.,
furosemide, oral contraceptives, trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole, minocycline,
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor), RA, sarcoidosis, Behçet’s syndrome,
and pregnancy.

• Histopathology shows a dense neutrophilic infiltrate without evidence of
leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

• Treatment with prednisone at doses of up to 60 mg PO daily provides prompt
relief of cutaneous and systemic manifestations.
Dapsone has been also been used to treat Sweet’s syndrome.
Treatment of underlying condition is essential.
CALCIPHYLAXIS

• Calciphylaxis is a rare disease causing deposition of calcium in the media of
arterioles, leading to ischemia and subcutaneous necrosis.

• The pathogenesis of this disorder is poorly understood.
• Associated conditions include:
Endocrine: primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism, diabetes, obesity,
and excess vitamin D.
Renal: uremia, calcium–phosphate product >70 mg2/dL2, serum aluminum
>25 ng/mL.6
Autoimmune: RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), sarcoidosis,
554

Sjögren’s syndrome, Crohn’s disease, and antiphospholipid syndrome.
Other conditions: paraneoplastic, deficiency of protein C or S, alcoholic
liver disease.

• Clinical features include painful ischemic plaque-like lesions which can
ulcerate and progress to necrosis or eschar formation, typically lower
limbs and areas of adiposity such as the trunk, gluteal regions, and thighs.
Other complications include mesenteric ischemia and gastrointestinal (GI)
hemorrhage, and ischemic myopathy.

• The clinical diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Histopathology shows arterial
medial calcification, subintimal fibrosis, and arterial occlusion without
vasculitis. Acute and chronic calcifying septal panniculitis may also be seen.
Biopsies are complicated by profuse bleeding and secondary infection is
common.

• The differential diagnosis is broad and includes:
Vasculitis: Wegener’s granulomatosis, pancreatic panniculitis, polyarteritis
nodosa (PAN), hypersensitivity vasculitis, bullous SLE.
Vasculitis mimics: cholesterol emboli syndrome, cryoglobulinemia, PG,
livedoid vasculopathy, warfarin skin necrosis, antiphospholipid syndrome,
deficiency of protein C or S.
Infections: cellulitis, necrotizing fasciitis, brown recluse spider bite, Vibrio
vulnificus infection, endocarditis, fungal, and atypical mycobacterial
infections.

• Treatment includes removing factors that contribute to the development of the
disorder, and supportive care. Options include:
Provide wound care and pain control.
Elimination of triggers if possible by discontinuing calcium
supplementation, vitamin D supplementation, and parenteral iron therapy.
Correction of metabolic abnormalities, particularly plasma calcium and
phosphorous concentrations, with dietary alterations, use of noncalcium,
nonaluminum binders, and low-calcium bath dialysis.
Sodium thiosulfate has shown benefit in some patients, usually at a dose of
25 g after each dialysis.7
Some benefit may be achieved with increasing the frequency or duration of
dialysis sessions.
555

Calcimimetics such as cinacalcet hydrochloride may be beneficial by
controlling secondary hyperparathyroidism.8
Parathyroidectomy can be considered in hyperparathyroid patients if
conservative management fails. However, a meaningful affect on survival is
uncertain.
Judicious use of antibiotics and hyperbaric oxygen may be advantageous.9
Bisphosphonates increase osteoprotegerin production and inhibit arterial
calcification. Several case reports suggest they may be useful in treating this
disorder.10
Early use of systemic glucocorticoids may be helpful, unless ulcerated
lesions are present, but this approach is controversial.11
Anticoagulation is beneficial if there is an underlying hypercoaguable
state.12
ERYTHROMELALGIA

• Erythromelalgia (EM) is a rare condition characterized by red hot painful
burning feet, less commonly hands, accompanied by erythema, pallor, or
cyanosis, in the presence of palpable pulses.

• The diagnosis is a clinical one. One useful finding is that patients generally
seek relief by placing the affected extremities in ice water.

• EM is considered by some to be the opposite of Raynaud’s phenomenon.
• The pathogenesis of EM is not well understood.
• As a primary disorder, it can be the result of a disease-specific novel mutation
causing sodium channelopathy in nociceptive fibers.

• Conditions associated with in secondary EM include:
Myeloproliferative disorders: polycythemia, essential thrombocythemia,
pernicious anemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.
Drug-induced: cyclosporine, calcium channel blockers, norepinephrine, and
influenza vaccine.
Infections: HIV, hepatitis B, and EBV.
Other conditions: SLE, RA, diabetic neuropathy, and multiple sclerosis.

• Treatment is mainly supportive and includes:
556

Avoidance of triggers that induce vasodilation, such as strenuous exercises,
warm climate, or hot baths.
Wearing open toed shoes, no socks, keeping a fan by the feet.
Although there are no controlled trials, medications which may be useful in
individual patients include gabapentin, venlafaxine, diltiazem, sertraline,
amitriptyline, imipramine, paroxetine, fluoxetine, and diphenhydramine.
Additionally, medications that effect voltage-gated sodium channel such as
lidocaine and mexiletine show promise.13
Treatment of underlying disease.
COCAINE AND LEVAMISOLE-INDUCED VASCULOPATHY

• Cocaine has historically been associated with cardiovascular morbidities due
to its vasoconstrictive and platelet activating properties but it has also been
implicated in a variety of dermatologic conditions.

• The pathogenesis of these dermatologic lesions is unknown but is likely
related to levamisole, a veterinary antihelminthic that has been used to cut the
cocaine. Levamisole, a known immunomodulator, has been associated with
neutropenia and the development of antibodies, including antinuclear
antibodies (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), lupus
anticoagulant, and anticardiolipin antibodies.14

• The clinical features associated with cocaine and levamisole include nonspecific and lichenoid eruptions, a fixed drug eruption, and a very distinctive
cutaneous vasculopathy. Purpura of the ears and cheeks is the most
characteristic finding but ischemic lesions can appear anywhere on the limbs
or body.

• Histopathology demonstrates a range of reactions including leukocytoclastic
vasculitis, a thrombotic vasculitis and, most commonly, bland vascular
occlusive disease without a true vasculitis.14

• Treatment includes abstinence from levamisole-tainted cocaine. The role of
steroids and anticoagulation is yet to be determined.

Osteoporosis
Ashwini Komarla, Richa Gupta, and
Zarmeena Ali
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition

• Osteoporosis is the most common metabolic disorder in the United States
and is generally asymptomatic until complications develop.

• The National Institutes of Health (NIH) 2000 consensus panel describes
osteoporosis as a “skeletal disorder characterized by compromised bone
strength predisposing a person to an increased risk of fracture.”1

• The World Health Organization (WHO) defines osteoporosis as a bone density
of 2.5 SD or more below the mean for young healthy white women.2
Classification

• Osteoporosis can be classified as primary or secondary on the basis of
causality.

• In primary osteoporosis, the deterioration of bone mass is related to aging or
decreased gonadal function. It is typically seen in postmenopausal women and
older men, usually over age 70.

• Secondary osteoporosis results from chronic conditions or medications, like
corticosteroids, that accelerate bone loss.
Epidemiology

• Osteoporosis affects an estimated 10 million people, and an additional 34
million people have low bone mineral density (BMD). Approximately, 1.5
million osteoporosis-related fractures occur each year in the United States.
Direct medical costs for these fractures exceed 18 billion dollars.1,2

• White postmenopausal women are most at risk for osteoporosis and
559

related fractures. This population suffers three-fourths of all hip fractures.
Men and black women have lower hip fracture rates, as do Hispanic women
and Native Americans. Asians have lower bone mineral densities, but fewer
fractures than the white population.

• A 50-year-old white woman has an approximate 50% risk of experiencing an
osteoporotic fracture during her lifetime, while a 50-year-old man has an
approximate 13% risk.1

• Osteoporosis is a common comorbidity in patients with rheumatologic
diseases because of the increased use of corticosteroids, decreased physical
activity, systemic inflammation, and alteration of the normal balance of bone
resorption/formation.
Pathophysiology

• Osteoporosis is characterized by either low bone density or poor bone
quality.
Bone quality is determined by architecture, turnover, damage, and
mineralization.
BMD is determined by peak bone mass and the amount of bone lost over
time.

• Loss of bone mass occurs during remodeling of bone when resorption, a result
of osteoclast activity, occurs more quickly than bone formation, a consequence
of osteoblast activity.
Crucial regulators of osteoclastic bone resorption include RANK ligand
(RANKL; a member of the tumor necrosis factor [TNF] ligand family), and
its two receptors, RANK and osteoprotegerin (OPG).
RANK ligand is expressed by osteoblasts. It interacts with its corresponding
receptor, RANK, which is expressed by osteoclasts.
This interaction promotes osteoclast differentiation, activation, and
prolonged survival.
OPG, which is secreted by osteoblasts and stromal cells, blocks the
interaction of RANK ligand with RANK, thereby regulating bone turnover
(see Fig. 48-1).

• After age 40, cortical bone is lost at a rate of 0.3% to 0.5% per year.
Trabecular bone loss may begin at an even younger age. This loss of cortical
560

and trabecular bone accelerates after menopause, as estrogen deficiency
results in increased bone turnover and a remodeling imbalance.
The enhanced activity and function of osteoclasts during this period appears
to be due to the increased expression of osteoclastogenic proinflammatory
cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1 and TNF, which are negatively regulated
by estrogen.

• Histologically, the bone has decreased cortical thickness and a decreased
number and size of trabeculae.
Although trabecular or cancellous bone found mainly in the axial skeleton
compromises only 20% of bone, and cortical bone found primarily in the
diaphyses of long bones compromises 80% of bone, trabecular bone is the
site of the greatest bone turnover as a result of its greater surface area.
Thus, it is more susceptible to imbalances in remodeling and more frequently
associated with osteoporotic fractures.
FIGURE 48-1. Pathophysiology of osteoporosis.

The most frequent sites of osteoporotic fractures are the spine, hip, and
distal radius.
Risk Factors

• Low BMD correlates with an increased risk of primary osteoporosis.
561

Predictors of low BMD include female gender, increased age, estrogen
deficiency, white or Asian race, low weight and body mass index, family
history of osteoporosis, smoking, history of fracture, late menarche, and early
menopause.

• Secondary causes of osteoporosis are extensive.
They involve diseases of hormone dysregulation including Cushing’s
syndrome,
primary or
secondary amenorrhea,
hypogonadism,
hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus type I, and hyperparathyroidism.
Malnutrition, malabsorption syndromes, pernicious anemia, parenteral
nutrition, and gastrectomy are predisposing factors.
Severe liver and renal diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
hemochromatosis, and mastocytosis also place patients at a higher risk for
osteoporosis.
Rheumatologic diseases that predispose to osteoporosis include
amyloidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), ankylosing spondylitis,
rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and sarcoidosis.
Certain drugs and toxins (e.g., corticosteroids, anticonvulsants, heparin,
lithium, thyroxine, cytotoxic drugs, ethanol use, and tobacco) have also been
implicated.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Osteoporosis is commonly asymptomatic until fractures occur.
• Vertebral compression fractures most commonly occur in the T-11 to L-2
region and may present as loss of height rather than back pain.

• Other common fracture sites are the distal wrist (Colles’ fracture), hip, and
pelvis.

• Physical examination may reveal tenderness along the spine, scoliosis,
kyphosis, or dowager’s hump.

• Signs and symptoms of secondary causes can be elicited during the history and
physical examination (e.g., hypogonadism, evidence of thyroid disease, and
cushingoid features).

562

Diagnostic Criteria

• In general, women who present with fragility fractures in the absence of
trauma should be screened. The American College of Rheumatology and
National Osteoporosis Foundation recommend screening all women over age
65 and men over age 70, along with any adult with a condition or taking
medication associated low bone mass or bone loss.

• Assessment of BMD is the standard of care in diagnosis and evaluation of
adults for osteoporosis. Measuring BMD at any skeletal site has value in
predicting fracture risk. Hip BMD, however, is the best predictor of hip
fractures and is also good at predicting fractures at other sites. BMD is
expressed as two values:
Z score: Comparison with the expected BMD for the patient’s age and sex.
T score: Comparison with the average peak BMD for young healthy white
adults of the same gender.

• The T score is more helpful in assessing fracture risk as most studies use it.
The difference between the patient’s BMD and the norm is expressed as SD
above or below the mean. With central dual energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DEXA) BMD testing, a change in T or Z score of 1 SD roughly corresponds
to a 10% change in BMD.

• The WHO defines four diagnostic categories based on T score.2
Normal: BMD within 1 SD of the reference mean (T ≥ −1.0).
Osteopenia: BMD between 1 and 2.5 SDs below the reference mean (−2.5 <
T < −1.0).
Osteoporosis: BMD 2.5 SDs or more below the reference mean (T ≤ −2.5).
Established or severe osteoporosis: BMD over 2.5 SDs below the
reference mean (T ≤ −2.5) and the presence of one or more fragility
fractures.

• BMD is an excellent predictor of fracture risk but when it is combined with
clinical risk factors, it is a better predictor than either alone. The Fracture
Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) estimates the 10-year probability of fracture
on the basis of clinical risk factors and BMD at the femoral neck. FRAX is an
electronic clinical tool (www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) and is only helpful in making
treatment decisions in patients with osteopenia.

563

Differential Diagnosis
The differential diagnosis of osteoporosis includes osteomalacia, metastatic
malignancy to bone, multiple myeloma, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, renal
osteodystrophy, malabsorption syndromes, vitamin deficiencies, and Paget’s
disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Limited laboratory testing as suggested by history and physical examination
(e.g., serum and urine calcium, serum phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase,
thyroid hormone levels, serum protein electrophoresis, parathyroid hormones
[PTHs], vitamin D level, serum testosterone in men, cortisol, and renal and
liver functions) can be helpful in diagnosing secondary causes.

• Markers of bone turnover are not useful in making the diagnosis of
osteoporosis.
Imaging

• Plain radiography can demonstrate osteopenia and vertebral compression
fractures but is a generally unreliable markers of bone mass, as 20% to 50% of
bone must be lost before changes are evident on radiographs.

• BMD testing techniques include DEXA, single energy x-ray absorptiometry,
peripheral DEXA, quantitative CT, and ultrasound densitometry.
Central DEXA is the gold standard and recommended for adults who
have had osteoporotic fractures or who are undergoing general
screening.
DEXA imaging results in a low level of radiation exposure (one-tenth of a
traditional radiograph) and has excellent reproducibility and precision.
Bone density testing should be obtained at both the spine and the hip. In
women younger than 65 years, spine imaging may be more helpful, as
bone is apt to be lost more rapidly in the spine, and vertebral fractures are
the most common fracture in this age group. In women older than 65 years,
bone density at the hip is more clinically useful as hip fractures are more
of a concern and the spine bone density has a higher chance of false
elevations due to vascular calcifications or osteoarthritis of the spine.
DEXA can also be used to measure the wrist, but measurements at that site
564

are of limited clinical significance due to lower predictive values and less
reproducibility.
Quantitative CT has a similar ability to predict fractures as central DEXA.
Quantitative CT is less affected by superimposed osteoarthritis. However,
quantitative CT scans are more expensive and require a larger dose of
radiation, so clinically they are not so frequently used.
Peripheral bone density performed with either DEXA or single energy x-ray
absorptiometry can measure forearm, finger, or heel BMD, while peripheral
ultrasonography most commonly measures bone mass of the heel. The
advantages of peripheral bone density testing and ultrasonography are the
portability and the ability of these tests to be performed in primary care
offices. However, there are not universally agreed upon diagnostic criteria
for the different machines available. In addition, the precision of the
machines does not allow for their use in monitoring response to therapy.
Peripheral testing has not been endorsed for use in the diagnosis of
osteoporosis, but if it is performed, abnormal results should be followed up
with central DEXA to establish or confirm the diagnosis.
TREATMENT

• The National Osteoporosis Foundation has issued clinical practice guidelines
for treating osteoporosis and addresses postmenopausal women and men over
the age of 50 years for all ethnic groups in the United States. It is intended for
use by clinicians in making decisions in the care of individual patients.

• The main goal in treatment of osteoporosis is the prevention of fractures.
On average, risk of fracture approximately doubles for each 1 SD decrease in
T score. The following are indications to initiate specific therapy for
osteoporosis. It is important to be aware that the prospective randomized
controlled pharmacologic trials for the treatment of osteoporosis have taken
place mainly in the population of white women, so limited data are available
on therapeutic benefit of pharmacologic agents in men or minority groups.
All adults with osteoporotic fractures of the hip or spine.
Adults with a T score ≤ −2 SD who do not have specific risk factors for
osteoporosis.
Adults with a T score ≤ −1.5 SD who have risk factors for osteoporosis.
Women >70 years with multiple risk factors are at high enough risk to begin
treatment without BMD testing.
565

• Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D is recommended for all patients.
Daily intake of elemental calcium should be at least 1200 mg. Calcium
supplements are mostly available as calcium carbonate or calcium citrate.
Foods rich in calcium include dairy products, sardines, and fortified juices.
All adults should receive at least 800 to 1000 IU of vitamin D per day.
Foods rich in vitamin D include fortified milk and cereals, egg yolks, and
liver.

• Regular weight-bearing exercise is also recommended for all patients.
• Fall prevention: Most osteoporotic fractures involve falling or low-impact
trauma. Patients should be assessed for reversible causes of falls like
overmedication, neurologic or vision problems, and poor footwear.

• Avoidance of tobacco use and excessive alcohol intake should be encouraged.
• Other factors that have been suggested to negatively impact the risk of
osteoporosis are high intakes of caffeine, protein, and phosphorus.
Medications
First Line

• Bisphosphonates: Alendronate, risedronate, ibandronate, and zoledronic acid
are generally the best agents currently available for treating osteoporosis.

• Bisphosphonates bind avidly to hydroxyapatite crystals in bone and are
resistant to metabolic degradation. They reduce the ability of osteoclasts to
resorb bone and accelerate osteoclast apoptosis.

• Alendronate (5 mg PO daily or 35 mg PO weekly), risedronate (5 mg PO daily
or 35 mg PO weekly), and ibandronate (2.5 mg PO daily) are FDA approved
for use in prevention, whereas alendronate (10 mg PO daily or 70 mg PO
weekly), risedronate (5 mg PO daily or 35 mg PO weekly), and ibandronate
(2.5 mg PO daily or 150 mg PO monthly) are FDA approved for use in
treatment of osteoporosis.

• Randomized clinical trials have shown that the benefit in fracture risk has
lasted up to 4 years. Sustained benefit in BMD has lasted up to 10 years with
alendronate and 7 years with risedronate.

• In clinical practice, esophageal and gastric side effects are the most
commonly reported and are reduced with weekly or monthly dosing
preparations.
566

• Zoledronic acid is a parenterally administered bisphosphonate dosed annually.
Ibandronate is also available for parenteral administration every 3 months and
is another alternative for patients who cannot tolerate oral bisphosphonates.
Intravenous administration of bisphosphonates can cause an acute phase
response type of reaction with symptoms like fever and myalgias.

• Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been recognized as a complication of nitrogen
containing bisphosphonate therapy. Most cases have been associated with the
use of intravenous bisphosphonates in patients with metastatic bone disease.

• Atypical femur fractures of the subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral
shaft that occur with minimal or no trauma have been reported in the setting of
long-term use of bisphosphonates. Epidemiologic studies have suggested that
these atypical fractures are reduced by increased adherence to bisphosphonate
therapy and are more likely to be caused by osteoporosis than by
bisphosphonates. The incidence of atypical fractures associated with
bisphosphonates is very low, but the new onset of groin or mid-thigh pain in
patients taking bisphosphonates for more than 5 to 10 years should require
further evaluation.3

• Long-term data with alendronate and risedronate have demonstrated efficacy
and safety for 10 and 7 years, respectively.

• Stopping therapy after 5 years or a “drug holiday” of a year or two may be
reasonable, as there appears to be residual BMD and fracture benefit.
Second Line

• Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that exhibits
proestrogen effects on some tissues and antiestrogen effects on other tissues. It
has been shown in trials to decrease the rate of new vertebral fractures by 40%
to 50% and improve BMD at the spine and hip. It has not been found to have a
significant effect on hip or total nonvertebral fractures. The ideal candidate for
raloxifene is a woman who cannot tolerate a bisphosphonate. Typical dose is
60 mg PO daily. On raloxifene, there is an increased risk of stroke or deep
vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Other SERMs undergoing clinical
trials include bazedoxifene and lasofoxifene.

• Calcitonin is an endogenous peptide that enhances BMD by inhibiting
osteoclast activity. It is available in both subcutaneous and intranasal forms. Its
beneficial effects on the BMD of the spine are less than with other agents. Of
note, intranasal calcitonin has been found to be beneficial in treating the pain
567

of acute vertebral compression fractures.

• Teriparatide is a recombinant formation of the active 34 N-terminal peptide
portion of PTH.
Although continuous exposure to PTH, as in patients with primary
hyperparathyroidism, leads to increased bone resorption, intermittent
exposure has been shown to stimulate bone formation.
Teriparatide is the first anabolic pharmacologic agent and increases bone
formation by stimulating osteoblast activity. It is administered by daily
subcutaneous injections for up to 2 years.
The BMD improvement seen with teriparatide is greater than other
available agents for osteoporosis.
Due to the significant cost, teriparatide should be reserved for patients with
severe or established osteoporosis who cannot take or have unsuccessful
results with bisphosphonates. It is contraindicated in patients with
preexisting hypercalcemia, metastatic bone disease, and those at increased
risk for osteosarcoma, such as patients with Paget’s disease, prior radiation
treatment to bone, and children.

• Denosumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds
RANKL and blocks the binding of RANKL to RANK. It thereby reduces the
formation, function, and survival of osteoclasts, resulting in decreased bone
resorption, increased bone density, and decreased fractures. 4 It is administered
as 60 mg subcutaneously every 6 months. Potential adverse effects include
hypocalcemia, skin reactions, osteonecrosis of the jaw, and suppression of the
immune system, possibly predisposing patients to infections and neoplasms.

• Strontium ranelate is a new agent recently approved in Europe but not
approved by the FDA. It increases calcium uptake and bone formation, as well
as inhibiting bone resorption.5

• Hormone replacement therapy has been shown to prevent bone loss but it is
not used in the treatment of osteoporosis because of an unfavorable balance of
benefits and risks, like coronary heart disease and thromboembolic events.

• Combination therapy with two antiresorptive medicines has not demonstrated
a reduction in the fracture risk above what would be found with a single agent.
Starting a bisphosphonate after completing 2 years of treatment with
teriparatide makes theoretical sense and a recent study found that BMD
improvements with 1 year of teriparatide were maintained or improved with
subsequent alendronate but lost if therapy was not followed by a
568

bisphosphonate. This sequence is possibly the best combination but more
studies are needed to validate this.6
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

• Glucocorticoid therapy causes bone loss through a number of different
mechanisms, including impaired intestinal calcium absorption, increased
urinary calcium excretion, decreased bone formation, increased bone
resorption through the stimulation of osteoclast activity by macrophage colonystimulating factor, and suppression of endogenous gonadal steroid production.

• Therapy with glucocorticoids leads to an early and sometimes dramatic loss of
trabecular bone with less effect on cortical bone.

• Glucocorticoid use is the most common form of drug-related osteoporosis
and is often seen in patients with rheumatic diseases.
Glucocorticoids should be prescribed at the lowest effective dose for the
shortest duration possible.
Patients who receive glucocorticoids (e.g., prednisone at >5 mg PO/day) for
>2 months are considered at high risk for excessive bone loss but there has
been some controversy regarding the dose at which an increased risk of
fracture occurs.
To diagnose and prevent glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, obtain a
baseline assessment of BMD of the hip or spine before initiating any
long-term (>3 months) therapy.

• For steroid-induced osteoporosis, randomized controlled studies demonstrate
calcium carbonate, 1000 mg PO daily and vitamin D, 500 IU PO daily, to be an
effective preventive therapy for some patients receiving prednisone.

• The American College of Rheumatology published guidelines for the
prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis in 2010.7
Postmenopausal women and men over age 50 with an estimated steroid
course of at least 3 months were stratified into low, medium, and high risk
groups on the basis of T score and age with consideration for other risk
factors.
Low risk patients should be put on a bisphosphonate for a prednisone dose of
≥7.5 mg/day, while medium and high risk groups should be on
bisphosphonates for any dose of steroid.
569

Teriparatide can also be considered for high risk women on steroids for a
long period of time.
For premenopausal women and men less than age 50, the data are inadequate
to make a recommendation. Individual circumstances and childbearing
potential in women need to be considered.
COMPLICATIONS

• Possible consequences of fracture due to osteoporosis are acute and chronic
pain, depression, deconditioning, dependency, and changes in appearance
including loss of height and kyphosis.

• Hip fractures are associated with an up to 20% mortality rate in women and a
30% mortality rate in men within the first year of fracture, most often due to
comorbidities. Twenty percent of patients with hospitalization due to a hip
fracture require nursing home care and fifty percent of survivors are unable to
ambulate independently or have some other permanent disability.
MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP

• Follow-up of patients includes monitoring for complications, side effects, and
response to treatment. Continued assessment for modifiable risk factors and
fall risk is necessary. Height should be followed to screen for asymptomatic
vertebral fractures.

• BMD should be revaluated every 1 to 2 years to assess response to
therapy. Repeat measurements made sooner than that can be difficult to
interpret, as the expected change in BMD over a short period of time may be
similar to the precision of the machine. BMD changes need to be ≥3% to be
considered significant. Repeat measurements need to be made on the same
DEXA machine to allow results to be accurately compared. Patients who are
being screened for osteoporosis but are not on treatment should wait 2 years
before undergoing repeat BMD testing.

• Monitoring with markers of bone turnover is another option. Fasting urinary Ntelopeptide (NTX) or serum carboxy-terminal collagen crosslinks (CTX) can
be measured before and then 3 to 6 months after initiating bisphosphonate or
other antiresorptive therapy. A decrease of greater than 50% in urinary NTX
excretion or 30% in serum CTX provides evidence of compliance and drug
efficacy.8 A decrease in markers of less than this amount may not necessarily
570

indicate treatment failure, and noncompliance or poor absorption should be
considered.

Avascular Necrosis
Richa Gupta, Ashwini Komarla, and
Zarmeena Ali
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
Avascular necrosis (AVN), also known as osteonecrosis and aseptic necrosis,
involves vascular compromise to bone with subsequent bone death and joint
destruction.
Epidemiology

• Incidence is estimated at 15,000 cases annually in the United States, with a
male to female ratio of 8:1.

• It accounts for about 10% of the 500,000 joint replacements performed
annually.

• Most of the patients are <50 years, although AVN can affect persons of any age.
• Various bones can be affected, including the femur (femoral head and
condyles), tibia (tibial plateau), humerus (humeral head), vertebrae, and small
bones of the foot, ankle, and hand. Osteonecrosis of the hip causes the most
severe and debilitating impairments.

• AVN develops bilaterally in more than 80% of cases.
Pathophysiology

• The pathogenesis of AVN is poorly understood. The circulatory compromise
to the bone is thought to occur by one of these mechanisms:1
Mechanical vascular interruption.
Thrombosis or embolism.
Injury to a vessel wall (vasculitis, radiation injury, or spasm).
572

Venous occlusion (blood flow is impeded as venous pressure is greater than
arterial pressure).
Direct bone cell injury.
Intraosseous marrow displacement and increased pressure in the bony
compartment.

• Any of these events may lead to medullary infarction in the fatty marrow,
resulting in bone death with subsequent cell necrosis.

• Initially there is necrosis of the hematopoietic and fatty bone marrow elements.
The necrotic zone remains acellular and cannot be repaired or revascularized.
This ultimately leads to death of the bone and fibrous scar tissue formation.
Risk Factors

• The most common risk factors for developing AVN include oral corticosteroid
use, alcohol abuse, and cigarette smoking. For glucocorticoids, doses of >2
g of prednisone (or its equivalent) within the last 2 to 3 months are considered
to increase the risk of AVN.

• Other risk factors include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), trauma, sepsis, renal failure, sickle cell disease, vasculitis,
Gaucher’s disease, dysbaric conditions (Caisson disease), radiation injury,
chemotherapy, organ transplantation, hypersensitivity reactions, coagulation
factor deficiencies, cancer, pregnancy, and bisphosphonate use in malignant
disease.

• In approximately 15% of patients, the occurrence of AVN may be idiopathic,
where no clear cause is identified.

• Genetic factors have been reported, showing an association between AVN and
certain polymorphisms involving alcohol-metabolizing enzymes and the drug
transport protein P-glycoprotein. Also, a mutation in the type II collagen gene
was identified in three families demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance
of AVN.2
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
History
573

• Patients commonly present with vague and mild joint pain but acute, severe,
deep, throbbing pain presentations are also possible.

• Early in the course of the disease, pain is increased with activity, but over time
it progresses to pain with rest.

• More severe pain can occur with larger infarcts (most often associated with
Gaucher’s disease, dysbarism, and hemoglobinopathies).

• Some patients remain relatively asymptomatic despite advanced radiographic
changes.

• The time course for AVN varies and may range from months to years between
initial symptom onset and the development of end-stage disease with joint
dysfunction.

• AVN usually involves anterolateral femoral head but can also involve
femoral condyles, humeral head, proximal tibia, vertebrae, and small bones of
hand and foot.
Physical Examination

• The physical examination is nonspecific but usually patients will have pain,
mild swelling, and decreased range of motion of the affected joint.

• Large effusions are sometimes seen when the knee is involved.
Differential Diagnosis
Other diagnoses to consider include infection, fractures, tumors, soft tissue injuries,
and exacerbation of existing joint disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories
Laboratory tests are useful only for finding an underlying cause of AVN or excluding
other diseases.
Imaging

• Radiologic evaluation plays a key role in helping make the diagnosis.
Evaluation may begin with plain radiographs, but early in the disease course
these can be normal. Later findings include mild changes in bone density that
574

progress to sclerosis and cyst formation.

• Radiographs may demonstrate a “crescent sign” as a result of subchondral
collapse, indicating biomechanical compromise of the bone.

• Bone scans that are obtained early in the disease demonstrate a dead central
area surrounded by increased activity described as the “doughnut sign.” With
disease progression, the bone scan shows only a uniformly high level of
activity. However, bone scans are not so sensitive as MRI.

• MRI is the most sensitive study available for evaluation of osteonecrosis.
The earliest sign is marrow edema, later followed by marrow necrosis and
cortical bone changes. Classically, the “double-line sign” is seen. This is a
high signal intensity line within two parallel lines of decreased signal intensity
on a T2-weighted MRI image.

• AVN is generally staged by plain radiographs. The staging system is used to
bring uniformity to clinical trials and treatment strategies. The stages of each
system are shown in Table 49-1.3 These staging techniques are based on
disease of the femoral head.
TREATMENT
The goal of therapy is to preserve the native joint for as long as possible.
Medications

• Treatment varies according to site and whether an underlying cause is found.
Cessation of the offending agent may be beneficial.

• Pharmacologic measures are intended to allow revascularization and bone
growth. The most common drugs used are vasodilators, lipid-lowering agents,
prostacyclin analogs, anticoagulants, and bisphosphonates.4
Other Non-Pharmacologic Therapies

• Assisted weight-bearing modalities such as canes or crutches have proven to
be unsuccessful. More than 80% of patients treated with these modalities
progress to femoral head collapse by 4 years after diagnosis.

• Several other treatment modalities are under study including hyperbaric oxygen
treatment, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, and various types of electrical
575

stimulations.
Surgical Management

• Surgical modalities include:
“Core decompression,” which decreases the intramedullary pressure.
Osteotomy, which helps to redistribute forces to healthy bone by moving
necrotic tissues away from the areas which are weight bearing.
Nonvascularized bone grafting.
Vascularized bone grafting (to provide mesenchymal stem cells and vascular
supply to necrotic tissue).
The purpose of bone grafts is to provide structural support to the subchondral
bone and cartilage.

• For advanced cases of AVN, total joint replacement and resurfacing
arthroplasty remains the standard treatment.
TABLE 49-1 RADIOGRAPHIC CLASSIFICATION OF OSTEONECROSIS
OF THE FEMORAL HEAD

576

• Young or active patients should be considered as candidates for the procedures
that delay total joint arthroplasty, such as bone grafts or bone preserving
operations like metal-on-metal resurfacing.
COMPLICATIONS
Complications include incomplete fractures and superimposed degenerative
arthritis.

Hereditary Periodic Fever Syndromes
Hyon Ju Park and John P. Atkinson
• Hereditary periodic fever syndromes are rare diseases characterized by
recurrent episodes of dramatic inflammation arising from mutations of genes
regulating aspects of innate immunity.

• As opposed to autoimmune diseases, there is a lack of high-titer autoantibodies
or self-reactive T cells. As a result, they are considered a subgroup of
autoinflammatory diseases.1

• In most hereditary periodic fever syndromes clinical manifestations usually
start during childhood, but diagnosis is often not made until adulthood.

• The major syndromes are:
Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).
Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor–associated periodic syndrome
(TRAPS).
Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with period fever syndrome (HIDS).
Cryopyrinopathies.

FAMILIAL MEDITERRANEAN FEVER
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
FMF is a recessively inherited disease characterized by recurrent attacks of fever
and serositis.
Epidemiology

• FMF is the most common hereditary periodic fever syndrome.
• FMF is mostly found in people from around the Mediterranean basin (Jewish,
579

Arab, Armenian, Italian, Turkish populations).

• Prevalence of FMF among Sephardic Jews is 100 to 400 per 100,000 but, like
the other period fever syndromes, is highly variant depending on geographical
location.
Pathophysiology

• FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene, with more than 70 mutations
that have been described.

• MEFV encodes the protein pyrin that is involved in regulation of interleukin
(IL)-1βprocessing.

• MEFV is highly expressed in neutrophils, activated monocytes, synovial
fibroblasts, and peritoneal fibroblasts.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• Most patients experience their first clinical episode before the age of 20.
• Patients present with seemingly unprovoked episodes of fever, serositis,
monoarticular arthritis, and rash of 1 to 3 days duration.
Serositis involves peritoneum, pleura, and less commonly, pericardium.
Repeated bouts of serositis can lead to fibrosis and formation of intraabdominal adhesions.
Monoarticular arthritis typically involves the knee, ankle, or hip. Arthritis is
inflammatory but nonerosive.
The characteristic rash described with FMF is erysipeloid erythema, an
erythematous, sharply demarcated, tender, swollen area with a predilection
for the lower extremity.2

• Episodes spontaneously resolve with return to baseline health between febrile
episodes. The time between attacks can range from days to years.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• During attacks, acute phase reactant levels like erythrocyte sedimentation rate
580

(ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), fibrinogen, and serum amyloid A (SAA) are
elevated.

• Genetic testing is not required in patients from high risk groups with typical
symptoms who are responsive to colchicine. However, in atypical patients,
genetic analysis is recommended.
TREATMENT

• Daily colchicine (1.2–1.8 mg/day) is the treatment of choice. Colchicine is
effective in preventing acute attacks and the development of amyloidosis. If
amyloidosis is already present, some recommend titrating colchicine up to
decrease SAA level to 10 mg/L.

• Patients who develop febrile episodes despite daily colchicine therapy may
benefit from TNF antagonist therapy but evidence for such therapy is
anecdotal.
COMPLICATIONS

• The most serious adverse effect of FMF is amyloidosis. Repeated elevated
levels of SAA can lead to amyloid deposition in kidneys, lungs, intestine, and
adrenal glands. Prior to the use of colchicine, renal failure due to amyloidosis
was the leading cause of mortality in FMF patients.

• Risk factors for amyloidosis include a family history of amyloidosis, male
gender, and M694V genotype and the SAA1 alpha/alpha genotype.

HYPERIMMUNOGLOBULINEMIA D WITH PERIODIC
FEVER SYNDROME
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
HIDS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of
fever, rash, abdominal pain, and polyarticular arthritis.

581

Epidemiology

• Exact prevalence of HIDS is unknown but it is rare.
• HIDS has been described primarily in people of Dutch and northern European
origin.
Pathophysiology

• HIDS is caused by mutations in MVK, a gene encoding mevalonate kinase.
Currently, over 50 disease-associated mutations have been described.

• MVK is an enzyme involved in both cholesterol and nonsterol isoprene
biosynthesis.

• Although the exact mechanism of disease is unknown, it is hypothesized that the
overactivity of the innate immune system is due to a deficiency in antiinflammatory isoprenylated products or activation by excess mevalonic
acid.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The first clinical episode occurs during infancy.
• Episodes may occur twice a month during childhood but become less frequent
and severe during adulthood.

• Likely triggers include infections, trauma, menstruation, and vaccinations.
• HIDS episodes often start with headache and chills followed by abdominal
pain, rash, polyarticular arthritis, and often cervical lymphadenopathy.
Abdominal pain with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea is a common complaint.
Unlike FMF, it is not due to peritonitis and etiology of pain is unknown.
A wide of variety of rashes have been described with HIDS and, as a result,
are nonspecific.
Polyarticular arthritis is typically an inflammatory, symmetric arthritis that
involves large joints like the hips and knees.
Although children may get diffuse lymphadenopathy, adults tend to develop
only cervical lymphadenopathy.

582

• Amyloidosis is a rare complication of HIDS.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Like other periodic fever syndromes, acute phase reactants are elevated during
attacks.

• Elevated urinary mevalonic acid levels during attacks are pathognomonic of
HIDS.

• Diagnosis of HIDS can be made on the basis of elevated urinary levels of
mevalonic acid during attacks or in patients with a typical history, a finding of
two mutations in MVK on genetic testing.

• Although elevated serum levels of IgD are seen in 85% to 90% of patients,
levels do not correlate with severity or frequency of attacks.

• Elevated serum levels of IgA are observed in 80% of patients.
TREATMENT

• Treatment is mainly supportive. Colchicine, corticosteroids, and nonsteroidal
antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) fail to abort acute attacks.

• HMG-CoA reductase is an enzyme preceding MVK and, if the excess
mevalonic acid is contributing to the pathogenesis of HIDS, HMG-CoA
reductase inhibitors might be beneficial. A double-blinded randomized
controlled trial of six patients with HIDS treated with simvastatin 80 mg/day
demonstrated a decrease in urinary mevalonic acid in all the six patients along
with significantly fewer febrile days in five of the six patients.3

TNF RECEPTOR–ASSOCIATED PERIODIC SYNDROME
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Definition
TRAPS, previously known as familial Hibernian fever and benign autosomaldominant familial periodic fever, is an autosomal-dominant disease characterized
583

by recurrent episodes of fever, migratory rash, and ocular findings.
Epidemiology

• Prevalence is unknown but is thought to be the second most common hereditary
periodic fever syndrome.

• Although TRAPS was initially described in people of Irish and Scottish
descent, there is no ethnic predilection.
Pathophysiology

• TRAPS is caused by mutations in TNFRSF1A, a gene encoding the p55
receptor for TNF. Currently, over 50 disease causing mutations have been
found.

• Initial studies suggested that pathogenesis occurred by sustained TNF
stimulation of target cells by the impaired shedding of the p55 component.
Recent data suggests that the intracellular retention of misfolded p55 receptor
may be contributing to the inflammatory response.4
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation

• The first clinical episode occurs during childhood or adolescence.
• Febrile episodes with a distinctive migratory rash and myalgia, ocular
involvement, and serositis last anywhere from 1 to 6 weeks.
The migratory rash associated with TRAPS is distinctive. It is an
erythematous macule associated with a significant amount of soft tissue
swelling and myalgias of the muscles underlying the skin. The rash typically
starts on the trunk or proximal limbs and migrates distally.
Ocular involvement seen in TRAPS consists of periorbital edema and
conjunctivitis. Uveitis is not seen.
Serositis can involve pleura, peritoneum, and pericardium but is typically
less severe than seen in FMF.

• Amyloidosis occurs in about 15% of TRAPS patients. It is unknown whether
long-term treatment prevents amyloidosis.
584

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

• Acute phase reactants are elevated during attacks.
• Diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of a TNFRSF1A mutation known to
cause disease.
Imaging
MRI of areas with the typical TRAPS rash demonstrates panniculitis and fasciitis of
the underlying muscles; myositis is not seen.
TREATMENT

• NSAIDs can be used in mild episodes.
• Corticosteroids are used for more severe attacks. However, the dose of
corticosteroids necessary to abort attacks escalates during the course of the
illness.

• Small prospective trials have demonstrated partial efficacy of etanercept in
both preventing attacks and aborting them.

• IL-1 receptor antagonists have been used successfully to both prevent and
abort attacks in patients who have failed etanercept.5

CRYOPYRINOPATHIES
GENERAL PRINCIPLES

• Cryopyrinopathies (cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes, CAPS) are rare
diseases caused by dominantly inherited mutations in CIAS1 (also known as
NLRP3), a gene encoding cryopyrin (also known as NAPL3).

• Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), Muckle–Wells syndrome,
and neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID; also known as
chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous and articular syndrome [CINCA]) are a
spectrum of diseases caused by CIAS1 mutations. NOMID/CINCA is the most
severe and FCAS is the mildest.6

• Cryopyrin is part of a macromolecular complex called “inflammasome,”
585

which activates an enzyme that cleaves IL-1βto its active form.

• The mutations in CIAS1 result in elevated IL-1βlevel at baseline or in
response to certain triggers.
DIAGNOSIS
Clinical Presentation
Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome

• About 150 cases have been reported in the United States.
• Symptoms typically develop in childhood.
• Patients develop attacks of fever, pruritic, and painful rash, and limb pain
which is sometimes accompanied by abdominal pain and conjunctivitis.

• Attacks occur reliably 1 to 2 hours after generalized cold exposure.
Muckle–Wells Syndrome

• Symptoms develop in childhood.
• Like FCAS, patients develop attacks of fever, rash (urticaria), abdominal pain,
and conjunctivitis. Unlike FCAS, patients do not have attacks reliably after
generalized cold exposure and avoidance of cold exposure does not prevent
attacks.

• Patients with Muckle–Wells syndrome develop progressive sensorineural
deafness that can be reversible with treatment.

• 25% of patients may develop systemic amyloidosis.
Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease

• Febrile episodes start during infancy but then start to become more chronic than
recurrent acute episodes.

• Along with fevers, rash, and sensorineural hearing loss, patients develop
uveitis, disabling arthropathy due to overgrowth of the patella and epiphyses of
long bones, and chronic aseptic meningitis with cerebral atrophy and mental
retardation.

• 25% of patients may develop systemic amyloidosis.

586

TREATMENT
All the three cryopyrinopathies show a dramatic clinical and laboratory response
(including the amyloidosis) to treatment with IL-1 inhibitors including anakinra (IL1 receptor antagonist), rilonacept (IL-1 Trap, a fusion protein of the extracellular
domain of the IL-1 receptor and the Fc region of IgG), and canakinumab (monoclonal
antibody against IL-1β).7

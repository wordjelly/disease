Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series first published in 1997 and now, 15 years on, we are still
going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series
relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions build on
the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material, to keep
the series up to date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and student
reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have completely
re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s ‘single-best answer’
and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout of the titles
has also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during long sessions of
revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles on
which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming at
distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material is
checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Prefaces
Author
Medical exams can be a daunting experience. This textbook aims to help prepare
students by providing a comprehensive overview of the gastrointestinal system,
presented in a clear and concise manner. It takes readers through a logical thought
process starting with basic anatomy and physiology and culminating with clinical
disorders. This provides a strong foundation which allows students to understand
the basic sciences, and then apply this to a clinical scenario.
As well as aiding revision, hopefully this book will also prove a useful resource when
making the transition from student to house officer. It provides a detailed overview
of the common gastrointestinal problems that you will certainly face on the wards.
I hope that you enjoy reading this book and find it a useful resource.

Faculty advisor
Despite their best intentions and notice of timetables, all students find that
exams come too soon. Crash Course is written by people who’ve been there for
people who are getting there! The series is largely written by students in their
final year or just after qualifying as doctors who have recently passed their exams
and who know what you need to know to pass and excel in your exam. This
book on the Gastrointestinal System tells you that, but I hope is comprehensive
enough to give you even more – a good grounding in clinical gastroenterology
and hepatology. It is an exciting subject area and Crash Course is designed to bring
it alive with information. The illustrations in this book pack in a thousand more
words than we could in the text and I hope you will enjoy learning from them.

Introduction to the
gastrointestinal system

1

Objectives
After reading this chapter you should be able to:
• Outline and reproduce the basic structure of the gastrointestinal system
• Describe the functions of the gastrointestinal system
• Name the major food groups and their roles
• Describe the embryological development of the gastrointestinal tract

ANATOMICAL OVERVIEW
The gastrointestinal (GI) system is comprised of several
organs (Fig. 1.1). Anatomically, it is essentially a muscular tube which maintains the same basic structure
throughout its length (Fig. 1.2). From the innermost
to the outermost, the layers which comprise the basic
structure are the mucosa (composed of the epithelial
layer, lamina propria and muscularis mucosae), submucosa, two smooth layers (the inner is circular, and the
outer longitudinal) and finally the serosa.
There are also intrinsic submucosal (Meissner’s) and
mucosal (Auerbach’s) nerve plexuses, the activity of
which is moderated by extrinsic innervations and
hormones.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is essential to know the basic structure of the GI tract
and the order of the layers; MCQs often test this.

Food moves through the GI tract by gravity, voluntary muscle action (from the oral cavity to the oesophagus) and peristalisis (a wavelike movement involving
the co-ordinated contraction of muscle in one area followed by relaxation in the next area; see Chapter 4).
A series of sphincters prevent any reflux or backflow
of food (Fig. 1.3).
Clinical Note
Among other factors, the integrity of the lower
oesophageal sphincter protects against reflux of acid
contents from the stomach (gastro-oesophageal reflux
disease, or GORD).

FUNCTIONS OF THE
GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
We need a gut because our body needs to extract small
molecules from the large molecules which are bound up
in food for metabolism. A complete list of functions is
in Fig. 1.4, with the main ones being motility, secretion,
digestion and absorption.
Motility refers to the muscular contractions which
cause the propulsion and mixing of gut contents. The
tone of the smooth muscle layers maintains a constant
pressure on the contents of the GI tract, allowing peristalsis (propulsive movements) and mixing to occur.
In addition, sympathetic and parasympathetic reflexes
occurring in different parts of the tract act through hormonal and neuronal mechanisms to modify the
speed of food movement through the tract. The contents
move through the tract at a rate at which they can be
processed.
The other three principal functions are closely related. Secretory glands release digestive juices into the
gut lumen. These juices contain enzymes which break
up complex food structures into smaller absorbable
units by hydrolysis, i.e. digestion. Following this,
the products of digestion are absorbed into the blood
or lymph from the gut lumen, mainly in the small
intestine.
Other functions related to the digestive process
include:
• Storage of waste material in the sigmoid colon and
rectum
• Exocrine, endocrine and paracrine secretions are all
involved in active digestion and the control of digestion and motility in the gut
• Some GI peptide hormones have local and systemic
effects
• Excretion of waste products.

The GI tract is not sterile as it is open to the external
environment. It is thus presented with a number of challenges on a daily basis, from harmful bacteria to toxic
substances and so requires good defence mechanisms:
• Sight, smell and taste often alert us to the fact that
food is contaminated. The vomit reflex exists to eject
harmful material
• The acid in the stomach kills most of the bacteria
ingested with food
• The natural bacterial flora of the gut prevent colonization by potentially harmful bacteria
• Aggregations of lymphoid tissue (part of the immune
system) are present in the walls of the gut, known
as Peyer’s patches. These can mount an immune response to antigens found in the diet.

An average 70-kg male may survive for 5–6 weeks on
body fat stores when deprived of food, provided he is
able to drink water. Blood glucose levels drop during
the initial few days, then rise and stabilize. During prolonged fasting, the body will also break down muscle, including heart muscle, to provide energy. This may lead to
death from cardiac failure. However, most food-deprived
people do not die from starvation directly, but from the
inability to fight off infectious diseases.
Conversely, overeating is a major cause of morbidity.
This is because excess food, which is stored as fat, leads
to obesity and associated diseases such as ischaemic
heart disease and type 2 diabetes.
A description of the major food groups follows. For
a more comprehensive account of the food groups and
the metabolic processes involved in starvation and
overeating, see Crash Course: Metabolism and Nutrition.

FOOD GROUPS
Food is a source of energy, minerals and vitamins which
are required by the body for growth, maintenance and
repair. The key food groups are carbohydrates, fat and
protein, which are summarized in Fig. 1.5.

2

Carbohydrate
Carbohydrates are the main energy source of most diets.
They provide 17 kJ (4 kcal) of energy per gram. Most
dietary carbohydrate is in the form of polysaccharides,

which consist of chains of glucose molecules. The principal ingested polysaccharides are starch, which is derived
from plant sources, and glycogen from animal sources.
Other sources of carbohydrate are monosaccharides
(glucose, fructose and galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose and lactose). Cellulose is an indigestible polysaccharide and is considered in the section on dietary fibre.
Carbohydrates are cheap forms of food, and so are
easily taken in excess, often limiting the intake of other
food constituents.

Protein
Protein is composed of amino acids linked by peptide
bonds. Nine amino acids are essential for protein synthesis and nitrogen balance; the other necessary amino
acids can be manufactured de novo in the body. Protein
is required for tissue growth and repair. Meat is the principal source of protein, especially in the developed
world.

We need 0.75 g of protein per kilogram of body
weight per day, but in developed countries most people
exceed this. In developing countries, combinations of
certain foods can provide enough of the essential amino
acids even though those foods, on their own, are low in
some amino acids. A good example of a non-animal
protein source which is high in essential amino acids
is soybeans.
Proteins provide about the same amount of energy
per gram as carbohydrates, but are not as easily utilized
under normal circumstances.

Fat
Dietary fat is chiefly composed of triglycerides (esters of
free fatty acids and glycerol, which may be saturated,
monounsaturated or polyunsaturated). The essential
fatty acids are linoleic acid and a-linoleic acid, which
cannot be manufactured and so must be obtained from
our diet.

The body is efficient at manufacturing fats (triglycerides, sterols and phospholipids) and will lay down
subcutaneous fat stores even on low-fat diets.
Dietary fat provides 37 kJ (9 kcal) of energy per gram.
Nevertheless, due to its ill-effects when taken in excess,
fats should comprise less than 35% of the total energy
intake.

exhalation of water vapour (more water is required in
hot climates). Excess water is excreted in the urine by
the kidneys; inadequate intake leads to dehydration.
Water is also needed for digestion, as digestion involves enzymatic hydrolysis of the bonds linking the
smaller units which make up complex food structures.

Water

Minerals

Fluid intake and oxidation of food provides water for
the body. About 1 litre of water is needed per day to balance insensible losses such as sweating, metabolism and

These are chemicals that must be present in the diet
to maintain good health. Over 20 have so far been
identified, e.g. iron and calcium.

Trace elements (e.g. zinc, copper and iodine) are substances that, by definition, are present in the body in
low concentrations (less than 100 parts per million)
and include some minerals. It is not yet known whether
all trace elements are essential for health.

Vitamins
Vitamins are classified as fat soluble or water soluble;
vitamins A, D, E and K are fat soluble, the other vitamins
are water soluble.
Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in fatty tissue in the
body (mainly in the liver) and are not usually excreted
in the urine. It is thus possible to have an excess of these

vitamins, which may be toxic, e.g. vitamin A poisoning.
On the other hand, absorption of fat-soluble vitamins
is dependent upon the absorption of dietary fat: deficiency can occur in cases of fat malabsorption (see
Chapter 4).
Body stores of water-soluble vitamins (other than
vitamin B12) are smaller than stores of fat-soluble vitamins. They are excreted in the urine and deficiencies of
water-soluble vitamins are more common.

Dietary fibre
Dietary fibre consists of indigestible carbohydrates, primarily cellulose but also lignin and pectin. Cellulose
cannot be digested as we do not have the enzymes

necessary to hydrolyse the b-glycosidic bonds linking its
glucose molecules, unlike starch where the glucose
residues are linked by a-glycosidic bonds.
Although it does not provide energy, fibre adds bulk
to the bowel contents and increases gut motility, thus
preventing constipation. It also decreases absorption
of toxic compounds, e.g. some carcinogens, due to its
binding properties.

DEVELOPMENT
The gastrointestinal (GI) system (Fig. 1.1) develops entirely from the endoderm in the embryo. The formation
of the tube is largely passive; it depends on the cephalocaudal and lateral folding of the embryo.
The yolk sac produces blood cells and vessels, and is
the site of haematopoiesis for the first 2 months from
conception. Later, it becomes inverted and incorporated
into the body cavity. The folding of the embryo constricts the initial communication between the embryo
and the yolk sac.
The remnant of this communication is the vitelline
duct, which normally disappears in utero. Where it persists, it is known as a Meckel’s diverticulum.
The gut tube divides into foregut, midgut and hindgut. Their blood supply is from the coeliac trunk,
superior mesenteric artery and inferior mesenteric artery
respectively (Fig. 1.6). All derivatives from each division
of the gut tube will thus have the same principal
blood supply. The superior mesenteric artery is in the
umbilicus.

6

The nerve supply of the foregut and midgut is
from the vagus nerve (Xth cranial nerve), while the
hindgut gets its nerve supply from the pelvic splanchnic
nerves.
HINTS AND TIPS
The embryological development of the GI tract is a
common question in exams – make sure you know the
key stages, as well as the blood supply to the gut
divisions and the developments during the herniation
of the midgut.

The gut tube starts straight but twists during development and the midgut grows rapidly, with the
developing liver occupying most of the space. As development progresses, there is not enough room in the
fetal abdomen to accommodate the rapidly developing
gut because of the large size of the liver and the two sets
of kidneys. The midgut therefore herniates into the
umbilical cord between weeks 7 and 11 of gestation,
continuing its development outside the abdominal
cavity.
The midgut, which forms an umbilical loop outside
the abdominal cavity, undergoes a clockwise rotation of
180 around the axis of the superior mesenteric artery
and what was the inferior limb becomes the superior
limb (and vice versa). At the same time, it elongates
to form the loops of the jejunum and ileum.
During the 11th week, the midgut returns into the
abdomen, the process being known as the reduction
of the physiological midgut hernia. The reason for this

is not well-explained, but is possibly due to the reduction in size of the liver and kidneys as well as the enlargement of the abdomen. The part forming the
small intestine returns first to occupy the central part
of the abdomen. The part forming the large intestine undergoes a 270 anticlockwise rotation as it returns so
that the caecum lies under the liver. The tube then elongates again so that the caecum points downwards. The
falciform ligament lies in front of the liver and the lesser
omentum lies behind the liver. These developmental
stages are shown in Fig. 1.7, while other organs and
structures develop as described below:
• The liver and pancreas develop from endodermal diverticula that bud off the duodenum in weeks 4–6
(see Fig. 6.5)
• Much of the mouth (including the muscles of mastication and tongue) and the oesophagus develop

gastrointestinal tract

Objectives
After reading this chapter you should be able to:
• List the components of the upper gastrointestinal tract
• Outline the embryological development of the structures making up the upper gastrointestinal tract
• Describe the anatomy and histological structure of the different components: tongue, oesophagus,
salivary glands
• List the factors which affect appetite
• List the functions of saliva
• Describe the mechanism of swallowing
• Outline the factors which cause vomiting
• Outline the following types of disorders in the upper gastrointestinal tract: congenital abnormalities,
infections and inflammatory disease, vascular disease and neoplastic disease

OVERVIEW
The upper gastrointestinal tract starts at the mouth and
ends at the ligament of Trietze which separates the third
and fourth parts of the duodenum. Associated structures
include the tongue and salivary glands. Ingestion and
the initial breaking up of food occur in the mouth, after
which the food boluses are swallowed and enter the
oesophagus. This is helped by the action of the tongue
and pharyngeal muscles, as well as saliva secreted by
the salivary glands.

FUNCTIONS AND PHYSIOLOGY

Food intake and its control
The control of food intake is complex and the hypothalamus plays an important role. Young people burn
off excess intake as heat and through physical activity.
They maintain a relatively constant weight, but this
ability reduces with age.
Genetics have a huge influence on feeding and can
account for up to 70% of the difference in body mass
index in later life.

Signals which affect appetite
There are a number of factors which regulate appetite:
• Blood glucose concentration activates glucoreceptors in
the hypothalamus, which act to up-regulate hunger

•
•

when blood glucose levels fall, or up-regulate satiety
when blood glucose concentrations rise
Fat ingestion releases cholecystokinin (CCK), which
slows stomach emptying, making us feel full
Calcitonin, a peptide hormone secreted by the
thyroid gland, acts to reduce appetite
Insulin acts to up-regulate appetite, but glucagon
down-regulates it
Deposition of fat may lead to control of appetite by
neuronal and hormonal signals. Leptin, a protein secreted by white fat cells, acts on the leptin receptors
in the hypothalamus. This is thought to be part of
the main satiety centre in the brain. Leptin produces
a feedback mechanism between adipose tissue and
the brain, acting as a ‘lipostat’, thus controlling fat
stores. Leptin inhibits neuropeptide Y, which is the
most potent peptide to stimulate feeding
Cold environments stimulate appetite, whereas hot environments inhibit it
Distension of a full stomach inhibits appetite, but contraction of an empty stomach stimulates it.

Central controls
The satiety centre is found in the ventromedial wall and
the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus.
Stimulation of this inhibits food intake (aphagia), but
lesions in this area may result in hyperphagia.
Glucostats in the brain measure the utilization of
glucose. Diabetic patients feel hungry despite high
blood glucose concentrations, because they lack
insulin and, therefore, the cellular ability to take up
glucose.

9

The upper gastrointestinal tract
A feeding centre (not specific for hunger) is found in
the lateral hypothalamus. Stimulation of this area increases eating and lesions here result in aphagia.
Other important central nervous system controls
include opioids, somatostatin and growth-hormonereleasing hormone, all of which increase appetite. 5Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin), dopamine and
g-aminobutyric acid (GABA) all decrease appetite.

Diurnal variation
Carbohydrates are generally metabolized during the
day, and fats at night. The hypothalamus is responsible
for the switch between the two.

Mastication
Mastication breaks up large food particles, mixing them
with salivary secretions and aiding subsequent digestion. Molecules dissolve in salivary secretions and stimulate taste buds. Odours are released that activate the
olfactory system, leading to the initiation of reflex
salivation and gastric acid secretions.
The muscles of mastication cause movement of the
mandible at the temporomandibular joint. The digastric
and mylohyoid muscles open the mouth, while the
infrahyoid muscles stabilize the hyoid bone during
mastication.
The teeth, gums, palate and tongue also play an important role, manipulating food and immobilizing it
between the crushing surfaces of the teeth. The tongue

primary secretion is released into the
blind-ending acini and the fluid then
flows through a series of converging
ducts for secondary modification,
before entering the oral cavity. The
parotid glands produce the most
serous secretions.

then propels the bolus of food along the palate towards
the pharynx, initiating the swallowing reflex.

Salivation
The average rate of salivary secretion is 1–2 L per day.
Saliva composition varies according to the rate and site
of production, but the main components are water, proteins and electrolytes. Primary secretion from the acini
produces an isotonic fluid that is modified in the ducts
(Fig. 2.1).

Control of salivary secretion
Secretion of saliva is under the control of the salivary
centre in the medulla. Parasympathetic innervation
causes an up-regulation in secretion and sympathetic innervation causes a downregulation. Parasympathetic
cholinergic stimulation produces a watery secretion,
which is blocked by atropine. This is given before
surgery to reduce the risk of aspiration of saliva.
Sympathetic adrenergic and noradrenergic stimulation produce thick mucoid secretions, which add to
the dry mouth sensation during the fright–fight–flight
response.
There is a baseline level of salivary secretion, which
is about 0.5 mL/min and is due to ongoing low-level
parasympathetic stimulation. This baseline secretion
prevents the mouth and pharynx from drying out.
On top of the baseline, increases in salivary secretion
occur reflexively. There are two types of salivary

Functions and physiology
reflex: the simple reflex and the conditioned, or acquired,
reflex. In the simple reflex, chemoreceptors in the mouth
and oropharynx are activated by the taste of food; for example, amyl nitrate and citric acid produce copious secretion, hence sucking on a lemon wedge increases the rate
of secretion about tenfold.
In the conditioned reflex, no oral stimulation is
needed. Thinking, smelling and seeing food causes salivation by activating the salivary centre via the cerebral
cortex. The conditioned reflex is acquired in response to
previous experience.
Chewing produces saliva secretion by stimulating
receptors in the masticatory muscles and joints. Paradontal mechanoreceptors around the teeth can also
stimulate saliva.
However salivation is initiated, the impulses to
the salivary glands travel via the autonomic nerves
(Fig. 2.2).
Denervation causes dribbling. This is known as
Canon’s law of denervation hypersensitivity. Normally
receptors are localized at neuroeffector junctions, but, if
nerves are cut, receptors spread all over the gland and it
becomes excessively sensitive to circulating acetylcholine, producing copious amounts of saliva.
There are four main sites at which the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nerves can act to modify saliva
secretion:

sensory stimuli, e.g.
thought, sight,
smell of food

chemoreceptors and
pressure receptors
in mouth

2

• The acini producing the primary secretion
• The ducts, which modify the secretions
• The blood vessels providing substances required
for secretion and energy-containing nutrients, and
removal of waste
• The myoepithelial cells surrounding the ducts and
acini.

Salivary electrolytes
The major electrolytes found in saliva are Naþ, Kþ, Cl–
and HCO3  . The concentrations vary according to the
rate of flow (Fig. 2.3). Levels of Naþ and Cl– in saliva
are hypotonic, but levels of HCO3  and Kþ are hypertonic at higher rates of flow. Saliva is hypotonic overall
(about 200 mmol/L) and alkaline.

Salivary proteins
Salivary proteins include amylase, ribonuclease,
R protein (which protects vitamin B12 as it passes
through the duodenum, jejunum and ileum), lipase
(important in cystic fibrosis when pancreatic lipase is
lost), lysozyme, secretory IgA (immunoglobulin A),
IgG and IgM.
Epidermal growth factor (EGF) is also secreted in saliva. This has a protective role at the gastroduodenal
mucosa, by preventing the development of ulcers and
promoting healing.

• General cleansing and protection of the buccal cavity, by washing away food particles which attract
bacteria
• Moistening of the buccal cavity for speech (by aiding
movements of the lips and tongue) and breastfeeding (saliva forms a seal around the mother’s nipple)
• Secretion of digestive enzymes, especially salivary
amylase, which hydrolyses linkages in starch
• Dissolving many food components, thus contributing to the taste of food
• Lubrication of the buccal cavity by mucus-secreting
units of glands (under sympathetic and parasympathetic control), which helps swallowing
• Secretion of the antibacterial enzyme lysozyme,
which protects teeth
• Secretion of IgA by plasma cells in connective tissue,
which act to protect the body from invasion of microorganisms. The secretory component of IgA is
synthesized by striated duct cells
• Neutralizing acid produced by bacteria as well as
acids in food by the presence of bicarbonate; this
helps to prevent dental caries.

Flow of saliva (mL/min)

Oral mucosal absorption
The sublingual mucosa has an absorptive surface which,
though unimportant for nutrition, can be exploited for
the administration of some drugs. Most drugs are administered orally but this exposes drugs to first-pass
metabolism in the liver. Drugs given orally must dissolve in the gastrointestinal fluids and penetrate the epithelial cell lining of the gastrointestinal tract by passive
diffusion or active transport. Some drugs are poorly
absorbed orally or are unstable in the tract.
Sublingual administration allows diffusion into the
systemic circulation through the capillary network of
the oral cavity, bypassing the liver and avoiding firstpass metabolism. Lower doses can, therefore, be given.
Glyceryl trinitrate used in angina treatment is commonly given this way.

Oral defences
The alkaline pH of saliva neutralizes acid in food or in
gastric contents following vomiting. Calcium and phosphate in saliva protect teeth by mineralizing newly
erupted teeth and repairing pre-carious white spots in
enamel.
Salivary proteins cover teeth with a protective coat
called an acquired pedicle. Antibodies and antibacterial
agents retard bacterial growth and tooth decay. The
mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) also plays

12

an important role in protecting against microbial invasion at the mucosal membranes of the oral cavity.

Swallowing
We swallow about 600 times a day: 200 times while eating and drinking, 350 times while awake (when not eating or drinking) and 50 times while asleep.
Swallowing is the controlled transport of a food bolus from mouth to stomach, involving a sequential
swallowing motor programme, which is generated in
the medullary swallowing centre and consists of three
phases: buccal, pharyngeal and oesophageal (Fig. 2.4).
It is an ‘all-or-nothing’ reflex; it is initiated voluntarily,
but once it is started, it cannot be stopped.

The buccal phase
The voluntary buccal phase occurs when the mouth is
closed. The bolus of food is pushed upwards and backwards against the hard palate, forcing it into the pharynx. This phase initiates the subsequent phases, which
are involuntary.

The pharyngeal phase
The pharyngeal phase lasts about 1 second, and is initiated by the bolus stimulating mechanoreceptors in
the pharynx and firing impulses in the trigeminal

(Vth cranial nerve), glossopharyngeal (IXth cranial
nerve) and vagus (Xth cranial nerve) nerves. Efferent fibres pass to the tongue and the pharyngeal muscles
through the trigeminal, facial and hypoglossal nerves.
This results in:
• The tongue being positioned against the hard palate,
thus preventing the bolus re-entering the oral cavity
• The nasopharynx being closed off by the soft palate,
in particular the uvula
• The larynx is elevated and its opening sealed off by
the vocal folds
• The epiglottis closing the larynx
• The relaxation and opening of the upper oesophageal sphincter (UOS) for 0.5–1 s (once the bolus
has passed through the upper oesophageal sphincter, it contracts tightly.
Clinical Note
Note also that respiration, which would be futile as the
airway is closed, is temporarily stopped because the
swallowing centre inhibits the respiratory centre, which
is also located in the medulla.

The oesophageal phase
The oesophageal phase involves transport of the bolus
along the oesophagus and takes between 6 and 10 seconds. Both primary and secondary peristaltic contractions are required.
The primary peristaltic wave is initiated by swallowing and sweeps down the entire length of the oesophagus. It involves sequential activation of the vagal
efferents, which supply the striated muscle in the upper
oesophagus directly. The smooth muscle is supplied by
the enteric nerve plexus.
The bolus of food begins to move towards the stomach with the aid of gravity. The secondary peristaltic
wave is triggered in response to local distension of the
oesophagus and begins on the orad (mouth) side of
the bolus and runs to the lower oesophageal sphincter
(LOS). This occurs by an enteric reflex and helps clear
food residues. Tertiary waves are common in the elderly,
but they are not peristaltic or propulsive.
The LOS relaxes when the peristaltic wave meets it. It
opens, allowing the bolus to pass into the stomach. Precision of tone is given by the vagal excitatory fibres (cholinergic) and the vagal inhibitory fibres (non-adrenergic
non-cholinergic; NANC). These act reciprocally.

13

The upper gastrointestinal tract
To tighten the LOS, an up-regulation in vagal excitatory fibre stimulation is required, coupled with
a down-regulation in vagal inhibitory fibre stimulation. The opposite is true in relaxing or opening
the LOS.

Vomiting
Vomiting (emesis) is one of the most common symptoms of illness, especially in children (where it is associated with almost any physical or emotional illness),
pregnancy, alcohol dependency and some metabolic
disorder.
The vomiting centre (Fig. 2.5) in the lateral reticular
formation of the medulla ‘coordinates’ the process of
vomiting. It is stimulated by:
• The chemoreceptor zone (CTZ) in the area postrema, which may itself be stimulated by circulating
chemicals, drugs, motion sickness (induced by prolonged stimulation of the vestibular apparatus) and
metabolic causes
• Vagal and sympathetic afferent neurons from the
gut, which are stimulated by mucosal irritation
• The limbic system – less is known about these
circuits, but sights, smells and emotional circumstances can induce vomiting.
Lesions of the chemoreceptor zones abolish vomiting
induced by some emetic drugs, uraemia and radiation
sickness, but not by gastrointestinal irritation.
Vomiting involves a retrograde giant contraction
from the intestines, which expels some intestinal contents as well as gastric contents.

Stages of vomiting
• A feeling of nausea is often accompanied by autonomic symptoms of sweating, pallor and hypersalivation (which protects the mucosa of the mouth
from the acid contents of the stomach)
• A deep breath is taken and the epiglottis closes, protecting the trachea and lungs
• At the same time, the retrograde giant contraction
moves the contents of the upper intestine into the
stomach
• The breath is held, fixing the chest. The muscles of
the abdominal wall contract, increasing intraabdominal pressure
• The oesophageal sphincters relax allowing expulsion
of gastric contents through the mouth by reverse
peristalsis.

Pharmacology of vomiting
It is important to understand the neural control of
vomiting as most of the anti-emetic drugs act on the
receptors of the neurotransmitters involved, i.e. 5-HT,
dopamine, histamine and acetylcholine.
Anti-emetic drugs are used to prevent motion sickness; to prevent vomiting caused by other pharmacological agents, such as opioids; as well as vomiting due to
other diseases, such as gastroenteritis or uraemia. Also,
as prevention of vomiting is easier than stopping it once
it has started, anti-emetics should be given before an
emetic stimulus.
A description of the major classes of anti-emetics and
how they work follows.

5-HT receptor antagonists (e.g. ondansetron)
5-HT is an important neurotransmitter in the vomiting
reflex. As such, selective 5-HT receptor antagonists, for
example ondansetron which blocks 5-HT3 receptors,
are used to treat and prevent vomiting caused by cytotoxic drugs. These drugs act on the CTZ and visceral afferent nerves, as 5-HT3 receptors are found there.

stimulation of emesis should not be tried if the substance is corrosive or if the patient is not fully conscious.
Ipecacuanha, or syrup of ipecac, is a gastric irritant
and the most common drug used to induce vomiting.
The active ingredients of this drug are emetine and
cephaeline, which are alkaloids.

Dopamime receptor blocker (e.g. metoclopramide)
Metoclopramide acts by blocking dopamine receptors in
the CTZ. Dopamine, like 5-HT, is a neurotransmitter
in the vomiting pathway. Metoclopramide also has a
stimulant effect on gastrointestinal motility, which adds
to its anti-emetic function.

H1-receptor antagonists (e.g. cyclizine)
H1-receptor antagonists are effective against motion
sickness, as these receptors are found in the vestibular
nuclei, and against vomiting caused by substances acting in the stomach. However, they are of no use against
vomiting produced by substances acting on the CTZ.

Muscarinic-receptor antagonists (e.g. hyoscine)
Acetylcholine receptors are found in the vomiting centre
and in the nucleus tractus solitarius. Muscarinicreceptor antagonists, are therefore effective in preventing motion sickness and vomiting caused by gastric
stimuli but not against vomiting caused by substances
acting on the CTZ.

THE MOUTH, ORAL CAVITY
AND OROPHARYNX

Anatomy
The oral cavity extends from the lips to the pillars of the
fauces, which is the opening to the pharynx. It contains
the tongue, alveolar arches (which anchor the teeth),
gums, teeth and the openings of the salivary ducts
(Fig. 2.6).
The blood supply of the oral cavity (as well as the
oropharynx) comes from branches of the external carotid artery, such as the facial artery and lingual artery.
Innervation comes from branches of the cranial nerves.
The oral cavity is lined with stratifed squamous
epithelium with an underlying submucosa containing
collagen, elastin and salivary glands.

Emetic drugs

Embryology and development

Stimulation of vomiting may be needed in certain circumstances, for example if a toxic substance has been
ingested and gastric lavage is difficult. However,

The head and neck derive primarily from the pharyngeal
(branchial) arches, which are bars of mesenchymal tissue with an outer covering of ectoderm and inner

covering of endoderm, separated by pharyngeal clefts
and outpocketings called pharyngeal pouches.
Each pharyngeal arch contains neural crest
cells, which contribute to skeletal components. Each
also contains an arterial, cranial nerve and muscular
component.
At about four and a half weeks of embryological development, the first and second arches form the mesenchymal prominences. The first pharyngeal arch consists of a
dorsal and ventral portion called the maxillary and mandibular prominences, respectively. These fuse and develop with the frontonasal prominence to give rise to
the mandible, upper lip, palate and nose. Failure to fuse
results in abnormalities, such as cleft palate and cleft lip.

The lips
These mark the boundaries of the mouth. The outer surface of the lips is covered with skin containing hairs, sebaceous glands and sweat glands, while the inner
surface is lined with non-keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium.
In between the inner and outer surfaces is the vermilion border. This is the transition zone. The epithelium
resembles that of the inner surface, but has a rete ridge
system with prominent blood vessels. It is these vessels
which give the lips their red colour.
Deep to the epithelium, striated muscle is found arranged in a concentric fashion around the mouth. This
is the orbicularis oris muscle which opens and closes the
mouth.
The lips are supplied by the labial arteries, which
come off the facial arteries. These form an arterial ring
around the lips. Lightly pinching the lips with two
fingers will allow their pulse to be felt.

The teeth
The primary teeth first erupt at around age 6–8 months
and there are 20 in total. By age 18, however, eruption of
the permanent teeth is normally complete and by then
there are 32 teeth, 16 on each jaw (Fig. 2.7A). The third
molars (‘wisdom teeth’) may or may not have erupted
by that age.
Each tooth has three parts: the crown, the neck and
the root (Fig. 2.7B). Histologically, most of the tooth
is comprised of dentine. This is covered by enamel over
the crown and cementum over the root. The root canal
is the channel by which vessels and nerves enter the
pulp cavity.

The palate
The hard and soft palates form the roof of the mouth
and separate it from the nasal cavity. The former is

formed by the palatine processes of the maxillae and
the palatine bones.
The soft palate is posterior to the hard palate. Its oral
surface contains many mucous glands. The soft palate is
a mobile, muscular aponeurosis attached to the posterior border of the bony hard palate. It is covered with
mucous membrane and is continuous laterally with
the wall of the pharynx. Between the pillars of the fauces
is the palatine tonsil.
The palatoglossal and palatopharyngeal arches join
the tongue and the pharynx, respectively, to the soft
palate. The curved free border of the soft palate lies between the oropharynx and the nasopharynx. From this
hangs the uvula, in the midline, which is seen to move
when a patient says ‘aahh’. The muscles of the soft
palate are:

a branch of the trigeminal nerve.

The tongue

2

Clinical Note
Paralysis or total relaxation of the genioglossus muscle,
such as with general anaesthesia, allows the tongue to
fall posteriorly and obstruct the airways, causing
suffocation. Anaesthetized patients are always
intubated to prevent this happening.

Anatomy
The tongue is a muscular structure and its dorsum (upper surface) is divided into anterior (two thirds) and
posterior (one third) by a V-shaped border-line – the
sulcus terminalis. At the apex of the sulcus terminalis
is the foramen caecum, which is the remnant of the
embryonic thyroglossal duct opening.
The tongue consists of four pairs of intrinsic muscles
(superior and inferior longitudinal, transverse and vertical), which have no attachments outside the tongue itself. These muscles are involved with changing the
shape of the tongue.
The extrinsic muscles originate outside the tongue
and attach to it. They act to control movement of the
tongue. The extrinsic muscles are:
• Genioglossus – a fan-shaped muscle that attaches to
the mandible in the midline
• Hyoglossus – attaches to the hyoid bone
• Styloglossus – attaches to the styloid process and its
fibres interdigitate with the hyoglossus
• Palatoglossus – originates in the soft palate and
enters the lateral part of the tongue.

pharynx and epiglottis
sensitive to all four
modalities of taste

The palatoglossus muscle is innervated by the fibres
from the cranial root of the accessory nerve (XIth cranial
nerve), through the pharyngeal branch of the vagus
nerve. The other lingual muscles are innervated by the
hypoglossal nerve (XIIth cranial nerve). The nerve
supply of the tongue is summarized in Fig. 2.8.
The arterial supply to the tongue is from the lingual
artery (a branch of the external carotid). The lingual vein
drains the tongue. Lymph drains to the deep cervical,
submandibular and submental nodes.

HINTS AND TIPS
The function of the hypoglossal (XIIth cranial) nerve can
be tested by asking the patient to protrude the tongue.
A lesion in one of the hypoglossal nerves paralyses it,
and the tongue will deviate towards the affected side
when protruded because of the unopposed action of the
contralateral genioglossus muscle.

Histology
The dorsal surface is covered with small papillae, especially the anterior two-thirds. Filiform papillae, which
look like short bristles, are the most numerous and
are found mainly in the middle of the tongue. Fungiform papillae, which are red and globular, are found
among the filiform papillae and on the tip of the
tongue.
Circumvallate papillae are found just anterior to the
sulcus terminalis and most of the taste buds are located
in the circular trenches surrounding these papillae
(Fig. 2.8). The posterior third contains the lingual tonsil. Very rudimentary foliate papillae may also be found,
although these are more numerous and developed in
some animals.
The four basic tastes detected by taste buds are sweet,
sour, salty and bitter. Taste receptors (also called taste
buds) sensitive to a particular taste are found in different
areas of the tongue (Fig. 2.8).

Embryology and development
Development of the tongue begins at the end of the 4th
week of gestation. The tongue mucosa develops from
the endoderm of the pharyngeal floor. The anterior
two thirds of the tongue develop primarily from the lateral lingual swellings and the median tongue bud (or
tuberculum impar), all of which are derived from the
1st pharyngeal arch.
The posterior third is formed by the growth of the
hypopharyngeal eminence (a structure formed from
the 3rd and 4th pharyngeal arches) over the copula,
a midline structure formed by mesoderm of the 2nd,
3rd and part of the 4th arches.
The muscles of the tongue, except palatoglossus, are
formed from mesoderm derived from the myotomes of
the occipital somites, and are supplied by the hypoglossal nerve.
The muscles of mastication, and their actions are:
• Masseter – elevates and protrudes jaw, closing it
• Temporalis – elevates mandible; retrudes mandible
after protrusion
• Lateral pterygoids – protrude mandible
• Medial – help elevate mandible, closing the jaw.
These develop from the mesoderm of the 1st pharyngeal
(branchial) arch. Their motor nerve supply is from the
mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve. They all
arise from the skull and insert into the mandible, causing movement of the mandible and the temporomandibular joint (Fig. 2.9).

Salivary glands
There are three pairs of large salivary glands (the parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands) and

18

numerous smaller glands, scattered throughout the
mouth (Fig. 2.10).
The parotid gland is formed from a tubular ectodermal outgrowth at the inner surface of the cheek. The
submandibular and sublingual glands are formed in a
similar fashion from invaginations of the endoderm
of the floor of the mouth.
The salivary glands consist of parenchymal (functional) and stromal (support) components. Each parenchymal unit is called a salivon, which consists of an
acinus (from the Latin word for grape) and a duct
(Fig. 2.11). The duct of the salivon modifies the secretions of the acinus.
Acini consist of serous or mucous cells. The parotid
gland has only serous acini, the sublingual gland contains mostly mucous acini and the submandibular
gland contains predominantly serous acini. The minor
salivary glands are mucous, except for von Ebner’s
glands and those in the tip of the tongue, which are
serous.

The parotid gland
This is the largest salivary gland and it produces serous
saliva. It lies between the ramus of the mandible and the
mastoid and coronoid processes, and its anterior border
overlies the masseter. An accessory lobe may be found
above this muscle. The parotid gland is covered with a
fibrous capsule that is continuous with the deep investing fascia of the neck. The facial nerve (VIIth cranial
nerve) passes through the parotid gland.
The parotid duct is about 5 cm long. It pierces the
buccinator muscle and opens into the mouth opposite
the second upper molar tooth. This opening can be felt
with the tongue.
The parotid gland is supplied by branches of the external carotid artery; venous blood drains to the retromandibular vein. It is innervated by both the
sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Parasympathetic innervation is secretomotor (causing production
of saliva); sympathetic innervation is vasoconstrictor
(causing a dry mouth).
Parasympathetic fibres are carried from the glossopharyngeal nerve through the otic ganglion and auriculotemporal nerve. Sympathetic fibres from the superior
cervical ganglion pass along the external carotid artery.
Lymph from the superficial part of the gland drains
to the parotid nodes and from the deep part to the
retropharyngeal nodes.

The submandibular gland
The submandibular gland lies in the floor of the mouth
covered by a fibrous capsule, and produces mixed serous and mucous secretions. Both its superficial and

deep parts communicate around the posterior border of
the mylohyoid muscle.
Its duct passes forwards between the mylohyoid and
hyoglossus muscles to open onto sublingual papillae
at the base of the frenulum. The lingual nerve crosses
the duct.
The gland is supplied by the facial and lingual arteries (branches of the external carotid arteries); venous
drainage is by the facial and lingual veins.
It is innervated by both the parasympathetic and
sympathetic systems. Parasympathetic fibres are conveyed from the facial nerve through the chorda tympani
and submandibular ganglion. Sympathetic innervation
is from the superior cervical ganglion, with fibres
passing along the arteries of the gland.
Lymphatic drainage is to the submandibular lymph
nodes, which are partly embedded in the gland and
partly lie between it and the mandible.

The sublingual gland
This is the smallest and also the most deeply situated of
the paired salivary glands. It is almond- shaped and found
below the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth.
It produces mainly mucous secretions, which either
pass into numerous small ducts (10–20) that open into
the floor of the mouth, or pass into the submandibular
duct. The innervation, blood supply and venous and lymphatic drainage are similar to the submandibular gland.

Pharynx
The pharynx is a fibromuscular tube, approximately
15 cm long, that extends from the base of the skull to
the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage anteriorly,
and to the inferior border of C6 vertebra posteriorly.
It communicates with the nose, middle ear (by the
auditory tube), mouth and larynx.
It conducts food and fluids to the oesophagus and air
to the larynx and lungs (however, some air is swallowed
with food).

20

The pharynx can be split into three functional
parts: the nasopharynx, the oropharynx and laryngopharynx. Its walls have mucous, submucous and
muscular layers. The muscular layer of the pharynx
consists of:
•
•
•
•

Superior, middle and inferior constrictors
Salpingopharyngeus
Stylopharyngeus
Palatopharyngeus.

The cricopharyngeus muscle forms the upper oesophageal sphincter (Fig. 2.12). Stylopharyngeus is supplied
by the glossopharyngeal nerve, but all the other muscles
of the pharynx are supplied by the vagus nerve through
the pharyngeal plexus on the outer surface of the middle
constrictor.
Superior to the superior constrictor muscle, the submucosa thickens to form the pharyngobasilar membrane, which blends with the buccopharyngeal fascia
to form the pharyngeal recess.
The pharyngeal tonsils, or adenoids, lie submucosally
in the nasopharynx. The epiglottis, a flap of cartilage

covered with mucous membrane, lies posterior to the
tongue in the laryngopharynx and closes the entrance
to the larynx during swallowing. On either side of the epiglottis lie the piriform fossae – a common site for fish
bones to lodge!
The pharynx is supplied by branches of the ascending
pharyngeal, superior thyroid, maxillary, lingual and facial arteries. Venous drainage is to the internal jugular
vein, via the pharyngeal venous plexus. Lymph from
the nasopharynx drains to the retropharyngeal lymph
nodes. The rest of the pharyngeal lymph drains to the
deep cervical nodes.
Together with the lingual tonsils, the palatine tonsils and other smaller aggregations, the pharyngeal
tonsils form a protective ring around the oro- and nasopharynx, called Waldeyer’s ring. These lymphoid tissues
are also described as mucosa-associated lymphoid
tissue (MALT).
Histologically, the pharyngeal mucosa is continuous
with that of the nose, oral cavity, auditory tube, larynx
and oesophagus. The nasopharynx is lined with respiratory epithelium (ciliated mucous membrane with
goblet cells).
The oropharynx and laryngopharynx are lined with
stratified squamous epithelium to withstand abrasion
from the passage of food.

Cleft lip and cleft palate are common defects, which
present with abnormal facial appearance and defective
speech. They occur in about every 1 out of every 700 live
births and are more common in males. A lateral cleft
lip (hare lip) may result from incomplete fusion of
the maxillary and medial nasal prominences, and a
cleft palate from failure of fusion of the palatine
shelves. Cleft lip and palate may also occur together
(Fig. 2.13).
The palatine shelves in the female fetus fuse about
1 week later than they do in the male; hence cleft palate
on its own is more common in female babies. Of every
nine affected babies, two have a cleft lip, three a cleft
palate and four have both. About 20% of babies with
cleft lip or palate also have other malformations.
Median cleft lip is much rarer and is caused by incomplete fusion of the two medial nasal prominences
in the midline. Infants with midline clefts often have
brain abnormalities, including loss of midline structures. These defects occur early in neurilation (days
19–21). The infants usually have severe learning
difficulties.
Failure of the maxillary prominence to merge with
the lateral nasal swelling causes an oblique facial cleft,
exposing the nasolacrimal duct.
Repair is surgical and is normally carried out after
3 months in the case of cleft lip and about 1 year in cleft
palate. Genetic and environmental factors have been
identified. Trisomy 13 (Patau’s syndrome) and a number of teratogens (most notably anticonvulsants such as
phenytoin and phenobarbital and also folic acid antagonists) are associated with both cleft lip and cleft palate.

Infectious and inflammatory
disease
The oral cavity and its mucosa are the target of many insults: infections, chemicals and physical agents. The oral
mucosa is, therefore, affected by a number of inflammatory disorders, either restricted to the mouth, or as part
of a systemic disease.

Herpes simplex virus
Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) infection usually affects
the body above the waist and herpes simplex virus 2
(HSV-2) below it. Changes in sexual practices, however,
have led to an increase in HSV-2 infections above
the waist.

The primary infection may be asymptomatic or produce a severe inflammatory reaction. Presentation is
usually with fever and painful ulcers in the mouth,
which may be widespread and confluent.
The virus can remain latent in the trigeminal ganglia,
but it may be reactivated by stress, trauma, fever and UV
radiation. This recurrent form of the disease presents as
cold sores.
About 70% of the population are infected with HSV-1
and recurrent infections are found in one third of those
affected. Complications of HSV-1 include spread to the
eye and acute encephalitis.
HSV infection in the immunocompromised, such
as those undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy for cancer,
or those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, is very dangerous. The infection can spread easily, leading to death in severe cases. Treatment for HSV
involves topical or systemic administration of aciclovir,
an antiviral drug.

Oral candidiasis (thrush)
Candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the yeast
Candida albicans; it looks similar to leucoplakia (see
later), but unlike leucoplakia it can be scraped off with
a spatula. Usually candidiasis is found in neonates,
secondary to immunosuppression or a disturbance in
the natural flora (e.g. after broad-spectrum antibiotic
therapy). Therefore, these commensals can act as
opportunists.
Candidiasis is common in acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients, in whom it may also
cause lesions in the oesophagus.
Oral infections respond well to nystatin, or oral fluconazole. Systemic infections require parenteral therapy
with amphotericin or ketoconazole for up to 3 weeks.

Aphthous ucers
Aphthous ulcers have a grey/white centre with a haemorrhagic rim, and usually heal spontaneously within
a few days. Ulcers can occur for a number of reasons.
The most common are minor aphthous ulcers, which
recur, but have an unknown aetiology.
Sometimes nutritional deficiencies are found, such
as iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 (with or without
gastrointestinal disorders). Trauma to the oral mucosa,
infections and some drugs, e.g. antimalarials and methyldopa can also cause ulcers. Ulceration is also associated with inflammatory bowel disease and coeliac
disease.

Glossitis
Glossitis is inflammation of the tongue. It may occur in
anaemia and certain other deficiency states, most notably vitamin B12 deficiency. It also occurs after trauma to
the mouth from badly fitting dentures, jagged teeth,
burns or the ingestion of corrosive substances.
The combination of glossitis, iron deficiency anaemia and an oesophageal web causing dysphagia occurs
in Plummer–Vinson syndrome (Paterson–Brown–Kelly
syndrome), most commonly seen in women with iron
deficiency.

Sialadenitis
Sialadenitis is inflammation of the salivary glands. This
uncommon condition may be caused by infection or
obstruction of salivary ducts. Mumps (infectious parotitis) can also be the cause. Individuals with reduced
amounts of saliva, e.g. in Sjögren’s syndrome are at increased risk of sialadenitis due to saliva’s antibacterial
properties.

The oesophagus

Oral manifestations of systemic disorders
Many infections, dermatological conditions, haematological diseases and other disorders can present with
oral manifestations.
As previously mentioned, ulcers can be indicative of
inflammatory bowel disease. Other systemic diseases
presenting this way include systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet’s disease, cyclic neutropenia and immunodeficiency disorders.

Neoplastic disease
Premalignant and benign neoplasms
of the mouth
These include:
• Leucoplakia (hyperkeratosis and hyperplasia of
squamous epithelium) – a premalignant condition
that takes its name from the Greek for ‘white patches’
and is associated with excess alcohol, poor dental
hygiene and, in particular, smoking
• Erythroplakia (dysplastic leucoplakia) – lesions
which have a higher malignant potential than
leucoplakia
• Squamous papilloma (nipple-like growth) and condyloma acuminatum (raised wart-like growth) –
these are both associated with human papilloma
viruses 6 and 11 and they are largely benign.
Leucoplakia and erythroplakia are more common in
men, particularly those aged between 40 and 70 years.

Malignant tumours of the mouth
In the UK, malignant tumours of the mouth account for
1% of all malignancies. Squamous cell carcinoma is by
far the most common malignant tumour (95%); however, adenocarcinoma, melanomas and other malignant tumours may occur.
Alcohol and smoking predispose to squamous cell
carcinoma; chewing tobacco even more so. Mouth cancer is twice as common in men as in women. The risk of
a drinker who smokes developing squamous cell carcinoma is about 15 times that of the rest of the population. Cancers are commonly found on routine dental
examination.
Squamous cell carcinoma may arise in areas of leucoplakia and also on the lip, where it is associated with
exposure to sunlight.
Lesions are investigated with a biopsy, and treatment
is by radiotherapy and/or surgery.

2

gland and pleomorphic adenomas are the most common, accounting for two thirds of all salivary tumours.
An adenoma is a benign epithelial growth derived from
glandular tissue. Only 15% of pleomorphic adenomas
(mixed tumours) become malignant.
Warthin’s tumour (an adenolymphoma) is a tumour
of the parotid salivary gland. It contains both epithelial
and lymphoid tissues, with cystic spaces. It accounts for
5–10% of all salivary gland neoplasms.

THE OESOPHAGUS
The oesophagus is a fibromuscular tube, approximately
25 cm in length, extending from the pharynx to the
stomach. It is composed of two layers; an outer longitudinal layer and an inner circular muscular layer. Its primary function is to convey food and fluids from the
pharynx to the stomach during swallowing. It has cervical, thoracic and abdominal parts.

Anatomy
The oesophagus begins in the neck, at the inferior border of the cricoid cartilage, where it is continuous with
the pharynx (Fig. 2.14). Initially it inclines to the left,
but is moved medially by the aortic arch at the level
of T4. Inferior to the arch, it inclines to the left and
passes through the diaphragm just left of the median
plane.
In the superior mediastinum, it lies anterior to the first
four thoracic vertebrae and posterior to the trachea, left
main bronchus and the left recurrent laryngeal nerve.
At the level of T5, the oesophagus moves forward and
to the left, accompanied by the right and left vagi to
descend behind the fibrous pericardium and in front

Apart from the physiological lower oesophageal
sphincter, the other factors which help prevent reflux
of gastric contents are the abdominal pressure acting

oesophagus and the stomach, the pinch-cock effect of
the diaphragm on the lower oesophagus and the pluglike action of the mucosal folds.

of the descending aorta. The oesophagus enters the abdomen through the oesophageal hiatus in the muscular
part of the diaphragm, at the level of T10.
The abdominal part of the oesophagus is only about
2 cm long. It joins the stomach at the cardiac orifice, at
the level of T11 (Fig. 2.15) and just posterior to the 7th
costal cartilage. This part is also covered by peritoneum
and encircled by the oesophageal plexus of nerves.
HINTS AND TIPS
Impressions or constrictions in the thoracic part of the
oesophagus are made by the arch of the aorta, the
point where the left main bronchus crosses the
diaphragm as it passes through the oesophageal hiatus.
This is a popular exam question!

Blood supply is from the inferior thyroid artery,
branches of the thoracic aorta and branches of the left
gastric artery and left inferior phrenic artery (both ascend from the abdominal cavity).

Venous drainage
Venous drainage is to both the systemic circulation (by
the inferior thyroid and azygos veins) and the hepatic
portal system (by the left gastric vein). It is a site of
portosystemic anastomosis (see later).

Innervation
The oesophagus is supplied by the vagus nerve and the
splanchnic nerves (thoracic sympathetic trunks).
Striated muscle in the upper part is supplied by somatic motor neurons of the vagus nerve from the nucleus ambiguus, without synaptic interruption.
The smooth muscle of the lower part is innervated by
visceral motor neurons of the vagus nerve that synapse
with postganglionic neurons, whose cell bodies lie in
the wall of the oesophagus and the splanchnic plexus.
The oesophagus is also encircled by nerves of the oesophageal plexus.

Embryology and development
The oesophagus has two sphincters:
• The upper oesophageal sphincter, which is a striated
muscular (anatomical) sphincter and part of the
cricopharyngeus muscle. It is normally constricted
to prevent air entering the oesophagus
• The lower oesophageal sphincter, which is a physiological sphincter and made up of the lower 2–3 cm
of oesophageal smooth muscle. This is the intraabdominal segment of oesophagus. It acts as a flap

24

At about 4 weeks of gestation, the respiratory diverticulum (lung bud) begins to form at the ventral wall of the
foregut. The diverticulum becomes separated from the
dorsal part of the foregut by the oesophagotracheal
septum (Fig. 2.16).
The dorsal portion of the foregut becomes the oesophagus, which, although short initially, lengthens with the
descent of the heart and lungs. The ventral portion becomes the respiratory primordium and the surrounding
mesenchyme forms the oesophageal muscle layers.

Histology
The layers of the oesophagus are essentially the same as
in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 2.17).
The serosa covers the oesophagus inside the abdominal cavity. In the neck and thorax it is referred to as the
adventitia, and blends with the surrounding connective
tissue. The muscularis externa consists of an outer longitudinal and an inner circular layer, like the rest of the
gastrointestinal tract.
The upper third of the oesophagus is striated
muscle (a continuation of the muscular layer of the

pharynx – the lowest part of cricopharyngeus forms
the upper oesophageal sphincter). Striated muscle predominates here as the buccal phase of swallowing is voluntary, unlike the subsequent phases. The middle third
is made up of both striated and smooth muscle, while
the lower third is entirely smooth muscle.
The submucosa contains numerous branched tubular glands, more abundant in the upper region, which
produce mucus to lubricate the oesophagus. These are
seromucous glands which are similar to the salivary
glands. The submucosa also contains blood vessels,
lymphatics and nerves in abundance.
The mucosa is lined by thick, non-keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and has a lamina propria similar to that in other parts of the body, but the muscularis
mucosa is thicker than in the rest of the digestive tract.
When relaxed, the mucosa is heavily folded. This allows
for a great degree of distension when food is swallowed.
In the abdominal part, the mucosa is lined by columnar epithelium similar to that of the gastric cardiac region.
This is the squamo-columnar junction. In reflux disease
(see later), where the squamous epithelium of the lower
oesophagus is exposed to gastric acid, the squamocolumnar junction moves higher up the oesophagus.

Congenital abnormalities
Atresia and tracheo-oesophageal fistulae
Atresia is the congenital absence or narrowing of a body
opening. A fistula is an abnormal connection between
two epithelial-lined surfaces (Fig. 2.18).

Atresia should be suspected in a fetus where there is
polyhydramnios (abnormally large amounts of amniotic fluid, i.e. over 2 L). Normally a fetus swallows
amniotic fluid and some fluid is reabsorbed into the fetal circulation. Where there is atresia, the fetus cannot
swallow, amniotic fluid is not reabsorbed and excess
fluid thus accumulates, causing a distended uterus.
Treatment of atresia and fistulae is by surgery, with
survival rates of more than 85%.

Agensis
This is the complete absence of an oesophagus and it is
much rarer than atresia or fistula. Treatment is surgical.

Stenosis
Stenosis is the abnormal narrowing of a passage or
opening.
Congenital stenosis may occur, but acquired stenosis
is more common (see later). Congenital stenosis is
caused by incomplete recanalization during week 8,
or from failure of development of blood vessels to the
affected area. Usually the distal third is affected.

Inflammatory disease

<1%

Oesophagitis (inflammation of the oesophagus) usually
presents as heartburn, and may be acute or chronic.
Chronic oesophagitis is usually due to gastro-oesophageal
reflux disease (GORD), which is common.

Acute oesophagitis

Fig. 2.18 Different forms of oesophageal atresia and fistulae
and their frequencies.

Atresia is a common condition, affecting 1/3000
births, and is caused by a failure of the oesophageal
endoderm to grow quickly enough when the embryo
elongates in week 5.
In 90% of cases, oesophageal atresia and tracheooesophageal fistula occur together, but either may occur
without the other.
In the most common form of atresia, the upper part
of the oesophagus has a blind ending but the lower end
forms a fistulous opening into the trachea. This means
that the infant cannot swallow milk or saliva and the diagnosis becomes apparent shortly after birth. The infant
is at risk of aspiration pneumonia and of fluid and
electrolyte imbalances.

26

Acute oesophagitis is more common in immunocompromised individuals, for example in HIV infection.
Oral and oesophageal candidiasis are common in
AIDS patients, and may cause dysphagia or retrosternal
discomfort. They give rise to white plaques with
haemorrhagic margins.
Other causes are HSV and cytomegalovirus (CMV),
which may also cause focal or diffuse ulceration of the
gut. HSV ulceration is more common at the upper and
lower ends of the gastrointestinal tract while CMV lesions
are more common in the bowel, but either may affect any
part of the tract from the mouth to the anus.
Acute oesophagitis may also be caused by the deliberate or accidental swallowing of corrosive substances.

Gastro-oespophageal reflux disease
(GORD)
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is the reflux
of acidic gastric content through the lower oesophageal
sphincter. As mentioned earlier, it is the commonest
cause of chronic oesophagitis and is highly prevalent,
occurring in 30% of the general population.

Disorders of the oesophagus

2

Aetiology

Complications

Factors associated with GORD are:

The squamous mucosa of the lower oesophagus is not
designed to cope with acid. Therefore, reflux causes
injury to, and desquamation of, oesophageal cells. Normally the cells shed from the surface of the epithelium are
replaced by basal cells, which mature and move up
through the layers of squamous epithelium. Increased
loss due to reflux is compensated for by a proliferation
of basal cells (basal cell hyperplasia) (Fig. 2.19).
Ulcers form if basal cell formation cannot keep pace
with cell loss. These may haemorrhage, perforate, or heal
by fibrosis (sometimes forming a stricture) and epithelial
regeneration. The premalignant disorder, Barrett’s
oesophagus (described in neoplastic disease), may also
result.

•

Pregnancy or obesity
Fat, chocolate, coffee or alcohol ingestion
Large meals
Cigarette smoking
Anticholinergic drugs, calcium channel antagonists
and nitrate drugs
• Hiatus hernia (see later).

Pathophysiology
One or more of the following mechanisms implicate the
pathogenesis:
• The resting LOS tone is low or absent
• The LOS tone fails to increase when lying flat, or when
the intra-abdominal pressure has increased, e.g.
during pregnancy or while wearing tight clothing
• Poor oesophageal peristalsis leads to reduced clearance of acid in the oesophagus
• A hiatus hernia can impair the function of the LOS
and the diaphragm closure mechanism, as the pressure gradient between the abdominal and thoracic
cavities is diminished
• Delayed gastric emptying increases the chance of
reflux.

Clinical features
Most patients will complain of heartburn and ‘acid regurgitation’. Some patients may be woken up at night
if refluxed fluid irritates the larynx. Dysphagia and chest
pain may be other presenting symptoms.

Investigations
In most cases, the diagnosis can be made clinically and
no investigation is required. In atypical cases or if there
is dysphagia, gastroscopy is the investigation of choice.
Other options include a barium swallow and oesophageal pH monitoring may be required in exceptional
circumstances.

Treatment
Treatment for GORD includes losing weight, raising the
head of the bed at night so that the patient does not lie
flat, and taking antacids. A reduction in the consumption
of alcohol or other foods which precipitate an attack, as
well as cessation of smoking is usually advised too.
The reduction of acid production can be achieved by
using proton pump inhibitors and H2-receptor antagonists (see Chapter 3).
Metoclopromide, a motility stimulant (see Chapter 5),
may enhance peristalsis and help acid clearance in the
oesophagus.
Antireflux surgery (fundoplication) may be carried
out in patients who fail to respond to medical treatment.

Diseases associated with motor
dysfunction
Motor dysfunction may be caused by:
• A failure of innervation
• A defect in the muscle wall of the oesophagus
• A combination of the two above.

Achalasia
Achalasia is an uncommon condition (prevalence
1/100 000 in Western populations) which can present
at any age, but it is rare in childhood. It involves the loss
of coordinated peristalsis of the lower oesophagus and
spasm of the lower oesophageal sphincter, thereby preventing the passage of food and liquids into the stomach.
The aetiology is unknown. It may be caused by damage to the innervation of the oesophagus, for example in
Chagas’ disease, where trypanosomes invade the wall of
the oesophagus, damaging the intrinsic plexuses.
Degenerative lesions are found in the vagus nerve
with a loss of ganglionic cells of the myenteric nerve plexus in the oesophageal wall. Two thirds of patients
with achalasia have autoantibodies to a dopaminecarrying protein on the surface of the cells in the myenteric plexus.
Diagnosis is by radiography. A barium swallow
shows dilatation of the oesophagus, with a beak deformity at the lower end, caused by a failure of relaxation of
the lower oesophageal sphincter. Manometry shows an
absence of peristalsis and a high resting lower oesophageal sphincter pressure.
The patient usually has a long history of sporadic
dysphagia for both solids and liquids. Regurgitation
of food is common, especially at night. Retrosternal
chest pain is felt, due to the vigorous non-peristaltic
contractions of the oesophagus.
Treatment consists of endoscopic balloon dilatation
of the lower oesophageal sphincter or surgery (Heller’s

Reflux is common after surgery unless a fundoplication
is also performed.
Achalasia is a risk factor for squamous carcinoma of
the oesophagus.

Hiatus hernia
Hiatus hernia describes the herniation of part of the
stomach through the diaphragm. It is a common condition, occurring in 30% of those over the age of 50, most
frequently in parous women.
Hernias can be sliding, where the gastro-oesophageal
junction slides through the hiatus and lies above the diaphragm, or rolling (para-oesophageal), where a part of
the fundus of the stomach rolls up through the hernia
next to the oesophagus (Fig. 2.20). Sliding hernias are
more common.
Symptoms are usually associated with reflux, but
many are asymptomatic.

28

Rolling hernias usually require surgical correction to
prevent strangulation.

Diverticula
Diverticula (out-pouchings) may form in the proximal
or distal oesophagus, particularly where there is a disorder of motor function in the oesophagus. They may be
due to pulsion, where pressure is raised due to muscle
spasm, or to traction, where the diverticula result from
‘pulling’ due to fixation to other structures.
Pharyngeal pouches are more common in elderly
men. Food may collect in the pouch and later be regurgitated. Dysphagia (see Chapter 8) is common. A swelling may be felt in the neck. Pharyngeal pouches are the
only common diverticula of the oesophagus. Diagnosis
is by barium swallow and treatment is surgical.
A traction diverticulum, which is very rare, may form
in the lower oesophagus, particularly where fibrosis of
the lower oesophagus has occurred.

Vascular disorders
Oesophageal varices
Oesophageal varices are dilated veins at the junction of
the oesophagus and the stomach. This is a site of a connection between the systemic and portal venous systems
(portosystemic anastomosis; see Chapter 6).
Normally, the connections are closed, but in patients
with cirrhosis of the liver and portal hypertension the
raised pressure in the portal system causes them to open
up and enlarge.
The enlarged veins protrude into the lumen of the
lower oesophagus (visible on endoscopy). They may
burst, resulting in haematemesis, which may rapidly
be fatal. Oesophageal varices account for 10% of upper
gastrointestinal bleeding but a higher proportion of
associated mortality.

Cirrhosis is the cause of 90% of varices in the UK, but
schistosomiasis (bilharzia) causing non-cirrotic prehepatic portal hypertension is the major worldwide
cause. Portal vein occlusion associated with pancreatitis
or umbilical vein sepsis results in left-sided portal
hypertension.
The management of acute variceal bleeding requires
resuscitation involving restoring blood volume and
taking measures to stop the bleeding. Urgent endoscopy is required and vasoconstrictor drugs (e.g. terlipressin and octreotide, a somatostatin analogue) can
be given.
Sclerotherapy and elastic band ligation are widely
used techniques to stem the loss of blood. Both are performed by endoscopy and can help prevent rebleeding.
Sclerotherapy involves injecting the varices with a sclerosing agent to produce vessel thrombosis and arrest

29

The upper gastrointestinal tract
bleeding. Banding involves placing a tight-fitting elastic
band around the varix to stop it bleeding.
Patients are often put on a beta-blocker (e.g. propranolol or carvedilol), a prophylactic measure to prevent further variceal bleeds by lowering portal blood
pressure and reducing portal blood flow.
Prognosis following bleeding varices is dependent
on aetiology and liver function: excellent in portal vein
thrombosis and poor for Child’s C cirrhosis particularly
when jaundice, ascites, encephalopathy or hypoalbuminaemia may be present. Overall, mortality from a first
bleed from oesophageal varices is 40%.

Mallory–Weiss syndrome
Mallory–Weiss syndrome is haematemesis from a tear at
the gastro-oesophageal junction (a Mallory–Weiss tear).
It is caused by prolonged retching or coughing and a
sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure. It is most
common following violent retching associated with
binge drinking.

Neoplastic disease
Premalignant – Barrett’s oesophagus
Barrett’s oesophagus is a premalignant condition resulting from prolonged reflux of the acid contents of the
stomach into the oesophagus through an incompetent
lower oesophageal sphincter. It occurs in approximately
15% of symptomatic cases of reflux and is most commonly seen in middle-aged men.
Normally the epithelium of the lower oesophagus is
squamous but in cases of prolonged injury the normal
epithelium may be replaced by columnar epithelium,
which is covered by mucin (a metaplastic change). This
is believed to occur as an adaptation to prolonged injury
to the lower oesophagus. This metaplastic change may
be followed by dysplastic change, which predisposes
to malignant transformation. It is a histological diagnosis made on biopsies taken at endoscopy.
Endoscopy is the investigation of choice to visualize
the columnar epithelium, with biopsies taken to confirm the diagnosis histalogically.
Treatment is with proton pump inhibitors long
term to prevent acid reflux. Patients are offered regular
endoscopies for surveillance, and if high-grade dysplasia
persists then an oesophagectomy is often recommended.
For patients who are unfit for surgery they may be offered
epithelial laser ablation or photodynamic therapy.
Adenocarcinoma is 30–40 times more likely to occur
in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus.

30

Benign tumours
These are much less common than malignant tumours
and account for only about 5% of all neoplasms of the
oesophagus.
Leiomyomas are the most common of benign tumours but fibromas, lipomas, haemangiomas, neurofibromas and lymphangiomas may also arise.

Malignant tumours
Cancer of the oesophagus is the eighth most common
cancer in the world. It is found mainly in people
60–70 years of age.
Cancers in the upper third of the oesophagus are very
rare. Tumours of the middle third are mainly squamous
cell carcinomas and these account for 40% of oesophageal malignancy (Fig. 2.21). Tumours in the lower third
are adenocarcinomas, which comprise 45% of malignancies. These have usually developed from Barrett’s
oesophagus.
Clinical manifestations of oesophageal malignancies
begin with persistent dysphagia, which is progressive
from liquids to solids, and weight loss. Anorexia and
lymphadenopathy are also common.
Unfortunately, by the time symptoms are present,
the carcinoma has usually spread and the 5-year survival
is only about 5%. Treatment is mainly palliative
and consists of surgery, radiotherapy and endoscopic
placement of an oesophageal stent.

disease, vascular disease and neoplastic disease

OVERVIEW
The stomach is a mobile, muscular organ that mixes
food with digestive juices to form chyme. It receives
food and fluid from the oesophagus, and releases its
contents into the duodenum. Gastric contents are broken down both by the churning action of the stomach
and by being squirted through the narrow pylorus.
The stomach acts as a reservoir for food as it is very
distensible, with a capacity of up to 2–3 L. The wall of
the stomach is impermeable to most substances, but alcohol, water, salts and some drugs may be absorbed
through it. Most other substances are absorbed from
more distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract.

ANATOMY
The stomach lies between the oesophagus proximally
and the duodenum distally. It is J-shaped normally and
varies widely in size and shape depending on body habitus, the food content and the posture of the body.
Anatomically, the stomach is divided into four parts
(Fig. 3.1):
• Cardia – the region around the oesophagus. The
cardiac orifice normally lies posterior to the 7th left
costal cartilage at the level of T10 or T11 vertebra
• Fundus – the superior part of the stomach, it lies
above the imaginary horizontal plane passing
through the cardiac orifice. Usually it is found posterior to the left 5th rib in themid-clavicular line

• Body – this lies between the fundus and the antrum,
and is the largest part of the stomach
• Pyloric part – this comprises the pyloric antrum and
the narrower pyloric canal. It lies in the imaginary
transpyloric plane at the level of L1 vertebra to the
right of the angular notch (incisura angularis),
which is the junction between the body and the
pyloric part.
There are two sphincters at each of the gastric orifices.
The physiological lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS)
protects the oesophagus from reflux of the acidic gastric
contents. The anatomical pyloric sphincter controls the
flow of gastric contents into the duodenum.
The cardiac (gastro-oesophageal) orifice of the
stomach lies behind the 7th left costal cartilage about
2–4 cm to the left of the median plane. The pylorus,
which is the distal sphincteric region, has a variable location from L2–L4 vertebrae, but usually lies 1 cm to
the right of the midline, in or below the transpyloric
planes. It is joined to the cardiac orifice by the lesser
curvature. The position of the greater curvature varies
greatly. Fig. 3.2 shows the surface markings of the
stomach.

Relations
The anterior surface is in contact with:
• The diaphragm (in the fundal region)
• The anterior abdominal wall
• The left lobe of the liver.
The spleen lies posterolateral to the fundus.

covered by peritoneum except where blood vessels
run on the curvatures and in a small area posterior to
the cardiac orifice. The peritoneum is reflected at the
greater curvature as the greater omentum. This is a fatladen, apron-like double layer of peritoneum hanging
off the stomach and the inferior border of the first part
of the duodenum. It has a remarkable ability to stick to
damaged or perforated parts of the gastrointestinal tract,
sealing off leaks and giving some protection against
peritonitis.
Excess fat may be stored in the greater omentum, especially in men, who have different distributions of
fat from women. This is how the infamous beer belly
came to be!
The lesser omentum is made up of peritoneum
reflected at the lesser curvature to extend to the liver.
The mucosa of the stomach is folded into large longitudinal rugae, which can be seen on radiographs after a
barium meal. These permit the stomach to distend.

The diaphragm, left adrenal gland, upper part of the
left kidney, splenic artery, pancreas, transverse mesocolon and, in some people, the transverse colon lie posteriorly forming the stomach bed. They are separated
from the stomach by the omental bursa (lesser sac of

Blood supply
There is a rich blood supply to the stomach (Fig. 3.3),
derived from three branches of the coeliac trunk:
• The left gastric artery supplies both anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach, running along the
lesser curvature
• The splenic artery follows a tortuous route across the
posterior abdominal wall along the upper border of
the pancreas. It gives rise to the left gastroepiploic
(gastro-omental) artery, which runs along the

greater curvature and anastomoses with the right
gastroepiploic artery. Additionally, short gastric arteries to the fundus arise from the distal end of the
splenic artery
• The common hepatic artery gives rise to the right gastric artery and the gastroduodenal artery. The gastroduodenal artery passes behind the first part of the
duodenum and gives rise to the right gastroepiploic
and the superior pancreaticoduodenal arteries.

HINTS AND TIPS
Remember, there is a gastroduodenal artery that gives
rise to the right gastroepiploic and superior
pancreaticoduodenal arteries, but there is no
gastroduodenal vein!

Venous drainage
The stomach drains, like most of the alimentary system,
to the hepatic portal system. The gastric veins accompany the arteries, and drainage of specific veins is as
follows:
• The right and left gastric veins drain into the portal
vein itself
• The short gastric and left gastroepiploic veins drain
into the splenic vein and its tributaries

• The right gastroepiploic vein usually drains into the
superior mesenteric vein
• Oesophageal tributaries of the left gastric vein form
an important porto-caval anastomosis with tributaries of the azygos vein in the thorax.

Lymphatic drainage
The lymphatics also follow the distribution of the arteries. There are four major groups of lymph nodes:
•
•
•
•

The

The

left gastric nodes
pancreaticosplenic nodes
right gastroepiploic nodes
pyloric nodes.

Lymph drains from the anterior and posterior surfaces
of the stomach towards its curvatureswhere many of
the gastroepiploic nodes are situated.
These nodes all drain to the coeliac nodes and then to
the cisterna chyli. From the cisterna chyli, lymph drains
to the thoracic duct, which is the largest lymphatic vessel
in the body.
HINTS AND TIPS
Knowledge of the lymphatic drainage is essential as in
gastric carcinoma, the lymphatic drainage can spread
metastases to the liver, pelvis and the rest of the body
via the thoracic duct.

The stomach

Nerve supply
The stomach is supplied by both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.

Sympathetic supply
The sympathetic supply is from the autonomic coeliac
plexus through the periarterial plexus, which runs along
the arteries of the stomach. Presynaptic sympathetic
fibres come from the splanchnic nerves (from T6 to
T9 of the spinal cord).
It causes vasoconstriction of the gastric blood vessels, relaxation of the gastric muscles and decreased activity of gastric glands. These also carry pain fibres from the stomach.

Parasympathetic supply
The parasympathetic supply is from the vagus nerve
(Xth cranial nerve). Anterior and posterior vagal trunks
from the oesophageal plexus pass through the diaphragm with the oesophagus and divide into anterior
and posterior gastric branches on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach. Posterior branches contribute to the coeliac plexus.
Gastric branches form Auerbach’s and Meissner’s intrinsic plexuses (described in the section on gastric histology). Up-regulation of parasympathetic innervation
causes an increase in gastric motility and secretion.
Fig. 3.4 Development of the
stomach. The stomach rotates 90
around its longitudinal axis, causing
the left vagus to innervate the left,
anterior, surface and the right vagus
to innervate the right, posterior,
surface. The longitudinal rotation also
causes the formation of the space
behind and to the left of the stomach,
called the omental bursa (lesser sac),
which is continuous with the coelomic
cavity behind the stomach.

EMBRYOLOGY AND
DEVELOPMENT
The stomach develops from a fusiform dilatation of
the foregut, which appears around the middle of
week 4 of gestation (Fig. 3.4). Its appearance and
position change greatly during development as it
rotates around both a longitudinal and an anteroposterior axis.
The posterior wall grows faster than the anterior wall
over the following 2 weeks and forms the greater and
lesser curvatures.
The stomach rotates 90 clockwise as it enlarges.
There are three major consequences of this rotation:
• The greater curvature shifts to the left and
the lesser curvature shifts to the right. The left side
therefore forms the anterior surface and the
right side the posterior surface. This explains why
the left vagus nerve innervates the anterior surface
while the right vagus nerve supplies the posterior
surface
• The cranial region becomes situated at the left and
slightly inferiorly, while the converse is true for the
caudal region. Before rotation, both the cranial
and caudal ends are in the median plane
• The long axis of the stomach becomes almost parallel with the long axis of the body.

Histology

HISTOLOGY
All parts of the stomach have the same basic structural
layers (Fig. 3.5):
•
•
•
•

Mucosa
Submucosa
Muscularis externa
Serosa.

Mucosa
The mucosa and submucosa are folded into longitudinal rugae when the stomach is empty. The mucosal surface is lined with simple columnar epithelium (which
has a lifespan of about 1 week) and forms numerous
gastric pits which are openings for the gastric glands.
The mucous cells lining the gastric lumen secrete mucus
as well as bicarbonate ions (HCO3  ).
The depth of the gastric mucosa is divided into three
histological zones
• A superficial zone (including the isthmus of the
gland)
• A neck zone
• A deep zone.
The upper superficial zone is composed of surface
mucous cells with openings to the gastric pits, while
the gland isthmus comprises mainly parietal cells.

The neck zone, between the superficial and deep
zones, is composed of mostly immature stem cells, but
has some neck mucous cells and parietal cells. The immature stem cells eventually proliferate and move upwards
to replace mucous cells in the superficial zone.
HINTS AND TIPS
Stem cells are very important in the cell regeneration
and healing of a gastric ulcer.

In the deep zone, glands are found. While the basic
structure of any gastric gland is broadly similar, they
also vary in structure according to where they are situated. Each of the three main areas of the stomach – the
cardiac, fundus and body and the pyloric regions – have
their own arrangement of gland. The predominant cell
types also vary according to region:
• Cardiac glands are predominantly composed of
mucus-secreting cells
• Glands in the fundus and body consist mostly of
acid-secreting parietal cells and pepsin-secreting
chief cells, along with some mucus-secreting cells
• Pyloric glands are mostly composed of mucussecreting cells and neuroendocrine cells which
secrete the hormone gastrin.

The stomach

Submucosa
This is made up of collagen, fibroblasts and acellular
matrix with blood vessels, nerves and lymphatics. It also
contains autonomic ganglion cells and lymphoid aggregates, which make up the gut-associated lymphoid
tissue (GALT). This structure is consistent throughout
the digestive tract.

Muscularis externa
Unlike the rest of the GI tract where the muscularis
externa consists of two muscular coats, the gastric muscularis externa is comprised of three layers of smooth
muscle:
• An outer longitudinal muscle layer (absent from
much of the anterior and posterior surfaces of the
stomach)
• A middle circular muscle layer (poorly developed in
the paraoesophageal region)
• An inner oblique muscle layer.

Serosa
This consists of an inner layer of connective tissue and
an outer layer of simple squamous epithelium. It is also
known as the visceral peritoneum and allows for
frictionless movement of organs within their cavities.

Gastric glands
As mentioned above, gastric glands vary according to
their location, there are three main types (gastric glands,
cardiac glands and pyloric glands) which correspond
roughly to the anatomical regions of the stomach.

B12 absorption. Parietal cells are absent in achlorhydria (‘absence of acid’); thus, no intrinsic factor
is produced in this condition, which if prolonged
will cause vitamin B12 deficiency and a macrocytic
anaemia. Their internal appearance changes when
food has been eaten (Fig. 3.6)
• Chief (zymogen) cells – These are found in the deepest
part of gastric glands and are typical proteinsecreting cells. They secrete pepsinogen, the inactive
precursor of pepsin (a proteolytic enzyme), which is
converted to pepsin by acid. They are rich in mitochondria, Golgi bodies and RER, which are required
for the production of pepsinogen. Histologically,
they have condensed nuclei which are basally located, and highly basophilic cytoplasm due to their
numerous ribosomes
• Neuroendocrine (enteroendocrine) cells – These are also
called APUD cells (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation cells) and are part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system. They are found on the epithelial
basement membrane and secrete peptide hormonal
substances, such as vasoactive intestinal polypeptide
(VIP) and somatostatin. In the gastric region, the
most common type of endocrine cell is the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell. These are 20 times smaller than parietal cells and secrete histamine into the
lamina propria of the mucosa
• Undifferentiated stem cells – Stem cells are precursors
of all the mucosal epithelial cells. When undifferentiated, they show no cytoplasmic specialization and
are capable of becoming any of the cell types present
in the gastric mucosal glands. They are usually located in the neck zone. Histologically, they are most
easily identified in mucosal sections by their mitotic
figures after mucosal damage, as this is when they divide most actively.

Gastric (body or fundic) glands
These are the most numerous and contain several types
of cell:
• Mucous neck cells – These are found just below the
gastric pits and contain numerous mucigen granules,
a well-developed Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticula (RER). They are tall and columnar
in shape, and secrete HCO3  ions into the mucous
lining of the stomach wall
• Parietal (oxyntic) cells – These are found deeper than
mucous neck cells and are most plentiful in the
gland isthmus. They are pyramidal cells which look
triangular or rounded in section, with the apex
pointing towards the gland lumen, and have a central spherical nucleus, which gives them a ‘friedegg’ appearance. Parietal cells have eosinophilic
cytoplasm and contain numerous mitochondria to
provide energy for HCl production. They secrete
HCl and intrinsic factor, which is needed for vitamin

36

Cardiac glands
Cardiac glands are mostly mucus-secreting, coiled tubular glands, but they may be branched. The superficial
and deep zones are about equal in thickness. Some
undifferentiated stem cells are present in the neck region. Neuroendocrine (APUD) cells and parietal cells
are scattered throughout, increasing in number nearer
the junction with the body. The muscularis mucosae below the cardiac glands are thick and often interdigitate
with the glands.

Pyloric glands
The pyloric glands are coiled (but less so than cardiac
ones) and often branched, with the superficial zone being slightly thicker than the deep zone. They contain
mainly mucous cells, but they have parietal, enteroendocrine and stem cells scattered throughout.

Functions and physiology

Fig. 3.6 Morphological changes in
parietal cells. At rest, the parietal cells
have numerous tubulovesicles derived
from smooth endoplasmic reticulum
(SER). These contain H þ pumps and
do not connect with the apical surface
membrane. After stimulation of acid
secretion, the tubulovesicles merge
and become deep trough-like
invaginations of the apical surface,
called secretory canaliculi. These
communicate with the lumen of the
gland. The surface area is also
increased by numerous microvilli.

In particular, the enteroendocrine cells secrete gastrin
in this area. These cells are called G cells, because they
secrete gastrin. D cells, another type of enteroendocrine
cell, secrete somatostatin in paracrine fashion. Nearer
the pyloric sphincter, parietal cells become more
numerous. The cell types found in each region of the
stomach are summarized in Fig. 3.7.

respectively.
Nerve cells innervate hormone-secreting cells (see
next section) and all the muscle layers in the mucosa.

Nerve fibres

Storage of food

There are two major networks of intrinsic nerve fibres:

The stomach acts as a reservoir for food, releasing the
gastric contents into the duodenum at a steady rate.
Relaxation of the LOS and arrival of food in the stomach
is followed by a receptive relaxation of the fundus and
body of the stomach.
This is mediated by a vagal reflex, which inhibits
the smooth muscle tone in this area (via the vagal inhibitory fibres with release of VIP and nitric oxide).
The vagal inhibitory fibres cause relaxation by inducing
hyperpolarization.

• Auerbach’s (myenteric) plexus, between the inner
oblique and the middle circular muscle layer
• Meissner’s (submucous) plexus, between the inner
oblique muscle layer and the mucosa.
Both plexuses are interconnected and contain nerve
cells with processes that originate in the wall of the
gut or mucosa. The mucosa has mechanoreceptors
and chemoreceptors, which are sensitive to stretch of

The muscle wall is thinner in the fundus and body,
resulting in generally weaker muscle contractions than
in the antral area. These factors allow the fundus and
body of the stomach to store food and accommodate
up to 1.5 L without a marked increase in intragastric
pressure.
The muscles in the antral region contract vigorously,
mixing the food with gastric secretions to continue
digestion.
Food may remain in the stomach, unmixed, for up to
1 hour. Fats form an oily layer on top of other gastric
contents. A fatty meal delays gastric emptying but
liquids generally empty more quickly.

Gastric secretions
The average adult produces 2–3 L of gastric juice every
24 hours. Gastric juice contains mucus, digestive enzymes (pepsinogen and lipase), HCl and intrinsic factor.

Resting juice
Resting juice is an isotonic juice secreted by the surface
cells. It is similar to plasma, but it has an alkaline pH
of 7.7 and a higher concentration of HCO3  .

(gastrin is secreted in the
pyloric region)

Cardiac

These give rise to new cells to
replace the old mucosal and
glandular epithelial cells

Mucus
Mucus is secreted by goblet cells of the surface epithelium and mucus neck cells, especially in the pyloric
antrum.
The alkaline mucus of the stomach is a thick, sticky
mucopolysaccharide. It is secreted with HCO3  ions,
which are exchanged for Cl– ions by the epithelial cells.
It plays an important role in the protection of the stomach against its acid contents.
Mucus forms a water-insoluble gel that adheres to the
surface of the stomach lumen. It reduces the flow of Hþ
ions and acts as a barrier to pepsin. Although pepsin can
degrade mucus, the HCO3  secretions increase the pH
and make the enzyme less active.

Pepsin
Pepsin is secreted from the chief cells in the gastric
pits in the form of its precursor, pepsinogen. HCl activates pepsinogen by cleaving off nine amino acid
residues to form pepsin. Pepsin is a proteolytic enzyme
that acts on proteins and polypeptides, by hydrolysing
internal peptide bonds.

Functions and physiology

Lipase

secretion of the pyloric glands, duodenum, pancreas and bile
• Gastric motility
• The rate of gastric emptying
• The amount of diffusion back into the mucosa.

Gastric lipase is an enzyme that acts on triglycerides to
produce fatty acids and glycerol. It is useful in facilitating subsequent hydrolysis by pancreatic lipases, but it is
of little physiological importance except in pancreatic
insufficiency.

The pH of the contents of the stomach after feeding is
normally about 2–3.
Gastric HCl provides a defence mechanism that is
non-specific in killing ingested microorganisms. It also
aids protein digestion (by enabling the activation of
pepsin from pepsinogen) and stimulates the flow of bile
and pancreatic juice.
The secretion of HCl by parietal cells is stimulated
by histamine, acetylcholine and gastrin (Fig. 3.8). It is
also stimulated by caffeine, through the activation
of cyclic AMP. Both Hþ and Cl– are actively transported by different ion pumps in the parietal cell
membrane.

Intrinsic factor
Intrinsic factor (IF) is made in the parietal cells of the
stomach; it is a glycoprotein vital for the absorption
of vitamin B12 via receptors for IF-B12 in the terminal
ileum. Without intrinsic factor, vitamin B12 is digested
in the intestine and not absorbed.
R-proteins in the saliva and stomach protect vitamin
B12 until it is absorbed. Upon absorption, it is bound to
transcobalamin II, which serves to transport it in plasma.
Most diets contain excess vitamin B12 and stores are
built up in the liver. These stores last for 2–3 years;
thus, it takes considerable time for a dietary deficiency
to produce symptoms.

Clinical Note

Hydrochloric acid

Because alcohol and caffeine are substances
which promote the secretion of HCl, patients with
peptic ulcers or underlying gastric hypersecretion
should avoid beverages which contain these two
chemicals.

HCl is produced by the parietal (oxyntic) cells. The concentration of HCl depends on:
• The rate of HCl secretion
• The amount of buffering provided by the resting
juice, ingested food and drink and the alkaline

Secretion is inhibited by vagotomy (which removes
acetylcholine stimulation) and pharmacologically, the
latter of which is covered in the next section.

Pharmacology of gastric acid
secretion

However, no drugs which act on muscarinic or gastrin receptors are currently licensed for clinical use to
inhibit gastric acid secretion, although a muscarinic
blocker such as atropine will have this effect. Fig. 3.9
summarizes the relevant gastric pharmacology.

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs)

The key points to note are:
• The three main factors which stimulate acid production are gastrin, histamine and acetylcholine
• Acid secretion can be modified by extrinsic neural
factors (vagus nerve) and intrinsic neural reflexes
• The terminal step in the pathway is Hþ/Kþ-ATPase.
As such, these factors, or their receptors, are possible
sites of action for drugs which inhibit gastric acid secretion. There are also drugs which act to neutralize
secreted acid.

secretion and drugs which protect the
gastric mucosa. (GR ¼ gastrin receptor;
H2R ¼ histamine-2 receptor;

pump; cAMP ¼ cyclic AMP;

PPIs are irreversible inhibitors of Hþ/Kþ-ATPase, also
known as the proton pump. As stated above, the proton
pump is the final step in the acid-secretory pathway.
PPIs are so far the most effective and powerful drugs
in reducing gastric acid secretion. Examples of PPIs
are omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole.
PPIs are weak bases inactive at neutral pH, and
they therefore accumulate and are activated in the acidic
environment of the parietal cell canaliculi. This preferential accumulation causes PPIs to have a specific

effect on the parietal cells. They are the drug of choice in
drug-resistant peptic ulceration and in hypersecretion.

H2-receptor antagonists
These block H2-receptors on the gastric parietal
cell, preventing intracellular cAMP synthesis and thus
reducing acid secretion. Additionally, they also inhibit gastrin-stimulated acid secretion and decrease
acetylcholine-stimulated secretion, as a result of which
pepsin secretion also decreases due to the reduction in
volume. Common examples of H2-receptor antagonists
are cimetidine, ranitidine, nizatidine and famotidine.

Antacids
Antacids neutralize gastric acid and therefore cause a rise
in gastric pH. They thus cause inhibition of peptic activity, as secretion ceases at pH 5. Common antacids are
salts of aluminium and magnesium, for example aluminium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide.
Alginates may be combined with antacids, an example of which is Gaviscon. These are used in oesophageal
reflux. The alginic acid, when combined with saliva,
forms a raft which floats on the gastric contents, thus
protecting the oesophageal mucosa during reflux.

3

The gastric phase
This is the longest phase, lasting for up to 2½ hours after
the start of the meal. It is triggered by the presence of
food causing distension of the stomach, and the presence of amino acids and peptides (products of pepsin
degradation). Alcohol and caffeine are also prosecretory factors. Most acid secretion in response to a
meal takes place during the gastric phase.
Distension of the body or antrum of the stomach
stimulates mechanoreceptors that cause local (enteric)
and central vago-vagal cholinergic reflexes.
Amino acids and peptides activate vagal chemoreceptors and also antral G cells, which are sensitive to peptides. These secrete gastrin in response. Gastrin and
acetylcholine then activate ECL cells to produce histamine, which further increases acid secretion from the
parietal cells.
HINTS AND TIPS
Vago-vagal reflexes, as found in the gastric phase of
the control of gastric secretions, are so named because
both afferent and efferent impulses are carried by
neurons in the vagus nerve.

Control of gastric secretion

The intestinal phase

The control of gastric secretion is brought about by a
combination of nervous, hormonal and paracrine messages. There are three phases of stimulation (Fig. 3.10):

The intestinal phase is brought about by the presence of
chyme in the duodenum. It has both excitatory and inhibitory components. In the excitatory component,
amino acids and peptides in chyme stimulate intestinal
gastrin release. This is carried via the blood to the stomach and thus contributes to serum gastrin levels during
a meal.
The inhibitory phase, however, predominates, as the
same factors, i.e. acid (with a pH < 2), fat, hypertonicity
and distension have the following effects in the
duodenum:

• The cephalic phase
• The gastric phase
• The intestinal phase.

The cephalic phase
The cephalic phase is the shortest phase and is initiated
by the sight, smell and taste of food. It usually begins
before the meal and lasts up to 30 minutes into
the meal. This allows the stomach to prepare itself for
the imminent arrival of food.
It is mediated entirely by the vagus nerve, hence vagotomy of the stomach leads to cessation of the cephalic
phase and was performed in the past to reduce acid secretion before pharmacological means were available.
Acid secretion is up-regulated by acetylcholine (ACh)
released from neurons of the intramural plexus acting:
• Directly, by stimulation of the parietal cells
• Indirectly, by causing release of gastrin from antral G
cells, which stimulates the parietal cells too. The mediator at the G cell is gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP)
• Indirectly, by causing the release of histamine from
ECL cells, which also up-regulates acid production.

• Somatostatin is released from D cells. This acts directly on the parietal cells to inhibit acid secretion
• Acid mediates the release of secretin into the bloodstream. This inhibits the release of gastrin by G cells
and reduces the response of parietal cells to gastrin
• Fatty acids (from triglyceride digestion) in the duodenum and proximal jejunum cause the release of gastric
inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) and cholecystokinin
(CCK), which both act to inhibit secretion of acid
by parietal cells. GIP also suppresses gastrin release.
Secretin, GIP and CCK are collectively called enterogastrones, because they have an inhibitory effect on gastric
secretion. Hypertonic solutions in the duodenum also
suppress gastric secretion. This is mediated by an unidentified enterogastrone. The inhibition of gastric

secretions is also controlled by an enteric reflex, which is
integrated with higher controls from the medulla
oblongata.
The loss of volume in the stomach and the distension
of the duodenum (as chyme passes from one to the
other), both activate the local enteric reflex, via mechanoreceptors. Chemoreceptors in the duodenum can
also activate the reflex ion response to irritants, reduced
pH and hypertonic solutions. The mechanisms for
inhibiting acid secretion are summarized in Fig. 3.11.

Gastric motility and emptying
Gastric motility and emptying are carefully regulated to
ensure that chyme is delivered to the duodenum at a rate
at which it can be absorbed.

Gastric motility
Motility in the stomach is initially brought about by
reflex receptive relaxation, which allows food to enter
from the oesophagus. This process is mediated by vagal
inhibitory fibres.
Mixing of the food with gastric secretions follows
and takes place in the distal body and antrum of the
stomach (the caudal region). The muscularis externa
is thicker in this area of the stomach. The contractions
involved in mixing and emptying the stomach contents are brought about by the three smooth muscle
layers, which are coordinated by intrinsic and extrinsic
nerves.

The most prominent plexus is Auerbach’s plexus, situated in a three-dimensional matrix between the layers
of smooth muscle in the stomach wall. It receives innervation from both sympathetic and parasympathetic systems. Axons from the plexus innervate both muscle
fibres and glandular cells.
Interneurons connect intrinsic afferent sensory fibres
with efferent neurons of smooth muscle and secretory
cells, to ensure that gastric activity is fully coordinated,
even in the absence of external innervation. Cholinergic
(parasympathetic) stimulation from the vagus increases
gastric motility and secretion, but adrenergic (sympathetic) stimulation in the coeliac plexus has the opposite effect.

The mechanics of gastric motility
When the stomach is full of food, it undergoes a ‘lag’
phase. During this time, the stomach is not contracting,
but intense secretions are digesting the food down to basic components to form chyme. Once the lag phase is
over, there is a reversal of vagal discharge. There is an
up-regulation in vagal excitatory fibre activation and a
decrease in vagal inhibitory fibre activation.
The contractions break off small boluses of food, carrying them towards the pylorus. Large pieces of food are
refluxed back towards the gastric body for further degradation. This process is termed retropulsion and allows
for the thorough mixing and mechanical breakdown
of solid food material (Fig. 3.12).

Fig. 3.12 Effects of gastric peristaltic contractions on
intraluminal contents. (Redrawn with permission from
Johnson LR. Physiology of the Gastrointestinal Tract, 4th edn.
New York: Raven Press, 2000.)

The force and frequency of contractions depends on:
• The neural activity of intrinsic and extrinsic nerves
• The myogenic properties of smooth muscle
• The properties of paracrine and endocrine agents
(gastrin and motilin up-regulate the force of gastric
contraction, but secretin inhibits it).
HINTS AND TIPS
The cephalad region of the stomach (fundus and
corpus) is the area for storage and the caudad region
(distal corpus and antrum) is the area for mixing food.

The basic electrical rhythm of the stomach
The pacemaker zone of the stomach is located in the
fundus on the greater curvature. The cells in the pacemaker zone spontaneously depolarize, setting the basic
electrical rhythm (BER) of the stomach. This depolarization occurs continuously. Depending on the excitability
of the gastric smooth muscle at the time, the BER may
trigger large peristaltic contractions. These sweep down
towards the antrum where the amplitude of contraction
is greatest, due to its thicker muscle layers. The contractions occur at a rate of three per minute, and last
between 2 and 20 seconds (Fig. 3.13).

the stomach. (Redrawn with permission from Johnson LR.

Raven Press, 2000.)

the pyloric sphincter opens by a coordination of antral
and duodenal contractions. Small digested particles are
squirted through the sphincter into the duodenum.
The rate at which the stomach empties depends on:
• The type of food eaten. Carbohydrates are emptied
most quickly, proteins more slowly and fatty foods
even more so to ensure that food is released into
the duodenum at a rate at which it can be absorbed.
Fatty acids or monoglycerides in the duodenum decrease the rate of gastric emptying by increasing the
contractility of the pyloric sphincter. The presence of
acidic contents with a pH of less than about 3.5 in
the duodenum also slows gastric emptying
• The osmotic pressure of the contents of the duodenum.
Duodenal osmoreceptors initiate a decrease in gastric
emptying in response to hyperosmolar chyme
• Vagal innervation. Antral and duodenal overdistension
activates mechanoreceptors that stimulate a vagovagal reflex. This acts to inhibit gastric contractile
activity by vagal inhibitory fibres. Vagotomy results
in a marked decrease in the rate of gastric emptying
• The release of somatostatin, secretin, CCK and GIP by the
duodenum, in response to the presence of chyme.
These all inhibit gastric emptying.

Protection of the gastric mucosa

Gastric emptying

The gastric mucosa is frequently subjected to the corrosive secretions of HCl and pepsin. Several mechanisms
exist to prevent tissue damage by the gastric juices:

Emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum is part of
the continuum of gastric motility. As retropulsion occurs,

• Mucus, secreted by neck and surface mucous cells in
the body and fundus and similar cells elsewhere

44

Disorders of the stomach
in the stomach, forms a water-insoluble gel that
coats the mucosa. Prostaglandins stimulate mucus
production
• The surface cells secrete HCO3  which, together with the
mucus, forms an adherent layer. This raises the pH
around the mucus layer, thus making pepsin less
active and preventing the enzymes degrading the
mucus
• The surface membranes of the mucosal cells, the tight
junctions between them and the ability to form a fibrin
coat protect the cells
• Prostaglandins, especially those of the E and I series, inhibit acid secretion by enhancing blood flow to the
mucosa which in turn encourages mucus production.
HINTS AND TIPS
When the stomach is empty, it is small and relaxed.
Peristaltic contractions are weak, but as hunger sets in,
the muscle contractions increase in size and frequency.
The tetanic contractions last for 2–3 min. Hunger
pangs usually begin 12 hours after the previous meal.
Low blood sugar increases the contractions.

Several factors cause a breakdown of the mucosal
protection or an increase in acid production and predispose to gastric irritation and peptic ulceration:
• Acid secretion (from the parietal cells) is stimulated
by histamine, acetylcholineand gastrin (Fig. 3.8)
• Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and aspirin reduce mucus secretion and decrease bicarbonate secretion by inhibiting prostaglandin
production
• In the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, gastrin-secreting
adenomas result in marked hyperacidity. The adenomas are usually found in the pancreas and present as
gastric or duodenal ulcers. The syndrome is rare.
• Helicobacter pylori (see below)
• Hyperparathyroidism predisposes to ulcer formation
because increased levels of calcium stimulate acid
production
• Chronic exposure to nicotine from smoking causes
an increase in acid secretion.

Pharmacology of gastric mucosal
protection
As mentioned above, prostaglandins are protective
against gastric mucosal ulceration. Prostaglandin analogues have the same effect. Misoprostol, which is a stable analogue of PGE1, protects the mucosa by inhibiting
gastric acid secretion, enhancing or maintaining the
blood flow to the mucosa and increasing the secretion
of bicarbonate and mucus. It is used to prevent gastric

3

ulceration due to long-term use of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which also act
through the arachidonic acid/prostaglandin pathway.
Sucralfate is a complex of sulphated sucrose and
aluminium hydroxide. In acidic conditions under
pH 4, it forms a polymerized gel with mucus. The gel
is believed to decrease mucus degradation as well as
limit hydrogen ion diffusion. In addition, it stimulates
mucus and bicarbonate production as well as prostaglandin secretion.
Bismuth chelate protects the mucosa by coating the
bases of peptic ulcers, adsorbing pepsin and increasing bicarbonate and prostaglandin secretion. More
importantly, it has toxic effects on H. pylori and may
be used as part of triple therapy to eradicate the
bacterium.

Gastric defences against
infection
The stomach has a number of defence strategies. Gastric
acid and pepsin secretions act to kill aerobic microorganisms and other ingested bacteria, preventing infection of the gastric mucosa. Other factors preventing
infection include:
•
•
•
•
•

Mucus production
Peristalsis and fluid movement
Seamless epithelium with tight junctions
A fast cell turnover
IgA secretions at mucosal surfaces.

DISORDERS OF THE STOMACH

Congenital abnormalities
Diaphragmatic hernia
The diaphragm develops from:
•
•
•
•

The septum transversum
The pleuroperitoneal membranes
The dorsal mesentery of the oesophagus
Muscular components of the body wall.

The pleuroperitoneal folds appear at the beginning of
week 5. They fuse with the septum transversum and
the oesophageal mesentery in week 7, separating the
abdominal and thoracic cavities. This primitive diaphragm then fuses with a ring of muscle that develops
from the body wall.
If there is incomplete fusion, the contents of the abdomen may push up into the pleural cavity, forming a
diaphragmatic hernia (usually on the left side), pushing
the heart forwards and compressing the lungs. The incidence is about 1 in 2000 births and treatment is surgical.

45

The stomach

Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis
Pyloric stenosis (narrowing) occurs in about 1 in 150
male infants and 1 in 750 female infants. A genetic factor is involved.
Stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the circular
muscles of the pylorus, obstructing the pyloric canal
and the flow of contents from the stomach into the duodenum. Typically, it presents 4–6 weeks after birth with
projectile vomiting within half an hour of a feed. Note
that there is no bile in the vomit because the obstruction
is proximal to the ampulla of Vater.
Peristaltic waves are visible in the child, a sausageshaped mass (the enlarged pylorus) can be felt in the
right upper quadrant and the hypertrophied pyloric
muscle can be observed using ultrasonography. Treatment is surgical.
Stenosis may also be acquired in adult life, usually
caused by scarring from peptic ulceration or because
of malignancy obstructing the outflow. It is diagnosed
by barium meal and gastroscopy.

and toxic substances and alcohol as mentioned above.
Discomfort (dyspepsia), epigastric pain and vomiting
are typical symptoms.
Clinical Note
NSAIDs, such as aspirin, inhibit the enzyme
cyclooxygenase (COX), which is necessary for
prostaglandin production. Concurrent therapy with a
proton-pump inhibitor can prevent gastritis and ulcer
formation.

Chronic gastritis
Chronic inflammatory changes in the mucosa cause atrophy and epithelial metaplasia. It can be classified
according to aetiology.
• Autoimmune
• Bacterial infection
• Reflux.

Clinical Note

Autoimmune

When treating a patient who is vomiting, always test
the vomit for the presence of bile. Bile joins the
intestinal contents at the ampulla of Vater. Vomit will
only contain bile if the lesion is below the ampulla.

Inflammation is mediated by antibodies against gastric
parietal cells (90%) and intrinsic factor (60%). Intrinsic
factor is needed to absorb vitamin B12. In its absence,
macrocytic anaemia develops once liver stores of vitamin B12 have been used up.
Pernicious anaemia occurs where autoimmune gastritis and macrocytic anaemia exist together. It is associated with other autoimmune diseases such as thyroid
disease, vitiligo, Addison’s disease and myxoedema.
Pernicious anaemia is a risk factor for carcinoma of
the stomach.
The body of the stomach is always affected and often
this type of gastritis involves the entire stomach.

Gastritis
Gastritis (inflammation of the stomach) may be acute
or chronic.

Acute gastritis
This involves an acute inflammatory reaction at the superficial mucosa, with the infiltration of neutrophils.
Acute gastritis is almost always caused by drugs (especially NSAIDs such as aspirin) or by alcohol (the most
common cause) causing chemical exfoliation of the surface epithelial cells and decreasing the secretion of protective mucus.
The causative drugs or chemicals often inhibit prostaglandins, which protect the gastric mucosa by stimulating mucus and HCO3 production and inhibiting acid
secretion (despite their role in inflammation). The degree of damage ranges from erosions (acute erosive gastritis, see below) to ulcers (involving the full thickness of
the mucosa). H. pylori has been implicated in both acute
and chronic gastritis.
Acute erosive gastritis is typified by a partial loss of
gastric mucosa. It is caused by shock, severe burns

46

Clinical Note
Vitamin B12 is needed for the synthesis of DNA.
Normally, the nucleus is extruded from red blood cells
before they are released into the peripheral blood from
the bone marrow. In vitamin B12 deficiency, however,
maturation of the nucleus is delayed relative to the
cytoplasm and macrocytic or megaloblastic blood cells
with nuclei are seen in the peripheral blood.

Bacterial infection
Helicobacter pylori infection is present in about 90%
of cases of active chronic infective gastritis. It provokes an acute inflammatory response and the release
of proteases, which destroy gastric glands, leading

Disorders of the stomach
to atrophy. There is a mixed acute and chronic inflammatory reaction in the epithelium and lamina
propria.
Infective gastritis usually begins in the antrum, but it
may cause atrophy, fibrosis and intestinal metaplasia of
the entire stomach, where the normal gastric mucosa is
replaced with epithelium similar to that found in the
small intestine.

Reflux
Reflux is also known as reactive gastritis. This is caused
by regurgitation of duodenal contents into the stomach
through the pylorus and is more common where pyloric
or duodenal motility has been compromised, for example after surgery to the pyloric part. This type of gastritis
is caused by irritants such as NSAIDs, alcohol and biliary reflux, and may present with dyspepsia and bilious
vomiting.

Helicobacter pylori
Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative spiral-shaped
bacillus with the ability to penetrate the gastric mucus
lining. It is a common pathogen, with more than
half of adults over the age of 50 in the UK being infected,
but the incidence in younger groups is falling. In developing countries the infection rate is far higher, with rates
of up to 90% in some countries. However, most infected
patients are asymptomatic.
The bacterium is highly pathogenic and has many
virulence factors which allow it to survive in the hostile
environment of the stomach:
• Its motility allows it to penetrate close to the epithelium, where the pH is near-neutral
• It produces the enzyme urease, which converts
urea to ammonia, which buffers the gastric acid
with the concurrent production of carbon dioxide.
This is a highly effective virulence factor, as urea
channels in the inner cell membrane of the bacterium open at pH levels less than 6.5, delivering urea
to the bacterial urease. The activity of H. pylori urease is the basis for the urea breath test to detect the
bacterium
• The vacuolating toxin (VacA) alters intracellular
vesicular trafficking in gastric cells, leading to the
formation of large vacuoles
• The cytotoxin-associated antigen (CagA) is an immunodominant antigen which elicits a strong
serological response. It has been shown to be
involved in pathogenesis via the insertion of pathogenicity islands
• Other virulence factors include adhesin, phospholipases and porins.
Fortunately, H. pylori can be eradicated pharmacologically with triple therapy treatment. This consists of a

3

PPI with two antibiotics, currently a combination of
clarithromycin with either amoxicillin or metronidazole. This generally has a 90% success rate, and in those
patients in whom triple therapy is unsuccessful, quadruple therapy, with the addition of bismuth chelate
should be offered.
HINTS AND TIPS
When prescribing metronidazole, advise patients to
avoid alcohol. Metronidazole has a disulfiram-like
effect and patients will feel severely ill if they drink
alcohol at the same time. Disulfiram inhibits
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the
pathway for alcohol metabolism. In this situation
acetaldehyde builds up which can cause unpleasant
flushing and nausea. Unless they are warned, they will
understandably think the symptoms are caused by the
drug and stop taking it.

Peptic ulcer disease
Ulcers arise when damaging factors, particularly gastric
secretions, overwhelm the natural protection of the mucosal lining of the gastrointestinal tract. They can result
from a decrease in protective factors, an increase in damaging factors, or both.
Peptic ulcers can be divided into acute and chronic
forms. The former are usually caused by the same factors
as acute erosive gastritis, and in the same locations.
Severe stress and trauma, such as after burns (Curling’s
ulcer), head trauma (Cushing’s ulcer) and ischaemia of
the gastric mucosa are other causes.
Chronic peptic ulcers occur in the upper gastrointestinal tract where gastric acid and pepsin are present.
They are caused by hyperacidity, H. pylori infection
(the commonest cause), reflux of duodenal contents,
NSAIDs and smoking. Genetic factors play a role, as
peptic ulceration is more common in patients with
blood group O and first-degree relatives of people with
duodenal ulcers are three times more likely to develop
them themselves. Males are three times more likely
to develop chronic ulcers than females. They are an
example of a chronic inflammatory process (Fig. 3.14).
The two main types of peptic ulcers are duodenal
ulcers and gastric ulcers (especially at the junction of
the antrum and the body). Other sites include the distal
oesophagus, particularly in Barrett’s oesophagus, a
Meckel’s diverticulum and where a gastroenterostomy
has been performed.
There is an increase in incidence of peptic ulcer above
the age of 45 years. Both duodenal and gastric ulcers are
common in the elderly.

Treatment for peptic ulcers include proton pump inhibitors for at least 2 months, and triple therapy for the
eradication of H. pylori if necessary. If possible, patients
are advised to stop taking NSAIDs or use the lowest dose
possible for symptom control.

• Stricture, causing acquired pyloric stenosis in the
stomach, or oesophageal stricture which is more
common
• Malignant change, which is rare.

Vascular disorders
Angiodysplasia

Duodenal ulcers (DU) are two to three times more common than gastric ulcers (GU), occurring in about 15%
of the population. Approximately 90% of DU are associated with H. pylori.
Classically the epigastric pain is said to be relieved by
food or antacids, and exacerbated by hunger.

Angiodysplasia is a rare cause of upper gastrointestinal
bleeding, which may range in severity from occult to
massive. It is a condition found in elderly patients where
there is one or more malformed blood vessels (typically
veins) in the mucosa or submucosa.
These can be found anywhere in the gastrointestinal
tract. The vessels are dilated, thin-walled and look like
‘cherry spots’. They are normally asymptomatic.

Gastric ulcers

Gastric varices

Seventy per cent of GU are associated with H. pylori, with
the rest mainly associated with NSAID treatment. Gastric ulcers may also occur in response to acute gastritis
or extreme hyperacidity, as in Zollinger–Ellison
syndrome.
The epigastric pain is characteristically associated
with food.
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome is a rare condition due
to gastrin-secreting pancreatic adenomas causing excess
acid production. It can lead to acute ulcers in the antrum, duodenum and, in severe cases, the jejunum.
Complications of chronic peptic ulcer include:

Gastric varices are uncommon, but they may occur in
submucosal veins below the gastro-oesophageal junction as a result of portal hypertension.
Like oesophageal varices, they should never be biopsied or they will haemorrhage with potentially fatal
consequences.
Treatment includes injecting with a sclerosing agent,
or thrombin to arrest bleeding by thrombosis.

Duodenal ulcers

• Haemorrhage
• Perforation, leading to peritonitis
• Penetration, where the ulcer penetrates through the
stomach or duodenal wall into underlying tissue.
Usually it is the pancreas or liver which is affected

48

Delayed gastric emptying
Gastric emptying can be delayed by mechanical or nonmechanical obstructions.
Mechanical obstructions include tumours, duodenal, gastric or pyloric stenosis, and bezoars (a mass of
swallowed foreign material, which has collected and
is obstructing emptying).

Disorders of the stomach
Non-mechanical delayed gastric emptying is known
as gastroparesis. This is an uncommon complication of
diabetes, but it can also occur due to gastric arrhythmias, myotonic dystrophy, collagen-vascular diseases,
neuropathies and after vagotomy.
Mechanical delayed gastric emptying must be excluded
before non-mechanical aetiologies can be explored. Quite
often, the cause is unknown and the problem is called
idiopathic gastroparesis, but is probably due to gastric
arrhythmias.
Diabetic gastroparesis is associated with peripheral
neuropathy.
Patients can be asymptomatic, or they may have a
combination of symptoms, including bloating, abdominal pain, persistent belching, nausea (with or without
vomiting), anorexia, early satiety and weight loss.
Treatment includes:
• Nutritional supplementation
• Prokinetic drugs, e.g. metoclopramide – see
Chapter 5
• Surgery.

Neoplastic disease
Benign neoplasms
These include:
• Gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST, formerly
called leiomyoma), arising from smooth muscle,
which may bleed from ulceration. These are the most
common benign gastric tumours
• Adenomas (benign tumours of glandular origin)
make up 5–10% of polypoid lesions in the stomach and may contain proliferative dysplastic
epithelium with the potential for malignant transformation. They are much more common in the
colon but, if present in the stomach, are usually
in the antrum. They may be pedunculated (with
a stalk) or sessile (without a stalk) and are more
common in males. The incidence of adenomas
increases with age
• Hyperplastic polyps (regenerative polyps) are elongated gastric pits separated by fibrous tissue, usually
found in association with H. pylori infection in the
antrum
• Simple fundic polyps (glandular cystic dilatation in
the body of the stomach)
• Hamartomas (overgrowth of mature tissue, displaying disordered arrangement and proportion) are
most commonly seen in Peutz–Jeghers syndrome,
a hereditarydisorder
• Ectopic (heterotopic) pancreatic tissue
• Fibromas and neurofibromas, which are connective
tissue tumours
• Haemangiomas, which are highly vascular in
nature.

3

Malignant neoplasms
Aetiology
In the UK, approximately 15 in 100 000 people are
affected each year with gastric carcinoma and the
incidence increases with age, affecting men more than
women. It is the fifth biggest cause of death due to
malignancy. The incidence is falling in both Europe
and the USA, although it remains high in the Far East,
for which dietary factors have been implicated.
Adenocarcinoma is the most common gastric neoplasm and accounts for 90% of all malignant neoplasms
in the stomach. Malignant lymphomas account for 5%
of gastric malignant neoplasms, and other malignancies
such as carcinoid and malignant spindle cell tumours
occur rarely.
A number of conditions are premalignant, such as
atrophic gastritis, some chronic gastric ulcers, pernicious anaemia, and post-gastrectomy (carcinomas often
develop 15–20 years after surgery).
Genetic factors may be involved, as the incidence is
slightly higher in blood group A as well as in patients
with hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, but a
decrease in gastric acid secretion and corresponding increase in bacteria (which are normally killed by gastric
acid), particularly H. pylori, are common predisposing
factors.
Helicobacter pylori infections cause chronic gastritis,
which occasionally becomes atrophic gastritis, leading
to metaplasia, dysplasia and ultimately carcinoma.
Dietary factors may act to initiate or promote
carcinogenesis. A diet high in salt increases the risk.
Also, dietary nitrates are converted to carcinogenic
nitrosamines by bacteria. Therefore, diets high in
nitrates predispose to carcinoma. The incidence is high
in Japan but much lower amongst Japanese living in the
USA. Diets high in fruit and vegetables can help protect
against cancer because of the antioxidants they contain.

Pathology
Four different macroscopic appearances may be recognized:
• Malignant ulcers with raised, everted edges
• Polypoid tumours – these tend to present early with
discomfort, as they protrude into the lumen and
so are subject to trauma. It has the best prognosis
of all the pathological types as it is most suitable
for surgical excision
• Colloid tumours – these are large tumours which appear gelatinous
• Diffuse infiltrative tumours (linitis plastica, or ‘leather
bottle’ stomach, so named because the stomach becomes small, thick and contracted) – these present
very late and so have a poor prognosis. Unfortunately, they comprise a third of all gastric carcinomas.

49

The stomach
Histology shows sheets of anaplastic cells, many with
a single vacuole displacing the nucleus to one side,
giving them the name ‘signet-ring cells’.
Carcinomas may spread through the lymphatic system,
the bloodstream and direct spread locally.
Metastases can occur in the liver, bone, brain and
lung. Through peritoneal seeding, metastases can also
be found in the ovary (Krukenberg tumour).

Clinical features
Presentation is often late, with a correspondingly poor
prognosis due to metastatic spread. Signs and symptoms include:
• Epigastric pain
• Nausea and vomiting (especially if the tumour is at
the pylorus, causing obstruction)
• Anorexia
• Anaemia, most likely iron-deficient from occult
bleeding
• Haematemesis
• Weight loss, often profound
• Palpable epigastric mass (in 50% of patients)
• Signs of metastatic spread such as ascites, hepatomegaly and jaundice.

50

Clinical Note
Never ignore it if one of the supraclavicular lymph
nodes on the left side of the body is enlarged. Lymph
from the cardiac region of the stomach drains to these
nodes and they may become enlarged due to
metastatic spread from gastric carcinoma (Virchow’s
node, also called Troisier’s sign).

Diagnosis
Endoscopy is the investigation of choice. All gastric ulcers should be biopsied to exclude malignancy. Patients
should have a follow-up endoscopy in 6 weeks to confirm ulcer healing. Computed tomography (CT) scan is
usually performed to look for any metastatic spread.

Prognosis and treatment
Generally, the 5-year survival rate is less than 10%, but it
is much better for diagnosis of early carcinoma, i.e.
neoplasms confined to the mucosa and submucosa.
Treatment includes radiotherapy and surgery to excise the tumour and any affected lymph nodes. Partial
or total gastrectomy may be necessary in some cases.

The small intestine

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
• Describe the anatomy of the small intestine with regard to its macroscopic structure, relations, arterial
supply, venous and lymphatic drainage, and nerve supply
• Outline the embryological development of the small intestine

• Outline the following types of small intestinal disorders: congenital abnormalities, malabsorption and
neoplastic disease

OVERVIEW
The small intestine extends from the stomach to the
ileocaecal valve, where it joins the colon. It is approximately 6–7 metres long and is the main site for the digestive and absorptive processes.

ANATOMY
The small intestine consists of three parts: the duodenum, jejunum and ileum (Fig. 4.1).

Duodenum
The duodenum is about 25 cm in length and extends
from the pylorus to the duodenojejunal flexure. It is
C-shaped and snakes around the head of the pancreas
beginning 2–3 cm on the right side of the median plane
and ending an equal distance from the median plane,
but to the left. It lies in the umbilical region and except
for the first 2.5 cm, it is retroperitoneal and hence is the
most fixed part of the small intestine.
The first 2 cm of the duodenum is called the duodenal cap. Only the proximal half has mesentery, which
allows mobility. The greater omentum and hepatoduodenal ligament are attached proximally. The remainder
of the duodenum has no mesentery and is therefore
immobile.
The first part of the duodenum is about 5 cm long,
and is related to the following structures:
• Anteriorly: the peritoneum, gall bladder and quadrate lobe of the liver

• Posteriorly: the gastroduodenal artery, inferior vena
cava, portal vein and bile duct
• Inferiorly: the neck of the pancreas.
The second, retroperitoneal section is about 10 cm in
length and descends to the right side of L3. The common bile duct and pancreatic duct open into the posteromedial wall, coming together to form the ampulla
of Vater (hepatopancreatic ampulla) about two thirds
along its length (Fig. 4.2). This opens at the major
duodenal papilla.
The relations of the second part are:
• Anteriorly: the transverse colon, mesocolon and
coils of the small intestine
• Posteriorly: the hilum of the right kidney, its
renal vessels, the right ureter and the psoas major
muscle
• Medially: the head of the pancreas and the bile and
pancreatic ducts.
The third, horizontal section of the duodenum is also
retroperitoneal, and is approximately 10 cm in length.
This passes to the left, anterior to L3, before turning
upwards. It is adherent to the posterior abdominal wall,
and is related to:
• Posteriorly: the right psoas major muscle, right ureter, the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava
• Anteriorly: the coils of the small intestine and the superior mesenteric artery
• Superiorly: the superior mesenteric vessels and the
head of the pancreas.
The fourth ascending part is 3 cm in length and ascends to the duodenojejunal flexure to the left of L2.
The duodenum becomes the jejunum at the ligament
of Treitz, a fibromuscular band, which is also called

the suspensory muscle of the duodenum. The relations
of the final part are:
• Anteriorly: the coils of jejunum and the beginning of
the root of the mesentery
• Posteriorly: the left psoas major muscle and the left
margin of the aorta
• The head and body of the pancreas lie medially and
superiorly to D4, respectively.

Jejunum
The jejunum begins at the duodenojejunal flexure and
makes up about two fifths of the small intestine. It is
about 2.5 m long and lies mostly in the umbilical region. The jejunum has large and well-developed
mucosal plicae circulares (circular folds).

Ileum
The ileum, which is about 3.5 m long, constitutes the
rest of the small intestine. There is no clear demarcation

52

between it and the jejunum, but the ileum is paler,
thinner-walled and less vascular than the jejunum.
These differences, especially the fact that it is less vascular, are important surgically.
It is situated in the suprapubic and inguinal regions.
Its terminal part lies in the pelvis major, ascending over
the right psoas muscle and the right iliac vessels to join
with the caecum at the ileocolic junction. The plicae
circulares are small in the superior part of the ileum
and absent in the terminal end.

Mesentery
The small intestine has a fan-shaped mesentery, which
suspends it from the posterior abdominal wall
and allows the jejunum and ileum to be mobile. The
root of the mesentery is about 15 cm long and this
moves from left to right in an oblique and inferior direction. It begins on the left side of L2 and ends at the right
sacroiliac joint, passing the following structures:

Blood supply
The proximal half of the duodenum is a foregut structure and so is supplied by the coeliac trunk through
the gastroduodenal artery and its branch, the superior
pancreaticoduodenal artery. The distal half of the duodenum is a midgut structure. It is supplied by the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, which is a branch of
the superior mesenteric artery.
The superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal arteries form anastomoses called the anterior and posterior
arcades. These lie in between the duodenum and the
pancreas.
As they are midgut structures, the jejunum and ileum
are supplied by the superior mesenteric artery, which
arises from the abdominal aorta at the level of L1. Some
15–18 jejunal and ileal branches arise from the left side
of the superior mesenteric artery and pass between the
two layers of the mesentery, forming arches or loops
called arcades. The arterial supplies of the jejunum
and ileum are compared in Fig. 4.3.
Straight arteries called vasa recta branch off from the
arcades and do not anastomose in the mesentery. Many

In the jejunum and ileum, all the tributaries of the
superior mesenteric vein run alongside the branches
of the superior mesenteric artery.

Lymphatic drainage
In the duodenum, the anterior and posterior surface
lymphatics anastomose. The anterior vessels drain
to the pyloric and pancreaticoduodenal lymph nodes,
which then drain to the coeliac lymph nodes. The posterior vessels drain to the superior mesenteric nodes.
In the jejunum and ileum, the lymphatics are present
in the villi as lacteals. The lymph vessels drain into the
mesenteric lymph nodes close to the intestinal wall,
along the arterial arcades and along the proximal
section of the superior mesenteric artery.
The terminal ileal lymph vessels drain to the ileocolic
lymph nodes, which run with the ileal branch of the
ileocolic artery.

Innervation
Duodenal innervation comes from the vagus and sympathetic nerves via nerve plexuses on the pancreaticoduodenal arteries.
The jejunum and ileum are also supplied by the
vagus and splanchnic nerves. These travel through
the coeliac ganglion and form plexuses around the superior mesenteric artery.
HINTS AND TIPS
The superior mesenteric nerve plexus, supplying the
small intestine, receives sympathetic and
parasympathetic supplies from the superior mesenteric
ganglion and coeliac division of the vagal trunk,
respectively.

EMBRYOLOGY AND
DEVELOPMENT
The proximal portion of the small intestine (from the
pylorus to the duodenal papilla) develops from the foregut. The remainder of the intestine develops from the
midgut and hindgut. Rapid elongation of the midgut,
to form the primary intestinal loop, occurs from
5 weeks of embryonic life.
The midgut gives rise to the remainder of the duodenum (that part distal to the duodenal papilla) and to the
proximal two thirds of the transverse colon. The duodenum is, therefore, supplied by branches of the artery of
the foregut (the coeliac artery) and the superior mesenteric artery (which supplies the midgut).
The midgut is suspended from the dorsal abdominal
wall by a mesentery. It communicates with the yolk sac
through the vitelline duct. A small portion of the vitelline duct persists in 2% of individuals and forms an outpouching of the ileum known as Meckel’s diverticulum.
During development, the liver and primitive gut
grow so rapidly that there is not enough room in the fetal abdominal cavity, and the midgut herniates outside

54

rectum

the abdominal cavity at about the 6th week. It develops
in the umbilical cord until the end of the 3rd month,
when it begins to return to the abdominal cavity.
While outside the abdomen, the primary intestinal
loop rotates approximately 270 around the superior
mesenteric artery. Viewed from the front, the rotation
is anticlockwise (Fig. 4.4).
The jejunum and ileum form a number of coiled
loops but the large intestine remains uncoiled. The jejunum is the first portion of gut to return to the abdominal cavity.

HISTOLOGY
The tissue layers of the small intestine are essentially the
same as those found elsewhere in the gastrointestinal
tract (see Fig. 1.2), consisting of a mucosa, submucosa,
muscularis externa and serosa.

The mucosa
The mucosa consists of an epithelial layer, the lamina
propria and the muscularis mucosae. It is the main site

of absorption for the digestion of products, such as
amino acids, fats and sugars and so it, as well as
the submucosa, is specialized to allow maximum
absorption.
The mucosa has a much greater surface area than
other parts of the gastrointestinal tract due to:
•
•
•
•

The length of the small intestine
Plicae circulares
Numerous villi
A striated border of microvilli.

These factors together produce a 600-fold increase
in the absorptive area of the small intestine. Plicae
circulares are folds in the mucosa and submucosa,
arranged on a circular fashion around the lumen of
the small intestine. They are most prominent in the
jejunum, but absent in the distal part of the small
intestine.
Intestinal glands (crypts of Lieberkühn) are found
throughout the length of the small intestine. They
are simple tubular glands extending through the
thickness of the mucous membrane and opening
into the intestinal lumen at the base of the villi
(Fig. 4.5).

Villi
The villi change in shape along the length of the small
intestine. In the duodenum they are broad, but they become leaf-like further down the tract. In the terminal ileum, villi are finger-like projections.
They consist of an epithelial cover and a lamina propria with a centrally placed lymphatic capillary (lacteal)
that drains into the large lymphatic vessels in the

cells; microvilli are smaller protrusions from individual
epithelial cells.

These are phagocytic cells and contain lysozyme granules. They are found
deep in the intestinal glands

Membranous microfold 'M' cells

Epithelial cells, which overlie Peyer's patches and allow for entry of antigen

Undifferentiated (stem) cells

These give rise to enterocytes, goblet cells and enteroendocrine cells.
They are located in the lower thirds of the crypts

Enteroendocrine (APUD) cells

These cells secrete hormones and neuropeptides, such as somatostatin,
5-HT, secretin and gastrin. They are found in the crypts of the small
intestine and have microvilli at their luminal apices

Types of mucosal cell
The cell types of the small intestinal mucosa are summarized in Fig. 4.6.

Enterocytes
Enterocytes are the most numerous cells and have an absorptive function. They are found chiefly on the villi and
surface of the small intestine and, in smaller numbers,
in the intestinal glands. They are tall columnar cells with
striated microvilli and irregular outlines (Fig. 4.7).
The cells absorb water from the lumen of the gut, and
the paracellular spaces contain ATPases (membrane
pumps) which transport sodium from the cell into
the spaces, drawing the water absorbed from the lumen
of the cell by osmosis.
The ultrastructure of these cells is indicative of their
absorptive role. They contain large quantities of rough
endoplasmic reticulum (RER), mitochondria and Golgi
bodies. Many ribosomes are present.
The microvilli are covered by a protein coat, the
glycocalyx. This contains many enzymes (e.g. lactase,
alkaline phosphatase, lipases), which are involved in
digestion and transport.

Goblet cells
Goblet cells (Fig. 4.8) in the intestine produce mucus, as
they do in other epithelia. They are packed with mucin
and their cytoplasm has abundant RER, reflecting their
secretory role.

56

They are interspersed between the enterocytes and
are most numerous on the villi and in the superior
two thirds of the crypts.
Goblet cells are least numerous in the duodenum, but
they increase in frequency along the length of the small
intestine, being most populous in the terminal ileum.

Paneth cells
Paneth cells are found in the deepest part of the intestinal glands. They synthesize and secrete large amounts of
protein, and thus have cytoplasm rich in RER. The secreted proteins are defensins which protect against infection by regulating the gut flora.
They are also phagocytic and contain granules of lysozyme, an enzyme that digests the walls of certain
bacteria.

Stem cells
Stem (undifferentiated) cells are located in the lower
third of the crypts of Lieberkühn. They replenish all
the other cells of the small intestine.
Approximately 1.7 billion enterocytes are shed from
the adult intestine each day, being replaced by undifferentiated cells migrating up from the bases of the crypts.
The turnover of enterocytes takes about 5 days.

Enteroendocrine cells
The enteroendocrine (amine precursor uptake and decarboxylation, APUD) cells situated in the crypts of
the small intestine are very similar to those found in

the stomach. They are triangular-shaped with the luminal apex displaying microvilli, and contain neuroendocrine granules.
They secrete hormones and neuropeptides, including
somatostatin, 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin), secretin,
gastrin, motilin and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide.

Lamina propria
The lamina propria of the small intestine is made up of a
glycosaminoglycan (GAG) matrix, fibroblasts, collagen,
reticulin and smooth muscle fibres.
It also contains capillaries, lymphatics, nerves and
diffuse lymphoid tissue.

Peyer’s patches
Peyer’s patches are present in the mucosa of the ileum,
extending into the submucosa, and are characteristically
found opposite the attachment of the mesentery. They
consist of aggregations of lymphoid nodules and form
part of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT)
system. The Peyer’s patches contain three types of cell:
• Membranous microfold ‘M’ cells, which allow
antigen to enter
• Dome cells, which are rich in MHC class II and
present antigen to lymphocytes
• Lymphocytes (B and T) found in the follicular zone.

Submucosa
The submucosa contains the submucosal (Meissner’s)
plexus as well as a large quantity of mucosa-associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) and lymphatics. It is vascular
and extends into the plicae circulares.
In the duodenum, compound tubular Brunner’s
glands are also present. They secrete mucus, bicarbonate
and growth factors such as epidermal growth factor.
The last of these promotes the growth and regeneration
of tissues. Brunner’s glands also secrete urogastrone, an
inhibitor of acid secretion.

57

The small intestine

Muscularis externa
The muscularis externa, like that of the rest of the gastrointestinal tract, is made up of two smooth muscle layers:
an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal one.
The myenteric (Auerbach’s) plexus is located between
the muscle layers.

PHYSIOLOGY
The small intestine has a very large surface area and is
specially adapted to digest and absorb nutrients, salt
and water. Enzymes and hormones produced in the
small intestine complete the digestion that began in
the mouth and stomach.
The small intestine has immunological defences
against antigens that have been ingested consisting of
solitary lymph nodules and Peyer’s patches (aggregations of lymphatic nodules).
Gastrointestinal hormones produced in the small
intestine play an important role in gastrointestinal
secretion and motility.

Epithelial cell turnover
Enterocytes have a high rate of turnover and are replaced
by undifferentiated (stem) cells, which migrate up from
the bases of the crypts of Lieberkühn. The cells become
partially differentiated and they continue to divide as
they migrate upwards from the bottom of the crypts
(Fig. 4.9).

extrusion zone
functional compartment
maturation compartment

The average lifespan of an enterocyte is about
2–3 days, but this is reduced in coeliac disease (see
later) and as a side effect of some drugs, e.g. prolonged
anticancer therapy. The undifferentiated cells cannot
keep up with the increased loss, resulting in a flattening
of the villi and malabsorption.
Radiotherapy may have a similar effect (radiation
enteritis) depending on the dose and the site at which
it is administered. Symptoms usually resolve within
6 weeks of the final dose of radiotherapy, but some
patients experience chronic radiation enteritis (symptoms persisting for more than 3 months).

Clinical Note
In coeliac disease, which is caused by an allergy to
gluten in wheat, the surface of the jejunum is flattened
and there is extensive loss of villi. This causes
malabsorption, as the loss of villi results in a decrease in
the available absorptive area.
This loss of villi also results in an increased enterocyte
turnover and thus an increase in stem cell numbers, as
the stem cells try to replenish the lost cells. There is
further information later in the chapter.

Secretions
The small intestine secretes mucus and gastrointestinal
hormones.
• Mucus is produced by the goblet cells (Fig. 4.8),
which are most numerous on the villi. The mucus
lubricates the mucosal surface and protects it from
trauma as particles of food pass through it
• The gastrointestinal hormones which affect the
small intestine are summarized in Fig. 4.10.
The epithelial cells secrete an aqueous solution during
the course of digestion but, under normal conditions,
they absorb slightly more than they secrete.

58

Defence
The defences of the small intestine are in the most part
due to T and B lymphocytes.
T lymphocytes account for 75% of all lymphocytes,
and are made in the thymus gland, following which
they migrate into encapsulated peripheral tissues such
as those of the spleen and lymph nodes. T lymphocytes
also migrate to non-encapsulated lymphoid tissue
known as mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT).
This gives protection against antigens entering the body
through mucosal epithelial surfaces.

The majority of MALT is present as gut-associated
lymphoid tissue (GALT); smaller amounts are present
in the bronchi, skin and genitourinary tract.
T cells are divided into:
• Helper (CD4) cells, which enhance the reaction of
the immune system following the presentation
of antigen to T helper cells by antigen-presenting
cells, via MHC class II receptors
• Cytotoxic (CD8) cells, which are capable of killing
other cells, e.g. cancer cells and cells that have been
infected with viruses, and can also down-regulate the
immune response. They are activated via an endogenous antigen–MHC class I complex.
B lymphocytes are made in the bone marrow and, in the
fetus, in the liver. They also migrate to peripheral tissues, including MALT. B cells produce antibody and,
once they have encountered a particular antigen, form
memory cells, which can undergo clonal expansion
(multiplication to form large numbers of identical B
cells). They then differentiate to form plasma cells,
which have a relatively short half-life but which produce
large numbers of specific antibody to particular antigens. Scattered lymphoid cells are also found in the
mucosa of the small intestine.
The main type of antibody produced by intestinal B
cells is IgA, the major immunoglobulin of external secretions. There are approximately 1010 plasma cells
per metre of small intestine, the majority of which
(70–90%) produce IgA. IgA dimers are transported
across the glandular epithelium into the gut lumen
by binding to a receptor on the epithelial surface. The
IgA–receptor complex is endocytosed and transported

across the cell into the lumen. Part of the receptor
(the secretory component) remains attached to the
IgA and protects IgA from proteolytic enzymes in
the lumen.
IgA prevents microorganisms from entering as it
binds and neutralizes them directly without the need
for other effector systems. A much smaller amount of
IgM is also secreted by the intestinal B cells.
Specialized M cells (so named because of the numerous microfolds on their luminal surface) overlie the
Peyer’s patches and they absorb, transport, process
and present antigens to the lymphoid cells lying
between them.

Motility
Motility in the small intestine facilitates three main
functions:
• Mixing of intestinal contents
• Bringing the contents into contact with the absorptive surfaces of the small intestine
• Forward propulsion of the contents.
Chyme takes between 2 and 3 hours to pass through
the small intestine, which is the site at which most digestion and absorption of nutrients takes place. There are
two main types of contraction seen in the fed state:
segmentation and peristalsis.
Segmentation mixes the digested food and exposes it
to the absorptive surfaces. It is a discontinuous, oscillating contraction resulting in alternating contracted and
relaxed areas, the latter containing chyme. Although
the movement is mainly in a forwards-and-backwards

direction, there is a slow net movement towards the
anus as the frequency of the contractions decreases
down the length of the small intestine (Fig. 4.11).
Peristaltic contraction brings about rapid propulsion
of the intestinal contents towards the anus, at a rate of
2–25 cm/s. It involves contraction of the longitudinal
muscles and is a reflex initiated by local distension
caused by the bolus of food. Peristalsis moves chyme
more quickly towards the colon and does not mix it
as efficiently as segmentation.
Motility in the fasting state is due to migrating motor
complexes (MMC) which occur every 90–120 min. The
MMC involves high-frequency bursts of powerful
contractions, beginning in the stomach and moving
towards the terminal ileum. The pyloric sphincter is
open wide during the MMC.
The MMC has a number of functions:
• It moves indigestible food, e.g. tomato skins, nuts,
sweetcorn into the lower bowel
• It allows for the removal of dead epithelial cells
• It prevents bacterial overgrowth
• It prevents colonic bacteria entering the small
intestine.

Control of intestinal motility
The motility of the small intestine is controlled by nervous, hormonal and local factors which coordinate the
various intestinal reflexes (Fig. 4.12). Of importance is
the gastroileal reflex, which causes ileal segmentation
in response to gastrin secreted due to the presence of
chyme in the stomach.
Vagal stimulation is required to maintain the fed
motor pattern. Segmentation is coordinated by the
myenteric plexus, and circular muscle contraction is
brought about by acetylcholine and substance P.

Fig. 4.12 Control of small intestine motility.

The peristaltic reflex occurs by the simultaneous oral
(proximal) contraction and anal (distal) relaxation,
either side of the bolus. The contraction is mediated
by vagal excitatory contractions, via substance P and
acetylcholine.
The relaxation is mediated by vagal inhibitory
contractions, via nitric oxide (NO) and VIP. Movement
of the bolus into the next section of the intestine triggers
the next reflex.
In the fasting state, the MMC is coordinated by the
enteric nervous system. It is initiated by vagal stimulation and motilin. During an MMC, plasma motilin
concentrations increase, but they decrease on the arrival
of food in the stomach.

Control of the ileocaecal valve
The incompetent ileocaecal valve (see Chapter 5) separates the terminal ileum from the colon and is normally
closed. However, it opens in response to:
• Distension of the terminal ileum (by a reflex
mechanism)
• Short-range peristalsis in the terminal ileum
• Gastroileal reflex (which enhances emptying of the
ileum after a meal).

The intestinal circulation
The intestinal circulation is part of the splanchnic circulation, which supplies the lower oesophagus, stomach,
liver, gall bladder, pancreas, spleen and intestines.
At rest, approximately 10–30% of the cardiac output
flows to the digestive organs and three quarters of

4

Physiology
this is required by the mucosa and submucosa for facilitation of absorption and transport. The remaining
quarter is utilized by the smooth muscle layer of the
bowels.
This circulation is named the intestinal countercurrent system, and is very similar to that seen in the
loop of Henle in the kidney. In the mucosal villi,
the blood vessels are arranged in a network of hairpin
loops.
The arteriole enters at the base of the villus and divides into a capillary network at the tip of the villus, just
deep to the epithelial lining of the villus. The arteriole
and venule are only 20 mm apart and lipid-permeable
molecules, such as oxygen, can pass from one vessel
to the other.
The blood flows are opposite in direction (hence
‘counter-current’). This facilitates some of the dissolved
oxygen in the plasma to move along its diffusion gradient from the arteriole to the venule, without entering the
capillary network.
When intestinal blood flow is low, this shunting of
oxygen can cause death to the epithelial cells at the villus
tip. Necrosis of enterocytes at the villus tip is a sign of
severe intestinal ischaemia.
The most important function of the counter-current
blood flow is to produce a region of hyperosmolarity
in the villus tip by means of a multiplier system
(Fig. 4.13). Hyperosmolarity is achieved by the following mechanisms:
• Naþ ions are pumped into the subepithelial extracellular fluid by the enterocytes and taken up in
the capillary network. As blood flows down
into the venule, Naþ ions diffuse across to the capillary, which returns the Naþ ions to the villus tip.
This results in a hyperosmolar region at the tip,
which draws in water molecules from the intestinal
lumen
• Water molecules may also be drawn into the
descending capillaries from the arterial vessel, if
there is an increased Naþ concentration. This also
results in the delivery of hyperosmolar blood to
the villus tip.

Control of the intestinal circulation
Nerves, hormones and local factors control the intestinal circulation.
A change in the cardiac output, arterial pressure or
blood volume will have the same effect on this circulation as on the general systemic circulation. For example,
massive haemorrhage will result in a decreased venous
return to the heart, decreased cardiac output and a drop
in arterial blood pressure. This activates baroreceptors
to bring about the sympathetic reflex of vasoconstriction in precapillary vessels.

Autonomic nervous control regulates the blood
flow by:
• Parasympathetic nerves, which are vasodilators, via
acetylcholine and VIP
• Sympathetic nerves, which are vasoconstrictors, via
adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) (acting on b2-adrenoreceptors)
• Enteric nerves, which are vasodilators, via acetylcholine and VIP
• Primary sensory nerves (C fibres), which are vasodilators, via NO, substance P and calcitonin generelated peptide (CGRP)
• Endocrine and paracrine controls can also regulate
the intestinal circulation.
Metabolites in the gut after a meal can act as vasodilators. Glucose and fatty acids cause postprandial hyperaemia, which is mediated by VIP release from the enteric
nervous system.

transport. The properties of these different types of
transport are shown in Figs 4.14 and 4.15.

DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION
Digestion begins in the mouth and continues in the
stomach, but most digestion and absorption takes
place in the small intestine. For food to be absorbed,
it must be broken down into small particles that can
be transported across the epithelial cells of the gastrointestinal tract and into the bloodstream. Substances
are then carried to the liver via the hepatic portal
system.
As elsewhere in the body, molecules may be transported across the epithelial cells by simple diffusion,
facilitated diffusion and primary or secondary active

Factors which control absorption
by the small intestine
A number of factors control absorption by the small
intestine:
• Adequate blood supply
• Carrier molecule density and availability at the
brush border
• Cell maturation rate
• Number of transporting cells

This produces maltose and maltotriose (together
known as malto-oligosaccharides), comprising 70% of
the breakdown products, and a-limit dextrans (the
remaining 30%).
Starch is therefore partially digested in the mouth
and its digestion continues in the duodenum, as salivary
amylase is inactivated in the stomach by gastric acid.
Other enzymes exist in the brush border of the duodenum, and these complete the digestion of starch. These
enzymes further breakdown starch into the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, which are actively taken
up with sodium. Carbohydrates are only absorbed as
monosaccharides through the gut mucosa.
Glucose and galactose then cross the basal membrane into the capillaries by facilitated transport and
simple diffusion (Fig. 4.16).
Another monosaccharide, fructose, is also produced
and taken up by a sodium-independent mechanism.
A deficiency of enzymes in the digestive system can result in carbohydrate malabsorption. The most common

• Passive permeability and the intracellular concentrations of molecules
• The electrochemical gradient for Na þ
• Sympathetic innervation and epinephrine in the
plasma both increase the absorption of Naþ and
Cl– (and therefore water)
• Parasympathetic stimulation decreases the absorption of these substances.

Digestion and absorption of
different components of the diet
Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates provide most of the calories in the average diet, the majority being in the form of starch (a polymer of glucose).
Starch contains a-1,4 and a-1,6 linkages: the former
are hydrolysed by amylase in saliva(ptyalin) and in
pancreatic secretions (pancreatic amylase).

deficiency is lactase deficiency. This is often acquired, and
results in lactose intolerance in about 50% of adults
worldwide. Congenital lactase deficiency is rare.
The digestion of carbohydrates is summarized in
Fig. 4.17.

Protein
The protein requirement of a normal healthy adult is
about 40 g/day (to replace the 5–7 g/day nitrogen lost
as urea in the urine and so maintain nitrogen balance).
In the Western world, meat eaters usually exceed this,
but in the developing world the amount of protein in
the diet is less.
We do not have a store of protein in the body (unlike,
for example, carbohydrate which is stored as glycogen).
Every protein in the body performs a function and proteins are in a constant state of flux (1–2% of total body
protein is turned over daily), being synthesized by ribosomes and then degraded in the body. We synthesize
about 300 g/day.
Protein in the intestinal lumen comes from protein
eaten in the diet and also from cell turnover, almost
all of which are digested and absorbed.
Digestion of dietary protein begins in the stomach
(pepsin hydrolyses about 15% of dietary protein to
amino acids and small peptides). It continues in the

duodenum and small intestine where pancreatic proteases continue the process of hydrolysis (Fig. 4.18).
Absorption of the products of protein digestion:
small peptides, particularly dipeptides and tripeptides are absorbed more rapidly than amino acids. They
are transported across the membrane by an active
mechanism utilizing the electrochemical potential
difference of Naþ.
There are a number of different amino acid carriers
depending on the charge of the amino acid. Some of
these require a Naþ gradient for transport.
Amino acids enter the cells from the lumen and leave
it to pass into the capillaries by three mechanisms:
sodium-dependent transport, sodium-independent
transport and simple diffusion.
Defects of amino acid absorption are rare.

Fat
Fat is not water-soluble and its digestion and absorption
is more complex than that of other substances.
Fat in the diet is principally in the form of triglycerides (a complex of glycerol and fatty acids) and is
only released from the stomach into the duodenum
at the rate at which it can be digested. The presence
of fat in the duodenum, therefore, inhibits gastric
emptying.

Gastric lipase begins the hydrolysis of triglycerides,
although it is not significant unless pancreatic lipase
is deficient.
In the duodenum, bile acids, aided by lecithin, emulsify fat to form micelles by their detergent action.
A minimum concentration of bile acids is needed to
form micelles (the critical micelle concentration).
Micelles consist of 20–30 molecules, arranged so that
lipid (non-polar) molecules lie in the centre, surrounded by conjugated bile acids and water-soluble
molecules. They increase the surface area for enzymatic
digestion by pancreatic lipase.
Pancreatic lipase is inactivated by acid and so is ineffective if excess acid is produced by the stomach. This
occurs in the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, where fat
malabsorption occurs.
Absorption of the products of fat digestion: the products of fat digestion, being lipids, diffuse across the lipid
membrane of the brush border of the small intestine. Different components are absorbed at different rates. Free
fatty acids diffuse across rapidly, cholesterol more slowly.
The micelles, therefore, become more concentrated in
cholesterol as they move along the small intestine.
Under normal conditions, most dietary fat is
absorbed before the contents reach the end of the jejunum and any fat in the stools (in the absence of steatorrhoea) is from desquamated epithelial cells and from
bacterial flora in the gut.
Once inside the epithelial cells, lipid is taken into the
smooth endoplasmic reticulum where much of it is reesterified.

Some lipid is also synthesized in the epithelial cells.
Dietary and synthesized lipids are then incorporated
into chylomicrons and, provided a-lipoprotein is present, the chylomicrons are exocytosed into lateral intercellular spaces to enter the lacteals. Having reached the
lymphatic system, they travel up the thoracic duct and
enter the venous circulation.
Apolipoproteins are an important constituent of chylomicrons. They are made by hepatocytes and the epithelial cells of the intestine. Their absence leads to the
accumulation of lipid in intestinal epithelial cells.
Chylomicrons consist mainly of triglyceride with a
phospholipid coat studded with apolipoproteins. They
contain small amounts of cholesterol and cholesterol
esters in the centre, and their overall size depends on
the amount of fat in the diet. Following a high fat intake,
chylomicrons may have a diameter of up to 750 nm, in
low-fat diets they may be as small as 60 nm.
Abetalipoproteinaemia is a rare inborn error of metabolism inherited as a recessive trait, characterized by
failure of chylomicron formation and an accumulation
of dietary fat within enterocytes.
A diagrammatic representation of the digestion and
absorption of fat is shown in Fig. 4.19.
HINTS AND TIPS
Remember that bile is not enzymatic; its acids
emulsify fats via a detergent action and do not
hydrolyse it.

Vitamins
Fat-soluble vitamins
Absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and
K depends on the absorption of fat and any condition in which fat digestion and absorption is decreased will eventually lead to a deficiency of these
vitamins.

Water-soluble vitamins
At the concentrations present in a normal diet, most of
these are taken up by specific transport mechanisms,
many of which are sodium-dependent.
Fig. 4.20 Vitamin B12 absorption in
the terminal ileum. (IF ¼ intrinsic
factor.)

An important example of a water-soluble vitamin is
vitamin B12. On ingestion, it is bound to R protein
found in saliva and in gastric secretions, which protects
it from digestion in the stomach. Once vitamin B12 has
been separated from R protein in the duodenum by the
action of pancreatic proteases, vitamin B12 binds to intrinsic factor (IF) secreted by gastric parietal cells.
Receptors for the IF–B12 dimer are present in the membranes of the epithelial cells of the terminal ileum, which
bind the complex and allow uptake of vitamin B12.
Vitamin B12 is then transported across the basal
membrane of the epithelial cells into the portal blood
(Fig. 4.20). It is then bound to transcobalamin II and

taken up by the liver, kidney, spleen, heart, placenta, reticulocytes and fibroblasts.
The presence of autoantibodies against IF causes malabsorption of vitamin B12 and macrocytic anaemia.
The resulting disease is called pernicious anaemia.
Clinical Note
Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency is by intramuscular
injections of hydroxocobalamin (one of the forms of
vitamin B12) every 2–3 days until six injections have
been given. If the cause of the deficiency remains
uncorrected, injections should continue to be given at
3-monthly intervals.

Electrolytes
Sodium

Almost all of the Naþ in the gastrointestinal tract is reabsorbed (about 99%), mostly from the jejunum in association with glucose, galactose and certain amino acids.
Naþ is transported across the epithelial cell membrane
down its electrochemical gradient and pumped into the
intercellular spaces in exchange for Kþ.
Naþ is absorbed against its electrochemical gradient
in the ileum and the colon. Water follows the active
pumping of Naþ by Naþ/Kþ ATPases through a transcellular or paracellular (tight junctions) route.

Potassium

Kþ is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum. It is secreted
into the colon when Kþ concentrations in the lumen are
less than 25 mmol/L.

Water
The normal daily intake of water is about 1.5 L/day.
However, up to 9 L water per day are absorbed
from the gastrointestinal tract (through the reabsorption of secretions) under normal circumstances, most
of it from the small intestine, especially the jejunum
(Fig. 4.21).

Calcium
This is absorbed throughout the small intestine (especially in the duodenum and jejunum) although
absorption is disrupted in vitamin-D-deficient states.
Ca2 þ passes across the luminal membrane and into
the cytoplasm, where it is bound to a protein and then
transported across the basolateral membrane, some of it
in exchange for Naþ.
Ca2 þ deficiency is seen in vitamin D deficiency,
for example in rickets. Vitamin D helps to regulate
Ca2 þ absorption and metabolism in the body.

Iron
Iron deficiency is relatively common, particularly in
menstruating women. The total amount of iron in the
body is only about 3–4 g, of which about two-thirds
is in haemoglobin.
An average Western diet contains about 20 mg of
iron a day, of which only about 10% can be absorbed.
Both males and females lose almost 1 mg of iron
a day in the urine and desquamated cells, and females lose about 50 mg of iron a month in the menstrual flow.
Absorption is increased in iron deficiency and by increased erythropoietic activity. Growing children, pregnant women and people who have bled are thus able to
absorb increased amounts of iron to compensate for
their greater need.
Most dietary iron is in the form Fe3 þ, which is reduced to Fe2 þ by ascorbic acid in gastric secretions or
ferrireductase in the mucosa and then absorbed. Anything that prevents this reduction decreases the absorption of iron, e.g. the production of an insoluble complex
with other dietary compounds such as tannin (present
in tea), phytate and certain fibres.
Fe2 þ is taken across the enterocyte membrane of the
small intestinal villi by a divalent metal transporter. In
the enterocyte, Fe2 þ is oxidized to Fe3 þ and then either

67

The small intestine
released into the plasma where it binds to a transferrin
molecule or stored in the epithelial cells, bound to
ferritin.
The proportion of iron released depends on the
body’s requirement. A larger amount remains in the
cell bound to ferritin when dietary intake exceeds
the body’s requirement. This iron is then shed when
the epithelial cell is desquamated and prevents iron
overload.
Excessive amounts of iron are absorbed in haemochromatosis (see Chapter 6), an autosomal recessive
condition.

The ileum has a large flora of 104–108 organisms per
mL of fluid. The bacteria are obligate anaerobes and
include Bacteroides, Clostridium, Bifidobacterium and
Enterobactericeae.

DISORDERS OF THE SMALL
INTESTINE
Only those disorders affecting only or primarily the
small intestine will be covered here. Disorders and diseases which involve both the small and large intestines
are discussed in Chapter 5.

Clinical Note
Haemochromatosis leads to the deposition of iron
in the liver, heart, pancreas and pituitary. This results
in damage to those organs. The disease is more
common in men because premenopausal women are
protected by menstruation and childbirth.

Stem cells in the crypts of Lieberkühn can be
programmed to absorb more iron, e.g. following
haemorrhage. An increase in absorption may be seen
3–4 days after trauma and in response to other events
causing blood loss (the time taken for stem cells to
mature and reach the tips of the villi where most iron
absorption takes place).

THE FLORA OF THE SMALL
INTESTINE
Bacteria may be commensal or pathogenic. Broadly,
they may be classified as aerobic or anaerobic.
In health, most of these bacteria are commensal and
many of them have important functions, particularly in
protecting against colonization by pathogenic bacteria.
However, flora which are harmless or even beneficial
in one site may become pathogens in another part
of the body.
Most of the gastrointestinal tract is heavily colonized
with flora. Relatively sterile sites include the stomach
(where the acid conditions are too hostile to support
much flora), gall bladder and salivary glands. The small
intestine is also fairly sterile.
The degree of colonization varies along its length.
The duodenum has few microorganisms, mostly
Gram-positive cocci and bacilli due to the acidic gastric
juices and the alkaline biliary and pancreatic secretions.
The jejunum has more bacteria than the duodenum.
Enterococcus faecalis, lactobacilli and diphtheroids are
found here.

68

Congenital abnormalities
Meckel’s diverticulum
Meckel’s diverticulum is the remnant of the vitelline
duct present in embryonic life. It connects the developing embryo with the yolk sac.
In the embryo, the vitelline duct is found at the
apex of the primary intestinal loop that forms when
the midgut rapidly elongates (see Fig. 4.4). The long
sides of the loop are known as the cephalic limb
(which forms the duodenum, jejunum and part of
the ileum) and the caudal limb (which forms the
remainder of the ileum, the caecum, appendix,
ascending colon and the proximal two thirds of the
transverse colon).
Meckel’s diverticulum, therefore, marks the junction
of the cranial and caudal limbs of what was the embryonic midgut.
Meckel’s diverticulum can be described with the ‘rule
of twos’:
• It is present in 2% of the population
• It is about 2 inches long
• It is approximately 2 feet from the caecum.
Heterotopic gastric epithelium (normal tissue present in
the wrong place) may sometimes be found in the diverticulum, including HCl-secreting oxyntic cells, resulting
in peptic ulceration. Rarely, ulcers may perforate or
bleed. Heterotopic pancreatic tissue may also be found
there.
Acute inflammation of the diverticulum may occur,
mimicking acute appendicitis. The mucosa at the mouth
of the diverticulum may become inflamed and lead to
intussusceptions and osstruction, or the diverticulum
may perforate and cause peritonitis. In most cases,
however, diverticula are asymptomatic, however if the
vitelline duct remains patent throughout its length, an
umbilical-ileo fistula may form.
Laporoscopic resection of the diverticulum is the
treatment of choice.

Disorders of the small intestine

Atresia and stenosis

Causes and effects of malabsorption

Atresia is a failure of canalization and results in complete obstruction. Stenosis is a narrowing of the lumen
and results in partial obstruction.
Atresia and stenosis may occur anywhere along the
length of the gastrointestinal tract, but they are found
most often in the duodenum and least often in the
colon.
The incidence is 1 in 5000 births. They are diagnosed
quickly after birth. The causes of atresia and stenosis
range from lack of recanalization (in the proximal duodenum) to malrotation and gastroschisis (in the distal
duodenum), leading to the cessation of the blood
supply.
The loss of a blood supply results in complete tissue
necrosis to that part of the bowel. The anus may be imperforate, with the anal canal ending blindly at the anal
membrane, or a fistula may form between the rectum
and perineum. Alternatively, the rectum may empty
into the vagina forming a rectovaginal fistula or into
the urethra, forming a urorectal fistula.

The causes of decreased nutrient absorption include:

Malasorption syndromes
Malabsorption is the decreased absorption of nutrients
which may be caused by a number of conditions, including biochemical disorders (such as absent or defective digestive enzymes) and disease of the small
intestine. A simple classification is given in Fig. 4.22.

• Reduced small intestinal surface area
• Infection leading to damage of the mucosa and bacterial removal of nutrients
• Defective intraluminal hydrolysis or solubilization
(due to lack of enzymes)
• Abnormalities of mucosal epithelial cells (involving
loss of digestive enzymes or carriers)
• Drug-induced mechanisms
• Lymphatic obstruction
• Rapid transit though the small intestine
• Failure of nutrients to reach the small intestine, e.g.
because of a fistula
• After surgical resection of gut and/or radiation
therapy.
Whatever the cause, the results of malabsorption are
essentially the same.
Patients complain of frothy, greasy stools, which are
difficult to flush away (steatorrhoea), diarrhoea, weight
loss and abdominal distension.
Anaemia may be due to deficiency of iron, folate or
vitamin B12. Vitamin K deficiency can lead to bleeding
disorders, purpura (extravasation of red cells into the
skin, characterized by red skin lesions, which do not
blanch on pressure) and petechiae (flat, red or purple
spots about the size of a pinhead in the skin or mucous
membranes).

The small intestine
Endocrine disorders may result from generalized
malnutrition and deficiencies of vitamin A and B1
may lead to peripheral neuropathy.
Deficient absorption of amino acids can result in
hypoalbuminaemia and oedema. Dermatitis and hyperkeratosis may also be evident in the skin. The musculoskeletal system may also be affected with osteopenia
and tetany. Fig. 4.23 summarizes the systemic effects
of malabsorption.

Coeliac disease
Coeliac disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the
small intestinal mucosa caused by an abnormal reaction
to gluten, which is found in wheat.
It is most common in northern Europe, although it
occurs worldwide. It has an average prevalence in the
UK of 1 in 100 people. Many autoimmune diseases
are associated with it, for instance dermatitis herpetiformis, type 1 diabetes mellitus and thyroid disease.
The disease causes damage to the enterocytes. The
precise mechanism for this is unclear, although it is suggested that environmental factors allow gliadin, a

protein found in gluten, to come into contact with tissue transglutaminase in the lamina propria. The gliadin
is modified by TTG and is recognized as antigenic by
CD4þ T cells.
Stem cells are unable to keep up with the rate of loss
of enterocytes. This results in villous atrophy and the
presence of immature cells, which are unable to absorb
nutrients normally on the flattened surface. This, in
turn, causes malabsorption and an intolerance of
lactose and other sugars because of a secondary disaccharide deficiency resulting from the loss of surface
epithelial cells.
Patients commonly present with diarrhoea, abdominal pain and bloating which is often associated with
particular foods, and any of the other features of malabsorption can be present. The diagnosis should also be
considered in patients with weight loss, or iron-deficient
anaemia.
Investigations include blood tests for antigliadin and
anti-TTG assays. However, the gold standard for diagnosis is jejunal biopsy showing evidence of villous atrophy.
Treatment is a permanent gluten-free diet, the vast
majority of patients showing a marked improvement

Disorders of the small intestine
on dietary change. Gluten is present in wheat, barley,
oats and rye and these must all be excluded. It is not,
however, present in rice or maize.
The condition predisposes to T cell lymphomas in
the small intestine (an unusual small bowel lymphoma
among the non-coeliac population, in whom most
small bowel lymphomas are B cells). There is also a
higher incidence of other gastrointestinal cancers such
as cancer of the stomach and oesophagus. Another common complication is osteoporosis.

Tropical sprue
Tropical sprue is a chronic, progressive malabsorption
in patients from, or in, the tropics (mainly the West
Indies and Asia) associated with abnormalities of small
intestinal structure and function. It is thought to have an
infective cause.
Symptoms include diarrhoea, abdominal distension,
fatigue and weight loss. Megaloblastic anaemia caused
by folate deficiency is common. Overgrowth of bacteria
in the small intestine is frequently found.
Like coeliac disease, there is villous atrophy, although
obviously a gluten-free diet is of no help.
Treatment is with broad-spectrum antibiotics, e.g.
tetracycline.

Whipple’s disease
This is a rare bacterial infection usually occurring in
middle-aged men. It is ten times more common in men
and is caused by the bacterium Tropheryma whipplei
(a Gram-positive actinomycete).
Symptoms include weight loss and other abdominal symptoms, polyarthralgia, chronic cough and
hyperpigmentation.
Diagnosis is by jejunal biopsy, which shows intact
villi where the normal cells of the lamina propria have
been replaced by ‘foamy’ macrophages containing PASpositive glycoprotein granules. Similar cells may be
found in lymph nodes, spleen and liver.
Treatment is with tetracycline.

Bacterial overgrowth
The small intestine normally supports a large number of
flora but these are kept in check by peristalsis, the acidity
of chyme leaving the stomach and the secretion of immunoglobulins into the intestinal lumen by the mucosal cells.
Where one or more of these factors is reduced, e.g. if
there is a structural abnormality, bacterial overgrowth
may occur. It may also occur in the elderly for unknown
causes.
Jejunal biopsy may show a normal mucosa. Diagnosis is with the hydrogen breath test – an early rise in

4

breath hydrogen levels is diagnostic. These organisms
may inactivate bile acids in the lumen by dehydroxylation, leading to fat malabsorption. The gut flora may catabolize ingested protein, metabolize sugars and bind
vitamin B12, preventing its absorption. Vitamin K levels
may, however, be raised as the bacteria may produce it.
Treatment is with antibiotics, such as tetracycline,
metronidazole or ciprofloxacin.

Giardiasis
Giardiasis, prevalent in the tropics, is an important
cause of traveller’s diarrhoea. It is caused by the flagellate protozoan Giardia lamblia, which lives in the duodenum and jejunum and is transmitted by the faecal–oral
route. Cases may also occur in Britain among people
who have never been abroad.
Asymptomatic carriage may occur. Alternatively,
symptoms of diarrhoea, malabsorption and abdominal
pain or bloating may develop within 1 or 2 weeks of
ingesting cysts.
Giardia lamblia exists as a trophozoite and a cyst, the
cyst being the transmissible form. Intestinal damage
varies from slight changes in villous architecture to partial villous atrophy with severe malabsorption.
Diagnosis is by stool microscopy. Both cysts and kiteshaped trophozoites may be found, but their absence
does not exclude the diagnosis: in some cases they are
only excreted at intervals. The parasite may also be seen
in duodenal aspirates and in a jejunal biopsy.
Treatment is with metronidazole or tinidazole.

Neoplastic disease
Small intestinal tumours are much rarer that tumours of
the large intestine and rectum. Patients generally present with iron-deficient anaemia, obstruction, bleeding
or volvulus.

Benign tumours
These include:
•
•
•
•

Lipomas
Leiomyomas
Adenomas (often benign)
Hamartomas.

Malignant lesions
These include:
•
•
•
•

Adenocarcinomas
Carcinoid
Lymphomas
Metastases, from lung or melanoma.

Adenocarcinoma accounts for 50% of all tumours
found in the small intestine. It is associated with both

71

The small intestine
celiac and Crohn’s disease, although the pathogenesis is
unknown. Diagnosis is normally by abdominal CT scan
or barium enema. Surgical resection is the treatment of
choice.
Carcinoid tumours make up 10% of small intestional malignant lesions. These are described in further
detail in Chapter 5.

72

Intestinal lymphoma is rare, but more common in the
small intestine than the large. They may be of B-cell or Tcell lineage. The majority are of the non-Hodgkin’s B-cell
type, which arise from mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. T-cell lymphomas are associated with celiac disease
and have a poorer prognosis. Treatment is with surgery
followed by either radiotherapy or chemotherapy.

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
• Describe the anatomy of the large intestine, with regard to its macroscopic structure, relations, arterial
supply, venous and lymphatic drainage, and nerve supply
• Outline the embryological development of the large intestine
• Outline the histological structure of the large intestine
• Describe the functions of the large intestine
• Describe the mechanisms controlling large intestinal motility and outline the process of defecation
• Outline the following types of large intestinal disorders: congenital abnormalities, infections,
inflammatory bowel disease, diverticular disease, obstruction, vascular disorders, neoplastic disease,
appendicitis and anorectal disorders

OVERVIEW
The large intestine extends from the ileocaecal junction
to the anus, and is about 1.5 m in length. Its main role
is to concentrate faeces by absorbing water, hence
it also plays a role in water and electrolyte balance. It
also has to transport faeces through the entire colon
to the anus.

ANATOMY

The outer surface of the large intestine has appendices epiploicae projecting from it. These are sacs of
omentum distended with fat.

Clinical Note
The large intestine is easily distinguished from the small
intestine as its haustra do not extend across the entire
width, unlike the small intestine which has plicae
circulares (also called valves of Kerckring or valvulae
conniventes) visible across the whole width on
radiographs.

The large intestine can be divided into seven sections
(Fig. 5.1):

caecum and appendix
ascending colon
transverse colon
descending colon

anal canal.

The outer, longitudinal muscle forms three distinct
bands visible at dissection called taenia coli. These
bands are shorter than the circular muscle layer and
gather the caecum and colon into a series of pouch-like
folds called haustrations or sacculations.
HINTS AND TIPS
The haustra are visible on radiographs when an opaque
medium is introduced through the rectum.

Caecum
The caecum is a sac lying in the right iliac fossa. It is continuous with the ascending colon distally and the ileum
proximally, with which it communicates through the
ileocaecal valve (Fig. 5.2).

HINTS AND TIPS
The ileocaecal valve is incompetent. This is good,
because it prevents the build-up of wind or stools in the
colon and allows the easing of pressure across the
valve.

It is covered entirely in peritoneum, but has no mesentery. The caecum is often attached by peritoneal caecal

folds to the iliac fossa to form the retrocaecal recess, a
small peritoneal cavity in which the appendix lies.
The caecum is supplied by the ileocolic artery, a
branch of the superior mesenteric artery. Venous blood
from the caecum drains via the ileocolic vein into the
superior mesenteric vein.
It is innervated via the superior mesenteric plexus.

Appendix
The (vermiform) appendix is about 8 cm in length and
protrudes from the posterolateral wall of the caecum
(Fig. 5.1). It has aggregations of lymphatic tissue and
the three taenia coli of the caecum come together at
the base of the appendix, forming an outer longitudinal
muscle coat.
It is a blind-ending sac and so may become inflamed
(appendicitis) if obstructed, e.g. by faecoliths, which
are small, hard masses of faeces. This requires surgical
removal of the appendix to prevent rupture and
peritonitis.
The appendix is mobile as it has a mesentery, the
mesoappendix. Because of this and the way it develops
(see later), its position is variable. It usually lies behind
the caecum or in the pelvis.

Anatomy
Clinical Note
The base of the appendix is usually constant and can be
located deep to McBurney’s point. This is found at the
junction of the lateral and middle thirds of the line
between the anterior superior iliac spine and the
umbilicus.
A gridiron incision can be made here to gain access to
the appendix during appendicectomy.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The appendix is covered in peritoneum and supplied by
the appendicular artery (a branch of the ileocolic
artery), which lies in the mesentery that connects the
appendix to the terminal ileum.
The ileocolic vein drains the appendix.
The lymphatic drainage and innervation for the caecum and appendix is the same. The lymph drains into
the ileocolic lymph nodes (which lie along the ileocolic
artery) and the lymph nodes in the mesoappendix.

Innervation
The innervation to the caecum and appendix comes
from the coeliac and superior mesenteric plexuses.

Ascending colon
The ascending colon arises from the ileocaecal valve to
the inferior surface of the liver, where it turns to the left
forming the hepatic (right colic) flexure (Fig. 5.1).
It has no mesentery and lies retroperitoneally. However, it has peritoneum covering the lateral and anterior
surfaces, which attaches it to the posterior abdominal
wall. The peritoneum on the medial and lateral sides
of the ascending colon forms the right paracolic gutter.
Anterior to the ascending colon lie the coils of the
small intestine and the greater omentum. These separate
it from the anterior abdominal wall.
Posteriorly are the iliacus, transversus abdominis and
quadratus lumborum muscles, and the right kidney.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The ascending colon, being a midgut structure, is supplied by the right colic artery and ileocolic artery, which
are branches of the superior mesenteric artery.
Its venous drainage is via the right colic and ileocolic
veins, which drain into the superior mesenteric vein.
Lymph from this region drains to the paracolic and
epicolic lymph nodes. These drain into the superior
mesenteric lymph nodes.

5

Innervation
Innervation to the ascending colon comes from the coeliac and superior mesenteric plexuses, like that of the
caecum and appendix.

Transverse colon
The transverse colon extends from the hepatic (right
colic) flexure to the splenic (left colic) flexure. It is
the largest part of the large intestine and is about
45–50 cm in length.
The transverse colon is mobile due to its length and
the presence of a mesentery (the mesocolon). This double layer of peritoneum is attached to the inferior border
of the pancreas and greater omentum and allows the
transverse colon to hang from the posterior abdominal
wall, usually to the level of the umbilicus.
The splenic flexure is slightly more superior than the
hepatic flexure, due to the spleen being smaller than
the liver. The splenic flexure is attached to the diaphragm
by the phrenicocolic ligament, a fold of peritoneum.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The arterial blood supply is from the middle, right and
left colic arteries (Fig. 4.3). The middle colic artery is the
major arterial supply. It is a branch of the superior mesenteric artery, along with the right colic artery. These
supply the proximal two-thirds of the transverse colon
which is derived from the midgut.
The left colic artery is a branch of the inferior mesenteric artery supplying its distal, hindgut-derived third.
The superior mesenteric vein drains the transverse
colon, and its lymph drains to the lymph nodes along
the middle colic artery. These then drain into the
superior mesenteric lymph nodes.

Innervation
Innervation to the transverse colon comes from the superior mesenteric plexus, which follows the path of the
middle and right colic arteries.
The nerves from the inferior mesenteric plexus follow
the path of the left colic artery. Both sympathetic and
parasympathetic (vagal) nerves supply the transverse
colon.

Descending colon
The descending colon is about 30 cm in length and is
the narrowest part of the colon. It extends from the
splenic flexure to the left iliac fossa at the pelvic brim,
where it becomes the sigmoid colon.
The descending colon has no mesentery and lies retroperitoneally, attached to the posterior abdominal

75

The large intestine
wall. Like the ascending colon, it has paracolic gutters
medially and laterally.
The lateral border of the left kidney, the transversus
abdominis and quadratus lumborum muscles lie
posterior to the descending colon.

The inferior mesenteric vein drains blood from the
sigmoid colon, while the lymph drains to the intermediate colic lymph nodes, as in the descending colon.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage

The innervation is the same as that to the descending
colon.

The left colic and superior sigmoid arteries supply the
descending colon. Both are branches of the inferior
mesenteric artery.
Venous drainage is via the inferior mesenteric vein.
The lymph drains to the intermediatecolic lymph
nodes, which lie along the left colic artery.

Innervation
Parasympathetic innervation comes from the pelvic
splanchnic nerves and sympathetic innervation is derived from the lumbar part of the sympathetic trunk
and the superior hypogastric plexus.

Sigmoid colon
The sigmoid colon is S-shaped and lies in the left iliac
fossa. It extends from the pelvic brim to join the rectum
at the level of S3.
The sigmoid colon has a long mesentery; the sigmoid
mesocolon. This has a V-shaped root attachment and
somis very mobile.
It lies anterior to the left external iliac vessels, the left
sacral plexus and the left piriformis muscle. Parts of
it can also be found in the rectouterine pouch (of
Douglas) in females or the rectovesical pouch in males.
Long appendices epiploicae hang from the external
wall of the sigmoid colon. The position, size and shape
of the sigmoid colon depend on how full of faeces it
is. This is the main storage site of faeces, prior to
defecation.
Clinical Note
The sigmoid colon is the part of the colon most prone to
volvulus due to its length and high mobility. It is also the
part most susceptible to perforation as it has the
highest pressure in the colon and its walls are the
weakest.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The sigmoid colon is supplied by two or three sigmoid
arteries. These descend to the left and divide into ascending and descending branches. The descending
branch of the left colic artery anastomoses with the most
superior sigmoid artery.

76

Innervation

Rectum
The rectum is continuous with the sigmoid colon proximally and the anus distally.
It starts at the level of S3, in the posterior part of the
pelvis and curves along the sacrum and coccyx, in an
S-shaped course before widening to form the rectal
ampulla. It has no mesentery and so is immobile.
Peritoneum covers the anterior and lateral surfaces in
the superior third, and the anterior surface only in the
middle third. The inferior third is not covered. In males,
it is reflected from the bladder to form the rectovesical
pouch while in women it is reflected from the vagina to
form the rectouterine pouch (of Douglas).
The rectum has three flexures, the most important
being the anorectal flexure. This is produced by the puborectalis muscle encircling the rectum at the junction
with the anal canal to form a ‘sling’ and a 90 anorectal
angle.
At each flexure is a transverse fold formed by infoldings of the rectal wall. They are maintained by the taeniae coli and partly close the lumen.
The relations of the rectum are different in the male
and female. In the male, the bladder, prostate, seminal
vesicles and vasa deferentia lie in front of it; in the
female it is related anteriorly to the uterus and vagina.
Posterior to the rectum lie:
•
•
•
•
•
•

The three inferior sacral vertebrae
The coccyx
The anococcygeal ligament
The median sacral vessels
Branches of the superior rectal artery
The inferior ends of the sympathetic trunks and sacral plexuses.

The rectal ampulla stores faeces before defecation and
is very distendable. It is supported by the levator ani
muscles.

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The arterial supply to the rectum comes from a number
of sources:
• The median sacral arteries
• The superior, middle and inferior rectal arteries
which supply the corresponding parts of the rectum.

Anatomy
The rectal arteries anastomose with each other. The superior rectal artery is a continuation of the inferior mesenteric artery while the middle and inferior rectal
arteries are branches of the internal iliac arteries and
the internal pudendal arteries, respectively.
The superior, middle and inferior rectal veins drain
the rectum. They anastomose to form internal and external venous plexuses.
The external plexus is outside the muscular wall and
the internal plexus is just deep to the mucosa. The internal venous plexus communicates with the uterovaginal
venous plexus in the female and the vesical venous
plexus in the male.
The different areas of the rectal venous plexus drain
into different vessels:
• The superior part drains into the superior rectal vein,
then into the inferior mesenteric vein
• The middle part drains into the middle rectal vein,
then into the internal iliac vein
• The inferior part drains into the internal pudendal
vein.
The superior rectal veins drain into the portal system
and the inferior rectal veins drain into the systemic circulation. The rectum is thus a site of a porto-systemic
anastomosis (see Chapter 6).
The superior part of the rectum drains lymph into the
pararectal lymph nodes, which then drain to the sigmoid mesocolon lymph nodes and inferior mesenteric
lymph nodes. The inferior part of the rectum drains
lymph into the internal iliac lymph nodes.

Innervation
The rectum receives sympathetic and parasympathetic
innervation. Nerves from the inferior hypogastric plexus
make up the middle rectal plexus.
Parasympathetic innervation is derived from S1, S3
and S4 nerves, which run with the pelvic splanchnic
nerves, finally joining up with the inferior hypogastric
plexus. Sensory fibres follow the sympathetic fibres
and are stimulated by rectal distension.

Anus
The anal canal is continuous with the rectum and is
about 3 cm long. It begins at the anorectal flexure and
it is surrounded by the levator ani muscles, ending at
the anus.
The anal canal descends between the perineal body
and the anococcygeal ligament. The ischioanal fossae
are two wedge-shaped spaces on either side of the anal
canal.
The anus has an internal and an external sphincter
(Fig. 5.3). The external sphincter surrounds the lower
two thirds of the anal canal and is composed of striated

levator ani

ring

sphincters.

muscle. It is thus under voluntary control, allowing
delay of defecation.
The internal sphincter surrounds the upper two
thirds of the anal canal and is made up of involuntary
circular smooth muscle continuous with that of the rectum. Both sphincters must relax for defecation to occur.
In the male, the anal canal lies behind the prostate
and the bulb of the penis. The perineal body separates
it from these structures, but a digital rectal examination
can give important information about the prostate. In
the female, the perineal body separates the anal canal
from the vagina.
In the mucosa of the superior half are six to twelve longitudinal ridges called anal columns. They contain the
terminal branches of the superior rectal artery and vein.
The superior ends of the anal columns mark the anorectal line or junction. Folds of epithelium, called anal
valves, connect the inferior ends of the anal columns.
Just superior to the anal valves are the anal sinuses,
which release mucus to aid defecation.
The pectinate line is found between the superior
and inferior parts of the anal canal. It is the boundary
between the columnar epithelium of the superior
part and the stratified squamous epithelium of the
inferior part.
HINTS AND TIPS
Anal canal structures above the pectinate line have
developed from the endodermal hindgut. Structures
below the pectinate line have developed from the
ectodermal anal pit, or proctodeum. Therefore, the
differences in blood, lymphatic and nerve supply above
and below the pectinate line are due to embryological
development.

77

The large intestine

Blood supply and lymphatic drainage
The superior and both inferior rectal arteries drain the
areas superior and inferior to the pectinate line
respectively.
The terminal branches of the superior rectal artery
anastomose in the anal valves. The middle rectal arteries
anastomose with the superior and inferior rectal
arteries.
Venous drainage occurs via the internal rectal venous
plexus to the superior and inferior rectal veins
respectively.
Clinical Note
The veins in the wall of the anal canal provide a cushion
for the passage of faeces and help to close the anus, but
they can enlarge to form haemorrhoids.

In the superior part of the anal canal, the lymph
drains to the internal iliac lymph nodes and then into
the common iliac and lumbar lymph nodes. In the inferior part of the anal canal, lymph drainage is to the superficial inguinal nodes.

Innervation
Superior to the pectinate line, the sympathetic nerve
supply is derived from the inferior hypogastric plexus.
The parasympathetic supply comes from the pelvic
splanchnic nerves.
Inferior to the pectinate line, the nerve supply comes
from the inferior rectal nerves, which are branches of the
pudendal nerve. This region is sensitive to touch, temperature and pain.
The pelvic splanchnic nerves (parasympathetic) and
the aortic and pelvic plexuses (sympathetic) innervate
the internal anal sphincter.
The inferior rectal nerve, a branch of the pudendal
nerve and the perineal branch of S4 innervate the
external anal sphincter.

EMBRYOLOGY AND
DEVELOPMENT
This section focuses solely on the development of the
large intestine. However, as it develops in tandem with
the small intestine, it may be useful to read this section
with its counterpart in Chapter 4.
The caecal bud appears on the caudal limb of the
primitive gut tube at about week 6 and develops
into the caecal swelling, which is the last part of the
developing tube to re-enter the abdominal cavity.

78

The appendix develops from the distal end of the
swelling during the descent of the colon and may come
to lie in a variety of positions. However, it is usually
found posterior to the large intestine.
Clinical Note
Failure of the intestinal loops to return to
the abdominal cavity results in exomphalos, the
protrusion of abdominal contents through the
abdominal wall at the site of insertion of the cord.
The contents of this hernia are covered by amnion
(which distinguishes them from gastroschisis—
see below).

The distal third of the transverse colon and the upper
part of the anal canal arise from the hind-gut. They are
supplied by the inferior mesenteric artery.
The distal part of the hindgut grows into the cloaca,
an endodermal-lined cavity, which is in contact with the
surface ectoderm.
During the 9th week of development, the anal membrane ruptures to open up the rectum to the external
environment.
In the anal canal, the pectinate line indicates the
junction between the endodermal and ectodermal
parts. It is also the point at which the columnar epithelium in the upper part of the anal canal changes to
stratified squamous epithelium in the lower part.

HISTOLOGY
The tissue layers of the large intestine are essentially the
same as those in the rest of the gastrointestinal tract (see
Fig. 1.2).
However, the muscle walls are thicker in order to
facilitate faecal movement, the lumen is larger and the
outer longitudinal muscle layer forms taeniae coli
visible on the outside of the intestine.

Mucosa
The mucosa is thrown into folds when not distended. It
consists of simple columnar epithelium and contains
numerous straight tubular glands that extend throughout its thickness. Unlike the small intestine, there are
no villi or plicae circulares. The glands consist of two
main types of cells:
• Columnar absorptive cells found at luminal surfaces
• Mucus-secreting goblet cells found at the gland
bases.

Functions and physiology
Paneth cells are present only when young. Isolated
nodules of lymphatic tissue are found that extend into
the submucosa.
The muscularis mucosae is prominent. Its contractions prevent clogging of the glands by aiding faecal
movement.

Anorectal junction
The rectum narrows towards its terminal end when it
becomes the anal canal.
The upper portion of the anal canal contains longitudinal folds (anal or rectal columns) separated by depressions (anal sinuses).
The sinuses contain straight, branched tubular
glands (anal glands) which produce mucus and extend
into the submucosa and sometimes into the muscularis
externa.
The ducts of the anal glands open into crypts in the
anal mucosa, and may thus become infected or blocked,
forming a cyst.
The mucosa of the upper anal canal is similar to that
of the large intestine but the lower portion consists of
stratified squamous epithelium, continuous with the
skin surrounding the anal canal. The middle portion
contains stratified columnar epithelium.
Small folds of mucosa (anal valves) are present at
the lower end of the anal canal. Above these, the mucosa
is folded longitudinally forming the columns of
Morgagni.

THE FLORA OF THE LARGE
INTESTINE
Most of the flora of the large intestine are anaerobes, e.g.
Bacteroides fragilis. The large intestine also supports coliforms such as Escherichia coli and faecal streptococci,
including Enterococcus faecalis.
There are at least 400 species of bacteria in the large
bowel, with over 1010 organisms per gram of stool.
Approximately one quarter of the weight of stool is
bacteria.
Commensal bacteria keep pathogenic bacteria at
bay by competing with them for space and nutrients.
The significance of this becomes apparent during antibiotic administration. Antibiotics disrupt the normal
flora and predispose to clostridial and other gut
infections.
The intestinal flora convert conjugated bilirubin to
urobilinogen, some of which is reabsorbed and excreted
in the urine. The flora also convert the remainder of
the urobilinogen to stercobilinogen which is excreted
in the faeces.

Clinical Note
Many patients taking broad-spectrum antibiotics,
e.g. cephalosporins and ampicillin develop diarrhoea
which normally resolves on stopping the drug.
However, in some patients an overgrowth of
Clostridium difficile may ensue, causing
pseudomembranous colitis (see below).

FUNCTIONS AND PHYSIOLOGY

Water absorption
Absorption of water in the colon is similar to the mechanism used to concentrate the contents of the gall bladder described in Chapter 7.
Naþ and Cl– are pumped into the paracellular (lateral intercellular) spaces and water follows by osmosis.
Water molecules, Naþ and Cl– then flow through the
lateral intercellular spaces away from the lumen, and
across the basement membrane of the epithelial cells
of the colon.
Some Cl– from the colonic lumen also crosses the
tight junction into the intercellular space because
of the potential difference. It travels in the opposite direction to Kþ and increases the concentration of Cl– in the
intercellular space and, therefore, the passage of water.
The concentration of ions in that part of the intercellular space closest to the lumen is hypertonic, but the
fluid at the basement membrane end is isotonic. It is
the isotonic fluid that crosses the basement membrane
and moves into the intestinal capillaries. Absorbed
amino acids and sugars also increase the osmotic
absorption of water.
Abnormalities in water absorption in the intestines
can result in diarrhoea (see below).

Transport of urea and electrolytes
The main function of the colon is absorption. It absorbs
over 90% of the water from the contents passing
through it, reducing the volume from 1–2 L to about
200 mL of semi-solid faecal matter.
By the time they reach the end of the gastrointestinal
tract, faeces are about 50–75% water. The remainder is
solid material, which is partly composed of bacteria and
desquamated mucosal cells. Desquamated cells largely
account for the fact that a starving person continues
to produce stools.
The ion transport processes of the colon are shown in
Fig. 7.5. Naþ in the lumen is exchanged for Hþ (Naþ is
pumped into the epithelial cells and H þ pumped out of
it). HCO3  is exchanged for Cl– (Cl– is reabsorbed,
bicarbonate pumped out).

79

The large intestine
In addition, paracellular spaces exist into which Naþ
and Cl– is pumped, and from which Kþ passes out into
the lumen. Kþ is pumped into the cells in exchange for
the Naþ pumped out into the paracellular spaces.
The net result of this is the creation of a potential difference of about –30 mV across the colonic mucosa
(a greater difference than that across the jejunal and ileal mucosa). It is this potential difference that allows
the passage of Kþ across the tight junctions from the
paracellular space into the lumen and accounts for
the potassium-rich secretions found in the colon.
Urea synthesis is greater than its excretion by about
20%. The excess is secreted into the colon for metabolism by bacteria. The products are then absorbed.
Metabolism occurs near the mucosa, rather than in
the lumen. NH4 þ and HCO3  ions are produced and
converted into NH3, CO2 and water. These freely diffuse
across the mucosal epithelium into the circulation. The
NH3 is transported to the liver for synthesis of amino
acids. Electrolyte movement in the colon is shown in
Fig. 5.4.

Secretion of mucus
The colonic mucosa has many goblet cells in its crypts
and surface epithelium. They secrete mucus in response
to mechanical irritation of the mucosa caused by substances passing through it, and as a result of cholinergic
stimulation.
Mucus lubricates the colon, preventing trauma from
the contents passing through it, which become increasingly solid as water is reabsorbed on the way through.
The ratio of mucous to aqueous secretion is greater in
the colon than elsewhere in the gastrointestinal tract.
The aqueous component contains bicarbonate,
which plays an important role in buffering, and is rich
in potassium. Chloride is absorbed in exchange for
bicarbonate.

Motility of the large intestine
The movement of intestinal contents through the colon
is slower than that seen in the rest of the gastrointestinal
tract. This is partly due to the nature of the activity and
partly due to its absorptive function of water and
electrolytes.
The large intestine has three main modes of
movement:
• Segmental (or haustral) contractions
• Peristalsis
• Mass movement.

Segmental contractions
Segmental (or haustral) contractions are brought about
by the contraction of the taeniae coli. These three bands
of longitudinal muscles gather the colon into haustra.
The haustra fill with intestinal contents and the distension stimulates contraction.
Contraction of adjacent haustra causes a mixing effect and allows the contents to be in contact with the
mucosal surfaces, thus facilitating absorption.
Segmental contractions are initiated by acetylcholine
and substance P release.

Peristalsis
Peristalsis is slower in the large intestine than in the
small intestine. It provides waves of propulsive contractions, slowly moving the intestinal contents towards
the anus. As in the small intestine, distension initiates
the contractions and vagal inhibitory and excitatory
fibres control the movement.

Mass movement
Mass movement describes the intense contraction that
begins halfway along the transverse colon and pushes
the intestinal contents towards the rectum. This type
of contraction occurs only a few times a day and is responsible for colonic evacuation.
It occurs shortly after a meal and if faeces are present
in the rectum, stimulates the urge to defecate. This is
called the gastrocolic reflex. It is partly neuronal and
partly hormonal (via the action of cholecystokinin).

Control of colonic motility
As in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, Auerbach’s
and Meissner’s plexuses are present in the walls of the
colon (see Fig. 1.2). Their activity is modulated by parasympathetic and sympathetic activity.
Parasympathetic stimulation is via branches of the
vagus and pelvic nerves from the sacral spinal cord.

Pharmacology of intestinal motility

a congenital absence of ganglion cells in these plexuses
in the rectum.
If there has been damage to the spinal nerves and
therefore to the control of the external sphincter, it will
relax when the pressure in the rectum reaches about
55 mmHg.
The anal canal can differentiate between air, liquid
and solid contents, and allow the selective release of
air as flatus.

It increases contraction of the proximal colon, allowing
greater absorption of salts and water.
Sympathetic innervation is via the superior and inferior mesenteric and hypogastric plexuses. It decreases
colonic movements.
Colo-colonic reflexes occur (mediated in part by the
sympathetic system) causing one part of the colon to
relax if an adjacent part is distended (Fig. 5.5).

Defecation
Control of defecation
The urge to defecate is felt because stretching of the rectum causes impulses in the cholinergic parasympathetic
nerves of the pelvis. These are transmitted to a nerve centre in the sacral spinal cord. A pressure of about
18 mmHg in the rectum is needed.
Impulses are then conveyed to higher centres, allowing an individual to decide whether to defecate, i.e.
whether to voluntarily relax the external sphincter, or
not. In the latter case, the internal sphincter will recontract and the urge to defecate will subside.
As mentioned earlier, the external anal sphincter is
made up of striated (voluntary) muscle while the internal sphincter is composed of involuntary smooth muscle. The latter relaxes as a reflex in response to distension
of the distal rectum.
Intact Auerbach’s and Meissner’s plexuses are needed
for this reflex relaxation to occur. Thus in Hirschsprung’s disease (see later), the internal sphincter does
not relax in response to colonic distension as there is

Mechanics of defecation
When a person decides to defecate, i.e. when the external sphincter is voluntarily relaxed, an increase in intraabdominal pressure must be achieved to expel the
faeces.
Thus, a breath is taken in and the glottis closes over
the trachea. The respiratory muscles contract on lungs
filled with air, which increases both the intrathoracic
and intra-abdominal pressures.
The pelvic floor muscles relax and the floor ‘drops’,
thus straightening the rectum and preventing rectal
prolapse. The faeces are then expelled from the anus.

PHARMACOLOGY OF INTESTINAL
MOTILITY
Bowel motility is under autonomic control. Two
classes of drugs increase bowel movements: laxatives,
which cause purgation and true motility stimulants,
which do not. Antidiarrhoeals and antispasmodics
decrease bowel movements. The modes of action of
these drugs vary (Fig. 5.6).

Drugs which increase movements
Laxatives
Strictly speaking, laxatives (also known as purgatives)
do not increase gastrointestinal motility. However, they
do increase the speed with which food passes through
the intestine, hence the purgation. There are four kinds
of laxatives:
•
•
•
•

Osmotic laxatives, e.g. lactulose, movicol
Bulk laxatives, e.g. methylcellulose, fybogel
Stimulant laxatives, e.g. senna, picolax
Faecal softeners, e.g. docusate sodium.

Osmotic laxatives
Osmotic laxatives accelerate the transit of food by preserving the higher water contect of residue in the small
intestine. An increased (hydrated) volume is thus delivered to the colon, distending it and causing purgation.
They are poorly absorbed solutes, which accounts for
their osmotic effect.

Two most frequently used osmotic laxative is lactulose. Lactulose is a semisynthetic disaccharide of
fructose and galactose which is degraded to its component monosaccharides by gut bacteria. These are then
fermented, producing lactate and acetate which draw
water into the intestine by osmosis. Lactulose takes
2–3 days to have an effect.
The other commonly used osmotic laxative is movicol. Movicol sachets contain macrogel, sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride and potassium chloride.
Macrogel passes through the bowel without being
absorbed, and so water is retained in the bowel making
the stool softer.

Bulk laxatives
These are polysaccharides which cannot be digested.
They act by retaining water and promoting peristalsis.
However, they take several days to work but have no
major side-effects. Examples include methylcellulose,
bran and fybogel (ispaghula).

Stimulant laxatives
As their name suggests, they act possibly by stimulating
enteric nerves causing increased mucosal water and electrolyte secretion. Senna is an important example of this
class of drug. It is a glycoside of sugars with anthracene
derivatives like emodin. In the colon, senna is hydrolysed, releasing free anthracene derivatives which then
stimulate the myenteric plexus. As a result, smooth muscle activity is increased and defecation occurs.
Other examples are bisacodyl and sodium picosulphate (Picolax); the latter is commonly used when
preparing the bowel for surgery (‘bowel prep’).

82

Faecal softeners
An example of a faecal softener is docusate sodium,
which acts via a detergent action on the stool in the
intestine. It is also a weak stimulant laxative.

Motility stimulants
There are two main drugs in this category: metoclopramide and domperidone. All increase motility but without causing purgation.
The anti-emetic function of metoclopramide has already been mentioned above. In addition to that, however, metoclopramide also acts locally in the stomach to
stimulate acetylcholine release. Consequently, gastric
motility is stimulated, with an increase in gastric emptying but without a corresponding increase in gastric acid
secretion.
Domperidone is another dopamine-receptor antagonist. However, the mechanism by which it enhances gastrointestinal motility is unexplained, although it has
been suggested that it acts to facilitate acetylcholine release from the myenteric plexus as well. Its effects are
to increase gastric emptying (without increasing gastric
acid secretion) and duodenal peristalsis, as well as increasing the pressure of the lower oesophageal sphincter.

Drugs which decrease movements
Antidiarrhoeal drugs
When treating diarrhoea (see later), the maintenance of
normal fluid and electrolyte balance must be the first
priority. Then, depending on the aetiology, either antimicrobial drugs or non-antimicrobial drugs may be

5

Disorders of the large intestine
necessary. Antimicrobial drugs are beyond the scope of
this book; for more information on them consult the
relevant chapter in Crash Course: Pharmacology.
If fluid and electrolyte balance is deranged due to excessive loss, it can be restored by means of oral rehydration solutions. These are easy to use; the most common
preparation is dioralyte, a powder mix of glucose and
sodium chloride which can be dissolved in water. Glucose increases sodium, and thus water absorption as it is
absorbed by secondary active transport with sodium.
The use of oral rehydration therapy may be sufficient
in many cases; in fact, it is the treatment of choice for
cholera.
The main non-antimicrobial antidiarrhoeal drugs are
opioids. Opioids act on m-receptors on myenteric neurons. The tone and contractions of the intestinal smooth
muscle are increased, but opioids also reduce peristalsis,
making a reduction in gastrointestinal motility their
overall effect. Additionally, they also increase the tone
of the pyloric, ileocolic and anal sphincters.
Loperamide, codeine and diphenoxylate are the main
opiates used in the treatment of diarrhoea. Loperamide
and codeine also have antisecretory effects besides inhibiting gastrointestinal motility. Note, however, that the
opioids used to treat diarrhoea have side-effects such as
constipation, drowsiness and abdominal cramps.

Antispasmodics
Antispasmodics are sometimes used in the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Two
types exist: muscarinic receptor antagonists and mebeverine. The former decrease muscle tone by inhibiting
parasympathetic activity in the alimentary tract. Examples are dicyclomine and propantheline. As would be
expected of parasympathetic blockade, side-effects include dry mouth, decreased sweating and blurred vision. Mebeverine acts directly on gastrointestinal
smooth muscle causing it to relax.

DISORDERS OF THE LARGE
INTESTINE
The diseases and disorders covered in this section affect
primarily the large intestine and/or both the small and
large intestine.

Congenital abnormalities
Hirschsprung’s disease
Hirschsprung’s disease is caused by an absence of ganglion cells in Auerbach’s and Meissner’s plexuses in
the distal bowel as a result of the failure of neuroblasts
to migrate during weeks 5–12 of gestation, resulting in
congential megacolon.

Fig. 5.7 The large intestine in Hirschsprung’s disease.

When these parasympathetic plexuses fail to develop, the circular muscle layer of the intestine goes into
spasm, resulting in intestinal obstruction. As in other
causes of obstruction, dilatation of the intestine occurs
proximal to the area in spasm (Fig. 5.7).
Hirschsprung’s disease usually affects the rectum and
distal colon but, in severe cases, it may also affect the
small intestine. The colon may become distended with
faeces resulting in megacolon and death from acute
enterocolitis.
It is four times more likely to occur in males and severe cases may become apparent shortly after birth with
symptoms of obstruction. Less severe cases may simply
result in chronic constipation.

Clinical Note
Megacolon may also be acquired. Causes of acquired
megacolon include Chagas’ disease, inflammatory
bowel disease, bowel obstruction and chronic
constipation in childhood.
Acquired megacolon may be differentiated from
Hirschsprung’s disease by rectal examination. In
patients with Hirschsprung’s disease, a narrow
empty segment of rectum can be felt, above which
the colon is dilated and full of faeces. In patients with
acquired megacolon, in contrast, no empty segment
of rectum is felt and faeces are present in the distal
rectum.

83

The large intestine
The incidence is 1 in 5000 live births; it is ten times
as likely to occur in children with Down’s syndrome
(trisomy 21) and is often found in association with
other congenital abnormalities.
Diagnosis is by barium enema and biopsy showing
an absence of ganglion cells. Pressure studies show
a failure of relaxation of the internal anal sphincter.
Treatment is with surgery.

Gastroschisis and exomphalos
Gastroschisis is a congenital herniation of bowel
through the abdominal wall, usually just to the right
of the umbilical cord.
The bowel is exposed to fetal urine in utero which
causes inflammation and paralytic ileus, and so neonates cannot be fed orally until the bowel recovers.
The condition is not associated with other abnormalities and overall mortality is about 5%.
Exomphalos occurs when the gut fails to return to
the abdominal cavity after its physiological herniation
and development outside the cavity during weeks 7–
11 of gestation. Affected children are born with gut
and sometimes liver protruding through the umbilicus, covered by amnion and hence protected from
fetal urine. This is the key feature distinguishing it
from gastroschisis, where the amnion does not cover
the herniated intestine. The condition is associated
with other congenital abnormalities however, most
commonly cardiac, renal or chromosomal. Overall
mortality is 25–50%.
Treatment of both conditions is surgical.

Infectious and inflammatory
disease
Diarrhoea
Diarrhoea is an increase in frequency of bowel opening
associated with looser stools. A more technical definition is passage of more than three unformed stools
per 24 hours. It is important to note that a change in
bowel habit, not the absolute frequency, is the key
abnormality.
More water is reabsorbed in the intestine than is
secreted. Clearly, if there is failure of absorption, the
faeces will contain abnormal amounts of water and
diarrhoea will result.
Dysentery is painful, bloody, but low-volume,
diarrhoea.
Reduced absorption may be due to one or more of a
number of factors including:
• An increase in the number of osmotic particles in the
lumen, resulting in a flow of water into the lumen
(osmotic diarrhoea)

• An increase in the rate of flow of intestinal contents,
leaving less time for the absorption processes to take
place (deranged motility diarrhoea)
• An abnormal increase in secretions of the gastrointestinal tract (secretory diarrhoea).
The main categories and causes of diarrhoea are summarized in Fig. 5.8. The investigation of choice is a stool
sample to determine whether an organism is responsible, which can then be treated accordingly. Treatment
has been discussed in the pharmacology section, with
the initial focus on maintaining fluid and electrolyte
balance.

Osmotic diarrhoea
Both electrolytes and absorbed nutrients (such as sugar
and amino acids) contribute to osmosis. If the absorption of either of these is reduced, e.g. in a protein-losing
enteropathy, osmotic diarrhoea will occur.

Secretory diarrhoea
Mature cells near the tips of the small intestinal villi are
responsible for absorption. They are stimulated to increase their rate of secretion by a number of factors such
as acetylcholine, substance P, 5-hydroxytryptamine
(serotonin) and neurotensin, all of which increase
intracellular calcium.
Potentially fatal secretory diarrhoea can also be
caused by cholera. The causative organism, Vibrio cholerae, is endemic in certain parts of the developing
world. Infection is spread by the faecal–oral route and
pandemics are by no means unusual.
The organism can survive in the acid conditions of
the stomach and multiplies in the small intestine where
it produces an enterotoxin that binds to receptors on the
immature cells in the crypts.

Disorders of the large intestine
This causes an increase in adenylate cyclase, elevating
cyclic AMP and increasing the secretion of Naþ, Cl– and
water into the lumen. The main symptom is profuse
‘rice water’ stools.
Treatment with oral rehydration therapy to replace
water and electrolytes is curative.

Deranged motility (rapid transit) diarrhoea
Increased gut motility leads to lack of absorption (due
to rapid transit), which can result in diarrhoea. Some
agents may stimulate secretion as well as motility.
Gastrointestinal stasis may also cause diarrhoea by
facilitating bacterial overgrowth.

5

Infective enterocolitis
Enterocolitis is inflammation of the intestines. It may be
caused by a variety of agents. In 40–50% of cases, no
specific agent is isolated and an educated guess must
be taken according to the age, circumstances and degree
of immunocompetence of the patient.
Improved sanitation has led to a decreased prevalence
of infective enterocolitis in the developed world, but it
still accounts for more than 50% of all deaths before
the age of 5 years worldwide and over 12 000 deaths each
day among children in developing countries.

Viral gastroenteritis
Parasitic causes of diarrhoea
The protozoan organisms Entamoeba histolytica and
Giardia lamblia commonly cause diarrhoea. Both are
transmitted by the faecal–oral route and are found most
commonly in developing countries.
Infection with the former may be asymptomatic
or cause amoebic dysentery (a notifiable disease),
which may have a gradual onset accompanied by systemic symptoms, such as anorexia and headache.
Treatment of acute amoebic dysentery is with
metronidazole. Diloxanide is given in chronic
disease.
Giardiasis causes steatorrhoea and abdominal pain.
It may also lead to malabsorption (see Chapter 4).
Treatment is with metronidazole.

HINTS AND TIPS
Inflammation, infection or neoplasms can cause
bloody diarrhoea. If the diarrhoea is very bloody
then it is due to chronic disease, such as a neoplasm
or ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel disease
can cause chronic exudative diarrhoea.

Gastroenteritis is the inflammation of the stomach and
intestines. The illness includes vomiting, fever, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. The rapid loss of water and
electrolytes can result in metabolic disturbances which
need correcting.
It is transmitted by the faecal–oral route, and causes
include rotaviruses, enteric adenoviruses, caliciviruses,
astroviruses and noroviruses (Fig. 5.9).

Bacterial enterocolitis
The major causes of bacterial enterocolitis are summarized in Fig. 5.10. In the UK, Campylobacter infection,
usually acquired by eating contaminated poultry, is
the commonest cause.
The principal mechanisms by which bacterial infection may lead to gastroenteritis are:
• The ingestion of a bacterial organism that proliferates in the gut lumen and that is enterotoxic
• Ingestion of a ready-made (preformed) toxin in contaminated food, which is heat stable, e.g. Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio cholerae and Clostridium perfringens
• The ingestion of an enteroinvasive bacterial organism, which proliferates in the gut and destroys the
mucosal epithelial cells.

The incubation period can give clues as to whether the
food poisoning was due to bacterial contamination or
preformed toxins. Usually, the incubation period of
bacterial contamination is longer, as time is required
to establish an enterotoxic colony in the gut.
Treatment consists of fluid replacement alongside
antibiotics.

Necrotizing enterocolitis
As the name suggests, this is a necrotizing inflammation
of the small and large intestines (primarily the terminal
ileum and ascending colon) and is the most common
acquired gastrointestinal emergency in neonates.
It is most common within the first few days of life
(when infants start oral feeding), but it may occur at
any time within the first 3 months, especially in premature or low-birth-weight babies being given formula
milk rather than breast milk.
Symptoms vary from mild gastrointestinal upset to
perforation of necrosed intestine leading to shock
and, if untreated, death. Surgical resection of affected
intestine may be necessary.

Pseudomembranous colitis
Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by an overgrowth
of Clostridium difficile, a bacillus which is carried by 2 %
of the population, asymptomatically. It usually occurs
post antibiotic therapy which suppresses the normal
colonic flora allowing C. difficile to proliferate.
There is loss of epithelial cells and the formation of a
whitish pseudomembrane on the bowel surface composed of mucin, polymorphs and fibrin.

86

While pseudomembranous colitis is associated
mainly with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially
cephalosporins, almost any antibiotic may precipitate
it. Elderly patients should not be put on cephalosporins
for this reason.
Transmission is promoted within the hospital environment, where patients with C. difficile have a
mortality of up to 30%.
Treatment is with oral metronidazole, while vancomycin is often used for recurrent infections.

Appendicitis
As mentioned above, acute appendicitis is usually
caused when the appendix is obstructed, mostly by
faecaliths. Rarely, it can occur when the appendix is
not obstructed, e.g. when the lymphoid follicles are
infected.
Typically, patients initially present with central abdominal pain, which then becomes localized to the
right iliac fossa as the peritoneum adjacent to the appendix is affected. Movement and coughing exacerbate
the pain. There may be fever, vomiting, and tachycardia
may be present.
Appendicectomy is curative, and needs doing
urgently to prevent the appendix from rupturing and
causing peritonitis.

Inflammatory bowel disease
There are two major non-specific inflammatory bowel
diseases: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The
main differences between them are demonstrated in
Figs 5.11 and 5.12.

Crohn’s disease
Crohn’s disease may affect any part of the gastrointestinal
tract from the mouth to the anus (Fig. 5.13). It is most
common in the terminal ileum and ascending colon.
Crohn’s disease is more frequent in the Western
world, particularly amongst Caucasians, where the prevalence is approximately 50–100 per 100 000. Its peak
onset is between 20 and 40 years of age and both sexes
are equally affected.
There is a high rate of concordance in monozygotic
twins, which suggests both a genetic and environmental
cause. However, the exact aetiology is unknown. There
is a 3–4-fold increase in risk with smoking and Crohn’s
patients generally eat a diet higher in refined sugars and
lower in fibre than those without Crohn’s.
Macroscopically, the bowel appears bright red and
swollen. Later, small, discrete aphthoid ulcers with a
haemorrhagic rim form, so named because they look
similar to aphthous ulcers in the mouth.
These progress to deeper longitudinal ulcers, which
may develop into deep fissures involving the full thickness of the wall of the gastrointestinal tract. Because of
this, the mucosa is often described as cobble-stoned
(Fig 5.12). Aggregations of inflammatory cells and lymphocytes infiltrate the bowel wall. Mesenteric lymph

nodes may be enlarged due to reactive hyperplasia.
Granulomas may be present in the lymph nodes.
HINTS AND TIPS
Granulomas are collections of epithelioid macrophages
and giant cells surrounded by a cuff of lymphocytes.
The non-caseating granulomas in Crohn’s disease are
different from those found in tuberculosis, which are
tubercular granulomas characterized by central
caseous (cheese-like) necrosis.

Damage to the gastrointestinal tract in Crohn’s disease is often patchy (skip lesions) with normal areas
of tissue found in between the patches.
Symptoms include diarrhoea, with or without malabsorption, abdominal cramps, fever, malaise and
weight loss. Clinical signs include:
•
•
•
•
•

Abdominal tenderness
Perianal lesions
Anaemia
Aphthous ulcers in the mouth

A variety of lesions may be seen around the anus,
most commonly skin tags, fissures and fistulae in
60% of patients.

Treatment
Fig. 5.12 Histopathological features of ulcerative colitis and
Crohn’s disease. Unlike Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis is
continuous and areas of normal gut are not found between
lesions.

Diagnosis involves colonoscopy with biopsy and
contrast radiography.

Complications
Complications depend on the site and extent of the
lesions.
Malabsorption may occur where large areas of small
intestine are affected (short bowel syndrome, following
surgical resection). Fistulae may form because of deep
fissuring. These may be internal (between loops of gut
or from the gut to the bladder), perianal, or, following
surgery, open onto the skin.
Crohn’s disease may also cause stricture formation,
which may lead to obstruction.
Acutely, perforation or haemorrhage may occur.

88

All Crohn’s disease patients require symptomatic relief
and, for some, this is all the treatment they ever need.
Diarrhoea is treated with anti-diarrhoeal drugs, such
as loperamide and codeine phosphate. Depending on
disease activity, further treatments are often required.
To treat an acute flare up, corticosteroids are the
main treatments used to induce remission. In secondary
care, immunosuppressive treatments such as ciclosporin or azathioprine are often required. Sulfasalazine
(an aminosalicylate) is also used to prevent relapses.
Cytokine-modulating drugs such as infliximab induce
remission in 70–80% of patients unresponsive to
corticosteroids.
Antibiotics, such as metronidazole are useful in severe perianal disease.
However, 80% of patients will require surgery at
some point in their life because of:
• Failure to thrive in children
• Complications, e.g. perforation, obstruction, stricture or fistula formation
• Failure or side effects of drug therapy.

Disorders of the large intestine
Surgery is never curative. Remission is achievable,
but most patients have significant relapses.

Ulcerative colitis
Ulcerative colitis only affects the large intestine
(Fig. 5.11). Ulcerative colitis affects more patients than
Crohn’s disease with a prevalence is 100–120 per
100 000. It affects women more than men and is most
common between the ages of 20 and 40 years, although
it can occur at any age.
It usually starts in the rectum and it may extend proximally, although never beyond the colon. Occasionally,
inflammation of the terminal ileum is seen (backwash
ileitis) but this is a result of an incompetent ileocaecal
valve rather than ulcerative colitis itself. Its aetiology
is unknown, although possible causative agents include
genetics, infection and immunological factors.
Unlike Crohn’s, which commonly shows skip lesions, ulcerative colitis is continuous. Areas of normal
gut are not found between lesions.
The disease is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disorder. Inflammation is diffuse but superficial. The mucosa is granular and haemorrhagic (Fig. 5.12), rarely
involving the muscle layer.
Both acute and chronic inflammatory cells are found
infiltrating the mucosa, and aggregates of polymorphs
are seen in the crypts (crypt abscesses). Healing of ulcers
leads to periods of remission but, in areas of healing, the
normal large bowel epithelium may be replaced by a
simple layer of mucus-secreting cells without crypts.
The major symptom in ulcerative colitis is bloody
exudative diarrhoea. Often lower abdominal pain,
anorexia and malaise accompany this. If the disease is
confined to the rectum, urgency and tenesmus accompany the bloody diarrhoea.
Diagnosis requires rectal examination, sigmoidoscopy and biopsy. A barium enema can show fine
ulceration.

Complications
The mucosa may haemorrhage, leading to blood loss
and anaemia.
Toxic megacolon, where the colonic diameter is
greater than 6 cm may occur in acute fulminating cases.
It allows passage of bacterial toxins into the systemic circulation and predisposes to perforation.
Extraintestinal complications may also occur in both
Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis (Fig. 5.13). These
include:
• Skin involvement: pyoderma gangrenosum and/or
erythema nodosum
• Primary sclerosing cholangitis
• Fatty liver and/or liver abscesses
• Iritis and/or episcleritis
• Arthritis and spondylitis.

5

Treatment
There are two types of treatment for ulcerative colitis,
depending on whether acute management or the maintenance of remission is needed. Acute cases are treated
with corticosteroids. All ulcerative colitis patients are
treated with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA, e.g. mesalazine) or sulfasalazine (a compound of 5-ASA and sulfapyridine) to maintain remission and reduce the risk of
colon cancer.
Azathioprine is an immunosuppressant can induce
remission in more resistant cases.
Surgery is curative in ulcerative colitis. Indications
include:
• Toxic megacolon (surgical emergency)
• Acute ulcerative colitis not responding to medical
treatment
• Chronic colitis leading to poor quality of life.
Prognosis of inflammamtory bowel disease varies greatly
depending on the extent of the disease. It is important to
distinguish between a diagnosis of Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis as the management of each is different
(Fig. 5.14).

Inflammatory bowel disease and colon
cancer
In patients with ulcerative colitis there is a 5–10-fold increased risk of developing colorectal carcinoma compared to the normal population. This risk is thought
to be comparable for patients with Crohn’s disease,
however there are no accurate figures yet.
Currently all patients with inflammatory bowel disease are offered enrolment into a national surveillance
programme where they have episodic colonoscopies
and random biopsies taken. Patients are classed as either low risk, intermediate risk or high risk, and then
followed up at 5, 3 and 1 years, respectively.
The finding of dysplasia from a biopsy taken at endoscopy is an indication for colectomy.

Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional bowel
disease. No single cause has been identified, and it is diagnosed on the basis of the presence of particular symptoms and the exclusion of organic diseases.
IBS is very common, affecting 10–20% of the general
population, and is more prevalent in young women. It
comprises a cluster of symptoms, the most important
being abdominal pain, altered bowel habit, abdominal
distension, tenesmus and the presence of rectal mucus.
Diagnostic criteria for IBS are:
• Exclusion of structural or metabolic abnormalities,
e.g. ulcers, inflammatory bowel disease, lactose
intolerance

• Presence of two or more accompanying symptoms:
– Pain relieved by defecation
– Onset of pain associated with a change in frequency of the stools
– Onset of pain associated with a change in the form
of the stools.
Irritable bowel syndrome is generally referred to as
constipation-predominant or diarrhoea-predominant.
The course of the disease is often relapsing and remitting.
Stress can bring on attacks of IBS.
A management algorithm for IBS is given in Fig. 5.15.
Reassurance and explanation is very important, alongside lifestyle and dietary advice.

Bowel obstruction
Bowel obstruction may have mechanical or nonmechanical causes (pseudo-obstruction).
The signs and symptoms are similar, regardless of the
cause, and depend primarily on the level of the obstruction. Patients will usually complain of absolute constipation, were they don’t pass any flatus. Vomiting is a
symptom of high obstruction, but it may be absent
(or occur late) in low-level obstruction. Conversely,

90

distension and colic are early symptoms of obstruction
lower in the intestine.
Obstruction causes distension of the gut, with a
build-up of gas and intestinal secretions above the level
of the obstruction. There is progressive depletion of
extracellular fluid and the multiplication of bacteria,
especially coliforms, Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium
perfringens and Bacteroides.
Diagnosis requires a thorough history and erect
and supine radiography. This shows distended, gasfilled loops of bowel with multiple horizontal fluid
levels.
Treatment depends on the cause and level of the
obstruction, and whether the bowel is strangulated.
Strangulated bowel is an emergency and requires urgent
surgery.
Simple obstruction, i.e. not due to strangulation may
be treated conservatively initially. Conservative treatment consists of ‘drip and suck’: intravenous fluids
and continuous aspiration by nasogastric tube.
HINTS AND TIPS
In general, obstruction high in the gastrointestinal tract
presents with vomiting. Obstruction lower down
causes distension.

Causes of bowel obstruction
Mechanical causes of obstruction of a tube like the intestine may be:
• In the wall, e.g. malignancy, inflammatory bowel
disease, congenital strictures and diverticular disease
• In the lumen, e.g. foreign material, faecaliths, polypoid tumours and meconium in cystic fibrosis
• Outside the wall, e.g. intussusception, adhesions,
hernias, volvulus and intra-abdominal tumours.
Pseudo-obstruction may be due to Hirschsprung’s disease, paralytic ileus and bowel infarction.
Paralytc ileus is an obstruction of the intestine caused
by partial or complete paralysis of the intestinal muscles, resulting in lack of peristalsis. It occurs transiently
after almost every laparotomy. Other major causes
include interruption of the autonomic innervation of
the gut, peritonitis (which may cause toxin-mediated
paralysis of the intrinsic nerve plexuses of the gut)
and potassium depletion.

Hernias
A hernia is the protrusion of any organ or tissue through
its coverings and outside its normal body cavity.

Hernias are common, occurring in about 1% of
the population, and may be congenital or acquired
(Fig. 5.16). Within these two groups, they may be reducible, irreducible or strangulated (Fig. 5.17).
Reducible hernias can be pushed back into the compartment from which they came, while irreducible ones
cannot and may become strangulated if their blood
supply is cut off by the neck of the sac.
Strangulated hernias present with signs and symptoms of obstruction and if untreated, become gangrenous and necrotic. The most common sites of
herniation through the abdominal wall are:
•
•
•
•
•

Inguinal (about 90%)
Femoral
Umbilical
Incisional
Ventral and epigastric.

Inguinal hernias may be:
• Direct (protruding through the posterior wall of the
inguinal canal)
• Indirect (passing through the inguinal canal).
Direct inguinal hernias are less common (20% of
inguinal hernias) and they lie medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Indirect hernias are much more common,

Some are congenital, but most occur as a result of
post-inflammatory scarring, most commonly from scars
that form following surgery.
Adhesions may cause external constriction of the
bowel, leading to obstruction or strangulation. Urgent
surgery is required to relieve the strangulation.

lie lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels and are more
likely to strangulate, as the neck (the internal ring of the inguinal canal) is narrower. See also Crash Course: Anatomy.
Treatment depends on the type of hernia. Reducible
hernias often require no treatment so long as they remain reducible. Strangulated hernias must be treated
surgically.
Synthetic meshes are often used to reinforce closure
of hernia orifices.

Adhesions
Adhesions occur where two parts of the body that are
normally separate are connected by bands of fibrous
tissue.

92

Intussusception occurs when one segment of bowel (the
intussusceptum) slides inside the adjacent segment
(Fig. 5.18), like a telescope. It is most common in early
childhood (95% of all cases) and occurs mainly at the
ileocaecal valve (ileocolic intussusception), although
it may also occur at other sites. The ratio of males to females affected is 2:1.
The aetiology is unclear, but it may be related to an
adenovirus causing enlargement of lymphatic tissue in
the intestinal wall. This protrudes into the lumen and
is pushed into the adjacent section by peristalsis.
In some cases a polyp (such as Peutz–Jeghers
polyps), Meckel’s diverticulum or carcinoma may
project into the lumen and be pushed along in a
similar way.
Patients present aged 5–12 months of age, with periods of screaming, vomiting, blood in the faeces (‘redcurrant jelly’) and drawing up of the legs. The child is
pale and a sausage-shaped mass may be felt on palpation of the abdomen.
Peritonitis and gangrene may occur within 24 hours
if untreated. A barium enema may resolve the intussusception by forcing the invaginated segment back with
hydrostatic pressure. Alternatively, surgery may be
required.

Volvulus
Volvulus occurs when a loop of bowel is twisted 180
about its mesenteric axis. This usually occurs in the sigmoid colon, but it may be found in the caecum, small
intestine, gall bladder or stomach. It is rare in the UK.
Risk factors include chronic constipation, adhesions
and abnormally mobile loops of intestine.
Twisting of the bowel causes obstruction and occlusion of the vessels supplying the affected section. Potentially fatal gangrene and peritonitis may occur if the
volvulus is not treated. Symptoms include the sudden
onset of colicky pain in the right iliac fossa and rapid
abdominal distension.
Diagnosis is by plain radiography, which shows a
dilated section of bowel full of gas and forming a characteristic loop or inverted ‘U’ (the ‘bent inner tube’
sign). Treatment depends on the site of the volvulus:
surgery is often necessary. Sigmoid volvulus is sometimes resolved by sigmoidoscopy and the passing of
a flatus tube.

Diverticulosis
Some important definitions:
• A diverticulum is an outpouching of the wall of the
gut. They occur at weak points in the wall, usually
due to increased pressure from within the gut or
pulling from outside
• Diverticulosis means that diverticula are present
• Diverticular disease means that diverticula are causing symptoms, such as abdominal pain or change in
bowel habit. However, the pain is due to muscle
spasm, not inflammation

• Diverticulitis means that one or more diverticula
are inflamed. This is usually caused by an infection
and leads to inflammatory abdominal pain and
diarrhoea, or constipation.

Diverticulosis
Diverticula may be congenital or acquired. They may
occur in any part of the gut.
Congenital diverticula are outpouchings of the full
thickness of the bowel wall. They are found most commonly in the duodenum and jejunum. They are usually
asymptomatic, but they may lead to bacterial overgrowth, steatorrhoea and vitamin B12 malabsorption.
They may also perforate or bleed.
Acquired colonic diverticula increase in incidence
with increasing age. They are predominantly a Western
condition, present in about 50% of people aged over
50 years. There is no difference in distribution between
the sexes. Low-fibre diets are a risk factor. 95% of diverticulae are found in the sigmoig colon.
They form when the muscle layer of the wall thickens
(hypertrophies) and high intraluminal pressures force a
pouch of mucosa out through an area of weakness in the
muscle layer. Areas of weakness often occur near blood
vessels (Fig. 5.19).
Acquired diverticula do not consist of all three layers
of the intestinal wall and this differentiates them from
congenital ones.
Diagnosis of diverticula is often incidental during
other investigations. As over 90% of cases are asymptomatic, in many cases no treatment is required.
Patients should, however, be advised to increase the
amount of fibre and liquids in their diet (fibre has no beneficial effect unless there is sufficient liquid in the diet).

Diverticulitis
Diverticulitis may occur if the neck of the diverticulum becomes obstructed by faeces. Patients with
acute diverticulitis often present with severe left iliac
fossa pain.
Signs include tenderness and guarding on the left
side of the abdomen, pyrexia and tachycardia. Radiographs should be taken to exclude air under the
diaphragm (an indication of perforation).
Complications include:
• Haemorrhage if a vessel is eroded
• Perforation, causing peritonitis if it occurs into the
peritoneal cavity, abscess formation or fistulae if it
occurs into the bladder or vagina
• Chronic infection causing fibrosis and obstruction.
In the absence of complications, acute diverticulitis is
treated conservatively with a liquid diet and appropriate
antibiotic treatment.

94

Vascular disorders
Bowel ischaemia
Essentially, the causes of ischaemic bowel disease are
the same as ischaemia in other parts of the body. Causes
include:
•
•
•
•

Stenosis
Thrombosis
Emboli
Strangulation may also cause ischaemia as the blood
supply is disrupted.

Ischaemic bowel disease may occur in the small intestine or the colon. The effect depends on the size of
the ischaemic area and the length of time ischaemia
has persisted. It may be classified as mucosal, mural
or transmural.
The blood supply to the wall is ‘from outside in’
and mucosal or mural infarction often results from

Disorders of the large intestine

underperfusion. Transmural infarction is usually due to
mechanical compromise of the artery.
The splenic flexure and an area of the rectum are
particularly prone to ischaemic damage. These are the
‘watershed’ areas where the arterial supply switches
from the superior to the inferior mesenteric artery, and
from the inferior mesenteric and hypogastric arteries,
respectively (Fig. 5.20).
Mucosal ischaemia causes release of proteolytic
enzymes, which may cause deeper damage to the wall.
However, complete regeneration is more common.
After mural ischaemia, ulcers form, the mucosa
haemorrhages and granulation tissue forms. This is
replaced by fibrotic tissue, which can form a stricture.
Transmural ischaemia leads to gangrene, perforation
and, if untreated, death. It should be suspected in any
elderly patient with atherosclerosis or atrial fibrillation
with a tender abdomen and absent bowel sounds.
Symptoms in acute bowel ischaemia include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Acute severe abdominal pain
No abdominal signs, such as distension
Shock, due to hypovolaemia
Increased haemoglobin and white cell count
Persistent metabolic acidosis
Gasless abdomen on X-ray.

Diagnosis relies on abdominal X-ray and endoscopy.
A sigmoidoscopy shows a normal rectal mucosa, but
it also shows blood and mucus coming from further
along the bowel. A full colonoscopy is not performed,
due to the risk of perforation.
Histological changes in chronic ischaemic bowel disease include fibrosis, haemorrhage, ulceration and

granulation. On biopsy, the mucosa has a large infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells. Macrophages laden
with haemosiderin are uncommon, but thought to be
characteristic of ischaemic bowel disease.
The patient is treated with fluid replacement, heparin
and antibiotics. Surgery is absolutely necessary to remove the dead segment of bowel. Revascularization
may also be attempted, but note that reperfusion injury
caused by free radicals commonly occurs following
hypoperfusion.
The prognosis is poor in acute bowel ischaemia, with
a less than 20% survival rate.

Angiodysplasia
Angiodysplasia refers to small vascular anomalies, most
commonly venous malformations in the mucosa or
submucosa. They are usually asymptomatic and their
only presentation is bleeding from the large bowel. They
occur in the elderly and can be diagnosed by angiography or colonoscopy. The right side of the colon is
affected more commonly than the left.
Treatment is by diathermy coagulation or surgical
removal.

Haemorrhoids
Haemorrhoids are the enlargement of the normal
spongy blood-filled cushions in the wall of the anus.
They are the most common cause of rectal bleeding,
and patients normally complain of blood on the toilet
paper after defecation.

95

The large intestine
The anal cushions (and hence sites of haemorrhoids)
are at 3, 7 and 11 o’clock when viewed in the lithotomy
position and attached by elastic tissue and smooth
muscle.
However, gravity, increased anal tone and straining on
defecation all put stress on the cushions, making them
protrude and bleed readily from the underlying capillaries.
Pregnancy and portal hypertension (see Chapter 6) can
also cause haemorrhoids.
Haemorrhoids are classified as:
• First degree (confined to the anal canal, and which
bleed but do not prolapse)
• Second degree (which prolapse on defecation, but
spontaneously reduce)
• Third degree (which prolapse on defecation, but require reduction with the fingers).
Patients present with bright red bleeding from the
rectum, and they are often very anaemic.Mucus discharge and pruritus ani (anal itching) accompany this.
Often internal haemorrhoids are asymptomatic.
Diagnosis involves rectal examination, proctoscopy
and exclusion of any abdominal malignancies, which
may also cause bleeding.
Haemorrhoids are often self-limiting, however in
more troublesome cases injection of a sclerosant or elastic band ligation may be required. Haemorrhoidectomy
is usually reserved for irreducible and problematic cases.

Neoplastic disease
Hamartomatous polyps
Some 90% of colonic epithelial polyps are nonneoplastic and therefore benign. Hamartomatous polyps
are an example. They are derived from overgrowth of mature tissue and are usually large and pedunculated. They
fall into two main categories: juvenile and Peutz–Jeghers
polyps.
HINTS AND TIPS
Hamartomas are malformations containing two or
more types of mature cell which are normally present in
the organ in which they arise. They are always benign.

Juvenile polyps
Juvenile polyps are usually solitary focal hamartomatous malformations of mucosal tissue.
They occur in children and teenagers, but they are
most common below the age of 5 years. About 80%
of them occur in the rectum.
However, in juvenile polyposis, an autosomal dominant condition presenting with ten or more colonic
polyps, the risk of colonic cancer is increased. Children

96

with this must begin a screening programme to help
spot cancer in its early stages.

Peutz–Jeghers polyps
Peutz–Jeghers syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant
syndrome characterized by multiple polyps scattered
throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Abnormal pigmentation also occurs in the skin and oral mucosa.
The polyps may bleed and cause anaemia. Although
the polyps themselves are not premalignant, being
hamartomas, people with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome do
have a slightly increased risk of developing certain carcinomas, notably in the gastrointestinal tract and ovary.

Neoplastic epithelial lesions
Adenomas
Adenomas are derived from glandular epithelium, and
they are the most important of the epithelial polyps.
They are relatively common, especially in the elderly.
Of all adenomas, 75% are tubular, 10% villous and
the remainder a mixture of the two (tubulovillous).
Villous adenomas are usually sessile and larger (up to
several centimetres in diameter) than tubular adenomas, and as the name suggests, have villi lined with dysplastic columnar epithelium protruding from their
surface.
Almost all colonic carcinomas originate from an adenomatous polyp. The malignant potential of an adenoma is related to increasing polyp size and the
histological type with villous adenomas having a greater
tendency to malignant change (Fig. 5.21).
Adenomas and other polyps are usually incidental
findings when patients are undergoing endoscopy. They
should be removed endoscopically to prevent premalignant transformation.

Familial adenomatous polyposis
People with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a
rare autosomal dominant disorder, almost always develop cancer of the intestine by the age of 35 years.
FAP is characterized by the development of numerous
adenomas in the large and, to a lesser extent, the small
intestine during the teens and twenties.
The gene involved in FAP is called APC and is on the
long arm of chromosome 5 (between q21 and q22).
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are thought to
be protective.

Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer
Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) is
an autosomal dominant disorder which is similar to
FAP in that it greatly predisposes to colorectal cancer,
but has an increased prevalence. The carcinomas also

tend to be more aggressive in nature, with a propensity
to produce mucin.
Other associated carcinomas include those of the
stomach, ovary and endometrium. The cause is a mutation, of which four have been identified, in DNA mismatch genes. The two most important mutations are
those in hMSH2 (chromosome 2p) and hMLH1 (chromosome 3p).
Patients with HNPCC or FAP should be offered regular endoscopic screening.

Colorectal cancer
Colorectal cancer is common in the developed world. It
is the second biggest cause of cancer death in the UK,
coming second only to lung cancer. Incidence increases
with age and is more common in males.

As mentioned above the majority of tumours are adenocarcinomas which evolve from polyps. Aetiology is
also closely related to diet. Western diets which are high
in fat and low in fibre carry a greater risk of colorectal
cancer.
Fibre increases the bulk of faeces as long as fluid intake is adequate, which reduces the time taken for the
contents of the intestine to pass through and out of
the rectum. In a low-fibre diet, faeces remain in the intestine for longer, altering the normal flora. This is
thought to predispose to cancer.
The main clinical features are:
• Altered bowel habit for greater than 6 weeks
• Rectal bleeding (more common in left-sided
tumours)
• Iron deficient anaemia (often how right-sided
tumours present)

• Colicky abdominal pain
• Palpable mass (either abdominal or on rectal
examination)
• Weight loss.
Colonoscopy is the gold standard investigation as it also
allows biopsies to be taken for a histological diagnosis.
Surgery is the mainstay of treatment if the disease is
confined to the colon. Depending on the site of the tumour an end-to-end anastomosis or end colostomy will
be performed. Chemotherapy is often useful in metastatic disease.
The commonest site for metastases is the liver. Following this, other sites include lung, brain and bone.
Prognosis after diagnosis of colorectal cancer depends on the stage, with an overall survival rate of
30% at 5 years. Dukes’ classification is most widely used
(Fig. 5.22) and is a common examination question.
Dukes’ stages are:
• Stage A: invaded submucosa and muscle layer of the
bowel, but confined to the wall
• Stage B: breached the muscle layer and bowel wall,
but no involvement of lymph nodes
• Stage C1: spread to immediately draining pericolic
lymph nodes
• Stage C2: spread to higher mesenteric lymph nodes
• Stage D: distant visceral metastases (5-year survival – 5%).

Colorectal cancer screening
Screening for colorectal cancer has been rolled out
across the UK in recent years. Early detection is important as it improves both mortality and morbidity rates.
By the time patients present with symptoms of colorectal cancer, the majority of patients are at least
Duke’s Stage B, so if these patients could be picked

98

up whilst at Duke’s stage A it would improve survival
rates.
Faecal occult blood screening is offered to all UK residents between the ages of 60–69. Patients are asked to
send a stool sample off for analysis, and if they are
judged to be at risk then they are offered a colonoscopy.
Sensitivity and specificity for the detection of colorectal
cancer has still to be confirmed.

Other neoplasms – Carcinoid tumours
These arise from neuroendocrine (APUD) cells (see
Chapters 3 and 4) in the gut and elsewhere, e.g. pancreas, biliary tract and lung. They are slow growing
and potentially malignant but their malignant potential
depends on the site.
Larger tumours in the appendix and ileum tend to
spread to regional lymph nodes and the liver. Small
tumours (less than 2-cm diameter) near the tip of the
appendix rarely do so.
Because of the cells in which they arise, tumours
produce hormones that may have local or systemic
effects:
• 5-HT produced by midgut carcinoid tumours causes
diarrhoea and borborygmi as a result of local stimulation of the contractility of the intestine
• 5-HT may also be produced from metastases in the
liver and give rise to the carcinoid syndrome with facial flushing, cyanosis and pulmonary and tricuspid
valve stenosis or incompetence
• Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) may be secreted and can result in Cushing’s syndrome.
Palliative treatment is usually given. Survival can be anything from 3 years to 30 years, even if metastases are
present.

OVERVIEW
The liver is the largest abdominal organ and also the
largest gland in the body. It is vital for life, and it
has many metabolic, endocrine and detoxifying
functions.

ANATOMY
The liver is situated under the diaphragm and weighs
about 1.5 kg. It is surrounded by a capsule of strong
connective tissue (Glisson’s capsule).
It lies in the right upper quadrant and occupies
most of the right hypochondriac region, extending into
the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions (see
Fig. 1.1).
The liver is protected by the rib cage and moves
during respiration, owing to its attachment to the
diaphragm by the falciform, coronary and triangular
ligaments (Fig. 6.1).
The lesser omentum connects the stomach to the
liver, and it is continuous with the left triangular
ligament.
The liver has diaphragmatic and visceral (posteroinferior) surfaces. The sharp inferior border separates the
two surfaces. The visceral surface is related to:
• The abdominal oesophagus
• The fundus and body of the stomach
• The lesser omentum

•

superior part of the duodenum
transverse colon, including the hepatic flexure
right kidney and associated adrenal gland.

Peritoneum covers the visceral surface (except the gall
bladder and porta hepatis) and the superior part of
the liver, except the posterior part known as the bare
area. This area is in direct contact with the diaphragm
and is situated between the reflections of the coronary
ligament. The inferior vena cava and the right adrenal
gland also lie next to the bare area (Fig. 6.2).
Macroscopically and functionally, the liver is comprised of two ‘true’ lobes, the left and the right, by the
plane joining the tip of the gall bladder and the groove
of the inferior vena cava. This division is made on the
basis of the blood supply (Fig. 6.3) and bile drainage.
There are also two minor lobes (used for descriptive
purposes) called the caudate and quadrate lobes. The
left lobe includes the caudate lobe and most of the
quadrate lobe.
In terms of blood supply that can be surgically
isolated, the liver has eight segments (of Couinaud)
which may be an important consideration when resection for primary or metastatic cancer is being contemplated. The segments can be mapped onto the lobes
(Fig. 6.4).
The space between the visceral surface of the right
lobe and the right kidney is the hepatorenal recess;
the diaphragmatic recess separates the diaphragmatic
surface from the diaphragm.

The liver

Blood supply
The liver has a very rich blood supply from two main
sources:
• The hepatic artery (a branch of the coeliac trunk),
which divides into left and right branches to supply
the left and right lobes. This supplies about 30% of
the blood to the liver
• The portal vein, which carries venous blood rich in
products of digestion from the gastrointestinal
(GI) tract. It supplies 70% of the blood to the liver,
and divides into left and right branches to supply the
two functional lobes. An accessory left hepatic artery,
often arising from the left gastric artery, may be
found.
The main branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein
divide each lobe into the vascular segments mentioned
earlier. There are eight segments in the whole of the
liver.
The hepatic veins drain from the central veins of each
lobule into the inferior vena cava.

Lymphatic drainage
The lymphatics of the liver drain to deep and superficial
vessels.
The deep vessels come together at the porta hepatis
and end in the hepatic lymph nodes scattered along
the hepatic vessels, e.g. the cystic lymph node near
the neck of the gall bladder. These then drain to the
coeliac lymph nodes to enter the thoracic duct.
Some deep lymph vessels follow the hepatic veins
through the diaphragm to end in the phrenic lymph
nodes.
The superficial lymph vessels follow the same drainage as the deep vessels, but they can also drain to the
mediastinal lymph nodes.

EMBRYOLOGY AND
DEVELOPMENT
The liver develops from the liver bud (hepatic diverticulum) that appears as an outgrowth of the endodermal
epithelium at the distal end of the primitive foregut in
the middle of the 3rd week (Fig. 6.5).
The liver bud is composed of rapidly proliferating
cells, which penetrate the mesodermal septum transversum. The connection between the liver bud and the
foregut (duodenum) narrows and forms the bile duct.
A small ventral outgrowth from the bile duct gives
rise to the gallbladder and cystic duct. The structure of
the liver is formed by epithelial liver cords that mix with
the vitelline and umbilical veins to give rise to hepatic
sinusoids.
The liver cords differentiate into the hepatocytes (parenchyma), the bile canaliculi, and the hepatic ducts.
The mesoderm of the septum transversum gives rise to:
• Haematopoietic cells
• Kupffer cells
• Connective tissue cells.
The liver is the major haematopoietic organ in the embryo, and by the 4th week, haematopoiesis has already
begun.
The lesser omentum and the falciform ligament
are both also derived from the mesoderm of the septum transversum, located between the foregut and
liver, and the ventral abdominal wall and the liver,
respectively.
The rotation of the stomach, liver and spleen occurs
between the 6th week and 11th week of embryonic
development.
At about the 12th week, the hepatocytes begin to
form bile. This is able to enter the duodenum, as the
biliary tract and gallbladder are both fully formed.

Nerve supply
The liver receives both sympathetic and parasympathetic
innervation. The nerve fibres reach the liver via the hepatic plexus, which is derived from the coeliac plexus.
It also receives parasympathetic innervation from the
right phrenic nerve and left and right vagi (Xth cranial
nerves).
The hepatic nerves follow the blood supply of the
liver and enter at the porta hepatis.
HINTS AND TIPS
The porta hepatis is a deep fissure on the visceral
surface of the liver, and it contains the hepatic artery,
portal vein, hepatic nerve plexus, hepatic ducts and
lymphatic vessels.

102

HINTS AND TIPS
Hepatocytes are highly metabolically active and rich in
cytoplasmic organelles, especially mitochondria.

HISTOLOGY
Traditionally, there are three ways of describing the
structural units of the liver (Fig. 6.6):
• Classical lobule – each lobule may be thought of as a
hexagon with a central vein at its centre and a portal
triad at its outer corners. A portal triad consists of a
branch of the hepatic artery, a branch of the portal
vein and a bile duct

• Portal lobule – this views the liver as being made up
of a series of triangles with a central vein at each corner and a portal triad at the centre, and it emphasizes
exocrine function
• Acinus – an elliptical unit with a portal triad at the
centre and a central vein at each pole, and it emphasizes endocrine function.

poisoning. Most of the metabolic activity of the liver
takes place here.
Conversely, zone 3, being furthest from the portal
triad and closest to the central vein, is most susceptible
to ischaemic damage, e.g. in heart failure.

Acinus

Different types of cell make up the architecture of the
liver: hepatocytes, Kupffer cells, haematopoietic cells
and perisinusoidal cells. The functions of these
cells are summarized in Fig. 6.7.

This is a more accurate description of the functional unit
within the structure of the liver parenchyma. It reflects
the gradient of metabolic activity found in the liver,
and is divided into three zones for descriptive purposes:
• The periportal zone (zone 1)
• The midzone (zone 2)
• The centrilobular zone (zone 3).
Most oxygenated blood is found in the centre of the
acinus around the portal triad (zone 1); this zone is
adjacent to the portal canal and receives the most
blood from the hepatic artery and portal vein. Therefore, it is most susceptible to damage from toxins
carried to the liver in the hepatic portal vein and toxins
absorbed from the alimentary tract, e.g. in paracetamol

Types of cell

Sinusoids, perisinusoidal spaces
and bile canaliculi
The hepatocytes are arranged in ‘cords’, which radiate
out in a spoke-like fashion from the central vein
(Fig. 6.8). They are large, eosinophilic cells with round
nuclei. An interesting feature is that more than half of
the cells are tetraploid, i.e. they have four times the
number of normal chromosomes. They have a network
of capillaries, or sinusoids, between them, which are
lined with discontinuous fenestrated endothelium, stellate cells and phagocytic Kupffer cells. Kupffer cells are

part of the monocyte–macrophage system and phagocytose old erythrocytes and other cellular debris from the
circulation.
In between the hepatocytes and the sinusoidal endothelial cells is the perisinusoidal space (of Disse). This contains
perisinusoidal cells (stellate, or Ito, cells) which secrete
collagen, providing a supportive mesh. It is these cells
which contribute to fibrosis in liver damage (see later).

104

At their sinusoidal surface, the hepatocytes have numerous short microvilli, which extend into the perisinusoidal space. Between the bases of the microvilli lie
coated pits that are used for endocytosis.
The microvilli increase the surface area for the transfer of digestive products, nutrients, oxygen, and other
substances between the blood in the sinusoids and
the hepatocytes.

Portal canal and limiting plate

Two surfaces of each hepatocyte communicate with a
space of Disse and two surfaces communicate with a bile
canaliculus (Fig. 6.9).
Bile canaliculi are formed by a groove between surfaces of adjacent hepatocytes and they are sealed by
zonulae occludentes, which prevent leakage of bile into
the intercellular spaces.
The canaliculi form rings around the hepatocytes and
approach the bile ductules in the portal tracts by opening into canals (of Hering). These are short corridors

The portal canal consists of the portal triad (hepatic portal vein, hepatic artery and bile duct) surrounded by
connective tissue.
A small space (the space of Mall) exists between the
connective tissue covering and the surrounding hepatocytes. Lymph is thought to originate in the space
of Mall.
The limiting plate (the hepatocytes of the periportal
zone), which surrounds the portal tract, makes up a
protective layer of cells, which are first to be exposed
to toxins in the systemic or portal blood. Breaching
the plate can lead to liver damage, in particular
cirrhosis.

FUNCTIONS AND PHYSIOLOGY
The liver performs many functions vital for life. The
main functions of the liver are metabolism of protein,
fat and carbohydrate; bile production; storage of vitamins, minerals, and glycogen; biotransformation; and
detoxification and protection (by filtration of portal
blood). These are summarized in Fig. 6.10.

To maintain these functions, the liver must receive
25% of the cardiac output through the portal vein
and hepatic artery. Nutrients and other substances
are absorbed from the sinusoids into the hepatocytes.
The varied nature of hepatic function requires that
the hepatocytes differ functionally from each other.
The functional differences correspond to the zones
of the liver acinus (see earlier). The cells in each zone
differ in ultrastructure, function, and distance from
the blood supply, with zone 1 being nearest to the arterial supply and zone 3 the furthest. Functional differences include:
• The periportal hepatocytes take up bile under normal circumstances, but during bile overload, this
function is also adopted by the centrilobular (perivenous) hepatocytes
• The centrilobular hepatocytes contain enzymes
required in esterification, but the periportal hepatocytes are rich in oxidative enzymes.

glycogen

Carbohydrate metabolism
In the normal individual, blood glucose levels are
carefully regulated. The liver plays an important role
in glucose homeostasis.
Blood glucose levels rise transiently after a meal
but the liver takes up the glucose and converts it to
glycogen.
In the fasting state, glycogen is converted to glucose
(glycogenolysis) and released into the bloodstream
to keep levels within the range 3.5–5.5 mmol/L.
The liver contains approximately 80 g of glycogen.
This is enough to keep blood glucose levels within
the normal range for approximately 24 hours at rest,
but for less time during heavy exercise.
The peptide hormones insulin and glucagon, both
produced by the pancreas, control the levels of plasma
glucose. Insulin promotes synthesis of glycogen,
protein and fat, while inhibiting gluconeogenesis
and lipolysis.

HINTS AND TIPS
In prolonged starvation, ketone bodies and fatty acids
are used as alternative sources of fuel, and body tissues
(except the brain) adapt to a lower glucose
requirement.

Lipid metabolism
Most of the fat (lipids) in the diet is in the form of triglycerides (esters of fatty acid and glycerol). The digestion
and absorption of dietary lipids is described in Chapter 5.
Lipids are insoluble in water, and they are assembled
into lipoproteins (complexes of lipid and protein) in
the liver, for transport in the blood (Fig. 6.11). Depending on their composition, lipoproteins are classified
into chylomicrons (the lowest density), very-lowdensity, intermediate-density, low-density and highdensity lipoproteins (Fig. 6.12).
Low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) have been implicated in atheroma and their level in the plasma should
be kept low. Conversely, high-density lipoproteins

Glucagon acts on the liver primarily and has no
effect on muscle. It up-regulates gluconeogenesis and
ketogenesis.
HINTS AND TIPS
The liver also contains the hydrolytic enzyme
glucose-6-phosphatase, which allows for release
of glucose from cells. This enzyme is absent in the
brain and muscle so that, in effect, the liver is the
only organ which can release glucose into the
bloodstream to maintain blood sugar levels.

In diabetes, the utilization of carbohydrates is
impaired and ketone bodies are formed in the liver
from b-oxidation of fatty acids. Ketones are released
from hepatocytes and carried to other tissues where they
are metabolized.

(HDLs) have a protective function and their levels
should be higher.
Cholesterol is needed for the manufacture of steroid
hormones and bile acids, and can be synthesized in the
liver. It is also a component of most diets, and it is found
in all animal products, especially eggs.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is easy to remember the ideal levels of circulating
lipoproteins. Low-density ones should be LOW and
high-density ones should be HIGH.

The cycle occurs partly in the mitochondria and
partly in the cytoplasm, so the enzymes are situated
in one or the other, according to their function in
the cycle.
In liver failure, there is decreased synthesis of urea
and increased levels of ammonia—a toxic product. Ammonia can depress cerebral blood flow and cerebral oxygen consumption. Ammonia toxicity is usually due to
cirrhosis, but it is also seen in inherited deficiencies of
urea cycle enzymes.
Transamination of amino acids is the interconversion of amine (–NH2) groups from amino acids to
a-ketoacids, to produce different amino acids. This is
catalysed by transaminase in the liver.

Protein metabolism
The liver synthesizes all the plasma proteins except
g-globulins. Amino acids from the intestines and
muscles enter the liver and by controlling their metabolism (especially via transamination and gluconeogenesis) the plasma protein concentrations can be
regulated.
The protein concentration of plasma is 60–80 g/L
and is made up of mainly albumin, globulin and fibrinogen. The plasma proteins synthesized by the liver are
summarized in Fig. 6.13.

Urea metabolism
Amino acids are transaminated and deaminated via oxidative pathways in the liver to form ammonia, which is
converted to urea via the urea (ornithine) cycle. This occurs mainly in the periportal cells (hepatocytes adjacent
to the portal canals).

108

Vitamin metabolism
The liver is the main store of the fat-soluble vitamins
(A, D, E and K). Vitamin deficiency may occur when
there is malabsorption of fat, due to a variety of hepatic
and extrahepatic causes.
Vitamin B12 is absorbed from the diet in the terminal ileum, provided intrinsic factor is made by
the parietal cells of the stomach, and enough is stored in the liver to last 2 or 3 years. Deficiency eventually leads to megaloblastic anaemia (pernicious
anaemia).
The liver stores folate and converts it to its active
form, tetrahydrofolate. Folate is needed as a coenzyme
for the transfer of 1-carbon groups and its deficiency
also leads to megaloblastic anaemia, but more quickly
than vitamin B12 deficiency because body stores of
folate are only sufficient for a few months. Folate

deficiency in early pregnancy may also lead to neuraltube defects in the fetus.
Dietary deficiency of folate is much more common
than vitamin B12 deficiency, and it is seen in alcoholics and others on a poor diet or suffering from a
severe illness where folate utilization is increased,
e.g. in cancer.
HINTS AND TIPS
In general, a deficiency of any substance may result
from:
• Increased utilization
• Increased excretion
• Decreased manufacture
• Decreased absorption.

Storage
The liver acts as a store for, among others, glycogen, fat
and fat-soluble vitamins, folate, iron and copper. This
storage function is important as it enables the body to
withstand periods of insufficient intake of the stored
nutrients.

Immune function upregulators and coordinators
Inflammatory functions

Some stores are large enough to sustain the body’s
needs for a few years, e.g. stores of vitamin B12 are sufficient for about 3 years; folate stores can last a few months.

Drug and hormone metabolism
The liver metabolizes drugs and hormones via biotransformation in three stages:
• Phase I (oxidation)
• Phase II (conjugation)
• Phase III (elimination).
These processes are useful, in conjunction with the filtering action of the portal blood supply (see later) in
allowing the body to detoxify or degrade toxins or waste
products.
Phase I reactions often produce more active metabolites, e.g. they can change prodrugs into the active drugs.
Phase II reactions make the substrate more water soluble
to facilitate phase III. Phase III occurs via ATPase pumps.

Phase I reactions
Oxidation is carried out mainly by the cytochrome P450
enzymes in the hepatocyte smooth endoplastic reticulum. Other enzymes such as xanthine oxidase and

monoamine oxidase, present in other tissues as well as
the liver, also assist with oxidation.
A number of drugs induce microsomal enzymes, affecting the metabolism of other drugs taken at the same
time, and this should be borne in mind when deciding
what dose to prescribe.
Notable examples of enzyme-inducing drugs include
phenobarbital, ethanol and phenylbutazone.

Phase II reactions
A number of chemical products are conjugated
with drugs or their metabolites in the liver, including
glucuronyl, acetyl, methyl, glycyl, sulphate and
glutamyl groups, of which glucuronyl is the most
common.
Conjugation is important in the metabolism of paracetamol. It is inactivated by conjugation to form a glucuronide or sulphate, but the liver has a limited
capacity.
If the normal conjugation pathway is saturated,
mixed-function oxidases form a toxic metabolite instead. The toxic metabolite is itself inactivated by conjugation with glutathione, but stores of glutathione are
limited.

circulation is reduced and the drug is said to undergo
significant first-pass metabolism. Drug metabolism in
the liver is summarized in Fig. 6.14.

Defence
The portal blood supply to the liver allows for toxins
and microorganisms to be filtered out before the blood
returns to the systemic circulation. This protects
the rest of the body from any harmful substances
that may have breached the gut defence mechanisms.
Kupffer cells in the sinusoids facilitate this via
phagocytosis.

Haematopoiesis
In embryonic life, the liver is the main site of haematopoiesis. This occurs from the 2nd to 7th months, but
ceases before birth.
By 5 months of gestation, the bone marrow is supplementing the liver in this function.
Between conception and the 2nd month, haematopoiesis takes place in the yolk sac. The liver and spleen
can resume their haematopoietic role (extramedullary
haematopoiesis) if necessary.

Phase III reactions
The elimination of conjugated substances is via the
blood, which then results in excretion through the kidneys, or via bile through the intestines.
ATPase pumps are required to actively transport
the substance out of the hepatocyte. Some pumps are
specific for the conjugating molecule, e.g. glutathione.
Some drugs are rapidly inactivated by the liver, e.g.
propranolol. The amount of active drug reaching the

Bile production and function
Bile is an aqueous, alkaline, greenish-yellow liquid produced by the liver to:
• Eliminate endogenous and exogenous substances
from the liver
• Emulsify fats in the small intestine and facilitate
their digestion and absorption.

Functions and physiology
Bile consists of bile acids, cholesterol, phospholipids,
bile pigments (bilirubin and biliverdin), electrolytes
(Naþ, Kþ, Ca2 þ, Cl–, HCO3  ) and water.
Waste products found in bile include cholesterol and
the bile pigments, bilirubin and biliverdin, which give
bile its colour.
Bile passes out of the liver through the bile ducts, and
it is concentrated and stored in the gall bladder. During
and after a meal, it is excreted from the gall bladder by
contraction and passes into the duodenum through the
common bile duct.
Most of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the terminal ileum and recycled by the liver (see later). Bile pigments are normally excreted in the faeces, which they
colour dark brown.

Bile acids
Bile acids (also called bile salts) are detergents which
emulsify lipids. They have a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic end, and they form micelles in aqueous solutions.
Bile acids are synthesized in hepatocytes from cholesterol and excreted into bile. They account for approximately 50% of the dry weight of bile.
The principal primary bile acids are cholic acid and
chenodeoxycholic acid. They are made more soluble
by conjugation with taurine or glycine.
Of the bile acids excreted into the intestine, 95% are
reabsorbed (mostly in the terminal ileum) and recycled
by the liver. This is termed enterohepatic recycling
(Fig. 6.15). The total pool of bile acids is recirculated
six to eight times a day. Reabsorption through enterohepatic recirculation means we only need a small pool of
bile acids. Normally about 250–500 mg of bile acids are
produced a day, which replaces the amount excreted in
the faeces.

6

The main functions of bile acids are:
• Triglyceride assimilation – bile acids emulsify lipids
with the aid of lecithin (found in high concentrations
in bile) and break them down to 1-mm-diameter
droplets. This provides a large surface area for digestive enzymes to act on
• Lipid transport – bile acids form mixed micelles with
the products of lipid digestion and facilitate transport to the brush border, where they are absorbed
• Bile flow induction – bile acids stimulate the flow of
bile by osmotically attracting water and electrolytes
as they are secreted. It is also thought that some bile
acids are secreted in an unconjugated form. They
are absorbed without water and electrolytes from
the bile ducts to be quickly carried back to the liver
for resecretion
• Regulation of bile acid synthesis – normal reabsorption
of bile acids from the intestines inhibits hepatic synthesis of bile acids. Not all bile acids are equally
effective: chenodeoxycholic acid and lithocholic
acid significantly reduce cholic acid formation. It is
thought that the feedback mechanism acts on the
rate-limiting step of bile acid synthesis
• Water and electrolyte secretion – if bile acids are
present in the colon, they stimulate water and
electrolyte secretion. This can result in diarrhoea.
A deficiency of bile acids results in malabsorption.

Bilirubin
This yellow pigment, which gives bile its colour, is the
principal constituent in bile. Knowledge of bilirubin
metabolism is essential to understanding the pathophysiology behind jaundice (see later).
Most bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of haemoglobin from worn-out red cells (Fig. 6.16), but about 15%

results from the breakdown of other haem-containing
proteins such as myoglobin, cytochromes and catalases.
Bilirubin is insoluble and is transported to the liver
in the plasma, bound to albumin. There, most of it dissociates from albumin, and is extracted from the blood
in the sinusoids by the hepatocytes. It binds to cytoplasmic proteins in the hepatocytes, and is conjugated with
glucuronic acid to form bilirubin diglucuronide (a reaction catalysed by glucuronyl transferase, found mainly
in smooth endoplasmic reticulum).
Bilirubin diglucuronide is water soluble, unlike bilirubin, and is actively transported against its concentration gradient into the bile canaliculi. A small amount

112

escapes into the blood, where it is transported bound
to albumin, and then excreted in the urine.
The intestinal mucosa is permeable to unconjugated
bilirubin and to urobilinogen (a colourless derivative
of bilirubin produced by intestinal flora); some of
the bile pigments and urobilinogens are reabsorbed
from the gut into the portal circulation. The intestinal
mucosa is relatively impermeable to conjugated
bilirubin.
Some of the reabsorbed substances are excreted
again by the liver, but small amounts of urobilinogens
enter the general circulation and are excreted in the
urine.

Control of bile production

Control of bile acid synthesis and secretion

There are two different mechanisms of control of bile
production (Fig. 6.17):

Cholecystokinin increases the rate of bile acid secretion
during the intestinal phase of digestion.
High concentrations of bile acids in the portal blood
stimulate bile acid secretion and inhibit its synthesis
during the intestinal phase.
Conversely, low levels of bile acids in the portal
blood during the interdigestive phase stimulate the synthesis and inhibit the secretion of bile acids.
Secretin stimulates secretion by the bile duct
epithelium and this effect is strongly potentiated by
cholecystokinin. Secretin alone has no effect on the
concentration of bile acids in bile.

• Bile acid-dependent
• Intrahepatic bile-duct-dependent.
The bile acid-dependent mechanism describes how water
and electrolytes passively follow the movement of bile
acids, which have been actively transported into the
bile canaliculi and ducts. Movement of water and electrolytes is achieved by tight junctions between hepatocytes.
The tight junctions can become more permeable in
response to bile acids, vasopressin, epinephrine and
angiotensin II. It is thought that bile acids are secreted
across the canalicular membrane into bile by proteinmediated facilitated transport, driven partly by the
electrochemical difference across the membrane.
The intrahepatic bile duct mechanism describes
the aqueous secretion that makes up 50% of the total
volume of bile.
The solution is secreted by epithelial cells lining the
bile ducts, and is isotonic, with sodium and potassium
concentrations similar to those of plasma. It has a
higher concentration of bicarbonate and a lower
concentration of chloride.

PATHOLOGICAL
MANIFESTATIONS OF LIVER
DAMAGE
The liver is essential to life and has a remarkable capacity to regenerate. Damage from whatever cause (apart
from trauma) results in similar pathology but following certain patterns which are dependent on the aetiology. Nevertheless, there is usually an inflammatory

113

The liver
reaction, some attempt at regeneration, and, if unsuccessful, cell death.
Because the processes underlying liver injury are similar, the resultant clinical picture will be one of the following types, which represent stages in the progression
of liver damage:
•
•
•
•

Acute hepatitis
Chronic hepatitis
Liver fibrosis
Cirrhosis, which is the end-point of chronic liver
damage
• Complications of the necro-inflammatory or cirrhotic
process.

Histopathological patterns
of liver injury
These are the different ways in which injury to the liver
manifests itself at the tissue level, and should not be
confused with the clinical pictures mentioned above.

Necrosis
Hepatic necrosis can be described in a number of ways
(Fig. 6.18):
• Apoptotic necrosis describes necrosis of individual
hepatocytes. It is caused by several diseases, including acute viral hepatitis. Complete recovery with no
long-term sequelae is the norm. The dead hepatocytes form eosinophilic Councilman bodies
Fig. 6.18 Patterns of hepatic
necrosis. (Redrawn from Underwood
JCE. General and Systematic
Pathology, 2nd edn. Edinburgh:
Churchill Livingstone, 1996.)

• Focal or spotty necrosis describes small groups
of necrotic hepatocytes. Macrophages and lymphocytes tend to accumulate around them in an
effort to localize damage or infection. This type
of necrosis is seen in acute viral or drug-induced
hepatitis
• Zonal necrosis describes destruction of hepatocytes
within a particular zone of the liver acinus
• Haemodynamic necrosis is a type of zonal necrosis
because concentric bands of necrotic hepatocytes
are seen around the central vein. This occurs in
cardiac failure, stasis of hepatic venous blood and
poisoning. Zone 3 (the centrilobular zone) is most
affected by necrosis, e.g. due to paracetamol
overdose, and necrosis of zone 2 is rare, but seen
in yellow fever
• Confluent bridging necrosis involves a large number of
hepatocytes in a ‘band’ of necrosis stretching between hepatic venules (central to central) or between
hepatic venules and portal tracts (central to portal).
This pattern of necrosis is caused by severe drug- or
viral-induced hepatitis
• Piecemeal necrosis occurs in chronic liver disease.
It describes the necrosis of hepatocytes at the interface between the parenchyma and fibrous tissue.
Lymphocytes, particularly plasma cells, infiltrate
the area
• Submassive or panacinar necrosis affects the entire
acinus. Massive necrosis affects the entire liver.
Both are caused by viral- or drug-induced injury.
Massive necrosis can result in fulminant hepatic
failure.

Systemic and organic manifestations of liver damage

Inflammation
In inflammation of the liver (hepatitis), an influx of
acute or chronic inflammatory cells may occur secondary to hepatocellular necrosis.

Hepatitis B (±D) and C

Regeneration
Regeneration is normal following injury. Hyperplasia and
hypertrophy are common after injury. Hepatocyte proliferation results in a thickening of the cords radiating out
from the central vein. The architecture may be disturbed
unless the connective tissue framework remains intact.
The normal liver can restore its original weight, even
if up to two thirds of the liver is removed. This allows for
recovery from numerous injuries and even extensive
surgical removal of tumours.

Iron overload (haemochromatosis)
Gall stones
Autoimmune liver disease
Wilson’s disease (leading to deposition of copper in the liver)
α1-antitrypsin deficiency
Type IV glycogenosis
Galactosaemia
Tyrosinaemia
Biliary cholestasis
Budd−Chiari syndrome

Fibrosis
Fibrosis from inflammation or a direct toxic insult may
occur around the portal tracts, the central vein or within
the spaces of Disse, disrupting the normal architecture
and interfering with liver function. In severe cases,
cirrhosis results.

Cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is a diffuse and irreversible condition that results from necrosis of hepatocytes followed by the formation of regeneration nodules separated by fibrosis.
Cirrhosis has three key characteristics:
• Chronic hepatocyte necrosis
• A chronic inflammatory process which encourages
fibrosis
• Nodules caused by hepatocyte regeneration.
The process causes architectural disturbances and interferes with normal liver blood flow and function.
The causes of cirrhosis are summarized in Fig. 6.19,
and the complications in Fig. 6.20. Many of the complications are similar to those of liver failure, as cirrhosis is
a major cause of hepatic failure.

Treatment of cirrhosis
After performing a number of investigations, including
liver function tests, liver biopsy, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) imaging, the severity and type
of cirrhosis can be determined.
Treatment depends on the diagnosis and any complications that accompany the cirrhosis. Certain drugs are
contraindicated in liver disease, and these should be
avoided. Broadly, treatment for cirrhosis may be divided into two categories:
• Treatment of the underlying cause, i.e. to stop
the pathological process. Depending on the cause,
this may include alcohol abstention, antiviral therapy, immunosuppression or withdrawal of drugs

Drugs (e.g. methotrexate)
Biliary cirrhosis
Hepatic venous congestion
Cystic fibrosis
Glycogen storage disease

• Management of complications, for example ascitic
taps and treatment of hepatic encepalopathy (see
later).
Patients require 6-monthly checks, involving ultrasound and serum a-fetoprotein measurements. These
will enable early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma
development.

SYSTEMIC AND ORGANIC
MANIFESTATIONS OF LIVER
DAMAGE

Portal hypertension
The normal pressure in the hepatic portal vein is about
7 mmHg, but this increases two- to threefold in portal
hypertension.
Liver disease is the most common cause, but it is not
the only one as many diseases and disorders can result
in this condition. Broadly, the causes of portal hypertension may be classified as:
• Prehepatic – a blockage of the portal vein before the
liver
• Hepatic – a disruption or change of the liver
architecture
• Posthepatic – a blockage in the venous system after
the liver.
The causes of these are shown in Fig 6.21.

(very rare with modern cardiac treatment).

Cirrhosis results in disruption of the normal liver architecture, which increases hepatic vascular resistance
and causes intrahepatic arteriovenous shunting. It is
the most common cause of portal hypertension in the

116

UK. Worldwide, however, cirrhosis due to viral hepatitis
is the main cause of portal hypertension.
Many patients with portal hypertension are asymptomatic, and they are picked up incidentally with low
platelet or white cell count related to splenomegaly.
Clinical features related to complications include
haematemesis or melaena (from ruptured gastrooesophageal varices), ascites and encephalopathy.
The complications of portal hypertension are described
below.

Ascites
Ascites is the abnormal collection of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, and is a common complication of portal
hypertension secondary to cirrhosis. It may form as a
result of:
• Naþ and water retention, due to peripheral arterial
vasodilatation particularly of the splanchnic circulation. This reduces effective blood volume and
activates the renin–angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system (both up-regulate water and
salt retention)
• A local hydrostatic pressure increase due to the portal hypertension, resulting in an increased production of lymph in the hepatic and splanchnic

Systemic and organic manifestations of liver damage
regions. Transudation of the fluid into the peritoneal
cavity causes ascites
• Low serum albumin levels (hypoalbuminaemia),
due to decreased liver synthesis, causing a low
plasma oncotic pressure
• Secondary hyperaldosteronism with reduced catabolism of this salt-retaining hormone.

Clinical Note
The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone is thus
often used to treat ascites.

Clinically, ascites may be detected by abdominal
swelling, some abdominal pain, a shifting dullness,
and a fluid thrill. Many patients also have peripheral
oedema, due to hypoalbuminaemia.
It should be managed by reducing sodium intake and
increasing renal sodium excretion with diuretics such as
spironolactone.
Fluid may be removed by paracentesis (drainage via a
needle through the abdominal wall). However, there is
a risk that fluid will accumulate again in the peritoneal
cavity at the expense of the systemic circulation. This
leads to shock, so intravenous albumin should also
be given.
A peritoneovenous shunt (a catheter from the peritoneal cavity into the internal jugular vein) may be used to
return the fluid to the systemic circulation. This is used
in rare cases when diuretic therapy fails.
If the portal pressure rises above 12 mmHg, then dilatation of the venous system causes collateral vessels to
form. These are connections between the portal and systemic venous systems, and are found mainly at the
gastro-oesophageal junction, rectum, diaphragm, left
renal vein, the retroperitoneum and the umbilical region of the anterior abdominal wall and are described
further in the next section.
Oesophageal varices can rupture, causing haematemesis and sometimes fatal consequences (oesophageal
varices are described in Chapter 2). Enlargement of
veins at other sites of portosystemic anastomoses may
also occur, forming caput medusae around the umbilicus and rectal varices (see later).

Dilatation of portosystemic anastomoses
These occur at four sites in the body (Fig. 6.22):
• The lower end of the oesophagus, between the
left gastric vein (portal) and the azygos vein (systemic): when dilated, they are called oesophageal
varices

6

• The lower part of the rectum, between the superior
(portal), middle and inferior (systemic) rectal veins:
when dilated, they are called rectal varices
• The umbilical region of the anterior abdominal wall,
between the paraumbilical veins in the falciform ligament of the liver (portal) and the epigastric veins
(systemic): when dilated, they are called caput
medusae
• The bare areas of the gastrointestinal tract and its related
organs, e.g. veins between the bare area of the liver
and the diaphragm
• Additionally, some patients with liver disease who
have had intestinal surgery – e.g. colectomy for ulcerative colitis associated with sclerosing cholangitis –
can have varices form at the site of the surgical
anastomosis or the stoma site and these can
subsequently bleed.
HINTS AND TIPS
The locations of the porto-systemic anastomoses is a
popular anatomy exam question – make sure you know
them. Interestingly, caput medusae at the umbilicus is
so-called because it looks like the serpents on the head
of Medusa!

These anastomoses may enlarge if the portal vein is
obstructed by a thrombus or the venous flow through
the liver is impeded by cirrhosis.
Oesophageal varices are clinically the most important cause of bleeding in portal hypertension.

Splenomegaly
Splenomegaly is the term used to describe an enlarged
spleen. It can be massive (extending into the right iliac
fossa), and has a large number of causes.
Normally the spleen weighs about 200 g; it is oval in
shape and found between the 9th and 11th ribs. It plays
an important role in immune defence and the removal
of expired or abnormal blood cells.
Portal hypertension may cause moderate congestive
splenomegaly, as may thrombosis of the extrahepatic
portion of the portal vein or of the splenic vein.
A raised pressure in the inferior vena cava may be
transmitted to the spleen through the portal vein, and
is a cause of posthepatic splenomegaly; other causes include decompensated right-sided heart failure and pulmonary or tricuspid valve disease.
Splenomegaly may cause abdominal discomfort,
and an enlarged spleen may occasionally rupture following minor trauma. Additionally, it can cause excess
removal of blood cells leading to pancytopenia. This is
called hypersplenism.

Clinical Note
Do not forget that other non-hepatic causes of
splenomegaly include infections and inflammatory and
haematological diseases, such as TB, infectious
mononucleosis, septic shock, malaria, rheumatoid
arthritis and haemolytic anaemia.

Jaundice and cholestasis
Clinical jaundice (icterus) is caused by plasma levels
of bilirubin exceeding 50 mmol/L, and it presents as
a yellow pigmentation of skin, sclera and mucosa.
The colour of the sclera is the best indicator, but it
must be examined in good white light. Biochemical
jaundice has a much lower threshold, and is simply
a plasma bilirubin level above the normal range of
18–24 mmol/L.

118

Jaundice may be classified by its cause in relation to
the hepatocyte as:
• Prehepatic
• Hepatic
• Posthepatic.

Prehepatic jaundice
This describes conditions giving rise to jaundice where
the mechanism occurs before the bilirubin gets to the
hepatocyte, but its clinical usefulness is extended
by considering it as all steps up to conjugation of
bilirubin.
Bilirubin is formed from the breakdown of haemoglobin and, normally, is conjugated with glucuronic
acid by hepatocytes when it reaches the liver. This makes
it more soluble. Unconjugated bilirubin remains in the
circulation only when the liver is unable to conjugate all
the bilirubin that is delivered to it.
However, increased haemolysis, e.g. in haemolytic
anaemias such as sickle-cell disease or haemolytic disease of the newborn, may cause an excess of bilirubin,

Systemic and organic manifestations of liver damage
and this can overcome the liver’s capacity to conjugate
it. Congenital hyperbilirubinaemias are another
cause.
Therefore, haemolytic jaundice results in raised
levels of unconjugated bilirubin. This is particularly
dangerous in neonates, as the unconjugated bilirubin
can cross the blood–brain barrier and cause brain damage (kernicterus).
Because unconjugated bilirubin is not soluble, it
does not pass into the urine, so this type of jaundice
is often called ‘acholuric jaundice’. The urinary urobilinogen is elevated due to increased resorption from the
gut, as the total bilirubin load is raised.
The congenital hyperbilirubinaemias are rare, and
you do not need to know them in detail at this stage,
with the possible exception of Gilbert’s syndrome which
is relatively more common.

Gilbert’s syndrome
This congenital disorder is caused by patients having a
reduced amount of the enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UGT-1), which conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic acid.
This affects between 2% and 7% of the population,
and is not a serious disease. The reticulocyte (immature
red blood cell) count is normal, and there is only a slight
increase in serum bilirubin (unconjugated), often after
prolonged starvation or intercurrent illness.
The syndrome is asymptomatic, although some
patients complain of fatigue. Treatment is not usually
required but carbohydrate loading can help.

Crigler–Najjar syndrome
This is an extremely rare disease due to more severe
abnomalities in the translated gene sequence of UGT-1,
resulting in total absence of enzyme (type I) or an abnormal but functional enzyme (type II); both types are
autosomal recessive and have high serum levels of
unconjugated bilirubin.
Type II patients have a decreased level of UDPglucuronyl transferase and, therefore, they can survive
into adulthood. This form is thought to be very similar
to Gilbert’s syndrome.
Type I patients lack the enzyme altogether, and do
not survive, without a liver transplantation.

Hepatic jaundice
This type of jaundice describes mechanisms which
occur within the hepatocyte, or more specifically, after
the bilirubin conjugation stage. It therefore includes
some rare congenital hyperbilirubinaemias and hepatocyte transport ‘exporter protein’ defects, as well as
diseases resulting in hepatocellular damage and cholestasis (loss of bile flow).

6

Hepatocellular jaundice
Damage to the hepatocytes and the intrahepatic biliary
tree leads to an increase in both unconjugated and conjugated serum levels of bilirubin. There is an increase
in clotting time, serum alanine aminotransferase and
serum aspartate aminotransferase because of the hepatocellular damage.
Clinically, features of a conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia predominate, as excretion, not conjugation is the
rate-limiting step in the metabolism of bilirubin, hence
this hepatocellular jaundice can be categorized as a
form of cholestatic jaundice.
Viruses such as the hepatitis A, B, C and E, and
Epstein–Barr viruses, can lead to hepatocellular jaundice, as can leptospirosis (Weil’s disease), a bacterial
infection spread by infected rat urine.
Autoimmune or drug-induced damage, as well as cirrhosis and tumours, can cause hepatocellular jaundice.
Wilson’s disease, an autosomal recessive disorder of
copper metabolism, leads to hepatitis and cirrhosis and
can manifest as jaundice.

Dubin–Johnson syndrome
This is an autosomal recessive disorder in which the
liver fails to excrete conjugated bilirubin (caused by a
mutation in the canalicular multispecific organic anion
transporter, CMOAT), resulting in jaundice.

Rotor syndrome
This is very similar to Dubin–Johnson syndrome, with a
defect in intracellular binding proteins for bilirubin.
There is no pigment deposit.

Posthepatic jaundice
Normally, conjugated bilirubin passes from the liver
to the gallbladder where it is stored and then released
into the duodenum following a fatty meal.
In the terminal ileum, intestinal flora convert it
first to urobilinogen (some of which is reabsorbed
and excreted in the urine) and then to stercobilinogen,
which is excreted in the faeces (giving them their brown
colour).
In posthepatic jaundice, the passage of conjugated
bilirubin through the biliary tree is blocked, and it leaks
into the circulation instead. It is soluble and excreted in
the urine, making it dark. However, the faeces are deprived of their stercobilinogen and are pale. These are
key symptoms in the history.
There is no problem with the synthesis of any of the
bile products in posthepatic obstructive jaundice,
only its release into the duodenum. Obstruction also
results in cholestasis. Therefore, bile salts, along with
conjugated bilirubin, escape into the circulation,
and this causes itching (pruritus), another important
symptom.

119

The liver
HINTS AND TIPS
The types of jaundice can be correlated as
follows: prehepatic jaundice is where bilirubin is
unconjugated, posthepatic jaundice is where bilirubin
is conjugated and hepatic jaundice gives a mixed
picture.

Causes of posthepatic cholestatic jaundice include
gallstones, biliary stricture, congenital biliary atresia
(complete blockage from birth), carcinoma of the pancreas or bile ducts and pancreatitis.

HINTS AND TIPS

The symptoms and causes of jaundice are summarized in Fig. 6.23.

Further investigations for jaundice
Investigations other than liver function tests, a full
blood count, serum bilirubin levels, virology screening
and urinanalysis that can be performed are:
•
•
•
•

Ultrasound
Liver biopsy
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
Endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography
(ERCP)
• Magnetic resonance cholangio-pancreatography
(MRCP).

One clinical question can be used to separate
prehepatic jaundice from the other causes, i.e. whether
the patient has pale stools and dark urine. This is a
symptom of cholestatic rather than prehepatic
jaundice – note that it does not imply obstruction,
as obstruction is only one cause of cholestasis.
One simple test can be used to identify posthepatic
jaundice, i.e. an ultrasound scan.

Clinical Note
Lack of bile salts and, therefore, a lack of fat absorption,
causes the slow clotting time associated with jaundice.
Vitamin K (a clotting factor) is a fat-soluble vitamin
which requires fat for absorption from the gut. In
jaundice: decreased fat absorption = low vitamin K
concentrations = slow clotting.

Systemic and organic manifestations of liver damage

Hepatic failure
Despite its large capacity to regenerate after injury, the liver
can sometimes fail due to severe acute liver injury, e.g. in
viral hepatitis or drug toxicity, or chronic liver disease, e.g.
cirrhosis. Liver failure can therefore be acute or chronic.
The liver has a large number of vital functions, and its
failure to perform these can lead to systemic consequences, from neurological problems to decreased
coagulation or renal failure.

Acute (fulminant) liver failure
Fulminant means developing suddenly (from the Latin
for ‘lightning’) and fulminant liver failure is the development of hepatic encephalopathy within 2–3 weeks of the
first symptoms of hepatic insufficiency. Paracetamol overdose and viral infections are the most common causes.
Clinical features are subtle initially, and are those of
hepatic encephalopathy (see below). There is usually
jaundice, unless the cause is Reye’s syndrome (see later),
and the liver is enlarged only in the initial stages, being
impalpable after that.
The prognosis depends principally on the cause of
liver failure and the health and age of the patient, as
in many other diseases.
Clinical Note
In paracetamol overdose, the saturation of liver enzymes
and depletion of glutathione lead to liver necrosis and
damage to kidney tubules by toxic metabolites.
Treatment is with N-acetylcysteine, which increases the
formation of glutathione, or with methionine.
Paracetamol has a narrow therapeutic index, i.e. the
difference between a beneficial and a toxic dose is
small, hence paracetamol overdose is common.
Symptoms of liver damage may not be apparent
immediately, but when they do occur it is often too
late, with fatal consequences.

Hepatic encephalopathy
This is a neurological disorder caused by metabolic failure
of the hepatocytes and the shunting of blood around the
liver (due to cirrhosis or after portocaval anastomosis).
It may occur in both chronic and acute liver failure,
and results in the exposure of the brain to abnormal
metabolites, causing oedema and astrocyte changes.
Normally the liver eliminates the toxic nitrogenous
products of gut bacteria. In liver failure, their elimination is reduced and some of them act as false transmitters (mimicking the normal neurotransmitters of the
central nervous system). This results in central nervous
system disturbances.

Other factors may play a part in the pathology,
including ammonia and electrolyte disturbances,
hypotension, changes in vascular permeability and
increased cerebral sensitivity due to the metabolic
disturbances.
Symptoms include:
• Disturbances in consciousness (ranging from confusion to coma and death)
• Asterixis (a flapping tremor of outstretched
hands)
• Fluctuating neurological signs (muscular rigidity
and hyperreflexia).
There is no specific treatment, except to restrict protein intake (to reduce uraemia and endogenous protein
breakdown), treat any infection, empty the bowels
of nitrogen-containing material and correct the metabolic and coagulation disturbances. Flumazenil, a
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, can improve the
encephalopathy in the short term.

Chronic liver failure
This refers to the situation in which the functional capacity of the liver is unable to maintain normal physiological conditions. ‘Decompensated liver disease’ is a
synonymous term.
Clinical features are similar to those of cirrhosis
(Fig. 6.20). However, it must be noted that cirrhosis and
chronic liver failure are not the same; cirrhosis may
cause chronic liver failure but not vice-versa. Infection
and hepatic vascular disease may precipitate chronic liver
failure, with cirrhosis being a possible step in the
pathogenesis.
Management involves treating the underlying cause,
treating the symptoms and maintaining normal nutritional status. Liver transplantation (see later) may be
an option.
The prognosis is poor, with a 25% 5-year survival rate.

Clinical Note
Cirrhosis and chronic liver failure are very closely
related because any condition which may lead
to death of hepatocytes and thus predispose to
chronic liver failure may also cause cirrhosis.
Examples include viral hepatitis, vascular diseases
such as the Budd–Chiari syndrome and metabolic
diseases affecting the liver. The association with
cirrhosis is also why the liver becomes impalpable
over the course of the disease, as progressive
hepatocyte death and fibrosis cause the liver
to shrink.

121

The liver

Hepatorenal syndrome
This is the combination of renal failure in a previously
normal kidney and severe liver disease. However, kidney function improves dramatically if the liver failure
is reversed.
Renal failure is caused by a drop in renal blood flow
and glomerular filtration rate, causing a fall in urine output and increased retention of sodium by the kidney.
These mechanisms are brought about by upregulation
of the renin–angiotensin–aldosterone system, norepinephrine and vasopressin. It may be fatal.
Treatment includes the use of dopamine to increase
renal blood flow, and protein restriction.

Liver transplantation
Liver transplantation is increasingly used in the treatment of:
• Acute and chronic liver disease
• Alcoholic liver disease (provided the patient has
given up drinking and is well motivated)
• Primary biliary cirrhosis, when serum bilirubin rises
above 100 mmol/L
• Chronic hepatitis B and C when complications
ensue
• Primary metabolic disease with end-stage liver disease, e.g. Wilson’s disease and a1-antitrypsin
deficiency
• Other conditions, including sclerosing cholangitis
or rarely hepatocellular carcinoma.
Clinical Note
For patients with acute liver failure, the King’s College
Hospital criteria for liver transplantation are:

Absolute contraindications are active sepsis outside
the hepatobiliary tree and metastatic malignancy. If
the patient lacks psychological commitment, as might
occur in alcoholic liver disease, then transplantation
is not an option. Complications increase and recovery
is impeded with advancing years over 70.
Most organs are taken from beating heart cadavers,
but a relative may donate a single lobe to an infant.
The liver is less aggressively rejected than other organs but early (reversible), or late (irreversible) rejection
may occur. Acute (cellular), or early rejection occurs
within 5–10 days after the transplant. The patient
develops pyrexia, general malaise, and abdominal
tenderness due to hepatomegaly. This is caused by an
inflammatory reaction.
Immunosuppressive therapy is given posttransplant and normally consists of a calcineurin
inhibitor, steroids and azathioprine. If further immunosuppression is needed mycophenolate or sirolimus
are often used.
Chronic (ductopenic) rejection occurs 6 weeks to
9 months after the transplant. This type of rejection cannot be reversed with immunosuppressive drugs and
retransplantation is the only treatment. Graft-versushost disease is very rare.

DISORDERS OF THE LIVER
As the liver, gallbladder and biliary tract are anatomically and functionally connected, diseases and disorders
which affect one part of the hepatobiliary system may
therefore have an impact on the other components.
It is important to bear this in mind when thinking about
the pathological processes that can occur in these
organs.

Paracetamol liver failure
• Arterial pH < 7.3 24 hours after ingestion
Or all of the following:
• INR > 6.5
• Creatinine > 300
• Grade III or IV encephalopathy.
Non-paracetamol liver failure
• INR > 6.5
Or 3 out of 5 of the following:
• Drug-induced liver failure
• Age < 11 or > 40 years old
• 1 week between onset of jaundice and
encephalopathy
• INR > 3.5
• Bilirubin > 300.

122

Congenital abnormalities
Polycystic liver disease
In polycystic liver disease, the liver has numerous cysts,
lined with flattened or cuboidal biliary epithelium and
containing straw-coloured fluid. This is an autosomal
dominant condition.
The number of cysts varies from just a few to several
hundred, and the cysts themselves vary in diameter
from 0.5 cm to 4.0 cm. They may cause discomfort or
pain if the patient stoops, and rupture of a cyst may
cause acute pain.
Asymptomatic cysts do not need treament; painful
ones may require aspiration.
Polycystic liver disease may be associated with polycystic kidney disease, which may lead to renal failure, in
which case the prognosis is worse.

Disorders of the liver

Congenital hepatic fibrosis
This is an autosomal recessive disorder. The liver is
divided into irregular islands by bands of collagenous
tissue that enlarge the portal tracts and form septa.
Abnormally shaped bile ducts are scattered throughout
the fibrous tissue and the septal margins contain bile
duct remnants.
It may present with complications of portal hypertension and, perhaps most importantly, with bleeding
varices (a medical emergency).
Associated conditions include polycystic kidneys
and medullary sponge kidneys. Diagnosis is by wedge
biopsy which allows differentiation between fibrosis
and cirrhosis.

Disorders of metabolism
Haemochromatosis and hyperlipidaemias are relatively
the most common of these diseases; the others are rare.

Haemochromatosis
Primary haemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive
disorder characterized by the absorption of too much
iron, which then accumulates (as haemosiderin) in
the liver, pancreas, heart, pituitary and joints.
A gene defect near the HLA region on chromosome 6,
called the HFE gene, results in a loss of regulation of iron
absorption from the small intestine even when the ironbinding protein, transferrin, is fully saturated. Iron
stores may be many times greater than normal levels,
rising from about 1 g to as much as 20 g.
Heterozygotes have only modest increases in absorption but generally they have normal iron stores. It can
take decades for sufficient iron to accumulate to cause
organ damage so that most cases present after the
age of 40.
Symptoms are rare in women of child-bearing age as
menstrual losses and pregnancy compensate for the excess iron absorption. The presenting complaint in men
is often loss of libido and hypogonadism, secondary to
dysfunction of the pituitary gland, but the commonest
presentation now is an incidental finding of abnormal
liver enzymes or raised ferritin level.
The clinical features include:
•
•
•
•

Liver enlargement
Fibrosis and cirrhosis
Bronze discolouration of the skin
Diabetes mellitus in two-thirds of cases (hence the
alternative name, bronze diabetes)
• Cardiac arrythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart
failure
• Arthritis in hands and knees.
Untreated, the condition may lead to liver failure and
primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Early in the disease,

6

iron is deposited in periportal hepatocytes (as haemosiderin) and then in Kupffer cells, bile duct epithelium
and portal tract connective tissue. There is hepatocyte
necrosis possibly due to free-radical generation, and
cirrhosis occurs as the disease progresses.
Diagnosis is by blood tests (which characteristically
show raised ferritin with transferrin saturation of
100%) and liver biopsy showing heavy deposits of iron
(as haemosiderin) in hepatocytes.
Treatment is by phlebotomy (venesection) once or
twice a week for a year or more until iron levels return
to normal, and then three or four times a year.
Chelation therapy (a drug that complexes with a
metal ion for its removal) can be used in patients
who cannot have venesection due to cardiac disease
or anaemia. Desferrioxamine can be given continuously
subcutaneously, or as and when required.
Secondary haemochromatosis (haemosiderosis)
may result from iron overload, e.g. in thalassaemia
patients after repeated blood transfusions or from excess iron absorption, e.g. in congenital haemolytic
anaemias.

Hyperlipidaemias
Hyperlipidaemias are a group of metabolic disorders
characterized by high levels of lipids (chiefly cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoproteins) in the blood. Several types of hyperlipidaemia have been described,
depending on levels of which lipid are raised. Disorders
resulting in hyperlipidaemia can stem from:
• Abnormal expression of genes encoding apoproteins
• Lipoprotein lipase deficiency
• Low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor defects.
Hyperlipidaemia is closely associated with atheroma
and cardiovascular disease, particularly in the Western
world, where diets contain too much fat.
Treatment includes the use of bile acid binding resins
such as cholestyramine and colestipol. These prevent
the reuptake of bile acids from the terminal ileum
and result in a greater de novo synthesis by the liver,
using up cholesterol and lowering its circulating levels.
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or ‘statins’, e.g. simvastatin, inhibit the rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis and can reduce LDL cholesterol by up to 40%.
Other treatments include fibrates, nicotinic acid and
omega-3 marine triglycerides, which limit hepatic triglyceride synthesis, reduce free fatty acid concentrations, and reduce hepatic very low density lipoprotein
(VLDL) secretion respectively.

Wilson’s disease
Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) is a
rare, autosomal recessive disorder in which copper

123

The liver
accumulates in the liver and the basal ganglia of the
brain. The cause is a mutation in a copper transport
ATPase gene located on chromosome 13.
Normally copper is secreted into bile, but in Wilson’s
disease biliary copper excretion is low. In the liver, a
chronic hepatitis results, leading to cirrhosis.
Signs and symptoms may appear in patients at any age
from about 5 years to 15 years (very occasionally older),
and they include hepatic and neurological abnormalities.
Faint, brown (Kayser–Fleischer) rings may appear in the
eye at the junction of the cornea and sclera in Descemet’s
membrane. They are diagnostic but usually require slitlamp examination. Psychiatric symptoms may be seen
as a result of copper deposition in the brain.
Diagnosis is by measurement of the copper-binding
protein caeruloplasmin in the blood. This is low in
Wilson’s disease because the non-functioning copper
transport protein does not allow copper to stimulate
its production. Special staining of liver biopsy tissue will
show an excess of copper. Twenty-four-hour urinary
copper concentrations are normally raised in Wilson’s
disease.
Treatment is with penicillamine, a chelating agent
that binds to copper and enables it to be excreted.
Prognosis depends on the stage at which treatment
is begun. If started early, before significant amounts
of copper have been deposited, prognosis is good. Neurological damage may be irreversible, and in hepatic
failure or cirrhosis, the only treatment is transplantation. Thus although rare, a high index of suspicion
is necessary for Wilson’s disease due to the serious
consequences.

a1-Antitrypsin deficiency
a1-Antitrypsin is a serum protein that is produced in the
liver and has anti-protease effects. It is part of the serine
protease inhibitors (SERPIN) superfamily of enzymes.
One in ten northern Europeans carry a deficiency gene,
which is autosomal recessive in inheritance.
The protease inhibitor (Pi) gene controlling its production is located on chromosome 14 and a number
of variants exist. The normal variant is M allele, and
the most important abnormal one is the Z allele.
Symptoms include emphysema in about 75% of
PiZZ homozygotes and liver cirrhosis in approximately
10%. Heterozygotes (e.g. PiSZ) have an increased risk of
developing emphysema if they smoke.
In the livers of homozygotes, a1-antitrypsin accumulates by polymerization in hepatocytes, shown by PAS
(periodic acid–Schiff)-positive intracellular globules
on liver biopsy. There is a chronic inflammatory picture
leading to cirrhosis, but the exact mechanisms causing
the cirrhosis are unknown.
Diagnosis is by measurement of serum a1-antitrypsin
and by liver biopsy.

124

Treatment is symptomatic, and patients should be
advised to stop smoking.

Reye’s syndrome
Reye’s syndrome is a rare disorder affecting children up
to 15 years of age. It is characterized by acute encephalopathy and infiltration of fatty microvesicles in the liver
(steatosis), and typically occurs during recovery from upper respiratory tract infections, influenza or chickenpox.
The encephalopathy and hepatic microvesicular steatosis are caused by inhibition of b-oxidation and the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria.
There is rapid progression to hepatic failure with
neurological deterioration and eventual coma.
Treatment is supportive, with corticosteroids and
mannitol (to reduce brain swelling) and dialysis or
transfusion to correct chemical imbalances resulting
from liver damage. Prognosis is poor, with an overall
mortality of about 50%, mainly due to cerebral oedema.

Glycogen storage diseases
There are many different types of glycogen storage diseases, each caused by a different enzyme defect. All
of these diseases are autosomal recessive, except type
IX B, which is X-linked.
Hepatocytes are involved in types I, II, III, IV, VI and
VIII, with a different site for glycogen storage in each.
Most patients present in childhood with hepatomegaly.
Patients with type I may develop hepatocellular
adenoma. Type IV predisposes to cirrhosis and usually
results in death by the age of 5 years. The heart and skeletal muscle can be involved, resulting in myopathies
and possible cardiac failure.
Liver transplantation is a very successful treatment
for glycogen storage diseases.

Lysosomal storage diseases
There are a number of lysosomal storage diseases, all of
which have a specific enzyme defect. This results in
the abnormal accumulation of the enzyme substrate
in lysosomes.
Gaucher’s disease (a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase) is the most common type of lysosomal storage
disease. This leads to the abnormal storage of glucocerebroside (glycosylceramide) in reticuloendothelial cells
(macrophages and monocytes) found in the liver,
spleen and bone marrow.
Its incidence is high in Ashkenazi Jews, and it
usually presents in childhood with splenomegaly, hepatomegaly, anaemia and elevated levels of serum
aminotransferases.
Treatment includes splenectomy, bone marrow
transplantation and replacement enzyme therapy (with
alglucerase).

Infectious and inflammatory
disease
Viral hepatitis
Viral hepatitis is a common cause of liver injury
(Fig. 6.24). The most common causes by far are the hepatitis viruses (A, B, C and E ). Rarer causes are cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis D
and arboviruses, e.g. in yellow fever.
Acute viral hepatitis may be asymptomatic or symptomatic, with or without jaundice and itching. Symptoms
are similar, regardless of the infecting virus and present as
a non-specific influenza-like illness, or with symptoms of
gastroenteritis. Liver function tests are abnormal, with
raised serum transaminases indicative of hepatocyte damage. Occasionally, fulminant hepatic failure may occur.

Hepatitis A
This disease is caused by an RNA picornavirus which is
found worldwide, especially where thereis poor sanitation and hygiene. It is spread by the faecal–oral route

through contaminated food and water, e.g. eating contaminated shellfish or swimming in sewage-polluted
water. It may cause outbreaks, and is very resistant to
heat and disinfectants.
The incubation period is 2–4 weeks, and infection
may be asymptomatic (as in most childhood infections) or cause fever, malaise or a gastroenteritis-like
illness followed by jaundice for 1–3 weeks. Diagnosis
is by virus-specific IgM. Neither carrier states nor
chronic infections occur (Fig. 6.25), but virus is present in the stools of patients about 2 weeks before
and up to about a week after jaundice is apparent.
Treatment is supportive, and prophylactic vaccines
are available.

Hepatitis B
Infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) may lead to a
chronic carrier state, liver cancer or cirrhosis. HBV is a
DNA virus.
Transmission is through contaminated blood or
blood products, body fluids, sexual contact and vertical

transmission from mother to baby during parturition. It
is also secreted in breast milk.
HBV is found worldwide, and is especially endemic in
Southeast Asia, China and tropical Africa. Areas of low
endemicity include Northern Europe, North America
and Australia. Infection in these areas is associated with
high-risk activities such as intravenous drug use, unprotected male homosexual contact, tattoo and acupuncture
practices and the use of blood products by haemophiliacs. In the UK hepatitis B is a notifiable disease.
Incubation is 2–6 months and over 50% of cases
are asymptomatic. Hepatitis B infection may lead to
arthritis or arthralgia with a rash (caused by immune
complexes).
Of infected adults, 90–95% recover completely and
become immune, the remaining 5–10% become carriers
(either asymptomatic carriers, or suffering from chronic
hepatitis which may lead to cirrhosis). Treatment options
in this patient group include alpha interferon injections
or a number of nucleoside or nucleotide analogues such
as entecavir or tenofovir.
About 1% develop fulminant acute hepatitis (a cause
of acute liver failure – see above), which has a very high
mortality rate. Infants infected perinatally have a worse
prognosis: 70–90% become carriers. This may be due to
their relatively underdeveloped immune systems.
Complications of chronic carriage include chronic
active hepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
The intact HBV, also called the Dane particle, has
a number of antigens. The viral coat contains surface
antigen (HBsAg), while the core contains the core
antigen (HBcAg) and the e antigen (HBeAg) as well
as the viral DNA.

Clinical Medicine, 3rd edn. London: Saunders, 1994.)

All carriers have HBsAg and anti-HBc. A carrier state
is defined as one in which HBsAg persists for 6 months
or longer (Fig. 6.26). Immune people (those who have
recovered from the infection and those vaccinated
against it) have anti-HBs and anti-HBc antibodies.
Previously, the e antigen (HBe) used to be a good
determinant of infectivity: it is present in highly infectious carriers, carriers without e antigen are intermediately infective, and anti-e antibody means a person has
low infectivity. However, HBe-negative but replication-competent mutants have been detected. This
means that a patient infected with the mutant virus
will, under the old standards, be classified as having
low infectivity and a low risk of developing chronic
liver disease when this is not the case. Infection with
HBe-negative mutants should be suspected if HBV
DNA is present in the blood but HBe antigen is
negative.

Disorders of the liver

Carriers are defined as people in whom hepatitis B
surface antigen has been detected for more than
6 months.
All sexual and household contacts of the infected person with hepatitis B should be vaccinated, if possible.
People who are in high-risk groups, and should receive
the hepatitis B immunisation vaccine are:

parenteral. Hepatitis D may infect at the same time
as hepatitis B or infect someone already chronically
infected with hepatitis B (superinfection).
Infection with HDV rarely resolves and most patients
will develop cirrhosis, some within the span of a few
years.

Hepatitis C
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been a major cause of posttransfusional hepatitis. It is an RNA flavirus.
HCV may be transmitted parenterally, from mother
to baby or through sexual contact, but because blood
viral titres are much lower, these routes of transmission
are uncommon (unlike hepatitis B). It has a low incidence rate at sexually transmitted disease clinics,
suggesting that transmission via sexual contact is
uncommon.
HCV shows much genetic diversity, with six genotypes and more than 100 subtypes. However, all are
equally pathogenic. It is found worldwide, particularly
in Japan, parts of South America, the Mediterranean,
Africa and the Middle East.
The UK, Northern Europe and North America are
areas of low seroprevalence (< 1% population), and
most infection is associated with high-risk activity
(mostly intravenous drug use).
The incubation period is 6–8 weeks and infection is
asymptomatic in about 90% of cases. However, unlike
hepatitis B, only 15% of patients recover fully, with
60–90% of people becoming chronic carriers with a risk
of developing chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. First-line treatment is pegylated
interferon and ribavirin for 24 weeks. Less than 1% will
develop fulminant acute hepatitis.

Hepatitis D
Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is a defective RNA virus that
can cause infection and replicate only in conjunction
with hepatitis B.
It has a worldwide distribution, and is particularly
prevalent in the Middle East, parts of Africa and South
America.
Infection in Northern Europe is mainly confined
to high-risk behaviour (intravenous drug abuse and
multiple blood transfusions). Transmission is mainly

This is especially common in Asia, Africa and the Middle
East, but is seen in some rural parts of the UK particularly associated with pig farming.
It is spread by the faecal–oral route. The incubation
period is 2–9 weeks (usually 6 weeks). Clinically, the infection is mild but jaundice is apparent.
High-risk age groups include those aged 15–40 years,
and it has a 15–20% mortality rate in pregnant women
as it may cause fulminant acute hepatitis in this group. It
does not lead to chronic infection.

Liver abscess and non-viral liver
infections
Liver abscesses are more common in developing parts of
the world.
In the past, they were relatively common complications of appendicitis or perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, but improved management of these
conditions has seen a decrease in the formation of
abscesses.
They usually result from bacterial infection spread
through the biliary tree (ascending cholangitis), carried
from the gut in the portal system, from a penetrating injury to the liver, direct extension from a perinephric
or other abscess, or infection carried in branches of
the hepatic artery.
Amoebic abscesses must be considered in travellers,
as Entamoeba histolytica causes abscesses as well as
amoebic dysentery. Characteristically, the abscesses
are filled with necrotic material which looks like
anchovy paste.
Symptoms vary from general malaise to febrile jaundice with right upper quadrant pain and tender
hepatomegaly.
Diagnosis is by ultrasonography, chest radiography,
serological tests and analysis of the aspirated contents of
the abscess.
Treatment of large abscesses is by radiologically controlled drainage and the administration of antibiotics.
Complications include rupture and septicaemia.
Apart from viral hepatitis and bacterial infections,
parasitic infections of the liver also occur, especially
in the developing world. The two most important parasitic infections are those caused by helminths (worms)
and protozoa.

127

The liver
Malaria (caused by the protozoon Plasmodium spp.)
and visceral leishmaniasis (caused by Leishmania donovani) result in hepatomegaly apart from their other systemic symptoms.
Helminths which infect the liver include Schistosoma
spp. and Echinococcus granulosus, apart from liver flukes.
The first causes portal tract fibrosis leading to portal hypertension, while the second is the cause of hydatid
cysts containing developing worms.

Clinical Note
Abscesses are collections of pus, caused by an
inflammatory reaction, often as a result of
bacterial infection. In general, ‘if there is pus about,
let it out’! Treatment of abscesses in accessible
parts of the body is usually by surgical drainage or
aspiration.

Autoimmune hepatitis
This form of chronic hepatitis affects predominantly
young and middle-aged women, and is associated with
the HLA alleles HLA-B8, HLA-DR3 and HLA-DR4. It is
also associated with other autoimmune diseases, such
as pernicious anaemia and thyroiditis.
The patient may be asymptomatic, or present
with symptoms associated with autoimmune disease
such as fatigue, fever and arthritis. 25% of patients
present with acute hepatitis displaying jaundice.
On examination, the patient may have hepatosplenomegaly, bruises, cutaneous striae, acne, hirsutism
and possibly ascites. Extrahepatic manifestations
may be present, such as glomerulonephritis, fever or
pleurisy.
The liver biochemistry shows elevated serum aminotransferases, alkaline phosphatases and bilirubin (to a
lesser degree). Serum a-globulins are usually twice the
normal titre.
There are two types of autoimmune hepatitis, classified by the autoantibodies detected:
• Type I has antinuclear and anti-smooth muscle
autoantibodies
• Type II has anti-liver-kidney-microsomal (LKM) autoantibodies and anti-liver cytosolic autoantibodies.
Type I autoimmune hepatitis affects women, whereas
type II mainly affects girls aged 5–20 years, and is generally less common.
Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis involves steroids (prednisolone) and immunosuppressants (azathioprine). The therapy is given indefinitely, and can bring
remission to 90% of the cases. Liver transplantation is
also an option if drug therapy fails.

128

Primary biliary cirrhosis (see below) is another form
of autoimmune liver disease.

Diseases of the biliary tract
associated with cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune
disorder and thus affects women, especially those
40–50 years of age, more than men. It can occur in conjunction with other autoimmune diseases, e.g. Sjögren’s
syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
The epithelium of the bile ducts (especially that
of the smaller intrahepatic ducts) is destroyed by
an autoimmune reaction and the damaged areas
become surrounded by lymphocytes. The surrounding hepatocytes undergo necrosis, in a pattern resembling piecemeal necrosis. Granulomas may also be
present.
All patients with PBC have anti-mitochondrial autoantibodies and this, together with raised serum alkaline phosphatase, is diagnostic for the condition. The
presence of antimitochondrial antibodies implies a
connection with autoimmunity, although the exact
pathogenetic mechanisms are unknown.
An attempt at regeneration then takes place in the
form of proliferation of small bile ductules at the edges
of the portal tracts, with consequent fibrosis disrupting
the normal architecture of the liver.
Eventually, diffuse and irreversible cirrhosis occurs
which may be complicated by liver failure, portal hypertension and, rarely, hepatocellular carcinoma.
Clinically, the patient will have pruritus, jaundice
and xanthelasma (deposits of cholesterol-laden macrophages around the eyes, easily visible macroscopically).
The course and prognosis of the disease is slow
(about 10 years) but variable and there is no effective
medical treatment although ursodeoxycholate (a bile
acid substitute) is of benefit in some patients, improving liver function and survival.
Treatment is mainly symptomatic, such as cholestyramine for pruritus. Cholestasis results in malabsorption
of the fat-soluble vitamins, therefore supplements are
given. Treatment of PBC is difficult and often ineffective,
so liver transplantation should be considered when the
bilirubin levels rise above 100 mmol/L.

Secondary biliary cirrhosis
Secondary biliary cirrhosis is caused by prolonged
obstruction of extrahepatic bile ducts, often as a
result of gallstones, biliary atresia, strictures caused
by previous surgery or carcinoma of the head of the
pancreas.

Disorders of the liver
Bile remains in the obstructed ducts and inflammation and periportal fibrosis may result, eventually
leading to cirrhosis.
Bile duct proliferation may occur and secondary bacterial infection (ascending cholangitis) may complicate
biliary strictures and gallstones.
Diagnosis is by ultrasonography, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.

Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic
inflammatory disease often associated with inflammatory bowel disease. Seventy per cent of cases occur in
association with ulcerative colitis.
Male patients outnumber females by 2:1, and they
usually present at around 39 years of age.
Intrahepatic, and sometimes extrahepatic, bile ducts
become surrounded by a mantle of chronic inflammatory cells.
Eventually onion skin fibrosis occurs (concentric
fibrosis around the ducts). The ducts are seen on ERCP
as having a ‘beaded’ appearance. Small ducts near the
portal tracts may be totally replaced by fibrous tissue
(‘vanishing bile ducts’).
Patients vary from being asymptomatic to suffering
from chronic liver disease, with pruritus, jaundice,
fatigue and eventually portal hypertension.
Elevated serum alkaline phosphatase and myeloperoxidase ANCA antibodies in 80% of cases suggest a
diagnosis of PSC. However, liver biopsy is the best diagnostic tool. Patients with PSC have a higher risk of
developing cholangiocarcinoma. Medical management
is based around symptom relief, with liver transplant
being the only life-prolonging treatment.

Alcohol, drug and toxin associated
disease
Alcoholic liver disease
Alcohol produces a range of liver diseases, from fatty
liver (steatosis) to cirrhosis. The pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease is summarized in Fig. 6.27.

Hepatic steatosis (fatty liver)
Fatty liver is seen in a number of disorders, including
alcoholic liver disease and obesity with or without
diabetes mellitus.
Normally, lipids from the diet or released from
adipose tissue are transported to the liver where they
are metabolized.
Alcohol is toxic, and when it is drunk in excess its metabolism becomes a priority (Fig. 6.28). Cellular energy
is diverted towards this and away from other essential
metabolic pathways, including the metabolism of fat
in the liver.
Fat then accumulates in the cytoplasm of liver cells,
particularly in zone 3, the area adjacent to the central
vein and furthest from the arterial supply.
In chronic ingestion of alcohol, the liver becomes a
large greasy organ weighing as much as 5–6 kg.
If alcohol abuse continues, fibrosis and cirrhosis may
occur but fatty change is reversible if alcohol intake is
stopped.

Alcoholic hepatitis
This is inflammation of the liver caused by alcohol
ingestion.
Alcohol is directly cytotoxic at high concentrations
and cells swell with granular cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic aggregates of intermediate filaments (Mallory bodies) appear in the hepatocytes. There is aggregation of
neutrophils around damaged liver cells (especially

those with Mallory bodies), and lymphocytes and macrophages enter the lobule.
Focal necrosis is found in zone 3 (centrilobular
zone) aided by damage caused by free radicals.
These are produced by phagocytes in response to cytokines, and they are also generated by lipid peroxidation. Ballooning of hepatocytes can occur, due to
the retention of proteins and water after injury
to organelles.
Collagen deposition almost always ensues, especially
with repeated bouts of high alcohol intake, and the risk
of cirrhosis is greater than in purely fatty change.
Mallory bodies may also be seen in other conditions
including primary biliary cirrhosis, Wilson’s disease and
hepatocellular carcinoma.
Patients with alcoholic hepatitis have elevated serum levels of alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, g-glutamyl
transpeptidase, bilirubin and an increased prothrombin
time. Often a low serum albumin accompanies these
findings.
If the patient stops drinking, the inflammation will
resolve of its own accord.

130

Alcoholic cirrhosis
Cirrhosis is the final and irreversible result of alcohol
damage.
It usually develops over a number of years, but it may
become apparent in as little as 2–3 years if associated
with alcoholic hepatitis.
The underlying pathological mechanisms causing
alcoholic cirrhosis are similar to those of cirrhosis due
to other causes. The hepatocytes attempt to regenerate
but the normal architecture is disturbed and nodules
form, separated by fibrous septa. This disrupts the normal blood flow through the liver, and it becomes less
efficient at performing its functions. In the early stages,
the liver is usually large and fatty but later it shrinks to
become small, brown and almost non-fatty.
Remember the major complications of cirrhosis:
liver failure, portal hypertension and hepatocellular
carcinoma.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a
wide spectrum of liver disease which occurs in

Disorders of the liver
individuals who do not consume excess levels of alcohol. This ranges from simple fatty liver (steatosis), to
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), to irreversible
cirrhosis. These are rapidly becoming major contributors to liver disease in the developed world as they are
associated with insulin resistance and metabolic
syndrome. Risk factors include obesity, diabetes and
hyperlipidaemia.
Many patients are asymptomatic, or present with fatigue and malaise. Jaundice is rare. Diagnosis can be difficult and is normally confirmed by raised liver function
tests, especially transaminases, for which no other cause
can be found; alongside an ultrasound or CT scan which
confirms fatty liver. Treatment is usually focused around
lifestyle changes such as weight loss and eating a
balanced diet, as well as optimizing diabetic control.

Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis
Only a small proportion of patients with NAFLD will develop NASH. This is characterised by hepatic fat accumulation alongside inflammation of the liver, which can
ultimately cause hepatic necrosis. Symptoms and investigations are the same as above, with a liver biopsy being
the only way to establish a diagnosis of NASH. Treatment
is based around exercise, diet and anti-glycaemic drugs.
Antioxidants, such as vitamin E are also thought to be
effective, and are currently the focus of clinical trials.

Drugs and toxins
The liver is vital in the metabolism and excretion of
drugs and toxins. At least 10% of all adverse reactions
to drugs affect the liver.
Drug reactions may be predictable (occur in any individual if a sufficient dose is given) or unpredictable
(idiosyncratic, or non-dose-related). Predictable drug
reactions are also known as intrinsic reactions.
Drugs may cause damage to hepatocytes indistinguishable from viral hepatitis, cholestasis by affecting
bile production or excretion, or other liver dysfunction.
The mechanisms of drug-induced damage include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Direct toxicity to cells
The conversion of the drug to a toxic metabolite
Drug-induced autoimmune reaction
Peroxidation of lipids
Denaturation of proteins
Mitochondrial dysfunction
Free radical generation
ATP depletion
Binding or blockage of transfer RNA (tRNA)
Attachment to membrane receptors
Disruption of calcium homeostasis
Disruption of the cytoskeleton in hepatocytes.

Drug-induced autoimmunity usually occurs when the
drug, or one of its metabolites, acts as a hapten (a small

6

molecule that is not immunogenic on its own, but
which can bind to another molecule and produce an
immune response).
A careful drug history should be taken from anyone
with signs or symptoms of liver disease, including drugs
taken many months before, as there may be a long delay
between the administration of the drug and signs of any
injury becoming apparent. Injury may also be immediate, depending on the drug or toxin and the type of
damage caused.
Diagnosis is made on the history and clinical signs,
the fact that improvement should occur if the patient
stops taking the offending drug, and by excluding other
causes of liver damage.
A summary of hepatotoxins and their effects is given
in Fig. 6.29.

Vascular disorders
Liver infarction
Liver infarction is rare because of the dual blood supply of the liver. It may occur if an intrahepatic branch
of the hepatic artery is occluded, or the flow of blood
through it is interrupted. This is seen in only five
situations:
• Trauma to the artery
• Embolization or ligation of the artery, e.g. for therapeutic reasons
• Infective endocarditis
• Eclampsia (seizures during pregnancy)
• Polyarteritis nodosa.
If the main hepatic artery is occluded, blood flow
through the portal venous systems is usually sufficient
to prevent necrosis, except in the case of a transplanted
liver when occlusion usually leads to complete necrosis
(in which case another transplant is needed).

Portal vein obstruction and thrombosis
Portal vein obstruction may occur outside the liver (extrahepatic) or inside (intrahepatic). Extrahepatic obstruction is by thrombosis. Intrahepatic obstruction is
most commonly caused by cirrhosis, but it can also
be caused by congenital hepatic fibrosis and metastases,
or primary carcinoma of the liver.
It may lead to portal hypertension (see earlier), with
abdominal pain, ascites and oesophageal varices.

Hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd–Chiari
syndrome)
Budd–Chiari syndrome is a rare condition in which occlusion (due to thrombosis) of the hepatic vein results
in blockage of the flow of venous blood out of the liver.

It may be acute or chronic. Acute presentation is usually with sudden onset of abdominal tenderness, epigastric pain, nausea (and vomiting) and shock.
Chronic thrombosis results in hepatomegaly, portal
hypertension (and its associated signs and symptoms),
jaundice and cirrhosis. Ascites can be found in both
acute and chronic forms of the disease.
It may be caused by any condition that predisposes
to the formation of thrombi, most notably:

because chemotherapy and radiotherapy, given as part
of transplant therapy, damage the endothelium.
Treatment of this disease is aimed at controlling
hepatocellular failure and ascites formation.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) can develop following hepatitis B and C infections, alcoholic cirrhosis and
haemochromatosis. Aflatoxin (a fungal metabolite),
androgens and the contraceptive pill are all associated
with HCC.
It affects men more than women, and usually presents
before 50 years of age. The signs and symptoms include:

Polycythaemia
Pregnancy
Postpartum states
Oral contraceptive
Hepatocellular carcinoma
Other intra-abdominal cancers.

Surgical treatment, with the creation of a portosystemic
anastomosis is required. However, liver transplantation
is often the treatment of choice. Mortality is higher in
acute cases, with untreated cases resulting in death,
but even in its chronic form, 5-year survival is only
about 50%.

Veno-occlusive disease
Veno-occlusive disease is similar to Budd–Chiari syndrome in its presentation. It is believed to be caused where
damage to the endothelium of the sinusoids allows red
blood cells into the space of Disse, which activates the coagulation cascade. The products of coagulation are then
swept into the central vein, occluding it.
The incidence is higher in those receiving marrow
transplants (25% in allogenic recipients), probably

Diagnosis is made by blood tests and imaging. Liver
function tests may be elevated, and alpha-fetoprotein is
usually raised in ›50% of cases. Ultrasound and CT scan
are usually the first line to image tumours.
Treatment usually involves radiological ablation or
sometimes surgical resection or liver transplantation.
The prognosis is not good. Survival is usually less
than 6 months, but up to 30% of cases can be cured if
discovered early enough.

THE PANCREAS
The pancreas is both an endocrine and an exocrine
gland.
Most of the pancreas consists of exocrine tissue, in
which are embedded islands of endocrine cells (islets
of Langerhans). The exocrine cells produce enzymes
that play an important role in digestion. The hormones
produced by the islets are essential for the regulation of
blood glucose.

Anatomy
The pancreas is a soft, elongated digestive gland which is
grey–pink and ‘feather-like’ in appearance. It is approximately 15 cm in length, lobular and weighs about 80 g.
It is retroperitoneal and extends transversely across
the posterior abdominal wall from the curve of the
duodenum to the hilum of the spleen.
The right side lies across the vertebral bodies of
L1–L3. It is posterior to the stomach and the transverse
mesocolon is attached to its anterior margin. It is located in the left hypochondriac and epigastric regions.
The pancreas has four parts: a head with an uncinate
process (from the Latin meaning ‘hook’), a neck, a body
and a tail (Fig. 7.1):
• The head is the expanded right portion. It nestles in the
curve of the duodenum, anterior to the inferior vena
cava and the left renal vein. In a groove on the posterior surface of the head lies the common bile duct

• The uncinate process is a small portion of the head
extending superiorly and to the left, ‘hooked’ around
the superior mesenteric vessels
• The neck joins the body to the head, overlying the superior mesenteric vessels and the portal vein. The anterior surface of the neck is covered with peritoneum
and is adjacent to the pylorus
• The body is triangular in cross-section and extends as
far as the hilum of the left kidney. It overlies the
aorta, the left renal vein, the splenic vessels and
the termination of the inferior mesenteric vein.
It is crossed anteriorly by the attachment of the transverse mesocolon. Note that where the body crosses
the aorta, superior mesenteric artery, left adrenal
gland and left kidney, its posterior surface is not
covered by peritoneum
• The tail lies in the lienorenal ligament and ends at
the hilum of the spleen.
The main pancreatic duct traverses the gland from left
to right, i.e. from the tail to the head and together with
the bile duct, opens into the second part of the duodenum at the hepatopancreatic ampulla (of Vater). This
opens into the duodenum at the major duodenal
papilla.
There are two important sphincters in this region:
the pancreatic duct sphincter at the termination of the
pancreatic duct, and the hepatopancreatic sphincter
(of Oddi) at the ampulla of Vater. They control the flow
of pancreatic juice (as well as bile, in the case of the
latter) into the duodenum.

An accessory duct, if present, may drain the inferior
part of the head as well as the uncinate process. It has a
separate opening into the duodenum at the minor
duodenal papilla above the ampulla of Vater.
HINTS AND TIPS
An accessory pancreatic duct is sometimes present,
formed by the proximal end of the dorsal pancreatic
duct, which normally disappears. It opens into the
minor duodenal papilla.

Blood supply and venous drainage
Because the pancreas has an endocrine function, it has a
rich blood supply.
The arteries supplying the pancreas arise from the
splenic and pancreaticoduodenal arteries. The anterior
and posterior superior and inferior pancreaticoduodenal
arteries supply the head, while up to 10 branches of the
splenic artery supply the remainder of the pancreas
(Fig. 7.2).
Venous drainage is to the portal, splenic and superior
mesenteric veins, with most going into the splenic vein.

Lymphatic drainage and innervation
The course of lymphatic vessels draining the pancreas
follows that of the blood vessels. Lymphatic drainage

136

aorta

is to pancreaticosplenic or suprapancreatic nodes alongside the splenic artery and to preaortic nodes around the
coeliac and superior mesenteric arteries. Some vessels
also terminate in nodes near the gastric pylorus.
The innervation of the pancreas is from the splanchnic nerves and the vagi through the coeliac and superior
mesenteric plexuses.

Embryology and development
The pancreas develops between the mesenteric layers
from two buds (the dorsal and ventral pancreatic buds)
that originate from the endodermal lining of the caudal
foregut (which goes on to form the proximal duodenum) in weeks 4–6 (Fig. 7.3). Most of the pancreas is
formed from the dorsal bud, which is larger and appears
before the ventral bud.
As the duodenum rotates to form a C-shape, the
ventral pancreatic bud, which originates near the
ampulla of Vater, migrates 270 around the back of
the duodenum to lie below and behind the dorsal
pancreatic bud, trapping the mesenteric vessels between them. This allows fusion of the ventral and
dorsal pancreatic buds. Ultimately, part of the head
as well as the uncinate process is derived from the ventral bud.
The distal part of the dorsal pancreatic duct normally joins with the duct of the ventral pancreatic

bud, to become the main pancreatic duct. The proximal part of the dorsal pancreatic duct either regresses
and disappears, or becomes an accessory pancreatic
duct (of Santorini). The pancreatic islets of Langerhans develop from pancreatic parenchymal tissue
in the 3rd month, and are scattered throughout the
gland.
Insulin secretion begins during the 5th month of
embryonic development and fetal levels of insulin are

independent of those of the mother. Note that insulin
does not cross the placenta.

Histology
The pancreas is covered with a thin capsule of fibrocollagenous connective tissue, from which septa extend
into the gland, dividing it into lobules. Nerves and
larger blood vessels travel within the septa.

137

The pancreas and biliary tract

The exocrine pancreas
The exocrine cells secrete digestive enzymes into a network of ducts that meet to form the main pancreatic
duct, which joins the common bile duct and opens into
the duodenum at the ampulla of Vater (see Fig. 4.2).
The basic unit of the exocrine pancreas is the acinus.
The acini are tubuloacinar glands similar to salivary
glands in their organization. They are called ‘acinar’
(Latin for ‘berry-like’) because the secretory portion is
similar to a grape, with the duct resembling a stalk
(Fig. 7.4). The acini consist principally of pyramidal epithelial cells, which produce the digestive enzymes of
the pancreas. The apices of the cells surround a central
lumen, which marks the termination of the duct system.
From the lumen, the intercalated ducts begin within
the acini where the duct cells are called centroacinar
cells. Intercalated ducts are the smallest members of
the pancreatic duct system and are lined with squamous
epithelium. They drain into intralobular ducts lined
with cuboidal or low columnar epithelium.
In turn, the intralobular ducts lead into larger interlobular ducts in the fibro-collagenous interlobular connective tissue. These are lined by columnar epithelium

Fig. 7.4 A pancreatic acinus. The
secretion of alkaline fluid and
proenzymes is regulated separately,
and pancreatic fluid rich in one or the
other can be produced depending on
the stimulus. Secretin initiates
production of alkaline-rich fluid while
cholecystokinin initiates production of
an enzyme-rich fluid.

and also contain goblet and enteroendocrine (amine
precursor uptake and decarboxylation, APUD) cells.
As the size of the ducts increases, the supporting connective tissue becomes denser, with the wall of the
main pancreatic duct containing a layer of smooth
muscle.

The endocrine pancreas
The islets of Langerhans form the primary component
of the endocrine pancreas. These clusters of endocrine
cells (Fig. 7.5) can be found throughout the pancreas
but are most prevalent in the tail.
Pancreatic islet cells can be differentiated from the
exocrine cells as they are smaller and paler. There is
an extensive network of blood vessels surrounding
the islets – each islet has its own capillary network which
is in contact with every cell in that islet – into
which the hormones insulin, glucagon and somatostatin
are secreted. Their functions are described in Fig. 7.6.
Other cell types include vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-secreting cells and enterochromaffin
cells, which secrete serotonin, motilin and substance P.

The acinar cells secrete a small volume of fluid rich in
digestive enzymes, which break down carbohydrates,
fats, proteins and nucleic acids.
Most of these enzymes are secreted in an inactive
form to protect the pancreas from autodigestion, and
are activated in the duodenum (see later).

Fig. 7.6 Functions of endocrine hormones.
Insulin

Produced by pancreatic β (or B) cells, which
constitute 70% of pancreatic endocrine cells.
It acts on all cells in the body to increase the
uptake of glucose from the blood into the cells.

Glucagon

Produced by pancreatic α (or A) cells (20%)
and it acts mainly on the liver.
It increases glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis
to raise blood glucose concentration.

Somatostatin

Secreted from δ (or D) cells (5–10%).
It acts locally as a paracrine agent, inhibiting the
production of insulin and glucagon. It also
inhibits the gut peptides secretin,
cholecystokinin (CCK), gastrin and motilin.

Pancreatic
polypeptide

Produced by PP or F cells (1–2%).
It self-regulates the pancreas secretion activities,
both exocrine and endocrine.

The pancreas secretes a fluid rich in bicarbonate, which,
together with secretions from the gallbladder and the intestinal juices, neutralizes gastric acid in the duodenum,
raising the pH to 6 or 7.
Secretion in the pancreas takes place in a similar way
to that in the salivary glands. The acini secrete a slightly
hypertonic fluid, rich in bicarbonate, which is modified
as it travels through the ducts (Fig. 7.4). Chloride is actively exchanged for bicarbonate by the epithelial cells
of the extralobular ducts as the fluid travels through
the ducts (Fig. 7.7) and concentrations of bicarbonate
and chloride are reciprocal.
When the pancreas is stimulated to increase its rate of
secretion, there is less time for chloride and bicarbonate
to be exchanged and the fluid is richer in bicarbonate.
When the rate of secretion is low, the fluid is produced
mainly by the intralobular ducts. However, when secretin stimulates an increased rate of production, most of
the additional fluid is produced by the extralobular
ducts.

Pancreatic exocrine functions
and physiology
The pancreas secretes about 1.5 L of fluid a day (over ten
times its own weight). This fluid contains cations,
anions, albumin, globulin and digestive enzymes.
The bulk of the fluid is the sodium- and bicarbonaterich juice secreted by cells of the small ducts, which neutralizes acid entering the duodenum from the stomach.

of production of juice are both proportional to the
concentration of bicarbonate in the blood.
H þ ions, which are pumped out of the duct cells in
exchange for Kþ and Naþ, neutralize bicarbonate in the
blood by forming carbonic acid. This dissociates to form
CO2 and H2O.
The dissociation is catalysed by carbonic anhydrase
and is a similar reaction to that occurring in the kidney.
The carbon dioxide diffuses across the basolateral
membrane into the duct epithelial cell. Here, it is combined with water by carbonic anhydrase, to make carbonic acid (H2CO3), which then dissociates to form
Hþ and HCO3– (bicarbonate) ions. The H þ ions are actively eliminated at the basolateral membrane (which
helps drive the reaction to produce more CO2 in the
blood and, therefore, HCO3  ions).

Enzyme secretion
There are three major types of enzymes secreted by the
pancreas:
• Proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin and
carboxypeptidase)
• Amylase
• Lipase.

140

Additionally, the pancreas also secretes ribonuclease
and deoxyribonuclease. These are summarized in
Fig. 7.8.

Proteolytic enzymes
The proteolytic enzymes play an important role in
protein digestion. It follows that these enzymes are
capable of damaging the tissues of the pancreas and
so they are secreted as proenzymes, which are activated
by substances in the duodenum.
Enterokinase (enteropeptidase) in the brush border of
the duodenum secreted in response to cholecystokinin,
converts trypsinogen to trypsin. Trypsinogen is therefore not activated until it reaches the duodenum where
it is needed.
Trypsin then activates the other proteolytic proenzymes, including its own proenzyme trypsinogen,
resulting in an autocatalytic chain reaction.
To protect the pancreas from the chain reaction and
autodigestion (that would result from even a small
amount of trypsin in the pancreas), the pancreas contains a trypsin inhibitor called the kazal inhibitor. This
forms a complex with trypsin and prevents it acting.
Also, the maintenance of an acid pH in the zymogen
granules prevents the proenzymes being exposed to
their optimal pH. In acute pancreatitis, phospholipase
A2 is activated by trypsin in the pancreatic duct. It then

The pancreas
acts on lecithin (a normal constituent of bile) to form
lysolecithin, which damages cell membranes and causes
disruption of pancreatic tissue and necrosis of surrounding fat. Circulating levels of pancreatic a-amylase
also increase in acute pancreatitis and measurement of
levels in the blood is used as a diagnostic tool.

Amylase
Like salivary amylase, pancreatic amylase hydrolyses
polysaccharides into disaccharides, and therefore is involved in carbohydrate digestion in the duodenum. It is
secreted in its active form as it does not damage pancreatic tissue.

Lipase
This is the most important enzyme in terms of fat digestion. It hydrolyses triglycerides into glycerol and fatty
acids, therefore in pancreatic insufficiency where enzyme secretion is deficient, fats cannot be digested
and a malabsorption syndrome occurs (see section on
‘Pancreatic insufficiency’).

The fate of pancreatic enzymes in the duodenum
The digestive enzymes survive for differing periods of
time once they enter the intestines.
Measurements have shown that around 75% of amylase and 20% of trypsin were present in the distal ileum, but only 1% of lipase secreted actually reached
this part of the small intestines. Different mechanisms

cholinergic
agents

bombesin
litrin

are thought to be involved, and the small intestine is
thought to be permeable to several digestive enzymes.
It has been found that chymotrypsinogen and amylase are capable of crossing the basolateral membranes
of pancreatic cells.
Some foods contain inhibitors of the digestive enzymes. For example, soybeans contain the Bowman–
Birk inhibitor, which stops trypsin and chymotrypsin
activities.

Control of pancreatic secretion
Pancreatic exocrine secretion is controlled by neuroendocrine signals, which are hormones and substances released from nerve terminals (Fig. 7.9).
Vagal (parasympathetic) stimulation enhances the rate
of secretion of both enzyme and aqueous components
of pancreatic juice.
Sympathetic stimulation inhibits secretion, probably
by decreasing blood flow.
Secretin and cholecystokinin (released from the duodenal mucosa) stimulate secretion of the aqueous
component of pancreatic fluid.
Separate control of the aqueous and enzymatic
components explains the variation in composition of
pancreatic juice.
The control of secretion can be split up into the
cephalic, gastric and intestinal (duodenal) phases, like
the control of gastric secretions.

The pancreas and biliary tract
Cephalic phase
This is very minor in humans. Gastrin is released from
the mucosa of the antrum in response to vagal stimulation (via acetylcholine and VIP). This causes the release
of a small amount of pancreatic juice with a high
protein content.

Gastric phase
Gastrin is released in response to gastric distension (via
the vago-vagal reflex) and the presence of amino acids
and peptides in the antrum. This continues to stimulate
release of pancreatic juice.
Vago-vagal reflexes elicited by distension of the fundus
or antrum also cause the release of small amounts of
pancreatic juice with a high enzyme content (by acting
on receptors on the acinar cells in the pancreas).

Intestinal phase
This is the longest and most important phase. It involves
the secretion of two hormones, secretin and cholecystokinin. Chyme in the duodenum and upper jejunum
stimulates pancreatic secretion.
Secretin is released from the duodenal and upper
jejunal mucosal cells in response to acid in the lumen.
Secretin acts on the pancreatic ducts to stimulate the
secretion of a large volume of HCO3 rich fluid (but
with low levels of pancreatic enzymes). It also stimulates bile production in the liver.
Cholecystokinin (CCK, also called pancreozymin) is
secreted from duodenal and upper jejunal mucosal cells
in response to peptides, amino acids and fatty acids in
the lumen. It has two actions:
• It acts on pancreatic acinar cells to stimulate enzyme
synthesis and release
• It acts on the gallbladder by stimulating its contraction and the relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi. This
allows release of bile into the duodenum.
Therefore, CCK induces the secretion of a pancreatic
juice that is rich in enzymes and which is accompanied
by concentrated bile for fat absorption. The substances
that stimulate pancreatic secretion are summarized in
Fig. 7.9.
CCK has little direct effect on ductular epithelium
but potentiates the effect of secretin, which is a weak
agonist of acinar cells.
Vagal stimulation is important and vagotomy reduces the response to chyme in the duodenum by 50%.
Somatostatin has the opposite effect and by inhibiting adenylate cyclase and decreasing cyclic AMP, it inhibits the secretion of acinar and duct cells.
Insulin, insulin-like growth factors and epidermal
growth factor potentiate enzyme synthesis and secretion, through the activation of receptor-associated tyrosine kinase.

DISORDERS OF THE EXOCRINE
PANCREAS

Congenital abnormalities
Agenesis and hypoplasia
Congenital abnormalities of the pancreas are rare. However, as with other organs, the pancreas may fail to develop at all (agenesis) or develop incompletely
(hypoplasia).

Annular pancreas and pancreas divisum
In normal development, the duodenum rotates and
the ventral pancreatic bud migrates around the back
of the duodenum to lie caudal and dorsal to the dorsal
bud. This allows fusion of the ventral and dorsal pancreatic buds (Fig. 7.3).
Sometimes, migration of the ventral bud is incomplete, or it migrates in both directions, so that a ring
of pancreatic tissue surrounds the duodenum. This is
called an annular pancreas, and it may cause constriction or complete obstruction of the duodenum.
Pancreas divisum, either partial or complete, may occur where fusion of the two pancreatic buds does not
take place. It is found in 5% of patients.

Ectopic pancreatic tissue
Heterotopic pancreatic tissue is sometimes found in the
mucosa of the stomach, the duodenum and in Meckel’s
diverticula.
The pancreatic tissue is normal (although in an
abnormal place), and so may produce substances
normally made by the pancreas.

Pancreatitis
Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas) is classified
as acute or chronic, but it is sometimes difficult to separate the two.

Acute pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis is relatively common, affecting 1% of
the UK population. It can be severe and complicated
with a mortality of 5–10% but mild and moderate
forms present with variable degrees of pain. The Glasgow
criteria (Fig. 7.10) are used to assess severity, although it is
difficult to differentiate mild from severe pancreatitis in
the first 24 hours. The presence of three or more items
on either scoring system implies severe pancreatitis; if
more than seven (out of 11) items are present, mortality
approaches 100%.

Disorders of the exocrine pancreas

severity of pancreatitis. Three or more signs indicate a
severe presentation.

Age > 5 years
Blood glucose >10 mmol/L with no history of diabetes
White cell count > 15 x 109/L

Corrected calcium < 2.0 mmol/L
Blood urea > 16 mmol/L and no improvement with
intravenous fluids
Arterial pO2 < 8 kPa (60 mmHg)
Serum albumin < 32 g/L
Metabolic acidosis

Aetiology
The main cause in the UK, accounting for 50% of cases,
is gallstones. The majority of non-gallstone pancreatitis
is due to alcohol. Other causes include infection, trauma,
drugs, e.g. azathioprine, sodium valproate and diuretics,
hypothermia, hypercalcaemia, hyperlipidaemia, postERCP (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography)
and post-operative states. Carcinoma of the pancreas
may also cause acute pancreatitis. Rarely, it is hereditary
(see below).
HINTS AND TIPS

Pathology and clinical features
Different agents cause acute pancreatitis by different
mechanisms. Fig. 7.11 summarizes the pathogenetic
mechanisms of the major causes. Whatever the cause,
they all lead to the release of lytic enzymes, which are
then activated and cause damage. Pancreatic enzymes,
in particular trypsin, lipase and phospholipase A2, digest pancreatic tissue, in particular causing fat necrosis.
Blood vessel walls are also damaged causing extravasation of blood or ecchymoses, which may be extensive
enough to discolour the skin of the flanks (Grey
Turner’s sign) or around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign).
The typical presentation is with severe abdominal
pain of sudden onset that may radiate into the back, together with nausea and vomiting. The upper abdomen
is usually tender to palpation. In severe cases tachycardia, tachypnoea and fever may be present.

Diagnosis
Diagnosis is by measurement of serum amylase. It is
normally greatly elevated (five times or more) in acute
pancreatitis. It is important to be aware that many other
conditions, e.g. perforated peptic ulcer, intestinal
obstruction and trauma can cause moderate increases
in serum amylase, and only a marked elevation is
characteristic of pancreatitis.
Clinical Note

It is easy to remember the causes of acute pancreatitis
using the mnemonic ‘I GET SMASHED’: Idiopathic,
Gallstones, Ethanol, Trauma, Steroids, Mumps,
Autoimmune, Scorpion bites, Hyperlipidaemia/
Hypothermia, ERCP and Drugs (especially azathioprine
and diuretics).

Remember that not every patient with an elevated

143

The pancreas and biliary tract
Radiography shows characteristic findings in the
abdomen. The psoas shadow can be absent because of
retroperitoneal fluid and an air-filled dilatation of the
proximal jejunum will be seen, i.e. a ‘sentinel’ loop.
An abdominal ultrasound will show whether
gallstones are the cause or not.

Treatment
Patients with acute pancreatitis should be treated conservatively and kept ‘nil by mouth’, along with aggressive intravenous water and electrolyte replacement
with opiate analgesia (not morphine). This allows
the pancreas to ‘rest’ by removing secretory stimuli.
If the patient is hypoxic then need inspired oxygen.
Complications of acute pancreatitis include formation of an abscess or a pseudocyst (see later), renal failure due to shock, DIC, relapses and diabetes mellitus
if the inflammation is severe and necrosis ensues. In
severe cases an intensive care bed is often required to
manage these systemic complications.
If the pancreatitis is severe, the patient must receive
intravenous nutrition. Patients with cholangitis or jaundice and biliary pancreatitis may benefit from gallstone
removal via ERCP from the bile duct.
Severe pancreatitis occasionally results in significant
necrosis and surgical or laparoscopic necrosectomy may
be required.

Chronic pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is an on-going inflammation of the
pancreas accompanied by irreversible architectural
changes. It causes a great deal of pain and often permanent loss of pancreatic function, and may or may not be
preceded by acute pancreatitis.

Aetiology
Alcohol consumption causes more than 85% of cases,
and is the most common cause of pancreatitis in developed countries. High-fat and -protein diets amplify the
damage done by alcohol. Other causes include:
• Idiopathic chronic pancreatitis: this condition
occurs in older people and is associated with peripheral vascular disease
• Trauma and scar formation, leading to the obstruction of the main pancreatic duct
• Previous episodes of acute pancreatitis predispose to
others although they may oftenbe subclinical
• Hypercalcaemia causing the formation of calcified
plugs, which obstruct the pancreatic duct
• Cystic fibrosis resulting in protein plugs in the duct
system
• Hereditary forms of pancreatitis.

144

HINTS AND TIPS
Unlike acute pancreatitis, gallstones do not play an
important role in the aetiology of chronic pancreatitis.

Hereditary pancreatitis accounts for 5–15% of causes
overall. It should be suspected in an individual with
acute or chronic pancreatitis when detailed history either indicates a positive family history or the patient’s
history began in childhood or early adulthood. It can
be confirmed by detection of an increasing number of
identifiable genetic mutations, most commonly in the
trypsinogen gene, the trypsin inactivator cascade or
the cystic fibrosis genes.

Pathology
Chronic pancreatitis has four key pathological features:
•
•
•
•

Continuous chronic inflammation
Fibrous scarring
Loss of pancreatic tissue
Duct strictures with formation of calculi.

Clinical features
Patients normally present with a history of prolonged
ill-health with chronic epigastric pain, usually radiating
through to the back. Steatorrhoea (lipase deficiency prevents complete breakdown and absorption of fat in the
diet and weight loss from malabsorption occur due to
reduced pancreatic enzyme activity. Secondary diabetes
mellitus is caused by destruction of pancreatic islet cells.

Diagnosis
Serum amylase will be normal, in contrast to acute pancreatitis. Diagnosis is by CT scan complemented by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI); plain abdominal radiography can show
speckled calcification of the pancreas (caused by the
binding of calcium ions to necrosed fat). Diabetes mellitus should be excluded.

Treatment
Treatment involves stopping drinking alcohol and judicious use of analgesia. Surgery is an option in some
cases, but only in those who are committed to stop
drinking. Pancreatic enzyme supplements and a lowfat diet help the steatorrhoea, and diabetes mellitus is
treated with insulin or diet control and oral hypoglycaemic agents.

Pseudocysts
Pseudocysts are a complication of both acute and
chronic pancreatitis. They are localized collections of
serosanguinous fluid found 6 weeks after the onset
of an acute attack of pancreatitis.

Disorders of the exocrine pancreas
They are usually solitary, 5–10 cm in diameter and lie
in the lesser sac. Typically, they are characterized by
chronic pain and persistently raised serum amylase levels.
Pseudocysts may produce abdominal pain and, more
rarely, haemorrhage, infection and peritonitis. As they
usually present as an epigastric mass, they may be mistaken for a tumour in the pancreas.
They differ from true cysts in that true cysts have an
epithelial lining and are often congenital, while pseudocysts are surrounded by granulation tissue. Those smaller than 6 cm may resolve of their own accord.

Pancreatic insufficiency
In pancreatic insufficiency, pancreatic enzymes are absent or secreted in lower amounts than normal. Consequently, fat malabsorption occurs, with associated
steatorrhoea. A deficiency in the fat-soluble vitamins
A, D, E and K may also be found. The patient may be
malnourished.
Cystic fibrosis is a major cause of pancreatic insufficiency. It is an autosomal recessive disorder (with a carrier rate of 1 in 25 among Caucasians but the disease
incidence is 1:2500 live births), and its other major clinical feature is a tendency to chronic lung infections. The
underlying defect is an abnormality in the chloride ion
transporter.
Pancreatic insufficiency also occurs in chronic
pancreatitis.
Treatment is with high-dose oral pancreatic enzymes.
Additionally, a proton-pump inhibitor may help as it
produces a pH in the duodenum which is optimal for
fat digestion.

Carcinoma of the pancreas
Aetiology
Carcinoma of the pancreas accounts for about 5% of all
cancer deaths in the USA and the UK.
It is particularly common in diabetic females, being
most common over the age of 60 years. It is associated
with smoking. Of all pancreatic carcinomas, 60% occur
in the head, 15–20% in the body and 5–10% in the tail.
Twenty percent of cases involve the pancreas diffusely.

Clinical features
Those arising in the head are likely to produce symptoms earlier than those arising elsewhere. They may obstruct the ampulla of Vater or common bile duct causing
obstructive jaundice; in fact the classical presentation is
with painless progressive jaundice. Other presenting
symptoms include pain (50% of cases), intermittent
jaundice, diabetes mellitus and the general features of
malignancy, e.g. weight loss.

7

Clinical Note
Carcinoma of the head of the pancreas causes
jaundice which develops over a few weeks. The
jaundice is of the obstructive type, as the tumour
compresses the common bile duct at the ampulla of
Vater. The obstruction results in accumulation of bile
in the proximal biliary tree, and so the gallbladder
becomes enlarged. As inflammation is not usually
involved, the jaundice is painless. Interestingly, even
though the jaundice is due to a conjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia, itching is uncommon; although
you still get the other symptoms of obstructive jaundice
such as pale stools and dark urine.

The gallbladder may be dilated and easily palpable
(Courvoisier’s sign).
HINTS AND TIPS
If a gallbladder is palpable in the presence of jaundice,
Courvoisier’s law states that the cause is unlikely to be
gallstones.

Carcinomas arising in other parts of the pancreas are
less likely to produce symptoms and so are discovered
late. Consequently, they have a worse prognosis, often
having metastasized before diagnosis.
Most are adenocarcinomas and almost all begin in
the ductal epithelium. Less than 1% begin in the acinar
cells.
Weight loss usually occurs and some individuals
develop thrombophlebitis migrans (flitting venous
thromboses).

Diagnosis
An abdominal CT is the first line imaging when there is
a suspicion of pancreatic cancer.
EUS is also used to visualize the head of the pancreas
and take biopsies. ERCP is used in patients with jaundice to relieve biliary obstruction and acquire cytology
samples for diagnosis.

Treatment
The optimal treatment for carcinoma of the pancreas
is surgical, but less than 30% of patients are suitable.
Survival of up to 30% at 5 years with a surgical mortality
of < 5% can be achieved in sub-groups.
The operation is called Whipple’s procedure. It is a
major operation consisting of a partial gastrectomy,

145

The pancreas and biliary tract
duodenectomy and a partial pancreatectomy. It may
or may not include the removal of the gallbladder
and distal common bile duct. For small tumours, a
modified Whipple’s prodecure preserves the duodenum
and bile duct. Palliative surgical or endoscopic procedures can be used to relieve jaundice or gastric outlet
obstruction.
The overall prognosis is very poor, with a 5-year survival rate of <5%. This is due to its late presentation.

THE BILIARY SYSTEM
The biliary system comprises the gallbladder and bile
ducts. It serves to remove waste products from the liver
and carries bile salts to the intestine where they aid digestion. The biliary system is closely related both anatomically and functionally to the liver and pancreas.

The gallbladder
The gallbladder is a pear-shaped sac that concentrates
and stores bile secreted from the liver. It can hold
between 30 and 60 mL of bile and, when stimulated,
it releases its contents into the duodenum, through
the cystic and biliary ducts.
It lies on the right edge of the hepatic quadrate lobe,
in the gallbladder fossa on the visceral surface, partly
covered by peritoneum on its posterior and inferior surfaces. The anterior surface contacts the hepatic visceral
surface.
The gallbladder comprises three parts: the fundus,
body and neck (see Fig. 5.12), which tapers and makes
an S-shaped bend to join with the cystic duct. The cystic
duct is 2–4 cm long and joins the common hepatic duct
to form the bile duct. This travels anterior to the portal
vein and courses through the head of pancreas to open
into the second part of the duodenum through the sphincter of Oddi (hepatopancreatic sphincter) at the ampulla
of Vater (duodenal papilla).
The neck, as well as the cystic duct, has a spiral folding of its mucus membrane, forming a spiral valve (of
Heister). This keeps the cystic duct open constantly
for two purposes:
• To allow bile to pass into the gallbladder from the
liver when the bile duct is closed (by the sphincter
of Oddi and the choledochal sphincter)
• To allow bile to be secreted into the duodenum
when the gallbladder contracts.

Blood supply
The blood supply to the gallbladder is from the cystic
artery (a branch of the right hepatic artery).

146

Venous drainage occurs via the cystic vein which
drains the neck and ducts, and the veins draining the
fundus and body. These terminate in three ways:
• Draining directly into the hepatic visceral surface
• Joining the portal vein
• Joining the gastric, duodenal and pancreatic veins
(which then join the portal vein).

Lymphatic drainage
Lymph from the gallbladder passes to the hepatic nodes
via the cystic nodes, near the neck of the gallbladder.
These drain to the coeliac lymph nodes.

Nerve supply
The innervation to the gallbladder is from the coeliac
plexus (sympathetic), the vagus nerve (parasympathetic), the right phrenic nerve (sensory) and the hepatic plexus. The nerves follow the cystic artery.

The biliary tract
The biliary tract, comprising the bile ducts, conveys bile
from the liver to the duodenum. The left and right hepatic ducts join to form the common hepatic duct,
which descends in the free edge of the lesser omentum
and joins the cystic duct to form the common bile duct.
The common bile duct descends in the free edge of
the lesser omentum with the hepatic artery and portal
vein. It continues its descent behind the superior part
of the duodenum and head of the pancreas.
The termination of the bile duct, together with
that of the pancreatic duct forms the ampulla of Vater
(hepatopancreatic ampulla) in the superior part of the
duodenum.
There are two sphincters involved in the movement
of bile:
• The choledochal sphincter at the distal end of the common bile duct. Contraction of this prevents bile entering the ampulla and duodenum, thus causing its
storage in the gallbladder
• The sphincter of Oddi around the ampulla of Vater,
This controls the secretion of both bile and pancreatic juice into the duodenum.

Embryology and development
The embryology of the biliary system is intimately connected with that of the liver, hence it is worth reading
this section together with that of its counterpart in
Chapter 6. See also Fig. 7.3.
Important to the development of the biliary tract
is the liver bud. The connection between this and the
foregut (duodenum) narrows and forms the bile duct.

7

The biliary system
A small ventral outgrowth from the bile duct gives rise to
the gallbladder and cystic duct.
When bile begins to be produced around the 12th
week, the biliary tract and gallbladder are fully formed.
This allows the bile to enter the duodenum.

Histology of the gallbladder
The wall of the gallbladder consists of a mucous membrane, muscular layer, adventitia and a serous membrane.
The mucous membrane is made up of simple columnar
epithelium and a lamina propria of loose connective tissue. The columnar epithelial cells have a brush border of
many microvilli on their apical surfaces. The mucosa is
thrown into folds when the gallbladder is empty. This
allows it to distend when needed.
The muscular layer consists of smooth muscle
oriented longitudinally, transversely and obliquely with
associated collagenous elastic fibres.
The adventitia is made up of collagen and elastic fibres,
and contains a rich blood vessel and lymphatic network.
The intrahepatic bile ducts are lined by cuboidal or
low columnar epithelial cells. Increasing amounts of
fibroelastic connective tissue surround the epithelium
as the ducts become larger near the porta hepatis. The
largest ducts have smooth muscle in their walls.

Gallbladder functions
and physiology
The primary functions of the gallbladder are the concentration and storage of bile.
In the fasting state, the sphincter of Oddi (Fig. 7.12)
is contracted. However, in response to stimulation during and after meals to aid digestion (Fig. 7.13) it relaxes,
allowing the gallbladder to release its contents. Nevertheless, it is not essential for life.
Clinical Note
Cholecystectomy is a common operation, following
which bile is discharged into the duodenum at a
constant, slow rate which allows the digestion of
moderate amounts of fat in the diet.

Concentration of bile
The gallbladder stores bile secreted by the liver and has a
capacity of about 35 mL.
The stored bile is 5–20 times more concentrated
than that secreted by the liver, principally because of
the active transport of Naþ from the gallbladder

Fig. 7.14 The mechanism by which
bile is concentrated in the gall bladder.
The epithelial cells in the gall bladder
mucosa have large lateral intercellular
spaces near the basement membrane
and tight junctions at the apices. Naþ
ions are coupled with Cl– ions and
actively transported into the
intercellular spaces. Water passively
diffuses into the spaces as it follows
the osmotic gradient set up by the
active transport of ions.

Gallbladder emptying begins several minutes after the
start of a meal.
During the cephalic phase, the taste and smell
of food and the presence of food in the mouth and pharynx cause impulses in branches of the vagus nerve that
increase emptying of the gallbladder.
The highest rate of emptying of the gallbladder
occurs during the intestinal phase, mostly in response
to cholecystokinin released from the duodenal mucosa
as a result of the presence of the products of fat digestion
and essential amino acids in the duodenum.
Cholecystokinin enters the circulation and reaches
the gallbladder, where it causes strong contractions of
the smooth muscle of the wall and relaxation of the
sphincter of Oddi.
Gastrin, which has the same sequence of amino acid
residues as cholecystokinin at its C-terminal, may
also cause contractions of the gallbladder during the
cephalic and gastric phases.

Disorders of the gallbladder and biliary tract

DISORDERS OF THE
GALLBLADDER AND BILIARY
TRACT

Congenital abnormalities
Anomalies of the biliary tree are characterized by changes
in the architecture of the biliary tree within the liver.
In normal development, embryonic bile ducts involute (spiral and roll inwards at the edges). Anomalies
of the biliary tree are thus thought to be caused by
remnants that have not involuted completely.
Anomalies vary in severity. They may be clinically
insignificant or be severe enough to cause hepatosplenomegaly and portal hypertension. They are often
inherited.

Gallstones
Gallstones (cholelithiasis) are a common complaint in
the West. They affect the gallbladder and extrahepatic
bile ducts.
The incidence of gallstones is twice as high in
women as in men overall. However, it increases with
age in both sexes. Obese people and those with diabetes or haemolysis are also at higher risk of getting
gallstones.

Clinical features
Eighty per cent of patients with gallstones are asymptomatic. These remain in the gallbladder, but stones
which impact in the neck of the cystic duct can cause
biliary pain and acute cholecystitis.
If gallstones impact in the common bile duct, this
can lead to obstruction of bile and cause pain and cholestatic jaundice. This sometimes gives rise to bacterial
infections resulting in cholangitis.
If they impact in the gallbladder, either at the
neck or in the cystic duct, the bile which is unable to
escape becomes concentrated and produces a chemical
cholecystitis. The bile may also become infected,
resulting in acute cholecystitis. However, if the
gallbladder is empty, it will secrete mucus, so that a
mucocele results.
The clinical presentations are summarized in
Fig. 7.15.
Clinical Note
The cardinal feature of acute cholecystitis is pain
in the right upper quadrant, but pain may also be
felt at the epigastric or interscapular regions. This is
because of the innervation of the gallbladder, which is
derived from T5–T9, hence the referral to the
corresponding dermatomes. Additionally, visceral pain
from the gallbladder may also be referred to the right
shoulder tip via C3–C5 if the inflammation irritates the
diaphragm.

Aetiology
Eighty percent of gallstones are composed predominantly of cholesterol. The rest are composed mainly
of bile pigment and calcium (pigment stones). Most
stones contain all three constituents.
A predisposition to cholesterol stones arises in two
situations:
• Increased cholesterol in bile, e.g. due to obesity or
diet
• Decreased amount of bile acids in bile, e.g. due to
malabsorption in cystic fibrosis patients.
Typically, cholesterol stones are large and can be either
single or multiple. In cross-section, cholesterol crystals
are seen radiating from the centre.
Pigment stones are seen when levels of unconjugated bilirubin are abnormally high, e.g. in haemolytic
anaemias such as hereditary spherocytosis or when
enterohepatic recycling of bile is impaired, e.g. in patients who have undergone ileal resections. Another
risk factor is chronic infections of the biliary tract, as
the bacteria act as foci for the formation of pigment
stones. Pigment stones are usually small, black and
fragile.

Treatment
Treatment varies according to the location of the gallstones and how they present, e.g. whether inflammation or a bacterial infection (cholecystitis or ascending
cholangitis) is present.
If infection is present, patients should have blood
cultures taken, and then broad-spectrum antibiotics. Intravenous fluids, analgesia and antiemetics are often
required.

The pancreas and biliary tract
Cholecystectomy (surgical removal of the gallbladder) is often performed laparoscopically, with good effect. If gallstones are only present in the common bile
duct then they can be removed via ERCP.
Cholesterol stones may be dissolved or disrupted by
giving bile acids to increase their solubility in bile. Dissolution of gallstones can take up to 2 years and 50% of
the stones recur. This treatment is rarely used.
The compications are summarized in Fig 7.16.

Disorders associated with biliary
cirrhosis
There are three main diseases in this category: primary
and secondary biliary cirrhosis, and primary sclerosing
cholangitis. These are disorders affecting the intrahepatic
bile ducts which lead to cirrhosis of the liver. They are
normally considered as hepatic diseases and so are
covered in Chapter 6.

Fig. 7.16 Complications of gall stones.
Acute cholecystitis

Neoplastic disease
Cholangiocarcinoma
Cholangiocarcinomas (carcinomas of the bile ducts) are
relatively uncommon, accounting for approximately
10% of all liver tumours.
These mucus-secreting adenocarcinomas cause jaundice and are not associated with the hepatitis B or C viruses, or cirrhosis. They are, however, associated with
inflammatory bowel disease, especially if primary sclerosing cholangitis is present as well.
The prognosis is poor. There is usually no curative
treatment but palliation can be effective for a couple
of years.

Primary adenocarcinoma
of the gallbladder
This occurs mostly in patients over 70 years of age, and
more frequently affects women. It presents with right
hypochondrial pain and nausea, and it is usually palpable. Obstructive jaundice occurs as the disease
progresses.
Cholecystectomy is a possible treatment, but again,
prognosis is poor due to late presentation.

Pancreatitis
Gall stone ileus

Ampullary tumours

Biliary enteric fistula

An adenocarcinoma of the ampulla of Vater is relatively
rare. It presents much earlier than the previous cancers
mentioned, mainly with obstructive jaundice. It can be
diagnosed by ERCP or EUS. The prognosis is good with
a 5-year survival rate of 60% after surgical resection.

COMMON PRESENTATIONS
OF GASTROINTESTINAL
DISEASE
DYSPHAGIA
Dysphagia means having difficulty in swallowing. This
can be caused by simple reflux oesophagitis, but is a
symptom of several conditions, principally obstruction,
stricture, neurological problems or uncoordinated peristalsis as in achalasia (Fig. 8.1). Note it is different from
globus, where a ‘lump in the throat’ is felt in anxiety
states, or odynophagia, which is pain on swallowing.
Important questions to ask in the history include duration of symptoms; is it difficult to make the swallowing movement? Is it difficult to swallow fluids as well as
solids? Is it painful? Does the neck bulge or gurgle when
drinking? Any recent weight loss? Has there been a history of GORD?
Difficulty making the swallowing movement is likely
to be caused by a neurological problem such as a stroke.
The ability to drink liquids, but not to swallow food suggests a stricture, Failure to swallow both fluids and
solids is seen in achalasia. Constant, painful dysphagia
with weight loss is suggestive of a malignancy. Bulging
or gurgling is a symptom of pharyngeal pouch.

DYSPEPSIA
Dyspepsia is a general term encompassing several symptoms which originate in the gastrointestinal tract. These
include heartburn, indigestion and peptic symptoms.
Although most of the time no abnormality is found,
if a patient has ‘alarm symptoms’ they require a rapid
referral for further investigations to exclude serious
gastrointestinal disease. This should be unusual in patients <55 years.
HINTS AND TIPS
The ALARM Symptoms in dyspepsia are:
• Anaemia
• Loss of weight
• Anorexia or vomiting
• Refractory to antisecretory medications
• Melaena
• Swallowing difficulties.

Heartburn is common, especially in developed countries. Pain is felt behind the sternum (retrosternal pain)
that may radiate up towards the throat. It is worse on
lying flat, and can also be exacerbated after drinking alcohol or eating a fatty or spicy meal (Fig. 8.2). It is

important to distinguish this from the retrosternal pain
of a myocardial infarction (typically a central crushing
pain which may radiate to the neck or arm).
Indigestion is used to describe any discomfort experienced after eating or drinking. People will interpret
this differently so it is import to establish exactly what
the patient means by the word (Fig 8.3).

The content of the vomit (either blood or bile), the
frequency and amount all give important diagnostic information. The presence of bile suggests that the lesion
is below the ampulla of Vater.
A thorough history needs to be taken as nausea and
vomiting are non-specific symptoms. You should enquire about associated symptoms, including abdominal
pain, onset relative to food consumption, headache, fever, weight loss, and also take a drug history.

NAUSEA AND VOMITING
Nausea is a feeling that one is about to vomit. It is often
accompanied by hypersalivation, which protects the
mouth against the acid contents of the stomach. A differential diagnosis is shown in Fig 8.4.
Vomiting is the reflex act of ejecting the contents of
the stomach through the mouth. Note it is important
to differentiate true vomiting from regurgitation of
gastric contents.

152

ABDOMINAL DISTENSION
Abdominal distension may be caused by one of the five
Fs (flatus, fluid, fetus, fat or faeces). It is typically caused
by obstruction low in the gastrointestinal tract.
Aetiologies can be split into gaseous causes such as
functional gas, gastric outlet obstruction, small bowel
obstruction, pseudo obstruction and ileus; solid causes

and abscesses. A diagnostic algorithm is given in
Fig 8.5.
In the history it is important to ask about the rate of
onset. A neoplasm, for example will not produce distension as quickly as gas.

ABDOMINAL PAIN
There are several causes of abdominal pain (Fig. 8.6).
Broadly abdominal pain may be classified as one of
the following types: visceral (from organs), parietal
(from the parietal peritoneum), referred or psycogenic.
Accompanying symptoms will give clues to the mechanisms behind the pain.

HINTS AND TIPS
Because of the embryological development of the
gut, pain in a structure that develops from the foregut
may be referred to the epigastric region, that from
midgut structures to the umbilical area and hindgut
structures to the suprapubic area.

Abdominal pain can also be divided into acute and
chronic pain. Diagnostic algorithms are shown in
Figs 8.7 and 8.8.

The acute abdomen
This accounts for about half of urgent general surgical
admissions. Many of the causes are serious and require
prompt intervention, although relatively simple conditions such as constipation are also admitted (Fig 8.9).
Generally the causes of acute abdomen are:
• Inflammation – the pain develops gradually and is
exacerbated by movement
• Obstruction – the pain is colicky as the bowel goes
into spasm trying to move the obstruction
• Perforation of a viscus – severe sudden-onset pain
which needs urgent treatment.
Examination of the abdomen is necessary to determine whether the patient shows signs of peritonitis
(see Chapter 5). If so it needs to be treated as an emergency case with resuscitation and prompt surgical
treatment.

GASTROINTESTINAL (GI)
BLEEDING
Generally bright red blood signifies fresh bleeds, and
dark black blood is from an old bleed.

Upper GI bleeding
Acute upper GI bleeding is the commonest gastrointestinal emergency. Approximately half of all cases are
caused by bleeding from peptic ulcers. Other important
causes are bleeding oesophageal varices, oesophagitis
and gastric erosions.
If bleeding is severe, the haematemesis will be red
with clots; black ‘coffee ground’ haematemesis is usually
less serious. The stools may be tarry and black (melaena), as the blood will have been digested in the gut.
A patient suffering from an acute upper GI bleed may
rapidly deteriorate and go into shock with fatal consequences if the bleeding is severe, hence assessment of
the circulatory status is a key part of management. Intravenous access and fluid resuscitation is a priority. Blood
should be cross-matched for either transfusion or if surgical treatment is needed.
Once the patient is sufficiently resuscitated, endoscopy may be carried out. This is diagnostic in about
80% of cases.

Lower GI bleeding
This is caused by bleeding from the intestine or anus,
and may be acute, subacute or chronic. Patients typically complain of blood on the toilet paper when they
open their bowels.
Subacute or chronic lower GI bleeding is very common. Usually this is due to haemorrhoids or anal fissures.
Nevertheless, in patients over 50 years of age, colonoscopy may be required to rule out colorectal carcinoma.
Severe, acute lower GI bleeding is uncommon. Diverticular disease is the most likely cause.
Fig 8.10 gives an algorithm for the management of GI
bleeding.

WEIGHT LOSS
Any significant, unintentional weight loss within a 6month period needs to be investigated. Gastrointestinal
causes that need to excluded include malignancy, malabsorption, inflammatory bowel disease, dysphagia and
obstruction.
It is important to take a detailed history as there are
many other medical problems associated with weight
loss, These include systemic causes such as malignancy
and tuberculosis, psychiatric causes such as anorexia
nervosa, and endocrine diseases including diabetes mellitus and hyperthyroidism.

156

ANAEMIA
Anaemia is a decreased number of red blood cells in the
blood, when the haemoglobin level drops below normal values. It can be classified by the size of the red
bloods as either microcytic, normocytic or macrocytic.
This can often be picked up on routine blood tests, or
the patent may look pale and feel short of breath.
Anyone over the age of 50 who has iron-deficient
anaemia (microcytic), should be investigated with an
OGD and colonoscopy to exclude colorectal malignancy.

JAUNDICE
Jaundice is characterized by yellow skin and yellow
sclerae, and is caused when plasma bilirubin levels exceed 50 mmol/L. An important question is whether
the urine is dark coloured as this would distinguish

acholuric jaundice (pre-hepatic causes) from conjugated hyperbilirubinaemias (hepatic and post-hepatic
causes).
The mechanisms by which the levels may become elevated, and the classification of jaundice are described
in Chapter 6.

157

Clinical assessment of gastrointestinal disease

DIARRHOEA AND CONSTIPATION
Diarrhoea refers to excess frequency of bowel movements with stools more liquid than usual. Severe
diarrhoea can cause electrolyte disturbances and is a
major cause of mortality in children worldwide.
Acute cases are usually due to infections or dietary indiscretion, whereas chronic diarrhoea often has more
serious causes (Fig. 8.11). An algorithm for the management of acute diarrhoea is shown in Fig. 8.12.
Constipation is a subjective complaint. Some people
believe they must open their bowels at least once a day,
but in fact anything from once every three days, to three
times daily is within the normal range. Consequently it
is important to ask in the history, ‘What frequency is
normal for you?’

Serious causes of constipation such as obstruction
need urgent treatment (Fig. 8.13); however, in the the
absence of other symptoms a high-fibre diet may improve symptoms.

ANAL MASS
Patients with an anal mass will often complain of tenesmus (an uncomfortable feeling that something is still
there after they have defecated).
The commonest causes are haemorrhoids (varices),
hypertrophied anal papillae, rectal prolapsed, condylomata acuminata (anal warts), faecal impactation and
neoplasia. The most important thing is to exclude is a
malignancy.
Anal papillae may hypertrophy in response to
chronic irritation or inflammation. Rectal prolapse occurs where the tone of the sphincter is reduced and
the pelvic floor weakened. It may be a late complication
of multiple childbirth. Neoplasms include squamous
cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma, Bowen’s disease
and basal cell carcinoma.
A rectal examination is essential to investigate an
anal mass, followed by proctoscopy.

FAECAL INCONTINENCE
This may be of faeces or of flatus.
Structural changes such as the loss of angle at the rectum and anus (which contributes to faecal continence),
neuromuscular and neurological lesions may all lead to
incontinence.

HISTORY AND EXAMINATION
INTRODUCTION
These are the core clinical skills that you will need as a
medical student, so it is worth taking the time to learn
how to do them properly. Use this section as a guide,
but remember that there is no substitute for practice!

HISTORY-TAKING
Most diagnoses are made on the history alone – if not, it
should allow you to come up with a list of differential
diagnoses. In most cases, the examination and investigations should confirm the diagnosis or exclude the
differentials.
Remember, the patient has far more information
about his or her condition than you do. Introduce yourself, be polite, listen carefully and look interested. Give

the patient the time and opportunity to tell you what
you need to know, and put him or her at ease. Many
symptoms are embarrassing.
Watch the patient carefully. How ill does the patient
look? Are they agitated or distressed? Is he or she in
pain? Can you notice any tremors? Has the patient lost
a lot of weight (cachexia)? Look around the bedside for
clues, such as inhalers, oxygen, a walking stick or frame,
sputum pots, special food preparations etc.

THE STRUCTURE OF A HISTORY
When recording a history, use the headings below. You
are less likely to leave things out if your history is structured. It is also easier for others to find the information
they need quickly when looking at your notes.
Remember, patients notes are a legal document. They
should have the patients name on it, along with other

identification such as hospital number or date of birth.
Make sure that you include all the details discussed, date
the entry, and sign your name legibly.

The presenting complaint (PC)
This should be brief - a sentence stating the symptoms,
not the diagnosis. For example write ‘abdominal pain’,
not ‘appendicitis’. Ideally you should use the patient’s
own words.
If the patient has a number of problems (not uncommon in the elderly) ask them to state the main ones first.

The history of the presenting
complaint (HPC)
This is essentially a complete description of the presenting complaint.

It is usually good to start off with:
• How and when the symptoms started
• The speed of onset: was it rapid, or slow and insidious?
• The pattern of symptoms, their duration and frequency. Are they continuous or intermittent? How
often do they appear?
If the complaint appears to be gastrointestinal, you
should always ask about the following:
•
•
•
•
•

Weight loss or gain, and appetite
Dysphagia
Nausea and vomiting
‘Indigestion’ or ‘heartburn’

treat

• Change in bowel habit – a deviation from what
is normal for the patient is the key point, not the absolute number of times they open their bowels
• Change in the nature of stools: ask about stool colour and consistency, pressure of mucus or blood. If
blood is present, was it fresh blood?

Pain
If pain is present, use the mnemonic SOCRATES as a
guide to the questions which need to be asked:
• Site: where about is the pain?
• Onset: you should ask what the patient was doing
at the time, and whether the onset was acute or

gradual. Ask whether there is any relationship
to food
Character: sharp, dull, shooting, crushing (like a
band around the chest), stabbing, colicky, etc.
Radiation
Associated factors: nausea, vomiting, sweating, diarrhoea, migraine, etc.
Timing: duration, number of episodes
Exacerbating and relieving factors: lying down, sitting up, food, movement etc.
If movement exacerbates the pain, peritoneum is likely
to be involved; if the patient is rolling around, the pain
is likely to be visceral colic, e.g. intestinal spasm
Severity: this should be graded out of 10, with 10 being the most severe.

Additionally you should ask:
• If the patient has had it before. If yes, is it the same
kind of pain?
• What happened last time? Did he or she have any
treatment or investigations, or did it go away by itself? If treatment was given, was it effective?

Past medical history (PMH)
Has the patient had any other medical problems? This
question often needs persistence. It is amazing how
many people forget operations, spells in hospital, or
visits to the GP! Ask what previous investigations have
been carried out and their results.
It is also good practice to ask whether the patient has
had any of the following: myocardial infarct, thyroid
disease, asthma, tuberculosis, rheumatic fever, diabetes
mellitus and epilepsy.

If any first-degree relatives are deceased, also ask
about the cause of death, and at what age they died.
Practise drawing quick sketches of family trees. Make
a note on the family tree of any diseases that relatives
may have had, to help you notice trends.

Social history (SH)
This is to useful to gain some insight into the patient’s
life; how their illness is affecting the patient, what support they have or need at home, and whether he or she
can reduce any health risks.
It should include information about the patient’s:
• Marital or cohabitation status
• Children and other dependants
• Occupational history: this is especially relevant with
regard to toxin/chemical exposure and musculoskeletal disorders
• Accommodation: assess whether the patient will be
able to cope at home, e.g. getting upstairs
• Activities of daily living: can they manage cooking,
cleaning, washing themselves and other essential
tasks? If not, do they get any help?
• Smoking: is it cigarettes, cigars or a pipe that the
patient smokes? How many cigarettes do they
smoke per day, and for how long have they been
smoking?
• Alcohol: what type of alcoholic beverages do
they drink, and how much per week? You should calculate weekly consumption using units (Fig. 8.14),
but remember that patients often underestimate
their drinking
• Diet: Is it adequate? High cholesterol? Vegetarian?
• Exercise.

Drug history (DH)
Ask about all drugs, including over-the-counter medicines and the contraceptive pill, as well as medications
which have been prescribed. If the patient is an in-patient
you should check their drug chart. If appropriate, you
could ask whether the patient actually took the prescribed medication, if non-compliance is suspected.
You should always ask about allergies (i.e. type 1 hypersensitivity reactions which may result in anaphylaxis)
in this section. It is important to ask what the allergic reaction was, as sometimes patients have just experienced a
normal side effect, e.g. diarrhoea after taking penicillin. It
is important to establish whether they are really allergic,
as you may be denying them the best treatment, but do
not give them anything they say they are allergic to unless
you are absolutely sure they are not.

Family history (FH)
Ask whether any diseases run in the family, specifically if
first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) are affected.

Review of systems (RoS)
Briefly go through all the systems of the body (Fig. 8.15)
and ask specifically whether the patient has experienced
any symptoms relating to them.

Presenting the history
You may be asked to present your history, for example
on a ward round. This should be a short concise summary recapping the most important features. For
example:
‘Reginald Smith, a 69-year-old male presented with
dysphagia. This started about 3 months ago and has
become progressively worse, initially only with solids
but now with liquids and he has lost 2 kg in weight. He
is otherwise fit and well. His father died of cancer of
the stomach at the age of 50. He has smoked 30
cigarettes a day since his early 20s, but does not drink.’

GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM
EXAMINATION
Most clinical examinations comprise inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. Not all examinations will require all four components but it is useful
to keep to this sequence so you do not leave any part
undone. Before zooming in on the abdomen, there
are a few other steps to the gastrointestinal system
examination.

General inspection
The main purpose of a general inspection is to determine how unwell the patient is (Fig. 8.16). It may also
enable you to pick up some clues.
Look at the patient’s facial expression. Is he or she
comfortable; or in obvious distress? If the patient is very
ill, do not waste valuable time asking questions that can
wait until later.
Many diseases and conditions do not have a direct
effect on the gastrointestinal system. However, always

remember that the patient may be receiving medication
for a pre-existing condition, which may affect the
dose of drug you are intending to give for his or her
gut condition, e.g. he or she may already be receiving
enzyme-inducing drugs for another condition. Current
medication might even be producing his or her gut
symptoms, e.g. diarrhoea caused by antibiotic therapy.

Inspection of the hands
and limbs
Physical examination of the patient should start with an
inspection of the hands. This is relatively non-invasive
and allows the patient to get used to your touch. It also
gives you a lot of information (Figs 8.17 and 8.18).
When examining a patient, be methodical. Examine
the hands and then work your way up the arm to the
head and neck. Possible signs on limb examination
are listed in Fig. 8.19.

Examination of the head
and neck
Face, scalp and eyes
You need to pull down the lower eyelid to take a look at
the sclerae for pallor (do not say anaemia— this is a

164

haematological finding) or jaundice. This may be uncomfortable, so always warn a patient beforehand.
Remember, however, that jaundice is not clinically detectable unless serum bilirubin levels reach 50 mmol/L
(twice the normal value).
Examination of the head and face is covered in
Fig. 8.20.

Mouth
Use a pen torch to inspect the inside of the mouth. Ask
the patient to stick their tongue out and then let you
look under it. This will tell you if the patient is dehydrated or cyanotic (Fig. 8.21). Also inspect carefully
for any mouth ulcers.
Wear gloves if you need to feel anything in the mouth
and ask the patient to remove any false teeth.

Examination of the abdomen
As mentioned earlier, follow the sequence inspection,
palpation, percussion and auscultation.

Inspection
The abdomen should be examined from the nipples to
the knees, but not all at once. Respect the patient’s
dignity and only uncover as much as you need to at
any one time.
Ask the patient to remove their clothes and lie flat on
the bed or the couch, with the head on one pillow and
arms by the sides. Cover the patient with a folded sheet
or blanket. It is easy to move this up or down, exposing
or revealing different parts, as you complete your
examination.
Stand at the end of the bed to look at the abdomen as
a whole before going nearer and taking a closer look.
Look out for the following:

Palpation
Make sure your hands are warm and tell the patient that
you are about to feel their abdomen.
Before you do so, ask whether the abdomen is tender anywhere. If it is, then start your palpation as far
away from the tender area as possible. Start with light
palpation before pressing more deeply and always
ask the patient to tell you if he or she feels anything.
Most people will understandably tense their abdominal muscles if they think you are about to cause
them pain.
Additionally, never take your eyes off the patient’s
face while you are palpating. You are looking for any

signs of pain or discomfort. Do not hurt the patient —
you will fail exams if you do.
Light palpation of all four quadrants or nine regions
will alert you to any obvious tenderness or peritonism—
this is all you want to gain from it.
Patients with a tender abdomen are naturally apprehensive about having them palpated. However, when
you have been around the quadrants once without hurting them they will often relax the abdominal muscles
enough to let you palpate more deeply.
During deep palpation, you should be looking for:

4

6

• Tenderness on deep palpation only
• Guarding (tensing of the abdominal muscles)
• Rovsing’s sign (more pain in the right iliac fossa than
in the left iliac fossa, when palpated)
• Obvious masses.
HINTS AND TIPS
To describe any lump in the body, remember the six
Ss – site, size, shape, surface, smoothness (as well as
consistency and fluctuance) and surroundings, i.e.
whether it is tethered or not.

Following general deep palpation, you will need to
palpate for any enlarged abdominal organs (organomegaly). You should attempt to feel the liver, spleen and
kidneys.

Palpating the liver
To examine the liver, start at the right iliac fossa and
move your hand up, using the long, flat edge of your index finger to feel for the liver edge. The normal position
of the liver is shown in Fig. 8.24.
Its edge can usually be felt just below the edge of the
costal margin. You need to palpate quite deeply to feel
it. Ask the patient to take deep breaths in and out; the
edge should be felt moving against your fingers with
respiration.
If you can feel the liver edge, make a note of what it
feels like and how many centimetres you can feel. Is it
smooth (possible hepatitis) or hard and craggy (tumours)? Remember that cirrhotic livers may not be felt
as they often shrink. Some patients may have a palpable
extension (Riedel’s lobe) to the right lobe which is entirely normal.

Palpating the spleen
To examine the spleen, start in the right iliac fossa and
move up diagonally to the left costal margin. A grossly
enlarged spleen can extend into the right iliac fossa. A
normal spleen cannot be felt.

168

Fig. 8.24 The position of the normal liver in relation to the
nipple line and to the 4th, 5th and 6th ribs.

A distinguishing feature of the spleen is its notch,
which may be palpable in splenomegaly. Additionally,
if you can feel an upper margin, you are not feeling the
spleen, as you cannot get ‘above’ it.

Palpating the kidneys
The kidneys should be ‘balloted’, using two hands. This
is the procedure of bouncing the kidney between the
hand at the renal angle and the hand positioned anteriorly to this.
Normally they should not be able to be felt. Enlarged,
tender kidneys may indicate infection. Fig. 8.25 lists the
signs elicitable on abdominal palpation.

Percussion
The abdomen is not routinely percussed. It is usually
done if there is a suspicion of ascites or when confirmation of hepato- or splenomegaly is needed.
The liver and spleen are dull to percussion. You
can trace their margins (and confirm organomegaly)
by percussing in the directions you palpated when
examining them both. Always percuss for the upper border of the liver as well as the lower one. The liver may be
pushed down by a hyperinflated chest or other respiratory pathology. Hepatomegaly may be wrongly diagnosed if the upper border has not been located.
If a patient has ascites, there will be shifting dullness.
This is when a patient lies on their back, and on percussion
the flanks are dull, and the midline is resonant. Get the patient to roll on their side, and this time on percussion the

upper flank is resonant, and the lower flank is dull. Note
that it takes a minute or two for the fluid to drain.

Auscultation
You should listen for bowel sounds. There should
be some and they should not be too loud. Absent bowel sounds suggest paralytic ileus, while tinkling
bowel sounds suggest intestinal obstruction. Listen
also for bruits (evidence of disturbed blood flow).

Examination of the rectum
and external genitalia
These are considered part of a complete abdominal examination, although for obvious reasons you will not
be asked to do them in examination situations. You
should always finish by saying you would perform them.

Rectal examination
Many patients find rectal examinations distressing and
embarrassing. It is therefore essential to take the time
to explain what the examination entails, why it is being
done and gain verbal consent. Ensure you have a chaperone present and always wear gloves, ensuring your examining finger is well lubricated.
To perform a rectal examination, ask the patient to lie
on his or her left side with the knees drawn up. Inspect
the anus for redness, bleeding, external haemorrhoids,
skin lesions or fistulae. Before you begin, ask the patient
if there is any tenderness and ask them to tell you if they
feel any pain during the examination.
Gently insert a well-lubricated index finger into the
anal canal and rectum. Note the tone of the anal

sphincter. Gently sweep your finger around the walls
to check for any masses or abnormalities. You should
be able to feel the prostate in the male and cervix in
the female through the anterior wall of the rectum.
The prostate has a shallow central groove.
Withdraw your finger: there should be faecal matter
on it but no blood or mucus. Take your glove off cufffirst, pulling the glove off inside out, and dispose of it
in a clinical waste bag. Possible abnormal findings are
listed in Fig. 8.26.

Genital examination
You should be looking for any signs of infection, gross
abnormality and hernias.
It is best to look for hernias with the patient
standing and you crouching down so that you are
at the same level as the area you are examining. Many
hernias disappear if the patient lies down. Hernias
are common. About 1 in 100 people will have a hernia
at some time in their life. About 70% of hernias are
inguinal, 20% are femoral and 10% are umbilical.
Palpate over the external and internal rings (above and
medial to the pubic tubercle) to detect an inguinal hernia
and ask the patient to cough. You may feel a lump when
he or she does. Repeat this procedure below and lateral to
the pubic tubercle to check for a femoral hernia, and
above and below the umbilicus for an umbilical hernia.
Try to reduce any swelling. The femoral pulse and
lymph nodes in the groin should be palpated.
In the male, inspect the penis and scrotum, carefully
palpating the testes, epididymis and spermatic cords.
Note any scrotal swelling.

An examination should also ideally include checking
the feet and legs for pitting oedema. This can give clues
about respiratory, cardiac or hepatic function.
Urinalysis should also be performed.

INVESTIGATIONS AND IMAGING

ROUTINE HAEMOTOLOGICAL
AND BIOCHEMICAL
INVESTIGATIONS
A number of simple blood tests are available to confirm
(or disprove) diagnoses arrived at from the history and
examination.
The results below are particularly relevant to gastrointestinal disease; other texts in the Crash Course series
should be consulted for other systems.

Haematological tests
OVERVIEW
Investigations are part of patient management, and so a
good working knowledge of common tests is essential.
However, it is worthwhile remembering that 80% of the
diagnosis comes from the history and the remainder
from the examination and investigations, so investigations cannot replace clinical skill!
Before requesting investigations, a list of differential diagnoses should have been made. The tests ordered should be relevant to the possible diagnoses,
as unnecessary or inappropriate tests waste time and
resources.
HINTS AND TIPS
Clinical history taking and examination should always
take precedence over investigations. Remember the
main function of tests is to confirm or exclude a
provisional diagnosis.

170

These, and their results, are described in Fig. 8.27.

Biochemical tests
Liver function tests (LFTs) are one of the most commonly requested biochemical investigations, and not
always because a hepatic cause of disease is suspected—
for example, they are also useful when assessing liver
function before a certain drug is prescribed. They are
discussed in detail below; other biochemical tests concerning the gastrointestinal system are summarized in
Fig. 8.28.
The functions of the liver are described in Chapter 6
(see Fig. 6.10). Liver ‘function’ can be assessed by measurement of serum levels of albumin, bilirubin, urea,
glucose and prothrombin time.
Included in the term LFTs are the liver enzymes, i.e.
aminotransferases (AST and ALT), alkaline phosphatase
and g-glutamyltransferase (see below). Although these
actually give no information about liver function, raised
serum levels reflect some degree of damage to the liver.

Prothrombin time
Prothrombin time is a functional test measuring the interaction between a cascade of clotting factors, all of
which are made in the liver. Therefore, if any one of

these is abnormal or deficient, the prothrobin time will
be prolonged, making it a very sensitive test of synthetic
liver function.
Prothrombin time is also increased in vitamin K deficiency as this fat-soluble vitamin is required for activation of factors II, VII, IX and X.
Jaundice due to obstruction will impair absorption
of vitamin K so prolonged prothrombin time in obstructive jaundice can be corrected by giving vitamin
K. However, in the presence of hepatocellular damage,
where synthesis of other clotting factors is affected, vitamin K administration will have no effect.

Hepatic enzyme assays
Aminotransferases (transaminases) are enzymes present in
hepatocytes which leak into the plasma in liver cell
damage.
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is present in the cytoplasm of hepatocytes and its level increases in hepatocellular injury. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) is a
mitochondrial enzyme present not only in the liver
but also in cardiac muscle, the kidneys and the brain.
Because of this it is less specific than ALT, as conditions
affecting these other organs, e.g. myocardial infarction,
muscle injury and congestive heart failure, will also
cause it to rise.
Alkaline phosphatase is an isoenzyme present in the
canalicular and sinusoidal membranes of the liver. It
is also present in bone (it is produced by osteoblasts),
and less importantly in the intestine and placenta.

Clinical assessment of gastrointestinal disease
Levels rise following damage to any of these structures, but in practice a commensurate rise in gglutamyltransferase is usually taken to indicate hepatic
origin. Hepatic alkaline phosphatase is raised in infiltration of the liver, cirrhosis and cholestasis (from both
intrahepatic and extrahepatic causes). The highest levels
are seen in hepatic metastases and primary biliary
cirrhosis.
g-Glutamyltransferase (g-GT) is an enzyme present in
the mitochondria of many tissues, including the liver. If
g-GT is raised but alkaline phosphatase levels are normal, the cause of the damage is probably alcohol. If
both g-GT and alkaline phosphatase are high, the cause
may be cholestasis or intrahepatic malignancy. If the alkaline phosphatase is raised, but the g-GT is normal,
then one should suspect bone disease, e.g. Paget’s disease, or pregnancy.
When interpreting the results of liver enzyme assays,
patterns of abnormality are important in diagnosis
(Fig. 8.29):
• Predominantly raised levels of AST and ALT reflect
hepatocellular damage
• Predominantly raised alkaline phosphatase and gGT indicate cholestasis or intrahepatic abscess and
malignancy.

Liver screen
As there are many causes of liver failure it is sometimes useful to carry out a number of other tests especially if the standard LFTs are deranged. These are shown in Fig. 8.30.

Histology and cytology
Histology is the study of tissue samples taken by biopsy
or following surgical removal. The sample may be
examined using light microscopy or electron microscopy.
Histological examination is useful in cases of malignancy, or in diseases where there are structural changes,
e.g. Crohn’s disease.
Cytology is the study of cell samples taken by means
of swabs or fine-needle aspiration. The cells are stained
and examined under a microscope to detect the presence
of abnormal, e.g. neoplastic, and inflammatory cells.

Microbiology
Medical microbiology is the study of microorganisms
and their effects on humans. Bacteria, viruses, fungi
and parasites can cause disease. A typical request to
the microbiology laboratory would be for microscopy,
culture and (antibiotic) sensitivity. In gastrointestinal
disease, samples for microbiological investigation include raw stools and swabs.
Many bacteria, fungi and parasites can be identified
using light microscopy, but viruses are too small so
other methods such as electron microscopy or serological testing must be employed for their detection. Gram
staining of microscopic samples is particularly useful, as
it classifies bacteria as being either Gram-positive or
Gram-negative, allowing provisional identification.
Culture is a slower method of identification. Some
bacteria require certain types of culture medium to
grow. It is also useful in deciding which antibiotic is
most effective against a particular organism.
A simple sensitivity test involves smearing samples
on an agar plate, placing antibiotic discs onto the plate
and then incubating it. Small patches of agar on which
no bacteria have grown can be seen around those antibiotics that are most effective against the bacteria in
question. Other, more sophisticated sensitivity tests
are available but are not within the scope of this book.

Breath tests
The general principle of a breath test is that if an enzyme
which catalyses a reaction causing the production of
gases such as hydrogen or CO2 is present in the gut lumen, then giving the patient the relevant substrate will
cause the gas to be detectable in the patient’s breath
(Fig. 8.31).This is because the gas is absorbed by diffusion and then exhaled via the lungs.

Routine haemotological and biochemical investigations

Clinical significance

a1-antitrypsin

Deficiency of a1-antitrypsin can produce cirrhosis.

a-fetoprotein

This is raised in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and in pregnant women. Less elevated
levels are found in hepatitis, teratoma and chronic liver disease.

Ferritin

In haemochromatosis, the serum ferritin will be raised due to the increased serum iron, as will
transferrin saturation levels. It is most commonly raised in diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver
disease or arthritis but levels > 1000 ng/ml need to be investigated further.

Caeruloplasmin

This is relevant if Wilson’s disease is suspected. Patients will have low levels of the protein,
although occasionally there is no apparent abnormality. Note that any cause of advanced
liver failure may cause low caeruloplasmin.

24-hour urinary
copper

As with caeruloplasmin, this aids in the diagnosis of Wilson’s disease. The urinary excretion
rate of copper will be raised.

Viral hepatitis serology

This is useful to screen for an infective cause. The presence of anti-viral IgM

for hepatitis A, B and C

suggests an acute infection, while the presence of IgG suggests immunity due to past

viruses

infection or vaccination.

Autoantibody screen

Certain diseases are associated with particular autoantibodies, for example autoimmune
hepatitis (anti-smooth muscle and anti-nuclear in type I; anti-liver-kidney-microsomal in type
II), primary biliary sclerosis (anti-mitochondrial) and primary sclerosing cholangitis
(perinuclear anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, p-ANCA).

Glucose, lipids and
HbA1c.

To screen for metabolic diseases, e.g. diabetes mellitus which may have symptoms
common to liver disease. For instance, acute liver failure can cause hypoglycaemia.

An example of this is the hydrogen breath test, which
can be performed after giving the patient a lactulose solution to drink. This can detect an overgrowth of bacteria if

*CO2

*urea

there are more than 20 parts per million of hydrogen gas in
less than 2 hours. Normally, breath hydrogen is undetectable, hence raised levels suggest bacterial hydrolysis. In a
similar way, lactase deficiency can be detected by giving a
lactose drink.
A urea breath test can be performed to confirm the
presence of Helicobacter pylori in the stomach. This uses
14 C-urea or 13 C-urea isotopes. The H. pylori urease enzyme converts the urea to ammonia and radiolabelled
CO2, which is collected in a breath sample. It is a good
non-invasive investigation.

Oesophageal manometry measures pressure changes in
different parts of the oesophagus and is used to investigate suspected motility disorders.
A fluid-filled continuously perfused catheter is
passed through the nose into the oesophagus, in much
the same way as a nasogastric tube. Contraction of the
oesophagus causes a pressure change that is transmitted
up the fluid column and recorded as a trace.
In normal individuals, a pressure wave should pass
down the oesophagus to the lower oesophageal sphincter, which then relaxes to allow the oesophageal contents to pass into the stomach. Abnormal traces are
seen in motility disorders, e.g. achalasia.

173

Clinical assessment of gastrointestinal disease

Investigation of gastric function
Refluxed acid may overwhelm the normal protective
lining of the oesophagus, leading to ulceration. Suspected reflux may be investigated by measuring the
pH in the lower oesophagus over the course of 24 hours
with a pH-sensitive probe.
A normal trace shows a pH above 4 for most of the
time—if the pH is below 4 for more than 4% of the time
significant reflux is said to have occurred.
Disorders of gastric acid secretion may be investigated using the pentagastrin test. The patient
fasts overnight and the resting juice in the stomach
is aspirated using a nasogastric tube. Pentagastrin,
a synthetic analogue of gastrin, is then given
(6 mg/kg body weight) to stimulate acid secretion,
and gastric contents are again aspirated for 1 hour
and analysed.
Generally, a large volume of resting juice suggests
gastric stasis, a high acid secretion suggests Zollinger–
Ellison syndrome and a failure to stimulate acid
secretion with pentagastrin indicates achlorhydria.
Plasma levels of gastrin (a hormone which stimulates
gastric acid secretion and growth of the gastric mucosa)
may also be measured.The levels of gastrin will be high
in the Zollinger–Ellison syndrome as G cells in the pancreas, duodenum or, more rarely, the stomach, secrete
large amounts of gastrin in this disorder and cause hyperacidity, leading to ulceration.

ENDOSCOPIC EXAMINATIONS
Endoscopy gives valuable information about the gastrointestinal tract. It allows visualization of the interior of
the alimentary tract on a monitor.
Endoscopy can also be used therapeutically for the
following:
• Removal of submucosal lesions or polyps (polypectomy, sub-mucosal resection)
• Control of bleeding, e.g. variceal banding or
diathermy
• Relief of strictures, e.g. with stents
• Treatment of tumours, e.g. with lasers
• Gallstones in the bile duct (retrieval or
sphincterotomy).

Gastroscopy
(oesophagogastroduodenoscopy –
OGD)
In this procedure, the patient is laid on the left side and
the endoscope is passed down the oesophagus. Patients

174

must fast overnight beforehand and the endoscopy is
performed as a day-case procedure.
Some patients are given mild sedation (which can
cause slight amnesia), but many manage with just an
oral local anaesthetic spray.
Gastroscopy is commonly used to investigate upper
gastrointestinal disorders. Forceps for taking biopsies
can be passed through the biopsy channel of the
endoscope.

Clinical Note
Gastroscopy should not be performed in patients
with upper gastrointestinal bleeding until the
haemorrhage is controlled, and the patient is stabilised
as the procedure can increase the severity of the
haemorrhage.

Colonoscopy, sigmoidoscopy
and proctoscopy
Proctoscopy is commonly performed in out-patients
and involves the use of a proctoscope, a rigid tube with
a detachable, disposable end that is used for one patient
only and then removed and thrown away. Before the
proctoscope is used, an obturator is inserted into its lumen to avoid the discomfort of inserting a hollow tube
into the patient’s anal canal and the end of the instrument is well lubricated.
The patient is then asked to lie on the left side with
knees drawn up to the chest; the proctoscope is gently
inserted; the obturator is removed; and air is pumped
in through the proctoscope to inflate the rectum. It is
kinder to explain to the patient that any associated noise
is caused by the air being pumped in, otherwise they
may think it is caused by flatulence and become very
embarrassed!
Proctoscopy gives valuable information about the
anal canal and rectum but, because the instrument is
rigid, it cannot be used to visualize structures above
the flexure.
The fibre sigmoidoscope and colonoscope are
both flexible instruments, with the former being
shorter. The colonoscope will allow inspection of
the entire large bowel, but the sigmoidoscope gives information only on the anal canal, rectum and sigmoid
colon.
The procedure in sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy is
similar to proctoscopy. However, bowel preparation,
e.g. with sodium picosulphate to clear out the bowel,
is required prior to colonoscopy. Patients are given analgesia and may be sedated for the procedure.

8

Imaging of the gastrointestinal system
Clinical Note
Always perform a digital rectal examination before
proctosigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. The patient may
have a large tumour in the anal canal or rectum and
damage may be caused if a scope is inserted without
checking first.

Endoscopic ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is a relatively new procedure in which an ultrasound image is obtained while
performing an endoscopy. It is used to view the ampulla
of Vater, as well as the GI tract and the pancreas. The
ultrasound transducer is incorporated into the end of
the endoscope to produce images alongside the camera
image (Fig. 8.32).

Endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
(ERCP) involves injection of contrast material into
the biliary and pancreatic systems, via endoscopy,
followed by radiological screening (Fig. 8.33).
Diathermy instruments and grasping forceps can be
passed through the endoscope and used to remove
stones in the common bile duct after the sphincter of
Oddi has been incised (sphincterotomy). Obstructions
in the biliary tree can also be relieved using a stent.

ERCP may introduce infection leading to cholangitis
and prophylactic antibiotics are usually given. Pancreatitis may also occur.
Nowadays, EUS or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP – see below) is used for
diagnosis and ERCP is reserved for therapeutic
purposes only.

IMAGING OF THE
GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM

Plain radiography and contrast
technique
Substances absorb X-rays to different extents, depending on their atomic number. Those that absorb most appear white, e.g. bone, while those that absorb least, e.g.
air, appear black.
Borders are seen only at the interfaces between different
densities, e.g. the interface between the wall of the stomach
and the gastric air bubble, but may be enhanced by the
introduction of contrast media, for example, barium.
When commenting on any X-ray, always follow the
same order. Do not come straight out with a diagnosis,
evident though it may be!
1. Check that the film has been taken properly and the
information recorded on it:
• Look at the name and the date. Is it the correct
patient and the X-ray you want to examine?
• Is it an AP (anteroposterior) or PA (posteroanterior) film?

• Check the alignment of the spine (or the clavicles
on a chest X-ray). Was the patient straight when it
was taken? If not, organs may be displaced and
look abnormal, even if they are not
2. Check the outlines of all the structures you would
expect to see on a normal X-ray. Are they all visible?
Can you see anything you would not normally expect? Is any area more (or less) opaque than normal?
3. Describe the gross pathology that might have caused
these abnormalities, e.g. stricture in the oesophagus,
rose-thorn ulcers in the ileum
4. Suggest the most probable diagnosis and some differential diagnoses.

Abdominal radiographs
Abdominal films may be taken with the patient supine
(best for seeing the distribution of gas) or erect (better
for spotting air under the diaphragm and for seeing
fluid levels).
The intestines are lower down in erect X-rays than in
the supine position. Before X-rays became available
doctors had seen intestines only in supine bodies at dissections and operations and a number of unfortunate
people had completely unnecessary operations to hitch
up their guts when erect abdominal X-rays were first
taken! Look at the pattern of gas (central in ascites, displaced to the left lower quadrant in splenomegaly).
Extraluminal gas in the liver or biliary system suggests

176

a gas-forming infection or the passing of a stone.
In the colonic wall it suggests infective colitis.
Important causes of air under the diaphragm are:
• Perforation of the bowel – this is an emergency and
should not be missed
• A section of intestine lying between the liver and the
diaphragm
• A gas-forming infection
• A pleuro-peritoneal fistula (tuberculosis, trauma or
carcinoma), following surgery or laparoscopy.
Look for opaque areas of calcification, commonly
caused by stones (although only 10% of gallstones are
radio-opaque), pancreatitis or atherosclerosis.
Fig. 8.34 shows the structures normally visible on
plain abdominal X-ray.

Contrast radiographs
These may be single (barium only) or double contrast
(e.g. air and barium). Double-contrast films give a better picture of surface mucosa.
Barium may be administered orally and different parts
of the gastrointestinal tract can be visualized using this
technique depending on the delay before taking the Xray. A barium enema is often used to visualize the lower
gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 8.35). Barium investigations
have largely been replaced by contrast CT and endoscopy.

Computerized tomography
Computerized tomography (CT) scanners produce
computerized images of the body in a series of slices,
based on the amount of X-rays absorbed by different tissues at different angles (Fig. 8.36). They are more effective for imaging soft tissues (including tumours) than
radiography, and the level of radiation is generally
lower. CT scans may be plain or contrast; contrast is
often used to delineate the bowel.

Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners are large
electrical coils that align the nuclei of hydrogen atoms
in the body so that they lie parallel to each other (normally they lie in random directions).
The nuclei are then temporarily knocked out of
alignment by radio pulses and they emit radio signals
as they fall back into alignment. These signals are analysed to produce sliced images of the body, similar to
CT scans.
MRI scans are often preferred in pregnancy as they do
not use radiation, but they can interfere with pacemakers, hearing aids and other electrical devices.
Clinical Note
In many cases, CT is preferred over MRI, as it is faster,
exposes the patient to lower levels of radiation and
costs less.

disease showing narrowing and distortion of the terminal ileum.

Angiography
Angiography is a form of contrast imaging used to
visualize blood vessels. It may show the site of gastrointestinal bleeding (although endoscopy is often the

As its name suggests, MRCP (magnetic resonance
cholangio-pancreatography) uses a large magnet
surrounding the body to detect differences in the electromagnetic characteristics of different body components or fluids. The signals obtained are compiled
by computer graphics into very detailed anatomical
images which can be used to visualize the common
bile duct and pancreatic duct. However, because it is
not invasive it cannot be used for therapeutic
purposes.
Another related, but also not endoscopic, investigation is percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography,
which is an interventional radiological technique.
While it can be used for therapeutic interventions, it
does not allow the visualization of the ampulla of Vater
or pancreatic duct.

Radioisotope scanning
Radioisotope scanning is used to study the uptake of
isotopes by various organs.
Different isotopes are taken up by different organs
and structures. ‘Hot’ lesions are those which take up
more isotope than the surrounding tissue, while ‘cold’
ones take up less.
An example of radioisotope scanning is the use of
technetium (99mTc) colloid to scan the liver and assess
gastric emptying. Another is 99mTc HIDA (hepatic iminodiacetic acid) which is used to scan the biliary tree,
as it is taken up by the liver, cleared to the gall bladder
and excreted in the bile. Liver lesions greater than 2 cm

178

K

in diameter show up as cold spots in scanning with
99m
Tc colloid.

Ultrasonography
Ultrasonography has been used since the 1970s and is
often the investigation of choice for abdominal masses.
Ultrasonographic
machines
emit
very-highfrequency sound waves, which pass readily through
fluids, but are reflected back from acoustic interfaces
such as soft tissue, bone or gas. The reflected echoes
are then analysed to produce images.
Ultrasonographic scans are non-invasive and safe in
pregnancy.

Intentionally left as blank

SBA answers
1. b. Meckel’s diverticulum
Meckel’s diverticulum is the remnant of the
vitelline duct present in embryonic life. It connects the developing embryo with the yolk sac.
It is often asymptomatic, however acute
inflammation of the diverticulum may occur,
mimicking acute appendicitis. The mucosa at
the mouth of the diverticulum may become
inflamed and lead to intussusceptions and
obstruction, or the diverticulum may perforate
and cause peritonitis.
2. d. Pancreatic cancer
The most likely diagnosis here is carcinoma of
the head of the pancreas. The tumour obstructs
the common bile duct causing jaundice and
dark urine because of conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia. The faeces are pale due to a lack of
stercobilinogen. Painless jaundice is typically
the presenting feature of carcinoma of the head
of the pancreas, along with weight loss.
3. e. Ischaemic bowel
Ischaemic bowel is difficult to diagnose and
commonly missed. It usually presents as abdominal pain out of proportion to clinical findings and investigations, and is often a diagnosis
of exclusion; however the presence of metabolic
acidosis helps. It rarely occurs in patients less
than 60 years old. CT angiogram is the investigation of choice.
4. a. Columnar cells
Barrett’s oesophagus is when prolonged injury
results in the normal squamous epithelium of
the lower oesophagus being replaced by columnar epithelium. This metaplastic change
may be followed by dysplastic change, which
predisposes to malignant transformation. The
majority of patients present with a long history
of reflux.
5. a. Primary biliary cirrhosis
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disorder and predominantly affects
women, especially those 40–50 years of age,
more than men. All patients with PBC have
antimitochondrial autoantibodies and this, together with raised serum alkaline phosphatase,
is diagnostic for the condition. Patients often
present with pruritus and fatigue, and jaundice

can be present at a later stage: some patients
have xanthelasma.
6. e. Haemochromatosis
Primary haemochromatosis is an autosomal
recessive disorder characterized by the absorption of too much iron, which then accumulates
(as haemosiderin) in the liver, pancreas, heart,
pituitary and joints. The commonest presentation is an incidental finding of abnormal liver
enzymes or raised ferritin level. Symptoms are
rare in women of child-bearing age as menstrual losses and pregnancy compensate for
the excess iron absorption. Symptomatic presentation in males is usually in the fourth or
fifth decade and can be obscure such as loss
of libido and hypogonadism, secondary to dysfunction of the pituitary gland or can include
diabetes mellitus or arthritis.
7. c. Intussusception
Intussusception occurs when one segment of
bowel slides inside the adjacent segment, like
a telescope. The most common site is at the
ileocaecal valve. Patients typically present aged
5–12 months of age, with periods of screaming, vomiting, blood in the faeces (‘redcurrant
jelly’) and drawing up of the legs. The child is
pale and a sausage-shaped mass may be felt on
palpation of the abdomen.
8. b. Vitamin B1
Vitamin B1 is also known as thiamine. Thiamine
deficiency is very common in people who
drink excess alcohol due to several factors. These
patients generally have a poor oral diet, and
thiamine is also a coenzyme in alcohol metabolism. It is essential that it is given quickly in
patients who have decompensated liver failure
as thiamine deficiency can lead to Wernicke’s
encephalopathy. It is always given intravenously
in the acute presentation as it is poorly absorbed
orally in people who are alcohol-dependent.
9. d. Oesophageal candidasis
Patients with diabetes are more prone to getting candidiasis, as high sugar levels lead to better conditions for the yeast to grow. It is also
only a short 10-day history which also favours
candidiasis over some of the more chronic conditions listed.

187

SBA answers
10. a. Oesophageal varices
The examination findings here show evidence
of liver disease. This helps point to the diagnosis of oesophageal varices as the cause of the
upper gastrointestinal bleed. In patients with
cirrhosis of the liver and portal hypertension
the raised pressure in the portal system causes
the site of a connection between the systemic
and portal venous systems to open up and
enlarge. The enlarged veins protrude into the
lumen of the lower oesophagus and may burst,
resulting in haematemesis. A man with this
history could also be prone to a Mallory–Weiss
tear without varices but usually there would
be a history of retching or vomiting before
blood appears. The diagnoses rarely cause large
volume haematemesis.
11. c. IV fluids
There is clinical evidence of shock with the
patient being tachycardic and hypotensive, so
the initial management should be resuscitation
with IV fluids. All of the other investigations are
relevant, and should be done once the patient
is haemodynamically stable.
12. e. Cholangitis
The triad of symptoms which includes fever,
abdominal pain and jaundice are typical in
cholangitis. Cholangitis occurs when gallstones become impacted in the bile duct; the
bile which is unable to escape becomes concentrated and infected, resulting in acute cholecystitis. This causes a rise in the LFTs, particularly
bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase. The other
diseases do not cause jaundice with pain.
13. b. Hepatic encephalopathy
Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by metabolic failure of the hepatocytes and the shunting of blood around the
liver (due to cirrhosis or after portocaval anastomosis). It may occur in both chronic and
acute liver failure, and results in the exposure
of the brain to abnormal metabolites, causing
oedema and astrocyte changes. Symptoms include disturbances in consciousness (ranging
from confusion to coma and death), asterixis
(coarse flap of outstretched hand) and fluctuating neurological signs including seizures,
muscular rigidity and hyperreflexia.
14. c. Gilbert’s syndrome
The isolated rise in the bilirubin within the
liver function tests is suggestive of Gilbert’s
syndrome. This is a congenital disorder caused
by patients having a reduced amount of the
enzyme UDP-glucuronyl transferase (UGT-1),

188

which conjugates bilirubin with glucuronic
acid. There is only a slight increase in serum
bilirubin (unconjugated), often after prolonged starvation or intercurrent illness. The
syndrome is asymptomatic, although some
patients complain of fatigue.
15. a. Giardiasis
Giardiasis, prevalent in the tropics, is an important cause of traveller’s diarrhoea. It is caused
by the flagellate protozoan Giardia lamblia,
which lives in the duodenum and jejunum
and is transmitted by the faecal–oral route.
Patients may be asymptomatic, or alternatively, symptoms of diarrhoea, malabsorption
and abdominal pain or bloating may develop
within 1 or 2{ts}weeks of ingesting cysts. Diagnosis is by stool microscopy, and treatment is
with metronidazole. Hepatitis A can also be
picked up when travelling abroad, however
this is usually asymptomatic, or presents as
fever, jaundice and malaise.
16. b. Dukes B
Dukes’ classification is most widely used to
stage, and predict the prognosis of colorectal
carcinoma. Dukes’ stages are:
Stage A: invaded submucosa and muscle layer
of the bowel, but confined to the wall.
Stage B: breached the muscle layer and bowel
wall, but no involvement of lymph nodes.
Stage C1: spread to immediately draining pericolic lymph nodes.
Stage C2: spread to higher mesenteric lymph
nodes.
Stage D: distant visceral metastases.
17. d. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency
The history here of both COPD and derranged
liver function test is suggestive of a1-antitrypsin
deficiency. a1-Antitrypsin is a serum protein that
is produced in the liver and has antiprotease
effects. One in ten northern Europeans carries
a deficiency gene, which is autosomal recessive
in inheritance. Symptoms include basal emphysema in about 75% of homozygotes and liver
cirrhosis in approximately 10%. Heterozygotes
have an increased risk of developing emphysema
if they smoke. None of the other diagnoses given
have a link with respiratory disease.
18. e. Gastric cancer
An enlarged supraclavicular lymph node of the
left side of the body is also known as Virchow’s
node. This is highly suggestive of carcinoma of
the stomach. Patients with a palpable Virchow’s node should be referred for an OGD for
further investigation.

SBA answers
19. c. Iron tablets
The low haemoglobin and low MCV suggests
microcytic anaemia. In females of menstrual
age the most common cause of this is irondeficiency anaemia caused by menorrhagia,
sometimes on a background of an irondeficient diet. Patients should have further
bloods sent off for iron studies to confirm
the diagnosis, and then be started on iron
tablets such as ferrous sulphate if appropriate.
If patients had either vitamin B12 or folate
deficiency, then the MCV should be high.

24. a. Mesenteric ischaemia
The key to diagnosis here is in the history. The
neck USS is likely to be a carotid Doppler scan,
suggesting there may be a history of ischaemia.
Smoking is also considered a risk factor for
this. Mesenteric ischaemia generally only affects people over 50 years of age and is associated with conditions causing arterial emboli
and thrombosis. It presents as a colicky poorly
localized pain with minimal tenderness in the
early stages, leading eventually to signs and
symptoms of peritonitis.

20. a. Hepatocellular carcinoma
A raised AFP is associated with hepatocellular
carcinoma. In younger males a raised AFP,
along with a raised b-HCG is also indicative
of germ cell tumours. However, with hepatocellular carcinoma often the rest of the LFTS
are deranged as well.

25. b. Chronic pancreatitis
Chronic pancreatitis is an on-going inflammation of the pancreas accompanied by irreversible architectural changes. Alcohol
consumption causes more than 85% of cases,
and is the most common cause of pancreatitis
in developed countries. High-fat and -protein
diets amplify the damage done by alcohol.
Other causes include: idiopathic chronic pancreatitis; trauma and scar formation, leading
to the obstruction of the main pancreatic duct;
previous episodes of acute pancreatitis predispose to others although they may often be
subclinical; cystic fibrosis resulting in protein
plugs in the duct system; hereditary forms of
pancreatitis. Patients normally present with a
history of prolonged ill-health with chronic
epigastric pain, usually radiating through to
the back.

21. e. Mallory–Weiss tear
A Mallory–Weiss tear is a tear at the gastrooesophageal junction. It is caused by prolonged retching or coughing and a sudden
increase in intra-abdominal pressure. It is most
common in alcoholics and presents as haematemesis. All of the other answers can cause
an upper gastrointestinal bleed, however the
history given of prolonged vomiting preceding
haematemesis is suggestive of a Mallory–Weiss
tear.
22. c. Viral illness
The raised WCC and raised lymphocyte count
is suggestive of an acute viral illness, whilst
the rise in the LFTs, in particular the transaminases, suggests a hepatitis type of picture. There
are several causes of a viral hepatitis which
include Epstein–Barr virus, hepatitis A, drugs
such as antibiotics and alcohol. Further investigations to determine the exact cause would
be required. Generally the treatment would
be supportive.
23. d. CT abdomen
When acute pancreatitis is diagnosed, the focus
should be on the acute management. Once the
patient has recovered from the initial attack,
they require further imaging to assess if there
has been any damage to the pancreas. In particular, the consultant is looking for any evidence
of pancreatic necrosis. CT scan is the most
appropriate investigation in order to view the
pancreas properly and any soft tissue damage.
CT is normally done prior to an MRI due to the
lower cost and the lower levels of radiation to
the patient.

26. a. Pyloric stenosis
Pyloric stenosis, or narrowing, occurs in about
1 in 150 male infants and 1 in 750 female infants. Stenosis is caused by hypertrophy of the
circular muscles of the pylorus, obstructing the
pyloric canal and the flow of contents from
the stomach into the duodenum. Typically, it
presents 4–6 weeks after birth with projectile
vomiting within half an hour of a feed. Note
that there is no bile in the vomit because the
obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of
Vater. Peristaltic waves are visible in the child,
a sausage-shaped mass (the enlarged pylorus)
can be felt in the right upper quadrant and
the hypertrophied pyloric muscle can be observed using ultrasonography. Treatment is
surgical.
27. d. Crohn’s disease
In a young adult, the history of diarrhoea and
weight loss should be investigated by a colonoscopy to look for inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of skip lesions in the
colon indicates that Crohn’s is the most likely

189

SBA answers
diagnosis. Crohn’s disease may affect any part
of the gastrointestinal tract from the mouth
to the anus. Endoscopy usually shows skip
lesions and deep ulcers and fissures in the
mucosa. Ulcerative colitis usually starts in the
rectum and it may extend proximally, although
never beyond the colon. Unlike Crohn’s, which
commonly shows skip lesions, ulcerative colitis is continuous. Areas of normal gut are not
found between lesions.
28. e. Cyclizine
Cyclizine is an antiemetic from the H1-receptor
antagonist class. These are effective against
motion sickness, as these receptors are found
in the vestibular nuclei, and against vomiting
caused by substances acting in the stomach
29. b. Direct inguinal hernia
A hernia is the protrusion of any organ or tissue
through its coverings and outside its normal
body cavity. If reducible, hernias can be pushed
back into the compartment from which they
came from. Inguinal hernias are the most
common site and may be direct (protruding
through the posterior wall of the inguinal
canal), or indirect (passing through the inguinal canal). Indirect hernias are much more
common, and lie lateral to the inferior epigastric vessels. Direct inguinal hernias are less
common and they lie medial to the inferior
epigastric vessels.
30. c. Serum amylase
Diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is by measurement of serum amylase. It is normally greatly
elevated (five times or more) in acute pancreatitis. The rest of the investigations are relevant
once acute pancreatitis has been diagnosed.
The U&Es and arterial blood gases should be
done in order to ascertain the severity of the disease, by using the Glasgow criteria. Abdominal
X-ray may show an absent psoas shadow and an
air-filled dilatation of the proximal jejunum. CT
is typically done after the acute event to assess
the degree of damage to the pancreas.
31. a. Duodenal ulcer
The positive C14 breath test is indicative of the
presence of H. pylori, which is closely associated
with peptic ulcer disease. The history given
means the diagnosis is most likely to be a duodenal ulcer. With duodenal ulcers, classically
the epigastric pain is said to be relieved by
food or antacids, and exacerbated by hunger.
The epigastric pain with gastric ulcers is characteristically associated with food.

190

32. d. Mucosa
The gastrointestinal tract maintains the same
basic structure throughout its length. From
the innermost to the outermost, the layers
which comprise the basic structure are the mucosa (composed of the epithelial layer, lamina
propria and muscularis mucosae), submucosa,
two smooth layers (the inner is circular, and the
outer longitudinal) and finally the serosa.
33. c. Glossitis
Glossitis is inflammation of the tongue. It may
occur in anaemia and certain other deficiency
states, most notably vitamin B12 deficiency.
The most common symptoms are difficulty with
chewing and swallowing foods, tender tongue,
smooth tongue swelling, and a change in colour
(is paler if caused by pernicious anaemia).
34. b. IgA
The defences of the small intestine are in the
most part due to T and B lymphocytes. The
main type of antibody produced by intestinal
B cells is IgA, the major immunoglobulin of external secretions. IgA prevents microorganisms
from entering the gut lumen as it binds and
neutralizes them directly without the need for
other effector systems. A much smaller amount
of IgM is also secreted by the intestinal B cells.
35. a. Cefotaxime
Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by an overgrowth of Clostridium difficile, a bacillus which
is carried by 2% of the population, asymptomatically. It usually occurs post antibiotic therapy
which suppresses the normal colonic flora
allowing C. difficile to proliferate. Pseudomembranous colitis is associated mainly with broadspectrum antibiotics; however cephalosporins
areconsideredthehighest-risk group.Cefotaxime
is a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic.
36. a. Tropical sprue
The symptoms of weight loss, diarrhoea and
steatorrhea are classic symptoms for malabsorption. The colonoscopy findings of villous
atrophy is suggestive initially of coeliac disease,
however you would expect the patient’s symptoms to improve with a gluten-free diet. Tropical sprue is a chronic, progressive malabsorption
in patients from the tropics (mainly the West
Indies and Asia) associated with abnormalities
of small intestinal structure and function. It is
thought to have an infective cause. Like coeliac
disease, there is villous atrophy, although obviously a gluten-free diet is of no help. Treatment
is with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

37. e. Colonoscopy
This history of a change in bowel habit for
greater than 6 weeks with PR bleeding is one
of the criteria of the NICE guidelines for an
urgent 2-week referral for patients of any age.
This should include an urgent colonoscopy
and review by a colorectal surgeon.
38. d. Squamous cell carcinoma
Achalasia is a known risk factor for the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the oesophagus. This is thought to be caused by chronic
inflammation and stasis within the oesophagus. Other risk factors for the development of
squamous cell carcinoma are smoking, alcohol,
tylosis and Plummer–Vinson Syndrome.

problem is hard stools, so the first-line laxative
should be a faecal softener. Sodium docusate is
the only faecal softener in the answers given.
If he is still having problems with constipation, then it would be appropriate to add in
a different class of laxative.
40. c. Pernicious anaemia
The low haemoglobin and high MCV is indicative of macrocytic anaemia. Pernicious anaemia is the only answer given here that is a
cause of macrocytic anaemia. Iron-deficient
anaemia and thalassaemia are both causes of
microcytic anaemia, whilst anaemia of chronic
disease and haemolytic anaemia are causes of
normocyctic anaemia.

39. b. Sodium docusate
This patient’s constipation has been caused
by the strong opioids he is taking. His main

5. H.

Pseudomembranous colitis is caused by the
Clostridium difficile toxin. This is often
associated with recent antibiotic use, including
cephalosporins and penicillins. A separate
C. difficile-specific stool sample has to be
sent off to detect it.
Colon cancer needs to be considered in anyone
over the age of 55 who presents with a change
in bowel habit, weight loss and anaemia.
The history of diarrhoea with blood in her stools,
suggests that the patient could have
inflammatory bowel disease. With ulcerative
colitis, smoking has a protective effect and some
patients have their first acute attack of colitis
once they have given up smoking.
This lady has a similar history to the lady in the
question above, however there has been no PR
bleeding or weight loss. Given the long duration
of her symptoms the most likely diagnosis is
irritable bowel syndrome.
This lady’s history of weight loss with a good
appetite, and an irregular pulse on examination
point to thyrotoxicosis as the cause of her
diarrhoea.

3 Acute abdominal pain
1. F. The very short history here favours ectopic
pregnancy, and she also has evidence of
significant intravascular loss. The differential
here is appendicitis, however the onset is usually
over a longer period of time, and the pain may
initially start centrally.
2. D. Gallstones are one of the commonest causes of
acute pancreatitis. The history of abdominal
pain and vomiting support this. She has
evidence of shock, which is likely to be the result
of a metabolic acidosis.
3. G. The tinkling bowel sounds are diagnostic of
obstruction. The vomiting suggests that the
obstruction is high up in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. I. This pain is typical of duodenal ulcers where the
pain is often eased by food, and gets worse
throughout the night. In contrast, with gastric
ulcers the pain tends to be precipitated by food.
5. B. The location of the pain and the raised WCC is
suggestive of diverticulitis. This should be
confirmed by CT scan.

4 Chronic abdominal pain
2 Vomiting
1. E. Hypercalcaemia may occur in patients with a
history of cancer. It can cause a variety of
symptoms, which can sometimes be grouped
into ‘moans, bones, groans and stones’.
2. C. History and examination is suggestive of small
bowel obstruction, which is likely to be caused
by adhesions from her previous surgery.
3. F. Rotovirus is a common cause of outbreaks of
vomiting when there are several people in the
same place, such as cruises, hospitals and
schools.
4. G. Autonomic neuropathy can cause gastric
dysmotility. Symptoms include vomiting and a
sensation of early satiety, which occurs as a
result of gastric emptying.
5. B. This short history of vomiting following a
takeaway points to acute gastritis.

1. F. There is evidence of inflammation, and the site
of pain suggests that it is of biliary origin. An
abdominal ultrasound would be able to confirm
this.
2. B. The raised GGT suggests alcohol excess.
Exacerbations of chronic pancreatitis are often
related to alcohol use. Pancreatic exocrine
hyposecretion leads to steatorrhoea.
3. A. Patients should be investigated for gastric
cancer if they have any of the following
ALARMS symptoms (Anaemia, Loss of weight,
Anorexia, Refractory to medications, Melaena,
Swallowing problems).
4. D. Crohn’s disease can present with all of the listed
symptoms. Not all colitis initially presents with
PR bleeding, and many patients just have
constitutional symptoms.
5. H. Pancreatic carcinoma is often associated with
severe abdominal pain radiating to the back
along with significant weight loss.

193

EMQ answers

5 Dysphagia
1. D.

Oesophageal web is associated with Plummer–
Vinson syndrome, which is associated with
dysphagia and iron-deficient anaemia, which is
suggested from the blood results.
2. F. Strictures are a complication of longstanding
reflux disease. This is due to gastric acid causing
damage to the mucosa. Surgical intervention is
required.
3. C. This is a typical history of achalasia. The chest
pain was caused by oesophageal spasms.
4. E. Oesophageal carcinoma needs to be excluded in
patients with progressive dysphagia and
significant weight loss.
5. A. This patient is immunosuppressed whilst having
chemotherapy, which puts patients at risk for
mucosal candidiasis.

194

6 Jaundice
1. H.

The history and examination findings are
consistent with infective mononucleosis.
Atypical lymphocytes are common. Treatment is
mainly supportive.
2. D. Painless jaundice is suggestive of carcinoma of
the head of the pancreas. This would account
for the ultrasound findings.
3. G. There is a crossover between ulcerative colitis
and sclerosing cholangitis in 10% of patients. It
is actually more common in males.
4. E. Severe, acute alcoholic hepatitis can cause
hepatic encephalopathy. His macrocytic anaemia
gives a clue that he drinks excess alcohol.
5. C. This patient has symptoms of cholestasis. The
presence of right upper quadrant pain makes
gallstone the most likely diagnosis.

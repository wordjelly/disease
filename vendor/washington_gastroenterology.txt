t is a pleasure to present the new edition of The Washington Manual®
Subspecialty Consult Series: Gastroenterology Subspecialty Consult. This pocketsize book continues to be a primary reference for medical students, interns,
residents, and other practitioners who need ready access to practical clinical
information to diagnose and treat patients with a wide variety of disorders. Medical
knowledge continues to increase at an astounding rate, which creates a challenge for
physicians to keep up with the biomedical discoveries, genetic and genomic
information, and novel therapeutics that can positively impact patient outcomes. The
Washington Manual Subspecialty Consult Series addresses this challenge by
concisely and practically providing current scientific information for clinicians to
aid them in the diagnosis, investigation, and treatment of common medical
conditions.
I want to personally thank the authors, which include house officers, fellows,
and attendings at Washington U niversity School of Medicine and Barnes Jewish
Hospital. Their commitment to patient care and education is unsurpassed, and their
efforts and skill in compiling this manual are evident in the quality of the final
product. In particular, I would like to acknowledge our editor Dr. C. Prakash
Gyawali and the series editors Drs. Katherine Henderson and Tom De Fer, who
have worked tirelessly to produce another outstanding edition of this manual. I
would also like to thank Dr. Melvin Blanchard, Chief of the Division of Medical
Education, Department at of Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine,
for his advice and guidance. I believe this Manual will meet its desired goal of
providing practical knowledge that can be directly applied at the bedside and in
outpatient settings to improve patient care.

astroenterology continues to expand as a specialty, with a wealth of new
insights on disease pathophysiology, diagnostic tools, and management options. In
addition, certain disorders such as eosinophilic esophagitis, autoimmune enteropathy
and autoimmune pancreatitis are being increasingly recognized and managed.
Genetic testing now has a defined role in many gastrointestinal disorders, including
colon cancer, and is actively utilized in clinical gastroenterology. Given these
advances, it is clear that there is ongoing need for easy access of concise diagnostic
and management direction for the novice and intermediate trainee, a need that this
manual fulfills. The unique aspect of this manual is that it is conceived and written
by trainees for trainees, with extensive mentoring and editing from academic faculty
experts. The manual therefore describes symptoms and disease entities that are
encountered most often in clinical units, both ambulatory and inpatient. The manual
strives to provide a succinct yet descriptive synopsis of each condition, presenting
the reader with disease characteristics, clinical features, investigation, and
management.
With the widespread distribution and review of the second edition of the
manual, it became evident that certain areas needed additional emphasis. The format
of individual diseases and symptoms has been revised to follow specific
subheadings to bring uniformity to the manual and to the Subspecialty Consult Series
as a whole. The manual has been extensively updated. Two new chapters are
included, Liver Transplantation and Genetic Testing in Gastrointestinal Diseases. In
addition, the chapter on Nutrition has been revised to reflect Malnutrition. Extended
segments have been updated, and in some cases, entire chapters have been rewritten
by current Washington University internal medicine residents aspiring to become
gastroenterologists and gastroenterology fellows currently enrolled in fellowship
traini ng, all under the watchful eyes of faculty experts. The third edition of the
manual therefore represents an up-to-date yet concise treatise on current knowledge
of common gastrointestinal ailments.
I would like to extend my gratitude to all the trainees and faculty mentors who
worked tirelessly to ensure that their chapters were updated and that they conformed
14

to the revised formats. For our trainee authors entering the field of gastroenterology,
seeing their contributions in print will hopefully provide them renewed enthusiasm
and vigor for continued scholarship and education, and ultimately the opportunity to
return the favor by furthering education of future trainees.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dysphagia is a common patient complaint that requires prompt
evaluation and management.
Definition

Dysphagia is defined as difficulty in swallowing or the sensation of
an obstruction in the passage of food (semisolid, solid, and/or
liquid) anywhere from the mouth to the stomach.1
Dysphagia should be distinguished from the following:
Odynophagia: pain during swallowing (dysphagia and odynophagia
may coexist in the same patient).
Globus: constant sensation of a lump or fullness in throat without
difficulty swallowing.
Aphagia: inability to swallow, which can result when a food bolus gets
impacted in the esophagus, thus blocking passage of any further boluses.
Aphagia can also result from pharyngeal muscle paralysis from lower
cranial nerve involvement.
Xerostomia: dryness of the mouth from decreased salivation (from
Sjogren’s syndrome, radiation to head and neck, medication side effects,
etc.), which can cause trouble initiating a swallow because of poor
lubrication of the food bolus.
Classification

Dysphagia can be classified as oropharyngeal or esophageal.1
19

Oropharyngeal dysphagia
Arises from disorders that affect the function of the oropharynx, larynx,
and upper esophageal sphincter (UES).
Typically caused by lesions of the swallowing center, cranial nerves, or
oropharyngeal muscles, mucosa, or teeth.2
Results from defects in oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing.3
These disorders cause difficulties with preparing the food for swallowing
or with transferring a bolus of food from oral cavity to esophagus.
Patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia may report difficulty initiating a
swallow, coughing, choking, drooling, or nasal regurgitation. This
sensation is typically reported within 1 second of initiating a swallow.3
Esophageal dysphagia
Arises commonly from structural defects within the body of the
esophagus, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), or gastric cardia.
May be caused by diseases of the esophageal smooth muscle, the
autonomic nervous system, and/or mucosa of the esophagus.2
Dysphagia is typically reported with solid foods initially.
Can result from motor abnormalities in lower esophageal sphincter
relaxation or the esophageal phase of swallowing. Dysphagia can result
from both solids and liquids in neuromuscular disorders.
Patients may describe the sensation of food sticking in the throat or the
chest, retrosternal chest pain, or regurgitation soon after swallowing.
The regurgitate may taste similar to food just eaten and not sour or
bitter (which implicates retrograde transit from the stomach, as in reflux
disease or emesis).
The sensation of dysphagia may be referred to the sternal notch despite
the fact that the point of obstruction may be in the distal esophagus.
Epidemiology

It is estimated that nearly 16% to 22% of individuals older than 50 years
describe symptoms of dysphagia.3
Etiology

Oropharyngeal dysphagia is most commonly caused by neurogenic and
myogenic disorders and rarely occurs as a result of oropharyngeal or
base-of-skull tumors.
20

Esophageal dysphagia is either the result of a structural esophageal
(luminal, intramural or extraluminal) lesion or a neuromuscular disorder
of esophageal peristalsis. In recent years, eosinophilic esophagitis, an
idiopathic eosinophilic inflammatory disease with remodeling of the
esophagus, is becoming increasingly recognized as a cause for
esophageal dysphagia, particularly in young adults.
Pathophysiology

The normal swallowing process can be divided into three
phases4:
Oral: The food bolus is first mechanically prepared by the muscles of the
jaw, face, and tongue, and propelled posteriorly and superiorly by the
tongue and the palate. This process lasts 1 to 2 seconds.
Pharyngeal: This phase begins when the bolus passes the anterior
tonsillar pillars. The soft palate closes the nasopharynx, and the lips and
the jaws remain closed. The larynx elevates and closes the laryngeal
valves (epiglottis and vocal cords). This also opens the upper esophageal
sphincter, allowing passage of the bolus into the esophagus. The entire
process lasts 1 second.
Esophageal: This phase begins with the entry of the bolus into the
esophagus. The upper esophageal sphincter closes, and bolus is
propelled efficiently through the esophagus to the stomach. In the
upright position, this is facilitated by gravity, with the esophageal muscle
contraction stripping the remnants of the bolus through an open lower
esophageal sphincter. Secondary esophageal peristalsis may initiate in
response to esophageal distension if the primary peristaltic effort is
insufficient in propelling the bolus.
Dysphagia is caused by a disruption in this process
Oropharyngeal dysphagia: occurs when there is a disruption in the
oral or pharyngeal phases of swallowing.
Esophageal dysphagia: occurs when there is a disruption in the
esophageal phase of swallowing.
Clinical Presentation

Oropharyngeal
Oropharyngeal dysphagia is commonly a manifestation of a
systemic disorder (Table 1-1). A careful and directed history
21

specifically intended to include or rule out neurologic, muscular, collagen
vascular, and local structural disorders is essential.
Patients complain of difficulty initiating a swallow, coughing, choking,
drooling, or nasal regurgitation within 1 second of initiating a swallow.
Patients have difficulty with swallowing solids and/or liquids.
Evidence of neurologic dysfunction in the lower cranial nerves, or of
generalized muscle weakness or dystrophy may be evident on physical
examination.
Esophageal
Esophageal dysphagia is typically related to an esophageal
process, either structural or neuromuscular.
Patients complain of food sticking in the throat or the chest.
Symptoms start a few seconds after swallowing.
Patients have difficulty swallowing solids at the start, particularly with
structural lesions. This can progress to difficulty with liquids. Motor
disorders may be associated with dysphagia to both solids and liquids.
Regurgitation and chest pain may be associated symptoms.
History

A carefully taken symptom history can provide clues to the underlying
cause of dysphagia.3

22

It is important to determine whether the patient has esophageal or
oropharyngeal dysphagia.3 The following are factors important in making
this determination:
Duration of symptoms and acuity of onset
Whether symptoms are intermittent or progressive
The presence or absence of aspiration symptoms, that is, cough or
choking episodes while swallowing
Symptoms of lower cranial nerve dysfunction, such as regurgitation
through the nose, drooling, or food spilling from the corners of the mouth
Associated symptoms like heartburn or chest pain
Medications the patient takes (including over-the-counter medications).
Medications that are commonly prescribed can cause dysphagia in the
oropharyngeal or esophageal stages of swallowing. For example,
tetracycline, clindamycin, and doxycycline can cause direct esophageal
mucosal injury.5
Other preexisting medical conditions, including atopic disorders and
23

asthma, which may be relevant in eosinophilic esophagitis
The patients can be asked to describe where they feel the disturbance is
located
Food items that typically cause difficulty (specifically, solids, liquids, or
both)
History of radiation therapy to head and neck
The presence of weight loss1
Physical Examination

General examination: evaluate nutritional status (including body weight).
Complete neurologic examination (attention to resting tremor, cranial
nerves, and muscle strength).
Examine oral cavity, head, and neck.
If the patient describes easy fatigability, observe the patient while
performing a repetitive task (e.g., blinking, counting aloud).3
Observe the patient’s gait and balance (one reason for this is to check for
Parkinson’s disease).
Examine the skin for thickening or texture changes (especially palms of
hands and the soles of feet).1
Evaluate the neck for thyromegaly or other mass.
Inspect the muscles for wasting and fasciculations and palpate for
tenderness to detect an underlying motor neuron disease.3
Differential Diagnosis

Oropharyngeal dysphagia
Neuromuscular causes are more frequent than structural causes for this
type of dysphagia. This is mainly because the nerves that control the
muscles in this region have a direct connection to the brain through
cranial nerves and can be damaged in accidents or diseases that affect
the brain or the cranial nerves.3
Table 1-1 refers to some of the more frequent causes of oropharyngeal
dysphagia.
Esophageal dysphagia
Generally, structural causes are a more frequent cause of this type of
dysphagia than disorders involving nerves and muscles.
A structural disorder will initially cause dysphagia to solid foods but may
24

later include liquids as well. Eosinophilic esophagitis can present with
intermittent food bolus impactions.

Patients with a neuromuscular disorder commonly report dysphagia to
both solids and liquids from the onset of symptoms.1
Table 1-2 refers to some of the more frequent causes of esophageal
dysphagia.
Diagnostic Testing

If oropharyngeal dysphagia is suspected:
A careful neurologic examination is the first step in evaluation.
Modified barium swallow/videofluoroscopy4: This consists of a
radiographic study in which the oral and pharyngeal phases are observed
in real time while the patient swallows barium of varying consistencies,
such as thin liquids, thick liquids, and barium cookies, or a cracker. This
study helps identify abnormalities of the oropharyngeal phases and may
direct therapy. Patients may tolerate certain consistencies better than
others, and the diet can be modified accordingly.
Laryngoscopy: If structural lesions are identified, direct laryngoscopy
should be performed for further evaluation.
25

High-resolution manometry: Newer techniques of esophageal
manometry may have value in evaluation of pharyngeal muscle and
upper esophageal sphincter function. Recent advances have incorporated
tactile sensor technology to high-resolution manometry (3D highresolution manometry) that may have value in defining sphincter
function.
If esophageal dysphagia is suspected:
Upper endoscopy: This is the most useful initial test, because it allows
for direct visualization of the esophagus and permits tissue biopsy and
dilation of structural narrowing if found.6 An upper endoscopy is the test
of choice in the evaluation of esophageal dysphagia and should be the
first test ordered.
Esophagram (barium swallow): Alternate test that is useful when
subtle strictures or narrowings are suspected or when road mapping of a
tight or complicated stricture is desired before endoscopic evaluation.
This test can also provide information on the length and degree of
narrowing of a structural lesion.6 An esophagogram commonly reveals
structural esophageal abnormalities such as tumors, webs, and rings, or
aids in the detection of subtle abnormalities. Motility disorders, such as
achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, and scleroderma esophagus, have
typical esophagram findings, but esophageal manometry is typically
required for a definitive diagnosis.
Esophageal manometry: This method is considered when no
structural or obstructive process is identified on upper endoscopy or
barium esophagram in patients presenting with dysphagia.1 It involves
the passage of a thin catheter through the nose, down the esophagus,
and past the LES. Pressure measurements are then obtained over the full
length of the esophagus, including the UES and the LES, both at rest and
during a swallow.7 High-resolution esophageal manometry involves using
a solid state catheter with 36 circumferential sensors 1 cm apart and
provides high-fidelity topograms (Clouse plots) of esophageal peristalsis
and sphincter function. This has been demonstrated to substantially
improve the sensitivity of diagnosis of LES relaxation abnormalities. The
addition of stationary impedance to high-resolution manometry and the
incorporation of viscous and solid boluses to manometry testing may
improve the yield for a motor diagnosis in the evaluation of dysphagia.

26

TREATMENT

Medications

Medications are useful only if they can treat the underlying condition causing
dysphagia.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Oropharyngeal dysphagia
When possible, treatment should be directed at the underlying disorder.
However, many patients have irreversible or progressive neurologic
diseases, which can lead to worsening oropharyngeal dysphagia.
Consultation with a speech therapist is often helpful in modifying
eating behaviors and food consistency.4
Despite these interventions, some patients will still experience
oropharyngeal dysphagia placing them at a high risk for aspiration or
inadequate caloric intake.
If significant improvement of oropharyngeal dysphagia is not expected,
alternative sources of nutritional support should be pursued. Options
may include nasogastric feeding tube, or enteral feeding through
percutaneous gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes.
Excessive drooling or troublesome oropharyngeal secretions can
sometimes be suppressed using anticholinergic agents or tricyclic
antidepressants.
Esophageal dysphagia
Management of esophageal dysphagia should be tailored to the
underlying disorder (see Chapter 12 for more detail).
Endoscopic therapies, including dilation of strictures and disruption of
esophageal rings, can be helpful in the management of structural causes
of esophageal dysphagia.
Eosinophilic esophagitis can be treated with topical steroids and
exclusion diets; intermittent dilation of dominant strictures may be
sometimes necessary.
Empiric endoscopic dilation with a large caliber dilator is often performed
in patients wherein a definitive etiology for esophageal-type dysphagia is
27

not apparent on routine investigation. This approach may result in
symptomatic improvement of varying durations.
Obstructing tumors can be treated with dilation or by placement of an
endoscopic stent.
Some motility disorders are amenable to endoscopic therapy, including
botulinum toxin injection into the LES in disorders of LES relaxation.
Surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation are durable options in
achalasia.
Gastrostomy tube placement may be indicated in patients with large,
obstructing esophageal tumors that are not amenable to dilation or stent
placement.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Diet

Treatment of dysphagia can include a change in the patient’s diet or the
consistency of the diet to aid swallowing. A modified barium swallow may help
identify certain consistencies that can be swallowed better than others. This is
particularly relevant in oropharyngeal dysphagia from neuromuscular disease and in
esophageal dysphagia where there is residual dysphagia after treatment.
Activity

A speech–language pathologist can help a patient learn different exercises and
head and neck positions that may help facilitate swallowing.3

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Functional dysphagia: A disorder that is characterized by a sensation
of abnormal bolus transit through the esophagus in the absence of
structural lesions, GERD, and histopathology-based esophageal motility
disorders. Functional dysphagia includes the sense of solid and/or liquid
foods sticking, lodging, or passing through esophagus.8 This is related to
increased perception of esophageal sensation, sometimes triggered by
noxious triggers like gastroesophageal reflux disease. In addition to
treating associated reflux disease, neuromodulators (e.g., low-dose
tricyclic antidepressants) may be of value.
28

COMPLICATIONS
The most common complications with dysphagia include aspiration,
pneumonia, and dehydration.9 Prolonged dysphagia can lead to
weight loss and malnutrition. Aggressive dilation of esophageal strictures
can rarely result in esophageal perforation.

REFERRAL
Treating a patient with dysphagia is often a joint effort of a team of
specialists including a gastroenterologist, radiologist, speech–language
therapist, neurologist, otolaryngologist, and nutritionist.3

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
The improvement of symptoms often depends on the type of dysphagia.
In the case of strictures, tumors, and cervical webs, surgery, dilation,
antineo-plastic therapy, or a combination of these treatments may be
used.3 An alternative option, especially with untreatable tumors, is stent
placement.
Certain types of dysphagia such as those caused by acid reflux disease,
esophageal infections, and eosinophilic esophagitis may be treated with
medical therapy.
Dysphagia caused by achalasia can be treated with pneumatic balloon
dilation, botulinum toxin injection, or myotomy.6

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Nausea is one of the most common gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and
can be related to a wide variety of GI, systemic, and neurologic
disorders.
Nausea can precede the act of emesis, occur concurrently with emesis, or
occur on its own.
Altered autonomic activity and decreased function of the upper GI tract
can accompany severe nausea.
Definitions

Nausea refers to the feeling of an imminent urge to vomit and is usually
sensed in the throat or epigastrium. It can be accompanied by transient
hypersalivation, lightheadedness or dizziness, and sweating.
Vomiting (or emesis) denotes the forceful ejection of GI contents
through the mouth. The act of emesis is a highly coordinated event
requiring the integration of both central and peripheral nervous
systems.1
Epidemiology

Nausea and vomiting are commonly reported symptoms. Prevalence in
the community is estimated at 12%. Nausea and vomiting are frequent
reasons for consultation with a gastroenterologist and contribute
significantly to hospital costs and physician visits.

Etiology

Clinically important etiologies of nausea and vomiting are listed in Table
2-1.
Medications
Antiparkinsonian agents (e.g., l -DOPA, bromocriptine), nicotine, and
digoxin produce nausea and vomiting through direct action on receptors
in the chemoreceptor trigger zone.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics,
such as erythromycin, stimulate peripheral afferent pathways to activate
the vomiting center directly.2
Opioid analgesics cause nausea in >25% of patients. Multiple
mechanisms have been implicated, including direct stimulation of the
chemoreceptor trigger zone, reduced GI motility, or enhanced vestibular
sensitivity.
Chemotherapeutic agents frequently cause nausea and vomiting.
Acute vomiting, usually caused by agents such as cisplatin, nitrogen
mustard, and dacarbazine, is generally mediated through serotonergic
pathways, both centrally and peripherally. Delayed and anticipatory
vomiting is serotonin independent.
Cannabis, when used on a long-term basis, can result in an illness that
resembles cyclic vomiting syndrome, termed cannabinoid hyperemesis.
Cannabis-induced autonomic dysregulation and abnormal gastric
emptying are thought to be contributing to this process.3

32

Infections
Viral gastroenteritis is a common cause of acute nausea and
vomiting, particularly in the pediatric population. Causative agents
include rotavirus, Norwalk virus, reovirus, and adenovirus.
Bacterial infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella, Bacillus
cereus, and Clostridium perfringens are commonly associated with “food
poisoning.” Enterotoxins act both centrally and peripherally.
Miscellaneous infectious processes, such as otitis media, meningitis,
urinary tract infections, and acute hepatitis, also commonly produce
33

nausea and vomiting.2
Endocrine and metabolic disorders
Pregnancy is an important cause of nausea and vomiting in women of
reproductive age. Nausea and vomiting occurs in ~70% of women during
the first trimester. Symptoms typically peak around the ninth week and
subside bythe end of the first trimester. Nausea in pregnancy is related
to fluctuations in hormone levels, as the symptoms parallel the rise and
fall of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) levels. Hyperemesis
gravidarum complicates 1% to 5% of pregnancies, causing intractable
vomiting. This condition is serious and can result in significant weight
loss and fetal loss.4
Uremia, diabetic ketoacidosis, and hypercalcemia are postulated
to cause nausea and vomiting through direct action on the area
postrema. Parathyroid, thyroid, and adrenal disease act by
disruption of GI motility.
Gastrointestinal and peritoneal disorders
Nausea can be caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease or peptic
ulcer disease.
Functional disorders, such as functional nausea and vomiting, chronic
idiopathic nausea, and cyclic vomiting syndrome, account for a large
proportion of chronic nausea and vomiting. Alterations in motility (e.g.,
abnormal gastric emptying) may be present but correlate poorly with
symptoms.5
Gastroparesis, where altered gastric motility leads to a failure or near
failure of gastric emptying, is associated with a multitude of systemic
disorders, notably diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus,
scleroderma, and amyloidosis. Upper abdominal fullness, nausea,
vomiting (particularly delayed vomiting of food ingested hours or days
earlier) and weight loss can be seen.6
Inflammation of any viscus can cause nausea and vomiting through
activation of afferent pathways. Pancreatitis, diverticulitis, colitis,
appendicitis, cholecystitis, and biliary pain (colic) are common causes.
Peritoneal inflammation is usually associated with severe abdominal pain
in addition to nausea and vomiting.
Mechanical obstruction at any level in the GI tract can be the cause
of nausea and vomiting. Distention of the bowel lumen causes activation
of afferent pathways and emesis ensues in an attempt to decrease
34

pressure.
Intestinal pseudo-obstruction usually results from disorders of
neuromuscular function in the colon and small bowel. Clinical
presentation is similar to that of mechanical bowel obstruction, but no
anatomic obstruction is evident on investigation.
Central nervous system (CNS) disorders
Increased intracranial pressure from any cause (malignancy,
infection, cerebrovascular accident, hemorrhage) can induce emesis with
or without nausea.
Vestibular disorders, including labyrinthitis, cerebellopontine angle
tumors, Ménière’s disease, and motion sickness, are common causes of
nausea and vomiting.2
Pathophysiology

Initiation of emesis
The vomiting center, located in the dorsal portion of the lateral reticular
formation, serves as the point of integration and initiation of emesis.
Afferent stimuli are received by the vomiting center from a variety of
sources. The vestibular system, particularly the labyrinthine apparatus
located in the inner ear, sends afferent signals through the vestibular
nucleus and the cerebellum to the vomiting center.7
Peripheral neural pathways from the GI tract play a significant role in the
initiation of emesis. Afferent vagal fibers project to the nucleus tractus
solitarius and from there to the vomiting center. Serotonergic pathways
are also believed to play a large role in peripheral stimulation via 5hydroxytrypta-mine (5-HT)-3 receptors located on the afferent vagal
nerves.
The chemoreceptor trigger zone, located in the area postrema on the
floor of the fourth ventricle, is a major mediator of the initiation of
emesis. A number of drugs and toxins activate the zone via dopamine
D2, muscarinic M1, histaminergic H1, serotonergic 5-HT 3, and
vasopressinergic receptors. Several metabolic abnormalities also affect
the trigger zone. Once activated, efferent signals are sent on to the
vomiting center, where the physical act of emesis is initiated.
Mechanisms of emesis
Efferent pathways from the vomiting center serve to initiate vomiting.
Important pathways include the phrenic nerves to the diaphragm, the
35

spinal nerves to the abdominal musculature, and visceral efferent vagal
fibers to the larynx, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach.7
The act of emesis involves a coordinated sequence of events that
includes the abdominal wall musculature and smooth muscle of the GI
tract. While the lower esophageal sphincter and the gastric body relax, a
combination of forceful contractions of the abdominal wall muscles,
diaphragm, and gastric smooth muscle causes the expulsion of gastric
contents into the esophagus. Reverse peristalsis propels these contents
into the mouth, whereas reflex closure of the glottis prevents aspiration
and elevation of the soft palate prevents reflux into the nasopharynx.

DIAGNOSIS
In general, a three-step approach is recommended for the evaluation of nausea
and vomiting 1:
1. Assess the degree to which symptoms impair the patient’s quality of life
and ability to function.
Patients with refractory symptoms, significant metabolic abnormalities,
or evidence of an acute emergency require hospitalization for expedited
evaluation and treatment.
2. Investigate and treat the cause of nausea and vomiting.
3. If no cause can be determined, therapy to improve symptoms is
initiated.
Clinical Presentation
History

Acute vomiting suggests bowel obstruction, infection, medicationinduced cause, or an accumulation of toxins as in uremia or diabetic
ketoacidosis.1
Chronic vomiting, defined as emesis for ≥1 month, suggests a chronic
medical or functional basis for the symptom; rarely, the etiology is
psychogenic.
Abdominal pain is commonly associated with nausea and vomiting.
This may indicate an inflammatory condition, such as appendicitis or
pancreatitis; pain can also occur from violent retching and bruising of
36

abdominal wall musculature.
Diarrhea or fever suggests an infectious process.
Weight loss occurs when nutrition is affected in chronic and severe
situations; it can also be seen with gastroparesis.
Mental status changes and headache indicate meningitis or other
CNS abnormalities.
Vertigo and tinnitus suggest a labyrinthine process.
Timing of vomiting can offer clues to the etiology of nausea and
vomiting:
Vomiting that occurs within minutes of a meal can be caused by an
obstructive process in the proximal GI tract.
Inflammatory conditions generally produce vomiting within
approximately 1 hour after meals.
Vomiting from gastroparesis can occur several hours after a meal and is
typically associated with weight loss.
Early morning vomiting often occurs with first-trimester pregnancy and
uremia.
Neurogenic vomiting is typically projectile and brought on by positions
that increase intracranial pressure.
The nature of the vomited material can point to a diagnosis:
Vomiting of undigested or partially digested foods suggests gastric
retention caused by obstruction or gastroparesis.
Blood or the appearance of “coffee grounds” in the emesis indicates an
upper GI bleed.
Bile rules out the possibility of obstruction proximal to the duodenal
papilla.
Foul odor can indicate a distal obstruction, coloenteric fistula, or
bacterial overgrowth.
If the patient reports emesis of food that looks and tastes just like the
food they just ate, consider regurgitation of esophageal content instead
of emesis, and an obstructive distal esophageal process (e.g., achalasia)
needs to be excluded.
Physical Examination

Assessment of volume status should be the initial focus of the
physical examination. Orthostatic hypotension and tachycardia indicate
hypovolemia and should be corrected immediately with volume
37

resuscitation.2,8
Examination of the oropharynx may reveal loss of dental enamel in
situations associated with chronic emesis such as bulimia or functional
nausea and vomiting. Patients with bulimia may also have callus
formation over their knuckles from repetitively inducing vomiting.
Abdominal tenderness suggests an inflammatory condition, and
rebound tenderness suggests peritonitis.
Absence of bowel sounds is consistent with ileus, whereas obstruction
classically presents with high-pitched, hyperactive bowel sounds.
Hepatomegaly or a tender liver edge may indicate hepatitis.
Neurologic examination can reveal signs of meningitis and other
nervous system disorders.
Differential Diagnosis

Table 2-1 lists the common etiologies of nausea and vomiting.
Vomiting needs to be distinguished from regurgitation and rumination.
Regurgitation is the passive retrograde flow of esophageal contents
into the mouth, commonly seen in gastroesophageal reflux.
Rumination is the effortless regurgitation of recently ingested food into
the mouth, followed by rechewing and swallowing. In adults, rumination
can be seen in association with psychiatric disorders and in individuals
with developmental disability.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Testing

Basic metabolic panel, evaluating for electrolyte imbalances,
especially hyponatremia elevated blood urea nitrogen and creatinine.
This can be seen with uremia and dehydration. Hypokalemia and
contraction alkalosis can also occur with prolonged vomiting.
Liver chemistries, which may reveal acute hepatitis or cholestasis.
Elevated lipase and amylase levels indicate pancreatitis.
Complete blood cell count may reveal an elevated white blood cell
count, suggesting an infectious or inflammatory process. Blood counts
show decreased hemoglobin and hematocrit in situations associated with
blood loss.
Urinalysis may reveal evidence of urinary tract infection; additionally,
38

ketonuria can be seen in the setting of prolonged fasting or diabetic
ketoacidosis.
Urine or serum β-HCG levels are mandatory in women of reproductive
age with acute vomiting to evaluate for pregnancy.
imaging

Plan abdominal radiograph. Flat and upright plain x-ray films of the
abdomen can be obtained, typically termed “obstructive x-ray series.”
The presence of air–fluid levels and small bowel dilatation indicates ileus
or obstruction. Free air under the diaphragm indicates bowel perforation.
Computed tomography of the abdomen may be useful for evaluating
hollow viscus for evidence of dilatation and obstruction, evaluating for
inflammatory conditions, as well as in looking for structural abnormalities
of the liver, the pancreas, and the biliary system.
An upper GI x-ray series, sometimes performed with small bowel
follow-through with barium contrast, can further evaluate subtle
obstruction and mucosal lesions.
Nuclear medicine gastric emptying study may be useful in cases
when gastroparesis or functionally delayed gastric emptying is
suspected.
SmartPill® is an ingestible, wireless capsule that measures pressure,
pH, and temperature as it transits the GI tract. The smart pill may be
useful in the evaluation of nausea and vomiting when gastroparesis,
small bowel, or colonic dysmotility are suspected as the etiology.9
Diagnostic Procedures

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) allows for direct visualization
of the foregut mucosa. An EGD is typically considered if the history points
toward a GI etiology for chronic nausea and vomiting; it can also be a
key test to exclude mucosal disease when an etiology is not apparent. A
number of disorders including reflux esophagitis, peptic ulcer disease,
gastric outlet obstruction, and foregut malignancy can be diagnosed
during EGD.2

TREATMENT

39

General Principles

Orthostatic hypotension and sinus tachycardia are signs of hypovolemia
(with loss of ~10% of circulating blood volume) and should be corrected
immediately with administration of intravenous (IV) fluids.2
Emesis caused by peptic ulcer disease can be treated with acid
suppression and eradication of Helicobacter pylori.
Many inflammatory conditions, including appendicitis and cholecystitis, as
well as mechanical small bowel or gastric outlet obstruction, require
surgical intervention. Antiemetic and promotility agents are useful for
symptomatic relief.
Patients with acute, self-limited nausea and vomiting may only require
observation, antiemetics, and hydration.
Antiemetic Medications

Antihistamines
Meclizine (25 mg PO QID) is used for labyrinthitis, whereas
promethazine (12.5 to 25 mg PO/IM q6h) is very useful for treating the
nausea caused by uremia.
Anticholinergics
Scopolamine (1.5-mg transdermal patch every 3 days) is used for the
nausea of motion sickness.
Dopamine receptor antagonists
Prochlorperazine (5 to 10 mg PO/IM/IV q6h) and chlorpromazine (10 to
50 mg PO/IM q8h) are commonly used in both chronic and acute
vomiting. Side effects, which are caused by the action on dopamine
receptors throughout the CNS, include drowsiness, insomnia, anxiety,
mood changes, confusion, dystonic reactions, tardive dyskinesia, and
parkinsonian symptoms.
5-HT3 receptor antagonists
Included in the class of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are ondansetron (4 to
8 mg PO/IV q8h) and granisetron (1 mg PO q12h), palonosetron (0.25
mg PO/IV once a week), which are very useful in nausea caused by
chemotherapeutic agents, particularly cisplatin.10
Miscellaneous agents
Corticosteroids and cannabinoids exert potent antiemetic effects in
patients undergoing chemotherapy. Aprepitant, which selectively
40

antagonizes human substance P or neurokinin 1 receptors, is used for the
prevention of chemotherapy-related nausea and vomiting.
Prokinetic Medications

Metoclopramide (5 to 20 mg PO QID), which acts on both 5-HT 4 and
peripheral dopamine receptors, is used for treating nausea. Although it is
also used to accelerate gastric emptying in gastroparesis and functional
dyspepsia, its promotility action is subject to tachyphylaxis with
continued use. Its antiemetic properties, through its central action, may
allow suppression of nausea and vomiting despite continued use.
Jitteriness, tremors, parkinsonism, and the risk of tardive dyskinesia limit
its long-term use. The FDA has recently issued a black box warning
related to the risk of irreversible neurologic complications and cardiac
arrhythmias associated with the use of metoclopramide. 11
Erythromycin, a macrolide antibiotic, is a motilin receptor agonist that
improves gastric emptying but without significant suppression of nausea.
It can be administered intravenously for acute gastric distension to
stimulate gastric emptying. Its promotility action is subject to
tachyphylaxis and therefore it is not useful for long-term management.
Cisapride is no longer available in the United States because of its
proarrhythmic effects.
Domperidone, also a peripheral dopamine receptor antagonist, is a
potent prokinetic agent but is not currently available in the United
States.
Tegaserod, a 5-HT 4 receptor agonist, primarily used in the treatment of
irritable bowel syndrome, has modest promotility action in the stomach
and can be used to improve gastric emptying. This medication, however,
is currently not available for routine use because of its cardiovascular
effects.12
Complementary and Alternative Therapy

Ginger (Zingiber officinale) root extract has been evaluated in the
treatment of nausea and vomiting in multiple settings. It appears to act
via inhibition of serotonin receptors in the GI tract and in the CNS. It has
been most extensively studied and effective in pregnancy-related nausea
and vomiting. The typical dose of ginger root extract is 250 mg QID.13
41

Acupuncture has been shown to be an efficacious therapy for acute as
well as chronic nausea and vomiting related to a wide variety of
etiologies. Acupoint PC6 (Neiguan) has been the most commonly
evaluated acupuncture point.14 Acupressure bands that apply pressure
on the ventral aspect of the wrist have also been used in this setting.
Hypnosis has been used for the treatment of functional nausea and
vomiting as well as nausea and vomiting related to pregnancy and
chemotherapy. 4,15

SPECIALCONSIDERATIONS

Refractory Nausea and Vomiting

Nausea and vomiting are considered refractory if investigation fails to
reveal a treatable etiology and if routine measures do not result in
symptomatic improvement.
Two patterns of symptoms are recognized.
Chronic persistent nausea and vomiting, occurring on a daily or
frequent basis. This syndrome is part of the spectrum of functional
nausea and vomiting, and it can be effectively treated with
neuromodulators, including tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, and to a lesser extent, bupropion and buspirone.16
Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a unique disorder characterized by
short periods of abdominal pain and violent nausea and vomiting that
are separated by symptom-free intervals during which patients are
relatively asymptomatic.
Current understanding of this condition links it to migraine headaches.
The treatment approach is similar to that used for migraine headaches,
with both abortive and prophylactic medications.
Associated complaints during symptom “attacks” include upper
abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, and sweating. Some patients report a
prodrome lasting several minutes to hours.
Abortive therapy could include triptans during the prodromal period and
combinations of antiemetic medications, anxiolytics, and narcotic
analgesics, in addition to IV hydration, during symptomatic periods.
Prophylactic approaches include not only tricyclic antidepressants as
42

first-line medications but also antiepileptic medications such as
zonisamide, levetiracetam, or even topiramate.17
Treatment of Refractory Nausea and Vomiting

Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline or
nortriptyline (10 to 50 mg PO at bedtime), are useful in functional
vomiting syndrome and as prophylaxis in CVS.18
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), which are generally
used for depression and anxiety disorders, may also block presynaptic
serotonin receptors on sensory vagal fibers, helping to control nausea.
Use of SSRIs for functional nausea and vomiting is largely based on
anecdotal evidence; however, these agents are sometimes better
tolerated than tricyclic antidepressants. Their role in CVS has not been
established.19
Bupropion, an inhibitor of neuronal uptake of norepinephrine and
dopamine, is an antidepressant and may additionally help relieve nausea
and vomiting. It can be considered if side effects from tricyclic
antidepressants (especially anti-cholinergic effects, sexual side effects,
and weight gain) are poorly tolerated.
Buspirone is an anxiolytic drug that binds to serotonin and dopamine
receptors. This drug may increase the compliance of the gastric antrum
and is useful in functional dyspepsia associated with nausea and
vomiting.
Sumatriptan activates 5-HT1 receptors and is used as an abortive
therapy for migraines. It can be used as part of abortive therapy early
during a cyclic vomiting attack, especially during the prodrome. 16
Zonisamide, an antiepileptic agent, has multiple mechanisms of action,
including blockade of voltage-dependent sodium and T-type calcium
channels, binding to the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, and facilitating
dopaminergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission. It has been used
with some success as a prophylactic agent in the treatment of CVS.17
Levetiracetam, another antiepileptic drug with a less well-understood
mechanism of action, appears to inhibit bursts of neuronal firing without
affecting normal neuronal excitability. It may also be of benefit as
prophylactic therapy in CVS.
Surgical therapy is considered a last resort in refractory nausea and
43

vomiting, specifically when significant weight loss results from the
symptomatic state or from impaired gastric emptying.
Enteral feeding can be maintained through a jejunostomy tube, which
can be placed endoscopically, surgically, or with radiologic guidance
(depending on local expertise).
Gastric stimulator, a device that delivers electrical stimulation through
electrodes implanted into the gastric wall, can be an option for patients
with refractory persistent nausea and vomiting. It does not appear to
improve gastric emptying and therefore may not benefit advanced
gastroparesis wherein impaired gastric emptying leads to weight loss
and nutritional issues.20

COMPLICATIONS
Vomiting, particularly when protracted, can lead to a number of lifethreatening complications.
Metabolic and electrolyte alterations can develop rapidly;
dehydration with resultant hypotension may lead to syncope and
prerenal azotemia. Hypochloremic alkalosis is typically the first
electrolyte abnormality to appear due to loss of hydrogen and chloride
ions; this is followed by development of hypokalemia due to renal
potassium wasting in response to alkalosis. The resulting metabolic
derangement can lead to rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias.
Nutritional deficiencies and weight loss may result in decreased
oral intake. Enteral (via jejunostomy or nasojejunal tube) or parenteral
nutrition may be needed in both the acute and chronic settings. A more
detailed discussion of nutritional issues can be found in Chapter 11.
Dental erosions may develop in patients with chronic vomiting
syndromes as a result of acid- and bile-induced erosion of the dental
enamel.
Erosive esophagitis can develop as a result of protracted vomiting and
may range from mild to severe. It is important to distinguish esophagitis
that is due to vomiting from that associated with gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD). On endoscopy, esophagitis related to protracted
vomiting extends uniformly up to the proximal esophageal body whereas
GERD-related esophagitis is most pronounced in the distal esophagus.
44

Mallory-Weiss syndrome can result from forceful and prolonged
vomiting episodes and is characterized by longitudinal lacerations of the
mucosa near the gastroesophageal junction. These tears can lead to GI
bleeding, which is typically self-limited.
Boerhaave’s syndrome refers to free perforation of the esophagus
into the mediastinum due to vomiting. It is most often seen in alcoholics
and patients with binge-eating disorders. It should be suspected in any
patient presenting with severe chest pain and subcutaneous emphysema
after an episode of vomiting (Mackler’s triad). The diagnosis can be
made on the basis of chest computed tomograph or esophagram (with
water-soluble contrast). Even with prompt surgical repair, Boerhaave’s
syndrome carries a 25% to 50% mortality rate.21

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Diarrhea is defined as increased liquidity/decreased consistency of stools,
which may be associated with increased frequency of bowel movements,
specifically more than three stools per day.
The small intestine and colon are highly efficient in reabsorption of
water. 1,2
10 L of intestinal fluid enters the jejunum on a daily basis
1 to 1.5 L of intestinal fluid is passed into the colon
100 mL/day passes out of the colon as stool
Diarrhea results from the inability or inefficiency of the digestive tract to
perform this reabsorptive function.
Classification

Diarrhea can be classified into acute and chronic, based on the duration
of symptoms. Acute diarrhea is typically 2 weeks in duration, although
some acute diarrheal illnesses may continue to improve over 3 to 4
weeks. Diarrhea lasting longer than 4 weeks can be designated chronic.
Diarrhea can be categorized into several types, based on
pathophysiology of the causative process.1,2
Osmotic
In this type of diarrhea, large amounts of poorly absorbed solute within
47

the intestinal lumen cause osmotic retention of water in the stool.
There are two clinical hallmarks of osmotic diarrhea: (a) the diarrhea
ceases with fasting, and (b) the stool osmotic gap is abnormally elevated
>125 mOsm/kg.
Stool osmotic gap is calculated using the formula: 290 − 2(Na + + K+).
The body maintains equal fecal and serum osmolality, which is
approximately 290 mOsm/kg.
The presence of a poorly absorbed substance within the intestinal lumen
requires that additional water be retained in the stool to maintain this
value, causing an osmotic gap.
Osmotic gap 50 mOsm/kg is considered normal.
Osmotic gap >125 mOsm/kg is consistent with a pure osmotic diarrhea.
Secretory
Intestinal secretion overcomes the absorptive capability of the small
intestine and colon.
Secretion of incompletely absorbed electrolytes leads to retention of
intraluminal water.
Because intestinal secretion is a constant process, diarrhea is incessant
regardless of fasting state or time of the day.
Presentation is typically with large amounts of watery diarrhea (1 to
10L/24 hours).
The stool osmotic gap is normal.
Inflammatory
Inflammation and ulceration impair the absorptive and digestive
functions of normal mucosa.
In addition, inflammation itself often elaborates mucus, proteins, fluid,
and blood into the bowel lumen, adding to stool volume. Secretory
mechanisms may be coexistent.
Clinical indicators of inflammatory diarrhea include nocturnal diarrhea
and systemic signs, such as fatigue or fever.
Steatorrhea
Any process that affects digestion and absorption of fats, ranging from
celiac disease to pancreatic insufficiency, can lead to steatorrhea.
In addition, inadequate contact time of bowel contents with the digestive
juices and absorptive intestinal mucosa, such as with altered intestinal
motility, can also contribute to steatorrhea.
Dysmotility/Functional
48

Gut dysmotility may cause increased intestinal and colonic transit time
as well as decrease contact time with intestinal absorptive mucosa.
Functional syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) include a
pain component as well as a change in bowel habits.
Epidemiology

Acute diarrhea
Worldwide, >2 billion people experience at least one episode of acute
diarrhea each year.
As a result of poor sanitation and limited access to health care, acute
infectious diarrhea remains one of the most common causes of death in
developing countries, accounting for >5 million childhood deaths per
year.
In the United States, nearly 100 million people are affected by acute
diarrhea annually. Nearly half of these individuals must limit their
activities, 250,000 require hospitalization, and approximately 3000
people die. Most deaths occur in the debilitated and the elderly. 3
Chronic diarrhea
Chronic diarrhea has an estimated prevalence of 3% to 5% in the United
States, which may be an underestimation since many patients do not
seek medical attention. 1
According to the AGA Burden of Illness study, direct costs of chronic
diarrhea is $524 million per year, with $136 million per year for indirect
costs. 4
Although it is a major cause of disability, there are limited studies on the
economic impact or effect on quality of life that results from chronic
diarrhea, diagnostic testing, and treatment.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Acute versus chronic
Acute
Most cases of acute diarrhea are mild and are caused by self-limited
processes/infections, lasting 5days. Symptoms may continue to improve
for 2 to 3 weeks after onset in some circumstances.
Nearly 90% of cases require no diagnostic evaluation and respond to
simple rehydration.
Chronic
50

Patients may present with symptoms that have been present anywhere
from 4 weeks to many years.
There are a wide variety of causes (Table 3-2 ). A careful and detailed
history and physical examination, along with judicious use of laboratory
tests and investigative procedures, often yield an accurate diagnosis.
In contrast to acute diarrhea, chronic diarrhea often has a noninfectious
etiology.
Noninflammatory versus inflammatory
Noninflammatory
The presentation typically consists of watery, nonbloody diarrhea
associated with periumbilical cramps, bloating, nausea, or vomiting.

51

This is usually caused by disruption of normal absorption or a secretory
process in the small intestine, such as that seen with certain bacterial
toxins.
In most cases, the diarrhea is mild. It may, however, become
voluminous, ranging from 10 to 200 mL/kg/24 hours, which can result in
dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities.
Inflammatory
Inflammatory diarrhea may present with fever, bloody diarrhea,
abdominal pain, and tenesmus.
Infectious agents preferentially involve the colon, leading to a small52

volume diarrhea defined as 1 L/day. Because these infectious agents are
often invasive, fecal leukocytes can be present.
History

The following points are elicited when obtaining the history of
diarrhea11:
Onset, duration, pattern/frequency
Stool characteristics: watery, fatty, or inflammatory (blood or mucus)
Systemicsymptoms: fever, fatigue
Abdominal pain: postprandial?
Fecal incontinence
Weight loss: suggests decreased intake (volitional to decrease
diarrhea?), mal-absorption, neoplasm, ischemia
Significant weight loss (>10 lb) is more worrisome and often points to
nutrient malabsorption.
Nocturnal/fastingsymptoms
Aggravating/mitigatingfactors: diet, stress, medications
Recent exposure to hospitals or antibiotic use
Sick contacts/regional outbreak: food-related
Past medical and surgical conditions may be relevant to the history,
as follows:
Systemic disease: diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease,
inflammatory/autoimmune disorder, HIV, immunocompromised state,
cancer
History indicating factitious symptoms: eating disorder, malingering,
secondary gain
Previous surgery: gastrectomy, vagotomy, bowel resection,
cholecystectomy
Previous radiation therapy
A family history of the following conditions may be helpful:
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), celiac sprue, multiple endocrine
neoplasia (MEN) syndromes.
A detailed medication history is obtained, especially inquiring about the
use of laxatives, antibiotics, over-the-counter medications.
A diet history may be relevant, especially the following:
Recentchanges or associated foods
Intake of sugar-free substitutes or fructose
53

Exposure to contaminated food or water
Time from ingestion: 6 hours suggests a preformed toxin, 8 to 16 hours
suggests Clostridium perfringens infection, and >16 hours suggests an
enteroinvasive viral or bacterial infection.
Social history
Alcohol, tobacco, illicit drug use
Travel/immigration history
Recent travel to endemic areas may suggest traveler’s diarrhea, Giardia
infection, tropical sprue.
Recent immigration from a developing country raises the possibility of a
parasiticinfection.
Sexualhistory
Physical Examination

Vital signs are obtained to determine if the patient has fever,
tachycardia, and hypotension. Orthostatic blood pressure changes may
be evident with severe volume depletion from fluid loss.
General examination takes into account whether the patient is toxic
appearing and acutely ill. Cachexia and muscle wasting may indicate a
chronic process.
Volume status is assessed by examining orthostatics, mucous
membranes, and skin turgor. A history of oliguria supports volume loss.
Head and neck examination evaluates the findings of hyperthyroidism
(thyroid mass, exophthalmos) and extraintestinal manifestations of IBD
(episcleritis, mouth ulcers).
Flushing, wheezing, and cardiac murmurs can rarely be seen in secretory
diarrhea, especially carcinoid syndrome.
A detailed abdominal examination assesses for tenderness, peritoneal
signs, hepatomegaly, masses, and ascites. Surgical scars indicate past
surgery. Bowel sounds are evaluated for hyper- and hypomotility.
Anorectal examination focuses on sphincter tone/contractility, fistulas,
fissures, perianal abscess, and blood on the examining finger.
Other areas examined include the peripheries for edema, arthritis,
lymphadenopathy; skin examination for rashes and flushing, and a
neurologic examination for neurologic deficits and peripheral neuropathy.
Differential Diagnosis

54

Clinical patterns can help determine pathophysiologic mechanisms of diarrhea
as follows:
Watery diarrhea
Osmotic diarrhea decreases with fasting.
Secretory diarrhea is voluminous, with no change with fasting. Patients
may have nocturnal symptoms.
Bloody diarrhea with or without mucus
This suggests inflammatory or infectious etiologies. Patients may also
manifest systemic symptoms, fevers, fatigue, abdominal pain, tenesmus,
and nocturnal symptoms.
Fatty stool
This suggests steatorrhea. Diarrhea typically decreases with fasting and
can be foul-smelling. Stool may adhere to the toilet bowl, and the
patient may report oil droplets in the toilet water.
Functional etiologies
In IBS and other functional disorders, there is a predominance of
abdominal pain, lack of nocturnal symptoms, and lack of significant
weight loss.
Diagnostic Testing

Acute diarrhea. Testing is indicated in the presence of severe
symptoms (hypovolemia, fever, severe abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea)
but also in the elderly or immunocompromised individuals and in IBD.3
Osmotic diarrhea1,7–10
Osmotic gap can be checked and is typically >125mOsm/kg.
Stool pH helps assess for carbohydrate malabsorption when it is acidic.
Stool magnesium level can assess for excessive intake of magnesium.
Secretory diarrhea
Osmotic gap is usually normal (50mOsm/kg).
Infectious etiologies need to be excluded, as some acute infections can
induce a transient secretory pattern.
Imaging studies and endoscopy can evaluate for structural and
inflammatory diseases of the small intestine and colon.
Specialized tests can be performed to investigate for endocrinopathies
and neuroendocrine tumors.
Inflammatory diarrhea
Fecal occult blood test (FOBT) and/or fecal leukocytes can be assessed
55

in chronic diarrhea wherein both inflammatory and secretory etiologies
are being considered. These tests are consistently positive in bloody
diarrhea or where other features suggest an inflammatory etiology. If
the history, physical examination, and other testing are convincing for an
inflammatory etiology, these tests are redundant and should not be
performed.
Infectious etiologies need to be excluded, even when IBD is suspected,
as infectious superinfection can be seen.
Imaging studies and endoscopy are useful to evaluate for structural
and/or inflammatory diseases of the small intestine and colon.
Steatorrhea
Fecal fat assays are typically abnormal and the osmotic gap is >50
mOsm/kg.
Imaging studies and endoscopy are useful for evaluating structural
and/or inflammatory diseases of the small intestine and pancreas.
Investigation can be performed for evaluating pancreatic exocrine
insufficiency.
Laboratories (* = initial tests)

*Complete

blood cell count with differential. This may show
anemia, leukocytosis (infection), or eosinophila (neoplasm, allergies,
parasites, eosinophilic gastroenterocolitis).
*Comprehensive metabolic panel. This evaluates for electrolyte
abnormalities, coexistent liver disease,
hypoalbuminemia/dysproteinemia (malnutrition, protein-losing
enteropathy), or diabetes.
*TSH, fT4. This evaluates for hyperthyroidism, which can rarely cause
diarrhea on its own but can potentiate diarrhea from other causes.
Stool studies. The following studies can be performed:
Leukocytes, lactoferrin
FOBT
*Osmolarity, electrolytes (Na, K) to calculate osmotic gap
Fat. qualitative/Sudan stain versus 24-, 48-, or 72-hour quantitative
collection on a 100 g fat/day diet (6 g/24 hours is normal, >14 g/24
hours suggests malabsorption/maldigestion, >8% suggests pancreatic
insufficiency)
*Infectious. bacterial culture, Clostridium difficile toxin ×3, O&P

Laxative screen
α1-Antitrypsin. This is useful in the assessment of protein-losing
enteropathy, when stool α1-antitrypsin levels are elevated.
Chymotrypsin or elastase concentration: These are elevated in the stool
in pancreatic insufficiency
Urine studies. The following can be performed:
Urinalysis: for protein loss in the urine
Laxative screen
Secretory diarrhea. The following can be measured for the assessment
of secretory diarrhea: serum levels of VIP, gastrin, calcitonin, pancreatic
polypeptide, somatostatin, tryptase, and urinary excretion of 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid, metanephrines, and histamine, and
adrenocorticotropin stimulation test, serum protein electrophoresis,
immunoglobulins.
Celiac disease. Testing for celiac disease should be performed early for
the evaluation of chronic diarrhea: antitissue transglutaminase antibody,
deamidated gliadin peptide, IgA levels (up to 10% of patients will be IgA
deficient and have a false-negative result).
IBD and immunocompromised patients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV)
DNA polymerase chain reaction and C. difficile toxins
Rectal swab in those active in anal intercourse [gonorrhea, Chlamydia,
herpes simplexvirus(HSV)]
Imaging

The following can be performed to assess for structural/inflammatory
disease of the small intestine and pancreas:
Small bowel follow-through
CT enterography
MR enterography
Dual-phase CT scan of the pancreas
Abdominal ultrasonography
Endoscopic ultrasonography
57

Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopy with biopsies12
Upper endoscopy with small bowel biopsies (for the evaluation of celiac
disease—minimum of four duodenal biopsies, Whipple’s disease, proteinlosing enteropathy, eosinophilic gastroenteritis, giardiasis, amyloidosis)
Upper endoscopy with small bowel aspirate [small bowel bacterial overgrowth (SIBO)]
Flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with random biopsies
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is acceptable in cases of acute diarrhea with
suspicion for diffuse colitis, such as graft-versus-host disease, or chronic
diarrhea in patients with significant comorbidities or pregnancy.
Colonoscopy is preferred for evaluation of IBD, microscopic colitis,
eosinophilic colitis, amyloidosis, colorectal neoplasia or screening, HIV
patients, or in cases with significantbloodloss.
Endoscopic ultrasonography (chronic pancreatitis)
Breath tests for specific carbohydrate malabsorption (lactose, sucrose)
and SIBO (glucose, lactulose, 14C-xylose, 14C-glycocholate)
Secretin test, bentiromide test to assess for pancreatic exocrine
insufficiency

TREATMENT

Medications
Acute Diarrhea

Volume status and electrolyte disturbances need to be assessed
first.
Uncomplicated, mild acute diarrhea is treated with oral fluids containing
carbohydrates and electrolytes.
World Health Organization oral rehydration solution (3.5 g NaCl, 2.9 g
trisodium citrate or 2.5 g NaHCO3, 1.5 g KCl, and 20 g glucose or 40 g
sucrose per L) is recommended.
Pedialyte, Gatorade, and similar sports drinks may also be taken, but the
carbohydrate load is greater and the sodium content is lower.
58

In severe diarrhea, intravenous fluids (Lactated Ringer’s or 0.9% normal
saline) may be necessary to restore volume and to keep up with ongoing
losses.
Antidiarrheal agents are safe in mild to moderate diarrhea and may
improve patient comfort.
Loperamide 4 mg followed by 2 mg after each loose stool up to a
maximum daily dose of 16 mg.
Diphenoxylate plus atropine (Lomotil) 4 mg QID has combined opioid
and anticholinergic effects.
Antidiarrheal agents are not recommended in bloody or febrile cases.
Traveler’s diarrhea. Bismuth subsalicylate 30 mL QID may reduce
symptoms through anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties.
The addition of an antibiotic such as fluoroquinolone or rifaximin 200 to
400 mg PO TID ×3 days may lessen the duration and severity of the
illness.
Antibiotics. Empiric treatment with antibiotics is recommended only
when invasive bacterial infection is suspected, suggested by high fever,
tenesmus, bloody diarrhea, or fecal leukocytes. Use must be weighed
against possible risks including antibiotic resistance or other possible
complications.3,5,6
First line. Fluoroquinolone ×3 to 7 days (i.e., ciprofloxacin 500 mg BID,
norfloxacin 400 mg BID, levofloxacin 400 mg daily)
Alternatives. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, azithromycin, or
erythromycin(Table3-3)

59

Giardia/Amebiasis. Metronidazole 250 to 750 mg TID ×7 to 10 days
Cyclospora/Isospora. Trimethoprim-Sulfamethoxazole DS BID ×7 to
10 days
Antibiotic treatment is also recommended in infectious diarrhea
caused by sexually transmitted diseases, such as Chlamydia
infection, gonorrhea, HSV infection, and syphilis.
Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) or E. coli O157:H7.
Antibiotics are NOT recommended as they have not been shown to
hasten recovery or decrease the contagious period. In addition, their use
may precipitate the hemolytic–uremic syndrome. Clinical clues to EHEC
infection include recent ingestion of raw/undercooked ground meat,
bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and minimal or lack of fever.
Chronic Diarrhea

Volume status, electrolyte disturbances, and vitamin
deficiencies need to be addressed.
60

Uncomplicated, mild diarrhea is treated with oral fluids similar to that in
acute diarrhea.
In cases of severe diarrhea, intravenous fluids (lactated Ringer’s or 0.9%
normal saline) may be necessary to restore volume depletion and to
keep up with ongoing losses. Rarely, patients may require intravenous
fluids long term, administered through a permanent indwelling catheter
with the assistance of home health care nursing.
Total parenteral nutrition may be required in the hospital or long term at
home, requiring an indwelling catheter and home health care nursing.
Vitamin deficiencies may occur due to decreased oral intake or
malabsorption. Vitamin levels should be monitored and supplemented if
deficient, especially the fat-soluble vitamins in those with chronic
steatorrhea.
The underlying cause needs to be treated whenever possible.1,7–10
If there is a reversible cause such as infection, dietary precipitant,
medication, or tumors, then chronic diarrhea may potentially be resolved
with treatment or by removal of the offending agent.
Microscopic (collagenous/lymphocytic) colitis. Budesonide 9 mg
daily with slow taper. Bismuth subsalicylate, cholestyramine, and
mesalamine may also be used. In severe or refractory cases,
immunomodulators such as azathioprine or systemic steroids may be
required.
Bile acid induced diarrhea. An empiric trial of cholestyramine (a
binding resin) is both diagnostic and therapeutic. Recommended dose is
4 g TID.
Lactose intolerance. Empiric trial of avoiding dairy products is both
diagnostic and therapeutic.
Small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Clinical response to antibiotics is
often rapid; cyclical antibiotics are often necessary unless the
predisposing cause for bacterial overgrowth has been addressed.
Pancreatic enzyme replacement. A therapeutic trial may be
beneficial in steatorrhea.
Opiate antidiarrheal agents are safe in mild to moderate diarrhea.
Loperamide (Imodium) 2 to 4 mg QID or 4 mg followed by 2 mg after
each loose stool up to a maximum daily dose of 16 mg.
Diphenoxylate plus atropine (Lomotil) 4 mg QID has combined
opioid and anticholinergic effects.
61

Other more potent options include combinations of opiates with
antispasmodics, such as tincture of opium (2 to 20 drops QID) with
belladonna or hyocyamine.
Empiric treatment with antidiarrheals without extensive investigation is
appropriate for patients without alarm findings such as those with IBS.
Psyllium can be used to increase stool bulk in those with fecal
incontinence.
Octreotide (a somatostatin analogue) may be used in secretory
diarrhea to decrease the volume of stool.
Octreotide 50 to 250 mcg subcutaneous BID to TID.
Octreotide may also be used in acute postoperative diarrhea, such as
with high ostomy output.
In this scenario, a fluid-filled bowel is often mistaken for postoperative
ileus. Clues to this diagnosis are abdominal distention on examination in
the presence of significant diarrhea. Cross-sectional imaging reveals a
distended, fluid-filled bowel. Symptoms resolve rapidly with
decompression by a nasogastric tube and initiation of subcutaneous
octreotide.
Antibiotics
Empiric treatment can be considered if the patient is at high risk for
dehydration or systemic complications, in the setting of a high suspicion
of infectious cause, or if there is high prevalence of infectious diarrhea in
the community.
Metronidazole or fluoroquinolone may be used.
Surgical Management

Surgery may be indicated to treat the underlying cause, such as with
neuroendocrine tumor, severe colitis, or malignancy.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Diet

Malnutrition and vitamin deficiencies may occur due to decreased oral
intake or malabsorption.
Enteral feeds are always recommended when the gut is healthy and
functioning, but additional intravenous fluids and total parenteral
nutrition may be necessary either temporarily or long term.
62

In acute diarrhea, bowel rest or a change to a clear liquid or bland diet
that avoids high-fiber foods, fats, milk products, caffeine, and alcohol
may improve the patient’s symptoms in the short term. Dairy products
may not be well tolerated.
If there is an underlying mucosal cause for malabsorption, such as celiac
disease or disaccharidase deficiency, then the diet should be limited to
eliminate the offending agent (i.e., gluten or lactose-free diets).
Vitamin levels should be evaluated and supplemented if deficient.
Prophylactic supplementation may be recommended with daily
multivitamin, calcium, vitamin D, and B-complex.
Probiotics are not routinely recommended at this time, given the lack of
regulations and consensus on their benefits. However, these agents may
be beneficial in chronic diarrhea in the setting of IBS. Anecdotal evidence
exists for benefit in other types of chronic diarrhea.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
HIV/AIDS
Patients who are HIV positive with low CD4 counts have high risk of
chronic infectious diarrhea. Etiologies include common infectious agents
as well as opportunistic infections such as CMV and Mycobacterium
avium intracellulare. Other causes include intestinal malignancies such
as lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma, AIDS enteropathy, and medicationinduced symptoms from HAART treatment such as with nelfinavir and
ritonavir. The lack of simple diagnostic tools and directed treatment,
however, often relegates these patients to symptomatic therapy.
Inflammatory bowel disease
Antimotility agents should be used with caution in patients with severe
IBD because of the potential complication of toxic megacolon; patients
with bloody diarrhea, high fever, or systemic toxicity should not be given
anti-diarrheals. Anticholinergic agents are absolutely contraindicated in
acute diarrhea because of the rare complication of toxic megacolon.
The initial clinical presentation of IBD may be unmasked by acute
infectious diarrhea.
CMV and C. difficile infection should always be ruled out first in IBD
patients.
Pediatrics
63

Patients with symptoms suggestive of EHEC/E. coli O157:H7 should not
be treated with antibiotics, given the risk of precipitating hemolyticuremic syndrome.
Clinical clues to EHEC infection include recent ingestion of
raw/undercooked ground meat, bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain but
no or minimal fever.
Pregnancy
Listeria with or without systemic symptoms should be high in the
differential.

COMPLICATIONS
Dehydration
Acute renal failure
Electrolyte abnormalities such as metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia
Weight loss and wasting
Malnutrition such as fat-soluble vitamin A, D, E, and K deficiencies with
steatorrhea
Transient acquired mucosal digestive insufficiency such as a secondary
lactose malabsorption, following an acute gastroenteritis. This
phenomenon often manifests as persistent diarrhea, abdominal cramps,
and bloating until normal mucosal enzymatic activity is restored. These
symptoms may persist for weeks to months.
A subset of patients with an acute gastroenteritis develop a chronic
postinfectious IBS.

REFERRAL
Referral to a gastroenterologist/specialist is indicated depending on the
following:
Severity of disease
Diagnosis
Need for endoscopy
Long-term management (IBD, chronic pancreatitis)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Constipation is one of the most common gastrointestinal complaints in
the general population. It is associated with decreased work
productivity,1 decreased quality of life,2 and increased anxiety and
depression.3
Constipation encompasses a multitude of disorders and symptoms that
affect colonic and anorectal function, and a careful understanding of this
heterogeneity is essential for proper patient management.
Definition

Constipation is a symptomatically defined disorder, characterized by
infrequent stools, difficult stool passage, or both.4 Associated symptoms
often include passage of hard stools, straining, unproductive urges, and
the sensation of incomplete evacuation.
Classification

Primary versus secondary
Secondary constipation occurs as a side effect of various conditions and
medications and is important to rule out before embarking on a complex
evaluation.
Acute versus chronic
A consensus definition has been established to address the varied
components of chronic constipation (Table 4-1).

66

Epidemiology

Studies estimate the prevalence of chronic constipation between 2% and
27% in North America.4 It is the primary diagnosis or reason for visit in
approximately 2.7 million outpatient and emergency department visits
annually and is responsible for another 38,000 inpatient stays.5
More than $1 billion is spent annually on laxatives in the United States.6
Etiology

The potential etiologies of primary constipation can be generally
categorized into normal transit constipation, slow transit constipation,
pelvic floor dyssynergia, and constipation-predominant irritable bowel
syndrome. It is important to note that there is considerable overlap
between these categories.7,8
Patients with normal transit constipation have symptoms without
evidence of delayed colonic transit.
Slow transit constipation is an idiopathic entity with delayed transit
from the proximal to distal colon.
Pelvic floor dyssynergia occurs when the puborectalis and anal
sphincter muscles fail to relax or paradoxically contract with attempted
defecation, leading to an inability to defecate at the level of the
anorectum; colonic transit to the rectum can be normal in this disorder.

67

Irritable bowel syndrome is considered constipation-predominant
if the patient has 25% loose or watery stools or ≥25% hard or lumpy
stools.
Pathophysiology

Colonic and anorectal function are incompletely understood but are
thought to be influenced by various factors, including intrinsic reflexes
and autonomic processes, neurotransmitters, diurnal variation, and
learned behaviors.9
Risk Factors

Women tend to have more self-reported constipation than men, and the
prevalence of constipation increases with age.9 It has been estimated
that 50% of the elderly living in the community suffer from
constipation.10
Other risk factors include physical inactivity, malnutrition, restricted diets,
polypharmacy, recent abdominal or pelvic surgery, travel, and known
comorbid conditions.

DIAGNOSIS
68

The workup of the constipated patient requires a thorough history and
physical examination. Though not always necessary, a number of
diagnostic tests can also be performed to arrive at a diagnosis.
Clinical Presentation

Patients with constipation present with a wide range of complaints, many
of which may create substantial embarrassment for them. A trusting
relationship will aid in obtaining a clear and well-defined history.
History

A well-performed defecation history elicits whether the patient has
infrequent stools, hard stools, a sense of incomplete evacuation,
straining, need for digital disimpaction, and associated abdominal pain.
Onset and duration of symptoms are also important. For instance,
lifelong abdominal discomfort may suggest overlap with irritable bowel
syndrome.

69

FIGURE 4-1 Bristol Stool Chart. (Adapted from Lewis SJ, Heaton KW. Stool
form scale as a useful guide to intestinal transit time. Scand J Gastroenterol.
1997;32:920–924.)
The Bristol Stool Scale is the best descriptor of stool form and
consistency and can be a very useful tool (Fig. 4-1).
A complete review of symptoms will help narrow the differential
diagnosis. For example, if the patient reports cold intolerance and weight
gain, hypothyroidism should be considered. The triad of kidney stones,
confusion, and constipation suggests hypercalcemia. Current diuretic use
70

or vomiting may predispose to constipation through hypokalemia and
ileus. Esophageal dysmotility associated with constipation can be seen in
systemic sclerosis.
Colon cancer can present with obstructive symptoms, but this is typically
a late manifestation; important questions include a history of weight
loss, bloody stools, family history of colon cancer, and prior screening
colonoscopy.
A careful medication history should be obtained before embarking on an
involved workup of constipation. Numerous medications can be
associated with constipation, and simple discontinuation can lead to
resolution of symptoms.
Physical Examination

The physical examination can help identify both gastrointestinal and
extraintestinal causes of constipation. For instance, the presence of a
thyroid goiter or peripheral neuropathy may suggest an endocrine or
neurologic etiology.
Abdominal examination includes inspection for signs of previous
surgery; auscultation for the presence and frequency of bowel sounds;
and palpation to assess for distention, masses, or retained stool.
The perineal and rectal examination can provide invaluable
information. Close inspection helps detect internal hemorrhoids, fissures,
or masses. Perineal sensation and the anal wink reflex should also be
assessed. Anorectal neuromuscular function can be evaluated on digital
examination by checking the sphincter tone both at rest and with
squeeze. Gaping of the anal canal on immediate withdrawal of the finger
may suggest external anal sphincter denervation. Asking the patient to
bear down may reveal rectal prolapse, rectocele, or paradoxical
contraction. Significant pain on digital examination can imply a fissure or
ulceration.
Differential Diagnosis

Differential diagnosis is broad and includes myriad conditions and
medications as listed in Table 4-2.
Diagnostic Testing

71

No single test makes a clear diagnosis, so patients must be assessed
thoroughly on an individual basis.
Laboratories

Initial laboratory tests include basic chemistry panel with glucose,
calcium, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and complete blood cell
count. Stool should be checked for occult blood.

More specific testing for endocrinopathies, metabolic disorders, or
collagen vascular disorders should be performed only when a high
suspicion exists.
Imaging

Plain radiographs can be helpful to investigate possible ileus or
obstruction as well as to look for stool retention or megacolon. Barium
radiography can be performed if plain radiographs are suggestive of
72

megacolon, megarectum, or structural disease with luminal narrowing.
Defecography typically involves placing a small amount of barium into
the patient's rectum and then having him or her perform a series of
maneuvers. Dynamic MRI may be used instead of fluoroscopic
techniques to view the pelvis in greater detail. This can prove helpful
when previous studies are inconclusive or inconsistent with the clinical
scenario.11
Diagnostic Procedures

Flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are typically reserved for
new-onset constipation of unclear etiology, especially in the presence of
warning signs, such as weight loss, anemia, bloody stools, family history
of colon cancer, or hemoccult-positive stools. When seen in patients
older than 50 years, these signs should prompt a full workup to rule out
colorectal cancer. Other processes that can be detected on colonoscopy,
such as hemorrhoids, fissures, and stercoral ulcers, may be the result of
long-standing constipation. Melanosis coli, a brownish-black discoloration
of the bowel mucosa, is sometimes seen in the presence of chronic
anthraquinone laxative use.
Colonic transit studies can be performed to distinguish causes of
primary constipation. One type involves ingestion of radio-opaque
markers, with plain radiography performed 5 days later. If six or more
markers are left scattered throughout the colon, slow transit is
suggested. If those markers are confined to the rectosigmoid colon,
there may be an element of obstructive defecation. A new, wireless
capsule technique, called the Smart Pill, can provide similar information
while also assessing transit and pH in the stomach and small bowel.9
Anorectal manometry provides an assessment of both pressure
activity and sensation of the anorectum and its sphincters. These
measures are carefully evaluated during rest, squeeze, and bear down
maneuvers. A balloon inflation test measures the patient's symptoms at
various pressures. Finally, a balloon expulsion test can be performed to
assess the patient's ability to expel a simulated bowel movement within
an allotted amount of time, typically within 2 minutes in normal subjects.

TREATMENT

73

Initial therapy for chronic constipation involves use of dietary fiber
supplementation and laxatives.
In the event that first-line therapy fails, assessment of colonic and/or
anorectal function is appropriate before starting further medications.
Medications
First Line

Fiber supplementation can begin at 10 g/day and increased by
approximately 5 g/day each week to a total intake of approximately 25
g/day. It is important to instruct patients to maintain adequate hydration
during trials of increased fiber, as constipation can potentially worsen.
Bloating, abdominal distention, and flatulence are side effects seen with
fiber supplementation.
Osmotic laxatives, such as lactulose and mixed electrolyte solutions
(polyethylene glycol), work by osmotically increasing fluid in the bowel
lumen. Adverse effects include electrolyte imbalance, dehydration, and
urge incontinence because of the fluid volume delivered to the rectum.
Similarly, saline laxatives help attract water to the bowel lumen.
Examples are magnesium citrate, phosphate, and sulfate. Adverse
effects include dehydration, abdominal cramping, and magnesium
toxicity (avoid in renal dysfunction).
Stimulant laxatives are the most frequently prescribed laxatives. They
work by increasing colonic motility. Anthraquinones additionally increase
fluid and electrolyte content in the distal ileum and colon. Examples are
senna and bisacodyl. Adverse effects include abdominal cramping,
cathartic colon, and melanosis coli (senna, cascara).
Emollients consist of mineral oils and docusate salts. Mineral oil
penetrates the stool and softens it, whereas docusate salts lower surface
tension of stool, allowing more water through. Adverse effects include
malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins and lipid pneumonia if aspirated.
Enemas use tap water, saline, mineral oil, or sodium phosphate to
cause distal colonic distension and reflex evacuation of luminal contents.
Adverse effects include mechanical trauma and damage to rectal mucosa
with chronic use.
Second Line

74

5-hydroxytryptamine-4 (5-HT 4) receptor agonists have been
studied extensively for their prokinetic value. The older drugs in this
class, cisapride and tegaserod, have been taken off the market due to
potential cardiovascular adverse events. Instead, attention has shifted to
newer drugs in this class, such as prucalopride, which has been approved
in Europe at a dose of 2 mg/day in adults and 1 mg/day in the elderly.12
Lubiprostone, a chloride-channel activator that increases intestinal
water secretion, has been approved for use both in constipation
predominant IBS (IBS-C) and chronic constipation.13 Nausea is the most
commonly seen adverse effect.
Linaclotide is a guanylate cyclase C activator that leads to intestinal
chloride and bicarbonate secretion. Studies are ongoing, and thus far the
results have been encouraging.14
Mu-receptor antagonists that work in the periphery can be helpful in
certain, typically inpatient, situations. Methylnaltrexone, used to treat
patients with opioid-related constipation, promotes bowel movements
without decreasing the pain-relieving effects of narcotics. Alvimopan has
been used successfully in postoperative ileus.15
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Biofeedback is a type of behavioral training that has shown benefit in
the setting of defecatory disorders, both in improving symptoms and
anorectal function.16 Patients are retrained to relax their pelvic floor
muscles and restore normal anorectal synergy during defecation. This
method appears to be beneficial primarily in those with outlet
dysfunction.17
Other behavioral training includes ritualization of bowel movement
timing.9
Surgical Management

Surgical intervention can be used in patients with a structural reason for
obstructed defecation (e.g., rectocele). It is rarely used in chronic
constipation, except in the patient with colonic inertia who has failed
prolonged medical therapy.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

75

Proper fluid intake and exercise could be beneficial in patients with
constipation, though there is little evidence to support this.18

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
In the elderly, the etiology of constipation is often multifactorial and can
include comorbid illnesses, medications, and decreased mobility.18 Care
should be taken to monitor hydration and electrolytes closely, especially
in those with renal disease.
Constipation is a commonly encountered problem in pregnancy.
Oftentimes, patients can be treated with simple reassurance and proper
education.19

COMPLICATIONS
Early recognition and management of constipation is important, because
chronic constipation can lead to fecal impaction, pudendal nerve
damage, fecal incontinence, rectal prolapse, stercoral ulcers with
perforation or bleeding, volvulus, hemorrhoids, or anal fissures.
These complications tend to occur more frequently in the elderly and
nursing home residents. Early recognition of these complications is an
effective strategy to reduce morbidity in these patients.
Some complications can require surgical management, such as stercoral
ulcers with perforation, or anatomic abnormalities that obstruct
defecation (e.g., enterocele, rectocele, cystocele). Refractory slow transit
constipation or colonic inertia is sometimes managed with total
colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis, but pelvic floor dyssynergia is first
excluded in these instances.12,18
Endoscopic therapy of stercoral ulcers may be necessary to achieve
hemostasis in the setting of rectal bleeding.
Fecal impaction should always be considered in patients with chronic
constipation regardless of whether presentation involves constipation or
incontinence. Fecal impaction can lead to incontinence by invoking the
rectoanal inhibitory reflex, that is, the tendency for the internal anal
sphincter to relax in the presence of stool in the rectum. A quick digital
76

rectal examination can often help detect stool in the rectum. However,
fecal impaction sometimes occurs higher than the rectum, and absence
of stool in the rectum does not exclude the diagnosis. A plain x-ray film
of the abdomen may reveal obstructive features and lack of rectal air.
Management involves disimpaction, sometimes manually. Oil-based
enemas (cottonseed enema, mineral oil enema) may help soften the
stool and ease evacuation. Hypaque enemas may provide both diagnosis
and therapy of fecal impaction. After disimpaction, an effective oral
laxative regimen with or without rectal suppositories or enemas needs to
be established.
Abdominal pain associated with constipation can sometimes lead to
unnecessary surgeries, such as appendectomy, hysterectomy, or ovarian
cystectomy.

REFERRAL
Referral to a gastroenterologist may be warranted, especially if
specialized studies, such as anorectal manometry, are needed.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Abdominal pain is one of the most common complaints for which patients
visit primary care providers, and one of the most common reasons for
gastroenterology consult.1–3
The ability to diagnose and treat abdominal pain accurately and
efficiently is of great importance.
A general understanding of anatomy and physiology is important in
formulating a differential diagnosis.
An orderly approach is essential in the evaluation of abdominal pain,
particularly in avoiding unnecessary repetitive testing and potential
harmful delays in making the diagnosis.
Classification

Parietal pain
The parietal peritoneum lining the abdominal cavity is innervated by
somatic nerve fibers.
Therefore, the pain caused by irritation of the parietal peritoneum is
usually sharp, well localized, and lateralizes to the site of
irritation.
The most frequent stimulus is inflammation, often from an inflamed
adjacent organ or viscus.
Other stimuli that can irritate the parietal peritoneum are blood, gastric
acid, or stool.
The painis constant and worse with motion of the peritoneum.
79

Pain severity depends on the specific irritating agent and the rate of
development.
There is open associated reflex muscle spasm of the abdominal muscles
referred to as “involuntary guarding.”
When bowel perforates or when blood collects in the peritoneal cavity,
extensive stimulation of the parietal peritoneum results in a board-like
rigid abdomen, with diffuse and excruciating pain made worse
by even minimal movement.
Visceral pain
Noxious stimuli affecting the abdominal viscera result in the perception
of visceral pain.
This can result from traction on the peritoneum, distension of a hollow
viscus, or muscular contraction, often against an obstructed lumen.
The pain fibers innervating the visceral structures are bilateral, so pain is
typically perceived in the midline.
As opposed to parietal pain, visceral pain is dull and poorly localized,
often remote from the location of the abnormality.
The pain is often intermittent or colicky, but it can be constant.
There are often associated autonomic symptoms such as nausea,
vomiting, diaphoresis, or pallor.
Referred pain
Painis felt in areas distant to the diseased organ.
The pain can be well localized and felt in the skin or deeper tissues.
Examples include diaphragmatic irritation from a subphrenic hematoma
or abscess resulting in shoulder pain, pain in the thigh from a psoas
abscess, and radiation of renal colic from loin to groin. Gallbladder and
bile duct pain can also be referred to the shoulder or scapular area,
particularly on the right side.
Pathophysiology

Noxious stimuli can result in pain within the abdomen by various
mechanisms, and the characteristics of these mechanisms can help in
identifying the underlying disease process.1,3
The two principal mechanisms of pain, parietal pain and visceral pain,
are discussed below.
Other mechanisms of pain that may be relevant include ischemia,
musculoskeletal pain, referred pain, metabolic derangements,
80

neurogenic pain, and functional pain. A single diseased organ can
produce pain through multiple mechanisms.1–3

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

A thorough, detailed history and physical examination are keys to
efficient evaluation of patients with abdominal pain.
An accurate diagnosis can be made in most patients only with a
meticulous history and physical examination; however, diagnosis can
remain elusive regardless of the extensive history and physical
examination, in which case consider admission, serial examinations,
follow-up calls, or surgical exploration.
History

This is the most important part of the evaluation, thus an organized
approach is essential.
Attempts should be made to identify the pain onset, duration, character,
location, severity, exacerbating or alleviating factors, and associated
symptoms.4
Other key aspects of the history should include underlying medical
conditions, prior surgeries, medications, allergies, family history, travel,
contact with animals or sick individuals, and social history including
occupation and substance abuse. Some general features regarding these
aspects of the history are described here.4,5
Onset of pain
It is important to differentiate acute versus chronic pain.
Severe pain that begins abruptly may indicate an intra-abdominal
catastrophe, including ruptured abdominal vasculature, occluded
mesenteric vasculature, or perforated viscus. Urgent or immediate
surgery may be essential in certain situations for a good patient
outcome.
Pain that develops rapidly over minutes suggests inflammation or
luminal obstruction.
Gradual onset over hours may also suggest inflammation.
81

Duration
Pain caused by irritation of the parietal peritoneum is constant.
Obstruction of a hollow viscus typically results in crampy or colicky pain
that waxes and wanes.
Pain lasting more than 6 months is generally considered as chronic
abdominal pain and can remain undiagnosed despite extensive workup.
Character
Parietal pain is usually severe and well localized.
Pain associated with visceral noxious stimuli is dull or gnawing and
poorly localized.
Location
This is often the most important characteristic in parietal pain. The
parietal peritoneum is supplied by somatic nerves, thus pain is perceived
in the area where the peritoneum is irritated.
Visceral pain is usually midline and poorly localized, but the location may
provide useful information regarding the involved organ.
Radiation of pain may also help identify the affected organ.
Table 5-1 lists the commonly affected organs and perceived areas of
pain.
Severity/Intensity
This is very subjective and difficult to measure because it is dependent
on the individual patients' point of reference. Other factors influencing
severity include past experience of pain, personality traits, or cultural
differences.
Severe pain suggests ruptured abdominal viscus or vascular structure.
Pain that is severe in the setting of a benign examination may suggest
mesenteric ischemia.
Exacerbating and alleviating factors
Pain caused by inflammation of the peritoneum is worse with coughing
or movement.
Patients with renal or intestinal colic may move around in an attempt to
get into a comfortable position.
Eating exacerbates pain caused by gastric ulcer, chronic mesenteric
ischemia, or biliary pain but may alleviate pain caused by duodenal
ulcer.
The pain associated with pancreatitis is classically relieved by bending
forward or curling up in the fetal position.
82

Associated symptoms
Nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis, hematemesis, hematochezia, melena,
diarrhea, obstipation, hematuria, and fever may further focus the
diagnostic evaluation.
Physical Examination

As with the history, an organized approach to the physical examination,
particularly the abdomen, increases the likelihood of an accurate
diagnosis.
In addition, focusing on key extra-abdominal physical examination
findings is crucial because they may provide valuable clues as to the
diagnosis.
An exhaustive review of all the signs is beyond the scope of this chapter;
however, several points deserve emphasis.
Vital signs
Particular attention must be given to frequent hemodynamic monitoring.
The presence of tachycardia or orthostatic hypotension suggests
significant volume depletion and should prompt an immediate search for
the underlying cause (hemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, or third-spacing).
Tachycardia may be the only sign of impending hemodynamic collapse
in a patient with vascular catastrophe.
Fever suggests an inflammatory process, often infectious.
Tachypnea is often the earlier sign of sepsis.
General appearance
83

Much information can be determined by observing the patients' general
appearance.
This includes an assessment of their overall appearance, respiratory
pattern, ability to converse, position in bed, posture, and facial
expression. Facial expression should be noted also while palpating the
abdomen.
Patients with peritonitis often lie still, whereas those with renal or
intestinal colic writhe in bed.
Patients with acute inflammatory or vascular disorders frequently appear
flushed and systemically toxic.
Generalized pallor suggests severe anemia, potentially from acute blood
loss.
Abdominal examination
Patients with acute abdominal pain are very apprehensive; hence, it is
important to take a gentle, reassuring approach to the abdominal
examination.
The abdomen should be examined with the patients' knees and hips
flexed to relax the abdominal muscles.
First, the abdomen should be visually inspected for surgical scars,
distension, bulging flanks, or other obvious abnormalities.
Next, auscultate for the presence or absence of bowel sounds or bruits.
Gentle pressure with the stethoscope allows assessment of tenderness
without alarming the patient.
Palpation should begin at the site furthest away from the area of pain
and additionally noting any visceral enlargement or masses.
The presence or absence of guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness
should be noted, because these may signify peritoneal irritation.
Peritoneal inflammation is best determined by light percussion on the
abdomen, gently shaking the bed or asking the patient to cough.
Hernial orifices should be inspected and palpated in all instances, and
the patient is asked to cough to determine whether an impulse is felt on
coughing.
Digital rectal examinations may have value, not just in anal/rectal
palpation and inspecting rectal content on the examining finger but in
localizing pain.
External genitalia should be inspected, particularly the scrotum in males.
Female patients should have pelvic examinations performed when
84

appropriate.
Differential Diagnosis

The list of diagnoses that can cause abdominal pain is extensive and
includes inflammatory, mechanical, ischemic, metabolic, and neurologic
conditions.5
This emphasizes the need for a careful and systematic history and
physical examination to narrow the possible diagnoses. Table 5-2 lists
some of the common causes of abdominal pain.
Diagnostic Testing

The differential diagnosis in patients presenting with acute abdominal
pain can be determined with a careful history and physical examination;
further diagnostic evaluation should be targeted to ruling in or excluding
these conditions.5

Excessive, undirected testing increases the costs and may cause
unnecessary delays in diagnosis and treatment.
While elaborating all potential tests in the workup of abdominal pain is
beyond the scope of this handbook, a few specific tests deserve special
mention.
85

Laboratories

A complete blood cell count with differential count should be
ordered in all patients to evaluate for leucocytosis or anemia.
Serum electrolytes (including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and
glucose) are important to assess fluid status, acid-base status, and renal
function.
Amylase and lipase are useful in patients with suspected pancreatic
disease, but note that these can also be elevated in patients with bowel
obstruction or perforation and in patients with renal failure where
clearance may be slow.
Lactate levels may be helpful for suspected bowel infarction, but a
normal level does not exclude intestinal ischemia.
Liver chemistries should be obtained in patients with upper abdominal
pain and those with known liver disease.
Coagulation profile should be checked in those with suspected liver
disease.
All female patients of childbearing age should have pregnancy excluded
with a urine or serum beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (β-hCG).
Imaging

Standard radiography
Not all patients with acute abdominal pain require plain or upright films
of the abdomen.
However, if ordered they should include two views of the abdomen: one
in supine and one in the upright position.
If the patient is unable to sit up, then a lateral decubitus with left side
down may identify abnormal gas pattern.
Abdominal x-ray films are useful for diagnosing perforated viscus
(identified as free air under the diaphragm), ileus or bowel
obstruction.
Abdominal films may also demonstrate the calcific changes associated
with chronic pancreatitis as well as calcium-containing renal stones.
In addition, some features of intestinal inflammation, such as colonic
“thumbprinting,” may be perceived on abdominal x-ray films.
The sensitivity of abdominal radiography in the diagnosis of abdominal
pathology in the setting of acute abdominal pain is about 10%; however,
they are safe, relatively inexpensive, and can usually be performed
86

quickly and thus should be considered.6
Ultrasonography
This is the preferred initial imaging test in biliary tract disease
and gallstones. It is frequently obtained in patients with suspected
acute cholecystitis, biliary colic, choledocholithiasis, and cholangitis.
Transabdominal ultrasound is also useful for patients with abdominal
aortic aneurysms; ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and ovarian
or testicular torsion.
Ultrasonography is safe and can be performed at the bedside in most
cases.
Computed tomography (CT)
Abdominal CT, especially with rapid spiral scanning techniques, provides
a powerful imaging tool.6
CT allows “three-dimension” imaging of the entire abdomen and pelvis.
CT is less operator-dependent than the ultrasound.
CT is a sensitive test for identifying bowel obstruction, inflammatory
processes (appendicitis, necrotizing pancreatitis, diverticulitis, intraabdominal abscess), vascular lesion (ruptured aortic aneurysm, portal
vein thrombosis), and abdominal or retroperitoneal hemorrhage.
Organ-specific protocols require focused helical CT, which requires
coordination of oral/IV contrast and image attainment. This is useful to
assess perforated viscus or differentiate ischemic, traumatic, or
neoplastic lesions of the pancreas or the liver.
CT arteriography is another useful tool in assessing the aorta and
visceral vasculature.
Patient selection for CT imaging is of great importance, as this can be
costly and unnecessarily delay diagnosis and treatment especially in
patients who require urgent surgery. There is also the risk of
nephrotoxicity and anaphylactic reaction that can occur with iodinated
contrast dye.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
This is a multiplanar imaging modality using the different intrinsic soft
tissue contrast properties to distinguish areas with different degrees of
enhancement.7
MRI can detect subtle lesions that do not conform to organ contours with
high sensitivity.
MRI is an excellent modality in the evaluation and differentiation of liver
87

and pancreatic lesions.
MRI is highly sensitive in evaluating the mesenteric vessels in suspected
ischemia.
MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has become the noninvasive
imaging modality of choice for evaluating abnormalities of the biliary and
pancreatic ducts.
MR enterography has been used to image the small bowel and colon to
detect inflammation, strictures, and fistulae.
Advantages over CT:
MRI is safer in children and pregnant women because of lack of ionizing
radiation.
The intravenous contrast medium typically used (gadolinium) is thought
to carry less risk of nephrotoxicity.
Disadvantages:
MRI cannot be used in patients with permanent pacemakers,
defibrillators, aneurysm clips, or metallic implants/devices.
MRI is not suited for patients with severe claustrophobia because it is
performed in a “closed tube”; open MRIs can be considered in such
situations.
MRI is more costly, time consuming, and requires greater patient
cooperation thus making it less desirable in an urgent setting.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopy
Endoscopy is useful in evaluation of the esophagus, stomach, small
bowel, and colon for ulceration, neoplasia, ischemia, or inflammation.
However, bowel integrity has to be intact before performing endoscopy,
as air and intestinal content can be pushed into the peritoneal cavity if
endoscopy is performed where bowel integrity is compromised by
perforation or extensive inflammation. Procedure risk needs to be
balanced with potential benefits before performing endoscopy in acute
abdominal pain presentations; it remains a very useful test in patients
with chronic pain.7
Peritoneal aspiration or lavage
A peritoneal tap is a useful adjunct for detecting hemoperitoneum from
trauma or feculent material from hollow viscus injury/perforation.
Peritoneal taps are also performed for evaluation of peritoneal fluid
88

accumulation, particularly in determining portal hypertension as an
etiology, and in evaluating for infectious or spontaneous bacterial
peritonitis (see also Chapters 10 and 19).
Urgent surgical intervention via laparoscopy or exploratory
laparotomy is warranted in patients with intra-abdominal catastrophes
such as ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or ruptured intra-abdominal
organ. Surgical exploration is sometimes performed in severe abdominal
pain presentations wherein significant pathology is suspected, especially
mesenteric ischemia.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Acute gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a common medical emergency
resulting in significant morbidity, mortality, and >300,000
hospitalizations in the United States per year.1
GIB involves a spectrum of clinical presentations based on the cause and
site of bleeding. It can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract
from the mouth to the anus.
This chapter discusses the etiologies, diagnostic strategies, and
management of acute GIB.
Classification

GIB can be subdivided into upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB)
and lower gastrointestinal bleeding (LGIB), based on location of the
source in relationship to the ligament of Treitz. UGIB originates proximal
and LGIB originates distal to the ligament of Treitz. With the advent of
newer investigative modalities targeting the small bowel, LGIB can be
further characterized to small bowel bleeding (middle GIB) and
colonic bleeding.
Epidemiology

Most GIB episodes are self-limited and require only supportive therapy.
Despite this, GIB accounts for 16,000 to 20,000 deaths annually. 1
The annual incidence of hospitalization for UGIB has declined over recent
years; incidence is ~82 per 100,000 population. In contrast, although
90

LGIB is known to have a lower incidence of hospitalization, incidence has
been increasing and is estimated to be 44 per 100,000 population.1
It is well established that hospitalization and mortality rates for both
UGIB and LGIB increase with age, but recent data also suggest gender
differences, with males having higher incidence of UGIB than females,
and females being older than males at the time of LGIB occurrence.2
Etiology

Upper gastrointestinal bleeding
Erosive/Ulcerative disease
Peptic ulcer disease. This includes gastric and duodenal ulcers. Peptic
ulcer disease (PUD) is the most common cause of acute UGIB accounting
for up to 50% of cases.
Risk factors include Helicobacter pylori infection, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) use, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) use, and acid
hypersecretion as in Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Helicobacter pylori
infection and NSAID use are the two most common causes of PUD.

In patients taking NSAIDs, cofactors such as age (>75 years), concurrent
coronary artery disease, previous GIB, and a history of PUD may be
independent risk factors for ulcer bleeding.
Predictors for mortality include age >70 years, multiple comorbidities,
systolic blood pressure 100 mm Hg, hematemesis on presentation, ulcer
91

rebleeding, and requirement for surgery.
Studies have shown that the endoscopic appearance of ulcers is strongly
associated with rebleeding, need for surgery, and mortality ( Table 6-1 ).
Despite therapeutic advances, bleeding ulcer–related mortality rate has
remained at ~10%. 3 – 6
Erosive and hemorrhagic gastropathy. Gastric erosion can be
defined as a 3- to 5-mm break in the mucosa that does not penetrate to
the muscularis mucosa. This is most commonly the result of medications
such as NSAIDs or ASA, which can cause a hemorrhagic gastropathy
within 24 hours of administration.
Stress ulcers are distinct from peptic ulcers and occur in the setting of
severe medical illness/physiologic stress. The pathophysiology is thought
to be related to gastric hypoperfusion as a result of splanchnic
vasoconstriction during physiologic stress. 3
Esophagitis. Causes include gastric reflux, infections (i.e.,
cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, Candida albicans infection),
medications/pill-induced (quinidine, tetracycline, alendronate), radiation
therapy, and eosinophilic infiltration. This rarely leads to severe
bleeding. Common presenting symptoms include heartburn, nausea,
epigastric discomfort, and chest pain. 3
Portal hypertension
Variceal bleeding. Variceal hemorrhage can originate from
esophageal, gastric, and duodenal varices.
Varices are the result of portosystemic collateral circulation (with a
portosystemic gradient >12 mm Hg) in patients with cirrhosis, portal or
hepatic vein thrombosis, congenital hepatic fibrosis, and schistoso miasis.
In the United States, alcoholic cirrhosis is the most common cause of
portal hypertension.
Esophageal varices account for ~5% to 30% of UGIB cases. The 1-year
incidence rate of a first variceal hemorrhage is 5% for large varices and
15% for small varices.
Primary risk factors for bleeding from varices include size and wall
thickness, presence of endoscopic stigmata such as red signs, severity of
liver disease, and portal pressure.
The estimated mortality from an episode of variceal bleeding has
decreased over the past 2 decades from 30%–50% to ~20%. 7–9
Portal hypertensive gastropathy. This is characterized by congestion
92

of the gastric mucosa from dilated arterioles and venules mainly in the
gastric fundus and cardia. Erythema, petechiae, multiple bleeding areas,
vascular ectasias, and congestion are hallmarks. The endoscopic
appearance is often described as a mosaic pattern. 10
Vascular malformations
Vascular ectasias account for 5% to 10% of UGIB.
Vascular ectasias include isolated arteriovenous malformations and
diffuse linear vascular ectasia known as gastric antral vascular ectasia or
“watermelon stomach.”
Vascular ectasia are formed by a complex tangle of arteries and veins
connected by one or more fistulae. The vascular complex is known as the
nidus, which is lacking a capillary bed and, therefore, arteries directly
drain into veins. The draining veins are known to dilate secondary to
high-velocity blood flow and can eventually rupture, resulting in a bleed.
Vascular ectasias have been associated with various medical conditions
including chronic renal failure, valvular heart disease, congestive heart
failure, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and von Willebrand’s
disease. 11
Dieulafoy’s lesion. This is an aberrant vessel protruding through the
mucosa without an underlying ulcer. This represents 5% of UGIB cases.
11

Traumatic
Mallory-Weiss tear. This is classically associated with vomiting or
retching and is characterized by mucosal disruption at the
gastroesophageal junction. This is responsible for 5% to 15% of all
cases of UGIB and is self-limited in the majority of cases with very rare
recurrence (0% to 7%). 3 The tear usually heals within a few days;
however, continued vomiting and retching can lead to esophageal
rupture (Boerhaave’s syndrome).
Other etiologies
Foreign body ingestion
Hemobilia. This is characterized by bleeding into the duodenum from
the biliary tract. It is usually caused by trauma but can be seen in
malignant tumors, cholelithiasis, acalculous inflammatory disease, or
vascular disorders.
Tumors. Benign tumors such as GI stromal tumors can bleed when the
tumor outgrows its blood supply and ulcerates. Malignant tumors such as
93

esophageal, gastric, and duodenal cancers can also bleed. Bleeding from
malignant tumors may not be amenable to endoscopic therapeutic
measures or vascular embolization, and surgical resection or radiation
therapy may be required.
Aortoenteric fistulas. These can occur as a late complication after
aortic graft surgery and usually involve the third and fourth parts of the
duodenum. The fistulas can be difficult to diagnose because visualization
of the graft eroding through the intestinal wall is uncommon. The classic
“herald bleed” is a small bleed that can occur days to weeks before
massive fatal hemorrhage.

94

Hemosuccus pancreaticus. This is characterized by hemorrhage into
the pancreatic duct and occurs primarily in patients with chronic
pancreatitis, pseudocyst, pancreatic cancer, aneurysms of the splenic
artery, or trauma. 11
Lower gastrointestinal bleeding (Table 6-2)
Diverticular bleeding. It is the most common cause of major LGIB in
the United States, related to the high prevalence of diverticulosis.
Diverticula form at sites of weakness in the muscle wall of the colon
where arteries penetrate the muscularis layer to reach the mucosa or
submucosa.
Anorectal disease. Hemorrhoids and anal fissures are common
causes of minor intermittent LGIB. The characteristic clinical history of
hemorrhoidal bleeding is bright red blood on the toilet tissue or around
the stool but not mixed in the stool. Bleeding often occurs with straining
or passage of hard stool. A similar history is common in patients with
bleeding from anal fissures, with the exception that anal fissures are
often painful.
Ischemic colitis. It is typically caused by “low flow states” and small
vessel disease rather than large vessel occlusion and most commonly
involves the splenic flexure, descending colon, and sigmoid colon. Most
cases resolve spontaneously with observation and medical support.
Surgery is reserved for the rare circumstance of clinical deterioration with
fever and rising leukocyte count or persistent hemorrhage.
Infectious colitis. Pathogens such as Campylobacter jejuni, Shigella
species, invasive Escherichia coli or E. coli O157:H7, and, rarely,
Clostridium difficile may cause bloody diarrhea. Cytomegalovirus can
cause invasive disease characterized by ulcers that can bleed but limited
to immunocompromised states (immunosuppressive of biologic therapy
for inflammatory bowel disease, after organ transplant, AIDS, etc.). The
degree of blood loss is variable and rarely significant except with
anticoagulation or coagulopathy.
Radiation-induced proctopathy and colopathy. Radiation injury is
a chronic or recurrent problem that may follow irradiation immediately or
present several years later. Radiation impairs the normal course of
repopulation of surface epithelium within the GI tract. The loss of
absorptive surface can often lead to malabsorption and diarrhea, but
microulcerations can also form. These microulcerations can coalesce
95

and form bigger lesions and eventually result in a GI bleed. Alternatively,
telangiectasia can form in the mucosa, which can also bleed—this
mechanism is typically seen as radiation proctopathy after radiation for
prostate cancer. Blood loss is rarely massive but can cause iron
deficiency or the need for intermittent blood transfusion.
Inflammatory bowel disease. It usually causes a small to moderate
degree of bleeding, although rarely it can be massive. The blood is
usually mixed with the stool and is associated with other symptoms of
the disease, such as diarrhea, tenesmus, and pain.
Other less common causes
Meckel’s diverticulum. Meckel’s diverticulum is the most frequent
congenital anomaly of the intestinal tract, with an incidence of 0.3% to
3.0% in autopsy reports. It develops from incomplete obliteration of the
vitel-line duct, leaving an ileal diverticulum. Patients present with
painless bleeding that may be melenic or bright red. The diagnosis can
be made by radiolabeled technetium scanning. Barium filling of the
diverticulum may occur, especially with enteroclysis. Surgical excision is
the treatment of choice.
Intussusception. Uncommon in adults, it usually has a leading point,
such as a polyp or malignancy. Patients often present with bloody stools
mixed with mucus, often described as “currant jelly.” The diagnosis may
be made by plain abdominal x-ray films and a sausage-shaped mass
found during physical examination. Barium enema may be useful for
diagnosis; in children, it may be used for therapeutic reduction.
Treatment of intussusception in adults is usually surgical. 12–14

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The localization of acute GIB should begin with an assessment of the
patient’s hemodynamic status, and a focused history and physical
examination (Table 6-3). However, these measures will not be
diagnostic of the source of blood loss and further investigation, typically
including endoscopy and/or radiologic imaging may be required. 15

96

Physical Examination

Digital rectal examination. This has been recommended as a part of
the initial evaluation in patients with acute LGIB and, in fact, may prove
helpful in providing information regarding anorectal pathology prior to
any endoscopic intervention. However, a digital examination does not
preclude the need for endoscopic evaluation. One study found that 40%
of rectal carcinomas diagnosed by proctoscopy were palpable on digital
rectal examination. 16
Nasogastric aspiration. This should be performed if an upper GI source
is suspected or if patients have hematochezia with hemodynamic
compromise (as UGIB is detected in 10% to 15% of patients presenting
with severe hematochezia). A positive gastric aspirate (frank blood,
pinkish fluid, or dark “coffee ground” fluid) indicates that bleeding has
occurred proximal to the jejunum. A negative aspirate does not rule out
an UGIB. In fact, up to 18% of patients with UGIB have a nonbloody
aspirate. 17 Hemoccult testing of a clear or nonbloody gastric aspirate
does not add to the evaluation, and visual inspection has better value.
97

Diagnostic Procedures

Upper endoscopy. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is the
preferred method for evaluating patients with UGIB. Endoscopy
allows direct visualization of the mucosa and identification of the
bleeding site.
Endoscopy within the first 24 hours of presentation is the goal in UGIB,
and endoscopy is recommended as soon as the patient is clinically stable
when active ongoing bleeding is suspected. Since 10% of severe
hematochezia presentations with hemodynamic compromise can be the
result of UGIB, upper endoscopy is indicated as the first step in the
evaluation of such presentations.
Total cost of hospitalization, length of hospitalization, and need for
emergent surgery have all been greatly reduced with early endoscopy,
largely because of the therapeutic options available to the endoscopist
(i.e., heater probe, argon plasma coagulation, epinephrine injection,
band ligation). Definitive diagnosis is made when active bleeding,
stigmata of bleeding, or significant lesions are seen. 11
Early endoscopy (i.e., within 24 hours of admission) has not been
demonstrated to decrease mortality.
It is important that the hemodynamically unstable patient be adequately
volume resuscitated and any coagulopathy be corrected before
performing upper endoscopy.
Morbidity and mortality rates from upper endoscopy have been reported
at 1% and 0.1%, respectively.
Contraindications for endoscopy include an agitated patient, perforated
viscus, and severe cardiopulmonary disease.
Colonoscopy. Colonoscopy is the most frequently used diagnostic
tool for evaluating LGIB.
A diagnosis is made in 75% to 100% of patients depending on the
definition of the bleeding source, patient selection criteria, and timing of
colonoscopy. 18
For an optimal procedure, patients should be adequately resuscitated,
hemo-dynamically stable, and free of stool and debris with bowel
preparation.
With regard to timing of colonoscopy, recent data suggest that the use
of urgent colonoscopy does not improve clinical outcome or lower
hospital costs as compared with routine elective colonoscopy.
98

As many as 10% of hematochezia presentations associated with
hemodynamic compromise may be due to an upper GI bleeding source.
Therefore, under these circumstances, an upper endoscopy may be
indicated as the first step in the evaluation of severe hematochezia. It is
widely accepted that once an upper GI source has been excluded, the
next step in evaluation of a patient with severe hematochezia is
generally a colonoscopy, followed by capsule endoscopy to evaluate the
small bowel if colonoscopy is unrevealing.
Capsule endoscopy. Although upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are
the standard tools utilized to evaluate acute GIB, visualization of the
entire small bowel is easily performed with standard endoscopy. Capsule
endoscopy serves a crucial role in the initial evaluation of the
small bowel. In cases when small bowel bleeding is suspected, or when
findings on upper endoscopy and colonoscopy are negative, capsule
endoscopy can be used for further visualization of the small bowel. The
diagnostic yield has been shown to be as high as 92% in carefully
selected obscure GIB cases.
Tagged red blood cell scan. The technetium 99m–labeled red blood
cell (RBC) scan can be used as a bedside evaluation of active lower GIB.
Bleeding must exceed a rate of 0.1 mL/minute to be detected. The
procedure is of very low risk; however, the test is positive 50% of the
time. One use of this procedure is as a screening test before
angiography. A patient with a negative tagged RBC scan is unlikely to
have a positive angiogram. If the test finding is negative, a colonoscopy
is usually warranted for further evaluation of possible bleeding sources in
the colon.
Angiography. Angiography offers accurate diagnosis and therapy in the
rapidly bleeding patient. Bleeding rates of 0.5 to 1 mL/minute are
required to detect extravasation into the bowel from a bleeding site. The
overall diagnostic yield from arteriography ranges from 40% to 78%. If a
bleeding source is identified, therapeutic modalities, such as infusion of
vasopressin or selective embolization, can be used to stop bleeding.
Complications of this procedure include contrast allergy, bleeding from
arterial puncture, and embolism from dislodged thrombus. Arteriography
should be reserved for those patients with massive, ongoing LGIB for
which colonoscopy is not feasible, for suspected massive small bowel
bleeding, and for UGIB where endoscopy either fails or is unable to
99

localize the source because of rapid bleeding. 19
Other newer modalities. Computerized tomography angiography
is an emerging tool in the evaluation of the actively bleeding patient
with suspected small bowel or colonic bleeding. This modality may have
utility as the initial test in clinically unstable patients who cannot be
sedated for endoscopy, as yields are expected to be higher than with
tagged RBC scans.

TREATMENT
Resuscitation
Intravascular volume should be restored initially with either
isotonic saline or lactated Ringer’s solution. Two large-bore (≥ 18gauge) intravenous (IV) lines should be in place at all times. Centrally
inserted, triple lumen catheters are typically placed. Although these may
not confer an advantage over peripheral IV lines in terms of rate of fluid
administration, they may be easier to place in the setting of vascular
collapse or hypotension where peripheral veins are collapsed.
Blood transfusion with packed red blood cells is the method of
choice for volume resuscitation in patients with severe GI hemorrhage.
All patients who are admitted for GIB should be typed and crossed, and
cross-matched blood should be transfused when possible. In the case of
catastrophic bleeding, however, O-negative units should be used without
delay. The target hematocrit is 25%, although in patients with coronary
disease, a hematocrit of 30% is desirable. In the case of variceal
hemorrhage, target transfusion goal is hemoglobi ~8 g/dL, as
overtransfusion can lead higher rates of rebleeding and mortality (Table
6-4). Coagulopathy should be corrected with fresh frozen plasma in the
unstable patient, but subcutaneous vitamin K (5 to 10 mg) can be used if
the patient is hemodynamically stable. Heparin drips and other
anticoagulants should be discontinued and protamine used for reversal, if
necessary. If the patient is at risk for aspiration, consider endotracheal
intubation to protect the airway. It is often required for management of
variceal bleeding.
Medications

100

Nonvariceal UGIB
IV histamine-2 receptor antagonists. These have not been shown
to reduce surgery requirements or mortality rates. These agents are,
therefore, not recommended in the actively bleeding patient.
Proton pump inhibitors. Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) have been
found to reduce rates of further bleeding, surgery, and deaths
caused by ulcer complications. The current standard of care is to
administer IV PPIs either as intermittent bolus doses or as an infusion for
the first 48 to 72 hours. High-dose (double-dose bid) oral PPI therapy is
also of value and can be used when IV PPI is unavailable, or if clinical
active bleeding has ceased. It is unclear whether PPI therapy affects
mortality despite obvious benefits to morbidity from UGIB. 20
PPIs in prophylaxis of GIB in NSAID and ASA users. Therapy
should be tailored according to risk. American College of Gastrenterology
practice guidelines recommend treatment according to risk stratification:
low-, moderate-, and high-risk groups. Included in this risk stratification
are factors such as age >65, concurrent medications (ASA, high-dose
NSAIDs, corticosteroids, or anticoagulants), history of ulcer(s), and
Helicobacter pylori infection. Low-risk patients, those without risk
factors, should not receive prophylactic PPI therapy. Conversely, PPIs are
indicated in those patients at moderate (one to two risk factors) and
high risk (more than two risk factors or history of ulcer complications) for
peptic ulcer(s) and associated complications. 21
PPIs in prophylaxis of GIB in clopidogrel and ASA users. A recent
randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial found a significant
reduction in UGIB in patients on dual therapy with clopidogrel and ASA
who were randomized to receive prophylactic omeprazole. Importantly,
there was no significant increase in cardiovascular events or mortality
with the use of combination clopidogrel and PPI in this study. 22
Variceal UGIB
Vasoconstrictors. Several vasoconstricting agents are available and
are uniformly effective in reducing variceal bleeding rates in the short
term (Table 6-4). These agents produce splanchnic vasoconstriction and
thus decrease portal blood inflow. Randomized controlled trials
comparing different vasoconstrictor agents (vasopressin, somatostatin,
terlipressin, octreotide, vapreotide), show no difference in control of
hemorrhage and early rebleeding. Octreotide has the most favorable
101

side effect profile and is therefore the agent of choice in the United
States. The recommended dose is 50 mcg IV bolus, followed by
continuous infusion of 50 mcg/hour for 3 to 5 days (Table 6-4).

Antibiotic prophylaxis. It is recommended that all patients with
variceal hemorrhage receive antibiotic prophylaxis for 3 to 7 days to
prevent development of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Regimens
typically include ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Variceal UGIB
Endoscopic variceal ligation, which involves banding of the base of
the varix, is the treatment of choice in acute variceal bleeding. Rubber
bands are placed using a device attached through the instrument
channel of the upper endo-scope, which interrupt blood flow in the
variceal column. This mode of therapy is used both for hemostasis in
actively bleeding esophageal varices and for prophylaxis of variceal
bleeding in patients with large varices. In the latter instance, repeat
102

band ligation is performed every 4 to 8 weeks till all visible varices are
obliterated, following which the patient is screened for recurrence every
6 to 12 months. Band ligation is easy to perform and is associated with
lower complication rates than sclerotherapy, although rebleeding rates
and mortality may not be different. 23
Sclerotherapy. This involves injection of a variety of sclerosing agents
(ethanolamine oleate, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, polidocanol, morrhuate
sodium, or ethanol) directly into the varix, achieves hemostasis in >90%
of cases. Recurrent bleeding within 10 days occurs in up to 50% of
patients, however, and side effects of therapy include fever, ulceration,
strictures, perforation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and sepsis.
This form of therapy is currently limited to refractory bleeding,
unavailability of endoscopic band ligation, or gastric varices where band
ligation cannot be performed.
Rescue management of variceal hemorrhage
Balloon tamponade. Balloon tamponade should be restricted to patients
with controllable bleeding for whom definitive therapy is planned within
24 hours. Either the Sengstaken-Blakemore tube or the Minnesota tube,
both of which have gastric and esophageal balloons, can be used. In
contrast, the Linton-Nachlas tube has only a large gastric balloon and
can be considered for isolated gastric variceal bleeding. Hemostasis is
achieved 70% to 90% of the time. Complications can be severe and
include esophageal perforation, aspiration, chest pain, erosion, agitation,
and death from asphyxiation from balloon migration with airway
occlusion.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt. This is reserved for
patients with intractable variceal bleeding or if bleeding recurs after two
or more unsuccessful endoscopic attempts at treatment of esophageal
varices. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) creates a
direct portosystemic shunt, thereby decreasing pressure within the portal
system. Technical success is achieved >90% of the time, but
complications include hepatic encephalopathy (in as many as 25% of
patients), shunt stenosis, shunt thrombosis, and rebleeding. When TIPS
is used in emergency situations, in-hospital mortality is around 10%, and
30-day mortality rate as high as 40%. Contraindications for TIPS include
portal vein thrombosis, inferior vena cava obstruction, and polycystic
liver disease.
103

Surgical shunts. These are rarely used because of the availability of
TIPS procedures. Portacaval and distal splenorenal shunts achieve
hemostasis 95% of the time but are associated with a high rate of
postprocedural encephalopathy; mortality rates of 50% to 80% are
reported, largely because of severe underlying liver disease. Surgical
shunts are sometimes considered in noncirrhotic portal hypertension and
patients with Child’s A cirrhosis. 23
Therapeutic upper endoscopy
There are myriad techniques employed to achieve hemostasis and
prevent recurrence of UGIB, namely, injection, ablative, and/or
mechanical therapy (Table 6-5).24 Use of a combination of any two of
these methods, most commonly injection therapy followed by either
ablative or mechanical therapy, has been associated with a dramatic
reduction in the risk of ongoing and recurrent bleeding. Studies suggest a
risk reduction from 80% to ~15% for an actively bleeding ulcer and from
50% to ~10% for an ulcer with nonbleeding visible vessel. 25,26
Therapeutic colonoscopy
Endoscopic therapy is applied in 10% to 40% of patients undergoing
104

colon-oscopy, and immediate hemostasis is achieved in 50% to 100% of
these cases.18
Endoscopic therapy options are similar to those used in upper endoscopy
and include thermal coagulation (heater probe, bipolar or multipolar
coagulation, argon plasma coagulation), and injection of vasoconstrictors
and sclerosants. Placement of metallic hemoclips has also been
successful in the treatment of diverticular bleeding.
Angiotherapy
When angiographic localization of bleeding is achieved, two modalities
of therapy can be instituted directly into the bleeding vessel: vasopressin
infusion and embolization. Vasopressin infusion is typically used in
bleeding sources in the colon or small bowel, with the intent to induce
vasospasm and, consequently, clotting and hemostasis. With
superselective cannulation of the bleeding vessel, embolization with coils
or gelfoam can be highly successful in both UGIB and LGIB, with low risk
of ischemic changes in the affected bowel segment.
Surgical Management

The role of surgery is as a salvage therapy in the small group of patients
in whom bleeding cannot be controlled with endoscopic therapy and/or
angio-therapy. In both UGIB and LGIB, surgery should not be postponed
excessively in the patient with persistent bleeding and hemodynamic
instability because morbidity and mortality increase with delay.
Surgery for UGIB. Surgery is indicated in patients in whom arterial
bleeding cannot be controlled during initial endoscopy. However, in
patients in whom bleeding recurs after initial endoscopic hemostasis, the
management decision is more challenging and the data are conflicting.
Some studies support a second endoscopic attempt at hemostasis,
whereas others support immediate surgery or angiographic embolization.
Surgical series have suggested that high-risk patients (ulcers ≥2 cm
located at the lesser curvature or posterior duodenum, shock at
presentation, and/or elderly with comorbidities) require aggressive
postendoscopic management. Operative mortality following failed
endoscopic therapy in some series has been as high as 25%. However,
this varies with operator and institution experience in management
bleeding peptic ulcers. 27
Surgery for LGIB. Accurate preoperative localization of LGIB reduces
105

postoperative rebleeding rates. Surgical mortality rates from recent
series are 5% to 10%. For the difficult situation of recurrent massive
bleeding without demonstration of a bleeding site, a subtotal colectomy
may be indicated in patients with a good overall prognosis. When the
patient is a high-risk surgical candidate, angiotherapy or a
percutaneously or surgically placed portal-hepatic shunt for variceal
bleeding can be considered as alternatives. 13,14

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Prokinetics in UGIB
A recent meta-analysis showed that IV erythromycin or
metoclopramide immediately before EGD significantly reduces the
need for a repeat EGD. These agents promote gastric emptying and thus
administration can improve visualization by evacuation of stomach
contents (blood, clot, fluid). 28

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Occult and obscure gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding ranks among the most
common reasons for referral to a gastroenterologist. These can often
present significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, causing much
frustration to both patients and their physicians.1–4
In this chapter, the causes, diagnostic approaches, and treatment
options for both occult and obscure GI bleeding are discussed.
Definition

Occult bleeding is defined as either a positive fecal occult blood test
(FOBT) or iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) without other evidence of visible
blood in the stool. GI bleeding is the most common cause of IDA,
especially in men and postmenopausal women.1,2,5
Obscure bleeding refers to GI bleeding that persists or recurs, with no
identifiable origin after initial endoscopic evaluation. It can present in
both the obscure-occult or obscure-overt forms depending on the
presence of visible blood.1,2

DIAGNOSIS

Occult Bleeding

An extensive list of disorders can cause occult GI bleeding, with or without
109

IDA. Table 7-1 lists the common causes of occult blood loss.
Clinical Presentation

Although, by definition, no known symptoms exist for occult GI bleed, the
association with new abdominal symptoms, changes in bowel movements, dietary
alterations, or constitutional symptoms remains important.
History

In particular, careful attention must be paid to medication history, especially
over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Symptoms such as
fatigue, exertional dyspnea, tachycardia, and pica suggest possible IDA.6
Physical Examination

Physical findings of IDA are rare in developed countries but may include brittle
nails with longitudinal furrows or spooning (koilonychia), glossitis, cheilitis, and
atrophic rhinitis. The Patterson-Kelly or Plummer-Vinson syndrome of postcricoid
esophageal webs and IDA may occur. A GI source must be assumed in the
evaluation of IDA, in the absence of menorrhagia, gross hematuria, or other obvious
etiologies.

Diagnostic Criteria

110

Fecal occult blood tests
Although useful for initial screening, a positive FOBT does not always
indicate true disease. False-positive results can occur because of diet,
medications, or trauma while obtaining a sample. In fact, physiologic
bleeding of up to 1.5 mL/ day can occur in healthy patients. The four
basic types of FOBT are as follows2,7:
Guaiac (hemoccult) test is widely available, simple, and inexpensive,
and thus most commonly used. It is a qualitative test and provides little
quantitative information. A colorless compound obtained from tree bark
that turns blue with peroxidase-like substances, such as heme and
hydrogen peroxide, guaiac detects free heme or heme bound to its
apoprotein (e.g., globin, myoglobin, and certain cytochromes). Heme
degradation products that may form with more proximal (upper GI)
bleeding are not detected. Because guaiac reacts with any peroxidase
substance, the test can give false-positive results with red meats or
blood-containing foods, as well as plant peroxidases such as that found
in radish. Iron, however, does not cause false-positive results. Vitamin C
can cause a false-negative result.
The radiochromium-labeled erythrocyte test remains the accepted
gold standard for quantifying GI blood loss. It has limited clinical utility,
however, because of cost, complexity, and requirement of ≥3 days of
stool collection.
Immunochemical tests use antibodies against human hemoglobin.
They do not react with free heme and thus, require no dietary
restrictions before the test. Some of these tests may also provide
quantitative information. Because these antibodies interact with the
globin chain, they are only useful for colorectal bleeding, because globin
from gastric bleeding is degraded.
Heme porphyrin assay (HemoQuant) is a quantitative fluorometric
assay of both heme and its degradation products. Although it has the
advantage of detecting proximal bleeds, it is a complex test that requires
confirmation inareference laboratory.
Diagnostic Testing and Procedures

Endoscopic evaluation remains the primary means of investigation in occult GI
bleeding, because it allows direct visualization of the mucosa, tissue sampling, and
therapeutic intervention.2,8
111

Both colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) can
be performed during the same endoscopic session for a complete
evaluation to eliminate the need for repeat sedation.
Colonoscopy is typically performed first, especially in patients older than
50 years, because current colon cancer screening guidelines recommend
evaluation of the colon after positive FOBT in this group of patients.
Current data support proceeding with EGD after a negative colonoscopy
result, because the upper GI tract has been shown to be a significant
source for occult bleeding.
Often, endoscopy is required after an abnormal radiographic study.
Therefore, it is preferable to perform endoscopy as the initial test
whenever possible.
Because most cases of occult bleeding with no clear source do not evolve
into obscure bleeding, further testing beyond initial endoscopy is
generally not indicated even if no cause is identified. In these
cases, the patients should receive iron supplementation and be closely
monitored for a response. If IDA is profound at the outset, if it persists
despite oral iron supplementation, if bleeding recurs, or if FOBT remains
positive, further evaluation should proceed according to the obscure
bleeding algorithm (see Obscure Bleeding section).
Obscure Bleeding

Obscure bleeding can present as both overt and occult bleeding and can originate
from one or more lesions anywhere in the GI tract. As a result, the list of disorders
that can cause obscure bleeding is exhaustive, encompassing those of both overt and
occult bleeding.4,9 Table 7-2 lists the causes of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding.
Clinical Presentation

Patients presenting with obscure bleeding have symptoms similar to those of
acute overt and occult bleeding. Careful history and physical examination may help
delineate the possible source of the bleeding.2,4,8
Diagnostic Testing and Procedures

Repeat EGD and colonoscopy remain the initial step in the evaluation of
obscure bleeding. Previous studies have shown that repeat EGD and colonoscopy
can identify initially missed lesions in 35% to 75% of patients. If repeat endoscopic
studies give negative results, several other diagnostic modalities exist to help
112

determine the source of bleeding.1,2,7,10
Enteroscopy allows direct visual examination of portions of the small
bowel, using a longer endoscope. Different methods of enteroscopy
exist, including push enteroscopy and deep enteroscopy.
Push enteroscopy involves advancing a longer endoscope manually
into the small bowel. During repeat endoscopic evaluations of obscure
bleeding, EGD is generally replaced by enteroscopy for a more thorough
evaluation of the proximal gut. This technique allows visualization of up
to 50 cm of the small bowel beyond the ligament of Treitz.

Deep enteroscopy can be performed by a variety of techniques
including single-balloon enteroscopy (SBE) and double-balloon
enteroscopy (DBE).11 Both these techniques utilize a modified
enteroscope with one or two balloons attached toward the distal end.
Although similar, the systems vary with regard to whether a balloon is
attached only to the overtube (SBE) or also to the tip of the enteroscope
(DBE). The balloon system serves as an anchor by gripping on to the
intestinal wall to allow further advancement of the endoscope.
Alternatively, spiral enteroscopy can be used for an antegrade
113

investigation of the small bowel by using an overtube with a soft raised
helix at its distal end. The spiral enteroscope usually requires two
operators for advancement by pleating the small bowel over the
instrument.7 By utilizing both the oral (antegrade) and anal (retrograde)
approaches, SBE or DBE may allow evaluation of the entire small bowel.
In addition to its expanded diagnostic capacity, deep enteroscopy also
contains intervention capabilities, including hemostasis, biopsy,
polypectomy, and dilation.3,11 Furthermore, lesions identified on
endoscopy that are not amenable to conventional endoscopic therapies
can be marked using mucosal tattoos or hemoclips near the bleeding
source. This may be useful for future localization of the site during
interventional radiology or exploratory surgery.
Capsule endoscopy was introduced almost a decade ago and has
become the standard in recent years for the examination of the small
bowel in obscure GI bleeding. Capsule endoscopy involves ingestion of a
capsule containing a small camera that sends images to a recorder worn
on the patient’s belt. Images are transmitted at a rate of two pictures
per second.9,10,12,13 Relying on normal intestinal peristalsis for the
advancement of the capsule, this test is virtually pain free and
noninvasive. It is limited, however, by the inability to either perform
biopsy or intervene; studies can also be incomplete if the cecum is not
traversed within the battery life of the capsule (typically 8 hours).
Without air insufflation, rinsing, or control of direction, parts of the
mucosal surface may not be visualized, as the capsule gets pushed along
by peristalsis. Capsule entrapment or retention, particularly in patients
with stricture or diverticula, remains the major risk, which occurs in 1%
of cases. If within reach, retained capsules can be retrieved using an
enteroscope; if beyond the reach of endoscopic instruments, surgery may
be necessary.9,10
Small bowel series and enteroclysis use oral contrast to identify
mucosal lesions in the GI tract radiographically. With a low sensitivity,
they are generally reserved either for cases in which more invasive
testing cannot be performed or for ruling out endoluminal narrowing
before capsule endoscopy.
Technetium 99m–labeled erythrocyte scans can help identify the
origin of obscure bleeding when other modalities fail to reveal a source.
The test, however, must be performed during episodes of active bleeding
114

at a rate exceeding 0.1 to 0.4 mL/minute. Results of the scan should be
confirmed by an alternative test, such as angiography, because of
significant false localization rate. Radionuclide imaging using
technetium 99m pertechnetate (Meckel’s scan) can be used to
localize Meckel’s diverticulum, one of the causes of obscure GI bleeding.
This compound is taken up by heterotrophic gastric mucosa within the
Meckel’s diverticulum and can be localized on a radionuclide scan.
Angiography usually follows a tagged erythrocyte scan and allows
visualization of bleeding of at least 0.5 mL/minute and additionally may
offer therapeutic interventions such as vasopressin infusion and
embolization. Highly vascular lesions such as angiodysplasia and
neoplasms can sometimes be identified during angiography by
demonstrating typical vascular patterns, even if active bleeding is not
manifest. Caution is advised, and pretreatment might be needed in
patients with suspected contrast allergy or renal insufficiency. Both
computed tomography and magnetic resonance angiography are
techniques that use dye to highlight vasculature.14 These techniques can
also be useful to localize acute bleeding.
Intraoperative enteroscopy may allow better and more complete
visualization of the entire small bowel. It is usually reserved for
transfusion-dependent bleeding without a source despite extensive
diagnostic evaluation. This is also used to precisely localize bleeding
lesions at surgery after initial diagnosis with capsule endoscopy or other
diagnostic modalities. The risks of continued bleeding should also be
carefully evaluated and must outweigh the surgical risks of laparotomy.15

TREATMENT
Treatment of obscure bleeding should be directed at the primary disorder
leading to the bleeding.8,9 The treatment modalities generally fall into four main
categories:
Endoscopic therapy
The basis for endoscopic therapy of obscure bleeding is accurate
localization and identification of the bleeding source. A second-look
endoscopy (i.e., repeat upper endoscopy and colonoscopy) or a secondopinion endoscopy may have value in obscure GI bleeding. When this is
115

performed, the upper endoscopy is typically replaced by push
enteroscopy to allow inspection of the proximal small bowel. Some of the
reports that use this approach show sources of bleeding in as many as
two-thirds of patients. If no source is identified, further testing typically
hinges on video capsule endoscopy and deep enteroscopic techniques in
stable patients and on radiologic techniques in unstable or rapidly
bleeding patients.
Endoscopic techniques utilized include epinephrine injection, thermal
therapy with a heater probe, bipolar cautery, argon plasma coagulation,
endoscopic mucosal resection, and band ligation depending on the lesion
identified. See Chapter 6 for further details on these techniques.
Angiographic therapy
Infusion of vasopressin into the bleeding vessel can induce spasm and
allow hemostasis. This is possible when the bleeding lesion is identified
on angiography. Alternatively, gelfoam or coils can be used to embolize
and occlude the bleeding vessel. The risk of ischemic changes in the
affected bowel segment is greatly reduced with superselective
catheterization of bleeding vessels.
Pharmacologic therapy
Depending on the lesion identified, simple measures may include acid
suppression, avoidance of NSAIDs or aspirin, and optimization of INR or
prothrombin time in patients on warfarin or heparin therapy. Misoprostol
can sometimes be used for mucosal protection in patients requiring
aspirin or NSAID therapy—there is limited evidence that misoprostol may
provide mucosal protection extending into the small bowel, whereas
proton pump inhibitors provide benefit that is limited to the
gastroduodenum under similar circumstances.9
When numerous angiodysplasia are noted, ablation of each of these
lesions may not be feasible. In such instances, the initial approach is to
replete iron, either orally or parenterally, and to maintain a stable blood
count with intermittent transfusions. When this approach fails,
pharmacologic therapy with combination of estrogen-progesterone (birth
control pills), danazol, amino caproic acid, tranexamic acid, octreotide
and thalidomide have been anecdotally used with varying success.2,9
Surgery
Depending on the lesion identified, surgical resection may sometimes be
necessary, especially with stromal tumors and other neoplastic lesions.
116

Rapid bleeding localized to a limited bowel segment may require
laparotomy and intraoperative enteroscopy for precise localization;
some of these procedures are followed by resection of the segment with
the bleeding lesion.
If all evaluations give negative results, nonspecific therapy, including iron
supplementation, correction of coagulopathy or platelet disorders, or intermittent
transfusion, should be continued.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Jaundice is a common condition encountered in both inpatient and
outpatient settings, with a broad spectrum of causes, ranging from
benign to life-threatening. An in-depth understanding of the presentation
and pathophysiology of jaundice is essential for appropriate investigation
and accurate diagnosis.
Definition

Jaundice is defined as a yellow discoloration of skin, sclera, and mucous
membranes caused by accumulation of bilirubin, a by-product of heme
metabolism.
The upper limit of normal for total serum bilirubin is 1.0 to 1.5 mg/dL, of
which conjugated bilirubin constitutes 0.3 mg/dL.1 Hyperbilirubinemia
(total serum bilirubin >1.5 mg/dL) may be present without overt
jaundice, but it nevertheless represents an abnormal condition.
Jaundice typically becomes apparent when the serum total bilirubin
concentration reaches 2.5 to 3.0 mg/dL. Increased bilirubin levels may
be caused by a defect at any site along the bilirubin metabolic pathway,
from increased bilirubin production, decreased bilirubin clearance, or a
combination of factors.1
Classification

There are two approaches to the classification of jaundice. The first is
according to the location of the defect in the bilirubin pathway
119

(prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic). The second is classification by
the predominant type of bilirubin that is found in the blood
(unconjugated vs. conjugated).
Jaundice can be classified as prehepatic, intrahepatic, or posthepatic.
Prehepatic jaundice may be due to overproduction of bilirubin.
Intrahepatic jaundice can be caused by abnormalities in bilirubin
transport, conjugation, or excretion.
Posthepatic jaundice is due to biliary obstruction.
Jaundice can also be classified as primarily unconjugated bilirubin,
conjugated bilirubin, or both.2
Unconjugated bilirubin is mostly water-insoluble and reversibly binds
to albumin in the blood. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be due to
bilirubin overproduction, impaired uptake, decreased storage, or
abnormal bilirubin conjugation.
Conjugated bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid, becomes
water-soluble, and is subsequently excreted in the stool and urine. The
half-life of conjugated bilirubin bound to albumin is approximately 17
days, thus explaining the slow recovery from jaundice even after
resolution of the illness. Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia may be due to
decreased bilirubin excretion, hepatocyte dysfunction, or biliary
obstruction.
Combination hyperbilirubinemia can also be seen in hepatocellular
disease, biliary obstruction, and decreased canalicular excretion.
Etiology

Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
Bilirubin overproduction
Hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis are seen with sickle-cell
anemia, thalassemia, G6PD deficiency, pyruvate kinase deficiency,
malaria, ABO blood group mismatch, and lead toxicity. Bilirubin is usually
3 to 5 mg/dL, and overt jaundice is uncommon in the absence of severe
hemolysis or concomitant liver disease. Hemolysis can be evaluated with
measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), haptoglobin, reticulocyte
count, and a peripheral smear.
Resorption of large hematomas results in bilirubin overproduction and
subsequent unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Impaired hepatic bilirubin uptake
120

Decreased hepatic blood flow can result in impaired hepatic bilirubin
uptake and is caused by cirrhosis, portocaval shunts, or congestive heart
failure.
Drugs that can cause impaired bilirubin uptake include rifampin,
probenecid, sulfonamides, aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and contrast dye.
Impaired conjugation of bilirubin
Inherited uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT) deficiencies
include Gilbert's syndrome and Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Gilbert's
syndrome affects 3% to 10% of the population (predominantly men)
and presents with intermittent jaundice often precipitated by illness,
stress, fatigue, or fasting. It is the most common cause of unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia and is benign with no deleterious long-term
consequences. Crigler-Najjar syndrome is less common and can be of
two types: Type I with complete deficiency of UGT 1A1 and type II with
partial inactivation of the enzyme.
Neonatal jaundice can be due to physiologic jaundice due to an initial
relatively low activity of UGT and is usually seen between 5 and 14 days
in full-term infants. On the other hand, breast milk jaundice is seen later
in life and is due to an inhibitor of UGT activity in breast milk.
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in newborns can also be caused by ABO
incompatibility, G6PD deficiency, hypothyroidism, and so forth. Newborns
with severe elevations of unconjugated bilirubin are often treated to
prevent kernicterus, which manifests as hypotonia, lethargy, and
seizures.
Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia
Intrahepatic cholestasis
Hepatitis including alcoholic hepatitis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, EpsteinBarr virus, and cytomegalovirus can present with cholestatic hepatitis.
Primary biliary cirrhosis is an autoimmune disorder commonly seen in
middle-aged women.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a chronic liver disease with
scarring of the bile ducts (“beads on a string”) and is commonly
associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
Postoperative cholestasis may have many causes including hemolysis,
ischemia, anesthetics, and so forth.
Total parenteral nutrition (TPN) can cause intrahepatic as well as
121

extrahepatic cholestasis.3
Cholestasis of pregnancy may be due to morbid pregnancy-related
conditions such as HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes,
and low platelet count) and acute fatty liver of pregnancy or the more
common, but benign, intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (the cause of
30% to 50% of jaundice in pregnancy).
Infiltrative disorders: granulomatous disease (sarcoidosis, lymphoma,
mycobacterial infection, Wegener's granulomatosis), amyloidosis, and
malignancy (paraneoplastic syndrome: renal cell carcinoma).
Infections such as bacterial, sepsis, fungal, or parasitic.
Vascular causes such as hepatic vein thrombosis (Budd-Chiari
syndrome) or shock liver.
Stem cell transplant-related such as sinusoidal obstruction syndrome
(venoocclusive disease), graft-versus-host disease, or chemotherapyinduced hepatitis.
Drugs that cause a predominantly cholestatic picture (elevated alkaline
phosphatase [AP] and total bilirubin) include anabolic steroids, oral
contraceptives, estrogens, amoxicillin–clavulanic acid, chlorpromazine,
clopidogrel, erythromycin, irbesartan, mirtazapine, phenothiazines,
terbinafine, and tricyclics.
Extrahepatic cholestasis
Choledocholithiasis which is the presence of gallstones in the common
bile duct (CBD).
Primary sclerosing cholangitis can also have dominant extrahepatic
biliary strictures.
AIDS cholangiopathy has an appearance similar to PSC, presents with
elevated AP, and is caused by opportunistic infections of the biliary tree.
Malignancy such as hepatocellular carcinoma (manifest as intraluminal
with tumor thrombus or fragments, extraluminal tumor, or hemobilia),
cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer, and ampullary tumors.4
Pancreatitis (acute, chronic, or autoimmune) can be associated with
cholestasis.
Mirizzi syndrome caused by gallstones compressing the common
hepatic duct.
Postsurgical strictures may cause obstruction resulting in extrahepatic
cholestasis.
Choledochal cystic disorders including Caroli's disease and
122

choledochal cysts.
Vascular enlargement from aneurysms or portal cavernoma.
Congenital and familial causes of cholestasis: Rotor syndrome;
Dubin-Johnson syndrome; progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis:
PIFC-1 (Byler disease), PIFC-2 (BSEP mutation), and PIFC-3 (MDR-3
mutation); benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis (BRIC).
Mixed conjugated and unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
A mixed pattern of hyperbilirubinemia may be seen in hepatocellular
disorders. A combination of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia and
parenchymal liver disease can also result in a mixed pattern of
hyperbilirubinemia.
Hepatocellular disorders: Viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease,
Wilson's disease, Reye's syndrome, hemochromatosis, autoimmune
hepatitis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, celiac sprue, nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis, pregnancy related (acute fatty liver of pregnancy and
preeclampsia).
Drugs: Acetaminophen, amiodarone, clindamycin, colchicine,
ketoconazole, niacin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, salicylates,
calcium channel blockers.5
Pathophysiology

Bilirubin is the end product of degradation of the heme moiety of
hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (Fig. 8-1).

123

FIGURE 8-1 Bilirubin metabolism. Heme oxygenase catalyzes the rate-limiting
step within the reticuloendothelial system. Unconjugated bilirubin is transported
bound primarily to albumin, at which point it is taken up by the hepatocyte and
undergoes glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucuronyl transferase (UGT1A1). It is then secreted in the water-soluble conjugated form into the canaliculi
(70% to 90% diglucuronide and 5% to 25% monoglucuronide). Within the intestine,
it is deconjugated and reduced by bacterial β-glucuronide to urobilinogen, which is
either excreted in stool or reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation. A defect at
or before glucuronidation results in primarily unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia,
whereas problems after this step cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Hemoglobin from senescent red blood cells accounts for 80% to 90% of
the daily bilirubin production, with the remainder coming from ineffective
erythropoiesis and degradation of heme-containing proteins (cytochrome
124

P450, peroxidase, and catalase).
Normal daily bilirubin production averages 4 mg/kg of body weight
(~300 mg). The reticuloendothelial system has the capacity to
metabolize up to 1500 mg daily, so hemolysis rarely causes jaundice by
itself, unless this ceiling is exceeded or the hemolysis is associated with
liver disease.
Unconjugated or indirect hyperbilirubinemia is present when >80% to
85% of the total bilirubin is unconjugated. Defects proximal to, and
including, the conjugation step result in primarily unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia. Defects after the glucuronidation step within the
hepatocyte result in primarily conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Conjugated
or direct hyperbilirubinemia is present when >30% of the total bilirubin
is in the conjugated form.

DIAGNOSIS
The history, physical examination, and initial laboratory evaluation
should be directed at answering the following questions:
Is the process acute or chronic?
Is the hyperbilirubinemia unconjugated, conjugated, or mixed?
If there is unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, is it caused by increased
production, decreased uptake, or impaired conjugation?
If there is conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, is it caused by intrahepatic or
extrahepatic cholestasis?
Clinical Presentation
History

A detailed history is important for developing a differential diagnosis and
identifying the cause of the patient's jaundice. Factors that can provide
clues to the diagnosis include the following6:
Age: Patients younger than 30 years are more likely to have acute
parenchymal disease, including acute viral hepatitis, biliary tract disease,
alcoholic liver disease, and autoimmune hepatitis, whereas those older
than 65 years are more likely to have gallstones, malignancy, or druginduced hepatotoxicity in the setting of polypharmacy. Autoimmune
125

disease can have a second peak in the elderly.
Gender: In male patients, consider alcohol, pancreatic cancer,
hepatocellular carcinoma, and hemochromatosis. In female patients,
gallstones, primary biliary cirrhosis, and autoimmune hepatitis are more
common.
Acute versus chronic jaundice can be differentiated by a thorough
history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Xanthelasma, spider
angioma, presence of ascites, and hepatosplenomegaly are indicative of
a chronic process. Similarly, hypoalbuminemia, thrombocytopenia, and
prolonged prothrombin time (PT) are mostly seen in the setting of
chronic jaundice.6 Fever, chills, right upper quadrant abdominal pain,
leukocytosis, and hypotension are not only indicative of an acute cause
but suggest ascending cholangitis and require urgent intervention.
Asterixis, confusion, or stupor could represent fulminant hepatic failure
and require immediate therapy.
Patients with viral hepatitis often give a history of a viral prodrome,
including anorexia, malaise, and myalgias. Infectious sexual exposures,
intravenous drug use, and prior blood transfusions also support a
diagnosis of viral hepatitis. Essential are a careful travel history and
human immunodeficiency virus status, as well as alcohol and drug
history, including over-the-counter and herbal remedies, because a
multitude of drugs can cause jaundice by diverse mechanisms, including
hemolysis, hepatocellular damage, and cholestasis.
Pruritus suggests a longer duration of disease and can be seen in both
intrahepatic cholestasis and biliary obstruction. Increased urine
urobilinogen may represent increased bilirubin production and
subsequent enterohepatic circulation or decreased hepatic clearance of
urobilinogen and, therefore, does not distinguish between hemolysis and
liver disease. In the presence of cholestasis, however, conjugated
bilirubin is filtered in the urine. Bilirubin in the urine is a definitive
indicator of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Abdominal pain with
radiation to the back can suggest pancreatic disease, whereas a right
upper quadrant aching pain is frequently seen in patients with viral
hepatitis.
Physical Examination

The physical examination can reveal evidence of chronic liver disease
126

and may also provide evidence of less common forms of liver disease.
Chronic liver disease is manifested by muscle wasting, cachexia,
palmar erythema, Dupuytren contracture, parotid enlargement,
leuconychia, gynecomastia, and testicular atrophy.6
Cirrhosis is suggested by the findings of spider angiomata, palmar
erythema, and caput medusae (or dilated veins).
Liver size and consistency should also be evaluated. A shrunken and
nodular liver would suggest cirrhosis, whereas a palpable mass can be
indicative of a malignancy or an abscess. An enlarged liver with a span of
>15 cm may be seen in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, Infiltrative
disease, or congestive hepatopathy.
Ascites is typically seen in advanced cirrhosis but may also be seen with
severe viral and alcoholic hepatitis.
Asterixis is indicative of end-stage liver disease and hepatic failure.
Other useful findings include hyperpigmentation (hemochromatosis),
xanthomas (primary biliary cirrhosis), and Kayser-Fleisher rings
(Wilson's disease).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Essential initial laboratory tests should include levels of direct and
indirect bilirubin, transaminases (aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase), AP, total protein, albumin, and PT. If available,
results of prior liver biochemical test are essential to evaluate the trend
of changes.
If laboratory results are consistent with unconjugated
hyperbilirubinemia, a hemolysis workup should be initiated
(reticulocyte count, lactate dehydrogenase, haptoglobin, Coomb's test,
and peripheral smear). In the absence of hemolysis, most asymptomatic
healthy patients with isolated unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia have
Gilbert's disease and require no further evaluation.1
If laboratory results demonstrate conjugated hyperbilirubinemia or
are indeterminate, then additional workup is required.
Patients with transaminases elevated out of proportion to the AP most
likely have a hepatocellular disorder. Levels of transaminases 300 IU/mL
are seen in alcoholic hepatitis, drug-induced injury, and chronic liver
127

disease and obstruction. Levels >1000 IU/mL are indicative of acute
hepatitis, drug-induced hepatotoxicity (acetaminophen toxicity), and
shock liver.
If AP is elevated (usually more than three times upper limit of normal)
out of proportion to the transaminases, this suggests intrahepatic
cholestasis or extrahepatic obstruction. An increased γ-glutamyl
transferase (GGT), 5'-nucleotidase, or leucine aminopeptidase confirms
the hepatic origin of an elevated AP.
Disproportionate elevation of AP compared with bilirubin could be seen
in partial biliary obstruction or in early intrahepatic cholestasis (primary
biliary cirrhosis and PSC). High levels of AP and bilirubin may, however,
indicate presence of a CBD stone.
High levels of GGT could be seen in many other medical conditions other
than biliary disease, including congestive heart failure, alcohol intake,
pancreatitis, chronic lung disease, renal failure, and diabetes, and as a
result of use of many drugs.
The presence of low albumin or prolonged PT suggests chronic liver
disease with impaired synthetic function.
In cirrhotic patients, high levels of globulins and low albumin levels are
frequently seen.
Prolonged PT may, however, also be seen in obstructive jaundice. Of
note, parenteral administration of vitamin K corrects the coagulopathy in
patients with obstructive jaundice but not hepatocellular disease.
Testing for urinary bilirubin or urobilinogen may be of some use, because
clinical jaundice may lag behind bilirubinuria.
High cholesterol levels are seen in patients with cholestasis.
If the initial evaluation does not reveal an obvious etiology (alcohol,
drugs, infections), then specific biochemical studies should be
ordered, including viral hepatitis serologies, antinuclear antibody,
antimitochondrial antibody, antismooth muscle antibody, serum
quantitative immunoglobulins, iron studies, ceruloplasmin, and α1antitrypsin levels.
If the cause still remains unclear, then liver biopsy should be considered.
Figure 8-2 is helpful in planning the evaluation of the patient with
jaundice.
The evaluation of conjugated hyperbilirubinemia requires careful
selection of the appropriate imaging procedure, because many of these
128

studies are expensive or invasive.
If the initial evaluation suggests a possible vascular cause (Budd-Chiari
syndrome or shock liver), then ultrasound with Doppler should be the
initial study to evaluate patency of the hepatic and portal veins and
hepatic artery.
Increased transaminases should prompt a search for hepatocellular
disorders.
If the history and examination cause concern for malignancy, then an
abdominal computed tomographic scan and α-fetoprotein levels should
be ordered, followed by ultrasound- or computed tomography (CT)guided liver biopsy, if appropriate.
Patients with increased AP should be evaluated for causes of
cholestatic jaundice.
Ultrasound should be the initial study to evaluate for evidence of biliary
ductal dilatation. Abdominal CT can also be used to evaluate for ductal
dilatation, but it has specific limitations.

129

FIGURE 8-2 Algorithm for evaluation of the patient with jaundice. See
comments in text regarding selection of appropriate imaging study when given a
choice in the algorithm. ERCP, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography;
EUS, endoscopic ultrasound; MRCP, magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography;
PTC, percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography.
If ductal dilatation is present, or if the suspicion for obstruction remains
high despite a normal study finding, then endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) or percutaneous transhepatic
cholangiography (PTC) should be performed. Of note, patients who have
had prior cholecystectomy normally have a dilated CBD.
If ductal dilatation is not seen and the suspicion for obstruction is low,
then biochemical studies should be ordered as above to look for
parenchymal disease.
Again, liver biopsy should be considered if no etiology can be identified.
130

Imaging

Ultrasound
Ultrasound is the best initial study for detection of biliary obstruction as
evidenced by ductal dilatation. It has a sensitivity of 77% and specificity
of 83% to 95% for identification of bile duct dilation. Its advantages are
portability, noninvasiveness, and relatively low cost. Disadvantages
include operator-dependent nature and decreased image quality in
obese patients or in those with overlying bowel gas and poor
visualization of distal ducts in 30% to 50% of patients.
Nondilated ducts, especially in the setting of acute or intermittent
obstructions, cannot definitively rule out biliary obstruction, however.
Therefore, additional studies are required if a high suspicion of
obstruction remains.
Ultrasound can also identify hepatic parenchymal lesions, gallbladder
disease, cholelithiasis, and choledocholithiasis.
Abdominal CT
Abdominal CT is a first-line study for evaluation of hepatic parenchymal
lesions; it is also an alternative to ultrasound for identifying biliary
obstruction. Its advantages are a less operator-dependent nature and
improved images in obese patients. Limitations include higher cost, lack
of portability, inability to detect noncalcified gallstones, and requirement
of radiocontrast dye.
Magnetic resonance imaging
Magnetic resonance imaging is a useful test for assessing liver
parenchyma, specifically focal and malignant lesions. It is also sensitive
in assessment of liver fat and iron. Magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography is a special technique used to visualize the
biliary tract. Advantages include its noninvasive nature and ability to
accurately identify various liver lesions. Unlike ERCP, it does not have
therapeutic capabilities.
Hepatic iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan
The test of choice, if acute cholecystitis with cystic duct obstruction or
biliary leakage is suspected, is a HIDA scan. False-negative results
should be expected, however, in the setting of TPN use or with fasting
serum bilirubin concentrations >5 mg/dL.

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
ERCP provides direct visualization of the biliary and pancreatic ducts and
identifies the site of obstruction in >90% of patients. Advantages include
high accuracy in locating the site of obstruction, as well as the ability to
perform therapeutic interventions (sphincterotomy, stone extraction,
stent placement, cytology, and brushing and direct visualization using
SpyGlass). Disadvantages include expense, invasiveness, difficulty after
certain surgeries (Roux-en-Y), and morbidity. Complications of
perforation, bleeding, cholangitis, and pancreatitis are uncommon but
can be serious (2% to 3% overall morbidity rate).
Endoscopic ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound can detect small CBD stones with similar accuracy
to ERCP and no risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis. It can detect small (3 cm)
pancreatic tumors that are usually not discovered by CT scans. Bile duct
stones cannot be removed by endoscopic ultrasound, which is a major
disadvantage to ERCP.
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography
PTC is also an excellent test for evaluating biliary obstruction, with
accuracy similar to ERCP (up to 90% to 100%) in identifying the site of
biliary obstruction if the ducts are dilated. Advantages include lower cost
and therapeutic capabilities (decompression of biliary system).
This test is less accurate than ERCP, however, if there are nondilated
ducts, and several passes into the liver may be required to access the
biliary tree. Aside from limited usefulness with nondilated ducts, other
problems include inability to perform the test in the presence of
coagulopathy (PT >16 seconds and platelets 50,000) and ascites, as well
as complication risks (bleeding, arteriovenous fistulas, sepsis,
pneumothorax, peritonitis). The decision of whether to perform ERCP or
PTC should be based partially on local expertise of the
gastroenterologists and radiologists.
Liver biopsy
If imaging studies are inconclusive and a hepatocellular process is
suspected, a liver biopsy may be useful. It is an invasive procedure,
however, and a complication rate of 0.1% to 3% is expected.
Complications include pain, hemobilia, hemoperitoneum, arteriovenous
fistula, pneumothorax, or hemothorax. Ultrasound guidance may
decrease some of the risks. In patients with thrombocytopenia,
132

coagulopathy, and ascites, a transjugular approach is recommended.

TREATMENT
Management of jaundice should be directed at the underlying
cause. These management options are discussed in detail elsewhere in
this handbook.
Watchful waiting can be appropriate for acute viral hepatitis, where
recovery is expected in most instances. Hepatitis B and C have chronic
phases that require monitoring and management with interferon and/or
antiviral agents as described in Chapter 19. Liver transplant may be an
option for end-stage liver disease with decompensation.
Discontinuation of offending medications or toxins is recommended for
drug- or toxin-induced jaundice. Specific treatment with N-acetyl cysteine
is available for acetaminophen-induced liver damage but is effective only
in early disease course.
Management of chronic autoimmune liver diseases causing jaundice may
include use of corticosteroids, immune modulators, and liver
transplantation. See Chapter 19 for further details.
The goal of treating a patient with bile duct obstruction is to drain the
bile to decrease the risk of complications and to provide symptom relief.
In patients with choledocholithiasis, a laparoscopic cholecystectomy with
CBD exploration using intraoperative or postoperative ERCP is
recommended. In many cases of CBD stones, an ERCP with
sphincterotomy and stone extraction would be the appropriate
therapeutic procedure. In old or frail patients who cannot undergo
surgery, externally inserted drains into the gallbladder or main hepatic
ducts would be suggested to overcome malignant strictures or for
temporary relief of symptoms.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnancy
In pregnant patients, jaundice could be caused by disorders that are
unique to pregnancy or coincident with, or exacerbated by, pregnancy
(hepatitis E, herpes simplex, Budd-Chiari syndrome, choledocholithiasis).
133

Low serum albumin level and high AP (up to two to four times normal
from placenta), fibrinogen, transferrin, and cholesterol levels can be
considered part of expected pregnancy-related changes. Levels of
transaminases, bilirubin, and GGT do not change with pregnancy,
however, and abnormal levels need to be further investigated.7
Liver diseases associated with pregnancy occur at special time points.8
Hyperemesis gravidarum may cause mild elevations of AP, bilirubin,
and transaminases during the first trimester.
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy normally presents with
intense itching in the third trimester (up to 100 times increase in total
serum bile acids).
In Dubin-Johnson syndrome exacerbated by pregnancy, jaundice
develops in the second or third trimester.
Chronic hepatitis, autoimmune disease, Wilson's disease, and primary
biliary cirrhosis may be exacerbated during pregnancy as well. Gallstone
disease can occur at anytime.
Acute fatty liver of pregnancy (with marked elevations of
transaminases), preeclampsia or eclampsia, and HELLP (hemolysis,
elevated liver enzymes, and low platelet count) syndrome could present
with jaundice, usually late in the pregnancy. When jaundice occurs late
in the course of these hepatocellular diseases, it indicates severe hepatic
dysfunction.
Critically ill patients
Jaundice is commonly seen in patients in the intensive care unit, where
it is usually nonobstructive and multifactorial.9 Bilirubin overproduction
caused by hemolysis of transfused blood (10% of red blood cells in a
transfused unit are hemolyzed within 24 hours), drug-induced hemolysis,
and prosthetic valves are most common explanation of this finding.
Hepatocellular dysfunction secondary to ischemia (shock liver), rightsided heart failure, anesthetic agents, sepsis with multisystem organ
failure, viral hepatitis, and TPN should also be considered in the
differential diagnosis of nonobstructive jaundice.10
Obstructive jaundice seen in critically ill patients is usually due to
choledocholithiasis, cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma, pancreatic duct
stricture, or pancreatic head mass. Acalculous cholecystitis causes
jaundice, especially after vascular surgeries, trauma, and burns. Injuries
of the biliary tract are commonly seen in patients who have recently
134

undergone cholecystectomy or other upper abdominal surgeries.11
Liver transplantation
Biliary strictures are a major source of morbidity after liver
transplantation. The incidence has been reported as 5% to 15% after
deceased donor liver transplant and 28% to 32% after living donor right
lobe transplant. Strictures can often be managed endoscopically with a
success rate of 70% to 100% for anastomotic strictures and 50% to
75% for nonanastomotic strictures.12
Cholestasis after liver transplantation can be related to early or late
complications (using an approximate cutoff of a 6-month period) or can
be mild with no clinical significance.13 Early complications include acute
rejection, ischemia-reperfusion injury (cold and rewarming ischemia),
primary graft nonfunction, acute rejection, bacterial or viral infections,
and drug-induced cholestasis. Late complications are predominantly
related to chronic rejection and recurrence of the original disease.14

COMPLICATIONS
Complications of jaundice will depend on the primary cause and severity
of the jaundice.
Kernicterus caused by deposition of bilirubin in the brain can result in
irreversible motor and cortical impairment. This is seen in infants when
levels of total bilirubin are >20 mg/dL.
Mechanical obstruction of the extrahepatic ducts can predispose
to life-threatening complications, including cholangitis, secondary biliary
cirrhosis, and hepatic abscess formation.
Other long-term complications include hepatic osteodystrophy,
malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, and pruritus.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The evaluation of a patient with suspected hepatic or biliary disease can
be aided by the measurement of various serum markers of liver function
or injury. A thorough understanding of these markers of hepatic disease
is essential for proper interpretation and accurate diagnosis. Whereas a
single laboratory value rarely leads to a diagnosis in patients with
hepatic disease, the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities together with
a thorough history and physical examination can help direct additional
workup to arrive at a diagnosis.
Definition

Abnormal liver chemistries are commonly referred to as “liver function
tests” although they do not necessarily measure the function of the liver.
Furthermore, they can be abnormal in patients with healthy livers and
normal in patients with advanced liver disease. The most common liver
chemistries can be classified as serum enzymes, excretory products, and
measures of synthetic liver function.
Serum enzymes and excretory products
Aminotransferases
Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, previously called SGOT) and alanine
aminotransferase (ALT, previously called SGPT) are sensitive markers of
hepatocellular injury or necrosis. Injury to hepatocytes results in
translocation of these enzymes across the disrupted membranes and a
subsequent rise in serum levels. ALT is a more specific indicator of liver
137

injury because it is found primarily in the liver, whereas AST can be
found in liver, cardiac and skeletal muscles, kidney, brain, pancreas,
leukocytes, erythrocytes, and other organs.1
The degree and pattern of elevation of aminotransferases can offer
clues to the etiology. Small to moderate elevations in the
aminotransferases can be seen in almost any liver disease, including
chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol abuse, autoimmune hepatitis, nonalcoholic
fatty liver disease, biliary obstruction, hemochromatosis, Wilson's
disease, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and as a side effect of various
medications (Table 9-1 ). Whereas marked elevations in AST and ALT
(often >1000 U/L) are seen primarily in acute viral, toxin-induced, or
ischemic hepatitis, these can also be encountered with acute Budd-Chiari
syndrome, fulminant Wilson's disease, autoimmune hepatitis, or acute
bile duct obstruction (Table 9-2).2
The ratio of AST and ALT can also aid in focusing the differential
diagnosis (Table 9-3 ). An AST:ALT ratio of ≥2 with an AST 300 U/L is
highly suggestive of alcohol-induced injury, whereas a ratio of 1 is
usually seen in patients with acute or chronic viral hepatitis, nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis (NASH), or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. In cases of
isolated elevations of AST, a nonhepatic source should be considered
(e.g., acute rhabdomyolysis). In acute muscle injury, the AST:ALT ratio
may initially be ≥3 but quickly declines to 1 because of the shorter halflife of AST.

138

139

Alkaline phosphatase
Alkaline phosphatase (AP) is an enzyme found in the bile canalicular
membranes. Elevated AP levels arise from two main sources—liver and
bone—but the enzyme is also found in other tissues, including placenta,
intestines, and kidneys. Marked elevations in AP are typically seen in
cholestatic syndromes (e.g., biliary obstruction, primary biliary cirrhosis,
primary sclerosing cholangitis, and drug-induced cholestasis, Table 9-4 ).
Moderate elevations in AP are seen with infiltrative processes
(sarcoidosis, other granulomatous diseases, Table 9-5 ), liver metastasis,
and other forms of liver disease. Elevations in AP can be confirmed as
hepatic in origin by measuring AP isoenzymes, γ-glutamyltransferase
(GGT), or 5'-nucleotidase.
140

141

γ-Glutamyltransferase
GGT is found in bile duct epithelial cells, hepatocytes, and other tissues,
including kidney, pancreas, and intestine. Elevations in GGT can be seen
in a number of disorders such as diabetes, pancreatitis, and obesity, as
well as with the use of phenytoin, warfarin, barbiturates, and other drugs
that induce microsomal enzymes. GGT has two main uses in the
evaluation of hepatobiliary disease. An elevated level can confirm a
hepatobiliary origin of elevated AP. In addition, GGT has been shown to
be elevated in persons who consume alcohol on a regular basis and is
sometimes used to monitor alcohol use or abuse in patients receiving
treatment. However, its low specificity and low positive predictive value
limit the clinical use of GGT for the screening of alcohol abuse.3
Bilirubin
Bilirubin is a degradation product of heme metabolism and is composed
of conjugated (direct) and unconjugated (indirect) fractions.
Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia results from excessive production,
reduced
hepatic uptake, or impaired conjugation of bilirubin.
Conjugated hyperbilirubinemia occurs as a result of impaired
intrahepatic secretion of bilirubin or extrahepatic biliary obstruction. Both
forms of hyperbilirubinemia manifest clinically as jaundice. Usually a
serum bilirubin concentration of >3 mg/dL is required for clinical
detection of jaundice. A complete discussion of the pathophysiology and
differential diagnosis of jaundice can be found in Chapter 8.

142

Measures of synthetic function
Hepatic synthetic function is commonly evaluated with prothrombin
time (PT) and albumin. Abnormalities in these markers of synthetic
function are seen with severe liver disease and should result in urgent
evaluation and treatment of the cause of the abnormality. Acute liver
disease is discussed in more detail in Chapter 18. Chronic liver disease
and cirrhosis are discussed in Chapters 19 and 20.
Clotting factors
Many of the proteins involved in hemostasis, including the coagulation
factors, are synthesized in the liver. Normal activity of clotting factors II,
VII, IX, and X depends on normal hepatic synthetic function, as well as
the presence of vitamin K. As a result, two forms of hepatobiliary
dysfunction can lead to coagulopathy manifested by prolongation of PT.
First, significant hepatocellular injury or necrosis can impair hepatic
synthetic function of clotting factors and leads to PT prolongation.
Second, cholestatic syndromes may also prolong PT by interfering with
intestinal absorption of vitamin K via impaired lipid absorption. This form
should respond to parenteral administration of vitamin K, whereas
coagulopathy purely from impaired hepatic synthesis will not.
Albumin
Serum albumin concentration, which is often decreased in chronic liver
disease, reflects decreased synthesis. Other disease states as well as
plasma volume expansion can also decrease albumin concentration.
Levels may be normal in acute liver disease because of a half-life of
approximately 20 days. The shorter half-life of prealbumin (1.9 days)
makes it a sensitive marker of liver function in patients with acute
acetaminophen overdose.
143

DIAGNOSIS
A series of laboratory tests alone rarely leads to a diagnosis in a patient
suspected of having hepatobiliary disease. Instead, the clinical context
must be considered and tests carefully chosen; disease-specific
laboratory tests and other appropriate studies are necessary to arrive at
a diagnosis.
Clinical Presentation
History

A thorough and accurate history is essential in the approach to a patient
with abnormal liver chemistries; it should include the following:
Duration and extent of abnormal liver chemistries.
Symptoms of liver disease (e.g., weight loss, anorexia, fever, nausea,
vomiting, abdominal pain, pruritus, and jaundice).
Medical and surgical history, including details of other medical illnesses,
such as cardiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, arthritis,
thyroid diseases, and so forth.
Risk factors for the metabolic syndrome including a detailed history of
weight gain/loss, cholesterol levels, diabetes, and so forth.
Pregnancy can predispose to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy,
preeclampsia/eclampsia, and acute fatty liver of pregnancy. Isolated AP
elevation in the third trimester can be from a placental source of the
enzyme.4
Careful review of prescription, over-the-counter medications, and herbal
therapies.
Thorough social history, including history of alcohol consumption, illicit
drug use (e.g., intravenous and intranasal), sick contacts and exposure
history, well water consumption, tattoos, piercings, recent travel, dietary
history including an unusual diet (e.g., raw oyster, mushroom), sexual
and menstrual history, occupational and environmental history, and
transfusion history.
Family history of jaundice may be present in Gilbert's syndrome, DubinJohnson syndrome, and hereditary hemolytic syndromes.
Hemochromatosis, Wilson's disease, and α1-antitrypsin deficiency are
144

autosomal-recessive disorders. Other hepatobiliary disorders, including
primary sclerosing cholangitis, primary biliary cirrhosis, and autoimmune
hepatitis, may also have a genetic component.
Physical Examination

The physical examination should focus on stigmata of liver disease
as well as signs suggestive of systemic diseases that commonly
affect the liver. This includes jaundice, palmar erythema, temporal
wasting, spider nevi, caput medusa, gynecomastia, ascites,
hepatosplenomegaly, abdominal tenderness, and encephalopathy.
Certain liver diseases can also have particular findings on physical
examination such as the Kayser-Fleischer rings of Wilson's disease and
xanthelasmas (fatty nodules around the eyes) in primary biliary cirrhosis.
Differential Diagnosis

A nonhepatic source must be considered in any patient with abnormal
liver chemistries. When a hepatic source is suspected, it is helpful to
divide the pattern of abnormality into one of three broad categories:
hepatocellular injury, cholestasis, and infiltrative processes.
Hepatocellular injury
Hepatocellular injury typically manifests with modest to profound
elevations in serum aminotransferases. AP and bilirubin may or may not
be elevated, depending on the nature and severity of the injury. As a
general rule, the highest elevations in transaminases are seen with
ischemic and acute viral hepatitis. In ischemic hepatitis or herpes
simplex hepatitis, transaminase levels >10,000 can be noted (see also
Chapter 18). Toxic injury is also typically associated with marked
elevations in AST and ALT. Less-marked elevations in transaminases are
seen with chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis. The PT can be prolonged
with hepatocellular injury, depending on the extent of hepatocellular
necrosis and subsequent hepatic synthetic dysfunction. Albumin is
normal in acute injury but can decrease in chronic disorders when
synthetic function is significantly impaired. Table 9-2 lists the common
causes of hepatocellular injuries. The initial evaluation should include
testing for the most likely causes. Specific biochemical testing often
reveals the etiology. Imaging with ultrasound or abdominal computed
tomography (CT) may be useful in identifying structural causes. For
145

patients with unexplained abnormal transaminases, liver biopsy should
be considered, especially if the levels remain elevated for >6 months
(Table 9-3).
Cholestasis
Cholestatic injury typically produces moderate to profound elevations in
AP, often with hyperbilirubinemia (elevations in bilirubin may be absent
in certain clinical situations, such as with partial biliary obstruction). PT
may be prolonged but responds to parenteral vitamin K administration.
Depending on the nature of the cholestasis, serum transaminases may or
may not be elevated. In early total common bile duct obstruction, AST
and ALT may rise before AP. Evaluating a patient with cholestatic injury
with routine liver chemistries can be particularly challenging. Once a
nonhepatic source of elevated AP has been excluded, selection of other
studies is directed by the degree of AP elevation. Table 9-4 lists the
common causes of cholestasis. Ultrasound is the best initial study,
because it allows visualization of the liver parenchyma and biliary tree
(Fig. 9-1). Depending on the ultrasound findings, further evaluation may
include abdominal CT, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography,
or liver biopsy.
Infiltrative process
Infiltrative liver injury is seen most commonly with granulomatous
diseases, including sarcoidosis and metastatic disease to the liver. The
predominant feature is an elevation in AP and, to a lesser extent,
elevated bilirubin. Unlike with cholestatic liver injury, PT prolongation
would not be expected in infiltrative injury because intestinal absorption
of vitamin K is not affected. Table 9-5 lists the common causes of
infiltrative liver disease. Imaging with either ultra-sound or abdominal
CT, often followed by liver biopsy, forms the basis for evaluating
infiltrative processes.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic testing should be directed toward identifying the most likely
causes of the abnormal liver chemistries on the basis of a detailed
history and physical examination. The pattern of laboratory
abnormalities (hepatocellular, cholestatic, infiltrative, or mixed) is also
critical in focusing the differential diagnosis and directing the evaluation
toward the most likely cause of the abnormalities.
146

For chronic (6+ months) mild to moderate elevations (less than five
times the upper limit of normal), evaluate for the most common causes
(alcohol abuse, hepatotoxic medications and herbals, hepatitis B,
hepatitis C, NASH, and hemochromatosis). See Table 9-3 and Figure 9-1
for more details.
Laboratories

Initial laboratory testing for chronic, mild to moderate
elevations may include hepatitis B surface antigen and antibody,
hepatitis B core antibody, hepatitis C antibody, and serum iron and total
iron binding capacity to screen for hemochromatosis.5 Alcoholic hepatitis
is suggested by an AST:ALT ratio of >2. NASH does not have a specific
diagnostic laboratory test but is usually diagnosed on the basis of
history, examination, and radiologic imaging. Unlike with alcoholic liver
disease, the AST:ALT ratio in NASH is usually 1.

If initial laboratory testing is unrevealing, consider testing for less
common but frequently seen disorders associated with abnormal liver
chemistries. For example, nonhepatic sources of elevated
aminotransferases include muscle disorders, thyroid disease, celiac
148

disease, and adrenal insufficiency. Other less common hepatic sources of
elevated liver chemistries include autoimmune hepatitis, primary biliary
cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, Wilson's disease, α1 antitrypsin
deficiency, and so forth. See Chapters 19 and 20 for more details.
Imaging

The choice of imaging to evaluate the cause of abnormal liver
chemistries depends on the most likely causes as determined by the
history, physical examination, and initial laboratory investigation. It is
reasonable to start with an abdominal ultrasound to evaluate the liver
parenchyma, structural causes or mass lesions, and to visualize the
biliary tree. The addition of Dopplers to the ultrasound examination can
evaluate for suspected Budd-Chiari syndrome or portal hypertension.
Ultrasound is noninvasive, portable, and is relatively inexpensive
compared with other imaging modalities such as computed tomographic
scans, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and so forth. Limitations of
ultrasound include that it is operator-dependent and visualization can be
limited by patient obesity and bowel gas. An abdominal computed
tomographic scan also evaluates the hepatic parenchyma and biliary
tree but is not operator-dependent or as limited by bowel gas or patient
obesity. Use of IV contrast is needed to evaluate for malignancy. In
particular, a triple-phase contrast CT to identify arterial washout is an
excellent tool to evaluate for hepatocellular carcinoma. However, MRI is
the most accurate imaging technique for identifying hepatocellular
carcinoma, hemangiomas, focal nodular hyperplasia, hepatic iron
overload, and focal fatty infiltration. Both CT and MRI are limited by lack
of portability, increased cost, and need for contrast for the best
visualization in most situations.6
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy should be considered in patients with chronically (>6
months) elevated serum liver chemistries. The decision must be
individualized to each patient's age, pattern of liver chemistry
abnormalities, and associated comorbid conditions. Biopsies performed
in patients with negative serologic markers are most likely to
demonstrate a pattern of steatosis or steatohepatitis, occasionally
associated with fibrosis.
149

TREATMENT
Treatment of abnormal liver chemistries is directed toward the suspected
or confirmed cause of the abnormalities. In suspected drug-induced
liver injury, an initial first step is to discontinue nonessential
medications and consider alternatives for potentially hepatotoxic
medications. If viral hepatitis is identified, treatment decisions depend
on whether the patient has acute or chronic disease and whether or not
the patient has developed hepatic fibrosis or cirrhosis. Patients with
suspected nonalcoholic fatty liver disease or NASH should have diet
and exercise recommended and aim to lose 5% to 10% of their body
weight over 6 to 12 months. These patients should be followed to
confirm improvement in liver chemistries in response to weight loss.
When alcoholic liver disease is suspected on the basis of history, labs,
and other studies, complete alcohol avoidance should be recommended
and supportive services such as Alcoholics Anonymous or one-on-one
counseling should be offered. In most cases of liver disease, patients
should be offered immunization against viral hepatitis A and hepatitis B
to protect them from future superimposed liver injury. Further details on
the treatment of acute and chronic liver diseases can be found in
Chapters 18 to 20.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ascites is the most common complication of cirrhosis of the liver.
This is associated with a mortality rate of 15% in 1 year and 44% in 5
years.1
Once ascites develops in the setting of end-stage liver disease, 1-year
survival rate drops by as much as 50%.
Development of ascites is one criterion used in determining the need for
liver transplantation.
Definition

Ascites is defined as an abnormal accumulation of serous fluid in the
peritoneal cavity.
Etiology

The most common cause is portal hypertension due to cirrhosis
of the liver.
Liver disease accounts for ~80% of cases.2
Within 10 years of a diagnosis of cirrhosis, 50% of patients will develop
ascites.
The portal pressure usually needs to exceed 12 mm Hg for ascites to
develop.
Other hepatic causes include chronic hepatitis, severe alcoholic
hepatitis without cirrhosis, and hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari
152

syndrome)2(Table 10-1).
Nonhepatic causes include generalized fluid retention associated with
systemic diseases (heart failure or nephrotic syndrome), peritoneal
disorders (carcinoma-tous or infectious peritonitis), and certain systemic
disorders (connective tissue disorders)2(Table 10-1).
Pathophysiology

Altered hepatic architecture from advanced liver disease increases
sinusoidal pressure in the fibrotic liver. This leads to increased
hydrostatic pressure in the liver and splanchnic bed and accumulation of
fluid in the peritoneum. Peripheral vasodilation from increased levels of
arterial nitric oxide leads to renal protective mechanisms through the
renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This results in avid renal sodium
retention and contributes to fluid accumulation.3
Ascites caused by right-sided heart failure is rather uncommon. When
this occurs, chronic passive liver congestion leads to hepatocellular
damage and fibrosis when sustained for a long time. Circulatory
compromise and activation of antinatriuretic, renin-angiotensin, and
sympathetic nervous systems can participate in fluid accumulation.3

153

Patients with nephrotic syndrome can have hypoproteinemia and
anasarca, which can be associated with ascites.
In peritoneal carcinomatosis, proteinaceous material exuded into the
peritoneal cavity produces an osmotic gradient with movement of fluid
from the intravascular space.
Hepatocellular carcinoma can cause portal hypertension from
replacement of normal liver parenchyma, leading to ascites.
Cancer-induced hypercoagulable states can cause hepatic or portal
venous thrombosis and subsequent ascites.
Peritoneal infections can lead to proteinaceous exudates and subsequent
movement of fluid into the peritoneal cavity.
Pancreatic ascites can result from a pancreatic enzyme leak into the
peritoneal cavity in acute severe pancreatitis. Intraperitoneal irritation
and inflammation ensue, further potentiating fluid accumulation.
Obstruction of the thoracic duct in lymphoma or after surgical trauma can
lead to accumulation of chyle in the peritoneal cavity—this is termed
chylous ascites.
Serositis from connective tissue disorders can result in peritoneal
inflammation and inflammatory fluid collection.
154

Classification

Ascites from portal hypertension is identified by its low albumin
content. The standard criterion used to make this determination is a
measure of the difference between serum and ascites albumin
concentrations (serum ascites albumin gradient, SAAG). The value
is >1.1 g/dL in ascites from portal hypertension.
This calculation has been shown to be 97% accurate in predicting portal
hyper-tension.1
SAAG scores of <1.1 indicate alternate etiologies for ascites, including
hypoalbuminemia, chylous ascites, ovarian disease, tuberculous
peritonitis, or peritoneal carcinomatosis (Table 10-1).
Associated Conditions

Patients with ascites are at risk for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(SBP), hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), and hepatic hydrothorax.2
SBP is discussed later under Complications section.
HRS is a clinical diagnosis based on the development of progressive
renal failure in cirrhosis4 (see Chapter 20)
HRS can be subdivided into two categories: type I and type II.
Type I is rapidly progressing and defined by a doubling of the initial
serum creatinine or a 50% reduction of creatinine clearance in <2
weeks.
Type II is a slower form that is a common cause of death in end-stage
liver disease.
Hepatic hydrothorax occurs in as many as 13% of patients with ascites.5
It is typically right sided.
Defects in the diaphragm permit passage of ascites from the abdominal
cavity into the pleural space.

DIAGNOSIS
The two main purposes of sampling ascitic fluid via diagnostic
paracentesis are as follows:
To identify the etiology of new-onset ascites
To evaluate for SBP in patients with known ascites presenting with
155

abdominal or nonspecific symptoms
Clinical Presentation6

A thorough history and physical examination are essential for an accurate
diagnosis of new-onset ascites.
In the 20% of patients with a nonhepatic cause of ascites, the history
should focus on uncovering conditions such as malignancy, heart failure,
tuberculosis, or renal disease.
History

Patients often state that they notice an increase in their abdominal girth.
This may be manifested as weight gain or increase in belt size.
Concurrent peripheral edema involving the feet and ankles may be seen.
Ascites is not usually painful, but tense ascites may be uncomfortable
and can cause shortness of breath.
Because most cases of ascites are due to liver disease, patients should
be asked about risk factors for liver disease (see Chapter 18 to Chapter
20).
Physical Examination

The abdomen may be protuberant with bulging flanks. However, small
ascites volumes may be difficult to identify by physical examination
alone.
Shifting dullness on percussion in two different positions (supine and left
lateral) may suggest the presence of ascites.
A fluid wave may be noted if ≥500 mL of fluid is present, though this
may not be very accurate.
Physical examination findings suggestive of chronic liver disease include
jaundice, palmar erythema, spider angiomas, jugular venous distension,
white nails, Dupuytren’s contracture, testicular atrophy, and
gynecomastia.
A firm nodule in the region of the umbilicus (Sister Mary Joseph nodule),
though not common, may indicate malignant ascites.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

156

Ascitic fluid should be analyzed for the following:
Albumin. This is needed for the SAAG calculation.
Cell count and differential. This helps determine whether the ascitic
fluid is infected.
Total protein. Protein levels of <1.0 g/dL indicate high risk for SBP.
Protein levels can be high in secondarily infected ascites resulting in
peritonitis.
Culture. Fluid should be inoculated directly into blood culture bottles,
which can increase the sensitivity of ascitic fluid culture, although yields
are low.
Gram’s staining can be performed if the fluid is turbid or if there is
high suspicion for infection.
Other optional tests include lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose,
amylase, triglyceride levels, cytology, flow cytometry, mycobacterial
smear, and culture. The need for these additional tests is dictated by the
clinical presentation. The level of LDH is high, whereas that of glucose is
low in peritonitis from secondarily infected ascites. Amylase levels are
high in pancreatic ascites, and triglyceride levels can be extremely
elevated in chylous ascites. Cytology is useful when peritoneal
carcinomatosis is suspected. Tuberculosis or lymphoma may be
associated with high lymphocyte counts and may require mycobacterial
culture or flow cytometry for further confirmation.
An ascitic fluid neutrophil count of >250 cells/μL or total white
blood cell count of >500 cells/μL indicates the presence of SBP.
This warrants initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy.
The most important parameter in stratifying diagnostic workup is the
SAAG. The SAAG, as described earlier, is the numeric difference
between the serum and ascites albumin levels in grams per deciliter. A
SAAG of ≥1.1 g/dL is indicative of ascites related to portal
hypertension with a specificity of 97%.
Imaging

Ultrasonography is the easiest and most sensitive technique for the
detection of ascitic fluid.6 Even small fluid collections can be accurately
identified.
Ultrasonography is also useful for localizing the most ideal site for
abdominal paracentesis, especially when the ascitic volume is not large.
157

Small amounts localize in the right perihepatic space, the posterior
subhepatic space, and the Douglas pouch (rectouterine pouch).
Plain abdominal films can demonstrate elevation of the diaphragm in the
presence of massive ascites, but this is typically not necessary for the
diagnosis of ascites.
Ascites is demonstrated well on computed tomographic scan images, but
computed tomography is not needed for diagnosis in most instances.
Diagnostic Procedures

A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed in new-onset ascites
or in any patient with known ascites with any abdominal or systemic
symptom bringing them to medical attention, because manifestations of
SBP can be subtle and nonspecific.
Very few contraindications exist for diagnostic paracentesis. Paracentesis
is a safe procedure that can be performed even in patients with
coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia.7
There are no data to support administration of blood products
prior to the procedure.
Fluid should be obtained in a sterile fashion. The left lower quadrant
is the preferred location. A diagnostic paracentesis should be part of
large-volume paracentesis performed for relief of abdominal distension.
Complications are rare and are reported only in about 1% of patients,
mostly consisting of abdominal wall hematomas. Hemoperitoneum is a
rare complication. Introduction of secondary infection is clinically
feasible, but likelihood is significantly reduced if aseptic precautions are
utilized. Entry of the paracentesis needle into the bowel occurs in fewer
than 1 in 1000 cases.

TREATMENT
Management of ascites depends on the etiology, especially when it
is caused by a process other than chronic liver disease, such as
peritoneal disease (malignancy, infection, inflammation), leakage of
digestive secretions (biliary or pancreatic), or lymphatic obstruction
(chylous).
If aspecific etiology is identified, treatment can be directed toward the
158

offending cause. For instance, a low-fat diet with medium-chain
triglyceride supplementation can reduce the flow of chyle into the
lymphatics in chylous ascites.
Ascitesis managed in a stepwise fashion, starting with abstinence
from alcohol and dietary sodium restriction and escalating to
pharmacologic therapy, large-volume paracentesis, transjugular
portosystemic shunt, and liver transplantation as necessary.
Medications

The initial pharmacologic management of ascites from portal
hypertension consists of oral furosemide and spironolactone.8
The goal of diuretic therapy should be a weight loss of 1 kg/day in
patients with edema and 0.5 kg/day without edema until ascites is
adequately controlled.
Both agents are initiated simultaneously to prevent potassium
derangements and to achieve desired diuresis efficiently.
Recommended starting doses are furosemide 40 mg/day and
spironolactone 100 mg/day. The dose can be increased every 3 to 5 days
to a maximum of 160 mg/day of furosemide and 400 mg/day of
spironolactone.
Side effects may limit the ability to achieve maximum doses. Diuretics
may need to be withheld in patients with renal dysfunction or
hypovolemia. Patients are carefully monitored for signs of intravascular
volume depletion, renal insufficiency, and decompensation of liver
disease. Diuretic therapy should not be initiated when the serum
creatinine level is unstable because of the risk of precipitating
hepatorenal syndrome.
For minimal ascites, spironolactone can be used as single therapy.
If intolerable gynecomastia results from the use of spironolactone,
amiloride or triamterine can be substituted.
Intravenous diuretics should be avoided in cirrhotic patients, as
these agents can precipitate renal failure. Oral furosemide has good
bioavailability and should be adequate in most instances.
Recent research has focused on the treatment of refractory ascites with
aquaretics—vasopressin V2-receptor antagonists that promote
excretion of electrolyte-free water (still awaiting approval by the FDA).9

159

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Serial large-volume paracentesis (removal of >5 L) is often used for
ascites that is refractory to medical therapy.
Large-volume paracentesis is a fast, convenient, and safe technique.
The use of albumin remains controversial, given limited evidence in
decreasing mortality and the high cost.1 However, this option may
minimize the likelihood of cardiovascular collapse and renal failure and
should be considered in high-risk patients or when >5 L of fluid is
expected to be removed.
Complications include postparacentesis hypotension, bleeding, local
leakage of ascites, and infection. Perforation and death are unusual.
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is currently
the most effective method of managing ascites refractory to diuretics
and large-volume paracentesis. TIPS consists of a conduit created
between the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein,
which decompresses portal pressure.2,10
TIPS is placed to reduce portal pressure in patients with complications
related to portal hypertension.11
It is also used in cases of variceal bleeding, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and
hepatic hydrothorax.
Absolute contraindications for TIPS include right-sided heart failure,
polycystic liver disease, and severe hepatic failure.
Relative contraindications consist of active infection, severe
encephalopathy poorly controlled with medical therapy, and portal vein
thrombosis.
A study found that the VIATORR polytetrafluoroethylene-covered stent
had lower rates of shunt insufficiency and hepatic encephalopathy.12
Complications include hemorrhage from capsular tears, new-onset or
worsening of hepatic encephalopathy (occurs in about 25% and is
directly related to shunt diameter), heart failure, and early shunt
thrombosis.
TIPS does not alter the extrahepatic anatomy, therefore remaining an
effective, nonsurgical bridge to liver transplantation.
Surgical Management

The peritoneovenous shunt is an alternative for patients with
160

medically intractable ascites.
This is a megalymphatic shunt that returns the ascitic fluid to the central
venous system.
Improves short-term survival in cancer patients with refractory malignant
ascites.
AASLD guidelines suggest considering peritoneovenous shunting for
patients with refractory ascites who are not candidates for paracentesis
or TIPS.11
Diet

All patients should comply with a low-sodium diet (2000 mg/day) to
ultimately avoid reaccumulation of fluid.
Patients should be cautioned to avoid salt supplements containing
potassium chloride, because use of these products can lead to lifethreatening hyperkalemia, especially in association with aldosterone
antagonists.
Fluid restriction is used only if persistent hyponatremia is present (serum
sodium <125 mmol/L).

COMPLICATIONS
The most important complication of ascites is the development of SBP2
(see Chapter 20).
SBP is seen in ~12% of patients with ascites at the time of admission.
Diagnosis is made with >250/mL polymorphonuclear cells in the ascites
or growth of organisms in a culture of ascitic fluid.
Second- and third-generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime 1 g IV q8h or
ceftriaxone 1 g IV q24h) for 5 days have proven effective in the
management of SBP.
As for prophylaxis, there is conflicting evidence, but it is reasonable to
consider daily norfloxacin administration in high-risk groups (GI bleed,
ascitic fluid protein levels <1 g/dL, previous episode of SBP).
Norfloxacin 400 mg daily or ciprofloxacin 750 mg weekly can be used for
prophylaxis.
Hepatic hydrothorax is an uncommon manifestation of cirrhotic
patients with ascites.
161

The diagnosis is established clinically by finding a serous transudate.
Management is problematic and often does not respond to medical
therapy.
Treatment includes therapeutic thoracentesis, peritoneovenous and
pleurovenous shunting, TIPS, and liver transplant.

REFERRAL
If worsening ascites is part of progressive decompensation of chronic
liver disease, a workup for assessing candidacy for liver transplantation
may be warranted.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Assessment of nutritional status is an important aspect in the care of all
patients. Nutritional status represents effectiveness of nutrient intake in
maintaining body composition and meeting metabolic demands.
The best overall approach to evaluating nutritional status involves a
thorough clinical and physical examination, a nutritional history, and
appropriate laboratory studies.
To effectively manage a patient’s nutritional status, familiarity with the
basic principles of clinical nutrition is imperative.
Definition

A state of over- or undernutrition can be called malnutrition. For the purposes of
this chapter, malnutrition will refer to the state of undernutrition, where nutrient
intake is not adequate to meet the body’s metabolic demands.
Epidemiology

Undernutrition is prevalent in hospitalized patients, occurring in 20% to
70% of patients at admission or during hospital course. In the outpatient
setting, unintentional weight loss is encountered in up to 13% of the
elderly and 50% to 60% of nursing home residents.
Malnutrition is frequently underdiagnosed by both practitioners and
trainees. Studies have found that only 40% of malnourished patients
have documentation of their nutritional status and that trainees recorded
measurements of nutritional status in <33% of malnourished patients.1
164

Pathophysiology

In terms of nutritional status, the body is made up of lean body mass
(LBM) and fat mass.
LBM is the body’s total mass minus the fat mass and includes muscle,
organs, fluid, bones, and minerals.
Fat, in the form of adipose tissue triglyceride, is the body’s major fuel
reserve.
In times of stress, the body tries to preserve LBM; however, as fat stores
run out, visceral protein mass is mobilized to meet metabolic needs,
which include acting as gluconeogenic precursors and wound healing.
Multiple changes occur in the body as a result of negative energy
balance.
Initially, there is a decrease in resting energy expenditure (REE).
There is also a decrease in protein synthesis, particularly in persons with
disease compared with healthy controls. This impaired protein synthesis
can lead to a decrease in intestinal cell mass and, consequently, atrophy
of the mucosa. Studies have shown variable degrees of mucosal atrophy
associated with malnutrition, but these changes can normalize after
refeeding.
In most cases, malnutrition is multifactorial. Nutritional disturbance in
hospitalized patients typically results from reduced food intake
(prescribed by physicians, critical illness, dysphagia) and increased
metabolic demands (burns, inflammatory states, fluids lost through
drains). Unintentional weight loss is also commonly caused by
malignancy, and gastrointestinal (GI), endocrine, cardiovascular, and
pulmonary disorders.
Associated Conditions

Multiple consequences occur as the result of malnutrition in hospitalized
patients.
Increased length of hospital stay, mortality, and susceptibility to
infection; poor wound healing, increased frequency of decubitus ulcers;
and impaired cardiopulmonary function.
As little as 5% unintentional weight loss in 1 month can be clinically
significant and a weight loss of ≥20% can impair most physiologic body
functions.2
165

DIAGNOSIS
Multiple tools have been developed to assist in nutritional assessment,
including the Subjective Global Assessment, Mini Nutritional Assessment,
Nutrition Risk Score, Nutrition Risk Index, and Geriatric Risk Index.
Studies have been done to validate these tools in assessing for
malnutrition, but no gold standard exists.
The best overall approach involves a thorough nutritional history and
physical examination.
Clinical Presentation
Nutritional History

Nutritional assessment includes the following2:
Identification of preexisting malnutrition before acute presentations
The presence of mild (<5%), moderate (5% to 10%), or severe (>10%)
unintentional weight loss in the last 6 months should be determined.
Unintentional weight loss of >10% is associated with a poor clinical
outcome.
Relevant medical and surgical history
Medications
Socialhabits
Focused dietary history (should assess changes in diet and, if present,
the reasons for the changes)
Physical Examination

Physical examination should include an assessment of the following2:
Hair, skin, eyes, mouth, dentition, and extremities
Fluid status
Stigmata of protein calorie malnutrition or vitamin and mineral
deficiencies
Temporal muscle wasting, sunken supraclavicular fossae, and decreased
adipose stores are easily recognized signs of malnutrition.

166

Calculate body mass index (BMI) (BMI = weight in kilograms/height in
meters squared) with a weight obtained in the hospital (Table 11-1).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratory Assessment

Historically, concentrations of several plasma proteins (e.g., albumin,
transferrin, pre-albumin) and total lymphocyte count have been used to determine the
degree of protein malnutrition and to predict clinical outcomes. However, in many
cases, inflammation and injury, not malnutrition, are responsible for low levels of
these markers and for the increased incidence of morbidity and mortality. As such,
these parameters have poor sensitivity and specificity and will not be discussed
further in this chapter.

TREATMENT

Calculating the Nutrient Requirement

Nutritional requirements are determined by the body’s energy demands
or total energy expenditure (TEE).
TEE = REE (70% TEE) + thermal effect of food (digestion, 20% TEE) +
physical activity (10% TEE)
At times of illness or trauma, the resting energy requirement can
increase by as much as 50%. Although it is often not feasible to measure
167

energy expenditure directly in hospitalized patients, a number of
predictive equations have been devised to estimate macronutrient
requirements.
The simplest approach to estimating the caloric needs of a hospitalized
patient is based on BMI (Table 11-1).
The general rule is that caloric requirement is inversely proportional to
BMI, because LBM (which includes organ mass) is the main determinant
of energy expenditure. Because organs do not significantly hypertrophy
with increasing adiposity, energy expenditure per kilogram body mass
progressively declines with increasing adiposity but increases with lower
body weights.
In critically ill, insulin-resistant patients, a lower energy dose should be
used to avoid the deleterious effects of hyperglycemia.
In overweight patients, an adjusted body weight (see the following
formula) should be used to avoid overfeeding.
Adjusted body weight = ideal body weight + 0.25 (actual body weight –
ideal body weight)
Individual protein requirement depends on multiple factors, including the
overall nutritional state, energy requirement, and nonprotein caloric
intake.
The recommended protein intake is 0.8 g/kg/day in healthy adults.
Normal weight medically ill patients require 1.0 to 1.5 g/kg/day of
protein; however, in patients experiencing large protein losses from
burns, wounds, or fistulas, 2 to 2.5 g/kg/day of protein may be
required.2,3
Nutritional Support

Loss of LBM is tightly associated with mortality and therefore the goal of
nutritional support is to prevent significant weight loss and preserve LBM
until recovery from the underlying illness has been achieved.2
Patients most likely to benefit from nutritional support are those with
baseline malnutrition in whom a protracted period of starvation would
otherwise occur.
No absolute indications exist for nutritional support. A careful assessment
of the patient’s clinical condition and expected outcome help to
determine the need for nutritional support.
Factors that must be accounted for include amount of intake, amount of
168

available endogenous stores (adipose tissue), lean muscle mass, and the
rate of catabolism.3
Individuals who are severely malnourished at the outset of an illness
often require immediate nutritional support, whereas patients with
adequate stores can tolerate longer periods without significant
nutritional intake.
In general, well-nourished hospitalized patients do not require nutritional
support for 7 to 10 days, whereas malnourished and critically ill patients
may need nutritional support initiated within 48 to 72 hours of
admission.
The decision to initiate nutritional support must be individualized and the
type of support carefully chosen.3
Enteral Nutrition

Enteral nutrition is infusion of a nutrient liquid formulation into the upper
GI tract that can provide complete nutritional requirements.
Preserves GI tract barrier function and should be used when possible.
Mechanical obstruction, paralytic ileus, bowel ischemia, unstable GI
bleeding, and high-output enteric fistulas are relative contraindications
for enteral feedings.
Enteral nutrition can be used with caution and careful monitoring in the
setting of severe pancreatitis, and it may be associated with fewer
complications than parenteral nutrition.3,4
Methods of Enteral Nutrition

For short-term support (<30 days), nasogastric or nasoenteric
tubes are preferred.
Gastrostomy or jejunostomy tubes are indicated if the duration is
expected to be >30 days.
Underlying condition and local expertise should dictate percutaneous,
radiologic, or surgically placed gastrostomy tubes.
Tube feeds should be started at a low dose (150 to 200 mL) every 4 to 6
hours and increased by 50 to 100 mL each feeding until the feeding goal
is reached. Each feeding should be followed by a water flush. The
amount of water flush depends on the patient’s volume status.2
With nasogastric tube feeding, a single elevated residual volume is an
indication to recheck the residual volume in 1 hour. The feeding should
169

not automatically be stopped, however.5
Patients’ upper body should remain upright or elevated by at least at 30
degrees during bolus tube feeds and for 2 hours after to avoid
aspiration.5
Postpyloric or Small Bowel Feeding

Small caliber nasojejunal feeding tubes can be placed past the ligament
of Treitz for short-term postpyloric or small bowel feeding and
percutaneous, surgical, or radiographic jejunostomy tubes can be placed
for long term feeding.5
Small bowel feeds are associated with a decreased risk of aspiration,
better tolerated by patients with impaired motility, and have less
pancreatic stimulation and are often used in the setting of severe acute
pancreatitis.
Small bowel feeds are given as a continuous pump-controlled infusion
and typically start with 10 to 30 mL/hour and are increased in small
increments (10 mL/hour every 8 to 12 hours) until the feeding goal is
reached. Again, these tubes should be flushed with water every 4 hours
to avoid tube occlusion.
Bolus feeds should not be used with small bowel feeding tubes to
prevent fluid shifts, abdominal distension, and diarrhea.5
Choosing an Enteral Formula

Standard tube feeding formulas (Ensure, Osmolite, Isocal) are sufficient
for most patients.
They are free of gluten and lactose and are isotonic.
They contain 1.0 cal/mL, and intake of 1500 to 2000 mL/day provides
100% of carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals.
Use of disease-specific and elemental formulas (monomeric and
oligomeric) is controversial because these formulas are more expensive
than standard formulas.2
Parenteral Nutrition

Parenteral nutrition (PN) is the infusion of a nutritional liquid formulation
through a central or peripheral venous catheter that can provide
complete nutritional requirements.
170

PN may be given if the GI tract is not accessible or functional, as occurs
in patients with bowel obstruction, diffuse peritonitis, short gut
syndrome, or malabsorption. In some cases, prolonged ileus or severe
pancreatitis may also require PN.
PN can be administered via a peripheral vein, but the nutrition formula
cannot exceed 900 mOsm/kg (e.g., 10% dextrose, 2% amino acids, and
electrolytes). This generally provides inadequate calories and therefore
hyperosmolar solutions are used, which require central venous access.
The optimal location of the tip of the central venous catheter is at the
junction of the superior vena cava and the right atrium.6
Composition and Administration of Parenteral Nutrition

PN solution can be purchased commercially or can be made by the
hospital pharmacy.
Total number of calories and amount of protein are determined using the
guidelines described in the “Calculating the Nutrient Requirement”
section seen earlier.
Lipid content of the PN ideally provides 20% to 30% of the daily calories;
a 20% lipid emulsion yields 2.0 kcal/mL. The carbohydrate component is
dextrose and provides the remainder of the calories; it contains 3.4
kcal/g.2,6
Electrolytes, minerals, trace elements, and a multivitamin preparation
are generally added to the parenteral solution. Note that iron is not
generally part of the standard additives.
Initiate PN at one-half to two-thirds of the total volume over the first 24
hours to avoid large fluid shifts and hyperglycemia. The volume is then
advanced as tolerated. Once the volume goal has been reached, the rate
of infusion can be increased and PN can be infused over 10 to 14 hours.
Cyclic (rather than continuous) infusion of PN improves quality of life and
decreases incidence of hepatobiliary complications. Shortened infusion
time, however, can lead to periods of hyperglycemia.
During initiation of nutrition support, close monitoring is indicated, with
frequent measurement of vital signs, daily weights, intake and output, as
well as the following:
Blood glucose checks every 6 to 8 hours.
Comprehensive metabolic panel should be checked daily until feeds are
at goal and then twice weekly.
171

Complete blood cell count may be checked once weekly.

COMPLICATIONS

Complications of Tube Feedings

Tube feeding is a relatively safe procedure, and complications usually can be
avoided or adequately managed. In addition to the complications of percutaneous
tube placement (infection, bleeding, inadvertent colonic placement), patients may
experience the following complications2,5,7:
Aspiration. To limit the risk of aspiration, the head of the patient’s bed
should be raised ≥30 degrees during feeding and for 2 hours afterward.
Intermittent or continuous feeding regimens, rather than the rapid bolus
method, should be used. Gastric residuals should be checked regularly,
and all patients should be observed for signs of feeding intolerance.
Jejunal access is helpful either in patients with recurrent tube feeding
aspiration (not oropharyngeal) or in critically ill patients at risk for
impaired gastric motility.
Diarrhea. To minimize the incidence of diarrhea, it is advisable to use
an isosmotic, lactose-free formula and to advance tube feeds slowly.
Decreasing the rate of the feeds, switching to continuous tube feeds, and
adding fiber to the formula can be helpful. It is important to remember
to check for antibiotic-associated diarrhea in these high-risk patients and
to look for sorbitol in other orally administered medications. If these
measures fail and infectious causes have been ruled out, an antidiarrheal
agent may be appropriate.
Hyperglycemia. Adequate blood glucose monitoring is necessary when
starting enteral nutrition. Initially, sliding scale regular insulin can be
used to control blood glucose concentrations. Once the feedings have
reached 1000 kcal/day, intermediate duration insulin given every 12
hours can be used in conjunction with sliding scale regular insulin for
blood glucose control.
Small bowel necrosis. Patients who require pressor support to
maintain an adequate blood pressure are at risk for small bowel necrosis
with small bowel feeds. The early signs of bowel ischemia are not
specific and include bloating, loss of bowel sounds, abdominal pain, and
172

ileus. If enteral nutrition is necessary in a patient with hypotension, he or
she should be carefully monitored for any signs of early bowel ischemia.
Complications of Parenteral Nutrition
Mechanical Complications

Central line placement. Complications related to central line
placement include pneumothorax, brachial plexus injury, subclavian or
carotid artery puncture, hemothorax, and chylothorax.
Thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. This can occur secondary to
central venous catheter use. Radiologically evident subclavian vein
thrombosis occurs commonly (25% to 50%), but clinically significant
manifestations (e.g., upper extremity edema, superior vena cava
syndrome, or pulmonary embolus) are rare. Inline filters should be used
with all PN solutions.
Infectious. Complications are most commonly caused by
Staphylococcus epidermidis or Staphylococcus aureus. In
immunocompromised patients, gram-negative rods and Candida species
are also a major concern.
Metabolic Complications

Hyperglycemia. Blood glucose levels >200 mg/dL should be managed
by minimizing the dextrose to <200 g/day as well as adding 0.1 unit of
regular insulin for each gram of dextrose in PN. Blood glucose levels
should be checked frequently and sliding scale insulin (SSI) used to
control hyperglycemia. If blood glucose levels remain elevated despite
SSI, additional insulin should be added to the PN solution, equal to 50%
of the SSI from the previous 24 hours. If this fails, an intravenous (IV)
insulin drip or further reduction in PN carbohydrate dose may be
required.2
Hypertriglyceridemia. Triglyceride levels >1000 mg/dL can cause or
exacerbate acute pancreatitis and have been associated with
thrombocytopenia. The levels should be checked at baseline and at least
once during lipid emulsion infusion to ensure adequate clearance. Most
practitioners reduce or eliminate lipids in the emulsion with serum
triglyceride levels >400 mg/dL. Remember, the sedative propofol is
administered in a 10% (1.1 kcal/mL) lipid emulsion and should be
173

counted as part of the lipid calories.
Hepatobiliary. Complications include elevated levels of serum
transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. In addition, steatosis,
steatohepatitis, lipidosis, cholestasis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis can occur.
Although these abnormalities are usually benign and transient, more
serious and progressive disease can develop in a small subset of
patients, usually after 16 weeks of PN. Biliary complications typically
occur with PN administered for longer than 3 weeks and include
acalculous cholecystitis, gallbladder sludge, and cholelithiasis.
Metabolic bone disease. Osteomalacia or osteopenia may be seen
with long-term (>3 months) total PN.
Refeeding Syndrome

Refeeding syndrome refers to the massive fluid and electrolytes shifts that can
occur when a severely malnourished patient is initiated on nutritional support,
leading to volume overload, cardiovascular collapse, and death.2,8
Electrolyte depletion is the most dangerous complication of initial
refeeding.
With the administration of a carbohydrate load, serum levels of
phosphorous, potassium, and magnesium rapidly fall, because of insulinmediated transcellular shifts in the face of whole-body electrolyte
depletion.
Hypophosphatemia can lead to respiratory muscle paralysis and
cardiovascular collapse.
The rapid fall in potassium and magnesium levels can lead to cardiac
dysfunction and arrhythmias.
Volume overload (secondary to fluid administered with the nutritional
supplement and insulin-mediated sodium retention) is the characteristic
of refeeding syndrome and may progress quickly to congestive heart
failure.
Cardiac abnormalities include prolongation of the QT interval, which,
combined with plasma electrolyte abnormalities, lead to an increased
risk of ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death during the first
week of refeeding.
Thiamine deficiency can lead to acute beriberi, which, in turn, can
lead to lactic acidosis, impaired sensory perception, edema, and heart
174

failure.
The best approach to refeeding syndrome is prevention by starting feeds
slowly and aggressively supplementing potassium, magnesium, and
phosphate in patients with normal renal function.2,8
Initial feeding should start at 15 kcal/kg/day and can advance slowly as
tolerated.
Serum levels should be checked at least once a day.
Thiamine should be supplemented at 50 to 100 mg/day for 3 days.
To prevent fluid overload, initial fluid intake and sodium should be
limited, and patient weight should be monitored daily. Weight gain in
excess of 0.25 kg/day or 1.5 kg/week should be treated as volume
overload; fluid intake should be reduced and diuretics used as necessary.
Electrocardiogram should be obtained at baseline, and patients should be
monitored on telemetry during early refeeding.

GASTROESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

The Montreal consensus defines gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)
as “a condition which develops when the reflux of stomach contents
causes troublesome symptoms and/or complications.”
Symptoms are “troublesome” if they are frequent and have an adverse
affect on a patient’s well-being.1
Epidemiology

The true prevalence of GERD is difficult to ascertain because clinical
diagnosis is relatively subjective, and not all patients with GERD undergo
confirmatory testing.
Various studies have estimated the prevalence of patients in the Western
world with GERD to be as high as 20%, with 30% to 40% of the
population reporting at least occasional symptoms consistent with
GERD.2
Pathophysiology

177

Several mechanisms underlie abnormal reflux, all of which result in the
failure of the gastroesophageal junction to prevent gastric contents from
entering the esophagus.
The gastroesophageal junction is composed of the lower esophageal
sphincter (LES), the crural diaphragm, and the phrenoesophageal
ligament.
Under most circumstances, GERD is related to transient, inappropriate
LES relaxations. Less frequently, the gastroesophageal junction may be
mechanically compromised, with decreased LES resting tone, a hiatus
hernia, or both.
Regardless of the mechanism, the acid and enzymes present in gastric
contents directly injure the lining of the esophagus. Significant mucosal
damage can occur when the esophagus is exposed to a pH value 4 for a
prolonged period of time, because the esophageal mucosa does not have
protective mechanisms against acid and pepsin as in the stomach.3
Risk Factors

Alcohol intake
Caffeine intake
Obesity
Smoking
Impaired esophageal peristalsis
Impaired salivation
Poor gastric emptying
Hypersecretion of gastric acid (as seen in Zollinger–Ellison syndrome)

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The evaluation of GERD has three important aspects:
Any “alarm symptoms” should be elicited. These include
dysphagia, weight loss, occult or overt gastrointestinal bleeding,
symptoms lasting more than 5 years, symptoms unresponsive to proton
pump inhibitors (PPI), and age more than 45 years.3 Alarm symptoms
indicate the need for invasive investigation, typically with upper
178

endoscopy.
The severity of GERD should be assessed.
Cardiac diseases should be excluded, especially when chest pain is
a presenting symptom.
History

The duration, frequency, and severity of heartburn should be determined.
Patients with GERD commonly report an “acidic” taste in the mouth and
nocturnal wheezing or coughing.
Other symptoms that may suggest GERD include hoarseness, chronic
sore throat, or apnea.
Behaviors that increase reflux should be sought, including smoking,
caffeine use, large meals, and recumbency after eating.
The presence of “alarm symptoms” should be determined.
Physical Examination

The physical examination should include an assessment of body habitus
and the evaluation of the stool for occult blood.
Diagnostic Testing

Many clinicians advocate an empiric trial of a PPI orally as the initial
step in suspected GERD. A symptomatic response to PPI confers a high
degree of certainty of the diagnosis of GERD.
In the presence of alarm symptoms, uncertainty of diagnosis, or
inadequate response to PPI, further workup is necessary.
Laboratories

A complete blood count (CBC) may reveal a microcytic anemia if
bleeding occurs from esophagitis, cancer, or an erosion.
Imaging

Barium swallow is a low-yield examination in GERD. A barium swallow is
not indicated for the diagnosis of GERD. Barium studies are best used for
characterization of anatomic relationships at the gastroesophageal
junction prior to antireflux surgery, especially for evaluating hiatus
hernias and their relationship to the gastroesophageal junction and the
179

diaphragmatic hiatus; other uses could include better definition of tight
strictures, or detection of subtle strictures where a barium pill swallow
may have value.
Diagnostic Procedures

The sensitivity of endoscopy as a diagnostic test for GERD is low, as the
likelihood of finding visible esophagitis is only around 50% in treatmentnaïve patients. The likelihood of esophagitis is extremely low when
patients have already received PPI therapy.
Esophageal pH studies involve measurement of intraluminal
esophageal pH over a 24- or 48-hour period.
Catheter-based pH studies consist of placement of a thin catheter
through the nostril with the pH recording site 5 cm above the proximal
margin of the LES. Recordings last 24 hours.
Wireless pH studies involve attachment of a pH capsule 6 cm above the
squamocolumnar junction, which corresponds to 5 cm above the LES.
Recordings can last 48 hours or longer.
Catheter-based pH-impedance studies are now available, which can
detect both acidic and nonacidic reflux events.
Generally, an elevated acid exposure time (pH 4 for >4–5% of the time)
is considered abnormal, and suggestive of GERD.
Patients are asked to record their symptoms during the study. The pH
recording can then be analyzed to determine whether symptoms
correlate with reflux events. Simple proportions of symptoms associated
with reflux events to overall symptoms reported (symptom index) can be
used as a tool to record symptom reflux correlation. Statistical tests that
also take the time at risk for reflux, reflux events, and reflux events
without symptoms into consideration may provide more robust
designation of symptom association.4
Testing is performed off PPI therapy when the diagnosis of reflux disease
is in question. Adequacy of reflux control or assessment of ongoing
symptoms despite adequate therapy in well diagnosed GERD patients
can be best determined with a pH impedance study while on maximal
PPI therapy.

TREATMENT

180

The goal of treatment is to alleviate symptoms, heal esophageal
damage, and prevent complications.
Medications

Proton pump inhibitors, administered once daily, can heal erosive
esophagitis and relieve heartburn.
In terms of efficacy, all PPIs are more effective than H2-blockers or
motility agents in healing esophagitis.
The PPI can be administered twice daily with improved therapeutic
benefit if once daily dosing is unsuccessful in relieving the symptoms of
GERD, or if patients have severe erosive esophagitis, strictures, or ulcers.
Common side effects of PPI therapy include headache, diarrhea,
constipation, and abdominal pain.
H2 receptor blockers can be used to step down patients with minor or
uncomplicated GERD, after effective symptom relief with PPI therapy.
These agents are not recommended for patients with erosive
esophagitis, Barrett’s esophagus, strictures, or severe symptomatic
GERD. If symptoms recur with the step-down approach, management
will need to be stepped back up to PPI use.
There is no evidence that adding a nocturnal H2-blocker to twice daily
PPI therapy has any lasting clinical or histopathologic benefit.5
Antacids are the most rapidly acting agents but are not an appropriate
long-term management option in patients with GERD.
Surgical Management

Surgical management is reserved for patients with well-documented
GERD who do not respond to maximal medical therapy or do not wish to
remain on lifelong PPI.
The surgical procedure most often performed is laparoscopic Nissen
fundoplication. Partial fundoplication (Toupet, Dor) can be performed
when esophageal hypomotility coexists. Roux-en-Y gastric bypass
surgery is also an effective antireflux measure in obese patients.
Surgery is as effective as properly dosed PPI with less incidence of
pulmonary aspiration. However, it entails more morbidity and mortality.6
Estimates suggest that 30% of patients resume PPI therapy within 5
years of undergoing antireflux surgery.1
181

The most common complaints following surgery are an inability to belch,
increase in flatulence, and increased bowel symptoms. New transit
symptoms (dysphagia, regurgitation) can develop in a minority of
patients; the risk seems highest when transit symptoms predate surgery.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

Lifestyle modification is not recommended in isolation, but rather in
conjunction with pharmacologic therapy.
Patients are encouraged to decrease consumption of alcohol, caffeine,
and acidic foods that aggravate symptoms, such as onions and
tomatoes.
Patients should avoid the use of medications that lower LES tone
whenever possible, such as calcium channel blockers, β-blockers,
nitrates, and anticholinergic drugs.
Other recommendations include weight loss, smoking cessation,
avoidance of meals within 3 hours of bedtime, and elevation of the head
end of the bed while supine.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The American Gastroenterological Association, in a survey of more than
1000 patients on PPI therapy for GERD, found that 38% had residual
symptoms and 47% of those with residual symptoms took additional
medications to control their symptoms.5
Causes of PPI failure include
Incorrect medication dose timing
Residual pathologic acid secretion
Rapid PPI metabolism
Hypersecretory state
Hiatal hernia
Defective esophageal mucosal barrier
Reflux of nonacid material from the stomach or duodenum
Underlying dysmotility
Underlying eosinophilic or infectious esophagitis
Patients who fail twice daily PPI therapy should undergo upper
endoscopy; persisting symptoms on PPI constitutes an alarm symptom.
182

Random biopsies from the proximal and distal are recommended to
exclude eosinophilic esophagitis.
If the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is normal, pH or
pH/impedance testing can define and quantitate esophageal acid
exposure, and determine symptom–reflux association. Ideally, testing is
performed off PPI therapy if the diagnosis of reflux disease is in question.
If the EGD and pH/impedance testing are both normal, the patient likely
does not have significant reflux disease. Alternate explanations for
symptoms could include functional heartburn or chest pain.5

COMPLICATIONS
Complications of long-standing or incompletely treated GERD include
esophageal stricture, hemorrhage, Barrett’s esophagus, and
adenocarcinoma. It is important to note that these complications can
occur in asymptomatic patients.
The risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma in Barrett’s
esophagus is approximately 0.5% per year.1 However, endoscopic
monitoring of patients with chronic GERD symptoms may not necessarily
reduce the risk of malignancy.1

ESOPHAGEAL MALIGNANCIES

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma represent the two
most common malignancies of the esophagus.
Barrett’s esophagus consists of replacement of normal squamous
distal esophageal mucosa with intestinal type epithelium, also known as
intestinal metaplasia. Dysplasia can develop within intestinal metaplasia,
conferring a higher risk for adenocarcinoma compared with the general
population, despite the fact that development of adenocarcinoma is
relatively infrequent.
183

Epidemiology

In the United States, squamous cell carcinoma is decreasing in incidence,
but the risk remains elevated in African American men.3
The incidence of adenocarcinoma has risen over the past 20 years.7
Both diseases have a strong male predilection with a high mortality rate.
Most patients have regional and distant lymph node metastases at time
of diagnosis.
Pathophysiology

Squamous cell carcinoma
This develops from carcinogenic exposure in susceptible individuals.
The most common locations of disease are the proximal and distal
esophagus.
Adenocarcinoma
Adenocarcinoma develops as a consequence of accumulation of genetic
mutations within dysplastic intestinal metaplasia.
Most casesdevelop near the gastroesophageal junction.
Barrett’s esophagus
Defined as metaplasia of normal esophageal stratified squamous
epithelium in the distal esophagus to specialized intestinal-type
epithelium.
Barrett’s esophagus occurs in approximately 10% of patients with
GERD.7
Patients with Barrett’s esophagus have a risk of developing esophageal
adenocarcinoma that is approximately 100 times higher compared to
patients without this condition.7
Risk Factors

Squamous cell carcinoma
Chronic tobacco use
Chronic alcohol use
History of mediastinal or breast irradiation
Human papillomavirus 16 or 18 infection
Chronic ingestion of hot liquids
Achalasia
184

Adenocarcinoma
Barrett’s esophagus
GERD
Obesity
Scleroderma

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

A thorough history and physical should be performed.
Patients are questioned for a history of dysphagia or unintentional
weight loss.
Risk factors, especially the use of tobacco or alcohol, are queried.
The physical examination is typically normal. Cachexia may develop
from poor nutritional intake in advanced cancer.
Diagnostic Testing

Once malignancy is suspected, diagnostic testing must be initiated in a
timely manner.
Laboratories

Laboratory tests provide little information to aid in the diagnosis of
esophageal malignancies.
A CBC may reveal a microcytic anemia if bleeding has occurred.
A low albumin may suggest malnutrition related to chronic dysphagia.
Imaging

A barium swallow may reveal a mass in the esophageal lumen of
compression from adjacent structures. However, endoscopy is generally
recommended as the first diagnostic test in new onset dysphagia.
If malignancy is diagnosed, computed tomography (CT) and positron
emission tomographic (PET) scanning is often useful to evaluate for
distant metastases.
Diagnostic Procedures

185

Upper endoscopy (EGD) allows for the visualization of the esophageal
lumen and biopsy of lesions suspicious for malignancy or Barrett’s
esophagus.
EGD is the gold standard for diagnosis.

TREATMENT
For both squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the
esophagus, the standard of care with curative intent is surgery alone or
in combination with radiation and chemotherapy.
Mounting evidence suggests that adjuvant chemotherapy followed by
surgery may be effective therapy.
Severe dysphagia may be relieved with palliative beam radiation therapy
or endoscopic stent placement.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Once Barrett’s esophagus is diagnosed, repeat endoscopic biopsies
should be performed in 1 year’s time. If no dysplasia is noted on
histopathology at either endoscopic procedure, further surveillance can
be performed in 3 years’ time.
If low-grade dysplasia is discovered, follow-up is recommended in 6
months. Stable low-grade dysplasia on two consecutive surveillance
procedures 6 months apart can be followed up in 1- to 2-year intervals.
If high-grade dysplasia is found, the patient should be referred for
endoscopic ablation or esophagectomy.7 In patients with severe surgical
risks or those declining invasive therapy, surveillance can be repeated in
3-month intervals.
A proportion of patients referred to surgery with high-grade dysplasia
may have undetected adenocarcinoma.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Five-year survival rates for both squamous cell carcinoma and
adenocarcinoma of the esophagus remain poor at 10% to 15%.3
186

However, a cure is possible with early diagnosis. This is the basis for
endoscopic surveillance for high-grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ in
patients with Barrett’s esophagus.

INFECTIOUS ESOPHAGITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Infectious esophagitis is most commonly seen in the
immunosuppressed patient.
Fungal and viral diseases are the most common agents in this patient
population.
There are rare instances where infectious esophagitis is encountered in
immunocompetent hosts.
Epidemiology

Since the recognition of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in
the 1980s, the incidence of infectious esophagitis has increased, and the
causal organisms have shifted over the past 20 years.
Approximately 30% of patients with HIV infection have symptoms of
infectious esophagitis during the course of their disease.8
Etiology

Fungal Esophagitis
Candidiasis is the most common infectious disease of the esophagus in
patients with HIV, accounting for 70% of cases.8
The most common species is Candida albicans, but other species of
Candida have been implicated.
Other fungi, such as Histoplasma capsulatum, can cause esophagitis, but
these infections are rare.
In AIDS patients that present with multiple infectious pathogens
simultaneously, Candida is almost always one of the causal organisms.
Viral Esophagitis
The most common viral cause of esophagitis in patients infected with
187

HIV is cytomegalovirus (CMV). The risk of infection with CMV is low in
patients with CD4 counts >100.8
Varicella zoster virus (VZV) can cause a devastating esophagitis in
severely immunocompromised hosts. VZV esophagitis is rare in
immunocompetent patients but can be seen in children with chicken pox
or adults with herpes zoster.
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is an uncommon etiology of viral esophagitis
in both immunosuppressed and immunocompetent patients.
Other viruses, such as human papillomavirus and Epstein–Barr virus, can
infect the esophagus, but are extremely rare.
Bacterial Esophagitis
Bacterial infection of the esophagus in HIV patients is rare.
Causal organisms include Mycobacterium avium complex, Mycobacterium
tuberculosis, Nocardia, Actinomyces, and Lactobacillus.
Idiopathic Esophagitis
Idiopathic esophageal ulceration (IEU) is common in patients with a CD4
count 50.8
The etiologic agent of this disease has not been determined, although
HIV itself has been implicated.
Risk Factors

HIV or AIDS
Ongoing treatment with chemotherapy
Immunosuppressive therapy following organ transplantation

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation often varies depending on the causal organism.
History

Candidiasis
Dysphagia is the most common symptom.
Patients will often have thrush.
188

Odynophagia, fever, nausea, and vomiting are less common.
Cytomegalovirus
Odynophagia and chest pain are the most common symptoms.
Dysphagia is uncommon.
Patients may also have a low-grade fever, nausea, and vomiting.
Herpes simplex virus
Most commonly present with both dysphagia and odynophagia, as well
as chest pain and fever.
Varicella zoster virus
Presentation is similar to that of HSV.
The characteristic skin lesions of chickenpox in children and zoster in
adults may be helpful in diagnosis.
Idiopathic esophageal ulceration
Almost all patients with IEU present with severe odynophagia and, as a
result, are malnourished and dehydrated at presentation.
Physical Examination

The patient’s vital signs may reveal fever and orthostatic hypotension
from dehydration.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

An elevated white blood cell (WBC) count may suggest infection,
although this finding is variable in patients with immunodeficiency.
The CD4 count in useful in determining which causal pathogen is most
likely involved in patients with AIDS (Table 12-1).
Diagnostic Procedures

EGD is typically only recommended in Candida esophagitis if a patient
fails empiric antifungal therapy or if symptoms include weight loss,
dehydration, or fever.
EGD can distinguish between the types of esophageal infections
by gross or histologic appearance of the lesions:
Candidiasis—Multiple adherent, white or yellow, “cottage cheese”
plaques are easily seen on endoscopy. Brushings or biopsies reveal yeast
or budding hyphae.
189

CMV—Large, well-demarcated ulcers are visualized on gross
examination and immunohistochemistry staining of biopsy specimens
aids in the diagnosis.
VZV—Multiple vesicles and confluent ulcers are seen on EGD. Cytology is
difficult to distinguish from HSV and often requires
immunohistochemistry or culture.
HSV—Characterized by small, superficial ulcers in early disease and by
diffuse esophagitis in later stages. Cytology reveals giant cells and
ground-glass nuclei.
IEU—Well-circumscribed, often large, ulcers are seen on gross
examination. Biopsies are useful primarily to rule out other infectious
etiologies.9

TREATMENT
Treatment focuses on eradicating the causal organism.
Many clinicians recommend an empiric course of fluconazole to treat
Candida esophagitis in patients with AIDS and dysphagia, but without
other symptoms.
Medications

Candidiasis
The first-line agent is fluconazole 200 mg loading dose followed by 100
mg daily for 5 to 10 days.9
In patients with azole-resistant Candida, the oral dose of fluconazole
190

may be increased, or treatment with intravenous (IV) amphotericin can
be initiated.
Severe, refractory cases may not improve until treatment of HIV is
undertaken to raise the CD4 count.
Cytomegalovirus
First line therapy is IV ganciclovir 5 mg/kg q12h if the patient is not
pancytopenic.
Alternate therapy consists of IV foscarnet 60 mg/kg q8h.
Regardless of the regimen, treatment continues until healing occurs,
usually up to 1 month.
Approximately 30% of patients relapse.10
Herpes simplex virus
First-line therapy is acyclovir 5 mg/kg IV q8h for 7 to 14 days or 400 mg
by mouth 5 times a day for 14 to 21 days.9
Other effective agents include famciclovir, valacyclovir, and ganciclovir.
Varicella zoster virus
First line therapy is acyclovir 5 mg/kg IV q8h for 7 to 14 days.9
Idiopathic esophageal ulceration
The mainstay of treatment for idiopathic esophageal ulceration is
corticosteroids.
If the patient cannot tolerate PO intake, then IV formulations are used.
Given that corticosteroids predispose patients to Candida infection, many
clinicians prescribe fluconazole twice weekly for prophylaxis.
Thalidomide can be used in refractory cases.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Many of these diseases have high recurrence rates and warrant
prophylaxis.
Primary prophylaxis of Candida is not recommended. However,
secondary prophylaxis with fluconazole 100 mg weekly is recommended
in patients with multiple recurrences.
Although primary prophylaxis of CMV is recommended in patients with
CD4 100, there is no evidence that it decreases the incidence of
gastrointestinal disease.
Primary prophylaxis for HSV is not recommended. However, secondary
191

prophylaxis with acyclovir 600 mg daily by mouth is recommended in
patients with a history of recurrent disease.10
Thalidomide can be used in refractory cases.

EOSINOPHILIC ESOPHAGITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
During the last few decades, there has been a sharp increase in the
number of patients with esophageal eosinophilia who were thought to
have GERD but did not respond to traditional medical or surgical
management.
A unique disease termed eosinophilic esophagitis is identified in many
of these patients.
Definition

Although eosinophilic infiltration of the esophagus can be seen
secondarily in association with other conditions such as GERD,
eosinophilic esophagitis is now recognized as a primary diagnosis.
Eosinophilic esophagitis is a clinicopathologic disease characterized by
Symptoms of food impaction and dyphagia in adults, and feeding
intolerance or GERD in children.
More than 15 eosinophils/high power field on pathologic examination.
Exclusion of other disorders with similar clinical or pathologic findings,
especially GERD.11
Epidemiology

For unclear reasons, there seems to be an increasing incidence of
eosinophilic esophagitis that is not solely accounted for by increasing
recognition.
Disease occurs in all age groups but symptoms usually appear either in
early childhood, adolescence, or before the fourth decade of life.12 Males
comprise 70% of cases.13
192

Pathophysiology

The pathogenesis of eosinophilic esophagitis is unknown.
There is some thought that the disease process originates from an
immune-mediated response to a swallowed allergen.13
Once eosinophils have infiltrated the esophageal mucosa, their presence
appears to trigger a self-sustaining cascade of inflammatory mediators.
Risk Factors

There seems to be an increased incidence of eosinophilic esophagitis in
pediatric patients with a history of asthma, allergic rhinitis, eczema, and
food or environmental allergies. This association has not been fully
studied in the adult population.
There is also a reported association of eosinophilic esophagitis in adults
with eosinophilic gastroenteritis and peripheral eosinophilia.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

A thorough history and physical examination should be performed.
History

Questions regarding the risk factors listed above should be elicited.
The most common presenting symptoms are dysphagia, heartburn, and
chest pain.
Less common presenting symptoms include a history of food impaction or
symptoms consistent with esophageal dysmotility.
Patients may have a diagnosis of GERD in the past but have failed highdose PPI.
Physical Examination

No physical examination findings are specific to or indicative of this
diagnosis.
Diagnostic Criteria

193

Generally speaking, the diagnosis is most often made on the basis of the
presence of characteristic clinical features, the presence of eosinophils
on biopsy, and exclusion of other possible diagnoses (e.g., GERD,
parasitic and fungal infections, Crohn’s disease, allergic vasculitis, and
other connective tissue diseases).
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for esophageal eosinophilia includes:
GERD
Eosinophilic esophagitis
Eosinophilic gastroenteritis
Crohn’s disease
Connective tissue disease
Hypereosinophilic syndrome
Infection
Drug hypersensitivity response11
Diagnostic Testing

Typically, a thorough history and physical is not enough to make a
definitive diagnosis and further evaluation is warranted.
Laboratories

A CBC can be performed to evaluate for peripheral eosinophilia,
although this phenomenon is more frequently seen in the pediatric
population.14
Imaging

A barium swallow may add further data regarding a patient’s anatomy
and assessing for dominant strictures, but is not required in the routine
management of this disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

EGD with biopsies along the length of the esophagus should be
performed to confirm the diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis.
Gross mucosal abnormalities include longitudinal furrowing, friability,
edema, longitudinal shearing, whitish exudates, raised white specks,
194

“crepe paper mucosa,” narrow caliber esophagus, rings, felinization, and
transient or fixed rings.11
The esophageal mucosa is grossly abnormal by endoscopy in more than
half of patients.
Biopsy specimens should be obtained regardless of the gross appearance
of the esophageal mucosa. In a study of 381 children with eosinophilic
esophagitis, 30% had a grossly normal esophagus.11
Biopsies should be obtained in the stomach and duodenum to determine
whether the disease is confined to the esophagus or is a manifestation of
another process, such as eosinophilic gastroenteritis or inflammatory
bowel disease.
Patients will have normal pH monitoring of the distal esophagus in
contrast to GERD.
Some physicians have suggested allergen skin testing in order to
avoid potential precipitating foods or allergens.

TREATMENT
Currently, there is no universally accepted treatment regimen for this
disease.
Medications

Medications are the mainstay of treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis.
First Line

Currently, the most commonly accepted course of treatment is topical
corticosteroids.
One of the primary studies supporting the use of topical steroids in this
manner involved the use of fluticasone.
Patients were instructed to swallow rather than inhale the medication.
Relief of dysphagia was seen in all study participants within the initial
week of treatment.14
Second Line

Systemic corticosteroids have been shown to have significant benefit
in pediatric patients.
195

However, symptoms recur quickly on cessation and, given the deleterious
side effects of long-term systemic corticosteroid use, this remains a poor
treatment option.
Systemic steroids are an option when urgent symptom relief is required
(severe dysphagia, dehydration, weight loss, stricture, etc.).
Third Line

A humanized anti–IL-5 antibody, mepolizumab, has been studied over
the past few years and preliminary results show that it is effective in
improving the clinical and pathologic disease in patients with eosinophilic
esophagitis.13
This medication may replace those listed above if future studies
demonstrate its safety and efficacy in adults and children.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

Avoidance of known food and environmental allergens may
provide relief in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis.
In one study, 26 of 35 patients showed significant improvement clinically
and histologically after initiating a diet free of the 6 most common
allergenic foods (dairy, eggs, wheat, soy, peanuts, fish/shellfish).11
Elemental, amino acid–based formulas have been shown to be
extremely effective in the pediatric population but usually have to be
administered by gastrostomy or nasogastric tubes and are quite costly.

COMPLICATIONS
Chronic inflammation from eosinophilic esophagitis can lead to proximal
esophageal strictures as well as mucosal rings, esophageal ulceration,
and esophageal polyps.
Some patients with significant dysphagia and strictures require
esophageal dilation to relieve symptoms.
While there is a risk of perforation, this procedure is relatively safe and
the dysphagia often resolves for several months.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
196

The prognosis of eosinophilic esophagitis is not well described although
the consensus is that it does not appear to limit life expectancy.11
Esophageal metaplasia or malignancy has not been reported in patients
with eosinophilic esophagitis, even in adults with advanced disease.11

ESOPHAGEAL STRICTURES

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Esophageal strictures often arise as complications of other disease
processes.
Any type of chronic inflammation can lead to esophageal strictures.
Etiology

Peptic strictures
Peptic strictures are relatively common, occurring in approximately 10%
of patients with GERD.15
Stricturing occurs typically in the distal esophagus, often just proximal to
the squamocolumnar junction.
Schatzki’s rings
This process often occurs in the distal esophagus, at the
squamocolumnar junction. By definition, Schatzki’s rings have squamous
mucosa on the proximal aspect, and gastric columnar mucosa on the
distal aspect.
Schatzki’s rings can be associated with GERD, pill esophagitis, and hiatal
hernias.16

termed “steakhouse syndrome.”

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

A careful history is crucial in the assessment of dysphagia.
In addition to helping rule out diseases other than stricture, the type of
dysphagia and regurgitation can often localize the sire and involvement
of disease.
History

Key points of the history should include
Onset and duration of symptoms
Association of dysphagia with types of food
Description of regurgitated material if present
History of weight loss
History of GERD
Evaluation for other risk factors listed above
Physical Examination

Physical signs of weight loss, dehydration, and malnutrition help to
assess severity of disease.
198

Diagnostic Testing

Management of suspected esophageal stricture involves several different
diagnostic modalities.
Laboratories

Laboratory studies are generally not useful in the workup of stricture.
Anemia may support the diagnosis of esophageal inflammation,
neoplasia, Plummer–Vinson syndrome.17
A low albumin concentration may reflect nutritional deficiency.
Imaging

Barium swallow is a useful test in the workup of suspected stricture,
ring, or web, especially when the lesion is subtle and not recognized on
an upper endoscopy.15 Barium swallow is not recommended as the initial
test in new onset dysphagia, as endoscopy provides both definitive
diagnosis and therapy of strictures. If radiologic findings demonstrate a
narrowing of the esophagus, dilation at endoscopy is warranted.
Diagnostic Procedures

EGD permits the operator to directly visualize the stricture, web, or ring.
Further, biopsies can be performed to further evaluate the etiology, and
dilation allows therapy of the stricture.

TREATMENT
Peptic Stricture
Aggressive acid control with high-dose proton pump inhibitor can cause
regression of the stricture.
Dilation is often required, and is performed endoscopically.
Limited data exists on the benefit of stent placement for benign
strictures and carries the risk of stent migration.16 Currently, stent
placement is not considered routine with benign strictures.
Occasionally, dysphagia is not relieved by maximal medical therapy, and
surgery is required.
Schatzki’s Ring
199

Patients with mild disease should be advised to chew their food
carefully.
Patients with more severe disease are at an increased risk for food bolus
impaction and benefit from passage of an endoscopic dilator.
Refractory cases may require pneumatic dilation, electrocautery incision,
or surgical repair.
All patients with Schatzki’s rings should be evaluated for GERD and
started on PPI therapy, if indicated.16

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with Plummer–Vinson syndrome have an increased risk of
developing squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus.
It is unclear whether they should undergo screening EGD.17

ESOPHAGEAL MOTILITY DISORDERS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Motility disorders of the esophagus can involve both the striated and
smooth muscle of the esophagus.
These diseases can result in extreme morbidity for patients.
Definition

Swallowing involves two types of muscular activity:
It is initiated by neural impulses from the central nervous system,
controlling voluntary, striated muscles of the oropharynx.
It is completed by the involuntary contraction of the smooth muscle of
the esophagus in a coordinated sequence.
Dysfunction at either step can cause dysphagia.
Etiology

Striated muscle dysfunction can be affected by:
200

Cerebrovascular accident
Myasthenia gravis
Polymyositis
Parkinson’s disease
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
Causes of smooth muscle failure include:
Invasive cancer
Infectious (Chagas’ disease)
Neurologic (achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm, nutcracker esophagus)
Autoimmune (scleroderma)18
Pathophysiology

In striated muscle, neuromuscular dysregulation results in the loss of a
coordinated swallow and can lead to oropharyngeal dysphagia,
regurgitation, and pulmonary aspiration.
Smooth muscle dysfunction is caused by the loss of inhibitory
neurons in the esophagus leading to disorganized peristalsis (mainly in
the form of loss of sequencing of peristalsis, simultaneous waves,
exaggerated wave amplitude, and prolonged wave duration) and
increased LES tone with abnormal sphincter relaxation during swallows.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The most common symptoms of esophageal motor disorders are
dysphagia and chest pain
In contrast, patients with oropharyngeal dysphagia often present with
drooling, regurgitation of food immediately after swallowing, and
pulmonary aspiration.
History

As with strictures, the type, duration, and severity of dysphagia are
important to address with a good history.
A description of regurgitated contents is useful in differentiating
201

esophageal versus oropharyngeal causes.
Patients with diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) or nutcracker esophagus
often present with intermittent chest pain exacerbated by hot or cold
items. Given that the chest pain sometimes radiates to other parts of the
body, it is important to rule our myocardial ischemia in this population.
The history should focus on conditions that can cause motility
disorders, such as cerebrovascular accident, amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis, and myasthenia gravis.
A history of travel to Central and South American countries may
warrant workup for Chagas’ disease.
Physical Examination

The physical examination should include a thorough neurologic
examination as well as assessment of nutritional status.
Diagnostic Testing

Barium swallow and esophageal manometry are very useful in
diagnosing esophageal motility disorders. Well-defined motor disorders
such as achalasia can also be identified on endoscopy.
Imaging

Barium Swallow:
In patients with achalasia, barium swallow often reveals a characteristic
“bird’s beak” tapered distal esophagus with proximal dilatation. This
appearance can also occur with neoplastic compression of the lower
esophagus (pseudoachalasia).18
In patients with DES, barium swallow demonstrates the typical
“corkscrew” or “rosary bead” appearance.18
Nutcracker esophagus often appears normal on barium swallow
Diagnostic Procedures

High-resolution manometry utilizes pressure sensors along the length
of the esophagus allowing for measurement of intraluminal pressure as a
continuum along the length of the entire esophagus. This allows for the
construction of colored topographic Clouse plots.19 Disease-specific
findings include the following:
202

In achalasia, esophageal manometry reveals a lack of primary peristalsis
and increased LES tone. If patients have simultaneous and repetitive
contractions, the disease is termed vigorous achalasia. High-resolution
manometry has identified three types of achalasia, type I with low
amplitude esophageal body pressure compartmentalization, reflecting
esophageal dilation; type II, with high amplitude pressure
compartmentalization; and type III with spastic features in ≥20%
sequences. All forms are associated with elevated LES postswallow
residual pressures.
Manometry in DES reveals >20% simultaneous contractions involving
the smooth muscle esophagus.
Nutcracker esophagus is defined by elevated distal esophageal
peristaltic amplitude > 180 mmHg.18
EGD
In suspected cases of achalasia, EGD should always be performed to
exclude mass lesions as a cause of pseudoachalasia.
EGD is typically normal in patients with DES or nutcracker esophagus.

TREATMENT
Treatment regimens differ for each class of dysmotility.
Medications

In achalasia, endoscopic botulinum toxin injection of the LES may
temporize symptoms till more effective therapy is available, or can be
used as sole therapy in elderly patients where more effective modalities
are contraindicated because of comorbidities. Effective therapy requires
repeated injection, as efficacy wanes after a median of 9 to 12 months.18
Patients with DES and nutcracker esophagus can be treated with
nitrates and calcium channel blockers for symptomatic relief. Spastic
disorders have a perceptive component to symptomatology, presumably
from coexistent visceral hypersensitivity, that may require
neuromodulator therapy (e.g., low-dose tri-cyclic antidepressants,
particularly for chest pain). Obstructive symptoms (dysphagia,
regurgitation) may improve with botulinum toxin injection if abnormal
LES relaxation can be demonstrated. PPI therapy can also be included
203

in the regimen, if acid reflux is thought to contribute to symptoms.
The medical treatment of scleroderma should involve aggressive acid
control with high-dose PPI.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Endoscopic pneumatic dilation of the LES to 30 to 40 mm disrupts
the LES, and is effective in achalasia patients, often offering immediate
relief. Esophageal perforation can occur in 2% to 5%, requiring
emergent surgery in some instances.
Endoscopic dilation is typically not useful in DES and nutcracker
esophagus.
Surgical Management

Laparoscopic surgical myotomy of the LES with partial fundoplication
may offer definitive resolution of achalasia symptoms, with the added
benefit of protection against reflux with the fundoplication.
This procedure offers durable efficacy compared with medications and
botulinum toxin injection.
The choice between surgical myotomy and pneumatic dilation depends
on institutional expertise.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with achalasia have an increased risk of squamous cell
esophageal carcinoma (developing in 2% to 7%) and there is debate
whether regular surveillance EGD should be performed.20

PEPTIC ULCER DISEASE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Gastric disorders, especially peptic ulcer disease (PUD), are among the
most common illnesses encountered by both internists and
gastroenterologists.
PUD accounts for a significant portion of health care expenditures and
can lead to potentially life-threatening complications.
Definition

PUD is characterized by the denudation of mucosa extending into the
muscularis propria layer from exposure to gastric acid.
Lesions 5 mm in diameter are called erosions, whereas lesions >5 mm in
diameter are called ulcers.
PUD most commonly occurs in the gastric antrum or duodenal bulb;
duodenal ulcers are more common than gastric ulcers in Western
countries.
Epidemiology

207

PUD is a worldwide problem; the current global annual incidence rate of
physician-diagnosed PUD is estimated to b~0.1% to 0.2%.1
Although the incidence of PUD has fallen since the 1950s with improved
hygiene and socioeconomic conditions and decreased Helicobacter pylori
infection rates, the number of hospital admissions for PUD-related
complications does not appear to have decreased.2
The mortality rate of PUD has remained stable over the past two
decades and comes mostly from the four major complications of PUD—
hemorrhage, perforation, penetration to adjacent organs, and gastric
outlet obstruction.
Duodenal ulcers are slightly more common in men than in women, but
gastric ulcers occur with equal frequency in both genders.
Duodenal ulcers present at a slightly younger age range than gastric
ulcers: ages 25 to 55 years versus ages 40 to 70 years, respectively. This
difference likely derives from the increased use of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are associated primarily with gastric
ulcers, especially in the elderly population.
Etiology

Table 13-1 lists etiologies of peptic ulcers. H. pylori–associated PUD and
NSAID-associated PUD account for >90% of PUDs.
In patients in whom H. pylori, NSAID use, Crohn’s disease, and ZollingerEllison syndrome have been ruled out, no apparent etiology is found in
as many as 50% of cases, termed idiopathic PUD.3 Many of these could
still represent partially treated H. pylori and NSAID etiologies that have
not been determined from routine clinical evaluation and investigation.
Other factors include increased acid output and rapid gastric emptying,
which have been associated with idiopathic PUD.

208

Helicobacter pylori–associated PUD
H. pylori is a gram-negative bacillus that lives in the mucous layer
overlying gastric epithelium, leading to inflammation. It can also be
found within epithelial cells and attached to mucous cells.
H. pylori infection is associated with lower socioeconomic status and is
typically acquired in childhood.4
H. pylori infection has been traditionally associated with up to 90% of
duodenal ulcers and 70% to 90% of gastric ulcers. The incidence of H.
pylori infection in PUD is decreasing in the United States. Recent studies
have shown that 20% to 50% of ulcers in the United States are not
associated with H. pylori, though the proportion of H. pylori–negative
ulcers elsewhere in the world remains much lower.3
In the case of duodenal ulcers, H. pylori is thought to infect the non–
acid-secreting gastric antrum or ectopic gastric mucosa in the duodenum,
thus stimulating gastrin release and leading to increased acid production
from the more proximal acid-secreting fundic mucosa (relatively spared
from inflammation). This increased gastric acid secretion can result in an
increased duodenal acid load and ulceration.5
Conversely, H. pylori infection that damages the acid-producing mucosa
of the stomach can lead to hypochlorhydria or achlorhydria, and
subsequent gastric ulceration.
209

Therefore, gastric ulcers are typically associated with normal or reduced
levels of acid secretion, whereas duodenal ulcers are generally
characterized by increased levels of acid secretion.
Although it does not appear to have a predominant virulence factor, the
ability of H. pylori to induce gastritis likely stems from a combination of
factors.6
The organism secretes a urease enzyme that breaks down urea in the
stomach to produce ammonia, which neutralizes the acidic gastric
environment and thereby protects the bacteria.
This urease activity provides the basis for many of the laboratory tests
used to evaluate for H. pylori infection.
H. pylori infection is also thought to increase the permeability of the
gastric mucous layer to pepsin and acid.
Finally, the bacterium produces a cytotoxin (CagA) that may also
contribute to its pathogenicity.
H. pylori is a risk factor for gastric adenocarcinoma (which develops in
0.1% to 3% of infected patients) and gastric mucosa–associated
lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma (in 0.01% of infected patients).
NSAID-associated PUD
NSAID use has been associated with 30% to 75% of H. pylori–negative
ulcers and 15% of H. pylori–positive ulcers. It is the second most
common cause of PUD after H. pylori infection.
The rate of serious gastrointestinal (GI) complications in patients taking
long-term NSAIDs is 7.3 per 1000 patients per year for osteoarthritis and
13 per 1000 patients per year for rheumatoid arthritis.7
NSAIDs have a direct toxic effect from acidic composition and from the
ability to decrease hydrophobicity of gastric mucus, allowing epithelial
injury by acid and pepsin.
The predominant mechanism of NSAID-associated PUD is inhibition of
endogenous prostaglandin synthesis. Therefore, enteric-coated,
parenteral, or rectal NSAIDs present the same risk for ulcers as their oral
counterparts. Administration of NSAIDs with food does not decrease
ulcer risk.
Suppression of prostaglandin synthesis is mediated through inhibition of
the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 enzyme, a “housekeeping” enzyme that
maintains integrity of the gastric mucosa where it is constitutively
expressed.
210

Inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis decreases mucous production,
bicarbonate secretion, mucosal perfusion, epithelial proliferation, and
mucosal resistance to injury. These changes impair the integrity of the
mucosa, allowing damage by harmful factors such as NSAIDs, pepsin,
bile salts, and acid.
COX-2–selective NSAIDs are less likely to cause GI complications
because COX-2 enzyme, which mediates NSAID anti-inflammatory
effects, is not expressed in gastric mucosa.7
NSAID use can cause a spectrum of lesions ranging from superficial
erosions to ulcers that bleed or perforate. These affect any area of the
stomach, but the gastric antrum is most frequently involved. Endoscopic
evidence of mucosal damage has been found in up to two-thirds of
patients who use NSAIDs and frank ulceration has been found in 10% to
25%.
Superficial lesions include petechiae and erosions, likely from direct toxic
effects of NSAIDs and may occur within hours of NSAID administration.
These are typically confined to the mucosa where they do not cause
complications.
NSAID-associated ulcers can be complicated by hemorrhage and
perforation. These complications occur with similar frequency among
duodenal and gastric ulcers. Risk of hemorrhage is highest in the early
treatment period in first-time users but can occur at any time during the
course of treatment.
Platelet dysfunction may contribute to the tendency toward hemorrhage,
especially with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
Uncontrolled acid hypersecretion in the setting of gastrin-producing
endocrine tumors (gastrinoma) of the pancreas or duodenum, termed
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, accounts for only 0.1% of all peptic ulcers.
The syndrome includes multiple peptic ulcers, severe erosive
esophagitis, and secretory diarrhea.
The increased gastrin levels cause histamine release from
enterochromaffin-like cells in the gastric mucosa. The histamine then
binds to histamine receptors on parietal cells, causing hypersecretion of
hydrochloric acid. Peptic ulcers develop, as the normal defense
mechanisms against acid are overwhelmed by the high gastric acid
output.
211

Ulcers typically form in the duodenal bulb but may also be seen in the
distal duodenum and jejunum, and multiple ulcers are commonly seen.
Diarrhea may also develop because of gastric acid–mediated damage to
the small bowel mucosa resulting in net intestinal secretion. The
excessive volume of gastric secretion may be contributory.
The diagnosis should be suspected in any patient with multiple ulcers in
unusual locations or in patients with a family history suggestive of
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I.
An elevated gastrin level suggests the diagnosis in patients who make
gastric acid. This can be assessed by aspirating a small volume of gastric
secretions through a nasogastric tube or at endoscopy and testing the
pH using litmus paper. A secretin stimulation test or formal fasting
gastric acid output analysis help confirm the diagnosis.
Pathophysiology

Although the pathophysiology of PUD is not entirely understood, it is
believed to arise from an imbalance between gastric mucosal protective
factors (provided in part by prostaglandins) and destructive influences
that include H. pylori, pepsin, NSAIDs, bile salts, and acid.
Risk Factors

Table 13-2 displays a list of known risk factors associated with PUD. The
two major risk factors for PUD are H. pylori infection and NSAID use.
Risk factors for the development of NSAID-associated PUD include
concomitant corticosteroid use, anticoagulants, and older age (Table 133). Corticosteroids alone are not a risk factor for PUD.
The role of H. pylori infection in NSAID-associated PUD remains
incompletely defined. It is generally believed, however, that H. pylori
and NSAIDs may act synergistically to induce PUD.8

212

DIAGNOSIS
In patients who present with symptoms that are suggestive of PUD, the
diagnostic approach should attempt both to locate the anatomic
abnormality and to explore its cause (often beginning with determining
whether H. pylori infection is present).
Clinical Presentation
History

History alone is unreliable in diagnosing PUD. Approximately two-thirds
of patients who report dyspepsia have nonulcer or functional dyspepsia,
and up to 40% of patients with active PUD have no abdominal pain, or
“silent ulcers”.9
The classic symptom complex of a patient with a gastric ulcer includes
213

pain that occurs 5 to 15 minutes after oral intake and is relieved with
fasting. For this reason, patients with gastric ulcers may learn to avoid
food and thus lose weight.
In contrast, patients with duodenal ulceration may have pain that
occurs when acid is secreted in the absence of a food buffer and is
temporarily relieved with eating but returns 1 to 2 hours later. However,
this temporal relationship between pain and meals can be nonspecific,
and the relief afforded by food can also be found in nonulcer dyspepsia.
Because of the potential for duodenal ulcers to result in right upper
quadrant pain, the presentation may mimic that of acute cholecystitis or
a biliary colic.
Perforation of a peptic ulcer may be heralded by an acute change in
symptoms and sudden onset of severe diffuse abdominal pain.
Chronic PUD can lead to scarring and gastric outlet obstruction, when
nausea, vomiting, or weight loss may be prominent.
Patients should be carefully questioned about NSAID and ASA use,
including over-the-counter NSAIDS, even if patients have discontinued
NSAID use.
NSAID-associated ulcers are more likely than other forms of peptic ulcers
to be painless and present initially with bleeding rather than dyspepsia.
Physical Examination

In the absence of complicated PUD, the physical examination is not very
helpful. Patients may have epigastric tenderness; however, the
sensitivity (~65%) and specificity (~30%) of epigastric tenderness on
palpation are very limited.9
Patients with perforated peptic ulcers usually exhibit signs of peritonitis.
Patients with bleeding ulcers may have fecal occult blood, melena, or
hematemesis. If patients are hemodynamically compromised, they may
be tachycardic or hypotensive.
Bleeding may be the presenting sign in up to 15% of PUD cases.10

214

Differential Diagnosis

Table 13-4 lists a differential diagnosis for upper abdominal pain.
Of note, it is difficult to differentiate functional or nonulcer dyspepsia
from PUD on the basis of clinical examination. There are no diagnostic
tests for functional dyspepsia, rendering it a diagnosis of exclusion.
Many medications can cause dyspeptic symptoms, including NSAIDs (with
or without ulceration), iron, theophylline, and digitalis.
Granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis, eosinophilic granuloma,
and Wegener’s granulomatosis, may also present, albeit rarely, with
dyspeptic symptoms.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Routine laboratory studies are usually unremarkable. Complete blood
cell count testing may show iron-deficiency anemia from chronic fecal
occult blood loss or anemia from acute blood loss.
Patients in whom PUD is established or suspected should be tested for H.
pylori infection, as it represents the major risk factor for PUD and can
represent a contributing factor in ulcers with other causes, such as
NSAID use.
215

Serologic tests for IgG antibodies to H. pylori
Serology diagnoses H. pylori infection rather than the presence of PUD
per se.
Because of high sensitivity, serologic tests are more accurate in areas
with a high prevalence of H. pylori.
The most common serologic tests are laboratory-based enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests; the accuracy of ELISA testing can
extend up to 95%.
Less
commonly
used
serology
tests
are
based
on
immunochromatography and Western blot.
Serologic testing is simple and inexpensive, but antibodies to H. pylori
can remain positive for 1 to 2 years after eradication of the infection, so
it is difficult to evaluate H. pylori infection with serology after
treatment.10
Stool antigen testing can be more accurate than serology and can
detect H. pylori only 1 week after discontinuation of proton pump
inhibitor (PPI) therapy.
Urease assays test for the presence of the urease enzyme, which is
produced in high amounts by H. pylori.
These tests include noninvasive urea breath testing as well as biopsy
urease tests.
They can be used to diagnose active infection and to confirm eradication
of infection.
False-negative results can occur in the setting of treatment with PPI,
histamine 2 (H2)-receptor blockers, antibiotics, or bismuth-containing
medications. Therefore, PPI should be held for 7 to 14 days before
testing.
In addition, urease breath testing to confirm eradication of H. pylori
infection should be held until at least 4 to 6 weeks after completing
treatment.
The two forms of the urea breath test are the 14 C-urea breath test and
the 13 C-urea breath test.
These two breath tests use urea that has been labeled with a radioactive
(14C) or nonradioactive (13C) isotope.
Labeled urea is given orally to the patient, and in the presence of
urease, the urea is broken down into ammonia and labeled CO2. After
absorption of CO2 into the circulation, it is expelled into the breath, and
216

13CO
2

can be detected by mass spectroscopy and 14CO2 by scintillation
counting.
Radioactive urea breath testing is contraindicated in pregnant women
and in children.
The theoretical advantage of urea breath testing over biopsy urease
tests is a decreased number of false-negative tests deriving from
sampling error.
Biopsy urease tests may be obtained via endoscopy and are discussed
later.
Culture is not generally performed because it is expensive, timeconsuming, and difficult. Culture should not be considered unless a
patient does not respond to eradication treatment and there is concern
about antibiotic resistance.
Histology may be obtained via endoscopy and is discussed later.
Measurement of serum gastrin levels and/or secretin stimulation
testing may be performed if Zollinger-Ellison syndrome is suspected.
lmaging

Given the advantages of endoscopy, upper GI radiography has a
limited role in the diagnosis of PUD.
A radiographic diagnosis of PUD requires demonstration of barium within
an ulcer niche, but the sensitivity of barium radiography for detecting
PUD depends on the radiologist, and radiography can miss up to half of
all duodenal ulcers.11
Diagnostic Procedures

Upper endoscopy (esophagogastroduodenoscopy, or EGD) is the most
accurate diagnostic test for PUD.
Decisions regarding EGD for patients with symptoms of PUD should be
based on patient symptoms and the risk of gastric cancer. EGD should be
performed in patients who have signs or symptoms worrisome for gastric
cancer (“alarm symptoms”), including anorexia, dysphagia, epigastric
mass, severe vomiting, weight loss, anemia, advanced age, or family
history of upper GI cancer.
Patients with significant dyspepsia, acute GI bleeding, fecal occult blood,
or abdominal pain of unclear etiology should also undergo EGD.
In patients with a high suspicion of PUD, consideration may be given to
217

performing noninvasive testing, such as serology or urease breath
testing without endoscopy, especially if the patient is young and
otherwise healthy, as these noninvasive tests are more cost-effective
than EGD.
Biopsy urease testing is the best endoscopic method of diagnosing H.
pylori infection.
Biopsy urease tests include the CLOtest, PyloriTek, and Hp-fast.
Most of these tests involve a pH-sensitive dye that changes color
because of an increase in pH secondary to the production of ammonia
from urea.
In addition to false-negative results in the setting of prior treatment with
PPI, false-negative results can also occur if blood from recent or active
bleeding is present.
If it is not possible to hold PPI before testing, biopsy samples should be
taken from both the antrum and the fundus to increase the likelihood of
a positive result.
Endoscopic biopsies are indicated in gastric ulcers because of the risk
of malignancy, or in cases of PUD in which urease testing might be
falsely negative (i.e., in the setting of PPI use before endoscopy).
In the case of gastric ulcers, biopsy samples should be obtained from
around the ulcer crater and edges to rule out malignancy, but they
should also be obtained from other areas of the stomach to test for H.
pylori infection.
Biopsy may be less sensitive in the setting of bleeding ulcers, so other
sampling-independent testing, such as serology, should be performed.
Patients with a gastric ulcer should undergo follow-up EGD at 8 to 12
weeks to document ulcer healing and exclude malignancy in most
instances, as follow-up endoscopy improves survival.12
Duodenal ulcers do not require biopsy or repeat EGD because of the
extremely low risk of malignancy.

TREATMENT

Medications

Medications used to treat PUD include antisecretory drugs and mucosal
218

protectants such as sucralfate and prostaglandin analogues.
Antisecretory drugs include H2-receptor antagonists, and PPI.
H2-receptor antagonists
H2-receptor blockers inhibit acid secretion by blocking the binding of
histamine to its receptor on the parietal cell. They inhibit both basal and
food-induced acid secretion.
The H2-receptor blockers available in the United States include
cimetidine, famotidine, nizatidine, and ranitidine.
This class of medications is well tolerated, although doses should be
adjusted in patients with renal insufficiency. They have largely been
replaced by PPIs.
In general, when used in the treatment of PUD, H 2-receptor blockers are
most effective when administered between dinner and bedtime.
Proton pump inhibitors
These medications are prodrugs that, when activated by acid, bind to
and inhibit the parietal cell H+/K+ adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase).
Because they require acid for activation, they are most effectively taken
before or with a meal and in the absence of other antisecretory drugs.
PPIs pose a theoretical risk of inducing enterochromaffin-like cell
hyperplasia and carcinoid tumors, but these medications have been used
safely in the United States for the past decade without a notable
increase in the incidence of carcinoid tumors.

219

Misoprostol
Misoprostol is a prostaglandin analogue.
It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for prophylaxis of
NSAID-induced peptic ulcers.
Because of its mechanism of action, misoprostol can cause diarrhea or
spontaneous abortion.
Treatment of Helicobacter pylori–associated PUD
Treatment requires both antisecretory and antibiotic therapy, as the
eradication of H. pylori infection with antibiotics significantly
lowers the 12-month ulcer recurrence rate from upward of 60% in
patients treated with antisecretory therapy alone to 5%.13
H. pylori–associated ulcers may heal spontaneously but frequently recur
if the infection is not eradicated.
Many regimens have been developed for H. pylori eradication, mostly
through trial and error, and accepted treatment regimens are listed in
Table 13-5. Some regimens are relatively inexpensive but require dosing
four times daily, which may decrease compliance.
Effective regimens typically involve more than one antibiotic to maximize
the likelihood of eradication and prevent the spread of antimicrobial
resistance; monotherapy is inadequate. Amoxicillin and clarithromycin
are pH-dependent antibiotics that work more effectively in combination
with antisecretory drugs. If this “triple therapy” fails, a salvage course of
220

bismuth-containing “quadruple therapy” can eradicate H. pylori infection
in an additional three-fourths of patients. Second-line antimicrobials,
such as levofloxacin, rifabutin, and furazolidone, are often utilized next
or in the case of penicillin allergies.
The success rates of these recommended regimens for eradicating H.
pylori infection appear to have decreased to 70% to 85% with increasing
antibiotic resistance.14 Treatment failure may be secondary to
noncompliance or antibiotic resistance, which occurs most commonly
with metronidazole in the United States.
With regard to the course of antisecretory medications, duodenal
ulcers should be treated for 4 weeks and gastric ulcers should be treated
for 8 weeks. In cases with ulcers >1 cm, complicated PUD, unsuccessful
H. pylori eradication, or H. pylori–negative PUD, it is reasonable to treat
with a longer course of antisecretory therapy. Otherwise, maintenance
antisecretory therapy after treatment of H. pylori infection is not costeffective and is generally unnecessary.
In patients with uncomplicated PUD, confirmation of eradication is not
required because recurrence would most likely also be uncomplicated.
However, testing for H. pylori eradication should be performed in
patients with recurrent symptoms, complicated PUD, gastric MALT
lymphoma, or early gastric cancer. Because of the high rate of bleeding
recurrence in untreated H. pylori–positive bleeding ulcers, testing for
eradication is critical.
Confirmation of cure can be performed by urea breath testing, but it
should be done at least 4 to 6 weeks after completion of H. pylori
therapy and 2 weeks after finishing PPI treatment to avoid false-negative
results. Serology is less useful to document eradication, as the
antibodies to H. pylori may remain positive for 1 to 2 years after
successful eradication.
Treatment of NSAID-associated PUD
Consideration must be given to stopping the offending drug, as
continuation of NSAID use delays ulcer healing. However, discontinuing
the NSAID is not always practical, and in these cases, GI toxicity may be
reduced by decreasing the dose or switching to a less gastrotoxic
medication. Concomitant corticosteroid, anticoagulant, or
bisphosphonate therapy should also be discontinued if possible.
Direct treatment of NSAID-induced PUD is acid suppression with a
221

PPI.
Even with continued NSAID use, acid suppression with PPI therapy
results in 85% of NSAID-induced gastric ulcers and >90% of duodenal
ulcers healing within 8 weeks, whereas acid suppression with
conventional doses of H2-receptor blockers heal ~70% of gastric and
duodenal ulcers within 7 weeks. In this manner, PPI therapy is indicated
for NSAID-associated PUD and should be continued as long as the
patient is being treated with NSAID to reduce the risk of ulcer
recurrence.15
The following patients require gastroprotection with either PPI or
misoprostol during NSAID use: history of a prior ulcer, severe
concomitant disease, concomitant warfarin or corticosteroid use, or
elderly (>65 years).
Lifestyle/Risk Modification

Withdrawal of potential contributing agents such as NSAIDs, cigarettes,
and excess alcohol is indicated.
Patients should be instructed to avoid foods that precipitate dyspepsia,
although no particular dietary recommendations are necessary.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Stress ulcers develop in the stomach and duodenum under situations of
severe physiologic stress and intensive care unit (ICU) admission, such
as mechanical ventilation, coagulopathy, renal failure, head injuries,
burns, and multiple trauma. Pathophysiology involves relative mucosal
ischemia and poor mucosal protection from intraluminal acid when
splanchnic blood supply is shunted to more important organs during
physiologic stress. Erosions and ulcers are demonstrated to form
frequently within the first 2 to 3 days of ICU admission, but complications
(bleeding, perforation) are relatively rare in the present day, attributed
to better ICU care, attention to hemodynamic stability, and stress ulcer
prophylaxis. Patients at risk can be administered intravenous H2receptor antagonists by infusion; PPIs have also been demonstrated to
provide equivalent protection. Sucralfate has also been used successfully
as a prophylactic agent. If bleeding ensues, management is similar to
222

that of nonvariceal upper GI bleeding from peptic ulcers (Chapter 6).

COMPLICATIONS
Hemorrhage
Hemorrhage can occur in ~15% of patients with peptic ulcers. See
Chapter 6 for further discussion on management of GI bleeding from
PUD.
NSAID-associated ulcers are overrepresented among hemorrhagic ulcers.
Hemorrhage can present as either an acute event with hemodynamic
shock or as a slow intermittent blood loss with chronic anemia.
If necessary, endoscopic intervention can be utilized to locate the source
of bleeding and achieve hemostasis with thermal or laser coagulation,
injection sclerotherapy, or mechanical compression with clips.
The administration of intravenous PPIs in acute hemorrhage decreases
rebleeding rates, the need for blood transfusions, and mortality rates.16
Perforation should be suspected in patients with PUD who suddenly
develop severe diffuse abdominal pain and other manifestations of
peritoneal irritation. Plain abdominal radiography may reveal free air
under the diaphragm. Emergent surgery is often indicated for
perforation.
Obstruction of the gastric outlet can develop from ulcers in the
duodenal bulb and/or pyloric channel, and patients can present with
nausea and vomiting. Management typically involves nasogastric tube
placement with measurement of the gastric residual, EGD to facilitate
diagnosis (with balloon dilation in patients who do not respond to
medical therapy), and intravenous PPI therapy.
Penetration occurs when an ulcer penetrates through the bowel wall
without any free perforation or leakage of luminal contents into the
peritoneal cavity. Most commonly, ulcers penetrate into the pancreas,
gastrohepatic omentum, biliary tract, or liver, but only a small proportion
become clinically apparent.

GASTRIC ADENOCARCINOMA

223

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In the early 1900s, gastric cancer represented the most common cancer
in the United States, but since then, the incidence has decreased
dramatically, possibly related to the popularization of refrigeration.
Nevertheless, each year >21,000 patients in the United States have a
diagnosis of gastric cancer, of whom >11,000 are expected to die.17
As recently as the 1980s, gastric cancer represented the leading cause of
cancer deaths worldwide. Of note, H. pylori infection appears to be
associated with an approximately sixfold increase in the risk of gastric
cancer.18
Table 13-6 outlines risk factors for gastric cancer.

DIAGNOSIS
Many patients with gastric cancer are asymptomatic or present with
nonspecific symptoms that can include indigestion, epigastric
discomfort, anorexia, early satiety, and weight loss. By the time
symptoms have been investigated, many gastric cancers are advanced.
The physical examination may reveal an epigastric mass, ascites,
occult blood in stool, or lymphadenopathy.
An enlarged left supraclavicular lymph node (Virchow’s node) or
periumbilical lymph node (Sister Mary Joseph’s node) represents a
metastatic site.
Laboratory evaluation is of limited use but may demonstrate irondeficiency anemia from chronic blood loss from the cancer.
224

Diagnosis is best made with EGD, as it allows for direct visualization
as well as tissue sampling. Most gastric cancers are exophytic or
fungating masses, but some manifest as nonhealing ulcers or with
perforation of the gastric wall.
All gastric ulcers should be aggressively biopsied to exclude malignancy,
and repeat EGD should be performed at 8 to 12 weeks to document
healing in any patient with a gastric ulcer.
Once the diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma is established, staging
should be performed with endoscopic ultrasonography or abdominal
computed tomo-graphic scanning to determine whether surgical
resection is an option.

TREATMENT
Surgical resection offers the only chance for cure.
However, ~60% of gastric cancers are deemed unresectable because of
local or metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis.
Depending on location, partial or total gastrectomy may be performed.
Even with complete resection, 5-year survival rate is only ~20%.
Palliative chemotherapy can be given to patients who are not surgical
candidates, but the median survival is only 6 to 9 months.

GASTROINTESTINAL STROMAL TUMORS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) represent 1% to 2% of all
malignant GI tumors. Before the molecular definition of GIST in 1998,
these lesions were commonly unrecognized and unreported.
Despite the increasing recognition of GIST, its true incidence remains
unknown, although it has been estimated to be ~15 cases per million
persons in the United states.
The median occurrence is in the fifth decade of life, and GIST is found
more commonly in women than in men.
225

In 1998, the pathophysiology of GIST was discovered to involve
mutations in KIT signaling pathways leading to tumor proliferation. The
definition of GIST has subsequently been narrowed to include a subset of
tumors arising from the interstitial cells of Cajal, ~90% of which exhibit
KIT mutations.
GIST can be found throughout the GI tract, although 60% to 70% arise
in the stomach.

DIAGNOSIS
Patients may complain of nonspecific symptoms, such as nausea,
vomiting, or early satiety. GIST may also be discovered incidentally on
endoscopy or imaging.
Alternatively, GIST lesions may present after achieving a large size and
causing mass effect or obstruction, or with acute upper GI hemorrhage.

TREATMENT
Surgical resection represents the treatment of choice for localized
tumors.
However, if the tumor has metastasized, chemotherapy remains an
option.
GIST harbors impressive resistance to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy
agents, but the introduction of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib
mesylate has increased the median survival of patients with advanced
GIST from 20 to 60 months.19

GASTRIC LYMPHOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The GI tract represents the predominant site of primary extranodal
lymphomas.
226

GI lymphomas are most commonly found in the stomach (almost threefourths of cases) in developed countries. More than 90% of gastric
lymphomas are either diffuse large B-cell type or MALT type.
MALT lymphomas comprise 40% of gastric lymphomas and arise from
the transformation of B cells in the marginal zone of the stomach in
response to H. pylori infection.
Although H. pylori infection is a risk factor, the incidence of MALT in H.
pylori–infected individuals is between 1 in 30,000 to 1 in 80,000.

DIAGNOSIS
The most common presenting symptoms are abdominal pain and
dyspepsia; B-type symptoms are rare.
Diagnosis is typically established via EGD with biopsies.

TREATMENT
Up to three-fourths of patients with low-grade MALT lymphomas
experience complete regression after eradication of H. pylori
infection.20
For patients who do not respond to H. pylori eradication, radiation,
chemo-therapy, and surgery represent effective therapeutic options.

INTRODUCTION
The small bowel is approximately 600 cm in length, with a functional
surface area >600 times that of a hollow tube.
The following three features unique to the gut enhance the surface area
of the small intestine:
The plicae circulares, or circular folds, are visible mucosal and
submucosal invaginations located predominantly in the duodenum and
jejunum.
Villi are fingerlike projections, consisting of a layer of epithelial cells
overlying the lamina propria, approximately 0.5 to 1.5 mm long, which
protrude into the intestinal lumen and cover the mucosal surface.
Microvilli, tubular projections visualized by electron microscopy, are
extensions of the apical cell membrane and compose the brush border.
These unique mucosal features create an enormous area for digestion,
absorption, and secretion.

MALABSORPTION

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Small bowel disorders, pancreatic exocrine insufficiency, and cholestatic
liver disease account for most causes of malabsorption.
230

Table 14-1 lists the most common causes of malabsorption. Cholestatic
liver diseases are discussed in Chapter 19. Pancreatic disorders are
discussed in Chapter 21.
Definition

Malabsorption is usually considered an interruption of normal digestion,
absorption, and transport of a number of nutrients and minerals.
Malnutrition, diarrhea, steatorrhea, electrolyte abnormalities, and weight
loss are frequent consequences.
Clinical manifestations of small bowel disorders often reflect deficiencies
of various macro- and micronutrients.
Pathophysiology

Various disease processes (including celiac disease, Whipple’s disease,
tropical sprue, small bowel bacterial overgrowth, radiation or
chemotherapy–induced injury, see subsequent sections) interfere with
mucosal luminal digestion, absorption, and nutrient transport.
The small bowel is primarily responsible for absorbing much of the daily
dietary carbohydrates, proteins, electrolytes, and essential nutrients.

231

80% of injested protein is absorbed in the jejunum and 10% in the
ileum. Diffuse loss of normal jejunal mucosal function (celiac sprue,
extensive surgical resection of the small bowel) can result in protein
malabsorption.
Small bowel disorders can also result in malabsorption of selective
nutrients. Iron, folate, calcium (duodenum), B12, bile salt (ileum), and
fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K (proximal intestine) deficiencies can
occur.

DIAGNOSIS
Clinical features and presentation of intestinal malabsorption form the
cornerstone of diagnosis and result in effects on numerous organ
systems including the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and the hematopoietic,
musculoskeletal, endocrine, epidermal, and nervous systems.
Clinical Presentation

232

Abdominal pain, cramping, excessive flatus, diarrhea (postprandial or
unremitting without prandial exacerbation).
Weight loss despite appropriate appetite and adequate oral intake.
Foul smelling stool with oily character with classic presentation of
“floating on top of the toilet bowl.”
Specific fat-soluble vitamins malabsorption leads to various clinical
findings including night blindness (vitamin A), osteopenia (vitamin D),
bleeding dia-thesis (vitamin K), or neurologic symptoms (vitamin E).
In addition, amenorrhea, infertility, and impotence may manifest as part
of patient history.
Physical examination findings include glossitis, stomatitis (iron, riboflavin,
niacin), tetany (calcium, magnesium, vitamin D), dermatitis (vitamin A,
zinc), peripheral neuropathy (B12 deficiency), and edema (protein-losing
enteropathy).
Differential Diagnosis

Infectious, secretory, and inflammatory causes of diarrhea must be
excluded.
Pancreatic exocrine insufficiency and hepatobiliary disease resulting in
intraluminal bile salt deficiency (biliary strictures, cholestatic liver
diseases) can result in intraluminal maldigestion and malabsorption.
Associated malabsorption symptoms must be evaluated on their own
accord.
For example, alternative causes of weight loss including malignancy,
hormonal disorders, and inflammatory/autoimmune disorders should be
evaluated.
Postprandial abdominal cramping should be evaluated for etiologies such
as peptic ulcer disease, cholelithiasis, pancreatitis, and so forth.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Laboratory test abnormalities include macrocytic (folate, Vitamin B12
deficiency) and microcytic (iron deficiency) anemia, elevated
INR/prolonged prothrombin time (vitamin K deficiency), and decreased
serum calcium (calcium malabsorption or vitamin D deficiency).
Low serum magnesium and zinc levels, decreased serum albumin, and
233

low cholesterol may also be found.
Fecal fat analysis provides a simple, rapid, inexpensive screening test
for mal-absorption.1
Measurement includes fecal fat quantification for 48 to 72 hours while
patient is on a defined intake of fat, typically 100 g/day.
Normally, >95% of dietary fat is absorbed; consequently >5 g/day of
fecal fat is diagnostic of steatorrhea.
Fecal fat analysis does not distinguish among intestinal, hepatobiliary,
and pancreatic causes of malabsorption, although the level of
steatorrhea associated with pancreatic insufficiency (~50 g) tends to be
higher than the level for intestinal disease (~20g).2
Xylose absorption test
This test assesses the absorptive capacity of the small intestine and
determines whether a small bowel disorder is present.1,3
This test is usually performed for further diagnostic purposes once
malabsorption is determined.
d -Xylose is a 5-carbon sugar primarily absorbed passively in the small
intestine. Intraluminal digestion is not required and urinary excretion
reflects the mucosa’s ability to absorb it.
This test is performed by administration of 25 g of xylose orally, followed
by measurement of urinary excretion, hydrogen breath testing (discussed
below), or serum concentration of xylose. A 5-hour urine collection
contains at least 5 g of d-xylose.
This test can therefore differentiate between pancreatic disorders (dxylose concentration within normal limits) and true mucosal
malabsorptive processes (d-xylose concentration decreased post
administration). 3,4
It is important to note that certain bacterial species may metabolize dxylose causing concurrent bacterial overgrowth–mediated decreased dxylose levels.
Low urinary excretion will also occur when delayed gastric emptying,
impaired renal function, or ascites is present.
Hydrogen breath tests
Hydrogen breath tests are based on the principle that hydrogen is
produced by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates that have escaped
absorption in the small intestine. A portion of this hydrogen diffuses into
the blood stream and is subsequently exhaled by the lungs and analyzed
234

in breath. Commonly used carbohydrates include lactose, fructose,
glucose, and nonabsorbable compounds such as lactulose.5
Hydrogen breath tests can be used to diagnose disaccharidase (lactase)
deficiency and lactose intolerance in association with symptoms of
abdominal pain, gas, and diarrhea with lactose intake. It is also used for
the evaluation of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) (see
later).6,7
Under typical circumstances, only bacterial carbohydrate metabolism is
responsible for exhaled hydrogen.
In disaccharidase deficiency, carbohydrates are not metabolized in the
proximal small bowel lumen and travel to the distal small bowel/colon
where they are metabolized by colonized bacteria releasing hydrogen.
Exhaled hydrogen is measured after the patient is given 25 to 50 g of
oral lactose dissolved in water.
Hydrogen (H2) levels in end-expiratory breath samples are measured
every 15 minutes for up to 3 hours.
An increase of >20 ppm over basal values for two time points indicates
lactose malabsorption. A positive test usually peaks at 2 to 4 hours.
False negative results can occur in setting of colonic flora that do not
produce hydrogen, delayed gastric emptying, or prolonged orocecal
transit time. False-positive results can occur from oral flora substrate
fermentation and hydrogen production. Antibiotic use and fiber intake
can also alter the results.
An early hydrogen peak within 1 hour of ingestion of lactulose may
indicate SIBO.
The lactulose hydrogen breath test suffers from similar false positive and
false negative results as disaccharidase deficiency work up.
It is usually performed with an oral load of 10 g lactulose or glucose in a
dose of 50 to 75 g dissolved in water with subsequent hydrogen breath
level measurement as above.
Interpretation of these tests is not uniform; reported sensitivity and
specificity of the lactulose hydrogen breath test in detecting SIBO is 68%
and 44%, respectively, and for the glucose breath test 62% and 83%,
respectively.5
The gold standard remains aspiration of the small bowel contents and
subsequent culture. This is not used clinically for diagnosing SIBO.
Imaging

235

Traditional imaging for small bowel pathologic processes can be
performed with barium small-bowel follow-through examinations,
single- or double-contrast intubated enteroclysis, and computed
tomography (CT) cross-sectional imaging.
Capsule endoscopy, push endoscopy, and double-balloon
endoscopy are newer techniques that have been developed to examine
the small bowel in its entirety.
Cross-sectional imaging techniques provide good visualization of both
superimposed bowel loops and extraluminal findings and complications.
The emergence of CT and magnetic resonance (MR) enterography
has led to further improvements in the noninvasive evaluation of the
small bowel.
MR enterography advantages include the lack of ionizing radiation,
improved soft tissue contrast, and the ability to provide real-time and
functional evaluation.8
Such imaging will likely prove more useful in patients requiring routine
surveillance screening, for instance, those with familial adenomatous
polyposis or Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.
Cross-sectional imaging advances have been made with the
development of CT enterography.9
Advantages of this technique include superior temporal and spatial
resolution compared with MR, more widespread access, and less cost.
Indications for cross-sectional imaging of the small bowel continue to
evolve but include evaluation of obscure GI bleeding, the presence and
activity of Crohn’s disease, and suspected neoplasia.
Diagnostic Procedures
Endoscopic biopsy
Biopsy of the small intestine is extremely useful in patients with
suspected malabsorption.
Specific histologic findings allow diagnosis of the more common causes of
mal-absorption, such as celiac sprue, as well as more infrequent causes,
such as lymphoma and amyloidosis.

CELIAC SPRUE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
236

Celiac sprue is the most frequently evaluated etiology among the
malabsorptive small bowel disorders.
Increasingly sensitive and specific serologies and tissue diagnosis are
usually confirmatory.
Symptomatic resolution is achieved with avoidance of food products
containing gluten.
Definition

Permanent intolerance to the storage proteins or gluten found in wheat,
rye, and barley result in symptoms of malabsorption including weight
loss, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, and excessive flatus.10
Epidemiology

The prevalence of celiac disease in the United States is approximately
1%, with a range of 0.71% to 1.25%.
HLA antigen class II DQ molecules DQ2 and DQ8 are necessary but not
sufficient for phenotypic expression of the disease.
Pathophysiology

A consequence of complex adaptive and innate immune responses to
dietary gluten, it is characterized by chronic inflammation of the proximal
intestinal mucosa mediated primarily by T-cell immunologic processes.10
The adaptive immune response is mediated by gluten-reactive CD4 +T
cells, which are presented as gluten-derived peptides by HLA antigen
class II molecules.
Deamidation of these peptides by tissue transglutaminase allows higher
affinity binding to the binding groove of DQ2 or DQ8 when presenting
specific gluten antigens to T cells.
Subsequently, T cells release helper T-cell cytokines that precipitate
mucosal damage.
Additional innate immune responses are mediated and activated by
intraepithelial lymphocytes and act in concert via interleukin-15 produced
by enterocytes.
Risk Factors/Associated Conditions

237

High-risk populations include the following 10:
First-degree relatives of patients with celiac disease (prevalence 10%).
Patients with dermatitis herpetiformis (prevalence >90%).
Patients with unexplained iron-deficiency anemia (prevalence 2–5%).
Osteoporosis and bone demineralization (prevalence 1.5–3%).
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (prevalence 2–5% in adults and 3–8% in
children).
Patients with liver disease:
Elevated transaminase levels of unknown cause (prevalence 1.5–9.0%).
Autoimmune hepatitis(prevalence 2.9–6.4%).
Primary biliary cirrhosis(prevalence 0–6.0%).
Genetic disorders (prevalence in patients with Down syndrome ranges
from 3–12%).
Autoimmune thyroid disease(prevalence1.5–6.7%).
Reproductive disorders (prevalence in Turner’s syndrome can range from
2.1–4.1%).
Small intestinal lymphoma is also noted to have increasing
prevalence with celiac disease.
Five-year abstinence from gluten normalizes risk of lymphoma.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Intestinal symptoms predominate and include characteristic
malabsorption symptoms: weight loss, steatorrhea, fatigue, and
abdominal cramps.
Fatigue can also manifest secondary to iron deficiency anemia.
Infertility, short stature, osteoporosis, and additional manifestations of
malabsorption can also be present.
Dermatitis herpetiformis, a pruritic blistering rash on the extensor
surfaces, may be seen. Histopathology from the skin lesions, when
diagnostic, provides confirmation of celiac sprue.
Diagnostic Criteria

Current American Gastroenterology Association recommendations
238

suggest positive serologic tests coupled with mucosal biopsy suggestive
of celiac disease, supported by a positive symptomatic response to a
gluten-free diet to clinch the diagnosis. 10,11
Differential Diagnosis

In the absence of symptomatic relief with treatment/lifestyle modi
fications, additional etiologies of malabsorption must be considered:
Pancreaticexocrinein sufficiency
Hepatobiliary diseases
Disaccharidase deficiency
Intestinallymphoma
Refractorysprue
Characterized by severe villus atrophy associated with severe
malabsorption that either does not or no longer responds to a glutenfree diet.12
Possibility remains that some cases of refractory sprue are not
associated with gluten sensitivity.
Refractory sprue occurs most often in older patients and may be
associated with carriage of a double DQ2 allele.
Refractory sprue may be responsive to immunosuppression or
corticosteroids.
Alternative etiologies to consider include causes of enteropathy
(autoimmune enteropathy, common variable immunodeficiency
syndrome, tropical sprue, and eosinophilic gastroenteritis) resulting in
hypoalbuminemia and massive malnutrition.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Initially, it is important to evaluate for deficiencies in certain proximal
small intestinal nutrients consistent with malabsorption (decreased fatsoluble vitamins, iron, B12, folate, etc).
Serologic testing with either endomysial antibody (EMA IgA) or
tissue transglutaminase (tTG IgA) is appropriate as an initial
screening test in suspected cases of celiac disease. 10,11
Thereported sensitivity and specificity of EMA are close to 90% and
239

99%, respectively.
The reported sensitivity and specificity for tTG IGA are 90% and >95%,
respectively.
A correlation has been shown between the sensitivities of these
serologic tests and degree of histologic activity.
Antigliadin antibody testing is now rarely performed, but a newer
serologic test targeting antibodies against deamidated gliadin
peptide (DGP) provides much better diagnostic accuracy.
Sensitivity and specificity for DGP are 94% and 99%, respectively.13
DGP and tTG IGA in combination improve therapeutic gain of serologic
testing in celiac disease.
If initial serologic studies are negative, other causes of malabsorption
have been excluded, and suspicion for celiac disease remains, then
measurement of serum IgA levels is appropriate.
Prevalence of selective IgA deficiency in the celiac disease population is
1.7% to 3.0%, 10 to 15 times higher than in the general population.
In addition, if small bowel biopsy (see later) and serologic testing remain
non-diagnostic, analysis of the HLA-DQ2/DQ8 alleles may be helpful.
Either or both of these alleles are uniformly seen in almost all patients
with celiac disease; absence of these markers has a negative predictive
value close to 100%.
Diagnostic Procedures

As noted above, the gold standard for diagnosis, in addition to serologic
tests and dietary modification, consists of a proximal small bowel
biopsy confirming the diagnosis.
Histologic findings on biopsy include
atrophy/blunting of the small intestinal villi;
hyperplasia, deepening of crypts; and
infiltration of lamina propria and intraepithelial compartments with
chronic inflammatory cells, typically lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.

TREATMENT

Lifestyle/Risk Modifications

240

Gold standard of treatment involves lifelong adherence to a glutenfree diet.
This often proves difficult, as gluten is found in several types of food.
Typically, wheat, rye, and barley should be removed from the diet.
Knowledge about dietary compliance is crucial for avoiding inadvertent
ingestion of gluten and exacerbation of celiac symptoms.
Consultation with a dietitian is important and membership in a local
celiac society is often helpful.
Routine evaluations by physicians and dieticians are appropriate;
however, no specific serologic screening testing (i.e., tTG/EMA/DGP) or
time line for follow-up has been established.
Routine serologic testing is sensitive for major but not minor dietary
indiscretions and negative serologic test results do not necessarily mean
improvement beyond severe or total villous atrophy.11
In addition, it is important to ensure nutrient deficiency
supplementation (e.g., iron, folate).
Screening for concurrent osteoporosis with bone mineral density
scans should also be performed with prolonged disease course.

SMALL INTESTINAL BACTERIAL OVERGROWTH (SIBO)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Bacteria within the small bowel lumen generally consist of organisms
produced by oropharnygeal flora. Several disorders can lead to profound
bacterial overgrowth, causing a wide variety of malnutrition symptoms
and clinical abnormalities.
Definition

Usually defined as >105 colony-forming units/mL in the proximal small
bowel.
Abnormal, excessive proliferation of bacterial growth within the small
bowel intestinal lumen can lead to impaired nutrient digestion and
subsequent damage to the bowel mucosa, further hindering appropriate
241

digestion and absorption.
Epidemiology

SIBO is common in older adults and is often an under recognized etiology
of malabsorption.
In one series of adults older than 65 years who suffered from
malabsorption, SIBO was the most common cause (70.8%).14
Prevalence in the asymptomatic elderly population is high (14.5% to
38%), although the significance of this in the absence of symptoms is
unclear.
Etiology

SIBO can be caused by the following:
Intestinal stasis caused by
intestinal motility disorders such as diabetic gastroparesis,
hypothyroidism, postsurgical ileus, medication-induced (i.e., opiates),
and rheumatologic/ in filtrative conditions (i.e., scleroderma,
amyloidosis);
structural lesions in the setting of inflammatory disease (i.e., Crohn’s)
mediated bowel strictures, radiation enteritis, postsurgical adhesions,
and malignancy;
fistulous, abnormal connections between small and large
intestines, often seen postsurgically in bypass patients yielding
postsurgical blind bowel loops;
reduced gastric acid secretion and consequent decreased acid
barrier to ingested bacteria. This can sometimes be seen in setting of
excessive acid suppression, postvagotomy, impaired gastric acid
secretion postgastrectomy, or in setting of pernicious anemia;
immuno deficiency syndromes.
Pathophysiology

Direct bacterial overgrowth-mediated toxin production can damage
bowel lumen epithelium, impairing digestion and absorption.
Bacteria are also known to deconjugate bile salts, leading to earlier
reabsorption and impairment of fat-soluble nutrient absorption.
Bacteria are known to coat the bowel wall, bind certain nutrients
242

intended for absorption (i.e., vitamin B12), and reduce availability.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Presentation can be similar to other malabsorptive states, with findings
of abdominal distention, cramping, excessive flatus, significant vitamin
and carbohydrate malnutrition, and weight loss.
Patients often have medical histories predisposing them to states of
impaired intestinal motility, immuno deficiency, or reduced gastric acid
secretion.
Differential Diagnosis

Includes alternative etiologies of malabsorption including hepatobiliary
diseases, autoimmune-mediated processes, such as celiac disease,
refractory sprue, intestinal lymphoma, and infectious causes such as
tropical sprue or Whipple’s disease.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Typical malabsorptive vitamin (vitamins A, D, E, K, and B12 and folate)
and electrolyte (iron and calcium) deficiencies are noted.
Additional findings include macrocytic or microcytic anemia, elevated
prothrombin time and INR leading to bleeding diathesis.
Diagnostic Procedures

Gold standard for diagnosis remains microbiological culture of small
bowel aspirate.
Typical small bowel intraluminal bacteria concentrations are 104 colonyforming units per milliliter (CFU/mL), most of which are gram-positive
aerobes, derived from oropharyngeal flora.
Thus, findings of colonic-type bacterial count >105 are typically
diagnostic of SIBO.
243

Because of the time-consuming, expensive, and invasive nature of small
bowel aspirate culture, hydrogen breath tests using glucose or lactulose
have become the method of choice.

TREATMENT
Focus is twofold:
Eradication of the abnormal proliferating intraluminal bacteria.
Reversal of predisposing risk factors that precipitate SIBO.
Medications

Antibiotics are typically used to treat enteric gut flora.
Quinolones or amoxicillin in combination with clavulanic acid or
metro-nidazole is routinely used.
Rifaximin is increasingly used in the treatment of SIBO. This agent also
has value in the management of hepatic encephalopathy.
Repeat courses of antibiotics are often required, with probiotic use
possibly allowing maintenance of bacterial growth after initial antibiotic
therapy, although remission is not induced with probiotics alone.
Agents to augment altered intestinal motility (e.g.,
metoclopramide, erythromycin) can be considered, but these agents are
not uniformly beneficial, and long-term use can be associated with
significant adverse effects.
In the setting of systemic disorders associated with altered intestinal
motility, attention should be focused on treating the underlying
disease etiology (i.e., diabetic control, thyroid supplementation in
setting of hypothyroidism, immunosuppressive agents in scleroderma,
etc).
Surgical Management

Reversal of structural abnormalities that can predispose intestinal stasis
should be pursued.
Elimination of postsurgical or inflammatory disease-mediated adhesions
or strictures either endoscopically or surgically.
Correction of postsurgical blind loops may prevent recurrence of bacterial
overgrowth in those bowel segments.
244

SHORT BOWEL SYNDROME (SBS)

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The small bowel has significant capability to tolerate resection of large
segments and yet retain adequate absorptive capabilities (up to 25% to
30% can be resected).
Definition

Resection of large segments of small bowel (usually resulting in 200 cm
of small intestine) can culminate in symptoms and presentation ranging
from mild nutritional deficiencies to debilitating diarrhea and
malnutrition.
Etiology

In infants, congenital SBS can occur as a consequence of intestinal
atresia and other congenital intestinal anomalies. 15,16
More often, SBS is an acquired condition resulting from multiple
resections for refractory complications from Crohn’s disease, catastrophic
vascular events, trauma, intestinal adhesions, and extensive
aganglionosis.
Pathophysiology

Resection of small intestine can reduce the surface area for nutrient
absorption.
If the resected segment length is not significant, patients remain
asymptomatic and do not suffer from consequences of SBS.
Postsurgically, the length of remaining small bowel and continuity with
the colon determines disease severity.
Nutritional risk remains greatest for those with 15
duodenostomy or jejunoileal anastomosis, with resulting 35 cm of
residual small bowel;
jejunocolic or ileocolic anastomosis, with 60 cm of residual small bowel;
245

end jejunostomy, with 115 cm of residual small bowel; and
resection of the ileocolic valve.
Intestinal adaptive response to resection involves an increase in
absorptive surface area that results from crypt cell hyperplasia and
increase in villus height.15
Commonly, the ileum may account for the adaptive processes lost from
jejunal resection and assume, to some extent, the role of absorbing
folate, iron, and calcium.
Ileal resection, however, cannot be compensated by jejunal hypertrophy
and a resultant loss in vitamin B 12, bile salts, and fat-soluble vitamin
resorption occurs.
Consequently, nutrient malabsorption depends on location and extent of
small bowel resection.
Altered intestinal motility often develops postsurgically (e.g., ileocecal
valve resection) predisposing to bacterial colonization and resulting in
SIBO.
Postresection, there are alterations in the release of distal ileum and
colonic hormones (glucagon-like peptide-1, neurotensin) stimulated by
fat or bile salts.
Rapid gastric emptying may be precipitated from this process causing
significant volume losses.
In the setting of ileal compromise, further diarrhea can be precipitated by
bile acid–mediated irritation of the bowel lumen.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Symptoms in patients having had recent surgical resection vary from
malabsorption, weight loss, and increased frequency of bowel
movements, especially postprandially, to significant malnutrition, profuse
diarrhea, and dehydration.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis in these patients is relatively simple and often requires a
246

history of prior surgical intervention, routinely for the above etiologies.
Laboratories

Malabsorption (carbohydrate, vitamin, nutrient deficiencies) can be
significant in these patients.
In addition, significant electrolyte abnormalities, renal insufficiency, and
varying degrees of acid/base disturbances result from the profound
diarrhea and dehydration that occur in SBS.

TREATMENT
Treatment is primarily supportive. 15 Principles of management include
the following:
Appropriate hydration and volume resuscitation.
Adequate nutrition and supplementation with mineral and vitamins.
Often, supplemental enteral feeding (via nasogastric/orogastric tubes) is
required on a short-term basis before possible transition to total
parenteral nutrition.
To ensure adequate time for absorption, agents such as
diphenoxylate–atropine or loperamide can be used to slow
intestinal motility.
If the suspicion of concurrent SIBO is high, antibiotics such as
quinolones, metronidazole, or rifaximin can be used.
For possible bile acid–mediated diarrhea, bile acid–binding agents
such as cholestyramine may provide additional relief.
Growth factor administration is sometimes recommended in patients
with refractory SBS who receive minimal symptom control with
conservative, supportive management.
Growth factors, including somatotropin, glutamine, and glucagon-like
peptide 2 (GLP-2), are theorized to increase mucosal adaptation and
consequent dietary absorption in post–bowel resection states.
Studies detailing use of these agents in various combinations have had
conflicting results; consequently, no consensus exists regarding their use,
which remains a controversial treatment modality. 17

SMALL BOWEL NEOPLASMS
247

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The small bowel comprises 75% of the length of the entire GI tract and
90% of the mucosal surface. However, 2% of GI malignancies originate
in the small bowel.
Age-adjusted incidence of small bowel malignancies is 1 per 100,000 and
the prevalence is 0.6%.
Classification

Benign tumors consist of the following:
Leiomyomas, which are the most frequent symptomatic benign tumors
of the small bowel. These occur most commonly in the sixth or seventh
decade of life.
Other benign tumors include adenomas, lipomas, and hamartomas.
Several malignant tumors can occur in the small bowel.
Adenocarcinomas account for 30% to 50% of malignant tumors. 18
Annual incidence is 3.9 cases per million, with a slight male
predominance, most commonly presenting in the sixth or seventh
decade.
Carcinoids account for 25% to 30% of malignant tumors.
Lymphomas account for 15% to 20% of malignant tumors.
Depending on the series, non–Hodgkins lymphoma accounts for 18% to
24%.
Risk Factors

Certain hereditary conditions predispose individuals to small intestinal
tumors.
Peutz-Jeghers syndrome is known to cause hamartomatous polyps
primarily in the jejunum and ileum.
Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) can be associated with small
bowel adenomas, often progressing to adenocarcinoma.
Malignant conversion of proximal gut polyposis after prophylactic
colectomy has increased in FAP patients over their lifetime, varying from
4% to 10%. 19 This may reflect an increase in survival of FAP patients.
248

Inflammatory conditions such as Crohn’s disease and celiac sprue
may also predispose patients to adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the
small bowel. There is a 20- to 40-fold increase in risk of small bowel
adenocarcinoma with Crohn’s disease compared with the general
population. 20

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Small bowel tumors can cause intermittent abdominal pain, anemia,
bleeding (either overt or occult, manifesting in the setting of chronic
anemia), or structural abnormalities resulting in obstruction.
Presentation can be insidious and nonspecific. In one large series, mean
time to diagnosis was 7 months.
Symptomatic presentation is more likely to be seen with
malignant tumors, whereas benign tumors are often discovered
incidentally, often at surgery for small bowel obstruction.
Leiomyomas are highly vascular tumors that can present with bleeding
(65%), often from the duodenum, or with obstruction or intussusception
(25%).
Adenomas and adenocarcinomas, specifically those located in the
duodenum with periampullary involvement, can present with signs of
obstructive jaundice when the distal common bile duct is involved.
Typically, manifestations are nonspecific and occur late in the disease
course.
Lymphoma often presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, abdominal
mass, perforation, or obstruction.
Differential Diagnosis

Small bowel tumors are often appreciated incidentally in the setting of
unremitting abdominal pain, unexplained anemia, lower GI bleeding, and
small bowel obstruction.
Alternative etiologies for all these presenting symptoms must be
considered prior to endoscopic or invasive diagnostic testing. This can
include inflammatory strictures, adhesions as a cause for small bowel
249

obstruction, and other common causes for GI bleeding (see Chapters 6
and 7).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Patients can present with laboratory abnormalities consistent with
malabsorption (see earlier) from luminal obstruction and consequent
impaired nutrient absorption.
Unexplained anemia can be seen if occult bleeding is a chronic
manifestation.
Genetic testing may be performed in the setting of inherited cancer
syndromes. For instance, mutations of the APC gene suggest FAP and
SMAD4 mutations suggest juvenile polyposis syndrome.
Imaging

Luminal irregularities consistent with intestinal tumors can be seen in
barium contrast studies, specifically with small bowel follow-through
series, contrast enteroclysis, or CT/MR enterography.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopic diagnosis with histopathologic confirmation remains
the ideal confirmatory test prior to surgical resection, when possible.
Leiomyomas are most frequently found in the jejunum, followed by the
ileum and the duodenum.
Endoscopically, they appear as single, firm, grayish-white, well-defined
masses with central umbilication and ulceration, often covered with
normal epithelium.
Adenomas can be diffusely found through the small bowel, primarily in
the duodenum.
Large size or findings of prominent villus component or atypia increase
the risk for malignancy.
Adenocarcinomas are most routinely found in the proximal small
bowel, with the duodenum, and more specifically, the periampullary
region being the most common location.
Lymphomas can be diagnosed with endoscopic visualization and
biopsy, but often exploratory laparotomy is required for diagnosis.
250

TREATMENT
Endoscopic or surgical excision is indicated whenever possible for all
tumors, particularly benign and localized small bowel tumors.
Radiation or chemotherapy may be necessary in malignant tumors with
more widespread extraluminal involvement.
Surgical/Endoscopic Management

Adenomas should be removed or ablated as first-line treatment
endoscopically if possible.
Tumor locations dictate the method of resection. For example, duodenal
polyps may be amenable to endoscopic resection, whereas periampullary
tumors may require a combination of endoscopic and surgical
management due to an increased risk of malignant transformation.
Adenocarcinomas require surgery as it provides the only potential for
cure.
Specifically, pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple procedure) is often
required for tumors of the first or second part of the duodenum.
Other Therapies

In the setting of inadequate surgical resection or increased small bowel
adeno-carcinoma disease burden, chemotherapy and radiation
therapy may be indicated. However, these modalities have not been
shown to improve survival in advanced disease.
Lymphomas often require an aggressive combination of surgical
management, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy since they frequently
present with advanced disease.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
When incidental adenomas are found on endoscopy, routine endoscopic
surveillance is recommended to ensure complete ablation and to monitor
for recurrence. Surveillance intervals vary and can range from 1 to 3
years.
More aggressive surveillance is indicated in the setting of adenocarcinoma
251

or lymphoma after curative management.
Genetically predisposed individuals such as those with FAP should receive
routine screening for polyposis and malignant transformation. No clear
recommendations exist, but yearly endoscopy may be indicated.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Small bowel adenocarcinoma prognosis remains dismal despite
aggressive management, with an overall 5-year survival rate as low as
30%.
Prognosis for adenomas, however, is excellent for those who lack
malignant change or in which malignancy is confined to superficial layers
on biopsy.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Background

More than 142,000 new cases and 51,000 deaths are attributed to
colorectal cancer (CRC) in the United States each year. 1 CRC is the
second leading cause of cancer death. However, mortality is
progressively declining since 1990 at a rate of 3% per year.
Prognosis is closely linked to stage at diagnosis. The 5-year survival rate
for localized cancers is >90%, whereas the 5-year survival rate for those
with invasive cancer is 10%.
Nearly all CRC develops from colorectal adenomas, with a progression
that occurs over 5 to 15 years.
Screening colonoscopy and polypectomy have been shown to reduce
mortality from CRC.2 The high survival rate of patients with localized CRC
and the ability to detect and resect precursor polyps make screening a
vital tool in the treatment and prevention of CRC.
Epidemiology

The prevalence of adenomatous polyps in asymptomatic patients varies
from 23% to 41%.
The lifetime incidence of CRC is roughly 5% for average risk individuals,
with 90% of cases occurring after age 50 years.
Different ethnic populations carry varying risks for developing colorectal
adenomas and cancer. For example, Hawaiian-Japanese have a
254

prevalence of adenoma as high as 50% to 60%; in contrast, Japanese
living in Japan have prevalence rates of 12%. This disparity suggests
that lifestyle and environmental influences are additional risk factors in
the development of CRC.
Developing countries have lower rates of CRC than North America,
Australia, and Europe. This may be due to diets high in red meat and fat
and low in fruits, vegetables, and fiber in developed countries.
Distribution of polyps is fairly uniform throughout the colon. In patients
older than 60 years and in women, adenomas tend to be more common
in the proximal colon. In recent years, a gradual shift has occurred to
greater incidence of proximal (ascending colon and cecal) CRC.
Etiology

Adenomatous polyps are believed to develop in a stepwise fashion as a
result of a series of genetic mutations. These arise in colonic crypts
wherein the proliferative component of the crypt, usually confined to the
base, extends through the entire crypt.3
Histologically, the tubular adenoma is the most common subgroup,
representing 80% to 86% of all adenomatous polyps. These lesions tend
to be small and exhibit only mild dysplasia, seen microscopically as a
complex network of branching adenomatous glands.
Villous adenomas tend to have a higher degree of dysplasia, with
adenomatous glands extending through to the center of the polyps,
thereby appearing grossly as fingerlike projections.
Villous (papillary) and tubulovillous adenomas are three times more
likely to become malignant than tubular adenomas.
Traditional serrated adenomas and sessile serated adenomas share
some histologic features with hyperplastic polyps. These lesions,
however, are associated with CRC risk similar to classic adenomas.
Sessile serated adenomas are more common in the proximal colon, and
traditional serrated adenomas are more common in the rectosigmoid
colon.
Overall, only a small percentage of colon polyps develop into carcinomas.
Pathophysiology

CRC develops from colorectal adenomas in nearly all instances, the
exception being CRC that develops in patients with idiopathic
255

inflammatory bowel disease manifesting as colitis.
Several studies including the National Polyp Study found that removal of
adenomas resulted in a significantly lower incidence of CRC. In confirmed
colon cancers, residual adenomatous tissue can be found within
cancerous tissue. Additionally, surgically resected CRC may contain
adjacent adenomatous polyps in one-third of cases.
The progression from adenoma to carcinoma occurs as a result of a
series of DNA mutations. However, the exact sequence of mutations
necessary for malignant progression is unclear.
Among the earliest mutations is inactivation of the adenomatous
polyposis coli (APC) gene.4
Other later changes include mutations of the K-ras proto-oncogene, DNA
hypomethylation, 18q inactivation, and p53 (tumor suppressor gene)
inactivation.4
The accumulation of abnormalities results in a stepwise progression over
~10 years from normal mucosa to adenoma to carcinoma.
Detection of these mutations from sloughed cells in stool samples as a
useful screening test for early CRC detection is currently under
investigation.
Risk Factors

Several factors predict the risk of developing colorectal adenomas and
cancer.
Older age is the most important risk factor and is associated not only
with a higher prevalence of polyps but also with multiple polyps, severe
dysplasia, and larger adenoma size.
African Americans have an increased risk of developing colon cancer
than other races.5
Personal history of CRC or adenomatous polyps confers additional
risk.
Inflammatory intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s
disease, can increase the risk of developing colon cancer.
Several genetic syndromes, most notably familial adenomatous
polyposis and hereditary nonpolyposis CRC (Lynch syndrome),
substantially increase the risk of developing colon cancer (see Table 151).

256

Family history of colon cancer
The overall colon cancer risk in those with multiple first-degree relatives
or a single first-degree relative with a diagnosis before age 45 years is
three to four times that of the general population.
In patients with a single first-degree relative with CRC or adenoma
diagnosed before age 60 years, risk of developing CRC increases two
times that of the general population.
Tobacco and alcohol use may increase the risk of developing colon
cancer.
Other medical conditions, including diabetes mellitus, obesity,
acromegaly, ureterocolic anastomoses, and pelvic radiation, have also
been associated with an increased risk of developing CRC.
Prevention

For screening purposes, individuals are stratified into average or high
risk.6
Average risk individuals are those with no family or personal history of
CRC or adenoma and no history of ulcerative colitis.
High-risk populations include those with prior CRC or adenoma, family
history of CRC, family history of adenoma before age 60, and ulcerative
257

colitis.7
Current recommendations do not take into account race, gender, dietary,
or environmental risks modifiers.
Screening for CRC should begin at age 50 years for average risk
individuals.
Individuals deemed to be at high risk should be screened starting at age
40, or 10 years earlier than the age of the youngest CRC diagnosis in the
family, whichever is earlier.
CRC screening is unique in that national organizations provide a “menu”
of screening options from which to choose, and they generally do not
endorse one screening test over another.
Options for screening include fecal immunochemical testing (FIT), fecal
occult blood testing (FOBT), flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS), double contrast
barium enema (DCBE), and colonoscopy.
These tests used alone and in combination reduce CRC incidence and
mortality.
Multiple studies have shown extremely low population screening rates,
generally 50%. Extensive public education of the community has
modestly increased screening rates over the past few years.
Fecal Occult Blood Testing and Fecal Immunochemical Testing

FIT and FOBT are relatively sensitive, but nonspecific, and are associated
with minimal initial cost.8
As a screening test, FOBT or FIT should be performed yearly.
Two samples from each of three consecutive stool samples should be
evaluated during FOBT.
A restricted diet and avoidance of red meat for 3 days before testing are
recommended.
Two samples from two consecutive stools should be used for FIT.
There is no need to rehydrate the slide because this increases the falsepositive rate.
Abnormal FIT and FOBT should be further evaluated with a colonoscopy.
A study in the United States showed that only 30% of individuals with a
positive test underwent follow-up colonoscopy.
Flexible Sigmoidoscopy

FS is very low risk and of moderate cost, but it only examines
258

approximately one-fourth of the colon.
Sigmoidoscopy should be offered every 5 years when used as a screening
test.
Case-controlled studies have shown a reduced mortality rate for CRC in
individuals who undergo FS; however, there is no reduction in CRC risk in
the uninspected proximal colon.
Patients having FS should have a diagnostic colonoscopy if an adenoma
is identified because distal adenomas (within reach of FS) are associated
with high rates of more proximal adenomas.
Up to one-half of individuals with a proximal adenoma have no distal
adenoma, raising concern about the use of FS as a screening modality.
Colonoscopy

Colonoscopy is the most sensitive and specific test, but it involves the
greatest cost and carries a small risk of complications.9
Colonoscopy as a screening method should be offered every 10 years.
It is the “preferred” screening test according to the American College of
Gastroenterology.
Studies evaluating the use of screening colonoscopy in average risk
individuals are lacking. By extrapolating from the FS studies, however, it
is safe to say that colonoscopy is at least as good as FS at reducing the
incidence or mortality from CRC.10
Colonoscopy allows examination of the entire colon, despite higher risks
and cost.10
Detection rates of adenomas appear to be directly related to longer
times for scope withdrawal.11
Double Contrast Barium Enema

DCBE can be offered every 5 years.
No randomized trials have shown a reduction in CRC mortality with DCBE
screening.
DCBE has a lower sensitivity than colonoscopy; it must be combined with
FS to offer complete colonoscopic evaluation and is generally not utilized
as a CRC screening tool.
A positive result requires follow-up with colonoscopy.
Computed Tomography Colonography

259

Computed tomography colonography (CTC) is still under investigation as
a screening tool.12
It is anticipated that screening will be recommended every 5 years.
CTC requires oral contrast as well as colonic catharsis. A small-caliber,
flexible rectal catheter is used for colonic distension, generally with CO2.
The colonic preparation does allow for same-day colonoscopy if colon
polyps are found.
Patients with large polyps (>10 mm) or multiple moderate size polyps
(>6 mm) are referred for colonoscopy.
Colonoscopy is recommended for patients with one to two polyps
between 6 and 9 mm, although some advocate enrolling those patients
in a CTC surveillance program every 1 to 2 years.
Polyps 5 mm are not reported.
Many factors limit CTC use for screening at this time, including lower
sensitivity of detecting small polyps, cost-effectiveness, bowel
preparation, risks of cumulative radiation exposure, and questions
regarding management of the small polyps seen on CTC.
Intense debate rages about the wisdom of CTC surveillance for polyps 6
to 9 mm, because polyps of this size carry a small but real risk of
advanced neoplasia.
Additionally, the issue of extracolonic findings on CTC adds to the
complexity and cost of the procedure.
Fecal DNA Testing

Recent tests have been able to detect DNA shed in the stool by CRC.
Since all genetic abnormalities associated with CRC are not included in
the stool DNA test, false-negative results occur.
Studies have shown fecal DNA testing to be more sensitive than guaiac
tests for cancer and advanced neoplasms.13
To perform the test, a full bowel movement sample must be collected
from the patients and shipped with an ice pack.
Currently, screening with fecal DNA testing is performed every 5 years,
but no standardized interval has been established.
Hypermethylation of genes associated with CRC has led to investigation
of new assays, which would detect aberrant methylation in stool as a
marker for cancer.14

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Most patients with colonic polyps are asymptomatic but may occasionally
present with occult or overt bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.
Villous adenomas >3 cm can cause a secretory diarrhea, which can lead
to volume depletion and electrolyte abnormalities.
Many adenocarcinomas are asymptomatic but may occasionally present
with multiple symptoms, including abdominal pain (44%), change in
bowel habit (43%), hematochezia or melena (40%), weakness (20%),
anemia without other gastrointestinal symptoms (11%), or weight loss
(6%).15,16
Symptoms can be helpful in determining the location and extent of
disease.
Right-sided cancers may grow and become large before producing
symptoms because of the larger luminal caliber of the cecum and
ascending colon. Iron-deficiency anemia is often the only manifestation
of right-sided cancer.
Tumors in the left side of the colon may present with symptoms of
partial or complete obstruction, including abdominal distention, bloating,
and constipation.
Rectal or sigmoid cancers often cause hematochezia, constipation, or
thinning of the stools. Tenesmus, melena, or weight loss may also be
symptoms.
An infection with Streptococcus bovis or Clostridium septicum also
warrants evaluation of the colon because 10% to 25% of these
individuals have CRC.17
Consequently, new onset of hematochezia, anemia, or change in bowel
habits, especially in older patients, mandates colonoscopic evaluation.
Physical Examination

Examination of the patients should focus on confirming information
obtained in the history.
261

An abdomen examination should be performed to evaluate for
abdominal pain, distension, mass, and bowel sounds.
Signs of iron-deficiency anemia would present typically as pale
conjunctiva, skin, or nail beds.
Roughly 20% of patients have distant metastatic disease at
presentation, with the most common sites being regional lymph nodes,
liver, lungs, and peritoneum.18
Thus, right abdominal pain, abdominal distension, supraclavicular
adenopathy, or periumbilical nodules would signify advance disease.
Differential Diagnosis

Not all colorectal polyps have malignant potential, but visual inspection
cannot predict polyp histology; accordingly, all visualized polyps should
be removed and evaluated by surgical pathology.
Hyperplastic polyps consist of hyperplastic mucosal proliferation and are
considered to have no malignant potential.
Approximately one-third of colon polyps are hyperplastic.
A subset of large hyperplastic polyps may be premalignant and are felt
to progress to carcinoma through the pathway of serrated adenomas.
Juvenile polyps (also known as hamartomas) are tumors of the mucosa;
in contrast, hyperplastic and adenomatous polyps result from epithelial
proliferation.
Other polypoid lesions in the colon can include lymphoma, carcinoid,
Kaposi’s sarcoma, or metastatic disease.
Symptoms of CRC are nonspecific and other colonic diseases, including
diverticulosis and inflammatory bowel disease, can present with similar
symptoms of abdominal pain, hematochezia, and change in bowel
habits.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnostic colonoscopy is the test of choice for identifying CRC and
adenomas.
Barium enema and CTC can suggest CRC or adenoma, but only
colonoscopy allows for tissue sampling of tumors and removal of
adenomatous polyps.

TREATMENT
262

Most polyps found with flexible sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can be
resected completely, using electrocautery techniques.
Current guidelines for treatment of adenomatous polyps include
complete resection by colonoscopy or surgery, when necessary.2
Staging

Once CRC is diagnosed, further workup, including a chest radiograph, CT
of the abdomen and pelvis, complete blood cell count, chemistry panel,
and carcinoembryonic antigen level, is required to determine the extent
of local and distant extent of the disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging of the liver can also be used to identify
hepatic metastatic lesions.
Endoscopic ultrasound is also an available technique to evaluate the
invasion and nodal status in rectal cancer.
Previously, CRC was staged with the Dukes system (modified Astler
Coller). Now, staging of cancers is done using the TNM (tumor, node,
metastasis) universal system (Table 15-2), which was recently updated.

263

Surgical Management

For patients diagnosed with CRC, the treatment of choice is surgical
resection.
The goal of surgery is removal of the affected segment of bowel as well
as surrounding lymph nodes, with the extent of resection determined by
the distribution of blood vessels and lymphatic drainage.
For patients with rectal cancers, surgical treatment depends on the
location, size, and extent of involvement.
264

Therapies include low anterior resection for upper rectal cancers. Lowlying and locally advanced rectal cancers are treated with neoadjuvant
chemoradiotherapy, followed by low anterior resection.
Abdominoperineal resection is rarely performed in the current era.
In patients with CRC, synchronous polyps can occur in 20% to 40% of
cases and synchronous cancers in 3% to 5%; thus, preoperative
colonoscopy is recommended in patients before undergoing resection.
If the tumor is obstructing and cannot be traversed by the colonoscope,
barium enema may be performed to evaluate the proximal colon.
Patients with obstructing metastatic cancers can have palliative resection
or endoscopic stenting to prevent complete obstruction.
Chemotherapy

Prospective studies show prolonged survival and enhanced quality of life
for patients with metastatic disease who receive chemotherapy.
Adjuvant chemotherapy usually uses 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin or
capecitabine (Xeloda), which is an oral fluoropyrimidine.19
Adjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to have a survival benefit and
increases the probability of remaining tumor free in patients with stage
III disease.
Adjuvant therapy in patients with stage II disease is controversial
because 5-year survival rate is 80% with or without treatment.
It is thought that a subgroup of these patients with high-risk prognostic
factors (adherence of tumor to an adjacent organ or bowel perforation)
may benefit from chemotherapy.
Irinotecan and oxaliplatin are used in combination with fluoropyrimidines
for the treatment of metastatic disease.19
Targeted therapies are being developed and applied for CRC, which
include cetuximab (Erbitux) and bevacizumab (Avastin).
Lifestyle/Risk Modifications

Intense interest surrounds the issue of prevention and risk reduction with
lifestyle modification and supplementation.
Currently, calcium and aspirin have been demonstrated to reduce
colorectal neoplasia risk in randomized controlled trials.20
Hormone replacement therapy and estrogen, statins, nonsteroidal anti265

inflammatory drugs, magnesium, vitamin B6, folic acid, and physical
activity have all been thought to be protective against CRC, but data are
inconclusive.20
Folic acid was evaluated in a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled trial for secondary prevention of adenoma with negative
results. The timing of folate administration appears to be important,
because folate may act as a preventive agent if given before
preneoplastic lesions arise, but it may increase tumor development if
given after a preneoplastic lesion exists.21
FOLLOW-UP

The recommended interval for repeat surveillance colonoscopy depends
on the findings on the initial examination.
Table 15-3 lists the surveillance recommendations for patients with
colorectal adenomas.22
Surveillance intervals after polypectomy should be based on the number,
size, and histology of polyps.
Screening intervals for individuals at high risk because of family history is
generally every 5 years, unless an inherited syndrome is suspected or
confirmed.

266

Individuals with hyperplastic polyps are not at increased risk for
development of CRC, and colonoscopy every 10 years is sufficient. The
exceptions are individuals felt to have hyperplastic polyposis syndrome,
wherein many or large hyperplastic polyps are present. These individuals
should be screened similarly to individuals with adenomas.
Surveillance after resection of CRC is generally at 1 year, followed by 3
years, and then every 5 years if no subsequent adenomas or tumors are
found.
Surveillance intervals should be modified if subsequent adenomas or
cancers are found, if a family history of CRC is present, or if a hereditary
cancer syndrome is suspected.
Genetic counseling is recommended for any individual in whom a
hereditary cancer syndrome is suspected. Features of hereditary cancer
syndromes are outlined in the Special Considerations section.

PROGNOSIS
267

At diagnosis, symptomatic patients have a worse prognosis than
asymptomatic patients, with a 5-year survival rate of 49% versus 71%,
respectively.23
CRC survival is excellent for those with limited stage disease at the time
of diagnosis (Table 15-2).24
The development in the past decade of new chemotherapeutic agents
has led to a significant increase in treatment options for CRC and
improved survival.
Survival of patients with advanced CRC has increased from a median
survival of 10 to 12 months with fluoropyrimidines only to >20 months
with combination therapy (fluropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin or
cytotoxic chemotherapy with targeted therapy).

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Hereditary Syndromes with CRC Risk

A number of hereditary syndromes are associated with increased CRC
risk and are summarized in Table 15-1. These syndromes are addressed
in more detail in Chapter 24. Management of patients with these
syndromes should be multidisciplinary, including genetic counselors,
gastroenterologists, and colorectal surgeons.25
Inflammatory Bowel Disease

Surveillance colonoscopy is effective in reducing the mortality from CRC
for patients with Crohn’s colitis or ulcerative colitis.
Risk of dysplasia is associated with duration, extent, and activity of
disease; current recommendations are to perform surveillance
colonoscopy every 1 to 3 years on patients with pancolitis for >8 years
or left-sided colitis for >15 years.
Patients should have random biopsies taken every 10 cm throughout the
entire colon.
Patients with ulcerative colitis may have inflammatory polyps as well as
adenomas.
Sporadic adenomas that are not associated with active inflammation can
268

be managed similarly to polyps in patients without ulcerative colitis.
Adenomas or flat lesions with dysplasia found in the setting of active
inflammation should be managed by proctocolectomy.
The finding of high-grade dysplasia mandates colectomy, whereas lowgrade dysplasia is more controversial, with many experts also
recommending colectomy.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
In 1932, Burrill Crohn, Leon Ginzburg, and Gordon Oppenheimer first
described inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as an idiopathic disorder,
which they designated terminal ileitis. Later descriptions included
regional enteritis and granulomatous colitis before the eventual eponym
of Crohn’s disease was adopted.
Understanding of IBD genetics and molecular pathophysiology continues
to evolve and will likely be translated into targeted and patient-centered
clinical management strategies.
Definition

IBD is a spectrum of chronic intestinal inflammation of uncertain etiology.
Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) comprise the two
main clinical entities and are often discussed together for ease of
comparison and contrast. It is possible that CD and UC constitute a
continuum of disease and manifest as varying clinical phenotypes.
Microscopic colitis is also included under the umbrella of IBD.
Epidemiology

IBD is more common in well-developed areas and is particularly
prevalent in Caucasian Northern Europeans and North Americans. In
North America, the prevalence of IBD is 26 to 199/100,000 for CD and 27
to 246/100,000 for UC. It is rare in Asia and South America, but observed
prevalence appears to be on the rise.
271

In the United States, prevalence is highest in the Jewish population,
particularly in Ashkenazi Jews, followed by non-Jewish Caucasians,
African Americans, Hispanics, and Asians. Prevalence is higher in urban
areas and higher socioeconomic classes.
Peak incidence occurs between ages 15 and 30 years, with a second
minor peak between ages of 50 and 80 years. There is no gender
specificity.
Etiology

The precise etiology of IBD has not yet been defined. Genetic,
autoimmune, and environmental factors are implicated in disease
development and progression.
A leading hypothesis suggests that IBD is the result of an overly
aggressive immune response to a subset of commensal enteric bacteria
in a genetically susceptible host in the presence of environmental
triggers.
Pathophysiology

Although most affected patients have no family history of IBD, firstdegree relatives are five times more likely to develop the disease. Twin
studies show higher concordance rates of IBD, greater in CD than in UC.
Both UC and CD can occur in the same family, an observation now
supported by the identification of susceptibility genes associated with
both conditions.
Molecular characteristics of IBD.1,2
Multicenter and multinational genome wide association studies (GWAS)
have identified > 100 genes associated with IBD. Despite low relative
risk for polymorphisms in most of these genes, important pathways in
disease development are linked to these polymorphisms, including
autophagy and defects in handling of host–microbe interactions
by the innate and adaptive immunoregulation.
The initial events in IBD development are linked to aberrancies of
innate immunity, whereas the chronic state has an overactive
adaptive immune response to commensal luminal microbiota.
CD is associated with elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) α,
inter-feron γ, IL-1β, and the cytokines of the IL23-TH17 pathway.
Elevated levels of TNF- α, IL-17, and cytokines of the Th-2 cells are
272

found in UC. Several of these cytokines and pathways are targets for
new or investigational therapeutics.
The gene encoding NOD2 (an intracellular sensor of bacterial
peptidoglycan important in innate immunity) is associated with CD.
NOD2 polymorphisms are more common in Europeans than in African
Americans or Asians. NOD2 polymorphism carrier status is linked to ileal
and fibrostenosing disease phenotype. In heterozygous individuals, the
risk of CD is increased up to fourfold, whereas individuals with two allelic
variants have an 11- to 27-fold increase of relative risk.
Autophagy is a process by which cells degrade and control or clear
intracellular pathogens and organelles. Genes directly (ATG16L1 and
IRGM) or indirectly (NOD2) involved in autophagy are associated with
CD.
Colitis is a nonspecific manifestation that can result from alterations in
many genes involved in the mucosal barrier epithelium or mucosal
immune system, backing up the polygenic hypothesis.
Several lines of evidence support the importance of gene–environment
interactions in disease development and activity. Bacteria and now
viruses have been implicated as important luminal factors. Genetically
susceptible mice raised in sterile conditions do not develop IBD.
Antibiotics have therapeutic efficacy in some forms of IBD. In CD,
surgical diversion attenuates inflammation in the gastrointestinal (GI)
tract distal to the ostomy.
So far, it is estimated that only 20% of genetic variability associated with
IBD susceptibility has been identified. Multiple genes have been
associated with both CD and UC, supporting the overlap between them.
This novel information can lead to new directly targeted therapies for
IBD.
Pathologic Features

Crohn’s disease
CD can affect any portion of the luminal GI tract, from mouth to anus.
CD is characterized by chronic, progressive, potentially transmural
inflammation with mucosal damage and fissuring that can lead to
fibrosis, strictures, fistulae, and obstruction. Early disease is
characterized by inflammatory activity, whereas fibrosis and structuring
are more common with long-standing disease.
273

There is a sharp demarcation, both macro- and microscopically, between
diseased and adjacent unaffected bowel with asymmetric and
discontinuous inflammatory changes.

Noncaseating granulomas can be seen on histopathology.
Roughly 80% of patients have small bowel involvement, a third with
exclusively ileitis (usually with terminal ileum involvement), and one-half
with ileocolitis. Approximately 20% of patients have disease limited to
the colon, and about one-half of these patients have rectal sparing.
About 7% of patients have predominant oral or gastroduodenal
involvement, and even fewer patients (5%) have esophageal or proximal
small bowel involvement. This can be concurrent with the ileocolonic
involvement. These patients are typically younger at disease onset.
About a third of patients have perianal disease, including fistula and
fissures.
Extraintestinal manifestations are common, often related to
inflammatory disease activity, and are more frequent with colonic
involvement.
274

The Montreal classification of CD uses age at diagnosis, location, and
behavior to characterize the disease. This is particularly useful for CD
due to its variable phenotypes. See Table 16-1.3
Ulcerative colitis
UC is a chronic, relapsing, ulceroinflammatory disease limited to the
colon extending proximally from the rectum.
UC is a systemic disorder with frequent extraintestinal manifestations,
including hepatic involvement as primary sclerosing cholangitis.
Lesions affect predominantly the mucosa and submucosa in a
circumferential and uninterrupted distribution.
Well-formed granulomas and fistulae are absent in UC. Islands of
regenerating mucosa protrude into the lumen to create pseudopolyps.
The extent of disease is the basis for the most recent Montreal
classification of UC. See Table 16-1.3
Risk Factors

Patients who have first-degree relatives with IBD have an increased
risk of having IBD themselves (see Pathophysiology).
Smoking
Current smokers’ risk of developing UC is lower, about 40% that of nonsmokers. Former smokers, however, have a 1.7 times increased risk for
UC over lifetime nonsmokers.
Smoking is associated with a twofold increased risk of CD and increases
rates of disease flares. Current smoking is associated with resistance to
medical therapy.
Concomitant infections (intestinal and extraintestinal) can exacerbate
IBD.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often cited as
worsening IBD, but the data are conflicting. Short courses of
cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors (e.g., celecoxib) may be safer than
nonselective NSAID in patients with UC in remission.
Appendectomy before age 20 for appendicitis or lymphadenitis may
protect against developing UC but not CD.
Stress and psychopathology do not increase the onset of IBD, but stress
may increase exacerbations of IBD possibly via activation of the enteric
nervous system and elaboration of proinflammatory cytokines.
Controversy remains as to whether oral contraceptive or isotretinoin
275

(Accutane) use puts individuals at increased risk of IBD.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Crohn’s disease
Clinical manifestations of CD are more variable than those of UC
because of the transmural nature and the variability of disease locations.
CD may present with GI symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms, or both.
Ileal and colonic CD can present with chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain,
weight loss, fatigue, and fever, with or without rectal bleeding (bleeding
is less common than in UC). CD patients do not uniformly have diarrhea
(Table 16-2).
Coexistent irritable bowel syndrome can contribute to symptoms of pain
and diarrhea highlighting the importance of using objective measures
when determining disease activity.
Signs can include cachexia, abdominal tenderness or mass (most
commonly in the right lower quadrant), perianal fissures, fistulas, or
abscess.
Gastric and duodenal CD may present with nausea and vomiting,
epigastric pain, or gastric outlet obstruction.
Oral and esophageal CD can present as oral ulcers, gum pain,
dysphagia, and odynophagia.
A proposed severity classification is as follows 4:
Mild-moderate disease: Patients are able to tolerate oral intake
without signs of systemic toxicity.
Moderate-severe disease: Patients have failed therapy for mildmoderate disease, or have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers,
dehydration, anemia, or weight loss of > 10%.
Severe-fulminant disease: Persistent symptoms after corticosteroid
therapy, or the presence of high fevers, obstruction, cachexia, surgical
abdomen, or abscess formation.
Remission: Asymptomatic patients who have no evidence of disease
after medical or surgical intervention.
Ulcerative colitis
276

Patients with UC can have varying symptoms and signs dictated by
anatomic extent and disease severity (Table 16-2).
Rectal bleeding is much more common in UC than in CD. UC can
involve mucous passage, urgency, diarrhea, or fever.
Tenesmus (the constant feeling of the need to empty the bowel with
false alarms), pain, and cramping are common.
The Montreal classification of symptoms severity is helpful for
determining UC management 3:
Clinical remission: asymptomatic
Mild disease: fewer than four stools a day (may be bloody) and no
signs of systemic toxicity, normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Moderate UC: four to six stools per day and minimal signs of systemic
toxicity
Severe UC: more than six loose stools per day, pulse rate of 90 beats
per minute, higher temperatures of ≥ 37.5° F, hemoglobin 10.5,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate ≥ 30
Fulminant colitis was previously used to describe > 10 stools a day,
continuous bleeding, and tenderness or distension and dilation on
imaging but is along the continuum with severe colitis.
Toxic megacolon can develop with severe systemic manifestations in
addition to fulminant colitis. Potential precipitants include opiates,
electrolyte abnormalities, antimotility agents, and intercurrent infectious
colitis. The colon can be dilated up to 5 to 6 cm with a precipitous
decrease in bowel movement frequency; rarely, the colon may not be
dilated. Complications include sepsis, hemorrhage, and perforation.
Extraintestinal manifestations
Extraintestinal complications are frequent in both CD and UC. 5 These
involve almost any organ system and contribute considerably to patient
morbidity (Table 16-3).
Extraintestinal manifestations may parallel or be independent of
intestinal disease activity. These are typically associated with UC or
colonic CD.
The presence of one manifestation increases the likelihood of having
others. Extraintestinal manifestations represent autoimmune-related
processes, with antibodies against antigens shared among the colon and
four common locations (skin, joints, eyes, and liver).
Ankylosing spondylitis and sacroiliitis are more common in CD than
277

in UC. Other joint manifestations include pauciarticular, asymmetric,
peripheral arthritis of the larger joints and a polyarticular, symmetric
arthritis of the small joints.
Osteoporosis is common and is multifactorial in origin. Steroid use,
malabsorption, low intake or absorption of dietary calcium and vitamin
D, low body weight, and relative hypogonadism have all been
implicated.
Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is seen in about 5% of patients
with UC, more commonly than in CD. Conversely, most patients with PSC
have colitis.

278

Rates of both venous and arterial thromboembolism are increased
in IBD. IBD-associated hypercoagulable state can occur both dependent
and independent of disease activity.
Nephrolithiasis can be related to ileal CD because of the formation of
oxalate stones. Fat malabsorption in CD leads to increased absorption of
free dietary oxalate, which then binds to available calcium ions to form
kidney stones.
Generally, manifestations that parallel disease activity are managed by
intensification of intestinal IBD therapy, whereas the other conditions are
treated symptomatically.
History

A careful history should be obtained to include the following:
Epidemiology and risk factors such as smoking and family history
Disease onset and duration and severity of current symptoms
Presence or absence of constitutional symptoms
Extraintestinal manifestations
279

Symptoms of infections, risk factors for superimposed infections
Quality of life, impairment of daily activities
Prior clinical course including medication and surgical history
Physical Examination

A full physical examination should be performed.
Vital signs should be reviewed along with weight trends.
A careful abdominal examination is essential. The abdomen should be
auscultated for high-pitched or absent bowel sounds. The abdomen may
be tender in both CD and UC. Right lower quadrant tenderness and
fullness is classic in CD involving the terminal ileum. A palpable mass is
also more common in CD than in UC. Peritoneal signs are concerning for
an intestinal perforation.
A rectal and perianal examination should be performed for evaluating
skin tags, anal fissures, and fistulae or abscesses that would suggest CD
rather than UC. Gross or occult blood on the examining finger may
indicate active disease.
Skin, joint, and eye examinations should also be performed to evaluate
for the presence of extraintestinal manifestations (Table 16-3).
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis of IBD is extensive (Table 16-4) and includes
infectious as well as noninfectious causes. Chronic symptoms of 3
months or longer are suggestive of IBD.

280

At initial presentation and during exacerbations, it is important to rule
out infectious disease. Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Aeromonas,
Escherichia coli 0157:H7, Clostridium difficile, and sexually transmitted
diseases can all cause bloody diarrhea.
Findings suggestive of CD include rectal sparing; small bowel
involvement; absence of gross bleeding; presence of perianal disease;
and the presence of skip lesions, granulomas, or fistula (Table 16-3).
In about 10% to 15% of patients with colonic IBD, the distinction
between CD and UC cannot be made, and these are termed
inflammatory bowel disease, type unclassified (IBDU).
281

Indeterminate colitis is reserved for whom pathologic diagnosis
cannot be made even after colectomy and full examination of the colon.
In the future, combined genetic and serologic markers may assist in
distinguishing CD and UC. 4
Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis of IBD is made with a combination of clinical, laboratory,
radio-graphic, endoscopic, and pathologic findings.
Laboratory Tests

Laboratory tests can help support, but not confirm, the diagnosis in
clinical presentations consistent with IBD.
Evaluation should include a complete blood cell count to assess for
anemia and leukocytosis. A complete metabolic panel evaluates for
electrolyte and metabolic abnormalities related to IBD.
Elevated levels of C-reactive protein are nonspecific but are observed
in active IBD. This is generally higher in CD than in UC.
Stool studies (C. difficile, culture, ova, and parasites) should be sent to
evaluate for superimposed infections that may mimic IBD. Some
clinicians use fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin to distinguish inflammatory
from noninflammatory diarrhea.
Autoantibodies have been detected in IBD patients. The two most
commonly used antibody tests are antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibodies (p-ANCA), which is more common in UC, and
anti-Saccharomyces cerevisiae antibodies (ASCA), which along
with anti-Omp C antibody and antibody against CBir1 flagellin,
are more common in CD. Combination serologic testing is available
commercially and is used by some physicians to distinguish between CD
and UC.
Imaging

A plain abdominal radiograph is helpful in the acute setting to
evaluate for toxic megacolon or bowel obstruction.
Small bowel follow-through x-ray series can provide evaluation of the
small bowel in CD. Typical features are luminal narrowing with “string”
sign, nodularity and ulceration, a “cobblestone” appearance, and fistulae
or abscess formation.
282

Air contrast barium enema may be used to confirm the anatomic
pattern and extent of disease in UC and Crohn’s colitis. Barium studies
may be normal despite endoscopically evident mild disease. Barium
enema must be avoided in severely ill patients because of the risk of
precipitating ileus with toxic megacolon.
Computed tomography and magnetic resonance enterography
are useful in evaluating specific complications (e.g., abscesses,
stricutures, and fistulas). Magnetic resonance enterography has the
advantage of avoiding radiation exposure and has become an imaging
modality of choice at many institutions for nonemergent evaluations.
Diagnostic Procedures

Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and biopsy can usually differentiate CD,
UC, and disorders that mimic IBD. Colonoscopy assesses disease
location, extent, and severity to confirm IBD diagnosis, obtains tissue for
histologic evaluation, and assesses response to therapy.
Endoscopic features common to both CD and UC include pseudopolyps,
loss of haustral folds, fibrotic strictures, and linear superficial scars.
In CD, specific endoscopic features include discrete aphthous ulcers,
“cobblestoning” (formed by deep linear ulcers), discontinuous “skip”
lesions, rectal sparing, and involvement of the terminal ileum.
In UC, endoscopy shows contiguous and circumferential involvement,
beginning at the anal verge and extending proximally to a transition to
normal mucosa. Erythema, loss of the fine vascular pattern, mucosal
granularity, friability, and edema are seen.
On histopathology, aphthoid ulcers, focal crypt abscesses, and chronic
trans-mural inflammatory infiltrates can be seen only in CD.
Noncaseating granulomas are pathognomonic for CD but are seen in
only 50% of biopsies.
Continuous, diffuse inflammatory infiltrate confined to the mucosa and
submucosa, cryptitis, and crypt abscesses are common in UC.
Complete colonoscopy is typically not performed in patients with severe
colitis or toxic megacolon because of the increased risk of perforation.
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is often performed in these circumstances to rule
out a complicating superinfection with C. difficile or cytomegalovirus.
Capsule endoscopy can be useful in diagnosing CD of the small bowel
when diseased areas cannot be reached by endoscopy, but risk of
283

intestinal obstruction exists if the capsule lodges in a tight stricture. The
use of a “patency capsule” prior to the capsule endoscopy may help
avert this complication; many centers obtain a barium small bowel
follow-through series prior to a capsule study.

TREATMENT

Medications

Medical therapy for both CD and UC includes induction and maintenance
phases of therapy.6,7
Choice of treatment modality takes disease location or extent, severity,
complications, and extraintestinal manifestations into consideration.
Initiation of immunosuppressant or immunomodulator therapy requires
ruling out any superimposed infections.
5-Aminosalicylic acid compounds
5-Aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) drugs are used for induction and
maintenance of remission in mild to moderate IBD. In CD, they may
have modest efficacy in delaying postoperative recurrence or treating
colonic disease.
Available formulations in the United States are mesalamine (Pentasa,
Asacol, Asacol HD, Apriso, Lialda), sulfasalazine, and balsalazide
(Colazal), as well as rectal mesalamine (Canasa, Rowasa). These
formulations differ in the mechanism of release of 5-ASA (Table 16-5).

284

Therapeutic effects of sulfasalazine are derived primarily from the 5-ASA
moiety, whereas side effects are mostly caused by its sulfa moiety.
Nausea, vomiting, malaise, anorexia, and headache are dose related,
whereas hypersensitivity reactions (rash, fever, hemolytic anemia,
agranulocytosis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, and worsening of colitis) are
idiosyncratic. Nonsulfa 5-ASA derivatives are better tolerated than
sulfasalazine and can be escalated to higher doses of 5-ASA.
In patients with colonic disease and associated peripheral arthropathy,
sulfasalazine has benefit as a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug.
Other potential side effects of all 5-ASA drugs are diarrhea and
285

abdominal pain. These drugs are safe in pregnancy. 5-ASA drugs should
be used with caution in patients with salicylate or sulfa allergy.
There are reports of nephrotoxicity from interstitial nephritis with 5-ASA
compounds. This is more frequent in the first year of therapy but can
occur at any time. Serum creatinine level is usually measured before and
monitored during treatment.
Topical rectal therapies are useful in induction and maintenance for
ulcerative proctitis. These agents provide added benefit to orally
administered 5-ASA preparations in the treatment of more extensive
colitis.
Once remission is achieved, lower doses of sulfasalazine (2 g daily) or
mesalamine (2.4 g daily) may maintain remission in UC or potentially
reduce postoperative relapse rates in CD.
Maintenance 5-ASA treatment has been shown to reduce risk of
developing colorectal cancer.
Antibiotics
Although a specific causative microorganism has not been identified in
IBD, antibiotics have a role in disease therapy.
Antibiotic use in Crohn’s disease:
Metronidazole (10 or 20 mg/kg/day) with or without ciprofloxacin
(500 mg PO BID) may be useful in the treatment of mildly active luminal
CD.
Metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, or combinations thereof are
often used for extended periods in CD patients who have fistulas,
abscesses, or perianal disease.
Antibiotics are indicated for bacterial overgrowth, seen with small bowel
strictures or after ileocolic resection.
Patients taking long-term metronidazole need to be monitored
closely for peripheral neuropathy, which can be irreversible.
Ciprofloxacin use has been associated with tendon inflammation and/or
rupture, especially in patients using concurrent steroids, age > 60 years,
or organ transplant recipients.
Antibiotic use in ulcerative colitis:
In fulminant colitis, antibiotics reduce the risk of bacterial translocation.
Otherwise, antibiotics do not have a role in the management of UC.
Corticosteroids
In UC and CD:
286

Corticosteroids have long been used to induce remission in moderate
to severe IBD, and to treat patients who have active disease despite
other simpler therapies (e.g., 5-ASA).
Steroids are ineffective in maintaining remission or preventing
relapse, and their use should be limited, given their numerous side
effects.
Superimposed infections, such as cytomegalovirus or C. difficile, and
complications, including toxic megacolon or perforation, must be
considered before starting steroids.
Both oral prednisone (40 to 60 mg daily) and intravenous
methylprednisolone (40 to 60 mg daily) induce remission in patients
with active disease compared with placebo. Doses are typically tapered
(about 5 mg/ week) when a clinical response has been achieved. Tapers
should be slow (over 2 to 3 months), as rapid tapers lead to return of
symptoms.
As > 50% of patients treated acutely with steroids become steroid
dependent or refractory, a maintenance strategy (such as an
immunomodulator or a biologic agent) needs to be considered when
initiating steroids.
In Crohn’s disease:
Budesonide (up to 9 mg daily) is a controlled-release corticosteroid
with high local potency and lower systemic activity due to high first-pass
hepatic metabolism. It is an alternative to prednisone in patients with
distal small bowel disease and may reduce systemic side effects.
In ulcerative colitis:
Steroid enemas (e.g., Cortenema) or foams (e.g., Cortifoam or
Proctofoam) can be used to treat rectal disease.
If tapering leads to a return of symptoms despite 5-ASA treatment, an
immunomodulator or biologic should be considered.
Immunomodulator therapy
Oral azathioprine (AZA, 2.5 to 3 mg/kg/day) and its metabolite 6mercaptopurine (6-MP; 1.5 mg/kg/day) are used to achieve
maintenance of steroid-free remission in CD and UC, especially with
recurrent disease flares as steroid-sparing agents.
In CD, these agents have a role in fistulous CD and perianal disease and
in preventing postoperative relapses.
Onset of action is generally delayed for as long as 8 to 12 weeks, and
287

full therapeutic effect can take 3 to 6 months of continued use. Time to
efficacy can be shortened by starting at full-weight–based dose rather
than using a titration approach.
Side effects of thiopurines:
Bone marrow suppression (including granulocytosis), pancreatitis,
allergic reactions, hepatitis, and life-threatening infections have been
reported but are usually reversible on discontinuation of therapy. Allergic
symptoms, such as joint aches, fevers, nausea, and malaise, typically
occur within the first 1 to 2 weeks of use; pancreatitis occurs around
week 3 and leukopenia by week 4.
Susceptibility to early, severe leukopenia can be predicted before
initiation by measuring thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT)
enzyme activity. TPMT is responsible for drug metabolism. However,
TPMT testing does not substitute for monitoring blood counts. 6-MP and
AZA should be avoided in patients with very low TPMT activity, and the
starting dose should be lowered with intermediate activity. See Chapter
24 for further discussion.
Blood counts should be followed every 7 to 10 days the first 4
weeks and after dose increases. Once the goal dose has been
reached, a complete blood cell count should be checked every 3 months.
If the leukocyte count falls below 3000 cells/ μ L, the dose should be
lowered or held.
An increased risk of lymphoma is reported with azathioprine or 6-MP, but
the overall absolute risk still remains quite low. The risk of hepatosplenic
T-cell lymphoma in young men is modestly elevated when used
concurrently with anti-TNF agents.
Although controversial, experts feel the risk of harm to a developing
fetus is low. Since active disease is associated with poor fetal outcomes,
the risks and benefits of discontinuing therapy during pregnancy should
be carefully considered.
Monitoring response to therapy.
6-Thioguanine nucleotide (6-TGN), the active metabolite of 6-MP, can be
checked to assess for adequate therapeutic levels of the medications.
Low 6-TGN levels can indicate underdosing, high metabolism, or
nonadherence. Adequate levels of 6-TGN without a clinical response may
indicate the need to change to other therapies.8
The second metabolite that is measured is 6-MMP, which is inactive.
288

Patients who preferentially produce large amounts of 6-MMP can be
given allopurinol to shift the metabolism toward increased production of
6-TGN. The addition of allopurinol is accompanied by a decrease in the
dose of the immunomodulator to 25% of the original dose due to drug–
drug interactions. If this technique is used, close monitoring of blood
counts is obligatory.
CD-specific immunomodulators.
Subcutaneous or intramuscular methotrexate (25 mg weekly) is more
effective than placebo in inducing remission in patients with severe CD,
with trials showing an effective dose for maintenance of remission at 15
mg weekly. Current evidence is insufficient to support the use of
methotrexate for UC.
UC-specific immunomodulators:
Intravenous cyclosporine (2 to 4 mg/kg/day) has been shown
effective in fulminant UC, but side effects include grand mal seizures,
opportunistic infection, and bowel perforation. Cyclosporine probably has
little role in most cases of CD.
The roles of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil in IBD therapy
require further study.
Biologic (antibody-based) therapy
TNF- α is an important cytokine in the pathogenesis of both CD and UC.
Three monoclonal antibodies against TNF are used in CD therapy:
infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab. Only infliximab is currently
approved for therapy of UC, though trials with adalimumab met clinical
endpoints, and FDA approval is anticipated for use in UC (Table 166).9–15
Considerations with biologic therapy:
A recent randomized trial study of biologic and immunomodulator-naive
patients with CD suggests a benefit to combination therapy with
infliximab and AZA for maintenance, when evaluated at 26 and 50
weeks, as compared with infliximab or AZA alone (SONIC trial). 16
Whether this concept extends to other biologics is not yet known.
Clinical experience with infliximab and adalimumab demonstrates that
increases in dosing or dose frequency are sometimes required to
maintain therapeutic effect.
Important side effects:
Acute infusion reactions and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions are
289

more common with repeat infusions of infliximab, especially after a
prolonged interval since the previous infusion (over 12 weeks).
Development of human antichimeric antibodies, often referred to as
antibodies to infliximab, occur in 10% to 15% of cases and are
associated with decreased efficacy.
Reactivation of latent tuberculosis can occur; therefore, a purified
protein-derivative skin test must be placed and confirmed negative
before therapy. Congestive heart failure has also been reported. Because
of reports of disseminated histoplasmosis, a chest radiograph can be
considered in endemic areas to assess for granulomatous disease. Other
mild and self-limited side effects include headache, upper respiratory
infection, and nausea.

Side effects of subcutaneously administered biologic agents include
injection site reactions or pain. Other side effects, including risk for
infections and lymphoma, are similar in all biologic categories.
Natalizumab has been associated with progressive multifocal
leukoencephalopathy in clinical trials. Its use is reserved for patients who
have failed all other CD therapies.
There are multiple novel biologics currently being developed for CD.
These new therapies utilize unique targets based on modern
understanding of CD genetics and pathogenesis.
Antidiarrheal agents
290

Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide (Imodium), codeine, or
tincture of opium may decrease the frequency and volume of diarrhea.
These agents should be withheld if intestinal infection or severely active
disease is suspected because of the risk of toxic megacolon.
Surgical Management

Crohn’s disease
Surgical management is often necessary for certain complications,
including intractable hemorrhage, perforation, persistent obstruction
from stricturing disease, abscess, or disease activity intractable to
medical therapy. Abscesses often require drainage under radiographic
guidance or with surgery.
Surgical resection is not curative in CD, with clinical recurrence rates of
10% to 15% annually. Postoperative management with
immunomodulators, metronidazole, or mesalamine may lower recurrence
rates. Recent studies suggest that anti-TNF therapy may also be very
effective.17
Smoking increases recurrence rates.
Suppurative perianal disease is often treated surgically with the
placement of a noncutting seton (silastic band).
Therapeutic options for strictures include strictureplasty, endoscopic
balloon dilation, and local injection of steroids or biologic glues. All
strictures should be biopsied to exclude malignancy.
Ulcerative colitis
Medically refractory disease activity is the most common reason for
surgery in UC. Less commonly, total colectomy is required for acutely ill
patients with megacolon or systemic toxicity not responding to medical
therapy within 48 hours.
Proctocolectomy or colectomy with rectal preservation is
curative in UC. The mortality of colectomy is low even in severe cases.
Advances in surgical technique allow for the creation of an ileal pouch–
anal anastomosis, and a permanent ileostomy is typically not required.18
Pouchitis, or inflammation of the surgically created ileal reservoir, is
the most common complication of this surgery and occurs at least in a
mild form in ~ 50% of the population. Symptoms include increased stool
frequency, urgency, hematochezia, abdominal pain, and fever, but the
diagnosis is made endoscopically and histologically. First-line therapy is
291

typically with antibiotics (metronidazole or ciprofloxacin); probiotics
(such as VSL#3) may be useful for prevention. Recurrent or refractory
pouchitis may represent misdiagnosed CD, which is typically confirmed
when significant inflammation is identified proximal to the pouch. Pouch
excision is required in 5% of patients.
Cuffitis is an inflammation due to a short section of retained rectal
mucosa and is treated with topical steroids or 5-ASA suppositories.
Lifestyle/Risk Modification
Diet, Nutrition, and Complementary Therapies

No dietary factors have been shown to either cause or cure IBD. On an
individual basis, certain foods may trigger symptomatic exacerbations
and may need avoidance.
In stricturing disease, a low-residue diet (avoidance of pulps, peels,
and whole leaf vegetables) is recommended to avoid obstruction.
Maintenance of adequate nutrition is essential in the care of CD patients.
Approximately, 75% of CD patients admitted to the hospital are
malnourished.
Nutritional deficiencies are typically related to decreased oral intake,
malabsorption, and blood loss. Vitamin and nutrient supplementation
may be needed after small bowel resection or in the setting of extensive
bowel involvement. For example, patients with ileitis may need vitamin
B 12 supplementation.
Common deficiencies in CD include vitamins B 12, A, and D, calcium,
potassium, iron, and zinc. In UC, common deficiencies are folate, vitamin
D, and iron, and less commonly vitamin B 12. Levels should be measured.
Repletion and prophylactic supplementation may be beneficial.
To meet nutritional needs, enteral feeding is generally preferable to
parenteral [total parenteral nutrition (TPN)]. In certain refractory
situations, TPN is efficacious in refractory CD when used in conjunction
with bowel rest and medical therapy. In these instances, discontinuation
of TPN may be associated with high relapse rates.
Some probiotics have shown efficacy in maintenance of remission in UC
(VSL#3, E. coli Nissle). They also have a role in the treatment of
pouchitis (VSL#3). The evidence for the effective use of probiotics in CD
is poor.
292

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Pregnancy in IBD
Pregnancy has been associated with both improvement and worsening of
disease activity.19
High disease activity is associated with poor fetal outcomes, mainly
preterm delivery. Thus, achieving remission prior to conception is
optimal.
Medical therapy of IBD in pregnancy should be addressed by a
gastroenterologists and obstetricians experienced with such care. The
risk to benefit ratio for biologic or immunomodulator therapy should be
considered.
Systemic steroids should be avoided in the first trimester but may be the
therapy of choice in the third trimester. Methotrexate is a known
teratogen.
Microscopic colitis
Microscopic colitis (MC) consists of a group of diseases characterized by
chronic, watery, nonbloody diarrhea, with largely normal endoscopic
findings. MC is less common than CD and UC.
The two main types of MC are collagenous colitis and lymphocytic
colitis, although mixed forms and variants have also been described. On
histology, a thickened subepithelial collagenous band is seen with
collagenous colitis. Lymphocytic colitis is marked by a subepithelial
lymphocytic infiltrate.
Etiology is unknown, and it is doubtful that a single pathogenetic
mechanism exists.
Collagenous colitis has a female-to-male predominance of 9 to 15:1,
whereas lymphocytic colitis has equal incidence in both genders. Onset
typically occurs after age 50.
Collagenous colitis may be caused by abnormal collagen metabolism,
particularly reduced matrix degradation rather than enhanced synthesis.
Vascular endothelial growth factor may play a role in this collagen
balance. Celiac disease, bacterial toxins, NSAIDs, selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors, and other drugs have been linked to the
development of MC.
The clinical presentation of collagenous and lymphocytic colitis
293

consists of progressively increasing watery diarrhea that is often
refractory to over-the-counter antidiarrheal medications. Associated
symptoms can include nausea, abdominal pain, and fecal urgency. Many
patients have a diagnosis of a diarrhea predominant irritable bowel
syndrome until colonic pathology is examined, stressing the importance
of colonoscopy and random biopsies of normal appearing mucosa.
Although the disease course is generally benign, relapsing and remitting
symptoms can be debilitating. Patients should be reassured that MC is
not associated with increased mortality or an increased risk of
developing colorectal cancer. NSAIDs or other drugs associated with MC
should be discontinued if possible. Patients should be tested for celiac
disease.
Antidiarrheal agents, such as loperamide and lomotil, can be first
tried. Most cases referred to a gastroenterologist lead to a trial of
budesonide (9 mg daily for a month, followed by a taper over next 2
months). Bismuth subsalicylate, cholestyramine, and mesalamine
products are effective in some patients. In refractory cases,
immunomodulators, systemic corticosteroids, and even biologic-based
therapy have been tried.

REFERRAL
With advances in newer biologic therapies as well as improved understanding of
existing medications, treatment of moderate or severe IBD is best orchestrated by
physicians with significant experience in IBD management or in specialized centers
focusing on IBD.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Response to therapy.
In addition to symptomatic improvement, mucosal healing is an
important endpoint, as it can indicate better long-term outcomes,
including decreased rates of hospitalization and surgical resections.
Routine endoscopy with biopsies is recommended.
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a source of significant morbidity, impaired quality of life,
294

and costs in IBD.
IBD itself only modestly lowers bone mineral density but increases the
risk of fractures by 40% over the general population.
Bone densitometry (DEXA) scan to read (DEXA scan) is indicated in all
postmenopausal women and those with exposure to corticosteroids.
Other useful tests include an alkaline phosphatase, calcium level
(corrected for serum albumin), creatinine, testosterone level (males),
and 25-OH-vitamin D level.
All patients should be educated about the importance of regular weightbearing exercise and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol intake.
Adequate intake of vitamin D (800 IU daily) and calcium (1000 to 1500
mg daily) is recommended.
Bisphosphonates are used in patients at highest risk for fractures.
Malignancy
Patients with UC and colonic CD are at increased risk for colorectal
cancer (CRC) compared with the general population (see also Chapter
15). The level of risk is related to the duration, severity, and colonic
extent of inflammation. Risks are higher with a family history of CRC.
Because CRC is generally preceded by dysplasia, surveillance is
recommended to detect and intervene when dysplasia is found.20
In patients with UC and pancolitis, CRC risk seems to increase after 8 to
10 years of symptoms. The cumulative incidence of CRC in UC is 5% to
10% after 20 years and 12% to 20% after 30 years of disease, although
recent studies report lower incidences.
For left-sided colitis, CRC risk may increase after 15 to 20 years. Distal
colitis and proctosigmoiditis probably do not increase the risk of CRC.
Patients with UC with PSC have an even higher increased risk for
developing CRC.
Surveillance colonoscopy with random biopsies is recommended
beginning after 8 years of pancolitis and after 15 years of left-sided
colitis and then repeated every 1 to 2 years thereafter. No screening is
recommended for ulcerative proctitis.
Patients with an ileal pouch should undergo flexible sigmoidoscopy with
biopsies every other year.
Colectomy is generally recommended for carcinoma, high-grade
dysplasia, and multifocal low-grade dysplasia.
In CD, patients with long-standing colitis or age > 30 years at diagnosis
295

are at greatest risk. Recommended surveillance strategies are similar to
those for UC.
Other health-maintenance issues.21
IBD patients on immunomodulators and biologic therapy should be up to
date in vaccinations against preventable illnesses. Considerations
include hepatitis A/B, yearly influenza, pneumococcus, meningococcus,
tetanus. After immunosuppressive therapy has begun, live-attenuated
vaccines should be avoided.
Pap smears should also be performed regularly, as there is an increased
risk of abnormal pap smears with thiopurine therapy. Vaccination against
malignancy-associated human papillomavirus (Gardasil) should be
offered.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Both CD and UC are chronic diseases with intermittent exacerbations of
mild to severe symptoms alternating with periods of varying levels of
remission.
About 10% to 20% of patients with CD will experience a very prolonged
remission after initial presentation. Conversely, predictors of a severe
course include age 40 years, presence of perianal disease, initial
requirement of corticosteroids, and perforating disease. CD can be
associated with a modest decrease in overall life expectancy.
The course of UC depends on extent of disease. Proctitis and distal colitis
usually have a more benign course, resolving spontaneously in about
20% of cases.
In UC, increased relapse rates are seen in younger patients (ages 20–30
years), older patients (>70 years), women, those with more than five
prior relapses, and those with basal plasmacytosis on rectal biopsy.
Approximately 30% undergo colectomy after 15 to 25 years of disease.
Overall mortality is only slightly increased compared with the general
population.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Background and Definition

The functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are a group of chronic
or recurrent conditions where in alterations in bowel sensitivity, motility,
or both are predominant manifestations.
These commonly encountered conditions impose substantial burdens on
patient well-being and, in turn, account for large portion of visits to both
primary care physicians and gastroenterologists.
FGIDs represent a complex interface between abnormal GI motility,
visceral hypersensitivity, altered central nervous system (CNS)
processing of peripheral stimuli, as well as psychosocial factors.
Importantly, by definition, FGIDs lack identifiable structural abnormalities
on diagnostic evaluations.
FGID symptoms can arise from any portion of the GI tract (esophagus to
anus), and frequently multiple FGIDs may be identified in the same
individual.
These functional syndromes, as defined by the Rome criteria,1 are listed
in Table 17-1.
The prototypical and most common functional GI disorder is irritable
bowel syndrome (IBS), which is characterized by abdominal pain or
discomfort associated with defecation or a change in bowel habit and
features of disordered defecation (constipation and/or diarrhea).

299

Classification

Several historical diagnostic criteria for IBS exist, with the Rome III
criteria (Table 17-2) representing the most recent and encompassing
criteria. It should be asserted that these criteria were devised primarily
as a tool for devising clinical studies in the area.
When applied to clinical practice, these criteria have a high positive
predictive value (>95%).
Although they are not necessary for IBS diagnosis, several supporting
symptoms (Table 17-3) help to solidify the diagnosis and further
characterize the disorder into IBS with constipation (IBS-C), IBS with
diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed IBS (IBS-M), or unsubtyped IBS.
Epidemiology

IBS is frequently seen in both primary care and specialty care settings
and is one of the most common diagnoses seen by gastroenterologists.2
Estimates place the prevalence of IBS anywhere from 1% to 20%
worldwide.
Systematic reviews from suggest 5% to 10% of individuals in North
America are affected with IBS.3

300

Population surveys of adults have shown IBS to be more prevalent in
women than in men, with a ratio of 3 to 4:1.
Symptom onset tends to occur before 50 years of age, but it can occur at
anytime.
When considering a new diagnosis of IBS in older individuals, exclusion
of other mimicking conditions (celiac disease, inflammatory bowel
disease, small intestinal bacterial over growth) is essential.

301

As few as one in three individuals affected with IBS in the United States
actually seek medical attention.
Still, the cost to society is considerable, accounting for ~3.6 million
physician visits and $1.6 billion in direct medical costs each year.
Indirect costs in the form of work absenteeism may reach as high as $19
billion per annum.
The burden on the patient is also considerable with health-related
quality-of-life scores similar to patients with diabetes and worse than
patients with chronic kidney disease and gastroesophageal reflux
disease.4
Pathophysiology

No single pathophysiologic abnormality has been found that adequately
explains the manifestations of IBS.
Given the symptomatic basis on which the diagnosis is made, it is
conceivable that more than one pathophysiologic mechanism may be
operative.
Multiple factors, including abnormalities of intestinal motility, visceral
302

hypersensitivity, GI tract inflammatory processes, disturbances along the
brain–gut axis, and psychological factors, have been examined as
potentially causative in IBS.
A portion of patients with IBS will exhibit exaggerated motility, and
sensory responses to stressors, meals, and balloon inflation in the GI
tract can be identified.
These motility responses, however, are neither uniformly identifiable in
patients with IBS nor consistently detectable in the same individual.
Nonetheless, accelerated transit times may be seen in diarrheapredominant IBS and slowed transit times in constipation-predominant
IBS.
IBS may result from sensitization of afferent neural pathways from the
gut in such a fashion that normal intestinal stimuli induce pain.
IBS patients have a lower pain threshold to balloon distention of the
colon than healthy volunteers, while retaining normal sensitivity to
somatic stimuli.
Intestinal inflammation has also been hypothesized as playing a role in
the development of IBS, particularly as it relates to persistent
neuroimmune interactions following infectious gastroenteritis
(“postinfectious IBS”).
Approximately one-third of patients with IBS report symptom onset after
an episode of acute gastroenteritis.
Seven percent to 30% of patients presenting with an acute enteric
infection go on to develop IBS-like symptoms.
Psychological distress (particularly somatization) seems to be an
important cofactor in determining who develops persistent functional
symptoms following an enteric infection.
The role of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) in the
development of IBS has been a focus of recent investigations.5
The evidence for the role of SIBO in IBS remains incompletely
understood and likely is relevant to only a subset of IBS patients.6
The CNS (and its interpretation of peripheral enteric nerve signals) is
receiving increasing attention in investigational settings because of the
potential mechanistic significance in IBS.
Differential responses of brain activation to both noxious rectal
stimulation and anticipated rectal discomfort can be appreciated in
patients with IBS.
303

These connections are both the focus of intense research and the
potential target for novel therapies.
Psychological factors (anxiety, depression, somatization) are important
in their potential to further modulate this afferent pain network but, by
themselves, are not sufficient explanations of IBS pathogenesis.7
In addition to amplifying both visceral and somatic pain experiences, the
patient’s psychological framework may also influence illness behaviors,
such as seeking health care.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History and Physical Examination

IBS is a symptom-based diagnosis founded on a reporting of abdominal
discomfort and a temporal association with alterations in stool pattern,
improvement with bowel movement, or both.
IBS diagnosis requires an element of chronicity (per Rome criteria, ≥3
days per month over the preceding 3 months).
The diagnosis of IBS should be made after organic causes have been
considered, so a careful search for alarm symptoms should be conducted.
Important alarm symptoms include weight loss of ≥10 lb (≥4.53 kg),
recurrent fever, persistent diarrhea, hematochezia, age >50 years, and
family history of GI malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or celiac
sprue.
A brief history of rapidly progressive symptoms suggests organic disease.
The presence of any such “red flag” features warrants a more entailed
investigation before establishing a diagnosis of IBS.
Likewise, the physical examination should be focused to exclude organic
disease.
Diffuse abdominal tenderness is commonly present because of the
heightened visceral sensitivity noted in this population.
Physical examination alarm signs include the presence of ascites,
jaundice, organomegaly, abdominal mass, adenopathy, or heme-positive
stool.
304

Diagnostic Testing

Laboratory and invasive testing should be kept to a minimum,
because extensive or repetitive investigations may be costly and serve
only to reinforce illness behavior.
Initial laboratory testing should include a complete blood cell count,
erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and fecal occult blood test when
appropriate.
These tests, along with a complete metabolic profile, stool culture, and
Clostridium difficile toxin assay can be ordered if the pretest probability
is high enough but likely are low yield for the majority of IBS patients.
Testing for celiac sprue should be considered in all IBS patients
(particularly in IBS-D and IBS-M).
Sensitivity and specificity of glucose and lactose breath tests are
inadequate to evaluate for SIBO, and these are not recommended for
use in IBS patients.3
Small bowel aspirates and culture are cumbersome and expensive; these
tests also are reserved for research settings.
Endoscopy (esophagoduodenoscopy and colonoscopy) may be
unnecessary in young patients presenting with classic features of IBS
without any alarm symptoms.
These studies should be considered in all patients older than 50 years
(also important part of routine colon cancer screening).3
In this setting, colonoscopy offers the following advantages:
Rule out inflammation or tumors (especially in patients older than 50
years).
Identify melanosis coli indicative of laxative abuse.
Allow detection of visceral hypersensitivity to visceral pain via
endoscopic insufflation of the colon.

TREATMENT

General Principles

The approach to therapy in IBS is multifaceted and should be tailored to
the patient, given the individual’s constellation and severity of
305

symptoms.8 Two key factors that determine therapy are as follows:
Dominant symptoms (diarrhea, constipation, pain, other)
Symptom severity (intensity, bother, effects on quality of life)
Current management approaches include peripherally acting agents,
centrally acting agents, and psychological-behavioral therapy.
Cases with mild or intermittent symptoms can be managed with
symptomatic treatment using peripherally acting agents administered on
an as-needed basis.
Patients with moderate symptoms (as designated by intermittent
interference with daily activities) may benefit from regular use of
peripheral agents as an initial approach, with the option of introducing
centrally acting agents if this approach fails.
Patients with severe symptoms (regular interference with daily activities
and concurrent affective, personality, and psychosomatic disorders)
benefit from combinations of peripherally and centrally acting agents but
may also need contemporary pharmaceutical agents and cognitivebehavioral therapy (CBT) to manage their overlapping affective,
personality, and psychosomatic disorders.
Although medical therapy is available and new drugs are currently in
development, IBS is a lifelong condition with exacerbations and
remissions, and medications should be minimized to the extent possible.
Clearly, narcotics have no role in the management of IBS.

Given the lack of identifiable biomarkers, trials of medications are
frequently part of the IBS diagnostic process.
These trials should be pursued for ≥4 weeks before moving on to
306

different therapy.
If failure to respond to a single agent in a drug class is experienced,
response to a different drug in the same class may still be observed.
It is important to recognize the substantial (up to 50%) placebo
response rates present in this patient population.
Patient education and reassurance while establishing a therapeutic
relationship are cornerstones in the management of this condition.
The strength of the physician’s relationship with the patient correlates to
higher rates of patient satisfaction and fewer return visits.
Table 17-4 summarizes general management principles for patients with
IBS or other functional bowel disorders.
Peripherally Acting Agents

Therapies for constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C)
Increasing the amount of dietary fiber is a simple, inexpensive option
in mild IBS-C and can be instituted as an early approach.
Limited randomized controlled studies seem to show some benefit in
global symptom relief with this approach, with a number needed to treat
of 6.3
Natural fiber sources (e.g., psyllium) or synthetic fiber (e.g.,
methylcellulose) are available.
In patients who complain of bloating or gas, fiber supplementation can
be associated with an increase in those symptoms and slow titration and
exclusion of flatulogenic foods should be encouraged.
Osmotic laxatives such as milk of magnesia, sorbitol, lactulose, or
polyethylene glycol may also be considered for patients with IBS-C.
Currently, there are no randomized controlled trial data to support their
use.3
These agents are generally safe for long-term use and are preferable to
stimulant laxatives.
Nonabsorbable carbohydrates such as lactulose and sorbitol can induce
bloating symptoms and are probably best avoided.
Lubiprostone (Amitiza) is a chloride channel activator indicated in the
treatment of IBS-C in women at a dose of 8 mcg twice daily.
Lubiprostone has shown benefit in reducing global IBS symptom scores.3
Side effects include nausea, diarrhea, and headache.
Women of childbearing age should have a negative pregnancy test
307

before starting lubiprostone therapy and should be capable of complying
with effective contraception while on this medication.
Tegaserod (Zelnorm) is a partial 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptor agonist
that exerts GI stimulatory effects and had been indicated for short-term
treatment of women with constipation-predominant symptoms.
In 2007, tegaserod was withdrawn from the market because of a small
but statistically significant increase in cardiovascular events in patients
taking it.
Therapies for diarrhea-predominant IBS (IBS-D)
The antidiarrheal loperamide (2 to 4 mg up to four times daily) is the
only agent with randomized controlled data supporting its use in IBS-D.
On the basis of its mechanism of action, diphenoxylate 2.5 mg with
atropine 0.025 mg (Lomotil, up to QID) may also be used.3
Suspension forms of these medications are available for patients who
need dose titrations.
Cholestyramine (Questran) and colesevelam (WelChol) can be
considered as an adjunct, or for early use when diarrheal symptoms
exacerbated by cholecystectomy.
Alosetron (Lotronex), a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor
antagonist, was approved for treatment of women with IBS-D.
Alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 2000 because of
a possible relationship with acute ischemic colitis and severe
constipation induced by this medication (1.1 and 0.66 cases per 1000
patient-years, respectively).
It was reapproved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for
chronic, severe IBS-D that has failed to respond to conventional therapy;
currently, its use requires a patient use agreement and prescriber
registration with the manufacturer.
Anticholinergic or “antispasmodic” agents often are used in all
classes of IBS, though probably are most useful in the setting of IBS-D.
Anticholinergic medications possess antidiarrheal properties via
decreases in intestinal transit and modulation of bowel secretory
function.
Hyoscyamine (Levsin) 0.125 to 0.25 mg orally or sublingual and
dicyclomine (Bentyl) 10 to 20 mg orally, up to three times a day.
Glycopyrrolate (Robinul) 1 to 2 mg two to three times a day and
methscopolamine (Pamine) 2.5 to 5 mg twice a day are also available
308

and have decreased CNS side effect potential.
These agents are most useful in patients with postprandial symptoms of
abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, or fecal urgency.
They should be prescribed to circumvent symptoms, such as before
meals.
These agents often become less effective with long-term use.
Limited data also exist, supporting the use of peppermint oil as an
antispasmodic agent.3,9
The use of antibiotic regimens in IBS recently has generated
considerable interest.
Gut-selective antibiotics such as rifaximin or neomycin have been
proposed for use in patients with IBS for whom bacterial overgrowth is
suspected, particularly in those with significant gas-bloat symptoms.
The results of two large, randomized, controlled studies recently
demonstrated a benefit in global and individual symptom scores using
rifaximin 550 mg three times daily for 2 weeks in non–IBS-C patients
(the number needed to treat around 11). These benefits persisted past
the period of time patients were on the drug.10
Emerging data support the use of probiotics in the management of IBS
symptoms.
All probiotics are not equally effective, however; the most benefit has
been shown with Bifidobacteria spp. and little to no benefit shown using
Lactobacillus spp.3
Centrally Acting Agents

Antidepressant medications are most useful in patients with chronic,
refractory symptoms.
They are particularly helpful with those who have concomitant psychiatric
and somatic complaints, although their efficacy is independent of any
direct influence on these comorbid conditions.
It is thought that antidepressants serve to interrupt or modulate the CNS
interpretation of peripheral gut signaling.
Patient perceptions and expectations should be adequately addressed in
using antidepressants in the management of IBS to optimize compliance.
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline,
imipramine, and desipramine, are the best studied agents.
They are used in doses much lower than those traditionally used in
309

depression management (starting dose, 10 to 25 mg at bedtime).
The anticholinergic properties of TCA may be beneficial in IBS-D but
should not dissuade use in patients with IBS-C.
Side effects can include sedation, dry mouth, urinary difficulties, sexual
dys-function, and dizziness.
Individuals experiencing such side effects may tolerate use of agents
with fewer anticholinergic effects such as desipramine.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors increasingly also are being
used in IBS and appear to be nearly as effective as TCAs.
Citalopram may be a good option because of its low side effect profile
and its effect on colonic tone and sensitivity.
Paroxetine may be useful in patients with IBS-D because of its
anticholinergic effect.
The SNRI venlafaxine has been shown to reduce colonic compliance and
relax the colon in healthy volunteers, an effect not seen with citalopram
or fluoxetine.3
Cognitive and Behavioral Therapy

Psychological and behavioral therapies, such as CBT, may be useful in
IBS management, particularly in patients who correlate an increase in
severity of symptoms with life stressors.
CBT has been demonstrated to be beneficial in IBS in randomized
controlled trials, particularly in its positive influence on global wellbeing.11,12
Although response is sporadic, factors favoring a good response include
high patient motivation, diarrhea or pain as the predominant symptom,
overt psychiatric symptoms, and intermittent pain exacerbated by stress.

Acute liver disease encompasses a wide range of disorders from
asymptomatic aminotransferase elevations to acute liver failure (ALF).
Viral hepatitis and drug-induced liver injury (DILI) are the most frequent
causes.
Histologic changes to the liver are typically those of acute inflammation
with varying degrees of necrosis and collapse of the liver’s architectural
framework. These features contrast with changes of cirrhosis and
development of portal hypertension that characterize the end stages of
chronic liver disease.

VIRAL HEPATITIS
Hepatotropic viruses include hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV),
hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis D (HDV), and hepatitis E (HEV).
Nonhepatotropic viruses known to cause liver injury include Epstein-Barr
virus, cytomegalovirus, herpes virus, measles, Ebola virus, and others.
Acute viral hepatitis is defined by the sudden onset of aminotransferase
elevation as a consequence of diffuse necroinflammatory liver injury.
Clinical presentation is widely variable and often nonspecific.
The condition may resolve or progress to ALF or chronic hepatitis.

HEPATITIS A VIRUS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

312

Hepatitis A is an enterically transmitted RNA virus that in unimmunized patients
often results in self-limited icteric hepatitis and rarely in fulminant hepatic failure.
Classification

HAV is an RNA virus within the Picornaviridae family.
Epidemiology

HAV is responsible for 30% of acute viral hepatitis in the United States.
Morbidity and mortality (case-fatality rate) of infection are determined by
age of onset.
In developing countries, infection in childhood is universal and typically
asymptomatic for those younger than 6 years.
Adults are more likely to be symptomatic with infection and at greater
risk for developing ALF.
Pathophysiology

HAV infection is usually transmitted enterically.
It is associated with unsanitary living conditions or improper foodhandling techniques.
The period of greatest infectivity is 2 weeks before onset of clinical
illness; fecal shedding continues for 2 to 3 weeks after onset of
symptoms.
Risk Factors

High-risk groups include people living in or traveling to developing
countries (food and water contamination), men having sex with men,
injection drugs users, patients with clotting factor disorders, persons
working with nonhuman primates, staff and attendees at daycare
centers, and patients with chronic liver disease (increased risk for
fulminant hepatitis A).
Prevention

Immunization programs are available (see Treatment section under
Hepatitis A Virus)

313

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis of acute HAV infection is made by the detection of anti-HAV
IgM antibodies in serum.
Aminotransferase elevations range from 10 to 100 times the upper
limits of the reference range (ULR).
Resolution of the illness is associated with emergence of anti-HAV IgG
antibodies, and this change provides the basis for distinguishing acute
from convalescent infection.
Clinical Presentation

HAV can be silent (subclinical), especially in children and young adults.
Symptoms vary from mild illness to ALF.1
Malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias,
arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever are common but
nonspecific symptoms.
History

History should include a review of symptoms, temporal course of illness,
and assessment for any potential exposures from traveling to developing
countries or food and water ingestion.
Physical Examination

Physical examination may reveal jaundice, hepatomegaly, and, in rare
cases, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, or a vascular rash.

TREATMENT
Treatment is supportive; however, careful attention should be paid to
identifying those at risk for ALF.
Liver transplantation may be an option for ALF.
Medications

Preexposure prophylaxis
314

Inactivated HAV vaccines (containing the single HAV antigen) and
combination vaccines (containing both HAV and hepatitis B antigens)
are available. Vaccinations should be administered intramuscularly into
the deltoid muscle in a two-dose regimen (single antigen HAV vaccine;
first dose at time zero and second dose at 6 to 18 months) or in a threedose regimen (combination vaccine; first dose at time zero, second dose
at 1 month, and third dose at 6 months).
Postexposure prophylaxis
Immune globulin (GamSTAN adult dose 0.02 mL/kg/dose) given within
14 days of exposure. Efficacy beyond 2 weeks after exposure has not
been established.
Immune globulin is not needed if at least one dose of the HAV vaccine
was administered >1 month prior to exposure.
Hepatitis A vaccine is not licensed for use as postexposure prophylaxis;
however, patients who have been administered one dose of vaccine at
>1 month prior to exposure do not need immune globulin.
In one study, treatment with HAV vaccine was shown to be noninferior
to postexposure prophylaxis with immune globulin, though slightly higher
rates of hepatitis A infection developed in those who received vaccine
only.
If HAV vaccine and immune globulin are recommended, they may be
administered simultaneously at separate injection sites.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Most symptoms of infection, including jaundice, resolve by 3 to 4 months.
Although there is no chronic phase of HAV infection, a polyphasic form of
the disease can occur associated with relapse of symptoms.
ALF is relatively rare, but risk increases with age: 0.1% in patients
younger than 15 years to >1% in patients older than 40 years.
HAV does not induce chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.

HEPATITIS B VIRUS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
315

HBV is a parenteral or sexually transmitted virus that is rarely associated with
fulminant hepatic failure but can develop into chronic infection with progression to
cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). At-risk
populations are protected by administration of recombinant vaccine that confers
hepatitis B surface antibody positivity.
Classification

HBV is a DNA virus in the Hepadnaviridae family.
Eight genotypes of HBV have been identified, designated A through H.
Epidemiology

Two billion people worldwide have serologic evidence of past or present
infection, and ~400 million people are chronic carriers.
Prevalence of HBV genotypes varies depending on the geographic
location. Genotypes A, B, and C are the most prevalent in the United
States.2
HBV is the indication for 5% to 10% of cases of liver transplantation.
Pathophysiology

Modes of transmission include
parenteral or percutaneous routes (e.g., injection drug use,
hemodyalisis, transfusions, needlestick injury);
sexual contact (e.g., men who have sex with men, intercourse with
HBV-infected partners); and
vertical or perinatal transmission (from mother to infant).
Risk Factors

High-risk groups include individuals with a history of multiple blood
transfusions, patients on hemodialysis, injection drug users, sexual
promiscuity, men having sex with men, household and heterosexual
contacts of hepatitis B carriers, residents and employees of residential
care facilities, travelers to endemic regions, and individuals born in areas
of high or intermediate prevalence.
Prevention

316

Immunization programs are available (see Treatment section under
Hepatitis B Virus)
Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations include polyarteritis nodosa,
glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia, serum sickness–like illness, and
aplastic anemia.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The period from exposure to symptoms ranges from 60 to 180 days.
Presentation can be subclinical, especially in children and young adults.
Symptoms vary from mild illness to ALF. Malaise, fatigue, pruritus,
headache, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting,
anorexia, and fever are common but nonspecific symptoms.
Progression to chronicity depends on age of acquisition.
Most acute HBV infections are self-limited in adults.
History

History should include a thorough investigation of risk factors.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis of HBV often requires the combination of data obtained from
liver chemistries, serology, and histology. With rare exceptions, the
diagnosis of hepatitis B is made by the presence of hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg)
Laboratories

Liver chemistries typically abnormal in acute hepatitis include
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
alkaline phosphatase (AP), and total bilirubin.
Tests that measure cholestasis [AP, γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and
total bilirubin] or liver synthetic function [albumin and prothrombin time
317

(PT)/international normalized ratio (INR)] may be abnormal according to
the disease stage.
HBV contains two genes (s and core) that produce antigens that elicit a
corresponding antibody response.
HBV antigens detected in serum and used for diagnostic purposes in
clinical practice include HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg).
HBV antibodies are specific to their corresponding antigen and include
Antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs), antibody against HBeAg (antiHBe), and IgM and IgG antibodies against HBcAg (IgM and IgG antiHBc).
HBV viral DNA (HBV DNA) is the most accurate marker of viral
replication. It is detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
most commonly expressed as international units per milliliter (IU/mL).
Genotypic determination is growing in clinical significance as data are
emerging with respect to response to antivirals, disease progression, and
risk of HCC.
The presence of HBsAg for >6 months separates chronic from acute HBV
infection.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is useful to assess the degree of necroinflammation and
fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis.

TREATMENT
Most cases of symptomatic, acute HBV infection in adults resolve with
the development of antibodies to the surface protein (anti-HBs), the
central neutralizing antibody to HBV. Thus, generally no role exists for
antiviral therapy with acute infection; however, case reports have
suggested a potential role for antiviral therapy in subjects who develop
signs that they may progress to ALF.
Medications

Seven agents are currently available for the treatment of HBV infection.
They are divided into three main groups:
interferon-based therapy (interferon α and pegylated interferon α),
318

nucleoside analogues (lamivudine, entecavir, and telbivudine), and
nucleotide analogues (adefovir and tenofovir).
These classes of medications are indicated for the treatment of chronic
HBV infection.
Of the oral agents, entecavir and tenofovir are the two agents with
the highest genetic barrier to resistance and therefore are preferred if
treatment of acute HBV infection is indicated.
Other Nonoperative Therapies

Preexposure prophylaxis
HBV vaccine should be considered for everyone, but particularly for
individuals at high risk (see risk factor section).
HBV vaccination schedule includes three intramuscular injections at 0, 1,
and 6 months in infants or healthy adults. Protective antibody response
is >90% after the third dose. Response to vaccination is measured by
anti-HBs ≥10 IU/mL.
Postexposure prophylaxis
Infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers should receive HBV vaccine
and hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), 0.5 mL, within 12 hours of birth
to prevent vertical transmission of the virus.
Susceptible sexual partners of individuals with HBV and those with
needle-stick injury should receive HBIG (0.04 to 0.07 mL/kg) and the
first dose of HBV vaccine at different sites preferably within 48 hours but
no >7 days after exposure. A second dose of HBIG can be administered
30 days after exposure, and the vaccination schedule should be
completed.
Surgical Management

Liver transplantation is indicated for patients with ALF secondary to HBV
infection.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Depending on the age at infection, people may have spontaneous
resolution or progression to chronicity.
Children younger than 5 years: 90% will develop chronic HBV infection.
319

Adults: 5% to 10% will develop chronic HBV.

HEPATITIS C VIRUS
HCV is a parentally transmitted virus that in the acute phase is not frequently
recognized; however, upon establishment of chronicity, it can lead to cirrhosis, endstage liver disease, and HCC. It is the most frequent indication for liver
transplantation in the United States, but it almost always recurs.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

HCV is an RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family.
Six HCV genotypes are recognized worldwide with >60 subtypes.
Epidemiology

HCV is a global health problem, wit ~180 million carriers worldwide. 3
Pathophysiology

HCV infection occurs primarily through exposure from infected blood (see
risk factors section).
Modes of transmission include
parenteral (e.g., transfusion, injection drug use, body piercing,
needlestick injury);
sexual transmission, especially associated with high-risk sexual
practices, and from mother to offspring (vertical transmission), although
at a much lower frequency than HBV infection.
Risk Factors

Risk factors for HCV infection include a history of multiple blood
transfusions or clotting factors before the institution of screening in 1992,
hemodialysis, injection drug use, multiple sexual partners, and
occupational exposure with blood and blood-derived products.
320

Prevention

No preexposure prophylaxis or vaccine exists. Prevention of high-risk
behavior should be emphasized.
Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations include essential mixed (type II)
cryoglobulinemia, glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda,
cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, lichen planus, and marginal zone
lymphoma.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Incubation period for HCV infection varies from 15 to 150 days.
Acute HCV infection is typically subclinical.
Symptoms vary from mild illness to ALF.
Malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias,
arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever are common but
nonspecific symptoms.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV) may be undetectable for the first
8 weeks after infection.
A false-positive test (anti-HCV positive with HCV RNA negative) may
occur in the setting of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) or
hypergammaglobulinemia. A false-negative (anti-HCV negative with HCV
RNA positive) test may occur in immunosuppressed individuals or in
patients on hemodialysis.
HCV RNA can be detected by PCR in serum as early as 1 to 2 weeks
after infection (qualitative and quantitative assays). It is expressed in
IU/mL.
HCV genotypes can be detected by commercially available assays. HCV

geno-type influences the duration, dosage, and response to treatment.
Liver biopsy is useful to score the degree of necroinflammation and
fibrosis in the liver of chronically infected patients.

TREATMENT

Medications

Treatment is strongly indicated in acute HCV infection.
Treatment of acute HCV infection is associated with sustained virologic
remission rates of 70% to 95%. This is in contrast to 80% rate of chronic
infection that occurs following infection.
Treatment strategies are similar to chronic HCV infection (see Chapter 19
for full details)
A combination of pegylated interferon αand ribavirin is used.
Specifically targeted antiviral therapies and newer antiviral agents are in
development.
Surgical Management

Liver transplantation may be indicated in end-stage liver disease because
of chronic HCV infection; disease recurrence is frequent and progression
is rapid.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
The progression of fibrosis determines prognosis and the need and
urgency of therapy.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Acute hepatitis is frequently clinically silent.
Chronic infection occurs in 80% of those exposed to HCV.
In those with chronic infection, 20% to 30% may develop cirrhosis over a
period that can span as long as two to three decades.
322

HEPATITIS D VIRUS

GENERAL PRINCILES
Hepatitis D is a subviral particle that requires the hepatitis B virus for
infectivity.
Classification

Hepatitis D virus (HDV) is considered a subviral particle with a circular
RNA genome and is the only member of the genus Deltavirus.4
Epidemiology

HDV is endemic to the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East, and
portions of South America.
Outside endemic areas, infections occur primarily either in individuals
who have received transfusions or in injection drug users.
HDV requires the presence of HBV for infection and replication.
Pathophysiology

HDV infection clinically presents as a coinfection (acute hepatitis B and
D), superinfection (chronic hepatitis B with acute hepatitis D), or as a
latent infection (e.g., in the setting of liver transplantation).
Risk Factors

High-risk groups are similar to HBV (see HBV Epidemiology section).
Prevention

Although there is no vaccine to prevent HDV infection in carriers of HBV,
both infections can be prevented by HBV vaccination.

DIAGNOSIS

323

Clinical Presentation

In patients with coinfection, the course is transient and self-limited.
The rate of progression to chronicity is similar to that reported for acute
HBV infection.
In superinfection, HBV carriers may present with a severe acute
hepatitis exacerbation with frequent progression to chronic HDV
infection.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Diagnosis is made by finding HDV RNA or HDV antigen in serum or
liver and by detecting antibody to the HDV antigen.

TREATMENT

Medications

Interferon α–based therapy is the treatment of choice for chronic
hepatitis D.

HEPATITIS E VIRUS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hepatitis E is an enterically transmitted RNA virus that leads to acute hepatitis
in special populations including pregnant women and immunosuppressed solidorgan transplant patients.
Classification

Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is an RNA virus belonging to the Hepeviridae
family.
324

Epidemiology

HEV is implicated in epidemics in India, Southeast Asia, Africa, and
Mexico.
Hepatitis E is considered a zoonotic disease and reservoirs include pigs
and potentially other species.5
Pathophysiology

Transmission is through the fecal-oral route and resembles that of HAV
infection.
Prevention

No approved pre- or postexposure prophylaxis exists.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Acute hepatitis E is clinically indistinguishable from other acute viral
hepatitis.
A high fatality rate is seen in pregnant women in the second and
third trimesters.

TREATMENT
Treatment is supportive.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Although generally considered an acute illness, chronic HEV infection has
been detected in immunosuppressed organ transplant patients.

HERPES SIMPLEX VIRUS HEPATITIS
325

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) rarely causes hepatitis; however, liver involvement
in immunosuppressed or pregnant women can cause severe anicteric hepatitis
leading to fulminant hepatic failure prompting consideration of empiric treatment
while the diagnosis is being established.
Classification

Infection with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can lead to visceral dissemination
and hepatitis.
Epidemiology

Commonly acquired infection, with 62% of adolescents testing positive
for HSV-1 and 12% for HSV-2.
Hepatitis is an uncommon manifestation of HSV.
Usually occurs in neonates or malnourished children; rare in adults.
Most adult patients are immunocompromised (most often deficiency of
cell-mediated immunity) or pregnant, but HSV hepatitis has been
described in immunocompetent patients.
Pathophysiology

Large HSV inoculum at the time of initial infection may result in
dissemination.
Activation of latent infection may occur.
HSV strains have affinity to the liver (“hepatovirulent”).
Risk Factors

High-risk groups include neonates, pregnant women (primarily in the
third trimester), and those who are immunosuppressed.6

DIAGNOSIS

326

Diagnosis of acute HSV infection may be made by serologic tests;
however, if index of suspicion is high, it is reasonable to initiate
treatment.
Aminotransferase elevations range from 10 to 100 times the ULR.
These elevations may be out of proportion to the degree of jaundice;
thus, HSV hepatitis is often considered anicteric hepatitis.
Clinical Presentation

Symptoms vary from mild illness to ALF.
Malaise, fatigue, pruritus, headache, abdominal pain, myalgias,
arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, and fever are common but
nonspecific symptoms.
History

History should include a review of symptoms, temporal course of illness,
and any potential HSV exposures.
Physical Examination

Hepatosplenomagaly. Jaundice is uncommon.
Oral mucocutaneous lesions in HSV infection are found in 40% to 50% of
cases.

TREATMENT
Treatment is with intravenous (IV) acyclovir, it can be initiated
presumptively if there is any degree of clinical suspicion.
Liver transplantation may be an option for ALF.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Cases may rapidly progress to fulminant hepatic failure; however, prompt
administration of parenteral antiviral therapy may result in complete
resolution of liver dysfunction.

ACETAMINOPHEN
327

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
When ingested at toxic levels, acetaminophen (APAP) and its metabolites may
lead to hepatocellular damage and fulminant hepatic failure. Recognition of potential
toxic ingestions allows for prompt administration of its antidote N -acetylcysteine
(NAC), which may prevent progression to fulminant hepatic failure.
Epidemiology

APAP toxicity is the most common cause of toxic medication-related
ingestion in the United States.
It is most frequently a consequence of intentional ingestion; however,
unintentional overdoses do occur and can result in severe liver injury.
APAP is a safe and generally well-tolerated analgesic medication.7
Pathophysiology

Significant hepatic injury generally requires ingestions above a threshold
value of 150 mg/kg body weight.
APAP can be metabolized to a toxic metabolite [N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone
imine (NAPQI)], which can induce toxic free radical damage to liver
parenchymal cells.
Chronic, excessive alcohol use may predispose to liver injury, although
only with overdoses of APAP.

DIAGNOSIS
Made with measurement of APAP level in the serum.
History is critical to assess time of ingestion, as well as concurrent
substances ingested, which effects treatment (see later).

TREATMENT

Medications

328

Antidote to treatment, NAC administered within 8 hours of ingestion,
is indicated in those with APAP levels above the “possible” toxicity line
on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram (line connecting 150 μg/mL at 4
hours with 50 μg/mL at 12 hours) (Fig. 18-1)
NAC can be given orally (loading dose of 140 mg/kg followed by 70
mg/kg every 4 hours for a total of 17 doses) or intravenously (loading
dose 150 mg/ kg over 1 hour followed by 14 mg/kg/hour for 4 hours and
then 7 mg/kg/ hour for 16 hours).
For ingestions that present late (>8 hours), a longer duration of IV
treatment is recommended (loading dose, 140 mg/kg IV over 1 hour
followed by 14 mg/ kg/hour for 44 hours).
Hypophosphatemia is a frequent finding in APAP-related liver injury.
Serum phosphorous levels should be monitored and treated if low.
Surgical Management

Liver transplantation can be considered in patients with ALF secondary to
APAP.

PROGNOSIS/OUTCOME
In addition to APAP’s effects on the liver, acute renal failure can occur
independently of hepatic injury.
Prognosis is excellent with timely recognition and administration of NAC;
however, complications from ALF can occur (see ALF section).

329

FIGURE 18-1. Acetaminophen toxicity nomogram. The area below the
dashed line represents nontoxic ingestion. The area between the two lines is
potentially toxic, and the area above the solid line is likely to be toxic. Treatment
should be initiated for any level above the dashed line. (Adapted from Rumack BH,
Matthews H. Acetaminophen poisoning. Pediatrics. 1975;55:871–866, with

DRUG-INDUCED LIVER INJURY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
330

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a common cause of acute liver disease.
Prognosis often depends upon the dose-dependent or idiosyncratic effect
of the specific offending agent.
Classification

Three major patterns of DILI occur as a result of both dose-dependent
and idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity:
Hepatocellular
Cholestatic
Mixed hepatocellular and cholestatic injury
Less common forms of DILI include granulomatous hepatitis and
carcinogenesis.
Epidemiology

DILI causes ~50% of the cases of ALF in the United States, with APAP
the most common agent.
Pathophysiology

Intrinsic hepatotoxicity results from usually predictable and dosedependent hepatotoxic effects of the drug or its metabolite.9
Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity can be divided into hypersensitivity
(allergic) and metabolic (nonallergic) reactions. These reactions depend
on multiple variables and are not predictable.
Hypersensitivity responses occur as a result of stimulation of the
immune system by a metabolite of a drug alone or after haptenization
(covalently binding) to a liver protein. Repeated challenge with the same
agent leads to prompt recurrence of the reaction.
Metabolic hepatotoxicity occurs in susceptible patients as a result of
altered drug clearance or accelerated production of hepatotoxic
metabolites. The latency of this reaction is variable.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

331

Acute presentation can be clinically silent. When symptoms are present,
they are nonspecific and include nausea/vomiting, general malaise,
fatigue, and abdominal pain.
In the acute setting, the majority of patients will recover after cessation
of the offending drug.
Fever, rash, and eosinophilia may also be seen in association with
hypersensitivity reactions.
Diagnostic Criteria

No diagnostic criteria are established, but diagnosis requires clinical
suspicion, temporal relation of liver injury to drug usage, and resolution
of liver injury after the suspected agent has been discontinued.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Biochemical abnormalities include the following:
Hepatocellular injury: AST and ALT elevation more than two times
the upper limit of normal
Cholestatic injury: AP and conjugated bilirubin elevation more than
two times upper limit of normal
Mixed injury: Increases in all of these biochemical abnormalities to
more than two times upper limit of normal
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy can be useful as part of the diagnostic workup.

TREATMENT
Treatment includes cessation of offending drug and supportive
measures.
An attempt to remove the agent from the GI tract should be made
in most cases of acute toxic ingestion, using lavage or cathartics.
Surgical Management

332

Liver transplantation may be an option for patients with ALF.
Outcome/Prognosis

Prognosis of DILI if often unique to the offending medication.
It is important to be attuned to the development of jaundice because this
sign is associated with case fatality rates of 10% to 50%.9

ISCHEMIC HEPATITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Ischemic hepatitis is characterized by a transient and often dramatic rise in
amino-transferases that results from cardiovascular collapse.
Definition

Ischemic hepatitis (“shock liver”) results from liver hypoperfusion.
Etiology

Clinical scenarios associated include severe blood loss, cardiac failure,
heat stroke, sepsis, and sickle cell crisis.11

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

Ischemic hepatitis presents as acute and transient rise of liver enzymes
to levels as high as >20 times the upper limit of normal range during or
following a hypotensive episode.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

333

Laboratory studies demonstrate a rapid rise and fall in levels of serum
AST, ALT (>1000 mg/dL), and lactic dehydrogenase within 1 to 3 days of
the insult, with subsequent slow decline in aminotransferases if the
underlying cause is corrected.
Total bilirubin, AP, and INR may initially be normal but subsequently rise
even as the levels of aminotransferases improve.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is not usually needed for diagnosis.
Centrilobular necrosis and sinusoidal distortion with inflammatory
infiltrates in zone 3 (central areas) are classic histologic features.

TREATMENT
Correction of the underlying condition that caused circulatory collapse.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Prognosis is determined by the rapid and effective correction of
hemodynamics or treatment of the underlying cause.

BUDD-CHIARI SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Budd-Chiari syndrome is characterized as hepatic venous outflow obstruction
most often resulting from thrombosis, which can lead to an acute or subacute illness
characterized by ascites, hepatomegaly, and jaundice. Treatment is centered on
decompression of the portal system.
Definition

Hepatic vein thrombosis (HVT; also known as Budd-Chiari
syndrome) causes hepatic venous outflow obstruction. It has multiple
334

etiologies and a variety of clinical consequences.
Etiology

Thrombosis is the main factor leading to obstruction of the hepatic
venous system, frequently in association with myeloproliferative
disorders (polycythemia rubra vera) or hypercoagulable states (e.g.,
antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, paroxysmal nocturnal
hemoglobinuria, factor V Leiden, protein C and S deficiency, and
contraceptive use).
HVT can occur during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.
Less than 20% of cases are idiopathic.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients may present with acute, subacute, or chronic illness
characterized by ascites, hepatomegaly, and right upper quadrant
abdominal pain.
Jaundice, encephalopathy, and lower extremity edema are variably
present.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Serum to ascites albumin gradient is >1.1 g/dL. Serum albumin, bilirubin,
AST, ALT, and PT/INR are mildly abnormal.
Laboratory evaluation to identify a potential hypercoagulable state or
myeloproliferative disorder should be performed.
Imaging

Doppler ultrasound can be used as a screening test and can demonstrate
the absence of flow in hepatic veins.
Definitive diagnosis is made with hepatic venography.

335

TREATMENT

Medications

Nonsurgical treatment includes anticoagulation, thrombolytics, diuretics,
angioplasty, stents, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS).12 These agents work best in subjects without decompensated
cirrhosis.
Surgical Management

Both surgical shunts and liver transplantation have been used as
therapeutic options.

WILSON’S DISEASE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Wilson’s disease is a genetic disorder in which ineffective excretion of copper
results in hepatocellular damage; its presentations include fulminant hepatic failure,
and progression of disease may lead to cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease.
Definition

Wilson’s disease is an autosomal-recessive disorder (ATP7B gene on
chromo-some 13) that results in progressive copper overload.
Epidemiology

Incidence is 1 in 30,000; female to male ratio of 2:1.
Pathophysiology

Absent or reduced function of ATP7B protein leads to decreased
hepatocellular excretion of copper into bile, resulting in hepatic copper
accumulation and injury.
336

Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations include Kayser-Fleischer rings on slitlamp examination (gold to brown rings due to copper deposition in the
Descemet membrane in the periphery of the cornea), Coombs-negative
hemolytic anemia, renal tubular acidosis, arthritis, and osteopenia. 13

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Liver disease can be highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic with
only biochemical abnormalities to ALF.
The diagnosis of acute Wilson’s disease should be considered in patients
with unexplained liver disease with or without neuropsychiatric
symptoms, first-degree relatives with Wilson’s disease, or individuals
with fulminant hepatic failure (with or without hemolysis).
The average age at presentation of liver disease is 6 to 20 years, but it
can manifest later in life.
Neuropsychiatric disorders usually occur later, most of the time in
association with cirrhosis. The manifestations include asymmetric
tremor, dysarthria, ataxia, and psychiatric features.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Low serum ceruloplasmin level (20 mg/dL), elevated serum free
copper level (>25 mcg/dL), and elevated 24-hour urinary copper
level (>100 mg).
Most patients with the ALF presentation of Wilson’s disease have a
characteristic pattern of findings including: Coombs-negative hemolytic
anemia with features of acute intravascular hemolysis; rapid progression
to renal failure; modest rise in serum aminotransferases (typically 2000
IU/L) from the beginning of clinical illness; normal or subnormal serum
AP (typically 40 IU/L).
Diagnostic Procedures

337

Liver biopsy
The liver histology (massive necrosis, steatosis, glycogenated nuclei,
chronic hepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis) findings are nonspecific and depend
on the presentation and stage of the disease.
Elevated hepatic copper levels of >250 mcg/g dry weight (normal 40
mcg/g) on biopsy are highly suggestive of Wilson’s disease.

TREATMENT

Medications

Treatment is with copper-chelating agents.
Penicillamine 1 to 2 g/day (in divided doses BID or QID) plus
pyridoxine 25 mg/day. Indicated in patients with hepatic failure. Use
may be limited by side effects (hypersensitivity, bone marrow
suppression, and proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, and
Goodpasture syndrome). Penicillamine should not be given as initial
treatment to patients with neurologic symptoms.
Trientine 1 to 2 g/day (in divided doses BID or QID). This has similar
side effects as penicillamine but at a lower frequency. The risk of
neurologic worsening with trientine is less than with penicillamine.
Surgical Management

Liver transplantation is the only therapeutic option in ALF or in
progressive dysfunction despite chelation.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
In the absence of neurologic symptoms, liver transplantation has a good
prognosis and requires no further medical treatment.

Acute Liver Failure

338

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
ALF is the relatively rapid development of coagulopathy and encephalopathy in
the absence of preexisting liver disease; its etiologies are diverse and intensive
monitoring is critical, as is timely referral for the evaluation of liver transplantation.
Definition

ALF is a rare condition that includes evidence of coagulation
abnormalities (usually an INR >1.5) and any degree of mental alteration
(encephalopathy) in a patient without preexisting cirrhosis and with an
illness of 26 weeks’ duration.
Classification

Terms used signifying length of illness in ALF such as hyperacute (7
days), acute (7 to 21 days), and subacute (>21 days to 26 weeks) are
generally considered unhelpful, as they do not have prognostic
significance distinct from the cause of illness. 14
Epidemiology

Approximately 2000 cases of ALF occur in the United States yearly.
Etiology

APAP hepatotoxicity and viral hepatitis are the most common causes of
ALF. 15
Other causes include AIH, drug and toxin exposure, ischemia, acute fatty
liver of pregnancy, Wilson’s disease, and hepatitis B infection.
In 20% of cases, no clear cause is identified.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients may present with mild to severe mental status changes in the
339

setting of moderate to severe acute hepatitis and coagulopathy.
Jaundice may or may not be initially present.
A history of APAP overdose, toxin ingestion, or risk factors for viral
hepatitis may be obtained.
Cardiovascular collapse, acute renal failure, cerebral edema, and sepsis
may be part of the clinical presentation.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Aminotransferases are typically elevated and in many cases are
>1000 IU/L.
INR is ≥ 1.5.
Initial workup to determine the etiology of ALF should include
acute viral hepatitis panel;
serum drug screen, which includes APAP;
ceruloplasmin;
AIH serologies; and
pregnancy test.
Imaging

Right upper quadrant Doppler ultrasound may be used to evaluate
for obstruction of venous inflow or outflow.
Computed tomographic scan of the head may be obtained to
evaluate and track progression of cerebral edema; however, the
radiologic findings may lag behind the development of cerebral edema.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is seldom used to establish etiology or prognosis. Given the
presence of coagulopathy, a transjugular biopsy is the preferred
approach.

TREATMENT
Supportive therapy in the intensive care unit at a center
experienced with liver disease and liver transplantation is essential.
340

Precipitating factors should be identified and treated if possible.
Sedation should be avoided to allow for serial assessments of
mental/neurologic status.
Blood glucose, electrolytes, acid–base, coagulation parameters, and fluid
status should be monitored serially.
The coagulopathy of ALF need only to be corrected in the setting of
active bleeding or when invasive procedures are required.
Cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension are related to
severity of encephalopathy (Table 18-1). In patients who reach grade III
or IV encephalopathy, intracranial pressure monitoring should be
considered (intracranial pressure should be maintained below 20 to 25
mm Hg, cerebral perfusion pressure should be maintained above 50 mm
Hg). Therapies to decrease cerebral edema include mannitol (0.5 to 1
g/kg IV), hyperventilation (reduce Paco2 to 25 to 30 mm Hg),
hypothermia (32°C to 34°C), and barbiturates.
Lactulose is not indicated for encephalopathy. Its use may result in
increased bowel distention, which may complicate liver transplantation.
Liver transplantation is the ultimate therapy for those with ALF
(see Chapter 21). Several criteria have been proposed to identify those
unlikely to recover spontaneously and in whom liver transplantation
would be lifesaving. The King’s College criteria are most commonly used
(Table 18-2).
In the United States, patients with ALF are eligible to be listed for
transplantation with the highest priority status.

341

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Prior to transplantation, survival was 15%; in the posttransplant era,
survival is >65%.
Death often results from progressive liver failure, GI bleeding, cerebral
edema, sepsis, or arrhythmia.
Poor prognostic indicators in APAP-induced ALF include arterial pH 7.3,
INR>6.5, creatinine >2.3 mg/dL, and encephalopathy grades III to IV.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition
Chronic viral hepatitis is defined by the persistence of viral infection for
longer than 6 months, resulting in liver necroinflammatory and fibrotic
changes which can lead to cirrhosis.
Histopathologic classification of chronic liver disease is based on etiology,
grade, and stage; grade represents the severity of necroinflammatory
changes and stage represents the severity of fibrosis.

Classification
The two most frequent viruses that result in chronic hepatitis are the
hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses. The hepatitis D virus (HDV) is an
infrequent etiology of chronic hepatitis in the United States. In rare
occasions, and when associated with liver transplantation, the hepatitis E
virus can also cause chronic hepatitis.

CHRONIC HEPATITIS B

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
344

Epidemiology

There are about 2 billion people worldwide infected with HBV and about
350 to 400 million chronic carriers with measurable hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg).
Acute infection can lead to chronic hepatitis B in 90% of newborns of
hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive mothers, 25% of infants/children,
and 5% to 10% of adults.1
Approximately 0.5% of chronic HBsAg carriers will clear this antigen
yearly: 8% to 12% of chronic HBeAg-positive carriers will clear HBeAg.
Spontaneous HBeAg clearance is affected by age, baseline alanine–
aminotransferase (ALT) levels, and HBV genotype.
Patients with chronic HBV have 1% per annum risk of developing
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with or without development of cirrhosis.

Etiology
HBV is a DNA virus and belongs to the Hepadnavirus family.
In endemic regions, such as Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, hepatitis B
infection is frequently transmitted from mother to child (vertical
transmission), whereas in Western countries, where chronic hepatitis B is
relatively rare, infection is transmitted from adult to adult (horizontal
transmission).
Infection is acquired through sexual contact, parenteral routes
(e.g., needle stick, injection drug use, and blood transfusions), or
perinatal transmission.

Natural History
Chronic carriers are defined by HBsAg positivity for longer than 6
months.
The four clinical phases of chronic hepatitis B infection consist of the
immune-tolerant phase, immune active or immune clearance
phase, inactive phase, and “resolution phase.” These are explained
345

under “Interpretation of Laboratory Tests,” on page 225.
Patients with hepatitis B can have a fluctuating disease course and may
progress from one stage to another.

Risk Factors
High-risk groups for chronic hepatitis B infection include
individuals with a history of homosexual or heterosexual promiscuity,
intravenous (IV) drug users, patients on hemodialysis (HD), health care
workers, children of HBeAg-positive mothers, recipients of multiple blood
transfusions, residents and employees of residential care facilities,
travelers to endemic areas, and natives of Alaska, Asia, or the Pacific
Islands.
Risk factors for developing HCC include family history of HCC, age
more than 40 years, male sex, high viral replication, coinfection (i.e.,
HIV, HCV, HDV), aflatoxin exposure, and alcohol use.

Prevention
Screening is recommended for people born in high or intermediate
endemic areas, unvaccinated US-born adults whose parents are from
countries with high or intermediate HBV prevalence, patients with
chronically elevated liver function tests, those receiving
immunosuppression or chemotherapy, men with active homosexual
partners, history of sexually transmitted diseases, history of sexual
promiscuity, prison inmates, IV drug users, patients on HD, HIV/HCV
patients, pregnant women, and household and sexual contacts of
patients with HBV infection.
Preexposure prophylaxis with HBV vaccine should be considered
for everyone, but particularly for individuals with a history of multiple
blood transfusions, patients on HD, health care workers, injection drug
users, household and heterosexual contacts of hepatitis B carriers, men
with active homosexual partners, residents and employees of residential
care facilities, travelers to hyperendemic areas, persons born in
intermediate and high endemic areas, patients receiving long-term
immunosuppression or chemotherapy, and natives of Alaska, Asia, and
346

the Pacific Islands.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends universal
vaccination programs for infants and sexually active adolescents in the
United States.
Vaccination is administered as a three-shot series at 0, 1, and 6 months.
For patients who require rapid immunity, vaccination can be
administered at 0, 1, and 2 months with a follow-up booster shot at 6
months for long-lasting immunity.
Additional doses, higher doses, and alternative vaccine routes can be
considered in nonresponders and hyporesponders (antihepatitis B surface
antibody [anti-HBs] 10 IU/mL) to elicit protective anti-HBs levels and
long-lasting immunity.
Booster doses may be needed in immunocompromised individuals in
whom anti-HBs levels fall below 10 IU/mL on annual testing.
Postexposure prophylaxis
It should be considered in infants born to HBsAg-positive mothers.
Newborns should receive HBV vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin
(HBIG) within 12 hours of birth. This strategy has been shown to be 95%
efficacious in preventing vertical transmission of HBV; efficacy may be
lower in mothers with high viral load (VL).
Susceptible sexual partners of HBV-infected individuals and individuals
with HBV-contaminated needle-stick injuries should receive HBIG
followed by the first dose of HBV vaccine at different body sites as soon
as possible. A second dose of HBIG should be administered at 30 days
postexposure and the vaccine series should be completed.
Those who remain susceptible to HBV infection, including health care
workers, patients on dialysis, and sexual partners of carriers should be
tested for vaccination response 1 to 2 months after the last dose of the
vaccine.
In HBV seronegative patients receiving antihepatitis B core antibodypositive liver transplants, lifelong antiviral therapy is indicated.
All chronic HBV patients should receive two doses of hepatitis A virus
(HAV) vaccine 6 to 12 months apart if not immune to HAV.

Associated Conditions
Patients with chronic hepatitis B (about 10% to 15% of patients) may
347

develop immune-mediated extrahepatic manifestations, including
polyarteritis nodosa, glomerulonephritis, cryoglobulinemia vasculitis,
serum sickness-like illness, papular acrodermatitis (predominantly in
children), and aplastic anemia.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Chronic hepatitis B usually progresses with nonspecific symptoms until
complications develop from cirrhosis or HCC.
History

This should include details about place of birth, family history of HBV
infection and liver cancer, personal history of smoking, ETOH use,
tattooing, IV drug abuse, drug transfusions, sexual habits, travel to
endemic countries, and employment.
The clinical presentation of chronic viral hepatitis varies significantly from
asymptomatic to manifestations of advanced liver disease. Frequently,
patients manifest vague symptoms like malaise, fatigue and
weakness, abdominal pain, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, and
anorexia.
Physical Examination

Physical examination findings of chronic viral hepatitis vary according to
the stage of the disease at diagnosis. In early phases, the patient may
not show physical examination abnormalities.
Physical examination findings of cirrhosis include jaundice, parotid
gland enlargement, gynecomastia, ascites, abdominal collateral
circulation, peripheral edema, telangiectasia, muscle wasting, palmar
erythema, and mental status abnormalities; these findings are not
specific to any particular liver disease etiology.
Diagnostic Criteria

Chronic hepatitis B infection is generally defined by the following
characteristics:
348

HBsAg positive for more than 6 months
Presence or absence of HBeAg
Elevated levels of serum HBV DNA (levels vary depending on the phase
of the infection)
Persistent or intermittent elevation in ALT or aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) levels
Liver biopsy showing chronic hepatitis with different degrees of
inflammation and fibrosis
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B is based on the detection of
antigens/antibodies of the HBV and HBV DNA. Additional testing includes
routine liver chemistry, HBV genotype (soon to become a routine test),
and liver biopsy when indicated.
Laboratory Testing

Patients with chronic HBV infection are evaluated for the presence or absence of
markers of infection, as follows:
Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) is detectable in serum or
hepatocyte cytoplasm (immunoperoxidase staining) in acute or chronic
HBV infection.
This disappears if the virus is cleared. The persistence of HBsAg is the
diagnostic hallmark of chronic HBV infection.
Antibody against HBsAg (anti-HBs) appears after the disappearance
of HBsAg and after vaccination. The presence of anti-HBs demonstrates
clearance or immunity to the disease.
Hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) is not detectable in serum but can
be found in the hepatocyte nuclei by immunoperoxidase staining during
active viral replication.
IgM antibody against HBcAg (anti-HBc IgM) is present during
acute infection and in periods of high viral replication in chronic disease
(flares).
IgG antibody against HBcAg (anti-HBc IgG) is usually present in
patients with chronic disease and in conjunction with anti-HBs in patients
who cleared the disease. In some cases, patients with isolated IgG antiHBc can reactivate the HBV infection after immunosuppression or
chemotherapy.
349

Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) appears in the serum shortly after
HBsAg. This is indicative of active viral replication and high infectivity.
Patients harboring HBV infection with precore or basal core promoter
mutations cannot synthesize or secrete this antigen (HBeAg negative)
despite high viral replication.
Antibody against HBeAg (anti-HBe) usually indicates low-level
replication and lower degree of infectivity. The best-known exception is
the patient infected with precore or basal core promoter mutations
(HBeAg negative but anti-HBe positive).
HBV DNA is the most accurate and sensitive marker of viral
replication. It is detected by polymerase chain reaction and reported as
international units per milliliter (IU/mL).
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is useful in determining the degree of inflammation
(grade) and fibrosis (stage) in patients with chronic hepatitis B.
Interpretation of Laboratory Tests (Table 19-1)

Patients with chronic HBV infection may progress through four clinical phases.
Immune tolerant phase. It is generally seen in patients with
perinatally acquired infection. Patients generally have subclinical or mild
disease and normal ALT levels. HBV is actively replicating (>1,000,000
IU/mL). HBeAg is present. The liver biopsy is generally normal or with
mild inflammatory changes. Some of these patients may develop active
liver disease later in life.
Immune active or immune clearance phase. It is characterized by
elevated HBV DNA levels (>20,000 IU/mL), positive (wild type) or
negative (pre-core mutation or basic core promoter mutation) HBeAg,
elevated liver enzymes, and abnormal biopsy with different degrees of
inflammation and fibrosis.
Inactive phase. These patients have few or no symptoms. There is low
replica-tive activity with low HBV DNA levels (2000 IU/mL), negative
HBeAg, and normal liver enzymes. The liver biopsy shows mild or no
inflammation and different degrees of fibrosis. Inactive carriers may flare
to active replication even after years of quiescent disease.
Resolution phase. These patients have no symptoms of liver disease.
It is characterized by loss of HBsAg and seroconversion to anti-HBs. HBV
350

DNA falls and eventually disappears and liver enzymes normalize. Liver
histology may return to normal. These patients develop permanent
immunity (anti-HBs, anti-HBc).

Additional Tests

Genotype determination of HBV has growing clinical significance and
is becoming a standard marker in clinical practice.
Patients with genotypes A and B are more likely to have spontaneous
HBeAg seroconversion at an earlier age, have slower progression to
cirrhosis, have less hepatic inflammation, and are more responsive to
interferon treatment.

TREATMENT

351

Goals

Treatment of chronic HBV infection has the following goals: clearance/
suppression of HBV DNA, HBeAg and HBsAg seroconversion,
normalization of serum ALT, and normalization of liver histology.
Indication

Treatment is indicated for patients with decompensated cirrhosis despite
low HBV-DNA levels (2000 IU/mL), compensated cirrhosis with HBV DNA
VL >2000 IU/mL, HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative patients with high
HBV DNA (VL >20,000 IU/mL and >2000 IU/mL, respectively), and ALT
more than two times the upper limit of normal (ULN).2
Patients with mildly elevated ALT levels (less than double the ULN) or
persistently elevated DNA levels should be evaluated for possible
treatment on a case-by-case basis. Liver biopsy evaluation of
necroinflammatory changes and fibrosis may help determine treatment.
Patients with moderate or severe inflammation or significant fibrosis may
benefit from treatment.
Medications

Current treatment options include pegylated interferon alpha therapy (pIFNα),
nucleoside, and nucleotide analogs (Table 19-2).
First-Line Treatments

Interferon therapy
Interferons are glycoproteins with antiviral, immunomodulatory, and
antiproliferative actions. The addition of polyethylene glycol to the
standard IFN (α2a or α2b) molecule results in prolonged half-life with
improved bioavailability.
pIFNα is administered as weekly subcutaneous injections. No antiviralresistance mutations are induced by IFN.
Interferon therapy is contraindicated in patients with decompensated
liver disease. Side effects include flu-like syndrome (headache, fatigue,
myalgias, arthralgias, fever, and chills), neuropsychiatric symptoms
(depression, irritability, and concentration impairment), reversible bone
marrow suppression, and other effects (alopecia, thyroiditis, and
injection-site reactions).
352

Nucleoside and nucleotide analogs
Nucleoside or nucleotide analogs are orally administered agents that are
better tolerated than IFN therapy; the major concern for long-term use
of these agents is the selection of antiviral-resistant mutations.
First-line agents are tenofovir and entecavir. These analogs have robust
anti-viral activity and are associated with lower rates of drug resistance
mutations. Both should be dose-adjusted in patients with renal disease.

Tenofovir
Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is a nucleotide analog that effectively
suppresses HBV DNA in HBeAg-positive, HBeAg-negative, cirrhotic
(decompensated and compensated), and lamivudine/adefovir-resistant
patients. HBV DNA suppression was defined as VL 400 copies/mL. HBV
suppression occurred in 96% to 99% of HBeAg-positive patients and in
99% of HBeAg-negative patients after 192 weeks of tenofovir therapy. In
lamivudine-resistant HBeAg-positive patients, the efficacy was 98% after
96 weeks of treatment. In a recent study with patients with
decompensated cirrhosis, 71% of patients suppressed HBV DNA after 48
weeks of tenofovir therapy.3 HBsAg loss in HBeAg-positive and HBeAgnegative patients was 10% (192 weeks of treatment) and 7% (96 weeks
of treatment), respectively.4
The daily dose is 300 mg. Tenofovir has an excellent safety profile.
Resistance mutations are not yet known through 4 years of therapy.
Entecavir
353

Entecavir is a nucleoside analog that effectively suppresses HBV DNA in
HBeAg-positive, HBeAg-negative, and cirrhotic (decompensated and
compensated) patients, but its use is associated with high rates of failure
in lamivudine-resistant patients. HBV DNA suppression was defined as VL
400 copies/mL. HBV DNA suppression occurred in 94% of HBeAg-positive
patients after 5 years of therapy and 85% to 96% of HBeAg-negative
patients after 96 weeks of entecavir therapy. 5In lamivudine-refractory
HBeAg-positive patients, the efficacy of entecavir after 96 weeks of
treatment was about 40%. In patients with decompensated cirrhosis,
HBV DNA suppression occurred in 72% of patients after 48 weeks of
therapy in a recent study.3 Loss of HBsAg occurred in 5.1% of HBeAgpositive nucleoside-naïve chronic HBV patients after 96 weeks of
treatment.
Entecavir reduces necroinflammation and reverses fibrosis and cirrhosis
in some patients after many years of treatment. The dose is 0.5 to 1 mg
daily. It has an excellent safety profile. Only 1% of treatment-naïve
HBeAg-positive patients developed entecavir resistance over 5 years. 5
However, in lamivudine-resistant patients, 51% developed entecavirresistance mutations and 43% developed virologic breakthrough (≥1
log10 rise in HBV DNA).
Second-Line Agents

Adefovir
Adefovir is a nucleotide analog. The usual dose is 10 mg daily. This
should be adjusted in patients with renal disease. It is effective for
treating naïve HBeAg-positive and -negative and lamivudine-resistant
HBV patients. The use of adefovir and lamivudine in combination leads
to a significant reduction of lamivudine and adefovir–induced resistant
mutations.
Lamivudine
Lamivudine is a nucleoside analog. The usual dose is 100 mg daily. It is
safe in patients with advanced or decompensated liver disease.
Treatment success is proportional to treatment duration. The high rate
of antiviral-resistant mutations (15% to 20% per year of treatment) has
diminished its use in patients with hepatitis B.
Telbivudine
Telbivudine is a nucleoside analog with a few advantages over other
354

members of the same class.
Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with advanced cirrhosis
caused by HBV. Immunoprophylaxis with HBIG combined with a
nucleoside or nucleotide analog is used to diminish the possibility of
post-liver transplantation recurrence.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients with chronic HBV should be screened with imaging studies
(abdominal ultrasound, computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance
imaging [MRI]) and α-fetoprotein every 6 to 12 months for early
detection of HCC.

CHRONIC HEPATITIS C

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Epidemiology

About 180 million people are infected throughout the world with the
HCV.6
In the United States, 4 million people are positive for antibodies against
HCV (anti-HCV).
HCV infection is the main cause of liver disease–related deaths and the
primary indication for liver transplantation in the United States.
Etiology

HCV is an RNA virus that belongs to the Flaviviridae family.
HCV is transmitted parenterally via transfusion, injection drug use, or
needle-stick injury. It is rarely acquired through sexual or vertical
transmission (mother to child).
355

Acute hepatitis progresses to chronicity in 60% to 80% of HCV patients
and will result in cirrhosis in about 15% to 20% of patients. Cirrhotic
patients are at increased risk for the development of HCC.
Natural History

The incubation period is 15 to 150 days.
Chronic HCV has an indolent clinical course over decades. Patients with
immunosuppression, alcoholism, and obesity may have a faster
progression to cirrhosis.
Risk Factors

The highest prevalence is among hemophiliacs receiving blood
transfusion before 1987 and people with history of IV drug use
(leading mode of transmission in the United States). There is a moderate
prevalence in recipients of blood transfusions or patients with organ
transplantation before 1992.
There is a lower prevalence among patients on HD, those with
tattooing or body piercing, monogamous sexual partners of
HCV-infected people, and health care workers with occupational
exposure to needlesticks.
Risk factors for rapid development of cirrhosis include male gender, older
age, alcohol consumption (more than 50 g/day), obesity with hepatic
steatosis, and HIV coinfection.
Prevention

There is no available vaccine for HCV prevention.
Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations of hepatitis C include mixed
cryoglobulinemia vasculitis (10% to 25% of patients with HCV),
glomerulonephritis, porphyria cutanea tarda, cutaneous necrotizing
vasculitis, lichen planus, and lymphoma.

DIAGNOSIS

356

Clinical Presentation
History and Physical Examination

Chronic HCV symptoms and physical examination are similar to those
described in other forms of chronic viral hepatitis (see Chronic Hepatitis
B, Clinical Presentation).
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Diagnosis of HCV infection is suspected by the presence of anti-HCV
antibodies and confirmed with the detection of HCV RNA. Anti-HCV
antibodies may be undetectable for the first 8 to 12 weeks after
infection; acute HCV can be diagnosed by the presence of HCV RNA
during this time.
A false–positive-anti-HCV test can be seen in the setting of
hypergammaglobulinemia or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH). A false–
negative-anti-HCV test may be seen in immunocompromised patients
on HD and solid organ transplant recipients.
HCV RNA is detected in serum as early as 1 to 2 weeks after infection.
This test is useful both for diagnosis and for assessment of sustained
virologic response (SVR) after treatment.
HCV genotype determination influences the duration, dosage, and
susceptibility to treatment. Genotype 1 (subtypes 1a and 1b) accounts
for the majority of infections in the United States and generally has a
poorer susceptibility to treatment. Genotypes 2 and 3 account for 20% of
HCV infection in the United States and generally are treatment sensitive.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is useful in determining the grade and stage of liver
disease.
Liver biopsy status may be helpful in determining when to start therapy
and as a prognostic factor.

TREATMENT

357

Goals

Goals of treatment are to clear the hepatitis C virus and prevent
complications of chronic HCV infection, including cirrhosis and HCC.
Treatment response is assessed by normalization of ALT levels,
clearance of HCV RNA, and improvement in liver biopsy parameters of
inflammation and fibrosis. Treatment response is defined on the basis of
the time of clearance of the HCV RNA.
Rapid virologic response is defined as undetectable HCV RNA level at
4 weeks of therapy. Complete early virological response is defined
as negative VL at 12 weeks of therapy.
End of treatment response is defined as undetectable HCV RNA levels
at the termination of treatment. Sustained virologic response is
defined as undetectable HCV RNA levels 6 months after treatment
discontinuation. Infection is considered eradicated when SVR is obtained.
SVR is generally achieved in about 40% to 50% of all patients treated
with antivirals.
Nonresponders are patients with no decrease in HCV RNA levels at 12
weeks of therapy. Partial responders (“slow responders”) are
patients whose HCV RNA levels decline by more than 2 logs after 12
weeks of treatment to become undetectable by 24 weeks. Relapsers
are patients with negative HCV RNA levels at the end of treatment who
flare after treatment discontinuation.
Medications
First Line

Chronic HCV infection is treated with combination of subcutaneous
pegylatedinterferon-α (pIFN-α) and ribavirin.
The dose for pIFN-α-2a is 180 mcg/week, whereas the dose for pIFN-α2b is 1.5 mcg/kg/week.
The dose for oral ribavirin is 800 to 1400 mg/day (dependent on body
weight).
Genotypes 1 and 4 patients are typically treated for 48 weeks with pIFN
plus standard weight-based ribavirin. Patients with genotype 1 who
obtain rapid virologic response (about 16%) may achieve SVR with
shorter treatments.
Patients with genotypes 2 and 3 are usually treated with pIFN-α-2a and
358

ribavirin for 24 weeks.
See Chronic Hepatitis B section for side effects of IFN.
Side effects of ribavirin include teratogenicity, hemolytic anemia,
hyperuricemia, itching, rash, and pulmonary symptoms. It should be used cautiously
in patients with renal disease. Severe anemia and lactic acidosis are side effects
when used in conjunction with didanosine or azidothymidine (AZT, also called
zidovudine) in HIV patients. Contraindications include pregnancy, chronic renal
insufficiency, and inability to tolerate anemia.
Other Medications

Specifically targeted antiviral therapies or drug antiviral agents
for hepatitis C are in varying phases of clinical development.
Protease inhibitors (telaprevir and boceprevir) are being evaluated by
the Food and Drug Administration for use in chronic HCV. They are
particularly useful for patients infected with genotype 1.
Phase 2b and 3 studies have shown SVRs in the order of 61% to 68% in
patients treated with triple therapy (pIFN, ribavirin, and a protease
inhibitor) with low rates of relapse (2% to 14%).7 These new treatments
may also offer the advantage of shorter treatment courses.
Treatment Response

Treatment outcomes are based on clinical status (acute versus chronic),
HCV genotype, VL at initiation of therapy, and degree of fibrosis.
Favorable characteristics for treatment response include female gender,
non– African American race, lower body weight, and adherence to pIFN
and ribavarin doses.
Recent studies have shown that IL28B polymorphism (rs12979860) along
with other single-nucleotide polymorphisms around the gene coding for
IL28B are strong predictors of SVR and spontaneous clearance of HCV.8
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation may be indicated in patients with advanced
cirrhosis.
Disease recurrence after transplantation is almost universal in those
transplanted with viremia.
Posttransplantation recurrence is treated with pIFN and ribavirin;
359

however, SVR in patients treated post–liver transplantation is lower than
in nonimmunosuppressed patients.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Patients with cryoglobulinemia and mild/moderate proteinuria with
slowly progressive renal disease can be treated with standard IFN or
reduced doses of pIFN and ribavirin. Salvage therapy in those with poor
response to pIFN and ribavirin includes rituximab, cyclophosphamide,
methylprednisone, or plasma exchange.
Patients with reduced creatinine clearance, HD, or decompensated
cirrhosis may be treated cautiously with reduced doses of pIFN and
ribavirin.

ALCOHOLIC LIVER DISEASE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Classification

Liver toxicity induced by alcohol generates a spectrum of liver damage:
fatty liver, hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
Epidemiology

Fatty liver disease, the most common manifestation of alcoholic liver
disease, is present in 90% of chronic alcohol users.9
Progression to cirrhosis is seen in 5% to 15% of these patients despite
abstinence, and in 30% to 37% if alcohol use continues.
Despite the high prevalence of fatty liver disease in heavy drinkers, only
10% to 35% will develop alcoholic hepatitis.
Risk Factors

Risk factors for liver disease in alcoholics include higher doses and longer
360

duration of alcohol use (i.e., more than 60 g/day), obesity, iron overload,
concomitant viral hepatitis, genetic factors, malnutrition, and female
gender.
Consumption of approximately 30 to 40 units per week of alcohol results
in cirrhosis in 3% to 8% of patients with more than 12 years of alcohol
use (one unit is equal to 8 g of alcohol, one glass of wine, or one 240 mL
can of 3.5% to 4% beer).
Rates of alcohol-related cirrhosis are higher among Blacks and Hispanics.
Associated Conditions

Associated conditions induced by alcohol include cardiomyopathy,
skeletal muscle wasting, pancreatic dysfunction, and
neurotoxicity.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation varies according to the stage of liver damage at time of
presentation.
History and Physical Examination

Physical examination findings in patients with alcoholic liver disease vary
according to the stage of the disease at diagnosis.
Patients with fatty liver disease are usually asymptomatic.
Alcoholic hepatitis has a spectrum of clinical presentations and
severity. Patients may have clinically silent disease or severe hepatitis
with rapid development of hepatic failure and death.
Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may show classic signs and symptoms
of advanced liver disease (see Hepatitis B section, 2.1.2.).
Diagnostic Testing

Patients with evidence of liver disease should be screened for alcohol
dependency by obtaining a thorough social history and sometimes
random alcohol levels.
361

The CAGE questionnaire has high sensitivity and specificity for
identification of alcohol dependency. It consists of four questions: (1)
Have you ever felt you needed to Cut down on your drinking? (2) Have
people A nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking? (3) Have you ever felt
Guilty about drinking? (4) Have you ever felt you needed a drink first
thing in the morning (Eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of
a hangover? Two “yes” responses is an indicator for further evaluation.
Laboratories

Alcoholic hepatitis should be suspected in patients with elevated
aminotransferases when the AST to ALT ratio is >2:1.
A cholestatic picture characterized by elevated alkaline phosphatase
(AP), total bilirubin (predominantly conjugated), and abnormal
coagulation parameters may also be found.
Poor prognosis may be indicated by elevated creatinine, leukocytosis,
marked cholestasis, and coagulopathy that does not improve with
subcutaneous vitamin K administration.
Discriminant function (DF) can be determined to assess in-hospital
mortality. DF = 4.6 × (PT patient – PT control) + serum total bilirubin.
DF >32 is associated with poor prognosis.
Imaging

Abdominal ultrasound or radiologic cross-sectional studies (MRI or
CT) are used to investigate other liver diseases including obstructive
biliary pathology and infiltrative and neoplastic disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is rarely indicated during the acute phase of alcoholic
hepatitis. In later stages, it may be used to assess the stage and
severity of liver damage.
Histology includes Mallory hyaline bodies, ballooning degeneration,
neutrophilic infiltrate, confluent parenchymal necrosis of hepatocytes,
megamitochondria, intrasinusoidal and pericentral collagen deposition,
lobular inflammation, nuclear vacuolation, bile duct proliferation, fatty
change, and perivenular and perisinusoidal fibrosis.

TREATMENT
362

Nonpharmacologic Treatment

Abstinence from alcohol is the cornerstone of treatment.
Treatment in alcoholic liver disease also includes nutritional support.
In the absence of hepatic encephalopathy or with a functioning
gastrointestinal tract, enteral feeding should be considered if the patient
is not eating.
In patients with hepatic encephalopathy or with ileus, total parenteral
nutrition should be considered (confers a mortality benefit).
In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, a regular oral diet with multiple
feedings and high protein and caloric content improve survival.
Medications

Corticosteroids
Treatment of alcoholic hepatitis with corticosteroids is controversial.
Evidence suggests, however, that patients with a DF >32 and hepatic
encephalopathy may benefit from steroid therapy.10
Prednisolone is started at 40 mg/day PO for 4 weeks and then tapered
over 2 to 4 weeks.
Pentoxifylline
Treatment with pentoxifylline, a nonselective phosphodiesterase
inhibitor with anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to improve
short-term survival in severe alcoholic hepatitis (DF >32), largely by
reducing the development of hepatorenal syndrome.
The usual dose of pentoxifylline is 400 mg PO TID.
Other nonpharmacologic therapies
Liver transplant is indicated in patients with advanced liver disease
from alcohol.
A minimum of 6 months of abstinence and participation in a
rehabilitation program are required to be considered a candidate for liver
transplantation.

AUTOIMMUNE LIVER DISEASE

363

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Autoimmune liver disease encompasses a spectrum of illnesses, including
AIH, primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC),
and overlap syndromes. These diseases have different clinical
presentations and the diagnosis is often challenging to the physician
(Table 19-3). Patients with autoimmune liver disease may have
concurrent nonhepatic autoimmune illnesses.

Definition
AIH is a chronic inflammatory disease of the liver with no known cause.
Ongoing inflammation results in progressive hepatitis to fibrosis and
eventually cirrhosis.
AIH is associated with circulating autoantibodies and
hypergammaglobulinemia.
Classification

There are two main types of AIH: Type 1 and Type 2.12
364

Type 1 AIH affects predominantly females with a peak incidence in the
second through fourth decades of life.
Type 2 AIH predominantly affects children with elevated serum IgG
levels.
Both types are commonly associated with other autoimmune diseases,
can progress to cirrhosis, and vary in their diagnostic markers (see
“Diagnosis” section).
Epidemiology and Natural History

AIH occurs worldwide and in all age groups; it most commonly affects
women aged 10 to 30 years and older than 60 years (20% of all cases).
Cirrhosis is more often the initial clinical presentation in African
Americans than Caucasian patients.
Older patients (older than 60 years) generally have greater degree of
fibrosis, cirrhosis, and a higher frequency of portal hypertension at
presentation.
Incidence of HCC is about 1.1% per year.
Pathophysiology

Environmental and genetic factors, along with regulatory T-cell
dysfunction, cause dysregulation of immune responses to autoantigens
resulting in a loss of immune-tolerance.
Genetic studies have demonstrated different HLA antigen alleles in the
AIH of adults (Type 1) compared with the AIH of children (Type 2),
indicating that genetic factors may influence the presentation in different
age groups.
Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations may be found in 30% to 50% of patients.
They include celiac sprue, Coombs’ positive hemolytic anemia,
autoimmune thyroiditis, Graves’ disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative
colitis (UC), type 1 diabetes, and vitiligo.
Patients with AIH may have concurrent autoimmune liver diseases (e.g.,
PBC, PSC, autoimmune cholangitis).

DIAGNOSIS
365

Clinical Presentation

AIH has a range of clinical presentations. In approximately 30% of cases,
the presentation is acute with fever, abdominal pain, jaundice, and
malaise. Some of these patients may progress to fulminant hepatic
failure.
AIH may have an indolent course with 25% to 30% of patients
progressing to cirrhosis over time.
About 40% of patients are asymptomatic (usually men with lower serum
ALT levels).
Careful history should be obtained to investigate the use of excessive
alcohol, viral hepatitis risk factors, use of hepatoxins, and risk factors for
metabolic disorders to rule out overlapping conditions and confounding
variables.
Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis is made by detection of elevated serum aminotransferases,
circulating autoantibodies, elevated immunoglobulin levels, and liver
biopsy.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

The most commonly elevated antibodies include antinuclear antibody
(ANA), antismooth muscle antibody (ASMA), and anti–liverkidney microsomal antibody (LKM-1). In type 1 AIH, ANA and ASMA
are positive, whereas in type 2, anti-LKM-1 antibody is positive.
Other causes of liver disease should be excluded such as Wilson’s
disease (WD), α1-antitrypsin (α1-AT) deficiency, viral hepatitis, alcoholmediated liver disease, PBC, PSC, and other infections or medications
that could cause liver disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is essential for the diagnosis of AIH.
“Piecemeal necrosis” or interface hepatitis with lobular or panacinar
366

inflammation along with lymphocytic and plasmacytic infiltration are the
histologic hallmarks. Bridging necrosis, fibrosis, or well-developed
cirrhosis is found in advanced stages.

TREATMENT

Treatment Outcomes

Treatment is directed at achieving disease remission:
normalization of serum bilirubin, immunoglobulin levels, AST, ALT;
disappearance of symptoms; and resolution of histologic changes.
Remission should be achieved for 2 to 4 years to decrease likelihood of
relapse.
Other treatment outcomes include incomplete response (no remission
after 3 years of treatment) and relapse (increase in serum AST to more
than three times the ULN or increase in serum γ-globulin to >2 g/dL with
redevelopment of interface hepatitis).
Treatment Indications

Patients with AST levels at least ten-fold upper limit of normal range, or
more than five-fold upper limit of normal with serum IgG more than twofold the upper limit of normal, and those with bridging fibrosis or
multilobular necrosis have a high mortality rate and should be treated
promptly.12
Medications

Therapy is initiated with prednisone (60 mg/day) alone or prednisone
(30 mg/day) with azathioprine (1 to 2 mg/kg/day). Prednisone is
tapered by 5 to 10 mg every week to 2 weeks when biochemical and
clinical improvement is noted. Incomplete responders require lifelong
low-dose prednisone and/or azathioprine therapy.
Relapses should be re-treated with prednisone and azathioprine, with
eventual weaning of prednisone and continuation of azathioprine at 2
mg/kg daily chronically.13 An alternative treatment includes low-dose
prednisone to maintain AST level less than three times upper limit of
367

normal.
Side effects associated with azathioprine include cholestatic hepatitis,
pancreatitis, nausea, rash, worsening bone marrow suppression,
malignancy, teratogenicity, and diarrhea. Side effects associated with
corticosteroids include diabetes, psychosis, cataracts, glaucoma, and
severe osteoporosis.
Refractory disease occurs in about 20% of patients and may require
“salvage” therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, or
tacrolimus.
Budesonide, a synthetic steroid with high affinity for glucocorticoid
receptors and high first-pass metabolism in the liver, is being studied as
a safer alternative to prednisone. A recent study showed that
budesonide, when used in conjunction with azathioprine, was effective in
causing remission of disease in noncirrhotic AIH patients after 6 months
of treatment with less steroid-specific side effects compared with
prednisone.14
AIH patients should be vaccinated against HBV and HAV prior to
treatment.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation is considered for patients with advanced cirrhosis
and treatment failure. Five-year patient and graft survivals exceed 80%.
Recurrent AIH posttransplant is seen in about 25% of patients and
responds well to augmentation of existing immunosuppression with
steroids and calcineurin inhibitors.13
De novo AIH (AIH in patients receiving a transplant for nonautoimmune
disease) should be treated with prednisone and azathioprine.15

PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

368

PSC is a cholestatic liver disorder characterized by chronic inflammation
and fibrosis resulting in progressive destruction of the extrahepatic and
intrahepatic biliary ducts and ultimately cirrhosis.
Variant Diseases

Small duct PSC is a variant in which the main bile ducts are normal on
cholangiography but with cholestatic and histologic features of PSC; it
has a more favorable prognosis.
Secondary sclerosing cholangitis is a variant in which the destruction
of bile ducts and resulting cirrhosis are a consequence of long-term
biliary obstruction (i.e., cystic fibrosis), infection, ischemia of the biliary
ducts, and inflammation instead of an autoimmune disorder.
IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis is a poorly defined entity in
which patients have increased levels of serum IgG4 and bile ducts
infiltrated with IgG4-positive plasma cells.
Epidemiology

The prevalence of PSC is about 10 per 100,000 in Northern European
descendants.
PSC occurs mainly in the fourth or fifth decade of life in adults and affects
males more than females.
Approximately 75% of patients have involvement of both large and small
ducts, 15% have small duct disease (affecting ducts too small to
evaluate with endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography [ERCP]),
and 10% have large duct disease only.
The lifetime risk of cholangiocarcinoma in patients with PSC is from 7%
to 15%.
PSC median survival without liver transplantation fluctuates from 7 to 12
years depending on the stage at diagnosis.
Risk Factors

Genetic associations in PSC and complex family inheritance patterns have
been demonstrated. A significant increased risk of PSC exists among
siblings.
Associated Conditions

369

PSC is frequently associated with UC although their clinical courses have
no correlation. In the United States, 70% of patients with PSC have UC
and approximately 2% to 4% of patients with UC have PSC.
Other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune pancreatitis and
AIH, can coexist with PSC.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Physical examination findings of PSC vary according to the stage of the
disease at diagnosis.
Many patients are initially asymptomatic with normal physical
examinations and isolated elevation of liver enzymes. Presentation with
a cholestatic syndrome with jaundice and pruritus is also common.
Acute cholangitis manifested by fever or rigors, right upper quadrant
pain, and jaundice may be a clinical emergency. Usually, these patients
have bacteremia and require IV antibiotics.
Patients may present to the physician for the first time in late stages
with cirrhosis.
Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis is supported by liver chemistry, biliary tree imaging, and
sometimes a liver biopsy.
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for PSC includes postoperative biliary strictures,
choledocholithiais, chronic bacterial cholangitis, HIV-related
cholangiopathy, biliary neoplasms, ischemic and medication-induced
biliary injuries, metabolic liver diseases, viral hepatitis, and PBC.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

AP is the most commonly elevated liver test. ALT and AST are often
370

elevated up to 2 to 3 times the ULN. Serum IgG levels are elevated to
1.5 times the ULN in about 60% of patients.
ANA is often positive and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic
antibody (p-ANCA) is positive in about 50% to 80% of the cases.
Imaging

Abdominal ultrasound may be normal or may show bile duct wall
thickening and focal bile duct dilation. Gallbladder pathology including
gallbladder dilation or wall thickening, gallstones, cholecystitis, and mass
lesions can also be present.
Abdominal CT may show thickening and enhancement of biliary ducts,
intrahepatic duct dilation, evidence of portal hypertension, and
significant lymphadenopathy.
PSC is confirmed by demonstration of multiple strictures and segmental
dilations or irregularities of the intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic bile
ducts (“beaded” pattern) by ERCP or magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography.
The finding of a “dominant stricture” (stenosis 1.5 mm in the common
bile duct or 1 mm in the hepatic duct) should raise concern for
cholangiocarcinoma. Stricture brush cytology and biopsies should be
obtained to rule out malignancy. Digital image analysis and fluorescent
in situ hybridization enhance the sensitivity of obtained brush cytologies.
Other Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is usually unnecessary in the setting of positive ERCP for
diagnosis of large-duct PSC, but it can be helpful in the diagnosis of small
duct PSC, in excluding other diagnoses, and when overlap syndromes
(i.e., PSC–AIH overlap syndrome) are suspected.
Characteristic findings of PSC include concentric periductal fibrosis
(“onion-skinning”) that progresses to narrowing and obliteration of small
bile ducts.
PSC patients should also obtain a screening colonoscopy with
biopsies to rule out inflammatory bowel disease.

TREATMENT

371

Medications

Pruritis associated with PSC can be treated with cholestyramine
followe by rifampin and opiate antagonists. Serotonin antagonists can
also be used. In refractory states, plasmapheresis and liver
transplantation should be considered. 16,17
IgG4-associated sclerosing cholangitis is steroid responsive.
Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has not been proven to have a
survival benefit in PSC patients despite improving liver biochemistries;
it may cause adverse effects at higher doses.18
Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Dominant biliary duct strictures can be treated with balloon
dilation and stenting; prophylactic antibiotics should be administered
before these endoscopic procedures. Endoscopic treatment of dominant
strictures is associated with improved 3- and 5-year survival rates.
Episodes of cholangitis require antibiotics and may require
endoscopic therapy to treat biliary duct strictures. Rarely, surgical
management of biliary strictures (biliary diversion) is indicated.
Liver transplantation is a treatment option for PSC patients with
advanced disease. Unique indications include intractable pruritis,
recurrent cholangitis, and limited-stage cholangiocarcinoma.
5-year survival rates post-liver transplantation is about 85%.
Recurrent PSC after liver transplantation has been documented. Other
causes of posttransplant biliary strictures should be ruled out before
establishing the diagnosis of posttransplant PSC recurrence.
PSC patients with cholangiocarcinoma can undergo surgical
resection in the absence of cirrhosis and in particular cases be
considered for adjuvant chemotherapy and liver transplantation.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Patients are monitored for chronic complications of cholestasis and for
fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies.
Surveillance for cholangiocarcinoma is conducted every 6 to 12 months
with abdominal MRI/magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography,
372

CA19-9, and ERCP.

PRIMARY BILIARY CIRRHOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

PBC is a cholestatic liver disorder of unknown etiology with autoimmune
features.
In patients with PBC, granulomatous destruction of interlobular and
septal bile ducts results in progressive ductopenia, cholestasis, fibrosis,
and cirrhosis.
Epidemiology and Natural History

PBC is seen worldwide but is more commonly described in North America
and Northern Europe. It has a worldwide prevalence of 1:2000. 19
PBC most commonly affects women in the fourth and fifth decades of life.
It has a progressive course which may extend over many decades.
Associated Conditions

Extrahepatic manifestations associated with PBC include
keratoconjunctivitis sicca, renal tubular acidosis, gallstones, thyroid
disease, scleroderma, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and CREST syndrome
(Calcinosis, Raynaud’s phenomenon, Esophageal hypomotility,
Sclerodactyly, and Telangiectasia).

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Many patients are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.
373

As the disease progresses, the most common clinical features of PBC
include fatigue and pruritus. Patients with PBC develop features of
portal hypertension.
Patients with PBC frequently develop clinical complications from
chronic cholestasis.
Jaundice and pruritis are the most common clinical manifestations
associated with chronic cholestasis and are often the first symptoms of
PBC.
Decreased secretion of bile acids and bile salts into the small bowel
results in malabsorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins, including
vitamins A, D, E, and K.
Clinical consequences of vitamin malabsorption include the development
of osteoporosis and rarely osteomalacia. Increased risk of bleeding with
abnormal prothrombin time/INR is common.
hypercholesterolemia and the associated development of
xanthomas and xanthelasma. Xanthomas and xanthelasma are more
commonly seen in PBC than in other diseases with chronic cholestasis.
Cholestasis increases the production of melanin in the skin resulting in
hyperpigmentation.
Sicca syndrome can occur with PBC; it presents with dry eyes, dental
caries, dry mouth, dysphagia, vaginal dryness, and dry skin.
Patients with PBC may develop cirrhosis after 10 to 15 years of disease
progression.
Portal hypertension develops as a result of fibrosis or portal venule
obliteration causing nodular regenerative hyperplasia (portal
hypertension without cirrhosis).
Diagnostic Criteria

Diagnosis of PBC is based on laboratory tests and liver biopsy showing
cholestasis, positive autoimmune markers, and histology with
nonsuppurative cholangitis and destruction of small and medium-sized
bile ducts.
Differential Diagnosis

The differential diagnosis for PBC includes cholestasis due to drug
reaction, biliary obstruction, sarcoidosis, AIH, and PSC.
374

Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Elevated AP is the most common abnormality seen in PBC.
Hyperbilirubinemia, high cholesterol, elevated IgM, and bile acids are
also frequently found. AST and ALT are mildly elevated.
Antimitochondrial antibody is present in more than 90% of PBC
patients and is the serologic hallmark for diagnosis.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is helpful for both diagnosis and staging.
Stages 1 to 3 disease is characterized by portal or periportal hepatitis
with granulomatous destruction of bile ducts, bile duct proliferation, and
bridging necrosis and fibrosis. Stage 4 disease is characterized by
cirrhosis.

TREATMENT

Medications

UDCA at a dose of 13 to 15 mg/kg/day may improve liver test
abnormalities and delays progression of disease with improvement in
survival when given long term (>4 years).19 UDCA can be an effective
treatment for any histologic stage of PBC. Side effects of UDCA include
minimal weight gain, loose stools, and hair thinning.
Symptom-specific therapy for pruritus, steatorrhea, and malabsorption
can be added to treatment with UDCA.
Pruritis can be treated with cholestyramine, rifampin, sertraline, and
naltrexone.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation is indicated in PBC patients with advanced cirrhosis.
Recurrent PBC has been documented after transplantation.

NONALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE
375

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinicopathologic syndrome
that encompasses several clinical entities, including simple steatosis,
steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and end-stage liver disease in the absence of
significant alcohol consumption.
Classification

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which is part of the spectrum
of NAFLD, is defined by the presence of steatosis, hepatocellular
ballooning, lobular inflammation, and pericellular or perisinusoidal
fibrosis. It accounts for about one-fifth of NAFLD and has the risk for
progression to cirrhosis.
Non–NASH fatty liver consists of “simple” steatosis lacking significant
inflammation and is characterized by more stable disease with lesser
risks for progression to cirrhosis.
Epidemiology

A worldwide condition, NAFLD is a common liver disease in the United
States affecting 20% to 30% of the adult population. The prevalence of
NASH is about 2% to 3% with a higher prevalence among MexicanAmericans.
NAFLD affects both children and adults; its incidence increases with age.
Approximately 30% of patients with NASH will progress to fibrosis over 5
years and 15% to 20% progress to cirrhosis over time.20 About 37% of
patients with fibrosis will progress to cirrhosis, 34% will have stable
disease, and about 29% will have histologic improvement. Three percent
to four percent of NASH patients progress to end-stage disease each
year.
Mortality among NASH patients is more often from cardiovascular disease
than cirrhosis.
376

Etiology and Pathophysiology

The mechanism by which NAFLD progresses to NASH is not completely
clear.
Decreased lipid output from the liver, increased peripheral lipolysis, and
increased hepatic uptake of fatty acids lead to the development of
macrovesicular steatosis which is worsened by insulin resistance. In
addition, hyperinsulinemia induces mitochondrial dysfunction which
causes increased hepatic oxidative stress and development of
steatohepatitis.20
Secondary causes of NASH include hepatotoxic drugs (amiodarone,
nifedipine, estrogens), surgical procedures (jejunoileal bypass, extensive
small bowel resection, pancreatic and biliary diversions), and
miscellaneous conditions (total parenteral nutrition,
hypobetalipoproteinemia, environmental toxins).
Risk Factors

Risk factors for NAFLD include female gender, insulin resistance, type II
diabetes, central obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.21

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Disease presentation can vary from asymptomatic to advanced disease
and HCC.
History

Significant ETOH use (defined as more than two drinks per day for males
and more than one drink per day for females) must be ruled out by
history.
A thorough review of patients’ medications is essential, including overthe-counter medications, herbal remedies, and vitamin supplements.
Diagnostic Criteria

377

Diagnosis is suspected clinically and confirmed by imaging and liver
biopsy.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Liver enzyme elevations are generally mild. Up to 80% of patients
have normal liver enzymes.
Imaging

Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, CT, and MRI may detect
steatosis.
Magnetic resonance spectroscopy offers a quantitative measurement of
liver fat content but is not commonly available in US medical centers.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy remains the gold standard of diagnosis.
Histologic lesions necessary for diagnosis include macrosteatosis,
hepatocyte ballooning, and mixed lobular inflammation. More severe
injury on initial biopsy is found in patients who are older, have elevated
body mass index, and have diabetes.

TREATMENT

Medications

No specific established therapy for NAFLD exists. However, multiple
agents have been shown to improve liver histology and liver function
tests in NAFLD.
Vitamin E has been shown to improve steatohepatitis, lobular
inflammation, and aminotransferases in a portion of patients but does
not significantly improve fibrosis scores.22
Gemfibrozil, pravastatin, and atorvastatin have been shown to
improve aminotransferases and lipid profiles of NAFLD patients.
Metformin has been shown to decrease aminotransferase levels,
insulin, and c-peptide levels significantly. Thiazolidinediones have been
378

found to improve aminotransferases and liver histology in NAFLD
patients.22
Correction of associated conditions such as hyperlipidemia,
diabetes, and insulin resistance is warranted. It is imperative to
discontinue possible offending agents (hepatotoxins).
Agents under research include TNF-α inhibitors (reduction of hepatic
inflammation) and angiotensin receptor blockers (stellate cell inhibitor
for prevention of hepatic fibrosis).
Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Weight loss and exercise should be recommended to improve insulin
resistance and other parameters of the metabolic syndrome.
Liver transplantation should be considered in patients with advanced
cirrhosis. Recurrence of NAFLD may occur after transplantation.

MONITORING/FOLLOW-UP
Since NASH is associated with increased risk of HCC, annual screening
with abdominal imaging studies and α-fetoprotein is warranted.

METABOLIC LIVER DISEASES
The most frequently encountered metabolic liver diseases include hereditary
hemochromatosis (HH), α1-AT deficiency, and WD (Table 19-3). These diseases
generate different degrees of liver damage or progression to cirrhosis through
different mechanisms.

HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

379

HH is an autosomal recessive disorder of iron overload resulting in
oxidative damage of hepatocytes.
Epidemiology

HH is the most common inherited form of iron overload affecting
Caucasians. HH is most common in middle-aged, Caucasian males.
The degree of iron overload has a direct impact on life expectancy in
individuals with HH; thus, diagnosis is targeted at identifying individuals
before they become symptomatic. Thirty-eight percent to 50% of
patients homozygous for HFE C282Y develop iron overload and 10% to
33% develop hemochromatosis-associated morbidity.23
Etiology/Pathophysiology

HH is primarily caused by a missense mutation (C282Y) in the HFE gene
located on chromosome 6.
HFE gene mutation causes deficient synthesis of the hormone
hepcidin, causing increased iron entry into the bloodstream which
exceeds the storage capacity of ferritin and the binding capacity of
transferrin; this promotes increased iron accumulation in liver
parenchymal cells. Iron overload leads to production of highly reactive
oxygen species which damage intercellular structures. Furthermore,
abnormal iron absorption in the duodenum as well as increased release
of iron from reticuloendothelial macrophages leads to excessive and
damaging iron deposition in the heart, pancreas, skin, and endocrine
system (in addition to the liver).24
Approximately, 80% of patients with HH who are of Northern European
descent are homozygotes for the C282Y mutation.
Risk Factors

The major risk factor for development of HH is family history of HH.
Alcohol abuse is the main modifiable risk factor associated with disease
progression to cirrhosis.
Patients with cirrhosis caused by HH are at increased risk of HCC despite
adequate iron depletion therapy.
Prevention

380

Family members of patients with HH should be screened with fasting
transfer-ritin saturation and ferritin levels. Genetic testing may be
performed if needed.
Screening should also be considered in patients with liver disease of
unknown etiology, porphyria cutanea tarda, and chondrocalcinosis.
Associated Conditions

Cardiomyopathies, hypogonadism, and diabetes are frequently
associated with HH.

DIAGNOSIS
Diagnosis is based on laboratory testing, imaging, and liver biopsy.
Clinical Presentation

Some patients are asymptomatic at presentation.
Clinical manifestations include slate-colored skin, diabetes,
cardiomyopathy, arthritis, and hypogonadism. More common symptoms
include fatigue, malaise, arthralgias, and hepatomegaly.
Patients with progressive liver iron overload will develop fibrosis and
clinical manifestations of cirrhosis.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

High fasting transferrin saturation (>45%) is suggestive of the
diagnosis.
Other nonspecific laboratory tests include elevated serum iron and
ferritin levels.
The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of specific mutations in
the HFE gene.
Imaging

MRI is the imaging of choice for noninvasive assessment of iron
storage in the liver.
381

Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is not required to establish the diagnosis of HH;
however, it is helpful in staging the disease, especially in individuals at
increased risk of advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis and in those with iron
overload without typical HFE gene mutations.

TREATMENT

First-Line Treatment

Therapy consists of weekly phlebotomy until iron depletion is achieved
(ferritin level 50 mcg/L and transferrin saturation 30%).
Maintenance phlebotomy of 2 to 4 units of blood yearly is continued for
life, with goal ferritin levels between 50 and 100 mcg/L.
Treatment with phlebotomy before the onset of cirrhosis or diabetes
significantly reduces the morbidity and mortality of HH.
Phlebotomy can improve ALT/AST levels, skin pigmentation, hepatic
fibrosis, daily insulin requirements, and symptoms of weakness, lethargy,
and abdominal pain.24
HH-related hypogonadism, cirrhosis, destructive arthritis, and diabetes
are usually irreversible.
Asymptomatic individuals homozygous for the HFE gene mutation with
iron overload should be treated. Symptomatic individuals should also be
treated to minimize extent of end-organ damage.
Medications

Deferoxamine is an iron-chelating agent used in the setting of HH if
phlebotomy is contraindicated secondary to severe anemia, cardiac
failure, poor venous access, or poor tolerance. Deferoxamine binds free
iron and facilitates its urinary excretion.
Deferasirox is a new oral iron-chelating agent which has been shown to
be effective in lowering serum ferritin levels in patients with HH in a
recent phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial.25
The usual starting dose is 10 mg/kg/day. Higher doses may cause
creatinine and aminotransferases elevations.
382

Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation may be considered in cases of HH with cirrhosis.
Patients who undergo liver transplantation for HH tend to have poorer 1and 5-year survival rates when compared with other liver transplant
recipients.
Prognosis

Patients with appropriately treated HH without cirrhosis have survival
rates identical to that of the general population.

α1-ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

α1-AT deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder with codominant
expression in which a mutantα1-AT protein is formed. Retention of
mutant α1-AT protein in hepatocytes and decreased serum α1-AT levels
causes cirrhosis and early-onset panlobular emphysema.
Epidemiology

PiZZ genotype has an incidence of about 1:3500 and occurs mostly in
people of Northern European ancestry. More than 30% of patients with
PiZZ geno-type develop cirrhosis (more common in older males).
The disease onset has a bimodal distribution from neonatal hepatitis and
cholestatic jaundice in infants to chronic liver disease in adults (fifth
decade of life).
There is an increased incidence of cholangiocarcinoma and HCC in PiZZ
patients.
Pathophysiology

383

α1-AT is a serine protease inhibitor (prime inhibitor of neutrophil
elastase). Accumulation of misfolded α1-AT in the endoplasmic reticulum
of the hepatocytes produces hepatic injury. Deficiency of serum α1-AT
causes lung injury because of uninhibited proteolytic damage to the lung
connective tissue from unopposed action of elastase.
The gene associated with this disorder is located on chromosome 14.
The most common allele is M which gives rise to the normal protein
protease inhibitor (Pi) M.
The most common deficiency alleles are S (expresses 50% to 60% of α1AT) and Z (expresses 10% to 20% of α1-AT), with S being slightly more
prevalent. Deficiency genotypes associated with liver disease include
PiSZ, PiZZ, and possibly PiMZ. PiZZ genotype is associated with more
severe disease manifestations.26
Associated Conditions

Associated conditions include panniculitis, systemic vasculitis, interstitial
fibrosis (in patients with rheumatoid arthritis), peripheral neuropathy,
multiple sclerosis, intracranial aneurysms, and membranoproliferative
glomerulonephritis.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients may present with clinical features of cholestasis or cirrhosis.
Asymptomatic patients present with isolated abnormal
aminotransferases.
α1-AT deficiency can present as emphysema in early adulthood.
Diagnostic Criteria

It includes quantification of the protease inhibitor and genotyping.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

384

Low serum α1-AT level (10% to 15% of normal) is suggestive of the
disease.
Other suggestive tests include decreased α1-globulin level (protein
electrophoresis). Patients with proven enzyme deficiency should be
tested for their α1-AT genotype.
Diagnostic Procedures

Liver biopsy is essential for diagnosis. It shows characteristic
periodic acid-Schiff– positive, diastase-resistant intracellular globules in
the periportal hepatocytes.

TREATMENT

Medications

Currently, no specific medical treatment exists for the liver disease
associated with α1-AT deficiency. Gene therapy for α1-AT is a potential
future alternative for these patients. For patients with emphysema,
“augmentation therapy” (IV purified pooled human plasma α1-AT) raises
serum α1-AT levels but does not necessarily improve the rate of FEV1
decline.26
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation is indicated in patients with α1-AT deficiency and
decompensated cirrhosis.
Liver transplantation corrects the underlying disorder by normalizing α1AT production. It is unclear whether liver transplantation slows the onset
of emphysema.

WILSON’S DISEASE

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
385

Definition

Wilson’s disease is an autosomal recessive disorder that results in
progressive copper overload in the liver, kidney, brain, and cornea.
Epidemiology

The incidence of Wilson’s disease is 1:30,000.27
This disease usually presents primarily as hepatic disease in younger
patients and with neurologic or psychiatric symptoms in the second
decade of life.
Pathophysiology

Wilson’s disease is caused by a mutation in the ATP7B gene located on
chromo-some 13.
Absence or reduced function of the ATP7B gene results in decreased
hepatocyte excretion of copper, precipitating copper accumulation within
the liver.
Progressive copper buildup results in hepatocyte injury, fibrosis, and
cirrhosis.
Copper is subsequently released into the bloodstream and deposited into
the brain, kidneys, and cornea.
Prevention

DNA testing for family members of affected individuals is becoming
commercially available.
The analysis requires identification of the patient’s ATP7B gene mutation
or haplotype; this same haplotype is screened for in first-degree
relatives.
Many patients are compound heterozygotes, making identification of
mutations more difficult.
To date, more than 200 mutations of the ATP7B gene have been
identified.

DIAGNOSIS
386

Clinical Presentation

Wilson’s disease can present as chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, or rarely as
fulminant hepatic failure.
The diagnosis should be considered in patients with unexplained liver
disease with or without neuropsychiatric symptoms, first-degree relatives
with Wilson’s disease, or individuals with fulminant hepatic failure.
Cirrhosis is frequently identified in patients with Wilson’s disease
between the age of 10 and 20 years.
Neuropsychiatric manifestations include asymmetric tremor,
dysarthria, ataxia, and psychiatric features.
Other extrahepatic manifestations include Kayser-Fleischer rings
on slit lamp examination (gold to brown rings caused by copper
deposition in Descemet’s membrane in the periphery of the cornea),
hemolytic anemia, renal tubular acidosis, arthritis, and
osteopenia.
Diagnostic Testing

Diagnosis is based on laboratory studies, imaging, and liver biopsy.
Laboratories

Laboratory findings include low ceruloplasmin levels (20 mg/dL),
although normal values do not rule out the diagnosis.
Elevated serum copper level (>200 mcg/dL) and elevated 24-hour
urinary copper level (>100 mg/24 hours) may also be detected.
These laboratory tests are better used for monitoring treatment in
patients with Wilson’s disease than for diagnostic purposes.
Laboratory results may also show an AP to bilirubin ratio of 4 and an AST
to ALT ratio of >2.2.
Imaging

Brain imaging can demonstrate basal ganglia changes due to copper
accumulation.
Diagnostic Procedures

387

Liver biopsy findings are nonspecific and depend on the presentation and
stage of the disease.
Liver histology can include steatosis, glycogenated nuclei, chronic
hepatitis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis.
Elevated hepatic copper levels >250 mcg/g dry weight (normal 40 mcg/g
dry weight) on biopsy are highly suggestive of Wilson’s disease.

TREATMENT

Medications

Treatment is with copper chelating agents or zinc salts. Chelating agents
like trientine and penicillamine are used for initial and maintenance
therapy, whereas zinc salts are used for maintenance therapy.28
Patients require lifelong therapy.
Chelating Agents

Penicillamine
Penicillamine 1 to 2 g/day PO in divided doses BID or QID plus pyridoxine
2.5 mg/day can be used in patients with hepatic failure.
Side effects include hypersensitivity, bone marrow suppression,
proteinuria, systemic lupus erythematosus, or Goodpasture’s syndrome.
Penicillamine should never be given as initial treatment to patients with
neurologic symptoms.
Trientine
Trientine 1 to 2 g/day PO in divided doses BID or QID is also used.
Side effects are similar to those of penicillamine but occur in lower
frequency. The risk of neurologic decompensation with trientine is less
than with penicillamine.
Tetrathiomolybdate
Tetrathiomolybdate is both a chelating agent and inhibitor of copper
absorption; the normal dose is 120 mg/day divided as 20 mg TID with
meals and 60 mg at bedtime (without food). It can be given with zinc
therapy.
Tetrathiomolybdate is the treatment of choice for patients presenting
with neurologic symptoms. It has a good safety profile; possible side
388

effects include anemia, leukopenia, and mild elevations of
aminotransferases.
Dietary restriction of copper-containing food should be used in
conjunction with drug treatment.
Zinc Salts

Zinc salts at a dose of 50 mg PO TID are indicated for treatment of WD
in patients with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis in the absence of hepatic
failure.
It can be used in association with penicillamine and trientine.
Other than gastric irritation, zinc has a very good safety profile.
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Liver transplantation is the therapy of choice for fulminant hepatic failure
and for progressive liver dysfunction despite chelation therapy.
Plasmapheresis and hemofiltration may help bridge patients to transplant
by markedly reducing serum copper levels, thereby reducing hemolysis
and second organ damage.
In the absence of neurologic symptoms, liver transplantation has a good
prognosis and requires no further medical treatment.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Cirrhosis is the common endpoint of a multitude of insults to the liver,
with myriad complications caused by progressive liver dysfunction and
portal hypertension.
Ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and renal
dysfunction are the major sources of morbidity and mortality.
Treatment of the underlying cause of cirrhosis as well as prevention of
complications are the mainstays of treatment.
Screening for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and evaluation for liver
transplantation are important steps in management.
Definition

Cirrhosis is a pathologic diagnosis.
The World Health Organization defines cirrhosis as a “diffuse process
characterized by fibrosis and conversion of normal liver architecture into
structurally abnormal nodules which lack normal lobular organization.”1
Classification

Classified by morphology, histology, and etiologic agent1
Morphology may be classified as micronodular, macronodular, or mixed.
Histology may be classified as portal, postnecrotic, posthepatitic, biliary,
or congestive.
Etiology corresponds to specific morphologic and histologic findings.
Clinical classification using Child-Turcotte-Pugh score (Table 20-1)2
392

This scoring system incorporates ascites, presence of encephalopathy,
serum albumin, total bilirubin, and prothrombin time.
It can be used to determine 1-year mortality.
Epidemiology

According to the summary health statistics from the 2007 National Health
Interview Survey, ~2.6 million adults suffer from chronic liver disease
and cirrhosis. However, this may be an underestimation, as 2.7 to 3.9
million are thought to have chronic hepatitis C in the United States
alone.3,4
Cirrhosis is the twelfth leading cause of death in the United States, with
29,963 deaths per year.5
Cirrhosis is the fourth leading cause of death in the 45 to 54 age group
amongst both men and women.5

Etiology

Cirrhosis is a common endpoint for many causes of liver disease (Table
20-2), with alcoholic liver disease and hepatitis C accounting for the
majority of cases.6
Other causes include autoimmune hepatitis, Wilson’s disease,
hemochromatosis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, drug hepatotoxicity,
veno-occlusive disease, and cryptogenic cirrhosis.6
393

Pathophysiology

The pathway to cirrhosis begins with hepatocellular damage.
Fenestrated sinusoids with absent intercellular junctions and basement
membranes ensure close interactions between the sinusoidal blood and
hepatocytes; therefore, hepatocytes are sensitive to blood-borne toxins.7
Hepatocellular injury leads to the initiation of an inflammatory cascade
with the release of cytokines, which amplify and sustain the overall
response.
Cytokines activate effector cells, especially hepatic stellate cells,
initiating an autocrine loop of inflammation and fibrosis.7–9
Stellate cells are transformed into cells with fibrinogenic, contractile, and
proliferative properties. Because of increased stellate cell contractility,
there is increased intrahepatic resistance and decreased sinusoidal blood
flow.
Stellate cell transformation also leads to “capillarization” of the hepatic
sinusoids with a shift from a fenestrated sinusoid to a “nonfenestrated”
capillary.
Capillarization induces a shift toward vasoconstriction, with increased
production of endothelin and decreased production of nitric oxide.
Thrombosis of the microvasculature occurs with formation of intrahepatic
arterial shunts.9
An erratic proliferation of hepatocytes takes place in hypoperfused
areas, leading to a nodular pattern of regeneration within areas of
fibrosis.
Risk Factors

Cirrhosis is a common endpoint of chronic diseases that cause hepatic
injury.
These include chronic viral hepatitis, alcohol liver disease, iron overload,
and chronic inflammatory conditions, such as nonalcoholic
steatohepatitis.

394

Alcohol: men with intake of >168 g/week; women with intake of >112
g/week.10
Hepatitis C: intravenous drug use, transplant or transfusion prior to
1992, and HIV infection.11

DIAGNOSIS
Many patients present with overt complications of cirrhosis; however,
395

one must have a high clinical suspicion in patients with subtle symptoms.
Manifestations of cirrhosis in different organ systems is presented in
Table 20-3.
Clinical Presentation

Subtle symptoms
Anorexia, nausea/vomiting, hyperirritability, pruritis, change in sleep
pattern, decreased libido, shortness of breath, jaundice
Overt complications of cirrhosis
Hematemesis/melena, abdominal distention, ascites, confusion,
edema/fluid overload
Complications can also include a myriad of infections, coagulopathy,
acute on chronic liver failure, hepatopulmonary syndrome, and HCC.
History

The history should focus on common causes of liver disease and cirrhosis.
Duration and quantity of alcohol intake, intravenous/intranasal drug use,
sexual activity, family history of liver disease, prescription medications,
and over-the-counter drug use.

396

Personal history of ulcerative colitis, metabolic syndrome, premature
emphysema, and history of autoimmune disease places patients at risk
for primary sclerosing cholangitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, α1antitrypsin deficiency, and autoimmune hepatitis, respectively.
A history of a hypercoagulable state or prior malignancy may lead to
hepatic venous thrombosis (Budd-Chiari syndrome). A stem cell or bone
marrow transplant increases the risk of veno-occlusive disease.
A constellation of skin changes, arthritis, diabetes mellitus, and
hypogonadism is seen in individuals with hereditary hemochromatosis.
Physical Examination

The physical examination can reveal signs of cirrhosis.
Muscle wasting, jaundice, spider angiomata, gynecomastia, caput
medusa, prominent venous collaterals, palmar erythema, Dupuytren’s
contracture, testicular atrophy, and ecchymoses.
Splenomegaly, a coarse liver edge, and evidence of ascites (fluid wave,
397

dullness in flanks, and/or shifting dullness) may be present on abdominal
examination.
Rectal examination may reveal hemorrhoids, guaiac-positive stools, or
melena.
Confusion, agitation, asterixis, and hyporeflexia are signs of hepatic
encephalopathy.
Diagnostic Testing

Etiology-specific testing for the cause of cirrhosis should be performed as
outlined in Table 20-2; however, evaluation should begin with basic
laboratory studies.
Laboratories

Complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and hepatic function
panel
Complete blood cell count may reveal megaloblastic anemia due to
liver disease or microcytic/normocytic anemia due to GI blood loss.
Leukocytosis can be an indicator for underlying infection, especially
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) in the setting of ascites.
Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia are markers for hypersplenism due to
portal hypertension.
Basic metabolic panel may reveal hyponatremia in the setting of fluid
overload or intravascular volume depletion. Blood urea nitrogen and
serum creatinine may be acutely elevated because of the hepatorenal
syndrome (HRS). Hypoglycemia may be present due to dysregulation of
hepatic compensatory mechanisms.
Hepatic function panel may show hypoalbuminemia, indicating
impaired hepatic synthetic function. Serum bilirubin may be elevated
indicating an acute insult superimposed on chronic disease versus poor
hepatic function. Transaminase elevations may indicate acute on chronic
liver disease; however, the aspartate aminotransferase and alanine
aminotransferase will often be normal to mildly elevated.
Coagulation studies, ammonia, and blood culture
Clotting factors are synthesized in the liver. Therefore, clotting is often
abnormal, with elevated prothrombin time (PT)/international normalized
ratio (INR). PT/INR can be used as a marker for evaluating synthetic
function.
398

Ammonia level is often used in the diagnosis and treatment of hepatic
encephalopathy. However, ammonia levels have very poor specificity
and are not particularly useful in the diagnosis of hepatic
encephalopathy; some use ammonia levels to monitor treatment
response, but no convincing data exist for reliability in monitoring patient
course.
Imaging

Imaging studies of the liver are useful in assessing the size and
echotexture of the liver, the presence of ascites, biliary ductal dilation,
and splenomegaly. They also help screen for liver masses and HCC.
Ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance
imaging are commonly used.
Ultrasonography has the added benefit of evaluating hepatic
vasculature and grading the severity of portal hypertension using color
Doppler.
Magnetic resonance imaging may be used to further characterize
hepatic masses and vasculature.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography allows direct
imaging and intervention of the biliary tree.
Diagnostic Procedures

Paracentesis
A diagnostic paracentesis should be performed on all patients admitted
to the hospital with ascites, given the high incidence of SBP. There is no
need to correct coagulopathy prior to paracentesis unless the platelet
count is 15,000/mm3 or INR is >2.5.12
Fluid sample should be obtained for cell count with differential, albumin
level, and protein level.
An absolute ascites neutrophil count of >250 cells/mm3 suggests SBP. A
bedside blood culture bottle inoculation with ascitic fluid should be
performed if SBP is suspected.
Serum ascites albumin gradient (SAAG) >1.1 suggests portal
hypertension or heart failure while a SAAG 1.1 suggests peritoneal
carcinomatosis or tuberculous peritonitis: See Chapter 10 for explanation
of SAAG.
An ascitic fluid total protein level of >2.5 g/dL may suggest alternate
399

etiologies such as heart failure, whereas a protein level of 2.5 g/dL is
consistent with portal hypertension.
Liver biopsy
This is not necessary if imaging, laboratory, and clinical findings are
consistent with cirrhosis. It can be very useful if the specific etiology of
cirrhosis needs to be determined.

TREATMENT
Management focuses on treatment of the underlying cause of cirrhosis
and management of complications.
Complications of cirrhosis include GI hemorrhage, encephalopathy,
ascites, SBP, and HRS.
Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage

Upper GI bleeding in cirrhotic patients is usually caused by variceal
rupture, gastritis, portal hypertensive gastropathy, or peptic ulcer
disease. Varices are present in 30% to 40% of patients with
compensated cirrhosis and 60% of patients with ascites. The annual
incidence of new varices is 5% to 10%.13
In addition to fluid resuscitation, octreotide infusion13 (to lower portal
pressure) and antibiotic therapy14 with a third-generation cephalosporin
(to reduce SBP and mortality) are indicated early in the presentation.
Endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) is currently the mainstay of endoscopic
therapy in acute variceal bleeding. See Chapter 6 for further details
regarding treatment of GI hemorrhage.
Prevention and Follow-up

Periodic endoscopic evaluation is essential to identify varices and
prevent progression to variceal bleeding.
In patients with compensated cirrhosis with no varices on screening
endoscopy, EGD should be performed every 2 to 3 years. In those with
small varices (5 mm), EGD should be repeated in 1 to 2 years.13
Patients with decompensated cirrhosis, defined as the development of
complications of liver dysfunction with reduced hepatic synthetic function
and portal hypertension, should undergo yearly EGD.13
400

Patients who survive an episode of active bleeding should have repeat
EVL until obliteration of varices. The first surveillance EGD is performed 1
to 3 months after obliteration and is repeated every 6 to 12 months to
check for recurrence.13
Nonselective β-blockers such as nadolol, propranolol, or timolol are
also used for prevention of variceal bleeding. β-blockers decrease cardiac
output and produce splanchnic vasoconstriction.
American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) does not
recommend nonselective β-blocker use in patients with cirrhosis without
varices.13
A trial comprising 200 patients followed for 55 months without evidence
of prior varices showed no difference in the development of varices (39%
vs. 40%) in patients on β-blockers versus placebo.
AASLD recommends use of a nonselective β-blocker in patients with
small and large varices.13
Two separate meta-analyses comparing β-blockers with placebo showed
a 40% to 50% reduction in the risk of bleeding.
For secondary prophylaxis after a sentinel bleeding event, a combination
of β-blockers and EVL versus endoscopic therapy alone was associated
with a significantly lower rate of recurrent variceal bleeding with
combination therapy (14% vs. 38% at 16 months), though the mortality
rate was similar.
Proton pump inhibitors should be considered in patients with peptic
ulcer disease or other erosive findings on endoscopy; however, there is
no recommendation for the use of a proton pump inhibitor in portal
hypertensive gastropathy and esophageal varices.
Hepatic Encephalopathy

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder associated
with severe liver disease and is graded according to the West Haven
criteria (Table 20-4).
Excess ammonia is central to the pathogenesis of this process due to the
acceleration of astrocyte swelling and cerebral edema; however, the
precise molecular mechanism is unclear.15

401

Despite its role in encephalopathy, ammonia levels have very poor
specificity in diagnosis and monitoring of HE.
HE is a diagnosis of exclusion and other causes of altered mental
status must be ruled out.
The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds with altered mental status,
asterixis, and hypo- or hyperreflexia. A precipitating cause for
encephalopathy, such as sepsis, GI bleeding, constipation, dehydration,
or electrolyte abnormality, should be identified and treated once the
diagnosis of HE is made (Table 20-5).
Patients with grade 3 and 4 encephalopathy may require close
monitoring in an intensive care unit setting with endotracheal intubation
for airway protection. The risk of cerebral edema increases with
progression of encephalopathy. Advanced cerebral edema can lead to
uncal herniation and death. This is much more common in patients with
acute liver failure; however, it can be seen in patients with chronic liver
disease.
Medications

Lactulose, a disaccharide broken down by gut bacteria, is the mainstay
of treatment due to its ability to reduce intraluminal pH, converting
ammonia to ammonium, decreasing its absorption, and allowing it to be
purged from the colon.15

402

Lactulose can be administered orally, rectally, or through a nasogastric
tube, with a typical dose of 60 to 90 g/day, titrated to three to five loose
bowel movements daily.
Abdominal bloating and diarrhea are the major side effects of lactulose;
however, overtreatment with lactulose may lead to severe dehydration
and hypernatremia.
Rifaximin is a minimally absorbed oral antibiotic with FDA approval for
the treatment of HE. Its precise role in the treatment of acute HE
continues to be explored. A study published in 2010 demonstrated that
remission of HE was prolonged in patients treated with rifaximin.15
Rifaximin is administered orally at a dose of 550 mg twice daily.
Prevention and Follow-up

After resolution of HE, patients with cirrhosis tend to remain on empiric
therapy with lactulose and rifaximin for an indefinite period of time or
until they undergo transplantation.
Patients should be educated on possible precipitants of HE such as
dehydration, sedatives, narcotics, poor compliance with lactulose
therapy, and constipation.
Ascites

Ascites is the most common complication seen in cirrhotic patients, with
~50% of patients with compensated cirrhosis developing ascites during
403

10 years of follow-up.
Approximately 85% of patients with ascites in the United States have
cirrhosis.12
Ascites is caused by the activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone
system and sympathetic nervous system in response to splanchnic
vasodilatation and arterial underfilling in the setting of portal
hypertension. The activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system
causes fluid retention and elevated hydrostatic pressure in the splanchnic
microcirculation. Elevated hydrostatic pressure and low oncotic pressure
cause increased lymph production, and once lymph production surpasses
lymph return, ascites develops.
Patients present with increased abdominal girth, shortness of breath, and
lower extremity edema. Common physical findings include dullness to
percussion in the flanks, shifting dullness, pleural effusion, a fluid wave,
and umbilical and inguinal hernias.
A paracentesis allows analysis of ascitic fluid (see Chapter 10).
Medications

Spironolactone, an aldosterone antagonist, is first-line therapy for
ascites due to cirrhosis. Hyperkalemia and breast tenderness are
common side effects.12
Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is usually given with spironolactone.
Spironolactone and furosemide are prescribed at a ratio of 2.5:1, usually
at a starting dose of 100 and 40 mg daily, respectively.12
This ratio often prevents hyperkalemia.
Dosage of each medication can be increased every 1 to 2 weeks to a
maximum daily dose of 400 mg of spironolactone and 160 mg of
furosemide.12
Spironolactone can be substituted with amiloride in the setting of tender
gynecomastia.
Triamterene, metolazone, and hydrochlorothiazide may also be used in
the treatment of ascites.
The goal of diuretic therapy is the loss of 0.5 and 1 kg/day if peripheral
edema is present.12
Diuretic-resistant or -refractory ascites can be treated with bimonthly
outpatient large-volume paracentesis or transjugular intrahepatic
portosystemic shunt (TIPS).
404

In a meta-analysis, TIPS was more effective at decreasing ascites
without a significant difference in mortality, GI bleeding, infection, and
acute renal failure but with a significantly higher rate of hepatic
encephalopathy.16.
Dietary Changes

Sodium restriction to 2 to 4 g/day is an important component of the
treatment of ascites. Salt restriction and diuretic therapy are effective in
90% of patients with ascites.
Two grams of sodium is equivalent to 88 mmol/day. The body loses ~10
mmol/day of sodium chloride (NaCl) via sweat. Therefore, the kidney
must excrete NaCl at a rate of 78 mmol/day to maintain homeostasis.12
A spot urine study can determine which patient may respond to sodium
restriction without diuretic therapy.
If the urine sodium is greater than urine potassium, the patient is
excreting >78 mmol/day of NaCl and will respond to salt restriction
alone.12
Hyponatremia is often seen in the setting of ascites. A daily oral fluid
restriction of 800 to 1200 mL/day is first-line treatment. Vasopressin
receptor antagonists, such as tolvaptan, show promise in the treatment
of hypervolemic hyponatremia according to the Study of Ascending
Levels of Tolvaptan in Hyponatremia trial (SALT1 and SALT2).17
Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis

SBP is a common complication of cirrhosis and contributes to 25% of all
bacterial infections seen in this population. It is caused by translocation
of gut bacteria into the blood, causing transient bacteremia and seeding
of ascitic fluid.
Presentation may be subtle, with abdominal pain, fever, chills, jaundice,
or worsening encephalopathy. Up to half of patients with SBP are
asymptomatic, and a diagnostic paracentesis with a 22- to 25-gauge
needle is imperative, regardless of the reason for hospital admission.
A diagnostic paracentesis is the gold standard diagnostic test.
Ascitic fluid should be sent for cell count with differential, Gram’s stain,
and aerobic and anaerobic blood cultures. The presence of >250
polymorphonuclear cells/mm 3 strongly suggests SBP and should be
405

aggressively treated. A positive culture, regardless of the number of
polymorphonuclear cells, should also be treated.
Medications

A third-generation cephalosporin administered for at least 5
days is the standard of care.12
Cefotaxime 1 to 2 g IV every 8 to 12 hours and ceftriaxone 1 to 2 g
every 24 hours are effective therapies.
If clinical deterioration is confirmed, coverage should be broadened to
cover Enterococcus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and
anaerobic organisms.
Following repeated episodes of SBP, patients can be given prophylactic
antibiotic therapy, such as norfloxacin 400 mg daily, ciprofloxacin 250
mg daily, or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 800/160 five times per
week.12
HRS is a feared complication of SBP and efforts to maintain adequate
volume expansion are a necessity.
Diuretics and large-volume paracentesis should be avoided in the setting
of SBP.
Albumin administration should be given to reduce the risk of HRS.
In SBP patients treated with a third-generation cephalosporin, albumin
administration at 1.5 g/kg on day 1 and 1 g/kg on day 3 is associated
with a lower rate of renal failure (10% vs. 33%) and a lower hospital
mortality rate (10% vs. 29%).18
Hepatorenal Syndrome

The HRS is an ominous sign. It affects 5% of patients hospitalized for GI
bleeding, 10% of patients with ascites treated by paracentesis, and 30%
of patients with SBP. HRS is classified on the basis of rapidity of onset
and severity of renal failure. Type I HRS is progressive over a period of
2 weeks and is often associated with a precipitating factor. Median
survival is relatively short at 12 days, with >90% mortality rate at 10
weeks. Type 2 HRS is characterized by a steady and progressive
reduction in glomerular filtration rate and recurrent, diuretic-resistant
ascites. An identifiable precipitant may be difficult to find. Type 2 HRS is
associated with a median survival of 3 to 6 months.
Diagnosis is based on four major criteria that must be met and five
406

additional criteria that provide supportive evidence for the diagnosis of
HRS.
The major criteria are (1) presence of low glomerular filtration rate as
indicated by creatinine level of >1.5 mg/dL, (2) absence of shock or
ongoing bacterial infection, (3) no sustained improvement in renal
function following administration of 1.5 L of intravenous fluid, and (4)
absence of proteinuria >500 mg/day.
Additional criteria include (1) urine volume 500 mL/day, (2) urine
sodium concentration 10 mEq/L, (3) urine osmolality > plasma
osmolality, (4) urine red blood cells 50/high powered field, and (5)
serum sodium concentration 130 mEq/L.
It is necessary to rule out reversible causes of renal failure,
including hypovolemia (owing to aggressive diuresis, GI bleeding, or poor
nutrition), sepsis, nephrotoxins, obstruction, and acute tubular necrosis.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
HCC is the third leading cause of death from cancer worldwide and the
ninth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Chronic
hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus infections account for an estimated
78% of HCC cases globally.
The relative risk for the development of HCC is 100 for chronic hepatitis
B and 20 for cirrhosis secondary to chronic hepatitis C
Surveillance with a liver ultrasonography is recommended in specific
populations. The low sensitivity and specificity of α-fetoprotein make it
less useful as a screening tool.19
Surveillance should be performed for the following populations:
Asian descendant carrier of hepatitis B (men >40 years, women >50
years)
Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis B or C
Hepatitis B carrier with family history of HCC
African/North American blacks with chronic hepatitis B
Stage 4 primary biliary cirrhosis
Cirrhosis due to hemochromatosis, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, and other
causes.
Surveillance must be performed every 6 to 12 months.
407

Hepatopulmonary syndrome is seen in 8% of cirrhotic patients and is
defined by the triad of hypoxia, liver disease, and intrapulmonary
shunting.
Platypnea (shortness of breath with upright posture) and orthodeoxia
(fall in arterial blood oxygen with upright posture) are often present.
Treatment options are limited to supplemental oxygen. Somatostatin
analogues and inhaled nitric oxide inhibitors are possible strategies with
uncertain efficacy.
Hepatopulmonary syndrome usually resolves following liver
transplantation.
Portopulmonary hypertension occurs in 2% to 5% of all cirrhotic patients
and presents with dyspnea on exertion (most common), syncope, chest
pain, fatigue, hemoptysis, or orthopnea. Poor prognosis without
treatment with mean survival of 15 months.
It is defined as precapillary pulmonary hypertension [mean pulmonary
artery pressure >25 mm Hg] in the setting of portal hypertension.
Treatment is similar to primary pulmonary hypertension and consists of
prostaglandin analogues, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, inhaled nitric
oxide, and endothelin receptor antagonists.
Transplantation is considered after the first episode of decompensation
or worsening of liver function.
The Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score objectively
evaluates liver function for patients listed for transplantation.20
It generates a number using serum creatinine, total bilirubin, and INR in
a complicated mathematical formula.
It enables physicians to allocate donor livers to “sicker” patients.

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Dr. Thomas Starzl performed the first human liver transplant in 1963.
Since then, dramatic advances in surgical and medical management in
peritransplant and posttransplant care have improved liver transplant
outcomes.
Advances in immunosuppression have allowed prolonged graft survival.
Conditions that previously were regarded as relative or absolute
contraindications to liver transplantation (hepatitis B, HIV, etc.) are now
medically managed in liver transplant candidates and recipients.
Recurrence of the disease leading to transplantation is increasingly a
cause of graft loss.
Approximately 5% of liver transplantations involve a living donor, and
about 10% of liver transplant recipients are children.
Between 2004 and 2009, a total of ~6000 to 7000 liver transplantations
were performed annually in the United States, up from ~1700 in 1988.
Changes in organ allocation with the advent of the Model for EndStage Liver Disease (MELD) have decreased wait-list mortality but
have substantially increased wait-list time.
Limited donor supply remains a significant challenge to liver
transplantation.
Current 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates after liver transplantation in the
United States are 88%, 80%, and 75%, respectively.1

INDICATIONS
411

Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is indicated for acute or chronic
liver failure from a variety of causes (Table 21-1).
Patients with cirrhosis should be considered for OLT referral when they
develop evidence of hepatic dysfunction or when they experience major
complications of end-stage liver disease (ascites, variceal bleeding, or
encephalopathy).2
The natural history of the patient’s disease must be carefully compared
with anticipated survival after OLT.
Conditions associated with liver disease [hepatopulmonary syndrome,
type I hepatorenal syndrome, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)] can
prompt an expedited OLT evaluation regardless of hepatic synthetic
dysfunction.
Disease-specific Indications

In general, indications for liver transplantation include irreversible
hepatic failure and liver cancer.2
Indications for liver transplant mirror the most common forms of chronic
liver disease including viral, alcohol, autoimmune, and metabolic causes
(see Table 21-1).

412

Hepatitis C

Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects 3 to 5 million individuals in the United
States.
The rate of development of cirrhosis in HCV-infected individuals is ~20%
after 20 years of infection. Once cirrhosis has developed, the rate of
hepatic decompensation is ~4% per year, and cancer develops at a rate
of 1% to 4% per year.3
Decompensated hepatitis C–related cirrhosis carries a 5-year mortality
413

rate of >50%.
Hepatitis C accounts for 30% to 40% of liver transplants, making it the
leading indication for liver transplantation in the United States.
Recurrent hepatitis C is nearly universal and contributes significantly to
graft injury and failure with ~20% of HCV-infected recipients developing
cirrhosis within 5 years.
Histologic fibrosis 1 year posttransplant is predictive of more rapid
progression to advanced fibrosis and, at many centers, prompts
posttransplant hepatitis C treatment.
Progression of recurrence with cirrhosis in a transplanted allograft can be
accelerated compared with natural history in native liver infection.4
Retransplantation in cases of early graft loss from hepatitis C may result
in accelerated allograft failure making retransplantation for hepatitis C–
related graft loss controversial.
Alcohol-related Liver Disease

Alcohol-related liver disease is the most common cause of cirrhosis
and accounts for 40% of deaths from cirrhosis in the United States.
Alcohol-related liver disease is the second most common indication
for liver transplantation in the United States.
Abstinence is the only effective treatment but can be associated with
dramatic survival improvement, even in patients with decompensated
cirrhosis.5
A period of abstinence before providing transplantation may
have salutary effects on liver function that obviate the need for
OLT. Most US transplant centers require 6 months of abstinence prior to
OLT listing.
Routine follow-up and alcohol abuse counseling should be undertaken in
the preoperative and postoperative period to reduce rates of recidivism.
Excellent long-term outcomes are common for patients transplanted for
alcohol-related liver disease.
Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/Cryptogenic Cirrhosis

The term nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was first used in 1980 to
describe biochemical and histologic changes consistent with alcoholic
hepatitis but without a history of alcohol use.
Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses simple steatosis,
414

NASH, and NASH-related cirrhosis. NAFLD is strongly associated with
obesity and the metabolic syndrome and is increasing in incidence
in the Unites States. Many cases of chronic liver failure previously
reported as cryptogenic are likely a consequence of NAFLD.
As NAFLD progresses to cirrhosis, fat may decrease or disappear, making
it difficult to establish with certainty that NAFLD led to cirrhosis.
NAFLD is a growing indication for liver transplantation and together with
cryptogenic cirrhosis accounts for ~7% of liver transplants annually in
the United States.2
Patients with NAFLD-related cirrhosis often have coexisting
cardiometabolic conditions (i.e., coronary artery disease) that increase
peritransplant morbidity and risk of death.
NAFLD can reoccur in an allograft liver, though this rarely leads to graft
loss.6
Hepatitis B

Prior to routine use of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG), hepatitis B
infection in liver transplant patients was associated with poor outcomes
and considered a contraindication to liver transplantation.
Peri- and posttransplant HBIG has dramatically decreased the rate of
allograft hepatitis B infection and permitted transplantation of hepatitis B
virus (HCB)-infected patients.7
Five-year survival rate is ~15% in decompensated HBV-related cirrhosis.
The duration of posttransplant hepatitis B antiviral treatment remains a
topic of controversy.
Autoimmune Hepatitis

Corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy is largely effective in
maintaining clinical and biochemical remission of autoimmune hepatitis
(AIH). However, patients with AIH may present after years of infection
when already cirrhotic or in a fulminant fashion. Both of these conditions
may require transplantation.
A fraction of patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis may have had longstanding unrecognized AIH.
Outcome after liver transplantation for AIH is excellent, with 5- and 10year survival rates of >75%.8
Recurrent disease can occur but is usually mild and managed with
415

conventional immunosuppression.
Patients transplanted for any indication may develop histologic findings
of AIH in their allograft. This generally responds to immunosuppression.
Primary Biliary Cirrhosis

Patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) who present late in the
course of their disease or respond inadequately to ursodeoxycholic acid
may progress to cirrhosis requiring transplantation.
Occasional patients with PBC and stable liver function may be considered
for OLT if they have severe pruritus, leading to sleep deprivation and
emotional disturbances.
Seventy percent of patients receiving OLT for PBC are alive after 10
years.
Recurrence of PBC after transplantation has been documented but has
not had major impact on long-term postoperative survival.9
Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis

No specific medical therapy has been shown to improve survival in
patientswith primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC).
Survival of patients with PSC after liver transplantation has been shown
to be superior to that predicted for conservatively managed patients.10
Recurrent disease is common (15% to 20%) after transplantation but
generally does not impact posttransplant survival.
The development of colorectal cancer can adversely influence
postoperative survival if regular screening is not performed in patients
with coexistent ulcerative colitis.
Metabolic Liver Diseases

The most common metabolic diseases causing progressive liver failure in
adults (excluding NASH) are α1-antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson
disease, and hereditary hemochromatosis.
Although these conditions account for 5% of the liver transplants
performed in the United States, the outcome after transplantation in
adults is excellent (1 year survival rate, 88%).
Liver transplantation is the only effective treatment of decompensated
cirrhosis secondary to α1-antitrypsin deficiency.
416

After transplantation, donor α1-antitrypsin phenotype is expressed and
serum levels of α1-antitrypsin return to normal ranges within weeks. Its
impact on pulmonary disease is unknown.
Careful assessment of lung disease should be performed in cirrhosis
secondary to α1-antitrypsin deficiency, although coexistent disease is
uncommon.
Urgent liver transplantation is the only effective option for patients with
FHF resulting from Wilson disease.
In patients receiving liver transplantation for chronic Wilson’s disease,
copper chelation and zinc therapy are not needed after transplantation.
Survival of transplanted patients with hereditary hemochromatosis is
lower than in those transplanted for other causes of liver disease.11
Because of increased risk of cardiac complications, pretransplant cardiac
evaluation is of paramount importance.
Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Patients with chronic HBV infection and cirrhosis of any kind are at risk
for HCC.
Patient prognosis in HCC is dependent upon the stage of the tumor and
the degree of liver function impairment.12
Timely liver transplantation is often the most effective treatment of HCC.
The Milan criteria are used to identify patients with HCC who are
expected to benefit with liver transplantation. Transplantation can be
considered in patients with
a single lesion 2 cm or larger but smaller than 5 cm or
no more than three lesions, the largest of which is smaller than 3 cm,
and
no evidence of extrahepatic malignancy.
In many transplant centers, patients with HCC that extend beyond Milan
criteria can be considered for downstaging procedures such as
transarterial chemoembolization or radiofrequency embolization to
decrease tumor size to within Milan criteria and allow listing for liver
transplantation.
Enhanced priority or exception points in the MELD can be awarded to
patients with HCC within Milan criteria.
Fulminant Hepatic Failure

417

There are ~2000 cases of fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in the United
States annually, most commonly resulting from acetaminophen toxicity
(39%).
FHF accounts for ~5% of liver transplants annually in the United States.
More than 60% of patients survive acetaminophen overdose without
transplantation if appropriate therapy (N-acetyl cysteine) is given in a
timely fashion.
Nonacetaminophen-related FHF may result from drug-induced liver
injury, hepatitis A and B, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Wilson disease,
immune-mediated liver disease, Budd-Chiari syndrome, and other
causes.
Given the subacute changes in physiology, as opposed to the chronic
changes with most indications, critical care in the perioperative period is
most intensive.13
In FHF, early effort must be made to identify patients likely to require
transplantation for survival and to determine whether the patient is an
acceptable candidate for transplantation.
Several scoring systems, including the King’s College criteria, have been
developed to identify patients who are likely to require transplantation to
survive acetaminophen- and nonacetaminophen-related FHF.
Patients with FHF should be promptly transferred to a transplant
center and cared for in an intensive care unit setting until clinical
improvement or transplantation. Brain edema, infection, and renal failure
may occur and require intensive management while awaiting transplant.
To address the urgency of FHF, a special category (status 1) was
created. This gives high priority to patients with FHF.

ORGAN ALLOCATION
The growing need for liver transplantation with a limited donor supply
has generated a waiting list of >16,000 patients in the United States.
The growing disparity between organ supply and demand mandates
allocation policies to prioritize scarce donor organs to patients most in
need.
The outcome of all patients who receive liver transplants and candidates
who are listed for OLT in the United States is continuously tracked in a
418

comprehensive database: the United Network for Organ Sharing
(UNOS).
Amodification of the MELD score is used to prioritize patients for
allocation:
The MELD score incorporates serum bilirubin (Tbil), international
normalized ratio of prothrombin time (INR), and serum creatinine [MELD
= 9.57 × ln(serum creatinine) + 3.78 × ln(Tbil) + 11.2 × ln(INR) +
6.43], where ln is the natural logarithm.
Patients are assigned a score in a continuous scale from 6 to 40, which
equates to estimated 3-month survival rates from 80% to 7%,
respectively.14
Serum creatinine is always entered as ≥4 g/dL—if dialysis has occurred
twice in the past week, the maximum value should be entered.
The MELD score can be modified to gain priority listing through granting
of “exception points” in certain instances including HCC (see Diseasespecific Indications section).
Patients with acute liver failure needing transplantation receive UNOS
priority 1A listing.

DIAGNOSIS

Patient Evaluation

Every option for disease-specific treatment should be considered for
patients with chronic liver disease. When no effective alternative therapy
exits, or when treatment has been ineffective, transplantation should be
considered.
In critically ill patients in whom the outcome of medical therapy is
uncertain or in whom disease is expected to advance, it is appropriate to
simultaneously begin treatment and transplantation evaluation.
Liver transplant evaluation includes a comprehensive physical,
physiologic, and psychosocial patient assessment. This involves a
multidisciplinary approach including transplant hepatologists, surgeons,
radiologists, psychiatrists, pharmacists, social workers, and case
coordinators.
Important considerations for candidate evaluation:
419

Can the patient survive the operation and the immediate postoperative
period?
Can the patient comply with a complex medical regimen and follow-up
after the transplant?
Does the patient have comorbid conditions that require modification
prior to transplantor that preclude transplant?
Components of the Transplant Evaluation

A thorough history and physical examination.
Cardiopulmonary assessment including evaluation for structural and
ischemic heart disease with pharmacologically induced stress
echocardiography and pulmonary function testing.
Abnormalities identified on noninvasive cardiopulmonary pulmonary
testing warrant further evaluation with left or right cardiac
catheterization.15
Laboratory studies to confirm the etiology of liver disease and to
evaluate for previously undetected medical conditions.
Assessment of creatinine clearance.
Serologic evaluation to determine the status of viral infections including
hepatitis B and C virus, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and HIV.
Cross-sectional abdominal imaging to determine the presence of HCC as
well as patency of hepatic inflow (portal vein and hepatic artery) and
outflow (hepaticveins).
Special Considerations

Age. There is no specific age limitation to successful OLT, and candidacy
is determined on an individual basis.
Pulmonary hypertension. This condition is often identified on
echocardiography and requires more precise measurement with right
heart catheterization. Pulmonary hypertension may preclude liver
transplantation and should, at a minimum, be optimally controlled with
medical therapy prior to transplantation.
Morbid obesity. This is generally considered a contraindication to
transplantation. Attention should be directed to improving body mass
index prior to transplantation.
Renal insufficiency: The etiology of the renal insufficiency should be
investigated prior to transplantation and, in some cases, consideration
420

given to combined liver–kidney transplantation.
Previous malignancy. Given the increased risk for recurrence of cancer
with systemic immunosuppression, consultation from the treating
oncologist regarding the risk of posttransplant recurrence should be
obtained.
HIV. Although previously regarded as a contraindication to
transplantation, improved medical therapies have allowed HIV-positive
individuals to be successfully transplanted. There are numerous
interactions between highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) and
immunosuppressant medications requiring monitoring of serum drug
levels.
Surgical issues. Thrombosis of the main portal vein may be bypassed;
however, more extensive thrombosis of the mesenteric vasculature or
cavernomatous transformation of the portal vein may preclude adequate
graft venous inflow.
Psychosocial issues. Issues related to depression and previous alcohol
or illicit substance abuses need to be explored and counseling offered.

TREATMENT

Surgical Considerations

During transplantation, the liver is placed in the natural position in the
right upper quadrant.
Most OLTs are performed using a whole donor liver.
Split liver transplantation involves utilizing a portion of the left lobe
of the donor liver for transplantation into a child and utilizing the
remaining donor organ for transplantation into an adult.
Living donor transplantation is performed at some centers, though
donor safety remains a significant concern.
Complex vascular reconstruction of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and
hepatic venous drainage system to the inferior vena cava is undertaken
to provide adequate vascular inflow and outflow to the allograft.
Biliary reconstruction is accomplished using an end-to-end anastamosis
of the proximal donor common bile duct to the distal recipient common
bile duct.
421

In transplant recipients with diseased ducts (i.e., primary sclerosing
cholangitis), a Roux-en-Y hepaticojejunostomy is performed. This
ensures removal of the entire native biliary tree and, in the case of PSC,
decreases the risk of future biliary strictures and neoplasia.

IMMUNOSUPPRESSIVE AGENTS
Advances in posttransplant immunosuppression have allowed long-term
allograft survival.
The goal of posttransplant immunosuppression is to prevent allograft
rejection while allowing physiologic defenses against infection.
Although mechanisms are incompletely understood, the liver appears to
be less susceptible to rejection than other transplanted organs.
In general, currently used immunosuppressants deplete T cells or inhibit
T-cell activation.
Calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) are the
most commonly used maintenance immunosuppressive medicines.16
CNI bind to cyclophilin, and inhibit T-cell activation and proliferation.
CNI require monitoring of 12-hour trough levels.
Because CNIs are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, drug
levels can be significantly affected by commonly prescribed medications,
requiring close monitoring of drug levels.
Side effects of CNI include nephrotoxicity, which commonly leads to
chronic renal insufficiency, neurotoxicity, hypertension, and
hyperlipidemia.

422

Antimetabolites include mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolate
sodium.
Mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolate sodium are metabolized to
mycophenolic acid (MPA), which inhibits guanosine synthesis and
lymphocyte proliferation.
MPAs are generally not used as monotherapy but as supplements to
CNIs.
The side effects of MPA include gastrointestinal disorders (primarily
diarrhea) and bone marrow suppression.
MPAs carry an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and birth defects.
mTOR inhibitors include sirolimus (SRL) and everolimus.
mTOR inhibitors bind to FK506 binding protein inhibiting T-cell
proliferation.
SRL has been associated with hepatic artery thrombosis and delayed
wound healing and generally is not used in the immediate posttransplant
period.
SRL use in place of CNI may delay progression of chronic renal
insufficiency inposttransplant patients.
Corticosteroids reduce cytokine release and lymphocyte activation.
Corticosteroids are used in the immediate posttransplant period, though
efforts are made to wean steroids by 3 to 6 months posttransplantation
to avoid side effects cause by prolonged corticosteroid use (diabetes,
hypertension, osteoporosis, etc.).
423

Intravenous and oral steroids are commonly used to treat episodes of
acute cellular rejection.

POSTTRANSPLANT COMPLICATIONS
Early posttransplant complications may relate to allograft function,
surgical anatomic issues, infections, and other causes (Table 21-2).
Early allograft dysfunction usually prompts liver biopsy, an assessment of
the hepatic vasculature, and biliary system.
Early rejection may be treated with steroids and other
immunosuppressants.
Biliary tract disease leading to graft dysfunction (i.e., biliary anastomotic
stricture) may require radiographic or endoscopic intervention.
Extrahepatic biliary strictures not responding to surgical intervention may
require revision to Roux-en-Y anatomy.
Early hepatic artery thrombosis often requires retransplantation. If this
occurs within 7 days of transplantation, the patient is relisted for
transplantation as status 1.
Late posttransplant complications include allograft rejection,
recurrence of hepatic disease in the allograft, anatomic complications
(i.e., hepatic artery thrombosis), infections, and malignancy.
Evidence of worsening hepatic function generally prompts biopsy of the
allograft.
If no clear hepatic parenchymal cause is found on biopsy (i.e., rejection),
a prompt evaluation of the allograft vasculature and biliary system is
necessary.
Posttransplant immunosuppression leads to increased risk for a
variety of malignancies (skin cancer, cervical cancer, etc.) as well as
adverse cardiometabolic risk factors (serum lipids, hypertension).

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
The pancreas is a mixed endocrine and exocrine gland consisting of
lobular subunits composed of acini.1,2
The exocrine pancreas consists of acinar, centroacinar, and ductal cells.
The acinar cells secrete ~20 digestive enzymes (in zymogen granules)
into the central ductule of the acinus.1,2
The central ductule of the acinus connects with the intralobular ducts to
form the interlobular ducts, which join to form the main pancreatic
duct.1,2
The main pancreatic duct empties into the duodenum through the
ampulla of Vater.1,2
The pancreas lies in the retroperitoneal space of the upper abdomen.
Because of its central location, diseases of the pancreas are generally
more difficult to manage than those of other abdominal viscera.
Lymphatic drainage of the pancreas occurs along several major routes.
These include the splenic, hepatic, and superior mesenteric nodal
systems, as well as the aortocaval and other posterior abdominal wall
lymphatic vessels.2
Blood vessels in close proximity to the pancreas include major vessels of
the epigastrum, such as the superior mesenteric vein, the portal vein,
and the celiac axis. Thus, local invasion of malignant pancreatic tumors
often involves these vessels, making such tumors unresectable and/or
incurable.2
If the pancreas is resected, the need to excise the vessels and lymph
427

nodes associated with it often necessitates resection of the duodenum,
gallbladder, distal bile duct, spleen, upper jejunum, and part of the
stomach.2
The vascular nature of the pancreas and the adjacent organs makes
hemorrhage the most common postoperative complication of pancreatic
resection.

ACUTE PANCREATITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Acute pancreatitis is an autodigestive process that occurs when the
proteolytic enzymes are prematurely activated within the pancreas
rather than in the intestinal lumen. The active enzymes digest
membranes within the pancreas, which leads to inflammation, edema,
vascular damage, cellular injury, and possibly death.3
Classification

Acute pancreatitis can be classified either by its clinical course or by its
histologic appearance.
Clinical classification
Nonnecrotizing (mild) acute pancreatitis comprises most cases.
Recovery usually occurs within 7 days. Death is unusual.4,5
Necrotizing (severe) acute pancreatitis is associated with a high
rate of complications and mortality.4,5
Histologic classification
Interstitial type. The pancreas is edematous, but its gross architecture
is preserved, and hemorrhage is absent.4,5
Hemorrhagic type. Marked pancreatic tissue necrosis and hemorrhage
are apparent. Surrounding areas of fat necrosis are also prominent.
Large hematomas often occur in the retroperitoneal space, and vascular
inflammation or thrombosis is common. Mortality is higher in
428

hemorrhagic than in interstitial type.4,5
Epidemiology

Acute pancreatitis accounts for >220,000 hospital admissions in the
United States each year.3
The yearly incidence of acute pancreatitis ranges from 1 to 5 per
10,000.6
Acute pancreatitis occurs at similar frequencies among all age groups,
but the cause and likelihood of death vary by demographics and other
clinical factors.
Gallstone pancreatitis is prevalent among white women older than 60
years.4
In children, trauma and systemic disease are the most common
etiologies.4
Etiology

Gallstones
Gallstone disease and excessive alcohol use account for 70% to 80% of
cases of acute pancreatitis in Western countries. It is important to note,
however, that pancreatitis develops in only a small percentage of
patients with gallstones.3,4
While the precise pathogenesis is unclear, gallstones are thought to
cause pancreatitis by one of two mechanisms:
By mechanically obstructing the pancreatic duct where it joins the
common bile duct4
By allowing the reflux of bile or duodenal contents into the pancreatic
duct after passage across the sphincter of Oddi5
Both mechanisms cause pancreatic ductal hypertension and subsequent
pancreatitis.
Alcohol
Alcohol-induced pancreatitis occurs in persons with long-standing alcohol
use.4
A single binge use of alcohol rarely, if ever, causes pancreatitis.5
Because only ~5% of chronic heavy alcohol users develop pancreatitis,
other hereditary or environmental risk factors (including smoking) likely
play a role.5
429

Drugs
Commonly implicated agents include azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, Iasparaginase, pentamidine, didanosine, valproic acid, furosemide, sulfon
amides, tetracyclines, estrogens, metronidazole, and erythromycin.6
Trauma
Acute pancreatitis can be seen after blunt or penetrating abdominal
trauma.6
Iatrogenic
Acute pancreatitis may occur as a complication of endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), pancreaticobiliary surgery, or
cardiopulmonary bypass.3–5
Hypertriglyceridemia
The breakdown products of triglycerides can induce pancreatitis in
patients with hypertriglyceridemia.6,7
When lipase in the pancreatic capillary bed acts on the high levels of
triglycerides in the serum, toxic free fatty acids are generated. Although
triglyceride levels of >2000 to 3000 mg/dL are usually required for
pancreatitis to develop, pancreatitis can also occur when serum levels
are only 500 mg/dL.3,6,7
In general, a serum triglyceride level of 1000 mg/dL suggests
hypertriglyceridemia as a cause of pancreatitis.5
Importantly, acute pancreatitis itself can elevate triglycerides.
The typical hypocaloric regimen (nothing by mouth) recommended
during acute pancreatitis results in rapid decline in triglyceride levels.
Fasting triglyceride levels should be measured after discharge from the
hospital to ascertain whether hypertriglyceridemia was the cause of
acute pancreatitis.
Infection
Infection is thought to be a rare cause of acute pancreatitis.
The most common viral infections that involve the pancreas are mumps,
cytomegalovirus, and coxsackie B virus.5
Viral hepatitis, especially hepatitis B, has also been associated with
pancreatitis.8
Patients with HIV infection develop pancreatitis at a higher rate than the
general population.
The virus itself appears to be the cause in some cases, but other factors
(anti-retroviral medications, alcohol abuse, dyslipidemia) may also play a
430

role.8
Asymptomatic hyperamylasemia and hyperlipasemia have been reported
in up to 40% of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome
(AIDS).8
Bacteria associated with acute pancreatitis include Salmonella, Shigella,
Campylobacter, hemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Legionella, Leptospira, and
Brucella species. Pancreatitis associated with these infections is most
likely toxin mediated and improves with clearance of the organisms.8
Miscellaneous causes
Other less common causes of pancreatitis include tumors (both benign
and malignant), autoimmune disorders, hypercalcemia, hereditary
pancreatitis, pancreas divisum, and papillary stenosis (sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction).4,5,7
Idiopathic
Despite an extensive workup, the cause will not be identifiable in 30%
of cases of acute pancreatitis.4
Pathophysiology

Processes that contribute to the initiation of pancreatitis include
pancreatic duct obstruction, pancreatic ischemia, and the premature
activation of zymogens within the pancreatic acinar cells.4
Subsequent digestion of pancreatic membranes causes tissue injury. This
leads to release of inflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor,
interleukin-1, platelet-activating factor) that recruit inflammatory cells
and increase vascular permeability.4
This cascade of events leads to the development of acute pancreatitis
and its systemic manifestations. If the resulting inflammation and tissue
injury causes areas of the pancreas to become devitalized, necrotizing
pancreatitis occurs and predisposes the patient to septic complications.4

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
History

431

The hallmark of acute pancreatitis is abdominal pain located in the
epigastric and periumbilical areas, radiating to the back.5
The abdominal pain typically is more intense when the patient is supine
and may be relieved if the patient leans forward or assumes a fetal
position.
The abdominal pain worsens with food and alcohol ingestion.
Nausea, emesis, and abdominal distention are also frequently reported.
Hematemesis, melena, and diarrhea are infrequent.
Physical Examination

Systemic features may include fever and tachycardia, depending on the
severity of disease. Patients may present with shock and/or in coma.3–5
Abdominal tenderness ranges from mild epigastric tenderness and
distension to rigidity with rebound tenderness.
Scleral icterus may be seen because of biliary obstruction or
accompanying liver disease.
A faint bluish discoloration around the umbilicus (Cullen’s sign) or flank
(Turner’s sign), secondary to hemorrhage, is rarely seen.
An epigastric mass due to pseudocyst formation may become palpable
over the course of the disease.
Less common features include polyarthritis, thrombophlebitis of the lower
extremities, and panniculitis (subcutaneous nodular fat necrosis).3–5
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Amylase and lipase
These are enzymes that are released from the pancreas during acute
pancreatitis.
Amylase and lipase elevations at least twice the upper limit of normal
are required to establish a conclusive diagnosis of pancreatitis.5
Compared with amylase, lipase has slightly superior sensitivity and
specificity.5
Plasma levels of both enzymes peak at 24 hours of symptoms, but
amylase has a shorter half-life.4,5
Predictors of severity
Because the severity of pancreatitis correlates with prognosis, stratifying
432

patients early during the hospital course is important.
Several approaches have been used to differentiate between patients
who will have a mild versus severe course. These rating schemes include
Ranson’s criteria, modified Glasgow criteria, and Acute
Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score
(Table 22-1). Another rating scheme, the CT Severity Index, employs
imaging data (see later).3–5,7
When compared at 48 hours after admission, all of the classification
systems are similar.9
The disadvantage of Ranson’s criteria is that patients must be scored on
admission and at 48 hours to obtain a completed score.
The modified Glasgow criteria and the APACHE II scoring system can be
calculated anytime during the hospital stay.

433

Imaging

Abdominal ultrasonography
Limited utility in visualizing the pancreas but very useful in establishing
gallstones as the cause.4
Should be the initial imaging modality in patients presenting
with acute pancreatitis.
Computed tomography
Not necessarily required for the initial diagnosis of pancreatitis in
434

patients with typical symptoms and corresponding elevations of
pancreatic enzymes.
May be normal in up to 30% of patients with mild pancreatitis, but
almost always abnormal in patients with moderate or severe
pancreatitis.4,5
Should be obtained if (1) the diagnosis is in doubt, (2) patients do not
improve within a few days, or (3) initial favorable clinical response was
followed by sudden clinical deterioration.4,5
Should be performed using a pancreatic protocol, which involves thin
cross-sectional images (“slices”) through the pancreas during several
contrast phases. Disruption of the pancreatic microcirculation results in
necrosis of the pancreatic tissue, which can be identified on computed
tomography (CT).5
Severity of pancreatitis can also be staged on the basis of CT findings
such as pancreatic edema, peripancreatic infiltrates, peripancreatic fluid
collections, vascular thrombosis, and areas of nonenhancement due to
necrosis (Fig. 22-1).
The CT Severity Index does not use any clinical or laboratory parameters
and only uses imaging findings (Table 22-1).
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
Useful when renal insufficiency or dye allergies preclude the use of CT
but not routinely performed.

435

FIGURE 22-1 Computed tomography scan demonstrating pancreatic edema and
necrosis in an 18-year-old man with gallstone pancreatitis. Note the large areas of
low-attenuation (dark gray) within the pancreatic bed (black arrow) compared with
the areas with relatively preserved blood flow (white arrow). Normally, the
pancreas has similar attenuation as the adjacent liver.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
This has both diagnostic and therapeutic utility in biliary causes of
pancreatitis.5
Once identified, impacted gallstones can be extracted and infected bile
can be drained via endoscopic sphincterotomy during ERCP (see later).

TREATMENT
Mild acute pancreatitis
Treatment is supportive with bed rest, no oral intake, intravenous
436

hydration, electrolyte replacement, antiemetics, and analgesics
(meperidine or morphine).
Nasogastric suction may be useful to alleviate the symptoms of nausea,
emesis, and abdominal distention.
The patient can be cautiously fed once the abdominal pain resolves.3,4
Severe acute pancreatitis
The treatment of severe pancreatitis, like milder forms, is primarily
supportive, but these patients typically require more vigorous fluid
resuscitation and closer monitoring in an intensive care unit.
A patient-controlled analgesic pump is often required to achieve
adequate levels of pain control.
Patients should be monitored closely for signs of clinical deterioration
from multisystem organ failure (renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, or
sepsis).4,6,7
Medications

Antibiotics
The issue of prophylactic antibiotics in pancreatitis is controversial.3–7
In general, prophylactic antibiotics are recommended in cases of severe
necrotizing pancreatitis or suspected biliary pancreatitis with cholangitis,
whereas antibiotics are not recommended for mild pancreatitis.4,5
Appropriate antibiotics should be active against a wide variety of
organisms—in particular, gram-negative bacilli.4,5
The most commonly used regimens include imipenem, meropenem,
or a combination of a fluoroquinolone and metronidazole.3
The optimal length of treatment is not known, but antibiotics are usually
continued for 10 to 14 days or until clinical improvement is seen.4,5
Caution should be exercised because prolonged use of broad-spectrum
antibiotics is associated with resistant bacterial infections as well as
disseminated fungal infections.4,5
Procedures

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
Should be performed in patients with presumed gallstone
pancreatitis with suspected residual common bile duct stones,
as suggested by persistently elevated liver enzymes or bilirubin, dilated
437

common bile duct, or obvious choledocholithiasis seen during
ultrasonography or other imaging.4,5
Should also be performed in those with findings suggestive of
cholangitis such as right upper quadrant abdominal pain and
tenderness, temperature >39°C, leukocyte count >20,000.4,5
ERCP with sphincterotomy has been shown to reduce length of hospital
stay and mortality in patients with suspected residual bile duct stones
when performed 24 to 72 hours after presentation.4
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Nutrition
Withholding oral intake is a mainstay of initial therapy for acute
pancreatitis. This serves to minimize stimulation of the exocrine
pancreas, thereby minimizing abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.3,4
Withholding oral intake also serves to mitigate pancreatic inflammation.
If the pancreatitis is severe, it may require weeks or months before oral
feedings are reintroduced. If symptoms do not resolve and an oral diet
cannot be resumed in 5 to 7 days, other avenues for nutritional support
must be considered.4,5
Enteral tube feeding delivered to the jejunum (beyond the
ligament of Treitz) is the safest manner in which to deliver nutrition. By
bypassing the stomach and duodenum, jejunal feedings theoretically
avoid the meal-driven pancreatic stimulation that can lead to symptoms
or recurrent attacks of pancreatitis.10
Enteral feedings are thought to maintain the health and barrier function
of the bowel wall, reducing the probability of bacterial translocation and
subsequent superinfection of pancreatic fluid collections.5,10
Total parental nutrition (TPN) is effective in delivering calories,
minerals, and micronutrients. However, because it bypasses the
gastrointestinal (GI) tract, TPN does not maintain bowel wall integrity.
TPN should therefore be considered a second option in feeding patients
with moderate to severe pancreatitis.10
TPN requires central venous access, imparting a significant risk of
infection. Also, TPN is financially costly and requires monitoring of key
metabolic parameters.

438

COMPLICATIONS
Fluid collection (pseudocyst)
Pseudocysts develop in 15% of patients with acute pancreatitis.3
Previously, any pseudocyst larger than 6 cm persisting for 6 weeks was
managed with a drainage procedure. It is now clear, however, that some
of these pseudocysts that are not enlarging or causing symptoms will
resolve without intervention and can be monitored with serial CT.4,11
In patients with enlarging or symptomatic noninfected pseudocysts,
endoscopic or radiological drainage is an attractive option. Radiologic
placement of drainage catheters is often successful but can result in
pancreatocutaneous fistulas.6,11
In recent years, transluminal endoscopic approaches have been
increasingly adopted to treat symptomatic fluid collections.
For endoscopic drainage to be successful, the fluid collection should not
be multiloculated and should not contain excessive amounts of debris or
necrotic material.5
The absence of pseudoaneurysms in the wall of the cyst should be
confirmed with CT before attempting endoscopic drainage.5–7
During endoscopic drainage, initially the planned puncture site in the
stomach or duodenum is identified with or without endoscopic
ultrasonography (EUS) guidance to locate an area devoid of blood
vessels. Next, a guidewire is passed into the cavity, the tract is dilated
with a balloon, and “pigtail” stents or nasocystic drains are placed
within.4–6
This allows for decompression and drainage of the pseudocyst contents
directly into the bowel through the cystenterostomy (Fig. 22-2).

439

FIGURE 22-2 Demonstration of efficacy of endoscopic pancreatic pseudocyst
drainage in a 58-year-old man with severe pancreatitis who developed a large
pseudocyst as seen on computed tomography (A). He was symptomatic with
abdominal pain, early satiety, and nausea. Therefore, multiple “pigtail” stents were
endoscopically placed from the stomach into the cavity, and the cyst resolved over a
period of 4 months (white circle) (B).
Following drainage, patients are followed with serial imaging
studies to document resolution of the pseudocyst.11
Once the pseudocyst has resolved, the stents or drains may be removed.
440

Pancreatic abscess
Occasionally, bacterial colonization of a pseudocyst or inflammatory
mass occurs, resulting in infected pancreatic necrosis or an abscess.3
Clinical manifestations include worsening pain, fever, septic physiology,
and an elevated white blood cell count.5,6
Aspiration of any low-density areas or fluid collections under CT or ultrasound guidance can guide further interventions.5
If organisms or polymorphonuclear neutrophils are seen on the aspirate,
the patient should undergo percutaneous drainage or surgical
debridement.7
The typically viscous and loculated nature of infected fluid collections
tends to render endoscopic drainage ineffective. However, direct
endoscopic debridement through a cystenterostomy and irrigation of the
cyst for several days via a nasocystic drain may be pursued in poor
surgical candidates with solitary infected fluid collections.5,11
Pancreatic necrosis
May occur as diffuse or focal areas of nonviable pancreatic parenchyma.3
Can develop during the first few days of pancreatitis.3
Onset of necrosis is associated with pancreatic inflammation,
hemoconcentration, and pancreatic hypoperfusion, whether due to
hypovolemia or hypotension from shunting of blood to other organs.4,5
Subsequent infection of necrotic pancreatic tissue is associated with late
complications and death.
Clinical indicators of necrosis, usually apparent after the first week of
illness, include fever, leukocytosis, failure to improve, or unexpected
deterioration.5
Gas bubbles may be visualized within necrotic tissue on CT.
Definitive diagnosis may be made by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) of the
necrotic area guided by CT or ultrasonography, followed by Gram stain
and culture of the aspirate.4
Treatment includes aggressive supportive care and surgical
debridement.
It has been suggested that survival is improved by delaying surgical
intervention for at least 2 weeks if possible, to allow the patient’s
medical condition to be optimized and to allow the viability of pancreatic
tissue to become more evident.3,4
441

OUT COME/PROGNOSIS
Most cases of mild, acute pancreatitis are self-limited, with a mortality
rate of 1%.6,7
Overall, about 20% of cases have a severe course, of which 10% to 30%
die.3
Despite numerous advances in intensive care unit medicine over the last
few decades, mortality in acute pancreatitis has not declined.3

CHRONIC PANCREATITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Chronic pancreatitis is characterized by progressive inflammatory
changes in the pancreas leading to irreversible damage of the pancreatic
architecture. This leads to impairment of exocrine and endocrine
function.12–14
Acute pancreatitis differs from chronic pancreatitis in that the former is
the result of injury and is nonprogressive. Recurrent flares of acute
pancreatitis may lead to chronic pancreatitis, however.13
Epidemiology

The incidence of chronic pancreatitis is ~4 of 100,000 per year; the
prevalence is ~13 of 100,000.13
Etiology

Alcohol
In Western societies, alcohol consumption is the most common etiology,
accounting for 70% to 80% of cases. Of note, however, only 5% to 10%
of alcoholics develop chronic pancreatitis.13
442

In general, prolonged alcohol intake (6 to 12 years) is required to
produce symptomatic chronic pancreatitis.14
Genetic syndromes
Patients with cystic fibrosis (mutations in the CFTR gene) develop
progressive pancreatic damage due to defective secretion from
pancreatic ductules and acinar cells, resulting in chronic pancreatitis.13,14
Hereditary chronic pancreatitis has been described.15
Ductal obstruction
May result from trauma, stones, neoplasms, or sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction.13
Autoimmune disease
Includes systemic lupus erythematosus, inflammatory bowel disease,
and autoimmune pancreatitis.13
Idiopathic
Accounts for 30% to 40% of cases.14
The comprehensive TIGAR-O classification system for etiologic risk
factors for chronic pancreatitis is shown in Table 22-2.

443

Pathophysiology

Pancreatic acinar cell loss, islet cell loss, calcifications, and patchy
mononuclear infiltrates and fibrosis are observed in chronic pancreatitis.
Protein hypersecretion and impaired ductal bicarbonate secretion occur
as well.13
The pathogenesis of these chronic inflammatory changes is not entirely
clear.
Intraductal plugging, chronic ischemia, excess free radical formation, and
autoimmune mechanisms have been proposed as factors contributing to
the development of chronic pancreatitis.13
When 10% of the normal exocrine secretion of pancreatic enzymes
remains in a patient with chronic pancreatitis, fat and/or protein
malabsorption can occur.13
Symptoms tend to occur relatively late in the course of chronic
pancreatitis.

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis often can be made on the basis of
the history and relatively simple radiographic tests. Routine blood
studies usually are not helpful in making the diagnosis of chronic
pancreatitis, and imaging may be normal.12
The classic triad of pancreatic calcifications, steatorrhea, and diabetes
mellitus usually occurs only in very advanced disease.12
Clinical Presentation
History

The most common presenting symptom is dull, constant
epigastric/periumbilical abdominal pain that may radiate to the back.
Pain could occur periodically, lasting several days, or occasionally be
constant.16
Exacerbation of pain by eating is common in chronic pancreatitis, but
other medical conditions (e.g., mesenteric ischemia and irritable bowel
syndrome) can also have a similar presentation.16
444

In advanced stages, chronic pancreatitis can be painless (15% of
patients). Idiopathic pancreatitis is more likely to be painless than
alcoholic pancreatitis.16
Nausea, vomiting, and anorexia are common.
If chronic pancreatitis is complicated by malabsorption, the patient may
present with diarrhea, steatorrhea, or azotorrhea. Compared with other
malabsorptive conditions, which tend to cause frank watery diarrhea,
pancreatic malabsorption causes diarrhea that is more bulky and formed,
with lower fecal weights.12,13
Weight loss may be multifactorial and due to anorexia, malabsorption, or
complications of chronic pancreatitis such as malignancy or uncontrolled
diabetes mellitus.14
Physical Examination

Usually is of limited assistance in the diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis
because the intensity of the patient’s complaint tends to be out of
proportion to the physical signs.16
Epigastric tenderness may be present during the painful episodes as well
as during periods of remission.
Less common manifestations of chronic pancreatitis include jaundice
(extrinsic bile duct obstruction or stricture), ascites, pleural effusion,
painful subcutaneous nodules (pancreatic panniculitis), and polyarthritis
of the small joints of the hands.13
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Leukocytosis may be observed during acute exacerbations.12,13
Anemia and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency states (hypocalcemia,
hypoprothrombinemia) are seldom seen in association with the
steatorrhea of chronic pancreatitis.13
Varying degrees of cholestasis can be seen, secondary to pancreatic
fibrosis with involvement of the common bile duct. This can cause
elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and direct bilirubin fraction.13
In contrast to attacks of acute pancreatitis, in which the serum levels of
amylase and lipase are usually elevated, these enzymes may be
445

elevated, normal, or low in chronic pancreatitis.5
Imaging

Plain X-ray of the abdomen
This should be the initial imaging study.
Demonstration of diffuse, speckled calcification of the pancreas on a
plain X-ray film is diagnostic of chronic pancreatitis.13
Although often seen in patients with advanced pancreatitis, the presence
of pancreatic calcifications does not correlate with disease severity.13
Abdominal ultrasonography
Findings include calcifications as well as dilation of the main pancreatic
duct to >4 mm. These findings may correlate to marked pancreatic
changes on ERCP.17
When a satisfactory examination is obtained, the reported sensitivity of
this test for chronic pancreatitis iŝ 70% and the specificity is 90%.17
Computed tomography
More sensitive than ultrasonography for the diagnosis of chronic
pancreatitis.18
The most common diagnostic findings of chronic pancreatitis on CT
include duct dilation, calcifications, and cystic lesions.18
Less common diagnostic findings include enlargement or atrophy of the
pancreas and heterogeneous density of the parenchyma.18
Besides being significantly more expensive, CT carries the additional
risks of contrast reactions and radiation exposure.
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
Allows for accurate delineation of the pancreatic duct (presence of
dilation, stones, or strictures), evaluation of pancreatic parenchyma, and
the detection of subtle solid and cystic lesions.
May be more desirable than CT because it avoids exposure to ionizing
radiation and iodinated intravenous contrast.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
Provides more detailed structural information of the pancreas than
ultrasonography and CT, without the risk of complications of ERCP.
Allows for evaluation of ductal and parenchymal changes, such as
446

echotexture of the gland, calcifications, lobulations, and bands of
fibrosis.
Allows for direct tissue sampling by FNA if indicated.
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
As in acute pancreatitis, ERCP is both a diagnostic and therapeutic tool.
ERCP is both sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of chronic
pancreatitis.
Mild chronic pancreatitis is characterized by dilatation and irregularity of
the side branch ducts.13,19
Moderate chronic pancreatitis is characterized by the additional findings
of dilation and tortuosity of the main pancreatic duct.13,19
Advanced disease has the additional findings of ductal stenosis, stone
formation, cyst formation, or atrophy of the pancreas.13,19
The widespread availability of EUS and magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) has largely supplanted the use of
ERCP for diagnostic pancreatography. ERCP is typically performed with
intent to deliver therapy as directed by other imaging modalities rather
than purely as a diagnostic procedure.
Tests of Pancreatic Exocrine Function

Exocrine function can be tested directly.
Testing may be performed by stimulation with secretin, cholecystokinin,
or both, followed by measurement of bicarbonate concentrations or
enzyme activity. Subnormal measured levels are suggestive of chronic
pancreatitis.13
Another method is the measurement of pancreatic polypeptide. A
subnormal rise in plasma pancreatic polypeptide levels after stimulation
with a protein-rich meal or secretin infusion is an indication of chronic
pancreatitis.
Exocrine function can also be tested indirectly.
Testing may be performed by measuring pancreatic enzyme levels or by
assessing the absorption of a compound that requires initial digestion by
pancreatic enzymes.13
The bentiromide test involves ingestion of N-benzoyl-I-tyrosyl-paminobenzoic acid (NBT-PABA), a tripeptide that is digested by
chymotrypsin with the release of p-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). Free PABA
is absorbed in the small bowel and excreted by the kidney. The quantity
447

excreted in urine is used as a measure of pancreatic exocrine function.13
Measurement of fecal chymotrypsin activity or fecal elastase levels is
also an available testing modality.
Fecal chymotrypsin activity measurement is rapid and simple, but its
sensitivity is considered too low to be recommended in clinical practice.13
In contrast, fecal elastase measurement is much more sensitive and
specific in the diagnosis of moderate to severe pancreatic insufficiency.20
Alternatively, exocrine function can be assessed by measuring the
absorption of a compound that requires initial digestion by pancreatic
enzymes. However, because clinically detectable nutrient malabsorption
does not occur until pancreatic enzyme secretion has diminished to 10%
of normal, this approach cannot detect early chronic pancreatitis.

TREATMENT

Medication for Pain

Analgesics
Initially, nonopioid analgesics such as salicylates or acetaminophen
should be used. The dose or frequency of these nonopioid analgesics
should be titrated and maximized before adding on or switching to an
opioid.21
For severe or uncontrolled pain, opioid analgesics are required.
Because of the recurrent nature of chronic pancreatitis with the frequent
use of opioid analgesics, many of these patients demonstrate opioid
dependence and drug-seeking behaviors, making evaluation and
treatment of pain quite complex.
Consultation from a pain management specialist may be helpful.
Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
Several groups of investigators have confirmed that intestinal
administration of trypsin or chymotrypsin inhibits pancreatic enzyme
secretion.21
In normal persons, intraduodenal cholecystokinin (CCK) stimulates the
pancreas to secrete digestive enzymes that, in turn, degrade CCK, thus
establishing a feedback loop.21
The reduction in pancreatic enzyme secretion in chronic pancreatitis
448

causes elevated CCK levels, leading to stimulation-associated pancreatic
pain.
Effective enzyme replacement therapy should reduce pancreatic
stimulation, decrease intraductal pressure, and diminish pain.21
In most patients, a trial of high-dose, nonenteric-coated pancreatic
enzymes is prescribed with meals for several weeks in any patient with
painful chronic pancreatitis. Typically, a starting dose of at least 48,000
units of lipase, 90,000 units of amylase, and 90,000 units of protease is
taken with each meal.21
Patients should also take a histamine-2 receptor antagonist or proton
pump inhibitor to diminish enzyme degradation by gastric acid.
The best results are seen in pancreatitis of nonalcoholic etiology, which
manifests with symptoms of constant (rather than recurrent) pain and
only mild to moderate pancreatic insufficiency.21
Octreotide
Synthetic long-acting analogue of somatostatin, an endogenous
hormone that inhibits pancreatic secretion.
Octreotide has been shown to inhibit both CCK release and pancreatic
enzyme secretion.
Randomized studies of patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis and
severe pain suggest that 200 mcg of octreotide administered
subcutaneously three times per day produced the greatest pain relief
(65% vs. 35% of patients with placebo), especially in patients with
constant, as opposed to intermittent, pain. However, this result did not
reach statistical significance.21
Additional studies are needed to further clarify the role of octreotide in
the management of pain in chronic pancreatitis.
Medication for Exocrine Insufficiency

Pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy
The cornerstone of therapy for malabsorption in patients with chronic
pancreatitis.
It is critical that sufficient amounts of enzyme are delivered to the small
bowel to abolish azotorrhea and significantly reduce steatorrhea.
Generally, 30,000 units of lipase taken with each meal is adequate to
reduce steatorrhea and prevent further weight loss.13,21
As with enzyme replacement therapy for pain control, the use of acid449

suppressive agents reduces degradation in the stomach and increases
the amount of pancreatic enzymes available in the small bowel to assist
in fat digestion. The dosage of the pancreatic enzyme supplements can
be titrated to treat the symptoms and malabsorption adequately.21
Although it is not common to see complete correction of steatorrhea in
patients with chronic pancreatitis, it is possible to bring the steatorrhea
under control.
Procedures

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
This has been used for control of pain in chronic pancreatitis, with the
aim of alleviating obstruction of flow caused by ductal strictures, stones,
or papillary stenosis.21
Ductal strictures are sometimes treated by balloon dilation, usually
followed by stent placement across the stricture.21
Endoscopic techniques also have been used for the removal of
pancreatic stones in chronic pancreatitis.21
In the cases of large stones, extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy
is used in conjunction with ERCP to fragment and then remove stones.21
Papillary stenosis is treated with pancreatic sphincterotomy during
ERCP.13,21
Celiac plexus block
Injections into the celiac ganglion have been used for control of
pancreatic pain.
This can be performed either by radiologists using fluoroscopy or
gastroenterologists using endoscopic ultrasound guidance. Typically,
absolute alcohol is injected into the area where the celiac plexus
lies.13,21
In small, uncontrolled series of patients with chronic pancreatitis and
debilitating pain, celiac plexus block has produced mixed results.21
The pain relief usually does not last for more than a few months, and
repeated treatment may not be as effective.21
Other Nonpharmacologic Therapies

Avoidance of alcohol
Avoiding alcohol decreases the frequency and severity of abdominal pain
450

in chronic alcoholic pancreatitis.13,21
All patients with excessive alcohol consumption should be referred to an
appropriate treatment program.
In patients who maintain significant exocrine secretory function, pain
may be provoked by alcohol, which acts as a pancreatic secretagogue.16
In patients whose exocrine secretion is drastically reduced, alcohol may
play a lesser role in the mechanism of pain.
Further studies are needed to clarify the role of alcohol in pain
production in chronic pancreatitis.
Surgical Management

A growing body of evidence suggests that surgical therapies for chronic
pancreatitis are superior to endoscopic management in the ability to
provide long-lasting pain relief.13,21
The type of surgery is selected according to the perceived mechanism for
the pain, the severity of pain, ductal morphology, and the extent of
parenchymal disease.
Patients who have ductal dilation have a 70% to 80% chance of
obtaining pain relief with either a partial resection with
pancreaticojejunostomy or lateral pancreaticojejunostomy.13,21
Other options include partial pancreatectomy or near total
pancreatectomy with islet cell transplantation.
Distal pancreatectomy can also be considered in those with focal
changes limited to the tail of the pancreas.21

COMPLICATIONS
Diabetes mellitus
Clinically evident diabetes, which occurs relatively late in the disease, is
seen in up to 60% of patients with chronic pancreatitis.13
Diabetic ketoacidosis and diabetic nephropathy are relatively uncommon
in this form of diabetes.
Pseudocyst
Develops in 10% of patients with chronic pancreatitis, which is less
frequent than in acute pancreatitis.13
In chronic pancreatitis, pseudocysts are the result of ductal disruptions;
451

in contrast, pseudocysts of acute pancreatitis are the result of
peripancreatic fluid collections.
Pseudocysts are usually asymptomatic.
Additional complications of pseudocyst formation include enlargement of
the pseudocyst, which may cause abdominal pain, duodenal or biliary
obstruction, vascular occlusion, or fistula formation.11
Pseudoaneurysms may form as a result of pancreatic enzyme digestion
of an adjacent vessel wall.11
Infection of the pseudocyst leads to abscess formation.
Pseudocysts are diagnosed by ultrasonography or CT.
Endoscopic drainage is indicated in cases of rapid enlargement,
compression of surrounding structures, pain, or signs of infection.13
Bile duct obstruction or duodenal obstruction
Develops in 5% to 10% of cases.13
Causes include inflammation and fibrosis in the head of the pancreas, or
a pseudocyst.
Bile duct obstruction characteristically causes pain as well as elevated
levels of transaminases and bilirubin.
Diagnosis is made by ERCP or MRCP.
Dudoental obstruction characteristically causes postprandial pain and
early satiety.
Diagnosis is made by upper GI series, upper endoscopy, or CT.
If obstruction is due pseudocyst, then drainage is indicated. Otherwise,
gastrojejunostomy or choledochoenterostomy is indicated.
For biliary stricture, endoscopic stenting can be considered.21
Pancreatic ascites
May develop due to disruption of the pancreatic duct, which leads to
fistulization to the abdomen or rupture of a pseudocyst. Pancreatic juice
then tracks into the peritoneal cavity, causing ascites. Pleural effusions
may develop in a similar manner as well.
Fluid obtained by paracentesis (or thoracentesis in the setting of pleural
effusion) has a characteristically high amylase concentration, usually
exceeding 1000 IU/L.
Treatment may be nonoperative, consisting of repeated aspiration,
diuretics, or octreotide. Parenteral nutrition to decrease pancreatic
secretion and endoscopic stenting of the pancreatic duct may be
employed as well.13,21
452

Surgical drainage involves anastomosis of a Roux-en-Y loop of jejunum
to the pancreatic duct and pseudocyst.13
Splenic vein thrombosis
Because of its location along the posterior pancreas, the splenic vein
may thrombose due to adjacent inflammation.
Gastric varices may develop due to subsequent portal hypertension.
Splenectomy is a curative option for patients who develop bleeding from
varices.
Pancreatic cancer
Chronic pancreatitis has been associated with pancreatic
adenocarcinoma.
Pancreatic cancer develops in ~4% of patients within 20 years of a
diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis.22

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Chronic pancreatitis characteristically has a prolonged, recurrent course
with progressive loss of pancreatic endocrine and exocrine function.
The “burnout” phenomenon has been observed in some patients, in
whom progressive loss of exocrine function is associated with resolution
of abdominal pain.13
Chronic pancreatitis is associated with a 50% mortality rate within 20 to
25 years. Approximately 15% to 20% of these deaths are due to
associated attacks of pancreatitis, whereas the remaining deaths are due
to associated factors such as malnutrition, infection, or complications of
alcohol or tobacco use.13,14

PANCREATIC CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

453

Ductal adenocarcinoma and its variants account for >90% of all
malignant exocrine pancreatic tumors.15
Epidemiology

Approximately 30,000 new cases of pancreatic cancer occur every year in
the United States, and nearly all of these patients eventually die from
the disease.23
The peak incidence of pancreatic carcinoma occurs in the seventh decade
of life, and there is a slight male predominance.23
The overall incidence of the disease is 30% to 40% higher in blacks than
in whites.23
Pathophysiology

Approximately two-thirds of ductal adenocarcinomas occur in the head of
the gland, with the rest in the body or tail.15
At the time of diagnosis, tumors of the head of the pancreas are usually
≥2 cm in diameter.15,24
Seventy percent to 80% of malignant pancreatic tumors have
metastasized to regional lymph nodes by the time they are
discovered.15,24
Tumors of the body and tail commonly are more advanced and larger (5
to 7 cm) when discovered, because they do not produce symptoms as
early as pancreatic head tumors.
The symptoms from tumors in the body and tail are usually caused by
malignant infiltration of the retroperitoneal structures, which produces
pain.
Less than 20% of patients present with localized, potentially curable
tumors.
By the time of diagnosis, almost all pancreatic cancers are
unresectable.15,24
Because pancreatic cancer has usually spread to lymph nodes or
vascular structures at the time of diagnosis, most patients have at least
stage III disease.
Patients with stage IV disease (distant metastases) cannot be cured and
their tumors are considered unresectable.
The best outcomes are seen in patients who have well-differentiated
454

neoplasms, without retroperitoneal invasion or lymph node metastases,
but such cases are unfortunately uncommon.
Risk Factors

Smoking
The risk factor most strongly linked to pancreatic cancer is cigarette
smoking.
Smoking approximately doubles the chance of developing the
disease.15,24
The risk of pancreatic cancer rapidly decreases when individuals
discontinue cigarette use. Approximately 10 to 15 years after quitting
smoking, the relative risk falls to ~1.15
Chronic pancreatitis
Epidemiologic studies suggest that the relative risk of developing
pancreatic cancer in patients with chronic pancreatitis is increased by up
to 15 times when compared with control populations.22
This suggests that changes associated with chronic inflammation and
fibrosis in the pancreas are important in the development of cancer.
Chronic pancreatitis accounts for only a small fraction of patients who
have pancreatic cancer.
Surgery
Patients who have had a partial gastrectomy have a three- to sevenfold
greater risk of developing pancreatic cancer.24
The apparent increase in incidence may be related to postsurgical
altered metabolism of ingested carcinogens by the remaining stomach
and small intestine.
Diet
Meats and foods of animal origin increase the risk of pancreatic cancer,
whereas foods of plant origin and dietary fiber appear to be
protective.23,24
Obesity
A body mass index of >30 kg/m2 is also reported to be associated with
increased cancer risk.25
Other factors
Increased risk of pancreatic cancer is seen in tropical chronic
pancreatitis, hereditary chronic pancreatitis, kindreds with multiple tumor
455

suppressor-1 gene mutations, and other familial cancer syndromes such
as Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.15

DIAGNOSIS
There are two main goals in the workup of a patient with suspected
pancreatic cancer:
To establish the diagnosis with certainty
To determine whether the patient should undergo a surgical procedure
to resect or palliate the disease
Clinical Presentation
History

Jaundice
Presenting symptom in 80% to 90% of patients with cancer of the head
of the pancreas.15,24
Light-colored stools and dark urine are seen if obstructive jaundice
exists.
Usually accompanied by abdominal pain.
Abdominal pain
Epigastric pain or right upper quadrant pain can occur due to biliary tree
obstruction.
Similar pain or discomfort in the left upper quadrant, back, or
periumbilical areas could also result from pancreatic duct distention
associated with pancreatic duct obstruction, or invasion of
retroperitoneal or somatic nerves.
Weight loss
By the time of diagnosis, weight loss of >10% of ideal body weight is
common.
Anorexia due to tumor-associated pain and decreased food intake
contribute to weight loss.
Proinflammatory cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor-α, play a
prominent role in the pathogenesis of cachexia of pancreatic cancer.15,24
Malabsorption from pancreatic insufficiency can also contribute to weight
loss.
456

Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus sometimes appears as an early manifestation of
pancreatic cancer, occurring many months before the tumor becomes
evident.
Other symptoms
Emesis may be caused by duodenal or gastric outlet obstruction from
tumor invasion.
GI bleeding can occur from direct invasion of the tumor into the
duodenum, stomach, or colon.
Migratory thrombophlebitis (Trousseau’s sign) is reported in ~10% of
patients and may be the earliest presenting sign.24
There is also a poorly understood association between pancreatic
malignancy and major depressive disorder.
Physical Examination

May be nonspecific.
Examination may reveal jaundice, temporal wasting, peripheral
lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and ascites.
Physical findings typically reflect the anatomical consequences of the
enlarging tumor.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Serum carbohydrate antigen 19-9 level
Most sensitive and specific tumor marker for pancreatic cancer.15
Importantly, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 level is almost never
elevated with small tumors (1 cm).
CA 19-9 level may be abnormal due to other cancers (gastric, colorectal
cancer) and with some benign conditions (cholangitis, biliary
obstruction).
Determination of CA 19-9 levels may be useful to provide some
assurance that the tumor has been resected in its entirety, to signal the
presence of recurrent disease after resection, or to determine the
response to adjuvant therapy.
Imaging

457

Abdominal ultrasonography
May be useful in patients with jaundice to distinguish between
intrahepatic and extrahepatic causes.
Extrahepatic obstruction from a pancreatic (or periampullary) cancer is
expected to show dilated intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ducts.
The specificity of ultrasonography to diagnose pancreatic cancer ranges
from 90% to 99%, but the sensitivity is as low as 75%.26
Usually, additional imaging is required when pancreatic malignancy is
suspected.
Computed tomography
Triple-phase CT is an excellent tool for the preoperative staging of
pancreatic cancer.
CT provides information about the site of the lesion, including its
vascular anatomy and its resectability (e.g., presence of hepatic
metastases or vascular invasion).27
CT can detect tumors ≥2 cm in diameter; such tumors appear as lowattenuating areas because they are poorly perfused in comparison with
adjacent pancreatic tissue.27
Small hepatic metastases as well as metastatic cancer in lymph nodes
may not be appreciated by CT.
Magnetic resonance imaging
In patients who cannot undergo CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
is a reasonable alternative for cross-sectional imaging.
MRI does not typically provide additional information over CT.
Diagnostic Procedures

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
ERCP has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 85% for the diagnosis
of pancreatic cancer.15,24
ERCP is performed successfully in >90% of patients and occasionally
detects tumors not seen on imaging studies.28
At the time of ERCP, cytology brushings from the bile duct can be
obtained, which have a sensitivity between 20% and 60% in confirming
the diagnosis of malignancy.28
During ERCP, a stent can be placed into the obstructed common bile
duct to palliate patients who are not surgical candidates.
In addition, some surgeons and oncologists prefer stent placement in the
458

bile duct to ensure adequate biliary drainage before initiation of
chemotherapy. In these cases, endoscopists can place either a plastic or
short metal stent.
Through ERCP, hepatotoxic adverse events related to chemotherapy can
be assessed, and the future risk of such events is decreased.
Despite its utility, ERCP is not required in all patients with suspected
pancreatic cancer.
If a patient has a history typical for pancreatic cancer (e.g., pain,
jaundice, weight loss) and has a mass in the head of the pancreas
evident on CT, then the patient could potentially undergo surgical
exploration without the need for a preoperative ERCP.
An ERCP for drainage of the biliary tree and cytological sampling can be
performed if the bilirubin is markedly elevated, nutritional status is poor,
and delays in surgical intervention are anticipated.
The only absolute indications for an ERCP are cholangitis,
intractable pruritus, and hyperbilirubinemia that must be treated before
the initiation of chemotherapy.24,28
Endoscopic ultrasonography
A highly sensitive tool for local and regional staging.
EUS is complementary to cross-sectional imaging because it does not
provide information about distant metastatic disease.15
EUS provides reliable information about major vascular involvement and
lymph node enlargement.
FNA of the primary pancreatic lesion or potential lymph node metastasis
can be performed during EUS (see later).
Fine-needle aspiration
Can be performed percutaneously under CT or ultrasound guidance or
can be performed endoscopically by EUS.
Tissue sampling should be pursued when cytologic proof of malignancy
alters management—for example, as a prerequisite for chemotherapy,
radiation therapy, or palliative stenting with a permanent metal stent.29
FNA is also used to establish the diagnosis when cross-sectional imaging
is equivocal regarding the presence of a mass.
Seeding of the peritoneal cavity has been described in percutaneous
sampling, but it can be avoided by employing an endoscopic approach.29
Staging laparoscopy
Complements the noninvasive staging and aids the surgeon in assessing
459

the resectability of the tumor.
Because of the aggressive nature of pancreatic cancer, metastatic
disease at the time of presentation is common.
Laparoscopy can assist in identifying small or diffuse metastases (such
as hepatic or peritoneal implants) that may be unrecognized in the initial
diagnostic evaluation.24
A number of case series demonstrated that 10% to 40% of tumors
thought to be resectable had distant or local spread that would have
precluded resection.24
During laparoscopy, the abdominal cavity is inspected for frank
metastases. Also, peritoneal washings are taken for cytology, peritoneal
nodules or lymph nodes are sampled, and intraoperative ultrasonography
of the pancreas or liver can be performed.
Because tumors in the pancreatic body and tail commonly metastasize
to the peritoneum and liver, staging laparoscopy may be particularly
useful in these patients.

TREATMENT

Surgical Management

Tumor resection
Surgery for pancreatic cancer is performed with curative intent only if no
evidence of metastatic disease is seen on preoperative imaging studies
and staging laparoscopy.
The type of surgery performed for pancreatic cancer is dependent on the
location of the tumor.
Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple or pylorus-sparing Whipple
resection) is typically performed for tumors involving the pancreatic
head.
The classic Whipple resection involves a partial gastrectomy
(antrectomy), cholecystectomy, and removal of the distal common bile
duct, head of the pancreas, duodenum, proximal jejunum, and regional
lymph nodes. Reconstruction requires pancreaticojejunostomy,
hepaticojejunostomy, and gastrojejunostomy.24
For tumors involving the body or tail of the pancreas, distal
460

pancreatectomy and splenectomy are performed.
Rarely, patients are offered a total pancreatectomy for large or
multifocal tumors.

FIGURE 22-3 Endoscopic palliation of pancreatic cancer. A 69-year-old man
developed jaundice, and a pancreatic mass was found that had metastasized to the
liver. The decision was to administer palliative chemotherapy and place a metal
biliary stent. The initial fluoroscopic cholangiogram demonstrates markedly dilated
proximal and intrahepatic bile ducts with a “cutoff” (arrow) in the distal bile duct
resulting from a malignant stricture (A). Fluoroscopic image demonstrates successful
461

placement of a metallic self-expanding biliary stent across the malignant stricture
(B).
Surgical palliation
When resection of the primary tumor is not possible, palliative
procedures are performed.
An anastomosis between the common bile duct and jejunum
(choledochojejunostomy) serves to bypass the bile duct obstruction.
Fifteen percent to 20% of these patients eventually develop duodenal
obstruction, and a gastrojejunostomy is often performed during the
initial surgery if a curative resection is not feasible.15,24
Procedures

Nonsurgical (endoscopic) palliation
Endoscopically placed metal or polyethylene stents are commonly used
to relieve biliary obstructions.15,24
Polyethylene stents need to be replaced every 3 to 4 months because of
their occlusion from bacterial biofilm and precipitated debris from the
bile duct.
Metal stents may be covered or uncovered and typically cannot be
removed after placement (Fig. 22-3).
Metal stents maintain patency longer and improve both quality of life
and mortality compared with plastic stents.
Metal stents are placed with the expectation that they will remain patent
for the life of the patient.
Tumor ingrowth can result in stent occlusion, and a new stent can be
placed within the old stent to relieve the recurrent biliary obstruction.
Gastric outlet obstruction can also be palliated effectively by endoscopic
placement of expandable metal stents.
Chemoradiation

Adjuvant and neoadjuvant treatment
5-Fluorouracil, combined with radiation therapy, confers a modest
prolongation of survival in patients with locally advanced pancreatic
cancer.15,24
Gemcitabine has been shown to increase the quality of life in patients
with advanced pancreatic cancer, but survival is only modestly
462

improved.15,24
Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is administered to some patients in the hope
that downstaging of locally advanced tumors will improve resection
rates. However, studies have not yet clearly demonstrated prolonged
survival.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Although surgical resection of the tumor offers the only chance for cure,
patients having such “curative” resections have median survival of 18 to
20 months and a 5-year survival rate of 10%.15
The overall 5-year survival rate among patients with pancreatic cancer is
5%.15

Diseases of the biliary tract are frequently encountered in both primary care and
specialty settings. They represent a broad spectrum of diseases, ranging from benign
gallstone disease to life-threatening cholangitis and cancers. Because these
disorders are widely prevalent, all physicians need to become familiar with the
diagnosis and management of biliary tract disorders.

CHOLELITHIASIS AND GALLSTONE DISORDERS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Cholelithiasis. The presence of concretions (gallsones) in the gallbladder
or bile ducts.
Choledocholithiasis. The presence of stones in the bile ducts, including
common bile duct, common hepatic duct, right and left hepatic ducts,
and intrahepatic ducts.
Classification

Cholesterol stones
This is the most common type of gallstone (75% to 90%).
Typically formed when supersaturation of cholesterol occurs in bile.
Brown stones
These form when bacteria within the biliary tree cause bilirubin to
deconjugate and combine with calcium, forming the insoluble calcium
466

bilirubinate.
Black stones
These develop in conditions associated with chronic hemolysis,
especially sickle cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis.
Black stones may also be seen in cirrhotic patients.
Epidemiology

Overall, gallstone disease is an extremely common disorder, particularly
in women and the obese.
Prevalence ranges from 10% to 15% in 40-year-old white women to as
high as 70% in female Pima Indians. 1 Although cholelithiasis is
common, 80% of patients with gallstones never develop symptoms. The
risk of developing biliary pain is 1% to 2% per year.
Risk Factors

Female sex
Multiparity
Pregnancy
Obesity
Crohn’s disease
Total parenteral nutrition
Native American race

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Clinical presentation occurs when gallstones occlude the cystic duct, pass
into the common bile duct, or erode through the wall of the gallbladder.
Presentations of gallstone disease depend on the location of the stone in
the biliary tree and include biliary pain, acute cholecystitis,
choledocholithiasis, acute cholangitis, gallstone pancreatitis, and
gallstone ileus (see later).
Stones may pass from the gallbladder into the common bile duct or
develop de novo in the bile ducts.
467

History

Most common presentation is biliary pain.
Classically described as “biliary colic,” this consists of epigastric or right
upper quadrant pain that may radiate to the right scapula or shoulder. It
can be precipitated by fatty meals, which induce gallbladder contraction.
“Biliary colic” is a misnomer, as the pain is constant rather than colicky.
The pain gradually increases over 30 minutes and then plateaus for 1
hour or longer before subsiding.
Associated dyspeptic symptoms, including bloating, nausea, or vomiting,
may occur.
The interval between attacks is variable, and weeks or months may pass
between episodes.
The pain is caused by transient occlusion of the neck of the cystic duct by
a gallstone.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

No laboratory abnormalities are usually noted unless a complication is
present.
Elevated levels of transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin can
be seen with choledocholithiasis and elevations in amylase and lipase
levels with pancreatitis.
Imaging

Ultrasonography remains the best investigative study, with 95%
sensitivity and specificity for gallbladder stones. 2
The yield is highest after fasting, and stones are identified by the
presence of mobile echogenic objects that produce acoustic shadowing.
Gallbladder sludge may also be seen as echogenic material that layers
but does not produce acoustic shadowing.
Cholelithiasis may also be identified with computed tomographic (CT)
scanning, although the sensitivity is lower than that of ultrasonography.
CT has the additional drawbacks of radiation exposure and expense.
Ultrasonography is the best initial study for choledocholithiasis as well.
Ultrasonography is very sensitive for dilated bile ducts but less sensitive
468

(30% to 50%) for common bile duct stones.
Absence of ductal dilation does not exclude choledocholithiasis.
CT scanning may also be useful but has lower sensitivity for common
bile duct stones.

TREATMENT
Gallstones are often found incidentally during evaluation for other
conditions. Because 80% of patients remain asymptomatic, the
consensus is that prophylactic cholecystectomy is not indicated.
Important exceptions are patients with a calcified or “porcelain”
gallbladder and Native Americans with gallstones. These patients are at
very high risk for gallbladder cancer, so cholecystectomy should be
performed even in the absence of symptoms. Patients with chronic
medical conditions that can be adversely affected by an episode of
cholecystitis or pancreatitis (e.g., brittle type 1 diabetes mellitus) may
benefit from elective cholecystectomy.
For choledocholithiasis, management options include nonsurgical
treatments (e.g., endoscopic papillotomy with balloon extraction,
mechanical lithotripsy), and surgical approaches including
cholecystectomy with laparoscopic stone removal.3
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) allows the
diagnosis and extraction of bile duct stones.4 In patients with high
clinical suspicion for choledocholithiasis, especially in the presence of
ductal dilatation on imaging and liver function test abnormalities, an
ERCP should be performed even if both ultrasonography and a CT do not
demonstrate choledocholithiasis.
In patients in whom clinical suspicion is lower, a magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can be used to evaluate for
choledocholithiasis. However, if an MRCP cannot be obtained, endoscopic
ultrasound (EUS) has been shown to have similar sensitivity and
specificity in diagnosing choledocholithiasis.5
In some endoscopic suites, EUS does offer a distinct advantage in that if
it is positive, a therapeutic ERCP can be performed at the same session
while the patient is still under sedation.6
Although improved experience with ERCP has led to improved outcomes,
469

risks of major complications, including pancreatitis, bleeding, perforation,
and sepsis, remain.
When choledocholithiasis is encountered during laparoscopic
cholecystectomy, surgeons can remove the stones through laparoscopic
or open common bile duct exploration. An alternative approach is ERCP
with stone extraction following cholecystectomy.
Medications

In patients who are poor surgical candidates, oral dissolution therapy
with ursodiol or chenodiol can be attempted. However, this is a slow
process and rarely results in complete resolution of stones, especially
stones that are larger than 5 mm.
Surgical Management

Clinical judgment is required to determine whether gallstones are
causing pain or dyspeptic symptoms.
Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the treatment of choice. The
laparoscopic approach is associated with a significantly shorter hospital
stay and quicker convalescence than with open cholecystectomy.
Complications include bile duct injuries and bile leakage from the cystic
duct remnant.
Bile peritonitis occurs when bile leaks into the peritoneal cavity leading
to acute peritoneal inflammation and severe abdominal pain (bile
peritonitis).
Most bile leaks after cholecystectomy occur at the cystic duct stump or
duct of Luschka. Occasionally, large collections of bile (bilomas) can form
around the biliary tree, resulting in pain and leading to bacterial
infections.
Patients usually present shortly after surgery with abdominal pain.
Abdominal CT scan usually reveals fluid or a biloma centered on the
biliary tree. A hepatoiminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan confirms the
diagnosis by revealing spillage of radioactive tracer into the abdominal
cavity.
Large bilomas usually require percutaneous drainage, especially if they
are infected.
ERCPis often used to place biliary stents to encourage preferential flow
of bile into the duodenum, which allows the leak site to heal. If bile duct
470

stones are seen, a biliary sphincterotomy with stone extraction is usually
performed before stent placement. Most leaks close within 6 weeks.
Gallstones can also be removed through a cholecystostomy, but this
requires multiple procedures, and the potential for gallstone recurrence
remains.7

COMPLICATIONS
Acute cholecystitis
Choledocholithiasis
Cholangitis
Mirizzi syndrome: a stone impacted in the cystic duct or neck of the
gallbladder that causes external compression of the common bile duct
Gallstone pancreatitis
Gallstone pancreatitis is discussed in detail in Chapter 22.
Gallstone ileus
This consists of mechanical intestinal obstruction resulting from the
passage of a large gallstone into the bowel lumen.8
The process starts with a gallstone eroding through the gallbladder wall
into the small intestine. The stone can then cause obstruction, usually at
the terminal ileum. Patients present with acute partial small bowel
obstruction.
Gallstone ileus is responsible for 1% to 4% of all cases of intestinal
obstruction and develops in 0.3% to 3% of all cholelithiasis patients. It is
seen more commonly in the elderly (eighth decade) and in women,
leading to high mortality (7.1% to 18%) from frequent comorbidities.
The diagnosis is suggested by the findings of air in the biliary tree with
dilated loops of bowel and air fluid levels on an x-ray study, with or
without an ectopic gallstone.
Abdominal ultrasonography is useful in detecting biliary stones, and
barium upper gastrointestinal series x-ray study may be needed to
detect a duodenalbiliary fistula.
Treatment is surgical enterotomy with removal of the stones
(enterolithotomy). In addition, cholecystectomy with surgical closure of
the duodenal fistula may be performed. However, this procedure is
associated with highmorbidity and mortality and should be pursued only
471

in patients in excellent general health.
Rare large stones cause most cases of gallstone ileus and therefore
recurrent obstruction is uncommon.

ACUTECHOLE CYSTITIS

General Principles
Definition

Acute calculous cholecystitis consists of inflammation or hemorrhagic
necrosis, with variable infection, ulceration, and neutrophilic infiltration
of the gallbladder wall, usually resulting from impaction of a stone in the
cystic duct.
In contrast, acalculous cholecystitis is an acute inflammatory disease
of the gallbladder not associated with gallstones but associated with bile
stasis in the gallbladder due to impaired gallbladder motility from
ischemia, usually in the setting of significant comorbid illnesses.
Epidemiology

Acute cholecystitis develops in 20% of symptomatic biliary colic patients
per year.9
Etiology

Cystic duct occlusion results in bile stasis, gallbladder wall edema,
gallbladder distention, inflammatory exudate, and bacterial infection.
Diagnosis
Clinical Presentation

Patients typically present with steady upper abdominal pain that lasts
hours, with associated nausea, vomiting, and fever.
The presentation may be more subtle in the elderly.
If bacteremic, patients may present with high fever, rigors, and severe
abdominal tenderness.
Examination often reveals right upper quadrant tenderness or a positive
472

Murphy’s sign, consisting of pain with palpation of the right upper
quadrant during inspiration with subsequent inhibition of inspiration.
Murphy’s sign can also be elicited during ultrasonography, when
pressure is applied directly on the gallbladder with the ultrasound probe.
Diagnostic Testing

Laboratories
Most patients have a modest leukocytosis and normal or only slightly
increased transaminases and bilirubin.
Significantly elevated transaminases or bilirubin should raise suspicion of
common bile duct stone.
Imaging
Patients with suspected acute cholecystitis should undergo
ultrasonography. Important findings include gallstones, sonographic
Murphy’s sign, gallbladder wall thickening, and pericholecystic fluid.
If the diagnosis remains in doubt, cholescintigraphy (HIDA, paraisopropyl iminodiacetic acid, or diisopropyl iminodiacetic acid scan)
should be performed. Radiolabeled iminodiacetic acid derivatives are
administered, which are rapidly extracted by the liver and then excreted
into bile. A normal study shows radioactivity in the gallbladder, common
bile duct, and small intestine within 60 minutes. In acute cholecystitis,
there is delayed filling of the gallbladder because of cystic duct
obstruction.
Treatment

Patients with acute cholecystitis are made NPO and are given
intravenous fluids and broad-spectrum antibioticsto
treatsecondary infection.
Nasogastric suctionis performed if the abdomen is distended or if the
patient is vomiting.
Prompt surgical consultation should be obtained. Definitive
management is laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy.
Most clinicians recommend waiting 24 to 48 hours until the patient has
clinically stabilized, but surgery should be performed more urgently if the
condition deteriorates.
If possible, cholecystectomy should be performed during the initial
473

hospitalization, as delaying the procedure to a subsequent return visit
has been shown to increase costs with no clinical benefit.10,11
Patients who are poor surgical candidates should have percutaneous
cholecystostomy or transpapillary endoscopic drainage of the
gallbladder.
Complications

Complications of acute cholecystitis include gallbladder perforation,
emphysematous cholecystitis caused by gas-forming bacteria, and
gallstone ileus.

ACUTE CHOLANGITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

Acute cholangitis consists of inflammation of the bile duct, typically from
bacterial infection complicating an obstructed duct.12
Etiology

Choledocholithiasis causes most cases of cholangitis, although
patients with biliary neoplasms or inflammatory biliary strictures from
primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) can develop cholangitis, especially if
they have undergone prior biliary interventions (e.g., ERCP).
Gallstones can cause cholangitis even after a cholecystectomy, as stones
are retained in the common bile duct with some frequency, and can be
present for years after cholecystectomy before causing any problems.
These retained stones can be identified during a cholecystectomy
through intraoperative cholangiography.
Most common pathogens are enterobacteria (68%), enterococci (14%),
bacteroides (10%), and clostridium species (7%).
Risk Factors

474

Choledocholithiasis
Instrumentation of the biliary tract

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation
Approximately 70% of patients present with all three components of
Charcot’s triad: pain, jaundice, and fever.
If suppurative cholangitis develops, patients will additionally present with
mental status changes and hypotension (Reynold’s pentad).
Leukocytosis and markedly increased bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase
are usually present.
Blood cultures are frequently positive if gram-negative bacteria are the
cause of the infection, especially in cases of suppurative cholangitis.
The most common organisms isolated are gram-negative rods such as
Escherichia coli,enterococci, and anaerobes, particularly in the elderly.
Diagnostic Testing

The diagnosis must be made quickly, as patients are at risk of developing
severe sepsis.
Imaging

Ultrasonography or abdominal CT should be performed, looking for
ductal dilatation or common bile duct stones.
A negative study finding, however, does not rule out cholangitis, because
the common duct may not be dilated early in the course of disease and
common duct stones may be missed.
Diagnostic Procedures

ERCP must be performed emergently in suspected cases of
cholangitis, especially if the patient is clinically deteriorating.13
Therefore, the ERCP team should be notified immediately in any case of
suspected acute cholangitis.
475

ERCP identifies common duct stones or strictures and allows therapeutic
interventions, such as sphincterotomy, biliary drainage, stone extraction,
and biliary stent placement.
If ERCP is unsuccessful or cannot be performed, percutaneous
transhepatic cholangiography (PTC) or surgical decompression should be
pursued.
Both of these procedures, however, have higher mortality and morbidity
rates than ERCP.

TREATMENT
ERCP provides for drainage of the biliary tree and may resolve
obstruction from choledocholithiasis. Furthermore, stents can be placed
to keep bile flowing, especially when unsurmountable obstructions (e.g.,
neoplasms) are encountered.
Medications

Broad-spectrum antibiotics and aggressive fluid resuscitation
should be immediately started if cholangitis is suspected.
Typically, ureidopenicillins, carbapenems, or the combination of third/
fourth-generation cephalosporins + metronidazole are the empiric
antibiotics of choice.
If penicillin-allergic metronidazole with either aztreonam or ciprofloxacin
can be used.
Antibiotics are usually given for a total of 7 to 10 days, but they can be
stopped earlier if good biliary drainage is established.
For patients who have not undergone cholecystectomy, resolution of
cholangitis should lead to prompt laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

GALLBLADDER CARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

476

Definition

This consists of neoplasia involving the gallbladder, typically
adenocarcinoma.
Epidemiology

Gallbladder cancer represents the most common biliary tract
malignancy.14
This is predominantly seen in elderly women. It is the most common
gastrointestinal malignancy in Native Americans.
Up to 80% have a history of gallstones, and there is a higher incidence of
gallstones with longer duration of p53 or K-ras mutations.
Approximately 90% of patients are diagnosed after the neoplasm has
spread beyond the gallbladder.
Patients who have a calcified or “porcelain” gallbladder are at very high
risk of gallbladder cancer and should undergo cholecystectomy even if
asymptomatic.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients typically present with prolonged abdominal pain, which may
be difficult to differentiate from biliary pain, or acute cholecystitis.
Other common symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and
jaundice.
Differential Diagnosis

Biliary pain
Acute cholecystitis
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

Carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) are
477

both often elevated.
Increases in serum bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase generally indicate
the presence of advanced disease.
Imaging

Ultrasonography often detects masses within the gallbladder lumen or
irregular gallbladder wall thickening. A normal ultrasonography does not
rule out gall-bladder cancer, however.
CT scanning demonstrates masses and gallbladder thickening and
provides additional evidence for extent of disease.
Diagnostic Procedures

Fine-needle aspiration during EUS has also been used to evaluate
peripancreatic and periportal lymphadenopathy.15
ERCP or percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is indicated in
patients with evidence of biliary obstruction.
Histologic diagnosis for tumors that appear unresectable can be
accomplished with percutaneous biopsy or ERCP.
If resection is planned, preoperative tissue diagnosis is unnecessary.

TREATMENT
Most patients present with advanced unresectable disease.
The overall 5-year survival rate is 5%, but patients with advanced cancer
have a median survival of only 45 to 127 days.
Surgical Management

Patients whose cancers are staged between I and III have potentially
resectable tumors.
Depending on the extent of spread, surgery may be as simple as
cholecystectomy or require extensive hepatic, pancreatic, and duodenal
resection.
Palliative Management

Patients with unresectable disease may be given chemotherapy with
478

agents such as 5-fluorouracil, adriamycin, gemcitabine, and nitroureases,
but results are not encouraging.
Most patients with unresectable disease will need palliative treatments,
such as endoscopic stent placement or percutaneous biliary
drainage.

PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

PSC consists of inflammation of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile
ducts, from an autoimmune or idiopathic mechanism.16 The disease is
discussed here from a biliary obstruction point of view, see Chapter 19
for further details.
Insidious in onset, PSC typically begins with fatigue, jaundice, and
cholestasis and progresses irreversibly to end-stage liver disease
(ESLD).17
Epidemiology

Seventy-five percent of patients are male.
The average age at diagnosis is 40 years, although the disease can often
be diagnosed in childhood.
Etiology

The etiology of PSC is unknown.
Animal and in vitro models have identified infections, autoimmunity,
cytokines, and bile acid transporter or ion channel abnormalities as
underlying causes for PSC.
Pathophysiology

Both intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are involved with strictures.
479

The disease process is usually diffuse, with obliterative fibrosis
distributed throughout the biliary system.
Tight strictures predispose the patient to intermittent obstruction of
biliary flow with subsequent bacterial cholangitis. Obstruction of biliary
flow causes reflux of bile into the hepatocytes.
Risk Factors

Up to 70% of PSC occurs in the setting of inflammatory bowel
disease (IBD), with ulcerative colitis accounting for 90% of those
cases.
No relationship exists between the duration and severity of IBD and the
development of PSC.
Although colectomy is curative for colonic disease in ulcerative colitis, it
does not eliminate the risk of PSC.
Associated Conditions

Metabolic bone disease, most commonly osteoporosis, occurs
frequently in PSC for unclear reasons.
Patients with PSC have a 10% to 30% chance of developing
cholangiocarcinoma, which is often very difficult to diagnose in the
setting of PSC.
Despite knowing that patients with PSC are at high risk for
cholangiocarcinoma, no effective way has been found to screen for
cholangiocarcinoma.
Patients with PSC with concomitant IBD also have an increased risk of
colon cancer, but preliminary reports suggest that this risk may be
decreased with the use of ursodeoxycholic acid.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

The onset of disease is often insidious, with the gradual onset of fatigue,
pruritus, and jaundice.
Pruritus can be particularly severe in PSC and can be difficult to
480

manage.
The exact mechanism remains unknown but may involve the
accumulation of pruritogenic substances secondary to decreased bile
excretion or increased opioidergic tone.
If advanced liver disease has already developed, some patients present
with variceal bleeding, encephalopathy, or ascites.
Steatorrhea and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins may develop late
in disease because of decreased secretion of bile acids.
Diagnostic Testing

Laboratories
Approximately 25% of patients are diagnosed from abnormal laboratory
tests before symptoms have developed.
Most have significantly elevated alkaline phosphatase, γglutamyltransferase, and bilirubin.
The transaminases are elevated to a lesser degree.
In addition, many patients will have positive antinuclear antibodies and a
ntineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCA) levels, suggesting that
PSC is immune mediated.
Patients with IBD who present with elevated alkaline phosphatase
levels should have an aggressive evaluation to look for PSC.
imaging

Definitive diagnosis is made by imaging of the biliary tree with either
ERCP or PTC. MRCP is increasingly being used as a noninvasive option.
The classic finding is multifocal stricturing of the intrahepatic and
extrahepatic bile ducts with intervening normal or dilated segments. This
is often described as a “string of beads” appearance.
Secondary causes of strictures, including trauma, ischemia, tumors, and
certain infections (cytomegalovirus, Cryptosporidium), need to be
excluded.
A minority of patients who do not have the classic cholangiographic
findings demonstrate small duct cholangitis on liver biopsy.

TREATMENT

481

Various medical therapies, such as immunosuppressants, corticosteroids,
and antibiotics, have not been proved successful in slowing progression
of disease, although ursodeoxycholic acidimproves biochemical
abnormalities.
Management is therefore primarily supportive until ESLD develops, at
which point liver transplantation is offered.
Indications for transplantation include refractory ascites, recurrent
bacterial cholangitis, encephalopathy, and variceal bleeding.
The survival rate 10 years after transplantation is ~79%, although
patients with PSC have a higher retransplantation rate than all other
patients with ESLD caused by recurrent disease.
Medications

Pruritus: Symptoms often respond to bile acid-binding resins, such as
cholestyramine at a dose of 4 g PO BID to QID.18
Other medical options include colestipol, ursodiol, rifampicin, odansetron,
and immunosuppressants.
Antihistamines seem to have no effect on pruritus beyond possible
sedation effects.19
Nonpharmacologic therapies that have shown promise include
photodynamic therapy and, in extreme cases, liver transplantation.
Other supportive therapies, such as emollients, lotions, or cold
compressives, have not proved efficacious in PSC.

COMPLICATIONS
Dominant stricture. Approximately 20% of patients develop a
dominant stricture.
Cholangiography demonstrates the dominant stricture, and balloon
dilatation with stent placement can be performed.
It is often very difficult to differentiate a dominant stricture from
cholangio-carcinoma.
Tumor markers, such as CA19-9, carcinoembryonic antigen, and
cytologic brushings, may be of some value in identifying patients with
cholangiocarcinoma.
A recently developed technology called “spyglass” allows direct
482

visualization of the bile duct during ERCP through fiber optics.
Direct biopsy of the strictures can also be obtained, potentially
improving the detection of early cholangiocarcinomas.
Cholangiocarcinoma20
Bacterial cholangitis. Bacterial cholangitis is more frequent in patients
who have had manipulation of the biliary tract or have developed a
dominant stricture.
Cholelithiasis or choledocholithiasis can also contribute to the
development of bacterial cholangitis.
Patients typically present with fever and worsening jaundice, and they
often have recurrent episodes.
After empiric antibiotics are started, treatment is directed at relieving
the obstruction, usually endoscopically.
ERCP allows dilation of large strictures, biliary decompression, and
removal of stones.
Prospective studies have not shown any benefit in placing
endoprostheses across strictures.
Furthermore, stent occlusion and cholangitis frequently occur with stent
placement.
Long-term prophylactic antibiotics have not been shown to have any
benefit in preventing cholangitis.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
PSC follows a slowly progressive course, with a median survival of ~10
years from diagnosis.

CHOLANGIOCARCINOMA

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Definition

483

This consists of neoplasia developing within the bile ducts.
Epidemiology

A relatively rare tumor—reported incidence of 8 per million in the United
States.21
Seen primarily in middle-aged men.
Etiology

Unknown
Pathophysiology

Chronic biliary inflammation is thought to contribute to cancer formation.
Associated Conditions

The strongest association is with PSC.
Also seen with chronic liver disease, ulcerative colitis, parasitic biliary
disease, choledochal cysts, hepatitis C, and smoking.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

Patients typically present with anorexia, weight loss, acholic stool,
abdominal pain, pruritus, and jaundice when the tumor causes significant
obstruction.
A Klatskin tumor is a bile duct cancer with involvement of the hilum of
the right and left hepatic ducts.
Some bile duct tumors spread diffusely throughout the liver, making it
difficult to distinguish from PSC.
Most tumors are locally invasive and do not metastasize.
Prognosis is grim, with rare patient survival of >1 year.
Diagnostic Testing
Laboratories

484

Most patients have elevated alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin
levels.
Elevations in CA19-9 levels are the most sensitive and specific tumor
marker in cholangiocarcinoma, but this marker is also elevated many
times in concomitant bacterial cholangitis.
Imaging

Ultrasonography and abdominal CT scan are useful in identifying
intrahepatic or extrahepatic ductal dilation, but the primary tumors are
often difficult to visualize.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MRCP may be more sensitive in
identifying the primary tumor.
Diagnostic Procedures

ERCP or PTC provides direct imaging of the biliary system and can
define the extent of tumor spread.
During ERCP, tissue diagnosis can be made using bile cytology, cytologic
brushings, or cholangioscopic biopsies.
Biopsies obtained through percutaneous or transluminal means are not
recommended because of the danger of tumor seeding.
Regional lymph node sampling can also be done during EUS in earlystage disease to evaluate for surgical resectability or liver
transplantation.
EUS can also be used to obtain a fine-needle aspirate for cytology in
patients with unsuccessful ERCP or those who have had negative brush
cytology results.
The histologic diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma may be challenging,
because many tumors are well differentiated and occur in the setting of
PSC.

TREATMENT
Surgical resection represents the only option for long-term survival.
Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are uniformly ineffective in
prolonging survival.
Surgical Management

485

Distal extrahepatic and intrahepatic tumors are more likely to be
resectabe than proximal extrahepatic tumors.
A high recurrence rate is seen for patients after resection, and adjuvant
chemoradiation has not been shown to improve survival.
Liver transplantation combined with neoadjuvant chemoradiation has led
to increased survival rates in patients with locally unresectable cancer
with otherwise normal hepatic and biliary function and patients with a
history of PSC.
Palliative Management

Patients who have unresectable tumors are usually offered ERCP with
stent placement versus percutaneous biliary drainage.
This has replaced palliative biliary-enteric anastomosis in most centers.
Recent preliminary reports of other palliative treatments (e.g.,
photodynamic therapy) have been encouraging, but more studies are
needed.

OUTCOME/PROGNOSIS
Median survival for resectable tumors is 3 years but only 1 year if
unresectable.
Death usually results from recurrent biliary sepsis or liver abscess
formation.

487

Many gastrointestinal diseases have known causative mutations and
testing is available for clinical use (Table 24-1).
Identification of familial cancer syndromes provides the opportunity for
early detection and prevention. A familial form of cancer is suspected in
the following setting: 1
Early age of diagnosis
Synchronous or metachronous tumors
Multiple primary tumor types
Family history of the same cancer type in one or more first-degree
relatives
High rate of cancer occurrence in a family
Associated congenital anomalies or known phenotypic syndromes
Genetic counseling should be offered to all patients before testing due to
potential psychological impact and possibility of insurance or
employment discrimination in the event of a positive test result.
In addition to determining risk for heritable diseases, genetic testing is
also used to determine polymorphisms that can guide pharmacotherapy.

HEREDITARY DIFFUSE GASTRIC CANCER

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Genetics

488

Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant
inherited form of diffuse type gastric cancer.
HDGC is associated with germ line truncating mutations in the gene
E-cadherin (CDH1), resulting in defective intercellular adhesion.
Lifetime cumulative risk for advanced gastric cancer is 40% to 70% in
men and 60% to 80% in women, with 38 years as the average age of
onset.2
Women with HDGC are also at high risk for lobular breast cancer (60%
by age 80), so enhanced breast cancer screening is recommended.
CDH1 gene mutation is suspected in the following settings:
Diffuse gastric cancer at age 50
Any gastric cancer at age 40
Multiple cases in on family
Suggestive pathology on biopsy—in situ signet ring cells or pagetoid
spread of signet ring cells adjacent to diffuse type gastric cancer

DIAGNOSIS

Genetic Testing

Genetic testing is commercially available and consists of direct gene
sequencing of peripheral blood to identify a specific mutation in an
affected individual. Subsequently mutation-specific assays may be
performed on at-risk family members. Mutations are identified in 25% to
50% of families.

489

TREATMENT
There are no reliable screening tests for carriers of germ line mutation of
CDH1 to allow early diagnosis of diffuse gastric cancer, as endoscopic
visualization fails to identify early-stage disease and random biopsies
may miss focal advanced lesions.
490

Prophylactic total gastrectomy is often recommended in early
twenties or 5 years earlier than the youngest family member who
developed gastric cancer.
Women in HDGC families are at high risks of developing lobular breast
cancer, and are recommended for enhanced breast cancer
screening.

PEUTZ–JEGHERS SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Genetics

Peutz–Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is an autosomal dominant disease of
multiple hamartomatous polyps in the gastrointestinal tract associated
with mucocutaneous pigmentation.
The genetic defect is in a gene encoding a serine threonine kinase
(LKB1 or STK11), which is proposed to function as a tumor suppressor.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Manifestations

Patients with PJS manifest melanin spots, appearing as blue-gray to
brown lesions on the lips and perioral region (94%), hands (74%),
buccal mucosa (66%), and feet (62%). Pigmentations appear in infancy
and regress after puberty, with exception of buccal lesions.
Hamartomatous polyps are most commonly in small intestine, but can
also be found in stomach, colon, and rectum. They are unique in that
they contain a proliferation of smooth muscle extending into the lamina
propria in a tree-like fashion with normal overlying mucosa.
Polyps may lead to obstruction, intussusception, infarction, and bleeding.
Patients with PJS are at increased risk for malignancy of the
491

gastrointestinal tract, most commonly colon cancer, followed by
pancreas, stomach, and small bowel.
Women are at increased risk for gynecological cancers such as breast,
ovary, and cervical cancers.
Young men are at increased risk for sertoli cell testicular tumors.
Genetic Testing

Genetic testing on blood samples is commercially available through
several laboratories and LKB1 mutations can be identified in about 80%
of families with PJS.3
Genetic testing is offered starting at age 8, as up to 30% to 40% of
patients may start to develop complications such as bowel obstruction by
age 10.

TREATMENT
Regular surveillance of affected individuals aims to detect cancers of
the breast, colon, pancreas, stomach, small bowel, ovaries, uterus,
cervix, and testicles.
Upper endoscopy, colonoscopy, small bowel video capsule endoscopy
every 2 to 3 years starting age 8.4
Endoscopic ultrasound, CT and/or CA 19–9 every 1 or 2 years starting
age 25 to screen for pancreatic cancer.
Women require pelvic examination with Papanicolaou smear,
mammography, breast MRI, transvaginal ultrasound, and CA-125 starting
age 25.
Men require testicular exams.
Screening and clinical examination for at-risk first-degree relatives should
start at birth.

LYNCH SYNDROME

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

492

Genetics

Lynch syndrome or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC)
is an autosomal dominant disorder, representing the most common
familial colorectal cancer (CRC) syndrome. It also accounts for 2% to 6%
of all CRC.
Up to 75% of patients with Lynch syndrome develop CRC by age 65, with
average age of cancer diagnosis being 45 years. 5
Lynch syndrome is also associated with extracolonic cancers, including
endometrial, ovarian, stomach, small bowel, pancreatic, hepatobiliary,
renal pelvis, and ureter cancers.
Lynch syndrome is the result of dysfunction in DNA mismatch repair
(MMR) enzymes. Germ line mutations of MLH1 or MSH2 account for
90% of Lynch syndrome cases. MSH6 and PMS2 are additional clinically
relevant MMR genes.
MMR gene mutations lead to accumulation of abnormalities in
microsatellites of growth regulatory genes, leaving cells vulnerable to
accumulating mutations that promote development of cancer.

DIAGNOSIS

Clinical Presentation

It is important to identify individuals with Lynch syndrome, which lacks
an easy to identify phenotype, as surveillance decreases the incidence of
CRC and associated death.
Diagnosis is based on criteria in Amsterdam I and Amsterdam II as well
as Bethesda guidelines (Table 24-2).
Genetic Testing

Direct sequencing of MMR gene to look for germ line mutation is
expensive and may lead to discovery of variants of uncertain
significance. 6
When Lynch syndrome is suspected, immunohistochemistry (IHC)
493

testing on tumor or polypectomy specimen is performed to identify loss
of expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is another useful test to identify
patients with Lynch syndrome. It is measured by PCR of tumor tissue.
Greater than 90% of HNPCC-associated tumors have high level of microsatellite instability (MSI-H), whereas sporadic CRC usually have low level
of MSI. Therefore, MSI-H should prompt further testing for Lynch
syndrome.
Up to 15% of sporadic CRC can have MSI-H, which is associated with
494

epigenetic inactivation of MLH1 by methlyation or BRAF mutation.
Therefore, MLH1 hypermethylation or BRAF mutation can exclude Lynch
syndrome in MSI-H tumors.
IHC and MSI analysis have similar sensitivity and prove
complementary to maximize the sensitivity in identifying Lynch
syndrome. Choice of testing may depend on the expertise of the
pathology department.
Once IHC has determined which gene is most likely to be mutated, or
MSI-H is found in the tumor suggesting possible MMR mutation, germ
line mutational analysis is performed on the proband by gene sequencing
and deletion analysis. Positive test confirms the diagnosis, but in some
families a specific mutation is not identified.

TREATMENT
Enhanced cancer surveillance is recommended for those who carry
MMR gene mutation or if there is a strong suspicion for Lynch syndrome
based on family history or testing for IHC or MSI.
Annual colonoscopy starting at age 20 to 25 or 10 years prior to the
earliest age of colon cancer diagnosis in the family.
Upper endoscopy every 1 to 2 years can be considered beginning at
age 30 to 35 to screen for gastric cancer.
Screening for small bowel tumors with capsule endoscopy has been
suggested.
Annual screening for endometrial and ovarian cancer starting at age 30
to 35, or 10 years prior to the earliest age of first diagnosis of these
cancers in the family.
Annual urinalysis and cytological examination beginning at age 25 to 35.
Total colectomy or subtotal colectomy with continued surveillance of
remaining rectum is recommended for those who develop CRC or
advanced adenomas, as there is high incidence of synchronous or
metachronous cancers.
Primary prophylactic surgery is generally not recommended.

FAMILIAL ADENOMATOUS POLYPOSIS

495

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Genetics

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant
disease characterized by 100 or more colorectal adenomas.
Risk of colon cancer in classic FAP approaches 100% by age 35 to 40. 7
It is the most common inherited polyposis syndrome, with prevalence of
1 of 5000 to 7500.
Patients with FAP usually develop symptoms after puberty, and polyposis
is diagnosed by an average age of 36, with death from cancer at age 42.
CRC develops 10 to 15 years from the onset of polyposis.
The genetic basis for disease is germ line loss of function in APC gene
on chromosome 5q21–q22, which leads to cellular resistance to
apoptosis and chromosomal instability, predisposing the cell to
tumorigenesis.
More than 800 mutations in the APC gene have been associated with
FAP, with almost all mutations resulting in protein truncation.
One-third of patients have no family history of the disease, many
representing sporadic germ line mutations.
Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP) is a variant of
FAP in which patients have fewer polyps (>20 for diagnosis), later onset
of polyp development and cancer, and infrequent rectal involvement,
with 75% of tumors occurring in the proximal colon. Adenomas are often
flat rather than polyploid.
Although it is also due to APC gene mutation, it may not be detected by
available testing.
Mutations in base excision repair gene mutY homolog (MUTYH) leads to
recessive inheritance of a variant form of FAP called MUTYHassociated polyposis.
Testing is available for MUTYH mutations in those with polyposis but
lacking APC mutation and those with apparent autosomal recessive
pattern inheritance.

DIAGNOSIS
496

Genetic Testing

Commercial blood tests are available for APC mutations, although they
do not detect all mutations that cause FAP.
APC gene sequencing should be performed on an affected family member
with polyposis phenotype to determine if a mutation is found.
If mutation is present, other at-risk family members may be screened for
the same mutation.
Genetic screening for children should start at age 10 to 12.

TREATMENT

Screening and Management

Gene carriers, at-risk family members who did not undergo genetic
testing, or whose genetic testing is uninformative should be offered
annual screening starting age 10 to 12.
Classic FAP may be screened with sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy,
whereas AFAP requires colonoscopy given predominance of right-sided
tumors.
Colectomy should be performed when polyposis is diagnosed. The
preferred procedure is total proctocolectomy with ileoanal anastomosis.
Because adenomas or cancers can still arise from the ileal pouch,
continued annual surveillance of the ileal pouch, rectal cuff and
anastomosis by endoscopy is required.
Management of Extracolonic Tumors Associated with FAP

Patients with FAP are also at risk for duodenal ampullary carcinoma,
follicular and papillary thyroid cancer, childhood hepatoblastoma, gastric
carcinomas, and CNS tumors (mostly medulloblastomas).
Gastric polyps occur in 30% to 50% of cases, but most are nonneoplastic, characterized by hyperplasia of fundic glands without
epithelial dysplasia.
The lifetime risk of duodenal adenoma approaches 100%, and duodenal
497

and ampullary adenocarcinoma has become the leading cause of death
in FAP patients who have undergone prophylactic colectomy.
The second and third portion of the duodenum and especially the
periampullary region are the most commonly affected areas. Polyps may
cause biliary obstruction.
Surveillance for duodenal polyps should include baseline examination
with both forward and side-viewing upper endoscopy at the time of
colectomy or early in the third decade of life, with repeat screening in 3
to 5 years.
Patients with a history of duodenal polyps should undergo surveillance
endoscopy on the basis of the Spigelman stage of duodenal polyps
(Table 24-3). 8
Surveillance can be performed every 2 to 3 years for stage I and II, and
every 6 to 12 months for stage III and IV.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Gardner’s Syndrome

Gardner’s syndrome includes the same genetic lesions (APC gene) and
gastrointestinal manifestations as FAP and is distinguished by
prominence of extraintestinal lesions including desmoid tumors,
498

sebaceous or epidermoid cysts, lipomas, osteomas (particularly of the
mandible), supernumerary teeth, gastric polyps, and juvenile
nasopharyngeal angiofibromas.
More than 90% of patients with Gardner’s syndrome have congenital
hypertrophy of the retinal pigmented epithelium (CHRPE).
Consisting of pigmented ocular fundic lesions, CHRPE is present in only
5% of controls; therefore, this examination finding is highly suggestive of
gene carriage of adenomatous polyposis, especially when present
bilaterally in patients with a positive family history.
Desmoid tumors or diffuse mesenteric fibromatosis is found in 4%
to 20% of FAP patients and can lead to intestinal obstruction or
constriction of the mesenteric vasculature or uterus.
Desmoid tumors frequently develop in areas of previous surgical
procedures such as colectomy or ceasarian section. Desmoid tumors can
prove a lethal complication, ranking second behind metastatic disease in
patients with FAP. There is no proven treatment or prevention strategy.
Turcot’s Syndrome

Turcot’s syndrome refers to the association between brain tumors
and FAP or HNPCC. There is no directly established mechanism for the
development of brain tumors with the mutations that lead to colorectal
cancer.
Mutations to APC tend to be associated with medulloblastomas.
Mutations in mismatch repair genes are typically associated with
glioblastoma.

HEREDITARY HEMOCHROMATOSIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Genetics

Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is an inherited disorder of
increased intestinal iron absorption resulting in systemic iron
499

overload.
HH is due to mutations in the HFE gene on chromosome 6 or rarely other
genes (hemojuvelin, hepcidin, ferrportin, transferring receptor-2).
Fifty percent to 100% of patients with HH are homozygous for C282Y
among patients of European ancestry.9
Although 3 of 1000 people are homozygous for C282Y, there is variable
disease penetrance.
Patients may also be homozygous for the H63D mutation, heterozygous
for C282Y or H63D or compound heterozygotes.
Of the patients with phenotypic HH, 5% to 11% are compound
heterozygotes, with overall decreased iron overload compared with
C282Y homozygotes.
Approximately 1.5% of patients with HFE gene defects are homozygotes
for H63D, but it is unclear if this leads to significant iron overload.
Three percent to 10% of patients with phenotypic HH are heterozygotes
for either C282Y or H63D, with the development of iron overload likely
explained by the presence of additional mutations.

DIAGNOSIS

Genetic Testing

Early detection of disease can allow treatment, preventing the late
consequences of iron overload including cirrhosis, hepatocellular
carcinoma, diabetes mellitus, and cardiomyopathy.
Testing for HFE gene mutation should be performed on patients with a
clinical iron overload state, that is, transferrin saturation >45% and/or
elevated ferritin.
First-degree relatives of patients with symptomatic HH benefit from
screening, which includes transferrin saturation, ferritin, and HFE gene
mutation.
Optimal timing of screening is between 18 and 30 years of age, when
hemochromatosis is evident by iron tests, but prior to onset of end-organ
damage.
Many patients with HFE gene mutations may not develop organ damage
or require treatment, but should be monitored with yearly examination
500

and iron studies.

HEREDITARY PANCREATITIS

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Hereditary pancreatitis typically presents as acute pancreatitis in
childhood or early adolescence, chronic pancreatitis in late adolescence
or early adulthood, and patients are at risk for pancreatic cancer later in
life.
Autosomal dominant hereditary pancreatitis is usually caused by
mutations in the serine protease 1 gene (PRSS1) on chromosome 7q35,
which encodes cationic trypsin. 10 One-third of patients with PRSS1associated hereditary pancreatitis develop pancreatic insufficiency and/or
diabetes mellitus.
Autosomal recessive pancreatitis is most commonly associated with
cystic fibrosis (CFTR gene mutation).
Mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 gene (SPINK1)
also result in autosomal recessive or complex genetic pattern of
inherited pancreatitis.
Both CFTR and SPINK1 code for molecules that protect the pancreas from
active trypsin.
Genetic testing can be performed on those with a suggestive family
history, unexplained pancreatitis in a child, or unexplained recurrent
acute or chronic pancreatitis in older patients.

OTHER USES OF GENETIC TESTING

INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE AND TPMT

General Principles

501

Azathiaprine (AZA) and 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) are successfully used in
patients with inflammatory bowel disease for inducing and maintaining
remission, and as steroid sparing agents.
AZA is metabolized to 6-MP, which is then metabolized to 6-thioguanine
(6-TG) and 6-methylmercaptopurine (6-MMP) through the enzyme
thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). 6-TG and 6-MMP are related to the
bone marrow and liver toxicities, respectively.
TPMT enzyme activity is a major determining factor of 6-MP metabolism
and its toxicity.
Genetic Polymorphisms of TPMT

Approximately 89% of population has wild-type TPMT genotype, which is
associated with normal TPMT enzyme activity. Eleven percent of
population is heterozygous for TPMT and has intermediate TPMT enzyme
activity. About 0.3% of population is homozygous for TPMT mutant
alleles, and has almost no TPMT enzyme activity, which leads to high 6TG levels and bone marrow toxicity in patients taking AZA or 6-MP.
Testing for genetic polymorphisms to determine the TPMT genotype
before initiating therapy with thiopurines can identify patients with low
or absent TPMT activity.
Patients with homozygous mutant alleles are not candidates for therapy
with AZA or 6-MP.
TPMT genotypes correlate with enzyme activity or phenotype, which may
be determined directly by RBC assay. Testing of TPMT enzyme activity
can be confounded by recent blood transfusion or concomitant
medications. Empiric dosing of thiopurines may be initiated on the basis
of TPMT enzyme activity level, such that the lower the enzyme activity,
the lower the dose of AZA or 6-MP. For example, patients with
intermediate TPMT enzyme activity may be dosed with AZA 1.0 to 1.5
mg/kg/day rather than 2.0 to 2.5 mg/kg/day.
It is important to note that regardless of TPMT genotype or phenotype,
monitoring of blood cell counts and liver function tests are still required,
as normal TPMT screening testing does not preclude development of
adverse drug reactions.
Thiopurine Metabolite Monitoring

Metabolite monitoring is also useful in guiding therapy. 11
502

6-TG levels between 230 and 400 may correlate with clinical response to
AZA or 6-MP, whereas levels >400 may correlate with bone marrow
suppression.
6-MMP levels >5700 may correlate with liver toxicity.
Determining metabolite levels can also help distinguish patients who are
non-compliant from those who are underdosed, resistant to treatment,
or refractory to therapy with thiopurines.

CELIAC DISEASE

General Principles

Celiac disease is characterized by a chronic inflammatory response to
gluten in small bowel mucosa in genetically susceptible individuals. See
Chapter 14 for further details.
In the United States, the prevalence is approximately 1%.
Genetics

Celiac disease is associated with HLA DQ2 and DQ8, which are necessary
but not sufficient to produce the celiac phenotype.
Diagnosis
Genetic Testing

HLA typing, a commercially available blood test, can be useful in the
diagnosis of celiac disease when patients are already on a gluten-free
diet without a confirmed diagnosis. The absence of HLA DQ2 or DQ8
essentially rules out celiac disease. 12

The ability to perform endoscopic procedures has radically changed the
practice of gastroenterology.
Endoscopy allows for direct visual inspection, tissue sampling, and
minimally invasive therapeutic intervention. An endoscopic procedure is
worth performing if the benefit for the patient exceeds the risks by a
sufficiently wide margin.
Preparation for endoscopy involves addressing important issues specific
to each patient, such as assessing contraindications and relative
contraindications, medication allergies, patient medications, and possible
interactions with medicines used for sedation. In addition, the presence
of coagulopathy, comorbid factors, and conditions potentially requiring
antibiotic prophylaxis must be considered. Furthermore, each patient, or
a designated guardian, should understand the benefits and risks
associated with the procedure, and informed consent must be obtained
before the procedure is initiated.
General indications for endoscopic procedures are listed in Table 25-1.

UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL ENDOSCOPY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) allows high-resolution visual
inspection of the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus to
the second or third portion of the duodenum.

505

DIAGNOSIS
EGD is performed for various indications, such as
diagnosis and management of abdominal pain or upper GI bleeding;
screening and diagnosis of esophageal or gastric malignancies;
surveillance of premalignant conditions such as Barrett’s esophagus;
application of endoscopic eradication therapies for management of
Barrett’s esophagus–associated dysplasia and early esophageal
adenocarcinoma; and
palliation of dysphagia resulting from both malignant and benign
causes.
Procedure

At most institutions, examinations are performed using topical
anesthetics applied to the oropharynx in combination with
intravenous (IV) conscious sedation.
Monitored anesthesia care can be used with assistance from an
anesthesiologist when conscious sedation is anticipated to be
unsuccessful.
The only patient preparation required is to avoid oral intake for ≥6
hours before the procedure.

506

TREATMENT
Various instruments may be passed through the therapeutic channel of
the endoscope for use in tissue biopsy, medication delivery,
cauterization, clip application, enteral stenting, and application of
endoscopic eradication therapies.

COMPLICATIONS
Endoscopy has a small risk of complications, overall estimated to occur in
0.1% having the procedure. 1, 2
Significant bleeding has been reported in 0.025% to 0.15%.
Perforation has been reported in 0.02% to 0.2%.
Cardiorespiratory complications, mostly attributed to premedication
or sedation, can occur in 0.05% to 0.73% of patients.
The risk of mortality as a result of upper endoscopy has been estimated
to range from 0.005% to 0.04%.

COLONOSCOPY
507

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Colonoscopy is performed to examine the colonic and terminal ileal
mucosa.

DIAGNOSIS
Colonoscopy is performed for various indications, including
evaluation and treatment of overt lower GI bleeding;
evaluation of iron-deficiency anemia;
screening and surveillance of colorectal cancer and polyps;
diagnosis and cancer surveillance in inflammatory bowel disease;
palliative treatment of stenosing or bleeding neoplasms; and
evaluation of clinically significant diarrhea of unexplained origin.
Procedure

As with EGD, colonoscopy almost always involves the use of IV
conscious sedation or monitored anesthesia.
Colon preparation is required before the procedure. This usually
involves a lavage or purgative method used on the day or evening before
the patient’s colonoscopy.
Polyethylene glycol preparations are preferred (GoLYTELY or
MiraLax) to phospho-soda–based preparations which may lead to
electrolyte derangements and renal failure.

TREATMENT
Various instruments may be passed through the therapeutic channel of
the endoscope for use in tissue biopsy, cauterization or fulguration of
tissue, polypectomy, and colonic stent placement.

COMPLICATIONS
508

Colonoscopy has a small risk of complications, 1,2 estimated to occur in
0.1% to 1.9% of patients having the procedure.
Significant bleeding can be seen in up to 1.9% of patients. The rate of
bleeding complications seen with therapeutic colonoscopy is roughly
double than that seen with diagnostic colonoscopy.
Perforation can occur in up to 0.4% of patients. Surgical consultation
should be obtained in the event of suspected perforation; however, if
possible, attempts to close the defect with hemoclips should be made.
Cardiorespiratory complications, which are also a concern, are
mostly attributed to the sedation used during the procedure.
Mortality has been reported in up to 0.06% of patients.

FLEXIBLE SIGMOIDOSCOPY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Flexible sigmoidoscopy involves a shorter examination compared with
colonoscopy and is used to examine the distal colon up to the splenic
flexure.

DIAGNOSIS
Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally used for evaluation of
suspected distal colonic disease when colonoscopy is not indicated;
anastomotic recurrence in rectosigmoid carcinoma; and
exclusion of infection or immune-mediated processes (e.g., graft-versushost disease) in certain patient subsets, including those with
inflammatory bowel disease or following bone marrow transplantation.
Procedure

This examination is usually performed without sedation, which adds
the advantages of decreased cost; fewer complications associated with
sedation; and decreased lost work time for the patient.
509

This procedure also eliminates the need for a complete colon
preparation. Two enemas given a few hours before the procedure are
usually adequate preparation.

TREATMENT
As above for colonoscopy.

COMPLICATIONS
Complications of flexible sigmoidoscopy are similar to those listed above
under colonoscopy.
The overall risk of perforation during flexible sigmoidoscopy is low
(0.01%).

SMALL BOWEL ENTEROSCOPY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

Since standard upper GI endoscopy is limited to the proximal duodenum,
longer endoscopes are needed to examine the upper GI tract beyond the
ligament of Treitz.
Two types of enteroscopes developed for this purpose are the push
enteroscope and the single- or double-balloon enteroscope.3
Instead of a dedicated push enteroscope, a small caliber colonoscope
(pediatric colonoscope) can also be used for push enteroscopy.
Sonde enteroscopy, a procedure involving a long, thin endoscope
advanced by small bowel peristalsis, is no longer in use.
Capsule enteroscopy is currently being used in many settings as a
means to visualize segments of the bowel previously inaccessible to
endoscopy.

DIAGNOSIS

510

Small bowel enteroscopy is performed for evaluation of obscure
(occult or overt) GI bleeding.
It is also indicated for diagnosis and treatment of small bowel
polyps and masses.
Procedure

Push enteroscopes are 160 to 240 cm in length and can be used for
therapeutic intervention. They allow for controlled insertion and
withdrawal.
Push enteroscopy is traditionally used after a negative upper endoscopy
and colonoscopy.
The yield of push enteroscopy in this setting is approximately 60%.
Balloon enteroscopy utilizes single or double inflatable balloons on the
end of the endoscope and an accompanying overtube to grip the
intestinal wall and allow deep cannulation of the small bowel.
Both transoral and transanal approaches can be used and often the
entire length of the small bowel can be examined when both approaches
are used in combination.
This form of enteroscopy allows biopsy or treatment of lesions noted
beyond the reach of push enteroscopes and is replacing intraoperative
enteroscopy in some centers.
Capsule enteroscopy visualizes segments of the bowel previously
inaccessible to endoscopy.
The patient swallows a capsule that contains a camera, light source,
battery, and radio transmitter.
As the capsule traverses the GI tract, it takes pictures and transmits
these images to a receiver that the patient wears on the belt. The
capsule takes 8 hours of images, usually sufficient time to traverse the
ileocecal valve.
The images are then loaded onto a computer where they can be viewed
in a movie format at up to 25 frames per second.
The current indications for capsule endoscopy include evaluation of
obscure GI bleeding and persistent occult GI bleeding.
The major contraindication is the presence of intestinal strictures which
can obstruct passage of the capsule. 4,5

511

TREATMENT
While capsule endoscopy is only a diagnostic procedure, small bowel
enteroscopy using push enteroscopes and single/double balloon
enteroscopes not only provides diagnosis but also allows tissue
acquisition, resection of polyps, and ablation of vascular lesions.

COMPLICATIONS
These are similar to that seen with endoscopic procedures described
above.
The main complication associated with capsule endoscopy is
capsule retention, rates of which are dependent on the indication of
the procedure. Capsule retention frequently occurs in the area of
pathology in the small bowel.
Intestinal obstruction from a retained capsule is a rare complication,
frequently requiring surgical intervention when it occurs.

ENDOSCOPIC RETROGRADE
CHOLANGIOPANCREATOGRAPHY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is performed
using a specially designed endoscope that involves a side-viewing
imaging system.
This system allows direct visualization of the major and minor papillae
and facilitates insertion of devices into the desired duct.

DIAGNOSIS
With the advent of improved cross-sectional imaging technology with
512

computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance
cholangiopancreatography, the role of diagnostic ERCP had diminished
considerably.
ERCP is used predominantly for the evaluation and management of
choledocholithiasis, especially in the presence of biliary obstruction or
cholangitis;
benign and malignant biliary strictures;
bile leak;
suspected sphincter of Oddi dysfunction, frequently combined with
sphincter manometry;
pancreatic duct leak;
complications of acute and chronic pancreatitis such as pancreatic duct
disruption, strictures, and stones; and
resection of ampullary adenomas.
Procedure

An ERCP can be used effectively in detecting and treating
choledocholithiasis. Sphincterotomy may be performed at the time
of stone removal to reduce the chance of recurrent choledocholithiasis.
ERCP may also be used therapeutically to dilate benign and
malignant strictures in the biliary tree with or without subsequent
stent placement.
Brushings for cytology may also be obtained during ERCP to assist in
the diagnosis of cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic neoplasms.
Palliation of jaundice in patients with pancreatic and biliary
malignancies can be achieved by placement of self-expanding metallic
stents.

TREATMENT
Various devices can be passed through the working channel of the
duodenoscope to achieve access and cannulation of the common bile
duct and pancreatic duct, sphincterotomy, balloon dilation, tissue
biopsies and brushings, biliary and pancreatic stenting, stone extraction,
and biliary/pancreatic manometry.

513

COMPLICATIONS
The ERCP procedure is associated with all the risks of upper
endoscopy. 6
Approximately 5% to 7% of patients develop postprocedural
pancreatitis. This is usually mild and self-limited; however, in a small
percentage of cases, this can be life threatening.
The incidence is higher in patients with suspected sphincter of Oddi
dysfunction.

ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASONOGRAPHY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) allows for high-resolution imaging of the
luminal GI tract combining endoscopic visualization and high-frequency
ultrasound. It uses higher frequencies than transabdominal ultrasound
and provides resolution of the GI tract wall into distinct layers that
correlate closely with histology.

DIAGNOSIS
EUS has become widely accepted as an effective modality in evaluating
lesions in the GI tract, mediastinum, and other organs such as the left
adrenal gland and the liver. 7
EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) provides clinically
important diagnostic and prognostic information including cytologic
confirmation of the presence (or absence) of malignancy and metastasis
to secondary sites.
The most common indications of EUS-guided FNA include
evaluation of
pancreatic masses;
mediastinal and intra-abdominal lymphadenopathy;
514

liver masses;
left adrenal masses; and
GI submucosal lesions.
EUS-guided FNA has supplanted CT-guided biopsy and ERCP in the
diagnosis of pancreatic cancer.
EUS is the most sensitive imaging study for the diagnosis of chronic
pancreatitis and choledocholithiasis.
EUS is also an adjunctive tool in the evaluation of patients with fecal
incontinence to assess for internal and external anal sphincter defects.
Procedure

EUS is performed using a specially designed endoscope that involves a
side-viewing imaging system.
The endoscope is passed to different areas in the upper and lower GI
tract allowing for targeted inspection of areas of interest.
The FNA needle can be passed through the working channel of the
endoscope to perform FNA of solid lesions or aspiration of fluid from
pancreatic cysts.

COMPLICATIONS
EUS is associated with all the risks associated with upper
endoscopy including those associated with sedation.
Bacteremia is a rare occurrence after EUS-guided FNA, with an
incidence of approximately 0.4% to 1%.
There is a small risk of pancreatitis (1% to 2%) associated with EUSguided FNA of pancreatic masses.
Bleeding and bile peritonitis as complications of EUS-guided FNA are
rare and described anecdotally in the literature.

LIVER BIOPSY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES

515

Liver biopsy can be achieved by two different techniques:
Percutaneous liver biopsy, performed at the bedside, sometimes with
ultrasound guidance; rarely, it is performed under computed tomographic
guidance.
Transjugular liver biopsy under fluoroscopic guidance.

DIAGNOSIS
Common indications for liver biopsy include evaluation of abnormal
liver chemistries, assessment of degree of inflammation and fibrosis in
chronic liver disease (e.g., hepatitis C), and diagnosis of liver masses. 8
Procedure

Bedside percutaneous liver biopsy is commonly performed by
gastroenterologists or hepatologists.
The patient is placed supine with the right arm behind the head.
With ultrasound guidance or percussion, an appropriate biopsy location
is chosen in the right lateral chest wall, usually near the eighth
intercostal space.
The area is prepared and draped in sterile fashion, and lidocaine is used
to infiltrate the skin, subcutaneous fat, intercostal muscles, and liver
capsule.
A small incision is made, and the liver biopsy needle is advanced to the
liver capsule.
With the patient held in full expiration, the biopsy needle is advanced
into the liver parenchyma, and a core of tissue is obtained.
The patient is then observed closely for at least 4 hours for
complications.
Contraindications to percutaneous liver biopsy include severe
coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, or ascites. 8
If percutaneous liver biopsy cannot be safely performed or if portal
pressure measurements are needed, transjugular liver biopsy under
radiologic guidance may be performed.
Directed biopsy with ultrasound or CT guidance may be necessary for
sampling of liver masses.
516

COMPLICATIONS
Complications of liver biopsy are rare but can be severe.
The most common complication is pain at the biopsy site or in the
right shoulder.
Less common complications are bleeding, pneumothorax,
gallbladder perforation, inadvertent kidney biopsy, or death.
Most complications are apparent within the first 4 to 6 hours, but they
can occur up to 48 hours after biopsy.

PERCUTANEOUS ENDOSCOPIC
GASTROSTOMY/JEJUNOSTOMY

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy/jejunostomy (PEG/PEJ) and
jejunal extension through PEG (PEG-J) tubes are indicated in patients
requiring long-term nutritional support.

DIAGNOSIS
Common indications include oropharyngeal dysphagia secondary to
neurologic conditions, oropharyngeal and laryngeal cancer, esophageal
cancer, and head and facial trauma. 9
Procedure

Enteral feeding through a gastrostomy or jejunostomy has several
advantages over parenteral nutrition such as lower risks of infection,
preservation of gut integrity, and costs.
Percutaneous enterostomies should not be performed in individuals with
rapidly progressive diseases with a short life expectancy or when oral
feeds are expected to resume within 30 days.
517

Other contraindications include coagulopathy, pharyngeal or esophageal
obstruction, inability to achieve apposition of stomach with the
abdominal wall, lack of adequate gastric transillumination due to prior
gastric surgery, ascites, hepatomegaly, and obesity and bowel
obstruction.
The two common techniques of PEG and PEJ include the “pull” and
“push” technique.
PEJ is a modification of PEG and more difficult to perform.
Feeding via the PEG/PEJ is typically initiated the next day or 24 hours
post-procedure.

COMPLICATIONS
Complications include wound infections, bleeding, perforation, ileus,
injury to internal organs, tumor seeding, buried bumper syndrome, and
death.
Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended to reduce the risk of peristomal
wound infection.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

Conscious Sedation

Conscious sedation provides adequate analgesia and sedation for most
GI procedures while allowing the patient to cooperate with verbal
commands.
Conscious sedation for endoscopic procedures usually involves a
benzodiazepine (i.e., midazolam) and an opiate (i.e., meperidine or
fentanyl).
In patients not adequately sedated with this combination, addition of
other IV agents such as promethazine or diphenhydramine can be
considered.
Propofol is an ultrashort-acting sedative, and its use requires the
presence of an anesthesiologist for both the administration of the
drug and airway control. Using propofol results in deep, not conscious,
518

sedation.10
The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) assessment (categories
I to V) is useful in evaluating the sedation risk for a patient.
ASA category I represents the lowest risk.
Advanced age, obesity, pregnancy, sleep apnea, a history of substance
abuse, or severe cardiac, respiratory, hepatic, renal, or central nervous
system disease places patients at higher risk for sedation.
Anesthesia assistance should be considered for patients with ASA class
III and above, for those who have had adverse reaction or inadequate
response to moderate sedation, for patients who take opiates
chronically, and for lengthy or complex endoscopic procedures.
The ASA guidelines state that patients should fast a minimum of 2 hours
after consumption of clear liquids and 6 hours after consuming light
meals before the administration of sedation.
The most common sedation complications include airway obstruction and
respiratory depression, oversedation, hypoxia, and hypotension. Patients
are monitored during the procedure using continuous pulse oximetry,
heart monitoring, intermittent blood pressure recordings, and in some
situations, end-tidal CO2. These parameters are supplemental to vigilant
clinical observation of the patient.
Antibiotic Prophylaxis for Endoscopy

Mucosal trauma during GI endoscopy can result in bacterial translocation
of microbial flora into the bloodstream. Bacteremia as a result of this
carries a risk of localization of infection in remote tissues (e.g., infective
endocarditis). Endoscopy can also contaminate a sterile space or tissue
by an endoscopic accessory or by contrast injection.
Bacterial endocarditis is a potentially life-threatening infection.
Approximately 4% of patients develop bacteremia associated with
endoscopy, but this varies depending on the specific procedure
performed.
Although infective endocarditis is a potentially life-threatening infection,
this has rarely been reported post-GI endoscopy. There are no data
demonstrating a causal link between endoscopic procedures and
infective endocarditis.
Similarly, there are no data that demonstrate that antibiotic prophylaxis
before endoscopic procedures protects against infective endocarditis.
519

The guidelines for antibiotic prophylaxis for GI endoscopy were recently
updated by the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy and
have been highlighted in Table 25-2.11 These recommendations are in
accordance with the recommendations of the American Heart
Association.
Antibiotic prophylaxis solely to prevent infective endocarditis is no longer
recommended before endoscopic procedures.
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be administered in patients undergoing
ERCP for biliary obstruction in whom complete drainage may not be
achieved (hilar stricture and primary sclerosing cholangitis) and in
patients with communicating pancreatic cysts or pseudocysts and prior to
transpapillary or transmural drainage of pseudocysts. Antibiotic
prophylaxis is routinely recommended prior to EUS-guided FNA of cystic
lesions along the GI tract.
Antibiotics should be administered in all patients prior to placement of
PEG/PEJ tube and in all cirrhotic patients admitted with GI bleeding.
Anticoagulation and Antiplatelet Agents

Patients on chronic anticoagulation (warfarin, heparin, and lowmolecular-weight heparin), antiplatelet agents [aspirin, non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), thienopyridines (clopidogrel)], and
glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors requiring GI procedures pose a
challenging problem.
Ideally, the platelet count should be >50,000 and INR should be
1.5 prior to endoscopic procedures.
The three issues that should be considered include
risk of bleeding from antithrombotic therapy;
risk of bleeding from an endoscopic intervention in the setting of
antithrombotic medication use; and
risk of thromboembolic event from interruption of antithrombotic
therapy.

520

Management of antithrombotic agents is based on the risk of the GI
procedure (low vs. high risk), indication for use of antithrombotic
agent (low vs. high risk for thromboembolic event), and indication of
procedure (elective vs. emergent).
Low risk GI procedures include all diagnostic procedures including
ERCP without sphincterotomy and EUS without FNA.
High-risk procedures include polypectomy, sphincterotomy, stricture
dilation, PEG, and EUS-guided FNA.
The guidelines for management of anticoagulation and antiplatelet
therapy for GI endoscopy were recently updated by the American Society
for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. 12 The salient recommendations from this
guideline are as follows:
Aspirin and/or NSAIDs may be continued for all endoscopic
procedures. If discontinued prior to high-risk procedures, they should be
521

held for 5 to 7 days prior to the procedure.
Patients with a recently placed vascular stent or acute coronary
syndrome should have elective procedures deferred until administration
of antithrombotic therapy for minimum recommended duration has been
completed. Any changes to the antithrombotic regimen should be based
on consultation with the patient’s cardiologist.
Patients on clopidogrel or ticlopidine alone or in combination with
aspirin should be on aspirin during the periendoscopic period. If these
medications need to be held, patients need to be off clopidogrel or
ticlopidine for 7 to 10 days prior to endoscopy.
While anticoagulation can be held in patients with low risk of
thromboembolic events (e.g., lone atrial fibrillation, bioprosthetic valve,
deep vein thrombosis), patients at high risk (e.g., atrial fibrillation
associated with comorbid conditions, coronary stent within 1 year, acute
coronary syndrome, mechanical mitral valve) should be bridged with
low-molecular-weight heparin or unfractionated heparin.
Warfarin should be held for 3 to 5 days, low-molecular-weight
heparin for 12 to 24 hours, and unfractionated heparin for 4 to 6
hours prior to the procedure.
Consensus regarding resumption of anticoagulant therapy after
endoscopic intervention is lacking and should be based on procedure
details and indications for anticoagulation.
For patients with acute bleeding who require endoscopic therapy,
antiplatelet and anticoagulants should be held until hemostasis is
achieved and attempts should be made to correct any coagulopathy
using a combination of fresh-frozen plasma, vitamin K, and platelets.

Preface

It can be difficult for the contemporary medical student to gain a true insight into the
careers of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists when some Foundation Schools provide as
little as eight weeks’ training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology. With an ever increasing
and overwhelming body of medical knowledge, it is difficult enough to grasp a basic
academic knowledge let alone be expected to gain important clinical experience in
such a short period of time. This is compounded by the fact that O&G has medical,
surgical and obstetric components all requiring different skills and thought processes.
Learning from reference texts may allow the student to memorise the facts but not
necessarily how to assimilate these facts in a clinical setting.
This book presents the theory of O&G in a more clinically orientated manner, as the
patient would present in the real life situation, that is, by symptoms. This should
focus the student to help develop an insight into the thought processes that will be
necessary when they start seeing and managing patients. A good clinical history will
focus on relevant positives and negatives and provide a differential diagnosis on which
to base relevant investigations and Part one is written with this in mind. Part two is
presented with a focus on disease processes and provides insight into the diagnosis
and management of common disorders. The use of algorithms, diagrams, ‘Hints
and Tips’ boxes and the newly introduced ‘Communication’ boxes gives a clearer
understanding of the processes involved in managing patients as well as some of the
more common pitfalls. The text is written not only by consultants but also by registrars
so combining the wisdom of experience with the latest changes in modern practice.
To reflect the latest assessment methods the self-assessment section has been altered
for the second edition. More extended matching questions (EMQ’s) have been added.
These have been shown to better assess the ability of the student to assimilate the
information provided rather than just rely on a good memory, skills that will hopefully
produce a better quality of doctor. Many students see the final MBBS examination
as a huge hurdle. The Crash Course philosophy is to provide the student with the
relevant clinical knowledge and assessment techniques to be better able to overcome
this hurdle with less fear and more confidence.

More than a decade has now passed since work began on the Crash Course series.
Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series relevant for today’s
students is an ongoing process. This second edition builds upon the success of the
preceding books and incorporates a great deal of new and revised material, keeping
the series up to date with the latest medical research and developments in pharmacology and current best practice.
As always, we listen to feedback from the thousands of students who use Crash
Course and have made further improvements to the layout and structure of the books.
Each chapter now starts with a set of learning objectives, and the self-assessment
sections have been enhanced and brought up to date with modern exam formats. We
have also worked to integrate material on communication skills and gems of clinical

wisdom from practising doctors. This will not only add to the interest of the text but
will reinforce the principles being described.
Despite fully revising the books, we hold fast to the principles on which we first
developed the series: Crash Course will always bring you all the information you need
to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate pathology and therapeutics
with best clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance between clarity and
conciseness, and providing sufficient depth for those aiming at distinction. The authors
are junior doctors who have recent experience of the exams you are now facing, and
the accuracy of the material is checked by senior clinicians and faculty members from
across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with abnormal
uterine bleeding
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with abnormal uterine bleeding
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with abnormal uterine
bleeding in order to establish a diagnosis.

Absent Periods
The absence of periods is called amenorrhoea and
can be either:
• p
 rimary, when menstruation has never occurred, or
• s econdary, when menstruation has occurred
but not for at least 6 months.
The causes of amenorrhoea can be broken down into
the following five major categories, which are shown
in greater detail in Fig. 1.1:
•
•
•
•
•

Central nervous system.
Gonadal dysfunction.
Genital tract disorders.
Endocrine disorders.
Drug therapy.

A history of post-pill amenorrhoea
is usually the result of pre-existing
pathology that has been masked by the
COCP.

History
There are so many causes of amenorrhoea that it is
important to focus the history onto the relevant
systems. These can be broadly grouped into five main
areas:
• G
 ynaecological.
• Central nervous system.

 eneral health.
• G
• Drugs.
• Endocrine disorders.

Gynaecological
A full gynaecological history is mandatory. By
definition, menarche will not have occurred in
women with primary amenorrhoea. In women with
secondary amenorrhoea, the timing of menarche and
pubertal development will establish whether this is
normal, precocious or delayed (see Chapters 20 and
32). The duration of amenorrhoea and the presence
of symptoms of pregnancy or the menopause should
be noted (see Chapter 29).
Menstrual irregularity or oligomenorrhoea from
the time of menarche is suggestive of polycystic ovary
syndrome, especially if associated with obesity and
hirsutism. Cyclical pain might indicate congenital or
acquired outflow obstruction to menstrual fluid.
Pituitary failure can occur after massive postpartum
haemorrhage (Sheehan’s syndrome) and so a full
obstetric history should be taken. This should include
early pregnancy loss with subsequent uterine curettage,
which can lead to Ashermann’s syndrome. Relevant
gynaecological surgery includes cervical surgery, which
can cause stenosis and, more obviously, oophorectomy
and hysterectomy.

Central nervous system
A past history of head injury or more recent
symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) tumour
such as headache and vomiting should be elicited.
Visual field disturbance might indicate an expanding

cause amenorrhoea even though these women are fit
and well.

General health

Endocrine disorders

The general health of the patient should be assessed.
Emotional stress, from any cause, can precipitate
amenorrhoea, as can weight loss from dieting,
anorexia nervosa or severe systemic illness. The
reduced peripheral fat stores and body mass index
(BMI) that are commonly seen in female athletes can

Thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus may present
with amenorrhoea and symptoms of these disorders
should be elicited. Hirsutism and virilism may be due
to congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), polycystic
ovary syndrome (PCOS) or an androgen-secreting
tumour of the ovary or adrenal (see Chapter 32).

Drugs

Investigations

Many prescribed drugs can cause amenorrhoea by
producing either hyperprolactinaemia or ovarian
failure, and a detailed drug history should be taken
(see Fig. 19.3)

The following group of investigations should be
performed as indicated:

Examination
A general examination should be performed, with
particular emphasis on looking for signs of thyroid
disease and diabetes mellitus. The BMI should be
calculated (kg divided by m2). Anosmia (absent sense
of smell) is associated with Kallmann’s syndrome.
The typical appearance of Turner’s syndrome should
be apparent; short stature, webbing of the neck,
increased carrying angle at the elbow and coarctation
of the aorta. The presence of galactorrhoea should be
noted.
A full gynaecological examination is mandatory.
Assessment of secondary sexual development must be
made and Tanner’s system was developed to aid this
(see Fig. 1.2). Absent secondary sexual characteristics
might constitute delayed puberty (see Chapter 20).
Incongruous pubertal development might also
suggest underlying pathology. For example, normal
breast development in the absence of pubic or axillary
hair is typically found in women with androgen
insensitivity. Poor breast development with normal
pubic and axillary hair or hirsutism, virilism and
obesity can be signs of raised circulating androgens
secondary to PCOS, and more rarely congenital
adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), adrenal tumours or
androgen-secreting ovarian tumours.
Pelvic examination should assess the patency of
the vagina. If a haematocolpos is present it often
causes a blue-coloured bulge at the introitus. An
enlarged uterus might represent a pregnancy, and
ovarian masses might be palpable.

• C
 hromosomal analysis.
• Hormone profiles.
• I maging studies.

Chromosomal analysis
Chromosomal analysis should be performed
on women with primary amenorrhoea where a
chromosomal abnormality is suspected. Buccal smears
or blood samples can be taken for this purpose.

Hormone profiles
The first hormone test to be performed is a urinary
pregnancy test. This detects the presence of
β-human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) and can
be performed quickly in the outpatient setting.
Serum gonadotrophin levels are important. Levels
of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing
hormone (LH) are greatly raised with ovarian failure,
whereas with ‘hypothalamic’ amenorrhoea or
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism the levels will be
at the lower limits of normal (see Chapter 19 for more
details on hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism). In
PCOS the LH:FSH ratio is usually greater than 2.5.
Serum prolactin levels should be checked to
exclude hyperprolactinaemia. Thyroid stimulating
hormone and free thyroxine levels should be tested if
there is clinical suspicion of thyroid dysfunction or if
hyperprolactinaemia is confirmed.
Serum testosterone levels might be normal or
raised with PCOS, although free testosterone is
usually raised. If serum testosterone levels are very
high then an androgen-secreting tumour of the ovary
or adrenal should be suspected.

Abnormal uterine bleeding

Imaging studies
An ultrasound scan of the pelvis should be
performed. This will identify the typical ultrasound
appearances of polycystic ovaries (enlarged ovaries
with increased central stroma associated with
multiple peripherally sited follicles). The presence
of an intrauterine pregnancy, haematometra or
haematocolpos should also be identified.

A pelvic ultrasound scan
(preferably a transvaginal
scan) is mandatory in the
investigation of abnormal bleeding. Many pathologies
will be missed if it is not performed.

CNS tumours can be excluded where indicated by
performing computed tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scans of the head.

Heavy Periods
Heavy periods are a common gynaecological
complaint. Only about half of women complaining
of heavy periods actually have menorrhagia, which is
defined as more than 80 mL of menstrual blood loss
per period. Both local and systemic conditions can
cause menorrhagia (Fig. 1.3).

History
A full gynaecological history should be taken.
Particular emphasis should be made as to the pattern

of menstruation: irregular menstruation implies
anovulation. Subjective assessment of menstrual flow
does not correlate well with objective menstrual loss.
However, the presence of clots and flooding, wearing
double protection (internal and external), nocturnal
soiling and interference with work or social events,
all imply increased menstrual loss. Symptoms of
iron deficiency anaemia might be present, including
lethargy and breathlessness.
Menstrual pain, or dysmenorrhoea, is often
associated with menorrhagia and it is usually
experienced when the flow is heaviest. Premenstrual
pain can indicate endometriosis, which is discussed
further in Chapter 22. Fever, pelvic pain, dyspareunia
and vaginal discharge are common symptoms of
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID; see Chapter 26).
A history of PCOS increases the risk of endometrial
hyperplasia and carcinoma. Symptoms of thyroid
disease or clotting disorders can indicate a systemic
cause of menorrhagia. Clotting disorders presenting
with menorrhagia usually do so in the teenage years.
A contraceptive history is important. Recent
cessation of the combined oral contraceptive pill
(COCP) might indicate menstrual intolerance (the
return of normal periods that appear heavier than
the withdrawal bleeds associated with the COCP).
Symptoms of heavy or painful periods dating from
the insertion of an intrauterine contraceptive device
(IUCD) would suggest that this is the cause.

Examination
General examination should be aimed at identifying
signs of iron deficiency anaemia, thyroid or clotting
disorders. Abdominal examination might reveal a
mass arising from the pelvis.
Speculum examination could reveal vaginal
discharge and cervical pathology, including cervicitis
or frank malignancy. Occasionally, endometrial polyps
or pedunculated fibroids will be seen prolapsing
through the cervical os. Bimanual examination might
reveal an enlarged uterus due to fibroids, pelvic
tenderness associated with endometriosis or PID and
the presence of adnexal masses.

Investigation
Investigation is aimed at excluding the systemic and
local causes of menorrhagia and includes:
• B
 lood tests.
• Ultrasound.
• Hysteroscopy.

Painful periods
A full blood count should be performed in all cases.
Thyroid function and clotting studies should only be
performed if clinically indicated.
A pelvic ultrasound will identify uterine
enlargement caused by fibroids and adnexal masses.
Endometrial polyps or submucous fibroids should be
suspected if the endometrial thickness is excessive for
the time of the menstrual cycle.
An endometrial biopsy should be performed,
either in the outpatient clinic or at the same time
as hysteroscopy. This might show endometrium
inappropriate to the menstrual cycle secondary to
anovulation, endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.
A cervical smear should be performed if indicated.

Abnormal bleeding before
the age of 40 does not usually
require endometrial sampling
unless the patient is at high risk of endometrial
hyperplasia, e.g. PCOS and increased BMI.

The most effective way of excluding intrauterine
pathology is by diagnostic hysteroscopy. This can be
performed in the outpatient setting with minimal
analgesia and will identify endometrial polyps and
submucous fibroids as well as carcinoma of the
endometrium.

Intermenstrual and
Postcoital Bleeding
Intermenstrual and postcoital bleeding are common
symptoms that can indicate serious underlying
pathology. Intermenstrual bleeding occurs between
the menstrual periods and can be caused by local
lesions of the cervix or intrauterine cavity (Fig. 1.4).
Postcoital bleeding is precipitated by intercourse and
is caused by similar conditions. Investigation should
aim to exclude local causes.

Painful Periods
Pain associated with menstruation is called
dysmenorrhoea and can be either primary or
secondary. There are two definitions of primary and
secondary dysmenorrhoea:

• Primary dysmenorrhoea occurs from menarche,
whereas secondary dysmenorrhoea occurs in
women who previously had painless periods.
• Primary dysmenorrhoea occurs from menarche
but secondary dysmenorrhoea describes painful
periods that are caused by, or are ‘secondary’ to,
pathology.
Severe primary dysmenorrhoea occurs in up to 10%
of women. The cause is not well understood but
prostaglandins, which cause uterine contractions
and vasoconstriction, have been implicated. Rarely,
primary dysmenorrhoea can be caused by a particular
Mullerian abnormality whereby a rudimentary,
functioning uterine horn does not connect with the
vagina (Fig. 1.5).
Secondary dysmenorrhoea can be caused by
conditions occurring in the uterus, cervix and the
pelvis (Fig. 1.6).

History
Dysmenorrhoea is usually described as cramping
pain that often radiates into the back or the upper
thighs. Primary dysmenorrhoea presents in young
women in their early teens and usually starts within
the first year of menarche as ovulation is establishing.
There is often a family history.
Women with secondary dysmenorrhoea will
previously have had painless periods; pain develops
or worsens at a later date. Menstrual irregularity may
suggest intrauterine pathology such as endometrial
polyps or submucous fibroids. Lower abdominal or
pelvic pain and dyspareunia suggests pelvic pathology
such as endometriosis, and, if associated with fever
and vaginal discharge, PID. A history of cervical surgery
or pregnancy associated uterine curettage usually
precedes the development of Asherman’s syndrome.

Examination
Examination will be normal in women with primary
dysmenorrhoea. A pin-point external cervical os
may indicate cervical stenosis. Pelvic tenderness and
cervical excitation pain are usually present in the
presence of pelvic pathology.

Investigation
A young woman presenting with primary
dysmenorrhoea who has a normal pelvic examination
does not usually require any further investigation.
Suitable investigations for secondary dysmenorrhoea
include:



• Microbiological swabs to identify infection, e.g.
Chlamydia especially in women under the age of
25 years.
• Pelvic ultrasound scan, which may identify
uterine fibroids; an increased endometrial
thickness is suggestive of intrauterine pathology.
• Laparoscopy, to exclude pelvic pathology.
 ysteroscopy, to exclude intrauterine pathology
• H
including adhesions.

Treatment
Primary dysmenorrhoea is nearly always associated
with ovulatory cycles and abolition of ovulation
using the COCP often improves dysmenorrhoea.
Non-hormonal medical treatment includes simple
analgesia and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors).
A rudimentary horn might require surgical excision.
Submucous fibroids, endometrial polyps and uterine
adhesions can be treated using operative hysteroscopy
techniques. Open myomectomy might be required for
larger fibroids, especially in women who wish to conserve
their uterus. The treatment of PID and endometriosis is
discussed in Chapters 26 and 22, respectively.

Postmenopausal Bleeding
Vaginal bleeding more than 12 months after the
menopause is called postmenopausal bleeding
(PMB). This is a common condition and should be
investigated promptly as it may indicate the presence
of malignancy. Of all women in the UK with PMB 9%
will be found to have a malignany.
Figure 1.7 shows the causes of PMB using the
anatomy of the female genital tract as a guide. There
are many causes of PMB and using this method will
help to remember them all. Atrophic changes to the
genital tract are the most common cause but must
not be assumed to be the cause until other pathology,
especially malignancy, has been excluded.

History
Atrophic changes to the genital tract – the most
common cause of PMB – usually present with small
amounts of bleeding. Local symptoms of oestrogen
deficiency include vaginal dryness, soreness and

superficial dyspareunia. Pruritus vulvae can indicate
the presence of non-neoplastic disorders of the vulva
(traditionally known as vulval dystrophies) and the
presence of a lump, whether painful or painless, can
suggest a vulval neoplasm.
Profuse or continuous vaginal bleeding or the
presence of a bloodstained offensive discharge is an
ominous sign and can indicate cervical or endometrial
malignancy. PMB is usually the only presenting
symptom of other endometrial cavity pathology, such
as endometrial polyps or submucous fibroids.
Early ovarian malignancy can be asymptomatic or
present with non-specific upper abdominal symptoms
such as epigastric discomfort or indigestion. Advanced
ovarian malignancy can produce pelvic or abdominal
pain and abdominal distension due to ascites.

Examination
A full gynaecological examination should be
performed. Abdominal examination might reveal

1

ascites or a mass arising from the pelvis. Vulval
lesions should be evident on examination. The
vagina and cervix should be inspected using a
speculum and a bimanual examination performed.
Postmenopausal ovaries should not be palpable on
bimanual examination.

Investigation
The following investigations should be performed on
all women with PMB:
• U
 ltrasound examination of the pelvis.
• Hysteroscopic examination of the uterine cavity.
• E
 ndometrial biopsy.
Hysteroscopy will identify the presence of
intrauterine pathology and can be performed
without general anaesthesia in the outpatient
setting. An alternative to hysteroscopy is ultrasound
scanning to assess the endometrial thickness
combined with endometrial sampling (discussed
further in Chapter 19). Ultrasound is also used to
assess the ovaries.
When indicated the following investigations
should also be performed:
•
•
•
•
•

Vulval biopsies.
Cervical cytology or colposcopy.
Cystoscopy.
Sigmoidoscopy.
Oestradiol levels.

Occasionally, it is not always obvious whether the
bleeding is vaginal, rectal or from the bladder, and
in these cases cystoscopy and sigmoidoscopy as well
as hysteroscopy should be performed. In the very
elderly, bimanual examination might not be possible,
in which case examination under anaesthesia is
indicated. However, elderly frail women are not
always ideal candidates for general anaesthesia and
less invasive investigations, such as ultrasound, might
have to be relied upon.

and investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding.

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with pelvic pain
or dyspareunia
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with pelvic pain or dyspareunia
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with pelvic pain or
dyspareunia in order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis
Pelvic pain, as for any type of pain, can be either:
• acute or
• chronic.
Chronic pelvic pain is often associated with
‘dyspareunia’, the term used to describe painful
sexual intercourse. This is classified as superficial
or deep, depending on whether it is experienced
superficially at the area of the vulva and introitus or
deep within the pelvis.
Figs 2.1 and 2.2 show the differential diagnoses
that should be considered when the patient presents
with these symptoms.

History to Focus on the
Differential Diagnosis of
Pelvic Pain and Dyspareunia
Because the differential diagnosis is so diverse, a
thorough history is important.

Presenting complaint
A detailed history of the pain is essential to
distinguish between pain of acute onset and chronic
pain. The following characteristics should be
elicited:
• Is it continuous or intermittent?
• Duration of the pain.
• Nature of the pain – is it sharp or dull?

•
•
•
•
•

Site of the pain – is it unilateral or bilateral?
Radiation to the back or legs.
Relationship of the pain to the menstrual cycle.
Relationship to bowel habit.
Associated symptoms, such as nausea and
vomiting, vaginal discharge, vulval irritation.

For example, the pain related to torsion of an ovarian
cyst is typically of acute onset, worse on one side
of the pelvis than the other, associated with nausea
and vomiting, and radiating to the upper thighs. It is
important to make this diagnosis promptly because
an operation to relieve the torsion might save the
ovary from irreversible ischaemia.
Mittelschmerz is an acute pain associated with
ovulation. To make this diagnosis, it is therefore
essential to know the timing of the pain in relation to
the patient’s menstrual cycle. Endometriosis is also
related to menses, typically starting up to 2 weeks
before the period and usually being relieved when
the bleeding starts. Deep dyspareunia is commonly
associated with this condition.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) may or may
not be associated with vaginal discharge. The pain is
typically felt across the whole of the lower abdomen
and there might be a history of fever.
In relation to bowel habit, appendicitis can be
associated with nausea and vomiting. Diverticulitis is
more likely to be associated with constipation and to
affect the older population.

Past gynaecological history
The date of the patient’s last menstrual period (LMP)
is important to exclude current pregnancy and the

possibility of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy.
It may also be relevant if symptoms such as superficial
dyspareunia are consistent with the perimenopause.
The date and result of the last cervical smear test should
be checked, as well as a history of irregular or postcoital
bleeding, which might be associated with malignancy.
Recent gynaecological procedures that involve
instrumentation of the uterus could put the patient
at risk of developing PID (e.g. insertion of an IUCD,
termination of pregnancy or hysteroscopy).
Previous PID or pelvic surgery could result in
adhesion formation. This is more likely to result in a
picture of chronic pain, and can be difficult to treat.
Pelvic floor repair can alter the vagina in such a way
as to cause deep dyspareunia. Recent childbirth is a
common cause of superficial dyspareunia, particularly
if suturing of vaginal lacerations or episiotomy was
necessary.
Congenital malformations of the genital tract are
rare and are likely to present before the patient is
sexually active and experiencing dyspareunia. There
might be a history of previous operations to restore
normal anatomy.

12

Past medical/surgical history
A history of appendicectomy excludes one of the
common differential diagnoses of pelvic pain.

Drug history
The type of analgesia and frequency of use is
helpful to determine the severity of pelvic pain.
A postmenopausal patient who has not been using
hormone replacement therapy may have superficial
dyspareunia secondary to atrophic changes.

Sexual history
Current use of contraception must be checked, both to
exclude pregnancy and to determine the risk of PID. A
recent change of partner increases the risk, particularly
if no barrier contraception has been used.
With regard to dyspareunia, there may be a history
of difficulty with intercourse, suggesting vaginismus.
This might be a difficult subject for the patient and
care should be taken to broach it in a sympathetic
manner.

General examination
A sexual history must be taken
in a sensitive manner with
particular attention to a new
partner, possible relationship issues or a history of
abuse.

Social history
A useful guide to the severity of symptoms in patients
presenting with chronic pelvic pain is how it affects
activities of daily living, for example, going to school
or taking time off work.
A history of sexual abuse has been shown to be
relevant to presentation with chronic pain. Again, a
sensitive approach is essential in questioning.

Pyrexia and tachycardia are associated with PID. Rupture
of an ovarian cyst can cause intraperitoneal bleeding
and, subsequently, hypotension with tachycardia. A
ruptured ectopic pregnancy would also present with
these signs. It should be noted that hypotension is a
late sign in an otherwise healthy patient and its absence
does not exclude these diagnoses.
Gynaecological malignancy is more likely to
present with symptoms other than pelvic pain, more
commonly in the older age group. However, signs
such as cachexia and anaemia should be excluded.

Abdominal palpation
The site of the pain should be elicited, as should the
presence of guarding or rebound tenderness, which
suggest peritonism. An abdominal mass arising from
the pelvis, such as an enlarged fibroid uterus, may be
present. This could give symptoms of acute pelvic pain,
if there is fibroid necrosis, or of deep dyspareunia.

Vulval/vaginal/cervical inspection
Fig. 2.3 shows the diagnoses responsible for both
pelvic pain and superficial dyspareunia that might
affect the vulva and vagina. A speculum examination
should be performed to look for discharge.

Symptoms and signs

Postmenopausal changes (see Chapter 29)

Vulval and vaginal skin appears thin and atrophic. This can cause superficial

Vulval dystrophies (see Chapter 25)

There might be patches of inflammation, leukoplakia and ulceration, which
cause superficial dyspareunia

Episiotomy/lacerations (see Chapter 40)

Injury secondary to childbirth commonly causes superficial dyspareunia

Abscesses

A Bartholin’s abscess is an abscess of the gland situated towards the posterior
fourchette; labial abscesses are commonly situated on the labia majora. Both
types cause acute pain and need incision and drainage

Bimanual pelvic examination
Tenderness
Generalized tenderness, including uterine, is
more common with PID. This condition is also
associated with cervical excitation. The tenderness
may be unilateral with an ovarian cyst or an ectopic
pregnancy. A common site for endometriosis is
the pouch of Douglas, and tender nodules can be
palpated in the posterior fornix.

Mass
The following conditions may present with a pelvic
mass:
•
•
•
•
•

Tubo-ovarian abscess.
Ovarian cyst.
Endometriotic cyst.
Fibroid.
Ectopic pregnancy.

The uterus is enlarged in pregnancy and the cervical
os might be open if the patient is miscarrying. A
fixed, tender, retroverted uterus could be a result
of endometriosis or PID. The uterus typically feels
tender and bulky with adenomyosis.

Investigations of Patients
Who have Pelvic Pain and
Dyspareunia

who present with pelvic pain and dyspareunia is shown

an early pregnancy complication with vaginal or
suspected intraperitoneal bleeding. A white blood
cell count and a C-reactive protein (CRP) level will
aid diagnosis of infection.

Pregnancy test
A urine pregnancy test is mandatory in a patient of
reproductive age with acute abdominal pain. It must
be performed regardless of the date of the LMP or
if the symptoms suggest a gastrointestinal cause.
The presentation of an ectopic pregnancy can be
atypical and may be fatal if not diagnosed.

Infection screen
Always perform a pregnancy test on a
patient of reproductive age who presents
with acute abdominal pain in order to
exclude an ectopic pregnancy.

A midstream urine (MSU) sample should be sent to
exclude a urinary tract infection. Swabs for sexually
transmitted infection should be sent whether the
pain history is chronic or acute. Most importantly
these should include a test for Chlamydia infection,
either an endocervical swab or a urine sample.

Pelvic pain and dyspareunia

Radiological investigations

Laparoscopy

A pelvic ultrasound scan is important in acute and
chronic pain, as well as with deep dyspareunia.
Pathology can include ovarian cysts, uterine fibroids,
ectopic pregnancy or intrauterine pregnancy.
A plain abdominal X-ray might be appropriate if
the patient gives a history suggesting diverticulitis.

Fig. 2.4 shows some of the diagnoses that can be
confirmed by laparoscopy.

Biopsy
If the appearances of the vulva are abnormal, biopsy
is indicated. This can be performed under local
anaesthesia, depending on the size of the lesion.

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with vaginal
discharge
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with vaginal discharge
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with vaginal discharge in
order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis
Vaginal discharge can be either:
• physiological, or
• pathological.
Physiological discharge varies with the changing
oestrogen levels associated with the luteal phase
of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. Once
pathological causes have been excluded, the patient
can be reassured that her symptoms are normal.
Possible causes of physiological vaginal discharge
are:
•
•
•
•

Vestibular gland secretions.
Vaginal transudate.
Cervical mucus.
Residual menstrual fluid.

Don’t forget to reassure the
patient that vaginal discharge
might simply be physiological,
related to the menstrual cycle or to pregnancy.
Pathological causes need to be excluded.

The differential diagnoses of pathological vaginal
discharge are shown in Fig. 3.1. The most common
group is the infections.

History to focus on the differential
diagnosis of vaginal discharge
The patient should be asked about the nature of the
discharge. This includes:
•
•
•
•
•

Timing of onset.
Colour.
Odour.
Presence of any blood.
Irritation.

For example, candidal infection is associated with a
thick, itchy, white discharge, whereas with bacterial
vaginosis there is typically a grey, fishy-smelling
discharge. An allergic reaction is usually associated
with itching. Urinary symptoms, such as dysuria
and frequency, might be present with a sexually
transmitted infection.
Lower abdominal pain, backache and dyspareunia
are suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
(see Chapter 26), more commonly in a younger
woman. In relation to malignancy, the patient age
group is usually older than the infective group (see
Chapter 24). General symptoms such as weight loss
and anorexia should be excluded.

Past gynaecological history
The date of the menopause and the last cervical
smear test are relevant, particularly if malignancy is
suspected.

A ring pessary might previously have been sited
to relieve genital prolapse (see Chapter 28). This
should be changed every 6 months. Previous history
of hysterectomy could be linked with development
of a uretero- or vesicovaginal fistula. This results
in constant vaginal loss that is actually urine.
A history of obstructed labour, more common in
developing countries, also puts the patient at risk of a
vesicovaginal fistula.

Past medical history
A history of diabetes mellitus predisposes the patient
to candida infection.

Generalized symptoms can be indicative
of different pathologies, depending on
the age of the patient. Lower abdominal
pain, backache and dyspareunia suggest infection in a
younger woman but malignancy in older age groups.

Sexual history
The patient’s current method of contraception is
important with regards to the risk of a sexually

Examination of Patients with
Vaginal Discharge
•

•

General examination.
Abdominal palpation.
Speculum examination.
Bimanual palpation.

General examination should be aimed at identifying
signs of systemic infection (tachycardia, pyrexia,
local lymphadenopathy) or malignancy (cachexia,
generalized lymphadenopathy).

Always remember to perform a
general examination and abdominal
palpation, and not simply vulval/vaginal
examination.

Abdominal palpation should exclude localized
tenderness, which may be present if the patient is
developing PID, or an abdominal mass if malignancy
is suspected.
The vulva and vagina should be inspected
carefully. A speculum examination should be
performed to check the cervix and to confirm or
exclude:
•
•
•
•
•

Vaginal discharge.
Inflammation.
Ulceration.
Foreign bodies.
Local tumours.

Bimanual pelvic examination will reveal pelvic
tumours. It might also elicit tenderness and cervical
excitation, suggesting PID.

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with vulval
symptoms
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with vulval symptoms
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with vulval symptoms in
order to establish a diagnosis.

Itching or irritation of the vulval region is called
pruritus vulvae. This debilitating and socially
embarrassing symptom is common and can be
caused by a whole host of conditions. These are
grouped into four broad categories (Fig. 4.1):
•
•
•
•

Vulval dystrophy.
Neoplastic.
Dermatological.
Infection.

Generalized dermatological
conditions and systemic
illness may present with vulval
symptoms.

History
The age of the patient is important as younger
women are generally more likely to have an infectious
aetiology, whereas vulval dystrophies (more correctly
termed non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the
vulva) and neoplasms are more likely in older
women. Acute onset of symptoms occurs frequently
with infection whereas other causes of pruritus
vulvae can have a more chronic and insidious
onset. Embarrassment often delays presentation.
A history of postmenopausal bleeding is important
to ascertain.

Exacerbating and relieving factors can give clues
as to the aetiology. Symptoms of yeast and herpetic
infection might worsen premenstrually. A recent
change in soap or washing powder, or overzealous
hygiene may suggest contact dermatitis. Self-treatment
with emollients and antifungals is common and
should be noted, as should the response.
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and vulval
intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) are thought to share a
common aetiology, so a history of CIN should be noted.
Abnormal vaginal discharge can suggest infection and,
if suspected, a detailed sexual history should be taken.
The discharge of infection with Trichomonas vaginalis
and bacterial vaginosis has a typically ‘fishy’ odour.
Dermatological conditions such as psoriasis and
eczema can affect the vulva and a history of these
conditions elsewhere on the body might be relevant.
Symptoms suggestive of diabetes mellitus, renal and
liver failure should be noted.

Examination
General examination of the patient includes
assessment of skin surfaces prone to dermatological
conditions: face, hands, wrists, elbows, trunk and
knees. Signs of chronic renal failure and liver disease
should be looked for.
Examination of the vulva, urethral meatus and
perianal region in a good light is essential. The vagina
and cervix should be inspected carefully with the aid
of a speculum. Colposcopic examination of the vulva
might be useful if no apparent lesion can be seen

The lesions of hyperplastic dystrophy can be localized
or extensive, and typically show thickening of the
affected skin with variable colour change. Thickened
plaques of leucoplakia might be present.

Neoplasia
VIN lesions are variable and can be papular (similar
to genital warts) or macular with irregular borders.
Pigmentation (brown or black) is common and
leucoplakia and ulceration can occur. Invasive
squamous carcinoma of the vulva usually appears as
an exophytic tumour, often with surface ulceration.
Paget’s disease of the vulva can be unifocal or
multifocal and the lesions are typically clearly
defined, scaly, erythematous plaques with varying
degrees of ulceration and leucoplakia.

Dermatological
Psoriasis might appear as the typical scaly plaques but
it can also be smooth, erythematous and fissured.

Investigating pruritus vulvae
Colposcopic examination of
the vulva and histological
assessment of biopsies may
reveal abnormalities even if the vulva looks
normal to the naked eye.

Inguinal lymphadenopathy can occur secondary to
infection or malignancy.

Infection
Generalized vulvitis, vaginal discharge and ulcers
suggest an infective cause, although ulceration should
alert the examiner to the possibility of malignancy.
Genital warts might be seen on the vulva, perianally,
in the vagina or on the cervix.

Vulval dystrophies
Labial fusion, adhesions, stenosis of the introitus,
leucoplakia (literally meaning ‘white plaque’)

22

Where systemic disease is suspected, relevant
testing should include liver function, renal function
and glucose tolerance. Urinalysis might reveal
the presence of haematuria, proteinurea and
glycosuria.
The relevant bacteriological swabs should be
performed to exclude yeast infection (Fig. 4.2)
and sexually active women should be screened for
sexually transmitted diseases. Pinworms might
be identified by naked-eye visualization of the
adult female worms in the perianal region or by
microscopic identification of the ova.
Although certain conditions of the vulva have a
typical appearance, many are difficult to distinguish
with the naked eye. The mainstay of diagnosis of vulval
dystrophies, dermatoses and neoplasms is histological.
Punch biopsies of the vulva can be performed under
local anaesthetic in the outpatient setting, with or
without the aid of a colposcope. Discrete lesions can
be excised in their entirety, as excision biopsies under
general anaesthesia. Hysteroscopy is indicated to
exclude endometrial pathology when postmenopausal
bleeding has occurred.

Urinary incontinence

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a female patient presenting with
urinary incontinence
• Perform an examination on a female patient presenting with urinary incontinence
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a female patient presenting with urinary
incontinence in order to establish a diagnosis.

Urinary incontinence is an objectively demonstrable
involuntary loss of urine that is a social or hygienic
problem. The two most common causes of urinary
incontinence are stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
and detrusor overactivity (DO), which account for
approximately 90% of incontinent women. These,
and other causes, are shown in Fig. 5.1 in order of
frequency of occurrence.

History
A detailed history is mandatory because of the presence
of multiple symptoms that are not always apparent
on cursory questioning. The two symptoms stress
incontinence and urge incontinence are commonly
used synonymously with the conditions SUI and DO,
respectively (see Fig. 5.2 for definitions of common
urogynaecological terms). This is inaccurate and can lead
to inappropriate treatment because many incontinent
women will admit to both symptoms, although in only
5% of women will SUI and DO coexist.

‘The bladder is an unreliable
witness’ is an old adage and
suggests that presenting
symptoms do not correlate well with the underlying
bladder condition. For example, a patient giving a
history of stress incontinence may have detrusor
overactivity as the underlying pathology.

Stress urinary incontinence
The most common symptom of SUI is stress
incontinence, usually small amounts of urinary
leakage. However, one-third of women with SUI
will also admit to urge incontinence and up to a half
will experience urgency of micturition. Frequency
of micturition and nocturia are also common
symptoms.
SUI is associated with the following factors and
these must be highlighted in the history:
•
•
•
•
•

Increasing age.
Increasing parity.
Genital prolapse.
Postmenopausal status.
Previous pelvic floor surgery.

Detrusor overactivity
The vast majority of women with DO will complain
of urgency, urge incontinence, frequency and
nocturia. However, up to one-quarter might
complain of stress incontinence because raised
intra-abdominal pressure can stimulate an unstable
bladder to contract and produce the symptom of
stress incontinence.
The following factors should be highlighted in the
history:
•
•
•
•
•

Age.
History of nocturnal enuresis.
Neurological history.
Previous incontinence surgery.
Drug history.

Fig. 5.1 The causes of female urinary incontinence in order of frequency
of occurrence.

Voiding disorders can result in chronic retention
leading to overflow incontinence. As well as urgency
and frequency, the classic symptoms of ‘prostatism’
might be present: hesitancy, straining to void, poor
flow and incomplete emptying. Large residual volumes
of urine due to incomplete emptying predispose to
urinary tract infection, which aggravates the symptoms
of incontinence, urgency and frequency. Stress
incontinence might be a presenting symptom.

Fistulae
Fistulae are very rare in the UK but should always be
suspected when incontinence is continuous during
the day and at night.

Sensory urgency
Sensory urgency differs from detrusor overactivity
(motor urgency) in that the urgency occurs in
the absence of detrusor activity. The presenting
symptoms are the same as for detrusor overactivity
although incontinence is not such a common
feature.

Examination
Chronic dampness can cause excoriation of the vulva.

is to ask the patient to cough while standing with
a moderately full bladder. Stress incontinence
is not always demonstrable, especially with the
patient in the supine position. Examination of the
vaginal walls, using a Sims’ speculum, will identify
scarring from previous surgery and the presence
of uterovaginal prolapse; especially important is a
cysto-urethrocele. Bimanual examination should
identify a pelvic mass.
As neurological disease can present with urinary
symptoms, including incontinence, a neurological
examination should be performed.

might be the cause of the presenting symptoms and
infection could be exacerbated by further invasive
investigations (Fig. 5.3).

Incontinence surgery should
never be considered prior
to performing urodynamic
studies. Inappropriate surgery is not only bad
medicine but could leave the patient with a worse
problem than she started with.

Urodynamics
A neurological examination should be
performed when neurological causes of
urinary incontinence are suspected.

Investigations
As suggested above, the bladder is an ‘unreliable
witness’ and judicious investigation is important
if inappropriate treatment is to be avoided. It is
essential to exclude a urinary tract infection (UTI), a
common cause of sensory urgency, because the UTI

It could be argued that all incontinent women
should have urodynamics performed (see Chapter
27). This is especially so in women about to undergo
incontinence surgery.
Uroflowmetry will identify low peak urine flow
rates, which suggests a voiding disorder. Cystometry
is probably the single most useful urodynamic
investigation and will confirm or exclude DO. Cysto­
metry will not diagnose SUI but will suggest this
diagnosis by exclusion of other disorders such as DO.
Videocystourethrography (VCU) combines radio­­
logical with pressure and flow studies and gives

the most information about bladder function. VCU
can positively identify SUI as well as DO and other
disorders. It is a very useful test to perform prior to
incontinence surgery, although not all units provide this
service.

Cystoscopy
Although cystoscopy allows inspection of the
anatomy of the bladder and bladder neck, it does not

28

give information regarding their function. Anatomical
assessment of the bladder neck is important in the
presence of voiding disorders; polyps, calculi and
malignancies will be obvious, as will trabeculation.
True bladder capacity can be measured under general
anaesthesia.

Prolapse
Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with prolapse
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with prolapse
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with prolapse in order to
establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis

Fig. 6.1 Differential diagnosis of prolapse

A prolapse is the protrusion of an organ or a structure
beyond its normal anatomical site. In the female
genital tract, the type of prolapse depends on the
organ involved and its position in relation to the
anterior or posterior vaginal wall (Fig. 6.1; see also
Fig. 28.1).

Enterocoele

Uterus and cervix

Uterine descent

Cystocoele/cystourethrocoele
A cystocoele is a prolapse of the upper anterior wall of
the vagina, which is attached to the bladder by fascia.
This type of prolapse can extend to include the lower
anterior vaginal wall as the urethra is displaced down;
this is known as a cystourethrocoele.

Rectocoele
A rectocoele is a weakness in the levator ani muscles
that causes a bulge in the mid-posterior vaginal wall,
which includes the rectum.

Enterocoele
An enterocoele is a true hernia of the pouch of Douglas.
It is a prolapse of the upper third of the posterior
vaginal wall and contains loops of small bowel.

Uterine descent
The uterus descends within the vagina and may even
lie outside it. The latter is known as a procidentia
(Fig. 6.2). Uterine descent may be associated with a
cystocoele and/or a rectocoele.

Vault descent
After hysterectomy, the proximal end of the vaginal
vault can prolapse within or outside the vagina.

History to Focus on the
Differential Diagnosis of
Prolapse
Most commonly, the patient presents with a history
of local discomfort or a feeling of ‘something coming
down’, as the prolapsed organ pushes into the vagina
and bulges towards the introitus. It may interfere
with sexual function or be exacerbated by increasing
intra-abdominal pressure, such as with coughing or
straining to pass stools.

Remember that your history
should exclude symptoms
related to the urinary and
bowel systems.

29

Prolapse

Urinary symptoms
These occur with a cystocoele or a cystourethrocoele.
They include urinary frequency or incomplete
emptying of the bladder. The latter predisposes
to urinary infection. Stress incontinence might
be present if there is descent of the urethrovesical
junction or bladder neck (see Chapter 27).

Bowel symptoms

����������
�������������������������

A rectocoele may cause incomplete bowel emptying.
This can be relieved if the patient pushes back the
prolapse digitally.

The patient with a prolapse commonly
complains of backache, but don’t forget
to consider other causes of backache
particularly in an older woman.

Uterine descent often gives symptoms of backache,
although other causes of backache must be excluded,
especially in older patients. A procidentia causes
discomfort as it rubs on the patient’s clothing and
this might cause a bloody, sometimes purulent,
discharge.
Fig. 6.3 shows factors that should be elicited in the
history that may predispose the patient to prolapse
in general.

Following abdominal palpation to exclude a mass,
the patient should be examined in the left lateral
position using a Sims’ speculum in order to exclude
a vaginal wall prolapse. With the posterior vaginal
wall retracted, any anterior wall prolapse will be
demonstrated if the patient is asked to bear down.
Conversely, if the anterior vaginal wall is retracted,
then an enterocoele or rectocoele will be seen.

Investigation of prolapse

Investigation of Prolapse
Abdominal palpation and bimanual
examination must always be performed to
exclude a pelvic mass as the cause for the
prolapse.

There are few relevant investigations for prolapse
because it is basically a clinical diagnosis dependent
on examination findings. In relation to patients
with urinary symptoms, the following tests might be
appropriate:

Uterine descent is assessed by examining the
position of the cervix within the vagina, again usually
with the Sims’ speculum. If the patient has a full
bladder, stress incontinence can be demonstrated
by asking the patient to cough. A bimanual pelvic
examination is mandatory to exclude a pelvic mass
as the cause of the prolapse.

• Mid-stream urine specimen.
• Urodynamics.

The menopause

7

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with menopause
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with menopause
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with menopause in order
to establish a diagnosis.

Presentation and
Differential Diagnosis
The strict definition of the menopause is the
‘cessation of menstruation’, but this is not always
helpful as a basis for management. Amenorrhoea
is often preceded by many years of oestrogendependent symptoms. From a biological viewpoint
it is unlikely that the ovaries are suddenly switched
off; their function is more likely to decline gradually,
with the cessation of periods as an endpoint that
is reflected by the occurrence of irregular periods,
decreased fertility, increasing premenstrual syndrome
and climacteric depression before the amenorrhoea
of the menopause. This can result in difficulties in
differential diagnosis, depending on which of the
following menopausal symptoms predominate.

Menstruation is a poor sign of
menopausal status. Remember
to ask your patient about other
symptoms related to the menopause.

Bleeding Disturbances
This includes oligomenorrhoea and secondary
amenorrhoea. See Chapters 1 and 19 for the
differential diagnosis.

Vasomotor Symptoms
These include hot flushes, night sweats, palpitations,
headaches and dizziness. The differential diagnosis is
outlined in Fig. 7.1.
These symptoms affect 75% of women during a
natural menopause but are more common and severe
in women experiencing an acute menopause after
bilateral oophorectomy or radiotherapy.
One of the greatest difficulties in diagnosing the
menopause is that vasomotor symptoms can occur
for up to 5 years before menstruation ceases. It is
vital that the diagnosis is considered and treatment
offered empirically if women are not to be left to
suffer unnecessarily.

Fig. 7.1 Differential diagnosis of vasomotor symptoms
during menopause
• Cardiovascular problems, e.g. arrhythmias, coronary
heart disease, valvular lesions, cardiomyopathies
• Other endocrinopathies, e.g. hypo-/hyperthyroidism,
hyperprolactinaemia, Cushing’s syndrome
• Haematological problems, e.g. myeloma
• Infective causes, e.g. tuberculosis
• Other, e.g. malignancy

33

The menopause

Night sweats can be due to conditions
other than the menopause, such as
tuberculosis or lymphoma.

Psychological Symptoms
These include mood swings, worsening premenstrual
syndrome, decreased libido and poor concentration.
The differential diagnosis is given in Fig. 7.2.
The origin of psychological symptoms is
complex and likely to involve both biological and
psychosocial factors. Epidemiological studies have
confirmed an increase of psychological symptoms in
women in the perimenopausal years. The orthodox
psychiatric view is that the effect of depression is
entirely environmental, related to domestic stress,
loss of youth and fertility, the ‘empty nest’ syndrome
and death of parents.
There is no doubt that these psychosocial aspects
are important. However, hormonal changes also play
a part. The predominance of depression in women
occurs only between puberty and the menopause, and
is most common at times of greatest hormonal change,
such as premenstrually, postnatally and around the
perimenopause. Conversely, during the last trimester of
pregnancy, when hormone levels are stable, depression
rarely occurs.
Again, these symptoms can occur years before
menstruation ceases and menopause must be
considered as a diagnosis in women who present
with depression in their 30s, 40s and 50s (and
occasionally younger) and especially after surgical
oophorectomy without adequate HRT.

Fig. 7.2 Differential diagnosis of psychological symptoms
during menopause
• Psychiatric disorders, e.g. endogenous depression,
anxiety, neurosis, bipolar disorders
• Lesions of the central nervous system
• Other endocrinopathies, especially hypothyroidism
• Severe premenstrual syndrome
• Other, e.g. malignancy

34

Depression is common in the
perimenopause because of fluctuating
hormone levels, but other pathology such
as hypothyroidism should be excluded.

Intermediate Menopause
Symptoms
• Vulvovaginal: dyspareunia, vaginal bleeding.
• Urinary: dysuria, frequency, haematuria,
incontinence.
• Skin: bruising, infection, poor healing.
• Joints: pain.
The differential diagnosis is shown in Fig. 7.3 (see
also Chapters 2, 4 and 5).

Urinary and vaginal symptoms are often
the first presenting symptoms of the
menopause.

Oestrogen deficiency results in the rapid loss
of collagen. In the genital tract this is manifested
by dyspareunia and vaginal bleeding from fragile
atrophic skin, and in the lower urinary tract by
dysuria, urgency and frequency, commonly termed
the urethral syndrome. More generalized changes are
seen in older women as increased bruising and thin
translucent skin, which is vulnerable to trauma and
infection. A similar loss of collagen from ligaments
can cause many of the generalized aches and pains
that are so common in postmenopausal women.

Fig. 7.3 Differential diagnosis of intermediate
menopause symptoms
Dermatological conditions, e.g. eczema, psoriasis
Connective tissue disorders, e.g. scleroderma, systemic
lupus erythematosus
Other endocrinopathies, e.g. hypothyroidism
The ‘natural ageing process’
Mechanical trauma, e.g. joint sprain
Rheumatological conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis

Long-Term Symptoms
of the Menopause

Osteoporosis-related minimal
injury fracture
Factors that might have contributed to an early
presentation osteoporosis related fracture include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Smoking.
Low BMI.
Long episodes of amenorrhoea.
Early age of menopause.
Family history of osteoporosis.
Systemic disease, e.g. renal disease.
Drug usage, e.g. steroids, chemotherapy.

7

Osteoporosis itself is generally symptomless
unless a fracture has occurred. Very rarely, the first
presentation of the menopause will be when a
woman suffers an osteoporosis-related fracture.
Other differential diagnoses should be considered
(Fig. 7.4). This could have occurred because one of
the contributory factors shown above prevented that
woman achieving her genetically pre-programmed
peak bone mass.
Fig. 7.5 provides an algorithm for the investigation
and management of the menopause.

Subfertility
Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with subfertility
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with subfertility
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with subfertility in order to
establish a diagnosis.

Eighty percent of couples will conceive within one
year when having regular sexual intercourse; couples
that do not should be seen and investigated, although
the problem might not lie with the woman (Fig. 8.1).

Subfertility affects 1 in 7 couples in the UK:
22% = male factor alone
21% = female and male factors
57% = female factor alone

History of the couple
This should include the duration of subfertility and
whether frequency of intercourse is adequate. This
should be two or three times a week or timed in
relation to ovulation. The issue of sexual difficulties
should be broached, especially female vaginismus
and dyspareunia or male erectile or ejaculatory
dysfunction.

History from the woman
Past obstetric history

First, consider what is necessary for conception.
An XX woman and an XY male must have penetrative
intercourse resulting in male ejaculation. Conception
occurs in the 4 days around ovulation – sperm
can survive for 3 days and an egg can be fertilized
for 1 day after it is released. The sperm must pass
through the cervical mucus, the uterine cavity and
into the fallopian tube. The egg must have been
picked up by the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube
and transported down to meet the sperm so that
fertilization can take place within the tube, and the
fertilized embryo must be able to implant within the
endometrium.

It should be established whether this is primary or
secondary subfertility. that is, whether the woman

Taking the History
It is helpful to bear the above sequence in mind when
taking the history and examining the subfertile couple
to diagnose the cause of the problem (Fig. 8.2).

has had a pregnancy before and, if so, whether this
was with a different partner. Details of previous
pregnancies must be recorded, paying particular
attention to a history of ectopic pregnancy, which
could point to a tubal reason for subfertility.

Dyspareunia is an important symptom, suggesting
PID or endometriosis.

Past medical history
Chronic medical conditions (e.g. renal disease,
hypo- and hyperthyroidism) and eating disorders –
especially anorexia nervosa – decrease the number of
ovulatory cycles, reducing the chance of conception.

Drug history
A detailed drug history is essential (both prescription
or otherwise).
• Any medication not recommended for use in
pregnancy must be reviewed at this visit and
alternatives prescribed if appropriate.
• All women trying to conceive should be advised
to take folic acid supplements.
• The regular use of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and cannabis is known to
decrease the number of ovulatory cycles.

Social history
Smoking is known to decrease fertility in women and
men.

History from the man
Past surgical history

One episode of PID gives a 10% chance
of tubal blockage; three episodes of PID
give a 50% chance of tubal blockage.

Past gynaecological history
A menstrual history should be taken.
• H
 eavy periods may be due to fibroids, and
• P
 ainful periods, might suggest endometriosis.
Endometriosis can cause tubal problems, either
due to adhesions or by interfering with the ciliary
action of the tubal lining. Ashermann’s syndrome –
the presence of intrauterine adhesions that form
after curettage or termination of pregnancy –
causes severe dysmenorrhoea.
• Irregular or prolonged menstrual cycle may point
to anovulation.
Causes of tubal damage should be sought by
enquiring about previous chlamydial infection,
IUCD use, tubal surgery or ectopic pregnancy.

38

• Full surgical history should be taken including
any in infancy.
• Repair of inguinal hernia might have led to
obstruction of the vas deferens in its inguinal
portion.
• Undescended testes are known to predispose to
poorer semen quality (regardless of timing of
orchidopexy).
• Testicular torsion is associated with reduced fertility.
• Bladder neck surgery, including transurethral
resection of the prostate (TURP) can result in
retrograde ejaculation.

Past medical history
• Epididymo-orchitis, most commonly caused by
sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia
(also referred to as non-specific urethritis, NSU)
can result in epididymal obstruction. This is also
common in cystic fibrosis sufferers.
• Postpubertal mumps orchitis can cause
significant testicular atrophy resulting in very
poor quality sperm, and

Investigation of subfertility
• Chronic medical conditions (e.g. renal disease)
impair spermatogenesis.
• Diabetes can lead to retrograde ejaculation.

Drug history
Several drugs are known to decrease sperm number
and/or function: anabolic steroids, cannabis, cocaine,
sulfasalazine (taken for inflammatory bowel disease),
colchicine (used to treat gout), nitrofurantoin and
tetracyclines (antibiotics).
• α-Blockers (used for treatment of benign
prostatic hypertrophy) and some antidepressants
are known to interfere with ejaculation;
• β-blockers may cause impotence.

Social history
• Smoking can impair the quality of the sperm but
alcohol (if the intake is moderate) does not affect
fertility.
• Occupational history is important. Sperm count
might be affected in men whose jobs result in
raised testicular temperature such as prolonged
driving.
• Heavy metals, solvents and agricultural chemicals
are all associated with oligospermia.

Consultation with the subfertile
couple should be carried out
with compassion and dignity.
The inability to conceive may result in psychological,
social, ethnic and religious pressures that may
not always be apparent but may have profound
consequences for the individuals.

Examination

Examination of the woman
General
• The presence or absence of secondary sexual
characteristics should be noted.
• The BMI should be calculated ( weight (kg) divided
by height (m2)). Those at the extremes, that is,
women who are obese (BMI > 30) or underweight
(BMI < 19), are less likely to be ovulating.

8

 irsutism and acanthosis nigricans may indicate
• H
PCOS.
 ther syndromes linked to infertility have
• O
other typical facies (e.g. hyper/hypothyroidism,
Cushing’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome).

Abdominal examination
Scars from previous surgery might be seen on
inspection (e.g. laparoscopy for endometriosis/PID).
On palpation, the presence of a mass may be due
to a large fibroid uterus or ovarian cyst, and lower
abdominal tenderness may be due to endometriosis
or PID.

Vaginal examination
• The practice of female genital mutilation is
widespread in some parts of the world and may
cause dyspareunia and even apareunia.
• Occasionally an intact hymen is discovered.
• Vaginal discharge may be physiological or a sign
of PID – if there is doubt, swabs should be taken.
• The uterus is palpated; a non-mobile uterus may
be due to adhesions from endometriosis or PID;
an enlarged uterus is likely to be due to fibroids.

Examination of the man
• BMI should be calculated as obesity is known to
decrease testosterone levels.
• The presence of secondary sexual characteristics
should be noted – inadequate virilization could
be due to abnormal karyotype.
• Scars from inguinal hernia repair might point to
an obstructive problem.
• Finally, but importantly underwear! Tight
underwear raises the scrotal temperature and can
impair sperm function.
• Testicular presence and size is measured against
an orchidometer, and the presence of the vas
deferens on both sides is checked by palpation.

Investigation of Subfertility

Basic investigations for all couples
Blood tests
The following should be checked in women:
• Progesterone: the level rises after ovulation. The
test should be performed a week before the next

39

Subfertility
period is due, e.g. day 21 of a 28-day cycle, or day
28 of a 35-day cycle. If > 32 nmol/L, ovulation
has occurred.
• Rubella immunity: this is not an investigation of
subfertility but must be checked in any woman
who is intending to conceive so that she can be
vaccinated if not immune to prevent infection in
pregnancy.

Ultrasound
This can be transvaginal or transabdominal, and is
performed to look for:
• P
 resence of uterus and ovaries.
• Congenital abnormalities of the uterus.
• B
 ulky ovaries with multiple peripheral follicles
in PCOS.
• Hydrosalpinx.

Microbiology
Screen for Chlamydia in both women (endocervical
swab/urine) and men (urethral swab). Infection is
asymptomatic in up to 70% of women so there might
be no clues in the history, but diagnosis is crucial.
Although treatment will not improve fertility, failure
to treat prior to hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy
and dye (see below) can lead to an exacerbation of
infection which may worsen tubal disease.

Test of tubal patency
These tests are performed in the first half of the cycle
to ensure that the patient is not already pregnant.
• Hysterosalpingogram (HSG) is performed
without anaesthetic and is the test of choice for
tubal patency unless there are clinical grounds
to assess the pelvis through a laparoscope
(Fig. 8.3). The cervix is cannulated, radio-opaque
dye is introduced into the uterus and an X-ray
is taken to look for passage of the dye. Blockage
inside or outside the tubes can prevent the dye
flowing; however, tubal spasm in response to the
dye can also prevent flow.
• Laparoscopy and dye is performed under
general anaesthetic. It enables direct
visualization of the pelvis in order to diagnose
endometriosis or PID and the resulting
adhesions. Methyline Blue dye is introduced
through the cervix by a second operator and its
progress through and out of the tubes can be

published by Mosby Wolfe.

seen through the laparoscope. Lack of ‘fill and
spill’ of dye indicates tubal occlusion.
• The choice of investigation should be dictated
by the history and examination. If there is no
suspicion of tubal blockage or other intraabdominal pathology, a HSG is preferable
because it avoids the anaesthetic risk; in all other
cases laparoscopy should be performed.
• Hysterosalpingo contrast sonography (HyCoSy)
is an ultrasound investigation in which the cervix
is cannulated and the passage of fluid through
the uterus and tubes is monitored using Doppler.
This is a recently developed alternative to HSG;
the results are comparable and it is said to be less
uncomfortable for the patient. At present it is not
widely used in the UK.

Semen analysis
The man is asked to provide a specimen after 3 days
abstinence from ejaculation and after a period of
good health – a systemic illness within the previous
72 days can adversely affect the quality of sperm
produced. The sample should be processed within
1 hour of production. The sperm are counted and
evaluated for motility, progression and morphology,
and the volume of the specimen is recorded
(Fig. 8.4 gives the normal parameters). The presence of
more than 106 white blood cells suggests epididymoorchitis. Ideally, at least two samples should be
processed. These must be produced at least 12 weeks
apart to sample different populations of sperm.

Further investigations
These might be prompted by specific points in the
history or examination, and include:
• Thyroid function tests, prolactin levels, LH/FSH
levels if the woman has an irregular cycle.
• Prolactin: if either partner has galactorrhoea.
• Karyotyping: if secondary sexual characteristics
are absent.
• Testosterone: if the man appears hypoandrogenic
(non-hirsute, small soft testes) or if the woman is
overly hirsute.

8

• P
 ostcoital test: if unsure whether proper sexual
intercourse is taking place, or if the man declines
to provide a semen specimen for analysis (e.g. on
religious grounds), a sample can be taken from the
vagina, suspended in saline and examined for the
presence of sperm. This test was once more widely
used to look for evidence of cervical hostility, but
has now been shown to be a poor test.
• A
 ntisperm antibodies: should only be performed in
tertiary centres. Both women and men might have
antibodies to sperm. In men they occur on the sperm
surface, in the seminal plasma and in the blood
serum, whereas in women they are found in blood
and in cervical mucus. They affect sperm motility
and function but their presence is not a significant
predictor of infertility – they are found in 5–10% of
infertile men but also in 2% of fertile men.
• H
 ysteroscopy: should only be performed if
the ultrasound suggests abnormality (e.g.
intrauterine adhesions, endometrial polyps or
fibroids). Polyps and submucosal fibroids are
associated with subfertility but the exact causal
relationship is unclear.

Bleeding and/or pain in
early pregnancy

9

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with bleeding
and/or pain in early pregnancy
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with bleeding and/or pain in early
pregnancy
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with bleeding and/or pain
in early pregnancy in order to establish a diagnosis.

The history, examination and investigations must be
aimed at distinguishing an ectopic pregnancy from
a miscarriage (Fig.9.1). Women with bleeding or
pain in early pregnancy will be anxious so sensitive
explanations are important, especially when the
diagnosis is uncertain and further investigations
are necessary. Note that the definitions in Fig. 9.2
refer to miscarriage. The term ‘miscarriage’ is used
in preference to ‘abortion’ which many women will
equate with a termination.

History for Bleeding/Pain
in Early Pregnancy

Last menstrual period
The first day of the last menstrual period (LMP)
will allow you to calculate the gestation. This
becomes important when interpreting early
pregnancy scans. While an empty uterus on a scan
at 7 weeks might indicate an ectopic pregnancy, a
small gestation sac with no fetal pole is common
at 5 weeks. However, it is important to establish
whether the woman is sure of her dates and
whether her cycle is regular; if not, the estimated
gestation may be wrong. If she conceived while
taking the pill then the last period cannot be
relied upon to predict the gestation as it was a
hormonally induced withdrawal bleed.

Presenting complaint
Bleeding
Some women might not realise that there is a problem
with their pregnancy until they have a scan (see Fig. 9.2).
Miscarriage does not always start with heavy bleeding,
and the loss seen with ectopic pregnancy is variable,
so the amount of bleeding cannot be used to predict
the problem unless the woman has seen products of
conception mixed with the bleeding, in which case
she is having an inevitable miscarriage. Products may
be described as ‘pieces of tissue’. Heavy blood flow will
form clots that can be described as being ‘like liver’ – it is
worth asking the woman the size of the clots in relation
to coins (‘Were they 5p-sized or 50p-sized?’). You can
often quantify the blood flow by asking how many pads
she has needed to change in a day.
Fig. 9.1 Differential diagnosis for bleeding in early
pregnancy
• Threatened miscarriage, ongoing pregnancy (see
Chapter 32)
• Non-viable pregnancy (complete, incomplete or delayed
miscarriage; see Chapter 32)
• Molar pregnancy (see Chapter 32)
• Ectopic pregnancy (see Chapter 32)
• Local cause, e.g. cervical ectropion or carcinoma (see
Chapter 24)

left in the uterus in a case where the patient has had
bleeding. The cervix will be closed on examination

Incomplete

Scan shows that there are products of conception left
inside the uterus in a case where the patient has
bleeding. The cervix will be open on examination

The woman might connect the onset of bleeding to
an event such as intercourse or exercise. It is possible for
the cervix, which is more friable in pregnancy, to bleed
postcoitally but actual miscarriage is not provoked by
intercourse. It is important to emphasise this point as
many women will blame themselves for the miscarriage.

Pain
Miscarriage typically causes cramping, central, lower
abdominal pain. The patient might describe it as
‘like period pains’ or ‘like contractions’. It might have
started suddenly or could have been preceded by days
or weeks of spotting.
The pain of a tubal ectopic pregnancy may be
worse on one side than the other, and centred around
the iliac fossa. There might have been dyspareunia on
that side over the previous few days and, as a result
of blood irritating the bowel, the woman might have
had some diarrhoea. If an ectopic pregnancy ruptures
it causes pain all over the abdomen and referred
shoulder-tip pain because of blood irritating the
inferior surface of the diaphragm.

Past obstetric history
A history of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy
increases the risk of these problems happening again
(see Chapter 32).

Past medical history
This should focus on any conditions that predispose
to ectopic pregnancy (see Fig. 9.3 and Chapter 32).

44

Also remember that a woman who has a non-viable
or an ectopic pregnancy might need an operation
so attention should be paid to conditions that may
affect fitness for anaesthetic.

Examining Women with Pain
and/or Bleeding in
Early Pregnancy

Observations
The woman might be experiencing significant pain
if the uterus is expelling clots or products, or if an
ectopic pregnancy has ruptured. Her pulse and blood
pressure should be measured.
Miscarriage is unlikely to cause shock due to
hypovolaemia but, rarely, cervical shock is seen,
in which there is a vagal response to the dilatation
caused by products of conception distending the
cervical canal. In this case pulse and blood pressure
would both be low.
Haemorrhage from a ruptured ectopic pregnancy
can be massive; the pulse will be weak and tachycardic
and blood pressure will be low. The patient will look
pale, sweaty and unwell and might collapse.

Abdominal examination
With miscarriage, the abdomen will be soft. If
more than 12 weeks, or if the uterus is fibroid, it
might be palpable above the symphysis pubis.
With ectopic pregnancy the uterus will not be

be tenderness on the affected side, and there might
be some guarding and rebound. Once ruptured,
the entire abdomen will be tense and tender with
guarding and rebound.

Cusco’s speculum examination
The cervix should be visualized and swabs taken from
the endocervix and vagina. An ectropion or, rarely,
a cervical carcinoma, might be visible. It might be
possible to see if the os is open or closed but this is
best determined by palpation.

An ectropion is not
pathological – it is simply an
extension of endocervical
columnar epithelium, which bleeds easily, onto the
ectocervix and is common in pregnancy due to the
influence of oestrogen. Bleeding from an ectropion
is usually light but can be heavier if provoked by
intercourse or in the presence of infection, so cervical
swabs should be taken. No treatment is necessary
unless infection is proven.

9

Vaginal examination
Is the os open or closed? This finding is vital to help the
diagnosis until a scan is available. In early pregnancy, if
the woman has had a labour in the past, the external os
may be open (‘multip’s os’) but the internal os should
be closed, so this question refers to the internal os. If
it is open there will be no resistance, and the cervix
will admit a finger. An open os indicates an inevitable
miscarriage; a closed os might be seen with miscarriage
(see Fig. 9.2) or with ectopic pregnancy. The uterine
size in weeks should be estimated. The adnexa should
be examined – an ectopic pregnancy may cause full­
ness and tenderness on the affected side. Cervical
excitation is present with an ectopic pregnancy.

Cervical excitation pain is sudden
severe pain that occurs when the
cervix is moved at the time of
vaginal examination. This is different from the discomfort
that many women feel at the time of examination.

Investigation of Bleeding
and/or Pain in
Early Pregnancy
Figure 9.4 provides an algorithm for the diagnosis
and investigation of bleeding and/or pain in early
pregnancy.

Blood tests
• Full blood count: the woman is unlikely to be
anaemic due to the bleeding of a threatened
miscarriage but there might be pre-existing
anaemia, which will be important from an
anaesthetic point of view. An ectopic, if ruptured,
may result in severe anaemia. Electrophoresis, if
appropriate, must also be requested.
• Blood group: women who are Rhesus negative
will require anti-D after an operation for ectopic
pregnancy, after an evacuation of the retained
products of conception (ERPC) at any gestation
or after an episode of bleeding after 12 weeks.
• The serum β-hCG level can be helpful in
diagnosing an asymptomatic ectopic pregnancy.
An intrauterine pregnancy should be seen on a
transvaginal scan with levels of above 1500.

Ultrasound scan
Transvaginal scans give the best view in early
pregnancy (Fig. 9.5). The uterus is examined, looking
for a gestation sac and fetal pole, and then for a fetal
heartbeat. If the uterus is empty, raising the possibility
of ectopic pregnancy, the adnexa are scanned, looking
for a mass. Sometimes a live ectopic is seen, where
the ectopic gestation sac contains a fetus with a
heartbeat. Free fluid, due to bleeding from the ectopic
pregnancy, might be seen in the pouch of Douglas.
With a miscarriage, retained products of conception
may be seen.

Once a fetal heartbeat is seen on
ultrasound scan there is a 90% chance of
the pregnancy continuing and the woman
can be reassured. Fetal heart activity can be seen from
around 7 weeks gestation.

and examination as above, remembering to consider
the causes listed in Chapter 32. Extra investigations
should also be considered:
• Karyotyping of both partners and of products of
conception where appropriate.
• An ultrasound scan (USS) to assess the uterine
cavity and the ovaries. This has been shown to
be as useful and more acceptable to patients
as hysterosalpingography. It is also, unlike the
hysterosalpingogram (HSG), without the risk of
infection.
• A high vaginal swab (HVS) to screen for bacterial
vaginosis.
• Antiphospholipid antibodies assay on two
occasions at least 6 weeks apart. The test is
performed twice to avoid the false negatives that
occur due to fluctuations in antibody levels, and
the false positives caused by a temporary rise in
levels at times of viral illness. If the two results
are different, the test is repeated. The diagnosis is
made after two positive results.
• Cervical weakness is best diagnosed by careful
history taking, where there will be a story of
painless cervical dilatation or spontaneous
rupture of membranes in the second trimester.
Transvaginal scan of the cervical canal can aid
diagnosis, showing an open internal os and short
canal.

trimesters of pregnancy

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with bleeding in
the second or third trimesters of pregnancy
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with bleeding in the second or third
trimesters of pregnancy
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with bleeding in the
second or third trimesters of pregnancy in order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis
of Bleeding
Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as
vaginal bleeding from 24 weeks gestation, that is, it
is a separate entity from bleeding in early pregnancy
associated with miscarriage (see Chapter 9). Fig. 10.1
gives an overview of the differential diagnoses.
Placenta praevia and placental abruption are
associated with increased maternal and fetal
morbidity and mortality. The majority of bleeding is
unexplained.

History to Focus on
the Differential Diagnosis
of Bleeding
Fig. 10.2 gives a table for diagnosis of antepartum
haemorrhage. Important points to elicit are:
• Amount of bleeding.
• Association with abdominal pain
• Association with mucoid discharge.
There might be an obvious trigger event such as
recent sexual intercourse (causing bleeding from a

Fig. 10.1 Differential diagnosis of antepartum
haemorrhage

With any bleeding in pregnancy, the
patient must be assessed and the amount
of bleeding should be measured as
accurately as possible; resuscitation of the patient
must be initiated if necessary. Don’t forget ABC.

It is important to note that perinatal mortality
following even minor episodes of bleeding is double
that of a normal pregnancy. Also, a patient who
presents with an APH has an associated risk of a
postpartum haemorrhage (PPH).

cervical lesion) or a road traffic accident (causing a
placental abruption). The result of the patient’s last
smear test is relevant to exclude a cervical cause for
the bleeding. The patient should be asked about the
presence of fetal movements.
The presence or absence of constant abdominal
pain is particularly important because it will help in
the clinical differentiation between a placenta praevia
and an abruption (see Chapter 34). Remember that
a placental abruption does not have to be associated
with visible bleeding – a concealed abruption.
Pain may also be caused by uterine contractions. With
an abruption, the uterine myometrium becomes
infiltrated by blood which can initiate contractions
or simply make the uterus irritable.

The presence of abdominal pain typically
distinguishes placental abruption from
placenta praevia.

Examination of Patients Who
have Bleeding in the Second
and Third Trimesters
The aim is to assess maternal and fetal well-being.

Maternal well-being
• Pulse and blood pressure.
• Pallor.
• Abdominal palpation to elicit uterine tenderness
and/or uterine contractions.
• Speculum examination to exclude cervical
abnormalities.
• Digital examination if the patient appears to be
in labour, to assess cervical change but only if
placenta praevia has been excluded.

Fetal well-being
• Abdominal palpation to assess the lie and
presentation of the fetus, as well as engagement
of the presenting part; it might be difficult to
palpate fetal parts in the case of an abruption.
• Auscultation of the fetal heart to determine fetal
viability.

50

Investigation of Patients
Who have Bleeding in the
Second and Third Trimesters

Blood tests
Initial investigations include taking blood for a
haemoglobin level, clotting profile and to group and
save serum. Blood might need to be cross-matched if
the bleeding is heavy, especially with a major placenta
praevia. A Kleihauer test should be sent in the case
of a suspected placental abruption. Fetal red blood
cells are seen in maternal blood. If a patient is Rhesus
negative, she should be given anti-D immunoglobulin
to prevent haemolytic disease of the newborn in a
future pregnancy.

Even with a minor degree of antepartum
bleeding, the patient should be given
anti-D immunoglobulin if she is Rhesus
negative, after 12 weeks gestation.

Fetal monitoring
A cardiotocograph (CTG) should be done to confirm
fetal well-being after 26 weeks gestation. It will
also assist in monitoring uterine activity, either
established contractions or an irritable uterus.

Ultrasound scan
Part of the routine 20-week anomaly scan is to
check the placental site. An ultrasound scan should
be arranged if it has not already been done. This
can be performed by the transvaginal route to
check the position of the leading placental edge
in relation to the internal cervical os, particularly
if the placenta is posterior. It is important to
differentiate between major and minor placenta
praevia (see Chapter 34).
The scan might also reveal a retroplacental
haematoma suggesting placental abruption, but this
diagnosis is normally made on clinical grounds –
a small haematoma might be missed on scan,
especially if the placenta is posterior.

Management of patients who have bleeding in the second and third trimesters

Management of Patients Who
have Bleeding in the Second
and Third Trimesters
Management of the pregnancy depends on the amount
of bleeding, the condition of the mother and the fetus
and the likely cause of the bleeding. If a cervical cause
is suspected, the patient might need to be referred for
further investigations, such as colpscopy (see Chapter
24). Fig. 10.2 gives an algorithm for the management
of antepartum haemorrhage.

Placenta praevia
Conservative management is appropriate if the
bleeding is only mild to moderate in the second
trimester, especially in a preterm pregnancy.

10

If delivery is anticipated in such a case then
intramuscular steroids should be administered to
improve fetal lung maturity (see Chapter 41).
Inpatient care is advised for women with major
placenta praevia after 36 weeks because of the
unpredictability of the timing of labour and the
potential for heavy vaginal bleeding. If the placenta
is within 2 cm of the internal cervical os, caesarean
section is necessary and should be performed by a
senior obstetrician and a senior anaesthetist.

Placental abruption
Again, with mild to moderate bleeding, expectant
management is appropriate. However, depending
on the clinical scenario, immediate delivery might
be necessary in the interests of the mother and the
fetus.

­second and third
trimesters of pregnancy

11

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with abdominal
pain in the second and third trimesters of pregnancy
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with abdominal pain in the second and
third trimesters of pregnancy
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with abdominal pain in the
second and third trimesters of pregnancy in order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis of
Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy
The important differential diagnosis when assessing
abdominal pain in pregnancy is whether the cause is
obstetric or non-obstetric. Fig.11.1 shows the systems
that might be involved.

Don’t forget to take a history
which includes the nonobstetric causes of abdominal
pain. Some of them are more common than the
obstetric causes, such as a urinary tract infection.

History to Focus on the
Differential Diagnosis of
Abdominal Pain in Pregnancy
With diverse differential diagnoses, the history
is very important to identify the cause of the pain.
Fig.11.2 gives a summary of the points elicited from
the history and examination that help to make the
diagnosis.

Current obstetric history
This should include the current gestation and the
parity. The antenatal history may be relevant. For

example, if the patient has a history of pregnancyinduced hypertension (see Chapter 35) then she is
at risk of pre-eclampsia and placental abruption (see
Chapter 10). She may have already been admitted
earlier in the pregnancy with suspected preterm labour
(see Chapter 41) or with a urinary tract infection.

Differential diagnosis

Clinical features

Labour (see Chapter 38)

Intermittent pain, usually regular in frequency, associated with uterine
tightenings. The presenting part of the fetus is usually engaged.
Vaginal examination shows cervical change

Placental abruption (see Chapter 34)

Mild or severe pain, more commonly associated with vaginal bleeding.The uterus
is usually tender on palpation and can be irritable or tense. There might be
symptoms and signs of pre-eclampsia

Symphysis pubis dysfunction

Pain is usually low and central in the abdomen just above the symphysis pubis,
which is tender on palpation. Symptoms are worse with movement

Ligament pain

Commonly described as sharp pain, which is bilateral and often associated
with movement

Pre-eclampsia/HELLP syndrome
(see Chapter 35)

Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea and vomiting,
headache and visual disturbances. On examination, there is hypertension
and proteinuria

Acute fatty liver of pregnancy

Epigastric or right upper quadrant pain, associated with nausea, vomiting,
anorexia and malaise

Ovarian cyst (see Chapter 23)

Unilateral pain, which is intermittent and might be associated with vomiting

Uterine fibroid (see Chapter 21)

Pain is localized and constant. Fibroid is noted on palpation and is tender

Constipation

Usually suggested by the history, can cause lower abdominal discomfort
and bloating

Appendicitis

Pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Tenderness with guarding and
rebound might be localized to the right iliac fossa

Gallstones/cholecystitis

Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain, which might radiate to the back or to
the shoulder tip. Tenderness in the right hypochondrium and pyrexia with
cholecystitis

Pancreatitis

Epigastric pain radiating to the back, associated with nausea and vomiting.
Occurs most commonly in the third trimester

Peptic ulcer

Epigastric pain associated with food. There might be heartburn, nausea and
even haematemesis

Cystitis

Usually suggested by history, with pain and tenderness in the low abdomen
or suprapubically

Renal stones/renal colic/
pyelonephritis

Loin pain that might radiate to the abdomen and groin, possibly associated
with vomiting and rigors. Pyrexia is present with pyelonephritis

Nature: continuous or intermittent.
Quality: stabbing or burning or tightening.

It is important to ask about other symptoms,
particularly gastrointestinal and genitourinary,
such as frequency of bowel habit, vomiting or
dysuria.

Past obstetric history
A history of pre-eclampsia or preterm labour in a
previous pregnancy puts the patient at increased risk
in her current pregnancy.

fibroids. There might be a history of peptic ulcer
disease or gallstones. If the patient has previously
had an appendicectomy or a cholecystectomy, these
differential diagnoses can be excluded.

Examination of the Patient
Who has Abdominal Pain
in Pregnancy

General examination
As with any clinical examination, the general condition
of the pregnant patient should be assessed, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Temperature.
Pulse.
Blood pressure.
Respiratory rate.
Cardiovascular system.
Respiratory system.

Abdominal palpation
The abdomen should be inspected for any previous
operation scars. In the presence of a gravid uterus,
abdominal palpation to establish the cause of the
symptoms may not be straightforward. Compared
with examining a non-pregnant patient, the site of
the tenderness might not be typical. Examining a
non-pregnant patient who has an ovarian cyst torsion
is likely to elicit tenderness and guarding in the iliac
fossa. Depending on the gestation, this might not be
so specific in a pregnant patient because the gravid
uterus interferes with the usual anatomical markings.
Tenderness at McBurney’s point, which is typical of
appendicitis (see Crash Course in Surgery) may be
difficult to elicit in a patient who is late in the second or
in the third trimester of pregnancy for a similar reason.

11

The uterus should be palpated to determine:
• Lie, presentation and engagement of the fetus
(see Chapter 46).
• Presence of uterine contractions.
• Generalized or specific uterine tenderness.
• Presence of uterine fibroids.

Vaginal examination
A speculum examination is appropriate to exclude
cervical causes of bleeding (see Chapter 34). A digital
examination may be indicated if the history and
abdominal palpation suggest that the patient is in
labour, in order to determine if there is cervical change
(see Chapter 38).

Investigation of the Patient
Who has Abdominal Pain
Fig.11.3 gives a summary of the investigations that
should be considered and Fig. 11.4 provides an
algorithm for the investigation of abdominal pain.

Blood tests
Full blood count/clotting studies
The full blood count can show a reduced haemoglobin
if the patient is bleeding, for example in the case of a

Summary of abdominal pain investigations

When examining an obstetric patient,
remember that she might feel faint if
she lies flat on her back for too long,
secondary to pressure on the large vessels reducing
venous return to the heart and causing supine
hypotension. She should be examined with left
lateral tilt.

placental abruption. The platelet count might be low
in association with pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome
(haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets).
This may be associated with abnormal clotting studies.
A group and save sample of serum is essential if there
is ongoing bleeding, in case cross-matched blood is
required for transfusion. With the non-obstetric causes
of pain, the white blood cell count will be raised if
there is infection, for example, with pyelonephritis or
cholecystitis.

Urea/electrolytes/glucose/liver
function tests
In pre-eclampsia or HELLP syndrome, urea, creatinine
and the liver transaminases can be raised. Serum uric
acid is also high in pre-eclampsia and in acute fatty
liver. The latter is associated with hypoglycaemia.

Urinalysis/midstream urine
sample
In pre-eclampsia, there is proteinuria on dipstick
urinalysis and a 24-h urine collection will quantify
the amount of protein in order to determine the
severity of the disease. In some units, this is assessed
by doing a urine protein-to-creatinine ratio on a
single sample. Proteinuria may also present with a
urinary tract infection and might be associated with
microscopic haematuria, particularly in the presence
of renal stones.

56

Cardiotocograph
Before 24 weeks gestation, the fetal heart should be
auscultated with a pinard or a sonicaid. A cardioto­co­
graph is performed after 24–26 weeks gestation
(see Chapter 15) and will help determine fetal wellbeing, particularly in the case of placental abruption.
The recording will also detect uterine activity
including the presence and frequency of uterine
contractions.

Ultrasound scan (uterus/ovaries/
kidneys/liver/gallbladder)
Although generally a clinical diagnosis, an obstetric
scan might show a retroplacental haematoma in the
case of severe placental abruption. If preterm delivery
is necessary, for example in acute fatty liver, fetal wellbeing and growth should be assessed, and the fetal
weight estimated to inform the paediatricians.
For the other systems, ultrasound examination can
assist diagnosis and management. An ovarian cyst
might be seen if haemorrhage, rupture or torsion of
the cyst is suspected. Renal stones or gallstones can
be visualized.

Management of the Patient
with Abdominal Pain
This depends on the cause of the pain and the
gestation of the pregnancy. With regard to the

Management of the patient with abdominal pain
obstetric causes, caesarean section or induction of
labour might need to be considered. In severe preeclampsia, for example, the benefits of delivery to the
mother’s health can outweigh the risks to the fetus of
preterm birth. Placental abruption might be severe
enough to compromise the fetus, and then delivery
should be expedited.
However, most conditions can be managed
conservatively. This includes analgesia in the presence
of renal stones, or antibiotics for pyelonephritis.
Multidisciplinary management with other specialties
is important, for example with gastroenterology
in a patient suspected of having gallstones or a

11

peptic ulcer. Depending on the clinical findings, an
operation is necessary for an acute appendicitis or for
ovarian torsion.

Remember to liaise with other
specialists in the management
of conditions such as renal
stones or cholecystitis. In the case of preterm labour,
discuss management with the paediatricians.

Large- or small-for-dates

12

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with a
large-­for-dates (LFD) or small-for-dates (SFD) uterus
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with a large-for-dates (LFD) or
small-for-dates (SFD) uterus
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with a large-for-dates
(LFD) or small-for-dates (SFD) uterus in order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis
The growth of a pregnancy is estimated by measuring
the symphysis–fundal height (see Chapter 46). This
takes into account the size of the fetus, the liquor
volume and the maternal structures, including the
uterus. Before deciding whether it is abnormal or
not, the dates of the last menstrual period and the
previous scan reports should be checked to confirm
the gestation of the pregnancy, and also whether it is
a singleton pregnancy.
The differential diagnoses of the large-for-dates
(LFD) or small-for-dates (SFD) uterus can be
considered in two categories:
1. Fetal/placental.
2. Maternal.
A fetus found to be SFD can be categorized according
to its growth pattern diagnosed with serial ultrasound
scans:
• small for gestational age (SGA): the fetus is small
for the expected size at a certain gestation but
continues to grow at a normal rate
• intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR): the fetus
is small or normal-sized for the expected size at a
certain gestation but the growth rate slows down
as the pregnancy advances

History to Focus on the
Differential Diagnosis
of a LFD or SFD uterus

Past obstetric history
With respect to the LFD uterus, a patient who had
gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy is at risk
of developing the same condition again (see Chapter
36). This disorder puts the pregnancy at risk of fetal
macrosomia and polyhydramnios (increased liquor
volume).
A previous history of a baby that was SGA or
IUGR, whether in relation to pre-eclampsia or
not, increases the risk of a future pregnancy being
similarly affected.

Past gynaecological history
A diagnosis of uterine fibroids or an ovarian cyst, either
prior to pregnancy or in early pregnancy can cause the
symphysis–fundal height to palpate as LFD.

Past medical history
Diabetes mellitus increases the chance of fetal
macrosomia and polyhydramnios. The abdomen will
palpate LFD, as in gestational diabetes. Fetal infection

59

Large- or small-for-dates
with toxoplasmosis cytomegalovirus, rubella or
herpes, may produce polyhydramnios so the mother
should be asked about recent flu-like illness or rash.
Current maternal disease increases the risk of IUGR
and therefore a SFD uterus (see Chapter 36):
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Renal disease including renal transplantation.
Hypertension.
Congenital heart disease.
Severe anaemia.
Sickle-cell disease.
Systemic lupus erythematosus.
Cystic fibrosis.
HIV infection

Family history
In relation to a LFD uterus, a family history of
diabetes mellitus will put the patient at increased
risk of developing gestational diabetes in her current
pregnancy.
There is also evidence that a family history of preeclampsia is relevant. This disorder can be associated
with IUGR (see Chapter 35).

Social history
The ethnic group of the patient can be relevant
in a SFD patient. The growth charts used in most
units were derived from Caucasian populations, in
whom the average birthweight is greater than, for
example, an Asian population. Hence some units
have developed customized growth charts for each
particular patient group.
Smoking in pregnancy is a major cause of a fetus
being SGA, so that the abdomen palpates as SFD. It
affects growth in the third trimester. Alcohol and illegal
drug use are also causes of being SGA and so all these
factors must be checked in the antenatal history.

Examination of the Patient
with a LFD or SFD Uterus
Chapter 46 discusses examination of the pregnant
patient and the uterus. Body mass index should be
routinely calculated at the booking visit. If it is below
the normal range, the fetus is at risk of measuring SFD
in the third trimester. Conversely, a raised BMI may
make it difficult to assess fetal size accurately, as well
as increasing the risk of gestational diabetes. In both
situations, it is appropriate to arrange serial growth

60

scans. General examination should also include
checking blood pressure, and urinalysis for proteinuria
or glycosuria. The following should be noted on
abdominal palpation in relation to LFD or SFD:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Symphysis–fundal height.
Number of fetuses.
Fetal lie.
Liquor volume.
Presence of uterine fibroids.
Presence of adnexal masses.

If the symphysis–fundal height is larger or
smaller than expected for the gestation,
check that the dates of the last menstrual
period and the first dating scan agree.

Investigation of the Patient
with a LFD or SFD Uterus
Figs 12.1 and 12.2 provide algorithms for the
investigation of the LFD and SFD uterus.

Blood tests
In the case of a LFD uterus, a glucose tolerance
test should be arranged to establish whether
gestational diabetes has developed (see Chapter
36). If polyhydramnios is found in the absence of
diabetes, fetal infection may be the cause so maternal
antibodies (IgM and IgG) to toxoplasma, rubella,
cytomegalovirus and herpes should be investigated.
A patient who is SFD and is also hypertensive
should be investigated for pre-eclampsia (see Chapter
35). The blood investigations include a full blood
count, liver and renal function tests including a uric
acid level.

If there is no evidence of uteroplacental
insufficiency, the other causes of the
fetus being small-for-dates should be
excluded. Ultrasound scan should examine for fetal
abnormalities and check for signs of in utero infection.
Prior screening for chromosomal abnormalities should
be reviewed.

Ultrasound
Fetal ultrasound
Plotting ultrasound measurements of biparietal
diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference
and femur length on a growth chart is the main
method of monitoring fetal growth, either LFD or
SFD. In the case of SFD, then serial measurements,
at least 2 weeks apart, should be taken to distinguish
between SGA and IUGR.

There are two types of IUGR. Typically, asymmetrical
IUGR is associated with uteroplacental insufficiency,
whereas symmetrical IUGR is more commonly seen
with other conditions. With uteroplacental insufficiency,
the fetus preferentially diverts blood to the vital organs.
There is less blood to the kidneys, and therefore
reduced production of liquor (oligohydramnios), as
well as less storage of glycogen in the fetal liver. The
latter results in a discrepancy between the growth of the
fetal head and the abdomen.

61

Large- or small-for-dates

The fetal causes of oligohydramnios are
related to its ability to produce urine and
thus liquor.
The fetal causes of polyhydramnios are secondary to
its inability to swallow liquor.

Placenta/liquor ultrasound
Trophoblastic disease is usually excluded at the 12-week
dating scan by checking the structure of the placenta
(see Chapter 32). This condition rarely presents later in
pregnancy with a uterus that palpates LFD.
A scan can also be used to measure the liquor
volume objectively. The amniotic fluid index (AFI) is
the sum of the fluid pockets in the four quadrants of
the abdomen.

Maternal ultrasound
Ultrasound scan is useful to diagnose uterine fibroids
or the presence of ovarian cysts.

Doppler studies
In conjunction with growth scans and measurement
of the liquor volume, Doppler waveforms of the

62

blood flow in the uteroplacental and fetoplacental
circulations can be used to assess the SGA or IUGR
fetus. Increased placental vascular resistance, for
example in pre-eclampsia, changes the pattern of the
flow in the umbilical artery. There is normally flow
towards the placenta during fetal diastole. However,
as the placental resistance increases, diastolic flow
becomes absent and then reversed. Other vessels
can also be examined within the fetus, including
the middle cerebral artery and the ductus venosus,
to look for patterns of flow redistribution if the
placental blood flow is insufficient.

Cardiotocography
The CTG can be used to assess the IUGR fetus.
When not in labour, the tracing might be abnormal
when the uteroplacental insufficiency is severe. The
presence of the following should be excluded:
•
•
•
•

Reduced variability.
Bradycardia.
Tachycardia.
Decelerations.

The SGA fetus can only be distinguished from
the IUGR fetus by serial growth scans. Further
investigation includes Doppler studies and
cardiotocography.

Hypertension in pregnancy

13

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with
hypertension in pregnancy
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with hypertension in pregnancy
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with hypertension in
pregnancy in order to establish a diagnosis

Differential Diagnosis of
Hypertension in Pregnancy
Blood pressure problems in pregnancy can be divided
into three groups:
1. Those with pre-existing hypertension.
Women may present with a known history of
hypertension or be found to be hypertensive at
booking in the first trimester.
2. Pregnancy induced hypertension. This is
hypertension presenting in the later part of the
pregnancy with no proteinuria.
3. Proteinuric pregnancy induced hypertension
which is also known as pre-eclampsia. This is a
multisystem disorder, one manifestation being
hypertension with proteinurea, but where renal,
liver and clotting functions may also be affected.
History and examination are aimed at differentiating
between these, remembering that essential hypertension
predisposes to pre-eclampsia.

History

Presenting complaint
The absence of symptoms does not
exclude the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.

The woman is often asymptomatic of her high
blood pressure, which is picked up as part of the
routine antenatal check. Symptoms of pre-eclampsia
are shown in Fig. 13.1. You must ask specifically
about:
 eadache.
• H
• Visual disturbance (in the form of flashing lights,
not the ‘black dots’ associated with postural
hypotension).
• Right upper quadrant or epigastric pain (due to
oedema of the liver capsule).
• Facial swelling.

Past gynaecological history
A history of high blood pressure when taking the oral
contraceptive pill indicates a susceptibility to high
blood pressure in pregnancy.

Past obstetric history
If the blood pressure was high in previous
pregnancies because of essential hypertension it is
very unlikely to be normal in this pregnancy. Preeclampsia, however, does not always recur with every
pregnancy; it is most common in primigravida or in
the first pregnancy with a new partner.

Past medical history
Conditions that predispose to hypertension include
diabetes, renal and cardiac disease.

Family history
Pre-eclampsia does ‘run in families’, with the
strongest association being if the patient’s sister was
affected in her pregnancy. The more severe the preeclampsia and the earlier it occurs in pregnancy the
more likely it is to be familial

• Look for facial oedema – if you are not sure if her
face is swollen, ask her partner or family member
if she looks different.
• Check the blood pressure.

Blood pressure should be
measured with the patient
sitting or lying propped on
pillows, with the arm the same level as the heart, using
the disappearance rather than the muffling of sound as
the cut-off for the diastolic. The correct size of cuff must
be used; if a small cuff is used for a large woman the
blood pressure will be artificially (and worryingly) high.

Drug history
Some women with hypertension prior to pregnancy
might already be on medication. This might need
to be changed to avoid drugs contraindicated in
pregnancy (see Chapter 40).

Investigation of women with hypertension in pregnancy

Investigation of Women with
Hypertension in Pregnancy
Figure 13.2 provides an algorithm for the investigation
of hypertension in pregnancy.

If told that you are to see a
pregnant woman with raised
blood pressure, one of your
first questions must be ‘What does the urinalysis
show?’. The presence of proteinuria raises the
suspicion of pre-eclampsia.

13

Urinalysis
The urine should be tested using a urinary ‘dipstix’ .
The presence of protein may be due to pre-eclampsia
but may also be the result of contamination with
blood, liquor (if the membranes have ruptured),
vaginal discharge or be caused by a UTI. It is
important that the sample is a ‘clean catch’ and a true
mid-stream specimen.
A UTI should be suspected if the proteinurea
is associated with the presence of leucocytes,
especially if nitrites and/or blood are also present.
Pre-eclampsia should not be excluded because of
the presence of a UTI. Send an MSU specimen for
microscopy and culture but continue investigating
pre-eclampsia.

Hyper tension in pregnancy
To quantify proteinuria, a 24-hour urine collection
should be performed. The result is suggestive of preeclampsia if the 24-hour urine protein is more than
0.3 g.

Blood tests
Serum urate concentration, renal function tests, liver
function tests, a full blood count and a clotting screen
should be assessed. The results would be expected to
be normal for pregnancy in women with essential
hypertension (unless there was an underlying cause
for her hypertension such as renal disease) but may
become deranged as pre-eclampsia develops (Fig.
13.3). In pre-eclampsia the following abnormalities
may be found on investigation:

hypertension, if poorly controlled, may also affect
fetal growth.

Supplementary investigations
If there is any suspicion of an underlying cause for
hypertension in pregnancy it should be further
investigated with a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram
(ECG) and echocardiogram, and a 24-h urine
collection for creatinine and for catecholamines (if
phaeochromocytoma is clinically suspected).

Failure to progress
in labour

14

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with failure to
progress in labour
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with failure to progress in labour
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with failure to progress in
labour in order to establish a diagnosis.

Labour and delivery require the interaction of three
components – the passages, the passenger and power –
as part of a dynamic process:
• Passages: the shape and size of the hard bony
pelvis and soft tissues.
• Passenger: the size, presentation and position of
the fetus.
• Power: this is both involuntary (strength and
frequency of uterine contractions) and voluntary
(diaphragm and abdominal muscles).

Labour is a dynamic process that depends
on many factors.

Any of these factors can be involved in the failure
of labour to progress normally. Once the diagnosis of
labour has been made (see Chapter 38), a primiparous
patient is expected to progress at approximately 1 cm/
hour and a multiparous patient at 1–2 cm/hour.
A partogram (Fig. 38.1) gives a graphical
representation of this progress and hence failure to
progress normally can easily be detected (Fig.14.1).
Examination and investigation of the causes of
prolonged labour should be considered in terms of
the three factors above.

History to Focus on the
Differential Diagnosis
The factors below are summarized in Fig.14.2.

Passages
Bony passages
Fig. 38.16 lists some of the abnormalities of the bony
passages that can cause failure to progress in labour.

Soft passages
The patient may have previously been diagnosed –
either prior to pregnancy or on antenatal ultrasound
scans – with uterine fibroids. A cervical fibroid can
interfere with cervical dilatation.
A previous history of cervical surgery can cause
scarring, which may prevent cervical dilatation. This
is particularly relevant with a knife cone procedure,
but seems to be less common with the LLETZ (large
loop excision of the transformation zone) procedure
that is more frequently performed nowadays (see
Chapter 24).
Female circumcision (also known as female genital
mutilation) usually makes the vaginal introitus
smaller and thus can affect progression to normal
vaginal delivery in the second stage of labour.

Passenger
It is often useful in a multiparous patient, to check
the weights of previous deliveries as an assessment of
ability to deliver the current infant.
A history of diabetes, either pre-existing or
gestational, increases the risk of fetal macrosomia.
If the fetal size is out of proportion to the size
of the maternal pelvis, known as cephalopelvic
disproportion or CPD (see Chapter 38), labour may
be slow to progress.

Fig. 14.2 Differential diagnosis of the causes of failure to progress in
labour.

Antenatal diagnosis of a fetal abnormality
can inhibit normal progress. For example, a
congenital goitre causes extension of the neck so
that the normal process of flexion cannot occur. In
anencephaly, a form of spina bifida in which the
fetal skull fails to develop, the head is less able to
engage and therefore labour might not progress
normally.

Power
In general, three or four uterine contractions every
10 min, each lasting approximately 60 s, maintain
adequate progress in labour. The frequency and
length of contractions can be assessed by asking the
patient, palpating the maternal abdomen or checking
the cardiotocograph.

68

In the presence of efficient contractions, a
malposition of the vertex usually corrects;
this might require an oxytocin infusion
to improve contractions, particularly in a primiparous
patient.

Examination
Chapter 46 discusses in detail the examination
of the maternal abdomen and the vagina to assess
the size and position of the fetus. Fig.14.3 gives a
summary. Examination of the patient must also
include checking the colour of the liquor to exclude
meconium. This is relevant when considering fetal
well-being in a patient who is making slow progress.
It should be assessed in conjunction with the fetal
monitoring (see Chapter 15).

Passages and passenger
Short stature puts the patient at risk of CPD and so,
traditionally, maternal height was checked at the
booking visit (see Chapter 45). Nowadays, a body
mass index (BMI) is calculated. A raised BMI may
make it difficult to assess fetal size and presentation,
as well as increasing the risk of developing gestational
diabetes.
At the onset of established labour, the cervix is fully
effaced (Fig. 38.6). However, if progress is slow, it
becomes thicker on palpation as it gets oedematous.
A cervical fibroid should be excluded.

Labour can be slow if the fetus is not in a

Chapter 39) or a malposition (see Chapter 38) cause
failure to progress. The uterus should always be
palpated to check engagement, i.e. how much of the
fetal head is palpable above the pelvic brim.

the overlapping of the skull bones is reducible or
not.

Abdominal palpation assesses the following features
of the contractions:
• F requency.
• Strength.
• L

About one-fifth of vertex presentations in
early labour are occipitoposterior.

Figure14.4 demonstrates how the station of the
presenting part is assessed. Caput and moulding
(see Chapter 38) increase as the progress of the
labour slows. Caput refers to a boggy swelling on the
presenting part as subcutaneous oedema of the scalp
�����������

Investigation
Assessment of the passage and the passenger is
made clinically as described above (Fig.14.3). The
cardiotocograph can be used to assess frequency and
length of uterine contractions, in conjunction with
uterine palpation to assess strength. The monitor also
assesses the risk of fetal hypoxia (see Chapter 15) by
giving information on the fetal heart rate.

This depends on the cause. Artificial rupture of
the membranes (ARM) is thought to release local
prostaglandins and can increase the rate of labour
progression. The strength and frequency of the uterine
contractions can also be improved by administration
of an infusion of intravenous syntocinon. Regular
strong contractions will help to correct a fetal
malposition by rotating the head against the pelvic
floor muscles, as well as improving descent.

However, caution must be exercised in a multiparous
patient. Generally, labour proceeds more rapidly in a
second pregnancy. Therefore, if progress is slow, fetal
size and position must be considered so that excessive
contractions do not put the patient at risk of uterine
rupture.
The presence of good contractions over several
hours but without significant progression in terms
of cervical dilatation and descent of the presenting
part should alert the physician to consider delivery
by caesarean section.

and instrumental delivery considered (see Chapter

Oxytocin infusions can correct prolonged
labour but particular care must be taken if
there is secondary arrest in a multiparous
patient.

Abnormal cardiotocograph
in labour

15

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with an
abnormal cardiotocograph in labour
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with an abnormal cardiotocograph in
labour
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with an abnormal
cardiotocograph in labour in order to establish a diagnosis.

Fetal Monitoring in Labour
The cardiotocograph, or CTG, is a form of electronic
fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring used to evaluate
fetal well-being before and during labour. As well as
the fetal heart rate, the uterine activity is recorded. It
has been used increasingly in the UK since the 1970s,
with the aim of detecting fetal hypoxia before it
causes perinatal mortality or morbidity, in particular
cerebral palsy.
However, the expected reduction in hypoxiainduced intrapartum perinatal mortality has
not occurred and the role of CTG monitoring
has been questioned. The need to educate staff
about CTG interpretation and to audit standards
is essential.

Monitoring in an uncomplicated
pregnancy
Intermittent auscultation of the fetal heart rate may
be appropriate for a healthy woman in labour who
has had an uncomplicated pregnancy. This involves
documenting the heart rate for a minimum of 60 s
at least:
•
•

Every
15 min in the first stage of labour.

Every
5 min in the second stage of labour.


Continuous monitoring might be recommended if
any abnormal features develop or any risk factors
develop, such as meconium-stained liquor.

Who should have continuous
CTG monitoring?
Figure 15.1 shows the maternal and fetal indications
for recommending continuous monitoring.

fetal heart rate (FHR): this is the mean

level of FHR over a period of 5 to 10 min. It is
expressed as beats per minute (bpm) and is
determined by the fetal sympathetic and the
parasympathetic nervous systems. The normal
range is 110–160 bpm. In the preterm fetus, the
baseline tends to be at the higher end of the
normal range.

• Accelerations:
these are increases in the FHR of

feature of a normal CTG.
• Decelerations:
these are falls in the FHR below

the baseline of more than 15 bpm, lasting 15s or
more. Different patterns of decelerations can be
seen, depending on their timing with the uterine
contractions:
●●
Early decelerations: the FHR slows at the
same time as the onset of the contraction
and returns to the baseline at the end of the
contraction.
●●
Late
decelarations: the FHR begins to fall

during the contraction, with its trough more
than 20s after the peak of the contraction
and returning to baseline after the
contraction.
●●
Variable
decelerations: the timing of the

slowing of the FHR in relation to the uterine
contraction varies and can occur in isolation.
There is typically rapid onset and recovery.
However, other features might make this type
of deceleration more suspicious, such as loss
of the normal baseline variability.
●●
Sinusoidal
pattern: there is regular oscillation

of the baseline, with absent variability.
The pattern lasts at least 10 min and has an
amplitude of 5–15 bpm above and below the
baseline.

These conditions can result in a decrease in the
fetal heart rate, with decelerations or bradycardia.
This is produced by chemoreceptor-mediated vagal
stimulation and then by myocardial ischaemia.

Figure15.4 shows how the features of the CTG are
categorized. Figure15.5 shows an abnormal CTG
tracing.

Physiology

Chronic fetal hypoxia
If there has been chronic uteroplacental insufficiency
during the pregnancy, for example secondary to
pre-eclampsia, then the fetus might be at increased
risk of hypoxia during labour. Reduced intervillous
perfusion during uterine contractions or maternal
hypotension can exacerbate underlying reduced
placental perfusion. This can result in an increase
in the fetal cardiac output with an increase in the
baseline heart rate, followed by reduced heart
rate variability due to brainstem hypoxia. Continuing
hypoxia eventually produces myocardial damage and
heart rate decelerations.

The principle of monitoring during labour is to detect
fetal hypoxia and therefore prevent acidaemia and
cell damage.

Acute fetal hypoxia
This can occur secondary to:
•

hyperstimulation.

Abnormal cardiotocograph in labour

Monitoring Uterine
Contractions
As well as monitoring the FHR, the CTG also
monitors the frequency of the uterine contractions.
This can be important, for example, if the patient
is having intravenous oxytocin to stimulate the
contractions. It is essential that frequency of contra­
ctions and the return to resting tone between
contractions is noted.
The actual strength and the length of each
contraction should be checked by palpation of the
uterus, because the size of the peaks shown on the
tracing may be related to positioning of the monitor
on the maternal abdomen or thickness of the
maternal abdominal wall.

Pulse
This might be raised in conjunction with maternal
pyrexia. In the presence of fetal bradycardia,
maternal pulse should be checked to ensure that
the monitoring is recording FHR and not the
mother. This can be excluded by applying a fetal
scalp electrode, provided the cervix is at least 1–2 cm
dilated.

Blood pressure
Epidural anaesthesia can be associated with maternal
hypotension as it is administered. This results in
reduced blood flow to the uterus and can cause
fetal bradycardia. Therefore, intravenous fluids are
administered and blood pressure regularly checked
when the medication is given.

History
of the Patient Who
Presents with an Abnormal
CTG in Labour
The need to act on an abnormal CTG in labour
is influenced by maternal, fetal and intrapartum
factors. Fig.15.1 gives the indications for continuous
CTG monitoring but this list also shows the relevant
points in the patient’s antenatal history that might
make the attending physician more concerned if the
CTG is suspicious.
Particularly important are the intrapartum factors.
In the presence of meconium-stained liquor, for
example, the CTG should be acted upon promptly.
If the cervix is undilated, fetal blood sampling is not
be possible (see below). If progress in labour is slow
(see Chapter 14), then operative delivery might be
necessary.


The size of the maternal abdomen should be assessed
to check if it is large or small for dates (see Chapter
12). The engagement of the presenting part is
important to assess progress in labour (see Chapters
14 and 45). In a patient who has previously had a
caesarean section, the presence of scar tenderness
should be elicited; scar rupture is commonly
associated with an abnormal CTG and vaginal
bleeding. Another cause of vaginal bleeding with an
abnormal CTG is placental abruption (see Chapter
34). If this is suspected, the uterus will typically feel
hard and tender.
The uterine contractions should be palpated,
especially if the patient’s labour is being stimulated
by intravenous oxytocic agents. It is important to
check that the uterus is not hyperstimulated, as this
can cause an abnormal FHR. There should be resting
tone between contractions.

Vaginal examination
As well as assessing the dilatation of the cervix to
determine the progress in labour and the ability to
perform a fetal blood sample, the presence of the
fetal cord must be excluded. A cord prolapse, as it is
known, is associated with a fetal bradycardia, This is

Investigating the
Abnormal CTG
Using the criteria described above, if the CTG is
suspicious, the patient can be managed conservatively
(Fig. 15.6).
If the CTG is pathological, fetal blood sampling
(FBS) should be performed if there are the
appropriate facilities. The procedure is performed
with the mother in the left lateral postion and the

cervix should be dilated at least 2 cm. A sample of
blood from the fetal scalp gives the fetal pH (i.e. a
measure of acidosis). It might indicate that delivery
is necessary (pH ≤7.20), or that the test should be
repeated within 30 min (pH 7.21–7.24).
If FBS is not possible, delivery should be expedited.
Contraindications to FBS are given in Fig. 15.7.

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with bleeding
after delivery
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with bleeding after delivery
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with bleeding after
delivery in order to establish a diagnosis.

Differential Diagnosis
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is bleeding from the
genital tract of more than 500 mL after delivery of the
infant. It is classified as either primary or secondary:
Primary PPH: bleeding more than 500 mL within
24 hours of delivery.
Secondary PPH: bleeding more than 500 mL
that starts 24 hours after delivery and occurs within
6 weeks.
In practice, blood loss of more than 1000 mL
is more clinically relevant. Most units classify
bleeding of more than 2000 mL as Massive Obstetric
Haemorrhage. There is usually a specific local
protocol for management, in light of the Confidential
Enquiry into Maternal Deaths (see Chapter 43).
Figure 16.1 gives the differential diagnoses that
should be considered. About 90% of cases of PPH are
caused by uterine atony; about 7% are due to genital
tract trauma.

In a multiple pregnancy, the placental site is larger

in cases of macrosomia and polyhydramnios (see
Chapter 12).

Risk factors in the patient’s history that suggest an

Bleeding after delivery

When the patient presents
with primary PPH, always ask
the midwife to check that the
placenta and membranes are complete, to exclude
retained products of conception.

presenting complaint is prolonged heavy vaginal
bleeding or persistent offensive discharge. In the
presence of infection, the patient may also present
with fever and lower abdominal pain.
A molar pregnancy also presents with persistent
vaginal bleeding (see Chapter 32). Choriocarcinoma,
though rare, may metastasize to the lungs, liver or
brain. Presenting symptoms include haemoptysis
and dyspnoea or neurological symptoms.

Mode of delivery
The mode of delivery may increase risk of PPH. Genital
tract trauma can occur with a normal vaginal delivery,
either from an episiotomy (see Chapter 40) or from
a vaginal or cervical tear. Bleeding is more common
with an instrumental delivery especially forceps, in
particular Keilland’s forceps (see Chapter 40).

Don’t forget to check the genital tract
for signs of trauma once the placenta has
been delivered.

Average blood loss at caesarean section is 500 mL.
Placenta praevia (see Chapter 34) or a prolonged
labour may increase this. In the latter, the presenting
part may become impacted in the pelvis, making
delivery more difficult. This can cause the incision on
the uterus to tear which may increase blood loss.
Rarely, PPH is secondary to uterine inversion that
occurs after delivery of the placenta (see Chapter 42).
With bleeding, the patient complains of abdominal
pain, which can be severe, associated with a feeling
of prolapse. Rupture of the uterus is also uncommon
except in association with labour in a patient who
has previously had a caesarean section.

Other causes
Coagulation disorders can be acute or chronic.
The chronic conditions such as inherited vascular
disorders are usually known about antenatally. DIC
can present acutely, secondary to placental abruption
or severe pre-eclampsia.

Secondary PPH
In the presence of retained products of conception,
either placenta or membranes, the common

78

Examination

Primary PPH
The blood loss must be estimated as accurately
as possible to manage the patient appropriately.
Examination must include the ABC (airways,
breathing, circulation) of basic resuscitation (see
Chapter 18), as well as pallor, pulse and blood
pressure. Abdominal palpation should assess whether
the uterus is contracted or not. The fundal height
should be at or below the umbilicus. If it is above,
there might be retained products of conception or the
uterus could be filling with clots.

Always remember ABC and basic
examination when the patient presents
with PPH.

Uterine inversion should be considered if the
fundus is indented or cannot be palpated. Vaginal
examination will assess the degree of inversion,
either up to the cervical os or complete inversion of
the uterus and vagina.
If the uterus is well contracted and the placenta
is out, then the bleeding might be from trauma to
the genital tract. The patient should be examined in
sufficient light and with adequate analgesia (either
regional or general) to exclude lacerations to the
cervix, vagina and perineum.
If the placenta and membranes have been
delivered, they must be carefully examined to see that
the cotyledons appear complete and that there is no
suggestion of a succenturiate lobe. The examination
is summarized in Fig. 16.2.

Primary PPH
Having established intravenous access, blood
should be sent for haemoglobin, platelets, clotting
screen including fibrin degradation products, and
serum save. Depending on the estimated blood loss,
cross-matching blood might be necessary. Urea and
electrolytes should be tested if the urine output is
poor.
Figure 16.3 provides an algorithm for the
management of primary PPH.

Fig. 16.2 Examination of the patient who presents with primary
postpartum haemorrhage.

Secondary PPH
Basic observations should include pulse, blood
pressure and temperature. Tachycardia and pyrexia
may be present with endometritis. The height of the
uterine fundus should be checked because the uterus
will usually remain poorly contracted if there are
retained products of conception. Tenderness should
be excluded to rule out endometritis.
Speculum examination excludes vaginal discharge
if there is suspicion of infection. Bimanual palpation
examines the size of the uterus, because it might
be bulky with retained products or with a molar
pregnancy. Tenderness is present with endometritis.

Secondary PPH
A full blood count should be taken to estimate
haemoglobin. A raised white blood cell count is an
indication of infection. Again, cross-matching blood
for transfusion might be necessary, depending on
the clinical situation and the haemoglobin result.
A high vaginal swab should be taken to exclude
endometritis.

with a persistently raised serum β-hCG level.

Evacuation of the uterus will yield tissue for

should be performed to check for metastases.

Stillbirth

17

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient presenting with the
intrauterine death of a fetus
• Perform an examination on a patient presenting with the intrauterine death of a fetus
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient presenting with the intrauterine
death of a fetus in order to establish a diagnosis.

The term ‘stillbirth’ is used to describe the
intrauterine death of a fetus after 24 weeks gestation,
which is diagnosed before or during labour, or at
delivery. The woman might present with symptoms
of the event that caused the baby to die, or simply
attend because she has not felt fetal movements.
Figure 17.1 summarizes the common causes of
stillbirth.

The current national stillbirth rate in the
UK is 5.7 per 1000 deliveries.

If fetal death is suspected antenatally an
ultrasound scan is performed to look for absence
of fetal heart activity. It is recommended that the
finding of intrauterine death is confirmed by a
second sonographer. The rate of stillbirth varies with
maternal age (Fig. 17.2).

History
Finding out when the mother last felt fetal
movements can help to work out how recently
fetal death occurred, but this will not help with the
diagnosis of the underlying cause unless it can be
linked to a particular occurrence.

History of the pregnancy
The following points might be helpful:
• Rhesus
group: if the woman is Rhesus negative

then Rhesus disease is a possibility. The mother
might describe suddenly feeling bigger due to
polyhydramnios.
• Down
syndrome screening: if the woman is

high risk, a chromosomal abnormality might be
present.
• Ultrasound
for anomaly/growth: any structural

abnormalities or a history of IUGR increases the
risk of stillbirth.
• Recurrent
antepartum haemorrhage: repeated

small abruptions can compromise fetal wellbeing and cause IUGR. Abruption is painful so
ask about bleeding and pain.
• Ruptured
membranes allow infection to

ascend and infect the membranes and placenta
(chorioamnionitis) and therefore the fetus. Ask
about any leaking of fluid.
• Obstetric
cholestasis causes a characteristic

pattern of itching affecting particularly the
palms of the hands and the soles of the feet (see
Chapter 36). Remember to ask about itching.
Signs of maternal illness (fever, feeling unwell, flulike symptoms, gastrointestinal upset) are also
suggestive of fetal infection. Listeria, toxoplasma and
parvovirus can cause only very mild illness in the
mother but death in the fetus.

discovered. Rhesus disease gets more severe with
successive pregnancies, so a first child might be
unaffected or suffer only mild jaundice. Gestational
diabetes in a previous pregnancy is likely to recur.

Past medical history
Maternal medical conditions such as diabetes and
renal disease increase the risk of stillbirth. A personal
or family history of thrombosis might point to an
underlying thrombophilia.

Examination
If one twin dies in a dichorionic
twin pregnancy, the chance of
the other twin dying is <5%,
so if the pregnancy is preterm the mother can be
managed expectantly. There is a risk that she could
develop coagulopathy so her platelets need to be
monitored regularly. If one of a pair of monochorionic
twins dies compromise of the other twin is far more
likely, so delivery is advisable.

General examination
The mother’s pulse, blood pressure and temperature
are taken. Maternal infection may cause tachycardia
and pyrexia. A significant bleed due to abruption or
bleeding placenta praevia may cause hypovolaemic
shock. The itching of cholestasis might be evident
from scratch marks on the skin – there is no rash in
obstetric cholestasis.

Examination of the uterus
Past obstetric history

Assess the following:

If the woman has had a previous stillbirth it is
important to find out if an underlying cause was

• Uterine
size: small-for-dates suggests IUGR or

that the fetus died some time ago; large-for-dates

82

17

Follow-up
might be due to polyhydramnios (diabetes,
Rhesus disease, twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome).
• Uterine
consistency: abruption causes the uterus

to feel tense, tender and hard, and it might be
irritable (i.e. palpation provokes contractions).
With chorioamnionitis the uterus will be soft and
tender and might be irritable.
• Fetal
presentation: breech presentation is associated

with fetal abnormality and cord prolapse.

Investigations

Urinalysis
The urine is tested by dipstix, looking particularly
for protein as a sign of pre-eclampsia. If significant
proteinuria is found a 24-hour collection is
commenced, and an MSU is sent to exclude
infection.

Blood tests
The tests below are sent to investigate the cause of
fetal death.
• Full
blood count and a sample for group and save

should be sent due to the risk of disseminated
intravascular coagulation (DIC) following stillbirth:
• HbA1c
(glycosylated haemoglobin): if raised this

suggests maternal diabetes.
• Coombs’
test to look for evidence of Rhesus

disease.
• Infection
screen: blood cultures and antibody

levels for toxoplasma, parvovirus, listeria, and
syphilis.
• Kleihauer
test: looks for evidence of fetomaternal

haemorrhage, as can occur with abruption.
• Thrombophilia
screen.


Ultrasound scan
Once the diagnosis of fetal death has been made,
a scan will not add much information unless the
parents do not wish post-mortem of the baby, in
which case the scan is an opportunity to look for
evidence of internal structural anomalies.

Pathology
Parents are encouraged to allow post-mortem
examination of their baby so that all possible

information is collected. They should be reassured
that this will not prevent them from arranging a
funeral or cremation for the baby. Post-mortem
includes examination of the placenta and a fetal
karyotype. If the parents do not consent to the
full post-mortem they should be offered a more
limited examination comprising X-rays and external
examination of the baby, or solely examination of the
placenta.

Management of Stillbirth
In most cases, labour is induced using prostaglandins
and/or oxytocin infusion. Occasionally a caesarean
section may be requied if the mother is unwell and
delivery needs to be expedited, or because induction
of labour would pose a significant risk, for example
if the mother had had several caesarean sections in
the past.
Some women will opt to continue the pregnancy.
More than 90% will spontaneously labour within
3 weeks. By 4 weeks after fetal death (which might
have occurred some time before diagnosis) there is
a 1 in 4 risk of developing coagulopathy, so these
women should have their platelets levels and clotting
studies monitored regularly.

After death the fetal body
releases procoagulant factors
into the mother’s circulation
leading to intravascular coagulation. Clotting factors
and platelets are consumed and fibrin deposited,
resulting in disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC), which may cause catastrophic haemorrhage.

After delivery the parents should be encouraged
to hold their baby if they so wish. Footprints,
handprints and photographs can be taken and the
parents might choose to have some form of blessing
or religious ceremony at this stage. The mother may
be prescribed cabergoline to suppress lactation.

Follow-up
Psychological and social support is extremely
important. Prior to the woman leaving hospital the

83

Stillbirth
GP and community midwife should be informed,
and any antenatal clinic appointments cancelled.
The mother should be seen for at least 10 days by
the midwife for postnatal checks. Information about
parent support groups (e.g. SANDS, the Stillbirth and
Neonatal Death Society) should be given.

84

A follow-up appointment should be made with
the consultant, who often chooses to see the parents
in the gynaecology rather than antenatal clinic. All
the results will be reviewed and any questions can be
answered, even if only to explain that the stillbirth
was unexplained.

Maternal collapse

18

Objectives
By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
• Understand the important points in the history for a patient collapsing on the maternity
ward
• Perform an examination on a patient collapsing on the maternity ward
• Undertake appropriate investigations on a patient collapsing on the maternity ward in
order to establish a diagnosis.

Collapse of a patient on the maternity ward or
delivery suite might have an obstetric or a nonobstetric cause. The danger, when faced with a
collapsed pregnant woman, is to prioritize delivery
because of fears for the fetus. However, it is important
to remember that maternal resuscitation is the single
most effective means of improving fetal health;
delivery, if necessary, should be contemplated only
when the mother is stable.

The principles of first-line
management are the same in
all situations; call for help and
check:
• airway
• breathing

• circulation

If antenatal, establish fetal monitoring once the
mother’s initial resuscitation has commenced.

Haemorrhage
Antenatal bleeding sufficient to cause collapse will
usually be due to placental bleeding, either placental
abruption or placenta praevia. Figure 18.1 summarizes
the different presentations (see also Chapter 10).
Uterine rupture can also cause collapse with bleeding.
Postnatal bleeding (post-partum haemorrhage) causes
are shown in Figure 18.2 and is covered in Chapter 17.

Placental abruption and
placenta praevia
Major obstetric haemorrhage can be extremely rapid
and is potentially fatal, so coordinated management
between midwives, obstetricians, anaesthetists and
the blood bank is vital. Abruption severe enough
to cause collapse or fetal distress is likely to be
associated with blood loss of at least 1500 mL and a
30% incidence of coagulopathy.

Always remember antepartum
haemorrhage from abruption or placenta
praevia predisposes to post partum
haemorrhage.

It can be difficult to control bleeding from the
placental site during caesarean section for placenta
praevia. Oxytocin infusion is used but further
measures might be required, including ergometrine,
the prostaglandin analogues carboprost (Hemabate)
and misoprostol, bimanual compression, B-Lynch
suture, internal iliac ligation and, in extremis,
hysterectomy. Recently, arterial embolization by
radiologists has provided another alternative.

Uterine rupture
Uterine rupture is uncommon. Occasionally, trauma
might be the cause (e.g. road traffic accident), but
more commonly the woman is multiparous and

increases the risk still further. Symptoms and signs

Resuscitation and laparotomy are needed.

Uterine atony
When the uterus fails to contract following delivery
of the placenta, the blood vessels that supplied the
placenta’s huge circulation are not constricted by
compression, so uterine bleeding continues. Risk
factors include:
•
•
•
•

Precipitate
labour.

Induced
labour.

Augmented
labour (syntocinon infusion).

Caesarean
section following prolonged/

augmented labour.
• Magnesium
sulphate treatment.

• Multiple
pregnancy.

• Chorioamnionitis.


86

If medical treatment (syntocinon, ergometrine,
Hemabate) fails, consider packing the uterus,
radiological arterial embolization, or surgery –
internal iliac artery ligation, B-Lynch suture or
hysterectomy.

Amniotic Fluid Embolism
This poorly understood condition results in transient
pulmonary hypertension, profound hypoxia, left
ventricular failure and secondary coagulopathy. Fetal
and maternal mortality is high. The use of syntocinon
and rapid labour are known to be risk factors, but
amniotic fluid embolism (AFE) can also occur in
non-augmented labours.
The diagnosis might only be discovered postmortem but could also be made on the basis of the
characteristic trio of:
• Cyanosis.
• Collapse.

• Clotting
derangement (DIC).

Management consists of ventilatory support and
correction of the coagulopathy.

Acute Myocardial Infarction
Antenatal myocardial infarction (MI) carries a
mortality of up to 45%. The resuscitation algorithm
is the same as that for non-pregnant adults but the
woman must be tilted onto her left side to reduce
the compression of the vena cava by the pregnant
abdomen (Fig. 18.3). If it is felt that the fetus is
compromising the resuscitation, delivery should be
achieved. A senior cardiologist should be involved at
an early stage.

Eclampsia
Chapter 42 outlines the presentation and manage­
ment of eclampsia. In summary, the management
begins with controlling the fit. A magnesium sulphate
infusion is started as prophylaxis against further fits.
The blood pressure must be reduced to mean arterial
pressure (MAP) levels of less than 125 mmHg.
Delivery of the fetus should be considered at this
point.

Maternal collapse

Diabetic Emergency
Management of diabetic coma is described in Crash
Course on General Medicine. In the acute setting it is
more likely to be due to hypoglycaemia, especially
as the delicate balance of tight control in pregnancy
and after delivery can be very difficult. Hyperosmolar
non-ketotic coma might be seen in a diabetic woman
who has been unwell at home for some time.

Hypoglycaemia

Don’t forget ‘hypos’ are more common in
pregnancy because fasting blood glucose
levels are lower.

Infuse 50 mL 50% dextrose intravenously over a short
space of time, followed by a saline flush. Check the
blood sugar again 15 min later. Once the woman is
conscious, a 20 g glucose drink is given, followed by a
longer-acting carbohydrate snack or meal. The blood
sugar should be rechecked 1 hour later.

Hyperglycaemia
Rehydration, an insulin infusion to reduce serum
glucose levels and hourly assessment of serum
potassium levels are the main aims of treatment
of this condition. Fetal monitoring might show an
unreassuring CTG but this is likely to improve when
ketosis is corrected.

Drug Toxicity
Maternal collapse could be due to overdose, adverse
effects or allergy to drugs administered by medical
staff, or as a result of drug abuse by the patient.

Local anaesthetic
High spinal anaesthesia occurs when a very high dose
of local anaesthetic is given or due to inadvertent
intravascular injection at the time of epidural
anaesthesia. Paralysis of the respiratory muscles
requiring ventilation results. Warning signs are
hypotension, nausea, dizziness and dyspnoea.

88

Analgesia
Opiates such as pethidine, morphine and dia­m­­­­­orphine are used for pain relief in labour. In high
doses they can cause respiratory depression. Nalo­
xone, an opiate antagonist, will immediately reverse
respiratory depression but has a short duration of
action so a further dose might be needed.
Voltarol is commonly used for postnatal
analgesia. Any drug in this family of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can precipitate
bronchoconstriction in asthmatics. A severe asthma
attack should be treated with IV hydrocortisone and
nebulized salbutamol; ventilatory support might be
necessary.

Magnesium
Magnesium sulphate is used following eclampsia as
prophylaxis against further seizures. Hypermagnesia
can result in coma. The signs of magnesium toxicity
are shown in Fig. 18.4. Calcium gluconate injection

Drug abuse
Opiates, Ecstasy and cocaine can all cause collapse
and coma. Convulsions can result from Ecstasy or
cocaine use, and may be treated with diazepam.
Opiate-induced respiratory depression is reversed
with naloxone.

Puerperal Sepsis
Septic shock can cause collapse. There should be an
attempt to establish the focus of infection, paying
particular attention to the possibility of retained
products of conception. Empirical broad spectrum

the clot. Anticoagulation with heparin is the norm,
but a PE large enough to cause collapse may merit
treatment with streptokinase.

Thromboembolism
Pregnancy is a prothrombotic state, and throm­
boembolism is one of the most common causes of
maternal mortality (see Chapters 36 and 43).

Pulmonary embolism
Smaller pulmonary emboli (PEs) will cause
breathlessness and pleuritic pain but larger emboli
can present with collapse. On examination the

a high mortality; it usually occurs in the puerperium.
There might be focal neurological signs but signs
can be more ‘general’, with convulsions, headache,
photophobia and vomiting being typical. There
might be a fever and raised white cell count.
The diagnosis is made on CT or MRI. Convulsions
should be treated, the patient kept well hydrated and
heparin therapy considered.

Abnormal uterine bleeding

19

Objectives
• The different aetiologies of amenorrhoea and their investigation and treatment will be
discussed
• The importance of the impact of heavy periods will be explained and also the difficulty
in diagnosing true menorrhagia and why this impacts on the treatment of heavy periods
• The importance of investigating postmenopausal bleeding promptly will be explained

Abnormal uterine bleeding is an extremely common
problem experienced by most women at some
time in their life. The causes can be physiological
or pathological and, as long as serious pathology is
excluded, might not require treatment. For normal
menstruation to occur, the following are necessary:
•
•
•
•
•

Hypothalamic function.
Pituitary function.
Ovarian function.
Endometrial function.
Patent cervix and vagina.

Abnormal uterine bleeding can be caused by
malfunction or disease at any of these levels.

Amenorrhoea
This is the term used to describe absence of menstruation.
Lack of menstruation after the age of 16 years is called
primary amenorrhoea and is relatively uncommon.
Secondary amenorrhoea is extremely common and
implies menstruation has occurred in the past but has
been absent for 6 months or more. The most common
causes of secondary amenorrhoea are physiological, most
frequently pregnancy and the menopause.
The causes of amenorrhoea can be broken down
into the following five major categories:
•
•
•
•
•

Central nervous system.
Gonadal dysfunction.
Genital tract disorders.
Endocrine disorders.
Drug therapy.

Investigation policy
Amenorrhoea can be physiological, that is, due to the
premenarche, pregnancy, lactation or the menopause.
When investigating primary amenorrhoea, the
premenarchal state should be diagnosed only if
pathology has been excluded.

Primary amenorrhoea
In general, primary amenorrhoea should be
investigated from the age of 16 years. However, if
pubertal development has not started by the age
of 14 years then investigation is warranted (see
Fig.19.1).
When no pubertal development has occurred by
the age of 14 years then investigation should be as for
delayed puberty (see Chapters 1 and 20).
Where pubertal development is normal, genital
tract anomalies, such as an absent uterus or vagina,
should be excluded by examination or ultrasound
scanning. If normal then investigation should be as
for secondary amenorrhoea (see below).
Incongruous pubertal development can be
caused by chromosomal abnormality or increased
circulating androgens. For instance, women with
testicular feminization often have normal or even
excellent breast development in the absence of
axillary and pubic hair. Poor breast development
in the presence of normal or excessive axillary or
pubic hair is compatible with increased circulating
androgens commonly associated with PCOS, and less
commonly with CAH or androgen-secreting tumours
of the ovary or adrenal.

A woman presenting with true primary
amenorrhoea should always have her
karyotype checked especially in the
absence of pubertal development.

Secondary amenorrhoea
The most common cause of secondary amenorrhoea
in women of childbearing age is pregnancy, and this
should be excluded before further investigation is
commenced.
Having excluded physiological causes of
secondary amenorrhoea, further investigation includes
measurements of serum gonadotrophins, androgens
and prolactin. Other useful investigations include a
pelvic ultrasound scan, which will identify the typical
appearance of polycystic ovaries and the presence of a
haematometra, a lateral skull X-ray, CT or MRI scan of
the head to identify a pituitary tumour and exclusion
of thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus (Fig. 19.2).
Women under 30 years of age who have ovarian failure
should have their chromosomes analysed.

Complications of amenorrhoea
Although amenorrhoea itself does not cause any
complications, some of the underlying conditions
do carry certain risks:
• Women who carry a Y chromosome have a 25%
chance of developing gonadal malignancy,
usually a gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma.
• Hypo-oestrogenic states characteristic of
hypothalamic amenorrhoea and premature

94

ovarian failure are associated with an increased
risk of osteoporosis and ischaemic heart disease.
• Endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial
carcinoma occur more frequently in women with
PCOS because of the unopposed oestrogen effect
on the endometrium associated with chronic
anovulation.
• Haematocolpos is associated with an increased risk
of endometriosis due to retrograde menstruation.
• Amenorrhoeic women are usually subfertile.

Treatment of amenorrhoea
Certain conditions cause primary and secondary
amenorrhoea, depending on the age at which the
condition presents. Their treatment is discussed
under secondary amenorrhoea.

Treatment of primary amenorrhoea
Gonadal dysgenesis
Apart from the management of the psychosexual
aspects of gonadal dysgenesis, these women require
HRT to protect against cardiovascular disease and
osteoporosis. This will also stimulate secondary
sexual development in those who have not yet been
exposed to oestrogens (e.g. Turner’s syndrome).
Those women who carry a Y chromosome should
have both gonads removed, because of the risk of
malignancy, followed by long-term HRT.
Genital tract anomaly
Women with a congenitally absent vagina should
be offered vaginal reconstruction to enable sexual
activity. If the uterus is present, this will allow
drainage of a haematometra. A haematocolpos
should be drained by excision of the persistent vaginal
membrane.

Treatment of secondary amenorrhoea
In young women who have no pathology, the
condition is often self-limiting and might not require
treatment.
Hypothalamic amenorrhoea (or hypothalamic
hypogonadism)
Where weight loss is implicated, a return of BMI
to the normal range (20–25) usually results in
spontaneous menstruation, as does the removal of
stressful situations or treatment of systemic illness.
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)
The mainstay of treatment for PCOS is weight loss. As
the BMI approaches the normal range spontaneous
ovulation and menstruation often occurs. Endometrial
hyperplasia should be treated with progestogens.
Long-term protection of the endometrium can be

provided using cyclical progestogens, the COCP or
the levonorgestrel intra-uterine system. The COCP
Dianette (Schering) is ideal for those with hirsutism
because the anti-androgenic and progestogenic effect
of cyproterone acetate will reduce symptoms of
hyperandrogenism and protect the endometrium from
hyperplasia. A new combined pill (Yasmin; Schering)
contains a progestogen (drospirenone), which has both
a weak anti-androgenic and antimineralocorticoid
activity.
Metformin is now increasingly being used in
clinical practice for the treatment of PCOS as insulin
resistance is an important factor in the disease
process. Some women with PCOS on Metformin
find weight loss targets easier to achieve and some
will start to spontaneously ovulate without the need
for ovulation induction agents.

95

Abnormal uterine bleeding
Hyperprolactinaemia
The treatment of hyperprolactinaemia includes the
following:
• Dopamine agonists for microadenoma.
• Dopamine agonists or surgery for
macroadenoma.
• Cessation of drugs, where possible, in druginduced hyperprolactinaemia.
• Correction of hypothyroidism.
Treatment is advisable for pituitary microadenoma to
reduce the risk of osteoporosis. Dopamine agonists
such as bromocriptine and cabergoline should
be used to reduce the serum prolactin levels. Sideeffects include nausea, dizziness, hypotension,
drowsiness and headaches, and are less common
with cabergoline, which can be given once weekly.
Cessation of therapy usually results in recurrence
of hyperprolactinaemia but is recommended if
pregnancy occurs.
Transphenoidal removal of pituitary macroade­
noma carries a risk of diabetes insipidus, cere­
brospinal fluid leakage, panhypopituitarism and
recurrence of the tumour. Shrinkage of the tumour
and resolution of symptoms might occur with
medical treatment, as for microadenoma.
Where hyperprolactinaemia is drug induced (Fig.
19.3), cessation of the drug results in a fall of serum
prolactin levels to normal levels. However, cessation of
drug treatment is not always advisable, depending on
the condition being treated and where drug treatment
is likely to be long term, oestrogen replacement might
be advisable to prevent osteoporosis. Hypothyroidism
should be corrected with thyroxine replacement.

Asherman’s syndrome
Cervical stenosis can be treated by dilatation of the
cervix. Intra-uterine adhesions should be divided
hysteroscopically. Insertion of an intra-uterine contr­
aceptive device is advisable for at least 3 months to
prevent redevelopment of adhesions. Stimulation of
endometrial re-growth using exogenous oestrogens i.e.
hormone replacement therapy is sometimes necessary.
Hormone-secreting tumours
Ovarian and adrenal hormone secreting tumours
should be surgically removed. As much ovarian tissue
as possible should be preserved especially in younger
women.
Sheehan’s syndrome
Postpartum infarction of the pituitary gland due
to massive obstetric haemorrhage (Sheehan’s
syndrome) requires oestrogen replacement in the
form of the combined contraceptive pill or HRT to
prevent osteoporosis. In addition, replacement of
other pituitary hormones might be necessary.

Menorrhagia
Menorrhagia is defined as menstrual blood loss
(MBL) of more than 80 mL per period. This represents
two standard deviations above the mean MBL, which
is about 40 mL per period. Two-thirds of women
with genuine menorrhagia will have iron-deficiency
anaemia.

Incidence of menorrhagia
The incidence of true menorrhagia is reported to be
9–15% of population samples in Western Europe,
however, as many as one-third of women regard
their menstrual loss as heavy. Early menarche, late
menopause, reduction in family size with concurrent
reduction in periods of lactational amenorrhoea have
all contributed to an almost tenfold increase in the
number of periods that women experience during their
reproductive life. This, combined with the changing role
of women within society whereby many are involved
in work outside the home, has meant that excessive
menstrual bleeding has become one of the most
common causes of concern for health in women.

Diagnosing menorrhagia
Menorrhagia can be diagnosed using the following

• Subjective assessment.
• Pictorial blood loss assessment charts (Fig. 19.4).
• Objective assessment.
As only half of women complaining of heavy periods
will truly have menorrhagia, reliance on subjective
assessment alone will mean that many women are
treated for a condition that they do not suffer from.
A visual method of assessing menstrual blood loss
using pictorial charts has been shown to be more
effective at diagnosing menorrhagia than subjective
assessment alone. They take into account the
degree to which each item of sanitary protection is
soiled with blood as well as the quantity used but,
interestingly, the charts are not frequently used
in practice. Objective measurement of menstrual
blood loss is rarely performed and usually only
during clinical trials. The idea of collecting and
storing soiled sanitary protection for measurement
of menstrual blood loss is distasteful to most and is
the main reason why objective assessment is rarely
performed.

Aetiology of menorrhagia
There are three categories for the aetiology of
menorrhagia (Fig. 19.5):

Systemic conditions
The relationship between hypothyroidism and
menorrhagia has not been confirmed because of
insufficient objective data, although anecdotal
individual cases have been reported.
Up to 90% of women with bleeding disorders
have been shown to have menorrhagia. Coagulation
disorders are found in up to one-third of young women
admitted to hospital with profound menorrhagia.

Local pathology
Fibroids increase menstrual loss in two ways:
• they enlarge the uterine cavity, thereby increasing
the surface area of the endometrium from which
menstruation occurs
• they may produce prostaglandins, which have
been implicated in the aetiology of menorrhagia.
In a similar way, endometrial polyps increase the
surface area of the endometrium and are also
hormonally active.
Measured MBL in the presence of pelvic pathology,
such as endometriosis and PID, is very variable and
often in the normal range. Menorrhagia is therefore
associated with, not necessarily caused by, these
conditions.
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is the
most common cause of menorrhagia and is the
term used when there are no apparent local or
systemic causes for menorrhagia. It is therefore a
diagnosis made by exclusion. Altered endometrial

97

Abnormal uterine bleeding
prostaglandin metabolism would appear to have
an important role in the aetiology of DUB. Further
evidence is given by the fact that prostaglandin
inhibitors are known to decrease menstrual blood
loss in women with DUB.
Premalignant and malignant endometrium
may present with menorrhagia and must always be
excluded in women who complain of excessive MBL.

Iatrogenic causes
The presence of an IUCD has been shown to increase
menstrual blood loss and is the most common
iatrogenic cause of menorrhagia. Menorrhagia and
iron deficiency anaemia are up to five times more
common in IUCD users than with other forms of
contraception.
Roughly one half of women taking oral
anticoagulants will be found to have objective
evidence of menorrhagia.

Of all women complaining
of heavy periods only half
will truly have menorrhagia.
It is therefore important to use appropriate medical
therapy for heavy periods and to counsel women
effectively about surgical procedures. It is important
that women with normal periods do not undergo
unnecessary surgical intervention.

Investigating menorrhagia
Investigation (Fig. 19.6) is aimed at excluding the
systemic and local causes of menorrhagia and include:
• Full blood count and, where clinically indicated,
thyroid function tests and clotting tests.
• Pelvic ultrasound (vaginal ultrasound is
particularly sensitive).
• Endometrial biopsy.
• Hysteroscopy.
A full blood count should be performed in all cases.
Thyroid function and clotting studies should be
performed only where indicated by the clinical history.
A pelvic ultrasound is extremely useful and will
identify uterine enlargement due to fibroids as well as
adnexal masses. Endometrial polyps or submucous
fibroids should be suspected where the endometrial
thickness is increased.

Fig. 19.6 Investigating menorrhagia.

An endometrial biopsy should be performed on
all women aged over 40 years and in women under
40 years if there are risk factors in the history or
suspicious findings on ultrasound scan. This can be
performed either in the outpatient clinic or under
general anaesthesia. It might show endometrium
inappropriate to the menstrual cycle secondary to
anovulation, endometrial hyperplasia or carcinoma.
A cervical smear should also be performed where this
is due, or sooner if there is a history of intermenstrual
or postcoital bleeding.
Current methods of endometrial sampling, for
example pipelle suction tubing, appear to be at least as
accurate as D&C, have high levels of patient acceptability,
lower complication rates and do not require inpatient
admission or general anaesthesia. However, they have
been shown to miss benign and malignant endometrial
pathology and must therefore be considered inadequate
for the further investigation of menorrhagia that has
persisted despite medical therapy. In this instance,
a hysteroscopy plus sampling should be performed
either as an outpatient or under general anaesthesia
depending on facilities and patient preference.
The most effective way of excluding intrauterine
pathology is by diagnostic hysteroscopy. This can be
performed in the outpatient setting without analgesia
and will identify endometrial polyps, submucous
fibroids, endometritis and most endometrial carci­
nomas. Where appropriate, laparoscopy will be indi­
cated to exclude pelvic pathology.

Menorrhagia
There would appear to be enough evidence to suggest
that blind D&C, used as a diagnostic or therapeutic tool
in the management of menorrhagia, is one of the most
inappropriately used surgical procedures of our time.

Complications of menorrhagia
Apart from the effect on the quality of life and
interference with both social life and work, which
can be profound, the most common complication of
menorrhagia is iron-deficiency anaemia.

Treatment of menorrhagia
The treatment of menorrhagia should be tailored
to the patient’s needs and also to the findings of
the relevant investigations. Practically, this usually
includes the following:
• Correction of iron-deficiency anaemia.
• Treatment of systemic disorders or focal
pathology.
• Attempted control of menorrhagia by medical
treatment and, if this fails.
• Surgical treatment of menorrhagia.

Medical treatment of menorrhagia
It is generally believed, by doctors and patients alike,
that most drugs used to treat menorrhagia are not
only ineffective but produce intolerable side-effects.
This has led to their inappropriate use and a greater
reliance on surgical techniques in the management of
menorrhagia. For instance, progestogens used to be the
most commonly prescribed drug for menorrhagia and
yet are the least effective. The reduction of mean MBL
for different medical therapies is shown in Fig. 19.7.

19

Prostaglandin inhibitors
A wide range of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, indomethacin,
flufenamic and mefenamic acid, are potent
inhibitors of the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme system,
which is a controlling step in the production of
cyclic endoperoxides from arachidonic acid. Threequarters of women treated with NSAIDs will find an
improvement in MBL, with a mean reduction of 50%.
Dysmenorrhoea and menstrual headaches are also
improved. As medication is taken with menstruation,
side-effects are usually better tolerated than with
those drugs that are taken throughout the menstrual
cycle.
Antifibrinolytics and haemostatics
Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that inhibits the
activation of plasminogen to plasmin. The rationale
for its use is to reduce the excessive fibrinolytic
activity found in the endometrium of menorrhagic
women. Rare, anecdotal but potentially fatal
intracranial thrombosis might account for its lack of
popularity in the UK in the past. However it is now
more widely used for the treatment of heavy periods
as its’ efficacy has become more apparent. In women
with menorrhagia, who have no history or family
history of thrombosis, it should be regarded as the
first line of medical treatment.
Ethamsylate, a haemostatic agent with antihyalur­
onidase activity and possibly a prostaglandin inhibitor,
is thought to maintain capillary integrity. The
reduction in mean MBL appears to be proportional
to the severity of menorrhagia. Ethamsylate is not
a popular medical treatment of menorrhagia in
the UK.

Abnormal uterine bleeding
Hormonal therapy
Progestogens Oral progestogens used to be the
most commonly used drugs for the treatment of
menorrhagia and are probably the least effective.
Early studies showed an improvement in subjective
MBL but objective studies have shown no statistical
improvement. They are most effectively used in
anovulatory menorrhagia to gain cycle control.
Intrauterine systems Intrauterine contraceptive systems
impregnated with either progesterone or levonorgestrel
have been shown to dramatically reduce MBL as well
as acting as very reliable contraception. The Mirena
intrauterine system releases 20 μg of levonorgestrel
every 24 h into the endometrium from a silicone barrel.
As a result of minimal systemic absorption, side-effects
are usually limited to irregular spotting in the initial
year of usage and, as a safe long-term medical treatment
for menorrhagia, this method seems extremely
encouraging. Amenorrhoea is induced in up to 50%
of long-term users because of endometrial atrophy.
Contraceptively, it is as effective as sterilization and yet
fertility returns almost immediately on removal of the
system. Since it was granted its license in the UK for the
treatment of menorrhagia for up to 5 years per system
the use of the Mirena IUS for the treatment of heavy
periods has increased dramatically.

The most effective longterm medical therapy for
menorrhagia is currently the
levonorgestrel intrauterine system (Mirena IUS). Its
contraceptive efficacy has been shown to be as good
as sterilization.

The combined oral contraceptive pill When taken in
a cyclical fashion, the COCP inhibits ovulation and
produces regular shedding of a thin endometrium.
This makes it an effective and acceptable longerterm medical treatment for some women with
menorrhagia. Thrombogenic side-effects should be
discussed with older women and smokers who are
considering using COCP for therapeutic reasons.
Danazol Danazol is a testosterone derivative
produ­cing a number of effects on the hypothalamic–
pituitary–ovarian axis. The optimum dosage in the

100

treatment of menorrhagia appears to be 200 mg
daily, significantly reducing mean MBL as well as
reducing dysmenorrhoea. The androgenic properties
of danazol produce unacceptable side-effects in some
women. Nowadays, it is not commonly used.
Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonists GnRH
agonists suppress pituitary–ovarian function and
effectively produce a temporary, reversible menopausal
state. Because of the subsequent bone density loss
their long-term use as a primary medical treatment
for menorrhagia is limited unless add-back hormone
therapy is given. This relegates their clinical use to that
of preoperative adjunct allowing correction of irondeficiency anaemia, reduction in the size of fibroids
and reduction in surgical blood loss (see Chapter 21).
The management of menorrhagia using medical
therapies should be tailored to the patient’s
individual needs. Guidelines are shown in Fig. 19.8.

Surgical treatment of menorrhagia
Which surgical procedure is used to treat menorrhagia
depends on the diagnosis. Intrauterine pathology
such as endometrial polyps and submucous fibroids
should be removed hysteroscopically. Following
hysteroscopic myomectomy, MBL has been shown
to reduce by 75%. Open myomectomy may be
required in the presence of large fibroids and where
the uterus is to be conserved. Endometrial ablation
and hysterectomy are the most common operations
performed for menorrhagia and these will be
discussed in detail.

Endometrial ablative methods are
becoming increasingly popular due to
rapid recovery and the possibility of
outpatient treatment.

Endometrial ablation
Endometrial ablation techniques aim to reduce
menstrual blood loss by producing an ‘iatrogenic’
Asherman’s syndrome. Endometrium is destroyed
using laser, resection, thermal or microwave ablation
techniques and the ensuing intrauterine adhesions
reduce endometrial regrowth from deep within crypts
or glands. Although not guaranteeing amenorrhoea
as hysterectomy does, advantages include speed of

surgery, quicker recovery, rapid return to work and

Following endometrial ablation, MBL has been
shown to be reduced by up to 90%.
Complications of endometrial ablation
Deaths have occurred after endometrial ablation;
these have been due to air embolism during laser
ablation, toxic shock following endometrial resection,
sepsis from bowel perforation and from haemorrhage
following major pelvic vessel transection. The most
common operative complications are:
•
•
•
•

Uterine perforation.
Fluid overload.
Haemorrhage.
Infection.

Uterine perforation Uterine perforation is poten­
tially one of the most serious complications of
endometrial ablation as it is associated with fluid
overload as well as trauma to the gastrointestinal and
genitourinary tracts and major blood vessels resulting
in peritonitis or haemorrhage. Perforation commonly
occurs where the uterine wall is thinnest, such as the
cornual regions and the cervical canal.
Fluid overload The use of non-electrolytic solutions,
such as 1.5% glycine, for electrosurgery and the
relatively high pressures needed to distend the noncompliant uterine walls predispose to the absorption
of large quantities of fluid, which can result in
hyponatraemia due to dilutional effects of the irrigating
fluid. Congestive cardiac failure, hypertension,
hyponatraemia, neurological symptoms, haemolysis,
coma and even death can develop.

Haemorrhage Haemorrhage is likely to occur if the
myometrium is resected too deeply and in the event
of perforation of the uterus.
Infection The true incidence of pelvic infection
following endometrial ablation is difficult to
quantify. Infection can be overwhelming and might
cause long-term pelvic pain.

Hysterectomy
Hysterectomy was one of the most commonly
performed operations in the UK. In 1993–4, 73 517
hysterectomies were performed in NHS hospitals and
approximately two-thirds of these were performed
for menorrhagia. The overall lifetime risk of having
a hysterectomy in the UK was 20%. By 2002, the
number of hysterectomies had fallen to 44 000
due to better diagnostic abilities, better medical
treatment and the development of focal and ablative
hysteroscopic techniques.
Complications of hysterectomy
The mortality rate following hysterectomy for benign
disease is very low – approximately 6 per 10 000 –
and is usually a consequence of cardiovascular
disease and sepsis.
Morbidity associated with hysterectomy is
common and occurs in almost half the women
undergoing abdominal hysterectomy and onequarter of those undergoing vaginal hysterectomy.
Although conditions such as thromboembolic
disease should not be forgotten, the following
are some of the more likely complications to be
encountered:

101

Abnormal uterine bleeding
• Febrile morbidity.
• Haemorrhage requiring transfusion.
• Unintended major surgery because of:
• Urinary tract damage.
• Bowel damage.
• Long-term complications.
Febrile morbidity Febrile morbidity accounts for
most of the overall morbidity following hysterectomy,
with one in three women experiencing this following
the abdominal approach. In one-quarter of cases
the source of infection is not identifiable; the
most common identifiable infection is urinary
tract infection, followed by wound or vaginal cuff
infection. The use of prophylactic antibiotics is
associated with a lower rate of infection of the urinary
tract, abdominal wound and vaginal cuff.
Urinary tract damage Damage to the ureter occurs
in approximately 1 in every 200 hysterectomies. The
ureter is likely to be damaged at the infundibulopelvic
ligament, beneath the uterine artery and adjacent to the
cervix. Predisposing factors to ureteric damage include
congenital anomaly of the renal tracts and distortion
of normal anatomy from pelvic inflammatory disease,
endometriosis and malignancy.
Trauma to the bladder occurs in approximately 1
in 100 hysterectomies and is much higher following
vaginal hysterectomy. Predisposing factors include
previous surgery and obesity.
Bowel damage The incidence of bowel trauma is
approximately 1 in 200 hysterectomies. Risk factors
predisposing to bowel damage are obesity, previous
laparotomy, adhesions, intrinsic bowel problems
(e.g. chronic inflammatory bowel disease) and
irradiation.
Bowel dysfunction following hysterectomy is
well documented, with constipation occurring in
up to half the patients during the first 2 weeks of
the abdominal approach. One in five patients will
continue to complain of constipation in the first
three postoperative months.
Long-term complications of hysterectomy During
the removal of the uterus, the pelvic floor and its
nerve supply are disrupted. This can predispose to
pelvic floor laxity with subsequent prolapse, as well
as bladder and bowel dysfunction. Even when the
ovaries are conserved, disruption of their blood supply
is thought to interfere with their function, and might
even predispose to premature ovarian failure, a risk
factor for cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

102

Postmenopausal Bleeding
Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) is vaginal bleeding
occurring more than 12 months after the menopause.
In clinical practice, the menopause is a retrospective
diagnosis and it is therefore important to keep in
mind, and exclude, causes of secondary amenorrhoea
such as pregnancy. PMB is a common disorder and
requires prompt investigation to exclude malignancy.

A woman with PMB should always
be investigated promptly to exclude
malignancy.

Causes of postmenopausal
bleeding
There are many causes of PMB and the simplest way
of remembering them all is by anatomy (Fig. 19.9).
However, although atrophic changes to the genital
tract are the most common cause of PMB, malignancy
of the endometrium, cervix and ovary must always be
remembered and excluded.

Postmenopausal bleeding
Disease of the ovary in postmenopausal women is
uncommon but can present with PMB. An oestrogensecreting tumour causes PMB by stimulating the
endometrium in the absence of progesterone. This
is likely to cause hyperplasia and even carcinoma of
the endometrium. Ovarian carcinoma usually causes
PMB by direct invasion through the uterine wall.
Submucous fibroids can cause PMB, although
these are likely to have been present from before the
menopause. The endometrium should be inactive in
the postmenopausal years and atrophic endometritis
is a common consequence. Endometrial polyps might
be benign, contain areas of atypical hyperplasia or be
malignant. Endometrial hyperplasia can arise de novo,
or be secondary to oestrogen stimulation. Exogenous
unopposed oestrogens and endogenous oestrogens
arising from peripheral conversion of precursors in
adipose tissue, or from oestrogen-secreting ovarian
tumours, can result in endometrial hyperplasia
and adenocarcinoma. Adenocarcinoma of the
endometrium is an important cause of PMB and must
always be considered in the differential diagnosis.
Atrophic changes to the genital tract due to
oestrogen deficiency can cause bleeding and, in fact,
are the most common cause of PMB. Atrophic changes
can occur to the endometrium, cervix and vagina.
Urethral caruncle (prolapse of the urethral mucosa) is
also associated with oestrogen deficiency.
Cervical carcinoma and squamous carcinoma
of the vulva can present with PMB and although
the non-neoplastic epithelial disorders of the vulva
(vulval dystrophies) do not themselves usually cause
PMB, scratching because of pruritus vulvae may.

19

Investigating PMB
Clinical examination should reveal lesions of
the vulva, vagina and cervix as well as identifying
pelvic masses. The most common cause of PMB
is atrophic change of the lower genital tract
and, although this might be evident on clinical
examination, it must not be assumed to be the
cause of the PMB until other more serious causes
have been excluded.
Investigation depends on the clinical findings.
Vulval and vaginal biopsies should be performed
when abnormal lesions are present. Cervical
pathology can be excluded by cytology or colposcopic
examination (Fig. 19.10).
Intrauterine pathology is best excluded by
hysteroscopic examination of the uterine cavity with
endometrial biopsy, although ultrasound estimation
of the endometrial thickness combined with
endometrial sampling can be used. The endometrial
thickness in a postmenopausal woman should be less
than 5 mm. Although a negative endometrial sample
is reassuring, the commonest method of taking
the sample in the outpatient setting is by using the
‘pipelle’ endometrial sampler, which samples only
4% of the uterine cavity. Ultrasound with biopsy can
therefore miss early focal pathology. Although D&C
can be performed at the same time as hysteroscopy as
a method of endometrial biopsy, there is no place for
D&C alone in the management of PMB. The ovaries
can be assessed using ultrasound and if an oestrogensecreting tumour is suspected, circulating oestradiol
levels should be measured.

Treating PMB
Treatment obviously depends on the pathology. The
most commonly encountered cause of PMB is atrophic
change and therefore oestrogen replacement is
indicated, not only to prevent a recurrence of PMB but
also to treat other symptoms associated with oestrogen
deficiency. Most women in this situation prefer to use
topical oestrogen. The newer 17β oestradiol-releasing
creams, rings and vaginal tablets avoid the risk of
endometrial hyperplasia because of minimal systemic
absorption. If systemic HRT is requested then oestrogen
therapy must be combined with a progestogen or
progesterone in women who have a uterus.
The treatment of urethral caruncle is by surgical
excision of the prolapsed urethral mucosa and is a

104

painful and unpleasant procedure. It should therefore
be reserved for those cases in which recurrent PMB
or pain occur. Small caruncles might recede with
oestrogen cream.
The treatment of vulval, cervical and ovarian
malignancy is discussed in detail in Chapter 24.

Objectives
• This chapter will help you to understand the commoner causes of precocious and
delayed puberty
• You will understand the endocrine background to PCOS and the treatment options
available and how they work
• Rarer endocrine disorders will be discussed that may present to the gynaecologist.

Precocious and Delayed
Puberty
The causes and management of primary and
secondary amenorrhoea are discussed in detail in
Chapter 19, while precocious and delayed puberty
will be dealt with here.

Precocious puberty
Precocious puberty is said to have occurred when
sexual maturation takes place before the age of 9 years.

Management
• Endocrinological:
the mainstay of endocrine

support is suppression of oestrogen and
androgen production by GnRH analogues to
reverse the physical changes. This can either
be given as a daily sniff or monthly depot
preparation.
• Psychological
support: this is vital, and

counselling important, because the affected
girl will see herself as being different from her
friends.
• Surgical:
if a tumour is discovered then this must

be dealt with, usually surgically.

Aetiology
The conditions that may cause precocious puberty
and their approximate incidence are summarized in
Fig. 20.1 and an algorithm for identifying the most
common causes is shown in Fig. 20.2. Although it
is important to exclude androgen-secreting tumours
in the ovary and adrenal glands, most cases are
constitutional.

Investigations

history and physical examination.

Full
endocrine profile (oestradiol, FSH,

LH, testosterone, sex hormone binding
globulin (SHBG), androstenedione,
dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate (DHEAS),

• Bone
age studies.

• Imaging:
ultrasound scanning of the gonads and

adrenals should be performed as first line but CT
or MRI are the gold-standard investigations for
excluding tumours.

Delayed puberty
Puberty is delayed when there are no signs of pubertal
development by 14 years of age, when it is expected
that more than 95% of normal females will have
shown some signs of pubertal development.

Aetiology
Some of the causes of delayed puberty and their
approximate incidence are shown in Fig. 20.1 and
an algorithm for identifying the commoner causes
shown in Figs. 20.2 and 20.3.

Hirsutism and Virilism
Hirsutism – excess facial and body hair growth – can
be either genetic (idiopathic) or due to increased
androgen levels or sometimes both. Virilism occurs
secondary to high circulating levels of androgens
and is diagnosed when clitoral hypertrophy, breast
atrophy, deepening of the voice and male-pattern
balding occur either alone or together. Approximately
10% of healthy normal women can be said to have
some degree of hirsutism without signs of virilism,
however, virilism rarely occurs in the absence of
hirsutism (except in the newborn). The causes of
hirsutism and virilism are shown in Fig. 20.4.

• The mainstay of treatment
for PCOS is weight loss.
• Although the most common
cause of hirsutism in women is PCOS, it is vital to
exclude an androgen-secreting tumour.
• The psychological effects of precocious and
delayed puberty can be profound and should not
be neglected.
• Virilism is never idiopathic whereas hirsutism can be.
• Rapid-onset hirsutism and virilism is suggestive of
an androgen-producing tumour.

20

History
The timing of onset and the speed of progression of
symptoms need to be elicited from the history. For
instance, women with polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) typically have mild symptoms that have
been present since menarche, whereas androgensecreting tumours of the ovary characteristically
produce high levels of androgens, which cause
severe symptomatology over a short period of time.
A detailed menstrual history is important because
oligomenorrhoea (infrequent periods) is associated
with PCOS and amenorrhoea is often associated with
virilism. A family history of hirsutism is often present
with idiopathic hirsutism and the menstrual history
is usually normal.
PCOS typically presents with oligomenorrhoea
and hirsutism from the time of menarche. There
might be a history of subfertility secondary to chronic
anovulation or a history of glucose intolerance.
Although acne and seborrhoea occur relatively
commonly, the androgen levels are not usually high
enough to produce symptoms of virilism.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) usually
presents in infancy with ambiguous genitalia but
milder cases might not present until puberty and
might have a history similar to women with severe
PCOS.
Cushing’s syndrome (excess cortisol) presents
commonly with a gradual change in appearance
associated with a host of other symptoms including
central obesity, muscle wasting and weakness,
hypertension and purple striae.

A careful drug history is imperative as not only do

Examination

of hirsuties can be made objectively with

detailed scoring systems but simple descriptive
assessments are more practical. Signs of virilism
should be looked for.
• Women
with PCOS are often obese, although

not always so. Acanthosis nigricans (pigmented
raised patches found on the neck and skin
flexures) is sometimes present in women with
PCOS associated with insulin resistance.
• Severe
CAH will have been diagnosed during

childhood due to ambiguous external genitalia or
salt-losing conditions. Women with milder,

late-onset forms of CAH have little to
distinguish them from those with PCOS, that
is, obese, hirsutism/virilism with menstrual

• Women
with Cushing’s syndrome will have the

typical appearance of central obesity, peripheral
muscle wasting, hypertension and striae.
• Androgen-producing
tumours cause little in the

way of systemic upset apart from marked signs
of virilism. They are usually too small to cause
palpably enlarged ovaries.
• Women
with idiopathic hirsutism usually have

no abnormal findings on examination.

Aetiology
Hirsutism and virilism occur due to excess circulating
endogenous or exogenous androgens. Endogenous
production by the ovary is the most common source.

Hirsutism and virilism

20

Ovarian androgens

Exogenous androgens

PCOS is the most common cause of hirsutism
(90%) and occurs in about 20% of women.
Raised levels of circulating LH and sex steroids are
characteristic of this syndrome and occur through
different pathways (Fig. 20.5). Pituitary production
of LH is raised in PCOS causing increased ovarian
androgen production. This leads to a reduced
production of SHBG by the liver and, as SHBG binds
to circulating androgens, free testosterone levels
increase. Androgens are converted to oestrogens in
adipose tissue, raising oestradiol levels, which further
stimulate pituitary production of LH. Obesity not
only increases insulin levels, which stimulates further
ovarian androgen production, but also reduces SHBG
levels and increases the peripheral conversion of
androgens to oestrogens.
Androgen-secreting tumours of the ovary are
rare and include arrhenoblastomas and hilar cell
tumours. Pregnancy luteomas are a rare source of
excess ovarian androgen secretion. They develop due
to an exaggerated response by the ovarian stroma to
hCG.

Androgens and anabolic steroids will cause hirsutism
and virilism, depending on the amount and length
of time taken. Certain drugs prescribed for medical
disorders have androgenic properties and, if taken
in high enough doses and for long periods of time,
can cause hirsutism (norethisterone, phenytoin) and
virilism (danazol).

Adrenal androgens
CAH is the term used to describe a group of rare
disorders caused by defects in hydroxylation of
cortisol precursors, most commonly 21-hydroxylase
deficiency. The net effect is increased circulating
levels of cortisol precursors and androgens. Excessive
stimulation of the adrenal cortex produces raised
cortisol levels and is often associated with excess
androgen production (Cushing’s syndrome).
Adenomas and adenocarcinoma of the adrenal gland
produce high levels of androgens but are rare.

LH production
by pituitary

Oestradiol

Investigation
Investigation is determined somewhat by the degree
of symptoms (Fig. 20.6). Having excluded a history
of exogenous androgens, if hirsutism is the only
presenting complaint then PCOS is the likely cause
accounting for 90% of cases. Diagnosis is made from
the history, biochemical tests and ultrasound imaging
of the ovaries. A rapid onset of symptoms, especially
where virilism is present, would suggest high
circulating levels of androgens secondary to more
serious pathology. Testosterone levels more than
twice the upper limit of normal suggest an ovarian
or adrenal androgen-secreting tumour, which could
be identified by imaging test such as ultrasound or
CT scanning. Small tumours might be missed so a
high level of suspicion is needed. Investigations for
CAH and Cushing’s syndrome should be performed
if symptoms and clinical signs suggest these diseases.
Idiopathic hirsutism is a diagnosis made by excluding
other pathology.

Complications
The main complication of hirsutism is psychosocial
and should therefore be dealt with sympathetically.

Some signs of virilism, such as deepening of the

Complications associated with PCOS include
obesity, insulin resistance and glucose intolerance.
Chronic anovulation affects fertility and can cause
endometrial hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma as a
result of the unopposed effect of oestrogens.

Treatment aims
Idiopathic hirsutism can be treated cosmetically
using techniques such as bleaching or electrolysis.
The effects of obesity in women with PCOS have
been described above and encouraging weight
loss is important in PCOS. Medical treatment of
hirsutism in women with PCOS is most effective
using a combination of ethinyloestradiol with
an anti-androgen such as cyproterone acetate
(Dianette™). Although improvement of hirsutism
can take many months, the progestogenic effect of
cyproterone acetate will protect the endometrium
from the effects of unopposed oestrogen. Recent
data suggest that PCOS might be driven by insulin
resistance – as such, good results have been
obtained by the use of the oral hypoglycaemic agent
metformin.

Androgen-secreting ovarian and adrenal tumours
should be surgically removed with preservation of the
ovary in younger women.
Glucocorticoid and often mineralocorticoid
replacement is the mainstay of treatment in CAH.
Hirsutism and virilism should improve with therapy
but it is sometimes necessary to perform surgical
reconstructive procedures to the external genitalia.
Treating the cause of excess cortisol production
in Cushing’s syndrome should result in normal
circulating levels of adrenal androgens.
Women with gynaecological conditions requiring
treatment with drugs that have androgenic properties
should be forewarned of the potential virilizing sideeffects. Immediate cessation should be advised.
Phenytoin should not be stopped suddenly because
this could precipitate status epilepticus.

Fibroids
Objectives
• This chapter will explain the prevalence and clinical impact of fibroids

• You
will understand the sites that fibroids can occur and the impact these have
on symptoms

• Medical,
surgical and the newest treatments of fibroids will be discussed.

Uterine fibroids are benign tumours of the myometrium.
They are the most common benign tumours found in
women, occurring in more than 50% of women over
the age of 40 years. Histologically they are composed
of whorling bundles of smooth muscle cells that
resemble the architecture of normal myometrium.
Although their aetiology is unknown, fibroids
are associated with exposure to oestrogens. Factors
influencing the incidence of fibroids are shown in
Fig. 21.1. The hyperoestrogenic state of pregnancy
might stimulate the growth of fibroids already
present. Fibroids can be categorized by their position
within the myometrium (Fig. 21.2).

Submucous fibroids can also cause intermenstrual
bleeding, postcoital bleeding, continuous vaginal
bleeding or dysmenorrhoea. Increased menstrual
blood loss due to fibroids is associated with:
• Increased endometrial surface area.
• Prostaglandin
production.

• Increased
endometrial blood supply.


Abdominopelvic mass
Large fibroids growing into the abdominal cavity may
cause abdominal swelling or distension.

Pain
Symptoms of Uterine Fibroids

Abdominopelvic pain can be caused by:

Symptoms associated with uterine fibroids are shown
in Fig. 21.3.

• Degeneration of uterine fibroids.
• The
presence of associated pelvic varicosities.

• Stretching
of the uterine ligaments.


No symptoms

Subfertility

Approximately 50% of women with fibroids are
asymptomatic, diagnosis being made during incidental
clinical or ultrasound assessment of the pelvis and
during pregnancy.

Fibroids compressing the cornual region of the
fallopian tubes can cause infertility. Submucous
fibroids, especially those that are hormonally
active, can affect implantation and might result
in miscarriage. There is now evidence that even

Up to 50% of women with fibroids will be
completely asymptomatic.

Menstrual abnormalities
Menstrual abnormalities occur in about one-third
of women with fibroids, usually heavy periods.

Decreased incidence with:

African–Caribbean women
Increasing age
Nulligravidity

intramural fibroids that are not distorting the
endometrial cavity can still lead to reduced embryo
implantation and pregnancy rates following IVF,
possibly because of interference with the endometrial
blood supply.

Pressure symptoms
Urinary frequency, nocturia and urgency may be
caused by pressure on the bladder from an enlarged
uterus and incarceration of a pelvic fibroid may result
in urinary retention. Pressure on the rectum might
also be noticed.

Complications
Red degeneration occurring in pregnancy may
present with acute pain and the subsequent massive

112

release of prostaglandins may cause miscarriage
or premature labour. Pedunculated fibroids may
undergo torsion and present with an acute abdomen.
Urinary retention might occur with impaction of a
pelvic fibroid. Hyaline, cystic and calcific degenerative
changes may also occur. Sarcomatous (malignant)
change, usually within very large or rapidly growing
fibroids, is a rare (approximately 1:1000) but
potentially fatal complication.
In pregnancy, fibroids situated low in the
uterus may result in malpresentation of the fetus
and obstruct delivery. Fibroids may also restrict
postpartum involution of the uterus and predispose
to postpartum haemorrhage.

Clinical Evaluation and
Investigations
The presence of fibroids can be elicited by
abdominopelvic examination; classically the uterus
feels firm and irregular. If a fibroid is moved on
bimanual examination the uterus moves with it,
although this can also occur with an ovarian mass
adherent to the uterus. Pelvic ultrasound might
show characteristic diffuse changes associated with
the presence of fibroids. Individual larger fibroids
can be seen and measured by ultrasound but the
best method of excluding submucous fibroids
in the presence of menstrual abnormalities is by
hysteroscopy. MRI has become the gold standard
imaging method for differentiating fibroids from
other pelvic masses. However, laparotomy might be
required to be 100% certain in some cases.

Diagnosis is usually confirmed by
ultrasound scan, which will define size and
location.

Indications for Treatment
Small, asymptomatic fibroids do not require
intervention. Indications for treatment include:
• Symptomatic fibroids.
• Rapidly
enlarging fibroids.

• Fibroids

Advances in fibroid treatment

21

Surgical Treatment
Fibroids need treatment only
if they are causing symptoms,
they are growing rapidly or if
subfertility is thought to be due to their presence.

Medical therapy
Medical therapy is only useful as an adjunct to
surgery and as an aid to correction of anaemia prior
to surgery. Fibroids regrow to their original size
within 3 months of ceasing medical therapy without
surgical intervention.

Gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone analogues
Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) anal­
ogues produce a hypogonadotrophic hypo­gonadal
state; that is, they produce a temporary, reversible,
chemical menopause that results in a reduction in
fibroid volume by up to 50% with a maximum benefit
within 3 months of starting therapy.
GnRH analogues have several different uses prior
to surgery:
• They
reduce surgical blood loss and the need for

blood transfusions.
• They
increase the likelihood of performing

surgery through a transverse suprapubic incision
rather than a midline incision.
• They
reduce the risk of hysterectomy when

myomectomy is planned.
The long-term use of GnRH analogues has been
limited because of their side-effects, which include
menopausal symptoms and bone density reduction
(osteoporosis). However, recent data have indicated
that low-dose hormone replacement therapy
(HRT), used concomitantly as ‘add back’, can avoid
menopausal side-effects and prevent loss of bone
density while maintaining the benefits of the GnRH
analogues. GnRH analogues are currently licensed
for 6 months use. More data are required before
GnRH analogues with add back are licensed for
longer-term use.

Definitive surgery includes either:
• myomectomy or
• hysterectomy.

Myomectomy is the removal of fibroids with
preservation of the uterus and can be performed
either at laparotomy (open myomectomy),
hysteroscopically or laparoscopically. Complications
include haemorrhage, which might require blood
transfusion, and – rarely – hysterectomy. Adhesion
formation may impair future fertility and is most
common after open myomectomy, especially for
posterior wall fibroids. Fibroid regrowth is likely to
occur in 40% of patients with a reoperation rate of
up to one-fifth of cases. Hysterectomy is the surgical
procedure of choice in women who have completed
their families although not all women wish to have
their uterus removed.

Surgical treatment by
hysterectomy often causes less
morbidity than myomectomy,
the latter is performed in women who wish to
preserve their fertility.

Advances in Fibroid
Treatment
Techniques for the treatment of fibroids are currently
being developed to reduce the need for laparotomy,
postoperative adhesion formation and the avoidance
of large uterine scars. These include:
• Interstitial
laser photocoagulation: laser probes

are inserted into the fibroid laparoscopically to
produce tissue degeneration and subsequent
fibroid shrinkage.
• Laparoscopic
diathermy.

• Radiological
embolization of fibroids via

uterine artery catheterization using tiny silicone
microbeads.
• Directed
high-energy ultrasound.

Endometriosis

22

Objectives
• You will understand the theories for the genesis of endometriosis
• The commonest sites of endometriosis will be discussed and common treatments
• The relationships between endometriosis and subfertility will be covered.

Endometriosis is the presence of functional endo­
metrium outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis
occurring in the myometrium is known as adenomyosis.
The true incidence of endometriosis is difficult to
ascertain as not all women with endometriosis
complain of gynaecological symptoms. Endometriosis
occurs in about 10% of the female population in their
reproductive years but has been defined in up to 25%
of women undergoing gynaecological laparoscopy.

Endometriosis is the most common
gynaecological condition after fibroids.

surgery on the uterus, for example, following open
myomectomy or caesarean section. Imperforate
hymen and other outflow obstructions that exacerbate
retrograde menstruation are also associated with
severe endometriosis.
However, this theory does not account for the
existence of endometriosis at the distant sites in
the body (e.g. lungs). There is growing laparoscopic
evidence to suggest that most women experience
retrograde menstruation, in which case the incidence
of endometriosis would be expected to be higher.
This would suggest that this theory, as it stands, is too
simplistic.

Lymphatic and venous embolization
Aetiology
The aetiology of endometriosis is unknown but
several theories have been suggested (Fig. 22.1).

Retrograde menstruation/
implantation theory
During menstruation, endometrial tissue spills
into the pelvic cavity through the fallopian tubes;
retrograde menstruation. This ectopic endometrium
then implants and becomes functional, responding
to the hormones of the ovarian cycle. This theory is
supported by the association between endometriosis
and increased menstruation occurring with a short
menstrual cycle and prolonged periods, and by the
fact that the most common sites for endometriosis
are the ovaries and the uterosacral ligaments – areas
in which retrograde menses spill. The implantation
theory would also account for the rare cases of
endometriosis found in the surgical incision following

This theory hypothesizes that endometrial tissue
is transported through the body by the lymphatic
or venous channels and would explain the rare
cases of distant sites for endometriosis. However,
distant endometriotic deposits would be expected
to be more common if the lymphatic and venous
embolization theories were the only mechanism for
the development of endometriosis.

Coelomic metaplasia
This theory relies on the principle that tissues of
certain embryonal origin maintain their ability to

undergo metaplasia and differentiate into other
tissue types. This is certainly true of peritoneum of
coelomic origin, which can undergo metaplasia and
differentiate into functional endometrium. Although
this is an attractive theory, it does not explain the
distribution of endometriosis within the peritoneal
cavity itself (most common in the lower part of the
peritoneal cavity) or the presence of endometriosis in
sites of the body that are not of coelomic origin.

Genetic and immunological
factors
The role of a genetic influence is supported by the
strong family history seen in endometriosis sufferers.
What exactly that role is has not yet been ascertained.
It is possible that those women with a genetic
predisposition to endometriosis have an abnormal
response to the presence of ectopic endometrium,
which results in the development of endometriosis.
There is some evidence that an altered or defective
cell-mediated response is implicated.

Composite theories

Sites of Endometriosis
The most common sites for the development of
endometriosis are the ovaries and the uterosacral
ligaments. These and other pelvic sites are shown in
Fig. 22.2. Although endometriosis has been reported
in nearly every organ except the spleen, extrapelvic
endometriosis is rare. Assessment of the severity of
pelvic endometriosis can be made using the American
Fertility Society Classification (Fig. 22.3), which takes
into account the site and size of endometriotic lesions,
and the presence and consequences of adhesions.

Endometriosis has been
diagnosed in every organ in
the body except the spleen.
Symptoms are nearly always cyclical except if nerves
or the intracranial cavity are affected.

Symptoms

None of the above theories will alone account
for all cases of endometriosis, however, together
all the theories could play a role in some way.
Whereas an abnormal response to the presence of
ectopic endometrium might result in functioning
endometrium responding to the ovarian cycle, this
in turn could trigger coelomic metaplasia and further
development or advancement of the disease process
in response to the local release of endometrial
hormones and/or the inflammatory response.

The key to the clinical diagnosis of endometriosis
is the presence of cyclical pain associated with
menstruation. Cyclical pain occurs because the
deposits of endometriosis, whatever their location
in the body, respond to the ovarian cycle and
bleeding from these deposits causes local irritation
and inflammatory responses (Fig. 22.4). The site
of ectopic endometrium dictates the location of
the pain. If the endometriosis is severe, pain can

being diagnosed as having endometriosis. Dense
adhesions and the resultant tubal and ovarian damage
and distortion caused by severe endometriosis will
obviously contribute to the lack of conception. The
association with mild endometriosis, in which no
mechanical damage has occurred, is less easy to
understand. Release of substances from the ectopic
endometrium, such as prostaglandins, which can
affect ovulation or tubal motility has been implicated.
There is evidence that treatment of even mild disease
can lead to an improvement of fertility prospects.

might be seen but these areas of haemosiderin
pigmentation
might
represent
‘burnt-out’
endometriosis. Non-pigmented lesions can appear
as opaque white areas of peritoneum, red lesions
or glandular lesions. If there is doubt about the
macroscopic appearance then a peritoneal biopsy
should be taken. Ovarian endometrioma can be seen
by ultrasound but differentiation from other ovarian
pathology may be difficult without histological
confirmation.

Differential Diagnosis
Endometriosis is strongly associated with
infertility.

Clinical Evaluation
Endometriosis should be considered in any woman
who presents with any of the symptoms shown in
Fig. 22.4. The cardinal symptom of endometriosis
is cyclical pain although the classic ‘quartet’ of
symptoms of endometriosis is:
•
•
•
•

Secondary
dysmenorrhoea.

Deep
dyspareunia.

Pelvic
pain.

Infertility.


The dysmenorrhoea associated with endometriosis
typically starts prior to the beginning of the period
and is exacerbated by menstrual flow.
Pelvic examination may reveal a tender, retroverted,
retroflexed, fixed uterus with thickening of the
cardinal or uterosacral ligaments. Endometriotic
nodules might be palable in the posterior vaginal
fornix and ovarian endometriomata might be evident
on bimanual palpation. The pelvic anatomy might be
normal with mild disease and a useful sign is to elicit
pain on moving the cervix anteriorly. This stretches the
uterosacral ligaments, which is painful in the presence
of endometriosis. In the presence of adenomyosis, the
uterus is typically smoothly enlarged (globular) and
tender.
Diagnosis and severity of disease can only
effectively be assessed through the laparoscope.

Complications
Complications of endometriosis are often due to
the resultant fibrosis and scarring and can affect
not only the reproductive organs but might cause
colonic and ureteric obstruction. Rupture of an
endometrioma and the subsequent release of the
very irritant ‘chocolate’ material contents can cause
peritonism. Malignant change within endometriotic
lesions is rare and most commonly occurs in ovarian
endometriosis.

Treatment
Treatment of endometriosis is indicated to:
• Alleviate symptoms.
• Stop
progression of disease and development of

complications.
• Improve
fertility.

Treatment depends on the severity of the disease and
should be tailored to the woman’s needs; it can be
medical or surgical.

22

Treatment

Progestogens
Endometriosis is a recurring
disease and initial treatment
should be followed by
maintenance therapy. Maintenance therapy is usually
medical and aims to reduce the number of periods
which reduces the incidence and rate of recurrence.
Tricycling the COCP is the gold standard maintenance
therapy but the Mirena IUS can also be used.

Medical treatment
The lesions of endometriosis regress in response to
pregnancy and the menopause. Medical treatment
is therefore aimed at mimicking one of these two
physiological processes (Fig. 22.5).

Combined oral contraceptive pill
The COCP suppresses ovulation and the normal
cyclical ovarian production of oestrogen and
progesterone. Mild symptoms of endometriosis
may be controlled by using the COCP but it is more
often used as maintenance therapy following initial
treatment. Endometriosis is a recurring disease,
with up to 40% of women developing recurring
symptoms within 1 year of stopping treatment.
Initial treatment should therefore be followed
by maintenance therapy to reduce the chance of
recurrence. Maintenance therapy aims to suppress
or reduce the frequency of periods and this can be
achieved by tricycling a continuous dose combined
oral contraceptive pill.

Continuous progestogen therapy effectively induces
a state of pseudopregnancy, causing decidualization
of endometriotic deposits, which then regress.
Progestogens can be taken orally or as depot
preparations, and treatment should be for 6 months.

GnRH analogues
This class of synthetic drugs are GnRH superagonists.
Continued administration desensitizes pituitary
gonadotrophes and results in a temporary, reversible
state of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, in other
words, a temporary, reversible, chemical menopause.
GnRH analogues are as effective as Danazol in
reducing the symptoms and severity of endometriosis
and are usually used for 3–6 months. Their
menopausal side-effects are often better tolerated
than the androgenic side-effects of Danazol and can
be reduced by using ‘add-back’ continuous combined
hormone replacement therapy (see Chapter 19).

Gestrinone
Gestrinone is a synthetic steroid that has mild
androgenic, marked antioestrogenic and antipro­
gestogenic activity. It exhibits similar endocrine effects
to those of Danazol without significantly reducing
basal levels of gonadotrophins. Clinical response is
also similar to Danazol.

Danazol
Danazol is a testosterone derivative and used to
be first-line medical treatment for endometriosis.
It is now rarely used. As well as its androgenic

properties, Danazol produces a hypo-oestrogenic
and hypoprogestogenic state, and it is this
pseudomenopausal state that induces endometrial
regression and atrophy. The mode of action of
Danazol is complex; it acts at pituitary, ovarian and
target tissue levels. It should be taken for 6–9 months
and the dose should be titrated to the patient’s
response and presence of side-effects. Patients
should be warned to stop treatment if they develop

ureters. Recurrence of symptoms might occur not
only because endometriosis is a recurring disease
but because endometriotic deposits not visible to
the naked eye will not have been destroyed. Diffuse
peritoneal endometriosis might be better treated
medically. Pregnancy rates following conservative
surgery are directly related to the severity of the
disease.

Surgical therapy

Definitive radical surgery for endometriosis is
reserved for women who no longer wish to maintain
fertility and in whom other forms of treatment have
failed. Total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral
salpingo-oophorectomy is the procedure of choice.
It is the removal of the ovaries, the main source of
oestrogens, that produces an hypo-oestrogenic state
and effectively treats the endometriosis. As many of
these women are relatively young, HRT is advised.
Oestrogen replacement may cause a recurrence of
endometriosis in a small percentage of women and
should therefore be kept to a minimum. Continuous
combined oestrogen and progesterone replacement
might further reduce the rate of recurrence because of
the effects of progestogens on endometriosis.

Surgical treatment of endometriosis can be
conservative or radical. Which method is used depends
on the patient’s:
• Age.
• Fertility
requirements.

• Response
to medical treatment.

therapy. Complications include damage to other
pelvic structures including bowel, bladder and

Incidence
Benign ovarian cysts are common and often
asymptomatic, resolving spontaneously. Therefore,
despite being a frequent cause for admission to
hospital, their exact incidence is unknown. About
80% of ovarian tumours are benign, but this
percentage changes with age. Malignant tumours
(20%) are more common in the postmenopausal
age-group.

Aetiology
Ovarian tumours can be physiological (functional)
or pathological (benign or malignant). Classification
depends on the ovarian tissue from which they arise
(Fig. 23.1). Excluding the physiological group, a germ
cell tumour is the more common diagnosis in a woman
less than 40 years of age, whereas an epithelial cell
tumour is more likely in an older woman.
Risk factors for ovarian tumours include obesity,
infertility, hypothyroidism, early menarche and
tamoxifen therapy.

Physiological cysts
These are often asymptomatic and occur commonly
in younger women.

Follicular cysts
These are the result of either non-rupture of the
dominant follicle during the normal ovarian cycle or

failure of atresia of a non-dominant follicle. Smaller
cysts might resolve spontaneously but intervention
could be necessary if the cyst causes symptoms (see
below) or if ultrasound follow-up shows an increase
in size.

Luteal cysts
Corpus luteal cysts are less common than follicular
cysts. However, they are more likely to present
with intraperitoneal bleeding secondary to rupture.
This occurs more commonly on the right side and
typically rupture occurs on day 20 to 26.

Theca lutein cysts
These are the least common of the functional ovarian
cysts. They are usually bilateral and occur with
pregnancy including molar pregnancy. They may be
large, up to 30 cm, they are usually multicystic and
regress spontaneously.

Benign epithelial tumours
The majority of ovarian cysts arise from the ovarian
epithelium. They develop from the coelomic
epithelium over the gonadal ridge of the embryo and
are therefore derived from any of the pelvic organs or
the renal tract.

Serous cystadenoma
This is the most common tumour in this group. They
are bilateral in about 10% of cases and they contain
thin serous fluid, usually within a unilocular cavity.
Histologically, they appear to have a tubal origin.

Mucinous cystadenoma
These tumours are typically unilateral, larger in size
compared with serous cystadenomas, and multilocular
with thick mucoid fluid. The mucus-secreting cells are
likely to indicate an endocervical derivation.

Endometrioid tumours
These are mostly malignant tumours arising from
endometrial cells.

Brenner tumours
The majority of these tumours are benign. They arise
from uroepithelial cell lines and contain transitional
epithelium. 10–15% are bilateral, they are usually
small in size, and some secrete oestrogen, causing
irregular vaginal bleeding.

Benign germ cell tumours
These tumours are among the most common in
women under the age of 30. Such tumours arise
from totipotential germ cells and thus can contain
elements of all three layers of embryonic tissue
– ectodermal derivatives such as teeth and hair,
endodermal tissue such as intestine and mesodermal
structures such as bone.

Mature cystic teratoma
Also known as a dermoid cyst, this common type
of tumour has a median age of presentation of
30 years with about 10% being bilateral. Most are

122

asymptomatic but they can undergo torsion (up to
10%) or, rarely, rupture.

Mature solid teratomas
Much less common than a dermoid cyst, these
tumours must be distinguished from an immature
solid teratoma which is malignant.

Benign sex cord stromal tumours
Such tumours account for only about 4% of benign
ovarian tumours. Many secrete hormones and
thus present at any age with hormonally mediated
symptoms.

Theca cell tumours
These cysts are nearly always benign solid tumours
presenting over the age of 50 years (in contrast,
granulosa cell tumours are always malignant). Many
secrete oestrogen and thus have systemic effects such
as postmenopausal bleeding.

Fibroma
These tumours are rare and can be associated with
ascites. Most are derived from stromal cells. Meigs
syndrome is seen in 1% of cases. It is characterized
by a solid ovarian tumour, usually a fibroma
(could be thecoma, a cystadenoma or granulosa
cell tumour), accompanied by ascites and pleural
effusion. Treatment of Meigs’ syndrome consists
of thoracocentesis and paracentesis to drain off the
excess fluid, and unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
to correct the underlying aetiology.

Other benign ovarian tumours
Women with endometriosis may develop ovarian
endometriomas (chocolate cysts) which can enlarge
to 6 to 8 cm in size (see Chapter 22). They tend to
have a typical ultrasound appearance and may need
treatment depending on the symptoms with which
they present. A mass that does not resolve with
observation may be an endometrioma.

History
Benign ovarian tumours can be asymptomatic,
detected by routine bimanual palpation during
a cervical smear test or on routine antenatal

symptoms include:

Figure 23.2 shows the differential diagnoses that
need to be considered for the history, examination
and investigations. The history must include the
date of the LMP and the regularity of the menstrual
cycle, as well as current contraception, if appropriate.
Any history of gastrointestinal symptoms might be
important, for example, a patient with an ovarian
torsion might present with sudden onset of rightsided abdominal pain associated with nausea and
vomiting, and appendicitis must be excluded.

Benign ovarian cysts that undergo an
accident (rupture or torsion) can present
as an acute abdomen. Always exclude an
ectopic pregnancy in a woman of childbearing age.

intraperitoneal bleeding that leads to hypovolaemia.
In a young patient, this might present at first with
tachycardia and cold peripheries, with hypotension
developing as a relatively late sign.
Distension might be seen on abdominal
inspection, resulting from the cyst itself or from
ascites if the cyst is malignant. If the cyst has
undergone torsion, or if there is haemorrhage into
the cyst so that the capsule stretches, abdominal
palpation will elicit tenderness. This is typically in
the iliac fossa and may be associated with signs of
peritonism. A large ovarian tumour can rise up out
of the pelvis and be palpated in the abdomen; this
should be excluded by moving the left hand distally
from the xiphisternum towards the pelvis (see
Chapter 46). Ascites should be excluded by testing
for shifting dullness.
Bimanual palpation of the pelvic organs, as
described in Chapter 46, is essential. If the tumour
has presented acutely with abdominal pain then
adnexal tenderness or an adnexal mass will assist in
excluding gastrointestinal aetiology. Assessing the
size of the uterus will help to exclude a fibroid uterus
or intrauterine pregnancy. If there seems to be an
adnexal mass, then its approximate size, consistency
and the presence of any tenderness should be
elicited.

Asymptomatic cysts
Ovarian cysts can be managed conservatively if they are
asymptomatic. This depends on the patient’s age and
the size of the cyst (Fig. 23.3). In a younger woman
(usually taken as less than 40 years of age), the risk of
the tumour being malignant is reduced and therefore
the cyst can be monitored with pelvic ultrasound scans.
A physiological cyst is likely to resolve spontaneously
but, if it persists or increases in size, then a laparoscopy
or laparotomy might be indicated.
The oral contraceptive pill is thought to be very
effective in preventing formation of functional
tumours but their use in shrinking or resolving cystic
tumours has not been proven.

Once the RMI is calculated, follow-up investigations,
laparoscopic assessment or laparotomy is advised in
an appropriate centre.

Symptomatic cysts
If the patient presents with severe acute pain, an
emergency laparoscopy and/or laparotomy is
appropriate. With chronic symptoms, a procedure
can be planned electively.
Thus the appropriate treatment for an ovarian
tumour depends on many factors. A woman in
whom a selective cystectomy is attempted must be
advised of the risk of oophorectomy if haemostasis
cannot be achieved or if the cyst cannot be isolated.
Ovarian cystectomy and oophorectomy (removal of
ovary) can be performed either laparoscopically or by
laparotomy. The choice depends on:

If the patient is young, with minimal risk of
malignancy, a laparoscopic procedure might be an
option. In suspected malignancy, it may be more
appropiate to perform a laparotomy, possibly
including bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy and
infracolic omentectomy (see Chapter 24).

An ovarian cyst thought to be benign can
be managed by observation, laparoscopic
or open ovarian cystectomy.

Objectives
• In the presence of ovarian cysts, features that suggest malignancy will be discussed
• Chemotherapy for ovarian cancer will be discussed and common side effects
• Epidemioligical features and presentation of endometrial carcinomas will be discussed.

Ovarian Malignancy
Ovarian malignancy is the most common gynaeco­
logical malignancy and over 50% of ovarian cancer
occurs in women aged 45–65 years. Ovarian tumours
can be divided into different groups according to
their cell of origin: epithelial, sex cord stromal or
germ cell, and whether they are benign (see Chapter
22), borderline or malignant. Most tumours are
derived from epithelial cells; their particularly
unpleasant characteristic is that they cause nonspecific symptoms and therefore women often
present ‘late’, when spread has already occurred. Their
staging, treatment and survival rates are summarized
in Fig. 24.1.

There are 6000 new cases of
ovarian cancer diagnosed each
year in England and Wales;
75% of those diagnosed will die of the disease within
5 years of diagnosis.

Aetiology
The life factors that increase and reduce the risk of
developing ovarian cancer are shown in Fig. 24.2.
Women with a familial predisposition to ovarian
cancer probably account for around 10% of cases, and
most of these will have either the BRCA1 or BRCA2
mutations (chromosomes 17 and 13), or the Lynch
II syndrome (an autosomal dominant inherited
disorder that predisposes to breast, endometrial,
colonic and ovarian cancer).

Presentation
Ovarian tumours are relatively ‘silent’, producing
vague symptoms. Pain is rare but could occur if the
ovary twists (torsion) or if there is bleeding into the
tumour. More common are abdominal distension,
urinary frequency due to pressure on the bladder
and gastrointestinal upset (e.g. vague diarrhoea or
constipation symptoms and upper GI symptoms).

Investigations
Ultrasound
Ultrasound scans will identify an ovarian mass.
Features suspicious of malignancy include:
• A
 solid rather than a cystic mass, or a cyst
containing septae.
• Mass
measuring more than 5 cm.

• Presence
of ascites.

• Bilateral
tumours.

If cancer is suspected an ultrasound of the liver is
performed to look for metastatic disease.

CA125
This tumour marker is often raised with epithelial
tumours of the ovary, although it can also be high in
the presence of fibroids, endometriosis, diverticular
disease and pregnancy, thus giving false-positive
results. False negatives are also possible: some
malignant tumours, especially mucinous tumours,
will not secrete high levels of CA125.

Management
Surgery
Surgery is performed unless there are distant
metastases, the aim being to remove as much tumour

mass as possible. A midline abdominal incision
is used. Uterus, tubes, ovaries and omentum are
removed. The pelvis is carefully explored, looking
for and biopsying any suspected deposits. Peritoneal
fluid is sent for cytology.
Staging will determine further management.
Unless distant metastases have been seen on scans
prior to surgery, it is the operation that will define
the stage, on the basis of what is found at laparotomy
and the ensuing pathology report.
Stage I tumours are treated with surgery alone but
stage II and III tumours will require chemotherapy.
Stage IV tumours (distant metastases present) can be
operated upon but this will not be for cure – surgery is
performed for staging or to relieve bowel obstruction
only.

126

Chemotherapy

Another option for treatment might be
to give chemotherapy prior to surgery
to shrink the tumour mass – studies are
ongoing to look into this further.

Combination therapy is used, for example cyclo­
phosphamide + carboplatin or Taxol + carboplatin.
Common side-effects include:
•
•
•
•

Myelosuppression.

Nausea
and vomiting.

Peripheral
neuropathy.

Alopecia.


Taxol gives severe hypersensitivity reactions so a
‘pre-med’ of corticosteroid and antihistamine is
needed. Platins are also toxic to the kidney, ear
and eye. Cisplatin, an older platin drug, had a poor
side-effect profile so has been largely superseded by
carboplatin.

Screening
The rationale for screening for ovarian cancer is to
reduce the late presentation that currently results
in poor survival. Unfortunately, screening for this
condition is very difficult, partly because there is

24

Uterine endometrial tumours
no premalignant stage but also because there is no
one test to diagnose ovarian cancer. Large studies
have looked at using CA125 and ultrasound (with or
without Doppler), but the non-specificity of CA125
adds to the confusion and, at present, there is no
screening programme.

Incidence

Pathology and spread

Endometrial carcinoma affects 20 women per 100 000
women per year in the UK. The median age of women
affected is 61, and 80% are postmenopausal.

Endometrial cancer is an adenocarcinoma, the most
common type being endometrioid. Other subtypes
are adenocanthoma, papillary serous and clear cell
adenocarcinomas. The latter two have a particularly
poor prognosis.
Spread is initially local myometrial invasion and
then transperitoneal. Lymphatic spread occurs to the
para-aortic nodes. Staging is shown in Fig. 24.4.

Risk factors
Predisposing factors are shown in Fig. 24.3 and
include women who have high oestrogen levels
(obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, tamoxifen
therapy) and those who have had many menses
(nulliparous, late menopause). The COCP protects
against endometrial carcinoma, halving the users
risk. The protective effect is most marked where
the COCP has been used for more than 10 years
and it continues for at least 20 years after the
woman stops taking the pill. A family history of
breast or colon cancer might point to the Lynch II
syndrome.
Endometrial hyperplasia is recognized as being
a premalignant condition. Simple (also called
cystic) hyperplasia and complex (adenomatous)
hyperplasia are unlikely to progress to carcinoma
but can be treated with progesterone to encourage
regression. Atypical hyperplasia, however, is likely
to progress, and in many cases might indicate that
a carcinoma is already present in another part of the
uterus.

The majority of women
(>90%) with postmenopausal
bleeding will not have cancer
and this is important information with which to
reassure anxious patients.

Presentation
Most women present with bleeding that is either
abnormal perimenopausal or postmenopausal.

Remember that women with
atypical hyperplasia of the
endometrium have a 30%
chance of progression to endometrial cancer if left
untreated and so the option of definitive surgery,
hysterectomy, should be discussed.

Investigation
Women with postmenopausal or suspicious
perimenopausal bleeding should be investigated
with pelvic ultrasound to measure the endometrial
thickness and also some form of endometrial
sampling. Endometrial cancer causes thickening
of the endometrium and in the postmenopausal
state should be less than 5 mm. Pipelle sampling
involves the passage of a thin plastic tube through
the cervix into the uterine cavity and uses aspiration
to obtain an endometrial biopsy. This technique only

samples 4% of the endometrial surface area. It can be
performed in the outpatient setting without the need
for anaesthetic but causes period-type pain during
and after the procedure. The pipelle endometrial
biopsy may be expected to miss a number of tumours
but in combination with ultrasound it is a useful
tool. Alternatively, endometrial tissue can be sampled
at the time of hysteroscopy under general anaesthetic,
either under direct vision (using a resectoscope) or
blind, with a curette.
Once a tissue diagnosis is obtained, an MRI scan
is performed to assess the extent of myometrial
invasion and thus differentiate between stages Ia and
Ib and those above (see Fig. 24.4). Stages Ia and Ib
can be treated locally; higher stages should be treated
in a regional cancer centre. The decision as to where
to treat should be discussed in a multi disciplinary
regional cancer meeting.

Treatment
Stages Ia and Ib are treated by total abdominal
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy
(TAH + BSO). The vaginal route of hysterectomy is
not suitable for the treatment of cancer. The role of
lymphadenectomy for treatment of these stages is
unclear and is being investigated. Washings are taken
from the peritoneum for cytology.
Stages Ic and IIa are treated by TAH + BSO followed
by radiotherapy. This might be external beam or
intravaginal (brachytherapy).

128

Stage IIb is treated first with radiotherapy. Stage III
needs debulking surgery prior to radiotherapy. Stage
IV tumours are incurable, so the woman will need
palliative care and treatment as necessary.

Prognosis
The overall recurrence rate is 30%; cases with
positive lymph nodes or peritoneal cytology are
more likely to recur than those without (50% versus
10%). Most tumour recurrence occurs within 2–3
years and the earlier recurrences are harder to treat,
and therefore carry a poorer prognosis. Isolated
vaginal recurrences can be treated with radiotherapy.
Later recurrence can be treated with progestogens
in the first instance. If hormonal treatment fails
chemotherapy is used.
Survival rates are shown in Fig. 24.4; the overall
survival rate is 60% at 5 years.

Uterine Sarcoma

Stromal sarcoma
Tumours of stromal cells can be divided into the
following categories:
• Low-grade
sarcomas: look like fibroids, are slow
growing. Treatment is TAH + BSO with wide
excision of the parametria.

Cervix
• High-grade
sarcomas: aggressive tumours

with less than 50% survival rates, treated with
radiotherapy.
• Mixed
Mullerian tumours: derived from the

glandular cells within the stroma, these are
aggressive tumours that commonly spread to
cervix and lymph nodes. Treatment is TAH + BSO
with postoperative radiotherapy.

Myometrial sarcoma
Leiomyosarcoma could be described as a ‘malignant
fibroid’, although only 5–10% of them arise within
an existing fibroid they are macroscopically very
similar, being tumours of smooth muscle cells.
Often diagnosis is not made until a TAH specimen
is examined histologically but lymph node sampling
and BSO must be performed.

Cervix

Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) is a
premalignant condition of the cervix. CIN is divided
into three grades, although the disease itself is a
continuum. CIN grading is shown in Fig. 24.5.
The national screening programme was designed to
detect CIN on smear tests, thus allowing intervention
before the condition progressed to cancer. The first
smear is performed at age 25, then smears are taken
at intervals of 3–5 years, stopping at age 64 years if the
previous two smears have been negative.

Smears should be performed every 3–5
years from age 25 years.

Atypical myometrial tumours
Leiomyoblastoma, clear cell leiomyoma and epi­
thelioid leiomyoma are tumours of smooth muscle
that occur most often in premenopausal women
and are oestrogen dependent. Treatment is therefore
TAH + BSO and the issue of HRT is difficult.

�������

24

The success of screening is seen in the fact that the
incidence of cervical carcinoma has decreased by 25%
since 1986, and mortality is decreasing. However,

Gynaecological malignancy
many women still die and those who are missed by
screening are often women who have a much higher
chance of having and dying from cervical cancer
because of their high-risk factor profile. Around 85%
of women in the UK are screened.
The smear test does have its limitations;
the result is governed by subjective cytological
assessment, the technique is subject to sampling
errors, and it has false negative (2–20%) and false
positive (10–13%) rates. Screening for Human
Papilloma Virus (HPV) increases sensitivity and
specificity Fig. 24.6)

Aetiology of CIN
The risk factors for CIN are the same as those for
cervical carcinoma (Fig. 24.9). HPV is described more
fully in Fig. 24.6.

Management of CIN
Figure 24.7 provides an algorithm for management
of CIN based on the smear result and on the
patient’s smear history. The first smear showing
mild dyskariosis does not merit referral because,
especially if the woman is a non-smoker, there is a
good chance that over 6 months the cells will revert
to normal. The moderate and severe dyskaryosis
cases (fewer than 2% of smears) should be referred
for colposcopy.

Smoking makes it less likely that lowgrade CIN will resolve, and more likely
that CIN will recur after treatment.

At colposcopy the cervix is washed with acetic
acid and then with iodine. The cervix is inspected for
suspicious features (Fig. 24.8). Abnormal areas can
be biopsied, meaning that the patient will be invited
back at a later date for treatment if appropriate, or
treatment can be performed at this point.
Treatment consists of either excising or destroying
the transformation zone. Excision techniques include
LLETZ (large loop excision of transformation zone),
NETZ (needle excision of transformation zone)
and cone biopsy; these allow the tissue removed
to be sent for histology and examined to confirm
the diagnosis and to check the margins, ensuring
complete excision. Destructive techniques include
cold coagulation, diathermy or laser.
Initial treatment has 95% success rate. Patients are
followed up with a smear.

Cervical Carcinoma
Cervical cancer affects 20 per 100 000 women per year
in the UK. There is a ‘double peak’ in terms of age

Fig. 24.6 Human papilloma virus information box
• Double-stranded DNA viruses
• Over 90 different types identified, 30 of which present in the human genital tract
• Most lead to focal epithelial proliferation, some are linked to cervical cancer
• Low-risk virus types: associated with benign warts and occasionally CIN1 –
HPV6, HPV11, HPV42, HPV43 and HPV 44
• Intermediate-risk virus types: associated with CIN2 and CIN3 but rarely seen with
invasive cancer – HPV33, HPV35, HPV39, HPV45, HPV51, HPV52 and HPV56
• High-risk virus types: commonly detected in women with CIN2, CIN3 or
invasive cancer – HPV16, HPV18 and HPV31
• High-risk HPV types lead to increased degradation of p53, a tumour suppressor
• Higher viral load is associated with a higher risk of developing invasive cancer
• The prevalence of HPV in sexually active women under 30 is 20–40% but
most women will clear themselves of HPV within 6–8 months
• Smoking and increasing age make it less likely that the virus will be cleared.

group affected as it is most common in 40–44 and

are shown in Fig. 24.9.

Pathology
Squamous cell tumours account for 90–95% of cervical
cancers, the other 5–10% are adenocarcinomas derived
from cervical glands. The national cervical screening
programme aims to detect changes in the cervix that
occur before squamous cell tumours develop – it was
not designed to look for adenocarcinomas.

Presentation and investigation
Women can present with symptoms of abnormal
bleeding, particularly intermenstrual and postcoital,
or might be asymptomatic but have had an abnormal
smear result. At colposcopy suspicious features are
noted (see Fig. 24.8).

Staging
Staging is shown in Fig. 24.10. The procedures
necessary to stage the tumour are:
•
•
•
•

Cone
biopsy, to assess depth of invasion.

Chest
X-ray.

Intravenous
urogram (IVU).

Cystoscopy
and
sigmoidoscopy or MRI to look

for bladder/bowel involvement.

Management
Patients with cervical tumours that have progressed
beyond the microinvasive stage should be referred to
a regional cancer centre for treatment by a specialist
multidisciplinary team.
Treatment is summarized in the algorithm in Fig.
24.11. Early-stage disease (stages I and IIa) can be
treated equally well with surgery or radiotherapy,

131

Gynaecological malignancy
although surgery is preferred because it leads to
fewer sexual, bowel and bladder problems in the
long term. Later-stage disease is treated with radical
radiotherapy. At present chemotherapy use is only
experimental. When the disease has spread (stage
IVb) palliative treatment is appropriate.

������������

Incidence and aetiology
Vulval tumours are uncommon, affecting around 1 in
100 000 women per year. The peak incidence is from
the age of 63–65. Predisposing factors include:
• Smoking.
• Immunosuppression.

• Vulvar
maturation disorders, e.g. lichen sclerosus

(Fig. 24.12).
• History
of CIN, VIN or HPV.

�����������������������������

Pathology
The majority of vulval tumours are squamous cell
carcinomas. Non-squamous cell tumours include
melanoma, sarcoma, adenocarcinoma and basal cell
tumours. Paget’s disease of the vulva is a malignant
change in cells of the epidermal layer, which have
a characteristic appearance. The presence of vulval
Paget’s disease is associated with an adenocarcinoma
elsewhere in the body in one in four cases, with
the most common sites being breast, urinary tract,
rectum and genital tract.

Presentation
The most common presenting symptoms are:
•
•
•
•

Pruritus.

Lump/ulcer.

Bleeding.

Pain.


Urinary symptoms or unusual discharge can also be
symptoms. The most common sites are shown in Fig.
24.13. The tumour may be multifocal.

Fig. 24.12 Lichen sclerosus information box
Lichen sclerosus is a benign skin condition, with white
plaques and atrophy seen in a figure-of-eight pattern
around the vulva and anus. Extragenital plaques on the
trunk and back might be seen. It is associated with
autoimmune disorders, e.g. vitiligo. It can be classed as
premalignant, as around 4% will go on to develop vulval
squamous cell carcinoma

Fig. 24.13 Squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva – most common sites.

Spread
Local spread occurs to the vagina, perineum, clitoris,
urethra and pubic bone. Lymphatic spread is to the
superficial inguinal, deep inguinofemoral and iliac
nodes. Unless the tumour is central only the nodes
on the affected side are involved.

Investigation
Biopsy is performed, and at the time of biopsy the
vagina and cervix are thoroughly inspected for signs
of involvement. Positive nodes may detected by CT
or MRI scan.

Staging
Stages are shown in Fig. 24.14 but the disease can
be more broadly divided into ‘early’ and ‘late’, with
those having nodal involvement or large, multifocal
lesions being in the latter group.

Management
The aim of treatment is to excise the cancer and
minimize the risk of recurrence while preserving as
much function as possible. Patients should be treated
in a regional cancer centre.
The management plan depends on the stage; early
tumours are treated by wide local excision. If the initial
biopsy showed the depth of invasion to be more than
1 mm, the nodes on the affected side must be dissected,
if less than 1 mm nodal dissection is unnecessary.

Larger tumours are treated by radical vulvectomy,
with ipsilateral node dissection if the tumour is less
than 2 cm in diameter and bilateral if it is more than
2 cm. If groin nodes are not obviously involved the
operation can be performed using either one incision
(en bloc) or three separate incisions (the butterfly
method); the latter seems to reduce the postoperative
complications without increasing mortality or
recurrence.
Radiotherapy is necessary if histology reveals the
nodes to be positive. Chemotherapy has not been
shown to be helpful.
Complications of treatment are shown in Fig.
24.15. Due to the large area involved, wound
breakdown is, sadly, relatively common. With the en
bloc method it occurs in up to 80% of cases, whereas
rates for the butterfly incision are between 5 and
50%. Some surgeons advocate performing skin grafts
at the time of initial surgery. Radiotherapy adds extra
complications.

Prognosis
The most important factor is nodal involvement, and
in particular whether the pelvic nodes are positive.
Overall survival rates at 5 years are:
• Node negative: 70–90%.
• Node
positive: 25–40%.

Patients with positive pelvic nodes, as opposed to
groin nodes only, very rarely survive.

Vaginal Tumours
Vaginal tumours are rare and are usually either primary
squamous carcinoma or spread from vulval or cervical
squamous cancers. Even rarer tumours include
endodermal sinus tumours, rhabdomyosarcoma
(both seen in children, but the latter also seen in older
women) melanoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma and
leiomyosarcoma.

Aetiology
Associations are with CIN and HPV, and with a
history of another gynaecological malignancy in the
past.

Presentation
The upper third of the vagina is the most common
site, and women usually present at an early stage with
abnormal bleeding.

Investigation
Staging is shown in Fig. 24.16 and requires biopsy,

• This chapter will explain the importance of age at presentation in diagnosing the likely
causes of pruritus vulvae
• The diagnosis and treatment of lichen sclerosus, the commonest of the vulval
dystrophies, will be understood
• Methods of assessing the vulval skin will be described.

Diseases of the vulva are, to some, difficult to
understand. This is likely to be due to a combination
of the lack of information or understanding of the
aetiology of and the classification of these diseases.
Although the vulval dystrophies have recently been
renamed (Fig. 25.1), to avoid confusion the more
familiar names will be used here.

Any of the vulval conditions
(including vulval carcinoma)
may present simply as pruritus
and so the symptom of pruritus vulvae
should not be underestimated.

Lichen sclerosus
Please take heed of the new nomenclature
as this can be very confusing.

Histology of the Vulva
The whole surface of the vulva up to the inner
aspect of the labia minora is covered by stratified,
keratinized squamous epithelium with a superficial
cornified layer. The cornified layer is absent in
the vagina and there is a decreasing degree of
keratinization (Fig. 25.2). The anatomy of the vulva
is shown in Fig. 25.3.

Lichen sclerosus is the most common of the vulval
dystrophies. It usually develops in postmenopausal
women although any age group can be affected,
including prepubertal girls (Fig. 25.4). The aetiology
is unknown.
Affected skin is typically thin, shiny and can be
white (leucoplakia) or red due to inflammation.
Anatomical changes include shrinkage or loss of the
labia minora and shrinkage of the introitus. Adhesions
can fuse the labia together. Lichen sclerosus can affect
the perineum and perianal region.
Diagnosis is made histologically from vulval
biopsies. Treatment is aimed at relieving the itching
Fig. 25.1 New nomenclature for the vulval dystrophies

Vulval Dystrophies
Histologically, the vulval dystrophies are divided into
atrophic and hypertrophic or a mixed picture of both.
Atrophic vulval dystrophy is better known as lichen
sclerosus.

and soreness and, as this is a chronic relapsing
condition, treatment is usually intermittent. Simple
emollient creams can relieve mild symptoms but,
if severe, short courses of potent topical steroids
might be needed. Testosterone cream is sometimes
used but probably acts more as an emollient than
hormonally.
Complications are unusual and include anatomical
changes and the risk of malignancy. Anatomical
changes can cause dyspareunia and, if fusion of the
labia occurs in the midline, difficulty in micturition,
which might require separation of the labia. Longterm follow-up of women with lichen sclerosus
is important as up to 5% will develop squamous
carcinoma of the vulva.

lesions are raised, thickened and can be white, grey
or red depending on the degree of inflammation.
Treatment is with topical steroids and the condition
is likely to recur.

Hyperplastic vulval dystrophy

This is a relatively uncommon condition, although
the incidence is increasing in young women.
Human papilloma virus (specifically HPV 16) has
been implicated in the aetiology. Histologically,
neoplastic cells are contained within the basement
membrane and the degree of dysplasia is divided into

mild, moderate and severe (VIN 1, VIN 2 and VIN 3,
respectively).
Symptoms include pruritus, pain, soreness and
palpable lesions but many are asymptomatic and found
incidentally. Lesions can be papular (like genital warts)
or macular with irregular borders. They can be red,
brown or black (pigmented), or white (leucoplakia)
and ulceration might be present. Unifocal lesions are
more common postmenopausally. The diagnosis is
made histologically from vulval biopsies.

Distinguishing the vulval
diseases by naked eye is often
inaccurate. Therefore most
vulval lesions should be diagnosed histologically
with or without colposcopic assessment of the
vulva. This is especially important to exclude
malignant change.

ablation or local excision and up to one-third will
recur. Although associated with adenocarcinoma,
malignant change within the lesion is rare.

Dermatological Conditions
Treatment is usually surgical, either by ablating the
lesion with laser or cryotherapy or by local excision.
VIN will recur in up to 80% of treated women and as
the risk of malignant change is small, especially in
younger women, major mutilating surgery should be
avoided. Surgical treatment is recommended when

Squamous carcinoma of the vulva is discussed in
Chapter 23.

Paget’s disease of the vulva
Paget’s disease of the vulva is uncommon; it is usually
seen in postmenopausal women. The aetiology is
unknown although the lesion is thought to be of
glandular origin. In 25% of cases, there is an underlying
adenocarcinoma (breast, urinary, genital or colonic).
Lesions can be unifocal or multifocal and are
typically clearly defined, scaly, erythematous plaques
with varying degrees of ulceration and leucoplakia.

Many dermatological conditions can affect the vulva
often with a confusing clinical picture, especially if
the vulva is the only area affected.

Psoriasis
The typical raised, erythematous, scaly lesions of
psoriasis can occur on the vulva, although here
they might appear smooth and without the scaling.
The presence of psoriasis elsewhere on the body
will suggest the diagnosis, which can be confirmed
histologically. Treatment is with topical steroids but
the relapse rate is high.

Eczema
Eczema of the vulva is rare. More commonly,
eczematous reactions occur due to contact with
irritant substances such as soaps and detergents.
Treatment is by identifying and removing the source
of irritation and topical steroids.

Objectives

List the differential diagnoses for PID
Describe the investigations necessary to exclude PID
List the potential sequelae of PID
Discuss the principles of treatment for PID
Consider the issues in public health with respect to PID.

Definition
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is defined as the
clinical syndrome associated with ascending spread
of microorganisms from the vagina or cervix to the
endometrium, fallopian tubes and/or contiguous
structures. It usually begins with an acute infection;
this might resolve completely or develop a chronic
course with repeated acute or subacute episodes.

Incidence
The true incidence of PID is difficult to determine
because of the lack of a precise clinical definition or
a specific diagnostic test. However, the incidence is
strongly correlated with the prevalence of sexually
transmitted infections, and has increased in most
countries. In the USA, the highest annual incidence is
among sexually active women in their teenage years;
75% of cases occur in women under the age of 25.
Fig. 26.1 outlines risk factors for the development of
PID.

Aetiology
• Chlamydia trachomatis.
• Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
• Non-specific organisms.
Chlamydia trachomatis is the most common cause of
PID in the UK. Along with Neisseria gonorrhoeae, this

microorganism is responsible for at least 60% of cases
of PID. They are thought to act as primary pathogens,
causing damage to the protective mechanisms of the
endocervix and allowing endogenous bacteria from
the vagina and cervix into the upper genital tract as
secondary invaders. A variety of endogenous aerobic
and anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from
women with PID, such as Mycoplasma species, but
their exact role is uncertain.
PID can also develop secondary to other disease
processes, such as appendicitis. Rarely, it is part of
more generalized disease such as tuberculosis.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis of PID is sometimes difficult to
make, since it does not rely on one particular sign
or symptom or a specific diagnostic test. However,
it is thought that the benefits of early diagnosis and
appropriate treatment outweigh the possible overuse
of antibiotics in a patient who might seem to have
only mild disease.
The differential diagnoses (see Chapter 2)
include:
Appendicitis.
Ovarian cyst accident.
Endometriosis.
Early pregnancy complications including ectopic
pregnancy.
• Urinary tract infection.
• Constipation.

History
The history may include one or more of the following
symptoms:
• Pelvic pain/lower abdominal pain, usually
bilateral.
• Deep dyspareunia.
• Dysmenorrhoea.
• Abnormal or increased vaginal discharge.
• Fever.

Sensitivity is essential when
taking a sexual history. It
should include timing of last
intercourse, as well as number of recent partners. Use
of contraception, in particular barrier methods, should
be assessed. Take care not to make assumptions about
a patient, for example, with respect to age and sexual
activity.

PID can also be asymptomatic (Fig. 26.2), pre­
senting many years after the acute infection with
subfertility.

142

At least three of the following signs should be present
to make the diagnosis of acute PID:
Raised temperature >37.5°C.
Tachycardia
Abdominal tenderness.
Purulent vaginal discharge.
Cervical excitation (pain or discomfort on
moving the cervix).
• Adnexal tenderness.
• Adnexal swelling.
•
•
•
•
•

Investigations
Appropriate investigations include:
•
•
•
•
•

•
•
•

White blood cell count (WBC).
C reactive protein (CRP).
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR).
Blood cultures, depending on the level of the
pyrexia.
Full screen for sexually transmitted infections,
including high vaginal swab, endocervical swabs
and urethral swabs.
MSU specimen.
Pregnancy test (urinary β-hCG).
Ultrasound scan, usually transvaginal,
is appropriate to exclude an ovarian cyst
complication or a tubo-ovarian abscess.

Swabs taken to exclude sexually transmitted infections
are now examined using nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAATs). These are replacing enzyme-linked
immuno-assays because of the improved detection
rates (90–95% compared with 40–70%).
Laparoscopy is considered to be the gold standard
with respect to diagnosis of acute PID. However, in
practice, it is only considered if there is doubt about
the differential diagnoses, such as the presence of
an ovarian cyst, or if the patient fails to respond to
antibiotic therapy. In acute disease, the pelvis will
appear generally inflamed, with pus seen around
the Fallopian tubes. These latter may be distended.
In chronic disease, there may be generalized
pelvic adhesions or evidence of old tubal disease/
hydrosalpinges. Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome indicates
previous Chlamydia infection, when the typical bowstring perihepatic adhesions are seen.

Complications
The long-term morbidity associated with acute PID
is considerable (Fig. 26.3) and thus the need for
prompt appropriate treatment, especially to cover
chlamydial infection, is important. Moderately severe
disease is associated with inflammation and oedema
in the fallopian tubes, with deposits of fibrin and
subsequent adhesion formation between the pelvic
and abdominal organs. Thus, tubal morphology and
function are affected resulting in subfertility and an
increased risk of ectopic pregnancy. Adhesions in
the pelvis may lead to chronic pain, either as a sole
feature, or in relation to menstruation or sexual
intercourse.

Early diagnosis and treatment are
essential to reduce the risk of long-term
complications.

Treatment
There should be a low threshold for empirical
treatment for PID in the absence of definitive
diagnostic criteria. The principles are:
• Antibiotic therapy.
• Contact tracing.
• Surgery.

143

Pelvic inflammatory disease
The aim of treatment is to prevent the long-term
sequelae of PID. Out patient administration of ­broadspectrum antibiotics is indicated once the diagnosis
of PID is suspected and should be started prior to
obtaining the results of microbiology specimens
(Fig. 26.2). In patient treatment with intravenous
antibiotics is indicated for more severe clinical
disease. Recommended antibiotics depend on local
patterns of microbial sensitivity.

Antibiotic therapy must include
treatment for Chlamydia because
this microorganism is most commonly
implicated in PID and its sequelae.

If a patient resumes sexual intercourse with
a partner who is infected but untreated, there is
obviously a high chance of re-infection. It is therefore
important to trace all recent contacts so that they can
be given treatment, either empirically or as a result
of microbiology results. This can be done more
effectively by referring the patient to a genitourinary
medicine clinic. The patient should avoid intercourse
until both have completed a course of treatment.
Apart from diagnostic laparoscopy, there is rarely
a need for more invasive surgery in the management
of PID. Laparoscopy or laparotomy may be necessary
to drain a tubo-ovarian abscess.

• Health education activities to increase awareness
of at-risk behaviour.
• Opportunistic screening of those at risk, e.g.
termination of pregnancy (TOP) clinic, patient
having evacuation of the retained products of
conception (ERPC).
• Knowledge of up-to-date treatment regimens
with locally agreed protocols.
• Understanding the importance of contact tracing.

Effective treatment for PID
must include contact tracing
and treatment of the patient’s
partners. Again this should be done in a sensitive
manner and confidentiality is essential at all times.

Prevention
PID and its sequelae are responsible for a

psychological. There are also considerable financial
implications, estimated at £100 million per year in
the UK. Therefore, primary prevention of the disease
is of great importance and needs the help of both the
media and health care professionals. Government
educational programmes are currently in progress
and national screening programmes are being
evaluated.

Urinary incontinence

27

Objectives
• This chapter will explain the treatments available for stress urinary incontinence and
detrusor overactivity in women
• You will also be aware of mandatory investigations especially prior to incontinence
surgery.

Incidence
Female urinary incontinence is a very common
problem, with up to one-quarter of women leaking
urine occasionally. The prevalence of regular female
urinary incontinence increases with increasing age:
• 8.5% of women under 65 years of age
• 11.6%
over 65 years

• 43.2%
over 85 years.

The most common cause of urinary incontinence is
stress urinary incontinence (SUI), followed by detrusor
overactivity (DO), which account for almost 50% and
40% of incontinent women, respectively. These and
other causes are shown in Fig. 5.1 (page 26).

Aetiology
The bladder has two major roles; the retention of
urine and expulsion of urine. Failure to retain urine,
or loss of normal voiding control, give rise to two
distinct aetiologies of incontinence.

Urinary tract infection must always be
excluded in the presence of urinary
symptoms.

slightly. Urethral closure pressure, produced by the
passive effect of elastic and collagen fibres and active
striated and smooth muscle, causes the urethra to
maintain a closed state at rest. Continence requires
a positive pressure gradient from the urethra to the
bladder. In the resting state the urethral closure
pressure is higher than the relatively low bladder
pressure and continence is maintained.
Intra-abdominal pressure is transmitted to the
bladder and raised intra-abdominal pressure, such as
during coughing or straining, increases the bladder
pressure. Intra-abdominal pressure is also transmitted
to the bladder neck and that part of the proximal
urethra which is intra-abdominal (above the pelvic
floor) maintaining the positive pressure gradient and
hence continence (Fig. 27.1B). If the bladder neck and
proximal urethra are situated below the pelvic floor
then the raised intra-abdominal pressure is no longer
transmitted to these structures, the positive pressure
gradient is lost and incontinence occurs (Fig. 27.1C).
SUI increases with increasing age as maximal
urethral closure pressure decreases. Also, older women
are more likely to be parous and post­menopausal.
SUI increases with increasing parity being asso­
ciated with the process of vaginal delivery. Prolapse
is commonly thought to be associated with SUI
although this is only true if the proximal urethra
has descended below the pelvic floor (see above).
Atrophic changes associated with the post-meno­pausal
state and vaginal surgery to cure prolapse are also
associated with SUI.

Stress urinary incontinence

Detrusor overactivity

The bladder acts as a low-pressure reservoir. As the
volume increases, the bladder pressure rises only

bladder pressure above maximal urethral closure
pressure, urinary leakage occurs.
The majority of women with DO have an idiopathic
aetiology with no demonstrable abnormality to be
found. DO can be caused by surgery to the bladder
neck and proximal urethra, especially following
surgery for SUI, during which dissection around
these structures occurs. Multiple sclerosis, autonomic
neuropathy and spinal lesions can allow uninhibited
detrusor contractions, although these women with
neurological lesions are more correctly said to have
detrusor hyperreflexia.
Increasing age and a history of nocturnal enuresis
are associated with DO and diuretics will obviously
exacerbate this condition.

Sensory urgency
Irritation of the bladder mucosa, due either to
infection (cystitis), bladder stones or tumours, can
cause sensory urgency. The aetiology of primary
vesical sensory urgency is not well understood but
accounts for almost 4% of incontinent women.

Voiding disorders
Voiding difficulties can present as acute or chronic
urinary retention with overflow incontinence.
Chronic overdistension of the bladder is likely to
exacerbate and can itself cause voiding difficulties
due to detrusor ischaemia and denervation.

146

Central, spinal and peripheral neurological
lesions can produce voiding difficulties (Fig. 27.2).
Approximately 25% of women with multiple
sclerosis will present with acute urinary retention.
Postoperative pain can cause reflex inhibition of
micturition, as can severe inflammation of the
bladder, urethra and vulva.
Drugs can cause voiding difficulties, epidural
anaesthesia in labour being the most common
encountered. Tricyclic antidepressants, anti­cho­
linergic agents, α-adrenergic agonists and ganglion
blockers can all cause voiding difficulties.
Voiding difficulties can occur secondary to
mechanical obstruction. Impaction of a pelvic
mass, for instance the gravid uterus or fibroids,
might obstruct the urethra, as can bladder polyps
or malignancy. Oedema following bladder neck

Treatment
surgery causes voiding difficulties frequently enough
to warrant prophylactic drainage of the bladder
following these procedures. Surprisingly, it is rare for
prolapse to cause retention.

Fistulae
The most common cause of fistula formation
worldwide is obstructed labour. In the UK, avoiding
prolonged labour has almost eradicated this
complication of labour. Although uncommon,
fistulae are likely to be secondary to malignancy,
surgery and radiation to the pelvis or a combination
of these. Fistulae can occur from the ureter, bladder
or urethra to the vagina.

Investigation policy
Having excluded urinary tract infection, the
mainstay of investigation is urodynamic studies.
Urodynamic studies are important for diagnosing
the causes of incontinence as symptoms are
often multiple and do not correlate well with the
underlying disorder (see Chapter 5). Cystoscopy
can be helpful by inspecting the anatomy of
the bladder and urethra and hence excluding
mechanical causes of incontinence but does not
allow assessment of their function. Bimanual pelvic
examination and pelvic ultrasound will identify
pelvic masses. Uretero-vaginal fistulae will require
radiological investigations. Infusing coloured dyes
into the bladder and observing vaginal leakage may
confirm the presence of vesico- or urethro-vaginal
fistulae.

Complications
Although incontinence itself is not life threatening,
it does cause major psychosocial problems. Changes
in lifestyle are common and occasionally symptoms
are so severe as to render the woman housebound.
Excoriation and soreness of the vulva occurs
secondary to continual dampness and chronic
urinary tract infection can lead to long-term damage
of renal function. Acute and chronic overdistension
of the bladder can cause denervation and necrosis of
the detrusor muscle thereby causing further voiding
difficulties.

27

Treatment
Treatment is determined not only by the underlying
condition but also by the severity of the symptoms.
Some women might be happy to undergo a trial of
oral medication but not major abdominal surgery for
the same degree of symptoms. Similarly, depending
on lifestyle, some women can live with their
symptoms whereas others find the same symptoms
intolerable. A sympathetic approach and detailed
counselling of the pros and cons of treatment are
essential in treating women with incontinence.

Stress urinary incontinence
Physiotherapy is the mainstay of conservative
treatment of SUI. Women are taught to use the pelvic
floor muscles to achieve better urinary control and
up to 60% will have improvement of symptoms.
Techniques include simple pelvic floor exercises or
insertion of vaginal cones, which can be retained only
by contraction of the relevant pelvic floor muscles.
Problems include return of symptoms if exercises are
stopped and a spontaneous worsening of symptoms
associated with the menopause. Oestrogen replacement
has been shown to improve the symptom of stress
incontinence in postmenopausal women although
long term use is required to maintain the effect.
The majority of women with SUI can be cured by
surgery. This is achieved by lifting and supporting
the bladder neck and urethra, thereby restoring their
intra-abdominal position. This also increases the
urethral pressure by increasing outflow resistance.
The surgical procedure of choice is the Tension
free Vaginal Tape (TVT) inserted through a small
vaginal incision over the mid-urethra. Long-term
success rates are comparable with colposuspension,
a more invasive abdominal procedure, achieving
success rates of up to 90%. In the presence of poor
detrusor activity, the bladder might not produce high
enough pressures to overcome the relative outflow
obstruction produced by abdominal procedures and
self-intermittent catheterization might be necessary.
Urodynamic studies will help to identify this group
of women, although all women undergoing surgery
for SUI should be warned of this complication.
Recently, a medical treatment for SUI has been
introduced although it is still too early to assess
the real impact on the rates of surgical intervention
for this condition. Duloxetine is an inhibitor of

147

Urinary incontinence
serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake and its’effect
appears to be by increasing the tone of the urethral
sphincter. It appears to be most effective when used
in conjunction with pelvic floor exercises.Where SUI
and DO coexist it is sensible to treat the DO in the
first instance. A significant percentage of women
will have a satisfactory enough response to simple
medical treatment and thereby avoid major surgery.

60% of women with SUI will notice an
improvement in their symptoms when
taught to perform pelvic floor exercises.

Detrusor overactivity
DO is treated medically except in the uncommon
situations where symptoms are severe enough to
warrant surgery. Behavioural and drug therapy are the
mainstay of medical treatment.

Behavioural therapy
Bladder re-training aims to increase the voiding
intervals and may be successful in up to 80% of
women with DO, although there is a significant
relapse rate. Having explained how the bladder
functions, subjects are taught to micturate by the
clock rather than desire and encouraged to increase
voiding intervals incrementally. Other techniques
include hypnotherapy and acupuncture.

Drug therapy
There is a strong placebo effect in the drug treatment
of DO. Drugs that are effective in treating DO rely on
their antimuscarinic properties (less correctly termed
‘anticholinergics’). Antimuscarinic drugs effectively
increase bladder capacity by:
• Delaying initial desire to void.
• Decreasing
the strength of detrusor contractions.

• Decreasing
the frequency of detrusor

contractions.
Although improving symptoms in many women, the
use of antimuscarinics is limited by their atropinelike side-effects (Fig. 27.3). Oxybutynin is currently
widely used, although Tolterodine has antimuscarinic
properties that are highly selective for the bladder.
Tolterodine shows good efficacy with fewer
antimuscarinic side-effects and now can be given as a

once daily formulation. Newer antimuscarinic drugs
licensed for the treatment of DO include Solifenacin
and Trospium.
Tricyclic antidepressants also have antimuscarinic
properties as well as a central sedative effect. They
are useful for incontinent women who suffer from
anxiety.

Sensory urgency
Removal of the source of bladder mucosal irritation
(infection, bladder stones, tumours) is likely to
relieve symptoms.

Voiding difficulties
The symptoms of urinary outflow obstruction,
hesitancy, poor flow and incomplete emptying, can
be treated by drug therapy but where retention has
occurred catheterization is necessary.

In general, SUI is treated
surgically (TVT) and
DO is treated medically
(antimuscarinics) which is why urodynamic
investigation is so important in the management
of urinary incontinence. A new medical treatment
has recently been introduced (Duloxetine) for the
treatment of SUI although its’ impact on the rates of
surgical intervention for SUI are not yet clear.

Drug therapy
Drugs used to treat the symptoms of voiding
difficulties are often ineffective or have limited use
due to side-effects. They work in two ways:
• Relax the urethral sphincter mechanism or.
• Produce
detrusor contractions.


27

Treatment
The selective α-blocker indoramin produces an
increase in flow rate and improvement in obstructive
symptoms by relaxing the sphincter mechanism.
Side-effects include sedation, dizziness, tachycardia
and hypotension and must be used with extreme
caution in the elderly and in anti-hypertensive users.
The
parasympathomimetics
(bethanechol,
carbachol and distigmine) exhibit muscarinic
activity which improves voiding by increasing
detrusor contraction. Side-effects include sweating,
bradycardia and intestinal colic.

Catheterization
Acute retention of urine requires catheterization. If
caused by a gravid uterus, the catheter may need to
be left in situ until the uterus is abdominally sited.
An ovarian cyst or fibroid will need to be removed
surgically, although disimpaction from the pelvis
is sometimes possible as a palliative measure.
Postoperative or postpartum retention usually
resolve with free bladder drainage for 48 hours or so.
A suprapubic catheter is preferred as residual volumes
can be measured to assess progress. If the bladder has
been overdistended then normal bladder function
is unlikely to occur immediately and free bladder
drainage is required until normal function returns.

Chronic retention may require long term
indwelling catheters which has a significant risk of
sepsis. Intermittent self-catheterization might be
more appropriate in those who are able to perform
this technique. Subclinical sepsis is common
although treatment is usually given only if symptoms
are present.

Fistula
Small fistulae might close spontaneously by
providing continuous free drainage of the bladder.
This might require stenting of the ureters or
catheterization of the bladder. If spontaneous
closure does not occur, or if the fistulae are large,
then surgical closure by a surgeon experienced in
such techniques is required.

Definition
A prolapse is the protrusion of an organ or a structure
beyond its normal anatomical site. Genital prolapse
involves weakness of the supporting structures of the
pelvic organs so that they descend from their normal
positions. The type of prolapse depends on the organ
involved (Fig. 6.1) and its position in relation to the
anterior or posterior vaginal wall (Fig. 28.1).
Descent of the uterus is graded according to the
position of the cervix on vaginal examination (Fig.
6.2):
• First degree: descent of the cervix within the vagina.
• Second
degree: descent of the cervix to the

introitus.
• Third
degree: descent of the cervix outside the

introitus (also known as a procidentia).

Genital prolapse is common and requires
a basic knowledge of pelvic anatomy to
help you understand how it develops and
how it can be repaired.

Incidence of Genital Prolapse
Genital prolapse is common. A cystourethrocoele
is the most common type, next uterine descent

and then rectocoele. The incidence increases with
increasing age. Prolapse is seen less commonly in
Afro-Caribbean women than in Caucasian women.

Pelvic Anatomy
Some knowledge of the pelvic anatomy, with
particular reference to the pelvic floor muscles,
fascia and ligaments, is necessary to understand
the development of genital prolapse. Weakness of
these tissues, either congenital or acquired, results in
descent of the pelvic viscera.

Pelvic floor muscles
The pelvic floor consists of a muscular, gutter-shaped,
forward sloping diaphragm formed by the:
• Levator ani muscles.
• Internal
obturator and piriform muscles.

• Superficial
and deep perineal muscles.

The levator ani consists of two parts, the
pubococcygeal part anteriorly and the iliococcygeal
part posteriorly and is covered by pelvic fascia. The
vagina and urethra pass through the urogenital
aperture formed by the medial border of the levator
ani. The rectum passes posteriorly with muscle fibres
from the pubic bone uniting behind the anorectal
junction. Thus, the muscles provide an indirect
support for these structures (Fig. 28.2).

Pelvic ligaments

Obstetric factors

Condensations of the pelvic fascia form strong
ligaments that act to support the upper part of the
vagina, the cervix and the uterus. Those that support
the uterus include the:

Figure 28.3 lists the factors that can cause prolapse
secondary to denervation and muscular trauma of
the pelvic floor.

• Transverse cervical or cardinal ligaments.
• Uterosacral
ligaments.

• Round
ligaments.

The transverse cervical and uterosacral ligaments
consist of smooth muscle and elastic tissue. They
attach to the pelvic side wall and the sacrum,
respectively. The round ligaments pass from the
cornu of the uterus through the inguinal canal to
the labium majus. They contain smooth muscle and
maintain flexion of the uterus with only minimal role
in support.

Aetiology of Genital
Prolapse

Congenital
Some women are born with a predisposition to
genital prolapse, which is probably secondary
to abnormal collagen production. Conditions
associated with prolapse include:
• Spina bifida.
• Connective
tissue disorder.


Acquired
Although most women with genital prolapse have a
degree of congenital predisposition, the following
factors are also important:
•
•
•
•

Obstetric
factors.

Postmenopausal
atrophy.

Chronically
raised intra-abdominal pressure.

Iatrogenic.


Postmenopausal atrophy
The incidence of prolapse increases with age. This is
due to atrophy of the connective tissues secondary to
the hypo-oestrogenic state following the menopause.

Chronically raised intra-abdominal
pressure
Any factors that raise intra-abdominal pressure in the
long term can predispose to prolapse, including:
• Intra-abdominal or pelvic tumour.
• Chronic
cough.

• Constipation.


Iatrogenic
Hysterectomy predisposes to future prolapse of the
vaginal vault. In order to remove the uterus, the
transverse cervical and uterosacral ligaments have
to be divided and the upper vaginal supports are
weakened.
Colposuspension (see Chapter 27) predisposes to
development of an enterocoele because the anterior
vaginal wall is lifted anteriorly, which in turn pulls
the upper posterior vaginal wall forwards.

Clinical Features of
Genital Prolapse

History
Most commonly, the patient presents with a history
of local discomfort or a feeling of ‘something coming
down’, as the prolapsed organ pushes into the

Fig. 28.3 Obstetric factors that may predispose to genital
prolapse

In terms of aetiology, obstetric factors
are particularly important, and if prolapse
is to be prevented, good intrapartum
management of the patient is essential.

• Prolonged labour
• Precipitate labour
• Instrumental delivery
• Fetal macrosomia
• Increasing parity

153

Genital prolapse
vagina and bulges towards the introitus. This can
be exacerbated if the intra-abdominal pressure is
increased, for example by coughing. It may interfere
with sexual function.
Uterine descent can give symptoms of backache.
However, other causes of backache must be excluded,
especially in the older patient. A procidentia causes
discomfort as it rubs on the patient’s clothing
and can cause a bloody, sometimes purulent,
discharge.
Other symptoms depend on the organ/organs
involved. Urinary symptoms occur with a cystocoele
or a cystourethrocoele, such as frequency of
micturition. The patient might notice incomplete
emptying of the bladder, which predisposes her
to urinary infection and even possibly overflow
incontinence. Stress incontinence may be present
if there is descent of the urethrovesical junction
(bladder neck) associated with a cystocoele.
A rectocoele can cause incomplete bowel
emptying. This can be relieved if the patient pushes
back the prolapse digitally.

urethral orifice, distinguishing between a cystocoele
and a cystourethrocoele. Conversely, if the anterior
vaginal wall is retracted, then an enterocoele or
rectocoele will be seen. A bulging rectocoele can be
reduced digitally to exclude an enterocoele.
Uterine descent can be assessed using the Sims’
speculum but this might be difficult in the outpatient
setting. Unless the cervix is at or protruding through
the introitus, then the degree of uterine prolapse is
better determined under general anaesthesia when
traction can be applied to the cervix. There may be
combined prolapse, most commonly uterine descent
associated with anterior vaginal wall prolapse.
If the patient has a full bladder, stress incontinence
can be demonstrated by asking her to cough.
A bimanual pelvic examination is mandatory to
exclude a pelvic mass as the cause of the prolapse.

Management
The aim is to replace the prolapsed organs to
their normal anatomical site. The options can be
categorized into:
• Prevention.
• Conservative
measures.

• Surgery.


Always remember to consider the
patient’s general health and other
conservative measures, such as HRT, as
well as the need for surgery.

Prevention
A general examination should be performed,
particularly if the patient’s medical history might
influence future management options. Abdominal
palpation is essential to exclude a mass that is causing
the pelvic organs to prolapse.
Inspection of the vulva might reveal an obvious
genital prolapse. The patient should be examined in
the left lateral position using a Sims’ speculum. With
the posterior vaginal wall retracted, any anterior wall
prolapse will be demonstrated if the patient is asked
to bear down. This can extend anteriorly as far as the

154

Because obstetric factors are most commonly
involved in the development of a genital prolapse, it
is important that damage to the supporting structures
of the pelvis is minimized. Appropriate management
of labour should include:
• Avoiding prolonged first and second stages.
• Postnatal
pelvic floor exercises.

The current decline in parity, as well as the increasing
use of caesarean section may influence the incidence
of prolapse.

Management

28

Conservative measures

Surgical treatment

Improvement in general health should aim to treat
the underlying cause of chronically raised intraabdominal pressure, including:

Surgery should be considered with a severe degree of
prolapse or if conservative management fails. Prior to
surgery it is important to know whether a woman is
sexually active, because the vagina might be narrowed
and shortened, potentially causing dyspareunia.
Surgery is not recommended in a woman who has
not yet completed her family. In pregnancy after pelvic
floor repair, Caesarean section is indicated to reduce
soft tissue trauma and the risk of recurrent prolapse.

• Weight loss.
• Stopping
smoking to reduce cough.

• Treating
constipation.


Pelvic floor exercises
Pelvic floor exercises can improve symptoms with
minor degrees of genital prolapse sufficiently to
avoid surgery. However, their use is probably more
important in prevention.

Hormone replacement therapy
In the presence of atrophic pelvic tissues, HRT can
help minor degrees of prolapse by increasing skin
collagen content. Preoperative use of HRT reduces the
friability of atrophic tissues, making tissue handling
easier during surgery.

Vaginal pessaries
The more commonly used pessary is the ring pessary,
made of inert white plastic. The diameter is measured
in millimetres and the appropriate size is assessed by
vaginal examination. The pessary is passed into the
vagina so that it sits behind the pubic bone anteriorly
and in the posterior fornix of the vagina posteriorly,
enclosing the cervix. The other type of pessary is the
shelf pessary.
The indications for the use of a vaginal pessary
include:
•
•
•
•

The
patient has not completed her family.

The
patient prefers conservative management.

The
patient is medically unfit for surgery.

While
the patient is on the waiting list for surgery.


With major degrees of prolapse, especially where the
introitus is lax and the perineal body deficient, the
pessary may not be supported enough to stay in situ.
It can also fall out if too small a size is fitted. The
main complications of a pessary are vaginal discharge
or bleeding, particularly if the pessary is not replaced
every 6 months. Granulation tissue may develop,
incarcerating the pessary, if it is not changed regularly.
If the pessary is too large, it will cause discomfort and
may ulcerate the vaginal walls.

Anterior colporrhaphy
This operation, also known as an anterior repair,
is indicated for the repair of a cystocoele or a
cystourethrocoele. A portion of redundant anterior
vaginal wall mucosa is excised and the exposed fascia
is plicated to support the bladder. Post-operatively,
there is a risk of worsening urinary symptoms.

Posterior colporrhaphy
Also known as a posterior repair, this operation is
used to repair a rectocoele or a rectocoele combined
with an enterocoele. Using a similar technique to the
operation described above, a triangle of posterior
vaginal wall mucosa – its apex behind the cervix and
the base at the introitus – is removed. The underlying
levator ani muscles are plicated to support the
perineum. If an enterocoele is present, the pouch
of Douglas is opened and the enterocoele sac of
redundant peritoneum is excised.

Vaginal hysterectomy
This operation is performed for uterine prolapse, as
well as for other gynaecological pathology. It can be
combined with one or both of the operations above.

Manchester repair (Fothergill procedure)
This operation is rarely performed for uterine
prolapse nowadays. It consists of amputation of the
cervix and then apposing the cardinal ligaments to
lift the uterus, followed by anterior and posterior
colporrhaphy if necessary. It may be offered to a
woman who wants to preserve the uterus.

Sacrospinous fixation
To treat the prolapsed vaginal vault, the apex is
fixed to sacrospinous ligament using a transvaginal

155

Genital prolapse
approach. This ligament runs from the ischial spine
to the lower lateral aspect of the sacrum. Care must
be taken to avoid the pudendal nerve and vessels, as
well as the sacral plexus and the sciatic nerve.

Sacral colpopexy
This abdominal procedure involves suspending the
vaginal vault from the sacrum or from the sacral
promontory, using either strips of fascia or synthetic
mesh. The main complications are intraoperative
haemorrhage and infection of the mesh.
New procedures are currently being developed
using synthetic mesh to relieve prolapsed vaginal
walls or the vaginal vault. At present, follow-up data
regarding success rates is limited.

Understand the differences in the definitions that apply to the menopause
List the short-term symptoms of the menopause
List the longer term sequelae of the menopause
Understand the indications for the different hormonal combinations of HRT
Describe the routes of administration of HRT
Discuss with a woman the risks and benefits of commencing HRT.

Definitions
The term ‘menopause’ specifically refers to the last
menstrual bleed that a woman experiences. It is a
retrospective diagnosis, generally considered to have
occurred after 1 year of amenorrhoea. The range of
age at menopause is 45 to 55 years, with an average
of 51 years; factors that affect this are cigarette
smoking, which lowers the age, and an inherited
genetic predisposition. A premature menopause is
one that occurs before the age of 45 years. This can
occur naturally, by surgery (bilateral oophorectomy),
by chemotherapy or radiotherapy.
The term ‘climacteric’ is used to describe the
perimenopausal period, that is, the transitional phase
around the time of a woman’s last menstrual bleed
when endocrine changes occur as ovarian follicular
activity ceases.
With the average life expectancy of women today
at 78 years, a woman can spend up to a third of her
life in the postmenopausal phase. Therefore, an
understanding of the physiological and psychological
changes that take place is important.

Pathophysiology
The total number of oocytes is maximum at 20 weeks
of in utero fetal development and progressively
decreases to about 750 000 at the time of birth.
From childhood through to adult life, the number

of oocytes becomes further depleted by ovulation
and atresia. Eventually, at the time of the climacteric,
the remaining oocytes are increasingly resistant to
stimulation by the gonadotrophins FSH and LH,
and the Graafian follicles that form do not secrete
sufficient oestrogen and progesterone to cause regular
menstruation.
The endocrine changes that occur at the climacteric
are:
• Hypothalamic–pituitary hyperactivity
(raised FSH and later LH).
• Decreased or absent progesterone levels.
• Unopposed oestrogen secretion.
These changes result in dysfunctional uterine bleeding
secondary to anovulatory cycles as the menopause
approaches. In time, insufficient follicles develop
with subsequent inadequate oestrogen to stimulate
the endometrium; therefore menstruation ceases.

Clinical Features of the
Menopause
Fig. 29.1 illustrates the clinical features of the
menopause.

Immediate symptoms
The more short-term symptoms associated with
the climacteric can begin prior to the menopause
(Fig. 29.2).

Fig. 29.2 The immediate effects of the menopause
• Vasomotor symptoms
• End-organ atrophy
• Psychological symptoms

Vasomotor symptoms
These include those characteristically associated with
the menopause: hot flushes and night sweats, which
are the result of poor peripheral vascular control
secondary to oestrogen deficiency. Night sweats
can result in insomnia, with lethargy and loss of
concentration during the day.

End-organ atrophy
The genital tract and the lower urinary tract have the
same embryological origin and thus both systems
will be affected by loss of oestrogen.
The vulva and vagina become atrophic and the
thinner epithelium is more susceptible to infection
or trauma.

158

Vaginal dryness causes dyspareunia, which can
contribute to the psychosexual symptoms that are
another factor associated with the menopause.
The supporting tissues of the pelvic organs (see
Chapter 27) become thinner and weaker, resulting
in the development of vaginal and uterine prolapse.
The epithelium of the urethra and the trigone also
become atrophic, with weakening of the connective
and elastic tissue of the lower urinary tract. Thus,
post-menopausal women may complain of dysuria,
frequency and urgency.

Psychological symptoms
These include depression, irritability, poor memory
and loss of libido, which are particularly common
prior to the woman’s last period. It is thought
that fluctuating hormone levels are important,
as opposed to simply low hormone levels. Social
and environmental factors can play a part in these
symptoms but should not necessarily be taken as the
diagnosis.

Management

Long-term symptoms
With an increasingly elderly population, the longterm consequences of the menopause carry a high
morbidity and mortality, as well as being important
social and economic factors.

Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a skeletal disease characterized by
low bone mass and disruption of the normal bone
architecture; this results in increased bone fragility
and thus susceptibility to fractures. Bone mass in
both men and women reaches a peak at 30–40 years
of age and then starts to decline. However, in women,
there is an acceleration in this decline immediately
after the menopause. As a result, this increased bone
loss, combined with the lower peak bone mass prior
to the menopause, predisposes women to a greater
risk of fracture compared with men.
Postmenopausal osteoporosis is caused by
changes in bone remodelling, such that the rate
of osteoclast bone resorption exceeding that of
osteoblast bone formation. Other factors can
contribute to this (Fig. 29.3), including – in
particular – a family history of osteoporosis. It is
important that postmenopausal women with any
of these associated risk factors should be counselled
about treatment such as hormone replacement
therapy to reduce their risk of fractures. The three
most common sites for fractures in this group are
the spine, the hip and the distal radius. In the UK,
130 000 vertebral fractures and over 50 000 hip
fractures occur each year.

Cardiovascular disease
Ischaemic heart disease is about five times less
common in a premenopausal woman than in a man.
However, following the menopause, the incidence

of osteoporosis

• Nulliparity
• Late menarche and/or early menopause

29

rises so that by the age of 70, there is no longer any sex
difference. This is thought to be caused by a shift in
lipoprotein metabolism with an increase in the serum
LDL level, so that the HDL:LDL ratio is altered.
A similar pattern is seen in the incidence of
strokes (cerebrovascular accidents). At the time of
the menopause, there is a small rise compared with
premenopausal women, but this is much less marked
than in ischaemic heart disease.

Management

History
Presenting symptoms include:
•
•
•
•
•

Vasomotor symptoms and mood changes.
Menstrual history.
Sexual history including contraception.
Gynaecological history including recent smear.
Family history, in particular of osteoporosis.

Examination
This should include blood pressure and a breast
examination, as well as abdominal and pelvic
examination.

Investigations
Plasma gonadotrophins and oestrogen levels vary
markedly in the climacteric; thus, diagnosis of the
menopause is usually made on clinical grounds,
although it is confirmed by a raised serum FSH
concentration.
Other investigations should be performed
according to the patient’s age and presenting
symptoms including:
•
•
•
•
•

Cervical smear.
Mammogram.
Pelvic ultrasound.
Endometrial sampling.
Bone mineral density measurement.

Treatment
General measures include:
• Diet, exercise and weight control.
• Treat any medical condition such as hypertension
or diabetes.
• Psychological support if appropriate.

159

The menopause

Hormone replacement therapy
Both the immediate and the long-term effects of
the menopause have been shown to be improved
by administering oestrogen and progesterone or
progestogen (synthetic progesterone). Oestrogen
therapy has been proven to improve the bone
mineralization of osteoporosis and so reduce
substantially the risk of fractures. With respect to
cholesterol metabolism and the associated risk of
vascular disease, giving oral oestrogen lowers total
cholesterol and LDL levels and raises the HDL
fraction. This effect might be negated somewhat by
the concomitant administration of progesterone.

If the patient has a uterus, she needs a
hormone replacement therapy with both
oestrogen and progesterone.

All patients should be fully informed about the
benefits and risks of HRT, so that they can decide
whether to commence treatment. In particular,
women in the menopause who are below 45
years of age and women with osteoporosis or
with a combination of risk factors for the disease
must discuss HRT thoroughly. Fig. 29.4 lists the
contraindications to HRT. Particular controversy
exists over the risk of HRT in the development of
breast cancer. There appears to be a slightly increased
risk in women using combined hormone therapy
after five years of use but this risk is counterbalanced
in the short term by the improvements in quality of
life and in the long term by osteoporosis prophylaxis.

Fig. 29.4 Contraindications to hormone replacement
therapy
• Endometrial carcinoma
• Breast carcinoma
• Undiagnosed vaginal bleeding
• Undiagnosed breast lump
• Suspected pregnancy
• Liver disease with impaired liver function
• Previous thromboembolic disease associated with
hormonal contraception, pregnancy or oestrogen
replacement

160

Giving a woman with an intact uterus long-term
unopposed oestrogen will cause stimulation of the
endometrium, which puts her at risk of endometrial
hyperplasia or even endometrial carcinoma. She must
therefore also be given concomitant progesterone or
progestogen therapy to prevent this. However, recent
data suggest that women using oestrogen alone have
a lower risk of breast cancer with long term usage.
It is therefore logical to use the minimum effective
dose of progesterone or progestogen to protect the
endometrium.
The next decision in prescribing is whether the
patient finds a monthly withdrawal bleed acceptable.
If she does, then she can be given oestrogen with
cyclical progesterone to protect the uterus. If she
prefers not to have a regular bleed and has not had
any bleeding for more than 1 year, the woman might
be suitable for continuous combined oestrogen and
progesterone therapy, which should avoid monthly
bleeds. Lower starting doses of oestrogen and
progestogen are now recommended as these appear
to maintain benefits whilst minimizing side effects
and risks.

Patient choice is important;
patient compliance can
be difficult, especially if a
woman does not want regular withdrawal bleeds or
is asymptomatic and so she must be fully counselled
about her options.

Finally, the route of administration of the
treatment must be discussed with the patient.
Duration of therapy should be judged by at least
annual re-evaluation of risks and benefits on an
individual basis. (Fig. 29.5).

Non-hormonal drug treatment
Symptom control
An alternative to HRT might be recommended if there
are contraindications to HRT such as a history of
breast cancer or thromboembolic disease. Clonidine
is a central α-adrenergic stimulator that has been
used in the past for the treatment of hot flushes and
night sweats. More recently, selective serotonin and

that these alternatives may only relieve symptoms by
approximately 60% as compared to 80–90% with
traditional HRT.
Osteoporosis prophylaxis/treatment
HRT is currently regarded as second line treatment
for osteoporosis prophylaxis and treatment in older
women because of concerns of increased risks of
some conditions such as breast cancer with long
term usage. However, the menopause societies still
recommend that HRT be used as first line in younger
postmenopausal women (<55 years) and in early
menopause. The alternative options include:
• Bisphosphonates, e.g. alendronate, ibandronate
etc., are non hormonal agents which prevent the
breakdown of bone and thus reduce the risk of
fractures. These agents can be administered on a
daily, weekly, monthly or annual basis.

• Strontium Ranlelate which is a dual-action bone
agent as it not only prevents the breakdown of bone
but also encourages the formation of new bone.
• Raloxifene is a selective oestrogen receptor
modulator (SERM) with a similar structure to
tamoxifen, a drug used to treat breast cancer. It
has no effect on menopausal symptoms such
as hot flushes but offers long-term protection
against osteoporosis.
All women should be advised to take regular weight
bearing exercise and to use calcium and vitamin D if
their diet is not well balanced. They should also be
given advice about stopping smoking.

Objectives
This chapter explains the management of the commoner causes of subfertility:
• You should understand the role of clomiphene and how to monitor its use
• Be aware of the early pregnancy complications associated with tubal surgery
• Understand the technique of IVF and know the factors affecting the success rate.

If a cause for a couple’s subfertility is discovered (see
Chapter 8), treatment can be aimed at the problem,
but many couples suffer unexplained subfertility.
They can still be helped by the methods described
below.

Anovulation
The absence of ovulation should be suspected if a
woman’s cycle is irregular. It is confirmed if there
is no rise of progesterone in the luteal phase of the
cycle. If the woman is not ovulating:
• Maximize general health (correct thyroid disease,
diabetes, etc.).
• Consider BMI (ovulation is less likely at the
extremes of weight).
• Discuss psychological stress levels.
• Consider clomiphene (see below) to induce
ovulation.

The wide availability of ovulation kits
may increase the psychological stress of
timed intercourse and actually be counter
productive. There is little evidence that use
of temperature charts improves conception rates.

Clomiphene is an antioestrogen that occupies
oestrogen receptors in the hypothalamus, thereby
increasing GnRH release, which leads to increased

release of LH and FSH. This induces follicular
development and ovulation. It is given on days 2–6 of
the cycle. Ovulation should be confirmed by a raised
progesterone level. If ovulation does not occur the
dose can be increased at the next cycle.
The patient must be warned of the risk of multiple
pregnancy. Some units arrange to scan the ovaries
during the cycle and advise couples to use barrier
contraception if multiple follicles are seen.

Couples who are subfertile
may not understand why
they are warned about the
risk of multiple pregnancy with ovarian stimulation.
They may actually view multiple pregnancy as an
advantage. It is important to explain that multiple
pregnancies have a higher overall complication
rate including miscarriage, three times the rate of
cerebral palsy, and five times the perinatal mortality
rate. The mother herself is more likely to suffer from
hyperemesis, pre-eclampsia and premature labour.

Uterine and Pelvic Problems
• Submucous fibroids, polyps and uterine septae,
all distort the uterine cavity. They impair fertility
and may cause miscarriage. They should be
removed prior to in vitro fertilization (IVF)
to maximize the chances of success.

163

Subfertility
• Hydrosalpinges reduce the implantation rate and
can be removed or drained for this reason prior
to IVF.
• Surgical treatment of even mild endometriosis
(i.e. diathermy or laser at time of laparoscopy) has
been shown to improve fertility in the short term.

Tubal Problems
Tubal problems can be diagnosed on hysterosal­
pingogram but blocked tubes are usually confirmed
at laparoscopy, using the dye test. If the tubes are not
patent the choice is between tubal surgery and IVF.

Tubal surgery
Some centres perform tubal surgery, usually using
microsurgical techniques, for selected patients.
The patient must be aware that her risk of ectopic
pregnancy will be increased as the tubes are scarred.
Success rates vary, with the best results being seen
where tubal damage was proximal. Distal damage can
be treated by laparoscopic salpingostomy. Midtubal
damage has the poorest prognosis, unless it is due
to Filshie clip sterilization, in which case there is a
relatively better outcome.

In vitro fertilization
Some patients are referred directly for IVF. Success
of IVF is decreased by advancing age and should be

considered early in women who are over 35 and have
tubal disease. IVF involves several steps:
• Down-regulation of the woman’s own hormones
using nafarelin, goserelin or buserelin, which
are GnRH agonists. They initially stimulate
LH and FSH but then cause down-regulation,
leading to reduction in oestrogen production and
‘menopausal’ side-effects. These drugs are given
by nasal spray or subcutaneous injection.
• Induction of multiple follicular development
using gonadotrophins such as human
menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG), which
contains FSH and LH and is prepared from the
urine of menopausal women, hCG, which is
obtained from the urine of pregnant women and
has a similar action to LH, or recombinant FSH,
an expensive but pure form of FSH.
• Egg collection: performed transvaginally using
ultrasound, under sedation (Fig. 30.1).
• Sperm preparation.
• In vitro fertilization of the oocytes with sperm.
• Transfer of the healthy embryos (maximum of
two) back into the uterine cavity (Fig. 30.2).
New techniques making IVF more specialized are
being developed all the time. If a couple is affected
by a hereditary disorder that can be detected using
gene probes, the embryos can be subjected to
preimplantation diagnosis. Cells from each embryo
are removed and analysed so that only unaffected
embryos are replaced. In some cases of genetic
abnormality or advanced maternal age, eggs can be

collected from a healthy donor, then mixed with the
partner’s sperm in vitro. New techniques of ‘assisted
hatching’, where the zona pellucida of the embryo is
breached before reimplantation, are said to improve
the chances of successful implantation.

Male Infertility
If the semen analysis is persistently abnormal despite
advice regarding loose underwear and reduction of
alcohol and nicotine intake, assisted fertility can be
considered. Intrauterine insemination may be tried
before IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)
because it is less invasive.

Intrauterine insemination
Intrauterine insemination (IUI) usually involves
inducing follicular development and ovulation in the
woman as for IVF. The process can be carried out with
spontaneous ovulation but the success rate is lower.
However, the incidence of multiple pregnancy is
also lower. Thirty-six hours after ovulation, prepared
sperm is placed into the uterine cavity using an
intrauterine catheter.
Donor insemination (DI) is an option where the
partner’s sperm is of poor quality. Its use has fallen
since the advent of ICSI (see below), but ICSI is not
always successful.

has revolutionized treatment for couples where
the partner’s sperm count is very low or showing
increased abnormal forms. If there are no sperm in
the semen at all (due to obstruction or to congenital
absence of the vas) sperm can sometimes be extracted
from the vas, the epididymis, or even from a testicular
biopsy. It has recently been suggested that spermatids
(i.e. immature spermatozoa) could be used, but at
present this has not been licensed by the Human
Fertilization and Embryology Authority (HFEA).

The Human Fertilisation and Embryology
Authority (HFEA) was established in 1991
and regulates all centres in the UK that
offer assisted conception. Their website
www.HFEA.gov.uk is an excellent source of advice
and information for couples.

Intracytoplasmic sperm
injection (ICSI)
ICSI is an advanced form of IVF where one sperm
is injected into the egg (Fig. 30.3). This technique

Fig. 30.3 Sperm injection into an egg.

165

Subfertility

Surgical options for male
subfertility
If the sperm count is suboptimal because of
epididymal blockage, surgery can be performed to
restore patency. If a varicocoele is present this can
be repaired. This has not been proven conclusively
to improve spermatogenesis but it is known that
the incidence of varicocoele in the male partner of
couples with subfertility is 40% compared with 15%
in the general population.

Unexplained Subfertility
Couples with unexplained subfertility are helped by
IUI with controlled ovarian stimulation, and if this
is unsuccessful may try IVF.

Ovarian Hyperstimulation
Syndrome
Gonadotrophin therapy can lead to ovarian
hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which is a
serious condition in which the ovaries are enlarged
with cysts, related to multiple follicular development.
In its mild form the patient suffers only mild
abdominal discomfort. In worse cases, however,
nausea and vomiting develop, there is pronounced,
painful abdominal distension, and fluid shifts
resulting in ascites and pleural effusions. Hepatorenal
failure and adult respiratory distress syndrome

166

(ARDS) can ensue and the patient is at greatly
increased risk of thromboembolism. Hospitalization
and careful fluid balance are necessary. There is no
real treatment for OHSS, which is why its prevention
by careful ultrasound monitoring of the ovaries
and serial blood tests for serum oestradiol is so
important.

Prognosis for the Subfertile
Couple
As a result of developments in infertility treatment,
couples have a 30% greater chance of a live birth than
they did at the beginning of the 1990s. However, the
reality is that the majority of couples undergoing
a cycle of fertility treatment will not have a baby,
which is why the role of the specialist counsellor is
so important.
IUI and DI with ovarian stimulation give around
a 9.5% chance of live birth per treatment cycle. The
results are age dependent.
IVF success rates (i.e. live birth) are around 15–
20%. If the mother is under 30 the results are better;
once over 35 there is a marked decrease, and over 40
the chance is around 12%. ICSI improves the chances
of live birth to around 21%.

Introduction
The ideal contraceptive is one that is 100% effective,
with no side-effects, is readily reversible and does not
need medical supervision; this does not exist. Hence
it is important that the doctor assesses the patient’s
requirements at the particular time in her life that she
requests contraception, and reviews the advantages
and disadvantages so that the patient can make an
informed choice (see Crash Course in Endocrinology).

Informed choice regarding the
method of contraception used
by each individual patient is
important. It is essential to take a sexual history in a
sensitive, non-judgemental way and to check for any
medical contraindications that may be relevant.

Consideration must be given to a woman’s risk
of sexually transmitted infections (STI), her future
fertility needs and, in some cases, her medical history.
The effectiveness of a particular method can be
measured by the number of unwanted pregnancies
that occur during 100 women years of exposure;
this is known as the Pearl Index. Fig. 31.1 shows
effectiveness in terms of percentage.

Natural Family Planning
Methods

Rhythm method
The rhythm method involves predicting the fertile
and infertile times of the menstrual cycle, by using
several fertility indicators:
• A menstrual calendar.
• Charting the basal body temperature,
which rises 0.2–0.4°C when
progesterone is released from the
corpus luteum.
• Recognizing changes in cervical mucus.
• An ovulation predictor kit, e.g. Persona™.

Advantages
This method has no side effects and does not involve
hormones. It might be useful if other methods are
unacceptable to the couple, such as with certain
religious groups or because of unwanted sideeffects.

Disadvantages
The method relies on a regular menstrual cycle,
lengthy instruction and commitment. The couple may
wish to avoid sex or use a condom at fertile times of
the cycle.

Diaphragm

4-8 in 100 pregnancies in 1 year

Coitus interruptus
Advantages
Still widely practised, this method is free and without
side-effects.

Disadvantages
The failure rate is high due to variable ejaculatory
control and the fact that pre-ejaculatory fluid contains
some sperm. There is no protection against STIs.

Barrier Methods
These methods include the male condom and, for
women, the diaphragm, the cervical cap and the
female condom. Their effectiveness increases with
concomitant use of a spermicide such as nonoxynol-9,
which alters sperm membrane permeability resulting in
sperm death (use of spermicides alone as contraception
is not recommended).

Advantages
When used properly, these are effective, free from sideeffects and widely available. They offer protection
against STIs, in particular the male condom, which
protects against HIV.

Hormonal Contraception

Combined oral contraceptive pill
Since their introduction in 1961, various combi­nations
of different oestrogens and progestogens have been used
to prevent pregnancy. Combined oral contraceptive pills
(COCP) have the following modes of action:
• Inhibiting ovulation by:
• Inhibiting FSH release.
• Preventing follicular ripening.
• Preventing the LH surge.
• Thinning the endometrium.
• Thickening the cervical mucus to prevent sperm
reaching the egg.

Contraindications

Disadvantages
They must be applied before penetration (which can

checked regularly by a trained professional. In all
these methods, effectiveness is dependent on correct
use and sustained motivation.

31

Hormonal contraception

Advantages

Disadvantages

This method is reliable if taken correctly, convenient
and not intercourse related. Its use reduces dysme­
norrhoea, menorrhagia and premenstrual syndrome
(PMS) symptoms. It also controls functional ovarian
cysts and is associated with a reduced incidence of
carcinoma of the ovary and endometrium.

Efficacy is reduced if the time of pill-taking is delayed
by more than 3 hours. The main problem is a change
in menstrual pattern, with spotting or breakthrough
bleeding that does not settle despite continued use. There
is a small increase in the risk of ectopic pregnancy.

Disadvantages
The main risks of the COCP are thromboembolism
and cardiovascular complications. These are exacer­
bated by:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Age.
Obesity.
Cigarette smoking.
Diabetes.
Hypertension.
Familial hyperlipidaemia.

Other more minor side-effects include weight gain,
decreased libido, breast discomfort, mood disturbance
and breakthrough bleeding. The effectiveness of the
COCP is limited by some antibiotics, hepatic-enzymeinducing drugs and by vomiting and diarrhoea. Use is
associated with an increase in cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia and carcinoma of the cervix. This may be
because of the increased risk of exposure to STIs with
a non-barrier method of contraception. The effect on
breast cancer is uncertain.
The COCP should be discontinued 4 weeks
before major surgery because of the risk of venous
thromboembolism. Heparin prophylaxis may still
be necessary depending on other risk factors such as
immobility or BMI ≥30. Alternative contraception
should be advised.

Progesterone-only pill
Although slightly less effective than the COCP, the
progesterone-only pill (POP) is used in women in
whom oestrogens are contra-indicated or who cannot
tolerate the side-effects. This includes women aged
over 35 who smoke and those who are breast-feeding.
The mode of action differs from the COCP in that
ovulation is suppressed in only 50–60% of cycles,
but with similar changes in cervical mucus and in the
endometrium, as well as reduced tubal motility.

Advantages
Without oestrogen, few serious side-effects occur.

Injectable progestogens
(Depo-provera)
Intramuscular injections of medroxyprogesterone acetate
given every 3 months ensure that high-dose progestogen
is gradually released into the circulation and inhibits
ovulation; it is almost as effective as the COCP.

Advantages
This method of contraception is highly effective and
is not intercourse related. It also does not require
daily motivation.

Disadvantages
• Because it is injected, it cannot be removed and
any side-effects must be tolerated for 3 months.
• Most women become amenorrhoeic but heavy,
unpredictable bleeding patterns can sometimes
occur.
• Being a slow-release depot preparation, there might
be a delay in return to fertility of 12 to 18 months.
• Prolonged use is associated with an increased risk
of osteoporosis.
• Other side effects include headache, spotty skin,
mood changes and breast tenderness.

Progestogen implant (Implanon)
This is an inert flexible tube, 2–3 cm in length, that
is inserted subdermally, usually under the skin of
the upper arm under local anaesthetic. It releases the
hormone progesterone.

Advantages
Its effects last for 3 years but the device can be taken out
any time. It has the advantage over the depo preparation
of a quicker return to normal fertility and regular
menses once discontinued. It is not intercourse-related.

Disadvantages
Periods can be irregular and some women gain weight.
Training is needed for insertion using a local anaesthetic
and tenderness, bruising and swelling may occur.

169

Contraception, sterilization and unwanted pregnancy

Intrauterine Contraceptive
Devices (IUCD) and MIRENA
Intrauterine System (IUS)

such as treating menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea.
It should also be considered as an alternative to
sterilization since it has at least a similar success
rate.

Insertion of one of a variety of synthetic devices
into the uterine cavity (Fig.31.3) is likely to ensure
that blastocyst implantation is prevented. There
is also some foreign body reaction to the IUCD in
the endometrium, resulting in altered cell numbers
and fluid compositions, which may affect gamete
viability. There may also be changes in the cervical
mucus which reduce sperm penetration. The latter
effects are particularly applicable to the progestogencontaining MIRENA IUS which also acts to thin the
endometrium.

Disadvantages

Contraindications
Fig.31.4 lists the contraindications to IUCD/IUS use.

Advantages
Once inserted by a trained operator, the IUCD/IUS
is effective immediately. It can remain in place for
3 to 5 years and its effect on preventing conception
is almost immediately reversible when removed.
The MIRENA IUS has the extra advantages related
to local secretion of progestogen, which acts on
the endometrium; this results in amenorrhoea in
up to 85% of patients at 6 months. Hence this type
of system has various gynaecological indications,

Infection.
Uterine perforation.
Expulsion of IUCD/IUS.
Menorrhagia (except with MIRENA) and/or
abdominal pain.
• Ectopic pregnancy.
•
•
•
•

Introduction of infection at the time of insertion
of the IUCD/IUS is one of the main risk factors for
using this form of contraception. For this reason, it
is advisable to exclude Chlamydia infection and/
or give prophylactic antibiotics. The possibility of
developing PID means that an IUCD/IUS is less
commonly used in nulliparous women, especially if
they have multiple partners.
Other disadvantages that the patient should be
told about include risk of uterine perforation at
the time of coil insertion or possibly at a later date.
The woman should be taught to check that she can
feel the threads of the coil to ensure that it has not
fallen out. If either of these situations arises, attempts
to locate the IUCD/IUS should be made by X-ray,
ultrasound and possibly laparoscopy.
The most common reasons for a patient requesting
removal of the IUCD are menorrhagia and abdominal

pain; these symptoms are much less common with
a Mirena™ than with other IUCDs. If a pregnancy
does occur with a coil in situ, the risk of an ectopic
pregnancy is higher than with other forms of
contraception.

Female Sterilization
Sterilization is a permanent way of preventing
pregnancy, involving having an operation. The
more commonly used techniques include the
application of Falope rings or Filshie clips to each
tube laparoscopically as a day-case procedure. At
laparotomy, a modified Pomeroy tubal ligation
is usually performed, for example at caesarean
section. Hysteroscopic techniques inserting
microcoils into the Fallopian tubes are not yet in
common use.

Counselling
Sterilization should be regarded as an irreversible
procedure and therefore the patient must be sure
that she has completed her family and that she has
considered all other methods of contraception.
These issues are particularly emotive if the patient
makes the request at the time of termination of
pregnancy or caesarean section. Particularly in a
younger woman, under the age of 30, the MIRENA
IUS should be considered since it has a similar rate
of success but is reversible and avoids the need for
surgery.
Sterilization has a lifetime failure rate of about
1 in 200; this might be due to failure to exclude
pregnancy preoperatively or incorrect application
of a clip. If a pregnancy does occur, the risk of an
ectopic pregnancy is higher than other forms of
contraception.

Male Sterilization
Compared to female sterilization, a vasectomy is a
relatively easy operation, avoiding the risks of a general
anaesthetic. The vas deferens is ligated via bilateral
incisions in the scrotum under local anaesthesia.
Another method of contraception must be used until
two azospermic samples have been obtained 3 and 4
months after the procedure. The failure rate is much
lower than for the female operation.

Contraception and
Breastfeeding
Breastfeeding can act as a very effective contraceptive
when a woman is fully breastfeeding a baby under
6 months of age. However, in the UK, where
contraception is free and readily available, it should not
be relied upon. Depending on the woman’s medical
history, the POP or an IUCD/IUS may be appropriate.

Postcoital Contraception
(Emergency Contraception)
Since 1999, Levonelle has superceded the Yuzpe
method as the choice for emergency contraception and
is currently available over the counter in the UK. Within
72 hours of unprotected intercourse or with a failed
method of contraception, levonorgestrel, a synthetic
progestogen, 1.5 mg, is taken as a single dose.
The endometrium is made unfavourable for
implantation and there is interference with normal
corpus luteum function. If it is taken before the
preovulation oestrogen surge, ovulation can be
inhibited. Vomiting occurs in approx 1% of patients
and necessitates repeat treatment if it occurs within
2 hours of ingestion. The failure rate is approx
1%, being more effective when taken as close as
possible to the episode of unprotected intercourse.
Counselling is essential so that the patient
understands the implications of the failure rate.
The other method of emergency contraception
is to insert an IUCD within 5 days of unprotected
intercourse (see above for more details). It can be
removed after the patient’s next period or left in situ to
provide ongoing contraception. The patient ensures she
is followed up, both to check that she has a period and
also to decide on future long-term contraception.

171

Contraception, sterilization and unwanted pregnancy

Postcoital or emergency contraception is
not for routine use:
• High-dose oral progestogen
contraceptive Levonelle – 1 dose within 72 hours.
• Insert an intrauterine contraceptive device within
5 days.

Termination of Pregnancy
Since the Abortion Act of 1967 (amended in 1991 to
reduce the upper limit of gestation from 28 weeks to
24 weeks), termination of pregnancy has been legal in
England, Scotland and Wales. Two registered medical
practitioners must agree on one of five circumstances
relevant to the individual patient; this is most
commonly clause C, which states that continuing
the pregnancy involves greater risk to the woman’s
physical or mental health than termination.

Surgical methods
Up to 12 weeks of pregnancy, vacuum aspiration
is the most commonly used method. Preoperative
prostaglandin to ripen the cervix is often used,
especially in nulliparous women, followed by cervical
dilatation and evacuation of the uterus using a plastic
cannula.
After 12 weeks, dilatation and evacuation can be
used; the uterine contents must be crushed prior to
curettage. It is essential to ascertain the patient’s blood
group for anti-D administration, if she is Rhesus
negative.

Medical methods
In the first trimester, medical termination is offered
with up to 63 days of amenorrhoea. Mifepristone, an
antiprogesterone is given orally 36–48 hours before

172

vaginal insertion of a prostaglandin E1 analogue
pessary; complete abortion occurs in 95% of patients.
In the second trimester, mifepristone is followed
again by synthetic prostaglandin pessaries, placed in
the posterior fornix every 3–4 hours. At any gestation,
incomplete abortion may occur and surgical
evacuation must be performed.

Counselling
Alternatives to abortion should be discussed with
the woman, including support if she continues the
pregnancy or adoption. If she decides to proceed
with the termination, the appropriate method
must be agreed. This may depend on ultrasound
confirmation of the patient’s last menstrual period.
Future contraception should be arranged. Screening
and/or prophylaxis should be offered for Chlamydia
infection. The offer of psychological counselling may
be appropriate.

Complications
These are generally more common with the surgical
methods.
• Infection: screen for chlamydia preoperatively
and/or give prophylactic antibiotics including
cover for anaerobic infection.
• Trauma: to cervix or uterus including perforation
(cervical incompetence only usually occurs with
repeated procedures).
• Haemorrhage: might be secondary to the above
or the result of incomplete evacuation.
• Retained products of conception and re-doing
the procedure.

Objectives
• You will understand the definition of recurrent miscarriage and how to investigate this
condition
• You will understand the biochemical management of a suspected ectopic pregnancy
and how to treat if confirmed
• The genetic differences between a partial and complete molar pregnancy will be
discussed.

Miscarriage
Miscarriage is the most common complication of
pregnancy and will be experienced by 1 in 4 women
at some point in their lives. It is defined as the
spontaneous loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks.

Aetiology
It is often difficult to identify the cause of a
miscarriage but factors that have contributed can be
noted. These include:
• Fetal abnormality: 50% of miscarried fetuses
are genetically (e.g. trisomy, monosomy) or
structurally (e.g. neural tube defect) abnormal.
Multiple pregnancies are more likely to be
affected in these ways.
• Infection: Toxoplasma species, the rubella virus,
tuberculosis, Listeria species, malaria, Salmonella
species and cytomegalovirus are just a few of the
potential causes. Bacterial vaginosis, where there
is a change in the natural flora of the vagina, has
been linked to second trimester miscarriage.
• Maternal age: the miscarriage rate begins to
increase when the mother reaches the age of 35.

• Abnormal uterine cavity: the presence of an
intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD or
‘coil’), submucous fibroids, a congenital septum
or adhesions (Ashermann’s syndrome).
• Maternal illness, including Wilson’s disease,
poorly controlled diabetes, thyroid or renal
disease.
• Intervention: e.g. amniocentesis, chorionic villus
sampling.
• Antiphospholipid antibodies and cervical
weakness (‘incompetence’) can result in second
trimester loss (see the section ‘Recurrent
miscarriage’, below).
Investigation of the cause of miscarriage is usually
delayed until the woman has had three consecutive
miscarriages. This affects 1% of couples. (see the
section ‘Recurrent miscarriage’, below).

Investigation of miscarriage
Ultrasound is used to aid diagnosis where women
present with bleeding and the os is closed on
examination. If the os is open a miscarriage is
inevitable and a scan is unnecessary, but is sometimes
performed at the request of the patient.

Management of miscarriage
Risks of miscarriage in relation
to mother’s age:
under 35: 6.5%
5–40:
15%
over 40:
23%

Once the fetus has died, the uterus will expel the
products of conception. This process can take some
weeks if left to happen spontaneously. Because of the
fear of infection of retained products women have
traditionally been advised to have a surgical evacuation
to empty the uterus (a procedure that many women
still think of as a ‘D&C’). Studies comparing the

173

Early pregnancy failure
operative route with expectant management have now
confirmed no difference in infection rates. Evacuation
of retained products of conception (ERPC) is a minor
operation that can be performed as a day case; the
cervix is dilated to allow suction or sharp curettage.
The pregnant uterus is easily perforated, so curettage
must be gentle. Syntocinon can be given intravenously
during the procedure to encourage uterine contraction
and to minimize blood loss. Products of conception
are sent for histology after maternal consent is
obtained.
If the patient is offered the choice of expectant
management she should be booked for follow-up
appointment and scan to confirm that the uterus
is empty. She should be counselled with regards to
the bleeding and pain she will experience. They, and
women who have had an ERPC, should be warned
of the possibility of endometritis and told of the
symptoms and signs to watch out for. These are: fever,
feeling unwell, lower abdominal pain and a change
in vaginal bleeding, which can become offensive
smelling and suddenly heavy.
If the woman is Rhesus negative she needs anti-D
after an ERPC or miscarriage after 12 weeks.
Unless investigation for recurrent miscarriage
is needed, no follow-up in hospital is necessary.
Before going home the woman should be given a
contact number for a local support group that can
help her answer the questions that will arise after
the miscarriage (Fig. 32.1). If she is not going to try
to get pregnant again in the near future, methods of
contraception should be discussed.

Recurrent Miscarriage
This is currently defined as three or more consecutive
miscarriages and affects 1 woman in 100. In many cases
no specific cause will be found but the investigations
below can be used to guide the treatment of other
women, leading to a happy outcome.

Incidence of miscarriage:
Overall, any pregnancy:
After one miscarriage:
After two miscarriages:
After three miscarriages:

Aetiology of recurrent miscarriage
• Parental genetic abnormality (e.g. balanced
translocation): found in 3–5% of partners
in couples affected by recurrent loss. Those
diagnosed are referred to a clinical geneticist.
• Uterine abnormality (e.g. septum, submucosal
fibroid): the incidence of these in women with
recurrent miscarriage has not been shown to
be significantly different from women with
normal pregnancies, but once diagnosed it may
be difficult to dissuade the woman from seeking
surgery.

Why has this happened?
She should be reassured that she has done nothing wrong and is not to blame, but
told that in most cases we do not find the cause for early miscarriage. Flying, working,
having smear tests, using mobile phones and VDUs and making love when
pregnant do not cause miscarriage.
Will it happen again?
Many women who have had a miscarriage will go on to have a healthy term pregnancy.
Realising how common early miscarriage is may reassure her.
When can I start trying to get pregnant again?
Physically there is no reason why she cannot conceive with her next cycle, and this
has no adverse effects on a resulting pregnancy, but mentally it may be better to
have a few months to recover from the miscarriage. Couples can be advised to use
condoms if they wish to wait for this time, as condoms are an instantly reversible
form of contraception.
When will my next period come?
The next period may be early or late, but should be expected in roughly one month
(or sooner or later depending on her usual cycle length). If she does not use
contraception after the miscarriage and the next period is late she should seek a
pregnancy test.

Fig. 32.1 Common questions asked by
women who have suffered a miscarriage.

32

Ectopic pregnancy
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome: the higher rate of
miscarriage in these women has been attributed
to their higher levels of LH. Unfortunately,
suppression of LH does not improve the live birth
rate.
• Antiphospholipid antibodies: this family of
autoantibodies includes lupus anticoagulant
and anticardiolipin antibodies. Their presence
impairs trophoblast function, partly by causing
thrombosis of the uteroplacental vessels. Some
affected patients might have only a 10% chance
of a live birth if untreated.
• Thrombophilic defects (e.g. factor V Leiden
mutation): women who have thrombophilia
due to protein C resistance (most commonly due
to a mutation of the factor V Leiden gene), or
abnormalities of protein S or antithrombin, are
more prone to recurrent miscarriage.
• Cervical weakness (‘incompetence’): this is
usually secondary to cervical trauma caused by
damage in childbirth or at operation (e.g. forcible
dilatation for late termination of pregnancy), but
in some cases can be congenital. It causes midtrimester miscarriage.
• Bacterial vaginosis: an imbalance in vaginal flora –
with a lack of lactobacilli, which are usually
commensal – results in bacterial vaginosis. The
cause of this change is unknown. It is not linked
to early miscarriage but it does predispose to
mid-trimester miscarriage.

Treatment of recurrent
miscarriage

seen on scan (around 6.5 weeks). The treatment
is stopped at 34 weeks. The same treatment for
women with thrombophilias has yet to be proved
to be effective in trials.
• Cervical cerclage (suture) for weakness can be
performed in pregnancy using the transvaginal
route at around 12 weeks, or before conception
by the transabdominal route (see Chapter 38).
With the former the suture is removed at around
36 weeks to allow vaginal delivery. Abdominal
sutures are left in situ and the woman is delivered
by caesarean section.
• Bacterial vaginosis is simply treated with
metronidazole or intravaginal antibiotic cream.
Treatments not proven to be effective include
progesterone pessaries/tablets/injections in the first
trimester, LH suppression, immunotherapy for
women said to be ‘allergic’ to their fetus, oral/
systemic steroids for women with antiphospholipid
antibodies and hCG supplementation.

Ectopic Pregnancy
This is a pregnancy that has implanted outside the
uterine cavity (see Fig. 32.2 for likely sites). The
incidence of ectopic pregnancy is increasing due to
the rising number of cases of pelvic inflammatory
disease (PID), asymptomatic chlamydial infection
and as the number of IVF pregnancies increase.
Currently in the UK the incidence is around 1 per 100
term deliveries; 10–15% of ectopics occur after IVF.

The treatment must be aimed at the cause. If no cause
is found (as is the case for a significant proportion)
support and reassurance should be offered:
• Couples affected by genetic abnormality might
opt for prenatal diagnosis, or even IVF with
preimplantation testing (see Chapter 28).
• Uterine septae and submucous fibroids are best
treated hysteroscopically noting that treatment
does not always improve the chances of a
successful pregnancy.
• Maintaining a normal BMI in polycystic ovarian
syndrome has been shown to improve pregnancy
outcome, whereas hormonal manipulation has not.
• Women with antiphospholipid antibodies
are given 75 mg aspirin daily as soon as
the pregnancy test is positive and 5000 iu
subcutaneous heparin once fetal heart activity is

If a woman has a positive pregnancy test
with bleeding or pain, even in absence of
risk factors an ectopic pregnancy must be
excluded.

Aetiology of ectopic pregnancy
Ectopic pregnancy is caused by conditions that
damage the uterine tubes or their ciliary lining, thus
hindering the passage of the fertilized egg towards the
uterine cavity, and anything that distorts the cavity
itself or predisposes to abnormal implantation. These
include:

175

pregnancy.

• PID.
• Tubal surgery, e.g. sterilization, reversal of
sterilization, previous ectopic pregnancy.
• Peritonitis or pelvic surgery in the past (e.g.
appendicitis).
• IUCD (‘coil’) in situ.
• IVF.
• Endometriosis.
• Progesterone-only (‘mini’) pill – this does
not cause ectopic pregnancy but if a woman
conceives when using it the pregnancy is more
likely to be ectopic than if she is using no
contraception at all. The progesterone reduces
tubal motility.

Clinical evaluation of ectopic
pregnancy
In a few cases the patient will require immediate
resuscitation and, as soon as possible, laparotomy.
Those who have an acute abdomen but who are
haemodynamically stable can have a laparoscopy to
confirm the diagnosis. Treatment can then be performed
laparoscopically or at laparotomy, depending on the
surgeon’s skill and the patient’s haemodynamic status.
If, as in most cases, the presentation is subacute –
it is not necessary to head straight for the operating
theatre. An ultrasound scan can be arranged; this may
not identify the ectopic pregnancy but will demonstrate
the fact that the uterus is empty. If there has been
bleeding from the ectopic the scan will show free fluid
in the pelvis. In some cases a mass in the adnexae can
be visualized and, uncommonly, this might contain a
live ectopic, with a fetal heartbeat present.

176

The appearance of an empty uterus on scan in the
presence of a positive pregnancy test should always
raise the strong suspicion of ectopic pregnancy, which
can be confirmed at laparoscopy. However, in some
cases there might be uncertainty about the dates of
LMP, meaning that the pregnancy could still be a very
early gestation, which might account for the ‘empty’
appearance of the uterus.
In other cases the history might not be clear
cut and there could be suspicion that the woman
has had a complete miscarriage, which also gives
the appearance of an empty uterus on scan, and,
as β-hCG does not return to a non-pregnant level
immediately, can cause confusion. In these cases,
if the patient is stable and there is doubt about the
diagnosis it is reasonable to delay laparoscopy by
performing two blood tests for β-hCG 48 hours apart.
If the pregnancy is viable the level will double. In
the case of miscarriage it will fall significantly. With
an ectopic the level will plateau or rise, but not as
much as double – the patient can then be booked for
laparoscopy.

Treatment of tubal pregnancy
The aim is to eliminate the ectopic pregnancy in such
a way as to minimize the risk of future pregnancies
being ectopic. Various methods are used.

Surgical management
These techniques can all be performed at laparotomy,
through a low transverse incision, or at laparoscopy.
The skill of the operator will dictate the choice (Fig.
32.3).

into the ectopic pregnancy either at laparoscopy or
transvaginally under ultrasound control.
Asymptomatic patients are carefully selected
for medical management – it is only suitable if the
pregnancy is small and the tube is intact. The sac is
measured on ultrasound scan as less than 3 cm in
size with no cardiac activity, and the β-hCG level
should be less than 3000 iu/L.

Fig. 32.3 Surgical options for treatment of tubal ectopic pregnancy.

Salpingectomy, complete or partial
Where the affected tube, or part of it, is removed. This
might be the only option if the ectopic has ruptured
because the tubal anatomy will have been destroyed.
In the event that an ectopic has occurred following
IVF where the tubes are scarred, the patient and
surgeon might decide that it would be wise to remove
both tubes at operation so that future IVF attempts
do not lead to further tubal pregnancies.

Salpingotomy
An incision is made over the ectopic, which is
removed, and the tube is usually allowed to heal by
secondary intention.

‘Milking’ the tube
When the ectopic is near the ampulla it is sometimes
possible to squeeze it out of the end of the tube
without needing to cut the tube at all.

Medical treatment
The use of the cytotoxic drug methotrexate to treat
ectopic pregnancy is increasing. It can be given as
intramuscular injections or by injection directly

Patients treated with methotrexate or by conservative
surgery (i.e. salpingotomy or milking out the ectopic)
must have serial serum β-hCG levels performed to
ensure the resolution or removal of all trophoblastic
tissue. Around 5% of patients treated medically will
require further treatment with either methotrexate or
a surgical procedure.

Prognosis after ectopic pregnancy
The chance of a repeat ectopic pregnancy is
dependent on the health of the remaining tubal
tissue. If management was conservative the affected
tube will have been scarred by the ectopic pregnancy.
Rates of ectopic implantation in future pregnancies
are around 11% after medical treatment, 12% after
‘conservative’ surgery and 9% after salpingectomy.
The chance of conception after salpingectomy is
obviously lower, so the risks must be weighed up
when deciding on management.

Other sites of ectopic pregnancy
These have high rates of maternal mortality and
morbidity. Cervical, interstitial and intramural
pregnancies are best treated with methotrexate.
The haemorrhage that can ensue from rupture or
from attempted surgical treatment can be severe,
necessitating hysterectomy and sometimes proving
fatal. Cornual pregnancy is treated surgically,
to remove the rudimentary horn in which the
pregnancy has implanted and the tube on the
affected side. Ovarian pregnancy can be treated
surgically, performing wedge resection of the ovary,
or medically. Abdominal pregnancy, if the fetus
survives, should be delivered as soon as the fetus is
viable.

Heterotopic pregnancy
The extremely rare combination of intra- and
extrauterine pregnancy is becoming more common

177

Early pregnancy failure
with the increase in IVF pregnancies where at least
two embryos are replaced. Treatment is usually
surgical, with the procedure being performed
laparoscopically but avoiding instrumentation of the
uterus. There is an increased risk of miscarriage for
the intrauterine pregnancy, being around 25%.

the incidence there is decreasing prompting the
suspicion that there is a nutritional element.
Women at the extremes of reproductive age are
more likely to experience trophoblastic disease.

Trophoblastic Disease

There is likely to be bleeding early in the pregnancy,
so the diagnosis can be made on ultrasound scan or
perhaps picked up first by the histopathologist after
the study of retained products of conception. The
trophoblastic tissue secretes hCG, so serum levels are
very high and might lead to exaggerated symptoms of
pregnancy (e.g. hyperemesis).

This term covers partial and complete molar
pregnancies and the choriocarcinoma that can follow
them.

Definitions

Diagnosis and clinical evaluation
of molar pregnancy

See Fig. 32.4.

Management of molar pregnancy

Incidence of molar pregnancy

Molar pregnancies are treated with surgical
evacuation in the same way as miscarriage. The
products of conception are sent for histology. The
patient must then be followed up with fortnightly
serum samples for β-hCG to ensure that levels are
falling, as this will confirm that the trophoblastic
tissue is regressing. This follow-up is coordinated by
the nearest specialist centre (Sheffield, Dundee or
Charing Cross). Once the levels are normal, urine
samples are tested every month for β-hCG in case of
reactivation of trophoblast tissue.

In the UK, complete mole occurs around 1 per 1000
normal pregnancies. Partial mole is more common
but the exact incidence is harder to calculate as many
go unreported. Three per cent of molar pregnancies
do not regress spontaneously and therefore require
chemotherapy – this is more common with complete
moles than partial moles.
Some ethnic groups are more prone to molar
pregnancy – it is more common in the Far East – but

• Complete mole: a pregnancy within the uterus consisting of a multivesicular
mass of trophoblastic tissue with hydropic change (looking like a bunch of
grapes on ultrasound), and no evidence of a fetus, formed by mono or dispermic
fertilization of an oocyte which has deleted all maternal genetic material, i.e. all
genes are paternal (see below)

• Partial mole: a pregnancy within the uterus consisting of some trophoblastic
proliferation and some hydropic change, where a fetus (usually non-viable) may
also be seen. Formed by dispermic fertilization of an oocyte resulting in triploidy
i.e. maternal and paternal genes
• Choriocarcinoma: a tumour of trophoblastic cells which secrete hCG occurring
when molar pregnancies do not regress after surgical evacuation or, more rarely,
after a non-molar pregnancy

178

Trophoblastic disease
If hCG levels return to normal within 8 weeks,
follow-up is limited to 6 months. All other cases are
followed for 2 years. Women are advised not to use
hormonal contraceptives and not to become pregnant
until levels have been normal for 6 months. In future
pregnancies serum β-hCG will be measured at 6 and
10 weeks postpartum because of the possibility of
choriocarcinoma occurring.
If hCG levels rise, plateau or are still abnormal
6 months after surgical evacuation, chemotherapy
is started. Most are given methotrexate and folinic
acid, although some with adverse prognostic
factors might need different combinations of other
chemotherapies.
The current survival rate of patients requiring
chemotherapy is 94%. Metastases from chorio­
carcinoma are seen in the lung, liver and brain.

Prenatal diagnosis

33

Objectives
This chapter will cover the indications for prenatal diagnosis:
• You will be able to understand the differences between non-invasive and invasive
prenatal diagnostic techniques
• You will understand the differences in technique, indication and complications of
amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling and fetal blood sampling.

Diagnosis of an ever-expanding number of
conditions can now be made prior to birth. This
allows for optimal preparation for the birth of
an affected baby, including the place and mode
of delivery (a tertiary centre rather than a district
general hospital might be appropriate) and the
involvement of neonatal or paediatric surgical teams,
if necessary. The parents can be psychologically
prepared for any intervention and can be put in
touch with appropriate support groups. In some
cases, once fully counselled, the parents might
decide to terminate the pregnancy.
Prenatal diagnosis is not just about invasive
procedures, which are detailed below. Ultrasound
alone is used to diagnose many structural
abnormalities, such as spina bifida and heart
defects. Once structural anomalies have been
diagnosed, the suspicion that the fetus might have
an underlying chromosomal abnormality could
arise and the parents would then be offered genetic
testing.

Who has Prenatal Diagnosis?
• Women who have a family history of a disorder.
• Women who have had a previous pregnancy/
baby affected by a disorder.
• Women whose babies are at increased risk of
chromosomal disorders, as suggested by the
maternal age alone, the result of serum screening
(‘double’ or ‘triple’ test) or nuchal translucency
scanning.

• Women who attend for a ‘routine’ ultrasound
scan that reveals an abnormality.
• Women who have acquired an infection in
pregnancy and there is any doubt as to whether
the fetus is also infected.
Some of the most common conditions suitable for
prenatal diagnosis are listed in Fig. 33.1.

Techniques for Prenatal
Diagnosis

Ultrasound

Every mother who has an anomaly scan
needs to understand that it is a form of
prenatal screening.

Most centres advocate performing scans to examine
the fetal anatomy in detail between 18 and 22 weeks.
However, many women now have routine scans much
earlier in pregnancy: dating scans take place at 7–12
weeks gestation and those for nuchal translucency
at 10–14 weeks (Fig. 33.2); basic anatomy can be
checked at this stage and some abnormalities will be
apparent. Nuchal translucency scanning combined
with maternal serum screening would appear to
be the most effective non-invasive test for Down
screening but is not yet routine practice.

Amniocentesis
Amniocentesis has a 1% risk
of miscarriage and 0.01% risk
of serious severe infection.
Careful counselling prior to invasive diagnostic
procedures is vital; the risk of the baby being affected
by a disorder should always be weighed up against
the risk of causing a healthy fetus to miscarry.

182

Transabdominal aspiration of amniotic fluid from
around the fetus under continuous ultrasound
guidance allows fetal cells (amniocytes) to be
separated from the amniotic fluid and cultured
to determine their genetic make-up (Fig. 33.3).
Amniocytes can also be analysed for the absence of
certain enzymes to diagnose the presence of fetal
inborn errors of metabolism, or be examined to
diagnose infection such as toxoplasma.
Amniocentesis is performed from 15 weeks,
ideally at around 16 weeks. Prior to this there are
insufficient viable amniocytes within the fluid.
Results of cell culture to determine karyotype or to
look for specific gene anomalies can take around 2
weeks. With more expensive equipment the culture
time can be reduced to 6 days but the UK national
average is around 11 days. In around 1% of cases the
cells will fail to culture.
Faster results – within 24–72 h – can be obtained
by using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) or
polymerase chain reaction (PCR). These techniques
give patients a ‘preliminary’ result, which is
confirmed by culture, although many patients now
make decisions regarding the future of the pregnancy
on the basis of the preliminary result.
Because amniocentesis causes trauma to the
uterus, with a risk of fetomaternal haemorrhage, anti-D
is always given to Rhesus negative women.

Chorionic villus sampling

�

Although CVS is performed
earlier in the pregnancy than
amniocentesis and gives the
parents the option of an earlier termination, it carries a
higher risk of miscarriage of 2%.

Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) allows biopsy of
the chorionic villi under continuous ultrasound
guidance to obtain a sample of cells that is examined
to determine genetic make-up. It is performed from
11 weeks onwards and has a 2% risk of miscarriage. It
can be performed transabdominally or transcervically
(Fig. 33.4), depending on the preference of the
operator. Some operators will always use the
transcervical route with low-lying placentae. As with
amniocentesis, it may precipitate feto-maternal
transfusion, so Anti-D is given to Rhesus negative
women.
Results can be obtained more quickly from CVS
samples, without resorting to FISH or PCR, because
the mass of DNA obtained is greater than that
from amniocentesis. ‘Direct’ CVS results – where
a karyotype is determined without waiting for cell
culture – are available within 3 days, although a
complete result from culture is still considered the
gold standard. However, FISH and PCR can still be
used to reduce the result time to a minimum.

183

Prenatal diagnosis
CVS has a false-positive rate of 1%, which is
higher than amniocentesis due to the mosaicism
of chorionic villi, which might show an abnormal
karyotype when the fetus is normal. It also has a false
negative rate of 0.1%, related to contamination with
maternal cells.

Fetal blood sampling
This is performed by transabdominal needle
aspiration of blood from the fetal hepatic vein or
the umbilical cord (when the procedure is known
as cordocentesis) under continuous ultrasound
guidance. Conditions that can be diagnosed include:
• Chromosomal anomalies: if abnormalities
are suspected later in pregnancy (because of
ultrasound findings or early onset growth
retardation) this method might be preferable to
amniocentesis or CVS.
• Fetal anaemia.
• Fetal thrombocytopenia, e.g. where the mother
has autoimmune thrombocytopenia.
• Fetal infection, using fetal IgM as a measure of
immune response.
Fetal blood sampling can also be used for treatment
of fetal conditions, for example to give transfusions,
but this application is not considered in this chapter.
The complications include bleeding from the
needling site (which can be fatal for the fetus),
fetal bradycardia as a reaction to vasospasm of the
umbilical artery, chorioamnionitis and rupture of the
membranes.
As with the invasive procedures described above
rhesus negative women are given anti-D.

184

Pre-implantation genetic
diagnosis
Pre-implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), which
is only available at a few centres at present, is
performed on eight-cell embryos created by IVF.
One or two cells are removed and subjected to
FISH or PCR to obtain a genetic diagnosis. Normal
embryos are replaced into the uterus and develop
normally, despite the ‘insult’ of having had cells
removed at an early stage. Abnormal embryos are
discarded.
This process is used by couples who have a high
(25–50%) chance of conceiving a baby who will be
affected by a genetic abnormality that would lead
to the parents opting to terminate the pregnancy.
It allows the parents to avoid having to choose to
terminate a viable pregnancy because only unaffected
embryos are replaced.
As it can only be performed on IVF embryos, PGD
carries all the risks and uncertainties associated with
IVF pregnancies – the side-effects of the drugs, the
medical intervention and the fact that only about
25% of embryos that are replaced into the uterus will
implant.

Antepar tum haemorrhage

34

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
• List the common causes of antepartum haemorrhage
• Distinguish between placenta praevia from placental abruption
• Describe the investigations appropriate for the patient who presents with an
antepartum haemorrhage
• Understand the place for conservative management in antepartum haemorrhage
• List the main complications of placenta praevia.

Definition
Antepartum haemorrhage (APH) is defined as any
vaginal bleeding that occurs after 24 weeks gestation
and before the birth of the infant.

Antepartum haemorrhge is an important
cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity
and mortality.

Incidence
The incidence of APH is 3%.

Aetiology
A summary is shown in Fig. 34.1. Placenta praevia
combined with placental abruption account for
about 50% of the causes of an APH. In both cases,
the bleeding comes from maternal vessels that are
exposed as the placenta separates from the decidua,
i.e. it is not fetal blood. Fetal hypoxia can occur as a
secondary process.

Placenta Praevia

Definition
The placenta is wholly or partially attached to the
lower uterine segment. The degree of attachment has
traditionally been divided into four grades (Fig. 34.2)
but should now be classified as either minor – which
encompasses grades I and II – or major – covering
grades III and IV.

Incidence
Placenta praevia occurs in 0.4–0.8% of pregna­
ncies; this figure has altered with routine use of
ultrasound scanning. The incidence is increased
with:
Increasing maternal age.
Increasing parity.
Multiple pregnancy.
Previous caesarean section.
Presence of a succenturiate
placental lobe.
• Smoking.
•
•
•
•
•

It is associated with a maternal mortality rate of
about 0.03% in the developed world. However, both
maternal and fetal morbidity are substantially higher
in developing countries due to complications such as
haemorrhage and prematurity.

History
Painless vaginal bleeding
Bleeding from a placenta praevia is usually
unprovoked and occurs in the third trimester, in the
absence of labour.

When taking a history, the
presence of abdominal pain is
the distinguishing clinical factor
between placenta praevia and placental abruption.

palpation, the uterus is soft and non-tender. Because
the placenta is low lying, it displaces the presenting part
from the pelvis so that a cephalic presentation is not
engaged, or there is a malpresentation (see Chapter 39).
With a minor degree of bleeding, a speculum can
be passed to exclude a lower genital tract cause for
the APH. A digital examination should be avoided
because it may provoke massive bleeding.

Diagnosis
As part of the routine 20-week ultrasound scan, the
placental site is localized. If a low-lying placenta is
noted then a follow-up scan in the third trimester is
usually performed to make the diagnosis of placenta
praevia. In the majority of patients, as the lower
segment begins to form and the upper segment
enlarges upwards, so the placenta appears to move
up, away from the cervical os. A transvaginal scan
is the diagnostic technique of choice due to its
improved accuracy over the transabdominal mode.

Investigations
Blood should be sent for haemoglobin and group
and save. Anti D is indicated if the patient is Rhesus
negative. If the bleeding is heavy, cross-matching
4 units of blood for transfusion is indicated
and a baseline clotting screen. Renal function
tests are necessary if the urine output is poor. A
cardiotocograph should be performed to check fetal
wellbeing. An ultrasound scan should be performed
if the placental location is unknown (Fig. 34.4).

Management
Management depends first on assessing the severity
of the bleeding and resuscitation of the patient if
necessary (see Chapter 18). Immediate delivery by
caesarean section may be appropriate if there is either
maternal or fetal compromise.

Don’t forget your basic ABC of
resuscitation in a patient with severe
symptoms.

Examination
General observations including maternal pulse and
blood pressure must be performed. On abdominal

186

Expectant management depends on the severity
of bleeding, the gestation of the pregnancy and the

Placental abruption
placental site. If the placenta remains at or over the
cervical os, massive bleeding is likely to occur if the
patient goes into labour and the cervix starts to dilate.
Therefore, inpatient management is appropriate
in the third trimester with immediate recourse to
caesarean section if necessary. Caesarean section is
advised if the placenta is encroaching within 2 cm
if the internal cervical os. If the head of the fetus
becomes engaged (i.e. it passes below the leading
edge of the placenta) then vaginal delivery may be
possible.

Complications
Placenta praevia is associated with an increased risk
of PPH (see Chapters 16 and 42). The lower uterine
segment is less efficient at retraction following
delivery of the placenta compared to the upper
segment. Thus occlusion of the venous sinuses is less
effective resulting in heavier blood loss.
Placenta accreta (see Chapter 42) is also a
potential complication in up to 15% of patients
with placenta praevia, especially those who have
had a previous caesarean section. Whether this has
been diagnosed preoperatively on ultrasound scan
or not, preparations should be in place for potential
PPH. This includes cross-matching blood and both
consultant obstetrician and anaesthetist input.
The patient should be given adequate counselling
regarding the possible need for medical and
surgical measures to control bleeding including
hysterectomy.

Future pregnancy
Placenta praevia has a recurrence rate of 4–8%.

Placental Abruption

Definition
The placental attachment to the uterus is disrupted
by haemorrhage as blood dissects under the placenta,
possibly extending into the amniotic sac or the
uterine muscle.

Incidence
Placental abruption occurs in about 1% of
pregnancies in the UK. In the majority of cases the
cause is unknown but it is associated with:

34

• Maternal hypertension or pre-eclampsia.
• Abdominal trauma, e.g. assault, road traffic
accident.
• Cigarette smoking.
• Cocaine use.
• Lower socioeconomic group.
• External cephalic version.

History
Vaginal bleeding associated
with abdominal pain
The patient can present at any stage of pregnancy with
a history of bleeding and constant abdominal pain,
which is usually unprovoked. This may be associated
with uterine contractions.
As maternal blood escapes from the placental
sinuses, it tracks down between the membranes and
the uterus and escapes via the cervix; this is known as a
revealed haemorrhage. Sometimes, the blood remains
sealed within the uterine cavity such that the degree of
shock is out of proportion to the vaginal loss; this is
known as a concealed haemorrhage (Fig. 34.3).
Depending on the patient’s previous antenatal
history, she should be asked about symptoms of
pre-eclampsia, including headache, blurred vision,
nausea and epigastric pain (see Chapter 35).

Examination
The general maternal condition, including pulse and
blood pressure, should be assessed. On abdominal
palpation the uterus is typically tender. As bleeding
extends into the uterine muscle, a tonic contraction
can occur, making the uterus feel hard. Fetal parts
are difficult to palpate. If the placental site is known
(i.e. if placenta praevia has been excluded) a digital
examination might be appropriate to diagnose the
onset of labour.
Maternal hypertension and proteinuria must be
excluded due to the association between abruption
and pre-eclampsia. If present, liver tenderness,
hyperreflexia and clonus should be excluded (see
Chapter 35).

Investigations
Blood should be sent for haemoglobin and group
and save. Anti D is indicated if the patient is Rhesus
negative. If the bleeding is heavy or if the patient is
shocked, cross-matching units of blood for transfusion

187

is indicated and a baseline clotting screen. A Klei­
hauer test should be requested which indicates
the presence of fetal red blood cells within the
maternal circulation. This confirms the diagnosis
of feto-maternal haemorrhage which occurs in an
abruption.
Renal function tests are necessary if the urine
output is poor or in conjunction with liver function
tests if pre-eclampsia is suspected. Urinalysis should
be done to exclude proteinuria; if present, a 24-hour
urine protein level may be helpful to determine the
degree of renal involvement (see Chapter 35).
A cardiotocograph should be done to check fetal
wellbeing. A sinusoidal pattern can be seen with an
abruption. It will also monitor uterine activity. There
may be palpable uterine contractions or the uterus
might simply be irritable with irregular activity.
An ultrasound scan is of limited value since only
a large retroplacental haemorrhage will be seen. The
diagnosis of abruption is usually made on clinical
grounds (Fig. 34.4).

Management
As for placenta praevia, management of a placental
abruption must start with assessment of the severity of the
symptoms. In a situation where the patient is clinically
well and the fetus is not compromised, expectant
management might allow the symptoms to resolve.
However, in a more serious situation, active resuscitation
of the patient could be necessary (see Chapter 18) with
immediate delivery of the fetus as a life-saving procedure
for the mother regardless of gestation.

Complications
Accurate assessment of blood loss is necessary to
assess the risks of developing disseminated intra­
vascular coagulation and renal failure (see Chapter
18). Post-partum haemorrhage occurs in 25% of cases
which rarely leads to Sheehan’s syndrome (pituitary
necrosis secondary to hypovolaemic shock – see
Chapter 42).

Future pregnancy
The risk of recurrence is about 8%.

Vasa Praevia
This is a rare cause of antepartum haemorrhage.
There is a velamentous insertion of the cord and the
vessels lie on the membranes that cover the internal
cervical os, in front of the presenting part. When the
membranes rupture, the vessels can be torn and vaginal
bleeding occurs. Unlike placenta praevia and placental
abruption, this blood is fetal blood and the fetus must
be delivered urgently before it exsanguinates.

Unexplained antepartum haemorrhage
If you are not sure of the diagnosis, a Kleihauer
test can be performed on the PV loss to test for the
presence of fetal red blood cells.

Circumvallate Placenta
This type of placenta develops secondary to outward
proliferation of the chorionic villi into the decidua,
beneath the ring of attachment of the amnion and
chorion. This does not interfere with placental
function, but it is associated with antepartum and
intrapartum haemorrhage.

be taken. The cervix should be visualized with a
speculum examination and the date of the patient’s
last smear test checked.
However, overall, perinatal mortality with any
type of APH is double that of a normal pregnancy,
suggesting that placental function might be
compromised. Therefore, it might be appropriate to
consider delivery at term, by inducing labour.

Hypertension in pregnancy

35

Objectives
This chapter will explain the different types of hypertensive disorders that affect pregnant
women:
• You will understand the impact on the mother and fetus that hypertension in pregnancy
can have
• The management of these conditions will be discussed and how to minimize risk to
mother and fetus in current and future pregnancies.

Hypertension may predate the pregnancy or might
have been induced by the pregnancy. In some
cases, hypertension is part of the syndrome of preeclampsia. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affect
around 1 in 10 pregnancies.

Always remember that, due to
the physiological changes seen
in pregnancy, blood pressure
falls in the first and second trimesters, reaching its
lowest at around 23 weeks. From then on the blood
pressure rises again until it has reached pre-pregnancy
levels at term. This is why regular BP readings during
different stages of pregnancy are so important.

Non-Proteinuric
Hypertension in Pregnancy

Hypertension diagnosed prior
to or early in pregnancy
This group includes known hypertensives and those
whose hypertension is diagnosed in the first trimester,
when the high blood pressure cannot be thought to
be due to the pregnancy and was almost certainly
present prior to pregnancy, although never measured.
The risk factors for pre-existing hypertension are:
• Increasing maternal age.
• A family history.

• Medical disorders (e.g. diabetes mellitus, renal
disease).
• Certain ethnic groups including those of Asian,
African & Caribbean and South Pacific island
origin.
Hypertension in a young woman not known to have
any medical problems should be investigated to
exclude the more unusual causes of hypertension:
•
•
•
•
•

coarctation of the aorta
renal artery stenosis
Conn’s syndrome
Cushing’s syndrome
phaeochromocytoma

Pregnancy-induced hypertension
Non-proteinuric hypertension that occurs in the second
half of pregnancy can be thought of as a separate entity
to essential hypertension and pre-eclampsia, but it is
closely linked with both. Typically, it resolves within
6 weeks of delivery. The clinical sequelae are the same
as those seen with essential hypertension and the
management has the same aims.

Effects of non-proteinuric
hypertension in pregnancy
The risks are threefold:
• Maternal health: above mean arterial pressures of
125 mmHg there is a risk of cerebral haemorrhage.
• Fetal health: pregnancies affected by essential
hypertension are more susceptible to IUGR
• Increased risk of developing pre-eclampsia.

191

Hypertension in pregnancy

Management of essential
hypertension and
pregnancy-induced
hypertension
• Women known to be hypertensive prior to
pregnancy should ideally receive preconception
counselling, with advice about diet, weight and
exercise to maximize control. Antihypertensive
medications should be reviwed and those contraindicated changed.
• If hypertension is first diagnosed in early
pregnancy an underlying cause should be sought
(see Chapter 13).
• The woman should be warned about the signs
and symptoms of pre-eclampsia, as she is at
increased risk.
• Uterine artery dopplers can be arranged
as persistent notching at 22 weeks may
be associated with increased risk of preeclampsia.
• Low-dose aspirin started by 12 weeks can
reduce the risk of an ‘at-risk’ woman from
developing severe pre-eclampsia. This tends
to be useful in women with a history of
severe early (<32 weeks) onset
pre-eclampsia.
• Drug treatment that lowers blood pressure (see
below) cannot prevent the development of
pre-eclampsia but can reduce the risk of cerebral
haemorrhage.
• The mother’s BP and urine should be checked
regularly.
• Growth scans should be arranged to monitor
fetal growth.

Pre-Eclampsia
The risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Primiparous.
Age >35 years.
Essential hypertension.
Multiple pregnancy.
Previous pregnancy affected by
pre-eclampsia.
Family history e.g. patient’s mother or sister, with
the strongest link being if the patient’s sister had
pre-ecla mpsia.

192

The recurrence rate of pre-eclampsia
is around 10% but is higher if there is
another medical problem contributing to
the hypertension or if the next pregnancy is with a
new partner.

Pathology
Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder of
endothelium affecting different organs throughout
the body. The underlying pathology relates to
blood vessels and the chemicals that control them;
women with pre-eclampsia have abnormal vessel
responses to pregnancy. In normal pregnancy the
peripheral resistance falls; in pre-eclampsia the
drop in peripheral resistance is not as marked.
Compared with a normal pregnancy the woman
has increased sensitivity to pressor agents, reduced
prostacyclin (a vasodilator) levels and increased
thromboxane (a vasoconstrictor) levels. There is
relative haemoconcentration due to less of the
normal expansion in blood volume. The end-organ
effects are shown in Fig. 35.1.
The symptoms and investigation of high blood
pressure are detailed in Chapter 13.

The only cure for pre-eclampsia is delivery.
If this is before 34 weeks remember to
administer steroids and include your
neonatal colleagues.

Management of pre-eclampsia
• Treating high blood pressure in pre-eclampsia is
important for the same reasons as with essential
hypertension – to prevent intracerebral bleeds
and to protect fetal health.
• Treatment of hypertension will not alter the
course of the disease – the only treatment for preeclampsia is to deliver the baby. If the pregnancy
has reached term and the cervix is favourable,
induction of labour is sensible. If the cervix is not
ripe and the pre-eclampsia is not severe, it may be

better to monitor the condition until successful
induction is more likely.
• In labour, continuous monitoring is wise because
the fetus will be more prone to distress and
because treatment for high blood pressure can
cause sudden hypotension, resulting in fetal
compromise.
• If the mother has severe pre-eclampsia,
fluid restriction should be exercised. Blood
pressure can be controlled with intravenous
hydralazine or labetalol, or intermittent doses
of nifedipine.
When pre-eclampsia occurs preterm (before 37
weeks’ gestation), decisions about induction and
delivery are more difficult. Bearing in mind the
problems encountered by premature babies, it might
be prudent to wait, monitor the condition of mother
and baby, and try to achieve fetal maturity. In severe
pre-eclampsia, however, the benefit of remaining in
utero will not be great as compromised placental
perfusion will result in little, if any, fetal growth.
Pre-eclampsia can be described as ‘fulminating’ –
severe and of rapid onset. In these cases delivery is
more likely to be by caesarean section, unless the

woman is already in labour and is progressing rapidly.
The classification of severity of pre-eclampsia depends
on a combination of signs and symptoms (Fig. 35.2).

Complications of pre-eclampsia
The fetal and maternal effects of pre-eclampsia are
reduced by careful control of the blood pressure and
careful fluid management but these measures will not
necessarily prevent complications which include:

pre-eclampsia

Eclampsia.
Renal failure.
Hepatic rupture.
HELLP: haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and
low platelets.
Cerebral haemorrhage.
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).
Pulmonary oedema.
Increased perinatal mortality and morbidity due
to increased preterm delivery, uteroplacental
insufficiency and abruption (particularly in
HELLP and severe PET).

Eclampsia
Eclampsia is defined as fitting or seizure secondary
to pre-eclampsia. The appearance is the same
as a grand mal epileptic seizure. It can occur in
women who have previously been completely
well through pregnancy, in whom there has been
no suspicion of pre-eclampsia. Eclampsia affects
1:2000 pregnancies. Around 40% of eclamptic
fits happen postnatally but usually within 48h
of delivery. The mortality rate is between 0.5 and
5.5%. The differential diagnosis includes epilepsy,
meningitis, cerebral thrombosis and intracerebral
bleed or tumour.

Complications of eclampsia
As in severe pre-eclampsia, these are both fetal and
maternal:
• Abruption (which can lead to fetal death and
maternal DIC).
• Pulmonary oedema.
• Cerebral haemorrhage.
• Liver rupture.
• Retinal detachment.
• Maternal death.

Management of eclampsia
• The first priority is basic resuscitation; airways,
breathing and circulation (ABC). The airway
should be secured and ventilation provided if
necessary.
• Next, the convulsions must be addressed.
Magnesium sulphate is given as an intravenous

194

bolus followed by an infusion to reduce the risk
of further seizures. If the initial fit continues,
intravenous diazepam may be used.
• The blood pressure can be controlled using an
intravenous hydralazine or labetolol infusion.
• If this occurs in the antenatal period, delivery (by
caesarean section) is achieved once the mother is
stable.
• Close observation is needed for 24 hours after
the fit, including regular assessment of reflexes
while on magnesium (see below) and strict fluid
restriction of 85 mL/h.

Drug therapy for hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy
• Methyldopa is the most extensively studied drug
used for hypertension in pregnancy and has a
good safety profile. Side-effects for the mother
include lethargy and diarrhoea. It is generally
stopped in the postnatal period due to worries re
increased risk of depression.
• Beta-blockers such as labetalol can be used
orally or as an intravenous infusion (for rapid
control of severe hypertension). One small
study showed that they might cause fetal
growth restriction when used throughout
pregnancy. But in the short term they seem
to be safe. They are contraindicated in severe
asthmatics.
• Calcium antagonists (e.g. nifedipine) are added
if a single therapy has failed to control the blood
pressure. The side-effects are headaches and
flushing.
• Hydralazine is used as an intravenous infusion
to control severe hypertension. It causes
vasodilation, and can therefore cause headaches
and flushing.
• ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy
as they can cause fetal renal failure.
• Magnesium sulphate is used as an intravenous
infusion for the prevention of further fits after
an eclamptic fit. It has been suggested, but
not proved, that it is useful for prophylaxis in
women with severe pre-eclampsia who seem
at high risk of eclampsia. Magnesium toxicity
can cause neuromuscular blockade, resulting in
cardiorespiratory arrest, so careful monitoring of
respiratory rate, tendon reflexes and symptoms

Eclampsia
of double vision/slurred speech is important,
especially in the presence of a reduced urine output.
It is often necessary to continue antihypertensive
medication postnatally. All the drugs listed above
are safe in breastfeeding mothers. If the woman is a
known hypertensive on treatment she can return to
her prepregnancy medication once she has delivered.

pregnancy

36

Objectives
• By the end of this chapter you should be familiar with most common medical conditions
in pregnancy
• You should be aware of the effects of diabetes and epilepsy in pregnancy, and how to
treat these two conditions
• You should be able to discuss HIV in the context of pregnancy and delivery
• You should be able to discuss the importance of excluding obstetric cholestasis in a
pregnant woman who presents with an itch
• The importance of different psychiatric disorders in pregnancy should be clear to you.

Anaemia

The lower limit of normal haemoglobin
concentration in pregnancy is 10.5 g/dL.
The maximum increase possible in
haemoglobin per week with iron tablets or injections
is 0.8 g/dL.

Plasma expansion in pregnancy results in a physi­
ological reduction in haemoglobin concentration.
The body’s handling of iron and folate changes (Fig.
36.1). However, due to the demands of the developing
fetus and, in some cases, aggravated by pre-existing
anaemia or iron deficiency due to heavy periods or
grand multiparity, women may develop iron deficiency
anaemia in pregnancy.
The symptoms of anaemia – fatigue, dizziness,
fainting – are also common symptoms of pregnancy.
Anaemia is proven by a full blood count looking at
haemoglobin concentration and red cell indices.
It should not be assumed that anaemia is due
to lack of iron. Renal clearance of folate doubles
in pregnancy, making women prone to deficiency.
Measuring serum iron, ferritin, folate and red cell
folate will help to determine whether the anaemia is
due to deficiency of iron, folate or both (Fig. 36.2).
Many doctors believe that prevention is better
than cure and that the disadvantages of the side-effects

of iron and folate tablets are outweighed by the
advantages that can be conferred by taking supplements
routinely in pregnancy, thus avoiding the symptoms of
anaemia and need for transfusions.

Iron absorption in the gut
is aided by the presence of
vitamin C but impaired by
caffeine. Taking iron tablets with orange juice should
be encouraged but not caffeine-containing drinks.

Asthma
This affects at least 3% of women of childbearing
age and can improve, deteriorate or stay the same
during pregnancy. Peak flow and FEV1 are unaffected
by pregnancy, so remain the mainstay of monitoring
asthma.
The main problem arises from women being
worried to use their inhalers or to take oral
steroids for fear of the possible harmful effect on
the fetus. They can be entirely reassured, as the
doses of drugs, and the types of drugs used are
completely safe in pregnancy. The main danger to
the fetus is if the woman suffers repeated severe
attacks, so she should be encouraged to manage
her asthma well.

Reassure women that an
acute asthma attack in labour
is extremely rare. If she is on
a high dose of oral steroids however hydrocortisone
cover during labour will be needed.

This section covers women with pre-existing diabetes,
those with gestational diabetes, and the effect of these
conditions on the fetus.
In normal pregnancy the woman becomes more
resistant to her own body’s insulin, partly due
to the ‘anti-insulin’ hormones (human placental
lactogen, glucagons and cortisol) secreted by the
placenta. At the same time, glucose handling changes
and the body loses its ability to regulate glucose
levels smoothly, leading to lower fasting levels and
higher postprandial levels than when not pregnant.
These effects increase through the second and third
trimesters.
The renal threshold for glucose also changes, so
that most women will have glycosuria on urinalysis at
some time in pregnancy. To cope with these changes,
a pregnant woman will have doubled her insulin
production by the end of pregnancy.

Pre-existing diabetes
Breastfeeding while using inhalers or oral ster­
oids is safe and might reduce the risk of the baby
developing asthma in later life.

Diabetes
• Need increased doses of insulin.
• Are more likely to experience ‘hypos’
(hypoglycaemic attacks).
• Might experience acceleration of the complications
of diabetes (e.g. nephropathy, retinopathy).
• Can develop diabetic ketoacidosis if another
factor ‘tips them over’ (e.g. hyperemesis, infection,
administration of corticosteroids; see below).
Figure 36.3 shows the complications that can occur
in pregnancy when there is pre-existing diabetes.

Management
Most of the complications listed above can be reduced
by good control. Preconception and early pregnancy
control can be assessed by measuring the HbA1c
(glycosylated haemoglobin) level. The management
of women with diabetes in pregnancy consists of:
• Joint care with midwives, obstetricians and
diabetic physicians. Women should ideally have
been seen prior to pregnancy.
• Women should be commenced on 5 mg of folic
acid prior to trying for a pregnancy. This should
continue until 12 weeks.
• Informing the woman how to achieve good
control and why it is so vital.
• Dietary advice: a low-sugar, low-fat, high-fibre
diet will make it easier to keep glucose levels
more stable; she is likely to need to snack inbetween meals to protect against hypoglycaemia
(but these can be healthy snacks!).
• Home blood glucose monitoring and clinic
HbA1c monitoring.

36

• Increasing insulin doses as necessary, and
converting women with non-insulin-dependent
diabetes to insulin to achieve better control.
• Fundoscopy at regular intervals to assess for
retinopathy.
• Anomaly screening: in the form of nuchal
translucency scanning plus the detailed anomaly
scan, including cardiac assessment.
• Scans for growth and liquor.
It is particularly important to pay attention to sugar
control at times when an additional stress has been
placed on the body, for example at times of illness,
infection or in labour, when a sliding scale is used for
accurate control.
Corticosteroids, which might be given to the
mother for the benefit of the baby when premature
delivery is expected, are naturally diabetogenic and
can cause high readings for a few days.

An insulin sliding scale is used during
labour.

Although women with diabetes are more likely
to have a caesarean section, this is because of the
complications listed above rather than a recommen­
ded mode of delivery. The timing of delivery relates
to the control of the diabetes – most units will deliver
their diabetic mothers by 39 weeks to reduce the risk
of intrauterine death and stillbirth.

Medical disorders in pregnancy

Postnatal considerations
The neonate is at risk of:
• Hypoglycaemia.
• Respiratory distress.
• Jaundice.
Liaison with the paediatric team is sensible because
the baby is likely to need some special care. Ongoing
monitoring of the mother’s glucose levels will be
necessary, especially if she is breastfeeding, as her
insulin requirements will take longer to return to
prepregnancy levels.

Gestational diabetes
The incidence of this condition varies depending on
the criteria used to diagnose it, but it is known to be
far more prevalent in women of South East Asian,
Mediterranean, and Afro-Caribbean origin. Other
risk factors include:
• Past history of gestational diabetes.
• Previous macrosomic baby.
• Family history of diabetes.
It usually develops in the second or early third
trimester; if diabetes is diagnosed earlier than this in
pregnancy the suspicion should be raised that it was
present but undiagnosed prior to pregnancy, and the
management plans above should be applied.

Diabetes is diagnosed if a fasting blood
glucose is greater than 7.8 mmol/L or
if a postprandial glucose is greater than
11.1 mmol/L.

These pregnancies are not at increased risk of
congenital abnormality but the risks of perinatal
death and morbidity are higher than in non-diabetic
pregnancies. The woman is also at increased risk of
developing proteinuric hypertension.

Always remember that all
diabetic pregnancies are more
at risk of stillbirth and neonatal
morbidity and mortality. Pre-existing diabetics also
have a higher risk of fetal abnormality, hence the
importance of careful pre-pregnancy counselling.

Management
The mainstay of management is dietary advice
combined with home blood glucose monitoring.
Insulin is needed if diet fails to control glucose
levels. Fetal growth and liquor volume are moni­
tored with regular scans and a joint approach
should be taken to care, ideally involving a team of
diabetic physician and specialist nurses, obstetrician
and midwife.
If on insulin, the woman is likely to need a sliding
scale in labour, but this can be stopped when the
third stage is complete. The neonate will be at risk
of hypoglycaemia, so the paediatrician should be
involved.
Women who develop gestational diabetes should
be made aware that they are at high risk of deve­
loping non-insulin-dependent diabetes in the fut­
ure and that their attitudes and actions regarding
lifestyle, weight and diet can significantly affect this
risk.

Diagnosis of gestational diabetes can be made:
• On screening: some units offer this to women
with the risk factors listed above.
• As a result of maternal symptoms or signs: if
the woman has recurrent infections, persistent
glycosuria or feels ‘large for dates’ with
macrosomia or polyhydramnios seen on scan.
• In retrospect, when HbA1c testing is done to
investigate an intrauterine death/stillbirth or
an unexpectedly macrosomic baby who was
hypoglycaemic following delivery.

200

Epilepsy
Epilepsy affects 1 in 200 women of childbearing
age. Pregnancy can exacerbate epilepsy but, equally,
the frequency of seizures can decline. Seizures are
particularly likely around the time of labour due
to hyperventilation, dehydration and exhaustion.
Seizures do not in themselves harm the baby but
status epilepticus is dangerous for mother and
fetus.

Human immunodeficiency virus

Complications

Ensure that women who have
epilepsy take 5 mg folic acid
daily before and throughout
pregnancy. This reduces the risk of neural tube defects
and facial clefts, and counteracts the anti-folate
effects of anticonvulsants that make women with
epilepsy more prone to folate-deficiency anaemia.

The main concern for pregnant women who are
epileptic is that all drugs used to treat epilepsy are
teratogenic; possible effects are shown in Fig. 36.4.
The rate of abnormality is around 6% (two or
three times the background level) for one drug and
increases with additional drugs so monotherapy is
the aim. For those not on treatment the rate is 3%.
The discrepancy is accounted for by the inherent
link between facial clefts and epilepsy that is
independent of drug therapy.

It is advisable for women to continue
medication during pregnancy using
monotherapy at the lowest dose required
to achieve seizure control. Polytherapy would seem
best avoided where possible.

Control of seizures in pregnancy can deteriorate
because drug levels change as a result of the
difference in drug handling by the body. If seizures
become frequent, drug levels should be monitored
regula­rly, but the question of compliance should
also be addressed – the patient might need further

reassurance that it is safer for her baby that she takes
her medication than that she run the risk of poor
control.
Anticonvulsants affect hepatic handling of vitamin
K, increasing the risk of haemorrhagic disease in the
newborn, so women taking medication should receive
oral vitamin K supplements from 36 weeks, and the
baby should have intramuscular vitamin K at birth.
Breastfeeding while taking anticonvulsants is
generally regarded as safe. Occasionally, if the feed
coincides with a peak in drug levels, the infant might
become drowsy. All that is necessary is to change the
time of feeding in relation to tablet taking.

Human Immunodeficiency
Virus

Screening
In the UK, the Department of Health has recommended
that antenatal testing for HIV be part of routine care,
being offered to all women at booking.
Centres that have adopted the offer of testing to all
women have had good take-up rates, and it is known
that in some inner-city areas the incidence of HIV is
as high as 0.5% in the booking population (although
some of those women will already be aware of their
diagnosis).

Complications
The main risk is of vertical transmission, that is of
the baby becoming HIV positive, as neonatal and
infant HIV infection carries a very poor prognosis.
Transmission of the virus can occur antenatally or
during labour (rates of around 30% without retroviral
treatment) or postnatally, through breastfeeding, which
doubles the risk of transmission. Factors that increase
the risk of vertical transmission are shown in Fig. 36.5.

Management
• Women with HIV should be cared for by a
multidisciplinary team, including specialist
midwife, HIV physician and an obstetrician with
special interest.
• Genital infections should be screened for at
booking and again at 28 weeks.
• Detailed ultrasound scan for fetal anomalies after
first trimester exposure to antiretrovirals and
folate antagonists used for PCP prophylaxis.

Medical disorders in pregnancy

Fig. 36.5 Factors increasing the risk of vertical transmission
of human immunodeficiency virus
• Advanced maternal disease, high viral load, low CD4
counts
• Procedures that risk fetal and maternal blood mixing:
 amniocentesis/chorionic villous sampling
 fetal blood sampling/fetal scalp electrodes in labour
• Normal or instrumental vaginal delivery
 Prolonged duration of membrane rupture,
chorioamnionitis
 Preterm delivery
• Breastfeeding

• Women who do not require HIV treatment
for their own health do so to prevent vertical
transmission. Usually commenced between 28
and 32 weeks.
• Maternal viral loads and CD4 counts are
monitored.
• Those with undetectable viral loads may choose
to have a vaginal delivery. Those with detectable
viral load are advised to have a caesarean section.
Zidovudine infusion is started four hours prior to
caesarean section until the cord is clamped.
• Anti-retroviral is usually discontinued soon
after delivery. Zidovudine is administered to the
neonate orally for 6 weeks.

Vertical transmission of HIV infection from
mother to neonate is reduced by treating
with anti-retrovirals, delivery by caesarean
section and avoiding breast feeding.

Women in the developed world are advised not to
breastfeed. In the developing world the risks of nonsterile bottlefeeding and the loss of the protection
against common infant ailments afforded by breast­
feeding might mean that breast is still best.

mortality rates of 20–30% for the fetus and 10–20%
for the mother. It is associated with obesity and with
multiple pregnancy.
The woman presents with nausea, malaise and
loss of appetite. She then develops severe vomiting
and abdominal pain, jaundice and ascites. Fulminant
liver failure can ensue, leading to renal failure,
encephalopathy (with drowsiness and confusion)
and clotting anomalies culminating in DIC.
Pathology specimens show fatty infiltration of
hepatocytes, and the gold standard for diagnosis is
liver biopsy, although this might be inadvisable given
clotting problems. Ultrasound and MRI have been
used as alternatives to visualize the fatty infiltration
of the liver. Bloods show hypoglycaemia, extremely
high transaminase (ALT and AST) levels, alkaline
phosphatase raised to a lesser degree and a very high
urate.
Management is to correct hypoglycaemia and
clotting as far as possible and then to deliver the baby.
Rapid reversal of the problem follows delivery.

Obstetric cholestasis

Obstetric cholestasis should
be considered in any pregnant
woman complaining of itchy
palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

This disorder is of unknown aetiology but there is
a strong family history. Women present in the late
second or third trimester with severe pruritus that is
worst on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet;
on examination there is no rash, but there might be
excoriation marks. Direct questioning might reveal
pale, fatty stools, dark urine and loss of appetite.

hepatitis. The complications are shown in Fig. 36.6.

Management
Management consists of:
• Reducing the itching: cholestyramine acts to
reduce bile acids and can relieve itching but often
causes vomiting and diarrhoea. Antihistamines
work for some women, but have unwelcome
sedative effects. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)
lowers bile acids and reduces itching, but is not
licensed for use in pregnancy.

UDCA lowers serum bile acids and
reduces symptoms of itching but does
NOT reduce the perinatal morbidity and
mortality.

• Reducing the risk of fetal and maternal
haemorrhage: women are prescribed daily
vitamin K tablets from 36 weeks.
• Monitoring fetal well-being: unfortunately,
the drugs listed above, which reduce bile acids,
have not been shown to reduce the fetal risks of
cholestasis. Regular CTG monitoring and growth
scans are performed but probably do not make
a difference in terms of preventing intrauterine
death. The mother is warned to be aware of
and to report any change or reduction in fetal
movements.
• Delivery: once the fetus is considered sufficiently
mature, that is, around 37 weeks. Obstetric
cholestasis in itself is not an indication for

36

elective caesarean section but because of the
increased risk of fetal distress in labour there
is a higher than average chance of the woman
needing operative delivery.
• Counselling: regarding the risks to this pregnancy
and to future pregnancies (there is a high
recurrence rate). Women should also be warned
to avoid the combined oral contraceptive pill
because it can provoke similar liver dysfunction.

Multiple Sclerosis
The typical female multiple sclerosis (MS) sufferer is
of childbearing age but new presentation during
pre­gnancy is unusual. The usual picture is of a relapsing
and remitting course – often better in the third trime­
ster but worse in the 6 months following delivery. The
disease itself has no effect on the fetus or on pregnancy
but if mobility is limited the risk of thrombosis should
be considered and appropriate precautions (e.g. thro­mbo­
embolic disease (TED) stockings) introduced; if there
are pre-existing bladder problems, the risk of urinary
tract infection will be higher.
The use of cannabis to relieve symptoms of MS is
increasing. At present, the usual method of taking it
is to smoke it mixed with tobacco. Women should be
made aware that the risks to the baby are the same as
for cigarette smoking.

Psychiatric Disorders

Depression
Recognition of postnatal depression has received
widespread attention in the media and in the medical
literature. The subject of antenatal depression is less
popular and yet, on closer questioning of women
suffering from postnatal depression, many of them
admit to symptoms of depression before the birth of
their baby.
Society’s view of pregnancy as something to be
happy about and to be enjoyed can make it even
harder for women to admit to depression or to ask
for help. Women who suffered from depression prior
to pregnancy might assume that drug treatments are
contraindicated in pregnancy and that there is no
point in them mentioning it to their carers.
Known risk factors for antenatal and postnatal
depression include those common to all patients

203

Medical disorders in pregnancy
suffering from depression, and some that are spec­
ific to pregnancy (Fig. 36.7). The symptoms of
depression are:
Persistently low mood.
Anhedonia.
Loss of appetite.
Insomnia or hypersomnia.
Psychomotor agitation or retardation.
Thoughts of self-harm.
Anxiety (postnatally this might relate particularly
to the baby, with worries of not being able to care
for the baby or to love it enough).

Postnatal depression is an
important diagnosis and is
common affecting around 1 in
10 women.

True postnatal depression, where symptoms are
present for more than 2 weeks, affects around 1 in
10 women and should be distinguished from the
‘baby blues’, which lasts for a few days and is
experienced by up to 70% of women. Once
recognized, treatment should be started without
delay as most antidepressants will not have an
effect for 6 weeks. Good support is vital and hosp­
italization is sometimes necessary. In severe cases,
electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) might be used.

Drug therapy
The older tricyclic antidepressants can cause drow­
siness and antimuscarinic side-effects, such as dry
mouth and constipation, but they have been used
for years with no problems being seen for the fetus
or, when breastfeeding, for the baby. However,
depression outside pregnancy is often treated with
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such
as sertraline (Lustral™), fluoxetine (Prozac™) and
paroxetine (Seroxat™), so women will seek advice as
to whether they should change their medication in
pregnancy.
Sertraline has been shown to be potentially
harmful to the fetus in animal studies but seems
to be safe in breastfeeding. The other SSRIs show
no evidence of teratogenicity in animal studies but
the manufacturers advise that they are avoided in
pregnancy unless the benefit of their use outweighs
the risk. Fluoxetine (Prozac™) shows high amounts
in breast milk, so should be avoided, and the
manufacturers of paroxetine (Seroxat™) advise that it
is avoided unless the benefit outweighs the risk.
In conclusion, the choice of antidepressant treatment
in pregnancy and during breastfeeding should be made
on a case-by-case basis, actively involving the patient in
the process and discussing the risks and benefits.

Puerperal psychosis
This disorder is seen most often in women who
have a history of psychiatric illness (40% of women
with bipolar disorder will develop a puerperal
psychosis) but this is not always the case. It usually
develops between 2 days and 3 weeks after the
birth. The woman exhibits symptoms of mania,
with accompanying delusional thoughts and
visual or auditory hallucinations. The delusions
and hallucinations might pertain to the baby and
sometimes manifest as a desire to harm the baby, so a
careful risk assessment must be made.
Admission to hospital is necessary – if possible to a
specialized mother and baby unit. Treatment consists
of antipsychotic medications. Breastfeeding should
be avoided if at all possible while the mother is taking
these because animal studies suggest possible adverse
effects on the baby’s developing nervous system. The
risk of recurrence in future pregnancies is up to 50%.

Bipolar disorder
The main problem with this condition is that the
drugs used as maintenance therapy (carbamazepine

Thromboembolism
and lithium) are teratogenic. The risks associated
with carbamazepine can be reduced to an extent
by taking 5 mg of folic acid before conception and
for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, but detailed
anomaly scanning is important. Lithium has a
narrow therapeutic:toxic ratio and close monitoring
of lithium levels is needed during pregnancy as
dose requirements increase in the second and third
trimesters, but they then come rapidly back to
normal. High maternal levels at the time of delivery
lead to the danger of toxicity in the neonate.
The most likely time for acute episodes of mania
to occur is not during the pregnancy but in the
puerperium. Close liaison between psychiatric
and obstetric care providers will be very important.
Breastfeeding while taking carbamazepine is safe
but lithium is present in breast milk and can lead to
toxicity in the infant. Acute episodes are treated with
anti-psychotics (see below for their use in pregnancy
and with breastfeeding).

Schizophrenia
Women who conceive when on the older antipsychotic
drugs can be reassured that the risks to the baby from
the medication are not high, although extrapyramidal
side-effects are sometimes seen in the neonate. The
manufacturers of other newer drugs advise their use
only if the benefit outweighs the risk in pregnancy;
others are to be avoided entirely if possible.
It is known that women with schizophrenia are
more prone to preterm labour and that their babies
have a higher than average risk of in utero growth
retardation. All of these factors should be discussed
carefully with the woman and careful liaison with her
psychiatric carers is vital.
During the puerperium the woman is particularly
vulnerable to exacerbations, so close support and
observation is necessary during this time. Breastfeeding
whilst on anti-psychotic medication is not advisable.

Drug and Alcohol
Dependence
The misuse of drugs and alcohol is linked with poor
obstetric outcome in many different ways. The keystone of
obstetric care is to try to establish a link with the woman
so that she will attend for antenatal appointments, but
the involvement of drug liaison teams, paediatricians and
social services may also be necessary.

36

Careful explanation of the risks for the fetus is
necessary (see Chapter 45) and plans for a withdrawal
programme should be drawn up if the woman agrees.
Intravenous drug use should prompt discussion of
screening for HIV and hepatitis B and C. Many centres
have a named midwife with expertise in this area who
will be a link between the hospital, social worker and
the mother.

Thromboembolism
Pulmonary embolism (PE) is the most common
pregnancy-related cause of death in the UK, so
thromboembolism is to be taken extremely seriously
in pregnancy. The underlying problem is that
pregnancy is a hypercoaguable state, with increased
levels of clotting factors and fibrinogen, decreased
fibrinolysis and decreased levels of antithrombin;
this state continues for at least 6 weeks postpartum.
The added effects of venous pooling and increased
abdominal pressure mean that pregnancy increases
a woman’s risk of a thromboembolic event by six
times. Delivery by caesarean section raises the risk
still further, by ten to twenty times, giving the risk
of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) after
an emergency caesarean section of 1–2%. The risk
factors are summarized in Fig. 36.8.

Don’t forget the increased risk
of thromboembolism related
to pregnancy starts in the first
trimester and continues for 6 weeks postpartum.

Medical disorders in pregnancy
The diagnosis of thromboembolism on the basis
of history and examination alone is more difficult
in pregnancy. Signs and symptoms are less reliable.
Leg oedema (which can be due to DVT) and breath­
lessness (which might be due to PE) are both
common symptoms in pregnancy. The best advice is
to have a high index of suspicion and to employ the
investigations described below.
Cerebral vein thrombosis is very uncommon but
is associated with high mortality; it usually occurs
in the puerperium. Once again it can be difficult to
make the diagnosis on clinical grounds; the picture is
confused, with the woman suffering from fits (raising
the suspicion of eclampsia), fever, vomiting and
photophobia (suggesting meningitis).

Investigation
The diagnosis of DVT is best made using Doppler
ultrasound unless the clot is above the inguinal
ligament, in which case venography is the investi­
gation of choice. The investigation of PE should
include arterial blood gases, which show hypoxaemia
and hypocapnia, ECG and chest X-ray.
The chest X-ray might be normal or might show
an area of infarction or effusion. In non-pregnant
patients a V/Q scan, showing ventilation and
perfusion, or a spiral CT scan is performed to confirm
the diagnosis. Although the dose of radiation is not
contraindicated in pregnancy, it might be possible to
reduce exposure by making the diagnosis on the basis
of a perfusion scan alone. If, however, the original
chest X-ray was abnormal, a ventilation scan will be
necessary. The diagnosis of cerebral thrombosis is
best made with MRI scanning.

Management
Pending the confirmation of the diagnosis of PE or
DVT, the safest course of action is to anticoagulate.
There is an ongoing discussion of the merits of
intravenous heparin infusion compared with inter­
mittent low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).
LMWH is used extensively by physicians for treating
DVT and PE but is still unproven for treatment in
pregnancy. It is known that larger doses of intravenous
heparin are needed in pregnancy to achieve the target
of prolonging the activated partial thromboplastin
time (APTT) by 1.5–2 times the control.
Treatment generally is with LMWH; warfarin is
avoided because of its teratogenicity and the risk of

206

maternal retroplacental bleeding and fetal intracerebral
bleeds. Anticoagulation must be continued through
labour and for 6 weeks postpartum.
Warfarin and heparin are both safe in breast­
feeding, so some women might opt to switch to
warfarin; the disadvantage is the frequent blood
testing at first, but chronic treatment with heparin is
not without its side-effects (see below).

Neither heparin nor insulin cross the
placenta.

Prophylaxis against
thromboembolism in pregnancy
As is stated above, pregnancy itself is a major risk
factor for thromboembolism. Some women have
added risk factors and need the protection of
prophylaxis. Women with a history of thromboemb­
olism or a strong family history should be screened
before pregnancy or in the first trimester. The duration
and type of prophylaxis depends on the degree of
the risk (Fig. 36.9).
Treatment with heparin for long periods of time
results in bone demineralization, which can lead to
vertebral fractures. As pregnancy and breastfeeding
also cause demineralization, the rate of symptomatic
osteoporosis in women on long-term therapy could
be as high as 2%, although bone density does impr­
ove once therapy is stopped.

Thyroid disorders
A rarer, but dangerous side-effect of heparin is
thrombocytopaenia. The risks of these side-effects
are thought to be lower with LMWH. Women on
maintenance heparin have monthly platelet counts
and clotting screens and, if therapy is for longer
than 10 weeks in total, a dual-energy X-ray absorptio­
metry (DEXA) scan should be performed postna­
tally to assess bone loss. Low-dose aspirin is safe in
pregnancy.
As operative delivery increases the risk of throm­
boembolism dramatically, prophylaxis is also given
after caesarean section to some women, in the form
of heparin and/or TED stockings.

Thyroid Disorders

Hyperthyroidism
Hyperthyroidism affects 1 in 500 pregnant women.
Most of them are hyperthyroid because they have
Graves’ disease, an autoimmune condition. Affected
women often have a family history. Some of the
symptoms and signs are akin to those of pregnancy,
but the first three listed in Fig. 36.10 should raise the
suspicion of thyroid disease. Investigation reveals
raised free T4 and low levels of thyroid stimulating
hormone (TSH) in comparison with the normal
range for that stage of pregnancy.
Like other autoimmune conditions, thyrotoxicosis
often improves in pregnancy, but the deterioration
in the puerperium might therefore be more marked.
If untreated in pregnancy, thyrotoxicosis can pre­
dispose to miscarriage, IUGR, premature labour and
increased perinatal morbidity, and the danger of
thyroid storm. In 1–2%, thyroid antibodies cross the
placenta and cause fetal and neonatal thyrotoxicosis.
This is more likely to happen if control is poor in the

third trimester, and carries a risk of 15% neonatal
mortality if untreated.

Management
Treatment is with carbimazole or propylthiouracil.
Both drugs cross the placenta and in high doses can
result in fetal hypothyroidism. Efficacy of treatment is
monitored with free T4 levels every trimester. Women
with Graves’ disease should have serial ultrasound
scanning looking for evidence of fetal thyrotoxicosis
in the form of IUGR, goitre or fetal tachycardia. If the
condition is diagnosed, increased doses of antithyroid
drugs are administered to the mother. All neonates
born to mothers with Graves’ disease should have
cord blood sent for thyroid function tests.
Antithyroid drugs are secreted in breast milk
in small amounts, so the thyroid function of all
breastfed babies should be monitored.

Hypothyroidism
Hypothyroidism is seen in about 1% of antenatal
patients. New diagnosis in pregnancy is made more
difficult by the fact that many of the symptoms are
similar to those of normal pregnancy; the first three
features shown in Fig. 36.11 are the most useful when
trying to discriminate.
Fortunately, new diagnosis in pregnancy is
unusual, and the management of hypothyroidism
mainly consists of the care of women who are already
on replacement therapy.
Most cases are due to autoimmune destruction of
the thyroid – in this process the thyroid gland can
atrophy or enlarge, forming a goitre. When a goitre
is present the condition is known as Hashimoto’s
thyroiditis. Other cases are related to drug use (e.g.
lithium, amiodarone) or to previous thyroidectomy.

Medical disorders in pregnancy
The diagnosis is confirmed by a low T4 level (normal
ranges for different stages of pregnancy are used).
TSH will be raised. A test for thyroid autoantibodies
might be sent.
Untreated hypothyroidism leads to a higher risk of:
•
•
•
•

Miscarriage.
Fetal loss.
Pre-eclampsia.
IUGR.

It might also be related to lower intelligence in the
child.
Well-controlled hypothyroidism does not affect
maternal or fetal outcome except the rare cases of
fetal and neonatal hypothyroidism, where TSHreceptor-blocking antibodies cross the placenta
resulting in impaired neurological development.
Thyroxine replacement does not affect fetal thyroid
function, and seldom needs adjustment during
pregnancy if the dose was correct prior to pregnancy.
Pregnant women receiving thyroxine replacement
should have thyroid function checked once in each
trimester, and, if the dose is altered, 4 weeks after any
alteration.

Postpartum thyroiditis
It is estimated that this condition affects 5–11% of
postpartum women. Those with a family history of
hypothyroidism are particularly at risk. It is caused
by an autoimmune thyroiditis, which results in an
imbalance of thyroid hormones – the state resulting
can be hypothyroid, hyperthyroid or a biphasic pattern
of first hyperthyroidism and then hypothyroidism.
Symptoms are often vague (e.g. fatigue, palpitations,

208

lethargy, depression) and can be attributed (by the
woman and her GP) to her recovery from childbirth
and the demands of a new baby. It usually occurs
around 12 weeks postpartum. Investigation is first
with biochemistry, to confirm thyroid malfunction.
A radioactive iodine scan can be done to distinguish
postpartum thyroiditis from Graves’ disease.
Treatment is not always necessary; the condition
is usually self-limiting and treatment will not speed
recovery, although it will relieve troublesome symp­
toms. Overactive symptoms can be treated with
β-blockers, underactive symptoms with thyroxine
replacement. However, 3–4% of women will remain
permanently hypothyroid, requiring replacement
therapy, and around one-third will be euthyroid
for a few years but then develop permanent hypo­
thyroidism. Recurrence in future pregnancies is
common.

Thyroid nodules
These are present in about 1% of women of child­
bearing age and are noteworthy because up to 30%
might be malignant, so nodules must be investigated
with fine needle aspiration or biopsy.

Plan the antenatal care of a woman with a multiple pregnancy
Describe the intrapartum management of a twin pregnancy
Consider the potential advantages and disadvantages of selective fetal reduction.

A multiple pregnancy is one in which two or more
fetuses are present, that is, it is not a singleton
pregnancy.
Multiple pregnancies are important to the obstetrician
because they represent a high-risk pregnancy. The risk
of all pregnancy complications is greater than in a
singleton pregnancy, in particular preterm labour
and IUGR (see Chapter 41). Perinatal mortality for
a multiple pregnancy is about six times greater than
that of a singleton.

• A multiple pegnancy is a high-risk
pregnancy.
• Perinatal mortality rate is increased 6
times compared with a single fetus, mainly due to
the risk of preterm delivery.

Incidence of Multiple
Pregnancy
The most common type of multiple pregnancy
is a twin pregnancy, with an incidence of 1 in 80
pregnancies. The incidence of spontaneous triplets is
1 in 802 or 1 in 6400. The incidence of any multiple
pregnancy increases with:
• Increasing maternal age.
• Increasing parity.

• Ethnic variation.
• Improved nutrition.
• Assisted conception.
The latter accounts for a significant rise over the last
two decades, especially in Western countries. Fig.
37.1 shows the ethnic variation in the frequency of
multiple pregnancy.

Diagnosis of Multiple
Pregnancy
Nowadays, multiple pregnancies are normally
diagnosed by routine dating ultrasound scan at
12–14 weeks gestation. The diagnosis should be
excluded in a patient who presents with hyperemesis
gravidarum. Clinical examination of the patient
reveals a large-for-dates uterus (see Chapter 12) or the
clinician will be able to palpate multiple fetal parts
in later pregnancy (Fig. 37.2).

Aetiology of Multiple
Pregnancy

Twins
The majority of twins (75%) are dizygotic, that is
they arise from the fertilization of two ova by two
sperm. Monozygotic twins (25%) arise following the
fertilization of a single ovum by a single sperm which

A single ovum is fertilized by a single sperm and the
zygote divides into two. This may occur at different
stages of embryonic development, giving rise to
different structural arrangements of the membranes
(Fig. 37.3).
About two-thirds of monozygotic twins have
monochorionic diamniotic placentation, that is
a single blastocyst implants, developing a single
chorion; the inner cell mass divides into two so that
each embryo has its own amnion.
A third of monozygotic twins establish at an
earlier stage than this, at the eight-cell stage, so
that two separate blastocysts form and implant.
These twins will thus have dichorionic diamniotic
placentation.
The least common type of monozygotic twins
occurs by later splitting of the inner cell mass,
before the appearance of the primitive streak, to
produce a single amniotic cavity – monochorionic
monoamniotic twins. Splitting even later than this
results in conjoint twins.
The incidence of monozygotic twins is constant
around the world, at about 4 per 1000 births.

same genetic make-up.
However, the clinically important issue is the
chorionicity of the pregnancy. This relates to the
placentation. If the placentae are separate, with
separate amnions and chorions (dichorionic
diamniotic twins), the blood supply to each fetus
during the pregnancy is independent.
Conversely, if there are blood vessel anastomoses
between the placentae (monochorionic diamniotic
twins or monochorionic monoamniotic twins),
then there is a risk of uneven distribution of blood.
This may result in discordant growth, with one
twin showing signs of growth restriction and the
other getting larger (see below). Thus diagnosing
chorionicity determines the level of surveillance
necessary in that particular pregnancy.

Dizygotic twins
Two ova from the same or different ovaries are
released simultaneously and fertilized by two separate
sperm. Each fetus has its own chorion, amnion and
placenta – dichorionic diamniotic placentation. If
implantation occurs close together, the placentas can
become fused. Therefore, these twins can be of the
same or different sexes and will have different genetic
constitutions, i.e. they have no more similarities than
any siblings.
The incidence of dizygotic twins varies widely
between different populations, probably for

210

Triplets
Pregnancies of higher-order multiples (i.e. three
or more fetuses) are less commonly formed by
separate ova. In the case of a triplet pregnancy,
there are usually two ova one of which splits as
described above to form a monochorionic pair of
twins.
In such a pregnancy, and especially one of higher
order, it is appropriate to counsel the parents
about selective fetal reduction (see below). The
chorionicity of the pregnancy must be known to

select the appropriate fetus. The procedure cannot
be performed on a monochorionic twin because it
shares placental circulation with its co-twin and
therefore the drugs would affect both fetuses.

Diagnosis of chorionicity
Antenatally
Ultrasound assessment of the membrane dividing
the amniotic sacs diagnoses the chorionicity; this
must be done before 16 weeks gestation. Fig. 37.4
shows the thicker insertion of the membrane, known
as the lambda sign, that is found in a dichorionic
pregnancy. In contrast, the thinner T sign is seen
in a monochorionic pregnancy. If there is no
dividing membrane between the fetuses, they are
monochorionic monoamniotic twins.
Fetal sex can also be assessed by ultrasound. If
they are discordant, then the pregnancy must be
dichorionic. Localization of the placental sites is also
important. If the placentae can be seen completely
separately, then similarly, the pregnancy must be
dichorionic.

Postnatally
At this stage, chorionicity can be determined by:
• Macroscopic and microscopic examination of
membranes.
• Analysis of red-blood-cell markers.
• DNA probes.

Complications of Multiple
Pregnancy
A multiple pregnancy must be treated as a highrisk pregnancy. The majority of pregnancy-related
complications are more common in multiple
pregnancies. There are also certain problems that are
specific to multiple pregnancies.

The mother is at risk of any complication
associated with a singleton pregnancy but
the risks are increased.

dichorionic diamniotic pregnancy.

Fetal malformations

Preterm labour

The frequency of fetal malformations is thought to be
almost double in a twin pregnancy compared with a
singleton pregnancy, especially for monochorionic
twins (4% cf. 2%). In terms of screening for
chromosomal anomalies (see Chapter 33), parents
must be counselled about the possibility of a greater
risk of pregnancy loss than in a singleton pregnancy
with an invasive procedure. Separate sampling must
be performed with dichorionic twins. There is also the
potential dilemma of finding an abnormality in only
one fetus; this occurs in about 80% of cases. Selective
fetocide can result in the miscarriage of the apparently
normal fetus as well as the abnormal one.

Spontaneous preterm labour occurs in 30% of twin
pregnancies (Fig. 37.5). There is some evidence to
suggest that cervical length screening by transvaginal
ultrasound may be a useful screening tool. In higherorder multiple pregnancies, some physicians opt to put
in an elective cervical suture at the start of the second
trimester, to reduce the risk of preterm labour.
If pre-term labour is diagnosed, tocolytics should
be considered to allow in utero transfer to a hospital
with neonatal intensive care facilities and to allow
time for steroids administered to the mother to
improve lung maturation (see Chapter 41).

Pregnancy-induced hypertension
Antenatal assessment of fetal
well-being and growth
In a high-risk pregnancy, antenatal care should be
more frequent, managed by a hospital consultant in
a unit with facilities for regular ultrasound scans to
check fetal growth and neonatal care facilities in case
of preterm labour and delivery.
In a multiple pregnancy, serial ultrasounds
are usually performed every 2 to 4 weeks to
exclude intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR).
This is especially important in pregnancies with
monochorionic placentation, which are at greater
risk of discordant growth between the fetuses and the
development of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome
(see below).

212

Hypertension is about three times more common in
multiple pregnancies than in singleton pregnancies
because of the larger size of the placental bed (see
Chapter 35). It often develops earlier and is more
severe.

Intrapartum management of a twin pregnancy

Antepartum haemorrhage
The incidence of placental abruption and placenta
praevia can be increased in multiple pregnancies.

Twin-to-twin transfusion
syndrome (TTTS)
This occurs in 15% of monochorionic diamniotic
twin pregnancies – blood is shunted across placental
interfetal vascular anastomoses, such that the
donor becomes anaemic and growth restricted,
with oligohydramnios, and the recipient becomes
plethoric with polyhydramnios. This syndrome
usually occurs in the second trimester. It results in
fetal death in up to 80% of cases and a 10% risk of
handicap in the surviving twin.
Various treatment options exist. Some centres
have performed amniodrainage and septostomy, i.e.
taking off some of the excess fluid under ultrasound
guidance and making a hole in the dividing
membrane. Other groups advocate laser treatment to
the placental anastomoses to reduce the discordant
blood flow between the fetuses.
With monochorionic placentation, fetal death
of a twin in utero puts the surviving twin at risk
of neurological damage and the mother at risk of
developing DIC as thromboplastins are released into
the circulation. The pregnancy can usually be managed
conservatively until the surviving twin reaches a
gestation with improved likelihood of survival. 80%
of surviving twins can be delivered vaginally.

The psychological sequelae of a multiple
pregnancy on the mother and her family,
including existing children, should be
remembered.

Intrapartum Management
of a Twin Pregnancy
Fig. 37.6 summarizes the management of a vaginal
delivery in a twin pregnancy.

Delivery of twin pregnancy
Delivery of multiple pregnancies should be managed
in a unit with neonatal intensive care facilities. For

PPH

a twin pregnancy, the mode of delivery depends on
the presentation of the first twin; if it is anything
other than cephalic, caesarean section is usually
the method of choice. In the case of higher-order
multiple pregnancies, delivery is almost always by
caesarean section.
In a twin pregnancy, if the first twin presents as
cephalic and there are no other complications, a
vaginal delivery is usually planned. The onset of
labour can be spontaneous or induced; induction
might be advised for similar reasons to a singleton
pregnancy (e.g. post dates) or for an indication
more specific to a twin pregnancy, such as IUGR.
The woman needs intravenous access and a sample
of serum saved in the blood transfusion laboratory
because of the risk of post-partum haemorrhage (see
below). An epidural block is often recommended to
allow for possible manipulation of the second twin
in the second stage of labour.
Both fetal heart rates should be monitored
continuously, either per abdomen or with a fetal
scalp electrode on the first twin. If there is an
abnormality in the heart rate pattern of twin one,
fetal blood sampling might be appropriate (see
Chapter 15). A problem with twin two should lead to
immediate delivery by caesarean section. The reasons
for augmentation of labour and for instrumental
delivery are similar to those in a singleton pregnancy
(see Chapter 40).
Once the first twin is delivered, the lie and
presentation of the second twin must be determined
by abdominal palpation and ultrasound. External
cephalic version can be used to establish a longitudinal
lie. Intravenous syntocinon might be necessary to
maintain uterine contractions and the delivery of the
second twin occurs either as a cephalic presentation

213

Multiple pregnancy
or by breech extraction. Again the reasons for
instrumental delivery or caesarean section are similar
to those of a singleton pregnancy.

Complications
Post-partum haemorrhage
Post-partum haemorrhage (PPH; see Chapter 42)
is more likely with a multiple pregnancy than
a singleton because of the larger placental site.
Uterine atony due to the increased volume of the
uterine contents – two fetuses, placentae, etc. – is a
contributing factor. Active management of the third
stage of labour is therefore appropriate including
routine use of a post-partum syntocinon infusion.

Locked twins
This is a very rare complication of vaginal deliveries.
The delivery proceeds with the first twin presenting as
a breech but the aftercoming head of the first twin is
prevented from entering the pelvis by the head of the
cephalic-presenting second twin. If this is diagnosed
in the first stage of labour, a caesarean section should
be performed; during the second stage, general
anaesthesia is necessary to allow manipulation.

Higher-Order Multiple
Pregnancies
In comparison to twin pregnancies, higher-order
multiples are associated with a higher perinatal
mortality rate and an increased incidence of the

214

antenatal complications mentioned above. Fertility
treatments have increased the numbers of high-order
pregnancies and, in the case of IVF, guidelines in the
UK now advise that a maximum of two embryos
should be replaced in a woman under the age of 40
(see Chapter 30).

Selective fetocide (multifetal
pregnancy reduction)
Selective fetocide is a technique in which intracardiac
potassium chloride is given to one or more fetuses in
a high-order multiple pregnancy under ultrasound
guidance. The aim is to improve the outcome of
the remaining fetuses by reducing the risks of
late miscarriage and preterm labour. It is usually
performed at 12–14 weeks gestation. Despite the
procedure-related risk of miscarriage of about 6%,
the incidence of complications is low. However,
ethical dilemmas arise with respect to abortion in
general, as well as possible miscarriage of the entire
pregnancy.

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
•
•
•
•
•

Define the onset of labour
Describe the normal delivery of the fetus
Understand that normal progress in labour is multifactorial
Assess failure to progress in labour
Describe the benefits and side effects of pharmacological methods of analgesia in labour.

Labour is divided into three stages:
• First stage: from the onset of established labour
until the cervix is fully dilated.
• Second stage: from full dilatation until the fetus
is born.
• Third stage: from the birth of the fetus until
delivery of the placenta and membranes.

Onset of Labour
Prior to the onset of labour, painless intermittent
uterine tightenings, known as Braxton Hicks
contractions, become increasingly frequent. As the
presenting part becomes engaged, the uterine fundus
descends, reducing upper abdominal discomfort,
and pressure in the pelvis increases. The signs and
symptoms that define the actual onset of labour are:
• Painful regular contractions.
• A ‘show’ (passage of a mucoid plug from the
cervix, often blood-stained).
• Rupture of the membranes.
• Cervical dilatation and effacement.
Labour is diagnosed when there are regular painful
contractions in the presence of a fully effaced cervix,
which is 4 cm or more dilated, with or without a
show or ruptured membranes.
The exact cause of the onset of labour is not known.
To some degree it is thought to be mechanical, since
preterm labour is seen more commonly in circumstances
in which the uterus is overstretched, such as multiple
pregnancies and polyhydramnios. Inflammatory

markers such as cytokines, and prostaglandins might
play a role. The latter are thought to be present in the
decidua and membranes in late pregnancy and are
released if the cervix is digitally stretched at term to
separate the membranes (a cervical sweep).

Progress in Labour
Once the diagnosis of labour has been made, progress
is assessed by monitoring:
• Uterine contractions.
• Dilatation of the cervix.
• Descent of the presenting part.
The rate of cervical dilatation is expected to be approx
1cm/h in a nulliparous woman and 1–2 cm/hour in a
multiparous woman. A partogram is commonly used
to chart the observations made in labour (Fig. 38.1)
and to highlight slow progress, particularly a delay in
cervical dilatation or failure of the presenting part to
descend (see Chapter 14).
Progress is determined by three factors:
• Passages.
• Passenger.
• Power.

Passages
Bony pelvis
The pelvis is made up of four bones:
• Two innominate bones.
• Sacrum.
• Coccyx.

The passage that these bones make can be divided
into inlet, cavity and outlet (Fig. 38.2). The pelvic
inlet is bounded by the pubic crest, the iliopectineal
line and the sacral promontory. It is oval in shape,
with its wider diameter being transverse. The cavity
of the pelvis is round in shape. The pelvic outlet is
bounded by the lower border of the pubic symphysis,
the ischial spines and the tip of the sacrum.
Again the shape is oval, but the wider diameter is
anteroposterior (Fig. 38.3).
When a woman stands upright, the pelvis tilts
forward. The inlet makes an angle of about 55° with
the horizontal; this varies between individuals and

216

different ethnic groups. The presenting part of the
fetus must negotiate the axis of the birth canal with
the change of direction occurring by rotation at the
pelvic floor.

Soft tissues
The soft passages consist of:
•
•
•
•
•

Uterus (upper and lower segments).
Cervix.
Pelvic floor.
Vagina.
Perineum.

The upper uterine segment is responsible for the
propulsive contractions that deliver the fetus. The
lower segment is the part of the uterus that lies
between the uterovesical fold of the peritoneum
and the cervix. It develops gradually during the third
trimester, and then more rapidly during labour.
It incorporates the cervix as it effaces, to allow the
presenting part to descend.
The pelvic floor consists of the levator ani group of
muscles, including pubococcygeus and iliococcygeus

arising from the bony pelvis to form a muscular
diaphragm along with the internal obturator
muscle and piriformis muscle (see Chapter 28). As
the presenting part of the fetus is pushed out of the
uterus it passes into the vagina, which has become
hypertrophied during pregnancy. It reaches the pelvic
floor, which acts like a gutter to direct it forwards and
allow rotation. The perineum is distal to this and
stretches as the head passes below the pubic arch and
delivers.

217

Labour

Passenger
The fetal skull consists of the face and the cranium.
The cranium is made up of two parietal bones, two
frontal bones and the occipital bone, held together
by a membrane that allows movement. Up until
early childhood, these bones are not fused and so
can overlap to allow the head to pass through the
pelvis during labour; this overlapping of the bones is
known as moulding.
Fig. 38.4 shows the anatomy of the fetal skull,
including the sutures between the bones, and the
fontanelles. These are important landmarks that
can be felt on vaginal examination and enable the
position of the fetus to be assessed (Figs 46.13 and
46.14). The position is described in terms of the
occiput in a cephalic presentation, and the sacrum in
a breech presentation.
The size and position of the fetal skull determine
the ease with which the fetus passes through the birth
canal. Fig. 38.5 shows the diameters of the fetal skull.
The diameter that presents during labour depends on
the degree of flexion of the head. Thus the smallest
diameters for delivery are the suboccipitobregmatic
diameter which represents a flexed vertex presen­
tation, and the submentobregmatic diameter,
which corresponds to a face presentation. The widest
diameter is mentovertical, a brow presentation, which
usually precludes vaginal delivery.

Power
The myometrial component of the uterus acts as the
power to deliver the fetus. It consists of three layers:

�

• Thin outer longitudinal layer.
• Thin inner circular layer.
• Thick middle spiral layer.
From early pregnancy, the uterus contracts painlessly
and intermittently (Braxton Hicks contractions).
These contractions increase after the 36th week
until the onset of labour. In labour, a contraction
starts from the junction of the fallopian tube and the
uterus on each side, spreading down and across the
uterus with its greatest intensity in the upper uterine
segment.
During labour, the contractions are monitored
for:
• Intensity.
• Frequency.
• Duration.
The resting tone of the uterus is about 6–12 mmHg;
to be effective in labour this increases to an intensity
of 40–60 mmHg. There are usually three or four
coordinated contractions every 10 minutes, each
lasting approx 60 s, in order to progress in labour.
In the second stage of labour, additional power
comes from voluntary contraction of the diaphragm
and the abdominal muscles as the mother pushes to
assist delivery.

Mechanism of Normal
Delivery: Action of the Uterus
The myometrium acts like all muscle, that is, it
contracts and relaxes, but it also has the ability to

retract so that the fibres become progressively shorter.
This effect is seen in the upper segment muscle:
progressive retraction causes the lower segment to
stretch and thin out, resulting in effacement and
dilatation of the cervix (Fig. 38.6).

Delivery of the Fetus
Active contractions of the uterus of increasing
strength, frequency and duration cause passive
movement of the fetus down the birth canal. At the
beginning of labour, the fetus usually engages in the

occipito-transverse or occipito-anterior position. As
labour progresses (Fig. 38.7), the neck becomes fully
flexed so that the suboccipitobregmatic diameter is
presenting (see above).
As descent occurs, internal rotation brings the
occiput into the anterior position when it reaches the
pelvic floor. In the second stage of labour, the occiput
descends below the symphysis pubis (Fig. 38.8) and
delivers by extension. Increasing extension round the
pubic bone delivers the face (Fig. 38.9).
Delivery of the head brings the shoulders into the
pelvic cavity in the transverse diameter, with the head
oblique to the line of the shoulders. External rotation
or restitution occurs: the head rotates in relation

to the shoulders (Fig. 38.10). Finally, continuing
descent and rotation of the shoulders brings their
widest diameter (the bisacromial diameter) into
the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet.
This enables the anterior shoulder to pass under the
pubis, usually assisted by gentle downward traction
on the head. Lateral flexion of the fetus delivers the
posterior shoulder and the rest of the body follows
(Fig. 38.11).

Fig. 38.7 Early labour. There has been flexion of the fetal head.
The cervix is effacing and has begun to dilate.

Mechanism of delivery of the head:
• Flexion.
• Internal rotation.
• Extension.
• External rotation (restitution).

Management of the First
Stage of Labour
When a patient presents in the first stage of labour,
routine assessment includes:

Fig. 38.8 The second stage of labour. The head has undergone internal
rotation to bring the occiput into the anterior position. The cervix is fully
dilated.

• Mother: pulse, blood pressure, temperature,
urinalysis, analgesia requirements.
• Fetus: fetal heart rate pattern (see Chapter 15).
• Abdominal palpation: fetal size, lie, presentation,
engagement.
• Contractions: frequency, duration, intensity.
• Vaginal examination: degree of cervical
effacement, cervical dilatation, station of
presenting part in relation to ischial spines,
position of presenting part, presence of caput or
moulding.
• Liquor: clear, blood-stained, presence of
meconium.
Engagement and station are illustrated in Figs 46.4
and 46.11 respectively.

The patient is encouraged to mobilize if possible
and is allowed to eat, depending on her risk of
needing an operative procedure. There is delayed
gastric emptying during pregnancy and labour.
Therefore if an emergency general anaesthetic is
needed, there is an increased risk of inhalation

of regurgitated acid stomach contents, causing
Mendelson’s syndrome.
The need for analgesia during labour varies
markedly between different women, different ethnic
groups and depending on their antenatal preparation.
Non-pharmacological techniques include the
use of psychoprophylaxis, hypnosis, massage and
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS).
The pharmacological methods are summarized in
Fig. 38.12.

Different degrees of fetal monitoring are appropriate,
depending on the clinical picture. For example, in a
high-risk pregnancy such as the presence of IUGR or
if there is meconium-stained liquor, then continuous
fetal monitoring is advisable (see Chapter 15). In
a low-risk pregnancy, intermittent monitoring –
either electronically or with a Pinard stethoscope –
might be sufficient, every 15 min during and after a
contraction.
In some patients, abdominal monitoring can be
difficult, for example, if the patient is obese, and so
a fetal scalp electrode can be applied directly once
the cervix dilates and the membranes are ruptured. If
monitoring suggests that the fetal heart rate pattern
is abnormal, it might be appropriate to measure the
fetal pH by taking a blood sample from the fetal scalp
(see Chapter 15).

Management of the Second
Stage of Labour
Once the cervix is fully dilated, the patient is
encouraged to use voluntary effort to push with the
contractions. If she has an epidural anaesthetic in situ
she might be unaware of an urge to push, and so a
further hour can be allowed for the presenting part to
descend with the contractions alone.
Delivery of the infant is conducted as a sterile
clean procedure, usually in the left lateral or dorsal

222

position. As the head descends, the perineum
distends and the anus dilates. Then the head crowns:
the biparietal diameter has passed through the pelvis
and there is no recession between contractions.
The attendant applies pressure on the perineum to
maintain flexion of the head and, once the occiput is
free, encourages extension to allow delivery. The neck
is felt to exclude the presence of the cord.
After external rotation, lateral flexion of the head
towards the anus dislodges the anterior shoulder with
the next contraction. Lifting the head in the opposite

38

Induction of labour
direction delivers the posterior shoulder. Holding the
shoulders, the rest of the body is delivered either onto
the bed or the mother’s abdomen. Finally, the cord is
divided and cut.
Shoulder dystocia is a problem of delivering
the shoulders once the head is out. This occurs
because the shoulders have failed to enter the pelvic
inlet, rather than a problem with the outlet or the
perineum. The important point is not to put excessive
traction on the fetal head to facilitate delivery since
this risks damage to the brachial plexus. The more
common injury is Erb’s palsy caused by damage to
nerve roots C4,5 and 6. Manoeuvres to aid delivery
include:
• McRoberts position - the hips are flexed in kneechest position in order to widen the pelvis
• suprapubic pressure to dislodge the anterior
shoulder
• internal rotation techniques to try and rotate the
baby
• deliver the posterior arm.

Induction of Labour

Definition
Induction of labour is the artificial initiation of
uterine contractions prior to spontaneous onset
resulting in delivery of the baby.

Indications
Management of the Third
Stage of Labour
Active management of the third stage has been shown
to reduce the incidence of postpartum haemorrhage
(see Chapter 42). Management involves:
• Using an oxytocic drug.
• Clamping and cutting the cord.
• Controlled cord traction.
In most units, syntocinon (5 units of oxytocin) is
given intramuscularly with delivery of the anterior
shoulder; it takes about 2–3 min to act. As the
placenta detaches from the uterine wall, the cut cord
will appear to lengthen. There is slight bleeding and
the fundus becomes hard. Brandt-Andrews’ method
of controlled cord traction is commonly used once
the placenta has separated to reduce the incidence
of uterine inversion (Fig. 38.13). The placenta and
membranes must be checked to ensure that they are
complete.
Finally, the vagina, labia and perineum are examined
for lacerations. The uterine fundus is palpated to check
that it is well contracted, approximately at the level
of the umbilicus. The estimated blood loss should be
recorded.

The rate of induction varies widely between different
units and even within different units. Figure 38.14
shows possible reasons for induction of labour,
maternal or fetal. In the UK, the most common
indication is prolonged pregnancy.

Methods
Prior to induction of labour, the favourability of the
cervix should be assessed. This is usually done by
using the Bishop score (Fig. 46.12); a higher score
suggests a more favourable cervix.

With regard to the Bishop score to assess
the cervix:
• Unfavourable cervix = hard, long,
closed, not effaced (low Bishop score).
• Favourable cervix = soft, beginning to dilate and
efface (high Bishop score).

Prostaglandins
Local application of a prostaglandin, usually prosta­
glandin E2, given as a vaginal gel, has been shown

and reduce the incidence of operative delivery when
compared to use of oxytocin alone. Used locally, the
gastrointestinal side-effects are minimized. NICE
guidelines have been produced to advise on the dose
of prostaglandin given, in order to reduce the risk of
uterine hyperstimulation.

Amniotomy
Artificial rupture of the membranes (ARM) is thought
to cause local release of endogenous prostaglandins.
It is done using an amnihook and may be part of
the induction process, or performed to accelerate
slow progress in labour. It can also be done with an
abnormal CTG to exclude meconium-staining of the
liquor, or to apply a fetal scalp electrode.

Oxytocin
An intravenous infusion of synthetic oxytocin
(syntocinon) is commonly used to induce labour,
to stimulate contractions after amniotomy or
spontaneous rupture of membranes. The dose must
be carefully titrated according to the strength and
frequency of the uterine contractions, and continuous
fetal monitoring is necessary.

Complications
Fig. 38.15 lists the possible complications associated
with the use of amniotomy and oxytocin.

Failure to Progress in Labour
As described in Chapter 15, progress in labour is
related to the passages, the passenger (i.e. baby) and
the power.

224

oxytocin.

Failure to progress related
to the bony pelvis
Abnormal bony shape
Antenatal X-ray pelvimetry and routine pelvic
assessment by vaginal examination are no longer
performed. However, certain points in a patient’s history
and examination can give clues to the likelihood of
failure to progress in labour (Fig. 38.16).

Cephalopelvic disproportion
With cephalopelvic disproportion (CPD), the size of
the pelvis is not in proportion to the fetus. It should
be suspected antenatally if the head does not engage
at term, particularly in a woman of short stature.
Usually, a trial of labour is still appropriate but in
some cases an elective caesarean section is planned.
During labour, CPD is diagnosed if the head
remains unengaged on abdominal palpation. This is

confirmed assessing station on vaginal examination
and by the presence of caput (swelling under the
fetal scalp caused by reduction in venous return) and
moulding.

Failure to progress related
to the soft tissues of the pelvis
Uterus
A uterine malformation, such as the presence of
a midline septum, might prevent the fetus from
lying longitudinally, so that a malpresentation is
responsible for failure to progress. This can also be
caused by uterine fibroids, which may increase in size
during pregnancy and obstruct labour. The presence
of a cervical fibroid might even necessitate caesarean
section.

Cervix
Failure of the cervix to dilate during labour despite
adequate uterine contractions is rarely secondary to
cervical scarring causing stenosis. This could be the
result of cervical amputation or cone biopsy.

Vagina
Congenital anomalies of the vagina rarely cause
problems with respect to labour and delivery, except
for patients who have had reconstructive surgery.
Other types of surgery, such as a colposuspension
for urinary stress incontinence or repair of a
vesicovaginal fistula, generally indicates the need
for an elective caesarean section at term, but more to
prevent recurrent symptoms rather than because of
possible slow progress in labour.

Vulva
Previous perineal tears or episiotomy should not
present difficulties during delivery. More problematic
is a female circumcision (FGM female genital
mutilation), which usually necessitates an anterior
episiotomy to prevent more severe tears and the risk
of fistula formation.

38

not cause slow progress in labour because they rise
up out of the pelvis as the uterus increases in size.

Failure to progress related
to the passenger
Fetal size
The possibility of a large infant might be suggested
by the patient’s past medical history, for example,
insulin-dependent diabetes or from the antenatal
history, with development of gestational diabetes or
hydrops fetalis, e.g. with rhesus isoimmunization or
parvovirus infection (see Chapter 12).
Abdominal palpation is not particularly accurate
as a method of diagnosing a large baby, although
it should be suspected if the presenting part fails
to engage in labour. Ultrasound is more accurate,
provided that gestational age has been correctly
estimated early in pregnancy. During labour, signs
of cephalopelvic disproportion may indicate a large
infant (see above).

Fetal abnormality
Routine ultrasound scanning is likely to diagnose
abnormalities such as a congenital goitre or a
lymphangioma. These extend the neck, resulting in a
face presentation. Abdominal enlargement such as in
the presence of ascites or an umbilical hernia may make
delivery difficult.
Abnormalities of the fetal skull such as anencephaly
should be suspected in labour if the head does not
engage and the sutures feel widely spaced on vaginal
examination.

Fetal malposition
Labour is more prolonged if the occiput is in the
posterior or transverse (OP or OT) position. This
can be determined abdominally by palpation of
fetal parts and confirmed on vaginal examination by
checking the positions of the sutures and fontanelles
(see Chapter 46).

Fetal malpresentation

Ovary

Malpresentation of the fetus is defined as a nonvertex presentation (see Chapter 39). This can be:

Ovarian cysts in pregnancy are usually incidental
findings at routine ultrasound. They can present
with abdominal pain during pregnancy, secondary
to torsion or haemorrhage (see Chapter 11). They do

Failure to progress related
to the power
Uterine palpation monitors frequency, duration and
intensity of the contractions. The cardiotocograph
checks the frequency and duration but the recording
of the intensity can be altered by position of the
monitor on the abdomen and maternal obesity. In
some centres, intrauterine pressure catheters are used
to monitor contraction pressure. Inefficient uterine
action can be diagnosed if labour is prolonged and
the contractions are:
•
•
•
•

Uncoordinated.
Fewer than 3–4 in 10 min.
Lasting less than 60 s.
Pressure less than 40 mmHg.

CPD and a malpresentation should be excluded.
Then, careful use of oxytocic drugs, most commonly
intravenous syntocinon infusion, can improve the
contractions. Caution must be taken to avoid too
frequent contractions because this can reduce the
oxygen exchange in the placental bed and lead to
fetal hypoxia. Continuous electronic monitoring is
advisable.

226

Particular care is essential in a multiparous patient
because the diagnosis of inefficient uterine action is
much less common than in a primiparous patient.
A fetal malposition, malpresentation or increased
fetal size should be considered as the causes of the
slow progress; inappropriate use of oxytocic drugs is
associated with uterine rupture in this group.

and malpositions
of the occiput

39

Objectives
• This chapter will explain the difference between malpresentation and malposition
of the occiput and the complications these may cause in labour
• You will understand the causes of malpresentation and malposition and their
management
• You will know how to manage a breech presentation at term.

Malpresentation
Any presentation other than a vertex presentation is
a malpresentation. The vertex is the area between the
parietal eminences and the anterior and posterior
fontanelles. The most common malpresentation is
the breech presentation but others include shoulder,
brow and face presentations.
Malpresentation can occur by chance but it can
also be caused by fetal or maternal conditions that
prevent the vertex from presenting to the pelvis
(Fig. 39.1). In all cases, management must begin
by exclusion of important conditions such as fetal
abnormality, pelvic masses and placenta praevia.

Breech presentation
Apart from the general causes of malpresentation,
breech presentation is particularly associated with
prematurity. The incidence of breech presentation
increases with decreasing gestation:
• Term: 3%.
• 32
 weeks: 15%.
• 28
 weeks: 25%.

Classification of breech presentation
There are three types of breech presentation:
• Extended or frank breech.
• Flexed
or complete breech.

• Footling
breech.

Just over half of breech presentations are extended and
the remainder are roughly equally divided between
flexed and footling. With an extended breech, the
hips are flexed and the knees extended with the feet

situated adjacent to the fetal head. Flexed and
footling breeches are flexed at both the hips and
knees, but in the latter the feet present to the maternal
pelvis not the breech (Fig. 39.2).

Diagnosis
The head can be felt as a hard lump at the uterine
fundus by the examiner and the patient. Auscultation
of the fetal heart at a higher level than is usual with
a cephalic presentation might suggest a breech
presentation, although this is not a reliable sign.
Vaginal examination can confirm the diagnosis,
although if there is any doubt ultrasound
examination is indicated, which will also determine
the type of breech presentation.

Complications
There is increased perinatal mortality and morbidity
associated with vaginal breech delivery when
compared with cephalic presentation of comparable
birthweight at term. This is usually associated with
difficulty in delivering the aftercoming head. The
fetal trunk is softer than the head and can pass
through a borderline pelvis, resulting in entrapment
of the aftercoming head. Moulding of the fetal head
as it passes through the pelvis can only occur after the
body has delivered and in a relatively short period of
time. Rapid compression and decompression of the
head during delivery can produce intracranial injury.
The presence of nuchal arms, that is when the fetal
arms are extended posteriorly behind the head and
sometimes crossed behind the head in the hollow of
the neck, reduces the available space for delivering

of antenatal assessment – clinical, radiological
or ultrasonic – will guarantee easy delivery of the
aftercoming head.

Perinatal mortality
Four major causes account for the increased perinatal
mortality associated with vaginal breech delivery.
The relative importance of these depends on the
gestational age of the fetus:
•
•
•
•

Prematurity.

Cord
prolapse.

Birth
trauma.

Congenital
anomaly.


Those term breech
presentations that are
unsuccessful at external
cephalic version are now usually delivered by
caesarean section. The perinatal morbidity and
mortality following vaginal breech delivery is
significantly higher than following caesarean section.

Cord prolapse may occur if the cervix is poorly
applied to the presenting part and is most likely
to occur with a footling breech (Fig. 39.3) and a
premature breech. Birth trauma is associated with
difficulty in delivery of the aftercoming head or softtissue injury due to excessive traction to the fetus.
The causes of death associated with birth trauma
following vaginal breech delivery include:
•
•
•
•
•

Intracranial
haemorrhage/tentorial tear.

Spinal
cord injury.

Soft
tissue injury.

Perinatal morbidity
Morbidity is also usually associated with difficulty
in delivering the aftercoming head. Although the
morbidity is distressing for all concerned with the
delivery, the neonate usually makes a complete
recovery. Typical injuries associated with vaginal

breech delivery include nerve palsies, fractures and

Management
There are three management options for a breech
presentation:
• External cephalic version (ECV).
• Elective
caesarean section.

• Planned
vaginal breech delivery.

Following the publication of a large, randomized,
prospective trial in the Lancet in 2000, the gold
standard management of a breech presentation at term
is delivery by caesarean section. This trial indicated
a significantly lower incidence of complications in
term breech babies born by caesarean section than
by the vaginal route. All women with a term breech
presentation should be offered external cephalic
version, preferably at around 37 weeks’ gestation.

External cephalic version
An attempt is made to turn the fetus to a cephalic
presentation by manual manipulation through
the maternal anterior abdominal wall. This is now
usually performed at around 37 weeks’ gestation, by
which time most breeches will have spontaneously
turned. Contraindications to ECV include:

•
•
•
•
•
•

mass.

haemorrhage.

Placenta
praevia.

Previous
caesarean section or hysterotomy.

Multiple
pregnancy.

Ruptured
membranes.


ECV can be performed with the aid of tocolytics,
to reduce uterine activity, and under ultrasound
control. It should be performed on the labour ward
because of the small risk of fetal distress requiring
immediate caesarean section (1:300). The fetus
can be rolled forwards or backwards and version is
successful in about half the cases. Extended breeches
are more difficult to turn because the legs ‘splint’
the fetus. Rhesus negative women should be given
anti-D immunoglobulin following attempted
version because of the possibility of fetomaternal
transfusion.

Antenatal assessment for vaginal
breech delivery
For those women who choose to undergo a trial of
vaginal breech delivery prior assessment should
include:
• Fetal size.
• The
maternal pelvis.

It is important to exclude a macrosomic fetus prior
to vaginal breech delivery and this is best done by
ultrasound estimated fetal weight (EFW). A fetus
with an EFW of greater than 3.8 kg is probably best
delivered by caesarean section. Ultrasound EFW
at term is associated with an error of at least 10%.
Measurement of the pelvic inlet and outlet is now best
performed using MRI which does not carry the same
risks as exposing the mother and fetus to X-rays.

Delivery should be in an obstetric unit with an
attendant paediatrician as vaginal breech delivery
should be regarded as high risk. Management of
the first stage of labour should be as for a vertex
presentation, although some obstetricians do not
advocate the use of syntocinon in the presence of
secondary arrest preferring to perform a caesarean
section. Continuous fetal heart rate monitoring
is recommended. Exclusion of cord prolapse is
mandatory when the membranes rupture or if the

229

Malpresentation and malpositions of the occiput
fetal heart rate pattern becomes abnormal. Epidural
anaesthesia is recommended because of the increased
level of manipulation during delivery. In only half
of planned vaginal breech deliveries will vaginal
delivery be successful because of the lower threshold
to perform caesarean section.
During the second stage, the breech should be
allowed to descend onto the pelvic floor before active
pushing is commenced. If descent does not occur
this could indicate disproportion or an unexpectedly
large fetus, and caesarean section is indicated.
Delivery in the lithotomy position allows access for
the attendant to perform any necessary manipulation
to the fetus. Routine episiotomy is recommended to
further increase access and prevent delay due to the
soft tissues. Two procedures are particularly valuable
in the delivery of a breech presentation:
• Lovset’s manoeuvre.
• The
Mauriceau–Smellie–Veit manoeuvre.

As these manoeuvres are so rarely practised nowadays
they will not be discussed in detail here.

Elective caesarean section for breech
presentation
The vast majority of breeches are now delivered by
caesarean section, either emergency or elective.
All women with a breech presentation should be
encouraged to undergo an external cephalic version
before discussing caesarean section.
As more and more breeches are delivered
abdominally, gaining the required skills and experience
needed for vaginal breech delivery is more difficult
and it is likely that in the future we will see even fewer
breeches delivered vaginally. Some would argue that
this is not necessarily a retrograde step, particularly in
the light of the Term Breech Trial (Lancet, 2000).

Transverse lie and unstable lie
A transverse lie occurs when the long axis of the
fetus lies transverse or oblique to the long axis of the
uterus, usually with the shoulder presenting (Fig.
39.5). When the fetal lie is different at each palpation,
the lie is said to be unstable.
The incidence of transverse lie diagnosed in
labour with a single fetus is approximately 1 in 500
women but many more will have been identified and
managed appropriately antenatally.
The causes of transverse lie include the general
causes of malpresentation shown in Fig. 39.1 but
there is particular association with:
• Multiparity,
where the tone of the uterus and

anterior abdominal wall is poor.
• Premature
labour.

• The
second twin.

The diagnosis of a transverse lie is usually made
antenatally and the findings on abdominal palpation
include the:
• Fetal
head palpable laterally in the maternal

abdomen.
• Fundal
height being lower, and the uterus wider,

than expected.
Vaginal examination, which should be avoided until
placenta praevia has been excluded, will reveal an
empty pelvis.

Some definitions: fetal
presentation is defined as that
part of the fetus that presents
to the maternal pelvis, fetal lie is the relationship of
the long axis of the fetus to the long axis of the uterus,
fetal position is the relationship of the denominator of
the presenting part (occiput for cephalic, sacrum for
breech and mentum for face) to the maternal pelvis.
Fig. 39.5 Transverse lie.

230

Malpresentation

39

The most serious complication of a transverse lie is
cord prolapse, and this is associated with spontaneous
rupture of membranes, which can occur antenatally
or in labour. As the shoulder usually presents, the
arm can prolapse and, in an unsupervised situation,
obstructed labour, infection and uterine rupture can
occur. Treatment depends on the situation at the time
of diagnosis and is aimed at:
• Correcting the malpresentation.
• Avoiding
serious complications.

If the diagnosis is made antenatally, exclusion of
causes of malpresentation is important. Elective
abdominal delivery at or approaching term is
indicated in the presence of pelvic contraction,
placenta praevia or a pelvic mass. In their absence, ECV
can be attempted. If reversion to a malpresentation
occurs, or an unstable lie is diagnosed, then admission
to hospital from 37 weeks gestation is indicated when
immediate delivery is possible if the membranes
spontaneously rupture. At term, an unstable lie
can be managed expectantly because spontaneous
version to a cephalic presentation often occurs due
to the increase in uterine activity. Transverse lie can
be corrected by ECV followed by induction of labour.
If the lie remains unstable then caesarean section is
indicated.
If a transverse lie is diagnosed in early labour,
ECV should be attempted only if the membranes are
intact. If successful, ARM with the head in the pelvis
can stabilize the lie by inducing uterine contractions.
If version is not successful or the membranes have
ruptured, caesarean section is indicated.
Following delivery of the first twin, if the second
twin lies transversely the membranes must not be
ruptured until external version to a longitudinal lie
has been performed. When the presenting part has
descended into the pelvis, ARM can be performed
and vaginal delivery expected.

Fig. 39.6 Face presentation.

Diagnosis is usually made during vaginal examination
in labour when the supraorbital ridges, the bridge of
the nose and the alveolar margins in the mouth are
palpable (Fig. 39.7). During labour, the face becomes
oedematous and might be mistaken for a breech
presentation.

Mechanism of labour
The chin (mentum) is the denominator and in
75% of cases the position is mentoanterior. The

Face presentation
The incidence of face presentation is 1 in 300 labours
and occurs when the head is fully extended (Fig. 39.6).
The causes of extension of the fetal head include
congenital tumours of the neck but these are rare.
Face presentation is more likely to occur when a
normal fetus holds its head in an extended position.
Historically, anencephaly is associated with face
presentation but is now rare due to increased prenatal
diagnosis and termination of these pregnancies.

Fig. 39.7 Vaginal examination findings in face presentation.

231

Malpresentation and malpositions of the occiput
submentobregmatic diameter is 9.5 cm so vaginal
delivery is possible. Vaginal delivery occurs by
flexion of the head, which is possible only in the
mentoanterior position.

Face presentation will deliver vaginally
if it is mentoanterior but not if it is
mentoposterior.

Management of a face presentation in labour
is essentially the same as for a vertex presentation.
Vaginal examination should be performed when
the membranes rupture to exclude a cord prolapse.
Mentoposterior positions rotate spontaneously
to mentoanterior in 50% of cases, usually in the
second stage of labour, and in those that do not a
caesarean section is indicated. Caesarean section
should also be performed when the fetal heart rate
pattern is abnormal because a fetal blood sample for
pH measurement should not be taken from the face.
Traction forceps can be applied to a mentoanterior
position to correct delay in the second stage.
The face is nearly always swollen and bruised
following a face presentation and the parents should
be warned about this. Care must be taken during
vaginal examination because the fetal eyes can be
damaged by trauma or antiseptic lotions.

Brow presentation
The incidence of brow presentation is approximately
1 in 500 labours and the causes are the same as for a
face presentation.
Brow presentation should be suspected on
abdominal palpation when there is prominence of
the head on the side of the back in the presence of
an unengaged head. Vaginal examination reveals a
high presenting part, a palpable forehead with orbital
ridges in front and the anterior fontanelle behind.

Mechanism of labour
The membranes tend to rupture early in labour and
there is an increased risk of cord prolapse. With a
brow presentation, the mentovertical diameter – one
of the longest diameters of the fetal head (13 cm) –
presents. An average-sized fetus will not engage
with a normal-sized pelvis and obstructed labour
results. When the fetal head is small in relation to the

232

maternal pelvis descent might occur, allowing flexion
of the head as it hits the pelvic floor.
In the absence of disproportion, labour should be
allowed to continue. Further extension might occur
to a face presentation or flexion to a vertex position.

Malposition
The fetal head normally engages with an occipito­
transverse position. With descent, the head rotates to
an occipitoanterior position, presenting the narrowest
diameter for delivery through the outlet. Any position
that does not follow this pattern is regarded as a
malposition; the two most important being:
• Occipitoposterior position.
• Deep
transverse arrest.

Theoretically, brow and face presentations could
be regarded as malpositions but they are more
commonly regarded as malpresentations.

Occipitoposterior position
In approximately 20% of women in early labour the
fetus will present with an occipitoposterior (OP)
position.
Anthropoid and android pelves, which have an
anteroposterior diameter equal to or greater than the
transverse diameter, predispose to an OP position.
An anterior placenta is said to be associated with OP
position.
An OP position is the most common cause
of an unengaged head at term in a primigravida.
Abdominal palpation reveals:
•
•
•
•

A
 prominent fundus.
A
 lower abdomen that is flattened or concave.
A
 fetal back that can be palpated posteriorly.
Fetal
limbs that can be palpated anteriorly.


In labour, vaginal examination will ascertain the
position by identifying the sutures and fontanelles.
If the anterior fontanelle is at all palpable vaginally
then the head is deflexed. If only the posterior
fontanelle can be palpated then the head is well
flexed. The degree of flexion of the head is important
in the mechanism of labour.

Mechanism of labour
If the occipitofrontal diameter (11.5 cm) presents to
a borderline pelvis then engagement will not occur,

Malposition
resulting in an obstructed labour requiring caesarean
section. If the pelvis is adequate and the fetus not
macrosomic, the mechanism of labour with an OP
position depends on the degree of flexion of the fetal
head. When the head is well flexed, rotation to an
anterior position usually occurs as the occiput hits
the pelvic floor and then rotates forward. When the
head is deflexed, a persistent OP position is usual,
although delivery in an OP position (‘face to pubes’)
is possible if the pelvis is large enough.

Face-to-pubes delivery of an
OP position is possible but
rotation and OA delivery is
preferred as this allows better flexion of the head and
therefore less perineal trauma.

The first stage of labour should be managed in
the normal way. During the second stage, if the head
rotates anteriorly normal delivery can be anticipated.
An episiotomy is recommended if the fetus is
delivered face to pubes because a wider diameter
presents and increases the risk of severe perineal
trauma. If rotation fails to occur spontaneously, this
can be achieved using the following techniques:
• Manual rotation.
• Kielland’s
rotational forceps.

• Ventouse
extraction with spontaneous rotation.

Excluding those women who require caesarean
section for cephalopelvic disproportion, the outcome
for an OP position in labour is as follows:

39

• 70%
rotate and spontaneously deliver

occipitoanterior.
• 10%
fail to rotate and deliver OP (face to pubes).

• 20%
need assistance with rotation (manual,

ventouse extraction or rotational forceps).

Deep transverse arrest
Deep transverse arrest is said to have occurred when
a poorly flexed head arrests in the transverse position
at the level of the ischial spines.
Deep transverse arrest usually occurs when a
transverse position fails to rotate to an anterior
position. The head is neither flexed enough for
the occiput nor extended enough for the brow to
influence rotation. An android pelvis, where the side
walls are convergent, can prevent descent of the head
to the pelvic floor, where rotation normally occurs.
Diagnosis is by vaginal examination in the
presence of failure to progress in the second stage of
labour. The head is at the level of the ischial spines,
the sagittal suture is in the transverse position and
both anterior and posterior fontanelles are usually
palpable.
Rotation is required and may be achieved either
manually or by rotational forceps. The fetal head
should not be rotated in the presence of fetal acidosis
because intraventricular haemorrhage is more likely
to be precipitated. Caesarean section is indicated in
this situation or if instrumental delivery fails.

Objectives
After reading this chapter, you should be able to:
•
•
•
•
•

Understand the basics of repairing an episiotomy
Describe the criteria for safe instrumental delivery
Consider the indications for the use of forceps rather than ventouse delivery
List the potential complications of caesarean section
Monitor a patient undergoing vaginal birth after previous caesarean section.

For all interventions in obstetrics, the
following general principles apply:
• Make sure all documentation includes
the time and date, a legible signature and printed
name.
• Clearly record the indication for the intervention,
the abdominal and vaginal examination findings
as appropriate and the operative findings including
any complications.
• Obtain informed consent from the patient, either
verbal or written, depending on the procedure.

Episiotomy
The purpose of an episiotomy is to increase the
diameter of the vulval outlet by making an incision in
the perineal body. The indications for this procedure
are shown in Fig. 40.1.
Since the 1980s, the routine episiotomy rate has
been reduced dramatically because studies have
demonstrated its association with increased blood
loss, as well as long-term morbidity such as pain and
dyspareunia.

To make them easier to remember, the
indications for any intervention can be
divided into maternal and fetal.

Two techniques are used for episiotomy (Fig. 40.2).
Both should be performed with adequate analgesia,
either an epidural or perineal infiltration with local
anaesthetic, and should start in the midline at the
posterior fourchette.
1. Mediolateral: widely used in the UK, this type
of incision is more likely to protect the anal
sphincter if the incision extends during delivery.
2. Midline: this technique is widely used in the
USA and, although it is easier to repair and likely
to result in less postpartum pain, it is more likely
to involve the anal sphincter if it extends.
Repair of an episiotomy should be performed by
an experienced operator. There should be adequate
light and appropriate analgesia. A three-layer
technique is usual with absorbable subcuticular
sutures (Fig. 40.3):
• First
layer – vaginal skin: identify the apex of the

incision and suture in a continuous layer to the
hymen to oppose the cut edges of the posterior
fourchette.
• Second
layer – perineal body: deep sutures to

realign the muscles of the perineal body.
• Third layer – perineal skin: continuous or
interrupted subcuticular sutures to close the skin.
At the end of the procedure, all needles and swabs
should be checked. An examination of the vagina
should be performed to ensure that the apex of the
episiotomy is secure. Rectal examination should
ensure that the rectal mucosa has not been broached
by any deep sutures because this can result in fistula
formation.

Approximately 70% of mothers who deliver vaginally
will sustain some degree of perineal trauma. This can
be classified as:
• 1st degree: involves skin only.
• 2nd
degree: involves skin and perineal muscle.

• 3rd
 degree: includes partial or complete rupture
of the anal sphincter.
• 4th degree: as for 3rd degree but also involves the
anal mucosa.
The principles for repair are the same as for
episiotomy. Some 1st-degree tears can be allowed to
heal by secondary intention if they are not actively
bleeding. It is very important to recognize and repair
appropriately any damage to the anal sphincter
or mucosa; failure to do so can result in long-term
morbidity such as incontinence of flatus or faeces
(this occurs in approximately 5% of women).

Ventouse Delivery

Forceps delivery
the instrument of choice for assisted vaginal delivery.
Metal cups were used initially, either anterior cups
or posterior cups. Subsequently silicone rubber ones
were developed and more recently, the disposable
hand-held KIWI cup. The metal cups are more likely
to be associated with vaginal trauma but may be more
appropriate for delivery in certain situations such as
the presence of excessive caput on the fetal head. Along
with the KIWI cups, they are useful in the presence
of a fetal malposition. Both the metal and silicone
cups are available in different diameters depending
on the gestation of the fetus. It is not an appropriate
instrument at less than 34 weeks gestation.

Indications for Ventouse

Fig. 40.5 Criteria for instrumental vaginal delivery.
1. Adequate analgesia: perineal infiltration/pudendal
block/epidural anaesthesia (see Chapter 38)
2. Abdominal examination: estimation of fetal size – head
either 1/5 or 0/5 palpable
3. Vaginal examination: cervix fully dilated – head either at
or below the ischial spines, known fetal position, note
presence of caput or moulding
4. Adequate maternal effort and regular contractions
necessary for ventouse delivery
5. Empty bladder for forceps delivery

approximately 15 min of cup application. The CTG
should monitor the fetal heart rate throughout and, in
most units, it is standard practice for a paediatrician to
be present. Complications are listed in Fig. 40.6.

These are shown in Fig. 40.4.

Technique for ventouse
The criteria shown in Fig. 40.5 must be fulfilled.
Instrumental delivery should not be attempted if the
head is above the ischial spines because of the risks to
the fetus – a caesarean section is indicated.
All types of cup rely on the same technique. The
cup is applied in the midline over or just anterior
to the occiput, avoiding the surrounding vaginal
mucosa. The pressure in the connecting pump is
raised to −0.8 kg/cm2. This mechanism is ‘all-in-one’
with the KIWI cup.
Traction with the maternal contractions and with
maternal effort should be along the pelvic curve,
that is, initially in a downwards direction and then
changing the angle upwards as the head crowns. This
action basically mimics the passage of the fetal head
during a normal delivery, but uses the vacuum pump
to increase traction and flexion.
The operator should judge whether an episiotomy is
needed and the procedure should be complete within

Forceps Delivery
Over the last three or four centuries, forceps have
been used for delivery. There are two main types of
forceps (Fig. 40.7):
• Non-rotational
or traction forceps (Simpsons,

Andersons, Neville–Barnes or Wrigleys).
• Rotational
forceps (Keillands).


Indications for forceps
These differ slightly from those for the ventouse,
mainly because the ventouse requires maternal
effort and adequate contractions (Fig. 40.8).
Non-rotational forceps are suitable only for certain

As for the ventouse, the necessary criteria must be
fulfilled (Fig. 40.5). The blades of non-rotational
forceps are applied to the head, avoiding trauma to
the vaginal walls. The direction of traction is similar
to that of the ventouse, with episiotomy more likely
to be performed when the head crowns than with the
ventouse (Fig. 40.9).
Use of the rotational forceps involves a slightly
different technique: the knobs on the blades must
always point towards the occiput; asynclitism can be
corrected using the sliding mechanism of the handles
and then rotation achieved prior to traction in the
manner described above.

Caesarean Section

positions of the fetal head – direct occipitoanterior
or direct occipitoposterior. By contrast, the mode
of action of the ventouse cup allows rotation to
take place during traction and so it is suitable for a
malposition (see Chapter 14).
With a decline in the use of rotational forceps in
some units due to fetal and maternal complications,
it is essential to define the fetal position before
attempting delivery, so that the appropriate instrument
is chosen.

Caesarean section was first described by the ancient
Egyptians. It was used increasingly throughout the
twentieth century such that rates of 20–25% are
now common in units in the UK. The lower segment
procedure (lower segment caesarean section LSCS)
was introduced in the 1920s and has largely replaced
the ‘classical’ midline uterine incision. Although the
latter is sometimes indicated for preterm delivery
with a poorly formed lower segment or for a preterm
abnormal lie, it is associated with higher rates of
haemorrhage and rupture in future labours (up to
5% for midline operation, <1% for lower segment
procedure).

Indications for LSCS
These are shown in Fig. 40.10.

An elective LSCS is usually performed at 39 or

morbidity in the infant – transient tachypnoea
of the newborn (TTN). With regional analgesia
more commonly than general, a low transverse
skin incision is made. The rectus sheath is cut
and the rectus muscles divided. The uterovesical
peritoneum is incised to allow the bladder to be
reflected inferiorly. The lower uterine segment
is incised transversely and the fetus is delivered
manually.
Intravenous oxytocin is given by the anaesthetist
and the placenta and membranes are removed. The
angles of the uterine incision are secured to ensure

It is not appropriate to attempt an

above the ischial spines. An LSCS should
be performed.

Complications of LSCS
Although LSCS has become an increasingly safe
procedure, particularly with the introduction
of regional anaesthesia, there is still significant
morbidity associated with it:
• Haemorrhage:
all patients should have a group

and save sample sent; cross-match blood for
certain patients, e.g. those with placenta praevia.
• Gastric
aspiration: particularly with general

anaesthetic (Mendelson’s syndrome), this is
reduced by routine use of antacids.
• Visceral
injury: damage to bladder or

bowel, particularly with a history of previous
abdominal surgery.
• Infection:
reduced by routine use of prophylactic

antibiotics.
• Thromboembolic
disease: prophylaxis in all

patients.
• Future
pregnancy: subject to VBAC (see below)

or repeat operation with an increasing risk of
complications.

Vaginal birth after Caesarean
(VBAC)
In patients who have had a pregnancy complicated
by caesarean section, options for future deliveries
should be discussed. In the case of a classical
caesarean, the possibility of scar rupture in labour
is high (up to 5%) and thus repeat operation would
be recommended.
With LSCS for a non-repeatable cause, for
example cord prolapse, then a trial of vaginal
delivery might be appropriate, providing the patient
is fully counselled. Certain measures are advisable
during labour to monitor for the possibility of scar
rupture, which would mean immediate recourse to
caesarean section:
•
•

Intravenous

blood
count
(FBC) and group-and-save

sample available in laboratory.
• Continuous
CTG monitoring.

• Monitor
PV
loss
to exclude bleeding.

• Monitor abdominal pain: scar rupture can
present with continuous pain, as opposed to
intermittent contractions.
With appropriate monitoring, vaginal delivery rates
of approx 70% can be expected, with a scar rupture
rate of <1%.

Premature labour

41

Objectives
By the end of this chapter you should be able to:
• Define premature labour, and discuss necessary investigations and treatments
• Be aware of the role of steroids and the importance of neonatal involvement in
counselling mothers.

Premature labour is defined as labour occurring
after 24 weeks’ and before 37 weeks’ gestation,
so diagnosis depends upon the calculation of
the estimated date of delivery. It is important to
establish whether labour is preterm for several
reasons:
• Preterm
labour is less predictable and has more

complications than labour at term.
• There
is an increased risk of fetal distress in

labour.
• Neonatal
problems are likely, so the paediatric

team must be consulted.

With improving standard of
neonatal care it is easy to forget
that prematurity is the single
largest cause of neonatal mortality and long-term
handicap in otherwise normal babies – premature
babies have a 100-fold increased risk of dying than
term babies.

• In most circumstances an effort can be made to
stop the labour to administer corticosteroids to
the mother, which will boost fetal lung surfactant
production and therefore reduce neonatal
respiratory distress.

Corticosteroids
(betamethasone) are
given to the mother as
two intramuscular injections 12 hours apart. They
have been shown to significantly reduce neonatal
respiratory distress by stimulating fetal surfactant
production and are recommended for any woman in
threatened preterm labour between 24 and 34 weeks
gestation. Repeated courses of steroid administration
are currently not recommended.

Incidence
The incidence of preterm labour is currently around
6% in Europe, but this varies in different populations
and the incidence is increasing. Risk factors for
premature labour are shown in Fig. 41.1, with the
most significant association being a history of a
previous preterm labour.
The main causes of preterm delivery are shown in Fig.
41.2. Infection is thought to play a part in at least 20% of
cases (see Fig. 41.3 for common pathogens implicated
in preterm labour). Iatrogenic preterm delivery,
accounting for one-third of preterm deliveries, occurs
when obstetricians decide that delivery is necessary
in the interests of fetal or maternal health, due, for

example, to severe pre-eclampsia, or when scans have
shown severe intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR)
of the fetus.

Clinical Evaluation and
Investigation of Women
in Preterm Labour
As preterm labour is often rapid and is almost always
unexpected, some women will arrive in an advanced
state of labour – in this case the mother should be
assessed to make sure that she is stable (and not, for
instance, shocked due to a large abruption), examined
vaginally to check the dilatation of the cervix and fetal

242

monitoring commenced. The paediatricians must be
informed. As abnormal lie and presentation are far
more common in preterm pregnancy, an ultrasound
scan should be performed if necessary.
If the presentation is less acute a history should be
taken and examination performed with the aim of
finding out what the underlying cause of the threatened
preterm labour is, and investigations arranged as
appropriate. Any woman admitted with abdominal
pain or discharge should have a speculum examination
to allow inspection of the cervix (Fig. 41.4). Premature
labour does not always present with obvious contractions
and the cervix can undergo so-called ‘silent’ dilatation.
Cervical dilatation confirms labour but if the
cervix is closed in the presence of uterine contractions
the diagnosis of ‘threatened’ preterm labour is made.
Around half of women presenting with symptoms of
threatened preterm labour are either not in labour
or stop labouring spontaneously. If membranes have
ruptured, delivery is far more likely.
The clinical picture alone does not allow us to predict
accurately which women will settle spontaneously, so
the management plan is formulated on the assumption
that delivery will occur. Transvaginal scans to examine
the length of the cervix have been used, where cervical
shortening is a predictor of preterm delivery (Fig. 41.5).
Evidence of fetal fibronectin in the mother’s cervical
secretions can be used; its absence has proved to be a
reassurance that delivery is very unlikely but it is not a very
sensitive test and not widely used in clinical practice.

Fig. 41.4 Management checklist for patient presenting in
threatened preterm labour.
• Assess for signs of a precipitant of preterm labour,
e.g. sepsis, polyhydramnios, abruption, severe preeclampsia, obstetric cholestasis. Take blood tests as
appropriate. Perform urinalysis and send MSU
• Determine frequency and regularity of contractions.
Monitor the fetal heart
• Perform a sterile speculum examination to examine the
cervix. Take high vaginal and endocervical swabs. Start
continuous electronic fetal monitoring (CTG) if there is
cervical dilatation
• Ascertain fetal presentation (cephalic or breech)
• Give corticosteroids
• Give antibiotics if ruptured membranes or if obvious
signs of sepsis
• Consider tocolysis
• Contact paediatricians and arrange transfer out if
necessary and appropriate
• Discuss mode of delivery

Treatment of Women
Presenting in Preterm Labour
Although the mortality and morbidity of preterm infants
has been reducing over the last decade, this cannot be
ascribed to improved obstetric management, other
than the increased administration of corticosteroids to
the mother. Sadly, our attempts to stop preterm labour
are often unsatisfactory, being ineffective and exposing
women and their babies to drugs with significant sideeffects. Part of the problem is our lack of knowledge
about what triggers preterm labour.

Liaison with the paediatric team is vital. Some
hospitals do not have facilities for treating babies
born under certain gestations and in these cases
transfer to the nearest appropriate unit is made,
preferably in utero, that is, transfer of the mother
before she has delivered. If the mother is seriously
unwell or if delivery is imminent, transfer of the baby
can be arranged after delivery. Unless the mother
is in advanced labour on arrival, there will be an
opportunity for her and her partner to meet one of
the paediatricians to find out what is likely to happen
if her baby is born at an early gestation. They can be
given a realistic outlook and warned about some
of the problems that premature babies encounter.
A tour of the neonatal intensive care unit could be
arranged.

Parents need to be warned
of problems encountered by
children surviving extreme
premature delivery, which may be cerebral palsy,
chronic lung disease, visual and hearing deficits and
learning difficulties.

The different drugs used to try to stop contractions
are shown in Fig. 41.6. The common factor of all
the drugs is that none has been shown to result in
improved neonatal morbidity or mortality. Most have
been shown to delay delivery for some time (24–48
hours), which gives the obstetricians the opportunity
to administer corticosteroids and, if necessary,
transfer to another hospital able to offer neonatal
care. With all drugs, the side-effects on mother
and fetus must be balanced against the benefit of
prolonging the pregnancy. Tocolysis should not be
used for all cases of preterm labour; instances when it
might be inadvisable include:
• Maternal
illness that would be helped by delivery,

e.g. pre-eclampsia.
• Evidence
of fetal distress.

• In
 the presence of chorioamnionitis.
• When
there has been significant vaginal bleeding.

• Once
the membranes have ruptured.


Antibiotic therapy
Antibiotics (erythromycin) are given prophylactically
if the membranes have ruptured before term (around
a third of cases) to protect the fetus from ascending
infection. If the membranes are intact the mother is
screened for infection (vaginal and cervical swabs, blood
cultures if pyrexial) and given antibiotics if there are signs
of sepsis; prophylactic antibiotics are not indicated.

Cervical cerclage
When there is cervical incompetence resulting in
cervical dilatation but the patient is not actively
labouring, a suture can be placed in the cervix to
attempt to reduce the prolapse of membranes that

243

Premature labour

Fig. 41.6 Drugs used to treat preterm labour.
Oxytocin receptor antagonists, e.g. atosiban
This well tolerated but expensive drug has been proven to delay labour and delivery but does not influence neonatal
outcome. It is given as an intravenous infusion. Although side effects are rare, 8% of women can experience headache
and flushing.
Calcium-channel blockers, e.g. nifedipine
Block calcium channels in the myometrium, interrupting contraction. Given orally. They are thought to be as effective
as atosiban, however they are not licensed in the UK for this use, where atosiban is. Maternal side-effects are less
common than with β-agonists but include headache, flushing and tremor
Beta-agonists, e.g. ritodrine, salbutamol, terbutaline
Administered as IV infusion. Act on β-receptors in myometrium to cause relaxation.
Common side-effects, occurring in up to 80% of mothers, include tachycardia, headache, tremor, nausea and vomiting,
hyperglycaemia and hypokalaemia. Similar effects are seen in the fetus. The potentially fatal side-effects pulmonary oedema
and myocardial ischaemia occur in around 5% of women
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), e.g. indomethacin
NSAIDs are effective tocolytics, acting on the cyclo-oxygenase enzyme that catalyses production of prostaglandin vital for
labour. They are cheap and easy to administer orally. Side-effects in the mother are mild, comprising gastrointestinal upset
(nausea, heartburn) and headache. However they have potentially serious fetal side-effects, causing premature closure of
the ductus arteriosus (which can result in pulmonary hypertension, tricuspid regurgitation and heart failure) and reducing
renal function, leading to oligohydramnios. The neonatal complications necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and intracerebral
haemorrhage are also more common. The fetal effects are temporary and the neonatal effects are more common with
prolonged administration of the drug, but the fetal morbidity that has been seen in the past has dissuaded clinicians from
using NSAIDs
Nitric oxide donors, e.g. glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) patches
Nitric oxide donors act on myometrium in vitro to cause relaxation. They have few side-effects for mother or fetus but
their effectiveness in vivo has not been proven.

will otherwise ensue. Once the membranes prolapse
into the vagina they weaken and their rupture is
likely, followed by delivery or the development of
infection. The MacDonald suture, which is inserted
vaginally as high in the cervix as possible, is used
most commonly (Fig. 41.7). Other options are the
Shirodkar suture, which is inserted vaginally but
involves the dissection of the bladder off the cervix,
and a suture inserted into the cervix at laparotomy,
which can be placed higher.

������������������
���������������������
��������������

However, insertion of a suture can introduce
infection or result in rupture of the membranes
during the procedure.

Mode of delivery
The caesarean section rate might be presumed to be
higher because of a higher incidence of low-lying
placenta, fetal distress and abnormal lie in prematurity.
There is no firm evidence to show that caesarean
section is safer for the baby than vaginal delivery,
especially when the presentation is cephalic. Caesarean
section might have higher morbidity for the mother
when performed at very early gestations because
the lower segment is less well formed increasing the
necessity of having to use a classical uterine incision.

Any woman who has laboured prematurely is more
at risk of doing so again in her next pregnancy. In
many cases there will be nothing that can be done to
prevent this. Exceptions are when:

41

Management of future pregnancies
• Labour
has been due to treatable, persistent

infection, e.g. bacterial vaginosis.
• There
is cervical incompetence.

Where infection has been proved it should be treated
and the mother screened regularly for recurrence during
subsequent pregnancies and treated as necessary.
Cervical incompetence can be treated by
insertion of a cervical suture, either electively in
early pregnancy (usually around 12 weeks after the
high risk of early miscarriage has passed), or, if the
cervix is monitored regularly in pregnancy with
transvaginal scanning, when scan shows that the
cervix is shortening.

The prescription of prophylactic oral tocolytics
to women at increased risk of recurrent preterm
labour is not helpful but some clinicians prescribe
prophylactic corticosteroids at a point in the
pregnancy before the last baby delivered.

Postpartum Haemorrhage

Definition
Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) is defined as vaginal
bleeding of more than 500 mL. It can be either
primary or secondary:
• Primary: occurring within 24 hours of delivery.
• Secondary: occurring after the first 24 hours and
within 6 weeks of delivery.

Primary PPH

Incidence of primary PPH
The incidence of primary PPH in the developed world
is about 5% of deliveries, in contrast to developing
countries where it can occur in 28% of deliveries and
remains the major cause of maternal mortality.

Aetiology of primary PPH
The main causes of primary PPH are shown in Fig. 42.1.

Uterine atony
The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony.
This occurs when there is a failure of contraction of
the uterus after the infant has been delivered. Risk
factors include:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Multiple pregnancy.
Grand multiparity.
Polyhydramnios.
Fibroid uterus.
Prolonged labour.
Previous PPH.
APH, especially placenta praevia or abruption.

In the case of a twin pregnancy, for example, there
is overdistension of the uterus, which might reduce
its ability to contract effectively, as well as a larger
placental site which can bleed. Fibroids (depending on
their position) can also restrict efficient contraction of
the uterus, as can a distended bladder. APH secondary
to placental abruption impairs the normal function
of the uterine muscle because of damage caused by
bleeding into the myometrium. With placenta praevia,
the lower segment of the uterus does not contract
well after delivery and so there is an increased risk of
haemorrhage from the placental bed.

Genital tract trauma
At the time of delivery, there may be bleeding from
trauma to:
•
•
•
•

Perineum.
Vagina.
Cervix.
Uterus.

For example, a difficult forceps delivery might cause
cervical lacerations as well as needing an episiotomy

for delivery. At caesarean section, delivery of a deeply
engaged presenting part or a large infant might cause
extension of the uterine incision and result in heavy
bleeding.

Prevention
In the first instance, prevention of primary PPH
involves treatment of anaemia during pregnancy and
identifying patients who might be at risk. These women
might be obvious antenatally, such as the patient with
a known inherited coagulation factor deficiency or
one who has had a previous PPH. Equally, PPH might
be anticipated during labour, for example the patient
who has a prolonged labour ending with a difficult
instrumental delivery of a large baby.
Active management of the third stage of labour
is routine in most obstetric units, with the patient’s
consent. It involves:
• Use of an oxytocic drug.
• Controlled cord traction to deliver the placenta
(Brandt–Andrews method).
• Clamping and cutting the umbilical cord.
Prophylactic use of oxytocics in particular is known to
reduce the incidence of PPH by 30–40%. Intramuscular
Syntometrine is commonly used in the UK (5 units of
syntocinon and 0.5 mg ergometrine). If the patient has
hypertension, syntocinon is given alone.

Management
History, examination and investigation of the
patient who has a PPH is described in Chapter 16.
Treatment must start with basic resuscitation (ABC)
depending on the patient’s condition and the
extent of the bleeding. It is important to make an

248

accurate estimation of the blood loss; it is frequently
underestimated. Intravenous access must be
established. Blood is sent for haemoglobin, platelets,
clotting and cross-matching. In cases of massive
obstetric haemorrhage, generally classified as ≥2000 mL,
a multidisciplinary approach to management is very
important, involving liaison between the obstetrician,
the anaesthetist and the haematologist. The cause of
the bleeding must be identified so that appropriate
management can be instigated.

Good interdisciplinary
communication is essential in
obstetrics:
• Haematologists in cases of massive PPH.
• Microbiologists in cases of sepsis of uncertain
origin that does not respond to regular treatment.
• Psychiatrists in cases of postnatal mental illness.
All these disorders are associated with significant
maternal morbidity and mortality.

Uterine atony
With uterine atony, the uterus is palpated and a
contraction rubbed up by massaging the uterus
abdominally. Bimanual compression may also be
tried. Further oxytocic drugs are given, commonly
intravenous syntocinon, initially as a single dose,
then proceeding to an intravenous infusion.
Prostaglandins may be beneficial, either carboprost
can be injected intramuscularly or intramyometrially
(also known as Hemabate™) or misoprostol can be
given rectally. Use of the latter drug for this purpose
is unlicensed.
In severe cases, surgery is necessary and even
life-saving. This includes bilateral uterine artery
ligation or bilateral internal iliac artery ligation.
A B-Lynch compression suture can be performed
to avoid hysterectomy and this preserves future
fertility. However, prompt recourse to hysterectomy is
essential to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality.
This management is summarized in Fig. 42.2.

Genital tract trauma
Bleeding while the uterus is firmly contracted is
strong evidence of genital tract trauma or retained

placenta. In the case of trauma, this should be
repaired as soon as possible with appropriate
analgesia (see Chapter 41 for perineal repair).
There should be good light and care should be
taken to minimize infection. This may be necessary
in theatre, for example, cervical lacerations bleed
profusely and may need to be repaired under general
anaesthesia.

Retained or incomplete placenta
If the placenta is still in situ, delivery should be
attempted by controlled cord traction. Once
delivered, the placenta must be examined to ensure
that the cotyledons and the membranes are complete.
If the placenta is still retained, manual removal is
necessary under regional analgesia in the situation
of a PPH. This is usually performed with antibiotic
cover and with further doses of oxytocics.
Examination of the patient under anaesthetic
allows exploration of the uterus if the placenta is
thought to be incomplete. It also enables suturing
of genital tract trauma such as cervical or vaginal
lacerations once uterine atony is excluded as the
cause of the PPH.

Placenta accreta
With routine active management of the third stage
of labour, the placenta is usually delivered within
minutes of the infant. If the patient is not bleeding,
up to an hour can be left before undertaking manual
removal under anaesthesia. Rarely, the placenta
is found to be morbidly adherent to the uterine
wall, known as a placenta accreta. Invasion of the
myometrium by the placenta is known as placenta
increta and if it is through the myometrium, it is
known as placenta percreta. These conditions are
associated with paucity of underlying decidua:

42

• Previous placenta praevia.
• Uterine scar such as previous caesarean section.
• Multiparity.
If the patient is not bleeding, it may be appro­
priate to leave the placenta in situ. Conservative
management includes observation and antibiotics,
as well as considering the use of the folate antagonist,
methotrexate. However, more commonly, the patient
has significant bleeding and surgery is necessary,
including hysterectomy.

The potential morbidity and mortality
associated with PPH are so significant that
earlier rather than delayed recourse to
hysterectomy is essential.

Uterine inversion
The placenta and membranes should be delivered
by controlled cord traction to prevent this rare
complication of labour (Fig. 40.13). It can be either
complete, when the uterine fundus passes through
the cervix, or incomplete, when the fundus is still
above the cervix. It can occur spontaneously, for
example in association with a fundal placental site
or a unicornuate uterus, or it may be the result of
mismanagement of the third stage.
The more serious presentation is of severe
lower abdominal pain followed by collapse (due
to neurogenic shock) and haemorrhage. The pain
is secondary to tension on the infundibulopelvic
ligaments. Treatment involves resuscitation of the
patient, replacement of the uterus, either manually
or hydrostatically, and oxytocin infusion.

Uterine rupture
This is seen very rarely in the UK, except in association
with a previous caesarean section. It is associated
with high rates of maternal and fetal morbidity and
mortality. The incidence has fallen dramatically with
the introduction of the lower segment procedure
(<1%), as opposed to the classical vertical incision of
the uterus (up to 5%). Spontaneous rupture is much
less common. It is seen in a patient of high parity,
associated with the use of syntocinon to augment
labour.

249

Complications of the third stage of labour and the puerperium
Uterine rupture can present with an abnormal
CTG in labour (see Chapter 15), or with continuous
abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding. Diagnosis is
made at laparotomy and the treatment is surgical,
either repair of the rupture or hysterectomy.

Complications of primary PPH
Sheehan’s syndrome
Severe PPH can lead to avascular necrosis of the
pituitary gland, resulting in hypopituitarism. This
can present as secondary amenorrhoea or failure of
lactation.

Postnatal Infection

Definition
Also known as puerperal infection, this is defined as
a maternal temperature of ≥38°C maintained for 4–6
hours in the first 14 days after delivery.

Incidence
Infection remains a major cause of maternal
mortality (see Chapter 43). However, with improved
hygiene and the use of antibiotics, the incidence has
fallen to 1–3%.

Secondary PPH
This can be caused by:

Maternal sepsis is still one of the top ten
causes of maternal mortality and so must
be investigated thoroughly and treated
promptly.

• Retained products of conception.
• Endometritis.
• Molar pregnancy or choriocarcinoma.
Chapter 16 gives the relevant points in the history,
examination and investigations for the disorder,
which most commonly presents with persistent
vaginal bleeding.

Lactation
There are two main hormonal influences on breast
tissue during pregnancy:
• Oestrogen increases the number and the size of
the ducts.
• Progesterone increases the number of alveoli.
Colostrum, which is rich in antibodies, is secreted
in late pregnancy and production increases after
delivery. The level of oestrogen falls in the first 48
hours after delivery so that prolactin can act on the
alveoli and initiate lactation.
Suckling stimulates two reflexes:
1. the anterior part of the pituitary gland releases
prolactin into the bloodstream, which induces
the alveoli to secrete milk.
2. the posterior part of the pituitary gland
releases oxytocin into the bloodstream, which
causes contraction of the myoepithelial cells
surrounding the alveoli so that the milk is
ejected.

250

Sites of infection
•
•
•
•
•
•

Uterus.
Abdominal incision.
Perineum.
Chest.
Urinary tract.
Breast.

History
The site of infection is usually obvious from the patient’s
history. Dysuria and urine frequency would suggest a
urinary tract infection. If there is also loin pain then
there might be an ascending infection to the kidneys
causing pyelonephritis. If the patient has a productive
cough and complains of feeling breathless, then she may
have a chest infection. This is typically a postoperative
complication, seen after caesarean section.
A uterine infection is also more common after
an operative intervention, such as a caesarean
section or a manual removal of placenta. It typically
presents with lower abdominal pain, sometimes with
unpleasant-smelling vaginal discharge. Retained
products of conception must be excluded. It is now
routine practice to give prophylactic antibiotics at the
time of a caesarean section to decrease the incidence
of wound and uterine infection.

Postnatal mental illness
Infection in the perineum can also present with
vaginal discharge, as well as localized discomfort.
There is usually a history of a vaginal tear or an
episiotomy. Acute mastitis, or infection of the breast,
typically presents at the end of the first week after
birth, as organisms that colonize the baby affect the
breast. Infection presents with pain in one or both
breasts associated with fever.

Examination
Examine the patient from head-to-toe, as suggested
in Fig. 42.3. Pyrexia tachypnoea and tachycardia will
be present with infection.

• Wound swab for caesarean section patient.
• Mid-stream urine sample.
• Sputum sample.

Management
The antibiotic of choice will depend on local protocol
but usually involves a broad-spectrum antibiotic
and anaerobic cover with metronidazole for 5 to 7
days. Flucloxacillin is more appropriate for mastitis
or wound infection because the usual pathogen is
Staphylococcus.

Postnatal Mental Illness

Investigations
White blood cell count and C-reactive protein level
will be high. Blood cultures are indicated if the
temperature is ≥38°C.
Other investigations depend on the system that is
involved:
• High vaginal swab for uterine infection.
• Perineal swab.

42

Incidence
Postnatal depression is one of the most common
medical diseases of pregnancy, with 10% of women
fulfilling the criteria for a depressive disorder.
Psychosis is much rarer, affecting 0.2% of births.
These disorders should be distinguished from the
‘baby blues’, which affects up to 70% of women, with

and irritability normally settle with reassurance and
support from family and friends.

History
Chapter 36 lists the risk factors for postnatal
depression and some of these should be sought at the
time of the antenatal booking, as recommended in the
triennial report into maternal death (see Chapter 43).
Puerperal psychosis in particular has associated risks:
previous psychotic illness gives the woman a 1:2
chance of postnatal disease and a family history a 1:4
chance.
The common symptoms of postnatal depression
and puerperal psychosis are shown in Figs 42.4 and
42.5, respectively. The peak time of onset for postnatal
depression is a gradual onset 4 to 6 weeks postpartum,
whereas the onset of psychosis is usually very sudden.

Risk factors for postnatal
mental illness include a
previous history of mental
health disorder either in or outside of pregnancy, as
well as a family history of perinatal mental illness.
Therefore it is essential to enquire sensitively in the
antenatal period in order to aid prediction and allow
early detection and management of postnatal mental
illness.

public awareness. Early diagnosis and training of
professionals to recognize the problems are also
vital and has resulted in the development of the
Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, which is used
successfully by health visitors across the UK.
Psychotherapy may be the first line treatment for
postnatal depression. Drug treatment is described in
Chapter 36. As with any drug in pregnancy, use should
be considered if the benefits outweigh the risks. The
tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) can be given safely
both antenatally and postnatally. The newer selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are probably
safe, but there is less evidence to support this. Lithium
is associated with cardiac anomalies, particularly
Ebstein’s anomaly, when used antenatally. It may be
toxic to the baby and is therefore not recommended
with breastfeeding. Electro-convulsive therapy is safe.
Health visitors and support groups all have an
important role in helping the mother with postnatal
illness.

Thromboembolic disease is the most common
cause of pregnancy-related maternal mortality in
the UK (see Chapter 43). Chapter 36 describes the
risk factors, diagnosis and management in detail.
Of particular importance are those women who are
delivered by caesarean section. However, it is vital
not to forget that a woman who has had a normal
delivery might still have significant risk factors,
such as obesity or hypertension, which necessitate
thromboprophylaxis in the postpartum period of up
to 6 weeks.

Distinguish between direct and indirect causes of maternal death
Be aware of the three commonest causes of maternal death
Know the importance of psychiatric conditions in indirect causes of maternal mortality
Be aware of measures which would further reduce maternal mortality.

Maternal mortality is defined as death of the mother
during pregnancy, labour and within 42 days of
delivery or abortion, but recently deaths up to 1 year
have been studied. Maternal deaths are divided into
four categories: direct, indirect, coincidental (which
used to be called fortuitous) and late (Fig. 43.1).

Confidential Enquiries into
Maternal Deaths
Since 1952, a triennial report of the Confidential
Enquiries into Maternal Deaths (CEMD) has been
published. Since April 2003 it is produced under the
auspices of CEMACH (Confidential Enquiries into
Maternal and Child Health). Its aim remains the same:
• Assess the main causes of death.
• Examine
the trends, comparing rates of death to

those in previous reports.
• Identify
any avoidable deaths or substandard

factors.
• Make
recommendations about improving

clinical care.
• Suggest
areas for future audit and research.

At a local level, hospitals can use the report
to develop guidelines for the management of
complications of pregnancy, and to review the care
that their patients receive.
Figure 43.2 shows the maternal mortality rate
since 1952. The fall in maternal mortality is thought
to be due to a combination of improved obstetric and
midwifery care and an improvement in the standards
of living.

The maternal mortality rate
for the United Kingdom in
the 2000–2002 triennia was
approximately 13.1 in 100 000 maternities (direct and
indirect causes) compared to 11.4 in 100 000 in the
last report. Four factors for explaining this are:
• Increase in reporting cases that may not obviously
be related to pregnancy
• Increase in number of newly arrived refugees who
did not seek care
• Numbers increasing by chance as increase not
statistically significant
• An increase in number of women receiving
substandard care

Causes of Maternal Death
Figure 43.3 shows the main causes of maternal death
in 2000–2002. The case studies below are drawn from
the most recent confidential enquiry document.

Direct maternal deaths

Thromboembolism still remains the
commonest cause of direct maternal
deaths.

255

Maternal death

Fig. 43.1 Definitions of the classes of maternal death.
• Direct: resulting from obstetric complications
• Indirect: previous existing disease, or disease arising in
pregnancy, aggravated by the physiological effect of
pregnancy (includes all asthma, cardiac disease, epilepsy
and suicide)
• Coincidental: unrelated cause, occurring in pregnancy or
puerperium
• Late: >42 days, <12 months after termination/
miscarriage/delivery

Thromboembolic disease
Thromboembolic disease is the most common cause
of direct maternal death, accounting for more than
one-third of deaths. Great effort has been made in
recent years to improve prophylaxis for women at
increased risk of thromboembolism in pregnancy,
particularly those undergoing caesarean delivery, and
national guidelines exist recommending heparin and
Thromboembolic (TED) stockings as appropriate.
However, all pregnant women are at risk (see
Chapter 36) and women are still dying, often after
the problem has been put down to muscle strain, as
illustrated in the case study below.

Fig. 43.2 Death rates from 1952 to the
present.

death rates per 100,000 maternities

Case study: thromboembolic disease
An overweight woman aged over 30 with a strong
family history of thromboembolic disease developed
thrombophlebitis and was admitted to A&E at
8 weeks gestation with chest pain. Although the
woman’s GP had suggested a diagnosis of pulmonary
embolism (PE), the medical registrar thought that

chest X-ray and anticoagulation were contraindicated
and the woman went home with a diagnosis of
‘musculoskeletal pain’. Two days later she was
readmitted and a V/Q scan was arranged to exclude
PE; she died of PE before the scan was performed.

Hypertensive disorders
Deaths from hypertensive disorders, including
pre-eclampsia and eclampsia, are decreasing. The
largest single cause of death of women in this group
is intracranial haemorrhage, a complication of
uncontrolled hypertension reflecting a failure to treat
high blood pressure effectively, especially after delivery.
Case study: hypertension in pregnancy
A woman whose booking blood pressure was 100/50
was noted to have a blood pressure of 120/85 at
her first antenatal visit. Her urine was not checked
for protein. She had a seizure at home several
days later. On admission she had a BP of 150/100
and ++++ of proteinuria. She was treated with
magnesium sulphate, hydralazine and underwent an
emergency caesarean section. After delivery her BP
was poorly controlled. Her BP rose to 180/120. She
became unresponsive and subsequently died from
intracranial haemorrhage.

Haemorrhage
Haemorrhage-related deaths have increased in the
triennium of 2000–2002. This may be due to increase
mean age of child births, multiple pregnancies,
increasing number of women with complex medical
disorders choosing to be pregnant, and increased
caesarean section rates leading to subsequent

Ectopic pregnancy
Of the direct deaths associated with early pregnancy in
2000–2002, most were due to ectopic pregnancy, with the
main problem being a failure to suspect the possibility
of ectopic pregnancy in the first place. Presentation
might be atypical with, for example, gastrointestinal
symptoms confusing the issue, but the diagnosis must be
suspected in any woman who is unwell and has a positive
pregnancy test (see Chapter 7).

Indirect maternal deaths
Cardiac disease, psychiatric disease, and central
nervous system (CNS) disorders, are the main
categories in this section.

Cardiac disease
placenta praevia and accreta. A multi-disciplinary
massive haemorrhage protocol must be available in
all units and rehearsed regularly by ‘drills’. Consultant
obstetrician and anaesthetist must be involved in
cases of placenta praevia.
Case study: haemorrhage
A woman who had several previous caesarean
sections was admitted twice with antepartum
haemorrhage from 28 weeks. She was diagnosed
with placenta praevia and transfused. Both times
she was discharged home. She was readmitted
with severe bleeding a few weeks later and had an
emergency caesarean section. Unfortunately this
was in a unit with no blood transfusion facility or
intensive care unit.

Sepsis
Deaths from septic abortion following illegal
termination of pregnancy were, sadly, not uncommon
before the Abortion Act of 1967. Sepsis declined
as a major cause of maternal death thereafter but
has recently been increasing again. Deaths seen
in 2000–2002 included those after miscarriage,
amniocentesis, suction termination of pregnancy,
and chorioamnionitis.

Amniotic fluid embolism
Amniotic fluid embolism is rare, unpredictable,
unpreventable, and rapidly progressive. Management is
supportive. It should be suspected in anyone with acute
hypoxia, acute hypotension, coagulopathy, and no other
clinical explanations for the symptoms and signs.

Cardiac disease is now the second most common
cause of maternal death after psychiatric causes and
more common than death from thromboembolism.
Of all deaths from cardiac disease, 20% are congenital,
with 80% being acquired. Coronary artery dissection
is a common (62%) cause of death from myocardial
infarction in pregnancy so a low threshold for
angiography should be present.

Psychiatric disorders
Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death with
77% the method being predominantly violent. The
most common profile of women at risk of suicide is
of a white multiparous woman married and living in
comfortable conditions. The 2000–2002 triennial
report particularly emphasizes the high risk of
recurrence of serious psychiatric illness postnatally (see
the case study below) and warns health professionals to
be aware of this (see Chapter 36). The lack of specialist
mental health teams and mother-and-baby units makes
it more difficult to treat these women optimally.

Great caution should be exercised before
attributing unusual physical symptoms to
psychiatric causes.

Case study: suicide
A professional woman killed herself and her baby
by self-immolation some weeks after delivery. She

257

Maternal death
had a history of bipolar illness with several inpatient
admissions. However she had been well for many
years. At booking the midwife accurately documented
her history. However no proactive management plans
were put into place and early signs of depressive
psychosis were misattributed.

Risk factors for maternal death
Maternal mortality increases with increasing maternal
age and parity. Other factors include multiple
pregnancy and IVF treatment, non-white ethnic origin,
late booking and lower social class.

CNS disorders
Cerebral haemorrhage and epilepsy are amongst
the most common cause of deaths from diseases
of the central nervous system. Close monitoring
of epilepsy in pregnancy is important because
anticonvulsant levels can change and women often
feel ambivalent about continuing treatment due to
the fetal side-effects (see Chapter 36).

Coincidental deaths
This section includes many different causes of death
but of particular concern are those due to domestic
violence. Women suffering domestic violence are
more likely to book late, to be poor attenders at
antenatal clinic and to have poor obstetric histories.
Ideally, all women at the booking visit should
be asked, directly but sensitively, about violence.
A pregnant woman should be seen at least once on
her own during pregnancy and relatives should not be
used as interpreters.

Always document BMI at booking. 35%
of women who died had a BMI of over 30
in the triennium of 2000–2002.

Substandard care was identified in 67% of cases
of direct and indirect maternal deaths studied
in the 2000–2002 report. The main causes were
summarized as:
• Failure
of some obstetric and midwifery staff to

recognize and act on medical conditions outside
their immediate experience.
• Failure
of accident and emergency staff to

recognise severity of illness in pregnant women
and seek help.
• Lack
of follow up of women who were non
attenders with identified risk factors.
• Lack
of communication and teamwork.

• Wrong
diagnosis.

• Failure
to seek senior help.

Taking a history

44

Objective
• After reading this chapter, you should understand how to take a gynaecological history.

The history plays a vital role in obstetrics and
gynaecology, often giving pointers to a diagnosis
that is not always evident from examination and
investigation of the patient. Many women are
embarrassed by having to discuss their gynaecological
problems, especially to someone who is often
younger than they are, so it is important to overcome
this by developing a confident, friendly and
relaxed atmosphere. Always introduce and present
yourself in an acceptable manner, be courteous and
friendly without being overfamiliar, and always pay
attention.

The Patient’s Details
It is surprising how often the patient’s details are
omitted from a history. Always record the following:
1. Name, date of birth, age and address
(sticky labels with this information are usually
available).
2. Marital status, ethnic group and occupation.
3. The date, time and place of the consultation.
4. Source of referral, e.g. GP referral, self-admitted
to A&E, labour ward.

It is useful to get into the habit
of writing certain details in the
top right hand corner of the
clerking sheet so they are not omitted, for example:
• Age.
• Parity.
• Date of LMP.
• Date of last smear.

Presenting Complaint
The presenting complaint documented in the referral
letter or the casualty card does not always correlate
with what the patient perceives as the main problem.
Some patients have already been labelled with a
diagnosis before you get to see them. It is therefore
vital to ask the patient what she sees as her primary
complaint and document this – preferably in her own
words. If there are multiple symptoms, document
each one in order of severity.
During the examination, investigations and
treatment never lose track of the presenting complaint,
otherwise management plans may not always be
appropriate. Conversely, the presenting complaint
might be a cover for a different problem that the patient
has difficulty discussing. Always ask if there is anything
else bothering the patient that she wishes to discuss.

History of Presenting
Complaint
Details of the history of the presenting complaint
should be ascertained. For instance:
• How
long has the complaint been present or a

problem? For example, a woman might complain
that she has always had heavy periods but they
have only been a problem for the last 2 years.
• Was
the onset of symptoms sudden or gradual? For

example severe hirsutism of rapid onset is likely to
be due to an androgen-producing tumour.
• Was
the onset associated with a previous obstetric

or gynaecological event? For example, stress
incontinence and childbirth.
• Are
 there any relieving or exacerbating factors?
For example symptoms of prolapse are often
worse on standing and better on lying down.

261

Taking a history
• Are
 there any associated symptoms? For
example the painful periods of endometriosis
is sometimes associated with frequent bowel
action.
If pain is the presenting complaint then the following
characteristics should be noted:
• Site
 : is the pain pelvic or abdominal? For example
ovarian pain can be felt quite high in the
abdomen.
• Severity
: how severe is the pain and to what extent

does it disrupt everyday life? For example the
cyclical pain of endometriosis might necessitate
regular time off work.
• Onset
: sudden or gradual? For example the

pain from a torted ovarian cyst is usually of very
sudden onset.
• Character: is the pain sharp/knife-like, dull,
heavy/dragging, colicky, stretching or twisting?
Many adjectives have been used to describe
pain or discomfort of gynaecological origin. For
example women with uterine prolapse might
describe a pulling or a dragging pain/sensation,
dysmenorrhoea might be likened to labour pain.
• Duration
: is the pain constant, intermittent,

what is the frequency if intermittent? The pain
of a degenerating fibroid in pregnancy will
be constant whereas the pain of threatened
premature labour will be intermittent and
frequent.
• Radiation
: does the pain radiate? For example

endometriosis pain might radiate to the back or
into the upper thighs.
• Relieving/exacerbating
features: does anything

make the pain better or worse and this should
include self-prescribed analgesia? For example
endometriosis symptoms are usually cyclical and
associated with menstruation.
• Associated
symptoms for example symptoms of

peritonitis or advanced malignancy.

Past Gynaecological History

Menstrual history
The following characteristics of menstruation and the
menstrual cycle should be noted:
•
•

Age
at menarche.

Last
menstrual period (LMP).


262

• Menstrual
cycle: usually denoted as 5/28, where

the numerator is the length of the period in days
and the denominator is the length of the cycle in
days. If period and cycle length are variable the
shortest and longest are noted, e.g. 3–10/14–56.
• Menstrual
flow: whether light, normal or heavy.

If heavy, the presence of clots, flooding, night
time soiling and the number of sanitary pads/
towels used should be noted.
• Menstrual
pain: is the pain mild, moderate or

severe? Has it been present since menarche or is it
of recent onset. Is the pain worse before or during
the period?
• Associated
symptoms: for example bowel or

bladder dysfunction, nausea.
• Other
bleeding: intermenstrual bleeding (IMB),

postcoital bleeding (PCB), pre- or postmenstrual
spotting.
• Age
at menopause.


Sexual activity and contraception
Is the patient sexually active or in a relationship.
Does the patient suffer from dyspareunia and if so
is it superficial or deep? Is she or her partner using
contraception and if so what? If she is on the pill, was
it prescribed for contraceptive purposes or menstrual
disorder?

Cervical screening
Has the patient undergone regular cervical screening?
When was the last smear taken? Have there ever been
abnormal smears?

Vaginal discharge
Is vaginal discharge present and if so is it normal
or abnormal? If abnormal, what is the colour and
consistency and is it irritant? Was the onset associated
with a change in sexual partner? Is there a history of
sexually transmitted infection?

Past Obstetric History
The parity and gravidity should be noted. Parity
denotes the number of livebirths or stillbirths
after 24 weeks gestation and gravidity the number
of pregnancies. Use of the terms ‘parity’ and
‘gravidity’ can become very complicated, especially
with a history of multiple pregnancies. A more

Social history
straightforward way of documenting previous
pregnancies is to document the number of:
• Children.
• Miscarriages.

• Terminations.

Document the details of each pregnancy:
• The
number of children with age and birth

weight. Note any complications of pregnancy,
labour and the puerperium.
• The
number of miscarriages, their gestation and

complications if any.
• The
number of terminations of pregnancy,

their gestation, method and indication and
complications if any.

• Gastrointestinal
tract: change in bowel habit,

especially with menstruation.
• Genitourinary
system: urinary frequency,

nocturia, dysuria, incontinence.

Drug History
A careful drug history should be taken and should
include hormonal contraception and HRT, which are
often overlooked by the patient.

Allergies
Document all known allergies.

Past Medical History
This should include previous surgery, for example
sterilization. Medical disorders such as hypertension
or diabetes may be relevant to suitability for surgery.

Systems Enquiry
A brief systems enquiry should be made with
particular reference to:
• General
symptoms: weight gain or loss, loss of

appetite

Family History
Enquire as to a family history of ovarian, uterine and
breast disease.

Social History
Occupation, smoking habits and alcohol consumption
should be noted. If surgery is contemplated, what is
the support network at home?

Antenatal booking and
ongoing care

45

Objectives

• Following
this chapter you will appreciate what information is required to estimate the
gestation of pregnancy. You will also be able to calculate the due date from the LMP
using Naegele’s Calculation

• Examples
are given to help you understand how to work out the gravidity and parity of
a patient at booking

• You
will understand the importance of screening for viral infections in pregnancy

• You
will be able to advise pregnant women how to reduce the risk of contracting Listeria
and Toxoplasma infection from foodstuffs

• Although
urinalysis is a simple test you will understand the importance of an abnormal
result with respect to pregnancy.

Fundamental to the planning of antenatal care is the
identification, at the booking visit, of factors that reveal
the woman to be at risk of complications during her
pregnancy, labour and postpartum period (Fig. 45.1).

History

History of the current pregnancy
First, ascertain the gestation of the present pregnancy.
Ask for the date of the first day of the LMP and whether
it was a normal period. Also check the usual cycle
length and whether her periods are regular or irregular.
Ask if she was on the oral contraceptive pill when she
conceived (the baby will not suffer any ill effects but the
date of her LMP cannot be relied upon for estimation
of gestation). Find out if she has had any problems so
far, and if she has had any admissions or scans.

Past obstetric history
Past obstetric history records the outcome of all past
pregnancies (Fig. 45.2). For pregnancies less than
24 weeks, document whether she had a miscarriage
or a termination, and at what gestation. If the
termination was for fetal abnormality this should be
noted. For pregnancies lasting longer than 24 weeks,
record:

• Mode
of delivery, and reason for caesarean/
instrumental delivery.

• Gestation
at delivery.

• Whether
onset of labour was spontaneous or
induced.

• Weight
and sex of baby.

• Any
significant antenatal problems.

• Problems
experienced by the baby in the
neonatal period.

Past gynaecological history
Naegele’s rule for calculation of
the estimated date of delivery
(assumes a 28-day cycle): add
7 to the first day of the LMP for the due day, and take
3 from the month of the LMP for the due month. For
example, an LMP of 1 March gives a due date of 8
December.

The date of the last smear is recorded. If there have
been abnormal smears in the past, the outcome of
these, and treatment performed must be noted.
Most CIN in the UK is treated by LLETZ, which is less
likely to result in obstetric complications than a cone
biopsy. The latter, which is used to treat a minority
of cases, can result in significant cervical damage,
resulting in cervical incompetence or stenosis (see
Chapter 23).

Social history
This might need to be particularly sensitively elicited,
and it might be appropriate to wait until the woman
is alone before questioning. The key points to cover
include:
• Smoking.

• Drug
and alcohol use, documenting types of drug
and amount used.

Antenatal booking and ongoing care

Fig. 45.2 Past obstetric histories
Shorthand for the number and type of pregnancies includes talking of ‘primips’ to
denote women who have not had a >24-week pregnancy before, and ‘multips’
who have. ‘Gravidity’ means the number of pregnancies of any gestation, whereas
‘parity’ is the number of deliveries (by vaginal or operative route). An obstetric
history can be abbreviated as shown in the examples below:
Lynne is currently 22 weeks into this pregnancy and in the past has had two normal
deliveries, one miscarriage at 8 weeks and a termination at 8 weeks. She is
therefore Para 2 Gravida 5, or Para 2 + 2.
Hayley is booking at 12 weeks. She had a caesarean section last year and a stillbirth
at 37 weeks 10 years ago. She is Para 2 Gravida 3, or Para 2 + 0 – the shorthand
does not take into account the outcome of her first pregnancy.
Sonia is now 15 weeks. Her last pregnancy was a twin pregnancy which she
delivered prematurely at 25 weeks’ gestation. While Sonia is Para 2 because she has
had two babies from the twin pregnancy, she is only Gravida 2 as this is her second
pregnancy. She is Gravida 2, Para 2+ 0.
Michelle is late to book, at 30 weeks. She has had one previous pregnancy, an
ectopic that was detected at 7 weeks and was treated medically. She is Para 0
Gravida 2, or Para 0 + 1.


• Domestic
violence: all women should be
asked about this as a matter of routine (see
Chapter 43).

• Support
and social circumstances.

Family history
A family history of diabetes should prompt screening
for gestational diabetes at 28 weeks gestation. Other
conditions that have a strong familial element and
can affect the pregnancy include thromboembolism,
pre-eclampsia and obstetric cholestasis.

Examination
Examination should include:
•
•
•
•


Weight
and height, to calculate BMI.

Blood
pressure.

Urinalysis.

Uterine
size (abdominally) and auscultation of
fetal heart if >12 weeks.

Listening to the heart and lungs and performing
breast and pelvic examinations are part of the
booking visit in some centres.

Booking Investigations
These are summarized in Fig. 45.3.

272

Fig. 45.3 Booking investigations
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Full blood count
Haemoglobin electrophoresis
Blood group and antibody screen
Rubella, syphilis, hepatitis and HIV serology
Urinalysis and midstream urine culture
Ultrasound scan for dating
Screening and prenatal diagnosis

Full blood count
An FBC is performed at booking and again, later
in pregnancy, to detect anaemia (for treatment of
anaemia, see Chapter 36). This will also detect a
low platelet count – idiopathic thrombocytopaenia.
If mild to moderate (platelets 50–100 × 109/L) this
poses little risk to the mother, but platelet levels must
be monitored regularly. If severe, the woman might
require intravenous immunoglobulin. The risk of the
fetus having thrombocytopaenia is around 1 in 10,
and is not predicted by the severity of the mother’s
condition. A platelet count of less than 80 × 109/L is a
contra-indication to epidural anaesthesia

Haemoglobin electrophoresis
Haemoglobinopathies can result in a mistaken
diagnosis of anaemia – carriers of the genes for sickle
cell and thalassaemia have a ‘normal’ haemoglobin that
is lower than average. Diagnosis of haemoglobinopathy

Booking investigations
avoids unnecessary iron supplementation and allows
identification of fetuses at risk of major thalassaemia or
sickle-cell disease. All women whose racial background
predisposes them to haemoglobinopathy should be
offered screening and if the local population contains
more than 15% of people of these races screening
should be universal.

• Sickle-cell trait affects 1 in
10 people of Afro-Caribbean
origin and 1 in 100
people originating from Cyprus and the Indian
subcontinent.

• Alpha-thalassaemia
trait affects 1 in 15 people of
Chinese origin and 1 in 50 people of Cypriot origin.

• Beta-thalassaemia
trait affects 1 in 7 people of
Cypriot origin, 1 in 30 of Chinese origin and 1 in 50
of Afro-Caribbean origin.

Blood group
If the woman is Rhesus negative (dd) and her fetus is
Rhesus positive (DD or Dd) she might form anti-D
antibodies in the event of fetal and maternal blood
mixing. As these can cross the placenta and attack
the fetal blood cells, fetal anaemia due to haemolysis
can result. Giving therapeutic anti-D, which does not
cross the placenta, after any incident where mixing
of the fetal and maternal circulations is likely is
known to reduce the mother’s risk of developing her
own anti-D, and reduces the risk of fetal haemolytic
disease (Fig. 45.4). Prophylactic anti-D can also
be administered, routinely, at 28 and 34 weeks
gestation.

Fig. 45.4 Events after which anti-D is given
• Delivery
• External cephalic version
• Termination of pregnancy
• Manual removal of placenta
• Bleeding in pregnancy after 12 weeks gestation
• Ectopic pregnancy
• Abdominal trauma in the third trimester
• Amniocentesis/CVS
• Evacuation of retained products of conception
• Abruption

45

Antibody screen
This is performed at booking and on at least one
other occasion later in pregnancy, usually around 34
weeks. Antibodies can occur in all women, not just
those who are Rhesus negative. A rising antibody
titre raises concerns about fetal anaemia, prompting
ultrasound scans looking for relevant signs, and, if
indicated, fetal blood sampling.

Rubella antibodies
Rubella acquired in pregnancy can have serious
consequences, so the test is done to see if a woman
has immunity. If IgG is present she has had the
infection or has been vaccinated in the past. Exposure
in the pregnancy should still be investigated if she
develops symptoms but the risk of reinfection
is extremely low. If she is not immune, she can be
advised to avoid any contact with the infection and a
vaccination can be given after the baby is born so that
she will be protected in future pregnancies. As the
vaccine is live it cannot be given during pregnancy.

Syphilis antibodies
The incidence of syphilis is increasing. This is
important in obstetrics because syphilis is easily
treated using penicillin. If missed, congenital syphilis
may have devastating consequences for the newborn.

Hepatitis antibodies
Detection of hepatitis B or C has implications for fetal
health and for the long-term health of the woman
and her partner. Hepatitis B can be transmitted to
the fetus in utero, via transplacental haemorrhage,
or at the time of delivery (vertical transmission).
If infected, the baby will have a 90% chance of
developing chronic hepatitis, with the possible
sequelae of cirrhosis and primary hepatocellular
carcinoma. Identifying a woman who is positive for
hepatitis B antenatally allows the paediatric team the
chance to try to prevent the baby from infection by
administering vaccine neonatally. It also allows the
woman to be monitored by the medical team; her
partner and any other children can be screened.

HIV antibodies
All pregnant women should be encouraged to
undergo screening for HIV infection. Diagnosis and
treatment of HIV infection in pregnancy can improve

273

Antenatal booking and ongoing care
the outcome for the unborn child, the mother, her
partner and any other children (see Chapter 36).
As this is now part of the routine antenatal booking
there should be no stigma attached and an ‘opt-out’
policy is implemented in the UK.

Urinalysis
The urine should be tested for the presence of protein,
blood, glucose, leucocytes and nitrites.

by using a blood test that measures certain protein
concentrations in the maternal blood or by using
ultrasound, which measures the thickness of the fat
pad in the nuchal fold of the fetal neck. Both types
of test can give false-positive and false-negative
results and are only risk assessments rather than
diagnostic tests, but the result can help parents to
decide if they want more invasive tests, for example
amniocentesis.

Proteinuria
If protein is detected on dipstix the first question
should be whether the sample was contaminated with
vaginal discharge and, if so, to ask for a repeat sample.
If protein persists, it must be investigated. Leucocytes
and nitrites suggest the presence of a UTI, which can
be excluded by culturing an MSU; do not be reassured
by lack of symptoms as pregnant women with a UTI
do not always present with the classic symptoms of
‘cystitis’. If an MSU culture is negative and proteinuria
persists, the possibility of renal disease or (later in
pregnancy) pre-eclampsia should be considered (see
Chapter 35). The next step is to obtain a 24-hour
urine collection to quantify the protein. Total protein
excretion increases in pregnancy, so significant
proteinuria should not be diagnosed until more than
0.3 g is excreted in 24 hours.

Glycosuria
Finding glucose on dipstix is very common in
pregnancy. In some cases it is due to impaired glucose
tolerance or gestational diabetes but in others a
glucose tolerance test will not reveal this diagnosis.
In the past it was thought that glycosuria in these
women could be explained by an altered renal
threshold for glucose, but physiological studies have
not proved this. Instead, we must recognize that in
some women glycosuria is normal in pregnancy.

Haematuria
Contamination with vaginal blood must be excluded.
An MSU should be cultured to exclude infection. If
this is negative consider a renal ultrasound and renal
function tests for evidence of stones or renal disease.

Screening and prenatal diagnosis
Assessing the risk that the fetus is affected by some
chromosomal abnormalities can be performed

274

Nuchal thickness is measured
on ultrasound scan between
11 and 14 weeks’ gestation.
Serum screening is performed between 15 and 20
weeks gestation. More recent studies have shown that
a combined nuchal thickness and serum screening
test carried out between 11 and 14 weeks’ gestation
would appear to be more effective at identifying those
at higher risk of chromosomal abnormalities, although
this is not yet routinely used in all units.

Women who opt for diagnostic testing in the form
of amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling might
be doing so for a variety of reasons (see Chapter 33). It
is now recognized that ultrasound scanning at 18–20
weeks is the best method of screening for neural tube
defects (e.g. spina bifida).

Planning Antenatal Care
Most women in the UK currently have ‘shared care’,
where they are booked to deliver in hospital under
the care of a consultant obstetrician but the majority
of their antenatal care is provided by the GP and/or
midwife in the community. The frequency of hospital
visits will be determined by their assessment as low
or high risk at booking. Some women will not need
hospital care at all, booking with the GP or midwife
and arranging to deliver in hospital under their care
or at home. Midwife-led ‘home-from-home’ birth
centres are another option. A minority of women,
who are particularly high-risk, will have all of their
visits with the consultant team in hospital.
A plan for the woman’s care should be made at
her booking visit after any risk factors affecting the
pregnancy have been identified (see Fig. 45.1). The

45

Education at booking
number of visits needed varies from woman to
woman; most antenatal visits follow the pattern:
booking (around 12 weeks), followed by visits at 20,
28, 34, 38 weeks and then weekly until delivery. If
there is cause for concern at any time this schedule
will change to include extra visits, which may be in
the community or at the hospital.

Fig. 45.6 ‘Minor’ symptoms of pregnancy
• Nausea: eating little and often, acupuncture and
anti-emetics. If severe vomiting develops admission
will be needed
• Constipation: increase fruit in diet, drink plenty of water,
and regular aperients as necessary
• Headache: often due to dehydration but paracetamol is
safe in pregnancy
• Pain due to ligament stretch and symphysis pubis
separation: helped by regular paracetamol and
physiotherapy
• Piles (haemorrhoids): soothing cream available, ice packs
an alternative
• Reflux (heartburn): avoid spicy foods, sleep in a more
upright position, use liquid antacid preparations,
sometimes use H2-blockers, e.g. ranitidine

Education at Booking
The booking visit is an opportunity for the woman
to ask questions regarding her antenatal care and
delivery, and for the midwife or doctor to ensure that
advice about the following is given:
• Folic acid 0.4 mg: taking folate supplements
before conception and in the first trimester of
pregnancy reduces the risk of fetal neural tube
defects.
• Diet: certain foods are not advisable in pregnancy
(Fig. 45.5).
• Exercise: it is safe to continue exercising in
pregnancy but sensible to modify the exercise
routines as the pregnancy advances and to bear in
mind that it is far easier to strain muscles because
of increased progesterone levels.
• Seatbelts: it is illegal to travel by car without a
seatbelt and pregnancy is not an exemption. The
belt should be worn above and below, not across
the ‘bump’.

Fig. 45.6 ‘Minor’ symptoms of pregnancy – appropriate advice and
treatment.


• Smoking:
smoking increases the risk of fetal and
neonatal complications; it is also associated with
cot death and childhood illnesses.

• Toxoplasma:
infection is acquired from contact
with cat faeces, which can contaminate soil.
Pregnant women are advised to wash fruit and
salad carefully, not to handle cat litter and to wear
gloves if gardening. Animals can ingest infected
soil, which can pass through the food chain
unless meat is cooked thoroughly, so women
are advised not to eat uncooked or ‘rare’ meat in
pregnancy.

Antenatal visits after booking
At each visit following booking these points are
covered:
•
•
•
•
•


General
health and well-being.

Fetal
movements.

Urinalysis.

Blood
pressure.

Abdominal
palpation for fetal growth, lie and
presentation.

• Auscultation
of the fetal heart.
Any worries or symptoms can be discussed. The socalled ‘minor’ symptoms of pregnancy can cause
major upset, yet some are simply treated. Common
problems and suitable advice/treatment are shown
in Fig. 45.6.

Examination

46

Objective
• After reading this chapter, you should be able to understand the basic techniques of
antenatal and gynaecological clinical examination.

General Examination
General examination of the patient is extremely
important and is often overlooked. Ensure that the
patient is comfortable and not unduly exposed.
Obstetric patients should not be examined flat on
their backs because of the risk of postural supine
hypotensive syndrome. This occurs when lying flat:
the pregnant uterus compresses the aorta and reduces
blood flow back to the maternal heart. As a result, the
patient feels faint. The following general assessment
should be made quickly:
• General well-being.
• Body
mass index (BMI)

• Cardiovascular
system, including pulse, blood

pressure, cardiac murmurs and clinical signs
of anaemia; oedema can affect the hands, the
periorbital region, the legs and the sacral region.
• Respiratory
system.

The urine should be tested for the presence of sugar,
protein and blood.

A chaperone should always
be used when performing a
gynaecological examination,
regardless of whether the doctor is male or female.

Abdominal Examination

Inspection
Inspection of the abdomen is an important part of
the abdominal examination.

Surgical scars
Surgical scars are often overlooked because of
successful attempts to produce cosmetically pleasing
scars. Transverse suprapubic and laparoscopy scars
are commonly missed unless specifically looked for.
Always check the umbilicus and pubic hairline for
hidden scars. Multiple small scars might be present
following minimal access surgical procedures.

Abdominal masses
Inspection for abdominal masses is important,
although they might not be evident on inspection
alone because of an increased BMI. The size and
shape of the abdomen should be noted.

Stigmata of pregnancy
Striae gravidarum (stretch marks) are caused by
pregnancy hormones that stimulate the splitting of the
dermis and can occur relatively early in pregnancy. New
striae appear red and sometimes inflamed and can be
sore and itchy, old striae from previous pregnancies
are pale and silvery. They usually appear on the lower
abdomen, upper thighs, buttocks and breasts.
Increased skin pigmentation can occur in
pregnancy and results in the linea nigra – midline
pigmentation from the xiphisternum to the
symphysis pubis. Other areas that can undergo
pigmentation in pregnancy include the nipples, the
vulva, the umbilicus and recent abdominal scars.

Palpation
Before palpating the abdomen always enquire
about areas of tenderness and palpate these areas
last. Using the palm of the hand, gently palpate the
four quadrants of the abdomen to elicit tenderness,
guarding and rebound.

You should ascertain whether it is arising from the
pelvis. If you cannot palpate the lower aspect of the
mass it is probably arising from the pelvis. Pelvic
tumours can generally be moved from side to side
but not up and down. Percussion can help outline the
borders of a mass in an obese patient. Auscultation
of the abdomen is important to assess bowel sounds
and in an obstetric patient the fetal heart should be
auscultated using a pinard or a sonicaid.

Obstetric palpation
Uterine size
Uterine size is assessed by palpation and is a skill
that is acquired through experience. A rough guide
to the uterine size can be made from assessment of
the fundal height in relation to the topography
of the abdomen, for example the symphysis pubis,
umbilicus and xiphisternum (Fig. 46.1). The fundus
of the uterus should not be palpable abdominally
until 12 weeks gestation. By 36 weeks the fundus
should be almost at the level of the xiphisternum,
following which it drops as the fetal head engages
into the maternal pelvis.
When palpating the uterine fundus, always
start at the xiphisternum and work towards the
umbilicus using the medial border of the left hand
or the fingertips. Percussing the fundus can be useful
in obese women. Measuring the distance from
the fundus to the symphysis pubis in centimetres

278

(the symphysis–fundal height) is a more objective
method of assessing fundal height than using
topography alone. It is not a replacement for careful
palpation. The symphysis–fundal height measurement
±3 cm should equal the number of weeks amenorrhoea
after 24 weeks gestation. Similarly, after 28 weeks
gestation the abdominal girth measured in inches at
the level of the umbilicus should equal the number of
weeks amenorrhoea, although this is less reliable and
not routinely peformed.

Number of fetuses
The number of fetuses present can be calculated by
assessing the number of fetal poles present. ‘Fetal
pole’ is the term used to denote the head or the
breech. In a singleton pregnancy, two poles should be
palpable unless the presenting part is deeply engaged
in the pelvis. In multiple pregnancies, the number
of poles present minus one should be palpable. For
example, four poles are present in a twin pregnancy
and only three should be palpable as one is usually
tucked away out of reach. In a triplet pregnancy, six
poles are present and five should be palpable, and so
on. This requires a high level of skill in abdominal
palpation but don’t worry, the patient will usually tell
you how many fetuses are present!

Fetal lie
This is the relationship between the long axis of the
fetus and the long axis of the uterus. This can be
longitudinal, transverse or oblique (Fig. 46.2).

Fetal presentation
This is the part of the fetus that presents to the
maternal pelvis. If the head is situated over the pelvis
this is termed a ‘cephalic presentation’. Three different
types of cephalic presentation can occur, depending
on the degree of flexion of the head on the fetal spine
(see Fig. 40.5):
• A
 well flexed head will present by the vertex
(the area bordered by the parietal bones and the
anterior and posterior fontanelles).
• A
 partly extended head will present by the brow.
• A
 fully extended head will present by the face.
In a breech presentation the buttocks occupy the lower
segment, and in an oblique lie the shoulder generally
presents (Fig. 46.3). Any presentation other than a
vertex presentation is called a malpresentation.

Abdominal examination

46

An idea of the position can be gained at abdominal
palpation by determining the position of the fetal
back. If the back lies:
longitudinal

transverse

• On
 the maternal left, the position is likely to be
left occipitotransverse.
• On
 the maternal right, the position is likely to be
right occipitotransverse.
• More
posteriorly (i.e. towards the mother’s

spine), the position is likely to be left or right
occipitoposterior.
• Anteriorly,
the position is likely to be left or right

occipitoanterior (Fig. 46.5).
The position of the presenting part can be assessed
accurately only by vaginal examination, because the
head might not lie in the same axis as the fetal trunk.

oblique

oblique

Attitude
This term is no longer commonly used. It describes
the relationship of the fetal parts to the fetus itself.
For instance, when the head, back and limbs of the
fetus are flexed, as in the classic ‘fetal position’, the
fetus has a flexed attitude; conversely it can be said to
have an extended attitude.

Liquor volume
Fig. 46.2 The fetal lie. The relationship of the long axis of the fetus to
the long axis of the uterus.

Engagement
The fetal head is said to be engaged when the widest
diameter of the head (the biparietal diameter)
has passed through the pelvic brim. Abdominal
palpation of the head is assessed in fifths and is
measured by palpating the angle between the head
and the symphysis pubis (Fig. 46.4). When three or
more fifths of the head are palpable abdominally
the head is not engaged. When two or fewer fifths of
the head are palpable the head is clinically engaged.
This should equate to the station found on vaginal
examination (see below).

Position
The position of the presenting part is defined as the
relationship of the denominator of the presenting
part to the maternal pelvis. The denominator changes
according to the presenting part; the occiput in a
cephalic presentation, the mentum (chin) in a face
presentation and the sacrum in a breech presentation.

Clinical assessment of liquor volume is not as
accurate as objective assessment using ultrasound.
However, subjective assessment can alert the
examiner to the possibility of reduced or increased
liquor volume and instigation of the necessary
investigations. Reduced liquor volume might be
suggested when the uterus is small for dates with
easily palpable fetal parts producing an irregular
firm outline to the uterus. Increased liquor volume
causes a large-for-dates uterus that is smooth
and rounded and in which the fetal parts are
almost impossible to distinguish. If suspected,
an ultrasound scan should be ordered to assess
objective measurements such as depth of deepest
pool or amniotic fluid index.

Difficulty palpating fetal parts
Many students worry that they will not be able
to ascertain all the above information during an
obstetric abdominal palpation. It is not always
possible even in the most experienced hands but it
is important to understand why this might be so.
Fig. 46.6 shows some situations when palpation of
the fetal parts might prove difficult.

Pelvic Examination

Gynaecological pelvic examination
There are three important steps when performing a
pelvic examination:

During a gynaecological examination
the pelvic examination should always be
preceded by inspection of the external
genitals, and vaginal walls.

1. External inspection of the vulva.
2. Internal inspection of the vagina and cervix via
a speculum.
3. Bimanual examination of the pelvis.

External examination of the vulva

The most common position for carrying out a pelvic
examination is the dorsal position with the woman
lying on her back with her knees flexed. Make sure
that the patient is as comfortable as possible and
not too exposed. External inspection only can be
performed on a patient who is virgo intacta.

The presence of abnormal discharge on the vulva
should be noted, as should the anatomy of the
external genitalia (Fig. 46.7). Parting the labia with
the left hand, the entire area should be carefully
inspected for inflammation, ulceration, swellings,
atrophic changes and leucoplakia (white plaques)

and the clitoris and urethral orifice inspected. A
deficient or scarred perineum are clues to previous
trauma due to vaginal delivery. Vaginal or uterine
prolapse through the introitus is assessed with
and without the patient bearing down and stress
incontinence might be demonstrated when the
patient coughs. Assessment of prolapse can only be
adequately made with the patient in the left lateral
position using a Sims’ speculum (see Chapter 27).

Internal inspection of the vagina and cervix
To inspect the vagina and cervix, a speculum is used.
Two types of specula are used commonly, the Cusco’s
(bivalve) and the Sims’ specula (Fig. 46.8).
The Cusco’s speculum is used with the patient in
the dorsal position and consists of two blades hinged
outside the patient. When the blades are opened,
the anterior and posterior walls of the vagina are
separated allowing the vaginal fornices and cervix to
be visualized. The main disadvantage of the Cusco’s
speculum is that the anterior and posterior walls of
the vagina cannot be assessed adequately.

46

The Sims’ speculum is used to inspect the anterior
and posterior walls of the vagina and is an excellent
tool for assessing uterovaginal prolapse. It was
originally developed to examine vaginal fistulae.
With the patient in the left lateral, or Sims’, position
the blade of the speculum is inserted into the vagina
and used to retract either the anterior or posterior
walls. Uterovaginal prolapse can then be assessed
with the patient bearing down.

When taking a smear test with
the conventional Ayre’s spatula
a brush should always be
used to sample the endocervix as well as the spatula.
Liquid based cytology is a new technique for taking
cervical smears and reduces the need to repeat smears
because of inadequate/unsatisfactory specimens. A
soft plastic brush is used to perform this and the cells
are transported in fluid. Liquid based cytology is likely
to become routine practice for taking cervical smears
in the near future.

Bimanual examination
It is usual to perform an internal examination using
the lubricated index and middle fingers of the right
hand, although in nulligravid and postmenopausal
women it might be necessary to use only the index
finger. Palpation of the vaginal walls is important to
exclude scarring, cysts and tumours that can easily be
missed on inspection. The vaginal fornices should

be examined for scarring, thickening and swellings
that will suggest pelvic pathology. The size, shape,
position, consistency, angle and mobility of the
cervix should be assessed. Moving the cervix from
side to side might elicit cervical excitation pain and
elevating the cervix anteriorly, thereby stretching
the uterosacral ligaments, might cause pain in the
presence of endometriosis.
The fingers of the right hand are then used to
elevate or steady the uterus while the left hand
palpates abdominally. An anteverted uterus is usually
palpable between the two hands. A retroverted uterus
is usually felt as a swelling in the posterior fornix and
is not bimanually palpable unless it is flipped forward
into an anteverted position and elevated into the
anterior part of the pelvis. The different combinations
of version and flexion of the uterus are shown in
Fig. 46.9. The size, position, consistency, outline and
mobility of the uterus should all be noted. A pregnant
uterus should feel soft and globular and roughly the
size of an apple, large orange and grapefruit at 6, 8
and 12 weeks gestation, respectively.
To examine the adnexa, the fingers of the right
hand should be positioned in one of the lateral
fornices and the adnexal region palpated between
the two hands. Normal premenopausal ovaries
are not always palpable depending on the size of
the patient. Fallopian tubes and postmenopausal
ovaries should not be palpable. If an adnexal mass is
discovered, then its size, shape, consistency, mobility
and whether it is fixed to the uterus or not should
all be noted. The presence and degree of tenderness
should be noted.

Obstetric pelvic examination
There are four components to the obstetric pelvic
examination:

An obstetric examination is incomplete
without a blood pressure check,
urinanalysis and auscultation of the fetus.

External examination of the vulva
The blood flow through the vulva and vagina
increases dramatically in pregnancy. The vulva
might look swollen and oedematous secondary to
engorgement. The presence of vulval varicosities
should be noted. Note the presence of vaginal
discharge or leaking amniotic fluid. In certain ethnic
groups, it may be appropriate to assess the vaginal
introitus for signs of female circumcision (or female
genital mutilation FGM).

46

Pelvic examination

Internal inspection of the vagina and cervix
Examination of the vagina and cervix through a
sterile Cusco’s speculum should be performed
using an aseptic technique. The vagina and cervix
might take on a bluish tinge compared with the
non-pregnant state. Increased vaginal and cervical
secretions are normal in pregnancy. Inspection of the
cervix might reveal amniotic fluid draining through
the cervical os. Digital examination in the presence of
ruptured membranes is likely to increase the risk of
ascending infection. Exclusion of cervical pathology
is important in the presence of APH, although care
must be taken because, in the presence of placenta
praevia, bleeding might be exacerbated.

���������

�����������������

Vaginal examination
This should be performed under aseptic conditions in
the presence of ruptured membranes. Once the cervix
has been identified, the following characteristics
should be determined:
•
•
•
•
•

Dilatation.

Length.

Station
of presenting part.

Consistency.

Position.


Cervical dilatation
Cervical dilatation is assessed in centimetres using
the examining fingers. One finger-breadth is roughly
1–1.5 cm. Full dilatation of the cervix is equivalent to
10 cm dilatation.
Cervical length
The normal length of the cervix is about 3 cm and
shortening occurs as the cervix effaces due to uterine
contractions (Fig. 46.10).
Station of the presenting part
The station of the presenting part is determined by
how much the presenting part has descended into
the pelvis. The station is defined as the number
of centimetres above or below a fixed point in the
maternal pelvis, the ischial spines. This should
equate to the engagement found on abdominal
palpation.
Cervical consistency
Softening of the cervix occurs as pregnancy progresses
aiding cervical effacement and dilatation. The
consistency of the cervix can be described as firm,
mid-consistency or soft.

�������������

Fig. 46.10 Effacement of the cervix.

Cervical position
This describes where the cervix is situated in the
anteroposterior plane of the pelvis. As the cervix
becomes effaced and dilated it tends to be pulled
from a posterior to a more anterior position.
The Bishop score
Using the above characteristics, Bishop devised
a scoring system to evaluate the ‘ripeness’ or
favourability of the cervix (Fig. 46.12). This system

is often used when inducing labour to assess the
likelihood of success. The higher the score, the
more favourable the cervix and the more likely
that induction of labour will be successful. It can
also be used to assess cervical change in threatened
premature labour.
Defining the position of the presenting part
With a cephalic presentation, the anterior and
posterior fontanelles and the sagittal sutures should
be identified. The posterior fontanelle is Y-shaped
and is formed when the three sutures between the
occipital and parietal bones meet. The anterior
fontanelle is larger, diamond-shaped and formed by
the four sutures between the parietal and temporal
bones meeting (Fig. 46.13). The denominator for a
cephalic presentation is the occiput and for a breech
presentation the sacrum. Having identified the
denominator, the position of the presenting part can
be defined (Fig. 46.14).

When assessing progress
in labour one must always
comment on engagement of
head, cervical dilatation, cervical effacement, station
of head in relation to ischial spines, position of head,
moulding, caput and liquor colour (eg meconium
staining).

Clinical pelvimetry examination
There are four basic pelvic types:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Gynaecoid.
Android.
Ellipsoid.
Platypoid.

Clinical assessment of the pelvis will reveal the
characteristics of these pelvic types. Fig. 46.15
summarizes the characteristics of the four basic pelvic
types. In practice, this type of examination is now less
used.
The pelvic inlet
The pelvic inlet is assessed clinically by measuring the
diagonal conjugate (Fig. 46.16). This is the distance
from the sacral promontory to the inferoposterior
margin of the symphysis pubis (the true conjugate
is measured to the anteroposterior margin of the
symphysis pubis). In a normal gynaecoid pelvis the
sacral promontory cannot usually be reached. If it is,
the pelvic inlet is significantly reduced.
The pelvic cavity
The pelvic cavity is assessed by palpating the sacral
curve, which should be concave away from the
examining fingers (Fig. 46.17). A straight sacrum

indicates a reduced pelvic capacity. The sacrospinous
ligament runs from the ischial spine to the sacrum
and should be wide enough to accommodate more
than two fingers (>3 cm). Prominent ischial spines
suggest a shortened interspinous distance.
The pelvic outlet
The pelvic outlet is assessed by the subpubic angle
and the intertuberous distance. A subpubic angle of
less than 90° and an intertuberous distance of less
than four knuckles wide indicate the possibility of a
reduced outlet (Fig. 46.18).

It has become increasingly
recognized that the best test of
a pelvis is the dynamic process
of labour itself, so formal pelvic assessment is no
longer performed as a routine. However, the Bishop
score is used in the assessment of cervical favourability
prior to induction of labour.

Common investigations

47

Objective
• After reading this chapter, you should understand some of the commoner investigations
used in OB/GYN practice and their indications.

Imaging Techniques
Imaging techniques are used widely in both obstetrics
and gynaecology. Results of imaging tests should be
interpreted carefully in the light of the history and
clinical findings.

Ultrasound scanning
Ultrasound examination of the pregnant and nonpregnant pelvis is probably the most common
investigation performed in obstetrics and gynaecology.
Ultrasound waves passing through the pelvis are
reflected in varying degrees depending on the
density of the tissues present. For instance, bone is
very reflective (or echogenic) and appears white on
the monitor, whereas fluid is less echogenic and
appears dark on the monitor. Interpretation of these
echoes is the mainstay of diagnosis in ultrasound.

While ultrasound examination
of the female pelvis is a
common and often routine
examination, its findings should always be interpreted
within the clinical picture.

The uterus
The dimensions of the uterus can be measured and the
position noted. Abnormal textures in the myometrium
can suggest the presence of fibroids or adenomyosis.
The midline echo corresponds to the endometrial
thickness and will vary depending on the menstrual
cycle. Pathology of the endometrial cavity, such as
endometrial hyperplasia, endometrial polyps or
submucous fibroids, might be detected. In some centres,
this is aided by sonohysterography, in which saline
is instilled into the uterine cavity and abnormalities
shown in outline. Intrauterine contraceptive devices
(IUCDs) will show up as very bright echoes.

The ovaries
The size and position of the ovaries can be assessed.
In polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS, see Chapter
20), the polycystic ovary is on average twice the
normal volume with thickened central stroma and 10
or more peripherally sited follicles. Follicular tracking
is possible in women trying to conceive. Ovarian
tumours can be identified ultrasonographically
but differentiation between benign and malignant
tumours cannot be made with certainty. Fig. 47.1
shows some of the ultrasound characteristics of
benign and malignant ovarian tumours.

The fallopian tubes
The non-pregnant pelvis
To examine the non-pregnant pelvis by abdominal
ultrasound a full bladder is required. This lifts
the uterus from under the pubic bone, allowing a
‘window’ through which to view the pelvic contents
and helps push the bowel out of the pelvis. This
bladder filling is avoided by performing the scan
using a transvaginal probe.

The fallopian tubes are not normally visible by
ultrasound. However, when they are blocked and
distended with fluid (hydrosalpinx) they will appear as
cystic structures that might be mistaken for ovarian cysts.

Ultrasound and pregnancy
A gestation sac can be seen in the uterine cavity
from as early as 5 weeks amenorrhoea, especially

Anomaly scans
Most obstetric units offer routine anomaly scans
between 18 and 22 weeks gestation. Different
fetal anomalies are best detected at different times
throughout the pregnancy, but 18–20 weeks appears
to be the optimum time for a screening anomaly
scan. Apart from gross anatomical defects, certain
‘markers’, such as choroid plexus cysts, renal pelvicaliceal dilatation and the cardiac ‘golfball’ sign,
might be identified and can be associated with
chromosomal abnormalities.

Fetal growth
when using a transvaginal probe. The fetal heart is
detectable with ultrasound by 6 weeks amenorrhoea.
Crown–rump length (CRL) is a useful measurement
with which to date the fetus up to 13+6 weeks
amenorrhoea (Fig. 47.2), after which time CRL
measurement becomes inaccurate due to flexion
of the fetus. After the first trimester, the biparietal
diameter (BPD) is a more accurate measurement with
which to date the pregnancy.

Early pregnancy complications
A delayed or missed miscarriage occurs when the
embryo fails to develop or dies in utero (see Chapter
29). In the presence of an ectopic pregnancy, the usual
ultrasonic finding is that of a thickened endometrium
in the presence of an adnexal mass. In only about
5% of ectopic pregnancies can a viable pregnancy be
seen outside the uterus with ultrasound. The most
important role of ultrasound in the management of a
suspected ectopic pregnancy is to confirm or exclude
a viable intrauterine pregnancy.

Fig. 47.2 Ultrasound in early pregnancy.

292

Fetal growth is assessed clinically in a normal
singleton pregnancy. In situations when the uterine
size is not compatible with dates or clinical assess­
ment is difficult, for instance in the presence of
obesity or multiple pregnancy, objective measure­
ments of fetal head circumference (HC), BPD and
abdominal circumference (AC) are made using
ultrasound and plotted on fetal growth charts.
Scanning at regular intervals allows the growth of the
fetus to be monitored.

Assessment of liquor volume
This is useful in the management of IUGR and
postdates pregnancy. Reduced liquor volume can
indicate the presence of placental insufficiency as
the stressed fetus passes less urine, and might be an
indication for delivery of the fetus depending on the
clinical background. Reduced liquor might also be due
to spontaneous rupture of the membranes (SROM).

Doppler studies
Doppler ultrasound assessment of the uteroplacental
blood flow can be useful in the presence of fetal
growth restriction due to placental insufficiency.
Normally there is continuous flow through the
umbilical artery to the placenta including during
fetal diastole, known as end diastolic flow. Absent
or reversed end diastolic flow in the umbilical artery
suggest placental resistance to the returning blood.
Such a compromised fetus diverts its blood flow to
essential organs such as the brain and heart. Thus
dilatation of the fetal middle cerebral blood vessels
is seen. Later on, venous dopplers may indicate heart
failure and indicate the need for delivery. Doppler
studies need to be interpreted carefully in the light of
the clinical picture.

Hysteroscopy and pipelle biopsy

47

Safety of ultrasound scanning
Experimental evidence has not shown any harmful effects
of ultrasound when used as a diagnostic test. However
more powerful modes of scanning such as colour flow
Doppler should be only used if clinically indicated.

X-ray
Two X-ray procedures that were commonly used in
the past are now not used so frequently. With lateral
pelvimetry in particular, the information gained does
not always alter management and therefore does not
warrant the exposure to X-rays.
1. Erect lateral pelvimetry (ELP): can be used in
situations where a contracted pelvis needs to be
excluded, for instance in the management of a
breech presentation. The inlet and outlet of
the pelvis can be measured objectively as can
the curve of the sacrum. This procedure can be
performed using CT scanning but for reasons
already discussed (see Chapter 39) is less
commonly used these days.
2. Hysterosalpingography (HSG): can be used to
assess the uterine cavity and the patency of the
fallopian tubes (Fig. 47.3). A catheter is inserted
into the cervix and radiocontrast medium
injected into the uterine cavity while X-rays are
taken. It does not allow the exclusion of pelvic
pathology as laparoscopy does, but is still useful
in the presence of tubal blockage to assess
whether the blockage is distal or proximal; it also
allows excellent delineation of the uterine cavity.
If there is clinical evidence of pelvic disease such
as PID or endometriosis then a laparoscopy
should be performed in preference to a HSG.
Antibiotic prophylaxis should be given to reduce
the complication of PID.

Laparoscopy
Laparoscopy is the mainstay of diagnosing pelvic
disease and has replaced exploratory laparotomy. The
advantage of laparoscopy over imaging techniques is
that the pelvic and other intra-abdominal organs can
be visualized directly through endoscopes.

Technique
The vast majority of procedures are performed
under general anaesthesia. Having emptied the

bladder, a Veress needle is inserted into the lower
abdomen through a subumbilical incision. Carbon
dioxide is pumped into the peritoneal cavity to
produce a pneumoperitoneum (to a pressure of
approximately 18–20 mmHg) and then a trocar and
cannula are inserted through the same incision into
the pneumoperitoneum. A laparoscope can then
be passed down the cannula and the pelvic organs
visualized (Fig. 47.4). Complications of laparoscopy
(and their rates per 1000) include:
•
•
•
•

bowel
injury (0.6)

bladder
injury (0.3)

ureteric
injury (0.3)

vascular
injury (0.1).

Laparoscopy is the gold-standard
investigation of pelvic pain.

Hysteroscopy and Pipelle
BIOPSY
A hysteroscope is an endoscope that is inserted
transcervically to inspect the uterine cavity (Fig.
47.5). It is the best way of identifying intrauterine
pathology such as endometrial polyps, submucous
fibroids and endometrial carcinoma and has
replaced the conventional D&C for this purpose.
It can be performed under either general or local
anaesthesia. A distension medium is required to
separate the uterine walls, normal saline and carbon
dioxide being the most commonly used. It is a

relatively safe procedure but complications include
infection, perforation of the uterus and rarely gas
embolism.
In some centres, first line investigation may be a
pipelle in combination with transvaginal sonography.

294

The pipelle consists of a plastic tube 1–2 mm in
diameter which is inserted transcervically in the
out-patient clinic. Withdrawing the plunger sucks in a
sample of endometrium by negative pressure, which
is sent for histology.

Urodynamics

Hysteroscopy is now the gold-standard
investigation of abnormal uterine bleeding
and can be performed as an outpatient
investigation.

Cervical Cytology/
Colposcopy
Squamous carcinoma of the cervix is amenable
to screening because it exhibits a pre-invasive
phase (see Chapter 24). Screening is carried out by
cytological examination of cervical smears using the
Papanicolaou test. Using a Cuscos speculum, the
visible cervix is gently swept through 360° five times
with a cervical sampler (Fig. 47.6). Liquid based
cytology has recently been introduced in the UK to
replace the classic transport method using a slide. The
cellular sample is washed off the spatula into a fluid
medium. This technique has effectively reduced the
rate of inadequate smears and therefore the need to
recall women for a repeat smear.
Women with smears suggestive of CIN or women
with an abnormal-looking cervix are then referred for
colposcopy. The colposcope is a binocular microscope
enabling the surface epithelium of the cervix to
be assessed under magnification and is usually
performed in the outpatient setting. The patient is
positioned in a modified lithotomy position and
the cervix exposed using a Cuscos speculum. The
cervix is then viewed through the colposcope to
identify any lesions such as leucoplakia or frank
invasive carcinoma. Acetic acid solution (5%) is
gently but liberally applied to the entire surface of
the cervix. Coagulation of proteins by the acetic acid
in abnormal epithelial areas produces white changes,
so called acetowhite changes.
Areas of CIN appear as distinct acetowhite lesions
with clearly demarcated edges and the associated
abnormal vessel formation produces the typical
mosaic and punctate patterns. The extent of the

47

lesion should be noted, with particular regard paid
to extension into the cervical canal. All abnormallooking areas should be biopsied for histological
assessment.

Urodynamics
This term includes all the tests that assess the function
of the lower urinary tract disorders, which include
incontinence and voiding difficulties (see Chapter 27).

Flow studies
Using a flowmeter, the flow rate of urine can
be measured. This should be above 15 mL per
second and a low flow rate suggests either outflow
obstruction or poor detrusor contraction.

Cystometry
The bladder is a reservoir designed to increase
in volume at low pressure. Cystometry measures
bladder pressure during filling or voiding. Pressure
catheters are inserted into the bladder via the urethra
and also the rectum. The rectal catheter represents
intra-abdominal pressure and is subtracted from the
intravesical pressure to give the detrusor pressure.
Detrusor pressure is measured during rapid filling
of the bladder to detect the presence of detrusor
instability. During voiding, detrusor contractility can
be measured and outflow resistance and detrusor
function assessed.

Videocystourethrography
Videocystourethrography (VCU) is the most
informative of urodynamic studies and involves
radiologically monitoring the bladder and
urethra during cystometry. Congenital anomalies,
diverticulae, fistulae and ureteric reflux can all be
identified during the filling phase. On coughing,
bladder neck descent and stress urinary incontinence
might be seen. On voiding, ureteric reflux, urethral
fistulae and outflow pathology can be identified.

inflammatory disease to visualize pus and
pelvic inflammation
d. T—A smear test should be performed if clinically
indicated, for example, if there is associated
irregular vaginal bleeding
e. F—An endocervical swab is necessary to exclude
chlamydial infection

3. a. F—Secondary dysmenorrhoea suggests
endometriosis
b. T—You must know the date of the last menstrual

EMQ answers

1. Theme: Abnormal Bleeding
1. Endometriosis (b)
One of the classic ways in which endometriosis
presents is with increasingly heavy and painful
periods. The pain typically commences before the
period and/or lasts for a few days after the period
(secondary dysmenorrhoea).
2. Cervical carcinom a (f)
Cervical carcinoma typically presents with painless
post-coital bleeding and is particularly likely in this
age group.
3. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) (a)
Lower abdominal pain and tenderness (typically
bilateral) associated with a temperature and vaginal
discharge are commonly due to PID.
4. Fibroids (i)
A bulky uterus in this age group associated with
heavy periods is often due to uterine enlargement
secondary to fibroids.
5. Hypothyroidism (h)
This must not be forgotten as a possible medical
cause of menorrhagia, particularly in the
perimenopausal era. Two of the commonest
symptoms are increasing tiredness and weight gain.

Candida albicans (a)
Cervical carcinoma (d)
Vesicovaginal fistula (e)
Chlamydia trachomatis (i)
Bacterial vaginosis (f)

4. Theme: Subfertility
1. Pelvic inflammatory disease (f)
 PID has caused hydrosalpinges and bilateral tubal
occlusion
2. Polycystic ovary syndrome (a)
The progesterone level indicates anovulation, and the
raised LH:FSH ratio points to PCOS as the cause of
anovulation.

3. Anorexia nervosa (d)
The progesterone level indicates anovulation
4. Obstructive azoospermia (c)
The testes are producing sperm but they are not
passing into the seminal fluid, due to obstruction or
absence of the vas, or obstruction of the epididymis.
5. Klinefelter’s syndrome (b)
Men who are XXY have small soft testes which do not
produce sperm.

Fibroid degeneration (a)
Pre-eclampsia (g)

7. Theme: Stillbirth
1. 47XY (g)
A normal karyotype is 46XX or 46XY. This analysis
shows 47XY, indicating that the fetus is male and has
an extra chromosome – trisomy 21 is seen in Down’s
syndrome.
2. Protein = 5.1 g/L (f)
Proteinuria of greater than 0.3 g/L is significant and
can point to a diagnosis of pre-eclampsia.
3. Parvovirus IgM positive, IgG negative (d)
Parvovirus infection can pass across the placenta and
cause fetal cardiac failure (leading to hydrops) and
fetal death. Positive IgM and negative IgG confirms
recent infection.
4. ALT = 60 iu/L (a)
Transaminases are often raised in cholestasis, as are
bile acids. However, the levels of liver function tests
alone do not make the diagnosis, which must also
be based on the clinical picture and the absence of
hepatitis.

331

EMQ answers
5. Fetal anaemia and positive Coombs test (c)

4. Fistula (g)

Rhesus disease causes fetal haemolysis, and therefore
anaemia. Coombs test proves the presence of
antibodies.
6. HbA1c = 15% (b)

This is a recognised complication of prolonged
obstructed labour and leads to continuous
incontinence due to the presence of a urinary fistula,
often connecting to the vagina. It is a particular
problem in Somalia where women often have to walk
miles to reach the nearest hospital.

This level of glycosylated haemoglobin indicates poor
control, which predisposes to congenital anomalies
and intrauterine death.

Cervical fibroid (a)
Transverse lie (i)
(j)

9. Theme: Maternal Collapse
1. Uterine atony (a)
A long labour, the need for syntocinon augmentation
and a big baby all predispose to poor uterine
contraction after delivery leading to post-partum
haemorrhage.
2. Postural hypotension (c)
This multipara is predisposed to anaemia, which will
have been exacerbated by her blood loss at caesarean
section. The standing up has led to her fainting.
3. Pulmonary embolism (e)
Pregnancy, obesity and immobility are all risk factors
for thromboembolic disease.
4. Sepsis (h)
This woman has developed chorioamnionitis, with
infection ascending up and around the baby, producing
a systemic illness. She needs antibiotic treatment and
delivery.
5. Eclampsia (g)
Hypertension and proteinuria raise suspicion of
pre-eclampsia, which can rapidly deteriorate into an
eclamptic episode. Fits in pregnancy, even in those
previously labeled epileptic, should always be
suspected of being related to pre-eclampsia.

10. Theme: Urinary Incontinence
1. Genuine stress incontinence (c)
It is essential that urodynamic investigations have
been performed to exclude detrusor overactivity as a
cause of incontinence during laughing, sneezing etc.
2. Urinary tract infection (b)
Symptoms of frequency, dysuria and nocturia are
often due to a urinary tract infection and this diagnosis
is supported by presence of protein in the urine.
3. Idiopathic detrusor overactivity (d)
Symptoms of urgency, nocturia and urge
incontinence in this age group are often due to
detrusor overactivity – the diagnosis should be
confirmed with urodynamics.

332

5. Detrusor overactivity (DO) due to menopause (j)
DO symptoms are common in the menopause due to
deterioration the collagen in the urethra and bladder
from oestrogen deficiency.

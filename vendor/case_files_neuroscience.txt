ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

The inspiration for this basic science series occurred at an educational retreat
led by Dr. Maximillian Buja, who at the time was the Dean of the medical
school. Dr. Buja served as Dean of the University of Texas Health Science
Center–Houston Medical School from 1995 to 2003 before being appointed
Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs. It has been such a joy to work
together with Drs. Jandial and Snyder, who are brilliant neuroscientists and
teachers. It has been a privilege to work with Martin Paukert, a fourth year
medical student at University of Texas Medical School at Houston, likely the
brightest and most talented medical student I have encountered. It has been an
absolutely wonderful inspiration working with a student with the passion,
intellect, and diligence as Pooja Rani Patel. Pooja would like to acknowledge
her friends and family, including her brother Poorav Kumar Rohatgi, her
parents Drs. Praveen Kumar and Nalini Rohatgi, and especially her husband, Dr. Akash J. Patel, for supporting her and always encouraging her to
reach her fullest potential.
I would like to thank McGraw-Hill for believing in the concept of teaching
by clinical cases. I owe a great debt to Catherine Johnson, who has been a fantastically encouraging and enthusiastic editor. At St. Joseph Medical Center, I
would like to recognize our outstanding administrators: Phil Robinson, Pat
Mathews, Laura Fortin, Dori Upton, and Kim Kendall, and Drs. Thomas Taylor
and John Bertini. At Methodist Hospital, I appreciate Drs. Mark Boom, Dirk
Sostman, Judy Paukert, Alan Kaplan, and Karin Larsen-Pollack, and Reggie
Abraham. I appreciate Marla Buffington’s advice and assistance. Without the
help from my colleagues, Drs. Konrad Harms, Jeané Simmons, and Priti
Schachel, this manuscript could not have been written. Most importantly, I am
humbled by the love, affection, and encouragement from my lovely wife Terri,
and our four children, Andy, Michael, Allison, and Christina.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the diverse knowledge within a field such as neuroscience is a formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, relate it to a
clinical setting, and apply it to the context of the individual patient. To gain
these skills, the student learns best with good models, appropriate guidance by
experienced teachers, and inspiration toward self-directed, diligent reading.
Clearly, there is no replacement for education at the bench. Even with accurate
knowledge of the basic science, the application of that knowledge is not
always easy. Thus, this collection of patient cases is designed to simulate the
clinical approach and stress the clinical relevance to the neurosciences.
Most importantly, the explanations for the cases emphasize the mechanisms
and structure–function principles, rather than merely rote questions and
answers. This book is organized for versatility to allow the student “in a rush”
to go quickly through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers or to
consider the thought-provoking explanations. The answers are arranged from
simple to complex: the bare answers, a clinical correlation of the case, an
approach to the pertinent topic including objectives and definitions, a comprehension test at the end, neuroscience pearls for emphasis, and a list of references for further reading. A listing of cases is included in Section III to aid the
student who desires to test his/her knowledge of a certain area or to review a
topic including basic definitions. We intentionally used open-ended questions
in the case scenarios to encourage the student to think through relations and
mechanisms.

APPROACH TO LEARNING NEUROSCIENCES

3

THE BIG PICTURE
Neuroscience is unique in that it incorporates an understanding of science on
multiple levels, from a molecular understanding of events such as with receptors, at the synaptic level, to a global understanding of the sensory/motor tracts
and their spatial interactions. It is by understanding all these concepts that a
student can better grasp the clinical presentations of neurological disorders
and the theory behind treatment options. The student should thus approach
each neuroscience topic from both aspects if applicable. For example, when
studying multiple sclerosis (MS), the student should understand that on the
molecular level this disease involves destruction of oligodendrocytes which
are responsible for creating and maintaining myelin sheaths around axons of
the central nervous system. The student should then review the nodes of
Ranvier and concepts pertaining to saltatory conduction. Next, the student
should take a step back and look at the condition from a neuroanatomic perspective. For example, if the patient with MS presents with left impaired
adduction on right gaze, but has normal convergence, and normal left abduction on left gaze, not only should the student be able to diagnose the patient
with a left intranuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO), but should also understand
that the lesion is in the left medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) and then
proceed to review the anatomy of the MLF tract (ie, that the left MLF yokes
the left cranial nucleus VI to the right cranial nucleus III). The student should
strive for an understanding such that symptoms should make sense rather than
rely on blind memorization!

KNOW THE TRACTS
There is no way to avoid it; the student has to memorize the various neural
tracts (ie, spinothalamic tract, corticospinal tract, etc.) forward and backward.
It is easier to first take each tract separately and memorize the exact pathway
the neurons in that tract travel throughout the body, noting any decussations or
synapses so that the student can determine whether lesions would have ipsilateral (same side as the lesion) or contralateral (opposite side of the lesion)
symptoms, or which nuclei are involved. The second step would be to synthesize this information by taking various cross-sections of the nervous system
(from the spinal cord to the brain) and being able to identify where each tract
is, reviewing at the same time where that tract is coming from upstream and
going to downstream. It is important to note that the terms upstream and downstream may be different spatially, depending on the tract referred to. For example,
upstream means a cross-section above the one being studied when referring to
the corticospinal tract since the tract travels caudally. However, upstream
means a cross-section below the one being studied when referring to the
spinothalamic tract since this tract travels cranially (from the peripheral inputs
to the cortex). The third step involves knowing the cross-sections so thoroughly that the student can draw any cross-section, incorporating all the tracts

4

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

and nuclei involved in that cross-section. Throughout the studying process, the
students should be asking themselves, if there is a lesion in this structure or at
this level, what symptoms will be manifested?

UNDERSTAND THE TERMINOLOGY
Although it takes less effort to memorize medical terminology without understanding the origin of the term, it is much more effective in the long term to
understand the reason behind the name of a structure or pathological condition. Going back to our example of MS, the scleroses refers to the plaques or
lesions in the white matter, while the term multiple refers to variety in location
and time. In other words, in order to diagnose MS, a patient must have at least
two anatomically separate lesions occurring at two distinct time periods.
Similarly, the student should not just simply memorize structures like the previously mentioned spinothalamic tract and corticospinal tracts. Rather, the
student should understand that the spinothalamic tract receives input at the
spinal cord level that travels to and synapses in thalamic nuclei. Likewise, the
corticospinal tract sends information originating from cells in motor cortex to
the spinal cord, which eventually coordinates muscular movement via the
lower motor neurons.

NEUROSCIENCE PEARLS

❖
❖
❖

The student should seek to understand the neuroscience on a molecular level, synaptic level, and a higher level such as sensory/motor
tract level.
An understanding of the neural tracts should allow synthesis and
drawing the cross-sections from brain to spinal cord.
The student should strive to understand medical terminology rather
than blindly memorizing.

CASE 1

A 53-year-old male presents to the emergency department following a newonset generalized seizure. After recovery from the seizure period, he is alert
and oriented to person, place, and time, although he has no specific memory
of the seizure. There are no neurological deficits noted on physical examination and laboratory values are unremarkable. The patient undergoes surgery
for resection of the malignancy and is diagnosed with a malignant primary
brain tumor, which is read as a glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The neurosurgeon’s plan is to place the patient on long-term seizure prophylaxis and
steroids, and radiation treatment to the operative bed.

ANSWERS TO CASE 1: CELL TYPES OF THE
NERVOUS SYSTEM
Summary: 53-year-old male with new-onset seizure and a left parietal lobe
mass undergoes surgery to resect a primary brain tumor, diagnosed as a GBM.
He also receives adjuvant radiation treatment.

◆
◆
◆

Related tumors: Low-grade astrocytomas and anaplastic astrocytomas.
Imaging characteristics: A ring-enhancing lesion in the left parietal
lobe with surrounding edema and mass effect.
Neuropathological findings: GBMs exhibit marked hypercellularity,
nuclear pleomorphism, vascular proliferation, and pseudopalisading of
tumor cells around areas of necrosis.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
The clinical presentation of the patient in this case is very typical for GBM,
a severe and aggressive form of primary brain cancer. Astrocytomas encompass a group of primary brain tumors which, as the name implies, are
derived from astrocytes, a star-shaped glial cell with multiple supportive
roles that assist neurons in efficiently relaying messages through the neural
network (see discussion). The World Health Organization (WHO) grades
astrocytomas based upon pathological findings along a continuum from
grades I to IV with grades I and II consisting of low-grade astrocytomas,
grade III consisting of anaplastic astrocytomas, and finally grade IV consisting of GBMs. As tumor types progress according to the WHO classification, they begin to exhibit progressively more hypercellularity and
nuclear pleomorphism (a nonhomogeneous group of cells with nuclei of
various sizes and shapes). Proliferation of tumor cells around vascular
structures along white matter tracts occurs in either anaplastic astrocytomas or GBMs. Necrosis with pseudopalisading of tumor cells is only
found in GBMs. Treatment consists of surgery, radiation treatment, and/or
chemotherapy either individually or in combination. Despite the advances
in all three modalities of treatment, median survival for patients with astrocytomas has remained consistent (Table 1-1).
Oligodendrogliomas are another type of primary brain tumor which
arise from the oligodendrocytes, another form of glial cells which provide
myelin sheaths around the axons of neurons in the central nervous system.
These tumors generally affect adults in their fifth decade of life, present
with seizures, and have a characteristic appearance on both radiographs and
microscopic examination from calcifications in the tumor. Treatment consists of an appropriate surgical procedure followed by chemotherapy. The

chromosome 1 or the short arm of chromosome 19 has been shown to affect
the sensitivity of these tumors to chemotherapy. Oligodendrogliomas tend
to have a better prognosis with 10-year survival of 10%-30% reported in the
literature.
Additional tumors arising from cells of the nervous system include mixed
tumors with oligodendral and astrocytic components, schwannomas arising
from Schwann cells of the peripheral nervous system, and gangliogliomas
arising from both glial cells and neurons. This list is certainly not exhaustive,
but is representative of the breadth of pathology found in primary brain
tumors.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

DISCUSSION
The human nervous system can be divided into two main components: the
central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS)
(see Figure 1-1). The CNS is contained entirely within the meninges, a series
of three membranes which encapsulates the CNS, while the PNS is distributed
outside of the meninges. The meningeal layers consist of the dura mater, pia
mater, and the arachnoid layers.
There are two main types of cells within the nervous system: nerve cells
(neurons) and glial cells (glia). Glia, which far outnumber neurons, support
neurons and form the structural framework for the nervous system.
•

Oligodendrocytes, found only in the central nervous system, and
Schwann cells, found only in the peripheral nervous system, are two
types of glial cells that have similar functions. They produce myelin,
which insulate the axons of neurons for faster conduction of electrical
signals. One oligodendrocyte can provide myelin sheaths for multiple
axons, while one Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon.

Microglia, the phagocytes of the nervous system, mobilize following
insults to the CNS and remove debris following neuronal injury or
death. They arise from macrophages outside of the nervous system and
are physiologically unrelated to other glial cells.
Astrocytes, the most numerous type of glial cell, are star-shaped cells
that fill the interneuronal space in the CNS. They provide structural
support for the neurons in the CNS, insulate and separate neurons from
one another, and help to regulate the potassium ion concentration in the
extracellular space around neurons.
Tight junctions between the foot processes of astrocytes, along with
the endothelial membrane of the vessels, help to maintain the bloodbrain barrier, an almost impermeable lining of the brain’s capillaries
and venules that prevents certain toxic substances in the blood from
entering the brain.
Glial cells also assist with the migration of neurons during embryological development and direct the outgrowth of axons.

Neurons are the signaling unit within the nervous system and are the only cells
in the nervous system involved with the conduction of electrical impulses.
While there are a number of morphologically different types of neurons, they
all share the same cellular phenotype consisting of a cell body or soma, multiple dendrites, axon, and a presynaptic terminal.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

A 21-year-old college student is brought into the emergency room
complaining of the worst headache of his life. On examination he is
noted to have a stiff neck and photophobia. As the physician on duty,
you are concerned that this young man may have bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm. You perform a CT scan followed by a lumbar puncture
which returns bloody cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), confirming your suspicion. Neurosurgery is called and the patient is rushed to surgery.
From where was this bloody CSF obtained?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Epidural space
Intraparenchymally
Subarachnoid space
Subdural space

Answers
[1.1]

A. Astrocytes extend foot processes that, in adition to the endothelial
cells of the cerebral capillaries, are a critical component of the BBB.
The BBB is a very important structure that, as the name implies, restricts
access of molecules from the blood to the brain. This restriction is generally based on size and lipid solubility such that small, lipophilic molecules can cross, whereas larger, lipophobic molecules cannot. The BBB
also is active in preventing bacteria and viruses from entering the brain.
Oligodendrocytes are responsible for myelinating CNS axons, Schwann
cells for myelinating PNS axons, and microglia are the phagocytes of
the CNS.

[1.2]

D. Tumors arising from oligodendrocytes will contain myelin elements and be located in the CNS. In the analysis of tumors, it is important to remember that dysfunctional tumor cells arise from normal cells
and thus express the same markers as the cells from which they arise.
In this case, the tumor contains myelin elements, and thus most likely
arises from a cell that produces myelin: either an oligodendrocyte or a
Schwann cell. Because the question refers specifically to the CNS, the
correct answer is oligodendrocyte. The other cell types listed do not
produce myelin.

[1.3]

C. Because CSF flows in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater, bloody CSF represents blood from the
subarachnoid space. Bleeding into the CNS is an emergency situation
with a grave prognosis despite appropriate and timely management.
Epidural bleeds typically present acutely following trauma, and are
commonly associated with a laceration of the middle meningeal artery.
Subdural bleeds often present subacutely, several weeks following
minor head trauma especially in the elderly. Intraparenchymal bleeds
present in a variety of ways, depending on the size and location of the
bleeding in the brain parenchyma.

CASE 2

An otherwise healthy 54-year-old female comes to the physician’s office complaining of weakness initially involving her hands and progressing to her legs
over several months. She states that her hands feel stiff and clumsy and that
she has difficulty buttoning her clothes or using her keys. She has fallen several times in the past couple of weeks walking up and down her stairs at home.
Lately, both she and her husband have noticed that she will “stumble over
words” when she talks. She denies any funny sensations or numbness and has
no family history of neurological disease.
On physical examination she is alert, appropriate, and oriented to person,
place, and time. Her cranial nerves are intact except for some subtle fasciculations (involuntary muscle twitches) of her tongue. There is some mild weakness in strength testing of her right arm and leg with pronator drift. Muscle
stretch reflexes are brisk in upper extremities, but reduced in her right leg. She
also has difficulty with rapid alternating movements of her right arm. There are
no abnormal findings on sensory examination. The physician has a presumptive diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and explains that this
is an upper motor neuron disease.

ANSWERS TO CASE 2: THE NEURON
Summary: A 54-year-old female with progressive weakness of her arms and
legs with subtle speech difficulties is diagnosed with ALS.

◆

Part of nervous system affected: The central nervous system (CNS),
specifically motor neurons.

◆

Fasciculations: ALS is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease
affecting motor neurons, cells within the CNS that caused voluntary
muscle movement. The loss of signal communication to the muscles
because of the degeneration of these cells leads to muscle atrophy
which manifests itself in fasciculations.

◆

Pathology: Loss of motor neurons in the anterior horns of the spinal
cord and brainstem nuclei along with degeneration of the corticospinal
tracts in the spinal cord.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
ALS is a progressive degenerative disorder of the motor neurons of the spinal
cord and brainstem nuclei and corticospinal tracts. In its classical presentation,
patients in their sixth decade initially complain of difficulty with fine finger
movements and stiffness and weakness of the fingers and hands. The patients
can also experience cramps or fasciculations of the muscles in the upper
extremities. As time progresses, atrophic weakness involves both upper extremities and spasticity and hyperreflexia develops in the lower extremities. Even the
muscles of the neck, tongue, pharynx, and larynx become involved. Depending
on the extent of involvement of the various motor neurons, a mixed upper and
lower motor neuron disease becomes evident. There are no cognitive, sensory, or
autonomic disturbances in this disease. An electromyelogram (EMG) obtained
for confirmatory purposes reveal widespread fibrillations and fasciculations, evidence of active denervation and reinnervation of the muscles. Analysis of CSF
may reveal normal or slightly elevated protein levels. Unfortunately, the etiology
of ALS is unknown. As the disease reaches its ultimate conclusion, the patient is
left in a flaccid paralysis of all voluntary muscles with the exception of extraocular and sphincter muscles. Treatment is directed toward minimizing the disability. For instance, medications such as baclofen and diazepam can be used to
treat spasticity. The median survival from onset of symptoms is three to four
years, although individuals can live a normal life span if proper care is available.

Definitions
Cytoskeleton: The internal network of fibers that form the framework
inside a cell. In the neuron, the cytoskeleton consists of three types of
filaments: microtubules, neurofilaments, and microfilaments and determines the shape of the neuron, provides cell rigidity, and creates a mechanism for intracellular transport.
Soma: The cell body of the neuron, which contains all the organelles and
acts as the metabolic center of the cell.
Dendrites: Armlike extensions protruding from the cell membrane that
increase the surface area of the neuron and receive signals from other
neurons.
Axon: The main conducting unit for carrying electrical signals, action
potentials, to other cells. Action potentials are formed at the axon
hillock, the origin of the axon from the cell body, and are propagated
down the axon in a rapid, all-or-none transmission to the next cell.
Presynaptic terminal: This is the end of axon that forms a synapse or neurochemical cleft with the next cell (neural, muscular, etc). Signals are
transmitted across the synapse via the release of neurotransmitter into
the synaptic cleft that diffuse into the postsynaptic cell, chemically triggering a physiological response.

DISCUSSION
Morphological Features
Neurons, the basic functional components of the brain, are cells that act as the
main signaling units of the nervous system. The cytoskeleton of the neuron is
composed of three types of filaments, each constructed from different classes
of proteins. Together they form the cytoskeletal structure of the neurons that
determine the shape of the neuron, provide stiffness to the cell, and create a
mechanism for intracellular transport.
•

•

Microtubules, the largest of the filaments, are constructed from 13 different types of protofilaments in a circular array and serve to maintain
the neuron’s processes. The protofilaments are formed by two subunits,
alpha and beta tubulin, in an alternating pattern. Microtubules are also
involved in axoplasmic transport, or movement of various cell components along an axon such as mitochondria, lipids, synaptic vesicles,
proteins, and so on.
Neurofilaments or intermediate filaments are approximately 10 nm in
diameter and are more abundant than either microtubules or microfilaments. Neurofilaments are made from strands of proteins that pair into
a helical structure. The pairs of proteins then twist together to form
larger protofilaments. Four protofilaments combine to form the final
neurofilament. Neurofilaments can form cross-links with microtubules

18

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

•

to provide stiffness and shape to the cell. Within the context of
Alzheimer disease, neurofilaments are modified to form pathological
protein aggregates called neurofibrillary tangles.
Microfilaments are, as the name implies, the thinnest of the fiber types
at approximately 3-5 nm and are formed by the polymerization of the
protein actin to form a double helical structure. Microfilaments are
located at the periphery of the cell adjacent to the cytoplasm of the cell.
Together with multiple types of actin-binding proteins, they assist in
the dynamic functions of the cell.

There are four distinct morphological features in a typical neuron.
•

•

•

•

The cell body or soma acts as the metabolic center of the neuron and
contains the ultrastructural organelles, such as the nucleus (DNA storage and ribosome production), endoplasmic reticulum (protein synthesis), mitochondria (energy through ATP production), lysosomes (waste
disposal), and vesicles (packaging and transport) necessary to carry out
basic metabolic functions.
Multiple short dendrites branch out from the cell body in a treelike
fashion. The dendrites function mainly to increase the surface area of
the neurons and receive signals from other neurons.
A single axon arises from the cell body and serves as the main conducting unit for carrying electrical signals to other neurons and muscles. The electrical signals, called action potentials, are rapid,
all-or-none transmissions down the length of the axon. Action potentials are formed at the origin of the axon from the cell body called the
axon hillock. To facilitate transmission of the electrical signal, axons
can be wrapped in myelin sheaths produced by oligodendrocytes and
Schwann cells.
The presynaptic terminal at the end of the axon forms synapses with
the postsynaptic cell, that is, other neurons or muscles. When the
action potential reaches the presynaptic terminal, a cascade of events
occurs culminating in the release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. The neurotransmitters diffuse to the postsynaptic cell, which
in turn triggers certain physiological responses.

Ramon y Cajal, using silver staining techniques developed by Camillo Golgi,
first noticed that the shape of the neuron could be used for classification.
Based upon the number of axons and dendrites which originate from the cell
body, neurons can be classified into several broad groups.
•

Unipolar neurons are the simplest nerve cells and have a single
process emerging from the cell body. This process branches with one
branch functioning as the axon and the other branches functioning as
the dendrites. They are found throughout the central nervous system of
invertebrates and in the autonomic nervous system of vertebrates.

CLINICAL CASES

Bipolar neurons have two processes attached to an oval-shaped cell
body. One process functions as the dendrite and carries information from
the periphery of the organism. The other process functions as the axon
carrying information toward the central nervous system. Bipolar neurons
are found in the retina of the eye and the olfactory epithelium of the nose.
Pseudo-unipolar neurons are a variant of the bipolar neuron and have
a single process which emerges from the cell body. This single process
splits into two; one functions as the dendrite carrying information from
the periphery to the cell body and the other functions as the axon transmitting the information to the central nervous system. They are found
in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord and relay touch, pressure,
and pain sensations from the extremities to the spinal cord.
Multipolar neurons are the main neuron type in the mammalian central nervous system. These neurons have a single axon and multiple
dendrites emerging from the cell body. Multipolar neurons vary in
number, size, and length of processes depending on the number of
synaptic contacts they make with other neurons.

Functional Classification
Neurons can also be classified according to the function that they serve within
the nervous system.
•

•
•

Sensory or afferent neurons carry information from the body to the
central nervous system. Sensory information can include pain, pressure, touch, and joint position sense, among others.
Motor neurons carry commands from the brain and spinal cord to
muscles and glands in the periphery.
Interneurons are all other neurons which do not fit into the previous
two groups. Interneurons carry information within the nervous system
and synapse on neighboring or distant neurons.

All behaviors are mediated by a series of neurons that form signaling networks. For instance, mechanoreceptors carry information concerning joint
position through sensory neurons to the spinal cord. This information is transmitted through various interneurons in the spinal cord and brain to allow the
central nervous system to process and determine where an individual’s limb is
in relation to the body and space. Once a decision is made to move the extremity, a variety of interneurons transmits the information to motor neurons to
relay the final command to the muscles. In this role, interneurons, through a
variety of neurotransmitters, can act to either excite or inhibit other neurons.

Spinal Cord Neurons
Neurons within the spinal cord are organized into a somatosensory and motor neurons. Somatosensory neurons form an ascending tract of neurons that run up the

20

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

spinal cord transmitting information about touch, proprioception (balance and selfawareness), vibration, pain, and temperature. Motor neurons form a descending
tract of neurons that run down the spinal cord to control muscle function throughout the body. The cord itself is divided into several sections axially: the dorsal, lateral, and ventral horns. Somatosensory neurons from the body run into the dorsal
horn where they synapse onto interneurons in the lateral horn that transmit information via the ascending tracts to the brain, or in the case of a spinal reflex, directly
to motor neurons in the ventral horn. Motor neurons running out of the ventral
horn are similarly controlled by direct reflex signaling from a sensory neuron, or
by efferent (motor) neurons traveling down the descending tract from the brain.

to second-order sensory neurons in the spinal cord. In function they are
quite similar to bipolar neurons, in that they have one large dendrite and
one large axon, but these processes fuse prior to entering the cell body,
so there is in fact only one process leaving the soma.
[2.2]

C. The interaction between the cytoskeletal microtubules and carrier
molecules is responsible for fast axonal transport. Kinesin is responsible for anterograde (away from the cell body) transport and dynein
is responsible for retrograde (toward the cell body) transport. Recall
that almost all macromolecules and organelles found in the presynaptic terminal were originally synthesized in the cell body, but that the
axon is far too long to rely upon diffusion for the molecules to reach
the axon.

[2.3]

B. Dendrites are responsible for transmitting signals toward the cell
body. Axons are the second set of neural processes which transmit signals away from the cell body. The soma is responsible for housing virtually all of the biomolecular machinery of the cell, and the terminal
bouton houses the presynaptic neurotransmitter-releasing system.

CASE 3

A 39-year-old male on business in Japan was brought to the emergency department (ED) by paramedics with initial complaints of numbness and tingling
around the face and mouth. His symptoms progressed to include lightheadedness and nausea/vomiting which prompted the visit. He had just completed a
successful business venture and had celebrated the occasion with dinner at a
fine restaurant by feasting on some puffer fish, a Japanese delicacy. Upon his
arrival, he rapidly became unable to move and had severe respiratory distress.
Telemetry recordings demonstrated an irregular heartbeat. He was quickly
intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Unfortunately, he expired
shortly after his presentation. Autopsy confirmed a diagnosis of tetrodotoxin
(TTX) poisoning.

ANSWERS TO CASE 3: ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES OF
NERVES AND RESTING MEMBRANE POTENTIAL
Summary: A 39-year-old businessman presents to the ED with complaints of
numbness and tingling in his mouth which progresses to paralysis, respiratory
failure, and death.

◆

Mechanism: TTX binds to the fast voltage-gated sodium channel at a
site which is located in the extracellular pore opening of the ion
channel, known as site 1. This binding temporarily disables the function
of the ion channel, resulting in death by paralysis of muscles.

◆

Neural activity: TTX is a potent neurotoxin with no known antidote,
which blocks action potentials in nerves by binding to the pores of the
voltage-gated, fast sodium channels in nerve cell membranes.
Specifically, the action potential is inhibited during the rapid
depolarization phase.

◆

Treatment: There is no known antidote for TTX poisoning. Emptying
the patient’s stomach, ingesting activated charcoal to bind the toxin, and
supportive care with mechanical ventilation are the limits of current
medical care.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
TTX is a potent neurotoxin commonly found in some species of fish in the
order Tetradontiformes. TTX binds to the voltage-gated sodium channels in
nerves and prevents Na+ entrance into the cell. While it does not bind irreversibly to the channel, TTX has a very strong affinity for the channel and is
not easily removed. Symptoms may begin with numbness and paresthesias of
the face, mouth, and extremities and progress to lightheadedness or dizziness,
nausea/vomiting, paralysis, and respiratory distress. For up to 50% of individuals with tetrodotoxicity, death will generally occur within 24 hours of ingestion. Because of the potential dangers inherent in the ingestion of puffer fish
or fugu, specially trained and licensed chefs are required to purchase and prepare this Japanese delicacy.

CLINICAL CASES

Definitions
Electrochemical gradient: The gradient across a cell membrane created
by the differential concentrations of charged ions on either side of the
membrane, for example, the difference in concentrations of potassium
and sodium ions inside and outside of a neuron that when regulated by
their respective ion channels allow for signaling down an axon to occur.
Ion channels: Transmembrane proteins in the cell membrane which open
and close to allow for the passage of ions.
Gating: The process by which channels undergo conformational changes
to allow for the passage of ions.
Resting membrane potential: The potential created in a neuron at rest by
resting channels and sodium-potassium pumps.

DISCUSSION
The nervous system depends on two types of signaling mechanisms, electrical
and chemical, to propagate information throughout the nervous system. Rapid
changes in the electrical potential across the neuronal cell membrane generate
electrical signals that are transmitted down the length of the neuron. This system requires (1) an intact membrane to separate ions and maintain an electrochemical gradient and (2) ion channels to allow for the selective passage of
ions of specific charges to generate the electrical signal.
The cell membrane of the neuron is formed by a lipid bilayer and is generally impermeable to charged particles. The double layer of phospholipids is
hydrophobic. Charged ions are hydrophilic and as a result attract water molecules. This allows the neuronal cell membrane to separate charges across its
surface to maintain the electrochemical gradient. However, to create and utilize the energy stored in the electrochemical gradient, structures must exist to
allow for the passage of ions across this membrane. Ion channels, transmembrane spanning proteins, serve that specific function within the neuron. The
basic structure consists of transmembrane proteins with carbohydrate groups
attached to its surface and a central, pore-forming region to allow for the passage of ions. This pore-forming region spans the entirety of the membrane and
is generally made up of two or more subunits.
Ion channels must also be selective for specific charged particles. One method
by which channels select for specific ions is by size. Although the diameter of a
K+ ion is larger than the diameter of a Na+ ion, the Na+ ions demonstrate a stronger
electrostatic attraction for water molecules. Thus, in a solution the Na+ ion has a
larger shell of water than K+ ions. Channels can therefore select for K+ ions based
upon the size differential in a solution. Other types of channels are selective for
specific ions based upon the ion’s electrical affinity to charged portions of the
channel. The attraction between an ion and the channel must be sufficiently strong
enough to overcome the hydrostatic attraction of the ion. Once the shell of water
surrounding the ion is shed, the ion can diffuse through the channel.

26

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The flow of ions through a channel is passive and governed by the electrochemical gradient. Some ion channels are highly selective for a specific anion or
cation, while others are more indiscriminate. Ion channels also open and close
based upon the needs of the neuron. This change in state requires a conformational change of the proteins that form the channel, a process called gating.
To understand the electrical properties of the neuron, we must have an
understanding of the electrochemical gradient. Particular ions are distributed
unequally across the cell membrane. The [Na+] and [Cl−] are greater on the
outside of the cell, while [K+] and organic anions, such as charged amino acids
and proteins, are greater on the inside of the cell (Table 3-1). Only the organic
anions are incapable of passing across the cell membrane.
Because the cell membrane is essentially impermeable to charged particles,
ions must rely on specific channels and transporters to gain entry or exit from
the neuron. There are two general types of ion channels in the neuron, resting
and gated channels. Resting channels are normally open, as their name
implies, in the resting state of the neuron and is important for the establishment of the resting membrane potential. Gated channels are typically closed
in the resting state and open only in response to an external signal to allow for
the rapid electrical potential changes necessary for cell signaling.
Resting channels help to create the equilibrium potential, the point at which
there is no net flow of ions across the cell membrane. The equilibrium potential is created by the concentration gradient of a single ion across the cell membrane as calculated by the Nernst equation:
Vm = RT/FZ × ln [Ion]out/[Ion]in
where Vm is the membrane potential in volts, R is the gas constant (8.3143 joules/
mole degree), T is the absolute temperature, F is Faraday’s constant (96,487
coulombs/mole), Z is the ionic valence, and [Ion]out/[Ion]in is the concentration gradient for an ion across the cell membrane. Using potassium as an

example, the equilibrium potential represents the voltage at which the chemical gradient driving K+ ions out of the cell is exactly balanced by the electrical gradient keeping K+ ions inside the cell, resulting in no net movement of
K+ ions.
While the Nernst equation accounts for a single ion, the GoldmanHodgkin-Katz equation accounts for the major ions which contribute to the
resting membrane potential and each ion’s permeability coefficient, the ease
with which the ions pass across the cell membrane:
Vm = RT/F × ln (pK[K+]out + pNa[Na+]out + pCl[Cl−]out)/(pK[K+]in
+ pNa[Na+]in + pCl[Cl−]in)
where the permeability coefficient for a specific ion is represented by pK,
pNa, and pCl. If we are to take a hypothetical cell membrane with only resting potassium channels open, we would find that K+ ions leave the cell
because of its concentration gradient. However, the resulting net negative
charge inside the cell (from the remaining organic anions) would limit the K+
ions efflux by balancing the concentration gradient with the increasingly negative electrical gradient inside the cell. Adding Na+ channels into the equation, Na+ ions enter the cell down its concentration gradient, but also down its
electrical gradient. This continues until the system reaches equilibrium with
a balance of concentration and electrical gradients for Na+ and K+ ions until
there is no net movement of ions across the membrane. It is this steady state
that creates the resting membrane potential for neurons, −65 mV. Because the
permeability of K+ ions is greater than Na+ ions, the resting membrane potential is closer to the equilibrium potential of K+ than it is to Na+. Since the resting membrane potential for Cl− ions is similar to the resting membrane
potential for the neuron as a whole, Cl− ions do not contribute much to the
overall membrane potential.
If resting channels were unopposed, the resting membrane potential would
continue to decrease. Thus, there must be some mechanism to offset the continuous, slow leakage of Na+ and K+ ions across the membrane. The −65-mV
resting membrane potential is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump
(Na+/K+ pump), a large membrane-spanning protein with binding sites for Na+,
K+, and ATP (see Figure 3-1). The intracellular portion of the pump has binding sites for three Na+ ions. The extracellular portion contains two binding
sites for K+ ions along with a portion for ATPase activity. As one molecule of
ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and inorganic phosphate, the resulting energy is
used to move Na+ and K+ against their net electrochemical gradients. It is this
unequal movement of ions which maintains the negative resting membrane
potential of the neuron. But at rest, the concentration of Na+, K+, and Cl− ions
inside and outside of the cell are balanced and constant owing to the previously mentioned forces.
Signaling through the nervous system requires large changes in electrical
potential to propagate signals through and between neurons. These electrical

potentials are created by substantial changes in permeability to Na+, K+, and
Cl− ions. The large changes in electrical potential, however, are created by only
a very small net movement of ions. During an action potential, there is very little change in the concentration gradients of the ions.

Answers

C. Decreasing extracellular potassium ion concentration as in this case,
will result in hyperpolarization of the nerve. Because potassium is the
major intracellular cation in nerves, major alterations in the body’s store of
potassium can have a significant effect on the resting membrane potential
of the nerve and thus its ability to propagate electrical signals. From the
Nernst equation, we can easily see that decreasing the extracellular potassium ion concentration will result in a larger negative value for the resting
membrane potential for potassium. The nerve is said to be hyperpolarized
or more negative, thus making it more difficult for the nerve to depolarize
to propagate an electrical signal. Likewise, elevated potassium levels or
hyperkalemia affect the resting membrane potential of the neuron in the
opposite manner, resulting in a depolarization of the membrane potential.

[3.2]

B. The negative resting membrane potential of sensory neurons is maintained by the relative concentrations of ions across the membrane, as well
as the permeability of the membrane to these ions. The high relative intracellular concentration of K+ coupled with the membrane’s relatively high
resting permeability to K+ results in a negative Vm. The high relative
extracellular concentration of Na+ and the membrane permeability to Na+
actually result in a positive Vm. However, since the permeability of the
membrane to Na+ is considerably less than that of K+ (roughly 100 times
less), the primary driving force of the membrane potential is K+.

30

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

[3.3]

A. The Na+/K+ ATPase pump maintains the resting potential. Because the
neuronal membrane is permeable to both sodium and potassium, the ions
slowly diffuse down their electrochemical gradients at rest, and without
compensatory mechanism the membrane potential would eventually
reach zero. However, there is a mechanism that counteracts this diffusion:
the Na+/K+ ATPase, which transport Na+ out of cells and K+ into cells,
against their concentration gradients. This pump is driven by ATP, and
therefore no longer functions after the cellular metabolism has ceased, as
occurs following death. The NKCC (Na+, K+, Cl− cotransporter) is an iontransporting ATPase involved in renal function, the Ca2+ ATPase is a
membrane ATPase important in muscle cells, and the Na+/glucose symporter allows absorption of glucose in the intestines. These transporters
are not important in neuronal membrane electrochemistry.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4: THE MYELIN SHEATH
AND ACTION POTENTIALS
Summary: A 37-year-old male with bouts of various waxing and waning neurological deficits is diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

◆
◆

◆

White matter characteristics: White matter within the brain consists
of myelinated axons that connect various gray matter areas where
neuron cell bodies are located to each other by carrying nerve impulses
between neurons.
Mechanism of weakness: MS causes the gradual deterioration of the
protective myelin sheaths around axons (demyelination) that facilitate
signal conduction. Without myelin, the neurons cease to effectively
conduct their electrical signals, resulting in a myriad of clinical
symptoms (some presented above). MS is categorized as an
autoimmune disease where lymphocytes attack the myelin surrounding
axons as if it were a foreign agent.
Treatment options: Beta interferon can help to reduce the number of
exacerbations. High-dose intravenous corticosteroids or intravenous
immunoglobulin can be administered to reduce the severity and duration
of active attacks. Several other medications have been approved by the
Food and Drug Administration to treat symptoms of MS.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
MS is a demyelinating disease affecting only the white matter of the cerebrum, brain stem, and the spinal cord. For an unknown reason, MS is more
common in northern latitudes with an incidence of 30–80 per 100,000 in
northern United States and Canada compared to 1 per 100,000 near the equator. MS is generally believed to be an autoimmune disease with the myelin
sheaths in the CNS coming under attack from the immune system. The
plaques start as an inflammatory response with monocyte and lymphocytic
perivascular cuffing, followed by the formation of glial scars. Imaging and
pathological studies demonstrate white matter plaques of various ages distributed throughout the CNS. The typical course of MS is of exacerbations
and remissions over time. The most common symptoms include visual disturbances, spastic paraparesis, and bladder dysfunction. Intranuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) is a visual disturbance commonly associated with MS
that results from a lesion in the midbrain affecting the medial longitudinal
fasciculus (MLF). This lesion prevents the oculomotor nuclei and the
abducens nuclei from coordinating their movements through the MLF. With
lateral gaze, the contralateral medial rectus fails to adduct the eye, while the
ipsilateral lateral rectus abducts the eye. The dyscoordinated movements of
the eye result in diplopia. MRI scans are the preferred imaging modality

for diagnosis of this disease. Approximately 80% of individuals with a clinical diagnosis of MS will exhibit white matter abnormalities on MRI scans.
Analysis of the CSF from a lumbar puncture generally demonstrates normal
opening pressures and increased CSF protein levels. CSF-IgG is increased
relative to other CSF proteins in approximately 90% of patients with definite
MS. Gel electrophoresis of the CSF reveals oligoclonal bands. Diagnosis
relies on a combination of patient history and physical examination supported
by imaging and CSF study results. While there is no cure for MS, there are
several treatment strategies available to slow the progression of the disease,
reduce the frequency of attacks, and to shorten the duration of attacks.

APPROACH TO THE MYELIN SHEATH
AND ACTION POTENTIALS
Objectives
1.
2.
3.

Describe what constitutes the myelin sheath and understand its role.
Describe how the action potential is propagated through the axon.
Describe the variables that affect the conduction velocity of the axon.

Definitions
Nodes of Ranvier: The region of the axon between consecutive myelin
sheaths with high concentrations of ion channels which allow for current
flow.
Saltatory conduction: A type of rapid conduction of an electrical potential
at the nodes of Ranvier skipping myelinated segments along the axon.
Because the cytoplasm of the axon is electrically conductive, and
because the myelin inhibits charge leakage through the membrane,
depolarization at one node of Ranvier is sufficient to elevate the voltage
at a neighboring node to the threshold for action potential initiation
allowing action potentials to hop along an axon instead of propagating
in waves.
Threshold: An irreversible point at which the initial depolarization of the
membrane results in the rapid opening of all of the voltage-gated ion
channels, usually action threshold potentials are around −45 mV.
Axon hillock: The region of the neuron between the cell body and the axon
which generates action potentials.
Refractory periods: The period of time in which it is either impossible or
difficult for additional stimuli to generate another action potential.

DISCUSSION
Myelin sheaths are produced by the oligodendrocytes in the central nervous
system and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system. It is important

34

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

to note, however, that not all axons are encased in myelin sheaths. Myelin consists
of lipids and membrane proteins which are wrapped in circumferential layers
around segments of axons. The intervals between adjacent myelin sheaths are
called the nodes of Ranvier and are important for conduction of the action
potential.
During the development of the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells
become closely associated with developing bundles of axons within the
nerve. A single Schwann cell provides a single segment of the myelin sheath
for the developing axon. As axons grow and elongate, the Schwann cells
divide by mitosis to ensure complete coverage of the selected axon. This is
in contrast to the central nervous system where oligodendrocytes extend
processes to multiple axons to provide myelin sheaths. One oligodendrocyte
can provide a segment of myelin for up to 60 different axons. Myelin sheaths
are laminated when examined by electron microscopy caused by the sequential wrapping of the myelin around the axon. During this wrapping process,
the cytoplasm of the Schwann cells and oligodendrocytes are squeezed out
of the developing myelin sheath. In the end, the layers of the cell membrane
are opposed and are secured in place by proteins, such as myelin basic protein, proteolipid protein, and protein zero, that are embedded in the lipid
membrane.
At the nodes of Ranvier, the myelin sheaths meet, but do not join. In this
region, the axon is exposed to the extracellular environment. The voltage gated
ion channels necessary for the saltatory conduction of the action potential are
concentrated in this region of the axon.
A typical action potential lasts for less than 1 ms, and is elicited in an allor-nothing fashion. Neurons code the intensity of a stimulus by the frequency, not the amplitude of action potentials. The action potential is crucial
for the passage of information via electrical impulses over long distances
and is generated by voltage-gated ion channels. These channels alter their
selective permeability to a specific ion based upon changes in the transmembrane potential. Specific voltage-gated channels include Na+, K+, and
Ca2+ channels. The action potential is a regenerative signal that does not lose
amplitude as it travels down the axon and rely on voltage-gated Na+ and K+
channels.
The tertiary structure of the voltage-gated ion channel is determined by
the transmembrane potential in the local environment. With changes to the
transmembrane potential, the channel either opens or closes to modulate the
flow of ions. These channels are typically open for a very short period of
time, 10 μs or less, and function as an “all-or-nothing” type response. At the
resting membrane potential of neurons, the voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels are generally in their closed configuration.
The action potential is generated at the axon hillock, the region
between the soma of the neuron and the axon, which contains a higher
number of voltage-gated Na+ channels than anywhere else in the neuron.
As the neuron receives signals from the dendrites and soma, they converge

35

CLINICAL CASES

at the axon hillock. As the stimulus is received, some of the voltage-gated
Na+ channels open resulting in the influx of positive Na+ ions into the cell
and a small depolarization of the axon hillock. If the stimulus is strong
enough, it will cause more and more of the voltage-gated Na+ channels to
open through positive feedback by the Na+ ions until a point is reached
where the depolarization becomes irreversible. This point is called the
threshold (Figure 4-1). The Na+ channels remain open for a brief period
of time before it is inactivated by a conformational change that results in
channel closing.
The depolarization also affects the voltage-gated K+ channels. However,
these channels open more slowly and for a longer period of time in response
to the initial depolarization and allow K+ ions to flow out of the cell. The
peak flow of K+ ions occurs as the sodium current is decreasing. This results
in repolarization. In the later stages of the action potential, the K+ efflux is

unopposed and drives the transmembrane potential past the resting potential
and closer to the equilibrium potential for K+ ions. As the voltage-gated K+
channels close, the resting channels allow for the reestablishment of the resting membrane potential.
Shortly after threshold is reached, there is a period of time where additional
stimuli will not result in any action potential. This is termed the absolute
refractory period and is owing to the already maximal opening of the Na+
channels. The Na+ channels begin to close even in the presence of continued
presence of the depolarization; the channels become inactivated and it takes
time for them to recover from the inactivation before they are able to open
again. Na+ is critical for the action potential: if the extracellular concentration
of Na+ decreased the amplitude of the action potential would decrease.
Following the peak of the action potential, additional supernormal stimuli may
result in the generation of another action potential. This period is the relative
refractory period. As the K+ channels close, the membrane slowly
approaches its resting membrane potential. Typically, repolarization of the cell
by closing K+ channels results in an overshoot of resting membrane potential,
creating a refractory period where the membrane potential equalizes to resting
state. During this period, the nerve can be restimulated to fire an action potential by a supernormal stimulus. A larger than normal depolarizing stimulus is
required to overcome the overshoot during repolarization by the voltage-gated
K+ channels.
For a neuron to signal other cells over distances, the action potential
must be propagated down the length of the axon. The initial depolarization
and resulting action potential occurs in only a small segment of the axon
creating a local current. This depolarizing current travels distally down the
axon and results in the next segment under threshold reaching threshold.
This segment then generates another action potential, ensuring that the
amplitude of the signal is not attenuated as it travels. The signal can only
travel in a unidirectional fashion because of the refractory period of the
channels.
The conduction velocity of the fastest axons in the human body transmits action potentials at a rate of 120 m/sec through large, myelinated
axons. Smaller, unmyelinated axons conduct action potentials at approximately 0.5 m/sec. In invertebrates, such as the well-studied squid giant
axon, conduction velocities are increased by increasing the diameter of the
axon up to 1 mm. This strategy decreases the resistance through the axon.
Mammals, which tend to have much smaller axons, employ myelin sheaths
to increase the membrane resistance of the axon resulting in faster conduction velocities.
Because of the myelin sheaths, voltage-gated channels are clustered at the
nodes of Ranvier and are the only points along a myelinated axon where currents can be generated. Furthermore, the myelin sheaths prevent any significant loss in amplitude of the action potential at the internodal segments, the
region of the axon covered by myelin. This allows the signal to jump quickly

from one node of Ranvier to another while skipping the internodal segments,
a process termed saltatory conduction (Figure 4-2). In unmyelinated axons, the
current spreads more slowly because of the decreased membrane resistance
and lack of saltatory conduction.
Although the two channel system examined in the Nobel Prize winning
work by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley in the squid giant axon is found in
almost every type of neuron, there are several other types of voltage-gated ion
channels. This diversity allows for a much more complex information processing system.

a larger than normal stimulus is applied. What is the molecular mechanism responsible for this phenomenon?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Opening of voltage-gated sodium channels
Opening of voltage-gated potassium channels
Slow closing of voltage-gated potassium channels
Slow closing of voltage-gated sodium channels

Answers
[4.1]

A. Lidocaine binds to inactivated sodium channels, preventing the
rapid depolarization needed for the initiation of the action potential.
The opening of the voltage-gated sodium channels is responsible for
the rapid upstroke of the action potential. Slower acting voltagesensitive potassium channels are responsible for the delayed rectifier
current, which, in combination with the closing of voltage-sensitive
sodium channels, are responsible for repolarizing the axon.

[4.2]

B. The time period referred to in the question is caused by inactivation of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and is known as the
absolute refractory period. During this time period, which immediately follows repolarization, the voltage-sensitive sodium channels

CLINICAL CASES

39

assume a configuration in which they will not open, regardless of
membrane potential. Undershoot hyperpolarization, the time following the action potential when the membrane is more negative than the
resting potential, is responsible for the relative refractory period.
During this time, an action potential can be elicited, but it requires a
larger stimulus as the membrane must be depolarized further to reach
threshold. Closing of voltage-sensitive sodium channels and opening
of voltage-sensitive potassium channels both contribute to neuronal
repolarization.
[4.3]

C. The question refers to the time period known as the relative refractory period, which is caused by the slow closing of voltage-gated
potassium channels. During this time period an action potential can be
triggered, but because the membrane is hyperpolarized, a larger stimulus is required to reach threshold. The reason that the membrane
becomes hyperpolarized following an action potential is because of the
slowness of response of the voltage-gated potassium channels. This
slowness of response results in the potassium channels staying open
longer than necessary to repolarize the membrane, resulting in a transient hyperpolarization or undershoot. As the potassium channels
close, the hyperpolarization resolves and the membrane returns to its
resting potential.

The nodes of Ranvier, the intervals between adjacent myelin sheaths,

Whereas Schwann cells only myelinate one axon, oligodendrocytes extend processes to myelinate multiple axons.
Action potentials are elicited in an all-or-nothing fashion. Intensity of
the stimulus is encoded in frequency, not amplitude of the action
potential.
Signals from the neuron’s dendrites and soma converge at the axon

channels to open through positive feedback by the Na+ ions until
depolarization becomes irreversible (threshold).
The absolute refractory period occurs when the Na+ channels, after
having been maximally open, assume an inactivated configuration in which they will no longer open, regardless of membrane
potential.
The relative refractory period occurs after the absolute refractory

ANSWERS TO CASE 5: NEURAL SYNAPSES
Summary: A 68-year-old male with a several-year history of progressive cognitive
decline is diagnosed with Alzheimer disease.

◆
◆

Biopsy findings: Amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are
clearly visible by microscopy. Amyloid plaques are hard, insoluble
plaques of protein fragments that form between neurons. Neurofibrillary
tangles consist of insoluble microtubules that accumulate because of
abnormal tau proteins.
Neurotransmitter: The oldest of the three major competing theories on
the cause of the disease is the “cholinergic hypothesis” which posits
that AD is caused by restricted biosynthesis of acetylcholine, so
acetylcholine would be the most deficient.
Treatments: There is no definitive treatment for AD. Antipsychotic
medications or benzodiazepines may be administered to help treat
certain behavioral disturbances common with AD.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Alzheimer disease is the most common degenerative disorder of the brain
accounting for 50% of all diagnosed dementias. It results in a relentlessly progressive cognitive decline. Initially, the individual exhibits forgetfulness with
day to day occurrences. Items may be frequently misplaced and appointments
may go unattended. Following the establishment of memory loss, further cognitive decline becomes more evident. The patient may develop a halting manner to his or her speech because of the failure of recall of certain words. As the
speech deficits increase, characteristics of expressive and/or receptive aphasias
become more pronounced. Other cognitive difficulties include dyscalculia,
disruption of visuospatial orientation, and ideational and ideomotor apraxias.
The patient may eventually develop difficulty with locomotion and may
become confined to the bedfast state. The incidence and prevalence of AD
increase comparably with age. The majority of patients are over the age of 60,
but AD has been diagnosed in some patients considerably younger. Certain
forms of AD have a familial occurrence, but account for less than 1 percent of
all cases. The most well-described familial trends follow an autosomal dominant inheritance. The early onset of AD has also been linked with Down syndrome. The most important aspect of the diagnosis of AD is the exclusion of
treatable forms of dementia. While, imaging of the brain may demonstrate diffuse atrophy with thinning of the cerebral gyri and enlargement of the sulci
and ventricles in the advanced stages, it is more important to identify mass
lesions, such as chronic subdural hematomas, which may account for the
symptoms. On histological specimens, AD is associated with the diffuse loss
of neurons in the cerebral cortex. In particular, neuronal loss in the nucleus

basalis of Meynert is associated with decreased levels of the neurotransmitter
acetylcholine. There are intracytoplasmic deposition of neurofibrillary tangles in neurons composed of paired, helical filaments, immunoreactive for tau
protein and neuritic plaques composed of paired, helical filaments of fibrillar
beta amyloid. In the amyloid hypothesis of AD, it was the deposition of fibrillar beta amyloid in the form of neuritic plaques which was believed to be the
main cause of the progressive cognitive dysfunction. However, the spatial and
temporal patterns of plaque formation did not correlate well with the level of
cognitive decline. Newer research into the pathophysiology of AD points to
the role of nonfibrillar amyloid beta peptide (A-β), the precursor of neuritic
plaques, accumulating in synapses. This has been termed the synaptic amyloid
beta hypothesis. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein, is embedded in
the membrane of the presynaptic terminal of the neuron. Cleavage of APP
results in the release of A-β into the synapse which acts as a synaptotoxin
impairing glutaminergic transmission and compromising synaptic function.
The elucidation of this new model of AD may point to the development of new
therapeutic treatments in the future.

Identify the parts of the neural synapse.
Describe the two types of neural synapses.
Know how synapses function.

Definitions
Synaptic bouton: The terminal end of an axon.
Synaptic cleft: The space between the synaptic bouton and the postsynaptic cell.
Electrical synapses: A type of synapse connected by gap junctions that
allows for the direct propagation of an electrical signal.
Chemical synapses: A type of synapse utilizing neurotransmitters from the
synaptic bouton which diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to
receptors on the postsynaptic cell.

DISCUSSION
Synapses are the means by which neurons communicate with one another. On
an average, a single neuron will receive approximately 1000 different synapses
to process. In its simplest form, a synapse consists of the synaptic bouton or
terminal, the terminal end of the axon; the synaptic cleft, the space between
the presynaptic and postsynaptic cell; and the postsynaptic terminal. The postsynaptic terminal can be the dendrite or soma of another neuron or even a muscle

44

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

fiber. The synaptic cleft is not simply an open space, but instead is spanned by
membrane proteins from both terminals which form connections to maintain
the distance between the two cells (Figure 5-1).
There are two types of synapses in the nervous system, electrical and
chemical synapses. An electrical synapse is only 3–4 nm wide and the signal
can travel bidirectionally, whereas the chemical synaptic cleft is much larger,
measuring approximately 20-40 nm, with the signal traveling more slowly and
in one direction, either to another neuron or muscle cell. The majority of
synapses in the brain are chemical.
In an electrical synapse, the pre- and postsynaptic cells are connected via
gap junctions that allow for communication of the cytoplasm of both cells,
accounting for the short distance between the two cells. This provides a lowresistance pathway for the direct flow of electrical potential from one cell to
the other. Action potentials that reach the presynaptic terminal directly depolarize the postsynaptic membrane. If the depolarization reaches the threshold
for the postsynaptic membrane, an action potential can be generated and propagated through that cell.

The transmission of the electrical signal occurs through specialized proteins which physically connect the two cells. Gap junctions consist of two sets
of hemichannels or connexons, one each on the pre- and postsynaptic cell
membranes. Connexons are in turn composed of six identical, membranespanning protein subunits called connexins. The connexins arrange in a radial
array with a central open channel. Proteins on the extracellular side of the connexins identify and link with proteins on the postsynaptic connexins to form
the complete conducting channel. Like voltage-gated ion channels, gap junctions can undergo conformational changes to either open or close the channel
depending upon the local milieu. These gap junctions allow for the nearly
instantaneous transmission of electrical signal. Because of the nature of the
synapse, the pre- and postsynaptic membranes lie in very close apposition to
one another.
Chemical synapses must convert an electrical signal, the action potential,
into a chemical signal, neurotransmitter release, which diffuse across the
synaptic cleft to affect the postsynaptic cell. The presynaptic terminal contains
large numbers of membrane-bound vesicles. These synaptic vesicles are lined
by specialized membrane proteins and are formed from the invagination of the
membrane of the synaptic terminal. The vesicles contain proteins and amino
acids manufactured from the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in the
soma and transported down the axon to the terminal via fast anterograde
axonal transport by the action of kinesin association to microtubules. These
neurotransmitters comprise the chemical messenger system of the nervous
system and are concentrated in vesicles clustered around a region of the presynaptic terminal called the active zone. These vesicles remain in reserve until
needed for secretion.
When an action potential reaches the terminal, it simply escapes through
the ion channels in the presynaptic cell. However, it causes a series of reactions
resulting in synaptic vesicles binding to the membrane of the presynaptic cell.
Depolarization opens Ca2+ channels, allowing Ca2+ to enter the axon terminal
and phosphorylate the vesicle-binding protein synapsin which frees the vesicle from the actin microfilaments, and binds to the active zone. Vesicle and
plasma membrane proteins undergo Ca2+-dependent association and the vesicle fuses to the plasma membrane and releases the NT by exocytosis into the
synaptic cleft. The vesicle membrane is recaptured from the synaptic terminal
plasma membrane to prevent enlargement of the nerve ending and provide a
constant supply of vesicles. The neurotransmitters then diffuse across the
synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
Based upon the type of neurotransmitter and receptor, the chemical synapse
can result in either an excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Excitatory
neurotransmitters result in a depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. Inhibitory
neurotransmitters hyperpolarize the postsynaptic cell. Proteins such as dynein
(which associates vesicle with microtubule) used for synaptic transmission are
targeted and returned to cell body to be recycled through a process called slow
retrograde axonal transport.

46

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Based on their structural and functional characteristics in the nervous system, neurotransmitter receptors can be classified into two broad categories:
metabotropic and inotropic receptors. Inotropic receptors form transmembrane ion channels that open and allow transcellular flow of ions upon the binding of a chemical messenger (ligand), as opposed to an electrical potential
changes as with voltage-gated ion channels or mechanical changes as with
stretch-activated ion channels. Metabotropic receptors, on the other hand, are
indirectly linked with ion channels rather than forming them. Upon binding of
a ligand, the metabotropic receptor leads to a cascade of intracellular signals
which then results in opening of the transmembrane ion channel. Because the
transmission of the signal from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell
relies on the diffusion of neurotransmitters, it is significantly slower than an
electrical synapse. However, unlike an electrical synapse, the chemical synapse
is capable of amplification of the initial signal. Many vesicles, each containing
thousands of neurotransmitters, release their contents into the synaptic cleft.
This process can lead to the activation of thousands of postsynaptic receptors
following binding of the neurotransmitter. Transmission is terminated in the
synapse by diffusion of the transmitter from the active zone by chemical degradation by enzymes in the synaptic cleft (ie, acetylcholinesterase), and reuptake
of the neurotransmitter into pre- and postsynaptic neurons.
The development of the neural synapse relies partially on several specialized synaptic laminin glycoproteins. Laminin 11, concentrated in the
synaptic cleft, acts as an inhibitor to Schwann cells in the neuromuscular
junction to prevent them from entering into the cleft. This allows the pre- and
postsynaptic cells to directly oppose one another and helps maintain the
long-term stability of synapses and allows for the rapid transmission of information across the synaptic cleft. Laminin-β-2 binds directly to calcium
channels, which are critical for the release of neurotransmitters in the presynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular synapse. This leads to clustering of
calcium channels and the recruitment of other presynaptic components to
form the active zone of the presynaptic membrane. Perturbations of either of
these synaptic laminin glycoproteins may lead to the pathogenesis of synaptic disease.

Answers
[5.1]

B. Acetylcholine receptors are located on the postsynaptic membrane.
There are a variety of different types of acetylcholine receptors, but those
affected in myasthenia gravis are inotropic and located on the postsynaptic membrane in the neuromuscular junction. In patients with myasthenia gravis, acetylcholine is released appropriately into the synaptic
cleft when stimulated, but the target for the neurotransmitter is reduced,
so muscle cells are insufficiently stimulated, resulting in weakness.

[5.2]

B. The portion of the presynaptic neuron containing synaptic vesicles
is called the active zone. The round structures in the question are
synaptic vesicles, as evidenced by the fact that they contain acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter. Presynaptic terminal and terminal bouton
are synonyms, and refer generally to the end of the axon from which
neurotransmission occurs, but neither is as specific for the location of
the synaptic vesicles as the active zone. The postsynaptic membrane
contains neurotransmitter receptors, but not synaptic vesicles.

[5.3]

C. On stimulation, synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and release their contents (neurotransmitters) into the synaptic
cleft, where they diffuse across and interact with receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. Neurotransmitters do not actually enter the postsynaptic cells; they interact with membrane proteins and cause their
effects through the receptors. Likewise, neurotransmitters are typically
not found in large quantities in the presynaptic neuron cytoplasm, they
are contained in the synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles do not fuse with
or release their contents into the Golgi complex; although, depending
on the type of neurotransmitter, it may originate there.

There are two types of synapses in the nervous system: electrical
synapses and chemical synapses.
Electrical synapses contain gap junctions which physically connect
adjacent neurons and allow for faster conduction of the signal.
Chemical synapses comprise the majority of synapses and convert
the electrical signal (the action potential) into a chemical signal
(the release of a neurotransmitter).
Presynaptic terminals contain larger numbers of preformed membranebound vesicles full of neurotransmitters, which are released via
calcium-dependent exocytosis once the action potential reaches
the terminal.
Inotropic receptors directly form an ion channel pore that allows
movement of ions once the receptor is activated.
Activation of metabotropic receptors (ie, via binding of a ligand)
leads to a cascade of intracellular signals that then results in
opening of an adjacent ion channel.

The loss of inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) on lower motor
neurons might account for the increased tone in the lower extremities.
In the absence of IPSPs, the lower motor neurons will only be
innervated by excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), making
muscle contraction more likely.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
It has been estimated that in the United States, there are 50,000 spinal column
injuries every year. The cervical spine is the most common location followed by
the thoracolumbar spine. The thoracolumbar spine is particularly susceptible to
injury because of its location at the transition zone from the rigid, kyphosis of the
thoracic spine to the mobile, lordosis of the lumbar spine. This region serves as a
fulcrum between the thoracic and lumbar spine and places it in a relatively neutral position, resulting in the application of maximal stress to this region during
any traumatic event. Up to half of all thoracolumbar spine fractures result in some
type of neurological injury. These can be divided into complete and incomplete
spinal cord injuries (SCIs). In a complete SCI, there is complete loss of all
motor, sensory, and autonomic function below the level of the injury. Incomplete
SCIs have preservation of some neurological function, however minimal it may
be. Initially, a complete thoracolumbar SCI presents as a flaccid paralysis with
loss of all sensation. As time progresses, the flaccid paralysis is replaced by the
characteristic upper motor neuron findings in the lower extremities because of
loss of the descending motor tracts. Lower motor neuron findings are generally
because of injury to the peripheral nerves (Table 6-1). The spastic weakness and
increased muscle stretch reflexes associated with upper motor neuron lesions
result from the loss of the descending motor tracts to the alpha motor neurons
in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. This leads to a condition known as hyperreflexia. The 1a axons, found in a muscle fiber’s muscle spindle, keep track of
how fast a muscle stretch changes. Additionally, they innervate interneurons
within the spinal cord which modulate the activity of the alpha motor neurons.
Some of these interneurons result in inhibitory synapses on the alpha motor neurons of antagonist muscles. Supraspinal tracts also synapse with interneurons to
help modulate the activity of the alpha motor neurons. With loss of the
supraspinal influences, the system becomes underdamped and the response to the
muscle stretch reflex is out of proportion to the stimulus. The alpha motor

Know how the length constant and the time constant affect postsynaptic potentials (PSPs).
Describe how a neuron integrates excitatory and inhibitory synapses to

Definitions
PSPs: Local potentials developed on the postsynaptic membrane following
binding of neurotransmitter to its specific receptor.
EPSPs: Potentials leading to the depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane.
IPSPs: Potentials leading to the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic
membrane.
Spatial summation: The total potential resulting from multiple, simultaneous PSPs.
Temporal summation: The total potential resulting from consecutive PSP
at one site.

DISCUSSION
Neurons in the central nervous system receive synapses from multiple other
neurons on their dendrites and soma, which form local currents that spread

52

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

throughout the neuron. These PSPs can be either excitatory or inhibitory,
depending on the type of neurotransmitter and receptor. Whether a synapse is
excitatory or inhibitory depends less on the type of neurotransmitter released
by the presynaptic terminal and more on the type of ligand-gated ion channel
that opens as a result of binding by the neurotransmitter. The PSP from all of
the various synapses travels to the axon hillock. If the sum of all of the excitatory and IPSP is sufficient to depolarize the voltage-gated ion channels to
threshold at the axon hillock, an action potential is generated and propagated
down the axon.
Glutamate is the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain
and spinal cord. There are two types of glutamate-gated channels,
inotropic glutamate receptors and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Once
opened, the glutamate-gated ion channels are permeable to both Na+ and
K+ ions. Since the electrochemical gradient for K+ is close to the resting
membrane potential (RMP), there is less flow of K+ ions through the channel. There is a significant difference in the electrochemical gradient for
Na+ and RMP, however, resulting in a larger Na+ conductance. As the ion
currents reach equilibrium, the membrane potential approaches 0 mV
resulting in an EPSP. When glutamate binds to the metabotropic receptors,
a second messenger system is activated in the neuron which indirectly
gates an ion channel.
The predominant inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system
are the amino acids glycine and gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA
receptors are more prevalent than glycine receptors. Binding to their respective receptors leads to the generation of an IPSP in the neuron.
A single neuron can receive upward of 10,000 different synapses.
Depending on the size and location of these synapses, they can have a strong
or weak influence on the neuron. The amplitude and shape of the PSP diminishes as the electrical distance from the synapse to the axon hillock increases.
The amount a PSP decreases as it spreads passively is determined by the
length constant of the neuron and can be determined mathematically by the
following formula:
λ = √[(d × Rm)/(4Ri)]
where λ is the length constant, d is the diameter of the neuron, Rm is the membrane resistance, and Ri is the internal resistance of the axon. The longer the
length constant, the less the signal diminishes as it travels through the neuron.
In a process called spatial summation, multiple PSP originating from different presynaptic neurons are summed to determine the cumulative effect on the
postsynaptic neuron.
Like the length constant, the time constant is an intrinsic property of a neuron. It is determined by the relationship of the capacitance and resistance of
the membrane and is determined by the following formula:
t = Rm × Cm

CLINICAL CASES

53

where t is the time constant, Rm is the membrane resistance, and Cm is the
membrane capacitance. The time constant helps determine the cumulative
effects of consecutive PSP from the same site on the postsynaptic neuron in a
process called temporal summation. Conduction velocity is proportional to
[1/Cm] × √[d/(4RmRi)] so that increasing the diameter or reducing the capacitance increases velocity of transmission. Myelin decreases the membrane
capacitance to increase velocity.
Whether a synapse is excitatory or inhibitory is related to its location.
Postsynaptic sites on the dendrites are often excitatory, while sites on the cell
body tend to be inhibitory. This localization is owing to the greater effect
inhibitory Cl− channels can have at the base of the dendrite and on the cell
body than on the distal dendrite. The open Cl− channels act as a sink for positive current flowing from the dendrites to the axon hillock via the cell body.
Presynaptic sites on the axon terminal often modulate the amount of neurotransmitter released by the presynaptic neuron.
As a neuron receives innervation from multiple presynaptic sites, the
EPSP and IPSP from these synapses travel through the neuron to the axon
hillock and are combined in a process termed neuronal integration. As we
learned previously, this region of the neuron has the highest concentration
of voltage-gated Na+ channels. If the cumulative effect of all of the signals
depolarizes the neuron to threshold, an action potential is generated. This
represents the most fundamental decision-making process of the central
nervous system.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
[6.1]

A patient comes to your office with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis
(MS), a disease that results in demyelination of central nervous system (CNS) neurons. Since the function of the myelin sheath is to
decrease the capacitance of the neuronal membrane (Cm), how
would you expect this demyelination to alter the time constant of the
neuron?
A. Increase the time constant
B. Decrease the time constant
C. No change in the time constant

[6.2]

In studying the response of a CNS neuron to various neurotransmitters,
you note that the application of neurotransmitter X to the area around
the soma virtually eliminates all action potentials generated by the neuron, no matter how much excitatory input is given to the neuron. X is
most likely which neurotransmitter?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Acetylcholine (ACh)
GABA
Glutamate
Glycine

54
[6.3]

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Still studying the response of a CNS neuron to various stimuli, you
note that when stimulated by a single excitatory input, there is no
action potential generated. However, when stimulated by three pulses
from the same excitatory input in rapid succession, an action potential
is generated. This is an example of what principle?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Spatial summation
Temporal summation
Excitatory neurotransmission
Inhibitory neurotransmission

Answers
[6.1]

A. Increasing the capacitance of a membrane increases its ability to
store charge, which increases its time constant and therefore
increases temporal summation. In vivo, however, the removal of
myelin does very little to affect temporal summation, because for the
most part dendrites are not myelinated. Demyelination primarily
affects axonal propagation in the CNS, where an increase in the time
constant results in slower action potential propagation, accounting for
the pathology of MS.

[6.2]

B. X is most likely to be GABA. Since the application of X around the
soma eliminates most action potentials, we can conclude that X
induces IPSPs in the neuron. Since this is a CNS neuron, the two most
common inhibitory neurotransmitters are GABA and glycine. GABA
is a more common inhibitory neurotransmitter than glycine, so it is
more likely that the neuron in question has GABA receptors than
glycine receptors. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter, so cannot account for the changes seen. ACh can have various postsynaptic
responses, depending on the specific receptor, but in the CNS, it primarily acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter.

[6.3]

B. The situation described is an example of temporal summation
of PSPs. The excitatory input is not strong enough to cause the
postsynaptic neuron to reach threshold, but if subsequent inputs
reach the axon hillock before the subthreshold depolarization has
decayed to the resting potential, they build on the prior partial
depolarization, further depolarizing the postsynaptic cell until
threshold is reached. Spatial summation is the combination of different inputs received simultaneously at different sites on the postsynaptic neuron. Excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission are
combined in special and temporal summation to result in the net
effect on the neuron.

CASE 7

A 53-year-old male presents to his family doctor complaining of tremors in his
hands that he first noticed about 1 year ago. Since then, the tremors have also
involved his legs. He complains of feeling stiffness throughout his body. As he
speaks, his expression does not change much and he does not blink very often.
He does not have any significant history of head trauma. He denies any recreational drug use or metal exposures. His only medications are a daily aspirin,
an antihypertensive medication, and a cholesterol-lowering drug.
On physical examination, he is alert and attentive. There is an obvious 3-4 Hz
resting tremor in his hands which disappears with movement. He has a slow
shuffling gait with minimal arm swing. He has cogwheel rigidity to passive
movement of his extremities. The muscle stretch reflexes are within normal
limits and there is no clonus.
After careful consideration, the patient is diagnosed with Parkinsonism, a
disease of dopaminergic transmission.

ANSWERS TO CASE 7: NEUROTRANSMITTER TYPES
Summary: A 53-year-old male with a resting tremor, shuffling gait, and cogwheel
rigidity to passive movement of his extremities is diagnosed with Parkinsonism.

◆
◆
◆

Class of neurotransmitter: DA belongs to the catecholamine class of
neurotransmitters.
Precursor of DA: DA is synthesized from the precursor L-dopa.
Degradation enzymes: DA is degraded by the enzymes catechol-Omethyl transferase (COMT) and monoamine oxidase (MAO).

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Parkinsonism is relatively common with approximately 1% of the population
greater than 65 years of age in North America afflicted by the disease. It may be
idiopathic or secondary to other known conditions, such as following viral epidemics, as in encephalitis lethargica or von Economo encephalitis; repeated head
trauma; drug use, such as antipsychotics, phenothiazines, or MPTP (1-methyl-4phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6-tetrahydropyridine); or poisonings, such as carbon monoxide or
manganese toxicities. The idiopathic form is known as Parkinson disease, while
the others are known as secondary Parkinsonism.
The classic triad of symptoms consists of the pill-rolling tremor of 3–5 Hz,
cogwheel rigidity, and bradykinesia. Other symptoms include masked facies,
postural instability, and a festinating shuffle. Diagnosis is based upon the history and clinical features. If in the early stages of the disease the diagnosis is
in question, repeated evaluations at a later stage are warranted. The most difficult aspect of the diagnosis is to distinguish the idiopathic form from the secondary form. A positive response to the administration of levodopa helps to
confirm the diagnosis. The most consistent finding on postmortem examination in both Parkinson disease and secondary Parkinsonism is the loss of pigmented cells in the substantia nigra and in other pigmented nuclei. This
corresponds to the loss of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia
nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and subsequent gliosis. Eosinophilic intraneuronal hyaline inclusions called Lewy bodies are found in the remaining cells
of the SNpc. The constellation of clinical findings is caused by the loss of DA
in the neostriatum, which includes the caudate nucleus, putamen, and globus
pallidus. The net result of the striatal pathway is the increased inhibition of the
thalamus by the globus pallidus interna (GPi), thus preventing the thalamus
from exciting regions of the supplementary motor cortex. Currently, there is no
known treatment to stop the progression of this disease. Medical management
is aimed at augmenting or replacing the effects of DA in the striatal pathway.
Medications include in levodopa-carbidopa, which replaces the loss of DA in
the central nervous system, and Selegiline, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor
which prevents the metabolic degradation of DA.

Know the characteristics of a neurotransmitter.

Know how and where neurotransmitters are produced.
Know how neurotransmitters are inactivated and cleared from the synapse.

Definitions
Acetylcholine: A small-molecule neurotransmitter synthesized from
choline and acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA).
Glutamate: The most common excitatory neurotransmitter in the central
nervous system.
Gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA): An inhibitory small-molecule neurotransmitter synthesized from glutamate.

Catecholamines: A group of small-molecule neurotransmitters consisting
of DA, norepinephrine (NE), and epinephrine (Epi) formed from the
metabolism of tyrosine.

DISCUSSION
Neurotransmitters are the means by which a neuron signals other neurons and
cells. Some are produced in the soma of the neuron by the free ribosomes and
the rough endoplasmic reticulum, packaged in vesicles, modified by the Golgi
apparatus, and transported down the axon to the presynaptic terminal. Other
neurotransmitters can be produced by enzymes in the cytoplasm and concentrated in synaptic vesicles. The vesicles are stored in the terminal and await the
signal for release into the synaptic cleft where the neurotransmitter can diffuse
across to the postsynaptic membrane, bind to receptors, and affect a change in
the cell. There are specific mechanisms in place to remove neurotransmitters
from the synaptic cleft.
In the nervous system, there are two main types of neurotransmitters, smallmolecule neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine (ACh), glutamate, and
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and neuroactive peptides, such as
enkephalin and substance P. We shall present some representatives of the smallmolecule neurotransmitters and neuroactive peptides in the following paragraphs.
Small-molecule transmitters are charged molecules that are derived from the
metabolism of carbohydrates. Most of these neurotransmitters are amino acids or
their derivatives. The precursors to the neurotransmitters are enzymatically altered
in the cytosol and concentrated into synaptic vesicles for storage. As in all biosynthetic pathways, there is generally one enzyme that regulates the production of the
neurotransmitter and functions as the rate-limiting step for its production.

60

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

ACh is the one small-molecule neurotransmitter that is not a derivative of
an amino acid. It is synthesized from choline, which is found in diet, and
acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA) by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase.
ACh is then packaged into vesicles via a transporter protein, which exchange
H+ ions for ACh. Once released into the synaptic cleft, Ach is hydrolyzed by
acetylcholinesterase into acetate and choline. ACh is found in the motor neurons of the spinal cord, where it is released at the neuromuscular junction, and
in all preganglionic terminals in the autonomic nervous system and in the postganglionic terminals of the parasympathetic nervous system. It is also found
widely in many synapses of the brain.
Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous
system and is synthesized from α-ketoglutarate, an intermediary of the tricarboxylic acid cycle. It binds to several different receptor types and acts on both
inotropic and metabotropic receptors. Glutamate is cleared from the synaptic
cleft by glial cells, which then convert it to glutamine by glutamine synthase.
Glutamine diffuses across the plasma membrane, is synthesized back into glutamate in the presynaptic terminal, and is then repackaged into vesicles.
GABA and glycine are important inhibitory neurotransmitters in the central nervous system. GABA is synthesized from glutamate by glutamic acid
decarboxylase with the help of cofactor pyridoxal phosphate. Glycine is likely
synthesized from serine and is the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the
spinal cord. Both neurotransmitters bind to receptors that lead to the opening
Cl− channels in the postsynaptic neuron. GABA activity in the synapse is terminated by reuptake into presynaptic nerve terminals and surrounding glial
cells. The energy needed to drive GABA reuptake is provided by the movement of Na+ down its concentration gradient. While GABA taken back into
nerve terminals is available for reutilization, GABA in glia is converted to glutamine which is then eventually used to reform GABA via a number of metabolic steps. Glycine activity in the synaptic cleft is terminated by reabsorption
into the presynaptic cleft via active transport.
Another group of small-molecule neurotransmitters are the catecholamines, consisting of DA, NE, and Epi. They are all synthesized from the
amino acid tyrosine from a common pathway. Tyrosine is first converted into
L-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-dopa) by tyrosine hydroxylase. This is the ratelimiting step for the production of both DA and NE. L-dopa is then decarboxylated to form DA, which is important in the nigrostriatal pathways in the
brain. DA can be converted to NE in the synaptic vesicle by dopamine hydroxylase. NE acts as an important neurotransmitter in the autonomic nervous system and is also found in large concentrations in brain in the locus ceruleus. NE
can be methylated by phenylethanolamine-N-transferase to form Epi in the
adrenal medulla.
The neuroactive peptides are produced by ribosomes on the endoplasmic
reticulum of the cell body and, following modifications, are transported down
the axon to the terminal. Several different peptides can be encoded by a single
mRNA. They are produced as a large precursor protein called polyproteins in

the membrane-limited organelles of the neuron. These larger proteins are
cleaved to form the neuroactive peptides, which are removed by both diffusion
and breakdown by extracellular proteases. Since polyproteins can encode different neurotransmitters, this processing of the polyprotein is crucial in determining which of the neuroactive peptides are ultimately released by the
neuron. Neuroactive peptides have long-lasting effects because they all work
through G protein–coupled receptors.
Neuroactive peptides differ from the small-molecule neurotransmitters in several ways. First, because they rely on protein synthesis and modification, neuroactive peptides can only be produced in the cell body. Small-molecule
neurotransmitters rely on enzymes found throughout the cytosol and are predominantly manufactured at the presynaptic terminal. They are also taken up and concentrated within the synaptic vesicles, unlike the neuroactive peptides which are
packaged into vesicles by the Golgi apparatus. Because of the different processing
steps, the type of synaptic vesicles also differs between the two classes. The vesicles for small-molecule neurotransmitters can be recycled quickly at the nerve terminal following exocytosis to produce more synaptic vesicles. The membrane that
constitutes the vesicles for neuroactive peptides come from the Golgi apparatus
and are transported from the cell body in a more time-consuming fashion.
Despite these differences, neuroactive peptides and small-molecule neurotransmitters often coexist within the same neuron. They can be released
together to function synergistically on the postsynaptic cell. Additionally, several different neuroactive peptides processed from a single polyprotein can be
released into the synaptic cleft.
Following release, the neurotransmitters must be removed from the synaptic cleft to prevent desensitization of the postsynaptic receptors and to allow
future transmissions to occur. As learned previously, enzymes in the synaptic
cleft degrade and inactivate certain neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine.
Neuroactive peptides are cleared more slowly from the synapse by simple diffusion. Most neurotransmitters, however, are taken up by the neuron to terminate their action. Transporter proteins in the neuron often rely on the
electrochemical gradient for the active reuptake of the neurotransmitter.

You are following a patient who has been previously diagnosed with

of the proposed pathologic mechanisms of this disease is a lack of
cholinergic neurotransmission in certain areas of the brain. Some treatments are therefore aimed at increasing cholinergic neurotransmission.
By which of the following mechanisms is a drug that increases acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft most likely to act?
A. Inhibition of diffusion out of the synaptic cleft
B. Inhibition of reuptake of acetylcholine into the neuron and
surrounding glia
C. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase-mediated degradation of acetylcholine
D. Increased synthesis and release of acetylcholine

Answers
[7.1]

A. The neurotransmitter implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson
disease is DA, the immediate precursor of which is L-dopa. In the
synthetic pathway leading to DA, tyrosine is converted to L-dopa by
tyrosine hydroxylase; L-dopa is then converted to DA by dopa decarboxylase. DA can be further processed by dopamine β-hydroxylase to
yield NE. Tryptophan is the first step in the synthetic pathway leading
to serotonin.

[7.2]

A. Substance P is a neurotransmitter that belongs to the neuroactive
peptide class and, like all peptides, is synthesized in the cell body on
the rough endoplasmic reticulum. After synthesis, these peptides are
further processed by the Golgi complex, which also packages them
into vesicles. These vesicles are transported down the axon via fast
anterograde axonal transport to the presynaptic terminal, where they
are secreted into the synaptic cleft when properly stimulated. Many of
the small-molecule neurotransmitters (ACh, DA, GABA, etc.) are synthesized in the cytoplasm of the presynaptic terminal and subsequently
packaged into secretory vesicles. DA is converted to NE inside the
synaptic vesicles. Neurotransmitters are degraded, not synthesized in
the synaptic cleft.

64

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

[7.3]

C. While all of the above are potentially mechanisms by which the
acetylcholine levels in the synaptic cleft could be increased, the most
likely candidate is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase-mediated degradation. The primary method of removal of acetylcholine from the cleft
is enzymatic degradation by acetylcholinesterase. Inhibition of this
enzyme, therefore, increases the level of ACh in the cleft. There are
numerous drugs that do just this, and they are in fact used for treatment
of Alzheimer as well as other disorders. Diffusion from the cleft is the
primary means of removal of neuropeptides, and reuptake is the primary
means of removal of amino acid neurotransmitters like GABA and
glycine. While increasing the synthesis and release of ACh would also
increase its concentration in the synaptic cleft, this is a considerably
more complicated process than inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, and
therefore a less prominent drug target.

A very distraught 22-year-old mother brings her 9-month-old baby boy to the

Ions involved in neurotransmitter release: Ca2+ ions are usually
required for the release of neurotransmitter.

◆
◆

Neurotransmitter at the neuromuscular junction: Acetylcholine.
Source of botulism toxin: Eating honey.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Infant botulism is a rare disease resulting from the ingestion of the bacteria
Clostridium botulinum in contaminated soil, home-canned goods, and honey.
Estimates place the incidence at approximately 250 cases per year in the
United States with more than half of all cases occurring in California. Most of
the cases involve infants between the ages of 6 weeks to 9 months. Symptoms,
including constipation, cranial nerve abnormalities, hypotonia, and respiratory
difficulties, classically appear 12-36 hours following ingestion of the contaminated food. Parents will complain that breast-feeding babies will have poor
suction and weak cries. The flaccid paralysis usually descends as the disease
progresses. In severe cases, the respiratory muscles may be affected.
Following ingestion of contaminated food or soil, the spores germinate and
colonize in the infant’s gastrointestinal tract. Once the bacteria are established,
they begin to produce the botulinum exotoxin which is absorbed throughout
the intestinal tract. The exotoxin makes its way to the presynaptic neurons of
the neuromuscular junction, where they bind irreversibly to the presynaptic
cholinergic receptors and enter the cell by endocytosis. Once inside the cell,
the toxin functions as a protease and cleaves integral membrane proteins of the
acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicles. This prevents fusion of the vesicles
to the presynaptic membrane and, ultimately, exocytosis of the neurotransmitter. The decreased levels of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction produce the weakness that is the hallmark of botulism poisoning.

synaptic vesicles.
Quantum: A term for the amount of neurotransmitters contained in one
synaptic vesicle.
Quantal synaptic potential: The postsynaptic potential generated by the
release of neurotransmitters from one synaptic vesicle.

DISCUSSION
Stated simply, the release of neurotransmitter at the neural synapse requires
the depolarization of the presynaptic terminal by the action potential. This in
turn leads to the binding of vesicles to the membrane at the active zone and
the release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft.
The voltage-gated Na+ and K+ channels in the presynaptic terminal depolarize the surrounding membrane in response to the action potential. In addition to
the Na+ and K+ channels, the presynaptic terminal has a large concentration of
voltage-gated Ca2+ channels clustered around the active zone of the presynaptic terminal. Although they are slower to open than voltage-gated Na+ and
K+ channels, their relative proximity to the site of neurotransmitter release
allows for rapid opening of the channels. It is the influx of Ca2+ (and not Na+ or
K+) as a result of membrane depolarization that is responsible for vesicle
release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft. The amount of neurotransmitter released is directly proportional to the influx of Ca2+ ions.
Experiments have shown that neurotransmitters are released in a discrete
package called a quantum. Each synaptic vesicle carries one quantum of neurotransmitter. A single quantum results in a fixed quantal synaptic potential
in the postsynaptic cell. The total postsynaptic potential is comprised of multiple quantal synaptic potentials. In the central nervous system, one action potential can result in the release of 1-10 synaptic vesicles. At the neuromuscular
junction, a single action potential can result in the release of up to 150 vesicles.
Furthermore, the release of neurotransmitters from the vesicles is an all-or-none
phenomenon. If the vesicle binds to the presynaptic membrane, the entire quantum of neurotransmitter is released.
The synaptic vesicles are found clustered in the active zone of the presynaptic terminal. Synaptic vesicles in the cytosol are anchored in place to cytoskeletal filaments by proteins called synapsins. These vesicles cannot release their
contents until they move adjacent to the presynaptic membrane. With influx of
Ca2+ ions, the synapsins are phosphorylated and freed from their anchors and
move toward the active zone. Membrane-bound proteins, Rab3A and Rab3B,
are thought to be important for the targeting of the vesicles to the target zone.
These proteins bind and hydrolyze GTP into GDP and inorganic phosphate.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

One hypothesis for vesicle docking relies on the interaction of a group of
integral SNARE proteins. Integral SNARE proteins in the vesicle bind to their
counterpart on the presynaptic membrane and hold the vesicle directly adjacent to the membrane. Neurotransmitter release relies on specialized transmembrane proteins which serve as fusion pore. These pores are likely
preassembled hemichannels and may resemble gap junction channels. As Ca2+
ions enter the terminal, the fusion pore opens and allows for the exocytosis of
neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft in a mechanism that is not completely
understood at this time. The membrane of the vesicle is incorporated into the
presynaptic membrane following release of the neurotransmitter.
Calcium ions must be cleared from the terminal to prevent the exhaustion
in supply of the synaptic vesicles. Cytosolic proteins rapidly bind and
sequester the Ca2+ ions and prevent further vesicle release. The Ca2+ ions are
also actively transported into storage cisterns in the terminal. Finally, Na+/Ca2+
exchange transporters use the concentration gradient of Na+ ions to pump Ca2+
out of the terminal and into the extracellular space.
In order to replenish the supply of vesicles, the vesicle membrane must be
recovered from the presynaptic membrane. The recovered vesicles are then
transported to the membrane-bound organelles in the presynaptic terminal and
readied for future synaptic vesicle formation. There are several methods
detailed for the retrieval of the synaptic membrane. The classical pathway
relies on endocytosis of the synaptic membrane by means of clathrin-coated
pits. Clathrin is a cytosolic protein which coats the invaginating membrane
and helps to form the new synaptic vesicle. In the kiss-and-run pathway, the
vesicle does not completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane. Once the
fusion pore opens, neurotransmitter can be released from the vesicle. As soon
as all of the neurotransmitter is released, the pore closes and the vesicle can be
recycled. Finally, in the bulk endocytosis pathway recovery of excess membrane occurs without the use of clathrin-coated pits.

B. Synaptic vesicles completely fuse with the presynaptic membrane,
releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are then recovered by endocytosis without clathrin-coated pits.
C. Synaptic vesicles approach the presynaptic membrane but do not
completely fuse with it. They open pores with the membrane,
releasing their contents into the synaptic cleft, and then separate
from the membrane intact.
D. Synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane, releasing
their contents into the synaptic cleft. The vesicle components are
not recovered, but rather new components are synthesized in the
soma and transported to the presynaptic terminal.

Answers
[8.1]

B. Because Eaton-Lambert is a disorder that stems from destruction of
the presynaptic calcium channels, it follows that those steps in neurotransmission that directly involve calcium channels, specifically
release of neurotransmitter in response to nerve terminal depolarization, would be disrupted. Recall that opening of voltage-gated calcium
channels results in calcium influx, which results in fusion of secretory
vesicles with the presynaptic membrane and release of neurotransmitter into the cleft. Action potentials depend on sodium and potassium
channels, so destruction of calcium channels will not prevent them. In
Eaton-Lambert syndrome, there is a deficient response of the postsynaptic cell, but this is not caused by a disruption in response to neurotransmitter, it is because there is insufficient neurotransmitter released.
The ability of the postsynaptic cell to respond remains intact; there is

70

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

simply nothing to respond to. Removal of neurotransmitter from the
synaptic cleft is unaffected by the loss of calcium channels.
[8.2]

D. Botulinum toxin binds to and inactivates the acetylcholine synaptic
vesicle docking complex, which normally facilitates the fusion of the
synaptic vesicles with the neuronal membrane allowing neurotransmitter release. This prevents fusion of the vesicle with the presynaptic
membrane and release into the synaptic cleft. The other steps listed in
the question are not inhibited by botulinum toxin. Packaging of norepinephrine into vesicles is inhibited by the drug reserpine.

Ca2+ (the influx of which is triggered by membrane depolarization)

The amount of neurotransmitter released is directly proportional to

Synaptic vesicles in the cytosol are anchored in place to cytoskeletal filaments by proteins called synapsins.

retrieved include: the classical pathway, the kiss-and-run pathway, and the bulk endocytosis pathway.
The classical pathway describes retrieval by endocytosis of the

The kiss-and-run pathway states that instead of the vesicle completely fusing with the presynaptic membrane, the vesicle’s
fusion pore opens, releasing the neurotransmitter, and then closes
so the vesicle can be recycled.
The bulk endocytosis pathway describes retrieval of excess membrane without the use of clathrin-coated pits.

CASE 9

A 65-year-old male presents to your office in the morning complaining of double vision and weakness with exertion. This has been ongoing for several
months. He states that he feels best first thing in the morning. As the day progresses, however, he becomes more fatigued and will occasionally experience
diplopia, or double vision. He has even felt too tired to make it through dinner.
On physical examination, his extraocular movements are intact and he currently denies any double vision. He appears to have a mild ptosis. Muscle
strength testing and muscle stretch reflexes are within normal limits. He has a
narrow-based gait with appropriate arm swing. You notice that he is speaking
progressively more softly and less clearly during the course of the examination. After some thought, you conclude that he has myasthenia gravis, a disorder of postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChR).

and metabotropic.
Receptors involved in this case: The inotropic receptors at the
neuromuscular junction.
Treatments: Anticholinesterase medications, thymectomy,
corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents, plasma exchange, and
intravenous immunoglobulin.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Myasthenia gravis (MG) is predominantly an autoimmune disorder affecting
the nicotinic AChR at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), although a rarer, heritable form has also been described. MG is characterized by a fluctuating weakness which may vary over several minutes or days. The most commonly
affected muscle groups include the levator palpebrae and the extraocular muscles, resulting in ptosis and diplopia. The muscles of mastication, facial expression, and speech can also be affected, resulting in dysphagia, expressionless
faces, and dysarthria. It can also affect limb, abdominal, and respiratory muscles to varying degrees. MG has a prevalence estimated at around 40-80 per
million of the population and an annual incidence of approximately 1 in
300,000 individuals. Tumors of the thymus gland are found in approximately
10%-15% of myasthenic patients, while fully 65% have evidence of lymphoid
hyperplasia in the medulla of the thymus. Other autoimmune disorders, such as
lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren syndrome, and polymyositis, have also been associated with MG. In the autoimmune form, antibodies to
the AChR are produced which interfere with synaptic transmission at the neuromuscular junction by several mechanisms. First, the antibodies act as a competitive antagonist of acetylcholine (ACh) at the NMJ. Second, there are fewer
AChR at the NMJ in myasthenic patients. The anti-AChR antibodies also form
cross-links with multiple AChR which results in the clustering of AChR, the
internalization of the receptors by endocytosis, and, ultimately, the degradation
of the AChR. Because of the reduced numbers of AChR and the competitive
antagonism of ACh, the endplate potentials are not sufficient to generate action
potentials in the muscle. This leads to the recruitment of fewer muscle fibers
and the loss of overall contractile power in the muscle.
The diagnosis of MG is facilitated by several ancillary studies, including
electromyography, a serum assay for anti-AChR antibodies, imaging of the
chest to rule out the presence of a thymoma and edrophonium, and neostigmine

CLINICAL CASES

tests which test motor strength before and after injection with either of the two
anticholinesterase medications. These two drugs decrease the clearance of ACh at
the NMJ and, in myasthenic patients, result in a marked improvement in strength
following administration. There are several possible treatments for MG. Longer
acting anticholinesterase drugs are often beneficial for patients afflicted with
purely ocular myasthenia. If an enlarged thymus gland is detected, a thymectomy
should be performed. Up to 80% of individuals younger than 55 years of age
without a thymoma and who have had poor response to anticholinesterase medications also receive some benefit from thymectomy. Corticosteroids and
immunosuppressive agents can also ameliorate the symptoms of MG.

DISCUSSION
Neurotransmitter receptors are generally located on the postsynaptic membrane and have two important functions: to recognize and bind specific neurotransmitters and to alter the membrane potential of the postsynaptic cell. A
single neurotransmitter can bind to several types of receptors, resulting in different effects at different synapses. There are two general classes of receptors:
the inotropic and metabotropic receptors. Inotropic receptors have one or
more binding sites for neurotransmitters which are directly coupled to iongated membrane channels. With binding of a specific neurotransmitter, the
channel opens to allow passage of specific ions and alters the membrane
potential. Metabotropic receptors are coupled to second messenger systems
within the postsynaptic cell which also gate ion channels, albeit indirectly.

74

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Inotropic receptors open with binding of the neurotransmitter and close
with dissociation. The open channel allows for the passage of ions through the
postsynaptic membrane and results in a brief, local postsynaptic potential
(PSP). Unlike the action potential, the amplitude of the PSP varies depending
on the amount of channels opened by the release of neurotransmitter.
One of the most prevalent neurotransmitter receptors is the ACh receptor. It
is found throughout the autonomic nervous system and at the NMJ. Two types
of AChR, nicotinic and muscarinic, have been identified. Nicotinic receptors
are found in the NMJ and the preganglionic endings of both the sympathetic
and parasympathetic nervous system. Muscarinic receptors are found in the
postganglionic endings of all parasympathetic endings and in select sympathetic endings.
The nicotinic receptor is made up of five subunits; two alpha subunits, one
beta, one gamma, and one delta subunit. The alpha subunits function as the
extracellular binding site for the ACh molecules. The subunits form a channel
which remains closed without ligand binding. The pore of the channel contains
a ring of negatively charged molecules which select for positively charged
ions. When two molecules of ACh bind to the alpha-subunits, the channel
undergoes a conformational change and opens, allowing the passage of Na+
and K+ ions. Sodium ions flow into the cell and K+ ions flow out when the
postsynaptic cell is at its resting membrane potential. This results in the depolarization of the postsynaptic cell. Certain GABA and glycine receptors also
gate ion channels, but are selective for anions.
Glutamate has two different inotropic receptors: non-NMDA receptors
which are permeable to Na+ and K+, and NMDA receptors which are permeable to K+, Na+, and Ca2+. NMDA receptors are normally blocked by an Mg2+
plug in the channel, and require both ligand binding of glutamate and depolarization to open. NMDA glutamate receptors are very important in longterm potentiation.
Metabotropic receptors gate ion channels through a different mechanism. The receptor is coupled to one of two second messenger systems, the
G protein–coupled receptors and the tyrosine kinase receptors. The G
protein–coupled receptor consists of a single subunit with seven transmembrane spanning regions. Binding of the neurotransmitter activates a GTPbinding protein which in turn activates one of several enzymes; adenylyl
cyclase in the cyclic AMP pathway, phospholipase C in the IP3-DAG pathway,
or phospholipase A2 in the arachidonic acid pathway. These enzymes trigger
the second messenger cascade which ultimately results in the gating of an ion
channel. Muscarinic AChR found in the CNS and autonomic parasympathetic
system and adrenergic receptors found in the CNS and peripheral autonomic
sympathetic system function through G protein–coupled systems.
Tyrosine kinase receptors consist of a single spanning protein, an extracellular receptor-binding domain and an intracellular protein kinase domain.
Binding of the neurotransmitter to the extracellular site results in the dimerization of two receptors which activate the intracellular kinases. The kinase

CLINICAL CASES

75

phosphorylates itself and other proteins on tyrosine residues. This leads to the
activation of a second messenger cascade, which can alter gene transcription
within the cell and can also modulate the activity of ion channels. These types
of receptors are typically activated by neuropeptides and hormones.
There are several key functional differences between inotropic and
metabotropic receptors. The action and duration of inotropic receptors are
immediate, binding of a neurotransmitter results in the rapid opening of ion
channels. The dissociation of the neurotransmitter closes the ion channel in a
process that spans milliseconds. Metabotropic receptors act in a more delayed
fashion because of their reliance on a series of reactions. The opening of the
ion channel may take tens of milliseconds to seconds to occur and the duration
may last from seconds to minutes.
Inotropic channels function to create either excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in a well-localized area, the postsynaptic membrane. These
potentials, when summed, can create or inhibit an action potential through its
effect on neighboring voltage-gated ion channels. Metabotropic receptors are
also excitatory or inhibitory, but work through freely diffusible second messenger systems which can interact with channels anywhere on the postsynaptic cell. The second messenger cascade can influence the activity of resting
membrane channels, voltage-gated ion channels, or ligand-gated channels.
Metabotropic receptors, unlike inotropic receptors, can not only open channels, but they can close them as well.

C. Norepinephrine β-receptors activate adenylate cyclase via G proteins. Norepinephrine acts in the CNS and the PNS through activation
of receptors that are G protein linked. There are a number of different
receptors utilized by this neurotransmitter, and they fall into two
broad categories, alpha and beta. α-Receptors in general are excitatory and are linked via the Gq second messenger to phospholipase C.
β-Receptors tend to be inhibitory (although not always) and are linked
via Gs or Gi to adenylate cyclase. Both answers A and B refer to
inotropic receptors, which are involved in ACh neurotransmission and
with amino acid neurotransmitters like glutamate and glycine.
Phospholipase A2 is involved as a second messenger system in some
neuropeptide neurotransmitters.

[9.2]

D. The neuron described in this question appears to respond to neurotransmitter application via a voltage-gated ion channel. The effect of
the neurotransmitter is immediate and local, and there appears to be no
lasting effect on the neuron from its application. Any of the other
mechanisms listed are G protein–coupled responses, which would take
longer to have an effect, could potentially alter neuron physiology
throughout the neuron, and have the potential to have a lasting effect
on the neuron.

[9.3]

B. The application of ACh to the neuromuscular junction results in the
opening of ligand-gated sodium and potassium channels. The opening
of these channels alter the permeability of the membrane to ions such
that the membrane potential approaches zero, which is sufficiently
depolarized to result in the opening of voltage-gated sodium channels.
The opening of voltage-gated sodium channels triggers an action
potential, resulting in muscular contraction.

Further studies: MRI of the lumbar spine
Treatment: Conservative management versus surgical excision of the
herniated disk

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Only 1%-3% of low back pain, one of the most common ailments for which
patients seek medical treatment, is caused by lumbar disk herniations. The
intervertebral disk is composed of a central nucleus pulposus surrounded by a
fibrous annulus which acts to provide support to the spine and allow for stable
motion. With aging, the proteoglycans within the nucleus pulposus desiccate
and result in a loss of disk space height and become more susceptible to injury.
Tears in the annulus allow the nucleus pulposus to protrude or herniate out of
the disk space and impinge on the passing nerve root. Impingement of the nerve
root can result in symptoms such as pain radiating down an extremity, motor
weakness in the distribution of a nerve root, dermatomal sensory changes,
and/or decreased muscle stretch reflexes. The most common location for
lumbar disk herniations is L5-S1, with second most common being L4-5. The
L3-4 level is a less common site of pathology. The herniated disk will most
likely impinge on the nerve root from the lower lumbar level, that is, an L5-S1
disk herniation will affect the S1 nerve root. The clinician can use the straight
leg raising test or Lasegue’s sign to distinguish possible radicular pain from
pain secondary to hip pathology. In this maneuver, the patient is supine and the
clinician raises each leg independently while keeping the knee extended. Pain
from a herniated disk will generally be reproduced before the leg is raised more
than 60 degrees. The FABER test stresses the hip joint and does not elicit radicular pain. The initial treatment of an acute disk herniation and radiculopathy is
conservative management, since upward of 85% of patients will improve on
their own within 5-8 weeks. If the patient develops a cauda equina syndrome
(CES) or a progressive motor deficit, then emergent surgery should be considered. A cauda equina syndrome may develop from a very large midline disk
herniation, most commonly at the L4-5 levels. The patient may experience low
back pain or radicular pain. There can be significant motor weakness which can
progress to paraplegia if not treated. The most common sensory deficit is a saddle anesthesia involving the anus, lower genitalia, perineum, inner thighs, and
buttocks. Also, the patient may have difficulty with bladder and bowel control
to varying degrees. The surgical treatment of lumbar disk herniations consists
of removal of the offending disk material and decompression of the nerve root
through a posterior approach called a lumbar diskectomy.

Identify the components of the neuromuscular junction.
Describe the morphology of the endplate potential waveform.
Describe how the endplate potential is converted into an action
potential (AP).
Describe changes that occur with denervation of a muscle.

Definitions
Motor endplate: The region of the muscle fiber innervated by a motor nerve.
Endplate potential: The postsynaptic potential in the muscle fiber that
occurs following release of acetylcholine (ACh) from the nerve terminal.

DISCUSSION
The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is the interface between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber at a region called the motor endplate (see
Figure 10-1). The axon of the motor neuron loses its myelin sheath as it
approaches the muscle fiber and splits into multiple fine synaptic boutons.
The synaptic cleft is approximately 100 nm wide from the bouton to the surface of the muscle fiber which contains multiple deep invaginations called
junctional folds. The cleft contains the basement membrane composed of
collagen and extracellular matrix proteins which anchor acetylcholinesterases
to hydrolyze and inactivate the neurotransmitter ACh. The surface of the

82

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

postsynaptic membrane contains nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChR)
at the surface of the muscle fiber and voltage-gated Na+ channels deep within
the junctional folds.
As the AP travels to the bouton, the synaptic vesicles release ACh into the
synaptic cleft in a process described in the previous chapters. ACh rapidly
diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to the AChR. It is cleared from
the cleft by diffusion out of the synaptic cleft and hydrolysis by the acetylcholinesterases.
As previously discussed, the neurotransmitter binds to the inotropic receptors and rapidly depolarizes the membrane at the motor endplate, resulting in
a postsynaptic potential called the endplate potential. The amplitude of the
postsynaptic potential is greatest at the endplate and diminishes as it passively
spreads away because of the leakage of current along the muscle fiber. This is
in contrast to the AP which is capable of regeneration along its course.
Recordings of the endplate current demonstrate a rapid depolarization followed by a more gradual repolarization. This wavelike morphology is because of
several factors. Stimulation of a motor neuron releases large numbers of ACh
molecules which bind to and rapidly open more than 200,000 AChR. This results
in a rapid and large depolarization in the postsynaptic membrane. However, ACh
is rapidly cleared from the synaptic cleft and receptors and the channels begin to
close in a random manner, producing small decreases in the endplate potential in
a steplike fashion. But owing to the sheer number of channels involved, the steplike decrease in the magnitude of the current appears more smooth and gradual.
The depolarization that results from the stimulation of a single motor neuron is up to 70 mV at the neuromuscular junction. This is in contrast to the
postsynaptic potentials produced in the central nervous system which reach an
amplitude of approximately 1 mV. The motor endplate potential is usually sufficient to activate the voltage-gated Na+ channels in the junctional folds. The
endplate potential is converted into an AP and is propagated throughout the
muscle fiber, which results in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ ion concentration and the contraction of the muscle fiber.
Injury to a nerve supplying muscle fibers leads to denervation changes to
the muscle which occurs in several stages. The distal segment of the axon produces spontaneous injury potentials from hypopolarization of the nerve membrane. These injury potentials travel to and stimulate the muscle fiber resulting
in coordinated contractions called fasciculations which are visible to the eye
and are one of the earliest indications of denervation. As the distal segment of
the injured nerve continues to degenerate, the multiple terminals of the axon
are separated. They continue to produce injury potentials and isolated muscle
fiber contractions, but in an uncoordinated fashion. These fibrillations are not
visible to the eye, but can be detected by an electromyogram. Finally, following complete degeneration of the nerve, the muscle no longer receives any type
of potential and is electrically silent. Degeneration atrophy occurs resulting
in significant loss of bulk and tone. Denervated muscles will initially upregulate its AChR to serve as targets for the regenerating nerve. However, if reinnervation has not occurred in 2 years, the receptors are lost.

C. Atracurium (and all nondepolarizing skeletal muscle relaxants)
work by binding to AChR in the neuromuscular junction and preventing their activation by ACh, thus preventing AChR-mediated
depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. This results in total
flaccid paralysis, which can result in death secondary to paralysis of
the respiratory muscles unless mechanical ventilation is continued
until the patient has recovered from the effects of the drug. Calcium
influx into the presynaptic terminal is impaired in Eaton-Lambert
myasthenia, synaptic vesicle release is impaired in botulism, and
removal of ACh by acetylcholinesterase is blocked by a number of
therapeutic drugs and also by nerve agents such as sarin gas.

[10.2]

C. Acetylcholinesterase is the enzyme primarily responsible for the
degradation of ACh and its removal from the synaptic cleft. The

84

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

enzyme is located within the synaptic cleft. The defect in MG is a
paucity of AChR on the postsynaptic membrane, resulting in impaired
neurotransmission at the neuromuscular junction. By inhibiting
acetylcholinesterase within the synaptic cleft, the concentration of
ACh is increased, which increases the amount of neurotransmission.
This results in symptomatic improvement in a large number of cases.
[10.3]

C. The EPP only depolarizes in the area of AChR, so it decreases in
amplitude as it travels along the length of the cell membrane. The
motor EPP triggered by the release of ACh from the presynaptic motor
nerve is very similar to an AP but has some important differences.
Both potentials are the result of opening of both sodium and potassium
channels in the membrane, and both serve to depolarize the membrane
from its normal negative resting potential. The ion channels involved,
however, are different. The EPP arises from opening of ligand-gated
channels, while the AP arises from the opening of voltage-gated channels. An important consequence of this is that the AP is selfpropagating. The depolarization of the membrane causes the opening
of more voltage-gated channels, so it spreads rapidly throughout the
postsynaptic cell. The EPP only depolarizes in the area of AChR, so it
decreases farther away in the cell. In a normal cell, however, the depolarization from the EPP is sufficient to trigger an AP, which then propagates throughout the muscle cell, so both types of potential normally
occur following the depolarization of a motor nerve.

Injury to a nerve leads to distal segments of the axon producing
spontaneous injury potentials, manifested as fasciculations.
As the distal segment of the injured nerve continues to degenerate,
the multiple terminals of the axon separate and produce uncoordinated muscle fiber contractions. These are called fibrillations
and can only be detected by an electromyogram.
If reinnervation does not occur within 2 years, the postsynaptic
AChR are lost.

CASE 11

A 23-year-old graduate student brings her 20-month-old baby boy to the student health clinic. She is concerned that he doesn’t talk yet and still looks
“small” for his age with a head that looks “tiny.” She noticed that he was a lot
smaller than his peers in day care and has always been small since birth.
Despite his size, he has gotten into trouble for his hyperactive behavior. On
examination, the boy’s head measures 46 cm (5th percentile for age). Though
both she and her boyfriend are more than 6 ft tall, their son is less than the 10th
percentile in both height and weight. Examination of his face revealed small
eyes and thin, smooth lips. The results of her prenatal tests from her college
health clinic were normal. She notes that the pregnancy was unplanned and
occurred during her senior year of college. The patient’s constellation of
symptoms points to an early developmental insult, either from a genetic or
congenital factor. The physician elicits a maternal history of alcohol consumption during the pregnancy.

ANSWERS TO CASE 11: CNS DEVELOPMENT
Summary: This young mother gave birth to a baby boy who has many developmental issues that affect his appearance (morphology), size (growth), and
behavior (neurological development). She admitted to having “partied” too
much and binge drinking during her senior year, even resulting in a conviction
for intoxicated driving, but has since sought help and is now sober.
Examination of the toddler revealed poor motor dexterity and coordination for
his age as well as speech delay.

Cause of the patient’s symptoms: Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is a
likely diagnosis. CNS manifestations of alcohol exposure result in
structural deficits like small head circumference and facial
abnormalities. The neurological sequelae can cause difficulty with
motor and coordination tasks. The functional deficits can be the most
detrimental: developmental delay, mental retardation, hyperactive
behavior, problems with daily living, and poor reasoning and judgment.
Underlying mechanism: Dysmorphia occurs when normal
development of the organism is altered, resulting in features that are
altered in shape, size, or positioning. Alcohol is a known teratogen that
affects the development of the CNS, through the disruption of
biochemical signals, altered gene expression, and changes in cell
growth and survival. Despite the early developmental nature of the
insult, the CNS deficits generally persist throughout the lifespan.
Preventive measures: FAS is completely preventable—if a woman
abstains from drinking alcohol while pregnant or when she could
become pregnant. There is no level of alcohol that has been determined
to be safe.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
FAS is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in the United
States and is the most severe form of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders
(FASDs). Data from the U.S. Centers of Disease Control and Prevention show
FAS to have an incidence of 0.2–1.5 cases per 1000 live births. The scope of
alcohol usage is widespread: more than half of women of childbearing age
reported alcohol consumption in the past month. Most drank only occasionally, but 15% could be classified as moderate or heavy drinkers. Some 13% of
woman had consumed five or more drinks on one occasion (binge drinking) in
the last month. As nearly half of all US pregnancies are unintended, and millions of fertile women are sexually active without using adequate contraception, the risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy is significant, up to an
estimated 2% of women annually. Diagnosis of FAS requires the presence of
three hallmark characteristics: facial abnormalities, growth deficits, and CNS

CLINICAL CASES

87

abnormalities. The CNS abnormalities can be subdivided into structural, neurological, and functional domains. FASDs represent a continuum of symptoms
that range from the mildest functional perturbations to full-blown FAS, with
all of them linked by early maternal alcohol consumption.

APPROACH TO CNS DEVELOPMENT
Objectives

3.

Relate the various CNS developmental structures.
Know the sequence of events and temporal program.
Understand the tissue-specific signals involved.

Definitions
Ectoderm: The outermost of the three main embryonic germ cell layers
which gives rise to the tissues of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as skin. The endoderm, or innermost layer, generates the gut,
lungs, and liver. The mesoderm, or middle layer, develops into muscle,
the vascular system, and connective tissue.
Neural plate: The earliest structure formed in the CNS, which appears as
a shoe-shaped thickening of the ectoderm beginning around the third
week of development.
Neural groove: A length-wise invagination of the neural plate that occurs
soon after the plate is formed.
Neural tube: The lateral edges of the groove form the neural folds which
become elevated, approach the midline, and fuse together to form a tubelike
structure. This fusion first occurs in the cervical region and proceeds in both
cranial and caudal directions, finishing around the 27th day of gestation.
Forebrain (prosencephalon): The cranial end of the neural tube forms
three distinct dilations, with the forebrain being the most cranial. It later
forms the telencephalon which later develops into the cerebral hemispheres (most rostral) and the diencephalon, which includes the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and posterior pituitary.
Midbrain (mesencephalon): This is the second dilation of the neural tube.
Hindbrain (rhombencephalon): The third and most caudal of the initial
dilations and consists of two parts, the metencephalon which later forms
the pons and cerebellum, and the more caudal myelencephalon, which
becomes the medulla. The spinal cord develops later from the most caudal portion of the neural tube.
Notochord: A mesodermal structure that lies ventral to the neural tube and
induces the formation of ventral neural structures.
Differentiation: The process of progressive changes that a cell undergoes
to mature from a cell that has the ability to become multiple cell types
into a cell with a more restricted fate.

88

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Inducing factors: Inducing factors are signaling molecules that are provided
by other cells that can influence the differentiation of a particular cell.
Competence: The ability of a cell to respond to developmental signals like
inducing factors.

DISCUSSION
The central nervous system (CNS) forms through progressive rounds of differentiation which are orchestrated by a series of exposures to signals mediated by inducing factors. One of the earliest stages is the segregation of a
population of ectodermal cells which will become neural tissue from others
that will become epidermis. This differentiation of ectoderm is mediated by
exposure to inductive signals from underlying mesoderm that block the activity of a family of growth factors called bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs),
causing the ectoderm to form neural tissue. Examples of these protein signals
include: chordin, noggin, and follistatin. Cells that do not receive these signals
develop into epidermis, and can no longer form neural structures.
Once these cells become committed to become neural tissue, they coalesce to
form the neural plate (see Figure 11-1). Within the neural plate, further signaling
occurs that organizes the cell fates of these neural cells based upon their location
within the plate. Through the process of neurulation, the neural plate invaginates
to form the neural groove, which subsequently fuses into a complete neural tube.
The elevation of the lateral edges of the groove is the first sign of brain development. Two major axes become important for the specification of neural identity.
The medial-lateral axis in the flat neural plate develops into the dorsoventral axis
in the closed neural tube. The rostrocaudal axis running the length of the organism
determines the four major subdivisions within the CNS (from rostral to caudal):
forebrain, midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. The rostral two-thirds of the neural tube develop into the brain, while the caudal one-third develops into the spinal
cord. Failure of the cranial closure results in a condition called anencephaly.
The dorsoventral axis in the developing CNS relies upon further inductive factors produced by nonneural mesodermal cells. The notochord, a ventral midline
structure composed of mesoderm produces the inducing factor, sonic hedgehog,
which then signals the neurons in the ventral neural tube to form motor neurons
and ventral interneurons. In a complementary fashion, cells in the dorsal epidermal ectoderm produce several BMPs that pattern the dorsal neural tube to form
dorsal sensory interneurons. In a piece of developmental alchemy, the amount or
concentration of these inducing signals sets up gradients along the dorsoventral
axis which are critical in specifying the different cell types along the axis.
The rostrocaudal axis relies upon several layers of patterning and signals.
The original inductive signals that produce the neural plate, mediated by BMP
and its inhibitors chordin, noggin, and follistatin appear sufficient to specify the
rostral CNS and forebrain. The more posterior (caudal) portion of the neuraxis
utilizes the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) family of proteins and the steroidlike retinoic acid to pattern the midbrain, hindbrain, and spinal cord. There are

eight segments of the hindbrain called rhombomeres. Rhombomeres one
through five comprise the metencephalon, while rhombomeres six through
eight comprise the myelencephalon. HOX genes are expressed in rhombomeres
three through eight and are regulated by retinoic acid.
To better understand the finer patterning of the neuraxis, the organization
of the hindbrain serves as a model system. Within the hindbrain, discrete
swellings called rhombomeres occur in a distinct pattern. The rhombomeres
contain sensory and motor neurons that form the cranial nerves that leave the
CNS to innervate specific target tissues that develop from the branchial arches,
an evolutionary remnant from the gills of aquatic vertebrate ancestors. For
example, rhombomeres 4 and 5 contain the neurons/nuclei that give rise to the
facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) which go on to innervate the muscles of facial
expression that develop from the second branchial arch. The Hox family of
transcription factors demonstrates a very specific pattern of expression within
the hindbrain rhombomeres. This family of genes is clustered on the chromosomal DNA, with the genes in the 5⬘ end of the cluster preferentially expressed
in the more caudal portions of the neural tube. Conversely, the rostral rhombomeres contain the hox gene products from the 3⬘ end. Thus, each rhombomere is defined by a certain combination of Hox gene products. These
transcription factors delineate the identity of the neurons within each rhombomere—for example, Hoxb-1 is highly expressed in rhombomere 4 which
gives rise to facial neurons. Elimination of this gene results in the development
of trigeminal neurons instead of facial neurons in rhombomere 4. Other genes
influence the expression of the hox genes, like Krox-20, which are themselves
subject to other inducing factors. In this way, CNS development is built upon
layers of specific, regulated signaling between cells that orchestrate a symphony of gene activation and inhibition resulting in precise cell type identity.
This precise system is reiterated throughout embryonic development in
many organ systems and tissues. Because the nervous system is the most structurally and functionally complex organ system, it is also the most susceptible
to perturbation and damage. A number of internal (genetic mutations) and
external (teratogens) can upset the development of this system, with maternal
alcohol exposure being a prime example.

C. The cerebellum arises from the metencephalon. The cranial twothirds of the neural tube (which develops into the brain) is divided into
five dilations along its craino-caudal axis. From cranial to caudal they
are the telencephalon, which becomes the cerebral hemispheres; the
diencephalon which becomes the thalamus, hypothalamus, epithalamus, and subthalamus; the mesencephalon which becomes the midbrain; the metencephalon which becomes the pons and cerebellum;
and the myelencephalon, which becomes the medulla. The one-third
of the neural tube caudal to these dilatations becomes the spinal cord.

[11.2]

C. ALS is a disease that affects the motor neurons in the spinal cord
which arise from the ventral aspect of the caudal one-third of the
neural tube. Recall that the cranial two-thirds of the neural tube differentiate into the brain and brainstem, and the caudal one-third becomes
the spinal cord. Also recall that the dorsal aspect of the neural tube
becomes sensory neurons while the ventral aspect becomes motor
neurons. Therefore, motor neurons in the spinal cord (those controlling the hands and fingers) would have arisen from the ventral aspect
of the caudal one-third of the neural tube.

C. Retinoic acid is an important signaling molecule involved in the
cranio-caudal differentiation of the neural tube. A gradient of retinoic
acid is established, with higher concentrations at the cranial end of the

in birth defects and spontaneous abortions. Accutane is FDA pregnancy

CASE 12

A 32-year-old mother brings in her 5-day-old newborn boy for his first postnatal checkup. The pregnancy was uneventful—all the screening tests were
normal, he was born after a full-term gestation via vaginal delivery without
complication, and height, weight, and head circumference were of average
size. The mother remarked that her son has been increasingly difficult over the
last 2 days. He has been breast-feeding well, but has started to spit up more of
his feedings. She is also concerned about his lack of bowel movements. He
averages 10 wet diapers a day, but has only had one small watery soiled diaper since he left the hospital. Initial physical examination revealed a crying,
but normal-appearing infant with a moderately distended abdomen. Rectal
examination revealed an empty rectal vault and abnormal muscle tone. An
abdominal x-ray was obtained that demonstrated a distended colon up to the
transverse colon with gas and feces present. The diagnosis is determined to be
Hirschsprung disease, which results from the absence of parasympathetic ganglion neurons in the myenteric and submucosal plexus of the rectum and/or
distal colon. Without these neurons, the gut musculature remains tonically
contracted, unable to distend.

SYSTEM
Summary: A baby boy presents with a progressive history of constipation,
vomiting, and abdominal distention. Initial plain radiograph imaging confirms
large bowel obstruction with proximal dilation with gas/feces. Further radiographic images taken during a barium enema study confirm obstruction at the
mid-transverse colon. A diagnosis of congenital aganglionic megacolon or
Hirschsprung disease is made. A rectal biopsy is performed that demonstrates
a lack of ganglion neurons in the myenteric plexus and increased acetylcholinesterase staining—pathognomonic for Hirschsprung disease.

◆
◆

Cause of the patient’s symptoms: The abdominal obstruction is
caused by a lack of nervous system control of the intestinal
musculature. Normal gut function requires motility that is mediated by
the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
Underlying mechanism: The neurons that are fated to innervate the
distal gut travel along the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to populate the
enteric gut plexus. It is failure of neurons to successfully navigate this
distant trip that results in Hirschsprung disease.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
Congenital aganglionic megacolon or Hirschsprung disease was first recognized in 1886 as a cause of constipation in early infancy. The ganglion cells that
innervate the enteric nervous system are derived from neural crest cells. These
cells are of ectodermal origin and form along the lateral “crest” as the neural
plate undergoes neurulation. They have multiple fates, with some forming the
autonomic ganglia in the PNS. A subset of these cells travels with the vagus
nerve along the intestinal tract to populate the enteric plexus. These ganglion
cells arrive in the proximal colon by 8 weeks of gestational age and in the rectum by 12 weeks of gestational age. Arrest in this migration leads to an aganglionic segment and Hirschsprung disease. Hirschsprung disease occurs in
around 1 in 5000 live births in the United States. It is associated with enterocolitis in about one-third of cases, which represents the majority of the mortality. More severe cases are diagnosed in neonates with signs and symptoms of
bowel obstruction and inability to pass meconium or stool. Milder cases are
diagnosed at later ages with chronic constipation, abdominal swelling, and malnutrition (decreased growth). Most cases are sporadic in nature, though a family history of a similar condition is present in up to 30% of cases. Male cases
outnumber female cases four to one. A strong association exists with Down
syndrome—5%–15% of patients with Hirschsprung disease also have trisomy
21. Mutations in a variety of genes have been associated with Hirschsprung disease: the Ret proto-oncogene, glial cell-derived neurotropic factor (GDNF), the
endothelin-signaling system, and Sox10 (sex determining region Y-box).

Relate the various PNS developmental structures.
Understand the sequence of steps involved in PNS formation.
Understand the tissue-specific signals involved.

Definitions
PNS: The part of the nervous system that is not a part of the CNS, that is,
everything except the brain and spinal cord. It can be subdivided into
somatic and autonomic components.
Somatic nervous system: Composed of efferent nerves that control skeletal muscle and external sensory receptors, as well as afferent nerves that
convey sensory information from skin and muscle receptors.
Autonomic nervous system (ANS): Composed of efferent and afferent
nerves that control/regulate homeostatic processes and internal organ
physiology. The ANS can be further subdivided into the sympathetic and
parasympathetic systems.
Neural crest cell (NCC): An ectodermal-derived cell originating at the lateral edge of the neural plate. As the neural folds rise up and fuse to form
the neural tube, the NCCs are brought together along the dorsal “crest”
of the tube. These cells then dissociate from the neuroepithelium, allowing them to migrate throughout the organism to form the PNS.
Ectodermal placode: These placodes are discrete areas of thickened ectoderm that appear on the heads of all embryos and develop into the
peripheral sensory nervous system. Along with NCC, these placode cells
form the PNS.
Epithelio-mesenchymal transformation: A critical step in the differentiation of neural crest cells as they separate from the neuroepithelium.
This delamination process is mediated by changes in the cell–cell and
cell–intracellular matrix interactions.

DISCUSSION
The entire PNS of vertebrates is descended from two embryonic cell populations: the neural crest and the cranial ectodermal placodes. Both cell populations form at the lateral border of the neural plate, with the placodes occupying
the most rostral end of the neuraxis while the neural crest start at the level of
the diencephalon and descend caudally. They both give rise to a vast assortment of cell types. Neural crest cells form a tremendous array of different cell
types: bone and cartilage in the head, teeth, endocrine cells (adrenal medulla),
peripheral sensory neurons (including the dorsal root ganglia neurons), all
peripheral autonomic neurons (enteric, postganglionic sympathetic, and

96

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

parasympathetic neurons), all peripheral glial cells, and all melanocytes.
Cranial ectodermal placodes are mainly responsible for the numerous peripheral sensory organs in the head, including olfaction, mechanosensory hair
cells, trigeminal sensation to the head, taste, as well as all the endocrine cells
in the anterior pituitary.
The neural crest development into the PNS is characterized by a complex
program of events that can be summarized into three stages: induction, migration, and differentiation. The neural plate is defined by early BMP signaling
from axial mesoderm (see Chapter 11), and in much the same way, neural crests
are induced by signals from paraxial mesoderm. These signals appear to involve
intermediate levels of the BMP inhibitors, noggin and follistatin. Additional factors involving fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and the Wnt gene family continue
the process of forming neural crest. The epithelial-mesenchymal transition is the
last step in defining a neural crest cell, without which the cell is not a bona fide
neural crest cell. Multiple signals and genes contribute to this transformation;
however, it appears again that BMP signaling is implicated. This delamination
process proceeds in a rostral to caudal direction.
Neural crest cells now must migrate to their target tissues. Cranial neural
crest cells are observed to travel in characteristic streams associated with the
branchial arches as coherent populations. The paraxial mesoderm again plays a
vital role in providing the cues (mainly repulsive) to guide the traveling cells.
The extracellular matrix plays an important role by providing a permissive
pathway for migration. In the rest of the body, the paraxial mesoderm develops
into repeating units, called somites. Somites are masses of mesoderm distributed along the two sides of the neural tube that will eventually become dermis,
skeletal muscle, and vertebrae. These segmented somites define levels along the
rostrocaudal axis. Approximately 44 somites form and give rise to the bones of
the face, vertebral column, associated muscles, and overlying dermis.
For the final step in development, the neural crest must assume its final
identity through differentiation. There are two main theories to explain the lineage segregation of neural crest cells: instruction and selection. The first theory (instruction) posits that the neural crest is a homogenous group of
multipotent cells whose differentiation is instructed by environmental signals.
The second theory (selection) holds that the neural crest is a heterogeneous
population of predetermined cells, which are selected to survive in permissive
environments, and eliminated from inappropriate ones. The experimental evidence suggests that both multipotent and fate-restricted neural crest cells exist.
Most of the signals the cells respond to, not surprisingly, are from the tissues
which they migrate past and that surround their postmigration destination.
Initial therapy consists of gastrointestinal decompression to avoid perforation and enterocolitis. Nasogastric suctioning combined with frequent digital
rectal stimulation or irrigation is sufficient. Intravenous antibiotics or hydration is sometimes necessary to treat enterocolitis or dehydration, respectively.
Definitive treatment is surgical removal of the dysfunctional bowel and reanastomosis. Other therapeutics, often reserved for recurrent or intractable

B. The chromaffin (catecholamine secreting) cells of the adrenal
medulla arise from the neural crest, which also gives rise to ganglion
cells of the PNS, and melanocytes, among other structures. Neural
tube cells become the cells of the CNS. Epidermal placode cells

rise to the cells of the adrenal cortex.

B. In the developing nervous system, each spinal segment is paired
with a segment of mesoderm known as a somite. Each spinal segment
gives rise to paired dorsal sensory and ventral motor nerve roots. These
nerve roots innervate the sensory organs and muscles that derive from
the corresponding somite. Dermatomes and myotomes are a result of
this segmental development and innervation. Branchial arches are
related structures that occur in the developing head and neck. A motor
unit comprises a motor nerve and the muscles that it innervates, there
are multiple motor units in each spinal segment/somite pair.
A. Mesoderm plays a key role in generating signals that affect both
the migration of neural crest cells and their differentiation into their
final identities. Migration of cells is mostly guided by repulsive signals generated by mesoderm not in the proper location for the specific neural crest cells. The final identity of a neural crest cell is
determined in large part by signaling molecules secreted by the cells

The PNS develops from two populations of cells formed on the
lateral border of the neural plate: neural crest cells and ectodermal
placodes.
Neural crest cells undergo a three-stage process to form the PNS:
(1) induction, (2) migration, and (3) differentiation.
The paraxial mesoderm is a critical source of signaling in the establishment of the PNS.

CASE 13

A 38-year-old pregnant woman arrives to the emergency room after her “water
breaks.” On questioning, she admits to missing most of her prenatal care
appointments, but remembers one of her blood tests was “high,” and believes
that she is 4 weeks “early.” Initial examination demonstrates 6 cm of cervical
dilation and increasing strength and frequency of contractions. Fetal heart rate
monitoring reveals decelerations indicative of fetal distress, prompting delivery via cesarean section. The baby boy was delivered and had reassuring
APGAR scores. He is able to move his head and arms, but the lower legs are
motionless and contorted. Further examination reveals a 3-cm clear, fluidfilled sac in the mid-lower back.

ANSWERS TO CASE 13: NEURULATION
Summary: A baby boy was delivered with flaccid distal lower extremities.
Physical examination demonstrated moderate iliopsoas, hip adductors, quadriceps, and tibialis anterior function with flaccid antagonists resulting in hip
adduction-flexion, knee hyperextension, and foot inversion. A thin-walled cystic mass arises from the surrounding skin of the upper lumbar spine. Mild
hydrocephalus is noted. The mass is diagnosed as a myelomeningocele, a form
of neural tube defect (NTD). The imaging also revealed an associated Chiari
malformation and mild hydrocephalus.

◆

◆

◆

Anatomic deformity: Below the L4 level, the placode of tissue
consists of dysplastic neural elements that were unable to form a
closed neural tube. This dysfunction extends into the nerve roots
emanating from the placode. The exposed neural elements remain
covered in meninges, but are not covered by bone, muscle, or skin.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) fills the sac as it would normally fill the
spinal canal in the nonpathologic state, but because of the paucity of
overlying tissue, leakage of fluid is common.
Underlying etiology: The etiology of NTDs is multifactorial and not
clearly understood. NTDs constitute a variety of congenital
malformations, as severe as anencephaly (complete absence of
telencephalic structures) or as mild as a tethered spinal cord, which have
at its core the failure of proper neurulation.
Vitamin that decreases incidence of NTD: Approximately 400-800 μg
of folate per day reduces the risk for both first occurrence of NTDs and
recurrent NTDs.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
Congenital malformations of the brain occur in approximately 0.5% of live
births. Causes are generally ascribed to exogenous and endogenous sources.
Exogenous causes include nutritional factors, radiation, infections, chemicals,
ischemia, and medications. Endogenous causes are mainly genetic. Defective
neurulation, also called neural tube defects (NTDs), spinal dysraphisms or
spina bifida (split spine), are among the most common of these congenital
CNS malformations. Though the primary defect is a failure of neurulation and
of the neuroectoderm, subsequent maldevelopment occurs in the adjacent
mesoderm, which, in turn, is responsible for forming the appropriate skeletal
and muscular structures surrounding the nervous system. Therefore, NTDs
have been classically classified by the severity of this secondary mesodermal
disruption: the more severe spina bifida aperta (neural structures communicate with the atmosphere) or the less involved spina bifida occulta (neural elements are skin covered).

CLINICAL CASES

101

Spina bifida aperta or open NTDs are clinically quite obvious, like
myelomeningocele; however in spina bifida occulta, the lesion is covered by
skin (closed NTD), therefore rendering the underlying neurological involvement occult or hidden. There may be subtle skin changes present: a hairy
patch, dermal sinus tract, dimple, hemangioma, or lipoma. Besides cutaneous
stigmata, closed NTD can present with: spinal defects (scoliosis or defects in
the lamina), orthopedic deformities (clubbed feet or leg length asymmetry),
urological problems (neurogenic bladder or incontinence), and/or neurological symptoms (leg pain, weakness, or numbness and sometimes atrophy or
hyperreflexia).
Many suspected teratogens have been identified: radiation, infections,
hyperthermia, valproic acid, and folate deficiency. Folate is vital during periods
of rapid cell growth such as infancy and pregnancy, as it is needed to replicate
DNA. Folate deficiency hinders DNA synthesis and cell division, affecting
most clinically the bone marrow, a site of rapid cell turnover. Valproic acid is a
known folate antagonist and its association with NTD may be through that
action. Folic acid is not protective unless ingested during the time surrounding
conception. Screening tests have made a significant impact—both serologic
markers and imaging studies have proven utility. A blood test for maternal
serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) between 15 and 20 weeks of gestation can
reveal elevated levels, which can be indicative of an open NTD. In addition, the
use of fetal ultrasonography can diagnose an NTD with nearly 98% specificity
and 95% sensitivity. The prognosis for many forms of NTD is variable: anencephalic babies rarely survive more than a few hours or days and open NTDs
like myelomeningocele have many associated anomalies. Hindbrain malformations (Chiari II), hydrocephalus, syringomyelia, as well as brain stem and
cranial nerve malformations are all commonly associated with myelomeningoceles. These anomalies conspire to diminish the functional independence of
many babies that survive to adulthood. Nevertheless, many individuals with
mild NTDs can function independently.

Definitions
Neurulation: The developmental process by which the neural plate fuses
into the neural tube. The process begins in the cervical region and progresses in both directions, first closing the rostral or cranial neuropore,
followed by the caudal neuropore.

102

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Primary neurulation: Refers to the transformation of the neural structures
from a plate into a tube, thereby forming the brain and spinal cord.
Failure of primary neurulation results in open NTDs.
Secondary neurulation: An independent process from primarily neurulation that refers to the formation of the lower spinal cord from cells
derived from the embryological tail bud.
Spina bifida: Latin for “split spine,” another term to describe certain NTDs.
Anencephaly: Anencephaly or craniorachischisis is the most severe form
of NTD, and refer to a severe deformity in which an extensive defect in
the craniovertebral bone causes the brain to be exposed to amniotic
fluid. The defect normally occurs after neural fold development at day
16 of gestation but before closure of the anterior neuropore at day 24-26
of gestation.
Encephalocele: An encephalocele represents herniation of the brain through
a skull defect. This most commonly occurs in the occipital region in the
United States, while in Asian countries, the frontal bone is most involved.
Myelomeningocele: A condition in which the spinal cord and nerve roots
herniate into a sac comprised of the meninges. This sac protrudes
through a bone and musculocutaneous defect. The splayed open neural
structure is called the neural placode.
Meningocele: A meningocele is a herniation of only the meninges through
the bony defect (spina bifida). The spinal cord and nerve roots do not
herniate into the dural sac, as in a myelomeningocele. These lesions are
important to distinguish from myelomeningocele because their treatment and prognosis are different from myelomeningocele. Neonates
with a meningocele usually have normal findings upon physical examination and do not have associated neurological malformations such as
hydrocephalus or Chiari II malformations.
Diastematomyelia: A split cord malformation in which a bony spur splits
the spinal cord in two.
Tethered cord: Tethering of the spinal cord is caused by an abnormal adhesion or thickened filum that can cause traction on the spinal cord with
subsequent neurological deficits as the child grows.
Hydrocephalus: Latin for “water head,” it is an abnormal accumulation of
CSF within the cerebral ventricles because of physical obstruction
(obstructive hydrocephalus) or inability to absorb (nonobstructive
hydrocephalus) the circulating fluid.
Chiari malformations: Formerly called Arnold-Chiari malformations,
are a series (types I-III) of hindbrain defects. Type I is characterized
by the downward herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. A type II malformation is herniation of the cerebellar
vermis and brainstem below the foramen magnum. The type III malformation is essentially a posterior fossa encephalocele with herniation of the cerebellum through the posterior fossa bone and is a more
severe NTD.

CLINICAL CASES

103

Syringomyelia: Syringomyelia is a cavitation of the spinal cord leaving a
cystic space within the cord, which can cause progressive neurological
dysfunction. This cyst, called a syrinx, can expand and elongate over
time and destroy the spinal cord.

DISCUSSION
NTDs include a wide range of clinical malformations: anencephaly,
encephalocele, myelomeningocele, meningocele, diastematomyelia, and tethered cord. The lesions often present with associated failure of overlying bony
structures to fuse, hence the common term spina bifida, Latin for “split spine.”
The multiple descriptive names highlight the fact that these malformations
involve not only the ectodermal derivatives (central and peripheral nervous
system and skin), but also the other embryonic layers as well, most notably the
muscle and bone formed from axial mesoderm.
Timing is critical during development—the earlier the developmental
insult, the more devastating the consequences. In relation to NTDs, the first
important process is primary neurulation, which refers to the formation of the
neural structures into a tube, thereby forming the brain and spinal cord.
Secondary neurulation refers to the formation of the lower spinal cord, which
gives rise to the lumbar and sacral elements. The neural plate is formed at
gestational days 17-19, the neural fold occurs at days 19-21, and the fusion
of the neural folds occurs at days 22-23. Any disruption during these early
processes (neural plate formation until fusion into a neural tube) can cause
craniorachischisis, the most severe form of NTD. Subsequent events include
the closure of the rostral neuropore at days 24-26. Failure at this point can
result in anencephaly and encephaloceles. A myelomeningocele is a result of
disruption occurring around days 26-28, during the closure of the caudal neuropore. After day 28, disruptions are unlikely to be able to cause an open
NTD such as myelomeningocele, but may cause more subtle defects, like a
closed NTD or tethered cord.
The molecular mechanisms that control neurulation are poorly understood.
Experimental evidence suggests that the mechanisms involved in cranial neurulation and closure of the cranial neuropore differs from the closure process
at subsequent axial levels. As the flat neural plate physically invaginates and
cavitates to form a tube, it is not surprising that aspects of cellular polarity (to
direct the movement of cells), cellular cytoskeleton (to dynamically change the
shape of cells), and intercellular adhesion (to fuse the neural folds together)
are all critical for proper neurulation.
Various studies have provided evidence for abnormal folate metabolism
in cell lines from a subset of fetuses affected by NTDs, explaining why prenatal folate is so crucial for decreased incidence of NTDs; however, the specific abnormalities have yet to be elucidated. The recommended daily
allowance of folate for women of reproductive age is 400 μg while for pregnant women it is 600-800 μg. Foods that contain folate include leafy vegetables

104

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

such as spinach and turnip greens, dried beans and peas, fortified cereal
products, and sunflower seeds. Normal folate metabolism begins with folate
being reduced first to dihydrofolate and then tetrahydrofolate by the enzyme
dihydrofolate reductase.

Treatment options
Initial management of an infant with a myelomeningocele with leaking CSF is
to avoid trauma to the exposed neural placode and roots. Prolonged exposure
increases the risk for CNS infections manifested as meningitis or encephalitis,
sometimes leading to systemic sepsis. Surgical closure and repair of the lesion
by a pediatric neurosurgeon is required. Additional placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt to treat the hydrocephalus and prevent spinal fluid leakage
from the repair site can be done contemporaneously. Multiple other developmental anomalies are associated with NTD, which would need to be addressed
by a multidisciplinary team to include a geneticist, urologist, orthopedic surgeon, physical medicine specialist, and a pediatric neurosurgeon.

Failure of the entire neural tube to form would result in spontaneous
abortion of the developing embryo, and a failure of prosencephalon
to separate results in a condition known as holoprosencephaly.

CASE 14

The police officers bring in a 72-year-old unidentified woman whom they found
walking aimlessly around the grocery store parking lot. On questioning, she
remembers her name and that she is 72, but is not sure where she lives or how
to contact her family. Cursory examination reveals that she is wearing clean
clothes that are slightly wrinkled and with misaligned buttons. She denies any
pain or injury. She cannot recall ever seeing a doctor, commenting that she is
“okay” and has always been healthy. On neurological examination, she is unable
to recall the month/date/year, mistakenly reciting her date of birth several
times, and also has difficulty with arithmetic, word recall, and object-naming
tasks. The remainder of the physical examination and laboratory results are
normal for her age. Her daughter is found and states that her mother has had
difficulty with her memory beginning over 1 year ago, which has slowly progressed over time. She stopped shopping 6 months ago when she could not
remember what to buy or to keep her checkbook balanced and organized. Over
the last several months, she stopped cooking for herself. Her daughter has had
to assist increasingly with her mother’s daily activities. Upon careful consideration of the case, you conclude that the patient suffers from dementia, a
degenerative brain disorder that seriously affects a person’s ability to carry out

ANSWERS TO CASE 14: NEUROGENESIS
Summary: The most common form of dementia among older people is
Alzheimer disease (AD), which initially involves the parts of the brain that
control thought, memory, and language.

◆

◆

◆

Most common cause of dementia: AD is the most common of the
neurodegenerative disorders, which also includes Parkinson disease
(PD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS). The hallmark of these neurodegenerative disorders is the loss of
neuronal function, and eventual neuron death. Often, clinical signs
predate any significant neuron loss. In AD, the neuron loss occurs in the
hippocampus and cerebral cortices.
Abnormal structures associated with AD: Extensive research has
focused on the two well-known abnormalities found in AD, the amyloid
plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. The amyloid plaques contain small,
toxic cleavage products from a larger precursor protein, amyloid
precursor protein (APP), while the neurofibrillary tangles consist of
abnormally phosphorylated versions of the microtubule-associating
protein, tau. There has been controversy surrounding whether these
protein accumulations were the causative factors or just the molecular
debris left behind after a prior molecular insult.
Risk factors: There are multiple risk factors for AD that can not be
altered: age (incidence of up to 50% in those 85 years and older),
family history of AD, sex (females are at higher risk), and certain
genetic traits (a form of apolipoprotein E4 [Apo E4] increases the risk).
The evidence for lifestyle modifiable factors is unfortunately less
reliable and somewhat controversial. Head injury, most notably in
boxers and other full-contact athletes, has also been postulated to be a
risk factor for dementia.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
Although scientists are learning more every day, right now they still do not
know what causes AD, and there is no cure. A Mini Mental State Examination
(MMSE) is given to the patient. It is used to screen for the presence of cognitive impairment over a number of domains. Cognition is defined as mental
activity such as memory, thinking, attention, reasoning, decision making, and
dealing with concepts. She scored 18 out of 30 possible points, consistent with
a diagnosis of moderate AD.
Neurodegeneration is a general term that covers many neurodegenerative
diseases, including AD, PD, HD, and ALS. Neurodegeneration can also result
from stroke, heart attack, head and spinal cord trauma, and bleeding in the
brain. Neurodegenerative diseases are often characterized by a neurological
deficit, a loss of memory, mobility, independence, or well-being. Each

CLINICAL CASES

disease has its own characteristics, but all progress slowly over time, and all
invariably result in premature death. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide, with approximately 4.5 million affected individuals in the United States alone. It is also the most common cause of cognitive
decline, or dementia, in the elderly. From time of diagnosis, life expectancy
averages 8 years. Diagnosis hinges upon excluding other conditions that can
cause cognitive impairment: small undetected strokes, depression, medications’ side effects, and even PD (another neurodegenerative disorder) has an
associated dementia complex. Because AD can only be 100% accurately
diagnosed by autopsy, the clinical diagnosis of AD relies upon a clinical picture composed of medical history, blood tests (to rule out other medical conditions), mental status evaluation, neuropsychological testing, and possibly
brain imaging (see Figure 14-1). The current interest in treating neurodegenerative diseases like AD with cell-based technologies has renewed the
importance of understanding the developmental biology involved with how
neurons are formed in the first place. To recapitulate the developmental
process, science must first understand that process. Neurogenesis, or the regulated generation of neurons involves (1) early discrimination of neuron
from nonneuron, (2) acquisition of specialized neuronal properties, and (3)
determination of which cells will live or die as part of development.

DISCUSSION
The early cellular process of neurogenesis is generally viewed as the progression from multipotent stem cells to fate-restricted neuronal precursors, through
the gradual reduction of potential fates. Though the multipotent neuroepithelial cells have long processes that span the width of the early neural tube, all
cell division occurs at the ventricular surface. A symmetric cell division is
important for self-renewal and critical for early expansion of the population.
Later, neural progenitors are produced by asymmetric cell division, which
results in the loss of the ability to self-renew, and consequently the cells
become more fate restricted. Neural progenitors then begin to express genes
that promote differentiation. The last step is to leave the cell cycle (mitosis)
and become a neuron.
As the nervous system goes through neural induction, spatial patterning is
established along the rostrocaudal and dorsoventral axes. This imprints positional identity upon the neuroepithelial cells, which influences the types of neurons that can arise from the precursors, a fate restriction. For example, isolated
cells from the spinal region give rise to cells that populate the spine, whereas
cells from the forebrain generate cell types appropriate for the cerebral cortex. A
similar process occurs along the dorsoventral axis with these progenitors forming dorsal sensory interneurons and ventral motor neurons. Temporal regulation
of neurogenesis affects the neuroprogenitor population as well. In the developing cortex, newly born neurons leave the ventricular zone and migrate along specialized glial cells to populate the cortical layers. Neurons migrate from the
ventricular zone to the subventricular zone to their destination via radial glial
migration. The glial cells have long processes that extend perpendicular to the
subventricular zone and form scaffolding for migrating neurons. Interestingly,
the time at which the neurons become postmitotic and leave the cell cycle, their
“birthdate,” correlates precisely with their laminar position. Neurons born earlier
reside in the deeper layers, while those that are born later populate the more
superficial layers. Transplantation studies demonstrated that the early cortical
progenitor cells are multipotent and competent to make both early (deep layer)
and late (superficial layer) cell types, whereas later progenitors are restricted in
their competence and only make the late cell types.
The molecular mechanisms that regulate neurogenesis, like many developmental programs, constitute a balance of forces: forces that promote neural
identity and those that constrain the differentiation process. What molecular
events are responsible for driving ectodermal cells to become neurons? The
first event is to define a subset of cells that can have the potential or competence to become neural precursors. This cluster of cells within the embryological ectoderm, termed a proneural cluster, all express low levels of proneural
genes. Through the process of lateral inhibition, neural precursor cells inhibit
the expression of proneural genes in neighboring cells, thus preventing them
from assuming a neural fate. On a molecular level, this cell–cell interaction is
mediated by the Notch-Delta signaling system. The neural precursor cell

112

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

expresses Delta ligand that activates the Notch receptor on adjacent cells. This
activity downregulates the proneural genes and Delta ligand expression in the
neighboring cell. This decreased Delta expression in the neighboring cell, by
release of inhibition, results in the upregulation of proneural gene expression
in the precursor cell, fate-restricting it to becoming a neural precursor cell.
There is no cure for AD. The two drug classes approved by the FDA to help
delay the progression of dementia symptoms are cholinesterase inhibitors and
memantine. Cholinesterase inhibitors work by blocking the degradation of
acetylcholine (Ach), thereby increasing Ach levels in the synaptic cleft.
Memantine blocks the NMDA receptor which is thought to be responsible for
glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity.

B. Proneural genes are necessary for the differentiation of ectodermal cells into neural precursor cells. The differentiation of the

CLINICAL CASES

113

embryological ectoderm into neuroectoderm is a very complicated
process that depends on a complex interplay of numerous signaling
molecules. Certain embryological ectodermal cells express
proneural genes, which are necessary for the differentiation of the
cells into neural precursor cells. These proneural genes are inhibited
by a family of proteins known as bone morphogenic proteins
(BMPs). Signals from embryological mesoderm like chordin, noggin, and follistatin, antagonize the action of BMPs, allowing the
expression of the proneural genes and development of embryonic
ectoderm into neuroectoderm. Hox genes are involved in a number
of embryological developmental stages, including differentiation of
the rhombencephalon. Wnt genes are involved in closing of the neural groove into the neural plate.
[14.2]

A. Through the process of lateral inhibition, proneural cells secrete
signaling molecules that downregulate proneural gene expression in
neighboring cells, thereby decreasing the likelihood that those cells
will become neuroectodermal cells. While this process does somewhat restrict the fate of the cells that are prevented from becoming
neural cells, lateral inhibition is a more specific answer than cell fate
determination, and therefore the best choice. Neurulation is the
process by which the neural plate becomes the neural tube. Apoptosis
(programmed cell death) is a process involved in many other developmental processes.

[14.3]

C. The Notch-Delta signaling system is responsible for lateral inhibition. Proneural cells secrete delta ligand, which binds to the notch
receptor on neighboring cells, resulting in decreased expression of
proneural genes. This also causes a decrease in delta expression in
those inhibited cells, thereby relieving inhibition on the initial
proneural cell. The other combinations of signaling molecules are
involved in axonal guidance.

the history of tobacco use and mild hypertension, he does not have any significant medical issues and has no other complaints. Family history is negative.
His only medication is an inhaler that he uses to help with his breathing.
Physical examination reveals a tremor in both hands, with a rubbing of the
thumb and forefinger—“pill rolling.” His muscles are stiff to passive movement, while causing a small amount of discomfort. Examination of his gait
showed a wide-based, shuffling walk, that has a noticeable loss of normal arm
swing. He has a bright intellect, and has no difficulties with any cognitive tasks
presented to him. He is diagnosed with Parkinson disease (PD) and the physician discusses the diagnosis and disease process with the patient, explaining to
him that these symptoms usually worsen and that new symptoms may occur
such as loss of normal facial expressions (smiling, blinking), impaired speech
(often very soft and monotonous), difficulty in swallowing, and even cognitive
decline or dementia.

Brain structure affected: Substantia nigra, a component of the basal
ganglia. PD is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement. It is
one of a group of common neurodegenerative disorders, which includes
Alzheimer disease (AD), Huntington disease (HD), and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (ALS). In PD, the symptoms are caused by the selective
death of a specific cell type in the basal ganglia, the pigmented
dopaminergic (DA) neurons of the substantia nigra. These diseased
neurons often contain Lewy bodies, a specific type of cytoplasmic
inclusion.
Underlying mechanism: The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected
nuclei consisting of the putamen, caudate, globus pallidus, subthalamic
nucleus, and substantia nigra. These nuclei affect multiple cortical
functions, including motor control, cognition, emotions, and learning. The
loss of dopaminergic neurons leads to reduced levels of the
neurotransmitter dopamine, altering the function of the basal ganglia.
Prevention: Herbicide and pesticide exposure has been linked to the
development of PD; however, no specific chemicals have been identified.
As with all neurodegenerative diseases, the risk increases with age.
There is also a genetic contribution—first degree relatives confer a 5%
risk. However, neither age nor family genetics are modifiable.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
PD is recognized as one of the most common neurological disorders, affecting
approximately 1% of individuals more than 60 years of age, with an incidence
of 5-20 cases per 100,000 people a year. Cardinal features include resting
tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. The major neuropathologic findings in PD are a loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra
pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies. The basal ganglia circuit
modulates the cortical signals necessary for normal movement. Impulses from
the cerebral cortex are processed through the basal ganglia-thalamus circuit
and act as a feedback pathway. Output from the basal ganglia motor circuit is
directed toward suppressing the thalamocortical pathway and decreasing
movement. The loss of dopaminergic signaling in the basal ganglia increases
the inhibition of the thalamocortical pathway, leading to further suppression of
movement (see Figure 15-1).
The molecular mechanisms of PD remain elusive. The protein alphasynuclein recently was discovered to be a major structural component of Lewy
bodies. Improper folding of this protein may result in abnormal aggregation and

toxicity to neurons. Lewy bodies also contain the protein ubiquitin, a key player
in targeting proteins for degradation. A variety of rare familial forms of PD have
shed light on several possible molecular mechanisms for the disorder. These
mutations have implicated oxidative stress and mitochondrial injury, as well as
dysfunction of the ubiquitin system for protein degradation as pathways leading
to neuron death in PD. The specific nature of the degenerating system (dopaminergic neurons) and the discrete location (substantia nigra pars compacta) have
made PD an attractive target for cell-based therapies. The early successful transplantation of fetal mesencephalic neurons (rich in dopaminergic neurons) into
the degenerating Parkinsonian brain demonstrated that transplanted cells could
survive and functionally integrate into neuronal circuits. Recent work has been

118

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

focused on engineering stem cells to assume the phenotype of the degenerating
substantia nigra neurons. In order to be successful, the cells must (1) behave like
dopaminergic neurons and release dopamine, (2) integrate functionally into the
neuronal circuitry, (3) yield sufficient numbers for long-term survival, and (4)
reverse the symptoms of PD. Critical to this process is an understanding of the
pathway that neurons undergo to determine their cellular fate, so that it can be
replicated to entrain new populations of stem cells.

Competence: The ability of a cell to respond to development signals.
Fate specification/determination: Both terms refer to the mechanism by
which precursor cells begin with many possible fates and are progressively
limited in their potential, until they finally differentiate into a mature cell.
Phenotype: The characteristics or traits that a cell exhibits. Different cell
types display different phenotypes, which are often because of underlying differences in protein expression, especially transcription factors.
Intrinsic determination: A model that explains progressive cell fate
restriction by the influences of the cell’s lineage and internal signals.
This would be the cell’s metaphorical version of the nature versus nurture debate in human development.
Extrinsic determination: A model that explains progressive fate restriction by the influences of the environment, as experienced by cell–cell
interactions and diffusible signaling molecules.
Apoptosis: The active process of programmed cell death, typified by cell
shrinkage, condensation of chromatin, cellular fragmentation, and
phagocytosis of cellular debris. A prominent feature of neuronal development is the death of cells by apoptosis.
Trophic factor: A substance that encourages survival and proliferation of
a cell or tissue.

DISCUSSION
After a newly born cell exits mitosis and becomes committed to the neuronal lineage, it must continue to respond to signals that will influence the type of neuronal fate it will acquire. There is significant debate as to where neurogenesis

CLINICAL CASES

119

ends and neural fate determination begins. As previously discussed, during cortical development, the neural precursor cells that are born later have had their
fates restricted—they can only populate the superficial cortical layers. In other
words, these precursor cells that were born later are no longer competent to form
cells in the deep cortical layers. Therefore, during neurogenesis, some aspects of
fate determination have already been decided just by the timing of birth. The
developmental plan is best viewed as a continuum of overlapping processes.
Many prospective neurons express the same genes early in development,
and at some point, as their fates diverge, they begin to express unique genes
and proteins required for their eventual fate. In this manner, the cells acquire
progressively specialized neuronal phenotypes. The influences which a maturing neuron encounters can be classified as intrinsic or extrinsic signals.
One example of intrinsic determination occurs during early neurogenesis
when the neural progenitor pool divides along the ventricular surface in the
ventricular zone. The early cell divisions occur with the plane of division perpendicular to the ventricular surface, generating two identical daughter cells,
both capable of further proliferation. The later divisions occur with the plane
of division parallel to the ventricular surface and are asymmetrical with one
daughter cell retaining the ability to proliferate, while the second daughter is
postmitotic and migrates out of the ventricular zone (VZ, ie, area surrounding
the ventricles). This intriguing process appears to be mediated by two intracellular proteins, Numb and Prospero. These proteins are asymmetrically
inherited by the daughter cells during division, and thus confer different phenotypes to the progeny.
Neuronal target tissues often influence the fate of neurons via extrinsic determinants, a concept called target specification. An example is the specification
of neurotransmitter phenotype of the autonomic neurons by sweat glands. Most
sympathetic neurons use norepinephrine as their primary neurotransmitter; however, the exocrine sweat glands in the hands and feet use acetylcholine instead.
The maturing sympathetic neuron first expresses the norepinephrine phenotype,
but when it contacts the sweat glands, the neurons gradually convert their neurotransmitter phenotype to acetylcholine. The signals for this fate specification
appear to be a soluble cytokine of the interleukin-6 family secreted by the sweat
glands. Target tissues play other critical roles in the fate determination of neurons. Target cells of developing neurons produce a limited amount of a trophic
factor that can control the survival of the innervating neurons—the neurotrophic
factor hypothesis. Nerve growth factor (NGF) was the first isolated neurotrophic
factor. Survival of some neurons requires NGF, a target-derived factor. NGF
works by binding to tyrosine kinase receptors on the dependent axon and is
transported in a vesicle via retrograde fashion to the cell body, where it can affect
transcription and cellular differentiation. Many other families of neurotrophic
factors have been isolated: the neurotrophins, IL-6 class, transforming growth
factor beta (TGF-β) class, as well as fibroblast growth factor (FGF). It now
appears that elimination of neurotrophic factors can control survival by activating programmed cell death, or apoptosis.

120

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

An important principle in neuron cell fate is the gradual acquisition of progressively more restrictive fates until the final neuron identity is reached. This
process is mirrored phenotypically by the expression of various proteins during development. The protein expression patterns can define different developmental stages, resulting in a hierarchy of gene expression. This is best
illustrated in the developing spinal cord by the LIM family of transcription
factors. This family of proteins is expressed in different overlapping subpopulations of motor neurons. The protein that all the motor neurons express is
Islet1, suggesting that this protein is responsible for characteristics common
for all motor neurons. Other LIM proteins are subsequently expressed, which
progressively identify specific motor neuron subgroups and even their behaviors like axon projection or target selection.

Treatment options
Unlike most other neurodegenerative disorders, PD responds well to treatment.
The mainstay of treatment is medical treatment with oral levodopa (L-dopa), a
precursor to dopamine which can cross from the blood into the brain and be
converted by neurons into dopamine. L-dopa is often combined with carbidopa and called Sinemet, which helps to decrease the systemic side
effects. Other medications help potentiate the effect of L-dopa treatment by
inhibiting the degradation of dopamine: selegiline blocks the enzyme
monoamine oxidase, and a class of inhibitors to the enzyme catechol-Omethyltransferase (COMT). Another group of drugs, the anticholinergics,
alters the basal ganglia signaling to compensate for the loss of dopamine
action. Once commonly practiced, surgical treatment has receded as the
first line of therapy, but as symptoms progress and are refractory to medications, surgery has been reevaluated. Selective placement of destructive
lesions to the thalamus (thalamotomy) and globus pallidus (pallidotomy)
can be helpful in controlling the symptoms, but can carry significant risks.
A newer form of surgical treatment called deep brain stimulation (DBS)
involves stimulating the subthalamic nucleus with tiny implanted electrodes
and a pacemaker-like neurostimulator. Regenerative medical interventions,
such as gene therapy and stem cell replacement are areas of considerable
current interest and funding.

Answers
[15.1]

A. Cortical neurons all originate from neural precursor cells located
in the ventricular zone. Once generated, these immature neurons
migrate (via radial glial migration or tangential migration) to their
final location in the cortex. While it is true that the precursor cells that
give rise to neurons originally came from the neural plate, the neuron
itself originated in the ventricular zone, making that a better answer.

[15.2]

A. One of the interesting features of the neural progenitor cells in the
ventricular zone is that as development progresses, their fate becomes
more determined. The stem cells that give rise to cortical layer V neurons (relatively deep in the cortex) are competent to give rise to all
neurons more superficial in the cortex. Conversely, a stem cell that
gives rise to a layer I neuron (superficial in the cortex) is not competent to generate a neuron in the deeper layers.

[15.3]

C. These sympathetic neurons release acetylcholine instead of norepinephrine because of extrinsic determination. The ultimate

122

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

neurotransmitter released by the sympathetic neurons innervating
the sweat glands is determined by trophic factors released from the
sweat glands themselves. These factors induce changes in the neuron that causes it to change from an adrenergic neuron to a cholinergic neuron. This is an example of extrinsic determination: the
fate of the neuron is determined by a cell other than itself. While
this is a type of cell fate restriction, extrinsic determination is more
specific and therefore a better answer.

CASE 16

A 2-week-old baby boy is brought into the emergency room by ambulance
after he started shaking uncontrollably during his sleep. When the paramedics
and transport team arrived at the home, he was still shaking with his eyes deviated upward. When he stopped shaking, he remained unresponsive with his
head next to a puddle of vomit. At the hospital, he was more arousable, but irritable on examination. The mother states that the infant had an uncomplicated
gestation and birth history. There haven’t been any issues that concerned the
parents—no family history of diseases, no recent exposures to sick persons,
and no fevers. They did notice that he coughed a lot during and after his feedings. Examination of the baby was normal, until a second episode of generalized involuntary stiffness and shaking occurred. The infant was intubated and
placed on a mechanical ventilator to help him breathe and stabilized with medications. An emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was obtained,
and the boy was taken to the intensive care unit. The patient was diagnosed
with lissencephaly (LIS).

ANSWERS TO CASE 16: NEURONAL MIGRATION
Summary: This baby boy was previously healthy before he presented acutely with
generalized seizures. There was no evidence of a gross neurological deficit or any
significant developmental delay. The head CT demonstrated impaired cerebral
cortical structure with loss of the normal cortical involutions and gyrations, giving
a “smooth” appearance to the cerebral cortex. A diagnosis of lissencephaly (LIS)
was made. The only other notable abnormality was some mild muscle stiffness in
his extremities.

◆
◆

◆

Appearance of brain: Smooth or nearly smooth cerebral surface
lacking the normal gyral convolutions. LIS is always associated with an
abnormally thick cortex, reduced or abnormal lamination, and diffuse
neuronal heterotopia (displaced neurons).
Etiology: LIS occurs because of a disruption of normal embryogenesis
in the brain. Migration of postmitotic neurons from the ventricular zone
(VZ, ie, area surrounding the ventricles) to the cortical plate during
nervous system development is defective, resulting in brain
malformations, including human LIS.
Origins of neurons and neuronal migration: Though several
neurogenic zones have been identified in the brain, most require further
study. The VZ is the most prominent neurogenic zone and newly formed
neuroblasts migrate radially to differentiate into glial cells, and also via
the rostral migratory system to form neurons in the olfactory bulb.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
Classical LIS consists of various features: (1) diffuse or widespread agyriapachygyria, (2) an abnormally thick cortex, (3) enlarged ventricles without
hydrocephalus, (4) frequently abnormal corpus callosum, (5) grossly normal
brainstem and cerebellum, (6) normal or slightly small head circumference,
and (7) slow head growth. A study of LIS in The Netherlands demonstrated a
prevalence of approximately 12 cases per million births while data from the
United States showed rates of 4–11 per million births. Together, these malformations constitute a continuum, the agyria-pachygyria spectrum of malformations. Not unlike other disorders, LIS can occur in varying degrees, however,
the affected children will generally have mental retardation, seizure disorder,
difficulty swallowing and eating, difficulty controlling his/her muscles, stiffness or spasticity of arms and legs, and slowed growth and developmental
delays. The identification of the human genes responsible for LIS has
advanced the knowledge of how neurons migrate. The first human neuronal
migration gene to be cloned was LIS1. This gene encodes a regulatory subunit
of an enzyme, termed platelet-activating factor (PAF)-acetylhydrolase. This
enzyme catalyzes the release of potent phospholipids that act as signaling

CLINICAL CASES

125

proteins within neurons and interacts with tubulin to suppress microtubule
dynamics. The highest levels of LIS1 are detected in the developing cortex,
consistent with the protein’s putative role in neuronal migration. Mutations in
LIS1 disrupt the structure or cytoskeleton of neurons. This cytoskeleton is
made up of proteins (like tubulin) that give cells their distinctive shapes and
normal cellular movement requires regulated rearrangements of this cellular
structure. Disruptions of the cytoskeleton and its flexibility affect the ability of
neurons to migrate normally and are thought to lead to the disrupted cortical
pattern seen in children with LIS. Another gene XLIS, which has been identified
in X-linked LIS, also interacts with the protein tubulin. Thus, the cytoskeleton,
through analysis of these human disorders, plays a key and critical role in the
normal migration of neurons.

Definitions
Radial migration: A form of neural migration that occurs as nascent neurons travel from the VZ radially out toward the pial surface.
Radial glial cells: A type of glial cell that forms a physical scaffold for migration with its processes that extend from the VZ out to the pial surface.
Tangential migration: A form of neural migration, also called nonradial
migration, that does not require interaction with radial glial cell processes.
Permissive factor: A signal that passively allows a process to occur, without actively promoting its occurrence, for example, an abundance of
nutrients is a permissive factor in cellular growth.
Extracellular matrix (ECM): The network of glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and hyaluronic acid that defines the space in a tissue that is not part
of a cell.
Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs): A family of cell membrane–associated
proteins that interact and bind with extracellular molecules or ligands.
They can transmit signals through the cell membrane to the intracellular
cytoskeleton.

Discussion
After a newly-born neuron exits mitosis and becomes committed to the neuronal lineage, it must leave its VZ birthplace and travel to the appropriate

126

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

laminar position. This neural migration can occur by three general mechanisms: two forms of radial migration (somal translocation and locomotion)
and a nonradial or tangential migration.
Postmitotic neurons migrate radially away from the VZ toward the outer
pial surface to reach the top of the cortical plate. There, they assemble into layers with distinct patterns of cortical connections. Radial migration can occur
via two methods: somal translocation and glia-guided locomotion. Somal
translocation consists of movement of the neuron’s soma (cell body) and
nucleus toward the cortical plate by selectively releasing the ventricular attachment site while maintaining their pial attachment site. Glia-guided locomotion
occurs by movement along the scaffold formed by the radially oriented
processes of the radial glial. The early-generated neurons predominantly use
somal translocation when the ventricular-pial distance is shorter. Latermigrating pyramidal neurons first use glia-guided locomotion and then subsequently switch to somal translocation as they move past earlier generated
neurons. These neurons use the radial glia processes as their primary migratory guides, forming specialized membrane contacts with the cell processes.
Until recently, the predominant model of neural migration was that the vast
majority of neurons utilized radial migration along glial processes. However,
recent evidence has forced a revision of this model. In the developing neocortex, most excitatory glutamatergic, pyramidal neurons do follow radial migration; however, most GABAergic, nonpyramidal interneurons travel tangentially.
These neurons do not appear to use the radial glial processes or other specific
cellular scaffolds.
Movement of neuronal cells from their site of birth in the VZ to their specific cortical destination relies on three cellular events: initiation, maintenance,
and termination. In turn, the molecular mechanisms that regulate all three cellular processes rely upon cell–cell recognition and adhesive interactions
between neurons, glia, and the ECM.
The initiation of migration must occur along appropriate pathways and/or
substrates. Reorganization of the actin-based cytoskeleton appears responsible
for priming the neuron for migration. These instructive factors may be extracellular signals present in the VZ. Subsequent cell–cell interactions form junctional domains in the cell membrane. In the radial migration stream, the
neurons interact with the processes of the radial glia through these domains.
The internal microtubule-based cytoskeletal components subsequently associate with these junctional domains to provide the force required for active cellular movement. Mutations in genes responsible for this maintenance phase of
migration have been linked to human diseases, like LIS. Many of these mutations occur in proteins responsible for interactions with the microtubule-based
cytoskeleton. Extracellular signals from the ECM appear to modulate this
motility, via interactions with the integrin family of CAMs. The many subtypes of integrins have different molecular adhesive characteristics and are
associated with varied intracellular signal transduction pathways. Thus, the
specific integrin expression on the neuron surface and interactions with the

CLINICAL CASES

127

ligands in the ECM and other cells can modulate the pattern of migration from
initiation to termination. In fact, the destination tissue itself may relate the signals to stop the migration process by changing the ligand environment—
whether from afferent fibers in the target zone, the destination neuronal
population, or changes in the terminal radial glia process.

of neurons, rather than a defect in tangential migration of neurons. In
this condition, neurons in the brain are located inappropriately below
the cortex. This is caused by a failure of the neurons to migrate from
their originating location in the VZ to their proper place in the cortex.
The neurons are generated correctly, so there is no error in neurogenesis, nor is there a failure to stop migrating.

Ventricular Zone, and then migrate to their final locations. These
final locations could include the cortex, or the dorsal or volar plate in
the developing brainstem and spinal cord.

C. GABAergic neurons migrate via tangential migration. Recently
it has become known that there are multiple mechanisms by which
neurons migrate from the VZ to their final location. It appears that
excitatory neurons tend to migrate radially, via radial glial migration
or nonglial guided somal translocation. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons, however, seem to migrate tangentially, and do not utilize any
sort of glial mediated guidance.

CASE 17

A 28-year-old pregnant woman presents to her obstetrician’s office for a routine prenatal appointment. She is a healthy person without any medical conditions and has been taking her prenatal vitamins and has stopped drinking all
alcoholic beverages, as instructed. She and her husband are excited about the
pregnancy. The ultrasound examination at 12 weeks confirmed a single fetus
with good placental attachment and cardiac function. There was some question
regarding the head size, so a second ultrasound was obtained at 18 weeks. This
examination was more detailed and revealed incomplete separation of the
cerebral ventricles. A perinatologist who specializes in developmental malformations was consulted, and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
scan was obtained. This detailed imaging study confirmed the incomplete division of the embryonic forebrain into distinct lateral cerebral hemispheres. The

ANSWERS TO CASE 17: FORMATION OF THE
CEREBRAL CORTEX
Summary: This mid-gestational fetus is diagnosed with holoprosencephaly
(HPE). The remainder of the gestation and pregnancy was uneventful. A
scheduled elective cesarean section delivery was performed at full-term gestational age.

◆

Brain structure affected: This disorder is characterized by failure of
the prosencephalon, or forebrain of the embryo, to develop.

◆

Mechanism: The prosencephalon develops at the tip of the neural tube
at around 3 weeks in human embryos, and will be further subdivided
into diencephalon and telencephalon, and by the fifth or sixth week has
divided bilaterally into cerebral hemisphere. HPE results when this
cleavage fails to occur.

CLINICAL CORRELATIONS
HPE is a complex congenital brain malformation characterized by failure of
the forebrain to bifurcate into two hemispheres, a process normally complete
by the fifth week of gestation. It is the most common developmental defect of
the forebrain and midface in humans, occurring in 1 in 250 pregnancies. Since
only 3% of fetuses with HPE survive to delivery, the live birth prevalence is
only approximately 1 in 10,000. The majority of cases, up to two thirds, consist of the most serious form, alobar HPE. The HPE phenotypes are distributed
along a continuum:
1.

2.

3.

4.

Alobar HPE (most severe)—the brain is not divided and there are
severe abnormalities: an absence of the interhemispheric fissure, a single primitive ventricle, fused thalami, and absent midline structures
like the third ventricle, olfactory bulbs and tracts, and optic tracts.
Semilobar HPE (moderate)—the brain is partially divided and there
are some moderate abnormalities: there are two hemispheres in the rear
but not in the front of the brain (partially separated cerebral hemispheres and a single ventricular cavity).
Lobar HPE (mild)—the brain is divided and there are some mild
abnormalities: there is a well-developed interhemispheric fissure but
some midline structures remain fused.
Middle interhemispheric variant of HPE (MIHV)—the middle of the
brain (posterior frontal and parietal lobes) are not distinctly separated.

Prognosis, as would be expected, varies depending on disease severity and
associated malformations. Patients with alobar HPE have a survival rate of
approximately 50% by 4–5 months of age and approximately 20% at 1 year of life.
Isolated semilobar and lobar HPE have empiric survival rates of approximately

CLINICAL CASES

131

50% to 1 year. Almost all survivors have some degree of developmental delay
presenting with mental retardation usually correlated to the severity of HPE.
Feeding difficulties leading to aspiration pneumonia and/or failure to thrive frequently occur in individuals within all subtypes. The diverse etiologies that lead
to HPE highlight the susceptibility of early nervous system development to perturbation, either from genetic alterations, epigenetic factors, or both. The common denominator in HPE is there is failure of cleavage of the prosencephalon
which gives rise to the cerebral hemispheres and diencephalon during early first
trimester (5-6 weeks), resulting in persistent fusion of the cerebral cortices. The
best known genetic model for the disease is the sonic hedgehog (shh) signaling
that occurs during cortical development. The mouse mutants that have disrupted shh gene expression develop the murine equivalent of HPE, complete
with cyclopia. In humans, mutations in shh have been found in 17% of familial
and 3.7% of sporadic cases of HPE. Shh is involved in multiple developmental
events at various times during embryogenesis. Shh participates in the establishment of the left–right axis, specification of the floor plate and ventral
spinal cord, as well as ventral identity of the brain along the entire rostral–caudal central nervous system. Later during embryogenesis, shh has a crucial role
in the development of various structures: the limbs, the pituitary gland, the neural crest cells, the midbrain, the cerebellum, the eyes, and the face. Other genes
that have been linked to the shh molecular pathway also result in HPE phenotypes when mutated—PTCH, GLI2, ZIC2, and DHCR7.

connection and the maturation of the pre- and postsynaptic terminals
into mature functional units.

DISCUSSION
The central nervous system is a complex system, and the brain as the most specialized area of the CNS is more elaborate, yet. The cerebral hemispheres, the
latest evolutionary advancement in the nervous system raises the level of complexity even further. The mathematics are prodigious—the human cerebral
cortices contain an estimated 20 billion neurons, and each cortical neuron is
connected to upward of 10,000 other neurons. These billions of cells that make
trillions of connections all start from a single cell.
The cerebral cortex relies on the same basic principles of development that
the rest of the nervous system utilizes. During early neurogenesis, neural progenitors must be specified in the neuroectoderm and begin to adopt a fate separate from their ectodermal brethren. These precursor cells must expand and
form first a neural plate then proceed to invaginate and form the neural tube,
via continued neurogenesis and neurulation. As immature neurons are born in
the ventricular zone, they experience various intrinsic and extrinsic signals that
begin to establish their identity. This fate determination occurs through temporal specification, spatial specification, and other determining factors. As
these neurons become increasingly “educated” in their eventual fate, they are
forced to migrate to their cortical destination through a complex environment
consisting of extracellular matrix (ECM) and numerous cell populations, all
sending out an extensive repertoire of attractant and repellant cues (neuronal
migration). The use of similar cues guides the leading processes of migrating
neurons to form axonal projections to their destined target (axon guidance)
and establish a functional connection or synapse (synaptogenesis) with appropriate targets. It is these final steps, the labyrinth of connections and the computational networks they define, that are the distinguishing mark of the
cerebral cortex.

CLINICAL CASES

133

The central nervous system begins to adopt a “cortical fate” with the early
establishment of spatial patterning. The regional patterning of the forebrain
relies upon the establishment of an anterior–posterior or rostral–caudal axis.
This axis defines the first three initial vesicular enlargements in the neural tube
(from anterior to posterior): the prosencephalon (forebrain), mesencephalon
(midbrain), and rhombencephalon (hindbrain). Further development of the
prosencephalon results in an additional enlargement, separating the forebrain
into the telencephalon and diencephalon. It is this telencephalon that is the
embryologic precursor to the cerebral cortices. The developmental divergence
continues as the spatial and connectivity patterns of neurons within a functional
neural circuit are so complex that they require a special set of mechanisms.
Axon guidance involves the targeting of a specific neuron’s axon to the
appropriate target. Early developmental evidence resulted in the chemospecificity hypothesis, first proposed by Roger Sperry in 1963, which stated that
chemical matching between axons and their target tissues was responsible for
appropriate guidance. This model suggested the existence of “recognition molecules” that were responsible for the matching. The chemospecificity hypothesis posits that signaling molecules at targets provide positional information in
the form of gradients that would be detected by complementary gradients of
receptors on axons to guide their growth. For this seminal idea in neurobiology, Roger Sperry was awarded the Nobel Prize. The leading process of the
axon, the growth cone, is responsible for sensing these recognition cues and
responding to them. Axonal growth cone movement toward its final destination occurs through polymerization or depolymerization of actin in the fingerlike projections of the growth cone. Molecules bind to receptors on the growth
cone and cause a signaling cascade that results in polymerization.
Today, a vast array of molecules has been discovered that exert either attractant or repellent forces on the growing axons. In addition, many of these molecules can be attached to other cells or the extracellular environment and act over
short distances, or they can be secreted, diffusible molecules that act over longer
distances. These short-range interactions can be attractive: the laminins in the
ECM partner with specific integrin proteins in the membrane of growth cones or
the cadherin family or immunoglobulin superfamily of cell surface proteins can
mediate cell–cell compatibility. They can also be repulsive; the gradient of ephrin
protein ligand expressed in the target inhibits growth cones expressing the corresponding eph kinases. In addition, the soluble proteins like netrin 1 that act at long
distances can have both attractive (if the growth cone expresses the DCC receptor) or repulsive (if it expresses receptors like unc-40) effects on axonal guidance.
Once axonal guidance leads to the appropriate target tissue, the process of
forming a functional connection or synapse can occur. This formation of
synapses, or synaptogenesis, is the key to the final step of cortical and nervous
system development, because it allows the information-processing circuit to
function. Once neurons are situated, synapse formation occurs when pre- and
postsynapse contact each other by molecular interaction between the two cells.
Neurologin then allows for the clustering of vesicles within the presynaptic
terminal (see Figure 17-1).

Answers
[17.1]

C. The telencephalon, which arises from the prosencephalon, is the
rostral-most swelling of the neural tube, and ultimately develops into
the cerebral cortex. The diencephalon becomes the thalamus, epithalamus, subthalamus, and hypothalamus, the mesencephalon becomes
the midbrain, and rhombencephalon becomes the pons, medulla, and
cerebellum.

[17.2]

D. In the process of axonal pathfinding, there are many different cues
that guide the axon to its ultimate destination such as attractive/
repulsive contact cues and attractive/repulsive diffusion gradient
cues. Since the axonal growth cone of each different type of neuron
expresses different receptor molecules, they all respond to the cues differently, allowing them all to reach their own appropriate target.

[17.3]

B. The correct order is that first the neurons are formed from precursor cells in the ventricular zone, then they migrate via one of several methods to their final location in the cortex. Following migration,
the neurons send out axonal growth cones that respond to attractive
and repulsive signals to reach the appropriate target, where they can
undergo synaptogenesis to mature the connection between presynaptic and postsynaptic cell.

CASE 18

An 18-year-old female, who is wheel-chair bound, states that since she was a
9-year-old girl, she began to suffer from an irregular, staggering gait with frequent falls. Over the next several years, her upper extremity coordination deteriorates. She later develops weakness during her teenage years. Physical
examination reveals abnormal eye movements, slow and poorly coordinated
movements of all her extremities, and severe weakness of her legs. She has
deficits in position sense, vibratory sense, pain, and tactile discrimination. Her
deep tendon reflexes are absent. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy was reported,
and she is subsequently diagnosed with Friedreich ataxia.

ANSWERS TO CASE 18: PROPRIOCEPTION
Summary: An 18 year old female has progressive ataxia, lower extremity weakness, loss of coordination of extremities and eye movements. Examination
reveals loss of position sense, vibratory sense, pain and tactile discrimination.
She is diagnosed with Friedreich ataxia.

◆

◆
◆

Mechanism: The degeneration of nerve tissue in the spinal cord and of
nerves that control muscle movement in the arms and legs is the ataxia
encountered in Friedreich ataxia. What results is the thinning of the
spinal cord, and the loss of myelin sheaths in many neurons. The
leading theory about the pathogenesis of the disease implicates an
overaccumulation of iron in mitochondria, leading to cellular damage
and death by the production of free radicals in neurons of the central
nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS).
Involved pathways: This disorder leads to progressive degeneration of the
dorsal root ganglia with secondary degeneration of the dorsal and ventral
spinocerebellar tracts, medial lemniscal system, spinothalamic tract, and
lateral cervical system. The corticospinal pathways are also affected.
Sensory modalities lost: The dorsal and ventral spinocerebellar tract
conveys proprioceptive, sense of balance and self, information from the
body to the cerebellum. The medial lemniscal system conveys somatic,
specialized touch, pressure, vibration, and joint receptors, and
proprioceptive information from the body to the cerebral cortex. The
spinothalamic tract conveys somatosensory information including
nociception (pain), temperature, itch, and crude touch to the thalamus.
The corticospinal tract conveys motor information from the cerebral
cortex of the brain to the spinal cord in response to information
generated from all different sensory pathways.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Friedreich ataxia is the most common of the recessively hereditary ataxias. This
disorder is characterized by a degeneration of neurons which begins in the periphery, with ultimate loss of neurons and a secondary scarring process, also known
as gliosis. Large myelinated axons in peripheral nerves are affected progressively
with age and duration of the disease. Unmyelinated fibers in sensory roots and
peripheral sensory nerves are spared. The posterior columns, corticospinal, ventral, and lateral spinocerebellar tracts are all affected by demyelination. The dorsal root ganglia shrink and eventually show disappearance of neurons. The
posterior column degeneration accounts for the loss of position and vibration
senses and the sensory ataxia. Absent tendon reflexes in the legs occur as a result
of loss of afferent fibers from muscle spindle receptors. The progressive degeneration of the corticospinal pathway leads to limb weakness. While research in
this area is progressing, there is currently no effective treatment available.

APPROACH TO PROPRIOCEPTION
Objectives
1.
2.

Be familiar with the CNS pathways that convey proprioceptive information.
Understand the clinical symptoms that result from a lesion to the dorsal column pathways.

Definitions
Kinesthesia: The sense of movement.
Astereognosis: Loss or impairment of the ability to recognize common
objects by touching or handling them without visual input.
Romberg test: A test in which the patient stands with feet placed closely
together and eyes closed. A positive test results if the body sways abnormally or there is loss of balance, indicating a deficiency in conscious
recognition of muscle and joint position.
Golgi tendon organ: A proprioceptive sensory receptor located in muscle
fibers and tendons.
Medial lemniscal system: The pathway carrying proprioceptive information to the cerebral cortex involving position sense, kinesthesia, and tactile discrimination.

DISCUSSION
Two sets of sensory pathways in the spinal cord provide important information
to the brain regarding muscle action, joint position, and the objects with which
a person is in contact. One of these sets of pathways projects to the cerebellum, where the information is processed for the coordination of movement, but
not for conscious perception. These pathways include the dorsal and ventral
spinocerebellar tracts, the cuneocerebellar tract, and the rostral spinocerebellar tract. The second set of pathways consists of three tracts that
project to the cerebral cortex by way of the thalamus. This information is perceived consciously. These are the spinal lemniscus, the spinothalamic tract,
and the lateral cervical system. Both sets of sensory receptors receive information from mechanoreceptors.
Mechanoreceptors located in the muscles, joints, and skin mediate the various separate and integrated sensations of proprioception, touch, and tactile
discrimination. Mechanoreceptors consist of Golgi tendon organs, pacinian
corpuscles, Meissner corpuscles, Ruffini corpuscles, Merkel complexes,
and free nerve endings in muscles, tendons, ligaments, joint capsules, and
skin. Information about static limb position is carried mainly through muscle
spindle afferents. Kinesthetic information is mediated by a combination of
joint receptor afferents and receptors in the skin, muscles, and joints.

142

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Pacinian corpuscles, found in the skin and connective tissue, detect vibration.
Meissner corpuscles detect superficial phasic touch. The movement of hairs is
detected by free nerve endings in hair follicles and also conveys a sense of
touch. Contrastingly, Ruffini corpuscles detect skin stretch. Merkel’s complexes are specialized epithelial cells that detect fine touch information. Most
of the mechanoreceptors are innervated by large-diameter myelinated fibers.
The free nerve endings are exceptions; as their cell bodies are located in the
dorsal root ganglia, and their central processes enter the medial side of the dorsal root zone. These nerve endings detect pain and temperature. Afferent fibers
from mechanoreceptors enter the spinal cord and distribute either to the
interneurons and motoneurons in the ventral horn, the neurons in the dorsal
and intermediate gray areas where ascending pathways originate, or to the
neurons of the dorsal column nuclei in the medulla (see Table 18-1).
The ventral and dorsal spinocerebellar tracts carry proprioceptive and other
somatosensory stimuli from the lower limbs to the cerebellum. Proprioceptive
sensation is the perception of the relative position of the parts of the body.
Unlike the other sensory systems that allow us to perceive the world outside
our body, proprioception provides feedback information about the body itself.
It consists of both static limb position and kinesthesia, or the sensation of
motion. Some proprioceptive fiber collaterals from Golgi tendon organs
synapse with neurons in the intermediate gray area and the base of the posterior horn of the spinal cord. At the lumbar and sacral levels of the spinal cord,
these neurons give rise to the primarily crossed ventral spinocerebellar tract.
This is the most peripheral tract in the ventral margin of the lateral funiculus.
The nucleus dorsalis, or Clarke nucleus, is located at the base of the posterior horn in spinal segments T1 through L2. This column of neurons receives
afferents from muscle spindles, cutaneous touch receptors, and joint receptors.
The axons of these neurons ascend rostrally and ipsilaterally as the dorsal

spinocerebellar tract just posterior to the ventral spinocerebellar tract in the
lateral funiculus. While the proprioceptive afferents traveling from dorsal roots
T1 to L2 synapse in the nucleus dorsalis at the level where they enter the spinal
cord, the corresponding afferents from dorsal roots L3 through S5 ascend first
in the fasciculus gracilis of the dorsal funiculus to reach the nucleus dorsalis.
They synapse there at levels L1 and L2, which becomes the most caudal level
of the dorsal spinocerebellar tract.
The cuneocerebellar tract and the rostral spinocerebellar tract carry information from mechanoreceptors in the upper extremities to the cerebellum.
Afferent fibers from C2 to T5 travel rostrally in the dorsal funiculus in the fasciculus cuneatus before synapsing on neurons in the accessory cuneate
nucleus in the lower medulla. This is the upper extremity counterpart of the
nucleus dorsalis and gives rise to the ipsilateral cuneocerebellar tract or dorsal arcuate fibers. This tract also mediated information from muscle spindles,
cutaneous touch receptors, and joint receptors.
The rostral spinocerebellar tract is the upper-extremity tract that corresponds to the ventral spinocerebellar tract. It originates in the cervical enlargement of the intermediate zone of the spinal cord gray area. After projecting to
the cerebellum, the tract synapses with fibers of the ventral spinocerebellar tract.
All of the ascending fibers from the dorsal spinocerebellar, cuneocerebellar, and rostral spinocerebellar pathways enter the cerebellum through the inferior cerebellar peduncle. The ventral spinocerebellar tract, however, travels
through the pons prior to entering the cerebellum through the superior cerebellar peduncle. These four tracts terminate primarily in the midline vermis
and intermediate zone of the cerebellum ipsilateral to the cells of origin. There
is also a significant projection to the anterior lobe and posterior lobe of the
cerebellum that contributes to standing and walking.
Proprioceptive information regarding position sense, kinesthesia, and tactile discrimination are carried to the cerebral cortex by afferent fibers from
muscle spindles, Golgi tendon organs, and mechanoreceptors in joints and
skin by way of the medial lemniscal system. This information contributes to
conscious position as well as movement sense. The posterior funiculus consists of two large bundles of fibers called fasciculi. Fibers from the leg ascend
as the fasciculus gracilis adjacent to the dorsal median septum. Fibers from
the arm ascend lateral to the leg fibers as the fasciculus cuneatus. The fibers
of the posterior funiculus maintain somatotopic organization in relation to one
another. The fasciculus cuneatus terminates in the lower medulla in the
nucleus cuneatus. Similarly, the fasciculus gracilis terminates in the nucleus
gracilis, also in the lower medulla. These tracts are frequently referred to as the
dorsal column pathways. A portion of the fibers of the medial lemniscal system travel with the lateral cervical system in the dorsal part of the lateral
funiculus. The dorsolateral pathway can also be used to describe the entire
lemniscal pathway of the spinal cord.
The cells of the dorsal column nuclei give rise to the internal arcuate fibers
which cross to the contralateral side of the medulla in the decussation of the

144

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

medial lemniscus. From here they ascend as the medial lemniscus to the thalamus and terminate in the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL). The somatotopic organization of the fibers is maintained in both the medial lemniscus
and VPL. Thalamocortical fibers from the VPL continue on to the postcentral
gyrus of the parietal lobe and terminate in the primary somatosensory cortex.
This cortex maintains a topographic representation of the body that is similar to
that of the parallel motor strip on the opposite side of the central sulcus.
The spinal lemniscus system mediates the sense of limb position and
movement, the sense of steady joint angles, the sense of motion produced by
active muscular contraction or passive movement, the sense of tension exerted
by contracting muscles, and the sense of effort. Cortical processing is necessary for the conscious recognition of body and limb posture. The lemniscal
pathways also provide important information regarding the place, intensity,
and temporal and spatial patterns of neural activity evoked by mechanical
stimulation of the skin. This same pathway to the cortex, therefore, is necessary for discriminative tactile sensation and vibration sense.
The lateral cervical system responds to light mechanical stimulation of the
skin on the ipsilateral side of the body. This system is an alternate pathway to
the information conveyed in the posterior column system, and its relevance in
humans is not fully understood. The peripheral nerve fibers synapse in the dorsal horn throughout the length of the spinal cord. Heavily myelinated axons
from second-order neurons arise in this lamina and ascend ipsilaterally in the
dorsal corner of the lateral funiculus to terminate in the lateral cervical
nucleus. Projections from this nucleus cross the spinal cord in the ventral
white commissure to join the contralateral medial lemniscus and proceed
with it to terminate in the thalamus. Information from here is projected to the
somatic sensory areas of the cerebral cortex.
A bilateral interruption of the dorsolateral pathway in the spinal cord
will result in complete loss of proprioceptive sensation. A lesion in this
location will produce deficits in position sense, vibration sense, and tactile
discrimination. A unilateral injury of a dorsolateral pathway will create
ipsilateral symptoms. Lesions within the gracile and cuneate nuclei, the
medial lemniscus, the thalamus, and the postcentral gyrus will create varying degrees of similar symptoms. A lesion of the lemniscal pathway preserve simple touch, pain, and temperature, but will disrupt proprioceptive
sensation and result in the following symptoms: inability to recognize limb
position, astereognosis or loss of ability to recognize common objects by
touching them with the eyes closed, loss of two-point discrimination, loss of
vibratory sense, a positive Romberg sign. In the Romberg test a patient
stands with feet close together. The amount of sway is noted with the eyes
open. The patient then closes the eyes and an abnormal increase in sway or
loss of balance without visual input results in a positive sign. The visual
system is able to partly compensate for the deficiency in recognition of
muscle and joint positions, allowing patients with dorsolateral pathway
lesions to maintain balance with their eyes open.

Answers

C. The sensation in question here, vibration, is transmitted via the
dorsal column/medial lemniscal pathway. The sensation is detected
by a pacinian corpuscle, which is innervated by a sensory neuron
whose body is in the dorsal root ganglion. This neuron’s axon enters
the cord via the dorsal horn, ascends the posterior column of the

146

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

spinal cord all the way to the lower medulla where it synapses in the
gracile nucleus (because it was from the lower body). From there the
second-order neuron sends its axons across the midline to ascend in
the contralateral medial lemniscus all the way to the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. From the thalamus the information is relayed to the sensory cortex where it is processed. In
addition to vibration, discriminative touch and joint proprioception
follow the same pathway. The lateral lemniscus is a tract in the brainstem involved in the relay of auditory information.
[18.2]

A. The sensory organ responsible for registering light touch is the
Meissner corpuscle. The pacinian corpuscle is responsible for registering vibration, the Golgi tendon organ measures muscle tension,
and the muscle spindle registers muscle fiber length. All of these
organs are part of the dorsal column/medial lemniscal system, and are
innervated by large diameter–myelinated nerve fibers.

[18.3]

B. In this scenario, the patient would lose proprioception in the
right leg. The dorsal columns transmit the signals for discriminative
touch, vibration, and proprioception. A lesion to one of these columns
will cause a loss of all of these sensations below the level of the lesion
on the ipsilateral side. The sensation loss will be ipsilateral because
the fibers of the pathway do not decussate until after they have
synapsed in the nuclei gracilis and cuneatus in the lower medulla.

hemicompression or hemisection of the spinal cord.

◆

Cause of the contralateral loss of pain and temperature
sensation: Injury to the spinothalamic tract will result in
contralateral pain and temperature loss from one or two levels below
the injury, and ipsilateral pain and temperature loss at the level of the
injury.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Brown-Sequard syndrome is a disorder that results from a hemi-injury to the
spinal cord. Three main neural systems are affected, producing the resulting
symptoms: the disruption of the corticospinal tract carrying the upper motor
neurons produces a spastic paralysis on the same side of the body; loss of
one or both dorsal columns will result in an ipsilateral loss of vibration and
proprioception, and loss of the spinothalamic tract leads to pain and temperature sensation being lost from the contralateral side of the body. The deficit
begins one or two segments below the lesion and all sensory modalities are
lost on the ipsilateral side at the level of the lesion because of the fibers still
being uncrossed. While this syndrome is usually the result of penetrating
traumatic injury to the spinal cord, rarely it can be caused by a herniated cervical disc. In this case, surgical intervention to decompress the disc would
be indicated.

Definitions
Anterolateral system: The ascending pathway that conveys pain and temperature from the periphery to the brain.
Dermatome: An area of the skin which innervates afferent nerve fibers
coming to a single dorsal spinal root.
Nociceptors: A sensory receptor that sends signals that cause the perception of pain in response to potentially damaging stimuli.
Reticular formation: The network of neurons in the brainstem involved in
consciousness, regulation of breathing, and transmission of sensory
stimuli to higher brain centers.
Spinoreticular tracts: The fibers of the anterolateral system that do not
reach the thalamus directly, instead synapsing first in the reticular formation before ascending to the thalamic nuclei, hypothalamus, and limbic system.

DISCUSSION
The anterolateral system is comprised of the spinothalamic tracts and the
spinoreticular tracts, which do not reach the thalamus and cannot therefore be
termed spinothalamic. These pathways mediate the sensations of pain, itching,
temperature, and simple touch (see Figure 19-1). Neurons of the anterolateral

system originate in the contralateral dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Most of
their axons cross the midline through the ventral white commissure before
ascending in the spinal cord to give rise to a diffuse bundle of fibers projecting
through the anterior and lateral funiculi. The originating neurons in the dorsal
horn are activated by small-diameter, lightly myelinated and unmyelinated dorsal root afferents, including Aδ(III) and C(IV) fibers, as well as larger myelinated cutaneous afferents. Aδ fibers, because of a faster conduction velocity,
convey sharp pricking pain and the C fibers convey dull aching pain.
A dermatome is the area of skin supplied by one dorsal root. The dorsal
roots convey information from essentially all dermatomes below the face. The
cell bodies of the dorsal root fibers are located in the dorsal root ganglia.
Each ganglion cell possesses a single nerve process that divides into a central
branch running to the spinal cord and a peripheral branch coming from a
receptor organ or organs. The dorsal root fibers enter the spinal cord through
the dorsal root entry zone in the region of the dorsolateral sulcus. The Aα and
Aβ fibers are the most heavily myelinated and occupy the most medial position in this entry zone, while the small myelinated Aδ and unmyelinated C
fibers occupy the most lateral position.
The peripheral pain receptors consist of the naked terminals of the small Aδ
and C nerve fibers. Many of these are specialized chemoreceptors that are
stimulated by tissue substances released in response to noxious and inflammatory stimuli such as histamine, bradykinin, serotonin, acetylcholine, substance P, potassium, and cyclooxygenases. The concentration of the hydrogen
ion in these substances has been found to be critical in the activation of pain
receptors. A stimulus that evokes pain is usually one that can cause damage or
destruction to tissue.
As the axons of the Aδ and C fibers enter the dorsal root zone, they immediately divide into short ascending and descending branches that run longitudinally in the posterolateral fasciculus, or Lissauer tract. After traveling one or
two segments, these fibers leave the tract to synapse with neurons in laminae IV in the dorsal horn. These neurons contain receptors for numerous neurotransmitters, such as excitatory amino acids and neuropeptides. The Aδ and C
fibers release glutamate and substance P at their neurotransmitters.
Interneurons in laminae II through IV project to the neurons in laminae V where
they synapse with the cells of origin of the anterolateral system, including the
spinothalamic tracts and the spinoreticular projections. Neurons in lamina I
contribute fibers to the spinothalamic tracts.
The axons of the spinothalamic tract from laminae I and V of the dorsal
horn decussate anterior to the central canal in the ventral white commissure
and then ascend rostrally in the anterolateral funiculus. The spinothalamic
and spinoreticular tracts ascend through the spinal cord and brain stem and
supply information to other spinal cord segments, to the reticular formation,
the superior colliculus, and to several thalamic nuclei, including the
intralaminar nuclei and the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL). The
VPL transmits information from the spinothalamic pathway to the lemniscal

CLINICAL CASES

151

system through the ventrobasal complex. Projections of the anterolateral
system to the VPL are carried somatotopically, and fibers carrying input from
the upper body are located medially to those carrying input from the lower
body. This somatotopic organization is maintained as fibers project from the
VPL, conveying painful and thermal sensations to the primary somatosensory cortex of the postcentral gyrus. VPL axons end in the primary
somatosensory cortex and provide information for accurate localization of
sharp pricking pain. The fibers from the upper parts of the body project to
cortical areas near the lateral fissure, while those from the lower parts terminate on the medial surface of the hemisphere in the paracentral lobule. The
postcentral gyrus is interconnected with the posterior parietal lobe. These
areas function together to localize pain stimuli and integrate the pain modality with other sensory stimuli.
The anterolateral system is a predominantly slow conducting, polysynaptic system. The fibers that do not reach the thalamus directly synapse in the
reticular formation of the brain stem. These are the spinoreticular tracts.
From the reticular formation, ascending fibers relay pain information to the
medial and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus as well as to the hypothalamus and limbic system. Additionally, the intralaminar nuclei project information to multiple cortical areas to ensure that pain is not lost when there is
damage to the primary somatosensory cortex. While most fibers of the
anterolateral system cross the midline before ascending, many of the fibers
of the spinoreticular tracts conveying visceral sensory information ascend
ipsilaterally.
Painful sensations from the face, cornea, sinuses, and mucosal linings travel
through fibers of the trigeminal nerve to its sensory trigeminal ganglion.
After these fibers enter the brain stem in the pontine region, they form an ipsilateral descending tract, the spinal tract of V, which courses to the upper cervical segments of the spinal cord. The neurons synapse in the spinal nucleus
of V (spinal trigeminal nucleus), and from there they decussate and form the
ventral trigeminal lemniscus which joins with the crossed main sensory
trigeminal efferents, and ascends to the ventral posteromedial nucleus
(VPM). In this way, information from the spinal nucleus of V projects to the
contralateral side and ascends to the VPM of the thalamus. The ascending
trigeminal pathway also projects to the reticular formation and the medial and
intralaminar thalamic nuclei, which also receive projections from the anterolateral system of the spinal cord. The VPM projects to the somatosensory cortex closest to the lateral fissure. The areas of the body most sensitive to
somatosensory stimuli, the lips and fingers, have disproportionately large
areas of neuronal representation in the somatosensory cortex. Thalamocortical
fibers from neurons in the intralaminar thalamic nuclei and parts of the VPL
and VPM nuclei relay pain information to the secondary somatic sensory
area of the cerebral cortex.
This tract has also been known to respond to temperature. Naked nerve
endings in the skin carry sensations of cold and warmth. The peripheral

152

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

nerve fibers mediating these sensations consist of thinly myelinated Aδ and
some C fibers. Other types of C fibers mediated the painful components of
the extremes of hot and cold sensations. The central nervous system pathway from thermal sensation follows the same course as the pain pathway.
These two systems are so closely associated in the central nervous system
that they cannot be distinguished anatomically, and injury to one usually
affects the other.
The lateral spinothalamic tract can be purposefully transected in the
spinal cord in an attempt to relieve intractable pain. This procedure, known
as a tractotomy, is performed by making a cut in the anterior part of the lateral funiculus. There is usually some damage to the ventral spinocerebellar
tract and possibly to some of the extrapyramidal motor fibers. No permanent symptoms, however, are typically seen aside from a loss of pain sensitivity on the contralateral side which begins one or two segments below the
cut. The pain relief is sometimes only temporary, suggesting other routes in
crossed and uncrossed tracts that mediate nociceptive sensations in the
spinal cord.

A 72-year-old man comes into the emergency department complaining
of vertigo, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and a droopy left eyelid.
On examination you note a loss of painful sensation over the left half
of his face and the entire right half of his body. Interestingly, however,
he has intact discriminative touch in those areas. His history in remarkable for 60 pack years of smoking and poorly controlled high blood
pressure. What is the most likely location of the lesion in this man?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Lower cervical spinal cord
Medulla
Thalamus
Cerebral cortex

Answers
[19.1]

C. The “receptor cells” involved in the detection of pain are not discreet
sensory organs, as they are for discriminative touch and proprioception,
but rather the free nerve endings of the first-order neurons in the pain
pathway. These neurons are unmyelinated, or very slightly myelinated,
as opposed to the neurons innervating touch receptors, which are heavily myelinated. The free nerve endings of pain fibers respond to a variety of chemical stimuli, including potassium ions, serotonin, histamine,
and bradykinin. There are also free nerve endings that respond to physical deformation (stretch-sensitive pain fibers).

[19.2]

B. This boy has a lesion on his face, so the pain sensation is traveling
through the spinal trigeminal tract, and the thalamic relay for this
tract (and all localized sensation for the face) is VPM, which projects
to the face area of the primary sensory cortex. Had this been a lesion
on the trunk or extremities, then the pathway would have been the
spinothalamic pathway, which (like all localized sensation on the
trunk and extremities) is relayed through VPL. It is true that CM and
PF, which are also known as the intralaminar nuclei, are involved in
the sensation of pain, but they relay more diffuse, emotional, poorly
localized pain to diffuse areas of the cortex.

[19.3]

C. The cell bodies of pain-sensing fibers are located in the dorsal
root ganglia, just like the cell bodies of touch and proprioception
neurons. Unlike touch neurons, however, the axons of pain neurons
do not ascend the spinal cord all the way to level of the brainstem.
They synapse with second-order neurons of the pain pathway in the
dorsal horn of the spinal cord at or one to two spinal levels above
where the fibers enter the cord.

[19.4]

B. This man is experiencing what is known as Wallenberg syndrome,
and is caused by a lesion in the lateral medulla. Often, this lesion
results from occlusion of the posterior inferior cerebellar artery
(PICA), which supplies this region. The sensory symptoms are

154

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

explained by the fact that the spinal trigeminal tract descends from
the sensory trigeminal ganglion to the spinal trigeminal nucleus in the
ipsilateral lower medulla and upper cervical spine. The descending
spinal trigeminal neurons (carrying pain from the ipsilateral face) are
near the ascending spinothalamic tract (carrying pain from the contralateral body), and both of these tracts are supplied by the PICA, so
both are damaged. The medial lemniscus is not in the same region, so
not damaged by an occlusion of PICA, accounting for the preservation of discriminative touch. A lesion in the lower cervical cord
would not affect the face as this is below the level of the spinal
trigeminal nucleus, and lesions of the thalamus and cortex would
affect the body and face on the same side.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20: NOCICEPTION
Summary: A 75-year-old man has right chest wall, side, and back numbness
and tingling that progresses to severe, sharp, burning pain. The corresponding
area is red with fluid-filled vesicles. The affected area is sharply demarcated
by dermatomal borders.

◆

◆

Receptors: Nocireceptors
Factors: Substance P, Histamine, and K+ are released after tissue
damage or injury and activate the nocireceptors.
Available treatment options: While there is no cure for herpes zoster,
antiviral medications such as acyclovir can be effective in moderating
the progress of symptoms, or can be taken prophylactically by those at
high risk of developing the disease. A vaccine is now available to those
who have never had a primary infection of the virus.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Herpes zoster is a viral disease causing inflammation of the dorsal root ganglia along with severe pain and cutaneous eruption in the dermatomal distribution of the ganglion cells. The disease is caused by the varicella-zoster virus,
which causes chickenpox during the first infection. The virus becomes latent
in the dorsal root ganglion cells, and can reactivate later in life, frequently in
people who are immunosuppressed. The severe pain results from the spread of
the virus along the peripheral nerve fibers and the inflammation of neurons in
the dorsal root ganglia that convey pain sensation.

Radicular pain: Pain distributed over an area that is consistent with the

Phantom pain: Pain that is felt in a part of the body that either no longer
exists because of amputation or is insensate caused by nerve severance.

DISCUSSION
Pain is an unpleasant sensation that occurs in response to either an externally
perceived event or an internal cognitive event. This unpleasant sensory and
emotional perception associated with actual or potential tissue damage is to
warn of avoidable or treatable injury. The sensations we describe as painful
include pricking, burning, aching, stinging, and soreness. There are several
aspects to pain which include a distinctive sensation, the individual’s reaction
to this sensation, activity in both somatic and autonomic systems, and both
reflex and volitional efforts of avoidance or escape.
Three types of pain sensation occur after an acute noxious event. Fast pain
consists of a sharp, pricking sensation that can be localized accurately and
results from activations of Aδ-myelinated fibers. Slow pain is a burning sensation that has a slower onset, greater persistence, a less clear location, and
results from activation of unmyelinated C fibers. Slow pain runs through
archispinothalamic and paleospinothalamic tracts, while fast pain runs through
the neospinothalamic tract. Deep or visceral pain can be described as aching,
burning, or cramping. Visceral pain results from stimulation of visceral and
deep somatic receptors as in joints or muscles. Visceral receptors are innervated by both unmyelinated C fibers and myelinated Aδ fibers that pass
through the sympathetic nerves. The cell bodies of both these fibers are located
in the dorsal root ganglia.
The spinothalamic pathway, projecting to the VPL of the thalamus and
from there to the primary somatosensory cortex, is essential for the spatial and
temporal discrimination of painful stimuli. The spinoreticular pathways
which connect to the secondary somatosensory cortex, hypothalamus, and limbic system, mediate systemic autonomic responses to pain and probably the
emotional and affective responses as well. The cingulated cortex is one of the
limbic areas activated by pain.
The cerebral cortex is an important component to the processing of pain.
Patients who have suffered complete destruction of the somatosensory areas of
the cerebral cortex on one side of the brain may still detect painful stimuli on
the contralateral side of the body as long as the thalamus and lower structures
of the pain pathway remain intact. Intractable pain can be relieved by destruction of the posterior and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus. A prefrontal
leukotomy transects the fibers linking the dorsomedial and anterior nuclei of
the thalamus with the frontal lobe and anterior cingulated cortex, and can
diminish the anguish of constant pain by changing the psychological response

158

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

to painful stimuli. This lesion, however, is also accompanied by negative
changes in personality and intellectual capacity. A cingulotomy, or bilateral
section of the cingulum bundle, has been shown to relieve a patient’s reaction
to pain without causing the drastic personality changes that occur with prefrontal leukotomy.
There are no pain receptors in the parenchyma of the internal organs,
including the brain. The pain receptors are found within the walls of arteries, the peritoneal surfaces, pleural membranes, and the dura mater covering
the brain. All of these structures can respond to inflammation or mechanical
deformation with severe pain. Any abnormal contraction or dilatation of a
wall of a hollow viscus, such as a blood vessel, also causes pain. The pain
fibers from the viscera project to the spinal cord as components of the sympathetic nerves, while fibers conveying nonpainful visceral sensations project to the central nervous system as components of the parasympathetic
nerves.
The afferent pathway of visceral pain receptors follows the peripheral
sympathetic nerves from the viscera to the sympathetic trunk. Here they pass
to the thoracic and lumbar spinal nerves over the white rami and enter the
spinal cord. Their cell bodies are located in the dorsal root ganglia of segments T1 to L2, and their axons terminate at synapses in the dorsal horn of
the intermediate gray matter. These nuclei project axons bilaterally through
the anterolateral system to the brain stem reticular formation, intralaminar
thalamic nuclei, and hypothalamus. Some visceral pain is also mediated by
neurons from the deep central spinal gray matter whose axons ascend in the
dorsal midline with the dorsal columns. These fibers terminate on neurons in
the nuclei of the dorsal columns which then project to the ventral posterior
thalamus.
Pain originating from the viscera tends to be vaguely localized. It may
even be perceived in a surface area of the body far away from its actual
source. This phenomenon is known as referred pain. A common example of
referred pain occurs with pain of coronary heart disease, which may be felt in
the chest wall, the left axilla, or down the inside of the left arm. Inflammation
of the peritoneum covering the diaphragm may be felt over the shoulder. This
occurs because the peripheral afferents that supply the skin area of the
referred pain enter the same segment of the spinal cord as the visceral afferents conducting pain from the affected organ. Visceral sensory fibers discharge into the same pool of neurons in the spinal cord as fibers from the skin,
and an abundance of impulses results in misinterpretation of the true origin of
the pain. Noxious stimuli affecting deep somatic structures can result in
referred pain as well.
Radicular pain is pain distributed over an area that is consistent with the
boundaries of a dermatome. Mechanical compression or local inflammation
of dorsal nerve roots can irritate pain fibers and produce pain along the dermatomal distribution of the affected root. Sensory changes other than pain

may be associated with dorsal root irritation. Localized areas of spontaneous prickling, tingling, or numbness are termed paresthesias. Zones of
hyperesthesia may be present in which tactile stimuli are grossly exaggerated. If the pathologic process progresses to the point of destroying the
nerve fibers, the dorsal roots will eventually lose their ability to conduct
sensory impulses, resulting in hypesthesia or anesthesia. The majority of
skin areas receive innervation from fibers from more than one dorsal root,
therefore, damage to a single dorsal root usually does not cause complete
sensory loss (see Figure 20-1).
Endogenous analgesia is an important component to understand in the
treatment of pain. Stimulation of areas along the medial periventricular and
periaqueductal axis, including the midline raphe nuclei of the brain stem,
has been shown to produce analgesia. The raphe nuclei, found throughout
the brain stem, are populated with neurons that produce serotonin. The
axons of the caudal raphe nuclei descend to the spinal cord through the
dorsolateral fasciculus. These axons terminate in the dorsal horn, where
they attenuate the responses of spinothalamic cells to spinal nerve afferents
mediating noxious stimuli from nociceptors. The release of opioid peptides
is thought to primarily mediate endogenous analgesia. Other neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine can also have analgesic effects. The three families of opioid receptors include enkephalin,
β-endorphin, and dynorphin. Enkephalin interneurons are found in laminae
I through III of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Inputs from descending
serotonergic and noradrenergic fibers activate these interneurons and inhibit
transmission of painful sensations at the first synaptic connection in the pain
pathway.

D. This is an example of referred pain. The patient feels pain in his
arm, but there is in fact no pathology affecting his arm. Instead,
there is pathology affecting his heart, which is innervated by nerves
from the same spinal levels as those innervating the arm. The afferent pain signal actually originating from the heart is erroneously
interpreted as coming from the arm, resulting in referred pain.
Central pain arises from a lesion in the thalamus or cortex that is
interpreted as pain in the body part corresponding to the lesion.
Phantom pain is “felt” in amputated limbs, and radicular pain is

pain in the distribution of a spinal cord level caused by compression
of the corresponding nerve root.
[20.2]

C. Referred pain occurs when pain of visceral origin is localized
to a part of the body far removed from the source. Inflammation of
the pleura can frequently be referred to the thoracic dermatomes of
the back.

B. Morphine and other opioid pain medications decrease pain by
modulating the brain and spinal cord’s response to painful stimuli.
These molecules bind to receptor sites for endogenous opioids which
are located in diffuse areas of the CNS, including in the brain and
spinal cord. In the spinal cord, binding to opioid receptors modulates
the response of second- and third-order neurons in the pain pathway
to painful stimuli coming in from the periphery. Opioid receptors in
the brainstem activate descending tracts that further modulate pain
transmission in the spinal cord. Through poorly understood mechanisms, opiates also result in altering the perception of pain, that is, the
sensation of pain is still there, but it is not as debilitating

Three types of pain sensations occur after an acute noxious event:
(1) fast pain, (2) slow pain, and (3) visceral pain.
Fast pain is an accurately localizable, immediate, sharp sensation
resulting from activation of myelinated Aδ fibers.
Slow pain is a vaguely localizable, burning pain resulting from activation of unmyelinated C fibers.
Visceral pain is an aching pain resulting from stimulation of deep
somatic receptors in joints or muscles which are innervated by
both C and Aδ fibers.
Stimulation of areas along the medial periventricular and periaqueductal axis has been shown to produce analgesia.

ANSWERS TO CASE 21: OLFACTION
Summary: A 22-year-old male with a history of a closed head injury following
a motorcycle accident. After a period of neurological recovery, the patient notes
an inability to smell. Neuroimaging reveals posttraumatic changes in the paramedian frontal lobes, which is in the region of the olfactory bulbs and tracts.

◆

Mechanism of posttraumatic olfactory dysfunction: Posttraumatic
olfactory dysfunction may be caused by a shearing injury of the
olfactory nerve filaments, or by brain contusion and hemorrhage within
the olfactory brain regions.

◆

Bony anatomic site: The cribriform plate of the naso-orbito-ethmoid
region is commonly affected in this case.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Posttraumatic anosmia is a common finding in patients that have suffered head
injuries. The axons of olfactory receptor cells are delicate and pass through small
foramina of the cribriform plate at the base of the skull and synapse directly in the
olfactory bulb. Any tearing or shearing of the axons during the trauma can result
in olfactory dysfunction. It may occur with fractures of the naso-orbito-ethmoid
region, involving the cribriform plate, or with rapid translational shifts in the brain
secondary to coup or contracoup forces generated by blunt head trauma. Head
trauma often results in traumatic brain injury in the form of cortical contusion or
intraparenchymal hemorrhage. Contusion of the olfactory bulbs or cortical lesions
at the olfactory brain regions (amygdala, temporal lobe region, frontal lobe region)
can lead to posttraumatic anosmia. The treatment is expectant observation.

Know the anatomic structures involved in the olfactory system.
Be familiar with the cortical areas involved in olfactory associations.
Be able to name and describe some of the etiologies of olfactory
dysfunction.

Definitions
Mitral cells: Second-order neurons of the olfactory system. They receive
information from olfactory receptor neurons through synapses in the
olfactory bulb, their axons project as the olfactory tract.
Entorhinal cortex: An important memory center of the brain located in the
medial temporal lobe. Mitral cells project to this region of the cortex and
are thought to contribute to emotional associations with olfaction.

CLINICAL CASES

165

Anosmia: Absence of the sense of smell.
Hyperosmia: Abnormally acute smell function.
Olfactory agnosia: Inability to recognize an odor sensation.
Dysosmia: Distorted smell perception.

DISCUSSION
Olfaction allows us to detect and discriminate between a great variety of odors
within our environment. The olfactory system consists of several elements of
the central nervous system: the olfactory nerves, bulbs, and tracts, the olfactory tubercle, the primary olfactory cortex, the entorhinal cortex of the
parahippocampal gyrus, and the amygdala. The functions of this system
include distinguishing isolated odors from other background odors, determining the concentration of the odor and being able to identify it at different concentrations, creating a representation of the odor, and pairing the odor with an
associated memory. For many other species, olfaction is important for locating
food and communication.
Olfactory stimuli are sensed by specialized peripheral olfactory receptors
in a part of the nasal mucosa called the olfactory epithelium. This specialized tissue consists of pseudostratified columnar olfactory epithelium
located on the superior concha, the roof of the nasal chamber, and the upper
portion of the nasal septum. The receptor cells are bipolar neurons with
cilia at their dendritic endings in the olfactory epithelium. Interestingly,
olfactory neurons are the only special sensory receptors that are the nerve
itself. The molecules that are smelled or tasted alter the membrane potential
of the receptors through ligand-receptor-mediated second messenger
mechanisms that result in ion channel openings in the ciliary membrane.
There are more than 1000 different receptor proteins in the olfactory cilia,
with each neuron expressing a single receptor. Olfactory neurons are also
unique in that they are short-lived neurons with an average life span of
30-60 days (see Figure 21-1). Aside from perceiving and distinguishing
odors, they contribute to the sensation of taste.
The ability to discriminate between different odorants is the result of differential expression of the receptor proteins in receptor cells across the surface
of the mucosa, combined with selective convergence of axons from functionally related receptor cells to target cells in the olfactory bulb. These axons are
grouped into fascicles before passing through the cribriform plate as the olfactory nerve. The olfactory axons terminate in the olfactory bulb in what are
called the glomeruli. The olfactory bulbs, which rest on the cribriform plates,
contain several types of neurons, including inhibitory interneurons and mitral
cells. The mitral cells receive direct synaptic input from olfactory nerve fibers
and project their axons in the lateral olfactory tract. Each mitral cell receives
input from olfactory nerves expressing the same odorant receptor. Inhibitory
interneurons also form synapses with mitral cell dendrites and inhibit mitral
cells from surrounding glomeruli, producing lateral inhibition.

The anterior olfactory nucleus is located in the olfactory stalk and contains
groups of neurons. The olfactory portion of the anterior commissure originates in
the olfactory stalk as one of these groups. Information from the ipsilateral olfactory bulb is received and transmitted to the contralateral olfactory bulb by way of
the anterior commissure through this group of neurons. The olfactory stalk is
positioned in the olfactory sulcus of the frontal lobe, directly lateral to the gyrus
rectus of the orbitofrontal cortex. The olfactory tract bifurcates here into medial
and lateral striae. A portion of the fibers in the medial olfactory stria contain the
axons of the anterior olfactory nucleus neurons which cross the anterior commissure to the contralateral olfactory bulb. The remaining fibers consist of the mitral
cell axons and terminate in the ipsilateral olfactory tubercle within the anterior
perforated substance. Mitral cell axons only project ipsilaterally.

CLINICAL CASES

167

The lateral stria, or lateral olfactory tract, consists primarily of mitral cell
axons and projects to the lateral margin of the anterior perforated substance,
the piriform cortex, a small rostral portion of the entorhinal cortex, and the
corticomedial amygdala. This pattern distinguishes the olfactory system as
being the only sensory system in which second-order neurons (the mitral cells)
project directly to cerebral cortex, and not the thalamus.
The primary olfactory cortex, or piriform cortex, is the key region involved
in the conscious perception of smell. Lesions in this region have been shown to
result in failure to discriminate between various odorants. The piriform cortex is
also unique in that it consists of a three-layered cortex, making it phylogenetically older than the six-layered cortex of the visual, auditory, and somatosensory
systems. The olfactory cortex has reciprocal thalamocortical connections used
for discriminative functions. Projections travel directly from the primary olfactory cortex to the lateral orbitofrontal cortex and indirectly through the magnocellular portion of the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus. Other
communications important in olfactory discrimination include cortococortical
connections between the temporal pose and the orbitofrontal cortex.
Olfactory impulses that reach the corticomedial amygdala are important in
many species for the control of social behaviors. In humans, however, the behavioral significance of olfactory projections to the amygdalae has not been clarified.
The function of the olfactory input to the hippocampus through the entorhinal
cortex is also unclear. These pathways, however, are thought to integrate olfactory information with visual, auditory, and somatosensory impulses arriving
from other association cortices. Through connections with the amygdala, the
hippocampus is thought to participate in the integration of multisensory inputs
into appropriate emotional and physiological responses to external stimuli.
This may contribute to developing emotional responses to specific odors.
Anosmia, the loss of sense of smell, can result from several etiologies.
Traumatic injuries that injure the frontal lobes can affect the primary olfactory
cortex. Fractures of the cribriform plate can result in injury to the olfactory bulbs
or tracts. Infections such as the common cold, viral hepatitis, syphilis, bacterial
meningitis, cerebral abscesses, or osteomyelitis of the frontal or ethmoid regions
can also injure the olfactory system. The most frequent cause of smell loss in
adults is an upper respiratory tract infection (URI). The URI is often severe, and
the smell loss is most commonly partial. Direct insult to the olfactory neuroepithelium is the primary basis of the problem. Viruses can cause edema and hyperemia of nasal membranes, necrosis of cilia, and cellular destruction. And they can
produce varying degrees of destruction. Biopsy studies of olfactory epithelia from
patients with post-URI anosmia showed greatly reduced numbers of olfactory
receptors. The injury can be followed by resolution of infection and regeneration.
Anosmia results when there is lack of regeneration secondary to severe destruction of the epithelium. If there is patchy destruction, patients may have hyposmia.
If the regeneration of receptor neurons and their central attachments are “misguided” to reach abnormal locations in the brain, patients may experience dysosmia, or distorted smell. In addition to direct insults, many viruses can invade the

168

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

CNS via the olfactory neuroepithelium to cause subsequent dysfunction. No
effective treatment has been found for post-URI hyposmia. Even though spontaneous recovery in some patients is theoretically possible, meaningful recovery is
rare when marked loss has been present for a period of time. Less common causes
of anosmia include olfactory groove meningiomas, frontal lobe gliomas, metabolic diseases, amphetamine or cocaine use, and Parkinson and Alzheimer disease. A complete anosmia will result in the ability to recognize flavors as the
olfactory and taste systems function together in the perception of flavors.
Hyperosmia, an increase in olfactory sensitivity, frequently occurs in early pregnancy and can also occur in conversion disorders and some psychoses.

having simple partial seizures, and order an EEG. An abnormal discharge in which brain region would confirm your findings?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Occipital lobe
Superior parietal lobe
Medial temporal lobe
Anterolateral frontal lobe

CLINICAL CASES

Answers
[21.1]

C. As the olfactory neurons pass through the tiny holes in the cribriform plate, they are susceptible to injury, as occurred in this case.
Olfactory neurons are small, bipolar neurons that run only a very
short way from the olfactory epithelium of the superior nasal cavity
through the cribriform plate to the olfactory bulb in the olfactory
groove of the frontal lobe. Depending on the degree of damage to the
olfactory epithelium and the cribriform plate, the neurons may be
able to regenerate, resulting in a return of smell.

[21.2]

B. Although there are thousands of odorant receptors expressed in
humans, each olfactory neuron expresses only one odorant receptor. The neurons expressing the same receptor project through the
cribriform plate and synapse on mitral cells in the olfactory bulb.
Each mitral cell receives input from neurons expressing the same
odorant. Mitral cells then project their axons down the olfactory tract
directly to the olfactory cortex. The neurons in the olfactory epithelium have a lifespan of only several months, after which time they die
and are replaced by new olfactory neurons derived form the basal cell
layer of the olfactory epithelium.

[21.3]

C. The olfactory cortex, made up of the piriform cortex and the periamygdaloid cortex is located on the medial aspect of the temporal
lobe. Abnormal EEG readings from this area during the experience
of an abnormal smell would confirm that seizure discharge is
responsible for this woman’s symptoms. The occipital lobe houses
the primary visual cortex; discharge here would result in abnormal
vision. The superior parietal lobe contains the primary sensory cortex, and a discharge here would result in abnormal sensation. The
anterolateral frontal lobe is not a sensory area, but is involved in
executive function.

CASE 22

A 25-year-old woman has been having difficulty for several months understanding what people are saying over the phone when she holds the receiver to
her left ear. She has no problem with her right ear, and no other symptoms. On
examination, when a vibrating tuning fork is placed in the center of her forehead, she hears the sound louder in her right ear than in her left ear. The base
of a vibrating tuning fork is then placed on her left mastoid process. When she
is no longer able to hear the sound through the bone, the vibrating tuning fork
is held close to her left ear. She is still able to hear the vibrating tuning fork in
the air after she can no longer hear it on bone. Based on the examination findings and further workup, the patient is diagnosed with an acoustic neuroma.

Based on the examination findings, is the hearing loss more likely to
be conductive or sensorineural in nature?
What are other possible diagnoses?

ANSWERS TO CASE 22: AUDITION
Summary: A 25-year-old woman with several month history of left-sided hearing loss.

◆

◆

Interpretation of examination findings: The Weber test indicates a
sensorineural etiology for the patient’s hearing loss. The Rinne test is
not suggestive of a conductive hearing loss. Both of these findings are
consistent with the diagnosis of an acoustic neuroma, which affects the
eighth cranial nerve.
Other possible diagnoses: Sensorineural hearing loss can be caused
by a variety of etiologies in addition to a tumor involving the eighth
cranial nerve or the cerebellopontine angle. Drugs such as
aminoglycosides and salicylates can have toxic side effects to the hair
cells of the cochlea. Infectious, immune-mediated, or traumatic nerve
injury can also lead to hearing deficits similar to those that the
patient exhibits.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
The Weber test is performed by holding the tuning fork to the center of her
forehead. Normally, the sound is heard in the midline. In air conduction hearing loss, the sound is lateralized toward the abnormal side. In sensorineural
hearing loss, the sound is lateralized away from the abnormal side. This
patient’s examination lateralized away from her abnormal side. The Rinne test
was performed by comparing bone with air conduction on the affected side.
Normally, hearing by air conduction will continue after bone conduction
ceases. A person with conductive hearing loss will hear bone conduction better
than air conduction. This patient was able to hear air conduction after the bone
conduction had ceased. An MRI was obtained which revealed an acoustic neuroma of the left eighth cranial nerve localized at the cerebellopontine angle.
The capture and interpretation of sound is a key element used in communication and interpretation of our surroundings. Sound waves travel through
the external auditory canal where they are translated into mechanical energy
through the middle ear. Auditory information is then transmitted to the inner,
fluid-filled ear where it is detected and organized tonotopically by the hair
cells of the cochlea. This information is then transmitted through the cochlear
nerve to the brain stem and auditory cortex, where the information is
processed and interpreted. An acoustic neuroma impairs the ability of the
cochlear nerve to function properly, resulting in a sensorineural hearing loss.
Other types of hearing loss can be congenital or acquired, and can be because
of conductive or sensorineural etiologies. The ability to communicate and
interact socially can be significantly impaired with diminished or absent hearing. Treatment options for acoustic neuromas include surgical resection
stereotactic radiosurgery.

APPROACH TO AUDITION
Objectives
1.
2.
3.

Understand the basic anatomic structures involved in audition.
Review the central auditory pathways.
Be familiar with the diagnostic tests used to differentiate between conductive and sensorineural hearing loss.

Definitions
Hertz: A unit of frequency equal to one cycle of a wave per second. The
frequency of a sound wave determines the pitch of the sound.
Decibels: The unit for measuring the amplitude of a sound wave. The
amplitude determines the loudness of a sound.
Oval window: Oval opening in the cochlea which separates the air-filled
middle ear from the fluid-filled inner ear cavity. Vibrations of the stapes
bone against the oval window transmit sound to the inner ear.
Round window: Round opening in the cochlea connecting the inner ear to
the middle ear. Movement of the membrane covering the round window
allows for sound waves to be dissipated into the air-filled middle ear.
Sensorineural hearing loss: Partial or complete deafness that occurs as
a result of injury to the cochlear nerve or the sensory structures of the
inner ear.
Conductive hearing loss: Partial or complete deafness that occurs as a
result of disruption of auditory conduction through the bones of the middle ear or mechanical obstruction of the external ear.

DISCUSSION
The structures of the auditory system can be divided into three components:
the external, middle, and inner ear. The external ear consists of the auricle and
external auditory canal, and is separated from the middle ear by the tympanic
membrane. The middle ear is filled with air and contains three bony ossicles:
the malleus, incus and stapes. The malleus attaches to the tympanic membrane, and the stapes attaches to the oval window through a ligamentous
membrane. The oval window separates the middle ear cavity from the inner
ear space, which is filled with fluid. Sound waves traveling through air strike
the tympanic membrane and create motion which is conveyed through the
ossicles to the oval window. This chain of ossicles functions not only as an
amplifier, but as an impedance matcher as well. The impedance of the tympanic membrane is matched to the higher impedance of the oval window, thus
decreasing energy lost as the sound waves travel from air to fluid. Sound consists of sinusoidal waves of air molecules. The frequency of a wave is measured in hertz (Hz) and determines the pitch of a sound. The amplitude of a

174

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

wave is measured in decibels (dB) and determines the loudness of a sound.
The human ear can detect sound frequencies between 20 and 20,000 Hz and
loudness between 1 and 120 dB.
The oval window opens up into the vestibule of the inner ear, which is filled
with perilymph. The cochlea and the semicircular canals lie on either side of
the vestibule. The cochlea is a perilymph-filled tube which wraps around itself
approximately 2.5 times. The semicircular canals are also filled with perilymph and are important for providing information about the position and
movement of the head. These three chambers of the inner ear lie within the
temporal bone and form the bony labyrinth. The membranous labyrinth,
suspended within the bony labyrinth, is filled with endolymph, and contains
the sensory organs.
The bony cochlea turns around a central bony modiolus, which forms the
axis of the cochlear turns. The spiral lamina is a ridge of bone that divides the
cochlear cavity into two chambers: the scala vestibule and the scala tympani.
The scala media, or membranous cochlear duct, lies between the scala
vestibule and scala tympani. The organ of Corti is suspended in the
endolymph within the scala media. It rests on the basilar membrane as it spirals within the cochlear turns.
As the footplate of the stapes moves against the oval window, a pressure
wave is produced in the perilymph of the scala vestibule. This pressure wave
travels within microseconds to the apical connection between the scala
vestibule and scala tympani, called the helicotrema. The vibrations from this
pressure wave are transmitted through the fluid to the basilar membrane of the
organ of Corti. The cytoarchitecture of the organ of Corti is such that specific
portions resonate harmonically with each audible frequency, allowing for
tonotopical organization of sound. The width of the basilar membrane is
greater and more flexible toward the apex than at the base where it is stiffer.
This allows lower frequencies to resonate near the apex and helicotrema and
higher frequencies near the base and oval window.
The organ of Corti contains two types of receptors: inner and outer hair
cells. The base of each inner hair cell is indirectly attached to the basilar membrane and functions as an auditory receptor cell. Stereocilia extend above the
apical surface of the cell and lie just below the tectorial membrane, which is
attached separately to the wall of the scala media. As sound waves travel within
the cochlea, the basilar and tectorial membranes move independently of each
other. The stereocilia touch the tentorial membrane and bend, opening ionic
channels that create changes in the potential of the hair cell membrane.
Specifically, the stereocilia bend when they come into contact with the tectorial membrane and produce a change in the K+ conductance inward. The inward
K+ current depolarizes the cell and activates Ca2+ conductance that further contributes to the depolarization. Transmitter is released at the base of the hair cell
and binds to spiral ganglion cells to trigger an action potential. The base of
each hair cell synapses with dendritic processes from up to ten spiral ganglion
cells. These ganglion cells are bipolar cells which synapse with only one inner

CLINICAL CASES

175

hair cell each. They form the spiral ganglion, and their axons form the cochlear
division of the eighth cranial nerve. The outer hair cells contain stereocilia
embedded in the tectorial membrane. They have contractile properties which
allow them to control the apposition of the tectorial membrane to the inner hair
cells, and therefore the sensory response properties of the organ of Corti.
The pressure waves that initially travel in the scala vestibule traverse the
scala media, vibrate the basilar membrane, and induce pressure waves in the
scala tympani. These then induce movements of the elastic diaphragm covering the round window within the scala tympani. The round window opens up
into the air-filled middle ear where the pressure waves are finally dissipated.
The cochlear nerve travels to the brain stem where it enters at the medullary
pontine junction. Each entering nerve fiber bifurcates and synapses with neurons in both the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei. These nuclei contain
tonotopically organized neurons. The dorsal, intermediate, and ventral acoustic
striae project from the cochlear nuclei and relay information to central and rostral structures. The dorsal acoustic stria projects from the dorsal cochlear
nucleus to the contralateral lateral lemniscus. The intermediate acoustic stria
projects from the ventral cochlear nucleus, taking a similar course as the dorsal
stria. The ventral acoustic stria projects from the ventral cochlear nucleus as
well, and travels to the ipsilateral and contralateral nuclei of the trapezoid body
and superior olivary nuclei. These nuclei then project to the ipsilateral and contralateral lateral lemnisci. The superior olivary nucleus is the first point where
information from both ears converges. It is sensitive to small changes in time of
arrival and intensity of stimulus, which helps to localize the sound.
The monaural central auditory pathway carries information about the
frequency of sound. It consists of neuronal fibers projecting from the dorsal
and ventral cochlear nuclei through the dorsal and intermediate striae to the
contralateral inferior colliculus. The binaural pathway ascends bilaterally
with the ventral acoustic stria and carries information about the location of origin and direction of auditory stimuli. The pathway includes synapses in the
trapezoid body, superior olivary complex, and lateral lemniscus nuclei before
ending in the inferior colliculus. Axons then travel to the medial geniculate
nucleus via the brachium of the inferior colliculus. The medial geniculate
nuclei are the final sensory relay stations of the hearing pathway. The auditory
radiation is formed by the efferent projections from the medial geniculate
nucleus to the transverse temporal gyri and the adjacent planum temporale in
the temporal lobe. The primary and secondary auditory cortices are located
within these areas of the temporal lobe.
Sound is perceived when auditory impulses arrive at the primary auditory
cortex. The processing and interpretation of sound, however, involves a combination of structures involved in audition. Information about the location of a
sound is initially processed in the superior olive and inferior colliculus; however, precisely locating a sound requires processing up to the auditory association areas in the superior temporal gyrus and posterior parietal cortex. The
interpretation of combinations of different frequencies in sequence begins in

176

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

the cochlear nuclei and continues to the inferior colliculus and medial geniculate nucleus and primary auditory cortex. Tonotopic organization is continuous
throughout these structures.
Representation of sound is achieved bilaterally in each temporal lobe. The
ascending pathways from the brain stem to the auditory cortex consist of both
crossed and uncrossed fibers (see Figure 22-1). Each lateral lemniscus conducts
stimuli from both ears, and an ipsilateral lesion above the level of the cochlear

Answers
[22.1]

A. Loss of high-frequency hearing results from damage to the hair cells
located at the base of the cochlear duct. Presbycusis is an age-related
degeneration of hair cells in the organ of Corti, beginning at the base of
the cochlear duct and slowly progressing toward the apex. The tonotopic
organization of the cochlear duct predicts the frequencies of hearing
affected. The cochlear duct is stiffer at the base, causing it to resonate at
a high frequency, and more lax at the apex where it responds to lower frequency vibrations. Loss of hair cells at the base of the cochlear duct
therefore cause a loss of high-frequency hearing, and as the degeneration
progresses up the duct, the hearing loss descends the normal hearing
spectrum, until it reaches the speech range (roughly 200-6000 Hz).

[22.2]

C. Because of the decussation in the ascending auditory pathway, sound
will continue to stimulate bilateral medial geniculate bodies in this
patient. The thalamic nucleus involved in the ascending auditory pathway is the medial geniculate body, which receives input via the
brachium of the inferior colliculus. Additionally, sound from one ear is
represented bilaterally in the CNS, so even though this man has no
response from his right ear, sound waves affecting his left ear will cause
stimulation of bilateral structures above the cochlear nuclei. The point
of initial decussation in the ascending auditory pathway is the trapezoid
body. The lateral geniculate body is the thalamic relay for vision.

[22.3]

D. The primary auditory cortex is located on the superior aspect of
the temporal lobe bilaterally. This area is also known as the transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl. Each lobe receives input from both
ears, although the contralateral ear is more highly represented. Since
the auditory cortex receives bilateral input, a lesion must affect both
temporal lobes in order to cause cortical deafness.

The organ of Corti within the cochlea is organized tonotopically
with higher pitches at the base and lower pitches at the apex,
enabling us to differentiate sound tones.
The stereocilia touch the tentorial membrane and bend, opening
ionic channels that create changes in the potential of the hair cell

◆

Compressed structure in visual pathway: Bitemporal hemianopia
results from a lesion affecting the optic chiasm. A mass in the sella
turcica can compress the overlying optic chiasm, resulting in deficits of
both temporal visual fields.
Structures that follow optic chiasm in visual pathway: The optic
chiasm splits to form the left and right optic tracts. Information from
the left visual fields of both eyes travels in the right optic tract while
information from the right visual fields of both eyes travels in the left
optic tract. Thus, a lesion of either optic tract will lead to deficits in the
contralateral visual field.
Mass effect: Damage to the brain caused by pressure of a tumor often
causing the blockage of fluid or excess accumulation of fluid within the
skull.
Treatment options: A number of surgical, radiotherapeutic, and
pharmacological treatment options are available for pituitary adenomas.
Endocrine-deficient patients will require appropriate replacement
therapy. Surgical removal is most often with a transsphenoidal
craniotomy.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Visual perception begins with rays of light reflecting off of an object and
reaching the eye. The light is refracted as it passes through the cornea and
lens. The optical properties of the lens cause the image to be inverted and
reversed as it is projected onto the retina. Light from the left half of the
visual field will therefore project onto the right half of the retina, and light
from the superior half of the visual field will project onto the inferior half
of the retina. Information from the right half of the retina is carried along
the visual pathway to the right cerebral hemisphere, and information from
the left half of the retina is carried to the left cerebral hemisphere. Lesions
along the visual pathway from the eye to the visual cortex will create
deficits that correspond to the associated visual field. A pituitary mass can
compress the optic chiasm, impeding nerve fibers carrying information
from the nasal retinas as they cross at the chiasm. Surgical or medical
decompression of the mass, if done early enough, can lead to improvement
of symptoms.

3.

Know the anatomic structures involved with visual perception.
Be able to describe the visual pathway.
Understand the effects of lesions interrupting the visual pathway.

Definitions
Scotoma: An isolated area within the visual field in which vision is absent
or diminished (a blind spot).
Homonymous hemianopia: A loss of vision in the same visual field of
both eyes.
Bitemporal hemianopia: A loss of vision in the outer half of the visual
field of each eye.
Receptive field: A specific area of the retina that maximally stimulates or
inhibits firing of its corresponding ganglion cell when stimulated by light.
Retinotopic pattern: The topographic representation of the retina created
by ganglion cells from adjacent areas of the retina projecting onto adjacent neurons in the lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) and from there to
adjacent neurons in the visual cortex.
Visual acuity: The smallest size of a dark object in a light background that
can be correctly identified.

DISCUSSION
The retina is formed as an extension of the central nervous system. It contains
two types of photoreceptors: rods and cones. Rods mediate light perception
and are important for nocturnal vision but provide low visual acuity. Cones
mediate color vision and provide high visual acuity. The overall ratio of rods
to cones in the retina is 20:1. The periphery of the retina contains primarily
rods, while the fovea centralis within the macula contains only cones and
functions as a specialized region of the retina adapted for high visual acuity.
Photoreceptors in the retina contain visual pigments that can trap photons
of light. Rods contain the pigment rhodopsin, whereas cones contain three
forms of the pigment iodopsin. Each form of iodopsin absorbs light maximally in different parts of the visible light spectrum: red, green, and blue. The
absorption of light by the visual pigments initiates a chemical reaction that
results in hyperpolarization of the cell membrane. This results in a graded
potential which can then be used by retinal cells to transmit information.
The circuitry of the retina is formed from six basic cell types: rods, cones,
horizontal cells, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, and amacrine cells. As many as
1500 rods will converge onto a single bipolar cell, which can then affect a ganglion cell through the amacrine cell interneurons. In contrast, cone cells
synapse directly onto ganglion cells.

184

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The receptor cells and bipolar cells transmit excitatory signals, whereas the
intervening interneurons, the horizontal cells, and the amacrine cells transmit
inhibitory signals. This retinal circuitry processes information about the color
and contrast of the images projected onto the retina. The retinal ganglion cells
provide information important for detecting the shape and movement of
objects. There are two types: the P type which are color-sensitive detectors and
M type which are color-insensitive motion detectors. The axons of the ganglion cells converge to form the optic nerve. Optic nerve fibers from both eyes
combine to form the optic chiasm which lies superior to the sella turcica and
directly above the pituitary gland. A partial crossing of fibers (decussation)
occurs at the optic chiasm. After the decussations in the optic chiasm, each
optic tract represents the contralateral visual fields. The fibers from the nasal
half of each retina cross to the contralateral side. Fibers from the temporal half
of each retina approach the chiasm but do not decussate. At the level of the
optic chiasm, some ganglion cell axons terminate in the suprachiasmatic
nucleus of the hypothalamus where information is provided to regulate circadian rhythms. The remainder of the axons continue past the optic chiasm as the
optic tracts. The optic tracts terminate primarily in the lateral geniculate
nuclei (LGN) of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pretectal area.
Input from the optic tract to each LGN is received in a retinotopic pattern
representing the contralateral visual half-field. This means that ganglion cells
in adjacent areas of the retina will project onto adjacent neurons in the LGN.
The superior colliculus receives retinotopically organized input directly
from the ipsilateral optic tract. Neurons in the superior colliculus carry visual
input to the pons by way of the tectopontine tract and to the spinal cord by
way of the tectospinal tract. The tectopontine tract also relays visual information to the cerebellum and aids in the control of eye movements through the
paramedian pontine reticular formation. The tectospinal tract mediates reflex
control of head and neck movements in response to visual input. The superior
colliculus also has reciprocal connections with neurons in the visual cortex.
The neurons leaving the lateral geniculate nucleus form the optic radiations and project to the primary visual cortex of the occipital lobes. The inferior radiations carry information regarding superior visual fields while the
superior radiations carry information regarding inferior visual fields. The radiating fibers from the lateral aspect of the LGN course downward and forward
before bending back in a sharp loop through the temporal lobe. They then
course in the lateral wall of the inferior horn of the lateral ventricle and then
to the occipital lobe. The radiating fibers from the medial aspect of the LGN
travel adjacent to the lateral fibers, but take a more direct course over the top
of the inferior ventricular horn and then to the occipital lobe.
The optic radiations travel to the cortex surrounding the calcarine fissure on
the medial occipital lobe. The gyrus above the calcarine fissure is called the
cuneus and receives visual impulses from the ipsilateral upper quadrant of both
retinas, which corresponds to the lower quadrant of the contralateral visual
field. The gyrus below the calcarine fissure is called the lingual gyrus and

CLINICAL CASES

185

receives impulses from the lower quadrant of both retinas. The primary visual
cortex is called the striate cortex because of a stripe of myelinated fibers
named the line of Gennari running horizontally through the cortex. The visual
cortex is divided into the dorsal stream and ventral stream. The dorsal, or the
“where,” stream is involved in spatial awareness and recognizing where objects
are in space. The ventral, or the “what,” stream is involved in object recognition
and form representation.
The optic fibers maintain their topographic arrangement from the LGN to the
cortex, maintaining the retinal map (see Figure 23-1). Thus, information from
the upper quadrant of the left visual field projects to the lower right quadrant of
the retina, then travels to the lateral portion of the right LGN and then to the right
visual cortex below the calcarine sulcus. Information from the fovea in the center of the retina projects to the occipital pole. The visual association areas have
connections with the frontal lobes and brain stem and influence visually guided
saccades, ocular pursuit movements, accommodation, and convergence.
There are a number of discussed visual fields. A monocular visual field
occurs when only one eye is used, as opposed to a binocular visual field, which
involves both eyes. In monocular vision the field of view is increased, while
depth perception is limited. The central visual field operates best under high
illumination and has the greatest visual acuity and color sensitivity. The
peripheral visual field on the other hand, is more sensitive to dim light, operates under low illumination, and has little color sensitivity.
Lesions in different parts of the visual pathway can produce distinctive
visual field defects. An injury to the optic nerve fibers carrying information
from the macula results in loss of vision at the center of the visual field, creating a central scotoma, as well as loss of visual acuity and color vision.
Complete injury to an optic nerve results in complete blindness in the ipsilateral eye. The optic chiasm can be affected by a pituitary tumor compressing
the inferior aspect of the chiasm, or from a craniopharyngioma compressing
the superior aspect. The fibers decussating at the chiasm carry information
from the nasal retina and temporal visual fields and a lesion at this location
results in bitemporal hemianopia. A lesion of the optic tract will affect fibers
from the ipsilateral nasal retina and the contralateral temporal retina, resulting
in a homonymous hemianopia. A lesion of the optic radiations will also result
in a homonymous hemianopia. If the optic radiations are only affected in the
anterior temporal lobe, a predominantly superior visual field deficit will result.
A lesion of the occipital lobe that affects the entire primary visual cortex
can also create a homonymous hemianopia. Macular sparing, preservation of
the central 5-10 degrees of vision in an otherwise blind visual field, is often
present because of the extensive macular representation in the occipital cortex.
Visual input from the upper halves of the retina carries information from
the lower visual field to the cuneus, whereas input from the lower halves of the
retina carrying information from the upper visual field travels to the lingual
gyrus. A lesion of the lingual gyrus will create a deficit of the contralateral
upper field called a superior quadrantanopia.

B. Color blindness most often occurs because of a defect in one of the
three types of cone cells present in the human eye. Each type of cone
detects a different color: red, blue, or green, and an absence or abnormal response to color in one of these types results in difficulty with
color discrimination. Rod cells respond to all colors of light, see
black and white, and are utilized in low light situations. Bipolar cells

188

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

function to consolidate information from many rod cells and transmit
it to retinal ganglion cells, which project their axons down the optic
nerves and tracts to the thalamus.
[23.2]

C. This patient is most likely to have a defect of the right optic
tract. Vision is represented contralaterally in the CNS, but it is not
divided by eye, rather by visual field. In other words, objects to the
right of midline are represented on the left side of the brain and
vice versa. This woman has a complete loss of vision to the left of
midline, indicating a right-sided lesion behind the optic chiasm,
where the pathways become fully segregated by side. The only
lesion of the ones listed that can cause this is a lesion of the right
optic tract. A lesion of the right inferior optic radiations would
only cause a defect in half of the left visual field, that coming from
the inferior half of the retina, which would cause a left superior
quadrantopia. Lesions of the optic chiasm typically cause bitemporal hemianopia caused by damage to the crossing nasal fibers
from both eyes. A lesion of the left optic nerve would cause complete blindness in the left eye.

[23.3]

A. Because this patient has a right homonymous hemianopia with
macular sparing, the most likely location for the lesion is the left
occipital lobe. The right visual field projects to the left cortex, with
the inferior half represented superior to the calcarine sulcus in the
cuneus, and the superior half represented inferior to the calcarine
sulcus in the lingual gyrus. A lesion in either of these gyri results in
a corresponding quadrantopia. Extensive damage to the occipital
pole, including to both of these gyri, however, can cause vision loss
in the entire visual field. An interesting phenomenon in large occipital lesions, however, is that of macular sparing. It is believed that
because the macula is represented so heavily in the visual cortex,
even large lesions leave some areas of cortex representing the macula intact.

ANSWERS TO CASE 24: MOVEMENT CONTROL
Summary: A 65-year-old man with diabetes and poorly controlled hypertension develops acute-onset right hemiparesis and a partial right facial droop.
The MRI is consistent with a left-sided ischemic stroke.

◆

Affected brain area responsible for patient’s symptoms: The left
internal capsule contains the corticobulbar and corticospinal fibers
innervating the patient’s contralateral face, arm, and leg as they travel to
the brainstem.

◆

Treatment options: If an ischemic stroke is diagnosed within a 3-hour
window, tissue plasminogen activator can be used to attempt to dissolve
the clot in the blood vessels perfusing the internal capsule.

◆

Stroke risk factors: High levels of cholesterol increase risk for
ischemic stroke. Other risk factors include advanced age, hypertension,
smoking, heart disease, and diabetes.

CLNICAL CORRELATION
Cerebral stroke is characterized by the sudden loss of blood supply to an area
of the brain, resulting in a loss of corresponding neurological function. The
majority of strokes are ischemic, caused by a thrombosis or embolism to a
cerebral blood vessel. They can present as hemorrhagic in quality as well, and
an ischemic stroke can convert to a hemorrhagic strokes. The symptoms of a
stroke will depend on the area of the brain that is affected by the lost blood
supply. The most common location for a stroke is the posterior limb of the
internal capsule which carries the descending corticospinal and corticobulbar
fibers and results in purely motor symptoms.

Upper motoneurons: Upper level neurons from the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia that control descending motor pathways either
directly or indirectly.
Lower motoneurons: Motor neurons originating from nuclei of the spinal
cord and brain stem that innervate skeletal muscle and provide the final
direct link from the nervous system through the neuromuscular junctions.
Premotor cortex: An area of motor cortex, located between the primary
motor cortex and the prefrontal cortex, responsible for sensory guidance
of movement and control of proximal and trunk musculature of the body.
Betz cells: Large pyramidal cells located within the primary motor cortex,
which give rise to the portion of the corticospinal tract which synapses
directly with lower motoneurons in the anterior horn cells of the spinal
cord.
Somatotopic: The maintenance of spatial organization within the central
nervous system, for instance, fibers innervating the foot will travel next
to fibers innervating the lower leg.

DISCUSSION
The motor system is organized in a functional hierarchy, with each level
responsible for a specific task. Movement must be planned, have a purpose,
respond to sensory input, and function with coordination using spatiotemporal
details of muscle positions. There are several anatomical pathways that project to the spinal cord from higher motor centers. Most of these are organized
somatotopically, with movements of adjacent body parts being controlled by
contiguous areas of the brain at each level within the motor hierarchy.
The primary motor cortex lies in the precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule of the frontal lobe, and is responsible for controlling simple movement. It
extends from the lateral fissure upward to the dorsal border of the hemisphere
and beyond to the paracentral lobule. The left motor strip controls the right
side of the body, and the right strip controls the left side. Neurons in the lowest lateral part of the motor strip influence the larynx and tongue, followed in
upward sequence by neurons affecting the face, thumb, hand, arm, thorax,
abdomen, thigh, leg, foot, and perineal muscles. The areas for the hand,
tongue, and larynx are disproportionately large, given the elaborate motor control needed for these muscle groups. This functional representation is called a
homunculus.
The premotor cortex lies immediately rostral to the primary motor area on
the lateral surface of the hemispheres. The premotor area also contains a
homunculus representation. The medial aspect contains the supplementary
motor area. The postcentral gyrus and the secondary motor cortex located
where the pre- and postcentral gyri are continuous at the base of the central
sulcus are also cortical regions that influence movement. The frontal eye
fields, located in the middle frontal gyrus, initiate voluntary saccades and contain neurons that influence eye movement.

Movements result from the actions of neuronal networks at many different
levels of the nervous system. The brain stem and spinal cord contain pattern

cortex can control contractions of individual muscles and can determine the
force of these contractions. Populations of motor cortical neurons, however,
must act together to specify the direction and force of movements. The premotor and supplementary motor areas are important in planning movements.
The supplementary motor area also functions to integrate movements performed simultaneously on both sides of the body.
The lower motoneurons innervate skeletal muscle through neuromuscular
junctions. Their cell bodies reside in the spinal cord and cranial nerve nuclei
of the central nervous system, where they are influenced by the higher nervous system structures to stimulate or inhibit voluntary movement. The lower
levels of the motor system coordinate simple reflexes and control the amount
of force and velocity generated by a single muscle. They coordinate movements and changes in posture. The upper motoneurons technically include
the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and basal ganglia which all regulate lower
motoneuron activity either directly or indirectly through interneurons. The
higher levels of the motor systems are involved in more global tasks and coordinate and calculate the activity of many limbs or muscle groups and evaluate
the appropriateness of a particular action.
The corticospinal tract, or pyramidal tract, controls skilled movements of the distal limbs and influences the distal flexor muscles. Onethird of the axons in the corticospinal tract originate in the primary motor
cortex, one-tenth of these cells originate from Betz cells, which are large
pyramidal cells located in the fifth cortical layer. Another third of the corticospinal tract axons arise from the premotor and supplementary motor
regions and one-third of the fibers arise from the parietal lobe, primarily the
postcentral gyrus. The areas of the cortex that contribute to the corticospinal
tract are collectively termed the sensorimotor cortex. After passing
through the posterior limb of the internal capsule and the middle of the
cerebral pedicle, or crus cerebri, the corticospinal tract splits into bundles
in the pons prior to reforming as a discrete bundle to form the medullary
pyramid. Approximately 90% of the fibers cross to the other side at the
level of the pyramidal tract decussation in the lower medulla and continue descending as the lateral corticospinal tract. This tract travels to all
levels of the spinal cord, synapsing in the lateral aspects of laminae IV
through VIII. Most of the synapses in these layers are onto inerneurons
which then synapse directly onto motoneurons in lamina IX. Some fibers in
the lateral corticospinal tract, however, synapse directly onto the motoneurons in lamina IX. The remaining 10% of corticospinal fibers that do not
decussate in the medulla descend in the anterior funiculus of the cervical
and upper thoracic cord as the ventral corticospinal tract. Most of these
fibers decussate through the ventral white commissure at their level of termination prior to synapsing on interneurons and motoneurons of the contralateral side. The number of fibers in both lateral and ventral corticospinal
tracts successively decreases in lower spinal cord segments as more and
more fibers reach their terminations.

196

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The corticospinal tract fibers that synapse on the interneurons of the dorsal
horn influence both local reflex arcs and originating cells of ascending sensory
pathways. This system allows the cerebral cortex to control reflex motor output and to modify the sensory input that reaches the brain. Cortical excitatory signals usually result from monosynaptic connections with
motoneurons and are facilitated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. Inhibitory
signals occur through synaptic connections in inhibitory interneurons and
are mediated by glycine. The activation of the corticospinal tract generally
results in excitatory input to motoneurons of flexor muscles and inhibitory
input to those of extensor muscles.
The corticobulbar tract arises primarily from the ventral portion of the sensorimotor cortex on the lateral surface of the hemisphere and from the frontal
eye fields. The axons diverge from the corticospinal tract at the level of the midbrain and terminate in the brain stem nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, V, VI, VII,
IX, X, XI, and XII. Fibers projecting from the frontal eye fields indirectly influence eye movements by synapsing on cells in the pontine reticular formation
that then project to the nuclei of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. The cranial nerve
motor nuclei receive innervation from both cerebral hemispheres, creating symmetric movements on both sides of the face. The lower facial nucleus and
hypoglossal nucleus receive far heavier innervation from the ipsilateral cortex,
allowing muscles controlled by these groups (lower face and tongue) to be controlled independently on the two sides. Similar to the corticospinal tract, the
corticobulbar tract contains fibers that terminate on ascending sensory neurons,
allowing for mediation of sensory information from the nucleus gracilis,
nucleus cuneatus, sensory trigeminal nuclei, and nucleus of the solitary tract.
The corticotectal tract contains fibers that project from cortical areas of
the occipital and inferior parietal lobes to the superior colliculus, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, and the nucleus of Darkschewitsch. Axons project from
here to the pontine reticular formation and from there to the medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) to synapse on the oculomotor, trochlear, and
abducens nuclei. This input allows for cortical influence on extraocular muscle activity. The corticotectal tract also connects with neurons in the superior
colliculus that give rise to the tectospinal tract. This tract crosses at the dorsal tegmental decussation and descends to the cervical spinal cord where the
fibers become incorporated with the MLF. Input from the tectospinal tract
influences neurons innervating the muscles of the neck, and are concerned
with reflexive turning movements of the head and eyes.
The cortical areas that give rise to the corticospinal tract also form the corticorubral tract. These neurons project to the ipsilateral red nucleus in the
tegmentum of the midbrain. Neurons of the red nucleus then give rise to the
rubrospinal tract, which crosses at the ventral tegmental decussation and
descends through the lateral tegmentum of the pons, midbrain, and medulla.
Descending just anterior to the lateral corticospinal tract, the fibers synapse in
laminae V, VI, and VII of the spinal gray matter. The rubrospinal tract facilitates flexors and inhibits extensor motoneurons.

CLINICAL CASES

197

The corticoreticular fibers travel with the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts to the reticular formation. The reticular formation of the brain
stem receives sensory information from numerous systems and communicates heavily with the cerebellum and limbic systems. Two corticoreticular
fibers originate from both the sensorimotor cortex, and other regions of
the brain such as the medial prefrontal cortex, the limbic lobe, and the
amygdala. These cortical areas integrate somatic and visceral components
of complex reflex systems such as micturition and genital function, as well
as controlling the complex emotional and social behaviors associated with
them.
The pontine reticulospinal tract is important for the control of both posture
and locomotion. It originates from the pontine reticular formation and travels
with the MLF through the medulla and cervical spinal cord before terminating
in the thoracic spinal cord. Its fibers synapse in laminae VII and VIII with excitatory signals for extensor motoneurons innervating the midline musculature
of the body and the proximal extremities.
Several raphe nuclei within the reticular formation have an important
function in the modulation of the responsiveness of the motor system to
reflex or corticospinal inputs. The caudal raphe nuclei in the reticular formation give rise to fibers that project to the spinal cord where they influence
incoming sensory signals as well as motor responsiveness. Fibers from the
nucleus raphe magnus exert important influences on the transmission of
pain stimuli from peripheral nerves. The nucleus locus ceruleus and nucleus
subceruleus give rise to noradrenergic projections to the spinal cord through
the ventrolateral funiculus. While these raphe-spinal connections do not
evoke movement, they are important in producing excitatory or general
inhibitory effects that influence the overall motoneuron responsiveness and
modulate the motor system in different phases of sleep–wake cycles and
with changing emotional states.
The vestibulospinal tracts are important pathways for the control of postural tone and postural adjustments of the body that accompany head movements. They arise from neurons in the vestibular nuclei of the medulla and
descend as the lateral vestibulospinal tract over the entire length of the
cord, and the medial vestibulospinal tract through the upper thoracic levels. They descend in the anterior funiculus and synapse on lamina VII and
VIII of the spinal gray matter to evoke excitatory postsynaptic potentials in
extensor motoneurons innervating the neck, back, forelimb, and hindlimb
muscles.
The integration of sensory input with movement allows us to continually
interact with our environment through varied and purposeful motor behaviors.
Motor systems are continuously refined by repetition and learning because of
constant influences from the complex cortical association areas. Lesions along
the motor hierarchy can lead to both negative (paralysis) and positive (spasticity) sequelae caused by the combination of excitatory and inhibitory input to
lower motor systems.

control of the contralateral leg and foot in the paracentral lobule, and
control of more superior body parts in progressively more inferior
aspects of the precentral gyrus as you progress toward the sylvian
fissure. A lesion over the lateral convexity of the fronto-parietal
region would compress one of the primary motor strips, located in
the precentral gyrus, resulting in weakness of the contralateral hand
or arm or face, depending on the exact location of the tumor.
[24.2]

B. The deficit in executing complex movements can be attributed to a
dysfunction in his supplemental and premotor areas. The motor system is arranged in a hierarchical fashion, with each higher level adding
complexity to possible movements. At the top of this hierarchy are the
supplemental motor area and premotor cortex, which are involved in
planning and execution of complex motor behaviors. Neurons in the
primary motor cortex are involved in simple movements, and can
determine the speed and strength with which muscle groups contract.
Descending axons from both these areas travel through the internal
capsule and the corticospinal tracts to synapse on anterior horn cells,
which control the actual contraction of individual muscle groups.
Since this man has full voluntary movement and strength in all of his
muscle groups, his primary motor cortex seems to be intact.

[24.3]

B. Approximately 90% of the descending axons of the corticospinal
tract decussate at the level of the medullary pyramids in the pyramidal decussation. These fibers then travel in the contralateral lateral
corticospinal tract in the lateral column of the spinal cord. They end
on alpha motor neurons and interneurons at the appropriate spinal
level, resulting in control of movement by the contralateral motor
cortex. The remaining 10% of the corticospinal neurons do not cross
in the medullary pyramids, and travel down the ipsilateral cord in the
anterior corticospinal tract, and eventually cross in the ventral white
commissure of the spinal cord at their target spinal level.

CASE 25

A 62-year-old male presents to his general practitioner complaining of a
steady tremor in his hands, which has slowly progressed for the past 6 weeks.
The patient also states that walking has become increasingly difficult although
he attributes this to old age. Upon physical examination, the patient has
increased muscle tone with a notably hunched posture and a resting tremor.
When asked to make purposeful movements, the patient is slow to initiate the
movement; however, the tremor is alleviated while moving. All cranial nerves
are intact and reflexive examinations normal. The patient shows no symptoms
of dementia, Alzheimer, or any other cognitive disorders. An MRI is ordered
which shows mild brain atrophy appropriate for his age, but otherwise unremarkable. You make the diagnosis of Parkinson disease.

ANSWERS TO CASE 25: BASAL GANGLIA
Summary: A 62-year-old male with bradykinesia and a steady resting
tremor in both hands. His tremor is temporarily mitigated while making
purposeful movements. The patient has increased muscle tone and a
hunched posture. When asked to walk, the patient’s gait is disturbed. The
remainder of the physical examination is significant for normal reflexive
responses and intact cranial nerves. A magnetic resonance image reveals
mild global brain atrophy appropriate for the patient’s age, but is otherwise
normal.

Microscopic pathology: Lewy bodies are eosinophilic cytoplasmic
inclusions with a halo of radial fibrils and are composed mainly of the
protein alpha-synuclein. These pathologic structures are thought to
accumulate over time and disrupt normal intracellular functions of nerve
cells.
Treatment options: While no current treatment options are curative,
administration of levodopa (a precursor to Dopamine) and other
Parkinsonism medications help alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson
disease. Some patients may also be candidates for neurosurgical
interventions such as thalamotomy, subthalamotomy, or pallidotomy
procedures to alleviate movement symptoms once medical
treatments have become ineffective. Also, current research shows
that embryonic stem cell transplantation into the striatum may one
day become an effective treatment option for patients with Parkinson
disease.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Parkinson disease is a common neurological disorder of the basal ganglia
arising from neural cell degeneration within the pars compacta region of the
substantia nigra. The loss of these pigmented dopaminergic neurons
reduces the amount of dopamine synthesized by the substantia nigra.
Without the appropriate amount of dopamine in the striatum, there is an
antagonistic effect on the direct pathway and agonistic effect on the indirect
pathway of the nigrostriatal projection. This often leads to hypokinesia. The
direct pathway has the net effect of exciting thalamic neurons, which in turn
make excitatory connections with cortical neurons. The indirect pathway
has the net effect of inhibiting thalamic neurons, thereby inhibiting cortical
neurons. The pathological cause of cell death in Parkinson disease is still
unclear and the majority of cases are idiopathic. Other causes of Parkinson
syndrome are related to drug-induced, toxic, genetic, and traumatic etiologies. Parkinsonism symptoms are also observed in individuals after longterm use of antipsychotic medications such as Haldol or after ingestion of
the neurotoxin MPTP.

Know the anatomical structures and cellular projections of the basal
ganglia.
Be able to describe the different neurological functions of the basal
ganglia.
Know common disorders associated with the basal ganglia.

Definitions
Striatum: The caudate nucleus and the putamen. Together, the two nuclei
act as the “receiving portion” of the basal ganglia.
Pallidum: Comprised of the internal (GPi) and external (GPe) portion of the
globus pallidus, the pallidum plays a modulatory role between the striatum and the thalamus. The efferent connections from the substantia
nigra and the pallidum act as a mediator between the basal ganglia and
the rest of the nervous system.
Medium spiny neurons: The most common cell type found in the striatum.
Contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).
Hemiballismus: Involuntary, violent movements of the contralateral side
of the body resulting from lesions involving the subthalamic nucleus.
Chorea: A movement disorder of the basal ganglia characterized by a rapid,
irregular flow of motions as well as grimacing movements of the face.
Athetosis: A movement disorder of the basal ganglia characterized by slow,
writhing movements of a wormlike character involving the extremities,
trunk, and neck.
Disinhibition: Inhibition of an inhibiting projection pathway.

DISCUSSION
The basal ganglia are composed of the caudate nucleus, putamen, and
globus pallidus. Because of the high degree of cellular connections with these
three structures, the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus are also considered components of the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia have significant
connections with both the thalamus and the cortex. It functions primarily in the
modification and elaboration of movements initiated by the primary motor
cortex. A lesion in one of the nuclei within the basal ganglia will therefore produce a disruption in movement and muscle tone but no pareses.
Other significant roles of the basal ganglia include cognitive functions such
as verbal working memory, motor planning, repetitive movement learning, and
the association of motivation and emotions to the execution of movements.
The caudate nucleus and the putamen together are termed the striatum.
Together, these two nuclei act as the “receiving portion” of the basal ganglia.

204

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The main afferent connections travel from the cerebral cortex, the intralaminar
thalamic nuclei, and the dopamine-containing cell groups in the mesencephalon. The putamen largely receives information from the primary motor
and somatosensory cortex, while the caudate nucleus receives the majority of
its inputs from the association areas of the cortex. The intralaminar thalamic
nuclei project cells to the striatum in large part from the centromedian
nucleus. The dopaminergic afferent connections of the striatum arise from the
substantia nigra and the ventral tegmental area.
The primary efferent pathways from the basal ganglia begin in the globus
pallidus and substantia nigra and project to the thalamus, mesencephalic
tegmentum, and superior colliculus. The efferent connections from the substantia nigra and the pallidum act as a mediator between the basal ganglia and
the rest of the nervous system.
The globus pallidus is composed of internal and external segments, each
receiving afferents input from the striatum and subthalamic nucleus. The
actions of the striatal fibers on the internal segment of the globus pallidus
(GPi) are inhibitory while the effects from the subthalamic nucleus are excitatory. The activity of the GPi is determined from the summation of inhibitory
and excitatory input. The efferent output from the GPi acts on the substantia
nigra and the thalamus. While the external portion of the globus pallidus (GPe)
projects to the subthalamic nucleus, the substantia nigra has efferent connections with the thalamus and superior colliculus. The thalamus functions as a
relay center for information projecting in both directions between the basal
ganglia and the cerebral cortex. The basal ganglia additionally regulate muscle movements and tone through its efferent input to the reticulospinal tract
and reticular formation. Six different cell types have been identified in the
striatum, the most common of which are medium spiny neurons. These contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA.
The substantia nigra has two components: the pars compacta and the pars
reticula. The pars compacta is densely packed with neuromelanin-containing
neurons (giving the nucleus its dark color). The afferent connections of the
substantia nigra come from many different cell groups, the majority being
from the striatum. The inhibitory afferents of the substantia nigra contain the
neurotransmitter GABA. Excitatory afferents originate from the pedunculopontine nucleus and subthalamic nucleus transmitting glutamate, the raphe
nucleus–transmitting serotonin, the locus coeruleus using norepinephrine,
and the basal forebrain.
The efferent connections of the substantia nigra primarily project to the
striatum and thalamus, with some association to the superior colliculus and
reticular formation (see Fig. 25-1). The pars compacta contains the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons, making it a key location in Parkinson disease. The
nigrostriatal pathway has the dual effect of exciting the direct pathway and
inhibiting the indirect pathway—when this pathway is destroyed in Parkinson
disease, then the indirect pathway cannot be inhibited. The pars reticula contains inhibitory GABAergic nigrothalamic neurons.

Dopamine is one of the key modulatory neurotransmitters in the striatum.
Dopamine receptors can be divided into D1 and D2 types, each of which posses
many of their own subtypes. The receptors influence many types of ion channels on both presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. This allows the neurotransmitter to affect the stabilization of the membrane potential and contribute
to keeping that potential in a range where the cell is apt to fire in bursts, that
is, in a state suited for efficient signal transmission.
Excitatory afferent connections are received from the motor cortex by the
subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus sends the majority of its efferent
connections to the pars reticula and the globus pallidus. The effects of the subthalamopallidal efferents are excitatory. The excitatory influences of the striatum determine the activity of the GABA-containing neurons within the GPi.

206

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The subthalamic nucleus is believed to control or stop ongoing movements.
Because of the inhibitory effects that the GPi has on the thalamocortical neurons, increased activity in the subthalamic nucleus would result in an inhibition
of voluntary movement as a result of the inhibition of the motor cortex. The
clinical presentation of hemiballismus, involuntary, violent movements of the
contralateral side of the body resulting from lesions involving the subthalamic
nucleus, may be because of increased activity of the thalamocortical neurons.
Several diseases have been linked to the basal ganglia. Parkinson disease is a
neurodegenerative disorder of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia
nigra. The disease is characterized by tremor, rigidity, akinesia, and postural
instability. Current therapies for Parkinson disease are limited to the treatment
of the movement symptoms.
Huntington disease is an inherited disease that results from progressive
neurodegeneration of primarily GABAergic neurons within the striatum. It is
characterized in its early stages by forgetfulness, depression, sudden falls,
irritability, and choreiform movements which gradually progress until the
patient is no longer ambulatory. In the late stages of the disease, continued cell
deterioration eventually results in dementia. A locus for the disease has been
identified on the short arm of chromosome 4 allowing carriers of the disease
to be identified before symptoms present. The disease is caused by a selective
loss of striatal neurons in the indirect pathway. Without the inhibition from the
indirect pathway, the thalamic neurons can fire spontaneously, causing the
motor cortex to execute motor programs with no control by the person.
Tourette syndrome is a disorder involving a functional disturbance between the
basal ganglia and the frontal cortex. The syndrome presents with multiple tics,
often associated with uncontrollable vocal outbursts. Patients with Tourette syndrome are often treated with dopamine antagonists to relive the motor symptoms.
Tardive Dyskinesia is an iatrogenic disorder that results from the long-term
administration of neuroleptic medications such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and thioridazine. The disorder is characterized by uncontrollable
movements of the head, face, lips, and tongue, and rigidity. The symptoms
are caused by sensitization of dopamine receptors in the mesolimbic pathway.
This sensitization results in an imbalance in communication between the
nigrostriatal pathway and the basal nuclear motor loop.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS
Refer to the following case scenario to answer questions 25.1-25.3:
A 38-year-old man is brought into your office by his family because he has

been having strange fidgeting movements of his hands and fingers nearly all
the time that he did not have in the past. Based on this history and your physical examination findings, you perform an MRI, which is suggestive of
Huntington disease, a disorder that affects the basal ganglia.

Answers
[25.1]

C. The primary function of the basal ganglia is thought to be modulation of cortical output, including modification of movements initiated by the motor cortex. The major outputs of the basal ganglia
are inhibitory to the thalamus, and the variety of basal ganglia circuits alters these outputs to further inhibit or disinhibit the thalamus.
Since the thalamic outputs to the cortex are for the most part excitatory, the basal ganglia are capable of inhibiting or disinhibiting the
cortex. It is thought that these actions serve to somehow select the
appropriate motor programs at the right time, while suppressing
other programs that are not needed at the time. The primary motor
cortex directly controls alpha motor neurons, the premotor and supplemental motor areas are involved in the planning of complex
movements, and the cerebellum serves to integrate and smooth out
multiple movements.

[25.2]

A. The striatum, composed of the caudate and putamen, serves as the
primary input structure of the basal ganglia. Motor and somatosensory information primarily is received by the putamen, while input
from the association cortex is primarily received by the caudate. The
striatum then projects to both segments of the globus pallidus and the
substantia nigra, primarily with inhibitory action. Stimulation of striatal neurons leads to the activation of complex basal ganglial circuitry
that ultimately modulates thalamic outflow to the cortex.

208
[25.3]

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

B. The internal segment of the globus pallidus projects inhibitory
neurons from the basal ganglia to the thalamus. The thalamic nuclei
involved are the ventral anterior and ventrolateral nuclei for motor
control, and the dorsomedial nucleus for output to the association
cortex. The thalamic output to the cortex is excitatory, so the various
basal ganglial circuits inhibit or disinhibit thalamic outflow, thereby
affecting motor control. The pars reticularis of the substantia nigra
also has inhibitory outflow to the thalamus that behaves very similarly to the internal segment of the globus pallidus.

CASE 26

A 56-year-old man presents to the emergency room with complaints of difficulty walking and frequent falls over the past 48 hours. He has a 30-year history of chronic alcoholism. His nutritional status is poor and he admits to
spending all of his money on alcohol instead of buying food to eat. Prior to his
presentation, he describes an alcoholic binge and several days of anorexia. On
physical examination he is noted to walk with a wide-based, irregular gait. He
has poor coordination on tests requiring rapid leg movements.
Based on the patient’s history of severe alcoholism and malnutrition, alcoholic cerebellar degeneration was thought to be the most likely diagnosis.
After treatment with vitamin B1 (thiamine), aggressive hydration with intravenous fluids, and good nutrition, the patient’s symptoms gradually improved
and he was discharged to alcohol treatment program.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26: CEREBELLUM
Summary: A 56-year-old man with 2 days of difficulty walking, frequent falls,
and a wide-based, irregular gait with poor coordination of his lower extremities. He has a history of chronic alcoholism and poor nutrition. He was treated
with vitamin B1 (thiamine), aggressive hydration with intravenous fluids, and
good nutrition. His symptoms gradually improved and he was discharged to
alcohol treatment program with a normal gait.

◆

Area of the cerebellum affected: Degenerative changes appear in the
anterior and superior parts of the cerebellar vermis and are associated
with ataxia of gait but preservation of speech and coordination of upper
extremities.

◆

Disease at risk for if symptoms untreated: Wernicke-Korsakoff
disease is a far more serious disease that also results from malnutrition
and frequently chronic alcoholism. It results from severe thiamine
deficiency, which leads to a degeneration of the eye movement nuclei
and the cerebellar vermis and cortex, particularly the Purkinje cell layer.
The symptoms include ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and confusion. If
untreated, the symptoms can progress to coma and death.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is caused by toxic degeneration of Purkinje
cells, and is clinically characterized by impaired gait, tremor, and truncal ataxia.
The midline cerebellar structures are predominantly involved with resulting effect
of the lower extremities. The disease is thought to be caused by a combination of
alcohol neurotoxicity and nutritional deficiency. The treatment of alcoholic cerebellar degeneration is alcohol abstinence, adequate calorie intake, and thiamine
supplementation. While the effects on the cerebellum are frequently permanent,
early treatment can lead to an improvement in symptoms and prevent the development of more serious pathology, such as Wernicke-Korsakoff disease.

Dysdiadochokinesia: Reduced ability to perform rapidly alternating
movements.
Dysmetria: Disturbance of the trajectory or placement of a body part during active movements.
Mossy fibers: Originating neurons from spinal and brainstem nuclei
(except the inferior olive) that form synapses with granule cells in the
cerebellar cortex and have excitatory input to many Purkinje cells.
Nystagmus: Rapid and involuntary oscillatory movement of the eye.
Spinocerebellum: Comprises the vermis and the intermediate zones of the
cerebellar cortex, the fastigial and interpose nuclei. Receives major input
from the spinocerebellar tract. Major output to rubrospinal, vestibulospinal,
and reticulospinal tracts.
Vestibulocerebellum: Flocculonodular lobe and its connection with the
lateral vestibular nuclei. Involved in vestibular reflexes and maintenance
of posture.

DISCUSSION
The cerebellum participates in the execution of a wide variety of movements.
It maintains the fine control and coordination of both simple and complex
movements. It is essential for coordinating posture and balance in walking and
running, executing sequential movements, producing rapidly alternating repetitive movements and smooth-pursuit movements, and controlling the trajectory, velocity, and acceleration of movements.
The cerebellar cortex is comprised of gray matter arranged in slim, folded
layers called folia. Three layers of cells constitute the cortex: the molecular
layer, the Purkinje cell layer, and the granular layer. The Purkinje cells
mediate all of the outgoing signaling of the cerebellum. Below the cortical layers, the white matter of the cerebellum houses the afferent and efferent fibers.
Within the white matter are the cerebellar nuclei. These nuclei play an important mediating role in the cerebellar efferent connections.
The cerebellum includes a midline structure called the vermis and two large
lateral structures known as the cerebellar hemispheres. Together, the vermis and
hemispheres can be transversely divided into the flocculonodular lobe, the anterior lobe, and the posterior lobe. The flocculonodular lobe is the phylogenetically oldest portion of the cerebellum. It is comprised of the flocculus which is
connected by a thin stalk to the nodulus, itself a portion of the vermis within the
midline. The remaining portion of the vermis and the cerebellar hemispheres are
termed the corpus cerebelli. The medial most portions of the cerebellar hemispheres are defined as the intermediate zones. The primary fissure divides the
remaining functional areas of the cerebellum into the posterior and anterior lobes.
Information pertaining to the movement and relative position of the head is
relayed primarily to the vestibular nuclei. Connections also occur, however,
between the flocculonodular lobe and posterior portion of the vermis, allowing
for cerebellar mediation of eye movements and movements related to balance.

212

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The cerebellar cortex receives constant information from the skin, joints, and
muscles of the limbs and trunk through the dorsal, ventral, and rostral
spinocerebellar tracts and through the cuneocerebellar tract. All of this
information is integrated with input from the auditory, vestibular, and visual
sensory systems in order to determine the progress of motor movements
within the cerebellum. The spinocerebellar tracts are somatotopically
organized and provide the physiological basis for the cerebellar somatotopic
organization.
The pontine nuclei provide the cerebellum with its greatest number of
afferent connections via the pontocerebellar tract. These nuclei function
as mediators of information between the cerebellum and cerebrum. The
cerebrum sends information to the pontine nuclei via the corticopontine
tract. The majority of the fibers of the corticopontine tract begin in the
motor cortex and somatosensory cortex with significant connections also
coming from the premotor area, supplemental motor area, posterior parietal
cortex, and prefrontal and visual cortex. These connections allow the cerebellum to evaluate and coordinate motor movements. In addition, the pontine nuclei receive cortical projections from the cingulate gyrus and
hypothalamus providing the physiological basis for the influence of emotion on motor movements. The pathways involving the cerebellar cortex,
pontine nuclei, and cerebellum are referred to as the corticopontocerebellar pathway.
The medial portion of the cerebellum, the vermis, is characterized by afferents from the spinal cord. The lateral portions of the cerebellar lobes receive
their afferents mainly from the cerebrum. The area between the vermis and the
lateral portions of the cerebellar lobes, termed the intermediate zone,
receives afferents from both the spinal cord and the cerebral cortex.
The cerebellar cortex is made up of three layers: the molecular layer,
Purkinje cell layer, and granular layer. The molecular cell layer possesses
few cell bodies and is primarily composed of axons and dendrites whose cell
bodies lie in deeper layers. The Purkinje cell layer, as its name suggests, consists of mostly Purkinje cells which are arranged in a single layer. The dendrites of the Purkinje cells are very dense and receive numerous synaptic
connections with the parallel fibers (~200,000 per cell). The Purkinje cells
are GABAergic and thus inhibitory. The Purkinje cells are also the only cells
to project out of the cerebellar cortex. The granular layer is the deepest layer
of the cerebellar cortex. The granule cells project their axons to the molecular layer, where they split in two directions and run parallel with the cortical
surface. These cells are termed parallel fibers and synapse with many
Purkinje cells. The granule cells release glutamate and create an excitatory
effect on the Purkinje cells.
The cerebellar cortex receives two forms of afferent connections: mossy
fibers and climbing fibers. Because each mossy fiber forms synapses with
many granule cells which then synapse with many Purkinje cells, the mossy
fibers have the ability to excite many Purkinje cells. The effect on a Purkinje

CLINICAL CASES

213

cell from a mossy fiber is, however, relatively weak. Mossy fibers originate
from almost all nuclei except the inferior olive and generally fire at a high frequency of about 50–100 synapses per second. The fibers from the inferior
olive consist of climbing fibers, which project to the molecular layer. As the
climbing fibers travel, each one forms many synapses with the dendrites of the
Purkinje cells it “climbs” alongside. Whereas each Purkinje cell receives
synapses from only one climbing fiber, one climbing fiber may synapse with
many Purkinje cells, allowing a single action potential from a climbing fiber
to create an excitatory effect in numerous Purkinje cells. The frequency of
climbing fiber firing is very low, normally firing less than once per second.
These different forms of afferent connections allow the cerebellar cortex to
receive very precise signals. The mossy fibers mainly convey information of
the force, velocity, direction, and individual muscles involved in motor movements. Climbing fibers provide “error signals” regarding motor movement and
may also be involved in certain aspects of motor learning.
The majority of cerebellar efferents arise from the cerebellar nuclei. Four
different bodies constitute the cerebellar nuclei: the fastigial nucleus, dentate
nucleus, globose nucleus, and emboliform nucleus. They are located within
the deep white matter in each hemisphere. The cerebellar hemispheres exert
their effect on the ipsilateral portion of the body. A cerebellar lesion will therefore clinically manifest symptoms on the same side of the body as the lesion.
The cerebellar hemispheres send their cortical efferents mainly to the motor
cortex, with some minor connections also reaching the supplemental premotor area and lateral premotor area. These minor connections are the basis of
the cerebellar effect on cognition. The efferents from the dentate nucleus cross
the midline after exiting the cerebellar peduncles ending, primarily, in the ventrolateral nucleus of the thalamus. The inferior and middle cerebellar
peduncles convey mainly inputs to the cerebellum, and the superior cerebellar
peduncle conveys the outputs of the cerebellum. The efferent output from the
intermediate zone projects to the interposed nuclei, where it influences motor
neurons through either the rubrospinal or pyramidal tracts. The fastigial
nucleus sends fibers to the reticular formation and vestibular nuclei, allowing cerebellar control of motor neurons via reticulospinal and vestibulospinal
tracts. These tracts facilitate cerebellar influence on posture and autonomic
movements.
Damage to different areas of the cerebellum (see Figure 26-1) creates characteristic symptoms. A lesion of the flocculonodular lobe or midline will usually result in problems with stance and gait, titubation, head posture, and
ocular-motor disorders resulting in nystagmus. Anterior lobe lesions typically result in gait ataxia. Disease infiltrating the neocerebellum often presents with ataxia involving voluntary movements. Lesions of the lateral
hemispheres can also result in asynergia, gait ataxia, hypotonia, dysarthria
and speech ataxia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, asynergia or the
decomposition of complex movements, and intentional tremors as well as
static tremors.

Answers

B. This girl has right-sided cerebellar symptoms: difficulty with
fine movements and past pointing on finger-to-nose. Since the cerebellar hemispheres affect movement in the limbs, and the cerebellum
acts ipsilaterally, the defect must be in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A left side lesion would cause left-sided symptoms, and a
lesion in the midline would cause truncal and gait ataxia. The rest of
this girl’s symptoms are explained by mass effect from the tumor
causing increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which causes
headaches, vomiting, lethargy, and papilledema.

A. The primary outflow from the cerebellum is through the deep
nuclei (dentate, emboliform, globose, and fastigial nuclei) depending
on where the input is coming from, with (1) the lateral cerebellar
hemispheres projecting to the dentate nucleus; (2) the intermediate
zone of the cerebellar cortex projecting to the globose and emboliform nuclei, which are also known as the interposed nuclei; and (3)
the cerebellar vermis projecting to the fastigial nucleus. From the
dentate nucleus, cerebellar outflow projects through the superior
cerebellar peduncle to the red nucleus and the ventral anterior and
ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus.

[26.3]

C. It is thought that the firing of excitatory climbing fibers represents
some sort of error signal to the cerebellum, and is integral in the
process of motor learning. The two types of input to the cerebellum
are mossy fibers and climbing fibers, both of which are excitatory.
Climbing fibers originate in the inferior olivary nucleus, enter the
cerebellum via the inferior cerebellar peduncle, and synapse directly
onto Purkinje cells with a rather strong excitatory effect. Mossy fibers
affect Purkinje cells less directly, and therefore, in a relatively weak
manner. Mossy fibers synapse onto granule cells, which send out parallel fibers that interact with Purkinje cells.

CASE 27

A 6-month-old female is brought to the pediatrician by her mother. The mother
states she has noticed the child moving her eyes back and forth for no apparent reason over the past several weeks, and as a result, is concerned that her
daughter may have vision problems. The patient’s chart shows that she had an
uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery and has been meeting her developmental milestones. On examination the pediatrician notes involuntary, rhythmic,
horizontal eye movements. The remainder of the examination is normal. Based
on the patient’s history, the physician decides that the patient’s disorder is most
likely congenital.

ANSWERS TO CASE 27: EYE MOVEMENTS
Summary: A 6 months old female presents with several weeks of abnormal eye
movements. Physical examination demonstrates horizontal nystagmus and is
otherwise normal.

◆

Eye movements: Nystagmus which are involuntary, rhythmic,
horizontal eye movements.

◆

Treatment options: In most cases there is no treatment for congenital
nystagmus. Some patients may, however, qualify for surgical intervention
intended to mitigate the effect the nystagmus has on visual acuity.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Congenital nystagmus is the most common form of nystagmus. Typically, the
patient’s visual acuity is only mildly affected and the patient has little awareness of the movements. The etiology of congenital nystagmus is unknown,
although it may be caused by a disruption in the nuclei which influence eye
movements. Nystagmus may also be acquired and present after neurological
trauma, ischemic episodes, or cerebrovascular accidents.

Describe the various types of eye movements.
Know the centers for eye movement control found in the brain stem,

Definitions
Convergence: The medial rectus muscles contract to move both eyes
toward the midline in order to keep the image in each eye focused.
Saccades: Rapid conjugated eye movements that move the visual axis from
one point of fixation to another.
Smooth-pursuit movements: Slow conjugate eye movements that track a
moving object and keep it on the fovea.
Optokinetic reflex movements: Stabilizing movements which occur
after a retinal slip, when the entire visual field moves with respect to
the head.
Vestibular-ocular reflex: Eye movements that occur in response to
vestibular signals from movement of the head that move the eyes in an
equal and opposite direction in order to keep a stationary image.

CLINICAL CASES

219

Vergence: Converging or diverging the eyes to keep both foveae aligned to
a target that moves closer or farther away.

DISCUSSION
Several different types of movements are used to provide the delicate control
of the eyes necessary to keep the image from a viewed object placed on the
macula. The macula lies near the center of the retina and has the fovea at its
center. This is the area of the retina with the highest visual acuity.
The extraocular muscles facilitate three basic movements: horizontal eye
movements, vertical eye movements, and rotary eye movements. Horizontal
eye movements are principally controlled by the medial rectus and lateral
rectus muscles. Vertical eye movements are mainly mediated by the inferior
and superior rectus muscles. Rotary eye movements are primarily controlled
by the inferior and superior oblique muscles. These muscles are innervated
by cranial nerves leaving the brain stem. The abducens nerve or sixth cranial
nerve innervates the lateral rectus muscle for abduction of the eye. The
trochlear nerve or fourth cranial nerve innervates the superior oblique muscle, pulling the eye down and out. The remainder of the eye muscles is innervated by the oculomotor nerve, or third cranial nerve.
All normal eye movements are synchronized, allowing both eyes to focus
on the same image. To achieve this level of control, a delicate balance of excitatory and inhibitory stimuli must be sent to the synergistic and antagonistic
muscle groups. The varying degrees of tension between the extraocular muscles permits smooth, coordinated movement. Damage to the extraocular muscles or the neurological mechanisms which control their movement can lead
to a deficit between the coordination of the eyes, resulting in diplopia, or
double vision.
There are five types of eye movements that interact in order to place a
viewed object on the fovea for best visual resolution, and to keep it there as
either the object or the observer moves. These five eye movements may be
either voluntarily or reflexively controlled and include the following: saccade
movements, smooth-pursuit movements, vergence movements, vestibuloocular movements, and optokinetic movements.
Saccades are rapid, conjugate movements that place the desired image on
the fovea. These movements are rapid and accurate to allow for object fixation.
Saccades allow the entire visual field to be assessed by compensating for the
decrease in visual acuity that occurs as an image moves away from the fovea.
There are several types of saccades. Volitional saccades direct the gaze to
either a remembered location or a location where a target will likely appear. A
reflexive saccade can be stimulated by a nonvisual stimulus such as a sound.
The frontal eye fields in the precentral sulcus initiate volitional and reflexive
saccades. The parietal eye fields in the posterior parietal cortex mediate visually guided saccades of both volitional and reflexive types. There are, however,
interconnections between the frontal and parietal eye fields, with each influencing

220

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

the other. Input from the cerebral cortex travels to the contralateral paramedian
pontine reticular formation (PPRF). These inputs come directly from the
frontal eye fields, and come by way of the superior colliculus from the parietal eye fields.
During horizontal saccades, the PPRF sends signals to the abducens
nucleus of cranial nerve VI to activate both abducens neurons and interneurons. These signals then travel to the lateral rectus muscle and through the
interneurons to the medial longitudinal fasciculus in order to signal the contralateral oculomotor nucleus of cranial nerve III for coordinated movement
of the medial rectus muscle. The nucleus prepositus hypoglossi projects
information to the abducens nucleus about the current position of the head and
eyes in order to hold the eyes on target until the end of the saccade.
Vertical saccades also use the PPRF pathway, however, impulses from the
PPRF relay through eye movement centers in the midbrain before reaching the
motor nuclei. The tegmentum of the rostral midbrain contains the rostral
interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fasciculus and the interstitial
nucleus of Cajal. These nuclei regulate vertical and torsional saccades through
connections to the oculomotor and trochlear motor nuclei.
Large, acute lesions of the cerebral hemispheres can affect saccade movements in the direction contralateral to the side of the lesion. The eyes will often
deviate toward the side of the lesion. These deficits are usually temporary
because of the ability of other pathways to compensate. Lesions of the pons
will result in similar deficits, but affect eye movements toward the ipsilateral
side of the lesion. A cerebellar lesion can cause small, dyssymmetric saccades
and difficulty maintaining off-center gaze.
Smooth-pursuit movements allow an object to be tracked as it moves
slowly through a visual field. These movements keep the desired image on the
retina. The movements themselves are involuntarily; however, they do require
the observer’s attention to be focused on the object. If pursuit movements fail,
saccades are needed to catch up with the target. Visual inputs to the temporooccipital junction carry information about the speed and direction of movement of a target and initiate pursuit movements. Information is projected via
corticopontine fibers to the ipsilateral dorsolateral pontine nuclei and from
there to the cerebellar vermis, flocculus, vestibular nuclei, and nucleus
prepositus hypoglossi. From here the contralateral abducens nucleus and the
medial rectus subnucleus of the oculomotor nerve are activated via the medial
longitudinal fasciculus.
Vestibulo-ocular movements are reflexive movements of the eye in the
opposite direction of a head movement, preventing an object from moving
away from the fovea as the head moves. These eye movements occur with
the same velocity as the head, allowing the image to remain stable on the
retina. These movements can occur along any visual axis. The pathway for
these movements begins with signals from the semicircular canals that
travel to the vestibular nuclei. The fibers of the vestibular nerve enter the
medulla oblongata and pass between the inferior peduncle and the spinal

CLINICAL CASES

221

tract of the trigeminal. They then divide into ascending and descending
fibers. The latter end by arborizing around the cells of the medial nucleus.
The ascending fibers either end in the same manner or in the lateral nucleus.
Some of the axons of the cells of the lateral nucleus, and possibly also of
the medial nucleus, are continued upward through the inferior peduncle to
the roof nuclei of the opposite side of the cerebellum, to which also other
fibers of the vestibular root are prolonged without interruption in the nuclei
of the medulla oblongata. A second set of fibers from the medial and lateral
nuclei end partly in the tegmentum, while the remainder ascends in the
medial longitudinal fasciculus to arborize around the cells of the nuclei of
the oculomotor nerve.
Vergence movements allow an image to remain in focus when the object’s
depth is changing relative to the observer. They occur together with pupillary
contraction and accommodation and change the visual axis of the eyes relative
to each other through either convergence or divergence. The activation of the
vergence system results from a blurred image or from an image falling on noncorresponding retinal areas. Signals from the posterior temporal and prefrontal
cortex project to vergence cells in the brain stem and from there to cranial
nerves III and VI.
Optokinetic movements occur in response to retinal slip during prolonged
head movement at a constant velocity. Initially, the vestibulo-ocular system
will produce compensatory eye movements in response to head acceleration,
but these movements will fade as the motion of the endolymph in the semicircular canals reaches equilibrium and the vestibular input ceases. The optokinetic movements will then begin to compensate for retinal slip. The indirect
optokinetic pathway consists of signals between the temporo-occipital cortex
and the accessory optic system nuclei. The direct optokinetic pathway consists of input from retinal ganglion cell axons to the nucleus of the optic tract
and nuclei of the accessory optic system, which then project to the cerebellum and vestibular nuclei.

A 43-year-old woman comes into your office with the complaint of
inability to look to the left. This problem has been going on for
several months, with increasing frequency. She is now totally incapable of looking at objects on her left side without turning her
head. On examination, she is unable to voluntarily direct either of
her eyes toward the left side. If she follows a finger with her eyes,
however, beginning in the right visual field, she can track the
object as it crosses midline all the way to the lateral extent of normal ocular movement. She finds this quite distressing. Which of
the following structures is most likely damaged resulting in this
woman’s symptoms?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Right frontal eye field
Left frontal eye field
Right PPRF
Left rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF

Answers
[27.1]

D. Tracking a moving object with the eyes with a stationary head is
known as smooth pursuit. This seemingly simple action is in fact
quite a complicated action requiring the appropriate interaction of
numerous levels of the brain and spinal cord. Smooth pursuit movements are initiated in the visual association areas of the parietooccipital cortex, which transmit information about the speed and
direction of object motion to dorsolateral pontine nuclei. These in turn
project to the cerebellum (particularly the flocculus) and the vestibular nuclei, which project to the abducens and oculomotor nuclei for
final control of the extraocular muscles.

[27.2]

B. The type of eye movement described is called vergence, and it is
initiated by blurred images perceived by the visual cortex or by
images falling on noncorresponding parts of the retinas. The exact
pathway responsible for vergence has not been elucidated, but it is
thought to involve the visual association cortex sending projections
to vergence nuclei in the midbrain which then project to the oculomotor nuclei to control the final eye movements. Frontal eye fields

CLINICAL CASES

223

initiate voluntary saccades, angular motion is the stimulus for
vestibulo-ocular reflexes, and the accessory optic nuclei control
optokinetic movements.
[27.3]

A. This woman has a defect in voluntary saccadic movements toward
left, which are initiated by the right frontal eye field. That she can
track an object past midline indicates that the nuclei responsible for
ocular movement and the extraocular muscles are all intact, and that
the defect is higher than that. The frontal eye field projects to the contralateral PPRF, directly and via the parietal eye field and the superior
colliculus. The PPRF then sends signal to the ipsilateral abducens
nucleus, which control the lateral rectus and sends impulses to the
contralateral oculomotor nucleus to control the medial rectus. This
causes both eyes to deviate away from the frontal eye field initiating
the movement. The right PPRF is involved in voluntary saccades
toward the right side, and the rostral interstitial nucleus of the MLF
is involved in vertical saccades.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
The hypothalamus is responsible for various dimensions of homeostasis, one
of which is water balance. Vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (ADH), is produced in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus. The
neuron cell bodies in these nuclei have axons that descend into the median
eminence, pituitary stalk, and then into the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland
where they are stored. Plasma osmolality stimulates ADH release directly
from the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei and indirectly from osmoreceptors in other hypothalamic nuclei. Volume-sensitive pathways can also regulate ADH release. Baroreceptors and mechanoreceptors in the aortic arch,
carotid sinus, and right atrium can signal for ADH release in times of volume
depletion.
ADH stimulates aquaporin channels to open in the luminal membranes of
the cortical and medullary collecting tubules of the kidney to promote water
reabsorption. Treatment of DI consists of administering synthetic ADH, or
DDAVP, to compensate for low levels of ADH.

Prolactin-releasing hormone: It stimulates prolactin release from the
anterior pituitary.
Oxytocin: It is produced by the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei and
migrates into the posterior pituitary.

DISCUSSION
The hypothalamus is a bilateral structure that resides on the sides and floor of
the third ventricle. It has three general functions: autonomic regulation,
endocrine regulation, and circadian regulation. The hypothalamus is comprised of three different zones. The periventricular zone, which borders the
third ventricle, has neuroendocrine functions. The medial zone, which is bound
laterally by the fornix, functions in autonomic and neuroendocrine control of
the enteric system. The lateral zone, which is bound medially by the fornix and
laterally by the internal capsule, functions in autonomic and neuroendocrine
control of the cardiovascular system. The circuitry of the hypothalamus is very
complex, and many of its neuronal connections are bidirectional. It sends and
receives information via the blood stream—through the pituitary by way of the
hypophyseal-portal system and through circumventricular organs, sites at
which the blood–brain barrier is highly permeable and allows passage of chemical stimuli into the brain. The hypothalamus is the key brain site for the integration of multiple biologic systems to maintain homeostasis.
These functions are executed by the various nuclei of the hypothalamus
(see Figure 28-1). The paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei have already
been discussed. The anterior nucleus is responsible for regulating the dissipation of heat from the body. It also stimulates the parasympathetic nervous
system. A lesion will cause hyperthermia. The posterior nucleus regulates
heat conservation. It also stimulates the sympathetic nervous system. A lesion
will cause hypothermia. A lesion of the dorsomedial nucleus will result in
savage behavior. The ventromedial nucleus regulates satiety. A lesion will
result in obesity and savage behavior. The preoptic nucleus is responsible for
regulating gonadotropin release. The suprachiasmatic nucleus controls circadian rhythms. A lesion will result in disruption of sleep–wake cycles. The
lateral nucleus regulates the desire to eat. A lesion will result in starvation.
The mamillary body receives input from the hippocampal formation by way
of fibers in the fornix. Hemorrhagic lesions are found in the mamillary nuclei
in Wernicke’s encephalopathy. The arcuate nucleus has axons projected back
to the hypophyseal portal system, where they release dopamine to inhibit
prolactin release from the anterior pituitary gland.

Many authors divide hypothalamic dysfunction into global and partial.
In global dysfunction, many or all of the hypothalamic functions are
deranged. Common causes are usually systemic in nature. Sarcoidosis,
metastatic cancer, idiopathic inflammatory diseases, and germ cell cancers
all participate in global hypothalamic dysfunction. Partial hypothalamic
dysfunction results when only one of the hormones is disturbed, as in the
case of DI.
Syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH)
occurs when there is an unnecessary release of ADH. Common triggers
include neurosurgical procedures, head trauma, neoplasms, CNS infections,
and autoimmune disorders like Guillain-Barre syndrome. Often the initial
finding is dilutional hyponatremia without edema in the setting of low osmolality and high urine specific gravity (> 300 mosm/L). Treatment is simple: free
water restriction or in the case of seizures secondary to hyponatremia, 3%

CLINICAL CASES

229

NaCl with sodium correction no greater than 12 mEq/L in the first 24 hours
and no greater than 20 mEq/L in 48 hours. This avoids the debilitating sequelae of central pontine demyelinolysis. Another common cause of hyponatremia in neurosurgical patients is cerebral salt wasting. Unlike SIADH,
where there is too much water in the serum-diluting sodium, in cerebral salt
wasting there is a volume contraction because of loss of salt in the urine. Thus,
patients with cerebral salt wasting will have a suboptimal fluid balance and
high levels of urine sodium, which is the opposite of SIADH patients. Thus, it
is crucial to assess a patient’s volume status and urine sodium before instituting treatment. For example, fluid restricting a patient with presumed SIADH
could have detrimental effects on the renal, cardiovascular, and neurological
systems of a patient who is actually volume depleted in the setting of cerebral
salt wasting.
DI is a disease characterized by excretion of large amounts of severely
diluted urine, which cannot be reduced when fluid intake is reduced. It
denotes inability of the kidney to concentrate urine. DI is caused by a deficiency of ADH, also known as vasopressin, or by an insensitivity of the
kidneys to that hormone. The regulation of urine production occurs in the
hypothalamus, which produces ADH (or vasopressin) in the supraoptic and
paraventricular nuclei. After synthesis, the hormone is transported in neurosecretory granules down the axon of the hypothalamic neuron to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, where it is stored for later release. In
addition, the hypothalamus regulates the sensation of thirst in the ventromedial nucleus by sensing increases in serum osmolarity and relaying this
information to the cortex. The main effector organ for fluid homeostasis is
the kidney. ADH acts by increasing water permeability in the collecting
ducts, specifically it acts on proteins called aquaporins which open to
allow water into the collecting duct cells. This increase in permeability
allows for reabsorption of water into the bloodstream, thus concentrating
the urine.

Answers
[28.1]

C. The suprachiasmatic nucleus, located just superior to the optic
chiasm, is responsible for controlling circadian rhythm. The free
running time of the cycle generated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus
is about 25 hours, but it receives input directly from the retina, and
therefore alters its generated frequency to match the actual length of
the day.

[28.2]

D. The ventromedial nucleus is considered the “satiety center” of the
hypothalamus, and at least in laboratory animals, lesioning this nucleus
bilaterally results in animals that eat uncontrollably and become morbidly obese. Because the hypothalamus is so small in humans, however, lesions of a single nucleus, let along bilateral lesions of a nucleus
are extremely rare. The lateral nucleus is considered the “feeding center” of the hypothalamus, and bilateral lesions of it in laboratory animals results in animals that have no interest in eating and will actually
starve to death with food accessible.

[28.3]

A. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus is responsible for
secreting factors that stimulate or inhibit release of pituitary hormones.

CLINICAL CASES

231

Among these factors is TRH (thyrotropin-releasing hormone), which
travels through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary
where it stimulates thyrotropes to release TSH (thyroid-stimulating
hormone). Low TSH in the face of low levels of thyroid hormone
either indicates a defect in the thyrotropes of the pituitary, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, or in the connection between the
two. The paraventricular nucleus sends axons down the pituitary stalk
to the posterior lobe of the pituitary where it releases ADH and oxytocin directly into the bloodstream.

ANSWERS TO CASE 29: NEUROENDOCRINE AXIS
Summary: A 51-year-old man is noted to have physical findings of GH excess,
so called acromegaly.

◆

Diagnosis: GH releasing neoplasms most frequently occur in the
anterior pituitary gland. Here, somatotropes are activated by growth
hormone–releasing hormone (GHRH) secreted from the hypothalamus.
The final point about a bitemporal homonymous hemianopia should be
the convincing point that the lesion localizes to the pituitary gland.

◆

Confirmation of diagnosis: There are a series of diagnostic tests that
should be performed on this patient. IGF-1 levels seem to be the most
sensitive and useful laboratory test for the diagnosis of this condition.
An MRI of the head should also be performed to evaluate the extent of
tumor growth and compression of structures surrounding the sella
turcica. Because assessing random levels of GH does not provide
accurate information secondary to the inconsistent secretion of GH, GH
levels should be measured after administration of a glucose load
(normally, GH is suppressed by glucose).

CLINICAL CORRELATION
This patient exhibits the typical features of acromegaly: a large bulbous nose,
enlarged auricles, a protruding jaw, and sausage-shaped fingers. Because this
patient is an adult with fused epiphyseal plates, he does not exhibit features of
gigantism that children with GH-releasing neoplasms exhibit. Most commonly, acromegaly is caused by a GH-producing tumor derived from somatotrophic cells in the anterior pituitary gland. The excess GH stimulates the
liver to secrete even more IGF-1, the primary mediator of the growthpromoting effects of GH. Research shows that many of these pituitary tumors
contain a mutation involving the alpha subunit of a stimulatory guanosine
triphosphate (GTP)–binding protein, which leads to a persistent elevation of
cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in the somatotrophs, resulting in
excessive GH secretion. Diagnosis of this condition is critical as the disease
can lead to early death if unchecked. Diagnosis involves measuring IGF-1 levels, an MRI of the brain focusing on the sella turcica, and measuring GH levels after administration of glucose.

Definitions
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH): Released from the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone.
Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): Released from the anterior
pituitary and stimulates the adrenal gland to produce glucocorticoids.
GH: Released from the anterior pituitary and stimulates the peripheral tissues to release IGF-1.
Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH):
Released from the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates estrogen/progesterone production in females and testosterone production in males.
Both hormones have roles in gametogenesis.
Prolactin-inhibiting factor (PIF): Most likely dopamine; secreted from
the hypothalamus and results in inhibition of PRL release from the anterior pituitary.
Prolactin (PRL): Released from the anterior pituitary gland and stimulates
lactation at the breast.
Vasopressin (VP): Also known as ADH. This hormone is created in the
hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary to cause water
reabsorption in the collecting ducts.

DISCUSSION
The hypothalamic nuclei responsible for production and secretion of the
releasing hormones include the periventricular, preoptic, arcuate, and
paraventricular nuclei. The axons of neurons that produce the releasing
hormones targeted for the anterior pituitary terminate at the base of the
hypothalamus in a region of tissue called the median eminence. Here, a
microvascular network of capillaries and veins formed by penetrating
branches of the superior hypophyseal artery forms a portal system for
hormone delivery to the anterior pituitary. The portal system carries the
releasing hormones from the tuberoinfundibular system and bathes them
around the cells of the anterior pituitary. The cell bodies that produce VP
and oxytocin project their axons through the median eminence and into the
posterior pituitary, where they terminate around capillaries formed by the
inferior hypophyseal artery. The anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary subsequently secrete stimulating hormones that act on various end
organs.
Interestingly, the secretion of both releasing and stimulating hormones
occurs in a pulsatile fashion. Disruption of this rhythmicity can lead to corruption of the regulatory functions of the neuroendocrine axis. Although there
are multiple levels of internal regulation within the neuroendocrine axis, the
principle factor governing hormone secretion is negative feedback inhibition
by end-organ hormones on the hypothalamic releasing factors.

236

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

TRH and TSH
Neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus are responsible
for production of TRH. TRH stimulates TSH secretion which results in thyroid
hormone production within the thyroid gland itself. Thyroid hormone affects
protein synthesis and metabolic activity in all organ systems. Thyroid hormone
is essential for fetal and neonatal development. Hypothyroidism can cause
devastating central nervous system developmental abnormalities during the
first 3 months of fetal development. Thyroid hormone circulates and will negatively inhibit both TRH and TSH release by acting on both the hypothalamus
and thyroid gland.

CRH and ACTH
This subsection of the neuroendocrine axis is intimately involved in the
stress response as well as establishing basal levels of cortisol. CRH is synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus and descends into the anterior pituitary through the portal system where it stimulates ACTH release. ACTH
will enter the systemic circulation and bind to cells in the cortical layer of
the adrenal gland. This binding will activate glucocorticoid production.
Although this process can occur in response to stresses such as sepsis, there
is a rhythmic release of these hormones resulting in peak cortisol levels just
before waking and lowest levels before midnight. Similarly to thyroid hormone, cortisol circulates to negatively inhibit both the hypothalamus and
pituitary gland. Interestingly, acute stress phases result in improved memory
and learning while chronic levels of elevated cortisol result in poorer hippocampal function.

GHRH and GH
The hypothalamus produces both GHRH and somatostatin to stimulate and
inhibit GH release, respectively. There are a couple of major differences in
both the action and regulation of GH compared to both TSH and ACTH. First,
GH lacks a specific organ target. It acts on a variety of tissues to stimulate anabolic drive. Also, GH only feeds back onto the hypothalamus rather than both
the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to inhibit its own secretion. GH stimulates IGF-1 in its target tissues and both hormones stimulate an anabolic
drive. However, where GH only negatively inhibits the hypothalamus, IGF-1
negatively inhibits both the hypothalamus and pituitary.

GnRH and FSH/LH
GnRH is produced diffusely throughout the hypothalamus and travels into the
anterior pituitary along the hypophyseal portal system. In males, LH stimulates Leydig cell production of testosterone. FSH and testosterone act in concert

CLINICAL CASES

237

to stimulate spermatogenesis. Testosterone also results in secondary sexual
characteristics in males. In females FSH stimulates ovarian follicle formation.
Both FSH and LH control the timing of ovulation as well as estrogen and progesterone production. Analogous to males, these sex steroids are responsible for
the secondary sexual characteristics in females.

PIF and PRL
Prolactin (PRL) is different from the other hormones secreted by the anterior
pituitary in that it does not have a secreting factor. Instead, it is tonically inhibited by PIF, which is most likely dopamine. Sucking decreased levels of PIF,
which allows PRL to be secreted and stimulates lactation.

Oxytocin
Oxytocin is synthesized in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the
hypothalamus and released directly into the systemic circulation. Its major
functions are stimulation of uterine contractions and assisting the flow of milk
during lactation.

Vasopressin
Vasopressin is another hormone produced in the hypothalamus and directly
released into the circulation at the posterior pituitary. It has multiple effects
including vasoconstriction and renal regulation of water homeostasis.
Treatment for these tumors is usually multimodal, utilizing a combination of medical and surgical therapies. Often first-line therapy is surgical
resection of the tumor by a neurosurgeon. The medical therapies including
use of a dopamine agonist, somatostatin, and GH receptor antagonists are
all indicated.

A 32-year-old woman is being evaluated for infertility. Her husband’s
sperm count and function was normal, and she has no apparent abnormalities with her ovaries or reproductive tract. On testing, however, it
is found that she has very low levels of FSH and LH. Consideration
is being given to administration of GnRH to induce FSH/LH secretion from the pituitary. Which of the following is critical to remember in the administration of GnRH for this purpose?
A.
B.
C.
D.

It must be administered at the same time each day.
It must be administered at an increased dose each day.
It must be administered in a pulsatile fashion.
It must be administered intracerebrally.

Answers
[29.1]

B. This is an example of negative feedback. In the normally functioning neuroendocrine system, the hypothalamus releases CRH,
which causes the pituitary to release ACTH, which causes the adrenal glands to secrete cortisol. When the level of cortisol in the blood
becomes high enough, it exerts inhibitory signals on both the hypothalamus and pituitary through a process known as negative feedback. When a patient is taking exogenous steroids, they are not
measurable as cortisol but they act in the same way on the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, suppressing CRH and ACTH secretion.
Most of the hypothalamic-pituitary-endocrine organ systems work in
a similar manner as well.

[29.2]

B. PRL is tonically inhibited from being released by dopamine.
For this reason, when patients are placed on antidopaminergic drugs
(some antipsychotics) they can develop gynecomastia and nipple discharge. One of the interesting things about PRL is that its regulation
is different than that of the other anterior pituitary hormones. The rest
are under stimulatory control, released from the adenohypophysis
when the releasing factor is present in the hypophyseal portal system.

CLINICAL CASES

[29.3]

239

C. All of the hypothalamic releasing hormones with the exception of
TRH are released in a pulsatile fashion, GnRH included. If they are
not pulsatile, they have decreased efficacy. Constant, high levels of
GnRH actually serve to inhibit pituitary release of FSH and LH, producing the opposite effect that we are looking for in this patient. The
normal pulse frequency of GnRH is approximately once every hour,
so in order to induce ovulation in this patient, the medication must be
administered that often via IV. This is a difficult regimen to adhere to,
and for this reason women are often treated with FSH supplements
rather than GnRH supplements, it is easier and more convenient and
achieves similar results.

ANSWERS TO CASE 30: HYPERTHERMIA
Summary: A 55-year-old female marathon runner is complaining of headache
and cramps, also experiencing confusion, nausea, elevated pulse, and red skin.

◆
◆

Normal body temperature: 36°C–37°C.
Brain region: Body temperature regulation is controlled primarily by
the hypothalamus.

◆

Treatment options: Rehydration with water; rest in cool conditions.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Hyperthermia is an acute condition that occurs when the body absorbs more heat
than it can dissipate causing abnormally high body temperatures. Temperatures
above 40°C are life threatening, and brain death begins at 41°C. Common signs
include confusion, headache, muscle cramps, and nausea. Severe confusion may
lead patients to become hostile and act intoxicated. High temperatures will cause
excessive perspiration until dehydration occurs. Acute dehydration causes blood
pressure to drop significantly, possibly leading to dizziness or even fainting, especially when standing suddenly. To counter the drop in blood pressure, increased
heart rate (tachycardia) and respiration rate (tachypnea) occur to increase the oxygen supply to the body. Cutaneous blood vessels dilate to increase heat dissipation,
resulting in a red skin color. As heat stroke progresses, blood vessels constrict to
help increase blood pressure, then causing a paler, bluish skin color. Eventually
body organs begin to fail until unconsciousness and coma result. Demographically,
studies have shown that women and the elderly are at greater risk for heat stroke.
Proper treatment of heat stroke includes immediate hospitalization. Patient’s body
temperature must be lowered quickly. Methods include moving patient to cool
areas with fans or air conditioning, removing patient’s clothes, and submerging
patient in cold water bath. Additionally, rehydration is critical, and is achieved by
drinking large amounts of water and isotonic beverages (eg, Gatorade).

1.
2.

Know the ways and means to prevent hypothermia.
Know the responses to temperature-increasing and temperaturedecreasing mechanisms.

Definitions
Homeotherm: An organism, such as a mammal or bird, having a body temperature that is constant and largely independent of the temperature of
its surroundings; an endotherm; “warm-blooded.”

CLINICAL CASES

243

Poikilotherm: An organism, such as a fish or reptile, having a body temperature that varies with the temperature of its surroundings; an ectotherm;
“cold-blooded.”
Preoptic area: A region of the brain that is situated immediately below the
anterior commissure, above the optic chiasma, on the anterior side of the
hypothalamus that regulates certain autonomic activities often with
other portions of the hypothalamus.
Thermoreceptor: A sensory receptor that responds to heat and cold.
Piloerection: Involuntary erection or bristling of hairs owing to a sympathetic reflex usually triggered by cold, shock, or fright or caused by a
sympathomimetic agent.
Thyroxine (T4): An iodine-containing hormone, C15H11I4NO4, produced
by the thyroid gland, that increases the rate of cell metabolism and regulates growth.

DISCUSSION
Thermoregulation is the ability of an organism to maintain its body temperature within certain boundaries, even when the environmental temperature is
different. Like all mammals, humans are homeothermic, or “warm-blooded.”
Human core temperature is about 37°C. Many nonmammals, such as reptiles
and fish, are poikilotherms, or “cold-blooded” organisms.
Thermoregulation is controlled primarily by nervous feedback mechanisms
operating through the hypothalamus. The thermostatic center is found in the
anterior portion of the hypothalamus in the preoptic area. This area has a
large number of heat-sensitive neurons (warm receptors) and about a third as
many cold-sensitive neurons (cold receptors).
There are two general types of thermoreceptors: warm receptors and
cold receptors. The axons of warm receptors are unmyelinated, slowly conducting C fibers, while the axons of cold receptors are lightly myelinated,
faster conducting Aδ fibers. The receptive fields of thermoreceptors are
small spots of approximately 1 mm in glabrous skin and 3-5 mm in hairy
skin. About three to four spots are innervated by a single axon. At normal
body temperature, both warm and cold spots discharge, but as temperatures
increase, cold spots reduce their firing frequency while warm spots increase
their firing. Activation of warm-sensitive receptors (temperatures above
37°C) results in activation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and lateral hypothalamus to increase parasympathetic outflow and increase heat
dissipation. Warm-sensitive receptors have inhibitory connections on coldsensitive neurons. Increased discharge in cold-sensitive neurons results in
activation of neurons in the paraventricular nucleus and the posterior
hypothalamus to increase sympathetic outflow in order to generate and conserve heat. Cold-sensitive neurons do not have intrinsic temperature receptors, but instead increase their discharge by the decrease in the discharge rate
of warm-sensitive neurons.

244

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Unlike the preoptic area, the skin has far more cold receptors than warm
receptors. This signifies that peripheral temperature detection is mainly concerned with distinguishing cool and cold rather than warm temperatures, probably in order to prevent hypothermia.
The temperature sensory signals from the peripheral thermoreceptors in the
skin and mucous membranes and those from the internal central thermoreceptors in the hypothalamic preoptic area are transmitted bilaterally to a specific
area in the posterior hypothalamus, at the level of the mamillary bodies. Here
the signals are combined to control the heat-conserving and heat-producing
mechanisms of the body.
The hypothalamus works together with higher cortical centers to keep core
body temperature constant. Responses range from involuntary (mediated by
the autonomic nervous system and neurohormones), to semivoluntary and voluntary behavioral responses.

Responses to Cold—Temperature-Increasing Mechanisms
Cold environments cool blood flowing into the skin and stimulate the skin’s cold
receptors. When blood temperature drops below normal, the neurons stimulate
regions in the caudal hypothalamus responsible for mechanisms of heat conservation, initiating a variety of responses to promote heat gain and inhibit heat
loss. Involuntary responses, which involve activation of the sympathetic nervous system, include the following:
1.

2.
3.

Vasoconstriction. Release of norepinephrine from the sympathetic
fibers constricts cutaneous blood vessels, thereby reducing blood flow
and heat loss to the cold air.
Piloerection. Contraction of the arrectores pilorum (stimulated by α1
adrenoreceptors) causes piloerection trapping warm air close to the skin.
Increased heat production. Sympathetic excitation and shivering allow
for increased thermogenesis.

Cellular metabolism can be increased via sympathetic stimulation or circulating epinephrine and norepinephrine in the blood. This is called chemical
thermogenesis. Epinephrine and norepinephrine have the ability to uncouple
oxidative phosphorylation, allowing excess foodstuffs to be oxidized, releasing heat energy. The amount of brown fat, a type of fat that contains large numbers of special mitochondria where uncoupled oxidation occurs, is
proportional to the amount of chemical thermogenesis in an organism. Infants,
who have small amounts of brown fat, are able to use this process to double
heat production. However adults, who have nearly no brown fat, are only able
to increase heat production 10-15% via this process.
Another form of chemical thermogenesis involves increased cellular metabolism caused by thyroxine. Cooling the hypothalamic preoptic area causes an
increase in production and secretion of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)
by the hypothalamus. TRH travels through the portal veins to the anterior

CLINICAL CASES

245

pituitary, where it stimulates secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
TSH then stimulates the thyroid to release thyroxine (T4), which increases the
body’s metabolic rate.
Shivering is controlled by the primary motor center for shivering, found in the
dorsomedial posterior hypothalamus. This center is usually excited by cold
signals from the skin and spinal cord, and inhibited by warm signals from the
hypothalamic preoptic area. When body temperatures fall too low, the center will
transmit signals that cause shivering through bilateral tracts down the brain stem,
the lateral columns of the spinal cord, and eventually to the anterior motor neurons, which stimulate an increase in the tone of skeletal muscles around the
body. Shivering begins when muscle tone reaches and rises above a critical level,
and can increase heat production up to four or five times that of normal.
More voluntary responses include increased physical activity, such as pacing and hand rubbing, and behavioral changes, such as wearing extra clothing
and huddling in groups. These voluntary behaviors are activated mainly by the
cerebral cortex and limbic system.

Responses to Heat—Temperature-Decreasing Mechanisms
Body temperature rises when the body is exposed to excess heat. The skin’s warm
receptors and higher blood temperature signal the hypothalamus to inhibit
adrenergic activity of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to metabolic rate
reduction and cutaneous vasodilation. Responses to heat include the following:
1.

2.

3.

Vasodilation. Inhibition of the sympathetic centers in the posterior
hypothalamus causes cutaneous vasodilation, allowing for increased
blood flow and greater heat loss via the skin.
Sweating. In particularly warm conditions, the hypothalamus signals the
cholinergic sympathetic fibers to release acetylcholine in order to stimulate the muscarinic cholinergic receptors on the eccrine sweat glands
to induce sweat. Eccrine sweat glands are found all around the body, but
are most prevalent on the palms, soles, and forehead. Heat is then lost via
the evaporation of sweat from the skin, at a rate of about 0.58 kcal/mL.
Decrease in heat production. All mechanisms involved in heat production and conservation are severely inhibited.

Voluntary behavioral responses to heat, such as resting, wearing less clothing, fanning, and drinking cold fluids help with heat loss as well.
Fever is a medical condition that describes a temporary increase in the
body’s thermoregulatory set-point (usually by about 1°C-2°C). Fever differs
from hyperthermia in that during a fever, the body’s thermoregulatory setpoint itself is elevated, whereas in hyperthermia, body temperature rises above
the set-point. The increase in thermoregulatory set-point in the hypothalamus
during a fever can be attributed to the activity of the cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and
TNF-α. It is important to note that fever is not a medical condition itself, but
rather a symptom of other pathology.

Answers
[30.1]

A. Thermoreceptors in the skin are responsible for responses to
cold. There are two areas in the body in which thermoreceptors are
located: the skin and the anterior hypothalamus, specifically the
preoptic area. These areas do not behave the same, however. There
are significantly more cold receptors than warm in the skin, and
more warm receptors than cold in the hypothalamus. This means

CLINICAL CASES

247

that skin-based thermoreceptors are more important for detecting
cold conditions and hypothermia, while hypothalamic receptors are
more important for detecting warm conditions and hyperthermia.
Of course in an extreme example such as this, both the skin and the
hypothalamic thermoreceptors would be generating signals to conserve/generate body heat.
[30.2]

B. The posterior hypothalamus generates the signals that cause an
increase in heat conserving and producing behaviors. The posterior
hypothalamus is also involved in sympathetic outflow, which is
important in heat conservation. Sympathetic outflow is responsible
for peripheral vasoconstriction and piloerection, both of which are
heat conserving. Shivering, which is a heat-generating mechanism,
is not mediated by the sympathetic system, but rather by the shivering center, found in the dorsomedial posterior hypothalamus.
Posterior hypothalamic projections to the cortex are involved in
the more complex behavioral responses to cold, such as putting on
more clothing, pacing, and going inside. The anterior hypothalamus, while being the location of hypothalamic thermoreceptors,
is more sensitive to heat than cold, and involved in heat-dissipating
activities.

[30.3]

D. The anterior hypothalamus is the area involved in heatdissipating activities. It receives warm signals primarily from the
preoptic hypothalamus, but also from warm receptors located in
the skin. Heat-dissipating activities include cutaneous vasodilation, achieved by sympathetic inhibition, which causes the skin to
appear very red, and sweating. All heat-conserving activities are
severely limited as well. There are also cortical responses to overheating, including fanning, removing clothing, and drinking cold
drinks.

NERVOUS SYSTEM
Summary: A 66-year-old man with frank pulmonary pathology and a heavy
smoking history, presents with a new chest mass, anisocoria, and muscle
weakness.

◆
◆

Location: Pancoast tumors are found in the apex of the lung.
Anisocoria: Tumor invasion of the sympathetic chain resulting in
ipsilateral unopposed parasympathetic tone to the papillary constrictor
muscle causing miosis.

◆

Ptosis: Also caused by tumor invasion of the sympathetic network. In
this case, loss of innervation to Muller muscle causes ptosis.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
This is a classic presentation of a Pancoast tumor that invades the apex of the
lung. These are often caused by squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.
Patients often have ipsilateral shoulder and medial arm pain. These tumors
often invade the brachial plexus but can also compromise the lower cervical
or upper thoracic spinal nerve roots. Therefore, there is often sensory loss in
the C8-T1 distributions. This results in sensory loss of the ipsilateral dorsomedial forearm and into the fifth and medial half of the fourth digits. There
is often compromise of peripheral sympathetic chain and the stellate ganglion. This results in disruption of the sympathetic tone that returns to the
head causing ptosis and miosis. Additionally, if the tumor invades the sympathetic fibers at or above the level of the carotid bifurcation, one would
expect to find anhydrosis of the entire ipsilateral face. If the tumor is distal
to this point, one would expect to find anhydrosis on the ipsilateral medial
forehead and medial ipsilateral nose. It is important to remember that disruption of the sympathetic fibers at any point from their origin in the hypothalamus to their ascension along the carotid artery can result in Horner
syndrome.

fibers of white communicating rami and the cell bodies of gray communicating rami. This is a bilateral structure.
Superior cervical ganglion: Analogous to the paravertebral ganglion but
has cell bodies of gray communicating rami that will eventually terminate in the head.
Prevertebral ganglia: The celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia where white communicating rami terminate on the cell
bodies of gray communicating rami that terminate onto most abdominal
and retroperitoneal viscera.

DISCUSSION
The sympathetic nervous system is one of the two subdivisions of the autonomic
nervous system. Together, these subdivisions govern the activity of cardiac

252

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

muscle, smooth muscle, and glands. The autonomic nervous system is regulated by combined efforts from the hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, amygdala,
and reticular formation. As with many other portions of the nervous system, it
is often easier to facilitate an anatomical discussion by dividing the pertinent
pathways and projections into their central and peripheral components.
The central organization of the sympathetic nervous system, which regulates
the “fight or flight” responses, is best understood by focusing on the hypothalamus. At this level, both afferent and efferent information is processed and the
tone of the sympathetic nervous system adjusted. Afferent visceral information
about blood pressure, respiratory drive, and gastrointestinal status are carried by
the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves to the solitary tract nucleus in the brainstem. This nucleus accepts and redirects nerve impulses to various areas of the
brain including the hypothalamus, insular cortex, amygdala, and adjacent respiratory centers in the medulla and pons. The insular cortex is involved with cardiac function. The highest levels of sympathetic control and largely efferent
output are achieved in the prefrontal, cingulate, and hippocampal cortices.
These areas both receive and project to other regions to achieve a maximal attenuation of sympathetic drive. By projecting to the hypothalamus, these cortical
areas are able to manifest their output by altering the tone of the sympathetic
nervous system. Most sympathetic fibers originate in the lateral and posterior
regions of the hypothalamus. From here they descend without crossing into the
lateral tegmentum of the midbrain, pons, medulla, and into the spinal cord.
These axons terminate in the interomediolateral cell column of the spinal cord
from C8-L2. Because the sympathetic nervous system is confined to this region
of termination, it often carries the designation of thoracolumbar. The peripheral sympathetic nervous system begins with cell bodies located in the
interomediolateral cell column of the gray matter of the spinal cord. These cell
bodies project their preganglionic myelinated axons, or white communicating
rami, through the ventral root exit zone of the spinal cord, through the ventral
rootlet, and into the spinal nerve at each level. The white communicating rami
will terminate in one of two structures: the paravertebral ganglion running
along side the vertebral column or the prevertebral ganglia in the posterior
abdominal cavity (note that the paravertebral trunks are paired structures on
both sides of the vertebral column). The three separate prevertebral ganglia
include the celiac ganglion, the superior mesenteric ganglion, and the inferior
mesenteric ganglion. By far, the majority of the sympathetic fibers traverse the
T5-L2 spinal nerves to their respective targets. The prevertebral and paravertebral ganglia accept the preganglionic sympathetic fibers and contain the cell
bodies of postganglionic unmyelinated sympathetic fibers, or gray communicating rami. The axons of these cell bodies will terminate upon their end
organ targets including sweat glands, intestinal glands, cardiac and pulmonary
tissue among others. Of note, the adrenal glands receive innervation by white
communicating rami without synapse. The postganglionic sympathetic component of the adrenal gland is considered to occur when the gland releases its
chemical product, epinephrine, into the blood stream.

CLINICAL CASES

253

In comparison to parasympathetic nervous system fibers, sympathetic preganglionic fibers are short and the postganglionic fibers are long. One preganglionic fiber innervates many postganglionic fibers, and it is this divergence
that amplifies sympathetic outputs and coordinates sympathetic activation
across different spinal levels (see Figure 31-1).
The head receives its sympathetic network from C8-T2 cord levels and terminate in the superior cervical ganglion. Postganglionic sympathetic fibers
course along the internal carotid arteries to innervate the salivary, lacrimal,
and sweat glands; smooth muscle; and blood vessels of the head. The arms
receive their postganglionic sympathetic innervation from the lower cervical
and upper thoracic ganglia. The heart receives its sympathetic tone from the
upper thoracic ganglion, while the abdominal ganglia receive their input
from T5-T9/T10. The pelvis, legs, and descending colon are supplied by the
upper lumbar ganglia.
It is important to remember that the sympathetic nervous system is not
solely a visceral motor system. As mentioned earlier, there are visceral afferent pathways too. The cell bodies of these sensory axons are located in the
dorsal sensory ganglion within the thecal sac and their afferent projections can
terminate locally on the intermediolateral cell column to affect local reflexes
or onto the dorsal horn of the spinal gray resulting in central communication
of visceral sensations such as a full bladder.
The neurotransmitter profile of the sympathetic nervous system is crucial
for understanding the pharmacological interventions employed to treat many
medial illnesses. The initial synapse of pre- and postganglionic neurons uses
acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter while the postganglionic to end organ target synapse uses norepinephrine. One exception is the adrenal medulla,
which uses acetylcholine at the synapse of the preganglionic sympathetic to
adrenal gland to stimulate release of epinephrine into the bloodstream. Two
other exceptions that utilize acetylcholine release in the postganglionic sympathetic synapse to target organ are sweat glands and blood vessels.
Sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter receptors are classified into
alpha and beta with subgroupings of alpha-1, alpha-2 and beta-1, beta-2.
Stimulation of alpha-1 receptors causes vasoconstriction, decreased gastrointestinal motility, and pupillary dilation. Alpha-2 receptors are located on the
presynaptic terminal and upon stimulation cause attenuation of neurotransmitter release into the synaptic cleft. Beta-1 receptors increase heart rate and heart
contractility. Beta-2 receptors cause vasodilation and bronchodilation.

D. In the face, the ganglion involved is the superior cervical ganglion. This man has Horner syndrome as a complication of his carotid
endarterectomy. The sympathetic nerves that innervate the face run
along the carotid artery and can be damaged (although rarely) with
excess dissection around the artery in surgery. One feature of the
sympathetic nervous system is that it has relatively short preganglionic axons, which synapse in ganglia near the spinal cord, and
long postganglionic axons that then project from these ganglia to the
end organs. Axons from cell bodies in the superior cervical ganglion
ascend along the carotid artery and then follow its branches to their
targets in the face and head. The first-order neurons that synapse in
the superior cervical ganglion have their cell bodies in the intermediolateral column of the thoracic cord.

[31.2]

A. All preganglionic autonomic neurons (sympathetic and parasympathetic) release acetylcholine at autonomic ganglia. This acetylcholine activates ganglionic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors located
on postganglionic neurons, triggering action potentials.

B. For the most part, postganglionic sympathetic neurons release
norepinephrine onto their targets, including glands and blood

vessels. The only targets that do not get norepinephrine neurotransmission are sweat glands. Sympathetic neurons innervating sweat glands
release acetylcholine onto muscarinic receptors on the sweat glands.

CASE 32

A 21-year-old previously healthy male presents to the emergency department
with right-sided eye pain for the past 2 days. He has never experienced this
symptom before. He states that he was watching his favorite movie when he
noticed that colors seen by his right eye seemed faded and less intense than
that in his left eye. Around this time he also developed worsening right eye
pain. Upon further questioning, he states that he has had episodes of worsening urinary incontinence for the past month. He was embarrassed about this so
he did not seek medical attention. He describes a strong urge to urinate but has
difficulty initiating a stream. However, he adds that he often experiences urinary
discharge when he senses no urgency at all. His cousin and sister both suffer
from systemic lupus erythematosus. Eventually he is diagnosed with multiple

ANSWERS TO CASE 32: PARASYMPATHETIC
NERVOUS SYSTEM
Summary: A 21-year-old male has urinary incontinence for the past month and
eye pain with decreased vision and color acuity.

◆
◆
◆

Mechanism of Incontinence: Compromise of the parasympathetic tone
to the detrusor muscle and external urethral sphincter resulting in
urinary incontinence secondary to an MS plaque.
Myelin: Myelin serves to protect and insulate axons, increasing
conduction velocity along them.
Myelinating cells in CNS: Oligodendrocytes myelinate axons in the
CNS. Schwann cells serve the same purpose in the peripheral nervous
system.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
MS is a demyelinating disease that can affect both the brain and spinal cord.
Traditionally, this autoimmune disorder affects patients in their twenties,
females greater than males. Twenty-five percent of patients will manifest MS
as optic neuritis. In this disease there is often orbital pain worsened with eye
movement, monocular vision loss, decreased color acuity, and a decreased
afferent papillary response in the affected eye. For the purposes of this discussion, we will focus on the bladder dysfunction. The bladder is composed
of three muscle groups: the detrusor muscle, the internal urethral sphincter,
and the external urethral sphincter. The internal sphincter is smooth muscle
and receives innervation from the lower thoracic interomediolateral segments. The preganglionic sympathetic fibers traverse into the posterior
abdominal cavity where they synapse in the inferior mesenteric ganglion.
Postganglionic sympathetic fibers innervate the smooth muscle composing
the internal urethral sphincter, causing contraction and urinary retention. The
external urethral sphincter is striated muscle and is under voluntary control.
Cell bodies in the anterolateral horns of S2, S3, and S4 (nucleus of Onuf)
send their axons along the inferior pudendal nerve to terminate onto the external sphincter, causing contraction. The detrusor muscle itself is innervated by
both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Sympathetic
fibers travel along the same pathways as the sympathetic fibers that terminate
on the internal sphincter. When they terminate on the detrusor, they cause
relaxation. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers course through the inferior
mesenteric ganglion and terminate onto postganglionic parasympathetic cell
bodies located on the bladder wall. Firing of the postganglionic parasympathetic fibers causes detrusor contraction. There is a cerebral micturition center located on the medial frontal cortex inferior to the accessory motor cortex.
This structure is responsible for conscious continence management. There is

CLINICAL CASES

259

a local reflex arc that stimulates bladder emptying based on afferent sensory
impulses from the detrusor muscle. However, the micturition center projects
fibers onto both Onuf nucleus and the cell bodies of parasympathetic preganglionic neurons to inhibit their firing. The sequence of micturition is as follows: voluntary relaxation of the perineum, flexion of abdominal wall
muscles, detrusor contraction, opening of the internal and then external
sphincters. In the case of MS, these changes take place over time. The most
common bladder manifestation is a neurogenic bladder resulting in spinal
cord white matter lesions above T12. This results in a spastic bladder and loss
of voluntary control of the external sphincter. A spastic bladder initiates an
emptying reflex at lower bladder volumes and is analogous to muscle spasticity and hyper-reflexivity seen in upper motor neuron disease. This combination leads to urgency (depending on the degree of sensation that is still
intact) and incontinence.

areas are able to manifest their output by altering the tone of the parasympathetic nervous system. Most parasympathetic fibers originate in the anterior
regions of the hypothalamus. From here they descend into the midbrain, pons
and medulla, and down the spinal cord. These axons terminate in the
interomediolateral cell column of the spinal cord from S2-S4. Because the
parasympathetic nervous system is confined to these two regions of termination, it often carries the designation of craniosacral.
The brainstem nuclei that distribute preganglionic parasympathetic outflow include the Edinger-Westphal nucleus of the oculomotor nerve, the
superior salivatory nucleus that contributes to the facial nerve, the inferior
salivatory nucleus that contributes to the glossopharyngeal nerve, and the
dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve. Together, these four cranial nerves
carry all preganglionic parasympathetic tone to the glands and blood vessels
of the head (see Figure 32-1). The Edinger-Westphal nucleus projects preganglionic parasympathetic axons along the periphery of the oculomotor
nerve as it exits the midbrain and enters the orbit through the superior
orbital fissure. Here the preganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel along
the inferior division of the oculomotor nerve and then branch off toward the
ciliary ganglion. Here they terminate and postganglionic parasympathetic
fibers innervate the sphincter muscle of the pupil and ciliary muscles allowing for miosis and convergence, respectively. The superior salivatory
nucleus projects preganglionic parasympathetic fibers along the facial nerve
as it exits the brainstem along the pontomedullary junction. These fibers
branch off the facial nerve within the greater petrosal nerve just distal to the
geniculate ganglion. These fibers reenter the cranium through the hiatus for
the greater petrosal nerve and run anteriorly along the skull base. They exit
the skull and travel to the pterygopalatine fossa where they terminate in the
pterygopalatine ganglion. Here postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel
superiorly through the inferior orbital fissure and terminate onto the
lacrimal gland causing lacrimation. Other preganglionic parasympathetic
fibers originating in the superior salivatory nucleus pass through the geniculate ganglion, travel with chorda tympani, and then follow the lingual
nerve. These fibers terminate in the submandibular ganglion. Cell bodies of
postganglionic parasympathetic fibers will then travel a short distance to
innervate the submandibular and sublingual glands. The inferior salivatory nucleus projects preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to the otic ganglion. Fibers terminate here and postganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel
to the parotid gland to provide innervation. The dorsal vagal nucleus
located in the medulla projects preganglionic parasympathetic fibers along
the vagus nerve. This nerve exits the skull through the jugular foramen and
provides widespread parasympathetic innervation of the major organ systems
of the chest and abdomen. Of note, the vagus nerve only supplies parasympathetic innervation to the ascending and transverse colon. The descending
colon and rectum are innervated by the parasympathetic elements of the
sacral spinal cord. Increased vagal tone results in bronchoconstriction,

262

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

decreased heart rate, and increased gastrointestinal motility. Unlike within the
head, the vagus nerve does not have discrete ganglia prior to reaching the target end organs. Rather, the preganglionic parasympathetic axons terminate in
the walls of their respective targets and the resulting postganglionic parasympathetic axons have a very short distance to travel. This is one of the principal structural differences between the sympathetic and parasympathetic
nervous systems. That is, the postganglionic sympathetic axon traverses a
large distance compared to the postganglionic parasympathetic axon. The
principle functions of the sacral parasympathetic system are the bladder,
descending colon, rectum, and pelvic organs.
The neurotransmitter used at both preganglionic parasympathetic/postganglionic parasympathetic and postganglionic parasympathetic/end organ
synapses is acetylcholine. The ganglionic synapse receives acetylcholine at
nicotinic receptors while the end-organ synapse receives acetylcholine at
muscarinic receptors.

Answers
[32.1]

C. These fibers originate from the dorsal motor nucleus of the
vagus nerve. Vasovagal syncope is a complicated reflex that
results from a number of stimuli, one of which can be the sight of
blood. The reflex involves increased parasympathetic outflow and
decreased sympathetic outflow, which combine to cause hypotension sufficient to cause a loss of consciousness. The increased
parasympathetic outflow causes a decrease in heart rate and
myocardial contractility, and is mediated by the vagus nerve.
Presynaptic parasympathetic neurons in vagus nerve originate in
the dorsal motor nucleus, and supply the organs of the thorax and
most of the abdominal viscera. The descending colon, rectum, and
pelvic organs, however, are supplied by the sacral parasympathetic
plexus, which originates in the sacral spinal cord. The EdingerWestphal nucleus and the inferior salivatory nucleus supply
parasympathetic innervation to organs in the head via the oculomotor and glossopharyngeal nerves.

[32.2]

B. In the thorax and abdomen, the preganglionic neurons synapse
on postganglionic neurons that reside in the walls of the organs
that they innervate, in this case in the musculature of the heart.
In general, the parasympathetic nervous system has preganglionic
neurons that extend all the way or nearly all the way to the target
organs, unlike the sympathetic nervous system, which has relatively short preganglionic neurons and long postganglionic neurons. In the head and neck, the parasympathetic preganglionic
neurons synapse on postganglionic neurons in discreet ganglia
close to the target organs such as the geniculate and pterygopalatine ganglia.

[32.3]

D. Acetylcholine is released by all neurons in the parasympathetic
nervous system, both pre- and postganglionic. The preganglionic
neurons release acetylcholine onto ganglionic nicotinic receptors on
the postganglionic neurons, which release acetylcholine onto muscarinic receptors in the target organs.

An 18-year-old Japanese woman presents to a medical clinic complaining of
excessive sleepiness. Although she sleeps approximately 8 hours a night, she
is constantly fatigued and sleepy during the day. Sleeping more during the

tasks which she has no recollection of completing. Additionally, she has been

Summary: An 18-year-old Japanese woman complaining of excessive sleepiness during the day even after sufficient nighttime sleep and muscular weakness after laughing.

◆
◆
◆

Symptoms: Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), cataplexy, slurred
speech, impaired vision, weakness of facial and limb muscles,
hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis are common symptoms
of patients with narcolepsy.
Chromosome: The HLA complex is found on chromosome 6.
Limbic system: The limbic system is composed of the hippocampus,
amygdala, and hypothalamus among numerous other brain structures.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Narcolepsy is a neurological condition characterized by EDS, often with
episodes of muscular weakness known as cataplexy. Persons with narcolepsy tend to feel sleepy whenever they are awake, and often unable to
keep themselves awake for long periods of time, even after adequate nighttime sleep. Cataplexy, which has been found to occur in nearly 75% of narcoleptic patients, is described as temporary muscular weakness or paralysis
without loss of consciousness evoked by sudden emotional reactions, especially laughter. Other evoking emotions include anger, joy, fear, and surprise. Usually speech is slurred and vision is impaired, along with weakness
of the face muscles and/or limbs. Narcoleptics also experience automatic
behavior, meaning that they continue to function during sleep episodes, but
awake with no recollection of what they have done. Approximately 40% of
narcoleptics experience this. Other common symptoms include sleep paralysis (temporary inability to move or talk when waking up) and hypnagogic
hallucinations (vivid, often frightening dreamlike episodes that occur when
falling asleep and/or waking up). Narcolepsy can be diagnosed with the
help of a polysomnogram or multiple sleep latency test. A polysomnogram
involves continuous recording of brain waves and nerve and muscle functions during sleep. Narcoleptics fall asleep and enter REM sleep quickly,
and may wake oftentimes during the night. In a multiple sleep latency test,
the patient is allowed to sleep every 2 hours while observations of sleepiness and amount of time needed to reach various sleep stages are continuously taken. While true prevalence of narcolepsy is significantly
underreported, the reported prevalence ranges from about 5 in 10,000 for
North American and European populations, to 16 in 10,000 in Japan. While
there seems to be no significant difference between men and women, there
does seem to be a strong genetic link. One factor which may predispose an
individual to narcolepsy is the HLA complex of chromosome 6. Though not

CLINICAL CASES

267

specifically defined, there appears to be a correlation between certain variations in HLA genes and narcolepsy. Recently, it has been discovered that
narcolepsy is specifically related to the hypothalamus. Brain cells which
contain the chemical hypocretin and originate in the hypothalamus are
found to be reduced by 85%–95% in people with narcolepsy. Scar tissue
was present in hypothalamic regions where hypocretin brain cells used to
be, indicating the cells were present at birth but later died. It is thought that
certain variations in the HLA complex increase the risk of an autoimmune
response to hypocretin.
In terms of treatment, the common symptoms of EDS and cataplexy must
be treated separately. EDS can be treated with amphetamine-like stimulants
such as dextroamphetamine, or with modafinil, another type of CNS stimulant
known as a “wake promoter.” Cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic hallucinations can be treated using antidepressant compounds.

Definitions
Vegetative functions: Body regulatory functions.
Thermoreceptor: A sensory receptor that responds to heat and cold.
Osmoreceptor: A receptor sensitive to plasma osmolality that exists in the
brain to regulate water balance in the body by controlling thirst and the
release of vasopressin.
Antidiuretic hormone (ADH): Hormone secreted by the posterior pituitary gland and also by nerve endings in the hypothalamus; affects blood
pressure by stimulating capillary muscles and reduces urine flow by
affecting reabsorption of water by kidney tubules.
Oxytocin: A short polypeptide hormone released from the posterior lobe of
the pituitary gland, which stimulates the contraction of smooth muscle
of the uterus during labor and facilitates ejection of milk from the breast
during nursing.

DISCUSSION
One of the oldest systems in the brain, the limbic system is involved in emotion and memory as well as numerous body regulatory functions collectively
known as vegetative functions. While this system is composed of many
structures, there are three main ones: the hippocampus, amygdala, and
hypothalamus.

268

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Hippocampus
The hippocampi are found bilaterally deep in the medial temporal lobe, and
play a role in long-term memory and spatial navigation. Because the hippocampus is involved in transferring short-term memory to long-term memory, damage to this structure most commonly results in the inability to lay
down new memories (anterograde amnesia).

Amygdala
Above the hippocampi lie the two almond-shaped neuron masses known as the
amygdalae. The amygdala is involved in monitoring the environment for survival management and responds specifically to the stimuli of fear. The amygdalae sends output to several structures involved in the response to fear
including (1) the hypothalamus to activate the sympathetic nervous system, (2)
the reticular nucleus to increase reflexes, (3) the nuclei of trigeminal and facial
nerves to modulate facial expressions, and to various areas (ie, ventral tegmental area and locus ceruleus) which result in increased release of dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. The amygdala also contains receptors for
estrogen and androgens, suggesting a role in sexuality. A bilateral lesion of the
amygdalae results in the Kluver-Bucy syndrome, characterized by loss of
fear, hypersexuality, hyperorality, and emotional blunting.

Hypothalamus
Though extremely small, the hypothalamus is perhaps the most important
structure of the limbic system. Its key central position in relation to the other
limbic structures facilitates its two-way communication with all levels of the
limbic system. Specifically the hypothalamus sends signals in three directions:
up toward the higher areas of the diencephalon and cerebrum, down to the
brainstem, and into the hypothalamic infundibulum to control hormonal secretion of the anterior and posterior pituitaries. With the help of the rest of the
limbic system the hypothalamus controls numerous aspects of emotional
behavior and most of the bodily vegetative functions, as explained next.

Cardiovascular Regulation
Stimulation of different regions of the hypothalamus is known to have different neurogenic effects on the cardiovascular system. For example, stimulation
of the posterior and lateral hypothalamus (which is involved in sympathetic
stimulation) increases heart rate and arterial pressure. On the other hand, stimulation of the preoptic area found in the anterior hypothalamus (which is
involved in parasympathetic stimulation) causes a decrease in arterial pressure
and heart rate. The specific cardiovascular control centers are found in the
reticular regions of the brainstem, particularly the medulla and pons.

CLINICAL CASES

Regulation of Body Temperature
As discussed earlier in this book, the hypothalamus is involved in thermoregulation. The thermostatic center is located in the preoptic area, and thermoreceptors in the region are involved in monitoring the rise and fall of
blood temperature. Increased blood temperature increases the activity of
these thermoreceptors, while decreased blood temperature decreases their
activity. The activity and signals from these receptors control a variety of
thermoregulatory mechanisms, which are discussed in further detail in the
case on thermoregulation.

Regulation of Body Water
The hypothalamus is also involved with the regulation of body water. Water homeostasis in controlled by two hypothalamic mechanisms: the osmoreceptor-ADH
feedback system, and the thirst mechanism. The osmoreceptor-ADH feedback
system regulates the amount of water absorbed in the kidney and excreted in the
urine, while the thirst mechanism induces water drinking behavior whenever necessary. Special receptors known as osmoreceptors located in the supraoptic
nucleus region are stimulated by changes in plasma sodium concentration. In turn,
these osmoreceptors stimulate the secretion of ADH at nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. ADH acts on the collecting ducts of the kidney, causing increased
water absorption. The thirst mechanism is controlled by the thirst center, composed of the AV3V region and a specialized area near the preoptic nucleus. When
blood osmolarity rises above normal levels, this center stimulates a thirst sensation
which greatly increases an organism’s desire to drink water.

Regulation of Uterine Contractility and
of Milk Ejection from the Breasts
Stimulation of the paraventricular nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus induces
secretion of oxytocin. In females oxytocin increases contractility of the uterus
and myoepithelial cells that surround the breast alveoli. It is released mainly after
distension of the cervix and vagina during labor and after stimulation of the nipples, thereby stimulating childbirth and breastfeeding respectively. A baby’s sucking on the mother’s nipple stimulates a reflex signal from the nipple to the
posterior hypothalamus, and induces release of oxytocin, which then causes contraction of the breast milk ductules. Oxytocin is also known to play a role in circadian homeostasis, helping regulate body activity level and wakefulness.

Gastrointestinal and Feeding Regulation
Hunger and appetite stimulation is controlled by several areas of the hypothalamus. The area most involved with stimulation of the hunger sensation,
large appetite, and food-seeking behavior is the lateral hypothalamic area.

270

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Damage to this area can lead to starvation. On the other hand, the satiety center,
which is located in the ventromedial nucleus, is involved in opposing the
desire for food. When stimulated, this center causes an organism to lose interest in its food and stop eating. Damage to the satiety center can result in
overeating and consequently obesity. Important hormones involved include
leptin, which signals satiety; ghrelin, which signals hunger; and insulin, which
signals satiety and subsequent glucose storage. Additionally, the mammillary
bodies in the posterior hypothalamus are involved in controlling feeding
reflexes, such as licking the lips and swallowing.

Behavioral Functions
Stimulation of different parts of the hypothalamus also affects behavior. For
example, stimulation of the lateral hypothalamus increases the organism’s general activity level, in addition to causing thirst and hunger as explained in the
previous section. Conversely, stimulation in the ventromedial nucleus leads to
satiety and tranquility. Stimulation of a thin area of the periventricular nuclei
near the third ventricle can lead to fear and punishment reactions. Additionally,
several areas, especially those found in the most posterior and anterior regions
of the hypothalamus are involved with stimulating sexual drive.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

A 55-year-old man comes into the clinic for a routine checkup, the
first he has had in many years. You perform the usual history and
physical examination, and note that his blood pressure (BP) is
165/94. In order to better assess this abnormality, you have him return
several times over the next few weeks for BP checks, and each time
it is a similar value. You diagnose him with hypertension and begin
treatment. If this man’s hypertension is because of hyperactivity of a
hypothalamic nucleus, which nucleus is most likely affected?
A.
B.
C.

A 33-year-old woman is involved in an automobile accident, and suffers a head injury. When she regains consciousness after 2 weeks in

isn’t hungry or interested in food in the least. If this lack of appetite is
caused by a hypothalamic lesion, where would it most likely be?
A.

A 27-year-old woman is in labor with her first child, and you are
supervising her care. After several hours of laboring, it is apparent
that she is not progressing appropriately. You decide to augment her
labor by starting her on pitocin, a synthetic form of oxytocin. From
what hypothalamic nucleus is oxytocin normally secreted?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Paraventricular nucleus
Arcuate nucleus
Preoptic nucleus
Suprachiasmatic nucleus

Answers
[33.1]

C. The posterior and lateral nuclei of the hypothalamus have been
associated with increased heart rate and arterial blood pressure. The
anterior nucleus has been associated with decreased heart rate and
blood pressure, the arcuate nucleus is involved in endocrine regulation, and the ventromedial nucleus is thought to be the satiety center.

[33.2]

B. The lateral hypothalamus has been associated with hunger,
appetite, and food-seeking behavior. Bilateral lesions to this area in
experimental animals have caused them to starve to death despite the
presence of food. While it is highly unlikely that a person could suffer isolated bilateral lesions to a single hypothalamic nucleus, if it
were to occur, this would likely be the result. The ventromedial
nucleus is the satiety center, and a lesion to it would cause the opposite symptoms: overeating and obesity.

[33.3]

A. The paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus produces oxytocin,
which is then transported in its axons down the pituitary stalk to the
posterior pituitary where it is secreted into the bloodstream when the
appropriate stimulus is present. The arcuate nucleus in involved in
anterior pituitary endocrine control, the preoptic nucleus is involved
in temperature regulation, and the suprachiasmatic nucleus helps regulate circadian rhythm.

A 36-year-old female presents to the clinic complaining of prolonged and
extreme tiredness. She states that she has been suffering these symptoms for
the past 6 months, and she feels just as tired after a full night’s sleep as she did

ANSWERS TO CASE 34: RETICULAR-ACTIVATING
SYSTEM
Summary: A 36-year-old woman presents to clinic complaining of debilitating
fatigue. She states that she had the flu just prior to onset of symptoms.

◆
◆

Pathophysiology: It is believed that damage to the ascending reticularactivating system (RAS), an area in the brain that extends upward from
the reticular formation and is associated with sleep function, may
contribute to onset of CFS.
Location of structure: Brainstem.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
CFS is a disorder marked by severe, chronic mental and physical exhaustion,
among other symptoms, arising in a previously healthy and active person. It is
a highly debilitating disorder of uncertain etiology. Most cases of CFS begin
immediately following a period of stress. While some cases start gradually, the
majority start suddenly, often triggered by a viral illness. In sudden onset cases,
patients report a sudden, drastic start to their illness, some being able to specify the date or even hour of onset. Many people report having the flu, exposure
to an allergen, or an infection such as bronchitis, from which they are never able
to fully recover and which evolves into CFS. In some instances, patients claim
that vaccination, particularly vaccinations against hepatitis B, is the cause of
acute-onset CFS. Other patients suffer from Lyme disease before sinking into
CFS. Patients who experience a gradual onset of CFS may not realize there is
anything wrong for quite some time. These patients usually do not seek treatment until the condition is truly debilitating. Although CFS can affect people of
any gender, age, race, or socioeconomic group, most patients diagnosed with
CFS are 25-45 years old and female. Estimates of how many people are
afflicted with CFS vary because of the similarity of CFS symptoms to other diseases and the difficulty in identifying it. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) has estimated that 4-10 people per 100,000 in the United
States have CFS. According to the CFIDS Foundation, about 500,000 adults in
the United States (0.3% of the population) have CFS. This probably is a low
estimate since these figures do not include children and are based on the CDC
definition of CFS, which is very strict for research purposes. While there is no
known cause for CFS, many causes have been proposed. There is evidence that
CFS may involve distinct neurological abnormalities, supporting many
researchers’ classifications of CFS as a neurological illness. It is believed that
damage to the ascending RAS, an area in the brain that extends upward from
the reticular formation and is associated with sleep function, may contribute to
onset of CFS. Imaging studies of CFS patients’ brains have shown metabolic
abnormalities in the RAS, so it seems likely that damage to this area may be
responsible for at lest some cases of CFS. This damage may be caused by bacterial or viral damage, or an autoimmune attack on the region. Because there is

CLINICAL CASES

275

no one identifiable cause for CFS, there is also no one treatment protocol.
Oftentimes, medications are administered to treat the symptoms of CFS. This
includes antidepressants, hormones, and autonomic nervous system stimulants.

Describe the anatomy of the RAS.
Describe the interaction between the RAS and the cortex.
Describe the function played by the RAS in REM sleep.

Definitions
Reticular Activating System: The area of the brain that plays a major role
in arousal and attention. Located within the brainstem, lesions affecting
this system lead to impairments in consciousness.
Pontine Tegmentum: Area of the brainstem located in the posterior aspect
of the pons. This area houses the fibers and structures of the reticular
activating system.

DISCUSSION
The RAS, composed of the reticular formation and its connections, is often
called the attention center of the brain (see Figure 34-1). The reticular formation is one of the oldest systems in the nervous system. The brains of primitive
vertebrates are almost exclusively made up of a reticular formation. Humans
retained this formation over the course of evolution, as more organized components of the nervous system appeared. The RAS plays several roles, including nonspecific arousal, cortical activation and tone, and regulating sleep and
wakefulness. Injury to the reticular system can cause a change in the level of
consciousness, ranging from sleepiness to coma. The medullary levels of the
RAS control vital respiratory and cardiovascular centers. Defects in these
areas can impair respiratory rate, heart rate, and blood pressure.
The RAS has a diffuse arrangement of both ascending and descending neurons that form a system of networks. It is connected at its base to the spinal
cord, where it receives information projected from the ascending sensory
tracts, and runs all the way up to the midbrain. As a result, the RAS is a very
complex collection of neurons that serve as a point of convergence for signals
from the external world and from interior environment.
The RAS is capable of generating dynamic effects on the activity of the cortex, including the frontal lobes, and the motor activity centers of the brain. The
RAS acts as an information filter, managing what data to pass onto the cortex
and what data to block. This function is vital, as there is too much competing
information at any given time for the brain to process all at once. The RAS also
plays a major role in mediating and filtering ascending and descending sensory

and motor information. It is the center of balance for the other systems involved
in learning, self-control or inhibition, and motivation. When functioning normally, it provides the neural connections that are needed for the processing and
learning of information, and the ability to pay attention to the correct task.
Researchers have hypothesized that the RAS also plays a role in anticipatory responding. It signals the cortex, alerting it to prepare to receive stimuli,
allowing it to get into a heightened state of readiness. If the RAS fails to excite
the neurons of the cortex as much as it should, the under-aroused cortex will
result in difficulty learning, poor memory, little self-control, and so on. If the
RAS fails completely to stimulate the cortex, the result would be a lack of consciousness. Injury of the RAS is directly associated with coma. In contrast, an
overexcited RAS would arouse the cortex or other systems too much and cause
restlessness and hyperactivity.
It is also evident that the RAS is the primary mechanism for turning REM
sleep on and off. During wakefulness, the RAS maintains cortical arousal. The
high activity in the ascending RAS stimulates the brain through projections
into different neurological systems in the cortex. However, the midbrain reticular formation becomes activated immediately prior to REM sleep. At this
time, the medullary reticular formation spurs a postsynaptic inhibition. This
results in a loss of muscle tone.

CLINICAL CASES

277

The reticular formation in general decreases sensory input, and reduces motor
output during REM sleep. REM sleep-on cells, located in the pontine tegmentum, are particularly active during REM sleep, and are probably responsible for
its occurrence. The release of certain neurotransmitters, the monoamines (norepinephrine, serotonin, and histamine), is completely shut down during REM. This
causes REM atonia, a state in which the motor neurons are not stimulated and
thus the body’s muscles do not move. Lack of such REM atonia causes REM
behavior disorder; sufferers act out the movements occurring in their dreams.

injuries, his heart rate, respiratory drive, and blood pressure are all stable without medical intervention, but he remains unresponsive. An EEG demonstrates
continuous slow-wave sleep.

D.

Initiation of stage one sleep

Answers
[34.1]

B. Damage to the midbrain tegmentum will sever all connection
between the cortex and the ARAS, resulting in a coma as is seen
here. The ascending RAS is located in the tegmentum of the brainstem, from medulla to midbrain. Projections from the ARAS to the

278

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

cortex are necessary for the maintenance of consciousness and
awareness. This man has a defect in this system as evidenced by his
persistent sleeplike state with slow-wave sleep waves on EEG.
Damage to the medullary tegmentum, in addition to causing problems with arousal, would likely damage some part of the heart rate,
blood pressure, or respiratory control centers that are part of the
medullary ARAS. Since the patient is stable, this does not seem like
the likely place for the lesion.
[34.2]

C. The correct answer is information filtering. The ARAS sits at a
very important point between the cortex which perceives and analyzes information, and the brainstem where a huge amount of sensory
information, both about the external world and the internal body
come in. There is far too much information sensed at a time for the
cortex to be able to interpret, so this information must be filtered
somehow. The ARAS is responsible to filtering this information, and
depending on what information gets through, it plays a role in directing selected attention of the cortex.

[34.3]

B. Several areas of the pontine tegmentum that are also part of the
ARAS are thought to be involved in the initiation of REM sleep.
This REM-on system utilizes excitatory acetylcholine projections to
the thalamus and cortex to generate REM sleep. Other areas of the
ARAS seem to be involved in the inhibition of muscle tone during
REM sleep, but not during stage 4 sleep.

CASE 35

A 77-year-old Caucasian man has a history of hypertension, atrial fibrillation,
and a remote history of severe alcoholism. He presents to the emergency
department after his wife found him unconscious in their yard. Emergency
medical services arrived at their home to find a nonresponsive man with an
intact papillary reflex and spontaneous respirations. After obtaining this brief
history you examine the patient. He is still unresponsive and you notice that
his left pupil is significantly larger than his right. His respirations have become
noticeably deeper and he is breathing at a rate of 35 respirations per minute. A
STAT CT scan of his head without contrast shows an acute 14-mm left-sided
subdural hematoma with midline shift. Based on the presentation, the patient
is diagnosed with an altered respiratory drive secondary to an uncal herniation.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

ANSWERS TO CASE 35: BREATHING, NEURAL
CONTROL
Summary: A 77-year-old man is noted to have an acute intracranial hemorrhage with increased intracranial pressure and uncal herniation.

◆

Other intracranial processes: Yes, any intracranial process that increases
the intracranial pressure that results in herniation can cause uncal
herniation (or any other of the herniation syndromes). Hydrocephalus,
intracranial neoplasms, foreign bodies, and hemorrhage are all examples of
lesions that can raise the intracranial pressure resulting in herniation.

◆

Cortical and brainstem respiratory drives: In general, cortical
respiratory drives are involved with voluntary breathing patterns, whereas
brainstem drives control involuntary breathing patterns.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
In this case, the patient is a man with a history of alcoholism and atrial fibrillation. The combination of these diagnoses increases the risk of subdural
hematomas in the general population. Alcoholism results in cerebral atrophy,
which exposes bridging veins to sheering forces during cranial acceleration and
deceleration. Atrial fibrillation is usually treated with anticoagulation, such as
Coumadin, to prevent intraluminal cardiac thrombus formation. However, in this
case, appropriate anticoagulation in the setting of a lacerated bridging vein can
result in poor clot formation and further intracranial hemorrhage. The subdural
hematoma in this case kept bleeding and resulted in increasing the intracranial
pressure until the ipsilateral uncus was forced around and underneath the tentorium, resulting in transtentorial uncal herniation. The herniated uncus exerted
unwanted pressure on the brainstem, leading to changes in the respiratory drive.
In addition to this clinical picture the physician would expect to find an increased
pH, decreased pCO2, and normal or increased pO2 on arterial blood gas measurement. Thus, any insult to the brainstem, notably the pons and medulla, can result
in alterations of respiratory function. Other brainstem lesions that could have similar outcomes include tumors, aneurysms, stroke, hemorrhage, and trauma.

Definitions
Dorsal medullary respiratory group (DRG): A medullary nucleus containing mostly inspiratory neurons and that is one of the subnuclei of the
solitary tract nucleus.
Ventral respiratory group (VRG): A nucleus that is anterolateral to the
nucleus ambiguous in the medulla. In its caudal portion, it contains the
cell bodies of neurons that fire primarily during expiration and its rostral portion contains cell bodies of neurons that are synchronous with
expiration.
Pontine pair of nuclei (PRG): Two nuclei located adjacent to each
other in the pons. One fires during the transition from inspiration to
expiration and the other fires during the transition from expiration to
inspiration.
Pre-Botzinger complex: Located in the rostral portion of the VRG.
Although its mechanism of action is not entirely clear, it appears to play
some role in setting the automaticity of respiration.

DISCUSSION
Respiration regulation is one of the most fundamental homeostatic drives
within the nervous system. There are both chemical and mechanical input
pathways that influence respiratory patterns, an automated brainstem drive and
the voluntary control mechanisms that begin in the premotor cortices.
Inspiratory neurons are concentrated in the DRG and rostral VRG. The
fibers controlling automatic respiration course down the white matter tracts of
the spinal cord and descend lateral to anterior horn cells of the first three
cervical spinal cord sections to terminate on the anterior horn cells of C3-C5.
The premotor cortex in the frontal lobe also gives rise to neurons that terminate onto the same anterior horn cells. These tracts containing the fibers controlling voluntary respiration course more dorsally in the cervical cord. If the
ventral tracts are damaged, then automatic respirations are lost while voluntary
are preserved. The third, fourth, and fifth cervical (C3-C4) segments project
fibers that will ultimately become the phrenic nerve and will innervate the
diaphragm. Although normal expiration is a passive process, there are clusters of expiratory neurons that provide upper motor innervation of accessory
respiratory muscles as well as creating an inhibitory force on the inspiratory
neurons. The caudal portion of the VRG and the rostral portion of the DRG
contain these expiratory nerve cell bodies. There is some evidence suggesting
the PRG serve as binary switches that control the transition between inspiration and respiration.
The precise mechanism accounting for the brainstem’s ability to generate adequate respiration is unknown. There is a region in the VRG, the preBotzinger complex, which appears to be involved with autonomous
rhythmicity.

282

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

The carotid sinus is sensitive to changes in pH and hypoxia. Afferent fibers
merge into the glossopharyngeal nerve and terminate in the solitary tract
nucleus. There are also medullary chemoreceptors that detect pH changes in
the extracellular fluid. J-type receptors detect material in the interstitial fluid
of the lungs and can stimulate increased respiration.
When structural or metabolic factors divorce the brainstem respiratory
centers from the cerebrum Cheyne-Stokes respirations may result. This pattern of breathing is alternating hyperpnea with hypopnea that ends in
apnea and then repeats itself. Bilateral hemispheric lesions, large unilateral
hemispheric lesions, or metabolic encephalopathies can cause CheyneStokes. Because of the separation of communication between the brainstem
centers and cerebral function, carbon dioxide accumulates until it triggers
chemoreceptors to stimulate inspiration. This results in hyperpnea. As carbon
dioxide is gradually removed from the body, the chemoreceptors fire less frequently until apnea occurs.
Central neurogenic breathing usually occurs with midbrain-pontine
lesions. In this case, the minute ventilation is increased because both tidal volume and respiratory rate are increased. Thus, the pCO2 drops and hyperventilation persists. This type of breathing is usually seen in transtentorial uncal
herniation, per the example in Case 2.
Pontine lesions often result in apneustic breathing, which consists of a
pause between inspiration and expiration.
Medullary lesions result in completely disordered, or ataxic, breathing. It is
thought that these pathological forms of respiration are interrelated and most
patients will progress through various stages before complete respiratory failure
ensues.

Answers
[35.1]

D. The carotid sinus, located at the bifurcation of the internal and
external carotid arteries, and innervated by the glossopharyngeal
nerve, measures arterial blood pH. It responds to increased concentration of hydrogen ions (decreased pH) by increasing its rate of firing,
which stimulates central respiratory centers to increase respiratory
rate. This increased respiratory rate will “blow off” excess carbon
dioxide, thereby partially compensating for the acidemia. Medullary
receptors also respond to decreased pH, but they are centrally located
and do not directly measure blood pH, but rather the pH of the extracellular fluid. J-type receptors respond to changes in the interstitial
fluid of the lungs.

[35.2]

D. Pre-Botzinger complex is involved in automaticity. The dorsal
and rostral ventral medullary respiratory groups are the primary sites
responsible for inspiratory drive. They receive afferent connections
from the carotid sinus, the medullary chemoreceptors, and other sites
in the body converge in the nucleus of the solitary tract and from
there project to the breathing centers, primarily the dorsal respiratory
group. The PRG is involved in cycling from inspiration to expiration,
the premotor complex is involved in voluntary breathing, and the preBotzinger complex is involved in automaticity.

[35.3]

A. Because the ventral respiratory tracts carry signals related to involuntary respiration, and the diaphragm is innervated by the phrenic
nerve, which carries fibers from spinal levels C3-C5, the correct
answer is ventral respiratory spinal tracts to C3-C5. The anterior
horn cells projecting fibers C3-C5 receive signals from both dorsal
and ventral respiratory tracts in the spinal cord, but the ventral tracts,
located lateral to the anterior horn, carry signals related to involuntary
respiration, while the more dorsally located respiratory tract carries
signals related to voluntary respiration.

Upon physical examination, no signs of trauma to the spinal cord are found.
Patient denies having injected any sort of substance into his penis, but visible

ANSWERS TO CASE 36: ADDICTION
Summary: A 30-year-old male presents with priapism and severe muscle
cramps in limbs. Patient has a history of sustained heroin use but claims to
have ceased usage.

◆
◆

Receptors: Opioid receptors.
Treatment: Because the elapsed time since onset has exceeded 6 hours,
treatment of patient’s priapism through medication is no longer an
option. Surgical shunt and aspiration of the penis are the most viable
procedures. Buprenorphine is recommended as a substitute opioid to
help ease other symptoms of heroin withdrawal.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Heroin withdrawal syndrome may manifest in the patient within 6-24 hours
of discontinuation of sustained use of the drug. This time frame may vary
depending on the degree of tolerance of the patient, as well as the amount
of heroin consumed in the last dose. Symptoms of heroin withdrawal
include sweating, malaise, anxiety, depression, priapism in men, extra sensitivity of the genitals in females, general feeling of heaviness, cramplike
pains, yawning, insomnia, cold sweats, chills, severe muscle and bone
aches, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, goose bumps, and fever. Many symptoms of opioid withdrawal are caused by rebound hyperactivity of the
sympathetic nervous system, which can be suppressed using clonidine, a
centrally acting α2 agonist primarily used to treat hypertension. Baclofen, a
muscle relaxant, is often used to treat leg twitches, another symptom of
withdrawal. Diarrhea can be treated with the peripherally active opioid drug
loperamide. One of the most widely used opioid substitutes in the treatment
of heroin withdrawal is buprenorphine, a partial opioid agonist/antagonist.
Buprenorphine develops a lower grade of tolerance than heroin and results
in less severe withdrawal symptoms when discontinued abruptly.
Buprenorphine acts as a κ-opioid receptor antagonist, while simultaneously
acting as a partial agonist at the same μ-receptor where opioids like heroin
exhibit their action. Because of the effects of buprenorphine on this receptor, patients with high tolerances are unable to achieve any euphoric effects
from other opioids while using buprenorphine. There are three known opioid antagonists currently being utilized in the treatment of opioid addiction: naxolone and the longer acting naltrexone and nalmefene. These
medications act by blocking the effects of heroin and other opioids at the
receptor sites.

Describe the development of addiction.
Identify the mesolimbic dopaminergic system and its role in rewardrelated learning.
Describe the nature of drug tolerance and its implications in the withdrawal symptoms that occur upon discontinuation of the drug.

Definitions
Buprenorphine: A semisynthetic opioid analgesic used for the relief of
moderate-to-severe pain.
Opioid antagonist: A receptor antagonist that acts on opioid receptors,
blocking the effects of opioids.

DISCUSSION
The development of addiction is thought to be a simultaneous process of
increased focus on and engagement in a particular behavior and the simultaneous attenuation or shutting down of other behaviors. For instance, in certain
experimental circumstances, test animals are allowed the ability to selfadminister certain psychoactive drugs. Given an unlimited supply of the drug,
the animals will show an extremely strong preference for it, forgoing food,
sleep, and sexual intercourse in order to maintain access to the drug. From a
neuroanatomical standpoint, it can be argued that the mechanisms involved in
driving goal-directed behavior become gradually more selective for certain
stimuli and rewards, exceeding the point at which the mechanisms involved in
behavior inhibition can effectively preclude the action. In this case, the limbic
system is thought to be the major driving force and the orbitofrontal cortex is
the substrate of the top-down inhibition.
The portion of the limbic system responsible for the translation of motivation
to motor behavior–learning and reward-related learning is the mesolimbic
dopaminergic system. This system is comprised of the ventral tegmental area
(VTA), the nucleus accumbens, and the bundle of dopamine-containing fibers
that connect them. Located on the anterior cingulated circuit, the portion of the
frontal lobe that incorporates much of the brain’s motivational pathways, is the
ventral striatum. This locus is of importance because it is where the nucleus
accumbens are situated and where the release of dopamine takes place, a process
that is believed to be a critical mediator of the reinforcing effects of stimuli,
including drugs of abuse. This system is commonly implicated in the seeking out
and consumption of rewarding stimuli or events, such as sweet-tasting foods or
sexual interaction. However, its importance to addiction research goes beyond its
role in “natural” motivation: while the specific site or mechanism of action may

288

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

differ, all known drugs of abuse have the common effect in that they elevate the
level of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens. This may happen directly, via the
blockade of the dopamine reuptake mechanism, as is the case with cocaine use.
Or it may also happen indirectly, such as through stimulation of the dopaminecontaining neurons of the VTA that synapse onto neurons in the accumbens,
which occurs during opiate use. The euphoric effects of drugs of abuse are a
direct result of the acute increase in accumbal dopamine.
The central nervous system, like the rest of the human body, has a natural tendency to maintain an internal equilibrium, or homeostasis. Prolonged elevated
levels of dopamine will spur a decrease in the number of dopamine receptors.
This process, known as downregulation, causes a change in postsynaptic cell
membrane permeability. This in turn makes the postsynaptic neuron less excitable
and less responsive to chemical signaling with an electrical impulse, or action
potential. The resultant unresponsiveness of the brain’s reward pathways contributes to an inability to feel pleasure, known as anhedonia, a phenomenon often
observed in addicts. Upon onset of anhedonia, a greater amount of dopamine is
required to maintain the same electrical activity. This is the basis of physiological tolerance of a drug, as well as the withdrawal associated with addiction.
Contrary to popular belief, drug overdoses are generally not the result of a
user taking a higher dose than is typical but rather administering the same dose
in a new environment. If a behavior occurs repeatedly and consistently in the
same environment or contingently with a particular cue, the brain will adjust
to the presence of these cues by decreasing the number of available receptors
in the absence of said behavior.
Withdrawal symptoms occur in the absence of substances that the body has
become physically dependent on. These substances include depressants of the
central nervous system such as opioids, barbiturates, and alcohol. Withdrawal
from alcohol or sedatives like barbiturates or benzodiazepines can cause
seizures and may result in death. However, withdrawal from opioids, while still
extremely uncomfortable, is rarely life threatening. In situations of particularly
severe anhedonia, the body is so accustomed to high concentrations of a substance that it no longer produces its own natural versions. Instead, it produces
opposing chemicals. When delivery of the substance is halted, the effects of the
opposing chemicals can be devastating. For example, in instances of chronic
sedative use, the body counters by producing chronic levels of stimulating neurotransmitters such as glutamate. High concentrations of glutamate can be toxic
to nerve cells. This scenario is called excitatory neurotoxicity.

Receptor downregulation
Decreased receptor sensitivity
Exhaustion of dopamine stores
Depletion of acetyl choline

Answers
[36.1]

D. The neurotransmitter most frequently associated with euphoria
from drugs is dopamine. In a normal brain, this dopamine release
onto the nucleus accumbens is associated with reward, and helps to
drive behavior. It can be naturally released through things like sexual
activity and sweet foods.

[36.2]

B. The MFB is a tract of dopaminergic axons that project from the
VTA to the nucleus accumbens. When stimulated, this tract releases
dopamine onto the nucleus accumbens, which results in a euphoric
feeling. In experimental animals, it has been shown that animals will
autostimulate the MFB with an electrode to the detriment of everything to the point that they actually starve to death. This dopaminergic tract plays a very important role in reward and motivational drive,
as well as addiction.

[36.3]

A. The phenomenon in which more and more drug is needed each time
to achieve the same effect is known as tolerance, and the molecular

290

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

mechanism responsible for this phenomenon is downregulation of
postsynaptic dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens.
Excessive stimulation by dopamine causes the postsynaptic cells to
decrease the amount of dopamine receptors they express, resulting in
less effect for the same amount of dopamine release. The individual
receptors are just as sensitive, there are simply fewer of them around.

CASE 37

A 26-year-old right-handed Asian female presents to the clinic with frequent
burning and numbness in the palm of her right hand. The symptoms first began
at night when the patient would feel the need to “shake out” her right hand, but
now her hand frequently feels tingly and weak during the day. She works as an
assembler in a manufacturing factory, and the symptoms have begun to interfere with her job. Upon neurological examination, the Tinel test of applying
pressure to the palmar aspect of her wrist tested positive (the patient noted a
shock-like sensation to her fingers). There was no indication of neurological
deficit in any other area of the body. The patient also has a history of diabetes,

ANSWERS TO CASE 37: AXONAL INJURY
Summary: A 26-year-old Asian female complains of progressive pain in the
palm of her right hand.

◆
◆

Nerve affected: Median nerve.
Disease mechanism: Carpal tunnel is the result of increased pressure
and compression of the median nerve and tendons in the carpal tunnel.
The syndrome is usually owing to having a smaller carpal tunnel,
trauma and injury to the wrist, work stress, or other mechanical
problems of the wrist joint.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Carpal tunnel is more prevalent among populations of women, diabetics, and
assembly-line workers because of a smaller carpal tunnel, related nerve effects
that increase susceptibility to compression, and increased wrist trauma, respectively. This is a peripheral nerve disorder caused by a less obvious manifestation
of axonal injury. The compression of the median nerve may have been traumatic
enough to induce intrinsic mechanisms of axon cell death discussed below and
in some cases can be severe enough to sever the axon, but leave the basal lamina sheath of nerve intact to guide regeneration. Carpal tunnel represents the
most common of the entrapment neuropathologies that are a group of disorders
resulting from the chronic compression of peripheral nerves, namely the median
nerve, resulting in pain or loss of function. Specifically, entrapment syndromes
result from chronic injury to a nerve as it travels through an osseoligamentous
tunnel; the compression usually is between ligamentous and bony surfaces.
Pathophysiology includes microvascular (ischemic) changes, edema, dislocation
of the nodes of Ranvier, and structural alterations in membranes at the organelle
levels in both the myelin sheath (ie, focal segmental demyelination), and the
axon. Severe cases of entrapment can result in Wallerian degeneration of the
axons and permanent fibrotic changes in the neuromuscular junction that prevents reinnervation. If symptoms persist for 6 months or longer following nonsurgical treatment, this may be an indication of the continued physical
compression of the nerve by the band of tissue surrounding the wrist that inhibits
axon regeneration. The band is cut during surgery to reduce pressure on the
median nerve.

CLINICAL CASES

Definitions
L-type

calcium channel blockers: These blockers inhibit L-type voltagedependent calcium channels. L-type channels have large sustained conductance, inactivate slowly, are responsible for the plateau phase of the
action potential, and may trigger release of internal calcium ions.
Calpains: These are the calcium ion–dependent proteolytic enzymes that
modulate cellular function. Cytoskeleton molecules are the main substrate for calpains, thus, calpain activation causes the degradation of the
axonal cytoskeleton. Intuitively, inhibition of calpains can also prevent
axonal degeneration in vitro.
Target-derived trophic factors: Growth factors derived from the target of
intended neuronal growth, for instance, a target neuron from which
another will synapse can release target-derived trophic factors to encourage neural growth.
Retrograde cell death: Following axonal injury retrograde cell death is the
death of the neuron associated with the injured axon, usually following
the retraction of the axon away from the severance site.
Anterograde cell death: Following axonal injury, anterograde cell death is
the death of the neuron that synapses with the injured axon.
Nerve growth factor (NGF): It is a small protein secreted from target cells
that causes differentiation, survival, and maintenance of sympathetic and
sensory neurons.
Chromatolysis: The disintegration within a nerve cell body of chromophil
substance, such as chromatin. Typically occurs after peripheral cell damage or cell exhaustion.

DISCUSSION
Most nervous system damage will result in some sort of axonal injury. They are
uniquely vulnerable, given their elongated physiology and how far removed
they are from the cell body, from which they derive proteins for homeostasis
and function (see Figure 37-1). When an axon is cut, it is necessarily removed

from its source of protein synthesis compromising both the axon and its surrounding myelin. After injury, there is an active inherent mechanism that causes
axon death that is not dependent on intervention from outside cells for degeneration. This mechanism of axonal death harkens back to basic neuronal function of synaptic transmission.
There are two phases of calcium entry into the axon after injury. A diffusion of calcium from the extracellular pool occurs immediately, and is interrupted once the axonal membrane reseals. The second movement of calcium
into the cell precedes axonal degeneration and proceeds through the voltagegated ion channels (L-type channels), as well as the sodium–calcium exchange
pump. Entry of calcium through the first route is a consequence of axon depolarization that is a result of the axon losing its ability to maintain a normal resting membrane potential. Additionally, because of this first route of second
phase calcium entry, degeneration in sensory axons can be blocked by L-type
calcium channel blockers in vitro.
The sodium–calcium exchange pump that drives the second route of calcium entry is actually running in reverse following axonal injury. Normally,
allowing the movement of sodium ions down concentration and potential gradients across the membrane drives ATP production that powers the
sodium–calcium exchange pump to remove calcium from the cell. However, if
the membrane becomes depolarized because of action potential activity or
exchange pump failure, and the sodium gradient diminishes then the high concentration of extracellular calcium can drive the sodium–calcium countertransport pump in reverse. The end result is a massive increase in calcium
concentration within the axon exceeding the 200-μm threshold for calciumactivated enzymes, calpains, and possibly other mechanisms as well.
Cytoskeletal molecules are the main enzymatic substrates of calpains, thus,
calpain activation causes the degradation of the axonal cytoskeleton.
Intuitively, inhibition of calpains can also prevent axonal degeneration in vitro.
The fallout from axonal injury can also extend beyond the axon distal to the
cut to the neuron itself. Neuronal death can occur by apoptosis or necrosis.
Death via apoptosis is usually caused by the loss of target-derived trophic factors that provide support to the neuron, or because of the intense influx of calcium mentioned earlier. Rapid necrotic cell death mainly occurs when the axon
is damaged very close to the cell body, usually explained by a combination of
physical trauma to the membrane and cytoskeleton of the neuron, and, again, the
calcium influx that results from axonal membrane disruption. Both neurons in
the vicinity of and some distance away from the lesion can be lost via apoptosis
days after the injury. Adding on to the retrograde cell death of neurons whose
axons have been cut, there is also some anterograde cell death of the neurons
to which those damaged axons connect by apoptosis. Neuronal death in both
these fashions is at least partly because of loss of access to trophic factors.
Trophic support for a neuron can be derived from several sources including
target neurons from which it synapses; neurons that synapse from it; Schwann
cells, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes that contact it at different points; and

CLINICAL CASES

295

microglia that cluster around damaged neurons. Following axonal injury, a neuron clearly loses contact with its target cells and also loses their accompanying
trophic support. Synapses on the cell soma have also been shown to retract,
replaced first by microglia, the astrocytes. A new source of trophic support from
the glial cells surrounding the area of damage replaces the support lost from the
damaged neuron’s efferent and afferent connections. Astrocytes become reactive
in damaged regions of the CNS. Microglia also migrate to these regions where
they undergo mitosis and become activated as well, producing a variety of neurotrophic and toxic cytokines. In the PNS, Schwann cells are activated following axonal injury which leads to a rapid accumulation of macrophages that
secrete toxic molecules. Furthermore, neuronal death and atrophy can be alleviated by the experimental application of various trophic factors such as NGF.
Thus, the overriding consensus is that loss of trophic support results from axonal
damage since many neurons following axonal injury die or become atrophic.
Neurons that survive axonal injury undergo a predictable and welldescribed set of changes. Many of these changes are associated with the reinitiation of protein synthesis for axon growth and regeneration. Anatomically,
these major changes in the pattern and quantity of protein synthesis are manifested in the neuron as chromatolysis, the dispersal of the large granular condensations of the rough endoplasmic reticulum accompanied by changes in the
appearance of the nucleus. Many of the genes that underlie these changes are
upregulated or downregulated after axonal injury and have been identified in
the following categories: transcription factors, growth-associated proteins,
cytoskeletal proteins, growth factor receptors and growth facts, and cytokines.

Answers
[37.1]

D. Calcium enters into the axonal cytoplasm following injury by
two mechanisms. Initially, it enters through the disruption in the
cellular membrane by simple diffusion, but this method is stopped
as the membrane reseals. The second method is through voltagegated calcium channels that open as the neuron depolarizes since it
is cut off from the cell body, and via the sodium–calcium exchange
pump that runs in reverse in this pathologic condition. The calcium
in the cell quickly reaches threshold for activation of calpains,
which begin to degrade cellular proteins, cytoskeletal elements in
particular.

[37.2]

D. This cellular demise is because of absence of neurotrophic factors necessary for neuron survival. Normally, a neuron can derive
trophic support for a variety of places, including the cell it innervates.
Trophic support is the supplying of the neuron with small molecules,
like NGF, that are necessary for the survival of the cell. When a neuron is cut off form its supply of trophic factors, as is the case with
axonal injury, apoptotic pathways within the cell become activated,
resulting in cell death.

[37.3]

A. Schwann cells, the primary supporting glial cell of the PNS,
become activated following axonal damage. When activated they
secrete a variety of cytokines, some of which can serve as neurotrophic factors which can prevent apoptotic neuronal death. They
also secrete cytokines that are chemotactic for macrophages, which
help to clear the damaged axon, but are not themselves glial cells.
Astrocytes and microglia are both active around damaged neurons in
the CNS.

CASE 38

A 40-year-old Caucasian male presents from psychiatry exhibiting mood
swings, increased irrationality, excessive weight loss, and with a recent history
of attempted suicide. Changes in behavior were first noticed by alarmed family members who urged the patient to visit a psychiatrist. No psychological
basis has been found for these sudden changes except a somewhat vague family history in the patient’s father of similar midlife crisis before passing away
years later of pneumonia at home, and a neurological deficit is suspected.
Neurological examination revealed uncontrolled dyskinesias of the arms and
legs, and the patient remarked about having difficulties eating that have been
getting worse. Imaging showed progressive degeneration of the striatum, with
enlarged lateral ventricles and widened intercaudate distance. Genetic analysis revealed abnormality on chromosome 4 consisting of a polyglutamine

Huntington disease (HD) was decided upon.

ANSWERS TO CASE 38: NERVE GROWTH FACTORS
Summary: A 40-year-old Caucasian male has physical and behavioral neurological deficits with an appreciable degeneration of the striatum and a genetic
abnormality on chromosome 4.

◆

◆

◆

Molecular genetics: HD is an autosomally dominant disease inherited
by 50% of the children of an affected parent, who will all express the
disease and pass on the gene with the same probabilities. The critical
gene codes for huntingtin, a protein of unknown function, and is located
on chromosome 4. The gene contains a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat
that is normally 5-36 amino acids in length, but is lengthened in
individuals with HD.
Pathology and pathogenesis: How the expanded polyQ repeats results in
neuronal degeneration in the striatum is currently unknown. Abnormal
inclusion bodies have been found in affected striatal neurons with heavy
huntingtin staining, but whether this is a cause or consequence of cell death
remains to be explored. The relationship between disturbed mitochondrial
function observed in HD and pathology also continues to be delineated.
Neurotrophins: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor has been chosen
because it is required for the correct activity of the corticostriatal
synapse and the survival of the GABA-ergic medium-sized spiny striatal
neurons that die in HD. Neurotrophin 4/5 has been chosen because it
increases the support of interneurons, which is protective of the more
vulnerable medium spiny neurons. And FGF-2 has also been targeted
because it stimulates the development of new spiny neurons from stem
cells already present in the brain.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
HD is marked and progressive degeneration of the striatum, usually identified
by enlarged ventricles and widened intercaudate distance on MRI and CAT
scans. Cell loss spreads in a dorsal medial to lateral ventral direction, and the
caudate nucleus is usually affected earlier and more extensively than the putamen. Medium spiny projection neurons are the most affected along with mild
gliosis at the cellular level. As the disease progresses to advanced stages, other
brain nuclei, particularly those of the basal ganglia, are affected. Cortical input
atrophy and cell loss in the pallidal and substantia nigra pars reticulate outputs
of the striatum are indications of advanced HD and translate into clinical signs
of severe disability, and later death because of infection, pneumonia, or inanition years after diagnosis. Currently there are no available effective treatments
of HD, only drugs to suppress motor and psychiatric symptoms. HD has been
heavily investigated for neurotrophic protection in the striatum. Striatal neurons
in models of the human disease can be rescued with application of a number

CLINICAL CASES

of different nerve growth factors including NGF, BDNF, NT-4/5, β-FGF, TGF-α,
CNTF, and GDNF. The most important issue in developing a neurotrophinbased therapy for HD is the delivery of trophic molecules through either direct
infusion, or through the use of genetically engineered cells. Clinical trials of
CNTF administration are currently underway for HD.

Definitions
Ontogenetic cell death: A cycle of massive neuronal cell death that occurs
during development that serves a number of purposes for neural maturation. For instance, ontogenetic cell death occurs to eliminate redundant
and multiplicative neural connections to the same target.
Trk receptors: Trk receptors belong to the tyrosine kinase class of receptors and are the receptor-binding sites on cells for many important neural growth factors.
Cholinergic neurons: Neurons that synthesize and release acetylcholine
which functions as a neurotransmitter in the PNS and CNS during
interneuronal communication.
Substantia nigra: Large, pigmented, dopamine-producing cells that are
layered in the mesencephalon. These cells have been implicated in
Parkinson disease.
Autocrine trophic support effect: A motor neuron following axonal
injury is capable of achieving an autocrine trophic support effect of selfstimulation by producing its own trkB and BNDF. The extent to which
this effect can delay cell death depends on the cell age and the position
at which the axon is damaged.
Acetylcholine esterase: Enzyme that removes acetylcholine from the synaptic cleft to allow repolarization to occur. It does this by converting acetylcholine into inactive choline and acetate through hydrolysis. Choline
acetyltransferase synthesizes acetylcholine from choline and acetyl CoA.

DISCUSSION
Nerve growth or trophic factors have a well-characterized role in determining which neurons survived into adulthood, and which axonal processes
connected to particular targets. Nerve growth factor or NGF was the first to

302

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

be identified, and has served as a prototype for all that followed. NGF keeps
sensory and all sympathetic neurons through the period of ontogenetic cell
death during development. NGF is mainly secreted by the target tissues
innervated by the sympathetic sensory neurons. When developing embryos
are deprived of NGF, many of these same neurons die before birth. It has
been demonstrated in vitro that for neuronal survival it is essential that
axons make successful connections to NGF-secreting tissue, and that NGF
applied to any part of the neuron, in addition to the end of an axon, will promote survival. We will see that similar to NGF, trophic factors have many
different roles in the adult CNS and PNS, neuronal survival and plasticity,
and glial cells, both in normal brain function, as well as regenerative responses
to injury.
A few main families among the wide spectrum of molecules with neurotrophic effects account for most of the functional effects on neuroplasticity
and regeneration. Factors NGF, BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4/5 constitute the first
major family of centrally acting growth factors, and are structurally related to
NGF. These factors bind to the trk receptors in addition to a low-affinity NGF
receptor, p75, which binds to NGF and BDNF. TrkA is found on some neuronal types, usually cholinergic neurons, while trkB and trkC are widely distributed throughout the nervous system, found on most CNS neurons. CNTF
is another neurotrophic factor with a receptor that is widely found in the CNS.
The molecule itself is found in Schwann cells in peripheral nerves and is produced by astrocytes after CNS injury. FGF-2 also has receptors widely distributed on neurons and glial cells, especially after injury. Astrocytes are the
main sources of FGFs which promote survival and proliferation of most populations of neurons in the developing CNS. FGF-2 and EGF specifically have
been implicated in promoting division and proliferation of CNS
progenitor/stem cells. Two other families of trophic factors are the TGF-β, and
the GDNF family. These two families have more cursory purposes in the nervous system. For example, GDNF and neurturin are of neuronal and persephin
is of glial origin. Their receptors (GFR-α1, GFR-α2, RET) are found on neurons that respond to trophic factors, such as the dopaminergic neurons of the
substantia nigra. Interestingly, GDNF appears to be the most potent yet identified for promoting survival and growth of dopamine neurons both in vitro
and in vivo.
Peripheral nerve damage affects the axons of motor sensory and sympathetic neurons. These neurons generally survive axonal injury as long as it
is some distance from the cell body, and mount a massive regenerative
response. Periphery neurons lose contact with their targets following axonal
injury, and will consequently no longer receive target-derived trophic factors. However, support cells, such as Schwann cells, continue to supply
trophic factors. NGF supports sympathetic axons, and CNTF released at the
time of injury can have a protective effect on motor neurons. Trk receptors
are found on almost all sensory axons: nociceptive and temperaturesensitive neurons carry trkA and are supported by NGF, large proprioceptive

CLINICAL CASES

303

fibers carry trkC and are supported by NT-3, and fine touch and vibrationsensitive fibers carry trkB and are supported by BDNF. TrkB and BDNF
production in motor neurons following injury have an autocrine trophic
support effect. The extent to which these receptors and complimentary
trophic factors can prevent neuronal death can be boiled down to the following points:
•
•

•
•

Motor neurons vary in terms of death following axonal injury, depending on the age and position at which the axons are damaged.
Peripheral nerve damage in developing nervous systems leads to extensive motor neuron death, but nerve damage does not cause motor neuron cell death.
Motor neurons in adults lose choline acetyltransferase following axonal
injury; this effect is absent in developing nervous systems.
Trophic factors are effective in protecting against neuron death following axonal injury in both developing and fully matured nervous systems. BDNF, GDNF, and CNTF are the most effective in motor neuron
death, and IGF, BDNF, and NT-3 are the most effective in peripheral
nerve damage.

Actions of trophic factors are not restricted to the CNS, nor are they limited
to just promoting neuronal survival. Unspecific delivery of trophic factors
causes unrelated side effects because of broad incorporation within the CNS.
Thus, for some therapeutic benefit to be realized, factors need to be delivered
very precisely to neurons where they are needed for protection. For the time
being, manipulation of factor-secreting cells seems to be the best option for
such specialized delivery of nerve growth factors, although surgical
approaches to the peripheral nerves are still relatively effective.

Answers
[38.1]

A. Immature neurons receive neurotrophic support from the target
cells they innervate. In the developing nervous system, there is
typically redundancy in early development: multiple neurons will
extend axons toward a given target. Once this happens, one of neurons (typically the one with the stronger connection) will be
selected for, and the others will degenerate. This selection process
involves trophic factors secreted by the target cell that allow the
neuron to persist. In the absence of these trophic factors, the nonselected for neuron dies. In peripheral nerve injury of mature neurons, they often receive temporary trophic support from
surrounding glial cells or themselves so that the cell bodies do not
degenerate.

[38.2]

D. The period of ontogenetic cell death is a period in which a huge
number of neurons, mostly neurons that are redundant or that have
not reached the proper target, undergo apoptosis. During this period,
neurons that have reached the appropriate target receive trophic factors, and therefore do not undergo apoptosis. In the case of sensory
neurons and neurons of the sympathetic nervous system, the trophic
factor that prevents apoptosis is NGF.

[38.3]

B. Trophic factors are available from a number of other sources
besides target cells, including Schwann cells, and in the case of
motor neurons, themselves. Motor neurons can secrete their own
BDNF which provides them with trophic support in an autocrine
manner.

CASE 39

A 4-year-old boy is at the amusement park where he complains of increasing
headaches and begins to vomit. The parents take him to the children’s hospital where he is evaluated. The family reports that the child had an uncomplicated delivery, received all his immunizations, and is doing well in school. The
boy has been experiencing some headaches for the last 2 months, but they
were attributed to excessive playing of video games. The radiological investigation reveals a pediatric brain tumor with findings of increased intracranial
pressure. The physician tells the boy’s mother that he most likely has a medulloblastoma.

ANSWERS TO CASE 39: NEURAL STEM CELLS
Summary: A 4-year-old boy is evaluated for headaches for 2 months with
increasing severity and frequency over the last 24 hours, along with multiple
bouts of projectile emesis. The CT scan shows hydrocephalus and a dense
mass lesion in the cerebellum. A contrast MRI of the brain is obtained and
reveals an enhancing lesion, and most likely a medulloblastoma.

◆
◆

Part of the brain affected: Posterior fossa.
Most likely cause of increased intracranial pressure: The obstruction
by the tumor of the cerebrospinal outflow via the fourth ventricle led to
obstructive hydrocephalus, causing increased intracranial pressure
leading to the headaches and emesis. The trigger for emesis can be both
from the increased pressure and from tumor compression on an area of
the brain stem called the area postrema. The increasing headaches result
when the brain’s natural capacity to buffer the increased intracranial
pressure is exhausted and small increases in pressure lead to dramatic
increase in symptoms.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Pediatric brain tumors are one of the most common malignancies in children and have a wide range of histopathology. Some tumors can be
removed surgically and with a complete resection, the chance of recurrence is minimal. Also, some tumors are successfully managed with
chemotherapy and/or radiation. Yet, a significant portion of pediatric brain
tumors is of a highly undifferentiated aggressive histopathology and at the
time of diagnosis, often has cells that are outside of the primary tumor and
infiltrated the brain. These tumors continue to recur and are managed with
repeat operation until the patient ultimately is no longer treatable. Examples
of these tumors include medulloblastoma (see Figure 39-1), anaplastic
astrocytoma, and anaplastic ependymoma. Furthermore, children under the
age of 5 are not candidates for radiation, thereby are even more limited to
treatment options. Radiation in children below 5 leads to brain dysfunction.

Definitions
Totipotent: Stem cells that can differentiate into embryonic and extraembryonic cell types. After the fusion of an egg and sperm cell, totipotent
cells are produced by the first few divisions of the fertilized egg.

310

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Pluripotent: Stem cells which can differentiate into any cell within the
germ layers. A pluripotent cell can differentiate into any cell of the
mesoderm, endoderm, or ectoderm.
Multipotent: Stem cells which can differentiate into any cell within its
germ line lineage; for example, a neural stem cell exhibits self-renewal
and can differentiate into astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, or neurons. It can
not, however, differentiate into a cardiomyocyte or intestinal cell.
Unipotent: A progenitor cell, which can differentiate into only once cell
type such as astrocyte or neuron, but not both. These cells can self-renew
and thus are considered stem cells.
Embryonic stem cell (ESC): ESCs are cultures of cells derived from the
inner cell mass of a blastocyst. A blastocyst is an early stage embryo
approximately 4-5 days old in humans and consisting of 50-150 cells.
ESCs are pluripotent.
Adult (somatic) stem cell: A stem cell that is derived from the fetus, child,
or adult and can differentiate into the cells that populate on germ line,
and thereby are considered to be multipotent.
Epigenetics: Nongenetic influences that influence cells, typically this is the
environment in which the cell is found or solution composition in vitro.
Transfection: The process of inserting a foreign gene into the host genome
of a desired cell. Transfection leads to genetic modification that is stable
or transient. Methods include biochemical, physical, and use of viruses.

DISCUSSION
Stem cells give rise to organs and maintain tissue integrity and homeostasis in
the adult organism. There are different types of stem cells, including embryonic and somatic (fetal or adult derived) from which new cells can be derived.
A stem cell must have the following functional properties: (1) should be able
to generate the cell types from the organ it was derived from, and (2) possess
“self-renewal,” that is, the ability to produce daughter cells with identical
properties. The ability to populate a developing or injured region with appropriate cell types upon transplantation is another important stem cell feature
that is well-established with hematopoietic stem cells and awaits standardization in other organ systems including the brain. There are two prototypical
stem cells, the embryonic stem cell (ESC) and neural stem cells (NSC).
ESCs have been derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts of different
species including human. They can be totipotent (be able to generate all cells
types in an organism except the placenta), pluripotent (the ability to yield
mature cell types from all different germ layers), or multipotent (be able to
give rise to all cells within an organ). Currently, our understanding of human
ESCs is increasing and knowledge is being accumulated on improved cell culture conditions, long-term propagation, controlled differentiation, and transplantation into animal models of human disease. The list of various cell types
differentiated from human ESCs (eg, neurons, cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes) is

CLINICAL CASES

311

continuously increasing. The unlimited access to specific functional human
cells is expected to play not only an important role in therapeutic cell replacement but also for disease modeling and drug screening.
In contrast to pluripotent ESCs, somatic stem cells are believed to be multipotent, thereby capable of generating the major cell types limited to the tissue of
origin. Typically, the NSC is capable of producing neurons, astrocytes, and
oligodendrocytes. Somatic/tissue-specific stem cells are the building blocks of
organs during development and survive in specialized microenvironments
(“stem cell niche”) contributing to new cells throughout life. NSCs (1) are multipotent (the ability to yield mature cells in all three fundamental neural lineages
throughout the nervous system, neurons; astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes),
(2) have the ability to populate a developing region and/or repopulate an ablated
or degenerated region of the CNS with appropriate cell types, and (3) undergo
“self-renewal”, that is, the ability to produce daughter cells with identical properties. NSCs are highly abundant during embryogenesis, with a sharp decline
shortly after birth. In the adult nervous system, NSCs are confined to the subgranular zone (SGZ) in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral ventricles. The newly born neurons in
hippocampus have been suggested to improve memory and play a role in mood
behavior such as stress and depression. In rodents, neuroblasts born in the SVZ
migrate along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to the olfactory bulbs where
they differentiate into periglomerular and granule neurons. Isolation of cells
from brain regions such as amygdala, substantia nigra, and cortex has included
cells with stem cell characteristics in vitro. Morphologically, NSCs share properties with both astrocytes and radial glia. The main characteristic is a long
process that extends radially. Although no definitive marker has been suggested
for neural stem cells, a substantial amount of work shows that they are positive
for nestin, an intermediary filament protein, and glial fibrillary acidic protein
(GFAP), used traditionally to identify astrocytes.
NSCs can be generated from ESCs or directly isolated from the developing
CNS (typically from the fetal brain) as well as from neurogenic regions of the
adult brain (typically from a cadaveric brain specimen). Historically, the first
established NSC lines exploited use of tumor viruses to achieve immortalization. However, NSC that have not been genetically modified can also be propagated in vitro for extended periods of time using high concentrations of
mitogenic factors such as basis fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and epidermal
growth factor (EGF).
The challenge to treat brain tumors effectively pivots on the immense difficulty of attacking invading cells within the brain, as well as the delivery of
chemotherapeutic modalities past the blood–brain barrier to tumors and tumor
cells selectively. The unique ability of NSCs to home tumors has been demonstrated, even when transplanted at various sites outside of the tumor itself. This
homing ability has been exploited to deliver therapeutics in various tumor models with remarkable efficacy in mice and may have promise for potential human
clinical transplantation. More specifically, nude mice were inoculated with

312

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

glioma cells and subsequently transplanted with human and murine NSCs at various locations (intratumoral, contralateral hemisphere, intraventricular, and tail
vein) with clear demonstration of NSCs migrating to the tumor and distributing
within the tumor. Interestingly, some NSCs appeared to track single cells invading brain parenchyma outside of the tumor mass. Subsequently, NSCs were
transfected with a gene for cytosine deaminase (CD), a prodrug-converting
enzyme that converts 5-FC to 5-FU, and transplanted some distance from the
tumor. This technique led to approximately 80% reduction in tumor burden.
Along with the promise of using NSCs to treat brain tumors, issues of
patient safety must first be met before clinical trials can occur. Although NSCs
are minimally immunogenic, it needs to be defined whether recipients of NSC
transplants will need to be on immunosuppressive therapy. Also, the cells
transplanted must be able to be followed with imaging in the event they are
migrating to unexpected areas outside of the brain. Lastly, the use of genetically modified cells is controversial and concern exists over whether immortalized cells may grow uncontrollably and lead to tumor formation.
Treatment options for an intracranial mass begin with decompressing the
hydrocephalus at the bedside with a ventricular catheter. Subsequently, an operation is performed to remove the lesion and obtain histopathological diagnosis.
Once tissue diagnosis is obtained, a postoperative plan for adjuvant therapy (radiation and/or chemotherapy) can be created. After resection and adjuvant therapy,
most tumors with aggressive histology tend to recur. The treatment options for
these recurrent brain tumors is limited and often includes more surgery to
decrease the tumor burden, but fails to address the tumor cells that have infiltrated
the brain and serve as foci for the seeding and spreading of the primary tumors.
The horizon for experimental therapy for recurrent untreatable brain tumors may
be the use of neural stem cells. Neural stem cells have demonstrated the ability to
migrate toward tumors and tumor cells and in animal models some of these cells
were shown to deliver chemotherapeutics and decrease tumor volume.

Answers
[39.1]

C. Neural stems cells are multipotent stem cells. This means that they
are capable of dividing to form any of the cells that make up the brain
and nervous system, but not cells of any other organ system. The cell
lines to which neural stem cells can give rise are neurons, astrocytes,
and oligodendrocytes. Recall that other cells that inhabit the CNS and
PNS (microglia and Schwann cells) are not derived from neuroectoderm, and therefore cannot be generated by neural stem cells.

[39.2]

B. In the adult brain, neural stem cells are located in two different
places: the subgranular zone in the hippocampus, and the subventricular zone lining the lateral ventricles. The subgranular zone generates neurons that enter into the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus,
and are thought to play a role in improving memory and affecting
mood. The subventricular zone generates neurons that migrate to the
olfactory bulbs in rodents. The ventricular zone is the location of neural stem cells in the developing nervous system, but they are not
located there in the adult nervous system.

[39.3]

A. Embryonic stem cells are totipotent early in development, at the
blastocyst phase, but begin to restrict their fate soon after that. All the
cells in the blastocyst are identical, and any one of them could give
rise to any cell in the adult human. By the time a cell has differentiated to embryonic mesoderm, it no longer has the ability to become
cells that derive from either endoderm or ectoderm. Neural stem cells
in the subventricular zone are multipotent, they can only become cells
in the brain, and there are no stem cells in muscle.

Summary: A 24-year-old African American male presents with paralysis in
both legs and a narrowing disruption of the spinal cord at the T11-T12 region
of the thoracic spine.

◆

◆

Regions of spinal cord affected: Spinal cord injury (SCI), also known
as myelopathy, results in damage to the white matter tracts (myelinated
fiber tracts) in the spinal cord that carry sensation and motor signals to
and from the brain. It causes segmental losses of interneurons and
motor neurons within the gray matter of the spinal cord.
Treatment options: First and foremost, every precaution must be taken
to stabilize the spine, and not exacerbate the damage following injury. A
significant amount of disability in patients with SCI results from insults
sustained after the initial injury. Studies have shown that some
neurological function can be recovered if methylprednisolone is
administered immediately following injury, and this is routinely
practiced in the United States. However, at present, there exists no real
treatment capable of producing neural repair in the spinal cord. The
majority of treatment is focused on rehabilitation and learning to
function with disability.
Is neural repair likely: While axons in the PNS experience spontaneous
regeneration, CNS axons do not, making natural recovery from axonal
injury in the CNS, such as SCI, impossible. Axon growth and
regeneration is a collaborative process that involves regenerative
attempts made by the axon itself, and the entire environment
surrounding the axon. Unfortunately, the CNS is naturally hostile to
axon regeneration. It is riddled with astrocytes, oligodendrocyte
progenitors, and oligodendrocytes that all have the ability to inhibit
axon regeneration. Additionally, the axon itself does not retain the same
vitality in regeneration as it has during developmental growth, and some
mismatch between cell surface adhesion molecules on axons and those
in the environment exists as well.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Axon growth and regeneration is a collaborative process that involves regenerative attempts made by the axon itself, and the entire environment surrounding the axon. When a CNS axon is severed, it retracts along with its myelin
much like in the PNS. Similar to the PNS, many neurons with severed axons
will die, along with their postsynaptic neurons. However, unlike the PNS, the
remaining neurons that do survive will atrophy, losing many of the enzymes
associated with neurotransmitter production and cellular function. Many of the
axons will also lose many of the synaptic connections that link it to the cell

body by microglia. Astrocytic processes quickly occupy these vacant connections. Furthermore, in the CNS there is little recruitment of macrophages to
enter the axon and remove degenerated axonal and myelin debris except where
blood cells and plasma have entered in the area of the lesion itself. Instead,
degenerative debris is removed by the growth-inhibiting microglia, which are
also present in much smaller numbers. Thus, debris persists in the CNS much
longer, inhibiting regeneration. Following the microglia are oligodendrocyte
progenitors, and then the lesion site fills up with reactive astrocytes and
meningeal cells where the injury penetrates the meningeal surface. These last
two types of cells work in tandem to produce a glial scar. All these cell types
through these processes have regeneration-inhibiting properties.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Polyneuronal innervation withdrawal: A process of normal neural development where an initial stage of multineuronal innervations of muscles
occur, and is followed by a withdrawal of such connections until each
muscle fiber is innervated by only one axon. However, the persistence of
this function after development creates positional breaks during regeneration following axonal injury.

DISCUSSION
In mammals, damage to the CNS usually leads to permanent incapacitation of
the affected neurons and, in most cases, paralysis. However, the ability to
regenerate axons in the peripheral nervous system, and regain much of the
function that is lost after peripheral nerve damage, has been retained in mammals. In general, axons regenerate about 1 mm/day. PNS repair is seldom perfect, issues of axon guidance and other factors can limit regeneration.
When a peripheral nerve is damaged, the axons are disconnected from their
cell body and begin to degenerate. Schwann cell processes surrounding the
axons as myelin also begin to degenerate, and this axonal and myelin debris is
removed by macrophages migrating to the degenerating nerve from the bloodstream. Schwann cells undergo several changes during this period including
secretion of nerve growth factors NGF and BDNF stimulated by cytokines
released by invading macrophages, changes to the Schwann cell membrane
surface where adhesion molecules L1, N-CAM, and N-cadherin are
increased, and Schwann cell extracellular matrix transformations occur
because of increases in tenascin and several proteoglycans. An undamaged
axon-Schwann cell unit is surrounded by a basal lamina sheath composed of
collagen, laminin, and fibronectin. This sheath contains tubes of end-to-end
Schwann cells that form the band of Bungner which remains intact in the
damaged nerve, and, barring mechanical disruption, spans the entire sequence
of the nerve from the lesion to the area of axon termination (see Figure 40-1).
The fallout from nerve damage is dependent on the nature of the injury. A
major disruption or severance of the nerve leads to complete Schwann cell
annihilation leaving just a strip of fibrotic tissue. Conversely, a localized crush
injury sufficiently kills axon, but leaves the basal lamina sheath intact. The
preservation of the continuity of the Schwann cells seems to be essential for
regeneration to occur. However, damage and repair also leads to fibroblastic
scarring that can also hinder regeneration. Therefore, neural repair occurs
within this context of columns of demyelinated Schwann cells encased in a
basal lamina sheath that have changed their surface conformations and have
begun to secrete trophic factors, with perineurial fibroblasts dispersed
around the lesion. It should be emphasized that nerves regenerate only through
intact basal lamina sheaths to ensure that the proper target is reinnervated.
Within an hour of injury, the damaged end of the axon seals off and there
is a formation of a growth-cone structure. This is the initial structural response
to axonal injury, long before any molecules could have been exchanged

between the site of damage and the cell body. For this reason, axons have an
inherent ability to form motile growth cones without the production of new
molecules. After about a day or two, depending on how far from the cell body
the axon was cut, major changes in gene expression and protein synthesis
occur in the cell body, and new building block proteins such as tubulin are
brought to the axon tip. There is a pattern of expression of cytoskeleton proteins (tubulin) and microtubule-associated proteins in repairing neurons that
both mimics and contrasts to neuronal development.
Regenerating axons are usually associated with bands of Bungner, and grow
in between the basal lamina sheath and the Schwann cell membrane. Half of the
growth cone membrane maintains contact with the Schwann cell membrane, and
half is connected to the basal lamina. Cell-to-cell interaction during regeneration
must necessarily take place between these three elements. In vitro experiments
have demonstrated that alone the basal lamina is not sufficient for axonal regeneration; it must be accompanied by Schwann cells. This is because Schwann
cells provide the ideal substrate for regenerating axons and supply many of the
vital trophic factors that boost nerve repair. Schwann cell division can be promoted by cytokine secretion by macrophages that enter the nerve in response to
degeneration to remove axonal and myelin debris. Specifically, interleukin 1
induces NGF production by Schwann cells. Similar changes in Schwann cells,
resulting from a disconnect with the axons and spurred by macrophage interactions, make them a suitable substrate for regenerating axons.

320

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Growth cones adhere to nearby surfaces to exert tension on growing axons
through adhesion molecules on the growth cone surface, and interactions
between substrate adhesion molecules with ligands in the extracellular matrix.
L1 and N-cadherin via hemophilic interactions with the axonal surface molecules, and matrix molecules via binding integrins and extracellular matrix all
promote axonal growth over Schwann cells. These Schwann cells separated
from the axon and stimulated by macrophage secretions will produce many
nerve growth factors that play a central role and enhance neural repair. Other
extracellular events such as inflammation, which causes the release of many
triggering cytokines, also promote axon regeneration.
Some axons grow into the fibroblastic scar tissue that forms at regions of
nerve damage. Axonal growth is halted, and a swollen club ending forms.
These areas of scar tissue can become extremely sensitive to light touch, and
can be quite painful. The more severe the damage, the greater the region of scar
tissue formed, and the fewer axons can regenerate. Axons will not regenerate
through regions of intense scarring unless the damaged region is surgically
removed and replaced by a nerve graft. These regions of scar tissue are so effective at inhibiting axonal growth because of the lack of trophic support, and the
large amounts of highly inhibitory proteoglycan NG2 released by fibroblasts.
Neural repair is a directed process because the specificity of axonal connections is required during regeneration to ensure functionality. Regenerating
motor axons are expected to find their target muscle, as are sensory axons
expected to reconnect to target sensory structures. For this to occur there must
be molecular recognition and guidance processes that allow repairing neurons
to find their appropriate targets. Much of this specificity is owing to a molecular imprint left behind on the muscle end plate basal lamina. Molecules like
agrin and s-laminin, which act as stop signals for axon growth and are found
in synaptic junctions, and Schwann cells that envelope the end plate allow
repairing neurons to find these old denervated synaptic sites. However, axons
still need to be guided by pathways formed by the damaged nerve and its
bands of Bungner to the vicinity of the muscle before these effects will take
place. An important caveat of muscle reinnervation is that because of lower
numbers of regenerating axons, after polyneuronal innervation withdrawal
takes place, each nerve fiber ends up innervating more muscle fibers than before,
leading to much larger motor units. While this mechanism of reinnervation
allows repairing neurons to find old sites of innervations, ensuring that particular axons continue to innervate the same exact sites as before is a much more
imperfect science, and many positional errors are generally made by regenerating neurons because of disrupted bands of Bungner. Sensory reinnervation is
less understood, regenerated nerve endings are rather different from those that
existed before.
Neural repair in the CNS is a new frontier in experimental science since this
process does not usually appear in nature. This is because of the nonpermissiveness of the CNS because of astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, and progenitor
ability to block axonal growth, and factors intrinsic to the axon itself: the

reduced nature of regenerative growth compared to developmental growth, and
mismatch between cell surface adhesion molecules on axons and those present in the environment. Strategies to overcome these obstacles in neural repair
include replacement of the hostile CNS environment with various grafts,
removal of inhibitory cells and molecules, and treatments designed to increase
the regenerative capacity of neurons.

Answers
[40.1]

A. The band of Bunger is a structure made up of Schwann cells and
the basal lamina sheath of the endoneurium that used to surround the
nerve, and remains intact following injury to the axons of a peripheral nerve. This structure serves as a hollow column down which the

322

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

damaged axon can grow, and if it is not otherwise damaged, spans
from the site of injury to the original endpoint of the nerve, allowing
for at least partial regeneration.
[40.2]

B. Under optimal conditions, a damaged nerve will regenerate down
the hollow center of a band of Bunger at a rate of approximately
1 mm/day. Another commonly used number is 1 in/month.

[40.3]

A. When a peripheral nerve regenerates, it does so incompletely,
resulting in a smaller number of axons reaching the target than were
there originally. This translates into each motor axon innervating a
larger number of muscle fibers. Since each motor unit is larger
because of the decreased number of axons, the regenerated system has
a lesser degree of fine movement control than did the original system.

Nerves regenerate only through intact basal lamina sheaths to ensure
that the proper target is reinnervated.
Regenerating axons are usually associated with bands of Bungner,
and grow in between the basal lamina sheath and the Schwann
cell membrane.
After about a day or two, depending on how far from the cell body
the axon was cut, major changes in gene expression/protein synthesis occur in the cell body and new building block proteins such
as tubulin are brought to the axon tip.
Because of lower numbers of regenerating axons, after injury, each
nerve fiber ends up innervating more muscle fibers than before,
leading to much larger motor units.

CASE 41

A 15-year-old, right-handed boy presents to the neurosurgery office for a preoperative evaluation. The patient describes a lifetime history of complex partial seizures. Initially, these seizures were controllable with medication, but
over the last several years, they have become refractory to medical treatment.
His seizures have increased to over six a day despite maximal dosage of medication and the implantation of a vagus nerve stimulator. He had been doing
well at home and in school despite the seizures; however, the large doses of
medication and increase in seizure frequency have begun to affect his cognitive and psychological development. He was diagnosed with medial temporal
lobe epilepsy.

ANSWERS TO CASE 41: BRAIN LATERALITY
Summary: A 15-year-old right-handed boy undergoes epilepsy surgery for
refractory tonic-clonic seizures. Through a combination of imaging and
EEGs, he is diagnosed with medial temporal lobe epilepsy.

◆

◆

Significance of the patient being right handed: The majority of both
right-handed (>95%) and left-handed (70%) individuals are left brain
dominant. Fifteen percent of left-handed individuals are equally
dominant in both hemispheres. This is important to know because it
gives clues as to the possible function of the brain tissue that is involved
in the epileptic activity, and for surgical planning.
Determination of cerebral hemisphere dominance: One method of
determining if the patient is right or left brain dominant is the Wada
test. In the Wada test, the patient receives an anesthetic injection into
either the right or the left carotid artery. This isolates the function of
cerebral hemisphere not receiving the injection, allowing for evaluation
of function. Preoperative or intraoperative mapping is also utilized.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
For this patient, the epileptic focus is removed surgically and the patient
recovers without complication. In consultation with the neurologist, the postoperative epilepsy medication is modified. Six months postoperation, the
seizure frequency has decreased dramatically and the patient has been able to
significantly decrease his antiseizure medication. This has led to an improvement in school function and overall quality of life.
Through unknown mechanisms, complex partial seizures originate from a
specific area of the brain, then spread to surrounding regions. This focus of
abnormal neuronal activity can be surgically removed. Seizure-free rates after
surgery range from 75% to 80%. This is not the case for seizures that begin
diffusely throughout the cortex, as there would be too much morbidity associated with the removal of the afflicted brain tissue. An option for generalized
epilepsy would be to sever the connections between the two hemispheres of
the brain, known as a corpus callosotomy. Up to 63% of seizures decrease with
this intervention. Both of these surgical treatments for epilepsy accentuate the
lateralized functions of the two cerebral hemispheres. Determination of candidacy for epilepsy surgery: first, the patient must fail medical management.
It is important to determine if the seizure focus is diffuse or focal. Focal
lesions may amend themselves to surgical removal. One must also consider the
location of the abnormal firing. If it is located in a very difficult location, or
associated with essential functions such as movement or language, surgical
resection may carry unwanted morbidity. Anteromedial temporal resection for
mesial temporal lobe epilepsy has shown particularly good results from
epilepsy surgery.

DISCUSSION
The concept that the brain’s two hemispheres have distinct yet integrated roles
was first described in the late 1800s with Paul Broca’s and the lateralized functions of speech. From there, physicians and scientists have continued to characterize differences in function between the right and left cerebral
hemispheres. Generally speaking, the nondominant hemisphere has been
described as the “artistic” side responsible for holistic function, whereas
the dominant side is the more “scientific” half, dealing with analytic attention to detail. The dominant hemisphere separates complex stimuli into its
discreet parts (when seeing a forest, focuses on the trees) whereas the nondominant hemisphere synthesizes the diverse parts into a whole (when seeing
trees focuses on the forest). Both are required, and the communication
between the cerebral hemispheres through the corpus callosum allows for
seamless coordination of the separate functions. The lateralized functions of
the brain can be divided into motor, language, music, visual/spatial perception,
and executive capacity.
Descending motor information from one side of the cerebrum controls the
opposite side of the body. Likewise, the majority of ascending sensory information

326

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

crosses and maps out to the contralateral side of the brain. The coordination and
memory of complex motor skills (eg, playing an instrument, dancing) appears to
be controlled by the nondominant hemisphere.
Language, like mathematics, is a sequential activity. Language is lateralized
to the left hemisphere in most individuals; however, 15% of left-handed individuals exhibit language control in both hemispheres. The cerebral hemisphere in control of language is what determines “dominance.” The
dominant hemisphere controls the nonemotional aspects of language. This
includes speech, writing, reading, comprehension, naming, verbal memory,
vocabulary, concept formation, and language structure (spelling, grammar,
syntax). The nondominant hemisphere controls organization, prosody, abstract
language, interpretation and expression of mood, and the subtleties of which
include intonation, connotation, body language, and facial expression. In a
conversation, the dominant hemisphere concerns itself with the content of
speech while the nondominant focuses on the general mood and affect of
the interaction.
While the nondominant hemisphere is often thought of as the “artistic”
side, the dominant hemisphere controls the rhythm and language of music. The
nondominant hemisphere contributes to musical understanding, and temporal
lesions may cause auditory agnosia or amusia.
The dominant and nondominant hemispheres “see” the external world differently. This difference can be demonstrated in facial recognition. When the
dominant hemisphere perceives a face, it sees the hairline, the mouth, the skin
pigment, but cannot place all of the different pieces into one complete picture,
that of a face. The nondominant hemisphere, on the other hand, compiles this
information, determining not only that this is a face, but also that this is a
familiar or unfamiliar face, and can consider the mood expressed by the face.
The nondominant hemisphere is largely responsible for the perception
of space, which is why it is central to the creation and appreciation of art. It is
responsible for conceptualizing the “whole picture,” including spatial relations,
pattern recognition, geometrical shapes and forms, and esthetics. These elements perceived by the nondominant hemisphere are all concurrently present,
in comparison to the work of the dominant hemisphere, which deals with
sequential tasks. In fact, spatial memory is stored in the nondominant hemisphere. The concept of personal space is controlled by the left hemisphere,
whereas extrapersonal space resides in the nondominant hemisphere. For example, a lesion to the nondominant parietal lobe may lead to anosognosia. Patients
deny concurrent debilitations, for example, believing there is nothing wrong
with a paralyzed half of their body. Patients may even deny a paralyzed limb
belongs to them. Anosognosia carries significant morbidity as the patients are
at risk of injury caused by the lack of recognition of their limitations.
Higher executive functions are also lateralized. The dominant hemisphere
is responsible for abstract and rational thinking, analytical reasoning, initiative, attention, and linear thought processes. It also has the power of introspection and a sense of self. This provides the ability to recognize and adhere

CLINICAL CASES

327

to social norms and behavior, allowing for integration into society. The nondominant hemisphere is more intuitive, giving a general gestalt to an interaction, situation, or perception. It is also responsible for the ability to day dream,
and to have complex and rich dream imagery of sleep.

Answers
[41.1]

C. The most likely region to be affected is the right precentral gyrus.
This man shows signs and symptoms of motor system dysfunction,
and a lesion affecting his primary motor cortex could account for this.
The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus and paracentral lobule on the contralateral side of the body. Since his dysfunction is left sided, involving the upper extremity and face, we would
expect the lesion to be located on the opposite side of the body.

[41.2]

B. The most likely location for the lesion is the pars triangularis and
opercularis of the right inferior frontal gyrus. This man presents
with what appears to be a productive aprosody: he can understand
intonation and body language, but not produce it. Prosody is produced
in the nondominant hemisphere, in areas analogous to the speech areas
in the dominant hemisphere. Since this is a productive aprosody, we
would expect the lesion to be located where Broca’s area is, only in
the nondominant hemisphere. Even though this man in left handed, it
is still likely that he is left-hemisphere dominant (70% of left-handed
people are left dominant), so this lesion should affect his right side.

[41.3]

C. The most likely location of the lesion is the right parietal lobe.
This man is having trouble with his visuospatial perception, and with
artistic/aesthetic design, both of which are nondominant hemisphere
processes that are localized to the parietal or parietal-occipital areas
of the brain. Since he is right handed, it is very likely that he is lefthemisphere dominant, so we would expect his lesion to be on the
right side of his brain.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42: VISUAL PERCEPTION
Summary: A 24-year-old male presents with galactorrhea, sexual dysfunciton,
decreased peripheral vision, and new-onset headaches.

◆

Most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms: This patient’s tumor is a
prolactinoma, a benign, prolactin-secreting, neuroendocrine tumor of
the anterior pituitary gland, which is likely a pituitary macroadenoma
(>10 mm diameter). Under physiological conditions, prolactin secretion
causes milk production and lactation; however, this is generally
inhibited by dopamine. This negative-feedback mechanism is
overwhelmed by the prolactin-secreting tumor. Other common
symptoms include headache and visual disturbances.

◆

The mechanism for the patient’s changes in vision: The pituitary gland
sits in a bone depression at the base of the skull called the sella turcica or
“Turkish saddle.” The optic nerves and chiasm are closely associated with
the superior portion of the pituitary gland. Enlargement of the pituitary
compresses the optic nerves and/or chiasm. Involvement of the optic
chiasm selectively destroys the crossing optic fibers carrying information
from the nasal hemiretinas, leading to bitemporal hemianopsia.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
For this patient, his general practitioner orders an MRI that reveals a pituitary
mass compressing the optic chiasm. Medical treatment with dopamine agonists
is attempted; however, he continues to suffer from visual and endocrinologic
symptoms. Consequently, the patient undergoes a transsphenoidal resection of
the tumor. Postoperatively the levels of prolactin normalize and the patient
develops transient diabetes insipidus. He is discharged from the hospital with
endocrine and ophthalmology follow up.
Pituitary tumors are just one type of tumor that may present with visual
symptoms. Depending upon the location of the tumor, the visual symptoms
will differ. In the above case, the crossing fibers of the optic chiasm were compressed, leading to a decrease in peripheral vision. Symptoms may improve
with the removal of the offending mass. If tumor resection involves the resection of neural tissue responsible for the transmission of visual information, that
visual function will be permanently lost. Prolactinomas in general have an
excellent prognosis, and many patients recover their visual function.

Amblyopia: The improper development of a nonfavored eye in childhood
leading to decreased ability of that eye to see details; a “lazy eye.”
Scotoma: An area of diminished vision within the otherwise seeing field.
This may result from a lesion to the neurons or fibers in the retinocortical pathway.
Binocular rivalry: When different optical images falling on corresponding
points in the retinal map are seen by each eye, there is alternate displacement of the two images and occasionally the images are superimposed.
Diplopia: “Double vision;” a single object is perceived as two images, secondary to the same optical image falling on noncorresponding points in
the two eyes. This may occur as a result of oculomotor nerve or muscle
dysfunction.
Near response complex: Accommodation, convergence, and pupillary
constriction.
Perimetry: Visual field testing where a stationary eye perceives a target
spot of various sizes and intensity, moved systematically through the
visual field of each eye.
Homonymous: A defect in the same side of the visual field in both eyes.
Binocular fusion: Images produced by left and right retina are fused into
a single image by projecting to the same position in the visual cortex.
This melding of monocular images enables inference of depth.
Astigmatism: Warping of the curvature of the cornea or lens leading to a
refractive error and resulting distortion of the image on the retina.
Fovea: A depression in the macula of the retina with a high concentration
of cones, producing the highest visual acuity and the greatest color discrimination.
Incongruous: Differences between the two eyes in terms of their visual
field deficits.

DISCUSSION
The eye’s perception of bilateral visual fields begins with the retinal photoreceptor cell’s transduction of wavelengths of energy into electrical signals
(rods—color, cones—black and white). These signals travel from the bipolar
and ganglion cells to the optic nerve (cranial nerve II). At the optic chiasm, the
nerve fibers carrying visual input from the nasal half of each retina cross. From
the optic chiasm, the optic tracts carry information from the contralateral
visual field (contralateral nasal and ipsilateral temporal hemiretina). The optic
tracts synapse in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus as a

332

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

topographic map of the contralateral visual half field. From the LGN, the visual
information leaves the thalamus via the optic radiations, part of the retrolenticular limb of the internal capsule. The optic radiations then synapse in the
primary visual cortex (striate/calcarine cortex) surrounding the calcarine sulcus
(area 17) of the occipital lobe. The two separate eye’s perception of the world
are melded into one single image (binocular fusion) as the optic radiation neuron projections, corresponding to specific retinal points, synapse at exactly the
same point on the cortical map of the central visual field. Adjacent points in
the visual field synapse at adjacent locations in the primary visual cortex map.
The fovea projects to the posterior striate cortex, and as the fovea has higher
acuity, there are more neurons committed to this area of the map. The information in the striate cortex is upside-down and backward to the external visual
environment. Therefore, the striate cortex below the calcarine fissure responds
to visual field input from the contralateral upper quadrant.
An example of cross-innervation can be seen in the pupillary light reflex.
Following a unilateral stimulus, some of the optic nerve fibers travel to the pretectal nucleus. Here some cross in the posterior commissure to synapse in
bilateral Edinger-Westphal nuclei. The signal to constrict the pupil leaves the
Edinger-Westphal nuclei through the pretecto-oculomotor tract, joining the
oculomotor nerve (CN III). With CN III, these fibers synapse in the ciliary
ganglion, finally transmitting the signal to the bilateral pupillary constrictor
muscles.
Different areas of the visual cortex have different function in visual perception and integration. For example, the primary visual cortex reacts to lines,
linear boundaries, and bars with specific rotational orientation. The endpoint
of such a line or angle is perceived by the prestriate cortex. This area also
responds to form, motion, and color. The neurons detecting multiple lines and
patterns converge onto feature detector neurons, leading to complex image
recognition, such as that of a familiar object or face. The inferior temporal
gyrus allows for discrimination and understanding the significance of visual
forms and colors. For example, the inferior temporal gyrus perceives hands
and faces, and interprets and recalls visual memories. The posterior parietal
lobe allows for appreciation of the spatial relationships between objects, providing localization and navigation of visual space.
This ability to recognize lines and angles can be limited by exposure to
images during early brain development. For example, in children with strabismus (crossed eyes) or an astigmatism the distorted angle of the eye will not
lead to the stimulation of the appropriate area of the retina, leading to conflicting visual signals being transmitted to the cortex. This may lead to a condition known as amblyopia, where one eye is favored by the brain and the
other eye is ignored in order to block out the conflicting information.
Therefore, the visual cortex responding to the nonfavored eye does not develop
appropriately. Animal models show that exposure to lines of only one orientation leads to cortical development only of cells responding to lines of that particular orientation.

CLINICAL CASES

333

The superior colliculus is also involved in tracking (responses to stimulus
movement), orienting, and saccadic eye movement. It receives topographic
input from the ipsilateral optic tract and visual cortex, projecting to the thalamus. In hydrocephalus, impingement on the superior colliculus is what leads
to Parinaud syndrome (“setting sun” sign).
Understanding the visual pathways allows one to approximate the location of the lesion causing certain symptoms. For example, a lesion distal to
the optic chiasm (eg, optic nerve, retina) would lead to symptoms only in the
affected eye. As in our case above, lesions to the optic chiasm lead to bitemporal hemianopsia. After the crossing of fibers in the chiasm, each optic tract
contains input only from the contralateral half visual field, perceived on the
ipsilateral hemiretina of bilateral eyes. Therefore, a lesion of the optic tracts
leads to an incongruous homonymous hemianopia. Optic radiation lesions
lead to bilateral quadrantanopia. A lesion of the temporal optic radiation
leads to a contralateral upper visual field deficit, whereas a lesion of the parietal lobe radiation leads to a contralateral lower visual field deficit. A similar result occurs with injury to the primary visual cortex. For example,
unilateral damage to the primary visual cortex inferior to the calcarine fissure (input from the inferior contralateral hemiretina) leads to vision loss of
the superior visual field. Lesions of both the primary visual cortex and the
radiations generally spare the macular area. This area is damaged secondary
to posterior lesions, and leads to a homonymous hemianopia of the central
visual field.
Treatment options for a prolactinoma: Because dopamine normally
inhibits prolactin secretion, prolactinomas can be treated with dopamine
agonists such as bromocriptine or cabergoline. Radiation has a limited role
in the treatment of prolactinoma. If medical therapy fails to restore normal
pituitary function, is poorly tolerated, or if symptoms and tumor size
progress or persist, the patient should consider a transsphenoidal pituitary
adenomectomy. Unfortunately a high number of these tumors do recur
(20%–50%).

D. Interruption in the Edinger-Westphal nucleus would account for
the symptoms. This patient has a “blown pupil” which is a sign of
trans-tentorial brain herniation. This is likely from increased intracranial pressure from an intracranial bleed she suffered from her fall.
The uncus herniates downward, compressing, among other structures, the oculomotor nerve, which is carrying the parasympathetic
fibers from the Edinger-Westphal nucleus to the sphincter muscle of
the iris. Interruption of these fibers results in unopposed sympathetic
innervation to the dilator muscle, resulting in a maximally dilated
pupil that does not react to light.

[42.2]

B. The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the thalamic relay for
vision. Each nucleus receives information from the contralateral
visual field (ipsilateral temporal and contralateral nasal fibers) in a
somatotopically oriented manner. It engages in some processing of
the image, and then projects to the striate cortex (primary visual cortex), retaining its somatotopic organization. The medial geniculate
nucleus is the thalamic relay for sound.

A. The concern with this tumor is that if it continues to increase in
size, it will block vision in the child’s eye, which will result in deprivation amblyopia. When the developing visual cortex does not
receive information from one of the eyes because of a defect in the
visual pathway, it begins to ignore the input from that eye since it
conflicts with what the other eye sees. In a young child like this, deprivation for as little as 1 week can result in this process being irreversible. Although structurally the visual system works, there will
never be any conscious perception of vision out of the affected eye.

CASE 43

A 67-year-old right-handed male returns to the neurology clinic with his wife
for follow-up after a right middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke. His wife says
that he has been recovering well; however, he has some behaviors which are
concerning to her. For example, she must be standing on his right side in order
for him to acknowledge her. When he eats, he only eats food of the right side
of his plate. Looking at the patient you realize he has only shaven the right side
of his face.
Physical examination is notable for a left facial droop, 2+ strength of the
left arm, and 3+ strength of the left leg. When you call his name while
standing on the patient’s left, he turns his head to the right. The patient does
not blink to threatening stimuli from the left side. The patient is asked to
draw a clock and is only able to reproduce the right side.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43: SPATIAL COGNITION
Summary: A 67-year-old right-handed male presents with left-sided neglect
following a right MCA stroke.

◆

Reason for the patient’s behavior: Hemineglect, which is more
common in patients with cerebral lesions on the right (33%–85%) rather
than the left side of the brain (0%–24%).

◆

Other symptoms seen with a right MCA stroke: The motor deficits
including weakness of the face and arm more than the leg. As with
95% of the right-handed population, Broca and Wernicke areas appear
to be on the left in this patient and are, therefore, not affected by the
stroke. Other language deficits, include problems with prosody and
nonverbal cues (see Case 46 for language disorders), behavior and
attention (eg, extinction), autonomic dysfunction, and hemianopia.

◆

Tests to elicit the symptoms of neglect: When patients are asked to
bisect a line, and they do so far to the right of center. If you were to show
a photo or drawing to the patient and ask her to copy the image, she may
copy only the right half of the image, or transfer the entire image to the
right side of the paper. One may also ask the patient to verbally identify
objects in the neglected field of vision. When asked to identify the rightsided limbs, a patient may not be able to recognize them as her own.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Strokes provide important information about the function of the brain under
normal as well as pathological circumstances. In this case, the stroke elucidated the importance of the right brain in global spatial cognition. Overall, for
the majority of patients the poststroke visuospatial dysfunction will resolve.
For the remaining 10%–20% of patients who have difficulties lasting greater
than 3 months, rehabilitation and safety are the most concerning issues. The
motor weakness secondary to stroke is compounded by the difficulties in
rehab participation. For example, to have the patient practice strengthening
their right arm muscles, he must first believe he has a right arm to move.

CLINICAL CASES

Definitions
Extinction: Inattention to one stimulus when two stimuli are presented
simultaneously.
Visual (hemi)neglect: Failure to give proper attention to the external environment.
Hemi-inattention: Failure to give proper attention to one side of the personal space.
Constructional apraxia: Inability to synthesize and comprehend discreet
parts as a whole.
Dressing apraxia: Inability to manage spatial aspects of dressing oneself;
a manifestation of hemi-inattention.
Prosopagnosia: Inability to identify a familiar face, without injury to
visual nervous system.
Agnosia: Inability to recognize and identify objects or persons despite
intact memory, knowledge of the objects or persons, and intact sensory
function; generally limited to specific senses.
Allesthesia: Consistently attributing of sensory stimulation on one side to
stimulation of the other side.
Ideational apraxia: Improper sequencing of events (eg, drinking from a
cup and then filling it).

DISCUSSION
In the majority of the population the nondominant hemisphere is responsible for the composition and perception of spatial relations. This includes
synthesizing individual parts of a visual image into a whole, as well as the perception of geometric designs and esthetic patterns. Constructional apraxia
describes the inability to synthesize discrete parts into a whole image. A
cortical or subcortical lesion of the forebrain may have this result.
The function of the nondominant hemisphere includes the interpretation of
extrapersonal space. Self-awareness in terms of personal space and the concept of one’s own body lies in the dominant parietal lobe. A lesion to this
area leads to confusion of left versus right, and an inability to identify body
parts. This has to do with the posterior parietal lobe’s function in the spatial
localization of stimuli, which allows for the recognition of spatial relationships
from the individual to an object, or between objects. Without this essential
analysis of visual-spatial information, the individual cannot orient herself or
objects, nor can she navigate space appropriately, secondary to an inability to
interpret spatial relationships. The superior colliculus is also involved in the
perception of an object’s location. Split brain studies suggest the function of
the superior colliculus to be bilateral.
The posterior parietal lobe fixes visual attention on a particular stimulus of
interest. Right-sided neglect, secondary to an assault to the left side of the brain

340

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

is generally accompanied by an aphasia and, therefore, may be difficult to detect.
Neglect, while generally thought to be secondary to a lesion of the parietal lobe,
can also result from injury to the frontal lobe, thalamus, or caudate. The hemineglect syndrome embodied by the above example has multiple forms, but can
consist of hemineglect, hemi-inattention, visual extinction, allesthesia, anosognosia, anosodiaphoria, nonbelonging, visual-field defects, and gaze paresis.
Motor neglect refers to the under use of the side of the body contralateral to
the cerebral insult. This may be mistaken for hemiparesis. With extraordinary
care by the diagnostician, the patient may be encouraged to demonstrate function. Regardless, on examination the affected side shows decreased withdrawal,
and a lack of routine movements, such as repositioning a limb when in an
uncomfortable position. Likewise, when the patient falls toward the affected
side, there is no reflexive effort to protect against injury. Attempts at rehabilitation may be successful, and a recent study indicated that limb activation and
cueing may lead to a reduction in unilateral visual neglect (Bailey, 2002).
Bilateral occipital temporal lesions result in visual agnosia. As the primary visual cortex is intact, the patient has normal visual fields and acuity;
however, when a known object is presented visually, it cannot be named. The
object can be verbalized when presented via other sensory modalities such as
tactile, auditory, or olfactory. Occipitotemporal lesions may also lead to environmental agnosia.

COMPREHENSION QUESTIONS

A 54-year-old man presents to your clinic because he feels like he is
“losing his mind.” Recently, he has become less and less able to identify
objects while looking at them, although he has no difficulty seeing
and describing what objects look like. On examination you find that
he is in fact not able to name objects based on visual stimulus alone,
but when he is able to touch the object as well, he has no difficulty in
naming the object. A lesion to what part of the brain would best
account for these symptoms?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Dominant hemisphere occipital-temporal region
Nondominant hemisphere occipital-temporal region

Answers
[43.1]

B. Deficits in visuospatial perception are attributed to lesions in the
dominant parietal lobe. Lesions to the nondominant parietal lobe are
more commonly associated with a contralateral hemineglect syndrome.

[43.2]

A. Hemineglect syndromes (when the patient cannot recognize nor
respond to stimuli that are coming from either the right or the left half
of his body or visual field) occur from lesions in the contralateral parietal lobe, and occur more commonly with lesions in the nondominant
parietal lobe than in the dominant parietal lobe. This patient may
additionally have some left-sided paresis and anesthesia, although it is
very difficult to diagnose that in the face of a neglect syndrome.

[43.3]

C. This man is presenting with visual agnosia, an inability to recognize
objects based on vision, which is caused by a lesion to the bilateral
occipital-temporal region that interrupts the communication between
the visual cortex and the association cortex where objects are identified. If the lesion is unilateral, the object can still be identified if it is
viewed in the ipsilateral visual field (which projects to the contralateral
brain, where there is no lesion). Vision remains intact, but no information is getting to the association cortex, so identifying the object
becomes impossible. Communication between other sensory cortices
and the association area are intact, however, so when presented with
stimuli of a different modality, the object can be recognized.

CASE 44

A 72-year-old male presents to the emergency room following a sudden onset
of headache, weakness, and inability to speak. His family says 2 hours ago he
was out in the yard gardening when he complained of a severe headache. He
began to experience weakness on the right side of his body, and eventually
could not respond verbally to his family. His daughter states that the patient has
a history of high cholesterol and high blood pressure. The patient is righthanded.
On examination he has a left facial droop, his eyes look to the right, and he
does not spontaneously move the left arm. The patient, while awake, does not
follow commands and does not communicate with the physician or his family
members. The physician diagnoses the patient as having a cerebrovascular
accident (CVA).

ANSWERS TO CASE 44: LANGUAGE DISORDERS
Summary: A 72-year-old right-handed male presents with sudden-onset hemiplegia and global aphasia, diagnosed with a stroke.

◆

Artery most likely affected: As mentioned above, this patient has
suffered an ischemic stroke of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The
occlusion of this vessel at the trunk leads to contralateral hemiparesis,
global aphasia, and ipsilateral eye deviation (secondary to injury to the
lateral gaze center). In 70%-90% of right-handed people, the left
cerebral hemisphere controls language.

◆

Treatment options for MCA stroke: In patients with depressed levels
of consciousness, one must first ensure the airway is protected. Blood
pressure control is important to maintain perfusion to the brain, and the
parameters depend upon if the patient is a candidate for tPA. Treatment
with tPA is most successful if given within 3 hours from the onset of
symptoms. It is important to monitor for brain edema and resulting
increases in intracerebral pressure. Treatment with mannitol or
hyperventilation may be necessary.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Death from stroke continues to be the third highest cause of mortality in the
United States, with an incidence of 750,000 new strokes each year. For the
nearly 80% of people who survive the initial insult, the morbidity is significant, making strokes the leading neurological cause of long-term disability.
The most common vessel to be affected is the middle cerebral artery (MCA).
The language centers of the brain are supplied by this vessel, the occlusion of
which leads to difficulties in speech and/or interpretation of language. In fact
the most common cause of aphasia is stroke.

APPROACH TO LANGUAGE DISORDERS
Objectives
1.

Understand the neuroanatomy of language.
Be familiar with multiple language disorders.
Be familiar with the terminology of speech, language, and the resulting
disorders.

Definitions
Affective agnosia: The inability to perceive or comprehend emotional intonation of speech, occurring as a result of injury to the right temporoparietal region.

CLINICAL CASES

345

Agraphia: Acquired inability to write, or express oneself in written language; may occur without aphasia, but generally seen in association.
Alexia: Acquired, complete inability to recognize or comprehend written
language, seen in association with aphasia.
Anomia: Word-finding difficulty or inability to name an object. Affected
patient may describe the function of the object rather than provide the
name. Patient may recognize the name when given.
Anosognosia: Disabled patient unaware of his or her disability.
Aphasia: Acquired lack of comprehension or expression of language,
which may include speech, writing, and signing.
Apraxia: Normal muscle function, but an inability to coordinate voluntary
movements, such as in speech formation.
Aprosody: Lack of intonation or emotion in speech. Occurs as a result of
injury to the right hemisphere (temporoparietal) and basal ganglia, or in
Parkinson disease.
Auditory agnosia: The loss of ability to interpret auditory stimuli, despite
having knowledge of the characteristics of the stimuli. For example, one
may know what a car is and what it sounds like, but when presented with
the sound of a car, it cannot be identified.
Broca area: Injury to this area in the inferior frontal lobe leads to an inability to formulate speech, with intact comprehension (expressive aphasia).
Dysarthria: Weakness of the muscles required for speech production, or
damage to the lower brain functions that control speech.
Dyslexia: Developmental disorder of perception of written language.
Dysphagia: Difficulty swallowing.
Dyspraxia: Inability to organize movement.
Jargon aphasia: Meaningless sentences filled with neologisms, incoherent
arrangement of standard words, or a combination of both.
Neologistic distortions: A recently created term or phrase. In neurologic
disease, this may include words where the definition is only known by
the patient.
Paraphasic errors: Instead of the desired word, the patient produces
wrong word or wrong wordlike sounds, substitution or addition of inappropriate sounds, syllables, or words in efforts to speak. Includes literal
(phonological), neologistic, and semantic (verbal).
Wernicke area: Injury to this area in the superior temporal lobe leads to an
inability to comprehend language (fluent/receptive aphasia).

DISCUSSION
Interpersonal communication is essential for an independent existence.
Language disorders limit a patient’s ability to communicate and, therefore,
carry significant morbidity. Language disorders occur as a result of mechanical
or cognitive problems and can be either receptive (input) or expressive (output).
The main areas of understanding and composing language are Wernicke and

346

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Broca areas, respectively. Deeper brain structures including the thalamus, also
appear to be heavily involved.
The right and left superior temporal lobes (primary auditory area) receive
auditory input from the eighth cranial nerve (vestibulocochlear). Bilateral
lesions to these areas lead to cortical deafness. Patients with cortical deafness
are able to “hear” sound (thalamus, amygdala), but these sounds cannot be
processed, and therefore, they cannot perceive or comprehend sounds or language. This auditory agnosia is because of a disconnection between the bilateral primary auditory areas and the auditory association areas. Patients with
global auditory agnosia cannot transfer external auditory stimuli to Wernicke
area for language comprehension, and as a result they are still able to speak,
but cannot perceive their own speech.
Examples of mechanical problems include damage to the anatomy
required for speech formation and damage to the nerves innervating the musculature. For example, prolonged intubation can injure the vocal cords, leading to difficulty in phonation. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrig
disease leads to a selective attack of central nervous system motor neurons
that control voluntary muscles. Therefore, many patients present with “thick
speech” secondary to weakness of the muscles required to speak. This type
of language disorder is referred to as dysarthria. Additional causes of
dysarthria include brain injury to the motor cortex (stroke, traumatic,
tumors, cerebral palsy), developmental disorders (dyspraxia, spasmodic dysphonia), and other neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson’s, Huntington’s,
Multiple Sclerosis).
A significant amount of knowledge about the function of certain regions
of the brain has been derived from stroke patients. The limitations of a patient
after a stroke can be correlated with the area of the brain affected by an
ischemic incident. An infarction of the dominant inferior frontal lobe (insula
and frontoparietal operculum, Broca area), leads to an expressive or motor
aphasia. If the patient has a Broca aphasia secondary to stroke, frequently
this will be accompanied by a motor weakness, because of the fact that Broca
area and the motor strip are adjacent. In Broca aphasia, the patient is able to
understand language; however, he or she has great difficulty producing language. These patients speak in short phrases without intonation, using agrammatic or “telegraphic speech.” For example, if a patient wanted to say “I
would like to eat dinner out on Friday,” she instead may say, “dinner eat.” The
inability to put into context these two words makes it difficult to convey the
meaning of the phrase. Patients with Broca aphasia can hear and understand
their own speech impediments, and therefore, may become frustrated with
their inability to effectively communicate. If the right frontal-temporal
emotional-melodic speech areas are functional, the patient may retain the
ability to swear and sing. Deep frontal or cingulate gyrus lesions leads to the
loss of prosody.
Damage to Wernicke area (posterior temporal, inferior parietal, lateral
temporo-occipital regions), leads to a fluent or receptive aphasia. This may

CLINICAL CASES

347

result from the occlusion of the lower division of the MCA bifurcation or one
of its branches. The patient creates speech easily and with inflection, however,
the string of words lacks meaning. These strings of nonsensical gibberish may
include neologistic and phonetic distortions, word and sound substitution, confusion of semantic and phonetic information, perseveration, and the loss of
normal conversation pauses. Language structure (eg, grammar) remains intact.
Rather than saying, “I would like to eat dinner out on Friday,” patients with
Wernicke aphasia would say, in a pressured sentence, “you see with seeds on
the day to donsumit that I wanted you to know I like schwaddle for the eating
of that porridge so what’s up do you see.” This can deteriorate into jargon
aphasia. Unfortunately, patients with Wernicke aphasia cannot understand
their own speech, and as a result are unaware of their own limitations.
Information is transmitted from Wernicke to Broca areas via the arcuate fasciculus. Lesions involving the supramarginal gyrus, angular gyrus,
insula, auditory cortex, or left temporal lobe may injure these axonal fibers
connecting the two regions. This leads to conduction aphasia, where patients
cannot repeat words or read out loud and have difficulty naming. The ability
to comprehend language (both oral and written) would remain intact. These
patients understand that they have some difficulty with language and if they
make a mistake, will attempt to self-correct.
Whereas in conduction aphasia the language areas are separated from each
other, in transcortical aphasia the speech areas are connected to each
other but not to the rest of the cerebral axis. This isolation of the speech
area occurs because of ischemia of the surrounding cortex, disconnecting the
process of language from any meaningful association or interpretation by
higher brain functions. The patient has the ability to create and absorb language; however, because of the disconnect, has nothing to say and cannot
interpret what is said. The patient does have the ability to generate automatic
responses of previously learned phrases, prayers, or songs.
As in the initial case example, injury to both Broca and Wernicke areas
leads to a global aphasia. Global aphasia means the patient can neither understand nor formulate meaningful language. This is a devastating condition, as
the patient has no means to communicate with the outside world, nor can the
world communicate with the patient. Generally, patients with global aphasia
also have a corresponding hemiplegia.
All of the above examples generally result from an insult to the dominant
hemisphere for language (left, for the majority of the population). Language
disorders also occur with injury to the right or nondominant hemisphere.
For example, patients with right language area lesions may have difficulty
organizing their speech, leading to difficulties in communication. Likewise,
reasoning disorders lead to an inability to understand abstract language
(parables, sarcasm, metaphors, humor) and pragmatics (intonation, body
language, facial expression). Finally, social judgment may be impaired,
leading the patient to say inappropriate things without realization that he or
she has done so.

Answers
[44.1]

A. The lesion is most likely in the dominant pars opercularis and
triangularis of the inferior frontal gyrus. This woman is presenting
with Broca aphasia, also known as a productive aphasia. She is able
to understand speech, but has difficulty in producing it. Because she
can understand her own speech, she is able to recognize that it is deficient, which commonly causes a great deal of frustration in these
patients. Broca area is located in the inferior frontal gyrus of the dominant hemisphere, adjacent to the motor cortex responsible for controlling speech organs.

[44.2]

D. This man is presenting with Wernicke’s aphasia (fluent or receptive aphasia) caused by a lesion in the Wernicke’s area, which is
located in the dominant hemisphere’s (left in this patient) posterior
aspect of the superior temporal gyrus. This area is responsible for
comprehending speech and generating comprehensible speech.
Damage to this area results in an aphasia where the patient has no
problem creating speech (it is fluent), it simply does not make sense.
Although this man is left handed, there is still a 70% likelihood that
he is left hemisphere dominant.

[44.3]

B. This patient is presenting with a conduction aphasia secondary to
a lesion in the dominant arcuate fasciculus, the fiber tract connecting
the Wernicke and Broca areas. Because this disorder affects the communication between Wernicke and Broca areas, common findings
include difficulties with reading aloud and the inability to repeat
words and phrases.

CASE 45

A 67-year-old woman is brought into the neurology clinic by her husband for
increasing episodes of forgetfulness. The husband states that over the last several years she has had difficulty remembering the locations of her belongings,
recalling friends’ names, and has even gotten lost several times in their neighborhood where they have lived for the last two decades. The woman suffers
from osteoarthritis, but takes only ibuprofen and is otherwise healthy. Based on
this presentation, the physician diagnoses the patient with Alzheimer disease.
The patient is alert and oriented only to self and partly to place (can name the
state, but cannot recall the city). She is mildly disheveled. A thorough neurological examination reveals no focal deficits; however, the patient at times has difficulty following directions. She scores 12 out of 30 on the mini mental status exam
(MMSE). Her copy of the interlocking pentagons is as follows.

The remainder of her physical examination is normal. Routine laboratory tests
show mild hyperlipidemia, but her complete blood count, cobalamin, liver enzyme
levels, blood cortisol levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and rapid plasma
reagent are all normal. A head CT reveals diffuse cerebral atrophy with dilation of
the perihippocampal fissure. A diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made. The
patient is placed on a combination of medical and behavioral interventions.

Cortical lesions of Alzheimer disease: These include neurofibrillary
tangles and senile plaques, occurring mainly in the medial temporal
lobe.

◆

Treatment options: Behavioral modification and psychotropic
medication seek to mediate the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer
disease. Cholinesterase inhibitors attempt to counter the pathophysiology
of the cerebral decrease of acetylcholine. N-methyl-D-aspartate
antagonists are utilized at the end stages of the disease. Antidepressants
help significantly with corresponding mood disorders. Other
investigational treatment modalities include estrogen receptor modifiers,
anti-inflammatories, free-radical scavengers, and certain antibiotics.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Alzheimer disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting
mainly elderly individuals. As the most common cause of dementia, it is a
major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. It affects both
men and women, the majority of whom are more than 60 years old. Initially,
short-term memory is affected greater than long-term memory.
As the disease progresses, patients begin to experience behavioral changes,
psychiatric symptoms, difficulty with higher cortical function, and decreased
abilities to care for activities of daily living. Alzheimer disease is a clinical
diagnosis; therefore, it is important to rule out any treatable cause for dementia. There is no cure for Alzheimer disease. Other causes of dementia include
vascular, pharmacological, HIV, delirium, dementia with Lewy bodies, multiinfarct, Pick disease, head trauma, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, normal pressure hydrocephalus, frontotemporal dementia, Lyme disease,
neurosyphilis, prion-related diseases, thyroid disease, Wilson disease.
Current treatments look to prevent or slow the progression of the disease,
so far with minimal success.

Retrograde amnesia: It is the inability to recall events occurring before the
onset of amnesia; may be temporally graded (ie, distant events are easier to recall than more recent ones).
Consolidation: It refers to short-term memory conversion to long-term
memory.
Long-term potentiation (LTP): It includes molecular process strengthening groups of repeatedly used synapses.
Hippocampus: It is located in the medial temporal lobe; from the Greek
word for seahorse; responsible for memory consolidation.

DISCUSSION
The neurocircuitry of memory includes the medial temporal system (right and left
hippocampus, entorhinal cortex) and the medial diencephalic system (mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, mamillary bodies, mamillothalamic tracts). Working
or short-term declarative memory is stored in the prefrontal cortex. Conversion
into long-term declarative memory utilizes both the medial temporal and diencephalic systems. Long-term memories are stored diffusely throughout the cortex,
most likely in the areas responsible for the perception of the initial stimulus. The
hippocampus does not seem to play a role for short-term memory, procedural
memory, or the end storage of memory. The hippocampus is required for declarative memory consolidation. The cerebellum integrates procedural memory,
which is then transmitted to the basal ganglia for storage and coordination.
The physiology of the formation of memories most likely involves LTP.
LTP may not be sufficient, but it appears to play a significant role. Studies have
shown that hippocampal neurons, when regularly stimulated, convert this constant level of presynaptic stimulation into a larger postsynaptic output. The
LTP of a particular neuron may vary depending upon anatomic location and
age. The specific mechanisms detailing how LTP leads to the formation of
memory has yet to be elucidated.

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

Declarative memory follows a particular pathway through the hippocampus. Important structures to note include the dentate gyrus, CA1, CA2, CA3,
subiculum, and the entorhinal cortex (part of the parahippocampal gyrus). A
memory begins as stimulus perceived by the sensory cortex. This information is transmitted by neurons of the entorhinal cortex (hippocampus input),
which traverse the subiculum and dentate gyrus (perforant path) to synapse
in the dentate gyrus. The “memory” then travels to CA3 (mossy fibers), then
CA1 (Schaffer collaterals), and ends up in the subiculum. The subiculum
(hippocampus output) projects axons via the fornix to the hypothalamus and
mamillary bodies or returns to the entorhinal cortex. At that point the
entorhinal cortex relays the information back to the sensory cortex.
Disruption of this pathway leads to an inability to consolidate new memories, while distant memories remain intact. The most famous clinical example
of hippocampus injury is from the patient H.M. On August 25, 1953 H.M.
underwent resection of his medial temporal lobes, thought to be the etiology
of his intractable epilepsy. This included removal of his hippocampus formation, amygdala, entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. From that date onward,
H.M. was no longer able to store new declarative memories to his long-term
memory cortex. He also suffered from moderate temporally graded retrograde
amnesia. H.M. was able to acquire new motor skills (ie, to form new procedural memories); however, he could not recall that he had learned them.
Therefore, H.M. demonstrates the result of bilateral lesions of the medial temporal or medial diencephalic system: anterograde amnesia with temporally
graded retrograde amnesia, intact short-term and procedural memory, and
intact personal identity.
The most common diseases of the hippocampus include Alzheimer disease
and epilepsy. Alzheimer disease severely affects CA1, disrupting memory formation. The hippocampus is also particularly sensitive to global ischemia.

Answers

B. The function of the hippocampus as it relates to memory is in the
role of consolidating long-term memories, or transition from shortterm to long-term memory. Short-term memory involves the prefrontal cortex, and long-term memory seems to be stored diffusely
throughout the cortex, but the hippocampus is integral in the transition between the two. Because of the location of the injury in this
patient, he can recall long-term memories formed prior to the accident without difficulty, and has a perfectly functional short-term
memory. His deficiency comes when he has to store his short-term
memories as long-term memories, which he cannot do.

[45.2]

C. Long-term potentiation in which a given stimulus causes a postsynaptic neuron to alter the way in which it responds to stimuli for a
long time (or permanently) is thought to be very important in the storing of long-term memories. Long-term potentiation involves
metabotropic neurotransmission, which alters gene expression in the
target cell, but metabotropic neurotransmission is not sufficient
alone. The mechanism by which long-term potentiation results in
memory storage has not yet been specifically determined.

CASE 46

A 32-year-old right-handed male has a history of atonic seizures since childhood. He presents to the neurosurgery clinic for a preoperative appointment.
HR’s seizures have been managed unsuccessfully with various high doses of
medication, and he continues to have multiple “drop attacks” each day. He is
resigned to wearing a helmet at all times. He gives a history of multiple occasions when he was not wearing his helmet, suffered an atonic seizure, and
severely injured his head and body. Currently, he requests a corpus callosotomy to attempt to decrease the frequency of his atonic seizures.

ANSWERS TO CASE 46: DISCONNECTION
SYNDROMES
Summary: A 32-year old right-handed male with medically refractory atomic
seizures prepares for a corpus callosotomy.

◆
◆

Purpose of corpus callosum: Communication between the right and
left cerebral hemispheres.
Complications with corpus callosotomy: The acute disconnection
symptoms and signs. Immediately following a corpus callosotomy,
patients may experience acute symptoms and signs from the lack of
communication between the two hemispheres. For example, patients
may suffer from mild akinesia or competitive movements between the
two hands. In fact, some patients express surprise at the purposeful and
independent actions of an “alien” left hand. On examination, bilateral
Babinski responses indicate damage to the brain. Brain edema may
occur secondary to retraction on the brain to reach the surgical site. In
patients with speech and handedness stored in opposite hemispheres,
complete callosotomy may lead to difficulties in the production of
spontaneous speech.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Corpus callosotomy is most effective for atonic seizures, tonic-clonic
seizures, and tonic seizures. Response to the treatment is high, with up to an
80% decrease in seizure frequency after partial callosotomy. The abnormal
focus origin of the seizure will remain; however, that abnormal electrical
activity will not be able to generalize to the other half of the brain. This leads
to a decrease in not only the frequency, but also the severity of the seizures.
In the long term, signs and symptoms of disconnection via corpus callosotomy are indistinguishable from individuals with intact circuitry, with the
exception of certain memory problems and responses under special lateralizing testing situations. The lack of interhemispheric communication does
not seem to affect everyday life. For example, hemispheric specialization
and the inhibition of interhemispheric transfer can be demonstrated when a
right-handed individual is given a familiar object in the left hand (graphesthesia) but cannot name the item. Apparently split brain patients are able to
compensate for these deficits through tricks to trigger the opposite hemisphere. For example, as the right hemisphere may recognize individual
words, a patient may say out loud the name of an object in order to facilitate
retrieval with the left hand.

Objectives
1.
2.

Be able to identify different types of disconnection signs and syndromes.
Know the tests which can be performed to isolate the function of either
hemispheres of the brain.

Definitions
Akinesia: “Freezing” of body movements; difficulty to begin or maintain a
body motion.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum: Congenital lack of interhemispheric
connecting neurons.
Babinski response: Firm stroking of the outer, dorsal heel to the pad of the
foot leads to extension upward and spreading of the toes. Normal in infants
less than 2 years of age. In adults is a sign of brain or spinal cord injury.
Graphesthesia: Tactile ability to recognize letters written on the skin.
Verbal anosmia: Inability to name smells presented only to the right nostril, however, the left hand can use tactile information to find a corresponding object.
Double hemianopsia: Inability to indicate the side of a visual stimulus
with the contralateral hand.
Unilateral anomia: Inability to name an object with purely tactile stimuli.
The object can be named when placed in the right hand.
Unilateral agraphia: Inability to write with the left hand, whereas, the
right hand writes well.
Unilateral apraxia: Inability to perform a verbal command with the left
hand, but is easily performed by the right hand.
Unilateral constructional apraxia: Inability of the right hand to perform
tasks that require the right hemisphere’s abilities of spatial cognition.
Examples include copying geometric forms and completing mathematics that requires writing down procedural steps.

DISCUSSION
Cortical disconnection signs and syndromes present secondary to subcortical
white matter lesions connecting two brain regions. These can be classified as
either intrahemispheric or interhemispheric.
Intrahemispheric disconnection syndromes involve damage to deep white
matter connections between structures within the same hemisphere. In the dominant hemisphere, this can include language. The arcuate fasciculus connects
Wernicke and Broca speech areas. Disruption of this connection leads to retention of fluent speech (although dysphagic) and comprehension; however,
patients have difficulty with repetition. This is referred to as a conduction aphasia,

360

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

as the information received in Wernicke area cannot be transferred to Broca
area. Injury to the white matter connecting the primary auditory cortex and the
auditory association areas leads to a pure word deafness. The patient can “hear”
(ie, the physical and neuronal mechanisms for conducing auditory stimuli from
the ear to the primary auditory cortex are intact), and audiometry examinations
will be normal. Yet the patient will not be able to perceive and process the information, making the patient functionally deaf. A patient with pure word deafness
will exhibit impaired comprehension of speech, but will be able to produce
speech and comprehend written language normally.
Another disorder of language involves the motor apparatus used to produce
speech. Apraxia of the buccal and lingual areas can occur secondary to disconnection between the association motor cortices in the subcortical region.
The patient’s signs include right brachiofacial weakness, and apraxia of
tongue, lip, and left limb movements.
Three main structures allow for communication between the distinct cerebral
hemispheres: anterior commissure (olfactory and limbic), hippocampal commissure (limbic), corpus callosum (hemispheric cortical processing). Interhemispheric
disconnection results from a lesion of the corpus callosum. The acute and chronic
disconnection syndrome is detailed in the previous case questions. One example
of a symptom that may be seen in the acute postoperative period is left-hand
apraxia to verbal commands. This occurs secondary to disconnection of the right
motor strip from the left language area. Unlike unilateral lesions, the acute disconnection syndrome does not include symptoms such as hemineglect and aphasia. In fact, within months most patients appear normal, both in initial social
interactions and on routine neurological examinations. Patients do appear to suffer
from subtle memory, language, and personality deficits, yet split brain patients
provide an important example of brain plasticity. For example, initially left hand
apraxia to verbal commands is a manifestation of the right hemisphere’s poor language comprehension. As there is a contralateral increase in language comprehension and ipsilateral increase in motor control, the left hand apraxia improves.
Agenesis of the corpus callosum, when accompanied by other brain
defects, carries severe symptoms (seizures, mental retardation, hydrocephalus,
spasticity). There are, however, some individuals with isolated agenesis of the
corpus callosum who have normal intelligence, whose deficits are only elicited
upon exercises requiring matching of visual patterns. Many of the minimally
affected patients with callosal agenesis do not manifest the disconnection
signs, compared to an older individual with a corpus callosotomy.
Multiple tests can be performed to isolate the function of either hemisphere. For
example, when a split brain patient sees a chimeric portrait, one image is sent to
the left side of the brain and a distinct image to the right. When asked to point to
the whole picture, the patient will usually choose the image sent to the right hemisphere (facial recognition); however, when required to verbally choose the picture,
the patient will say the image sent to the left hemisphere (speech dominance).
Object location is also not affected, as the superior colliculus has bilateral input for
spatial localization. Stereognostic input from one side is only perceived by the contralateral hemisphere. For a patient with an interhemispheric disconnection

CLINICAL CASES

361

syndrome, an object held in the left hand can only be perceived by the right hemisphere and cannot be named. When different words are presented in either ear, the
ipsilateral pathway from the left ear is suppressed by the dominant contralateral
right ear, and the patient will repeat the word presented in the right ear.

B. The corpus callosum is a bundle of white matter that in the normal brain serves as the major communication between the cerebral
hemispheres and is involved in interhemispheric cortical processing.

362

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

It can be severed to help control severe epilepsy, with fairly good
results in patients with incapacitating seizures. The anterior commissure and hippocampal commissure are involved in the limbic system,
and the posterior commissure is involved in the pupillary light reflex.
[46.2]

C. This patient is experiencing what is known as pure word deafness,
which is caused by an insult to the white matter that connects the primary auditory cortex located in the transverse temporal gyrus of Heschl,
to Wernicke area, located on the posterior aspect of the superior temporal gyrus. This insult inhibits information about heard speech from arriving at the comprehension center in Wernicke area, making the patient
functionally deaf when it comes to speech. They can hear, however, and
will turn to face noises, and they comprehend written words, because
the connections between the visual cortex and Wernicke area are intact.
In cortical deafness, lesions to the bilateral auditory cortex make
patients deaf, although lower brain structures respond to sound, and
with aphasia patients have difficulty generating speech.

[46.3]

D. The arcuate fasciculus connects Wernicke and Broca areas, and a
lesion to it results in what is known as a conduction aphasia. The
primary manifestations of this are difficulties in repeating words and
in reading aloud, as the comprehension of the words in Wernicke area
cannot be communicated to Broca area for generation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 47: EXECUTIVE FUNCTION
Summary: A 23-year-old, posttraumatic brain injury patient presents with
symptoms of disinhibition and personality change.

◆

Region of the brain most likely injured: The frontal lobes, the site of
executive cognitive function, are the most likely area to have been
damaged. The frontal lobes are commonly involved in traumatic brain
injury (TBI), owing to location and size. Likewise, the sphenoid wing
and orbit of the skull damage the brain when applied with force to
the tissue.

◆

Most likely cause of the patient’s symptoms: The frontal lobes are
responsible for executive cognitive function, and are considered the
source of personality and emotional control. Patients with dysexecutive
syndrome have difficulty in social settings requiring intricate thought
processes and intuitive nuances.

◆

When the patient is presented with a novel task: The executive
system facilitates learning, making actions and problem solving less
effortful with repetition. The frontal lobes also function in
conceptualization of abstract problems and following through with a
complex, predetermined plan. Unable to adapt to novel situations and
interactions, combined with a disinhibition of emotional control and
social norms, patients with frontal lobe damage may become easily
enraged.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
The symptoms this patient exhibits suggests that the patient has a frontal lobe
lesion. Lesions in the frontal lobes are known to cause aggressiveness in
patients (ie, Phineas Gage phenomenon) and hinder the patient’s ability to
carry out executive functions. These functions include behaviors such as planning multistep tasks, the capacity for quick switching to the appropriate mental mode, the ability to withstand distractions or internal urges, anticipation,
logical analysis, working memory, multitasking, and decision making.

Perseveration: Persistent repetition of an activity, word, phrase, or movement without any apparent stimulus for it.
Coup/contrecoup: Contusions both at the site (coup) of impact and on the
opposite side (contrecoup) of the brain.
Thurstone (letter fluency, word generation) test: Ask the patient to generate as many words as possible beginning with the letter F in 1 minute.
A normal score for a native English speaker with at least a high school
education is at least 8 words.
Serial 7s: Counting down from 100 by 7s. Tests concentration and memory.
Spelling the word world backward commonly is used as a substitute for
patients who cannot perform calculations of 7s.
Digit span: Also a measure of attention and concentration. A normal span
is seven digits forward and five backward. An abnormal digit span is the
most common neuropsychological deficit in patients with head injury.

DISCUSSION
The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of mammals located at the front of each
cerebral hemisphere, frontal lobes are positioned anterior to the parietal lobes.
The temporal lobes are located beneath and behind the frontal lobes. In the
human brain, the precentral gyrus and the related cortical tissue that folds into
the central sulcus comprise the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts associated with areas of the gyrus. The
frontal lobes have been found to play a part in impulse control, judgment, language production, working memory, motor function, sexual behavior, socialization, and spontaneity. The frontal lobes assist in planning, coordinating,
controlling, and executing behavior. People who have damaged frontal lobes
may experience problems with these aspects of cognitive function, being at
times impulsive; impaired in their ability to plan and execute complex
sequences of actions; perhaps persisting with one course of action or pattern
of behavior when a change would be appropriate.
The executive functions of the frontal lobe involve abstract thinking, rule
acquisition, problem solving, planning, cognitive flexibility, selecting relevant
sensory information, initiating behavior, monitoring behavior via judgment and
impulse control, motor function, executive memory, language, sexual behavior,
and decision making. It allows for adaptation to new environments and the
acquisition of new skills or manners of thinking. This includes insight and
error correction, enabling one to navigate dangerous or technically difficult situations. Important in social functioning, executive cognition allows for the
suppression of strong habitual responses or temptations.
The executive system organizes and prioritizes cognitive resources in such
a way to allow for complex conceptualization of abstract problems and execution of detailed plans and actions. It is required for foresight or temporal

366

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

planning, critical analysis of rules and limitations/abilities, focus for attainment of goals, and reflection for troubleshooting and adaptation. For previously encountered situations, a patient with dysexecutive syndrome could
rely on learned, automatic physical and psychological responses. In novel situations, however, the patient does not have these automatic responses to fall
back on, or the abilities to organize his thoughts in order to deal with the new
circumstances. Patients are unable to reach a particular goal secondary to the
fact that they cannot plan and execute the smaller individual steps to achieve
the desired end. The end result in the patient is seen as apathetic and easily
distractible. This can also be frustrating for a patient, which may lead to outbursts of anger.
Damage to the frontal lobes may occur through traumatic injury, mass
lesions, cerebrovascular, degenerative disease, or infection. For example, the
frontal lobes are affected by normal ageing and pathologic, degenerative
processes such as multiple sclerosis, Huntington disease, and Alzheimer disease. Cerebrovascular disease, such as the occlusion or hemorrhage of the anterior communicating artery, also leads to damage of the frontal lobes. The
dominant neurotransmitter in the frontal lobe is dopamine. Low levels of
dopamine often present as problems in frontal lobe functioning, one example of
such being schizophrenia.
The most commonly cited example of a dysexecutive patient is that of
Phineas Gage. Mr Gage sustained injury to his prefrontal cortex (PFC) following a railroad accident in 1848, where a 4 ft, 13 lb tamping iron went in
under his left cheek bone and out through the top of his head. Mr Gage went
from being an efficient foreman, to an impulsive, profane individual, with an
inability to plan and carry out productive goals. While intelligence is intact,
patients with frontal lobe damage show difficulty with emotional control,
social interaction, and memory. This disinhibition is attributed to a disconnection between the PFC and the autonomic nervous system. Without a “warning” to alert the individual to a dangerous, undesirable, or sensitive situation,
executive decision making is severely hampered. As such, executive cognition
may not act so much to inform us of what behaviors are appropriate, but more
to deter us from inappropriate interactions. The difficulty interpreting environmental stimuli contributes to the previously described social dysfunction
and impaired learning (feedback to guide behavior).
The impulse-control difficulties leading to social dysfunction also may
manifest as utilization behavior. For example, without instruction or reason,
patients may be compelled to use daily objects within their visual field. For
example, if a patient were to see a toothbrush in front of him, he would begin
to brush his teeth, and do so repeatedly, even if he had already brushed his
teeth. When asked why they are using this object without purpose, patients
tend to confabulate. Patients may also perseverate in speech and action.
Spontaneity appears to originate in the frontal lobes as well. Patients
with frontal lobe damage have limited facial expression, and can have either
increased spontaneity of speech (right frontal) or decreased (left frontal).

CLINICAL CASES

Patients may also have deficits of declarative memory or memory for temporal
order of events. Working memory or attention is frequently impaired. This is in
contrast to the declarative memory deficits found with hippocampal damage.

A. The dorsolateral frontal cortex is associated with planning and
strategy formation and lesions here usually cause apathy, poor planning ability, and excessively passive behavior, as seen in this patient.
The frontal lobes in general are involved in executive function, which
consists of, among other things, planning, problem solving, abstract
thinking, judgment, and behavioral inhibition.

[47.2]

B. This man has a lesion in the orbitofrontal cortex, which is associated with behavioral inhibition. Patients with lesions in this area
typically behave poorly in social situation, and often engage in hypersexual behavior, abuse alcohol and drugs, and may engage in compulsive gambling.

[47.3]

D. This patient, who has had a frontal lobotomy, would be expected
to have deficits in executive function such as solving novel problems. Patients with frontal lobe dysfunction can often work their way
through problems that they have experienced before because they can
rely on the learned behavior from prior encounters. When confronted
with a novel situation, however, they have great difficulty in problem
solving and planning what to do.

the emergency department (ED) by paramedics. He cannot recall the crash, but
says he was not wearing a helmet. Currently he is alert and oriented, complaining of nausea, vomiting, and has a left-sided scalp contusion, laceration,
and an underlying bony step-off. You send the patient for a CT scan of the head
and call for an urgent neurosurgery consult. As you are waiting for the operating room, the patient becomes more difficult to arouse and confused. Based on
the patient’s presentation, you make a diagnosis of an epidural hematoma
(EDH).

ANSWERS TO CASE 48: CONSCIOUSNESS
Summary: A 19-year-old male status post unhelmeted motorcycle accident,
presents with head trauma and decreasing level of consciousness. He is
amnesic of the accident, has a lucid interval, then following CT scan becomes
obtunded. The CT scan reveals an EDH.

◆

Artery affected: The middle meningeal artery runs on the surface of
the dura, and a rupture of this artery leads to trapping of blood between
the dura and the skull, also known as an EDH.

◆

Most likely cause of this patient’s symptoms: Although not
experienced by all patients with an EDH (<20%), he has a classic
lucency window, where the patient is alert, but then deteriorates rapidly.

◆

The CT scan of the patient’s head likely to reveal: Image of an EDH,
with a depressed open skull fracture. The classic finding of an EDH is
an extraaxial, homogeneous, biconvex, or lenticular lesion, generally
confined by suture lines. This is in contrast to a subdural hematoma,
which follows the convexity of the brain.

CLINICAL CORRELATION
Traumatic brain injury and resulting increases in intracranial pressure (ICP)
may lead to changes in a patient’s level of consciousness. With EDH as with
other supratentorial space-occupying lesions, pressure is placed on the brain,
leading to midline shift. EDH commonly results from laceration of the middle
meningeal artery. Should the ICP continue to increase, contralateral hemiparesis and ipsilateral dilated pupil (secondary to subfalcine herniation and
compression of the third cranial nerve) occurs. Without intervention, this may
progress to flexor and then extensor posturing and patients may exhibit a
Cushing response: hypertension, bradycardia, widened pulse pressure. The
outcome of EDHs such as mortality can range from 5% to 50% depending
upon the patient’s presentation (Glasgow coma scale, GCS), progression, and
other factors, including age, location (eg, posterior fossa vs. temporal), and
size of the lesion. An excellent recovery is predicted for preoperative patients
without normal level of consciousness, and the mortality increases for
obtunded (10%) and comatose patients (20%).

Definitions
Consciousness: Awareness (content) of self and the environment and
arousal (level).
Obtunded: Dulled or blunted.
Stupor: Reduced sense or sensibility.
Persistent vegetative state: Wakefulness without awareness, intact
sleep/wake cycles.
Coma: Unarousable, either by external stimuli or inner needs, absent sleep/
wake cycles.
Locked-in syndrome: Paralysis of voluntary muscles except for ocular
movements, no disturbance of awareness.
Oculocephalic reflex (doll’s eye reflex): Conjugate eye movement opposite to head movement in order to maintain forward gaze during neck
rotation. Brain stem lesions lead to absent or asymmetric eye movement.
Calorics: Ice water is placed in the external auditory meatus, leading to a
slow, ipsilateral, conjugate eye deviation.
Ocular bobbing: Conjugate, bilateral fast downward jerk followed by slow
return to mid-position.

DISCUSSION
Consciousness involves the ability to be awake, alert, and aware. Like awareness, arousal is not an all-or-nothing concept, but rather it ranges from inattentiveness, to stupor and obtundation. Consciousness is a complex process,
centered around the reticular activating system (RAS). The RAS is a portion
of the rostral pons (paramedian tegmental zone), continuous caudally
with the spinal cord and rostrally with the subthalamus, hypothalamus,
and thalamic nuclei. Consciousness depends on intact diencephalic connections with the RAS. The ascending acetylcholinergic neurons from the RAS
that project to the thalamus act as an on-off switch, determining if ascending
information arrives at the cortex, and if descending information is likewise
transmitted. The acetylcholine pathways sensitize the thalamic neurons, allowing sensory input. This leads to an “awake” state.
Disturbances of consciousness have multiple etiologies, including traumatic injury, metabolic disturbances, psychiatric, infarction/hemorrhage, brain
stem disorders, neoplastic, and toxins. Coma requires damage of the bilateral
cerebral hemispheres, bilateral thalamic/hypothalamic lesions, and/or the
RAS. As described in the case, increases in ICP can lead to tentorial herniation and compression of the brain stem RAS. Comas are generally caused by
lesions rostral to the level of the pons.
The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is a validated physical examination scoring system to evaluate level of consciousness, shown to be predictive
of certain outcomes following neurological injury. It is determined by three
categories: eye, verbal, and motor. They are scored as follows, with a maximum

372

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

of 15 and a minimum of 3: eye: open spontaneously 4, open to sound 3, open
to pain 2, do not open 1; verbal: responsive and appropriate 5, confused 4,
unintelligible 3, moans to pain 2, no noise 1; motor: follows commands 6,
localizes 5, withdraws 4, decorticate (flexor) 3, decerebrate (extensor posturing) 2, no movement 1. The GCS < 6 arbitrarily defines coma as a failure to
open eyes in response to verbal command (E2), perform no better than weak
flexion (M4), and utter only unrecognizable sounds in response to pain (V2).
The eye examination provides important insight into the origin of the
decrease in consciousness. In an insult to the bilateral hemispheres, the papillary examination and oculocephalic response is normal. As was mentioned in
the case, supratentorial mass lesions lead to secondary brain stem compression
and a blown pupil on the same side as the lesion. Brain stem lesions lead to
abnormal oculocephalic responses. Patients with metabolic disturbances have
normal pupils. An intact pontine reticular formation allows the patient to blink,
either spontaneously or in reaction to stimuli. If the oculocephalic response is
absent, progress to the calorics evaluation. Roving eye movements occur with
intact third nerve nuclei and connection, meaning the insult is likely
toxic/metabolic or bihemispheric. Seizures lead to contralateral conjugate eye
deviation. Acute pontine lesions lead to ocular bobbing.
The red nucleus is important for the localization of a lesion affecting consciousness. Output from the red nucleus reinforces antigravity flexion of the
upper extremity. When this is lost, unregulated reticulospinal and vestibulospinal tract output reinforces the extension tone of the extremities. If the
patient has an upper motor neuron lesion above the red nucleus, the patient will
have flexor or decorticate posturing. Upon receipt of painful stimulus, the
patient will have upper limb flexion with pronation of the forearm, and lower
limb extension with foot inversion. Below the level of the red nucleus but above
the level of the vestibulospinal and reticulospinal nuclei, decerebrate posturing
will occur. Decerebrate posturing is the extension and pronation of the upper
extremities with extension of the lower extremities. With a lesion of the
medulla, descending corticospinal tract is disrupted, leading to acute flaccidity.

You are examining a patient who is comatose in the ICU. Your first
item of examination is to check basic brainstem reflexes, and you
start with the pupillary reflexes. Shining your light into either of the
patient’s eyes results in equal direct and consensual pupillary constriction. Based on this finding alone, where would you localize the
lesion causing the coma?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Diffuse cortical damage
Midbrain damage
Pontine damage
Medullary damage

You are examining an unresponsive patient, brought into the ED by
EMS. When presented with a painful stimulus, the patient responds
by flexing all of his extremities (decorticate posturing, score 2 on the
motor section of the GCS). This response indicates motor output
directed by what level of the nervous system?
A.
B.
C.
D.

Cerebral cortex
Red nucleus
Pontine reticular formation
Vestibular nuclei

Answers
[48.1]

D. Consciousness depends on the interaction between the intact cerebral cortex and the RAS, and damage to either or both of these
structures or the communications between them can cause lack of
consciousness, or coma. The RAS serves as a gate which determines
whether or not sensory input is relayed to the cortex, so without it, no
information reaches the cortex, making it unable to interact with the
outside world. Diffuse injury to the cortex can also cause coma,
because although information can reach it (the RAS is intact) there is
no cortex available to process.

[48.2]

A. Because of the variety in this patient’s symptoms, there seems to be
multiple lesions accounting for diffuse cortical damage. Intact pupillary reflexes indicate intact and functioning midbrain and lower. The
reflex depends on intact structures in the superior colliculus and the
oculomotor complex, both of which reside in the midbrain. In a patient
like this diffuse cortical dysfunction is the likely cause, possibly from
hypoxic-ischemic injury to the cortex or a metabolic encephalopathy.

[48.3]

B. Motor outflow from the red nucleus, through the rubrospinal tract
stimulates antigravity flexion of the extremities. Interruption of
descending motor control between the cortex and red nucleus leaves
it as the primary motor outflow, resulting in decorticate (flexor) posturing. Interruption of motor control below the level of the red

374

CASE FILES: NEUROSCIENCE

nucleus results in motor outflow being driven by the reticulospinal
and vestibulospinal tracts, which stimulate extensors, resulting in
decerebrate (extensor) posturing.

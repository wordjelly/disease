What is general practice?

What is general practice?
‘Generalism describes a philosophy of practice which is person, not disease,
centred; continuous, not episodic; integrates biotechnical and biographical perspectives; and views health as a resource for living and not an end in itself.’1
In the early 19th century, when apothecaries, physicians, and surgeons provided
medical care, the term ‘general practitioner’ became applied to apothecaries taking the Membership Examination of the Royal College of Surgeons of England.
Over the past 60y, general practice has established itself as the cornerstone of most national healthcare systems. In so doing, general practitioners (GPs or family physicians) have shown the intellectual framework
within which they operate is different from, complementary to, but no less
demanding than that of specialists.
What is medical generalism? The RCGP defines medical generalism
as: ‘An approach to the delivery of healthcare that routinely applies a
broad and holistic perspective to the patient’s problems.’ It involves:
• Seeing the person as a whole and in the context of his/her family and
wider social environment
• Using this perspective as part of the clinical method and therapeutic
approach to all clinical encounters
• Being able to deal with undifferentiated illness and the widest range of
patients and conditions
• In the context of general practice, taking continuity of responsibility for
people’s care across many disease episodes and over time
• Also in general practice, coordinating care as needed across
organizations within and between health and social care
The role of the GP In the UK, >90% of the population is registered
with a GP. GPs diagnose illness, treat minor illness within the community,
promote better health, prevent disease, certify disease, monitor chronic
disease, and refer patients requiring specialist services. General practice is
the primary point of access to healthcare services.
Although patients have an average of 5.5 consultations with their GP every
year in the UK, only 1 in 20 consultations results in a secondary care referral.
Everything else is dealt with in the primary care setting. To do this, GPs must:
• Have a working knowledge of the whole breadth of medicine
• Maintain ongoing relationships with their patients—they are the only
doctors to remain with their patients through sickness and health
• Focus on patients’ response to illness rather than the illness itself,
taking into account personality, family patterns, and the effect of these
on the presentation of symptoms
• Be interested in the ecology of health and illness within communities
and in the cultural determinants of health beliefs, and
• Be able to draw on a far wider range of resources than are taught
in medical school, including intuition, knowledge of medicine,
communication skills, business skills, and humanity

What is general practice?

In addition to day-to-day medical care of their patients, GPs in the UK
have a number of additional roles:
• Gatekeeping GPs control access to hospital-based services, enabling
cost-effective care
• Navigating GPs work with patients/carers to guide them effectively
and safely through the healthcare system
• Service redesign and improvement GPs manage service provision
within their own practices, and beyond their practice boundaries
• Research GPs need critical appraisal skills to understand and apply
relevant evidence to inform clinical decision making. They need to be
competent in collecting and analysing data for service improvement,
and must collaborate effectively in primary care-based research
• Education GPs can be effective teachers in a wide range of contexts,
educating patients, practice staff, medical students and junior doctors,
fellow GPs, and the general public
• Leadership Many GPs have leadership roles—in their own practices,
within their localities, or nationally
What is the difference between GPs and specialists? Marshall
Marinker contrasted the role of generalists and specialists as shown in
Table 1.1
Table 1.1 Differences between GPs and specialists
GPs

Specialists

Exclude the presence of serious disease

Confirm the presence of serious
disease

Tolerate uncertainty—managing
patients with undifferentiated symptoms

Reduce uncertainty—investigating
until a diagnosis is reached

Explore probability seeing patients
from a population with a relatively low
incidence of serious disease

Explore possibility seeing a
preselected population of
patients with a relatively high
incidence of serious disease

Marginalize danger—recognizing and
acting on danger signs even when
diagnosis is not certain

Marginalize error—ensuring
accurate diagnosis and treatment

To perform their roles well, GPs must show empathy for their patients;
engagement and commitment to involve themselves in every aspect of
patient care; appreciation of the limits of their skills and expertise; and
professionalism in their dealings with both patients and colleagues.

What is general practice?

General practice in the UK
Today, along with opticians, dentists, and pharmacists, GPs form the ‘front
line’ of the NHS in the UK, providing primary medical care and acting as
‘gatekeepers’ to the secondary care system.
Workload ~97% of the British population are registered with a GP.
Patients register with a practice of their choice in their area—whole
families are often registered with the same practice. Once registered,
patients stay with that practice for an average of 12y. GPs carry out
~300 million consultations/y in England alone—82% at the surgery and
4% at the patient’s home. 70% of the GP’s total workload is spent with a
patient, while >20% is currently spent on administration.
Working hours Standard working hours are 8 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. on
normal working weekdays for GMS and most PMS practices although
this is currently under review with a proposed change to 8 a.m.–8 p.m.
cover 7 days a week. Practices may provide ‘extended hours’ as a DES
(b p. 21); to qualify, the practice must provide 30min of additional opening time/1,000 registered patients at times agreed with the PCO according to local needs. Some practices also provide OOH care (b p. 21).
How workload is distributed between individual doctors and PHCT staff
is a matter for each practice to decide.
Primary care provider Term used to designate any organization providing NHS primary care services.
Primary care contracts The provider contract with the local PCO
defines services primary care providers will provide, standards to achieve
and payments they will receive. Currently, there are 4 contract types:
• General Medical Services (GMS) (b p. 20)
• Personal Medical Services (PMS) (b p. 28)
• Alternative Provider Medical Services (APMS) (b p. 29)
• Primary Care Led Medical Services (PCLMS) (b p. 29)
Primary care performer list List of all doctors deemed competent
to provide primary medical care held by the PCO.
Partnership Group of self-employed contractors working together for
mutual benefit. A partnership can become a primary care provider as long
as ≥1 partner is a GP. Although traditionally partnerships are made up of
GPs only, practice managers, nurses, allied health professionals, and pharmacists can be included within partnerships.
Independent contractor status Around half of all GPs in the UK
work as independent contractors, providing core primary healthcare services and additional services as negotiated within their contract. As such,
these GPs are self-employed, running small businesses or practices. They
have management responsibilities for staff, premises, and equipment. Since
most GPs receive a profit share, the amount each GP is paid depends not
only on income to the practice, but also expenditure:
Income
• Private work Includes: private appointments (e.g. clinical assistant,
industrial appointments); insurance examinations/reports; private
medical examinations and certificates (e.g. HGV licence applications)
• Income from the NHS GMS, PMS, or APMS contract work

General practice in the UK

Expenditure
• Running costs of the practice Staff salaries; premises (rent, rates,
repairs, maintenance, insurance); service costs (heating, water, electricity,
gas and telephone bills, stationery and postage); training costs, etc.
• Capital expenses Purchase of new medical and office equipment

Salaried GP A GP employed by a PCO, practice, or alternative provider

of medical services (APMS). PCOs and GMS practices are bound by a
nationally agreed model contract, with a salary within a range set by the
Review Body. PMS practices can make their own arrangements. Salaried
posts have advantages for those who do not want to commit to long-term
working within one practice or become involved with managerial tasks.
Pay tends to be less than that of independent contractors.
GP retainer Provides an opportunity for doctors with other commitments to maintain medical skills before returning to full- or part-time
employment at a later date (usually within 5y). Practices approved for the
retainer scheme must provide adequate education, supervision, and support. Members of the scheme must:
• Have ‘licence to practise’ (b p. 69) and maintain their GMC registration
• Work ≥12, but ≤208 paid service sessions a year (one session = 3.5h);
most work 2–4 sessions/wk
• Do ≥28h of educational sessions/y and take a professional journal

Freelance GP or locum Works for practices or PCOs by a regular or
intermittent arrangement or by providing medical cover on a one-off basis.
Tends to be self-employed and charge on a sessional basis. Long-term
locums should make their own pension provision or apply to join the NHS
scheme. Some freelance GPs work from ‘locum chambers’ with administrative support to help with bookings and payments.
GP with special interest (GPwSI) b p. 70
GP registrar GP in 3rd/4th year of specialty training b p. 64
Practice boundaries Practices set geographical boundaries around

their practices agreed with their PCOs. Currently, practices only accept
new patients onto the practice list who live within that boundary. In
England, practice boundaries for patient registrations will be abolished
after October 2014. However GPs will not be required to do home visits
for patients living outside their practice boundaries; these will become the
responsibility of NHS England Local Area Teams.
Practice lists All patients registered with a particular primary care provider. Lists may be open (accepting new patients) or, by agreement with
the PCO for a set period of time, closed to new patients b p. 46.
Polyclinics Also referred to as ‘Darzi centres’ are found in urban centres throughout the UK. They may be owned and run by the NHS, large
GP practices, private companies, or Foundation Trusts. Key features:
•	Large premises serving up to 50,000 patients and housing up to 25 GPs
• GP services alongside other health services, e.g. dentists, pharmacists
• Extended services—consultant outpatient appointments,
physiotherapy, routine diagnostic services, e.g. ECG, X-ray
• Extended opening—urgent care 18–24h/d and routine
GP appointments in the evenings and at weekends

Good medical practice for GPs

Continuity of care A patient seeing the same healthcare worker over
time. In the UK, this has been the norm, but continuity of care is becoming
less available.
Reasons for continuity of care A practitioner’s sense of responsibility
toward his/her patients i with duration of relationship and number of
contacts. Continuity builds trust, creates a context for healing, and i practitioner’s and patient’s knowledge of each other. Evidence:
• i patient and doctor satisfaction
• i compliance
• i uptake of preventive care, and
• Better use of resources (time spent in the consultation, discriminatory
use of laboratory tests, and admission to hospitals)
Patients’ desire for personal care depends on the reason for the encounter. Most find it important to see their own GP for serious medical conditions and emotional problems.
Reasons why continuity of care is becoming less available Problems balancing accessibility, flexibility, and continuity of care:
• Doctor factors Flexible careers, special interests, and managerial
responsibilities all limit the availability of GPs to their patients
• Patient factors 24h society, in which patients want to be seen at
their convenience rather than when their GP is available, makes it
impossible to maintain continuous care. For minor problems and
emergencies, patients do not mind who they see—as long as they see
someone who can deal with their problem quickly
• System factors Changing roles—nurse practitioners and other
healthcare professionals commonly take on tasks which used to be
done by GPs; clinical governance structures mean that patients with
particular conditions are managed in clinics specifically for those
conditions within the practice; other primary healthcare providers,
e.g. NHS 111, walk-in clinics, and separate out-of-hours cover
arrangements, further fragment care
Rationing A full discussion on rationing healthcare is beyond the
scope of this handbook, but, with continued innovation, rising demand,
and limited resources, it will become an increasingly important factor
in medicine worldwide. To some extent, there is already rationing by
default—medicines and certain treatments are not provided on the
NHS or have very long waiting lists. Government bodies, such as NICE,
evaluate services and develop guidelines for healthcare professionals
about medicines and services which are both clinically and cost-effective.
Inevitably, this will mean that some groups will feel they are being deprived
of the treatment they require. It will remain a contentious issue.

What is general practice?

Stress in general practice
Increasing stress is a feature of society as a whole. GPs score twice the
national average on stress test scores. Similar figures are seen if anxiety
scores are used, and 1 in 4 GPs are classed as suffering from depression if
depression screening tools are used. Burnout describes the syndrome of
emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, low productivity, and feelings of
low achievement. Studies of British GPs consistently find significant numbers of GPs in all age groups are affected.
Causes of stress in general practice Insecurity about work
(particularly changes in NHS structure and complaints), isolation, poor
relationships with other doctors, disillusionment with the role of GPs,
changing demands, work–home interface, demands of the job (particularly
time pressure, problem patients, and emergencies during surgery hours),
patients’ expectations, and practice administration.

Roots of stress Many of the main stressors for GPs appear to be
created or perpetuated by doctors’ own policies: overbooking patients,
starting surgeries late, accepting commitments too soon after surgeries are
due to finish, making insufficient allowances for extra emergency patients,
and allowing inappropriate telephone or other interruptions. Higher than
average pressure scores occur in doctors with fast consultation rates
compared to those with slower rates.
General characteristics of a stressed person at work are Lack of

concentration, poor timekeeping, poor productivity, difficulty in comp­
rehending new procedures, lack of cooperation, irritability, aggression,
withdrawal behaviour, resentment, i tendency to make mistakes, and
resistance to change.

Effects of stress

• Effects on clinical work One study showed frustrated doctors are
more willing to take undesirable short cuts in treating patients; another
that those doctors with negative feelings of tension, lack of time,
and frustration have poor clinical performance (measured by an i
prescription rate and lack of explanation to patients)
• Effects on practices Stress has effects on the practice too, resulting
in mistakes, arguments or angry outbursts, poor relationships with
patients and staff, increased staff sickness and turnover, and accidents
• Effects at home Stressed GPs may develop problems in their
relationships with their partners and family at home, becoming
uncommunicative at home or work, and more withdrawn and isolated
Experience of stress does not necessarily result in damage. The extent of
stress necessary to d performance or satisfaction levels will depend on
the doctor’s personality, biographical factors, and coping methods, but a
concurrent illness or coexisting life event may have additive effects and
can i vulnerability to stress or d ability to cope.
Alcohol Doctors commonly use alcohol as a coping method for stress.
The BMA estimates 7% of doctors are addicted to alcohol and/or other
chemical substances, with half of those addicted to alcohol alone.

Stress in general practice

Interventions and solutions

• Improve your working conditions, e.g. longer booking intervals for
patient consultations; develop a specialist clinical or academic interest
within or outside the practice; learn to decline extra commitments.
GPs with high stress levels do not necessarily have low morale, but
there is a close correlation between levels of job satisfaction and
morale—job satisfaction seems to protect against stress
• Look at your own behaviour and attitudes Stop being a perfectionist;
resist the desire to control everything; don’t judge your mistakes too
harshly
• Look after your own health and fitness Set aside time for rest and
relaxation; make time for regular meals and exercise
• Allow time for yourself and your family Do not allow work to invade
family time. Consider changes in working arrangements to allow more
time for leisure and family
• Don’t be too proud to ask for help As well as formal channels for
seeking help, there are several informal doctor self-help organizations

General practice within the
wider NHS
In 1948, the National Health Service (NHS) was formed, giving free healthcare for the entire population of the UK paid for by the taxpayer. The
NHS is now the largest organization in Europe. The structure of the NHS
varies from country to country within the UK.
England (See Figure 1.1)
• Secretary of State for Health Head of the NHS responsible to
Parliament
• Department of Health (DH) Sets overall health policy in England,
is headquarters for the NHS, and is responsible for developing and
putting policy into practice
• Monitor Independent regulator of healthcare in England
• NHS Commissioning Board Key link between the DH and NHS.
Advises Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) and holds them to
account. Manages the budget allocated to the NHS, distributing it to
CCGs, and also directly commissions primary care and national services
• Healthwatch England Part of the Care Quality Commission.
Provides feedback from service users through a network of Local
Healthwatch organizations to the Secretary of State for Health, NHS
Commissioning Board, Monitor, and local authorities
• Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) Cornerstone of the NHS—
responsible at a local level for planning, providing, and commissioning
health services from service providers, and improving the health/
well-being of the local population
• Health and Wellbeing Boards Work with patients, CCGs, and local
authorities to develop a Joint Strategic Needs Assessment (JSNA) in
order to improve health/well-being of the local population. The JSNA
then influences commissioning decisions across health, public, health
and social care, thus promoting integrated health/social care

Practice in other countries
It is beyond the scope of this book to discuss different systems of healthcare and practice regulations outside the UK; however, in most countries,
there is a registration body (usually termed the ‘Medical Council’) which
ensures doctors are qualified and fit to practise; an organization representing the interests of the medical profession generally (often termed
the ‘Medical Association’); and separate specialist bodies representing the
interests of family practitioners. Details can be obtained from the following websites:

Contracts

Partnership agreements
Partnership disputes are common. A properly drafted partnership agreement may prevent disputes and, if they do occur, may lessen their impact.

Partnership at will A partnership without an up-to-date written
agreement is a ‘partnership at will’, governed by the 1890 Partnership Act.
A ‘partnership at will’ is a very unstable situation as:
• All partners are deemed to have equal profit shares, unless there is
clear evidence to the contrary
• Decisions are made by simple majority
• Notice may be served by any partner on the others without their prior
knowledge or consent
• Dissolution of the partnership may take immediate effect, and no
reason needs be given to justify it
• Dissolution may result in the forced sale of all partnership assets
(including the surgery premises) and redundancy of all staff
• There is nothing to prevent any partner, or group of partners, from
immediately forming a new practice/partnership to the exclusion of the
other partner(s) once the practice is dissolved
Partnership agreements Should be drawn up every time a new
partner joins or leaves a practice. Employed doctors and retainers also
require contracts of employment. An agreement checklist is included in
Box 2.1. Detailed guidance is produced by the BMA, and further guidance
can be obtained from local BMA offices and LMCs.
Partnership disputes However good a partnership agreement is,
disputes still occur. Advice on partnership and employment matters is
available from the BMA and LMC, and the BMA also provides conciliation
services (contact local office). Legal battles are expensive, and the BMA
will not fund partnership disputes. Try to resolve matters amicably.
Discrimination It is unlawful for any partnership to discriminate on
grounds of age, gender, marital status, colour, race, nationality (including
citizenship), ethnic or national origins when appointing a new partner or
in the way they treat an existing partner. The BMA will consider backing
GPs to take such matters to industrial tribunals—contact the local office.
Applications should be made on forms available via local Job Centres and
must be made within 3mo of the last act of discrimination.
Contracts of employment for salaried GPs Model terms and
conditions of service for a salaried GP and a model offer letter of employment
are available from the BMA or DH websites. Nationally agreed salary scales
apply and are compulsory for GMS, but not PMS, practices.

Contracts

General Medical Services Contract
Although there may be some differences in process in each of the four
countries of the UK, the principles of the General Medical Services (GMS)
Contract apply to all.

Primary Care Organization (PCO) PCOs vary across the 4
nations of the NHS but, for the purposes of GP Contracts, are the:
• NHS Commissioning Board in England (NHS England)
• NHS Boards in Scotland
• Local Health Boards in Wales, and
• Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland

The Contract The GMS Contract is a contract made between an
individual practice and a PCO. All the partners of the practice, at least one
of whom must be a GP, have to sign the contract. It includes:
• National terms applicable to all practices (the ‘Practice Contract’)
• A description of which services will be provided by that practice, i.e.
- Essential services
- Additional services if not opted out
- Out-of-hours cover if not opted out
- Enhanced services if opted in
• A level of quality of essential and additional services that the practice
‘aspires’ to
• Support arrangements, e.g. for IT and premises
• A summary of the total financial resources
Essential services Services that all practices must undertake. These
include:
• Day-to-day medical care of the practice population Health
promotion, management of minor and self-limiting illness, and referral
to secondary care services and other agencies as appropriate,
• General management of patients who are terminally ill, and
• Chronic disease management
Additional services Services that the practice will usually undertake
but may ‘opt out’ of. If the practice opts out, the PCO takes responsibility
for providing the service instead. The practice then receives a d global
sum payment. The services included are:
• Cervical screening Opting out results in a 1.1% d in global sum
• Contraceptive services Opting out l 2.4% d in global sum
• Vaccinations and immunizations Opting out of vaccinations and
immunizations altogether results in a 2% d in global sum; opting out of
childhood immunizations leads to a 1% d in global sum
• Child health surveillance (excluding the neonatal check). Opting out
leads to a 0.7% d in global sum
• Maternity services, excluding intrapartum care (which is an
enhanced service). Opting out causes a 2.1% d in global sum
• Certain minor surgery procedures Curettage, cautery, cryocautery of
warts/verrucae and other skin lesions—opting out results in a 0.6% d
in global sum

General Medical Services Contract

Out of hours (OOH) care Practices can ‘opt out’ of providing an
OOH service. The decision must be made for the whole practice—
individual doctors within a practice cannot ‘opt out’ alone. The cost of
opting out for a practice is 7% of the global sum. Practices that have opted
out of OOH can offer surgeries or consultations within the OOH period
as an extended opening hours Directed Enhanced Service by agreement
with their local PCO.
Enhanced services Are commissioned by the PCO and paid for in
addition to the global sum payment. There are 3 types:
• Directed Enhanced Services (DES) Services under national direction
with national specifications and benchmark pricing that all PCOs must
commission to cover their population. These services change from
year to year and include payment targets for childhood immunizations,
influenza vaccinations, and more complex minor surgery, e.g. joint
injections, incisions/excisions
• National Enhanced Services (NES) These services have national
minimum standards and benchmark pricing but are not directed
(i.e. PCOs do not have to provide these services). Examples
include: anticoagulation monitoring; treatment of drug/alcohol misuse;
minor injury services
• Local Enhanced Services (LES) Services developed locally to meet
local needs. In England, these may be commissioned by CCGs, e.g.
special services for refugees

Contracts

GP pay under the GMS Contract
A total sum for GMS services is given to each primary care organization
(PCO) as part of a bigger unified budget allocation. PCOs vary across the
four nations of the NHS, but, for the purposes of GP payments, they are the
NHS Commissioning Board in England, NHS Boards in Scotland, Local Health
Boards in Wales, and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland.

Payment to practices comprises the following components
•
•
•
•
•
•

The global sum +
Quality payments +
Enhanced services payments +
Payment for premises +
IT payments +
Dispensing payments (if applicable)

The Global Sum Major part of the money paid to practices. It is paid
monthly and intended to cover practice running costs. It includes provision
for delivery of essential services and additional/OOH services (if not
opted out); staff costs; career development; and locum reimbursement
(e.g. for appraisal, career development, and protected time).
Quality payments Payment for quality is made in 2 ways:
• Aspiration payments Advance payments to allow practices to
develop services to achieve higher quality standards. Practices agree
their aspirations for quality points the following year with their PCO.
Aspiration payments are made monthly alongside global sum payments
and amount to roughly 70% of the points achieved in the previous
year (for 2012/13, this was equivalent to 2011/12 points achieved ×
£133.76/point × 70% × adjustment for list size and composition)
• Achievement payments Payments made for the practice’s actual
achieved number of points in the Quality and Outcomes Framework
(b p. 26) as measured at the start of the following year. Aspiration
payments that have already been received are deducted from the total
(i.e. actual payment = achievement payment – aspiration pay already
received)
Payment for extra ‘enhanced’ services Paid to practices that

provide Directed Enhanced Services, National Enhanced Services, and/or
Local Enhanced Services.

Payment for premises and information technology GP
premises are funded in many different ways. The GP contract has provision
to reimburse practices that rent their premises the cost of the rent, or pay
practices that own their premises for the use of those premises. The PCO
also reimburses all the IT costs of the practice.

GP pay under the GMS Contract

Dispensing GPs Any GP, in an area classified as rural, may apply to

dispense to any of his/her patients living >1 mile from the local pharmacy,
as long as this would not render the pharmacy’s business unviable. A series
of fees are paid for providing this service in a similar way to that in which
community pharmacists are funded and in addition to the GMS global sum.

Carr-Hill Allocation Formula GMS resource allocation formula for

allocating funds for the Global Sum and quality payments. The formula
takes the practice population and then makes a series of adjustments based
on the profile of the local community, taking account of determinants
of relative practice workload and costs. The resulting ‘allocation factor’
is then applied to the global sum and quality payments made to the
practice—b p. 24.

Minimum Practice Income Guarantee (MPIG) Designed to
protect those practices that lost out when the GP Contract changed
in 2004. It is the difference between the Global Sum allocation (GSA)
under the new GMS Contract and the Global Sum equivalent (GSE)—the
amount the practice would have earned providing the same service under
the old Contract. If GSA < GSE, a correction factor (CF) is applied so that
GSA + CF = GSE. MPIG is now being slowly phased out.
Seniority payments Payment system based on years of NHS service.

Superannuable income is used as a measure of that service. From 2014 this
scheme has not been open to new GPs and it will end for all GPs in 2020.

Contracts

Carr-Hill Allocation Formula
Geographical and social factors result in differing workload for GPs (see
Table 2.2). The Carr-Hill Formula allocates payment to practices on the
basis of the practice population, weighted for factors that influence relative needs and costs in order to reflect the differences in workload these
factors generate.

Age-sex adjustments Older people and children <5y require the most

GP care. The Carr-Hill formula uses an age-sex curve to adjust payments to
practices based on the age and gender of their registered populations (see
Table 2.1).

Nursing and residential homes Patients in nursing and residential
homes generate more workload through i travelling time. The workload
factor applied is 1.43.
List turnover Areas with high list turnovers often have higher
workload, as patients tend to have more consultations in their first year of
registration in a practice. A factor of 1.46 is applied to all new registrations.
Additional needs In the UK (apart from Scotland) Standardized
Limited Long-Standing Illness (SLLI) and the Standardized Mortality Ratio
for those <65y (SMR <65) are best at explaining variations in workload
over and above age and sex. They are related to workload by a complex
formula used to make the payment adjustment.
Scotland SMR <65 together with unemployment rate, elderly people
(>65y) on income support, and households with ≥2 indicators of
deprivation are used in the adjustment formula.

Staff Market Forces Factor (MFF) Reflects geographical variation

in staff costs practices incur.

Rurality Rural practices have i practice costs (see Table 2.2).
Adjustment is made to payments based on a complex formula using
average distance patients live from the practice and population density.
An additional adjustment is made for a few small practices in Scotland to
allow for economies of scale (small practices incur disproportionately high
costs as many expenses—particularly relating to premises—must be met
regardless of practice size).

Contracts

Quality and Outcomes Framework
The Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) was developed for the
GMS Contract, but there are similar arrangements for those working with
other contracts. Financial incentives encourage high quality care.
The domains The QOF is divided into 2 domains (see Table 2.3):
• Clinical indicators, and
• Public health

Indicators Every domain has a set of ‘indicators’ relating to quality

standards that can be achieved within that domain. The indicators are
developed by expert groups based on best available evidence and are
updated regularly. All data should be available from practice clinical
systems. Indicators are split into 3 different types:
• Structure, e.g. is a disease register in place?
• Process, e.g. is a particular measure being recorded? Is action being
taken where appropriate?
• Outcome, e.g. how well is the condition being controlled?
Quality points All achievement against quality indicators converts to
points. Each point has a monetary value.
• Yes/no indicators Points are awarded only if the result is +ve
• Range of attainment For most clinical indicators, it is not possible to
attain 100% results, so a range of satisfactory attainment is specified.
Minimum standard is usually 40–50%. Points are allocated in linear
fashion by comparison of attainment against the maximum standard,
e.g. if the maximum is 90%, the minimum 40% and the practice achieves
65%, the practice receives 25/50 (i.e. ½) of the available points
• Minimum standard All points are awarded if the criterion is met in
more than a certain % of cases
Exception reporting Prevents practices being penalized when unable
to meet targets due to factors beyond their control, e.g. patients fail to
attend for review or medication is contraindicated. It applies to indicators
where level of achievement is determined by % of patients reaching the
designated level. Practices report number of exceptions for each indicator
set and individual indicator. Ensure the reason why a patient has been
‘excepted’ from the QOF is identifiable in the clinical record.
Reporting on quality Since April 2013, most data for calculating QOF
payments have been obtained through the General Practice Extraction
Service (GPES) which takes information directly from GP IT systems.
Summarized data are then used by the Calculating Quality Report Service
(CQRS) to enable calculation of payments for QOF. There is also an annual
quality review visit by the PCO. Based on achievement, the PCO confirms
level of achievement funding attained and discusses points the practice will
‘aspire’ to the following year. The process is confirmed in writing and signed
off by both parties.
0 The GPES and CQRS system are also used for calculating payments for
National, Directed, and Local Enhanced Services.

Contracts

Other provider contracts
Personal Medical Services (PMS) Contract The option to
become or stay a PMS practice remains an alternative contracting
arrangement in the UK. At present, 740% of GP practices in England work
under PMS contracts. Features:
• The GMS Contract is a nationally agreed, locally managed contract;
the PMS Contract is a locally agreed, locally managed contract
• The PMS contract alters the way the primary care provider, not
individual doctor, is paid
• As decision making is closer to the patient, theoretically, PMS Contracts
give better flexibility to meet local needs and solve problems
• Practices are paid to provide a package of services, but PMS Contracts
do not necessarily contain all the elements of the GMS Contract and
may contain others, in addition, by local negotiation. How the practice
provides those services is up to the practice
• As for GMS practices, payments to PMS practices are adjusted for
practice factors that i workload using the Carr-Hill Formula
• Practices can opt out of additional and OOH services
Budget Most PMS budgets consist of:
• Practice costs Staffing, equipment, IT, and premises costs
• Core services Services patients would expect to receive from any GP.
This is equivalent to the GMS Contract’s ‘essential’ services
• Additional services Both those usually expected from a GP
(maternity, minor surgery, contraception) and those usually provided
by other community/secondary care services, e.g. community nursing
or community-based specialist services (e.g. endoscopy, ultrasound).
Extra services not usually provided by the GP are known as ‘PMS
plus’. These services are roughly equivalent to both the additional and
enhanced services under the GMS Contract
• Prescribing budget (optional)
• Dispensing budget (for dispensing practices only)
Quality payments PMS practices can apply for aspiration and achievement
payments in the same way as GMS practices. In order to reflect the local
nature of the contract, quality standards do not have to be the same as
those contained in the QOF. Nevertheless, all standards must be rigorous,
evidence-based, monitored fairly, assessed against criteria agreed between
PCOs/provider, and paid at appropriate rates.
Specialist PMS Provide medical services to meet the needs of special
groups. Patients do not need to be registered for all ‘core’ primary care
services. This enables practices to develop innovative, bespoke models of
service delivery tailored to specific needs of groups poorly served in the
established primary care system. Some examples are:
• Primary care services for vulnerable groups, e.g. the homeless, refugees
• Specialist services, e.g. outpatient elderly care, home-based palliative
care, dermatology, ultrasound, community rehabilitation for stroke
• Specific service provision, e.g. services for violent patients, OOH care,
teenage contraceptive services, sexual health clinics

Other provider contracts

Alternative Provider Medical Services (APMS) PCOs may
commission APMS to provide:
• Essential services,
• Additional services (including where GMS/PMS practices opt out),
• Enhanced services, and
• OOH services

APMS contracts for the provision of primary medical services can be made
with anyone, for example:
• Existing GMS/PMS practices—through a separate contract
• Groups of other healthcare professionals, e.g. community nurses
• Individuals
• Private companies—including those from overseas
• Secondary care trusts
•	Voluntary sector organizations
APMS may be used where specific needs arise, e.g. through practice vacancies or in areas with rapidly expanding populations where extra capacity
is needed.

Primary Care Led Medical Services (PCLMS) Under PCLMS,

primary medical services are delivered directly by employees of the PCO.

Commissioning
In the Health and Social Care Bill (2011), the UK government laid the foundation for groups of GPs and other clinical professionals to group together
in Clinical Commissioning Groups to take on formal responsibility for commissioning the majority of NHS services in England, working in partnership
with other health professionals, local communities, and local authorities.

Aims of commissioning
• To design improved patient pathways
• To enable more efficient use of funds so that savings can be used to
provide better patient services
• To enable improved community and hospital services that better meet
the needs of patients
Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) Every GP practice in
England must be part of a CCG. CCGs do not cross local authority boundaries
unless there is a clear benefit to patients from doing so.
Governing body Every CCG must have a governing body/board that has
decision-making powers. It must meet in public and publish minutes of
meetings. The governing body must include
• ≥2 lay members—one with a lead role in championing patient and
public involvement and the other with a lead role in overseeing key
elements of governance; one of the lay members will either be the
chair or the deputy chair of the governing body
• One registered nurse (not employed by a local provider), and
• One doctor from secondary care (not employed by a local provider)
The commissioning cycle See Figure 2.1
Planning Assessment is made of the needs of the local population and
resources available. Information is provided by advisory groups set up locally
to enable CCGs to do this, national clinical networks (providing expert
clinical advice), and clinical senates providing a regional overview of service
provision. Where identified needs do not have matching resources, the CCG
identifies or develops the necessary resource or capacity to meet that need.
0 CCGs must develop plans in line with the local Joint Strategic Needs
Assessment formed in collaboration with patients and the local authority.
Health and Wellbeing Boards can refer commissioning plans back to the
NHS Commissioning Board if they feel CCGs are not doing this.
Contracting Once resource and need are matched, the CCG commissions
services for local patients. CCGs must offer contracts out to tender to
‘any qualified provider’. A qualified provider may be an existing NHS
organization, or any other organization (including private sector) able to
provide the service required. Contracts should cover quality standards,
access targets, volumes, prices, and other issues identified.
Monitoring Once a provider is selected and a contract is made, the CCG
is responsible for monitoring delivery and ensuring that delivery is kept
on track. Funding passes from the CCG to the provider under the terms
of the contract.
Revision If delivery is not on track or the needs of the CCG change with
time, agreements should be reviewed and revised.

the UK can become involved and influence commissioning decisions by
Primary Care Organizations.

Practice management

GPs as managers
‘If you have time to do something wrong; you have time to do it right’
W. Edwards Deming

GP partners in a practice have dual roles as both clinicians and managers
of small businesses. As such, they must co-operate with their partners and
practice manager to run the business side of the practice and with primary
health care team members to cover all aspects of the clinical work.
Definition Management is the process of designing and maintaining an
environment in which individuals, working together, efficiently accomplish
selected aims. The manager coordinates individual effort towards the
group goal. To do this, he/she needs technical skill (knowledge specific to
the business of the organization); human skill (ability to work with people);
conceptual skill (ability to see the ‘big picture’); and design skill (ability to
solve problems). There are 5 managerial functions:
• Planning Involves selecting missions and objectives and the actions to
achieve them—requires decision making
• Organizing Defining roles—ensuring all tasks necessary to accomplish
goals are assigned to those people who can do them best
• Staffing Ensuring all positions in the organizational structure are filled
with people able to fulfil those roles
• Leading Influencing people so that they will contribute to organization
and group goals
• Controlling Measuring and correcting individual and organizational
performance to ensure events conform to plans
Management and teamwork Key features which contribute to
successful teamwork are:
• Communication Information sharing, feedback, and grievance airing
• Clear team rules Especially with regard to responsibility and
accountability. Make sure these are understood by everyone
• Sympathetic leadership Any team needs a co-coordinator to direct its
efforts. A weak leader may allow the team to drift, but an autocratic
leader may be too directive and diminish the status of other team
members and thus d the effectiveness of the team
• Clear decision-making process Especially if differences of opinion
• Pooling Knowledge, experience, skills, resources, and responsibility for
outcome
• Specialization of function Team members must understand and
respect the role and importance of other team members
• Delegation Work of the team is split between its members. Each
member leaves the others to carry out functions delegated to them
• Group support Team members share and are committed to a
common, agreed purpose or goal which directs their actions
Practice meetings Essential to ensure necessary decisions are made;
review policies and agree standards of care; review the financial position
of the practice; educate and inform practice members; aid communication
and improve morale of practice members.

GPs as managers

Risk management Primary care is about risk and uncertainty,
but sometimes unnecessary risks cause ourselves and our patients
unnecessary harm. Defence organization records suggest 7½ all successful
negligence claims reflect poor clinical judgement on the doctor’s part; the
other ½ represent avoidable mishaps which would be susceptible to risk
management approaches—often failures in simple administrative systems,
communication failures, inadequate records, or lack of training.
Risk management means taking steps to minimize risk and keep ourselves
and others as safe as possible. All the major defence organizations run risk
management programmes for their members. There are 4 stages:
1. Identify the risk—through analysis of complaints and comments from
GPs, other practice staff, or patients; through significant event audit
(b p. 81); or by using material provided by the defence organizations
to identify common pitfalls
2. Assess frequency and severity of the risk
3. Take steps to reduce or eliminate the risk
4. Check the risk has been eliminated
Categories of risk relevant to general practice
• Clinical care, e.g. prescribing errors
•	Non-clinical risks to patient safety, e.g. security and fire hazards
• Risks to the health of the workforce, e.g. hepatitis B
• Organizational risks, e.g. failure to safeguard confidential information
and unlicensed use of computer software
• Financial risks, e.g. employment of a new staff member
Key safety issues for primary care
• Diagnosis 28% of reported errors
• Prescribing 1 in 5 prescriptions contains a prescribing error; one in
550 prescriptions contains a serious error; 9% hospital admissions are
due to potentially avoidable problems with prescribed drugs. 4% of
drugs are incorrectly dispensed each year
• Communication Poor communication is a major cause of complaints;
28% of patients have discrepancies between the drugs prescribed at
hospital discharge and those they receive in the community
• Organizational change In industry, better teamwork, communication,
and leadership d adverse incidents
In each case, consider
• Organizational and management factors Financial resources/
constraints; practice policies; and organization
• Work environment factors Staffing levels; skill mix; work load; equipment
• Team factors Team structure; communication; supervision
• Individual (staff) factors Knowledge and skills; competence; physical
and mental health
• Task factors Availability and use of protocols/guidelines; availability
and accuracy of test results
• Patient factors Condition (complexity and seriousness); language and
communication; personality and social factors

Practice management

Practice staff
Practices employ an array of staff. Staff costs are included in the Global
Sum (b p. 22) paid to a practice.

Recruiting staff
• Review the post—does the post need to be filled or the duties changed?
• Prepare a job description stipulating duties and hours of work
• Prepare a profile of the person required
• Decide on a salary range; the BMA can give advice
• Advertise the post
•	Set a closing date for applications
•	Shortlist candidates
• Interview—decide who will interview, what points must be covered,
and who will ask questions; ask similar questions to all candidates, and
score the responses at the time
• Make a decision on the preferred candidate—if in doubt, defer the
appointment or re-interview preferred candidates
• Confirm the job offer by letter asking for a formal letter of acceptance
in return
• Plan an induction course for the new employee; a probationary period
can be helpful for both employer and employee
• Produce a contract of employment

Employment law Very complex field which changes rapidly. If in
doubt, contact your local BMA office for advice. Major points:
Contract of employment Sample contracts are available from the BMA.
Employees have a contract of employment from the day they accept their
job—even if it is not written. All employees must be provided with a written
statement of the main particulars of their employment <2mo after their start
date. This must include: pay, hours, holidays, notice period, disciplinary and
grievance procedures.
Pay Workers must be paid ≥ the national minimum wage for every hour
worked. Deductions can only be made if authorized by legislation, contract
of employment, or in advance in writing by the employee. All employees
must receive an itemized pay statement at, or before, the time they are
paid, including all deductions.
Notice After 1mo employment, an employee must give ≥1wk notice. An
employer must give an employee ≥1wk notice after 1mo, 2wk after 2y,
3wk after 3y, and so on up to 12wk after ≥12y, unless other notice periods
are specified in the contract of employment.
Redundancy pay After 2y continuous employment, employers must make
‘redundancy payments’ related to employee’s age, length of continuous
service with the employer (to a maximum of 20y), and weekly pay.
Pensions All employees must belong to a pension scheme. The NHS
pension scheme is available to practice employees.

Practice staff

Working time Parents of children <6y or disabled children <18y and
carers may request flexible working patterns; employers have a duty to
consider their requests. Working Time Regulations (1998) apply to agency
workers and freelancers as well as employees and include:
• 20min in-work rest break if the
• Average working week ≤48h
working day is ≥6h
(although individuals can opt to
• 11 consecutive hours’ rest in any
work longer)
24h period (night workers must
• 1d off each week
• Minimum 5.6wk paid annual leave work ≤8h/d)
Time off Employees are entitled to time off for illness; antenatal care;
emergencies involving a dependant; certain public duties (e.g. jury service);
to look for another job; and approved trade union activities.
Maternity leave All pregnant employees are entitled to 52wk maternity
leave (26wk ordinary maternity leave + 26wk additional maternity leave)
regardless of length of service. Women are entitled to return to their
own or an equivalent job after their leave. Similar arrangements exist for
adoptive mothers.
Paternity leave Employees who have worked for their employer for
≥26wk by the 15th wk before the baby is due and up to the birth of the
child are entitled to 1–2wk paternity leave which must be completed within
56d of the birth. Fathers may also claim additional paternity leave for up to
26wk from 20wk to 1y after birth/adoption to look after their child if the
mother returns to work.
Parental leave After 1y employment, employees are entitled to 13wk
unpaid parental leave for each child born or adopted up to the child’s 5th
birthday (or 5y after adopted). Parents of disabled children can take 18wk
up to the child’s 18th birthday.
Health and safety of staff b p. 38
Discrimination Employers must not, either directly or indirectly,
discriminate against their staff on the basis of age, race, gender, or disability.
Unfair dismissal Employees of >1y standing (or on maternity, paternity,
or adoption leave) are entitled to a written statement of reasons for
dismissal. Employers must not dismiss an employee unfairly.

Practice management

GP premises
Funding of premises GPs may either own or rent the property in
which they practice:
• GPs who own surgeries GPs may own surgeries by themselves or in
partnership. They receive a payment (‘notional rent’) for allowing their
private buildings to be used for NHS purposes. Payment is based on
the current market rental (CMR) value of the property as assessed
by the district valuer. When a new GP partner joins a practiced he/
she may be expected to buy into the practice to contribute a share of
previous investment in the practice premises and equipment
• GPs who rent surgeries Can claim reimbursement from their PCO
for the rent they pay as long as it is ‘reasonable’ as assessed by the
district valuer
• Cost rent scheme This scheme is no longer available, but many
surgeries remain on it. Finance for building, refurbishment, or
modification of GP premises was originally raised by the partners. The
PCO reimburses the interest payments on the loans taken out to do this
• Improvement grants Available via PCOs in some circumstances

0 New premises/refurbishments must meet national minimum standards.

Disabled access The Equality Act (2010) gives disabled people rights

of access to goods, facilities, and services. A disabled person is defined as
‘someone who has a physical or mental impairment that has a substantial
and long-term adverse effect on his or her ability to carry out normal
day-to-day activities’. Practices must:
•	Not refuse to take disabled people onto a practice list or provide a
lower standard of service due to their disability
• Make reasonable adjustments to their premises and the way they
deliver their services so that disabled people can use them
Building regulations and access for disabled patients The building
regulations exist to ensure the health and safety of people in and around
all types of buildings. Part M deals with access/facilities for disabled people.
All new buildings/alterations to existing buildings must be accessible to
and useable by anyone, including those with disabilities.

Health and safety The basis of British health and safety law is the
Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. The Act sets out the general duties
employers have towards employees and members of the public, and
employees have to themselves and to each other.
Responsibilities of GPs as employers The Management of Health and
Safety at Work Regulations 1999 (the Management Regulations) give clear
guidance about employers’ duties towards their staff.
1.		Employers with ≥5 employees must carry out a risk assessment and
record the significant findings. HSE leaflet ‘5 Steps to Risk Assessment’
gives more information
2.		Make arrangements for implementing the health and safety measures
identified as necessary by the risk assessment
3.		Appoint competent people (usually the practice manager) to help
implement the arrangements

GP premises

4.		Set up emergency procedures (e.g. fire drills)
5.		Provide clear information and training to employees
6.		Work together with other employers sharing the same workplace
Other important pieces of health and safety legislation
• Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations 1969
Require employers to take out insurance against accidents and ill
health to their employees and display the insurance certificate
• Health and Safety Information for Employees Regulations 1989
Require employers to display a poster, telling employees what they
need to know about health and safety
• Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 Cover
a wide range of basic health, safety, and welfare issues, such as
ventilation, heating, lighting, and seating
• Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences
Regulations 1995 (RIDDOR) Require employers to notify certain
occupational injuries, diseases, and dangerous events
• Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992 Set
out requirements for work with visual display units (VDUs)
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Regulations 1992 Require
employers to provide appropriate protective clothing and equipment
• Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations (PUWER) 1998
Require that equipment provided, including machinery, is safe
• Manual Handling Operations Regulations 1992 Cover moving of
objects by hand or bodily force
• Health and Safety (First Aid) Regulations 1981 Cover requirements
for first aid
• Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002
(COSHH) Require employers to assess the risks from hazardous
substances and take appropriate precautions
• Gas Safety (Installation and Use) Regulations 1998 Cover safe
installation, maintenance and use of gas systems and appliances in
domestic and commercial premises

Computers and classification
Computers in practices Under the GMS Contract, PCOs directly
fund 100% of IT costs. PMS practices are similarly reimbursed.
Almost all practices now use computers on a daily basis. All specialist GP
systems must be approved by the DH (termed ‘Systems of Choice’—see
Table 3.1). The software covers all aspects of practice from appointment
systems, through clinical care, to audit and reporting.

Electronic GP records Most GPs maintain all records on computer,

i.e. they are ‘paperless’.

Read codes Code all aspects of patient care in general practice in the
UK. They code in a hierarchical way, e.g. all operations are quantified
by 7 . . . ; all appendix operations as 770; all emergency excisions of
abnormal appendix as 77001. Characters in the code can be numerical
or alphabetical. The huge number (585) of possible combinations ensures
there are enough unused Read codes to accommodate changes.
SNOMED Clinical terms (CT) New coding system that will
eventually replace Read coding. The aim is that all healthcare systems in the
UK will use the same coding system, allowing a single unified patient record.
Summary Care Record (SCR) Electronic summary of patient
medication list and drug allergies. Extracted from GP IT systems and can
be viewed by healthcare staff in other settings.
NHSnet Intranet connecting NHS organizations which are protected from
the Internet by a firewall. This enables NHS users to access the internet
but outside users cannot access protected NHSWeb sites. All GP practices
in the UK are connected to the NHSnet enabling e-mail, internet access,
electronic exchange of information (e.g. laboratory/X-ray results, discharge
summaries, out-patient clinic letters), shared information portals, and many
other benefits.

Computers and classification

Choose and book (C&B) National service that combines electronic

booking and choice of place, date and time for first outpatient
appointments. Features:
• A list of available services and indicative waiting list times for the first
outpatient appointment is displayed to the GP
• Appointments can be booked by the GP in the surgery (if the
secondary care provider is linked to the C&B system and there is
no PCO referrals management system in operation) or patients may
receive booking forms at home to book appointments themselves later
via the internet or by telephone. This ensures that appointments are
made at dates and times convenient for the patient
• Patients and/or clinicians can opt to use any appropriate service paid
for by the NHS, whether hospital or community based
• Patients may cancel or alter their appointments at a later date by the
same mechanism without going back to the GP
• Each referral is allocated a unique number (UBRN), enabling referral
letters to be submitted and retrieved electronically
• The ‘advice and guidance’ facility enables GPs to contact consultants
for advice via C&B

Use of e-mail in the GP surgery b p. 96
On-line patient access In England, all GPs must offer the facility
for on-line appointment booking by patients and on-line prescription
requests. Proposals to allow patients access to their own summary care
record are underway.
Electronic transmission of prescriptions Practices using this
service can generate and transmit electronic prescriptions. The electronic
prescription is transmitted to the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS).
Patients ‘nominate’ a dispenser to receive their prescriptions who
downloads the prescription to issue it. No paper prescription is required.
Care.data Under the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the Health and
Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) can extract personal confidential
data (PCD) about patients from GP practice IT systems for planning
services or secondary uses (e.g. commissioning, research). This can be
done without seeking patient consent. If patients wish to opt out they
must actively refuse; otherwise it is assumed that consent has been given.

Eligibility for free healthcare
Eligibility to receive free hospital care in the UK Is determined
by whether a person is resident in the UK and not related to nationality or
payment of National Insurance or taxes.
Patients from abroad
• Anyone coming to the UK intending to stay for <3mo does not fulfill
the qualifying criteria for free non-emergency NHS care
• For patients coming to the UK intending to stay for ‘settled purpose’,
entitlement to free treatment begins on arrival in the UK—there is no
qualifying period of residency before free treatment starts
British nationals returning to the UK
• A British resident on extended holiday or a business trip still counts as
ordinarily resident and is entitled to free healthcare on return
•	Someone who has emigrated, but returns from time to time to take
advantage of free NHS care, does not qualify; treat UK nationals
permanently resident abroad like any other overseas visitor (unless
embassy staff, merchant seamen, in the armed forces, or pensioners)
• Persons (with the exception of pensioners) leaving the UK for >3mo
should not continue to be registered with a GP; the onus is on patients
to inform the authorities and surrender their medical cards
• UK state pensioners who live in the UK for 6mo and the European
Economic Area for 6mo every year are entitled to free NHS care;
those who have lived in the UK for >10y continuously in the past who
return to the UK under any other circumstances are also entitled to
free treatment ‘the need for which arises during a visit to the UK’
UK residents going abroad
• Doctors should not provide NHS scripts for conditions that might arise
whilst the patient is away, e.g. traveller’s diarrhoea
• Prescribing interval for any repeat medication should be related to
the next time that medication would normally be reviewed. Generally,
this should not be >13wk; the prescribing doctor retains medicolegal
responsibility for the duration of the prescription
• If the doctor does decide to prescribe for the patient’s stay abroad
(e.g. if repeat supplies cannot be obtained at the destination or the
drug prescribed has a narrow therapeutic index), it is essential to
inform the patient of the need to consult a doctor for any regular
monitoring as well as the need to consult a doctor in the event of any
unforeseen complications or symptoms

General rules for treatment of overseas visitors to the UK
• Emergency or immediately necessary treatment (including
worsening of pre-existing conditions, oxygen, and renal dialysis) must
be offered to overseas visitors free of charge for a period of ≤14d.
There is no obligation to provide non-emergency treatment. It is the
decision of the GP whether care is deemed necessary
• Non-emergency care Provided on a private, paying basis

Eligibility for free healthcare

• Reciprocal healthcare arrangements and refugees (whether or not
awarded leave to stay) are regarded as ordinarily resident. Treat in the
same way as NHS patients
• Hospital admission A&E services are free as are compulsory
psychiatric treatment and treatment for certain communicable diseases
• NHS prescriptions can be issued to overseas residents, but quantities
supplied should be no more than necessary for immediate purposes;
overseas visitors are charged normal NHS prescription fees
0 GPs can register any patient as an NHS patient, but the patient may
not be eligible for specialist/hospital care. If registration is refused, the
practice must provide a non-discriminatory reason in writing (e.g. the
practice only registers patients residing in the area for settled purpose).

General rules for British patients travelling abroad <60
countries worldwide have any sort of healthcare agreements with the UK.
When travelling abroad, always have comprehensive medical insurance.
The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) The EHIC entitles holders
to reduced cost, or sometimes free, medical treatment that becomes
necessary whilst in another European Economic Area (EEA) country or
Switzerland. The EHIC can be obtained online from M www.ehic.org.uk
or at any Post Office. Countries this applies to are listed in Table 3.2. Each
country has its own rules—details for individual countries are available
on the DH travel advice website. British citizens moving to another EEA
country are not entitled to use an EHIC to obtain medical treatment.
Other reciprocal agreements The UK has reciprocal agreements with
certain other countries for the provision of urgently needed medical
treatment at d cost or free. Countries and the services available are
listed on the DH travel advice website. Only urgently needed treatment
is provided on the same terms as for residents of that country. Proof of
British nationality or UK residence is required.

Registration and practice leaflets
Registration process Patients can apply to join a practice list by
handing in their medical card at the practice or completing an application
form. For children, a parent or a guardian can make the application.
• Open lists Practices with open lists must consider all applications to
join their list They can only refuse if they have reasonable grounds for
doing so, which do not relate to the applicant’s race, gender, social
class, age, religion, sexual orientation, appearance, disability, or medical
condition. Reasonable grounds include living outside the practice area.
When an application is refused, the practice must inform the applicant
in writing of the reasons for refusal
• Closed lists Practices with closed lists can only consider applications
from immediate family members of patients already registered
Once the practice has accepted the application, it must then inform the
PCO. The PCO confirms the application has been accepted to the practice and patient.

List closure Practices wishing to close their lists to new registrations

must inform the PCO in writing. The PCO must then enter into discussion
with the practice to provide support to keep the list open. If that is not
possible, the list will be closed for a specified period of time. Often,
closure is requested due to high list size. In that instance, a list size can be
set so that the list re-opens when it falls below that limit.

Practice boundary b p. 5
Newly registered patients When a patient has been accepted onto

a practice list, or assigned to a practice list by a PCO, the practice must
offer the patient a consultation for a routine health check (the ‘new
patient check’) within 6mo of registration.

Routine health checks for other groups Practices must offer a
consultation for a routine health check to all:
• Patients aged 16–75y who have not been seen by a healthcare
professional within the practice in the past 3y
• Patients aged >75y who have not been seen by a healthcare
professional within the past year

0 In England, patients aged 40–74y are eligible for a free NHS health
check and personalized assessment of risk under a scheme launched in
2009. Mechanisms for delivery of the check vary across England, but GP
surgeries may provide checks as a Local Enhanced Service.

Temporary residents Patients may register with a practice on a
short-term basis for treatment or advice if they are living temporarily (for
>24h but <3mo) in the practice area.
Emergency and immediately necessary treatment A practice
must provide services required in core hours for the immediately
necessary treatment of:
• Anyone injured or acutely unwell as a result of an accident or medical
emergency at any place in its practice area

Registration and practice leaflets

• Anyone whose application for inclusion in the practice list (as a
permanent or temporary resident) has been refused and who is not
registered with another provider in the area
• Anyone who is in the practice area for <24h

Removing patients from the practice list b p. 56
Assignments PCOs may assign patients to any open practice list if the
patient has problems registering with a practice. PCOs can only assign
patients to closed lists if all other local practice lists are also closed and an
assessment panel has approved the placement.
Practice leaflets Each practice is required to produce a practice leaflet
to distribute to patients. In Wales, the practice leaflet must be in Welsh
and English. The practice leaflet aims to inform patients about the practice,
the services provided, and how to access them. In addition it informs
patients of their rights and responsibilities. Most practices also take the
opportunity to include general health information and information about
self-management of minor illness.
Content of the practice leaflet Practice leaflets must be updated annually
and include details of:
• The name of the practice (and if the contract is with a partnership,
names of partners and their status within the partnership; if the
contract is with a company, names of directors, company secretary,
shareholders, and the address of the company’s registered office)
•	Names and professional qualifications of those providing medical care
• Whether the practice teaches or trains healthcare professionals
• Practice area, including reference to a map, plan, or postcode
• Addresses of all practice premises, telephone and fax numbers, and
website address (if any)
•	Services available, including details of routine health checks for patients
aged >75y not seen in the past year or aged 16–75y and not seen in
the previous 3y
• Access for disabled patients and, if not, alternative arrangements for
providing them with services
• Registration process
• Opening hours and methods of accessing services (including home
visits) within those hours
• Out-of-hours arrangements (including who is responsible for their
provision) and how to access them
• Arrangements for dispensing drugs (if applicable) and repeat
prescriptions
•	Name and address of any local walk-in centre, telephone number of NHS
111 service (or equivalent) and details of online NHS health information
• Complaints procedure
• Rights and responsibilities, including the right of patients to express a
preference of practitioner (and the way that they can express that);
responsibility to keep appointments
• Action that will be taken if a patient is aggressive or abusive
• Access to patient information and the patient’s rights of confidentiality
•	Name, address, and telephone number of the responsible PCO

Practice management

The primary healthcare team
The GP does not function alone. Doctors within general practice are an
integral part of a team of professionals that care for patients in the community—the primary healthcare team (PHCT). Precise composition of
PHCTs depends on the overall aims of the team, needs of the practice
population, and practice characteristics. Team members include GPs and:

Practice manager General manager of the practice in liaison with

the partners. Roles include: staff appointments, supervision, training,
and dismissals; duty rotas; liaison with outside organizations (e.g. PCO)
and other primary healthcare team members (e.g. community nurses and
health visitors); maintenance of premises and equipment and financial
planning. Most practice managers have management qualifications.

Practice nurse Duties can vary but include ‘traditional’ nursing tasks;
health promotion; immunizations; new registration checks; specialist
clinics (e.g. asthma, DM, etc.); administration and audit.
Nurse practitioner Specially trained nurse who takes on clinical
responsibility for specific aspects of care she has been trained for either
within the GP surgery or in patients’ own homes, e.g. filtering out-of-hours
calls or managing heart failure. Seen as a way to alleviate pressure on GPs.
Nurse practitioners are at least as effective as GPs in the roles they perform.

District nurse Qualified nurse who has a community nursing
qualification recognized by the Nursing and Midwifery Council. Most work
is conducted in patients’ homes, particularly in looking after the chronically
ill or those recently discharged from hospital. District nurses are usually
employed by local community trusts or PCOs and coordinate their own
team of community nurses.
Community matron Highly experienced, senior nurse who works

closely with a limited number of patients who are high-intensity users of
health and social services (usually with serious, long-term conditions or
a complex range of conditions). The community matron acts as a ‘case
manager’ and single point of access to provide, plan, and organize care.

Health visitor Works with individuals, families, and groups in preventive

medicine, health promotion, and education. Health visitors visit all babies
after the midwife ceases to attend, carry out developmental assessment
checks, and advise on general care and immunization. Some health visitors
have a role exclusively for the elderly. Health visitors must be trained nurses
and registered as health visitors with the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Midwife Important link between hospitals, GPs, and other members of

the primary healthcare team in obstetric care. May practise independently
when dealing with uncomplicated pregnancies but are obliged to refer to
a doctor in the event of complications. Midwives must be registered with
the Nursing and Midwifery Council.

Administrative and clerical staff Perform all the non-clinical tasks
necessary to keep the practice running. Training varies.

The primary healthcare team

Receptionists Perform an essential role as the interface between the
general public and the GPs and nursing staff. Good interpersonal skills are
essential. Training varies.
Community pharmacist Increasing role within practices—managing

repeat prescribing, monitoring prescribing practices, and advising on
prescribing policy.

Social worker Helps people live more successfully within the local

community by helping them find solutions to their problems. Social
workers tend to specialize in either adult or children’s services:
• Adult services Roles include working with people with mental health
problems or learning difficulties in residential care; working with
offenders by supervising them in the community and supporting them
to find work; working with older people or disabled people at home,
helping to sort out problems with their health, housing, or benefits
• Children/young people services Roles include providing assistance
and advice to keep families together; working in children’s homes;
managing adoption and foster care processes; providing support to
younger people leaving care or who are at risk or in trouble with the
law; or helping children who have problems at school or are facing
difficulties brought on by illness in the family

Other team members Might include dieticians, occupational

therapists, physiotherapists, and/or complementary therapists (such as
psychological therapists).

Intermediate care Community-based service working closely with

the PHCT. Provided by multidisciplinary teams. Provision and team
composition varies across the UK but may include specialist doctors and/
or GPs, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists, home carers,
and social workers. Usually provided in patients’ own homes but can also
involve community hospitals and/or short-term nursing/residential care
placements. Common service features:
• Time-limited (usually <6wk)
• Targeted at people who would otherwise face prolonged hospital
stays or inappropriate admission to hospital
• Aims to maximize independence and enable people to remain living in
their own homes

Confidentiality
Respect for confidentiality is also an essential requirement for the preservation of trust between patient and doctor. Failure to comply with standards can lead to disciplinary proceedings and even restriction/cessation
of practice.

Caldicott Principles for disclosure of patient
information
• Justify the purpose Patients may agree to identifiable information
about themselves being released to specific individuals for known
purposes. Implied consent applies when patients are aware that personal
information may be shared and of their right to refuse but make no
objection. Patients must have a realistic opportunity to refuse—and if
they do refuse, clearly document that and respect their decision
• Do not use patient identifiable information unless it is absolutely
necessary It is not necessary to seek consent to use anonymous
information. If in doubt, seek advice from the BMA or your defence
organization. Health information used for secondary purposes, e.g.
planning, teaching, audit, should—when possible—be anonymous
• Use the minimum patient identifiable information
• Access to patient identifiable information should be on a strict
‘need to know basis’
• Everyone should be aware of their responsibilities
• Understand and comply with the law

Special circumstances
Children (<16y) Disclosure can be authorized by a person with
parental responsibility. Young people, mature enough to understand the
implications, can make their own decisions and have a right to refuse
parental access to their health record.
Mentally incapacitated adults Assessment of capacity to consent to
information disclosure is time- and decision-specific. A mentally incapacitated
adult can consent to information disclosure if the person is able to:
• Understand the concept of authorizing/prohibiting sharing of information
• Retain that information long enough to make a decision
• Weigh up the implications of disclosure or non-disclosure, and
• Communicate a decision
Otherwise, decisions must be based on an evaluation of the person’s best
interests, taking into account the views of the patient’s representative(s)
and reflecting the individual’s expressed wishes and values.
0 Except in Scotland, parents are able to consent for mentally incapacitated 16–17y olds.
The deceased Legislation covering records made since 1st November 1991
permits limited disclosure in order to satisfy a claim arising from death.
Where there is no claim, there is no legal right of access to information.

Confidentiality

Breaching confidentiality Only breach confidentiality in exceptional

cases and with appropriate justification. This includes discussing a patient
with another health professional not involved currently with that patient’s
care. Wider disclosure to people loosely associated with care (e.g. support
staff in residential care settings) requires patient consent.
Situations where breach of confidentiality may be justified
• Emergencies Where necessary, to prevent or lessen a serious and
imminent threat to the life or health of the individual concerned or
another person (unless previously forbidden by the patient)
• Statutory requirement Ask under which legislation it is sought—
check the legislation before disclosing if unsure
• The public interest What is in the public interest is not defined. The
BMA has produced guidance
• Public health Reporting notifiable diseases (statutory duty)
• Required by court or tribunal
• Adverse drug reactions Routine reporting to the Medicines and
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (b p. 146)
• Complaints As part of GMC performance procedures involving doctors

Legal considerations
• Human Rights Act (1998) Establishes a right to ‘respect for private
and family life’ and creates a general requirement to protect the
privacy of individuals and preserve confidentiality of their health
records. Compliance with the Data Protection Act and common law
of confidentiality should satisfy requirements
• Common law of confidentiality Built up from case law where practice
has been established by individual judgements. The key principle is that
information confided should not be used or disclosed further, except
as originally understood by the confider, or with their subsequent
permission, except in exceptional circumstances (see Breaching
confidentiality)
• Data Protection Act (1998) Imposes constraints on processing of
personal information. Also requires personal data to be protected
against unauthorized/unlawful processing and accidental loss,
destruction, or damage. Also applies to personnel records
• Administrative law The extent the NHS can access confidential
information to perform its functions is set down in statutes
• Health and Social Care Act (2001) Allows for certain exceptions to
confidentiality laws to be made, e.g. for use in cancer registries
• Freedom of information Act (2000) Applies to all NHS bodies,
including GP practices. Practices are required to produce a publication
scheme detailing all information routinely published by the practice. In
addition, members of the public can make written requests to see any
information recorded by the practice in any format. These rights are
restricted by certain exemptions, e.g. personal data

Consent
Consent Implies willingness of a patient to undergo examination,

investigation, or treatment (collectively termed ‘procedure’ on this page).
It may be expressed (i.e. specifically says yes or no/signs a consent form)
or implied (i.e. complies with the procedure without ever specifically
agreeing to it—use with care). For consent to be valid, patients:
• Must be competent to make the decision,
• Have received sufficient information to take it, and
•	Not be acting under duress
• Under ‘common law’, touching a patient without valid consent may
constitute the civil or criminal offence of battery, and if the patient suffers harm as a result of treatment, lack of consent may be a factor in any
negligence claim. Never exceed the scope of the authority given by a
patient, except in an emergency.

If you are the doctor carrying out a procedure, it is your responsibility to
discuss it with the patient and seek consent. The task may be delegated,
but the responsibility remains yours.

Information to include
• Reasons why you want to perform the procedure
•	Nature, purpose, and side effects (common and serious) of proposed
procedure
•	Name of the doctor with overall responsibility
• Whether students or other ‘trainees’ will be involved
• Whether part of a research programme or outside usual procedure
• Reminder that patients have a right to seek a 2nd opinion and/or can
change their minds about a decision at any time
And for therapeutic procedures/treatments
• Details of diagnosis and prognosis (including uncertainties)
• Management options—including the option not to treat and other
options that you cannot offer—and, for each option, an estimation of
likely risks, benefits, and probability of success
• Details of follow-up in order to monitor progress or side effects
0 Document if a patient does not want to be fully informed before
consenting.

Written consent It is good practice to seek written consent if:
• The procedure is complex or involves significant risks (‘risk’ means any
adverse outcome, including complications and side effects)
• The procedure involves general/regional anaesthesia or sedation
• Providing clinical care is not the primary purpose of the procedure
• It has consequences for employment, social, or personal life of the
patient
• The procedure is part of a project or programme of approved
research
Establishing capacity to make decisions b p. 122

Consent

Mentally incapacitated adults The Mental Capacity Act (2005), and
equivalents in Scotland and NI, enables patients’ advocates (usually friends,
relatives, or carers) or suitable professionals (e.g. doctors, social workers)
to act in patients’ best interests on their behalf. This includes provision of
medical care. Before acting:
• Take all factors affecting the decision into consideration
• Involve the patient with the decision making as far as possible
• Take the patient’s previous known wishes into consideration, and
• Consult everyone else involved with the patient’s care/welfare
In situations in which there is disagreement about the patient’s best interests, the decision can be referred to the Court of Protection.

Advance statements b p. 123
Children (<16y) A competent child is able to understand the nature,

purpose, and possible consequences of a proposed procedure as well as
the consequences of not undergoing that procedure. This is termed ‘Gillick
competence’ after the court case in which the principle was established
(Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech AHA [1986] AC 122).

A competent child may consent to treatment. However, if treatment is
refused, a parent or court may authorize procedures in the child’s best
interests*. Where a child is not judged competent, only a person with
parental responsibility may authorize/refuse investigations or treatment. If
in doubt, seek legal advice.

Emergencies When consent cannot be obtained, you may provide
medical treatment, provided it is limited to what is immediately
necessary to save life or avoid significant deterioration in the patient’s
health. Respect the terms of any advance statement/living will you are
aware of.

Practice management

Complaints
Sadly, complaints are a fact of life for most GPs (see Figure 3.1). The most
constructive and least stressful approach is to view them as a learning
experience and a chance to improve practice risk management strategy.
Always contact your local LMC ± defence organization if you are directly
implicated in a complaint. Patients who complain generally want:
• Their complaint to be heard and investigated promptly
• Their complaint to be handled efficiently and sympathetically
• To receive a genuine apology if mistakes have occurred
• To be assured that steps will be taken to prevent a recurrence

Time limits for complaints NHS complaints can only be accepted:
• <1y after the incident which is the subject of the complaint, or
• <1y after the date at which the complainant became aware of
the matter
After that time, complaints can only be accepted if there is good reason
for delay and it is possible to effectively investigate.
A 3y time limit after the incident (or after the date upon which the claimant became aware that the incident might have caused harm) is placed on
civil clinical negligence cases, except for children who may claim until their
21st birthday.

Conciliation Is a way of dealing with complaints that helps to avoid
adversarial situations. Either party can ask the local PCO for conciliation,
but both parties must agree to it taking place. By bringing the two sides
together with a neutral conciliator, it aims to:
• Explain and clarify matters for both parties
• Ensure both parties are really listening to each other
• Ensure the process is unthreatening and helpful
Records of complaints A file on the complaint, including a copy of
all correspondence, should be kept separate from clinical records of the
patient and, if the patient leaves the practice, should not be sent on with
the clinical notes.

Private sector Most private sector healthcare providers have their
own complaints resolution procedures. Patients should contact the
organization concerned for details.
Disciplinary procedures There is no direct connection between
complaints procedures and disciplinary action. If a complaints procedure
reveals information indicating the need for disciplinary action, it is the
responsibility of the PCO to act. If they decide there has been a breach of
the terms of service, the PCO can fix a penalty, if appropriate.

Practice management

Removal from the practice list
Removal of a patient from a practice list can be distressing for both patient
and GP. In England and Wales 753,000 patients/y are transferred by PCOs
at the request of the GP; 71,000/y because of an act or threat of violence.
0 Practice policies for removing patients and dealing with threats/violence should be stated in practice leaflets.

Situations that justify removal
• Violence Physical violence or verbal abuse towards doctors, practice
staff, premises, or other patients. Includes violence or threatening
behaviour by other household members not registered with the
practice and/or pets (e.g. dogs)
• Crime and deception Deliberate deceit to obtain a service or benefit;
obtaining drugs under false pretences for non-medical reasons; use of
the doctor to conceal or aid criminal activity; stealing from practice
premises
• Distance New residence outside the designated outer boundary of the
practice area, with failure to register with another GP

Situations that never justify removal
• Costly treatment GPs can apply for an i in their prescribing budget
to allow for this
• Particular conditions If a particular condition demands costly
treatment, out-of-area referrals, or expensive equipment,
accommodation can be made at PCO level
• Age General practice is about looking after patients from cradle to
grave. Although patients >75y do result in higher costs, this is reflected
in allocation of funds to the practice

Situations that do not normally justify removal
• Disagreement with the patient’s views Patients must have freedom
to choose whether to accept a GP’s advice. The GP can try to
influence the view but should not remove a patient if he or she fails
to concur
• Critical questioning and/or complaints Complaints to the practice
via normal in-house channels can be constructive and help improve
services; they do not usually justify removal of the patient from the
practice list. However, personal attacks on a doctor or allegations that
are clearly unfounded indicate a serious breakdown in doctor–patient
relationship and could justify removal

Patients’ rights to change doctor Patients also have a right to
change their doctor. They are not required to give reasons or any period
of notice, and there is no requirement for the GP to be notified.
Other family members Removal of other family members should
not automatically follow removal of a patient from a practice list unless
removal of that patient makes ongoing care of the rest of the household
impossible.

Removal from the practice list

Irretrievable breakdown of the doctor–patient relationship

The most contentious reason for removal from a practice list. Causes the
most problems. As a good doctor–patient relationship is fundamental to
successful care, it is in the interest of both patient and GP that the patient
moves to another practice list if that relationship breaks down. Difficulty
arises when the patient sees matters differently.
• Inform appropriate members of the practice Discuss reasons for
breakdown in relationship (e.g. chronic stress, mental illness, cultural
differences) and factors that contribute to the situation; consider
solutions/alterations in procedures that might help
• Inform the patient Consider arranging a meeting to discuss matters
(can be done through the in-house complaints framework). Explain the
nature of the problem and elicit the patient’s perspective; be prepared
to give ground and compromise
• If discussion fails to resolve the problem Suggest the patient sees
another GP within the practice (although discuss the patient’s feelings
about the possibility of being treated by the ex-GP in an emergency).
Consider giving advice about alternative practices in the area. If the
situation continues, then consider removal from the practice list

Removing patients from the practice list
• Warn the patient A practice can only request removal of a patient from
a practice list if, within 12mo prior to the date of its request to the PCO
for removal, it has warned the patient that he/she is at risk of removal
and explained the reasons for that. Exceptions to this are violent
patients, patients who have moved outside the practice area, and those
for whom it would be unsafe or impractical to issue a warning
• Inform the PCO in writing of your decision. Give full patient details.
Except in the case of violent patients, removal will not take effect until
the 8th day after the request is received by the PCO unless the patient
is accepted by, allocated, or assigned to another GP sooner than this.
The patient is always notified by the PCO
• Write to the patient about the decision and reason for removal (take
advice from your medical defence organization, if needed). Include
information on how to register with another practice and reassurance
that the patient will not be left without a GP. Take care to ensure
reasons given are factual and the tone of the letter is polite and
informative

Immediate removal of any patient who has committed an act
of violence Includes actual or threatened physical violence or verbal
abuse leading to fear for a person’s safety.
•	Notify the police (or, in Scotland, either the police or the procurator
fiscal) about the violent behaviour
•	Notify both the PCO and the patient of the removal in writing. The
PCO has a duty to provide alternative primary medical care services
by commissioning specialized directed enhanced services, e.g. GPs with
secure facilities for consulting

Education, monitoring, and research

Education in primary care
Teaching and training in primary care at every level should:
• Be based on evidence
•	Train the doctor to be part of an integrated and comprehensive
healthcare system
•	Have a balanced agenda across clinical topics (prevention, diagnosis,
cure, care, and palliation), practice organization and management, team
working, audit, and research

Teaching in general practice Most GPs are involved in teaching to
some extent. This may involve:
•	Teaching medical students, foundation doctors, or GP registrars within
the practice
•	Helping to train new practice staff
• Arranging your own and/or your colleagues’ continuing education
programme
Teaching can be very rewarding but also brings stresses (e.g. preparation
of material). Payments are available to GPs who take medical students,
foundation doctors, and/or GPs in training into their surgeries for teaching,
and there are a few teaching posts within UK universities for GPs.
As a teacher, it is your responsibility to ensure you are competent to fulfil
the task. Take steps to acquire proficiency in teaching skills. Local medical
schools often run courses for prospective teachers.

Learning styles Different people have different learning styles.
Depending on a person’s preferred learning style, the starting point for an
educational initiative will be different:
• ‘Why’ (concrete, reflective) Learners learn best when they know why
something is relevant and how it will apply to their work
• ‘What’ (abstract, reflective) Learners learn best when given plenty of
time to think about things and link different concepts in their mind
• ‘How’ (abstract, active) Learners like to work actively on well-defined
tasks and learn by trial and error
• ‘What if’ (concrete, active) Learners learn best by applying course material
in new situations and solving problems they create for themselves
• Serialist Learners like to see the ‘big picture’ first
• Holist learners Like to take learning bit by bit in small chunks
• Individual learners Prefer to learn on their own
• Group learners Prefer to learn with others
Principles of self-directed and adult learning The learner

takes responsibility for defining learning needs; setting goals; identifying
resources; implementing appropriate activities; and evaluating outcomes.
Adults are motivated by education that:
• Is based on mutual trust and respect
• Allows them to take responsibility for their own learning
• Actively involves them
• Is perceived as relevant
• Is based on, and builds on, previous experience

Education in primary care

• Is focused on problems
• Can be immediately applied in practice
• Involves cycles of action and reflection

Personal development plans (PDPs) Outline areas of knowledge in
need of update and ways in which these needs can be met. PDPs are an integral
part of junior doctor training, GP training, and the appraisal process. Ask:
• What you need to learn—specific, measurable objectives
• Why you need to learn it
• How you plan to learn it
• How you will know whether you have learnt it
•	How your intentions link to past and future learning
•	The timescale for your learning
‘SMART’ criteria—learning objectives should be:
Specific
Measurable
Achievable
Realistic
Timed (i.e. there should be a deadline for achieving them)

Methods of identifying learning needs Numerous—include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Gap analysis
Significant event analysis (b p. 81)
Objective tests of knowledge and skill
Self-assessment through diary, log book, or weekly review
Video assessment of performance
Criterion-based audit (b p. 80)
Patient satisfaction surveys (b p. 84)
Risk assessment (b p. 35)
Peer assessment/multisource feedback

Medical students Are taught in general practice as:

• Early patient contact is helpful to enable students to relate theoretical
concepts to the reality of medical practice. General practice settings
are especially good for teaching concepts of health and illness
behaviour and the effect of family and social settings on illness
• Clinical skills can be taught successfully in general practice, and the
one-to-one teaching that can be undertaken within GP surgeries is an
excellent teaching resource

Foundation doctors b p. 62
GP training b p. 64
Continuing professional development (CPD) The aim of CPD is
to sustain professional development of doctors and help them to provide
high-quality patient care throughout their careers. Doctors need to
demonstrate that they have up-to-date knowledge across the spectrum
of general practice to become a registered GP and then need to show
they are continuing to update and expand their knowledge to meet the
requirements of appraisal and revalidation (b p. 68).

chapter 4

Education, monitoring, and research

Foundation doctors in primary care
Newly qualified doctors spend their first working year (F1) doing three
hospital placements before obtaining full registration. In the second year
(F2), 42% have a 4mo attachment to primary care.
Who employs foundation doctors? Foundation programmes are
hosted by acute hospital trusts. The trust recruits the doctors, arranges
placements, employs them through their 2y programme, provides indemnity,
appoints educational supervisors, and is responsible for assessment.

F2 placements in general practice

• Made by employing trusts; practices have no say about who they take
• Educational deaneries are responsible for appointing practices for F2
placements, and interested practices should contact their local deanery
• Practices must be of adequate standard and have an approved
supervisor for their F2s; the standard required of the practice is
similar to that required of training practices (b p. 65)—practices are
inspected by their deanery to check that they meet the criteria
• GP F2 supervisors need not be GP trainers. To attain approval,
potential supervisors undergo a short training course organized by the
deanery; they are paid at a rate related to the trainer rate
Expectations of F2 doctors F2 doctors:
• Are expected to do 7 clinical sessions/wk, 1 session of supervised
study, 1 session of project work, and attend a half day group session
at their host trust. No OOH work is expected. Part-time working is
allowed, but training must be undertaken on a ≥½-time basis
• Are entitled to study leave (up to 1wk) and annual leave
• Can sign prescriptions; practical procedures must be supervised
•	Need an initial induction period, working with practice staff and the
wider primary healthcare team and sitting in with a trained GP
• Are likely to need longer consultation times than standard 10min slots
•	Need to have a fully trained GP available whenever they are seeing
patients to provide advice and support, monitor their performance,
and debrief at the end of the session
ePortfolio Compulsory record of training. The doctor must prove that
he/she has attained all the competences required (see Box 4.1) before
progression to specialist training. Includes:
• Core procedures
•	Team assessment of
• Clinical supervisor-end-of
behaviour (TAB)
placement report
• Educational supervisor
• Placement supervision group report
end-of-year report
Supervised learning events (SLE) Three types are commonly used:
• Direct observation of doctor/patient encounters An experienced
colleague watches the F2. Tools available: direct observation of
procedural skills (DOPS)—for practice procedures; mini clinical
evaluation exercise (Mini-CEX)—for clinical consultations
• Case-based discussion (CBD) Structured case review with a senior clinician
• Developing the clinical teacher

Becoming a GP in the UK
GP vocational training in 2014 Involves 3y full-time (or the
equivalent part-time) specialty training after the Foundation years: 18mo
in selected hospital specialty posts and 18mo as a GP registrar in general
practice under the supervision of a GP trainer.
Broad-based training (BBT) In place of the usual first year of specialist
training (ST1), a 2y BBT scheme is currently being piloted in 7 deaneries.
Junior doctors do 6mo of each of paediatrics, general medicine, general
practice, and mental health before going into the ST2 year of their chosen
specialty.

GP training in the future Approval was gained in 2012 to enhance/
extend GP training to better prepare future GPs for independent practice.
If implemented as planned, the new 4y programme will focus on:
• Enhancing clinical skills
• Enhancing generalist skills
• Enhancing leadership skills
The vision includes
• Experience of working in general practice early in training
• Spending ≥24mo in primary care to learn how to manage complex
patients with multiple morbidities
• Specialist-led training in child and mental health
• More scope to tailor training to individual trainee needs
• More innovative and integrated placements in a range of settings
• A ‘Quality Improvement Project’ in the local community
Distribution of training Enhanced GP training will include:
• 12mo in relevant specialist posts approved by the GMC
• 12mo used flexibly by deaneries to create GP training placements in a
range of hospital, community, and general practice settings
• 24mo in general practice placements

Recruitment and selection Applications for GP training must be
made online to the National Recruitment Office for General Practice
Training (NRO):
• All applicants meeting GP training entry criteria are invited to attend a
national shortlisting assessment consisting of a machine-markable test
• Candidates are sorted in rank order; highest scoring applicants are
invited to attend a selection centre at their highest preferred location.
Selections centres in England are the regional deaneries. Scotland,
Wales, and NI each have a single selection centre
•	The selection centre assessment comprises 3 workplace-based
assessments, which include a patient simulation exercise. Following
assessment, highest ranked applicants are offered training places in
that area
• Appointable candidates without training places are placed on a reserve
list for the deanery. Any reserve candidates not offered local places
are entered into national clearing

Becoming a GP in the UK

Criteria for training practices Each region sets its own criteria for

selection of practices to train prospective GPs. These relate to:
•	The trainer as a doctor
•	The trainer as a teacher, and
•	The training practice
Practices must demonstrate high-quality clinical care and administration,
and a commitment and capability to educate a GP registrar. Details of local
requirements can be obtained from regional deanery offices.

The RCGP Certification Unit evaluates general practice training
and makes recommendations for Certificates of Completion of Training
(CCT) to the GMC. Anyone undertaking a training programme, leading to
a CCT, should register with the Certification Unit.

Certification of Completion of Training
• During training, on completion of each placement, the clinical
supervisor completes an assessment of the trainee’s performance
•	The GP educational supervisor signs this assessment off as
confirmation that there has been satisfactory progress in acquiring the
relevant curriculum competences
•	The portfolio of assessments is reviewed and endorsed by the
deanery, at least annually (Annual Panel Review)
• Submission of this portfolio, together with successful completion of
the MRCGP, enables a GP in training to apply for the CCT via the
RCGP Certification Unit

Certification of Eligibility for GP Registration (CEGPR)

CEGPR (previously called Article 11) is an alternative route for doctors
who are not eligible for a CCT but believe that their training, qualifications,
and experience are equivalent (e.g. all, or part, of their training outside the
UK or in a non-approved training post). Trainees who begin a 3y planned
programme for a CCT and decide to shorten it, by including posts not in
their GP programme, must also apply for a CEGPR. This type of application
is more complex and time-consuming than the CCT route. Application is
online to the GMC, with submission of a portfolio of evidence.

Education, monitoring, and research

Membership of the Royal College of GPs
Membership of the RCGP (MRCGP) The MRCGP is an examination
of professional competency based on modern educational theory and an
evidence-based approach to assessment designed to test GPs in training
across the spectrum of knowledge, skills, behaviours, and attitudes defined
by the RCGP Curriculum (see Figure 4.1).
Passing the 3 different components of the MRCGP is compulsory for all
doctors wishing to become GPs in the UK:
Applied Knowledge Test (AKT) 200 multiple-choice questions test
whether the candidate can apply knowledge in the context of general
practice. Computer-based assessment held at Pearson VUE computer
centres across the country. Questions are distributed as follows: clinical
medicine (80%); administration and informatics (10%); research, appraisal,
evidence-based medicine, and statistics (10%).
Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) Assesses behaviour in a mock surgery
in which patients are played by actors. The candidate performs 13
consultations, each of 10min duration. The CSA is currently only available
at the RCGP in Euston and takes place 3 times a year in February, May,
and November.
Workplace-Based Assessment (WPBA) Continuous qualitative assessment
of performance in training based on the ePortfolio and trainer’s report.
The evidence collected in the Trainee ePortfolio is reviewed at least
1×/12mo by the deanery Annual Review of Competence Progression
(ARCP) panel to ensure the trainee is ready to move into the next year
of training.

First5® On gaining their CCT, newly qualified GPs can receive additional
support through the RCGP to the first point of revalidation at 5y through
the RCGP First5® programme.
Fellowship of the RCGP Is awarded in recognition of a significant

contribution to medicine in general, and general practice in particular.
It recognizes a significant contribution to: the health and welfare of the
community; the science or practice of medicine; the aims of RCGP; or any
organization which benefits general practice. The candidate (nominee),
nominator, and two seconders must each complete a form and a
supporting statement. The achievement categories are:
•	Teaching and education
• Clinical practice
• Innovation and creativity
• Patient-centred practice
• Academic and research
• Leadership

The nominator emails the completed paperwork to the candidate’s local
RCGP Faculty for consideration by the Faculty’s fellowship committee
which considers the application, then makes a recommendation to RCGP
Council. Approved candidates are formally elected as Fellows at the
RCGP Annual General Meeting or Spring Meeting.

Appraisal and revalidation
Appraisal Requires all doctors wishing to practise medicine in the UK to
undergo a formal review on a yearly basis. It is the basis of revalidation to
maintain a licence to practise and aims to:
• Set out personal and professional development needs, career paths
and goals, and agree plans for them to be met
• Review the doctor’s performance, and consider the doctor’s
contribution to quality and improvement of local healthcare services
• Optimize the use of skills and resources in achieving the delivery of
high-quality care
• Offer an opportunity for doctors to discuss and seek support for their
participation in activities
• Identify the need for adequate resources to enable service objectives
to be met
Supporting information The supporting information that doctors need to
bring for the appraisal falls under 4 broad headings:
• General information—provides context on all aspects of work
• Keeping up to date—maintaining/enhancing quality of work
• Review of practice—evaluating quality of current practice
• Feedback on practice—how others perceive your work
Based on the GMC’s document Good Medical Practice, there are 6 types
of supporting information GPs are expected to provide and discuss at the
appraisal at least once in each 5y cycle. They are:
• Significant events
• Continuing professional development
• Feedback from colleagues
• Quality improvement activity
• Feedback from patients
• Review of complaints/compliments
The appraiser Responsible officers of the designated bodies are accountable
for ensuring appraisal takes place, that appraisers are properly trained to
carry out this role and are in a position to undertake appraisal of a doctor’s
whole practice, including clinical performance, and where appropriate,
specialist aspects of performance, e.g. research, service delivery, or
management issues. In general, appraisers for GPs will be other GPs.
The appraisal process
• Before the interview Doctors must prepare an appraisal document
containing information and supporting evidence about their practice
and personal needs. Folders should be submitted to the appraiser
≥2wk prior to appraisal interviews to allow adequate time for
preparation. Various electronic toolkits and portfolios are available
• At the interview Doctor and appraiser agree a summary of
achievement in the past year, objectives for the next year, key
elements of a personal development plan, and actions expected of the
organization
• After the interview A summary document is produced (usually by
the doctor being appraised) and a joint declaration signed that the
appraisal has been carried out properly

Appraisal and revalidation

Licence to Practise The GMC introduced licences to practise in
November 2009. All registered doctors were able to request a licence
to practise; all doctors eligible for registration with the GMC since
November 2009 have also been licensed. The GMC licence (rather than
GMC registration) signifies to patients that a doctor has the legal authority
to write prescriptions and sign death certificates. GPs working in the NHS,
either on a permanent or locum basis, need to be:
• Licensed by the GMC
• Listed on the GMC’s General Practice Register
• Included on an NHS Performers List
Revalidation Was formally introduced in December 2012. All licensed
doctors need to be relicensed every 5y.
Process of revalidation Doctors need to provide supporting information
that shows that they keep up to date and remain fit to practise. GPs are
accountable to their local ‘designated body’ and ‘responsible officer’. In
order for Responsible Officers to recommend maintenance of a GP’s
Licence to Practise, they need to be satisfied that:
•	The GP has participated in an annual appraisal process that covers all
of their medical practice, and
•	There are no unresolved concerns about the doctor’s performance
Responsible officer’s recommendations to the GMC
• Positive recommendation The doctor should be revalidated and his/
her Licence to Practise continued
• Deferral: insufficient information Revalidation cannot be
recommended because the doctor has not provided enough
information; the doctor will be asked to provide additional information
• Notification of failure to engage The doctor has failed to engage with
local systems and processes that support revalidation
The GMC will withdraw a Licence to Practise if:
•	The doctor tells them that it is no longer required
•	The doctor does not pay the appropriate fee
•	The doctor does not take part in the revalidation process when asked
• A Fitness to Practise panel directs that the doctor’s registration should
be suspended or erased
0 Doctors have a right of appeal against any decision to withdraw, or
refuse to restore, their Licence to Practise or Specialist Certificate.

• Concerns about performance Any GP with concerns about

their own, or a colleague’s, performance should discuss the matter
confidentially with the secretary of their LMC, the clinical governance
lead/performance information manager of their PCO, or the GMC.

Career options for GPs
Times are changing in general practice. Doctors considering a life as a GP
want a more flexible and varied career than in the past.

Career options within the NHS
Clinical assistant or hospital practitioner The GP works within a hospital
setting on the wards or in outpatients, providing a specialist service
under direct supervision of a hospital consultant. Posts are usually
advertised in the medical/GP press ± locally. Generally poorly paid.
GP with special clinical interest (GPwSI) GPs who, in addition to their
normal GP duties, provide a specialist service to meet the needs of their
local community. They might deliver a specialist clinical service beyond
the scope of normal general practice, undertake advanced procedures,
or develop services. The main difference between a GPwSI and clinical
assistant is that the GPwSI receives referrals from other GPs and will
decide on the appropriate treatment independently and not under direct
supervision of a consultant, but with the support of secondary care.
Posts are usually advertised to local GPs. In order to be classed as having
a special interest, GPs must:
•	Have undertaken particular training in the specialty or have a proven
track record of expertise in the specialty
• Regularly update knowledge through attendance at courses,
conferences, or meetings and through reading
• Look after a specific group of patients with the condition
• Audit practice in the specialty area, demonstrating quality of care
Medical adviser or consultant in primary care Medical advisers or
directors in ambulance trusts, NHS Direct sites, etc. Some national NHS
agencies have GP advisers or directors too, e.g. National Commissioning
Board. Posts are either advertised or obtained by direct approach.
Providing GMS/PMS ± enhanced medical services b p. 4
Providing postgraduate medical education e.g. GP tutor, GP trainer (1 in
8 GPs are GP trainers), course organizer. Approach local director or dean
of postgraduate medical education.
Working for local PCO/CCG/Deanery e.g. serving on a committee, clinical
tutor, GP appraiser, etc. Contact local PCO.

Opportunities outside the NHS
Academic posts A GP may be employed solely by a university or jointly by
a university and the NHS. Posts include undergraduate teachers, lecturers,
and research posts. Contact local university departments of general
practice or look for posts advertised in the medical/GP press.
Clinical sessions for commercial companies and charities, e.g. school
doctor for a private school.

Career options for GPs

Complementary medicine Seek specialist training. Contact representative
bodies of the specialty chosen.
Forensic work, e.g. police surgeon, coroner (F 020 8979 6805), expert
witness (M www.ewi.org.uk).
Media work/medical author Some sort of professional journalism
qualification is useful. The BMJ offers a 1y registrar post for doctors with
3–5y experience. Courses are also available through the BMA and Medical
Journalists Association M www.mja-uk.org. If you have an idea for a book,
contact the medical commissioning editor of a reputable publisher to
discuss your ideas.
Medical adviser posts within GP and other medical organizations, e.g.
RCGP, MDU, GMC. Posts may be advertised or appointments made
through election or direct approach. Contact the relevant organization.
Medicals for benefits Examining Medical Practitioners (EMPs) carrying out
fitness to work and disability assessments on behalf of the Department for
Work and Pensions (DWP).
Medical politics GPs serve on local medical committees (LMCs) on an
elected basis. Contact the local LMC and ask about standing for election.
Work for government agencies, e.g. armed forces as a civilian medical
practitioner or the territorial army. Usually civilian posts are advertised
in the medical/GP press. For commissioned posts, contact service
recruitment offices.
Occupational medicine Contact: Faculty for Occupational Medicine
M www.facoccmed.ac.uk
Prison doctor Posts are usually advertised in the medical/GP press.
Sports medicine, e.g. for professional sportsmen; in private clinics. Doctors
are required to have a knowledge of sports injuries, their treatment,
rehabilitation, and prevention. They also need to know about other
aspects of sport, e.g. drugs in sport, nutrition, travel problems. Contact:
British Association of Sport and Exercise Medicine M www.basem.co.uk
Work abroad Contact: RCGP International Department E-mail:
international@rcgp.org.uk; RedR UK M www.redr.org.uk; Voluntary
Service Overseas M www.vso.org.uk. Overseas posts are also advertised
in the medical press.

Clinical governance and CQC
Clinical governance is defined as ‘a framework through which organizations
are accountable for continuously improving the quality of their services and
safeguarding high standards of care by creating an environment in which
excellence in clinical care will flourish.’

Essential elements of clinical governance See Figure 4.2
What does clinical governance entail?

• Within practices, individual doctors must consider their own
professional development and educational needs, and regular
assessment must be made of performance and development of other
health professionals engaged by practices
• Within practices, there must be continuous review and appraisal of
procedures and standards—RAID:
- Review—gather all stakeholders together to look at a topic
- Agree—strategy to take forward
- Intervene—make changes decided upon
- Demonstrate—the effect of changes through audit (b p. 80),
patient satisfaction questionnaires, prescribing data, etc.
• Deficiencies in knowledge, skills, or experience must be acted upon
through appropriate education and professional development
• Resources should be provided to help develop clinical governance, e.g.
time out for audit, funding for courses and educational activities

Concerns about GP performance b p. 69
Care Quality Commission (CQC) The Health and Social Care
Act 2008 required any individual, partnership, or organization providing
healthcare services in the UK to register with the CQC as a service provider.
Registration had to be completed by April 2013 for general practice.
Regulated activities Practices must register for any of the ‘regulated
activities’ that they perform. The CQC lists 15 different regulated activities.
Those usually applicable to general practice are:
•	Treatment of disease, disorder or injury—all practices
• Diagnostic and screening procedures—all practices
• Surgical procedures—minor surgery (does not include cryotherapy or
nail surgery)
• Maternity and midwifery services—ante- or postnatal care
• Family planning services—only practices that insert IUDs
Essential standards There are currently 28 essential standards although
this may change in the near future. Practices must provide evidence that
they meet 16 to be registered with CQC (the remaining 12 relate to
ongoing provision of the service):
• Outcome 1: Respecting and involving people who use services
• Outcome 2: Consent to care and treatment
• Outcome 4: Care and welfare of people who use services
• Outcome 5: Meeting nutritional needs
• Outcome 6: Cooperating with other providers
• Outcome 7: Safeguarding people who use services from abuse

Outcome 8: Cleanliness and infection control
Outcome 9: Management of medicines
Outcome 10: Safety and suitability of premises
Outcome 11: Safety, availability, and suitability of equipment
Outcome 12: Requirements relating to workers—staff properly
qualified and able to do their jobs
Outcome 13: Staffing—enough staff to provide the service
Outcome 14: Supporting workers—proper training and supervision,
chances to develop/improve skills
Outcome 16: Assessing and monitoring the quality of service
provision—quality checking systems to manage risks
Outcome 17: Complaints
Outcome 21: Records—accuracy, safe keeping, and confidentiality

0 If practices do not comply, they may still be registered but must ensure
that they take steps to manage any risks posed by non-compliance and
must submit an action plan to explain the steps that will be taken to meet
compliance with a target date for achievement.
Monitoring After registration, the CQC inspects practices on a regular
basis to ensure that they continue to meet essential standards.

Evidence-based medicine
Definition Conscientious, explicit, and judicious use of current best
evidence in making decisions about the care of individual patients.
The 5 steps of evidence-based medicine (EBM) are
1. Convert clinical information needs into answerable questions
2.	Track down the best evidence with which to answer them (see
Table 4.2 for useful web resources)
3. Critically appraise that evidence for its validity and usefulness
(Table 4.1 explains grading of evidence)
4. Apply the results of this appraisal in clinical practice
5. Evaluate your clinical performance e.g. through audit (b p. 80)
Practising EBM involves integrating individual clinical expertise with
the best available external clinical evidence from systematic research.
The problem for the clinician on the ground is finding and interpreting the
appropriate evidence for the clinical situation. If good-quality evidence is
out there (and there are many under-researched areas in medicine)—how
do you access it? When do you find the time to search for it? How do you
assess its quality and relevance?

Critical appraisal The process of assessing and interpreting evidence
by systematically considering its validity, results, and relevance. Essential
to avoid misinterpretation and misuse of evidence in practice. In all cases,
before integrating evidence into practice, consider:
• Are the results of the study valid?
• What are the results?
• Will they help me in caring for my patients?
Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) appraisal tools are available

Bias.pdf

Case–control study Involves identifying patients who have the outcome
of interest (cases) and control patients without the same outcome, and
looking back to see if they had the exposure of interest.
Cohort study Involves identification of two groups (cohorts) of
patients: one that received the exposure of interest, and one that did not,
and following these cohorts forward for the outcome of interest.
Confidence interval (CI) Quantifies uncertainty in measurement.
Usually reported as 95% CI, which is the range of values within which it
can be 95% sure that the true value for the whole population lies.
Control event rate (CER) The rate at which events occur in
a control group. It may be represented by a percentage (e.g. 10%) or
proportion (e.g. 0.1).

Number needed to treat (NNT) A measure of the difference

between active treatment and control treatment. An NNT of 1 describes a
situation where an event occurs in every patient given the active treatment
but no patient in the comparison group. There are few circumstances in
which a treatment is 100% effective and placebo completely ineffective, so
NNTs of 2–3 indicate an effective intervention.
Calculating NNT
A = Number who had successful outcome with the intervention
÷ total number who had the intervention
B = Number who had successful outcome with control ÷ total
number who had the control
NNT = 1

Number needed to harm (NNH) Compares the number having a

side effect in the intervention group against the number having that side
effect in the comparison group. If no one in the control group and no one
in the comparison group has an unwanted effect the NNH will be infinity.
Therefore, the NNH should be as large as possible.

Odds ratio (OR) Odds of an event are calculated as the number of
events divided by the number of non-events. The odds ratio is the ratio of
the odds in the experimental group compared to the control group. For
epidemiological studies looking for factors causing harm, an odds ratio >1
indicates the factor the experimental group was exposed to caused harm.
For experimental studies looking for a decrease in events through treatment,
an odds ratio <1 indicates a positive result. Often expressed as a percentage.
Positive predictive value b p. 171
Relative risk or risk ratio (RR) Ratio of risk in the treated group

(EER) to risk in the control group (CER). RR = ERR/CER. It is used in
randomized trials and cohort studies. If the RR = 1, there is no difference
between the two groups for that measure.

Relative risk reduction (RRR) Difference between the EER and CER
(EER – CER) divided by the CER. Usually expressed as a percentage.

Sensitivity b p. 171
Specificity b p. 171

Clinical guidelines, protocols, and
integrated care pathways
Clinical guidelines Defined as ‘user-friendly statements that bring
together the best external evidence and other knowledge necessary for
decision making about a specific health problem’. Over recent years, there
has been a dramatic i in publication of guidelines and protocols. They aim
to d harmful or expensive variations in clinical practice, improve health
care outcomes, and encourage rapid dissemination of useful innovations.
Good clinical guidelines have 3 properties—they:
• Define practice questions and identify all their decision options and
outcomes
• Identify, appraise, and summarize best evidence about prevention,
diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, harm, and cost effectiveness
• Identify the decision points at which the evidence needs to be
integrated with individual clinical experience and clinical circumstances
in deciding a course of action
Advantages and disadvantages of guidelines
Advantages
• Provide guidance for busy clinicians—a consistent basis for
decision-making
• Practical framework for common problems and chronic disease
• Summaries the available research evidence
• Can be used as a basis for continuing medical education
• Justification for expenditure—can aid cost-effective use of limited
resources
• Facilitate the audit cycle
Disadvantages
• Poor-quality guidelines can reinforce poor practice
• Lack of relevance of the guidelines to the clinical setting—much of
the ‘evidence’ used to develop guidelines comes from secondary
care and may not reflect the situation in primary care
•	Tendency to uniformity—can stifle innovation
• Resistance to change—new methods may not be considered until a
new guideline is produced
• Increased risk of litigation
• Cost—guidelines are time-consuming to develop and update
• Lack of ownership—guidelines developed by others may not feel
relevant
• Difficulties in implementation—guidelines that are not user-friendly
and well disseminated will not be used

Clinical guidelines, protocols, and ICP

Before starting to use a guideline Always ask:
‘Is this guideline valid, important, and applicable in my practice?’
If the answer is yes, then consider
• What barriers exist to implementation?
• Can they be overcome?
• Can you enlist collaboration of key colleagues?
• Can you meet the educational and administrative conditions that are
likely to determine the success or failure of implementing the strategy?

Protocol Is the term reserved for guidelines at the more rigid end of
the spectrum. These are very specific guidelines which are expected to
be followed in detail, with little scope for variation, e.g. resuscitation
protocols.
Integrated care pathway (ICP) ICPs amalgamate all the anticipated

elements of care and treatment of the multidisciplinary team for a
particular patient group in order to achieve agreed outcomes. Any
deviation from the plan is documented as variance—the analysis of which
provides information for the review of current practice. ICPs aim to:
• Facilitate introduction of guidelines and systemic audit into clinical
practice
• Improve multidisciplinary communication and care planning
• Reach or exceed existing standards
• Decrease unwanted practice variation
• Improve clinician–patient communication and patient satisfaction
• Identify research and development questions
• Cross the interface between primary, secondary, and social care

Audit
Audit is defined as the systematic critical analysis of quality of health care.
Its purpose is to appraise current practice (What is happening?) by measuring it against preselected standards (What should be happening?) to identify
and implement areas for change (What changes are needed?) and thus
improve performance.
Audit differs from research, as research aims to establish what best practice is globally; audit aims to discover how close practice is to best practice
on a local level and identify ways of improving care. Audit is a continual
process and an integral part of clinical governance (b p. 72). All practices
in the UK are involved in audit in some way.

Criterion-based audit—the audit cycle The process of identifying
areas of care to be audited, implementing necessary changes, and
periodically reviewing the same issues is known as the audit cycle—see

Choosing a topic Any practice matter—clinical or administrative. Make
sure the topic is important, manageable, clearly defined, and data are
available to assess the criteria chosen. Good starting points are significant
events, QOF targets, complaints, National Service Framework or clinical
guideline topics, and personal observations.
Choosing criteria Criteria are specific statements of what should be
happening. Criteria might be those laid down for quality payments, ‘gold
standard’ care as defined in guidelines, or generated within the practice.
Use evidence-based criteria wherever possible. All criteria have to be
measurable—ideally with data already collected.
Setting standards Standards are minimum levels of acceptable
performance for a criterion. 100% achievement of standards is unusual,
so set realistic standards based on quality framework levels and standards
achieved by other practices (e.g. comparative practice data, audits from
other practices) or previous audits within the practice.
Observing practice You can collect information from: computer registers;
medical records; questionnaires—patients, staff, or GPs; data collection
sheets (e.g. drugs in doctor’s bag are all in date).
Comparing results with standards Consider why standards have not been
met. What should be done? Who’s going to do it? When? How?
Repeating the audit cycle To ensure action taken is effective.

Significant event audit Process in which individual episodes (when
there has been a significant occurrence, either beneficial or deleterious)
are analysed in a systematic and detailed way to ascertain what can be
learnt about the overall quality of care and to indicate changes that might
lead to future improvements. Methods of reporting—see Table 4.3.
Table 4.3 Methods of reporting significant event audits
Reporting method 1

Reporting method 2

Description of event This should be brief and can
be in note form
Learning outcome This should describe the
aspects which were of high standard and those
that could be improved. Where appropriate, it
should include why the event occurred
Action plan The decision(s) taken need to be
contained in the report. The reasons for these
decisions should be described together with
any other lessons learned from the discussion

What happened?
Why did it happen?
Was insight demonstrated?
Was change implemented?

Education, monitoring, and research

Research in general practice
Discovery of new knowledge (research) and spreading that knowledge
(dissemination) is essential for provision of high-quality care. GPs may be
involved in research at many levels—as part of an academic department, in
a research general practice, or just taking part in a project. Drug company
research—b p. 148.

The research process See Figure 4.4
National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Commissions and

funds NHS and social care research in England and provides infrastructure
to support both studies and researchers within the NHS. M www.nihr.ac.uk

Primary Care Research Network (PCRN) One of a number

of research networks that operate under the umbrella of the NIHR.
Focusses on areas of research for which primary care has particular
responsibility: disease prevention, health promotion, screening,
early diagnosis, and the clinical management of long-term conditions.
Studies may be accepted onto its portfolio if the topic of the research
falls within the remit of the PCRN and funding has been obtained
through a recognized funding body as a result of open competition and
peer review. The PCRN keeps a list of all the studies in its portfolio.
M www.crncc.nihr.ac.uk/about_us/pcrn
Within the PCRN, there are eight local research networks. These provide support to researchers developing proposals and studies within the
portfolio through network-funded staff. This can be anything from help
with formulation of a study proposal, through identification of subjects and
recruitment, to help with data management.
0 A separate Primary Care Research Network operates in Scotland.

University departments of general practice Most UK medical

schools have a department of primary care. There are few GP academic
posts, but these departments are invaluable sources of advice and support
if you contemplate doing any original research of your own.

RCGP Supports research by giving advice to GPs, providing research
training fellowships and research funding through the Scientific Foundation
Board, sponsoring research units and research practices, and administering
a quality assessment scheme for research practices. M www.rcgp.org.uk
Ethics An ethics committee must pass all medical research involving

human participants. Information, contacts, and application forms are
available from the National Research Ethics Service M www.nres.nhs.uk

Funding Numerous sources of funding for primary care research
are available (including NIHR, RCGP, Medical Research Council, and
Wellcome Trust), but all are keenly fought for. Take time preparing your
protocol. Ask for advice. It helps to have an experienced researcher as
co-applicant on the application form or as project supervisor.

Research in general practice

Turn your idea into a specific research question
• What is your aim/hypothesis?
• Review the literature (b p. 74)
• Is your idea novel?
• Why does it matter?

Design the study and develop your methods
• Involve participants/other researchers
• Qualitative or quantitative methodology?
• Survey design/sample size
• How are you going to choose/randomize participants?
• Who is going to do the work?

Obtain permissions, funding, and PCRN acceptance
• Ask the healthcare Trust in which the research will be performed
• Ensure that you contact the research governance officer of the
organization within which your research will be carried out, and
comply with local and national requirements
• Obtain ethics permission
• Obtain funding to cover the costs of the study and staff required
• Gain acceptance onto the PCRN (or another research network)
portfolio

Collect and collate data Remember the importance of data
protection (b p. 51).

Analyse and interpret data
• Consider involving a professional statistician for quantitative data
• Think about the implications of the study findings
• Identify how findings can be put into practice

Write up and disseminate findings
• Journal articles
• Conference presentations
• Press releases
• Submission for higher degrees

Outcomes in general practice
Within the NHS, there are i demands for accountability/improvements
in quality of care. To measure this requires use of appropriate outcomes.

Patient satisfaction Implies meeting both the wants and needs of the
patient. Satisfaction measures are increasingly being used to judge the
effectiveness of the NHS. Surveys of satisfaction show ~80% of patients are
overall satisfied with GP care, but, if questioned more specifically about
different components of care (e.g. information provided, communication,
etc.), fewer than half are completely satisfied.

Revalidation Measuring patient satisfaction of ≥34 patients using a
validated tool approved by the GMC is a requirement for GPs once in
every 5y revalidation cycle. Approved surveys include:
• GMC Patient Questionnaire M www.gmc-uk.org
• Consultation and Relational Empathy (CARE) measure M www.
gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/healthwellbeing/research/generalpractice/

• Doctors’ Interpersonal Skills Questionnaire (DISQ) 0 Charge
payable. M www.cfepsurveys.co.uk
• Consultation Satisfaction Questionnaire (CSQ) 0 Charge payable.

GPs must reflect on results and address any development needs.

Peer feedback Is a tool widely used in business to assess worker’s

performance. It may take many forms—from team meetings during which
colleague feedback is encouraged, through annual appraisal by a practice
manager, to 360o or multi-source feedback forms.
Revalidation Feedback from ≥12 professional colleagues representing the
range of your professional activities, using a validated multi-source feedback
(MSF) tool approved by the GMC, is a compulsory element of revalidation
and must be performed once in every 5y cycle. Approved MSF tools
include:
• GMC Colleague Questionnaire M www.gmc-uk.org

Comparative practice data The government’s ‘transparency agenda’

has resulted in publication of data held by government departments on the
performance of public services, including general practice. Data now in the
public domain are listed in Box 4.2.

Referrals There are wide variations in referral rates (~3–12/100
consultations) not accounted for by population characteristics. Experience
in a specialty i referrals, implying high referrers are not always inadequate.
Referral management schemes Attempts have been made to judge
appropriateness of referrals either at practice or at locality level through
referral management schemes. All referrals are scrutinized to judge
whether the referral is needed at all and (if referral is warranted) whether
referral is being made to the most cost-effective service.
Prescribing rates There are wide variations in prescribing rates, e.g.
variation in the rate of statin prescription cannot be accounted for by
population characteristics; prescription rates for antibiotics for minor
illness vary widely between GPs. Whether and how these reflect quality
of care is controversial, but comparison of practice prescribing data within
localities and prescribing quality targets are driving down prescribing costs.
Procedures Comparisons of procedure outcome (e.g. inadequate smear
rates, diabetic outcome measures, immunization rates) between practices
can be a way to identify individuals or practices clearly performing less well
than others. The reasons must then be investigated.
Doctors’ ability to detect illness There are wide variations between
GPs in their ability to detect certain illnesses, e.g. mental illness. GPs adept
at identifying mental health problems have empathy, early eye contact; use
directive rather than closed questioning; clarify the complaint at an early
stage. Whether this is a marker of quality of care or just the diversity of
general practice is debatable.

The consultation
Over the past 15y, there has been a 40% i in demand for GP appointments in the UK. Each patient now has an average of 5.5 appointments/y.
Older people have the highest consultation rate (those >80y have 13.5
appointments/y), and consultation rate is set to i as the population ages.

Potential barriers to effective communication Lack of time,

language problems, differing gender, age, ethnic or social background of
doctor and patient, ‘sensitive’ issues to address, ‘hidden’ or differing agendas,
prior difficult meetings, lack of trust between doctor/patient.

The consultation Good communication is essential for all aspects
of a GP’s work. The consultation is the cornerstone of general practice
and focusses on successful information exchange. Various consultation
models exist (b p. 90) to help GPs evaluate their consultations and make
optimum use of the time available. There is no ‘correct’ way to perform
a consultation. Approach will vary according to situation and participants.
Patient centredness Means that the patient’s viewpoint is considered and
integrated into the diagnosis and decision-making process (see Figure 5.1).
It improves patient satisfaction and may improve health outcomes. It
consists of 6 interactive components:
• Exploring the disease and illness experience
• Understanding the whole person in context
• Finding common ground regarding management
• Incorporating prevention and health promotion
• Enhancing the doctor–patient relationship
• Being realistic

The consultation

Patient recall Many studies suggest that >50% (some estimate up to

90%) of information has been forgotten within a few minutes of leaving the
surgery. Characteristics of memorable information:
• The patient perceives it as important
• The patient understands it (avoid the use of jargon and medical terms,
keep language brief and simple, support information with sketches/
diagrams ± patient information sheets)
• The information is given early in the consultation
• The information is given in small chunks (not too much at once)

Consultation length Although consultations are usually booked at
10min intervals in the UK, average consultation length is now 11.7min.
Instead of managing acute illness, GPs now focus on management of
long-term conditions, resulting in i complexity of consultations. Despite
this, UK consultations are still a third shorter than those in other parts of
the world, e.g. the USA, Switzerland, New Zealand, Belgium, or Australia.
Timekeeping Running late is stressful and frustrating for patients.

General practice does not fit conveniently into 10min (or any other size)
slots. Even the best time keepers occasionally run late. Tips:
• Endeavour to run to time Start on time; make appointments long enough
(e.g. book double appointments for difficult problems, schedule catch-up
slots in the middle of surgeries, change to longer appointments); break
difficult problems or multiple problems up into chunks
• If you are running late Ask reception staff to apologize to patients as
they check in, and tell them the expected delay
Benefits of longer consultation times Include:
• i patient and doctor satisfaction
• i health promotion
• i identification of psychosocial problems • d reconsultation rates
• Improved doctor–patient communication • d minor illness prescribing

Heartsink patients Characterized by:

• Frequent presentation—the top 1% of attenders at GP surgeries
generate 6% of GP workload
•	Highly complex and often multiple problems—some real, others not
• Exasperation generated between patient and doctor
0 It is a two-way process. Some GPs report more heartsink patients than
others. The problem relates to the GP’s perception of patients as well as
the patients themselves. GP risk factors: perception of high workload; low
job satisfaction; lack of training in counselling or communication; lack of
postgraduate skills.
Management strategy Do a detailed review of notes ± chart of life.
• Agree contacts (e.g. limit to one GP, agree appointment frequency)
• Agree an agenda within consultations, e.g. problem list—1 problem/visit
• Employ reattribution techniques—see Somatization disorder, b p. 997
• Avoid unnecessary investigation and referral
• Be aware of your own reaction to the patient
• Acknowledge that such patients can be genuinely ill
• Consider psychiatric diagnoses—especially chronic anxiety, depression,
somatization disorder. Screening questionnaires can be useful
• Consider referral for CBT and/or specialist mental health support

Consultation models
The consultation process has been extensively studied—each model
views it from a slightly different perspective. A brief overview of each is
presented here—for more information, consult the original texts:

The medical model Traditional model. History taking l examination
l investigation l diagnosis l treatment l follow-up. Does not recognize
the complexity and diversity of the consultation in general practice.

Balint, 1957 The Doctor, His Patient and The Illness—a philosophy rather

than a consultation model:
• Psychological problems are often manifested physically
• Doctors have feelings. Those feelings have a role in the consultation
• Doctors need to be trained to be more sensitive to what is going on in
the patient’s mind during a consultation

Patient records
General principles
Be factual, consistent, and accurate Write records in an indelible fashion
as soon as possible after an event/encounter has occurred. Ensure logical
sequence; be clear, unambiguous, legible, and concise. Use standard coding
techniques if using an electronic record. Wherever possible, write notes
openly whilst patients/carers are present in terms they can understand.
Date, time, and sign (or otherwise identify yourself) on all entries.

Be relevant and useful Record:
• Information you have on which to base your decisions Problems
presented to you by the patient; relevant aspects of past and family
history; examination findings and test results you already have
• Your impression of the situation How you see the problem—may
include diagnosis, differential diagnosis, prognosis
• Plan of action Negotiated between patient and doctor—may include
tests requested, prescriptions given, referrals made
• Information shared and advice given Relevant worries or concerns
voiced by the patient; information provided to the patient; advice
given—especially contingency plans if things do not go to plan and
review/follow-up arrangements
• Other essential information e.g. correspondence to/from other
agencies; whether a sickness certificate was issued, for how long
and the reason stated on the certificate; if consent for disclosure of
information (b p. 50) or treatment/examination (b p. 52) was given
Do not include Abbreviations (especially unconventional ones);
jargon; personal views about behaviour or temperament unless they
have a bearing on the management of the patient.
Electronic patient records b p. 40
Summary Care Record (SCR) b p. 40
Confidentiality b p. 50
Amending records Rectify errors of fact or judgement. Any
alterations or additions should be dated, timed, and signed in such a way
that the original entry can still be seen. Patients may request correction of
information they believe is incorrect—you must record the patient’s view.
Highlight amendments and reasons for them.

Access to records Under the Data Protection Act 1998, patients have
a right of access to health records which:
• Are about them and from which they can be identified
• Consist of information relating to their health or condition, and
•	Have been made in connection with their care

0 Most records doctors make are included whenever they were made.

Patient records

Who can seek access?
• Any competent person may seek access to their own health records,
including competent children (b p. 50)
• Any person with parental responsibility may apply for access to
records of a child (<18y or <16y in Scotland). Where >1 person has
parental responsibility, each may apply independently without consent
of the other parent
• A third party authorized by a competent person may seek access to
that person’s records (e.g. a solicitor or insurance company), but proof
of permission from the patient must be provided. If there is doubt,
contact the patient to verify consent has been given (b p. 50)

Mentally incapacitated adults Where access is sought and the

individual to whom the patient records pertain lacks capacity to give
permission, decisions must be based on an evaluation of the person’s best
interests, taking into account the views of the person’s representative(s)
and reflecting the individual’s expressed wishes and values—b p. 50.

Access to dead patients’ records b p. 50
Requests for access Nothing prevents doctors from giving patients
access to their records on an informal basis, provided there is no reason
preventing disclosure. Information must not be disclosed if it:
• is likely to cause serious physical or mental harm; or
• relates to a third party who has not given consent for disclosure (when
not a health professional who has cared for the patient)
0 If unsure, take advice from the BMA or your defence organization.
Formal applications for access must be in writing and accompanied by the
appropriate fee. Patients are entitled to a permanent copy of information
(e.g. photocopy, printout), which must be accompanied by an explanation
of any unintelligible terms. Access must be given within 40d of receipt of
the fee and request. Contact BMA for current fees.

Security of records Do not leave records (electronic or manual)
unattended in easily accessible areas. When not in use, ideally store all
files and portable equipment under lock and key. Query the status of
strangers. Highlight any concerns to the practice/security manager. Do not
reveal how security systems operate.
• Manual records Store files closed and in logical order. Use a tracking
system to monitor the whereabouts of files, and return files taken
away as soon as they are no longer required
• Electronic records Do not leave a terminal unattended and logged
in. Do not share logins or reveal your password to others. Change
passwords regularly, and avoid using short or obvious ones. Always
clear the screen of a previous patient’s information before seeing
another. Use a password-protected screen saver to prevent casual
viewing of patient information by others

Telephone consulting and home visits
To cope with i demand for GP appointments, the past 20y have seen the
proportion of GP consultations that take place over the telephone rise
from 3% to 12%; simultaneously, the proportion of consultations taking
place in patients’ own homes has fallen from 9% to 3.5%.

Emergency telephone consultations Nearly all requests for
emergency care are made by telephone. General rules:
• Train surgery staff to handle distressed callers, recognize serious
problems, and act appropriately when such calls are received
• Where possible, use a single number for patients to access help. If
using an answering machine, ensure the message is easily heard and
contains clear instructions
• Appear helpful from the outset. Keep calm and friendly—even if
provoked; worried callers often appear abrupt or demanding
• Record the time of the call, date, patient’s name, the address the
patient is at and a contact telephone number, brief details of the
problem, and action taken (even if calls are being recorded)
• Collect only information you need to decide whether a visit or urgent
surgery appointment is necessary. If a visit is necessary, collect enough
information to decide how quickly the patient should be seen and
whether extra equipment or help is needed. If a visit is not necessary,
decide whether other actions, such as an urgent surgery appointment,
would be more appropriate
• If giving advice, make it simple and in a language the patient can
understand. Repeat to make sure it has been understood. Consider
asking the patient/carer to repeat what you have told them. Always tell
callers to ring back if symptoms change or they have further worries
• If a visit is indicated, ensure the address is right and ask for directions if
you are not sure where to go. Try to give a rough arrival time
• In some cases (e.g. major trauma, large GI bleeds, MI, stroke, burns,
overdoses), call for an emergency ambulance at once
• If a call seems inappropriate, consider the reason for it, e.g. depression
might provoke recurrent calls for minor ailments
• If in doubt—see the patient.

Routine telephone consultations Occur in different ways:
•
•
•
•

Telephone triage systems to filter requests for surgery appointments
Telephone clinics where patients are free to ring with their problems
Telephone message books, and/or
Bookable telephone slots in surgery time

The telephone is a useful way to answer simple queries without wasting
surgery time. Examples include:
• Consultations for minor, self-limiting conditions or conditions that do
not require an examination
• Follow-up of surgery consultations, e.g. to give results, or to offer
management advice/prescription following investigations

Telephone consulting and home visits

The biggest drawbacks of telephone consultations are:
• Inability to examine the patient, and
• Lack of visual cues to aid communication
Be alert for verbal cues (e.g. lowering of the voice, hesitations, signs of distress). Ask about ideas/concerns, and invite the patient to ask questions.
Before giving advice, ensure you have sufficient information upon which to
base your judgement. If examination is needed, see the patient.

Home visiting Home visits may be routine checks for housebound
patients or emergency visits for patients temporarily unable to get to the
surgery. Home visits done in working hours are usually done by practices
under their GMS/PMS contract, but, in some areas, home-visiting services
are provided by the PCO and practices are able to ‘opt out’.
Routine visits Conducted like ordinary surgery consultations. Seeing
patients in their own home may give valuable extra information.
Emergency visits
• Try to stick to the problem you have been called about
• Take a concise history and examine as appropriate
• Make a decision on management, and explain it to the patient and any
carers in clear and concise terms they can understand. Repeat advice
several times ± write it down
• Record history, examination, management suggested, and advice given
for the patient’s notes
• Always invite the patient and carers to ring you again should symptoms
change, the situation deteriorate, or further worries appear
• For inappropriate calls, take time to educate the patient and/or carers
about self-management and use of emergency GP visiting services
• Always consider hidden reasons for seemingly unnecessary visits
Being prepared
• Ensure you have a reliable car with a full tank of fuel
•	Have a good street map and in-car electronic navigation system
• Carry a mobile phone and large, strong torch in the car
• Check your drug box is fully stocked and all items are in date
• Check all equipment carried is operational and carry spare batteries
• Carry a list of emergency telephone numbers and know which
chemists have extended opening hours and/or carry the chemist’s rota

Safety and security
• In all cases, ensure someone else knows where you are going, when
to expect you back, and what to do if you do not return on time
• If going to a call you are worried about, either take someone with you
to sit in the car or call the police to meet you there before going in
• If you are uncomfortable, make sure you can get out. Note the layout
of the property, and make sure you have a clear route to the door
• Set up your mobile phone to call the police or your base at a single
touch of a button. Consider carrying an attack alarm
• If possible, have separate bags for drugs and consultation equipment;
leave the drug box locked out of sight in the boot of the car when visiting

Referral letters and electronic media
Referral letters Good communication is essential when referring
patients to other doctors and agencies. Electronic pre-filled word
processing templates may fill in some information automatically, but
ensure that all referral letters include:
• Address of the referrer (including telephone number, if possible), name
and address of registered GP if not the referrer, and date of referral
•	Name, address, telephone number, and date of birth of the patient
(and any other identifiers available, e.g. hospital or NHS number)
•	Name of the person to whom the patient is being referred (or
department if not a named individual)
• Presenting condition—history, examination, investigations already
performed with results, treatments already tried with outcomes
• Relevant past medical history and family history
• Current medication, and any intolerances/allergies known
• Reason for referral (what you want the recipient of the letter to do),
e.g. to investigate symptoms, to reassure parents
• Any other relevant information, e.g. social circumstances
• Signature (and name in legible format) of referrer ± GMC number
• Ensure that a copy of the referral letter is stored on the patient’s
electronic record
Use of e-mail in the GP surgery
Dissemination of information E-mail is widely used in the UK to
disseminate (cascade) information to GPs, e.g. NICE, DH, MHRA, PCOs.
Communication with doctors/other healthcare
communications between doctors occur by e-mail both
and also between practices/other healthcare providers
advice by email). 0 E-mail transfer between non-NHS
should never be considered secure or confidential.

within practices
(e.g. consultant
e-mail accounts

Communication with patients 780% of the UK population now has
access to e-mail. Cyber-savvy patients increasingly want to be able to
communicate with healthcare professionals by e-mail, but e-mail has
been used relatively little to date due to concerns over quality of e-mail
content, time lag, confidentiality, and liability. Its use is likely to develop
further. Successful use of e-mails depends on both the doctor and patient
having a clear understanding of its role, advantages, and limitations.
Guidelines for e-mail consultations with patients
• Establish turnaround time; do not use e-mail for urgent matters
• Warn users that e-mail is not secure and that they cannot assume
confidentiality just because they are communicating with a doctor
• Advise patients not to use a work or multi-user e-mail
• Retain copies of e-mail communications with patients
• Instruct patients to put the category of transaction in the subject line
of the message for filtering: prescription, appointment, medical advice
• Request that patients put their name and date of birth in the message
for identification purposes

Referral letters and electronic media

• Configure an automatic reply to acknowledge receipt of messages
• Send a new message to inform the patient of completion of the
request; ensure that others are not copied into the reply
• Avoid giving person-specific information or confirming information
given by the patient—it may not be the patient
•	Never write anything that you would not be happy to see printed on a
newspaper front page
• Request that patients use reply to acknowledge reading your message
• Append a standard block of text to the end of e-mail messages to
patients which contains the GP’s full name, contact information, and
reminders about security and the importance of alternative forms of
communication for emergencies
• Explain to patients that their messages should be concise
• Remind patients when they do not adhere to the guidelines

Social media Internet-based websites/tools allowing users to create/
share content between networks of people, e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter, YouTube. Social media are used successfully by doctors to:
• Establish wider/more diverse social and professional networks
• Engage the public and colleagues in debates
• Facilitate public access to accurate health information, and
• Improve patient access to services
Risks of social media use
• Loss of personal privacy
• Potential breaches of confidentiality
• Online behaviour that might be perceived as unprofessional, offensive,
or inappropriate by others
• Risks of posts being reported by the media or sent to employers
Guidance on social media use The BMA, GMC, and RCGP have all
produced guidelines for doctors on the use of social media. Key points:
• Social media blurs boundaries between public/professional lives
• Adopt conservative privacy settings where available, but be aware that
not all information can be protected on the web
• Ethical and legal duties to protect patient confidentiality apply equally
on the internet as to other media
• It is inappropriate to post informal, personal, or derogatory comments
about patients or colleagues on public internet forums
• Doctors who post online should declare any conflicts of interest
• Do not accept Facebook friend requests from current/former patients
• Defamation law can apply to any comments posted on the web made
in either a personal or professional capacity
• Be conscious of online image and its impact on professional standing

Organization of out-of-hours services
What is urgent care? Urgent care refers to the range of responses
that the health and care services provide to people who need, or perceive
that they need, urgent advice, care treatment or diagnosis. Urgent ‘same
day’ appointments currently account for 1 in 3 daytime consultations in
general practice, so all GPs must have the skills/knowledge to manage
patients with a perceived urgent care need. Effective GPs can manage
patients with urgent care needs so that ‘dangerous diagnoses’ are not
missed and A&E and acute hospital services are used efficiently.
What are OOH services? Urgent primary medical care is provided
by out-of-hours (OOH) services from 6.30 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays and
throughout weekends and public holidays—a total of at least 70% of every
week. In England alone, every year primary care OOH services:
• Receive 8.6 million calls, and
• Complete 6.8 million assessments—3 million in out-of-hours primary
care centres (44%), 2.9 million by telephone (43%), and 0.9 million
through home visits (13%)
1.5% of the calls dealt with are considered ‘life-threatening’ emergencies
and 15% are classified as ‘urgent’.

‘Opting out’ of OOH Both PMS and GMS practices can ‘opt out’ of
providing an OOH service. The decision must be made for the whole
practice; individual doctors within a practice cannot ‘opt out’ alone. The
cost of opting out is 7% of the global sum (or PMS equivalent).
OOH work by ‘opted out’ practices There is nothing to stop
practices that have opted out from offering surgeries or consultations
within the time periods specified as OOH. These services can be paid for
through the practice global sum or under the ‘extended opening’ DES.
Choice of OOH provider PCOs can consider a range of alternative
OOH care providers as long as accreditation standards are met. Only
where a practice is exceptionally remote, will the PCO be able to require
a practice to continue providing OOH care. Special arrangements for
payment then exist. Several schemes currently operate side by side:
• In-practice rota Traditional model of cover that is now increasingly
rare; usually organized in a rota between practice GPs and largely
based on home visiting
• Extended rota GPs on-call in rotation for a small group of practices
• GP co-operative GPs within an area grouped together (often >100
practices in a co-op) to cover the OOH period either between themselves
or by employing other GPs; often several GPs are on call at any time, e.g.
one doing visits; one taking calls; one seeing patients in a clinic
• Hospital-based OOH cover GPs and primary care nurses in A&E
departments
• Commercial OOH service OOH provided by a commercial
profit-making organization employing GPs and specialist nurses
• NHS 111 and NHS24 24h nurse-led telephone advice service
available throughout England (NHS 111), Wales (NHS 111 Wales)

Organization of out-of-hours services

and Scotland (NHS 24) designed as first-line services aiming to have
links to local primary care and OOH services; the telephone services
are supported by websites providing healthcare information
• NHS walk-in centre Walk-in clinics tend to offer nurse consultation
and use NHS diagnosis and management algorithms; most are sited in
urban areas and aim to provide easier access to medical care
• Enhanced paramedic service Providing initial assessment of patients
who are unable to get to OOH centres and/or patient transport to
OOH centres
• Enhanced community nursing team Providing care to patients
terminally ill and initial assessment of patients who do not feel able to
get to an OOH centre for other reasons

Challenges for GPs when providing OOH care
•	Higher proportion of very ill patients; GPs may need to commence
resuscitation or critical illness management protocols more frequently
• Often no information about patients apart from the information that
the patient/carer provides
• Much bigger team—GPs often do not know other team members and
may be unfamiliar with their working environment
• OOH GPs may work alone for a high proportion of their time doing
home visits or manning an out-of-hours clinic
• Access to drugs and some services may be limited
• First contact is almost always over the telephone and good
communication skills are needed to provide accurate assessment,
triage to appropriate care, and ensure safety netting

The future of NHS OOH care Over recent years, the NHS OOH
service has been criticized for variability in coverage and care provided,
access difficulties because of the variety of different out-of-hours providers
operating across the UK, and being poor value for money.
The government has made a commitment to provide a coherent 24h
urgent care service. In some parts of the UK, the NHS 111 service is
being used to route all urgent but non-emergency calls in the out-of-hours
period through a single triage system—giving advice or directing callers to
the appropriate service (e.g. A&E, ambulance call, GP home visit, or GP
appointment). Since 2014, GP practices have a responsibility for monitoring
the quality of OOH services for their registered patients.
Pre-hospital emergency care To meet calls for increasing

sophistication of pre-hospital emergency care, a new sub-specialty has been
developed. For GPs, particularly those working in urgent care settings or with
populations that are geographically remote from acute specialist services,
expertise in this sub-specialty would clearly be beneficial. However, currently
GP training does not allow GPs to meet the basic entry requirement for this
sub-specialty. Changes in GP training should remedy this.

Social factors in general practice
‘The task of medicine is to promote health, to prevent disease and to
treat the sick . . . These are highly social functions’
H.E. Sigerist, Civilization and Disease (1943)

Inverse care law Julian Tudor Hart’s inverse care law states that ‘the

availability of good medical care tends to vary inversely with the need of
the population served’. This paradox is true across different diseases and
healthcare systems. Health inequalities are not inevitable and addressing
social factors can contribute significantly in reducing them; 60% of health
improvement in the past century is not attributable to advances in medical
care but instead to changes in social factors, such as better housing.
Deprivation Social deprivation is linearly associated with death from
all causes, with no threshold and no upper limit. Most pronounced effects
are in relation to infant mortality, morbidity/mortality from chronic illness
(particularly musculoskeletal, CVD, and respiratory conditions), and
teenage pregnancy. This is not a new problem nor one unique to the UK.
Disparity in health is closely related to income. In the UK an i proportion
of the population is now living on <50% of average income than 20y ago—
the mortality gap has grown proportionately.
Impact on general practice Higher incidence of illness li requirement
for primary care team services and i use of OOH and A&E services
amongst deprived communities. This is recognized in the UK in the CarrHill Index which allocates funds to practices (b p. 24).
Benefits for people with low income b p. 104

Homelessness
Temporary accommodation Adverse effects of living in temporary
accommodation are well documented:
• Adults have an i incidence of depression than people of similar social
standing in their own homes
•	Homeless women are 2x as likely to have problems in pregnancy and
3x as likely to require admission in pregnancy
• ¼ of babies born to women living in bed and breakfast
accommodation are of low birthweight (national average <1 in 10)
• Children from these families are less likely to receive their
immunizations, more likely to have childhood accidents and have
higher incidence of minor respiratory tract and diarrhoeal diseases
Sleeping rough Poor diet, poor accommodation, and lack of access to
medical services are universal problems in this group. Less than 70% are
registered with a GP. Many homeless people will suffer from a triad of
poor physical health, mental health, and substance misuse; the average
age of death is 40–44y. Homeless people have a higher than average use
of emergency and hospital inpatient services as a result. Evidence shows
that if primary care services are provided, homeless people will use them.
Divorce Divorcees of all ages are at greater risk of premature death (2x
i for men aged 35–42y) than married people—mainly from cardio- and
cerebrovascular disease, cancer, suicide, and accidental death. There is
also a similar i in morbidity. Children of divorced parents have i risk of ill

Social factors in general practice

health from the time of separation until adult life—with children <5y old
when their parents separate being particularly vulnerable. These children
are also more prone to psychiatric illness later in life and are more likely
to become divorced themselves.

Employment and unemployment
‘Without work all life goes rotten’

Albert Camus

Effects of work have been compared to effects of vitamins—we need a
certain amount to be healthy, then there is a plateau where extra does not
help—and too much is harmful. There is good evidence that unemployment causes both i mortality (from CVD, cancers, suicide, violence, and
accidents) and i morbidity (depression, CVD). Threat of unemployment
alone can cause morbidity—in one study, GP consultation rates rose by
20% and referral rates by 60% after it was announced a factory would
close. Increases were found in other family members too.
Refugees and asylum seekers The Geneva Convention defines
a refugee as any person who, ‘owing to well-founded fear of being
persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a
particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his
nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return it.’
Refugees are entitled to free healthcare in the UK. Consider:
• Language, cultural, and religious issues (b p. 106)
• Physical needs Health needs are diverse depending on country of
origin and previous level of healthcare. Always consider infectious
diseases, e.g. hepatitis B, HIV, TB, and malaria. Ensure refugees claim all
health-related benefits available to them (e.g. free prescriptions)
• Psychological needs Depression, anxiety, panic attacks, agoraphobia,
and poor sleep are common. Symptoms are often reactions to past
experiences and current situation. Social isolation, unemployment,
deprivation, hostility, and racism compound them. Use medication if
appropriate but also address other issues. • Although telling their
story is helpful for some refugees, ‘active forgetting’ is the way some
people cope with their difficulties
• Victims of torture May present with many non-specific health problems.
Some are the result of physical trauma—most are of mixed physical
and psychological origin. Considerable time and patience is needed to
manage them but it is worth it. Advice and support is available from
Freedom from Torture (M www.freedomfromtorture.org)
• Family Many will have left other family members behind. They may not
know their whereabouts or even if they are alive or dead. The Red Cross
or Red Crescent can help with tracing (M www.redcross.org.uk)

Multicultural medicine
Britain is a multicultural and multifaith society. It is important that providers of care take into account cultural and spiritual needs.
• Table 5.1 is a rough guide to religious differences which affect health
care. It is forcibly brief and cannot address all the many variations.
Everyone is an individual, and there is a real danger of ‘pigeonholing’
patients by religion or ethnic background and making incorrect assumptions as a result. Always ask patients/family about their own preferences.

Communication Effective communication is essential. Do not assume
English proficiency; it is important to ascertain that you understand the
patient and that the patient understands you.
• Ask the patient to let you know if he/she does not understand;
consider using an interpreter
• Speak clearly and slowly and repeat important information; avoid
jargon, confusing phrases, double negatives, and rhetorical questions
• Ask patients to tell you what you have said to check comprehension
• Be wary of sounding condescending—English skills are not a reflection
of a hearing disorder or level of intelligence

Respect beliefs and attitudes People have different reactions
towards illness, life, and death. Ask patients to provide you with information
about their own ideas, e.g for newly arrived immigrants, ask: ‘Could you
tell me what would happen to you if you were in your country?’

Using interpreters Interpreters are an important resource in providing

a voice for patients whose proficiency in English is poor or insufficient
for the situation. In general, anyone who has been in an English-speaking
country for <2y will need an interpreter. Sometimes a friend or another
family member can be used but if sensitive issues have to be discussed or it
is essential that the information is translated accurately, use a professional.
General tips:
• Anticipate an interpreter will be needed where possible, and pre-book
someone of the same gender who speaks the same language/dialect
and will be ethnically acceptable to the patient
• Explain that the interpreter is bound to maintain confidentiality
• Face and speak in the first person directly to the patient, not the
interpreter; interpreters are solely there to convey information in a
language both patient and doctor can understand—not to analyse
information or decide what should or should not be conveyed

Breaking bad news
It is never easy to break bad news. GPs do it frequently, but police officers
are rated as showing more sympathy than doctors.

Why is breaking bad news hard?
• Admission of failure When we tell patients bad news, it is often an
admission that we have failed. When we fail we naturally question
what we have done and when looking at our practice in retrospect, it
is easy to find fault. Feelings of guilt are common
• Fear of the reaction of the patient We all have a desire to avoid
unpleasantness but sharing information with patients may be a positive
way forwards. Even if news is bad it gives patients control of the
situation

Guidelines for sharing bad news with a patient
DO

DON’T

• Plan the consultation as far as
possible. Check the facts first,
and ensure you have all the
information. Ensure privacy and
freedom from interruption
• Set aside enough time
• Ask if the patient would like a
relative or friend with them.
Make sure you introduce
yourself and find out their name
and relationship to the patient
• Make eye contact—watch for
non-verbal messages. Sit at the
same level as the patient
• Use simple and straightforward
language
• Allow silence, tears, or anger
• Be prepared to go over
facts again
• Answer questions
• Reflect on what the patient or
relative have said to allow you
to modify your understanding
of their feelings
• Take into account the patient’s
current health, e.g. if in pain, then
sort out the pain and schedule
a further discussion when the
patient is more comfortable
• Offer ongoing support

Lie or fudge the issue
Get your facts wrong
Break bad news in public
Give the impression of being
rushed or distant
Give too much information. It
is better to be concise—the
finer points can be filled
in later
Interrupt or argue
Say that ‘nothing can be
done’—there is always
something that can be done
Meet anger with anger
Say you ‘know how they
feel’—you don’t
Be frightened to admit you
don’t know something
Use medical jargon
Leave the patient with no
follow-on contact
Agree to withhold information
from the patient

Breaking bad news

Common problems
• What if the relatives do not want you to tell the patient? With
adults of sound mind, information is confidential to the patient and can
only be released, even to close relatives, with the patient’s permission.
Relatives who say they do not want the patient to know often do so
to protect their relative. It is important to recognize they know your
patient best. First, explore their worries and point out the difficulties
of the patient not knowing. Often once a relative realizes that the
patient knows things are not right and needs help and support to face
the situation, they come round to the patient being told. Stress that
you will not lie to a patient if asked a direct question
• How do you know if the patient wants to know? Most people
(80–90%) do want to know. Assume this is the case and then feel your
way carefully. Give the patient ample opportunity to say that they do
not want to know
• How do you respond to questions you cannot answer? The best way
to deal with this is to say that you do not have all the answers but will
answer when you can, find out what you can, and say when you do
not know

Consulting and certification

Confirmation and certification of death
• The death certification process in England and Wales is currently
under review and likely to change in the near future.
English law does not require a doctor:
• To confirm death has occurred or that ‘life is extinct’. A doctor is only
required to certify what, in their opinion, was the cause
• To view the body of a deceased person. There is no obligation to see/
examine a body before issuing a death certificate
• To report the fact that death has occurred
English law does require the doctor who attended the deceased during the
last illness to issue a certificate detailing the cause of death. Certificates
are provided by the local Registrar of births, marriages, and deaths. A special certificate is needed for infants of <28d old.

Death in the community 1 in 4 deaths occur at home.
Expected deaths In all cases, advise to contact the undertakers and
ensure the patient’s own GP is notified.
• Patient’s home Visit as soon as is practicable
• Residential/nursing home If possible the GP who attended during
the patient’s last illness should visit and issue a death certificate. The
‘on-call’ GP is often requested to visit. There is no statutory duty to do
this but it is reassuring for the staff at the home and often necessary
before staff are allowed to ask for the body to be removed
Unexpected and/or ‘sudden’ death If called, advise the attendant to
call the emergency services. Visit and take a rapid history from any
attendants. Then:
• Resuscitate if appropriate Drowning and hypothermia can protect
against hypoxic neurological damage; brains of children <5y old are
more resistant to damage
• Report the death to the coroner If any suspicious circumstances or
circumstances of death are unknown/unclear—call the police
Alternatively, if police or ambulance service is already in attendance and
death has been confirmed, suggest the police surgeon is contacted.

Cremation Cremation Regulations (2008) require two doctors to
complete a certificate to establish identity and that the cause of death
is not suspicious before a person can be cremated. The person arranging
the funeral may see the forms and pays a fee to each doctor. Two parts:
• Cremation 4 Completed by the patient’s usual medical attendant—
usually his/her GP
• Cremation 5 Completed by another doctor who must have held full
GMC registration (or equivalent) for ≥5y and is not connected with
the patient in any way nor directly connected with the doctor who
issued cremation form 4—usually a GP from another practice
• Pacemakers and radioactive implants must be removed from the
deceased before cremation can take place.

Confirmation and certification of death

Notification of death to the coroner The coroner can be contacted

via the local police. Reporting to the coroner does not automatically entail
a post-mortem. The coroner, once circumstances of death are clear, may
advise the GP to tick and initial box A on the back of the certificate, which
advises the registrar that no inquest is necessary. Deaths that MUST be
reported to the coroner are listed in Box 5.1.
0 In Scotland deaths are reported to a procurator fiscal. The list of
reportable deaths is the same with the addition of deaths of foster children and the newborn.

Recording deaths at the practice Death registers are useful.
Routine communication of deaths to all members of the primary
healthcare team and other agencies involved with the care of that patient
(e.g. hospital consultants, social services) avoids the embarrassing and
distressing situation of ongoing appointments and contacts being made
for that patient. Record the death in the notes of any relatives/partner
registered with the practice.

Organ donation
Over 10,500 people in the UK are waiting for an organ transplant that
could save or dramatically improve their life, but ~3,700 transplants are
carried out each year. There is a desperate need for more donors. In 2011,
1,000 people died while waiting for a transplant.

Absolute contraindications to any organ donation There are

only 2 absolute contraindications to organ donation: HIV disease and
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (or other neurodegenerative diseases associated
with infectious agents).

Donor cards and the NHS Organ Donor Register Potential
donors should always discuss their wishes with their relatives. They can
register their desire to donate their organs after death by adding their
names to the NHS Organ Donor Register and obtaining an Organ Donor
Card. Contact the NHS Organ Donor Line F 0300 123 2323 or sign up
online at M www.organdonation.nhs.uk

Blood donation New donors age, 17–65y are accepted. Donors may
donate whole blood or platelets. Different blood transfusion services
operate in the devolved nations of the UK. Contacts:
• England F 0300 123 2323 M www.blood.co.uk
•	Northern Ireland F 028 9032 1414 M www.nibts.org
• Scotland F 0845 90 90 999 M www.scotblood.co.uk
• Wales F 0800 25 22 66 M www.welsh-blood.org.uk
Bone marrow donation Bone marrow donation is open to people

aged 18–49y who are blood donors (although may register at the time of
first donation). Volunteers are HLA tissue-typed using DNA from white
blood cells. Tissue type is recorded in the British Bone Marrow Registry.
Donation involves a small operation in which bone marrow is harvested—
usually from iliac crests.

Stem cell donation Peripheral stem cell donation is open to people
aged 18–49y who are blood donors (although may register at the time of first
donation). As for bone marrow donation, volunteers are HLA tissue-typed
using DNA from white blood cells. Their tissue type is recorded within the
British Bone Marrow Registry.
Donating stem cells involves daily injection of a growth factor (filgastrim)
for 4d; this releases stem cells into the peripheral blood. Stem cells are
harvested on day 5 using a cell separator from venous blood collected
from one arm; the blood is returned through a vein in the other arm.
Cord blood stem cell donation When delivering their babies in certain
hospitals in England, women can opt to donate cord blood for stem cell
harvesting. F 020 8437 1740 M www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/cordblood

Organ donation

Surgical organ donation from living donors Two main types:

• Donation at the time of routine operation Femoral heads can be
donated at the time of hip replacement; skin can be donated at the
time of cosmetic surgery (e.g. apronectomy)
• Surgery to remove living organs 1 kidney, part of lung, liver or small
intestine. Usually close relatives. Removal of the organ/part-organ
involves a major operation for the donor. Risks to donor must be
weighed against benefits to recipient

Heart-beating donation after death Donors must be maintained on
a life-support machine at the time of death and until the organs are removed.
The role of the GP in these situations is pre-emptive (information about
Organ Donor Register) and to support families to make the decision whether
to donate. Organs that can be donated: kidneys, hearts, liver, lungs, pancreas,
corneas, heart valves, bone, and skin.
Non-heart beating donation after death Most important group
for GPs as donation can occur up to 24h after death (sometimes up to
48h) even if the patient dies in the community. Contact NHS Blood and
Transplant F 0300 123 2323. Tissues that can be donated:
No upper age limit
• Corneas
• Skin
• Bone

<60y
• Heart valves
• Tendons

Donation of whole body for medical education The donor must
give authorization for donation prior to death. Relatives should contact
the medical school with which the donor has made arrangements after the
donor’s death. Medical schools arrange collection of the body and a simple
funeral. Not all bodies are accepted.
Tissue donation after death for research purposes Can be
done in addition to donation for transplantation—organs for transplant
are taken first.
Contact Human Tissue Authority F 020 7269 1900 M www.hta.gov.uk
Approach to relatives Many families find the act of donation a source

of comfort. Even when the person who has died is on the Organ Donor
Register, donation will be discussed with family members. However, if
a person has agreed to donation prior to death and this is recorded on
the Organ Donor Register, the family has no legal right to overrule that
decision.

The coroner For any patient normally referred to the coroner, the
coroner’s permission must be gained before tissues are removed.

Bereavement, grief, and coping with loss
Models of grief In the traditional model, the bereaved person moves
through phases until ‘recovery’:
• Initial shock Sense of unreality, detachment, disbelief, or ‘numbness’.
Lasts from hours to days
• Yearning Pangs of grief, episodes of intense pining, and a desire to
search interspersed with anxiety, guilt, and self-reproach
• Despair The permanence of the loss is realised. Despair and apathy,
social withdrawal, poor concentration, pessimism about the future
• Recovery Rebuilding of an identity and purpose in life
Recent models Grief represents an oscillation between loss- and
restoration-focussed behaviour, demonstrated by swings in mood,
thoughts, and behaviour between memories of the dead person and
‘getting on with life’. Avoidance or denial of the loss is common and a
part of the process.
Health consequences of bereavement
• i mortality (i deaths from CVD, cirrhosis, suicide, accidents)
particularly in first 6mo. Risk factors: 4 > 5, age <65y, lower
social class
• Mental health problems Depression, anxiety, i risk of suicide,
substance abuse, identification reaction (hyperchondriacal disorder—
symptoms mimic those of deceased, e.g. chest pain if died from MI),
insomnia, self-neglect
• Physical problems Fatigue, aches and pains (e.g. headaches,
musculoskeletal pain), appetite change, GI symptoms, d immune
response (i minor infection)
• Others Interference with family life, education and employment, social
isolation/loneliness, d income

Role of the primary care team Develop a practice policy for
bereaved patients. Flag notes. Consider staff training and active follow-up
of bereaved patients. If the person who has died is registered with the
practice, ensure all medical referrals/appointments are cancelled.
Bereaved children Children understand what death is by 8y, and

even children of 2–3y have some understanding of death. Exclusion makes
children isolated and often makes the death of someone they have known
more, not less, painful. Prepare children for a death if possible and give
them a chance to have their questions answered. If a child has problems,
seek specialist help.

Bereavement benefits Payable to men and women whose spouses
have died—including civil partnership, but cohabitation does not qualify,
except in Scotland. Claims can be made on forms available from the
bereavement services helpline F 0845 606 0265 or online via M www.gov.uk.
Current benefits available:
• Bereavement payment Claim <12 mo after death. Lump sum payable
if spouse has paid enough National Insurance contributions or death
was caused by employment and the recipient is below state pension
age at the time of the death

Bereavement, grief, and coping with loss

• Bereavement allowance Paid for 52wk from the date of bereavement
to spouses >45y and < retirement age, not bringing up children
• Widowed parent’s allowance Paid to widows/widowers with children
or if pregnant
• Funeral payment One-off payment for people on low income to help
with funeral costs
• War widows/widowers F 0800 169 2277 M www.veterans-uk.info
0 Bereavement payment, bereavement allowance, and widowed parent’s allowance will be merged into a single payment ‘Bereavement Support
Allowance’ consisting of a single lump sum payment and monthly allowance
(higher for people with dependent children) payable to widows/widowers
for 1y after death of a spouse.

Abnormal grief reactions Whether a grief reaction is normal or

abnormal depends on individual circumstances—personality, situation
surrounding death, and cultural expectations. Recognized patterns of
abnormal grief are:
• Inhibited grief—grief is absent or minimal
• Delayed grief—late onset, and
• Prolonged or chronic grief—inability to rebuild life in any way
If abnormal grief is suspected Monitor carefully. Consider referral for
bereavement counselling, e.g. to CRUSE. Consider clinical depression
(b p. 1000) or post-traumatic stress disorder (b p. 998). If symptoms
are persistent or worsening despite treatment or if there is suicidal risk,
refer to the mental health team for specialist advice.

Risk factors for poor outcome after bereavement
Predisposing factors
• Multiple prior bereavements
• Low self-esteem
• Poor social or family support
• Being male
•	History of mental illness, e.g. depression, anxiety, suicidal attempts/
threats
• Ambivalent or dependent relationship with the deceased
Situations where the circumstances of death may cause particular
problems for the bereaved
• Sudden or unexpected death
• Death due to AIDS or suicide
• Multiple deaths (e.g. disasters)
- Death of parent when child or adolescent
• Miscarriage; death of baby, child, or sibling
• Cohabiting partners, same sex partners, extramarital relationship
• Deaths where those bereaved may be responsible
• Deaths from murder, high media profile, or involving legal proceedings
• Where a post-mortem and/or inquest is required

Occupational illness
If a patient develops an occupational disease, a doctor is obliged to notify
the employer in writing, with the patient’s consent. The doctor does not
need to make a judgement about whether the disease is, in that particular
case, caused by the occupation.
Employers must then inform the Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and
Dangerous Occurrences Regulations (RIDDOR) incident contact centre
(F 0845 300 9923 M www.hse.gov.uk/riddor). Self-employed patients
must contact RIDDOR themselves.
Patients who do not give consent for the doctor to notify their employer
may allow the doctor to inform the employer’s occupational health
department or RIDDOR directly instead.

Notifiable industrial diseases 0 This is not a complete list:
• Poisoning by industrial agents, •
e.g. lead, arsenic, mercury
• Repetitive strain injury
•
• Vibration white finger
• Bursitis, e.g. housemaid’s knee •
•
• Occupational asthma
• Folliculitis and acne (associated •
with work with tar, pitch, or oils)
• Occupational infection, e.g.
hepatitis B in healthcare workers,
anthrax in farmers
• Chrome ulceration
• Irritant dermatitis, e.g.
hairdressers’ dermatitis

Tenosynovitis, e.g. as a result
of repeated movements of the
hand/wrist
Pneumoconiosis
Extrinsic allergic alveolitis
Occupational deafness
Occupational cancers, e.g.
nasopharyngeal cancer in
woodworkers, bladder cancer
in plastic workers, cancers as
a result of ionizing radiation,
mesothelioma due to asbestos
exposure

Industrial injury Injured employees should always report details of any
accident to their employer and record them in the accident book as soon as
possible—however trivial the injury. Employers must inform RIDDOR of:
• Dangerous incidents—even if no one was hurt
• Incidents where death or serious injury occurs
• Incidents resulting in injury requiring >3d absence from work
• Incidents involving gas
Prescribed industrial disease Disease for which benefit is paid if
the applicant worked in a job for which that disease is ‘prescribed’ and
it is likely the employment caused the disease. Claims may be made at
any time with the exceptions of occupational deafness (claim <5y after
leaving employment) and occupational asthma (claim <10y after leaving
employment). The list of prescribed diseases is similar to, but not the same
as, the list of notifiable diseases.

Occupational illness

Benefits that may be payable
Industrial injuries disablement benefit Available to employed earners for
injuries resulting from accidents or certain (prescribed) illness arising as a
result of employment, even if the employee was either part or wholly to
blame. ‘Industrial’ covers virtually all forms of work. For accidents, claims
can be made at any time after the event but benefit is paid only if there
are still effects of the injury after the 91st day.
Payable if the person was a paid employee at the time of the accident or
when he/she contracted the disease; and disability is assessed at ≥14%
(exceptions: occupational deafness >20%; dust-related lung disease—no
level). If a patient claims benefit for >1 industrial accident or disease,
assessments may be added together and benefit awarded on the total.
Reduced earnings allowance Accident occurred/disease was contracted
prior to 1st October 1990, disablement assessment of ≥1%, and
• Unable to work, or
• Unable to work at normal job, or
• Working less hours at normal job
Retirement allowance Reduced earnings allowance becomes retirement
allowance at age 60y (5) or 65y (4). It is paid at 25% the rate of reduced
earnings allowance when a claimant stopped work.
Constant attendance allowance For people so disabled that they need
constant care and attention and who are getting disablement benefit for
disability assessed at 100%. Four rates of benefit.
Exceptionally severe disablement allowance For people who get constant
attendance allowance at high rate and where need for attendance is likely
to be permanent.
0 People who suffer from industrial diseases or have suffered disability
as a result of an industrial accident are also eligible to apply for benefits
available for any disabled individuals (b p. 222–8).

Victims of crime
Victims of crime need treatment of injuries and emotional support.
•	Note the date, time, and place of the event
• Record injuries in detail (physical and psychological)—including
measuring the size of lacerations and bruises. Record all information
carefully as it may be needed for legal cases
• Arrange for photographs to be taken, if appropriate (police may
arrange this)
• Encourage reporting of the incident to the police—the patient will not
be eligible for criminal injury compensation if it is not reported
• Give patient details of local victim support groups
• If the patient’s safety is an issue, contact the duty social worker for a
place of safety

Rape and indecent assault If a patient reports rape or indecent
assault and is willing to report the matter to the police, do not examine
her/him. The case against the assailant could be won or lost on the basis
of evidence gained by examination of an alleged victim so it is best done
by a doctor trained and experienced in such work.
If the patient will not report the matter to the police
• Take a full history of the event. Note LMP, contraception, and sexual
history
• Suggest that the patient attends a Sexual Assault Referral Centre
(SARC) if available locally for forensic/medical examination and
specialist advice and support
If there is no SARC or the patient is unwilling to attend
• Make a note of any injuries and take photographs if possible and
appropriate. Do not insist on examination if the patient is unwilling.
Ensure a chaperone is present if any examination is attempted
• Discuss the need for emergency contraception, prophylactic antibiotics
(e.g. azithromycin 1g po stat), blood tests at 3mo to exclude
transmission of syphilis and at 3–6mo for exclusion of seroconversion
for HIV
• If at high risk for HIV transmission, refer to A&E for consideration of
prophylaxis (b p. 744)
• Discuss the need for counselling, and inform the patient about the
victim support scheme and Sexual Assault Referral Centres
• Arrange follow-up in 2–3wk

Domestic violence: the GP’s role
Domestic violence Is defined as any incident or pattern of incidents
of controlling, coercive or threatening behaviour, violence, or abuse
between those aged ≥16y who are/have been intimate partners or family
members regardless of gender or sexuality. This can encompass, but is not
limited to, the following types of abuse:
• Psychological
• Sexual
• Financial
• Physical
• Emotional
Controlling behaviour Acts designed to make people subordinate/

dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their
resources/capacities for personal gain, depriving them of means needed for
independence, resistance ± escape, and regulating their everyday behaviour.

Coercive behaviour Act/pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation
and intimidation or other abuse used to harm, punish, or frighten victims.

Prevalence Although men may be the victims of domestic violence,

~80% of reported domestic violence is against women by male partners.
Domestic violence affects ∼1 in 4 women and is the most common form
of interpersonal crime: 60%—current partner; 21%—former partner; half
suffer >1 attack; 1 in 3 have been attacked repeatedly.

Effects High incidence of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression,
and self-damaging behaviours, e.g. drug/alcohol abuse, suicide/parasuicide.
Factors preventing the victim leaving the abusive situation

•
•
•
•
•

Loss of self-esteem makes victims think they are to blame
Disruption of the family and children’s relationship with partner
Loss of intimate relationship with partner
Fear of partner
• Risk of homelessness
Fall in income
• Fear of the unknown

Presentation General practice is often the first place in which victims

seek formal help, but only 1 in 4 actually reveals the true nature of the
problem. Without appropriate intervention, violence continues and often
i in frequency and severity. By the time injuries are visible, violence may
be a long-established pattern. On average, victims will be assaulted 35
times before reporting it to police.

Guidelines for care
• Consider the possibility of domestic violence—ask directly
• Emphasize confidentiality
• Document—accurate, clear documentation, over time at successive
consultations may provide cumulative evidence of abuse and is
essential for use as evidence in court, should the need arise
• Assess the present situation—gather as much information as possible
• Provide information; offer help to make contact with other agencies
• Devise a safety plan, e.g. give the phone number of local women’s
refuge; advise to keep some money and important financial and legal
documents hidden in a safe place in case of emergency; help plan an
escape route in case of emergency

Domestic violence: the GP’s role

0 Do not pressurize the victim into any course of action. If the patient
decides to return to the violent situation, she or he will not forget the
information and support given. In time this might give her/him the confidence and back-up needed to break out of the situation.
• If children are likely to be at risk, you have a duty to inform social
services or the police, preferably with the patient’s consent.

Assault b p. 118
Non-accidental injury in children b p. 924
Elder abuse Single or repeated act or lack of appropriate action,

occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust,
which causes harm or distress to an older person. Prevalence is 4% (i with
age; 5:4 8 2:1)—neglect 1.2%; financial 1%; interpersonal 1.8%. Older
people may report abuse but often do not. Different forms may coexist:
• Physical, e.g. cuts, bruises, unexplained fractures, burns
• Psychological, e.g. unusual behaviour, unexplained fear, appears
helpless or withdrawn
• Financial, e.g. removal of funds by carers, new will in favour of carer
• Sexual, e.g. vaginal or anal bleeding, genital infections
• Neglect, e.g. malnourished, dehydrated, poor personal hygiene, late
requests for medical attention
Signs Inconsistent story from patient and carer; inconsistencies on
examination; fear in presence of carer; frequent attendance at A&E;
frequent requests for GP visits; carer avoiding GP.
Management Talk through the situation with the patient, carer, and other
services involved in care. Assess the level of risk. Consider admission to
a place of safety—contact social services and/or police as necessary; seek
advice from Action on Elder Abuse.
Adult safeguarding An adult (>18y) at risk of harm:
• May be in receipt of community care services by reason of mental/
other disability, age, or illness, and
• May be unable to take care of him/herself, or
• Is unable to protect him/herself from serious harm/exploitation
If suspected, contact the local social services adult safeguarding lead (with
consent of the individual being harmed if able to give consent).

Fitness to make decisions
Definition Mental capacity is the ability to take actions affecting daily life

(e.g. when to get up, what to wear, what to eat) and/or make more major
decisions (e.g. where to live, how to manage money).

Mental Capacity Act (2005) Came into force in 2007 in England and

Wales. Similar legislation applies elsewhere in the UK. It specifies who can
take decisions on behalf of other people and allows people to plan ahead
for a time when they may lack capacity. Five key principles:
• Every adult has the right to make decisions and must be assumed to
have capacity to make them unless proved otherwise
• Every adult must be given all possible help and support to make
decisions, and to communicate those decisions where necessary,
before he/she can be assumed to have lost capacity
• Making an unwise decision does not mean that a person lacks capacity
to make that decision
• Anything done or any decision made on behalf of someone who lacks
capacity must be done in his/her best interests
• Anything done or any decision made on behalf of someone who lacks
capacity should be the least restrictive of his/her basic rights/freedoms

Assessing capacity A GP asked to give an opinion on a patient’s
mental capacity should:
•	Have access to the patient’s records and ideally know the patient
• Seek information from friends, relatives, carers, and/or the patient’s
independent mental capacity advocate, if one has been appointed
• Examine the patient and assess the type and degree of deficit
• Decide if there is an impairment of, or disturbance in, the functioning
of the patient’s brain or mind
• If there is a disturbance, decide if the patient is able to make the
particular decision in question—in particular:
• Can the patient understand the relevant information, including the
likely consequences of making/not making that decision?
• Can the patient retain that information?
• Can the patient use or weigh that information as part of the
process of making the decision?
• Can the patient communicate that decision by any means?
• Decide if assessment should be postponed while measures are taken
to improve capacity
• Record all the above information
0 Even if you think a proposed action is in the patient’s best interests,
you must not judge the patient capable if that is not clearly the case. If in
doubt, seek a second opinion.

Capacity to consent to medical treatment b p. 53
Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) Replaced Enduring Power of
Attorney (EPA) in October 2007. Patients with EPAs can still use them. An
LPA is a legal document that lets individuals appoint someone they trust to
make decisions for them. It can be drawn up at any time whilst the person

Fitness to make decisions

has capacity but has no legal standing until it is registered with the Office
of the Public Guardian. Two types:
• Property and affairs LPA Allows the ‘attorney’ to make decisions
about the management of money, property, and affairs. Unless specified
otherwise, can be used even when the individual retains capacity
• Personal welfare LPA Allows the ‘attorney’ to make decisions about
healthcare and welfare, including decisions to refuse or consent to
treatment, and decide on place of residence. Only active when the
LPA is registered and the individual lacks capacity to make decisions.
The attorney can make decisions about life-sustaining treatment only if
the LPA specifies that

Court of Protection If a person, by reason of mental disorder,

becomes incapable of managing his or her affairs but has not previously
signed an LPA, it may be necessary for someone, usually the nearest
relative, to apply to the Court of Protection for the appointment of a
‘receiver’ to do so. The medical practitioner will be asked to complete
form CP3. Alternatively, if the patient’s affairs are simple (e.g. state
pension), direct arrangements can be made with relevant authorities.

Testamentary capacity The capacity to make a will. Anyone can

make a will provided that they understand the nature and effect of making
a will, extent of property being disposed of and claims others may have
on that property, and the decision is not the result of their condition (e.g.
due to a delusion).
0 Decisions do not have to seem rational to others, especially if consistent with pre-morbid personality.

Advance decision Statement about wishes regarding medical
treatment in case the individual becomes incapable of making that decision
later. Advance decisions are legally binding.
• Respect any refusal of treatment as long as the decision is clearly
applicable to circumstances, there is no reason to believe the individual
has altered that decision, and the decision was not made under duress
• Advance decisions do not have to be written, except those refusing
life-sustaining treatment which must be: specific to a particular
treatment (e.g. refusal to have CPR); written; signed by the person
making the decision (or a representative if unable to sign) and a witness
• Advance decisions cannot include decisions about treatment the
person would like, only treatment the person refuses, and cannot
include directions to end the person’s life prematurely
• Doctors may not be willing to carry through an advance directive. In
such cases they should refer the patient to another doctor who is
• The BMA recommends doctors should not withhold ‘basic care’ (e.g.
symptom control), even in the face of a directive which specifies that
the patient should receive no treatment
• Where a formal advance statement is not available, take patients’
known wishes into consideration

Consulting and certification

Certifying fitness to work
Individuals must self-certify for the first 7d of incapacity, then sickness
certification from a GP is needed until the WCA is carried out.

Own occupation test Applies to those claiming Statutory Sick Pay

(SSP) for the first 28wk of illness. The GP assesses if the patient is fit to
do his/her own job.

Work Capability Assessment (WCA) Is carried out by

employment advisers contracted to the Department for Work and
Pensions (DWP). It is not diagnosis-dependent and assesses a variety
of different mental/physical health dimensions for ability to work. It is
performed within the first 13wk of any claim for Employment Support
Allowance (ESA) or Universal Credit and applies to:
• Everyone after 28wk incapacity
• Those who do not qualify for the own occupation test from the start
of their incapacity (i.e. do not qualify for SSP)
Initial information All applicants are asked to fill in the ‘Limited capability
for work’ questionnaire which explores how the individual’s medical
problem affects ability to work. Sometimes medical reports from GPs may
be sought by the Department of Work and Pensions at this stage. GPs
have a contractual obligation to complete and return these reports.
Medical examination In the majority of cases, more information will be
needed to be able to assess the claim, and the claimant is then invited for
a face-to-face medical examination assessing mental and physical ability
to work. Groups considered unfit to work without medical examination
include pregnant women, people with severe physical or learning disability,
and those who are terminally ill.
Classification Based on these assessments people may be placed into one
of 3 groups:
• Fit to work
• Work-related activity group, or
• Support group
Those placed in the work-related activity group take part in work-focussed
interviews with personal advisers and are provided with a range of support
to help them prepare for a return to work.
Those placed in the support group have an illness/disability that has a
severe effect on ability to work. They are not expected to take part in any
work-related activity but can choose to do so if they wish.
Appeals Once a decision has been made about ESA/Universal Credit, the
individual’s GP is informed and no further sickness certification is needed.
If the claimant disagrees with the decision, he/she can ask for it to be
reconsidered, and if that fails to alter the decision, can appeal. GPs must
continue sickness certification pending the appeal decision.

Equality Act 2010 An employer has to make ‘reasonable adjustments’
to avoid an employee with an ongoing health problem/disability being put
at a disadvantage (e.g. adjusting working hours or providing equipment).

Certifying fitness to work

Forms for certifying incapacity to work
SC1 Self-certification form for people not eligible to claim SSP who
wish to claim ESA/Universal Credit. Certifies first 7d of illness. Available
from local benefits offices and GP surgeries.
SC2 As SC1 but for people who can claim SSP. Available from
employers, local benefits offices, and GP surgeries.
Med 3: Statement of Fitness for Work Filled in by a GP or hospital
doctor who knows the patient for periods of incapacity likely to be >7d.
Traditionally handwritten but most practices now have the facility to
issue computer generated Med3 forms.
During the first 6mo of incapacity can only be issued for a maximum
period of 3mo. Gives the doctor two options:
• The patient is unfit for work
• The patient may be fit for work—this allows the GP to recommend
circumstances under which the patient may be able to return to
work, e.g with restricted duties or reduced hours
The form gives space for the GP to record the patient’s functional limitations. This is designed to allow the employer to make adjustments to
facilitate the employee’s return to work.
The Statement of Fitness for work may be issued:
• On the day of your assessment of the patient (telephone
consultations are acceptable)
• On a date after your assessment of the patient if you think that it
would have been reasonable to issue a Statement on the day of your
assessment of the patient
• After consideration of a report about the patient from another
doctor or registered healthcare professional
Only one Statement of Fitness for Work can be issued per patient per
period of sickness. If mislaid, reissue, and mark ‘duplicate’.
0 Employers may not request certification that employees ‘need not
refrain from work’—if required, this should be requested as a private
service from an occupational health physician or GP
Mat B1 Signed by doctor or midwife. Provided to pregnant women
once within 20wk of EDD. Enables her to claim statutory maternity pay
and other benefits (b p. 785).

Private certificates Some employers request a private certificate in
the first week of sickness absence. They should request it in writing. If
the GP chooses to provide the service, he or she may charge, both for a
private consultation and the provision of a private certificate. The company
should accept full responsibility for all fees incurred by the patient.

Time off work
131 million working days were lost to sickness in the UK in 2011 costing
>£100 billion. The most common reasons for sickness absence were:
• Musculoskeletal problems (35 million days lost)
• Minor illnesses (27.4 million days lost)
• Stress, depression, and/or anxiety (13.3 million days lost)

Facts and figures
•
•
•
•

Sickness absence i with age; 5 have higher rates than 4
There has been a d in amount of sick leave over the past 20y
16% of sick leave is for >20d, but this accounts for 32% of lost time
The longer someone is not working, the less likely that person is to
return to work; someone who has been off sick for ≥6mo has an 80%
chance of being off work for 5y

Benefits of returning to work Going back to work promotes
recovery, i physical/mental health and well-being, and d social exclusion/
poverty. In contrast, long periods out of work can cause/contribute to:
• i consultation, medication consumption, and hospital admission rates
• 2–3x i risk of poor general health and mental health problems, and
• 20% excess mortality
The role of the GP When someone of working age presents with a
problem that affects ability to work, record a brief occupational history:
• Address the underlying health problem and any personal, psychological,
organizational, or social factors preventing return to work
• Wherever possible, suggest work adjustments where appropriate to
enable a patient to return to work (e.g. graduated work or transitional
arrangements) or instead of signing the patient off work; do this
through the ‘remarks’ section of the Med3 (b p. 125)
• Involve occupational health professionals
Certification of time off work b p. 124

Post-operative time off work See Table 5.2
Time off work for emergencies In many cases, patients have the

legal right to take time off work to deal with an emergency involving
someone who depends on them, but they may only be absent for as long
as it takes to deal with the immediate emergency; employers do not have
to pay for time taken off.
Dependants Include spouse or partner, children, parents, or anyone living
with the patient as part of their family. Others who rely wholly on the
patient for help in an emergency may also qualify.
Emergencies include situations in which a dependant:
• Is ill and needs help
• Goes into labour
• Is involved in an accident or assaulted
•	Needs the patient to arrange their longer term care
•	Needs the patient to deal with an unexpected disruption or
breakdown in care, such as a childminder or nurse failing to turn up
• Dies and the patient must make arrangements/attend the funeral

Consulting and certification

Fitness to drive
• Driving licence holders/applicants have a legal duty to inform the
DVLA of any disability likely to cause danger to the public if they drove.

Driving licence types
• Group 1 Ordinary licence for driving a car/motorcycle. Minimum age
17y (16y if disabled). Old licences expire at 70th birthday and then
must be renewed 3-yearly. Applicants are asked to confirm they have
no medical disability. If so, no medical examination is necessary. New
photocard licences are automatically renewed 10-yearly until age 70y.
• Group 2 Enable holders to drive lorries and buses. Minimum age
21y. Initially valid until 45th birthday then renewable by medical
examination every 5y until 65th birthday. >65y renewable annually.
Applicants must bring form D4 (available from post offices) with them.
Examinations take ~½h. A fee may be charged by the GP
Determining fitness to drive Patients with any disorder which may
cause danger to others if they drove should be advised not to drive and
to contact the DVLA. The DVLA gives advice on when they can restart.

Breaking confidentiality When a patient continues to drive

despite advice by a doctor to stop, a doctor has an obligation to breach
confidentiality and inform the DVLA.
If the patient does not understand the advice to stop driving Inform the
DVLA immediately.
If the patient does understand but continues to drive
• Explain your legal duty to inform the DVLA if the patient does not
stop driving
• If he/she still refuses to stop driving, offer to refer to a colleague for
a second medical opinion—on the understanding that the patient
stops driving in the interim
• If the patient still continues driving—consider action, such as
recruiting the next of kin to the cause (but beware of breach of
confidentiality)
• If all else fails, inform the DVLA in confidence. Before doing this,
write to the patient to inform him/her of your intended actions and
consider contacting your medical defence organization for advice.
Once the DVLA has been informed, you should also write to the
patient to confirm that a disclosure has been made

Conditions affecting fitness to drive b p. 130
Multiple medical conditions Combination of multiple medical

conditions, each insufficient itself to disqualify from driving, may together
render a person unfit/unsafe to drive. If this is the case, advise the patient
not to drive and seek clarification from the DVLA.
Driving after surgery Drivers do not need to notify the DVLA unless
a condition likely to affect safe driving persists >3mo (certain exceptions

Fitness to drive

apply for neurological and cardiovascular disorders). It is the responsibility
of the driver to ensure that he/she is in control of the vehicle at all times. It
might also be advisable for the driver to check with his/her insurer before
returning to drive after surgery. Consider:
• Recovery from anaesthesia (sedation and cognitive impairment)
• Impairment due to analgesia (sedation and cognitive impairment)
• Physical restrictions due to the surgery or the underlying condition

Disabled drivers Who want to learn to drive or return to driving
following onset of their disability should have an assessment of their
driving ability and/or advice on controls and adaptations needed. Licences
may be limited to adapted vehicles. A list of driving assessment centres
can be obtained from the Forum of Mobility Centres F 0800 559 3636
M www.mobility-centres.org.uk
• Impairment due to medication
It is an offence to drive/attempt to drive whilst unfit through drugs; the
law does not distinguish between illegal/prescribed drugs. GPs prescribing/dispensing medication that may affect ability to drive safely should
advise their patients of that risk.

Visual acuity Drivers must be able to read in good light (with glasses

or contact lenses) a number plate containing ­figures 79mm high and 57mm
wide at a distance of 20.5m (20m where the characters are 50 mm wide).
In addition, Group 2 drivers must have corrected vision of ≥6/9 (best eye)
and ≥6/12 (other eye); they should stop driving if uncorrected acuity in
either eye is <3/60.
Visual field defects and diplopia If drivers develop diplopia or are found
to have a visual field defect, they should stop driving and inform the DVLA.
Group 1 licence holders may be able to drive if patching or lenses control
diplopia or are able to meet DVLA criteria for field defects.
Seat belt exemption GPs can sign a form to exempt patients (e.g. those
with colostomies) from having to wear a seat belt. Consider very carefully the
reasons for exemption in view of the weight of evidence in favour of seat belts.

Fitness for other activities
Fitness to fly Passengers are required to tell the airline at the time
of booking about any conditions that might compromise their fitness to
fly. The airline’s medical officer must then decide whether to carry them.
Hazards of flying
• Cabin pressure—oxygen levels are lower than at ground level and gas
in the body cavities expands 30% in flight
• Inactivity and dehydration
• Disruption of routine
• Alcohol consumption
• Stress and excitement
Contraindications to flying
• Respiratory disease
• Suspected pneumothorax/pneumomediastinum—patients should
not fly for 14d after complete resolution of pneumothorax
• Chronic lung disease—if a patient can walk >50m or climb a single
flight of stairs without significant breathlessness, he/she should
be fit to fly. Supplementary oxygen can be provided in flight for
patients unable to walk this far but the patient must pre-book this
with the airline and there is usually a fee
• Heart disease Patients should not travel if they have unstable angina,
poorly controlled heart failure, or an uncontrolled arrhythmia, Patients
should also refrain from travelling <10d after uncomplicated MI
(3–4wk if complicated recovery) and for 3–5d after angioplasty
• Thrombo-embolic disease Patients should not travel with a DVT
before established on anticoagulants
• Neurological disease Patients should not travel for 3d after stroke, or,
if epileptic, <24h after a grand mal fit
• Infectious disease Patients must not travel with untreated infectious
disease
• Psychiatric illness Patients should not travel if they have disturbed or
unpredictable behaviour that could disrupt the flight
• Fractures Flying is restricted for 24–48h (depending on the length of
the flight) after the plaster cast has been fitted
• Haematological disease Anaemia (<7.5g/dL) and recent sickling crisis
may restrict flying
• Pregnancy Most airlines will not carry women >36wk pregnant (third
trimester if multiple pregnancy) or with history of premature delivery,
cervical incompetence, bleeding, or i uterine activity
• Ear problems Flying with otitis media or sinusitis can result in pain
± perforation of the ear drum. Patients are advised not to fly until
symptoms resolve
• Babies <2d old should not fly (preferably <7d old)
• Surgery Patients should not travel <10d after surgery to the chest,
abdomen, or middle ear. Any other procedure where gas is introduced
into the body also needs careful consideration

Fitness for other activities

Precautions
• Carry all regular medication especially relief medications (e.g.
salbutamol, GTN spray) in the cabin
• For people who have to time their medication carefully keep to the
times that medication was taken at home for duration of flight, e.g. for
patients with DM—take snacks to eat and take insulin at normal times
• Drink plenty of liquid (non-alcoholic) to prevent dehydration
• Do calf exercises/get up and walk up and down at intervals to prevent
venous stasis in the legs—those at risk of venous thrombo-embolism
should wear compression stockings for the flight
• Pre-warn airlines of special needs so that they can accommodate them,
e.g. extra leg room, special diet, oxygen in-flight, transport to and from
the aeroplane

Fitness to perform sporting activities b p. 500
Pre-employment certification It is becoming increasingly common

for GPs to be asked about the ‘medical’ suitability of candidates to perform
a job. This is not part of the GP’s terms of service and therefore a GP can
refuse to give an opinion. In all cases where an opinion is given, a fee can
be claimed. Common examples are:
• Forms for childminders
• Care home staff—proof of ‘physical and mental fitness’
• Food handlers—certificates of fitness
• Remember—signing a form may result in legal action against you
should the patient NOT be fit to undertake an activity.
Where possible, include a caveat, e.g. ‘based on information available
in the medical notes, the patient appears to be fit to . . ., although it is
impossible to guarantee this.’
If unsure, consult your local LMC or medical defence organization for
advice.

dies or is cured by nature’

John Taylor (1694–1761)

At any one time, 70% of the UK population is taking medicines. Three
quarters of people >75y are taking prescribed medicines, and 36% of
older people take ≥4 different medications on a regular basis. 1.7 million
prescriptions are dispensed daily within the NHS to prevent illness, cure
existing illness, and give symptomatic relief, costing >£8.2 billion/y (>10%
NHS costs).
Prescribing forms a major part of any GP’s workload. Bad prescribing
wastes resources, deprives patients from a chance to benefit, and may
cause illness. Medicines should be prescribed only when necessary, and, in
all cases, benefits of prescribing should be weighed against risks.
0 Currently, only patients in England pay prescription charges. There are
no prescription charges in Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland.

Prescription pre-payment certificate (PPC) If not entitled to

free prescriptions (see Table 6.1) but needing a lot of medication (>3
prescriptions/3mo or >13/y), it is cheaper for a patient to purchase a
‘pre-payment certificate’.
There are 3 ways to purchase a PPC:
• Internet M www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/HealthCosts
• Telephone F 0300 330 1341
• From a pharmacy registered to sell PPCs. List available at
M www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/HealthCosts
Refunds Send the NHS Business Services Authority a letter explaining the
reason for refund to: NHS Business Services Authority, PPC Issue Office,
152 Pilgrim Street, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, NE1 6SN.
• Full refund May be claimed if; <1mo after purchase the holder
becomes entitled to free prescriptions or dies
• Partial refund May be claimed if the holder dies >1mo after issue or if
the holder becomes entitled to free prescriptions 1–4mo after issue
Reclaiming money spent whilst awaiting an exemption certificate or
PPC Ask for an official receipt at the pharmacy when the drug is paid for
(FP57 England). Claim money back within 3mo.

Drugs cheaper over-the-counter (OTC) Many drugs commonly
prescribed in primary care (e.g. paracetamol, topical steroid nasal sprays,
oral antihistamines, ibuprofen) are cheaper than a prescription charge to
buy OTC. Before prescribing for patients who pay prescription charges
always consider:
• Is this medication available to purchase OTC?
• Would it be cheaper to buy OTC in the quantities required?

Writing prescriptions
• Legal responsibility for prescribing lies with the person who signs the
prescription form.

British National Formulary (BNF) Contains a list of all drugs that

a registered medical practitioner can prescribe on NHS prescription. It
does not include homeopathic drugs which can be prescribed on NHS
prescription, nor aids and appliances. There is a separate but linked BNF
concerned with prescribing for children. Dentists and nurses have their
own limited formulary.
Further information
BNF M www.bnf.org

Claiming for items dispensed by a non-dispensing GP All

GPs may claim payment for dispensing certain items that are supplied
and personally administered by the GP or practice staff on behalf of the
GP. Claims are made on form FP10 (GP10) to the PPA and must state
the name of the patient, item dispensed, and manufacturer of the item.
Claimable items are:
• Diagnostic reagents
• Skin closing strips
• Vaccines
• Pessaries that are
• IUCDs
• Anaesthetics
appliances (e.g. ring
• Contraceptive
• Injections
pessary)
caps/diaphragms
• Sutures
0 Different arrangements apply for high volume vaccines, e.g. influenza.

Prescription writing NHS prescriptions are written on form FP10

(GP10 in Scotland). They should be legible and in indelible ink. They are
valid for 13wk from the date written on them. Include:
• Patient details—full name, address, and age/date of birth if <12y
• Date
• Full name of the drug (not abbreviated), with quantity to be supplied
and dose interval (avoid the use of decimal points, e.g. for quantities
<1g, write in mg). If you want a description of the drug included on the
label, then write it on the prescription (e.g. ‘for asthma’)
• Deletion of any unused space (e.g. by striking through)
• Signature of the prescriber in ink
• Name and address of the prescriber
0 Special rules apply for controlled drugs—b p. 151.

Computer-issued prescriptions (form FP10(C)) Should contain

the same information as their handwritten equivalents. They must still be
signed in ink by the responsible clinician.
Guidelines are available from the Joint Computing Group of the GPC and
RCGP (a summary is available in the BNF M www.bnf.org).

Writing prescriptions

Non-NHS prescriptions The same rules apply to the writing of private prescriptions as NHS prescriptions but private prescriptions should
not be written on FP10 forms (normally headed notepaper is used). There
are no restrictions upon which drugs can be prescribed.
Private prescriptions for controlled drugs Controlled drugs in Schedules
2 and 3 (including temazepam) presented for dispensing in the community
(but not in hospitals) must be written on specially designated forms
available from local PCOs. These forms must include the prescriber’s
unique 6-digit identification number issued ­specifically for their private
prescribing activity.

Nurse prescribers (BNF—Appendix NPF) There is a list of prepara-

tions approved by the Secretary of State which may be prescribed on form
FP10P (form HS21(N) in Northern Ireland, form GP10(N) in Scotland,
forms FP10(CN) and FP10(PN) in Wales) by nurses for NHS patients.
Nurses who have undergone additional training can prescribe from the
nurse prescribers’ extended formulary list.

Dentists (BNF—Appendix DPF) Can prescribe medication for dental
conditions to their NHS patients on form FP10(D) (GP14 in Scotland).
Emergency supply of medicines by pharmacists In emergency
situations pharmacists can dispense prescription-only medicines (POM). In
general ≤5d supply can be dispensed.
Patient information Since 1994, all newly licensed/relicensed med-

icines dispensed in an original pack must be accompanied by a patient
information leaflet (PiL). Despite the fact most drugs are now supplied
with PiLs, doctors should make patients aware of ‘substantial or special
risks when offering treatment’. How much information to give is unclear.
Information regarded as important by patients is: name of the drug; what
to do if a dose is missed; purpose of treatment; precautions (e.g. effect on
driving); when and how to take the medicine; problems with alcohol and
other drugs; unwanted effects and what to do about them.

Security of prescriptions Prescription theft and fraud are common and wastes valuable NHS resources. Basic precautions:
• Prescriptions Should not be left unattended at reception desks;
should not be left in a car where they might be visible; and when
not in use should be kept in a locked drawer both at the surgery
and at home
• Writing prescriptions Draw a diagonal line over the blank part of
the form under the prescription; write the quantity in words and
figures for drugs prone to abuse (even if not controlled drugs);
make alterations clear and unambiguous and add your initials against
any altered items
If prescription fraud is suspected F 0800 028 40 60.

Medicines and prescribing

Cost-effective prescribing
Generic prescribing Use of generic names when prescribing is one
of the simplest ways to d cost of drugs to the NHS but only 63% drugs
prescribed by GPs in the UK are prescribed generically.

Every marketed drug has a chemical name, generic name, and a proprietary or brand name. For as long as the drug’s patent is valid, the company
that developed the drug will derive income from prescription whatever
the name on the prescription. Once the patent has expired, competitors
can manufacture the drug and market it under its generic or an alternative
brand name. If the drug is prescribed generically, the pharmacist decides
which brand to supply and market forces drive price d.
Advantages of generic prescribing Cost d, professional convenience (there
are often several brand names for one drug—using generic names everyone
knows they are talking about the same thing), i convenience to the patient
(pharmacists do not stock each brand of a given drug and, if prescribed by
brand name, may have to order a supply—usually generic preparations of all
commonly used drugs are available).
Reasons not to prescribe generically
• Drugs with a low therapeutic index, e.g. lithium, carbamazepine,
phenytoin, ciclosporin—dosage is carefully titrated against plasma
concentration or response. Small differences in plasma concentrations
can be clinically significant
• Modified-release formulations, e.g. diltiazem, nifedipine,
aminophylline, or theophylline products. Composition and
pharmacokinetic properties are very difficult to standardize
• Formulations containing ≥2 drugs Some do have generic names (e.g.
co-amilofruse 5/40)—others do not. Do not make up a generic name if
the combination drug does not have one

Evidence-based prescribing Decisions on what to prescribe when,

were, in the past, largely based on guesswork or faith. With the advent
of information from randomized controlled trials and their evaluation
using systematic reviews and other techniques, such decisions can now be
based (at least in part) on scientific evidence. Failure to do this may cause
patients to suffer unnecessary side effects of ineffective drugs, deprive
patients the chance to benefit from effective treatments and waste valuable resources. Sources of information: b p. 74.

NICE b p. 13
Rationing b p. 7
Practice formularies An agreed practice formulary is an effective

way to limit prescribing and costs of prescribing. Compiling a formulary
from scratch is a daunting prospect but there are many formularies available, which can then be modified according to evidence that emerges and
reviewed within a practice (contact PCO prescribing lead). When compiling or reviewing a formulary consider: evidence of efficacy; safety; cost
effectiveness; and local policy.

Cost-effective prescribing

NHS Business Services Authority (NHSBSA) Special Health
Authority which provides a wide range of services to the NHS including:
• Payments to pharmacists for prescriptions dispensed in primary care
• Provision of information on costs and trends in prescribing
• Payments to dentists for work undertaken on NHS contracts and
provision of information on costs of dental care
• Management of the NHS Pension Scheme
• A range of health benefits schemes (Low Income Scheme, Exemption
schemes, pre-payment certificates)
• Administration of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) scheme
• Management of the NHS Injury Benefits Scheme
• Provision of the NHS Protect service
Prescribing information The NHSBSA provides practices with

information on their prescribing via the ePFIP (Electronic Prescribing and
Financial Information for Practices) system. This is available by registration
at M www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/963.aspx. Information can be used to improve
prescribing habits, manage prescribing costs, and produce formularies and
prescribing policies. Four types of report are available.
Practice detailed prescribing information (PDPI) Shows prescribing
amounts and costs broken down, according to the BNF, for each
prescriber in a practice. A new report is created online each time a report
is requested. A data selector allows the user to choose the parameters of
the report, e.g. prescribers, time periods (1–24mo), BNF groups.
Prescribing analysis report Analysis of the practice prescribing during the
reporting period. Produced at both a monthly and quarterly level. The
report shows total level of prescribing trends in prescribing, a breakdown
of prescribing in the 6 highest cost BNF therapeutic groups, the top 20
leading cost drugs in the practice and the top 40 BNF sections by cost in
the practice. Practice prescribing is also compared with last year’s level
and with the PCO and national levels.
Prescribing monitoring document (PMD) Shows the cost of prescribing
to enable management of the drugs element of unified budgets. 2-page
report—the first page is a practice statement (or annual return in March);
the second is an annual profile of cumulative expenditure.

Local comparative practice data The prescribing team from the

PCO can provide comparative prescribing data for practices within its
area. This takes the form of overall data (number of items dispensed, costs)
or can be broken down into specific drug areas. Looking at comparative
data can identify areas in which the practice is over- or under-prescribing
and can highlight expensive drugs being used for which there are cheaper,
equally effective alternatives.

Medicines and prescribing

Medicines management
and concordance
Medicines management Defined as ‘facilitating the maximum ben-

efit and minimum risk for medicines for individual patients’. Encompasses
the way medicines are selected, procured, delivered, prescribed, administered, and reviewed to optimize use. Components are:
• Optimizing a medication regime (right drug at the right time)
• Facilitating adherence to medication, addressing beliefs and fears as
well as physical problems as a result of drugs
• Organizing supply and administration support, such as repeat
dispensing systems
• Providing monitoring and feedback systems

Concordance Is a process of prescribing and medicine taking based
on partnership. Patient concordance (or rather lack of it) is a major challenge in general practice. For drugs to be optimally effective they should
be taken as directed by the prescriber. Concordance sufficient to attain
therapeutic objectives occurs about 50% of the time—1:6 patients take
­medication exactly as directed; 1:3 take medication as directed 80–90% of
the time; 1:3 take medication 40–80% of the time; the remaining 16–17%
take medication as directed <40% of the time. 20% of prescriptions are
never ‘cashed’.
‘White-coat concordance’ Phenomenon in which 90% of patients take
regular medication as directed for a period before a check-up—may mask
effects of non-concordance.
Consequences of non-concordance
• Failure to attain therapeutic targets, e.g. failure to take antihypertensive
medication reduces the possible benefit in terms of stroke reduction
by 30–50%
• Wastage of precious resources (7£250 million worth of medicines
are returned to pharmacies each year for disposal—the true quantity
wasted is many times that)
Causes of non-concordance
• Patient beliefs Strongest predictor of concordance—how natural a
medicine is seen to be, the dangers of addiction and dependence, the
belief that constant use may lead to d efficacy have all been shown to
influence concordance
• Lifestyle choices
• Unpleasant side effects (especially if not pre-warned)
• Inconvenience (e.g. multiple daily dosage regimes—though little
difference between od and bd dosage)
• No perceived benefit
• Information Instructions not understood or poor understanding of the
condition/treatment
• Practical Forgetfulness; inability to open containers

Medicines management and concordance

• Professional
• Doctor–patient relationship (there is a link between patient
satisfaction with the consultation and subsequent concordance)
• Inappropriate prescribing; mistakes in administration/dispensing
Improving concordance 770% patients want to be more involved in
decisions about treatment. Doctors underestimate the degree to which
they instruct and overestimate the degree to which they consult and elicit
their patients’ views. The doctor’s task is, by negotiation, to help patients
choose the best way to manage their problem. Patients are more likely to
be motivated to take medicines as prescribed when they:
• Understand and accept the diagnosis
• Agree with the treatment proposed
• Have had their concerns about the medicines specifically and seriously
addressed

Ways to improve concordance
• Use simple language and avoid medical terms
• Discuss reasons for treatment and consequences of not treating
the condition, ensuring information is tailored, clear, accurate,
accessible, and sufficiently detailed
• Seek the patient’s views on their condition
• Agree course of action before prescribing
• Explain what the drug is, its function, and (if known and not too
complex) its mechanism of action
• Keep the drug regime as simple as possible—od or bd dosing
preferable, especially long term
• Seek the patients’ views on how they will manage the regime within
their daily schedule and try to tie in with daily routine (e.g. take one
in the morning when you get up)
• Discuss possible side effects (especially common or unpleasant side
effects)
• Give clear verbal instructions and reinforce with written instructions
if complex regime, elderly, or understanding of patient is in doubt
• Deal with any questions the patient has
• Repeat information yourself and also ask patients to repeat
information back to you to reinforce information
• If necessary arrange review within short time of starting medicine
to discuss progress or queries, or arrange follow-up by another
member of the primary healthcare team (e.g. asthma nurse to check
inhaler technique 2–3wk after starting inhaler)
• Address further patient questions and practical difficulties at
follow-up
• Monitor repeat prescriptions

Medicines and prescribing

Repeat prescribing
80% of NHS prescriptions are for repeat medication. Good practice is
essential to ensure wastage (>10% of total prescribing costs) is kept to a
minimum. Essential elements are:
• Written explanation of the repeat prescribing process for patients
and carers
• Practice personnel with dedicated responsibility ensure patient recall
and regular medication review
• Agreed practice policies for repeat prescriptions, e.g. duration of
supply; procedure if someone ‘runs out’ but is not authorized to
have more
• Authorization check each time a prescription is signed
• Compliance check for under or over use (prescription frequency)
• Equivalence check all regular prescriptions are for the same duration
of treatment so that prescription requests can be synchronized
• Regular housekeeping keeps records of medication up to date
(including dosage instructions)—particular care is needed after hospital
discharge when medication could have been substantially changed
• Training of practice staff

Review process Invite the patient ± carer. Areas to cover:
• Explain what you want to do in the review and the reasons for it
• Compile a list of all medicines being taken/used including: prescribed
medication; OTC drugs; herbal/homeopathic medicines; illicit drugs;
and medicines borrowed from others. Compare the list of drugs
generated with the prescription record
• Concordance. Find out whether and how medication is taken
• Explore understanding of the purpose of the medication and
consequences of not taking it and how much, how often, when
• Discuss misconceptions/queries
• Ask about side effects
• Review relevant monitoring tests, e.g. TFTs; INR; HbA1c.
• Review practical aspects. Problems ordering/receiving repeat
prescriptions; using medicines, e.g. problems opening containers; with
formulations, e.g. difficulty swallowing tablets; reading labels—can
request large print; remembering to take medication—consider
reminder chart, multi-compartment compliance aid, altering times of
doses to fit in better with daily schedule
• Check necessity and appropriateness of all prescriptions
(see Figure 6.1)

Adverse drug reactions
‘I don’t want two diseases - one nature-made and one doctor-made’
Napoleon Bonaparte, St Helena (1820)

In 5–17% hospital admissions, an adverse drug reaction is implicated. Any
drug may produce unwanted or unexpected effects. Common side effects
are listed in the BNF or drug data sheet but any patient can have an allergic reaction or idiosyncratic response to any drug. The possibility of rare
(<1:5,000) or delayed reactions means that safety of new medicines cannot
be established until they have been used for some time in a large population. A 24h Freefone service is available for information F 0800 100 3352.

Classification
• Type A—Common and relate to the pharmacology of the drug
(e.g. constipation with opioids)
• Type B—Rare, unpredictable, and often serious
Within this classification, reactions may be:
• Allergy Anaphylaxis, allergic rash
• Toxic effect, e.g. ataxia with carbamazepine if dose is too high
• Predictable Well-recognized side effect, e.g. dry mouth with
amitriptyline, GI bleeding with aspirin
• Idiosyncratic Unpredictable and unique to the individual

Defective medicines A medicine which does not conform to its
specification is deemed defective. Report suspected defective medicines,
with as much detail as possible on the product and nature of the defect,
to: dmrc@mhra.gsi.gov.uk or F 020 3080 6574. There is an online reporting form and further information available at: M www.mhra.gov.uk.
Suspected adverse reactions Any suspected adverse reaction to

any therapeutic agent, whether OTC, herbal/alternative medication,
or prescribed by a doctor, should be reported to the Medicines and
Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA, CHM Freepost, London
SW8 5BR). Forms (‘Yellow cards’) are available from that address or in
the back of the BNF. Alternatively, report online at M yellowcard.mhra.
gov.uk.
• For new drugs (marked  in BNF). Doctors are asked to report all
reactions whether or not causality is clear
• For established drugs Doctors are asked to report all reactions
in children; and all serious suspected reactions even if the effect is
well documented (e.g. anaphylaxis, blood disorders, renal or liver
impairment, drug interactions). Well-known, relatively minor side
effects (e.g. constipation with opioids, insomnia with SSRIs) should not
be reported

Adverse drug reactions

Prevention of adverse reactions
• Never use a drug unless there is a good indication
• Always ask patients if they have had reactions previously to a drug
before prescribing
• Ask about other drugs patients are taking (including self-medication);
consider interactions
• Consider the effects of age and hepatic or renal impairment
• Prescribe as few drugs as possible—the more drugs, the more
likelihood of interactions
• Give clear instructions about how to take the drug
• Wherever possible use drugs you are familiar with; if using a new
drug be alert to side effects
• Warn patients about potentially serious side effects (e.g. risk of GI
ulceration with NSAIDs)

Consumer Protection Act (1987) If a patient is damaged by a

defective product, liability falls on the producer unless outside the EC
when it falls on the importer. If the importer cannot be identified, liability
falls on the supplier. This is important for GPs. Those who dispense are
at greatest risk but all GPs occasionally supply drugs in an emergency or
for procedures within the surgery (vaccinations, minor surgery, contraception). Always record manufacturer, batch number, and expiry date when
using such drugs and keep records of storage of drugs and maintenance
of equipment.

Licensing
In the UK, the Medicines Act (1968) makes it essential for anyone who
manufactures or markets a drug for which therapeutic claims are made to
hold a licence. The Licensing Authority, working through the Medicines
and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), can grant both
Manufacturer’s Licence and Marketing Authorization (which allows a company to market and supply a product for specified indications). Although
doctors usually prescribe according to the licensed indications, they are
not obliged to.

Prescribing outside licence There may be occasions when a doctor
feels it is necessary to prescribe outside a drug’s licence.
• Generic formulations for which indications are not described. The
prescriber has to assume the indications are the same as for branded
formulations
• Use of well-established drugs for proven but not licensed
indications, e.g. amitriptyline for neuropathic pain
• Use of drugs for conditions where there are no other treatments
(even if the evidence of their effectiveness is not well proven) This
often occurs in secondary care when new treatments become
accepted. GPs may become involved if a patient is discharged to the
community and the GP asked to continue prescribing. 0 The person
signing the prescription is legally responsible
• Use of drugs for individuals not covered by their licensed
indications Frequently occurs in paediatrics

• Before prescribing any medication (whether within or outside the
licence) weigh risks against benefits. The more dangerous the medicine
and the flimsier the evidence base for treatment, the more difficult it is
to justify the decision to prescribe.
When prescribing licensed drugs for unlicensed indications, it is important
to inform patients and carers of what you are doing and why. Explain that
the patient information leaflet (PiL) will not have information about the
use of the drug in these circumstances. Record in the patients notes your
reasons for prescribing outside the licensed indications for the drug.

Clinical trials Drug discovery and development is a protracted process

(>10y) costing huge sums of money (8£100 million). Clinical testing is
conventionally divided into five stages:
• Phase I trials clinical pharmacology in normal volunteers
• Phase II trials preliminary small-scale studies
• Phase III trials large-scale trials (several thousands of patients often).
Once complete application is made for a licence to sell the drug
• Phase IV trials post-marketing surveillance—large-scale follow-up of
patients using the drug to establish evidence long-term efficacy and
safety
• Phase V trials further trials to compare efficacy and safety with other
marketed compounds and explore new indications

Licensing

GPs are unlikely to be involved before phase III. Taking part in trials can
benefit both patients and the practice but consider proposals carefully
before embarking on a project.

Controlled drugs
Misuse of Drugs Act (1971) Controls manufacture, supply, and pos-

session of controlled drugs. Penalties for offences are graded according to
perceived harmfulness of the drug into three classes:
• Class A, e.g. cocaine, diamorphine (heroin), methadone, LSD, ecstasy
• Class B, e.g. oral amphetamines, barbiturates, cannabis, codeine
• Class C, e.g. most benzodiazepines, androgenic and anabolic steroids

Misuse of Drugs Regulations (2001) Defines persons authorized to

supply and possess CDs while carrying out their professions and describes
the way this is to be done. Five schedules of drug are defined:
• Schedule 1 Drugs not used for medicinal purposes, e.g. LSD.
Possession and supply are prohibited except with special licence
• Schedule 2 Drugs subject to full CD controls (written dispensing
record, kept in locked container, CD prescription regulations), e.g.
diamorphine, cocaine, pethidine
• Schedule 3 Partial CD controls (as Schedule 2, but no need to keep
a register—some drugs subject to safe custody regulations), e.g.
barbiturates, temazepam, meprobamate, buprenorphine
• Schedules 4 and 5 Most benzodiazepines, anabolic and androgenic
steroids, HCG, growth hormone, codeine. Controlled drug
prescription requirements do not apply nor do safe custody
requirements
0 Preparations in Schedules 2 and 3 are identified throughout the British
National Formulary (BNF) by the symbol CD (controlled drug).

Controlled drugs register All healthcare professionals who hold

personal stock of any Schedule 2 drugs must keep their own controlled
drugs register, and they are personally responsible for keeping this accurate and up to date. Out-of-date drugs should be recorded and destroyed
in the presence of an authorized witness (police, PCO official).

Prescriber’s responsibilities If prescribing controlled drugs for

medicinal purposes, you have a responsibility:
• To avoid creating dependence by unnecessarily introducing
controlled drugs to patients
• For careful monitoring to ensure the patient does not gradually i the
dose of drug to a point where dependence becomes more likely
• To avoid being an unwitting source of supply for addicts. If you
suspect an addict is going round surgeries with intent to obtain
supplies, contact your PCO so that they can issue a warning to other
practices

Writing prescriptions for CDs Any prescription for Schedules 2

and 3 controlled drugs (with the exception of temazepam) must contain
the following details written so as to be indelible:
• The patient’s full name, address, and age—if the patient is homeless,
‘no fixed abode’ is an acceptable address
• The patient’s NHS (in Scotland, Community Health Index) number
• Name and form of the drug, even if only one form exists
• Strength of the preparation and dose to be taken
• The total quantity of the preparation, or the number of dose units, to
be supplied in both words and figures, e.g. ‘Morphine sulfate 10mg
(ten milligram) tablets, one to be taken twice daily. Supply 60 (sixty)
tablets, total 600 (six hundred) milligrams’
• Signature of the prescriber (must be handwritten) and date. It is good
practice to include the GMC number of the prescriber as well
• The address of the prescriber

Schedules 2, 3, and 4 should be limited to a supply of ≤30d treatment.
The validity period of NHS and private prescriptions for Schedules 1, 2,
3, and 4 controlled drugs is restricted to 28d. Schedules 2 and 3 drugs
should not be prescribed on repeat prescriptions or under repeat dispensing schemes.

Travelling abroad with controlled drugs For patients or doctors
travelling abroad with Schedules 2 or 3 drugs, an export licence may be
required. Further details are available from M www.gov.uk/travellingcontrolled-drugs. Patient applications to the Home Office for an import/
export licence for a CD must be accompanied by a supporting letter from
the prescribing doctor stating:
• The patient’s name and address
• The quantities of drugs to be carried
• The strength and form in which the drugs will be dispensed
• The country of destination
• The dates of travel to and from the UK
For clearance to import the drug into the country of destination, it is
advisable to contact the Embassy or High Commission of that country
prior to departure

Prescribing for special groups
Borderline substances (BNF Appendix 2 M www.bnf.org) For cer-

tain conditions, foods and toilet products can be regarded as drugs and
prescribed on NHS prescription (e.g. gluten-free foods for coeliac disease,
nutritional supplements for disease-related malnutrition). The Advisory
Committee on Borderline Substances advises on which products are available for certain specified conditions. Products should not be prescribed
for any other condition. Use form FP10 (GP10 in Scotland) and endorse
with the letters ‘ACBS’.

Renal impairment Renal function d with age but may not be reflected
by raised creatinine due to d muscle mass. Always assume mild to moderate renal failure if prescribing for the elderly. Renal impairment can change
the effects of drugs by:
• Inability to excrete the drug May cause toxicity. Dose reduction or
increase in interval between doses may be necessary
• Increased sensitivity to drugs (even if elimination is unimpaired)
• Poor tolerance of side effects Nephrotoxic drugs may have more
serious side effects
• Lack of effectiveness When renal function is reduced

Degree of renal impairment Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR),
based on serum creatinine, age, gender, and ethnic origin, is now provided
to GPs when renal function tests are done.
• Mild renal impairment eGFR 60–89mL/min/1.73m2
• Moderate renal impairment eGFR 30–59mL/min/1.73m2
• Severe renal impairment eGFR <30mL/min/1.73m2
Further information BNF Guidance on prescribing: prescribing in renal
impairment M www.bnf.org; patients on dialysis—consult local renal unit.

Hepatic impairment Problems do not tend to arise until late stages of
liver failure when there is jaundice, ascites, or evidence of e­ ncephalopathy.
Problems are due to:
• Impaired drug metabolism Many drugs are metabolized by the liver.
In severe liver failure dose may need to be d ± dosage interval i.
A few drugs are excreted in the bile unchanged and may accumulate in
patients with obstructive jaundice (e.g. rifampicin, fusidic acid)
• Hypoproteinaemia Liver failure is associated with d plasma protein.
This affects binding of drugs. Highly protein-bound drugs (e.g.
phenytoin, prednisolone) can become toxic in normal dosage
• Hepatotoxicity Liver toxicity will have i effect if hepatic reserve is
already d
• Clotting Blood clotting factors are made in the liver. In liver disease
effects of oral anticoagulants are i
• Encephalopathy Drugs that depress cerebral function (e.g benzo­
diazepines, opioids) can precipitate encephalopathy if severe liver failure
• Fluid retention Drugs causing fluid retention (e.g. NSAIDs) make
oedema and ascites worse

Breastfeeding Drugs taken by a mother breastfeeding can affect the
child by inhibiting lactation or entering the milk and causing toxicity to the
infant. Therapeutic doses in the mother can cause toxicity in the infant if
the drug is concentrated in milk (e.g. iodides). Avoid prescribing, wherever
possible. Stick to tried and tested drugs (see BNF Guidance on prescribing:
prescribing in breast feeding M www.bnf.org).

Prescribing for children

•

• Keep all medicines out of the reach of children (and,
preferably, in a locked cupboard). Dispose of unwanted
medicines by returning them to a pharmacy for destruction.
Children differ from adults in their response to drugs. Consult the
BNF for Children or Paediatric Vade Mecum before prescribing
unfamiliar drugs. Always check doses carefully. Many drugs are not
licensed for use with children
Paediatric suspensions often contain sugar. For long-term use or
children having frequent prescriptions, consider sugar-free versions

Medicines and prescribing

Complementary medicine
In the UK, 790% of the population have tried complementary or alternative medicine (CAM) at some time (see Table 6.2). But, although CAM
undoubtedly helps many individuals, its use remains controversial.

Reasons for caution Lack of:
• Evidence of effectiveness There are many anecdotal reports and
small-scale observational studies of +ve effects of complementary
therapies, but large-scale, high-quality studies tend to be –ve
• Regulation of practitioners At present, anyone can set up as a
practitioner of alternative medicine. Regulation has been proposed and
is likely to come into force over the next few years. Until then, it is
important to find a reputable practitioner with accredited training who
is a member of a recognized professional body. It is also important to
ensure any practitioner used carries professional indemnity insurance
• Regulation of products At present, most complementary ‘medicines’
are sold as foods rather than medicines and do not hold a product
licence. No licensing authority has assessed efficacy, safety, or
quality and interactions with conventional medicines are unknown.
Complementary medicines can, and do, cause adverse effects—just
because they are natural does not mean they are safe
Legal position of GPs
Practising complementary medicine Conventionally trained doctors can
administer alternative treatments. The ‘Bolam test’ applies—in other
words, if a doctor has undergone additional training in a complementary
discipline and practises in a way that is reasonable and would be considered
acceptable by a number of other medically qualified complementary
practitioners, his or her actions are defensible.
Referring to complementary medicine practitioners
• Delegation to non-medically qualified practitioner Ask:
• Is my decision to delegate to this complementary therapy appropriate?
Evidence-based decisions are most persuasive; commonly accepted
but unproven indications are also acceptable
• Have I taken reasonable steps to ensure that the practitioner is
qualified and insured? Usually sufficient to ensure he/she is a
member of the main professional regulatory body responsible for
that discipline. Main bodies require members to be fully indemnified
• Has my medical follow-up been adequate? Continue following up
chronic conditions as usual. Do not issue repeat prescriptions
without having sufficient information to ensure safe prescribing
• Referral to a medically qualified practitioner/state registered
osteopath or chiropractor Same legal situation as when referring to
another conventional healthcare practitioner. As long as the decision
to make the referral is appropriate (see Delegation to non-medically
qualified practitioner above), all further responsibility is taken over by
the practitioner providing the service

Therapy

Features

Acupuncture

Needles are used to alleviate symptoms or cure disease
Mechanism of action remains unclear. Two broad forms:
• Traditional acupuncture Based on Chinese medicine where
health is a balance between ying and yang. Illness is imbalance,
and treatment aims to restore balance
• Modern acupuncture Uses modern anatomy and physiology
Evidence: mixed—good evidence that effective for back pain,
idiopathic headache, and migraine; knee pain; and post-operative
nausea/vomiting
Variants: auriculotherapy; transcutaneous electrical nerve
stimulation (TENS); reflexology

Homeopathy From the Greek, meaning ‘treatment of similars’. Works on the
principle that like cures like. A remedy is chosen that mimics the
symptoms displayed by the patient. Most remedies are serially
diluted in steps of 1:10 (decimal x) or 1:100 (centesimal c).
Manufacture is controlled by the Medicines Act
Evidence: with higher dilutions (>12c), a theoretical problem arises
as the solution may not contain any molecules of the mother
substance. However, meta-analysis suggests that overall effective
Herbal
medicine

Use of plants for medicinal purposes. Although traditional
medicine uses many plant extracts (e.g. digoxin, morphine), herbal
medicine uses plant extracts and not isolated constituents. All
herbal medicines must be registered in order to be sold in the UK
Evidence: there is evidence of effectiveness of many herbal remedies,
including: saw palmetto (benign prostatic hyperplasia); echinacea
(common cold); St John’s wort (depression); feverfew (migraine)
Variants: aromatherapy is the use of concentrated aromatic plant
oils. No good evidence of effectiveness. Oils commonly used include,
lavender oil (insomnia, burns, blisters); tea tree oil (skin infection;
head lice); peppermint oil (indigestion); valerian oil (anxiety, insomnia)

Dietary
Healing foods Are commonly used, e.g. cranberry juice for UTI;
manipulation soya to d menopausal symptoms; ginger to d nausea
Nutritional medicine Involves giving supplements of vitamins,
minerals, amino acids, or essential fatty acids. There is some evidence
of effectiveness, e.g. glucosamine for OA; calcium and vitamin D
supplements for d osteoporosis; vitamin B6 for premenstrual tension
Probiotics Orally administered microbial cell preparations. Some
evidence of effectiveness for treatment of gastrointestinal conditions
Environmental medicine Based on the premise that individuals
develop intolerances to environmental substances—most
commonly foods. Exclusion diets improve symptoms. The most
common culprits are caffeine, milk, gluten, and citrus fruit
Osteopathy & Physical treatments aimed at restoring the alignment of the joints
chiropractic and improving functioning of the body. Already under statutory
regulation. Good evidence of effectiveness, particularly for back pain
Hypnotherapy

Hypnotherapy consists of training the patient to relax very
deeply—often with a focus, a scene, smell, touch sensation, or
colour to aid this process. May be helpful for pain relief

Minor surgery

Providing minor surgery
Minor surgery in GMS practices Under the GMS contract, minor
surgery can be provided as an additional service or directed enhanced
service.
Minor surgery as an additional service
• Includes curettage and cautery and, in relation to warts, verrucae, and
other skin lesions, cryocautery
• In all cases a record of consent of the patient to treatment and a
record of the procedure itself should be kept
• Payment is included within the global sum payment. If a practice does
not want to provide this service, it must ‘opt out’ and global sum
payment is d by 0.6%

Minor surgery as a directed enhanced service Extends the range

of procedures beyond those practices are expected to do as an additional
service. For the purpose of payment, procedures have been divided into
3 groups:
• Injections—muscles, tendons, and joints
• Invasive procedures—including incisions and excisions
• Injections of varicose veins and piles
Payment Treatments are priced according to the complexity of the
procedure, involvement of other staff, and use of specialized equipment.
Terms for this must be negotiated locally. Typical figures are £40 for a
joint injection or £80 for a simple excision.

Minor surgery in PMS practices PMS contracts are negotiated on

an individual basis with the local PCO/CCG. In most cases however, the
contract provides for similar arrangements and payments to those in place
for GMS practices.

Qualification to provide minor surgery Practices can provide
minor surgery as a directed enhanced service if they can demonstrate
they have the necessary facilities and personnel (partner, employee, or
subcontractor) with the necessary skills. This includes:
• Adequate equipment
• Premises compliant with national guidelines as contained in Health
Building Note 46: General Medical Practice Premises (DH)
• Nursing support
• Compliance with national infection control policies—sterile packs
from the local CSSD, disposable sterile instruments, using approved
sterilization procedures, etc.
• Ongoing training in minor surgery, related skills, and resuscitation
techniques
• Regular audit and peer review to monitor clinical outcomes, rates of
infection, and procedure
Location and equipment A suitable room, adequate lighting, the
appropriate equipment, and sufficient uninterrupted time is needed for
successful minor surgery. An experienced assistant is also a great help.
Sterile instruments and gloves and aseptic technique are essential.

Providing minor surgery

• Basic minor surgery sets Usually contain a scalpel; several sizes
of blade (e.g. size 11 and 15); toothed forceps; needle holder; fine
scissors; artery forceps; skin hook; curette
• Additional equipment required Skin preparation liquid (e.g.
chlorhexidine); local anaesthetic (e.g. lidocaine 1%); suitable sized
needles and syringes; sterile towels; swabs; sterile specimen pots;
suture materials and dressings for the wound. For joint injection,
ensure that you have steroid and local anaesthetic drawn up and
suitably sized needles available before starting
1 Always make sure you know how many blades, sutures, needles,
and swabs you have, and ensure that you have accounted for and safely
disposed of them at the end of the procedure.

Consent Patient consent for the procedure must be sought and

recorded in the notes. This involves giving enough information about the
procedure and other possible treatment options to allow the patient to
make an informed decision about whether to proceed; the patient and
consenting doctor should then both sign the consent form and the form
should be filed in the patient’s medical records.

Histological examination All tissue removed by minor surgery
should be sent for histological examination unless there are exceptional
or acceptable reasons for not doing so.
Documentation Maintain full, legible, accurate records. Include:

•
•
•
•

History of the complaint
Examination findings
Diagnosis
Full details of the procedure undertaken—include dose, batch number,
expiry date and quantities of drugs, size and number of sutures, and
• Follow-up arrangements
If the patient is not registered with the practice undertaking the minor
surgery, then a complete record of the procedure must be sent to the
patient’s registered practice for inclusion in the GP notes.

Follow-up and outcome Should be recorded in the patient’s notes.
Advise the patient:
• What to expect after the procedure
• Precautions to take after the procedure
• When to return for suture removal
• Signs that would indicate the need for reconsultation
• About the expected recovery/healing time
Arrange a follow-up appointment for all but the most straightforward
procedures.

chapter 7

Minor surgery

Basic techniques
1 Never attempt a procedure if you are unsure about it—know the
boundaries of your experience and abilities.

Local anaesthesia
• 0.5–2% lidocaine, Xylocaine®, and procaine are the most commonly
used preparations
• Epinephrine (1:200,000) added to local anaesthetic d bleeding and
prolongs anaesthesia, but do not use epinephrine in areas supplied by
end arteries (i.e. fingers, toes, penis, ear, nose)
• The safe maximum dose of local anaesthetic in adults is 20mL of 1%
solution (less in elderly and children)—overdose causes fits or cardiac
arrhythmias
Administering local anaesthetic
• Pre-warn patients local anaesthetic stings before numbing and that
they will still be able to feel pressure—but not pain. If pain is felt more
anaesthetic is needed
• Clean the skin, insert a small needle intradermally, and raise a small
bleb before infusing more deeply
• Always pull back on the syringe plunger before injecting to check that
you are not in a blood vessel
• Anaesthetic must be infused all around the excision site. This may
require several needle insertions—try to do this through an already
numb area to d discomfort for the patient
• Allow time for anaesthetic to take effect (2–5min) before proceeding

Suturing Suture and needle types—b p. 163
•	Various techniques for suturing and knot tying can be used (e.g.
interrupted, continuous, subcuticular)
• Always make a careful record of the number of stitches and when they
should be removed
• Usually, stitches need removal after 3–5d on the face, 7–14d on the
back and legs, and 5–7d elsewhere
• Skin closure strips can be used instead of or in addition to stitches in
some circumstances
Cautery Chemical (silver nitrate) or electrocautery are used alone, or in
combination with other methods (e.g. curettage), to secure haemostasis or
destroy tissue. Suitable conditions: nose bleeds, spider naevi, telangiectasia.
1 Do not use electrical cautery for patients with a cardiac pacemaker.

Implants Subcutaneous implants are prescribed for several conditions

(e.g. prostate cancer). Most implants come pre-packaged with an insertion
cannula and information leaflet—always read and follow the instructions
if administering a new product and ensure position of implant and timing
of administration is correct.

Contraceptive implants b p. 760

Basic techniques

Joint and soft tissue injection Steroids can have a potent local

anti-inflammatory effect and dramatically improve certain musculoskeletal
problems. Most joint injections are straightforward and can be undertaken
within a general practice setting.
General rules
• Always use aseptic technique
• Do not inject if there is local sepsis (e.g. cellulitis) or any possibility
of joint infection
• Never inject into the substance of a tendon—this may cause rupture
(in tenosynovitis steroid is injected into the tendon sheath)
• Injections should not require pressure on the syringe plunger—if so the
needle is probably not correctly located (tennis elbow is an exception)
• Undertake as few injections as possible to settle the problem—often
one is sufficient. If no improvement after 2–3 then reconsider the
diagnosis
• Do no more than 3–4 injections/patient/appointment and no more
than 3–4 in any single joint—more than this i risk of systemic
absorption and joint damage

Preparation for the procedure
• Take a history, make a careful examination and have a clear diagnosis
before considering injecting steroids
• Gather the needles, syringes, a sterile container (for sending aspirated
fluid), steroid, local anaesthetic, skin preparation fluid (e.g. chlorhexidine
or surgical spirit), cotton wool, and adhesive spot plaster beforehand
• The injected joint should be rested for 2–3d afterwards, if possible—
certainly avoid heavy activity. Make sure the patient is comfortable, has
given informed consent, and knows what to expect
Steroid preparations (i order of potency) Hydrocortisone acetate,
methylprednisolone acetate, triamcinolone hexacetonide.
Local anaesthetic (LA) (e.g. lidocaine 1%) can be mixed with the steroid
for some injections—LA effect occurs immediately and lasts 2–4h. The
patient may then experience some return of symptoms (pain) before the
steroid takes effect—warn the patient.
Follow-up
• Some injections are painful at administration—this is normal for tennis
elbow and plantar fasciitis
• Steroid injection may cause temporary flushing and worsening of blood
sugar control in patients with DM
• Severe or increasing pain ~48h after injection may indicate sepsis—
advise the patient to return urgently if this occurs
• If steroid is injected close to the skin surface (as in tennis elbow), skin
dimpling and pigment loss can occur—warn the patient
Most hospital rheumatology departments have a joint injection clinic and
are happy to allow GPs to watch to gain experience

Minor surgery

Removal of skin lesions
Ensure that you have had training in the techniques—learning by experience is much better than from a book. There are many courses available.

Excision of skin lesions
• Gain written consent—ensure you have warned the patient about
the likely size of the scar and the possibility of keloid (especially if the
lesion is on a risk area, e.g. upper back and chest)
• Work out the direction of the skin contour lines, clean and
anaesthetise the area (b p. 160)
• An elliptical incision—73x as long as it is wide—is suitable for most
lesions. Place the incision in the skin contour lines if possible (marking
the incision line can be helpful)
• Cut through the skin at right angles to the surface with a smooth
sweep of the blade
• Use a skin hook to lift the skin from one end of the ellipse
• Use the scalpel blade to remove the skin from the subcutaneous fat
• Save the excised specimen for histology
• Close the wound by carefully apposing the edges (slightly everted)
using interrupted non-absorbable sutures. Avoid tension in the sutures
and knot securely. Large wounds may benefit from the use of deep
absorbable sutures to reduce skin tension

Curettage
• Useful for seborrhoeic warts, pyogenic granuloma, keratoacanthoma,
or single viral warts. Not suitable for naevi
• Use only if the diagnosis is certain—scrapings can be sent for histology
but the architecture of the lesion is lost
• Numb the area with local anaesthetic and remove the lesion with
gentle scooping movements using a curette spoon
• Finally cauterize the base of the lesion

Cryotherapy
• Liquid nitrogen can be used to treat viral and seborrhoeic warts, skin
tags, and solar keratoses
• Local arrangements for delivery of liquid nitrogen differ—often a clinic
session to treat all suitable lesions at the same time is helpful
• If diagnosis is uncertain excise the lesion, or take a biopsy prior to
freezing
• A cotton wool bud or nitrogen spray gun can be used to apply liquid
nitrogen for approximately 10s until a thin frozen halo appears at the
base of the lesion
• A blister forms <24h after treatment—the lesion then falls off with the
blister
• Repeat treatment may be needed after 4wk
Side effects Pain, failure to remove the lesion, skin hypopigmentation,
ulceration of lower leg lesions (especially in elderly patients).

Removal of skin lesions

1 Rules for removing skin lesions
• Only remove benign lesions (unless you have specific training to
excise low-risk BCCs)—refer suspicious lesions to a specialist for
expert management
• Only remove lesions that you are confident you can cope with. Take
special care with lesions on the face or lip margin—the scar may be
very noticeable
• Send all excised lesions for histology—place in formalin and carefully
label with the site and side

Suture types
• Absorbable e.g. catgut, Dexon, Vicryl—used to stitch deep layers to
help d tension
• Non-absorbable e.g. silk, prolene, nylon—used for closure of skin
wounds after minor surgery

Needle types Straight, curved, cutting, or round-bodied. Surgical
site and personal preference dictate which to use—a cutting needle is
usually used for skin.

Suture thickness (gauge) Indicated by a number (10/0 is fine and

2/0 thick). For skin closure: 6/0 or 5/0 is usually used for the face, 3/0 on
legs and back, and 4/0 elsewhere.

chapter 7

Minor surgery

Lower and upper limb injections
The knee Joint effusions are common (e.g. trauma, ligament strains, OA,
RA, gout). Aspirated fluid should be clear/slightly yellow and not purulent.
Send any fluid aspirated for analysis. Aspiration of fluid can:
• Help make a diagnosis, e.g. gout
• Be a therapeutic procedure—draining a tense effusion can relieve pain
• Precede administration of steroids, e.g. RA flare
1 Any sign of infection within the joint prohibits steroid use.
Technique for aspiration and joint injection
• Lie the patient on couch with knee slightly bent—place a pillow under
the knee as this relaxes the muscles
• Palpate the joint space under the lateral or medial edge of the patella
and inject/aspirate just below the superior border of the patella with
the needle horizontal—see Figure 7.1
• Use a green (21 gauge) needle
• If aspirating and then injecting steroids maintain the needle in position
and swap the syringe
• Normal doses of steroid are triamcinolone 20mg or
methylprednisolone 40mg
• In prepatella bursitis aspiration and injection of hydrocortisone 25mg
into the bursa can help settle inflammation

Plantar fasciitis­ Painful area in the middle of the heel pad. Steroid
injection (e.g. triamcinolone 10–20mg) into the most tender spot can help.
Injection hurts, so advise analgesia. Mixing lidocaine 1% with the steroid
can help.
Technique Two methods are commonly used (see Figure 7.2):
• Injection through the tough skin of the sole (more accurate), or
• Lateral approach (less painful)
Rest the foot for several days afterwards and use an in-shoe heel pad.
Rupture of the plantar fascia is a rare complication.

Tenosynovitis Causes pain and stiffness in the line of the tendon and
crepitus over the affected tendon. The most common site is the base
of the thumb (de Quervain’s tenosynovitis). Injecting steroid and LA (e.g.
hydrocortisone 25mg + 1mL 1% lidocaine) into the space between tendon
and sheath can help.
Technique
• Insert the needle along the line of the tendon just distal to the point of
maximum tenderness
• Advance the needle proximally into the tendon (felt as a resistance)
and then slowly withdraw until the resistance disappears. The tip of
the needle is then in the tendon sheath
• It is now safe to inject—the tendon sheath may swell
• Advise the patient to rest the affected area for several days and avoid
the precipitating activity

Minor surgery

Carpal tunnel syndrome Technique:

• Sit the patient with hand resting on a firm surface, palm up. Palmaris
longus tendon can be seen by wrist flexion against resistance
• Insert the needle at the distal skin crease, at 45° to the horizontal,
pointing towards the fingers, just ulnar (little finger) side of the palmaris
tendon (see Figure 7.3). If palmaris longus is absent (10%), inject
between flexor digitorum superficialis and flexor carpi radialis tendons
• Use a green (21 gauge) needle. Advance it to half its length. If sudden
pain in the fingers, you have hit the median nerve—withdraw the
needle and reposition it
• Inject steroid e.g. 10mg triamcinolone—if there is resistance the
needle is not in the right place. Do not use LA as it causes finger
numbness
• Rest the hand for several days afterwards

Elbow Technique for tennis/golfer’s elbow injection:

• Sit the patient with the elbow flexed to 90o
• Palpate the most tender spot and insert the needle into that spot
• Inject 0.1–0.2mL of steroid (e.g. hydrocortisone 25mg/mL). There will
be resistance. Without taking the needle out, move the needle in a fan
shape injecting small amounts of steroid—try to inject all the tender
area. Warn about the possibility of skin dimpling or pigment loss
• Pain of injection may last 48h—warn the patient in advance, advise
resting the arm and analgesia
0 For tennis elbow, steroid injection has significantly better effects in
the short term (~6wk) but poorer outcome long term compared to
physiotherapyR.

Shoulder Injection may help rotator cuff problems, frozen shoulder,
subacromial bursitis, and RA. Use an anterior or posterior approach for
shoulder joint injection and lateral approach for the subacromial space.
Technique: Anterior approach
• Sit patient with the arm relaxed at the side, slightly externally rotate.
• Insert the needle (green, 21 gauge) horizontally into the gap between
the head of humerus and the coracoid process, ensuring the needle is
lateral to the coracoid process—see Figure 7.4(a). Insert the needle
for most of its length to reach the joint space
• Inject 1mL steroid e.g. triamcinolone 20mg + 1mL 1% lidocaine. There
should be no/little resistance to injection—if there is, the needle is
wrongly positioned
Technique: Lateral approach to subacromial space Sit the patient
with arm hanging down to the side. Palpate the posterolateral corner
of the acromion. Insert the needle horizontally into the space under
the acromion—see Figure 7.4(b). Inject 5mL 0.5% bupivacaine +
triamcinolone 20mg.

AC joint injection Can help the pain of OA. Technique:
• Palpate the joint space—insert the needle anteriorly or superiorly—if
you go too far, you may enter the shoulder joint—see Figure 7.4(c)
• Only 0.2–0.5mL can be injected as small joint space. Use a blue
(23 gauge) needle and do not add LA

Prevention and screening
In all disease, the goal is prevention.

Definitions
• Primary prevention Prevention of disease occurrence
• Secondary prevention Controlling disease in early form
(e.g. carcinoma in situ)
• Tertiary prevention Prevention of complications once the disease is
present (e.g. DM)

Barriers to prevention
• Patient Blinkering (‘It’ll never happen to me’); rebellion (‘I know it’s
bad—but it’s cool’); poor motivation (path of least resistance)
• Doctor Time; money—health promotion takes time and personnel;
motivation—health promotion is repetitive and boring
• Society Pressure from big business (e.g. cigarette advertising); other
priorities; ethics (e.g. public uproar at threats not to offer cardiac
surgery to smokers)

Prevention of coronary heart disease b p. 242
Screening The idea of screening is attractive—the ability to diagnose
and treat a potentially serious condition at an early stage when it is still
treatable. An ideal screening test must pick up all those who have the
disease (have high sensitivity) and must exclude those who do not (high
specificity). It must detect only those who have a disease (high positive
predictive value) and should exclude only those who do not have the disease (high negative predictive value). See Table 8.1.
The Wilson–Jungner criteria All screening tests should meet the following
criteria before they are introduced to the target population:
• The condition being screened for is an important health problem
• Natural history of the condition is well understood
• There is a detectable early stage
• Treatment at early stage is of more benefit than at late stage
• There is a suitable test to detect early stage disease
• The test is acceptable to the target population
• Intervals for repeating the test have been determined
• Adequate health service provision has been made for the extra clinical
workload resulting from screening
• Risks, both physical and psychological, are < benefits (see Table 8.2)
• Costs are worthwhile in relation to benefits gained

Performance of screening tests See Table 8.1. For a screening programme
to be effective and d morbidity and mortality there must be:
• Adequate participation of the target population
• Few false-negative or false-positive results
• Screening intervals shorter than the time taken for the disease to
develop to an untreatable stage
• Adequate follow-up of all abnormal results
• Effective treatment at the stage detected by screening
• There is no ideal screening test. Always explain:
• Purpose of screening
• Likelihood of positive/negative findings and possibility of falsepositive/negative results
• Uncertainties and risks attached to the screening process
• Significant medical, social, or financial implications of screening for
the particular condition or predisposition
• Follow-up plans, including availability of counselling and support services
Table 8.2 Benefits and disadvantages of screening
Benefits
• Improved prognosis for some
cases detected by screening
• Less radical treatment for
some early cases
• Reassurance for those with
negative test results
• Increased information on
natural history of disease
and benefits of treatment at
early stage

Disadvantages
• Longer morbidity in cases where
prognosis is unaltered
• Overtreatment of questionable
abnormalities
• False reassurance for those with
false-negative results
• Anxiety and sometimes morbidity for
those with false-positive results
• Unnecessary intervention for those
with false-positive results
• Hazard of screening test
• Diversion of resouces to the
screening programme

Healthy living

Prevention of travel-related illness
Pre-travel assessment 8wk pre-departure where possible. Check:
• Age
•	General health
• Where and when intending to travel (including areas within a country
and stopovers elsewhere)
• Type of accommodation
• Purpose of travel
• Previous experience (including experience with antimalarials)
• Current vaccination status

Health risks
• Environmental hazards (e.g. changes in altitude/climate) Avoid rapid
changes of altitude—take time to readjust; avoid sunburn. Advise women
taking combined hormonal contraception and trekking to altitudes of
>4500m for >1wk to consider an alternative method of contraception
• Accidents Avoid potentially dangerous tasks under the influence of
alcohol, e.g. swimming, driving. Avoid motorbikes—especially without
helmets and protective clothing
• Illness abroad MI causes 61% deaths related to international travel. Do
not travel if unwell. Ensure adequate insurance including repatriation
costs. Take enough supplies of regular medication when travelling to
last the entire trip, and take preventative steps to avoid infection
• Transport related problems
• Fitness to fly: b p. 132
• Motion sickness (take OTC medication if afflicted)
• Jet lag
• DVT—on flights >3h: drink plenty of water, avoid alcohol, regularly
get up and walk around, consider prophylactic support stockings
• Psychological effects of travel

Prevention of travellers’ diarrhoea 50% travellers experience
some diarrhoea. Most cases last 4–5d. 1–2% last >1mo.
• Take care to eat and drink uncontaminated food and water
• Food should be freshly cooked and hot
• Avoid salads and cold meats/fish
• Eat fruit that can be peeled
• Stick to drinks made with boiling water or bottled drinks and water
with an intact seal; avoid ice in drinks
• Use water purification tablets if necessary
Action If diarrhoea occurs when abroad advise patients to use oral
rehydration fluids. Only take antidiarrhoeals if impossible to get to a toilet.
Seek medical advice if blood in stool, fever, or not resolving in 72h (24h
for the elderly or infants).
• Do not use antidiarrhoeals if blood in stool, fever, or <10y old.

Prevention of malariaND
• Awareness of risk High-risk areas are Central and South America;
South East Asia; Pacific islands; sub-Saharan Africa—however brief the
time there. Pregnant and asplenic patients are at particular risk

Prevention of travel-related illness

• d mosquito bites Mosquitoes bite at night
• Accommodation—sleep in screened accommodation spraying
screens with insecticide each evening and use a pyrethroid
vaporizer. If screens are not available use a permethrin-impregnated
bed net (kits are available)
• Person—in the evenings wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers;
protect limbs with diethyl toluamide-containing repellant
• Chemoprophylactic drugs See Table 8.3. Regimes vary with location and
time of year. Information is available via the Travax website (M www.
travax.nhs.uk—registration needed) and travel information clinics
• Awareness of residual risk Chemoprophylaxis is not 100% effective. Advise
all travellers to malaria regions to seek medical advice if unwell for up to
6mo after return. Malaria is a great mimic. Have a high level of suspicion

Prevention of HIV and hepatitis B and C
• Avoid casual sexual contacts. If these occur use barrier methods of
contraception (Femidom®, condoms)
• Avoid shared needles (e.g. tattooing/ear piercing/drugs)
• Medical kits—if travelling to high-risk areas, take a clearly labelled medical
kit containing sutures, syringes, and needles for use in emergencies
• Avoid blood transfusion. Two-thirds blood donations in the developing
world are unscreened. Know your blood group. Have good travel
insurance, including repatriation costs. In an emergency the Blood Care
Foundation can arrange screened blood to be provided anywhere in
the world (F 01403 262652; M www.bloodcare.org.uk)
•	Vaccination for hepatitis B prior to travelling

Vaccination 4% deaths related to travel are due to infectious disease—
ensure fully vaccinated for areas intending to visit. Information is available
from the Travax website (M www.travax.nhs.uk)—registration is needed.

Diet
The role of the GP and primary care team
• Screening Identification of obese patients and patients in need of
dietary advice for other reasons
• Assessment Current diet, motivation, and barriers to change
• Discussion and negotiation Exploration of knowledge about diet;
negotiation of goals
• Goal setting Provide information and 2–3 food-specific goals on
each occasion—set a series of mini-targets that appear realistic and
achievable; tailor them to existing diet and usual schedule
• Monitoring progress

Barriers to a good diet
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Ignorance—posters in surgeries/leaflets may help
Cultural differences—modify information to be relevant
Enjoyment—perception of healthy diet is not enjoyable
Poverty—fresh fruit/vegetables and lean meat/fish are expensive—
some elements are cheap, e.g. potatoes, pasta, rice
Lifestyle—convenience foods contain a lot of salt, sugar, and fat
Peer pressure—children are under pressure to eat sweets, crisps, etc.
Habits of a lifetime—we like the foods we have grown up with
Confusion about what is good—packaging may be misleading, e.g.
breakfast cereals claiming health messages but containing high sugar
Mixed messages—one minute the press says something is good for
you, the next it causes some horrible disease and should be avoided
Fatalism/apathy

The ideal diet See Figure 8.1, b p. 176. Adjust composition/portion
size of each meal to maintain a healthy weight. Include a variety of foods:
• Use starchy foods (e.g. bread, rice, pasta, potatoes) As the main
energy source
• Eat plenty of fruit and vegetables (>5 portions of fruit and/
vegetables/d) Do not overcook vegetables; steaming is preferable to
boiling, and keep the delay between cutting and eating fruit/vegetables
to a minimum
• Eat plenty of fibre Good sources are: high-fibre breakfast cereals,
beans, pulses, wholemeal bread, potatoes (with skins), pasta, rice, oats,
fruit/vegetables
• Eat fish At least 2x/wk. including one portion (max. two portions
if pregnant) of oily fish (e.g. mackerel, herring, pilchards, salmon).
d cooked red or processed meat; consider substituting meat with
vegetable protein (e.g. pulses, soya)
• Choose lean meat Remove excess fat/poultry skin and pour off fat
after cooking; avoid fatty meat products (e.g. sausages, salami, meat
pies); boil, steam, or bake foods in preference to frying; when cooking
with fat use unsaturated oil (e.g. olive, sunflower oil) and use cornflour
rather than butter and flour to make sauces
• Use skimmed milks And low-fat yoghurts/spreads/cheese (e.g. Edam
or cottage cheese)

Diet

• Avoid adding salt to foods. Aim for <6g of salt/d. Avoid processed
foods, crisps, and salted nuts
• Avoid adding sugar and cut down on sweets, biscuits, and desserts
• Drink at least 4–6 pints (2–3L) of fluid daily Preferably not tea,
coffee, or alcohol. Drinking a large glass of water with meals and
instead of snacks can reduce the urge to overeat
• Avoid excessive alcohol intake <21u/wk for men and <14u/wk for
women—b p. 184

Obesity b p. 178
Weight loss Non-specific symptom. Treat the cause. Consider:

• GI causes Malabsorption, malnutrition, dieting
• Chronic disease Hyperthyroidism, DM, heart failure, renal disease,
severe COPD, degenerative neurological/muscle disease, chronic
infection (e.g. TB, HIV) or infestation
• Malignancy
• Psychiatric causes Depression, dementia, anorexia
Malnutrition 50% of women and 25% of men aged >85y are unable to
cook a meal alone. Malnutrition is common amongst the elderly.
Poor nutritional status Slows rate of wound healing, i risk of infection,
d muscle strength, is detrimental to mental well-being, and d the ability of
elderly people to remain independent.
Risk factors
• Malabsorption
• Low income
• i metabolism
• Living alone
• Difficulty eating and/or swallowing
• Mental health problems
(stroke, neurological disorder, MND)
(e.g. depression)
• Presence of chronic disease (e.g.
• Dementia
Crohn’s disease, UC, IBS, cancer,
• Recent bereavement
COPD, CCF)
•	Gastric surgery
Management
• General advice Encourage to eat more and i consumption of fruit
and vegetables; consider using nutritional, vitamin (e.g. vitamin D for
the housebound and institutionalized), and mineral supplements
• Inability to prepare meals/shop Consider referral to social services,
meals on wheels, community dietician; community day centre; local
voluntary support organization
• Difficulty with utensils Consider aids/equipment, e.g. special cutlery,
non-slip mats—consider OT referral
• Nausea Consider antiemetics
• Swallowing difficulty Investigate cause. If none found or unable to
resolve the problem, consider pureed food and/or thickened fluids

Figure 8.1 The plate model. Developed nationally to communicate current
recommendations for healthy eating. It shows rough proportions of the various
food groups that should make up each meal.

What is a portion of vegetables or fruit?
One portion of vegetables or fruit is roughly equivalent to:
• 1 normal portion (2 tablespoons) of any vegetable
• 1 dessert bowl of salad
• 1 large fruit, e.g. apple, banana, orange, pear, peach, large tomato, or
a large slice of pineapple or melon
• 2 smaller fruits, e.g. satsumas, plums, kiwi fruits, apricots
• 1 cup of small fruits, e.g. strawberries, raspberries, blackcurrants,
cherries, grapes
• 1 tablespoon of dried fruit
• 2 large tablespoons of fruit salad, stewed or canned fruit in
natural juices
• 1 glass (150mL) of fresh fruit juice

Avoiding snacking Discourage uncontrolled snacking of junk food
between meals. Advise patients to ask themselves the following questions when they feel like eating between meals:
• Am I hungry? If unsure, wait 20min, and then ask the same
question again
• When was the last time I ate? If <3h ago, it may not be real hunger
• Could a small snack tide me over until the next meal? Have
ready-to-eat fruits or vegetables on hand for this

Obesity
Obesity is one of the most important preventable diseases in the UK (see
Table 8.4). The best measure of obesity is body mass index (BMI).

Classification BMI (weight in kg ÷ (height in m)2) (see Figure 8.2):
• 18.5–24.9 Healthy weight
• 30–34.9 Obesity I
Obesity
• 25–29.9 Overweight
• 35–39.9 Obesity II
• >40 Obesity III (Morbid obesity)

}

Waist circumference See Table 8.5. Alternative measure of body

fat correlated with CHD risk, DM, hyperlipidaemia, and i BP. Measured
halfway between the superior iliac crest and the rib cage. Use in addition
to BMI to aid assessment of health risks.

Causes
• Cultural factors
• Physical inactivity
• Low education
• Smoking cessation—mean weight i 3–4kg
• Polygenic genetic predisposition—71 in 3 obese people—more prone
to obesity again after successful dieting
• Childbirth—especially if not breastfeeding
• Drugs—steroids, antipsychotics (e.g. olanzapine), contraceptives
(especially depo-injections), sulfonylureas, insulin
• Endocrine causes (rare)—hypothyroidism, Cushing’s syndrome, PCOS—
only investigate if there are other symptoms/signs of endocrine disease
• Ongoing binge eating disorder (b p. 1015)

Prevention Begins in childhood with healthy patterns of exercise/diet.
Management When the body’s intake > output over a period of time,

obesity results. Management aims to reverse this trend on a long-term
basis through healthy diet, adjustment of calorie intake, physical exercise,
and psychological support.
Initial assessment Assess willingness to change, eating behaviour and
diet, physical activity, psychological distress, and social and family factors
affecting diet. Check a baseline BMI and waist circumference. Check BP,
blood glucose, and fasting lipid profile.
Advice Whether willing to change or not, provide advice on risks of
obesity, and benefits of healthy eating (b p. 174) and physical exercise
(b p. 180). Tailor your advice to the individual. If unwilling to change,
reinforce this information at each encounter with the patient.
Diet Advise a weight loss diet for any patient who is overweight/obese
and willing to change:
• d calorie diets All obese people lose weight on a low-energy intake.
Aim for weight loss of 1–2lb (0.5–1kg)/wk using a d in calorie intake of
7600kcal/d with a target BMI of 25, in steps of 5–10% of original weight.
There is no health benefit of weight d below this. If simple diet sheets
are not effective, refer to a dietician
• Very low calorie diets (<1,000kcal/d). Only limited place in
management—use for a maximum of 12wk for obese patients when
weight loss has plateaued

Drug therapy BNF 4.5.1. Orlistat (120mg tds with food) is the only drug
licensed for treatment of obesity in the UK. It acts by d fat absorption.
Consider if a 3mo trial of supervised diet/exercise has failed and BMI
≥30kg/m2 or ≥27kg/m2 + co-morbidity (e.g. DM, i BP). Continue treatment
>3mo only if weight d is ≥5% of initial body weight.
Surgery Consider if BMI >40kg/m2 and non-surgical measures have failed.
Adjustable gastric banding is the most common procedure. Complications:
band slippage/damage; gastric erosion, pouch dilatation; infection;
malabsorption.
Group and behavioural therapy Group activities, e.g. Weight Watchers,
have a higher success rates in producing/maintaining weight d. Behavioural
therapy together with low calorie diets is also effective.

Maintenance of weight loss Once a patient has lost weight, continue

to monitor diet. Ongoing follow-up helps to sustain weight loss. Weight
fluctuation (yo-yo dieting) may be harmful.

Exercise
In the UK, 60% of adults are not active enough to benefit their health.

Recommended amounts of activity

• Adults ≥30min/d moderate intensity exercise on ≥5d/wk
• Children ≥1h/d moderate intensity exercise every day

Assessing levels of physical activity
See Table 8.6. Use a validated tool to assess levels of physical activity, e.g.
General Practitioner Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ).

Health benefits of exercise Regular physical activity:
d risk of
• ObesityS—b p. 178
• DM—through i insulin sensitivityS
• Cardiovascular disease—physically inactive people have 72x i risk of
CHD and 73x i risk of strokeS
• Osteoporosis—exercise d risk of hip fractures by ½S
• Cancer—d risk of colon cancer 740%. There is also evidence of a link
between exercise and d risk of breast and prostate cancersS
Is a useful treatment for
• i BP—can result in 10mmHg drop of systolic and diastolic BP; can also
delay onset of hypertensionS
• Hypercholesterolaemia—i high-density lipoprotein (HDL), d lowdensity lipoprotein (LDL)C
• MI (b p. 260) and COPD (b p. 316)
• DM—improves insulin sensitivity and favourably affects other risk
factors for DM, including obesity, HDL/LDL ratio, and iBP
• HIV—i cardiopulmonary fitness and psychological well-beingC
• Arthritis and back pain—maintains functionC
• Mental health problems—d intensity of depression; d anxietyS

Figure 8.3 Management plan for increasing activity levels

Effective interventions
• Healthcare Counselling is as effective as more structured exercise
sessions. Specialist rehabilitation schemes are available for patients
with specific conditions (e.g. post-MI, COPD); exercise schemes
operate in some areas, offering low cost, supervised exercise for
patients who might otherwise find it unacceptable to visit a gym and
are accessed via GP ‘prescription’; many sports facilities offer special
sessions for pregnant women, the over-50s, and people with disability
• Workplace Interventions to i rates of walking to work are effective
• Schools Appropriately designed and delivered physical education
curricula can enhance physical activity levels. A whole-school approach
to physical activity promotion is effective
• Transport Well-designed interventions i walking/cycling to work
• Communities Community-wide approaches i activity

Smoking
Facts and figures In England, 21% of adults (4 21%; 5 20%) smoke.
Prevalence is highest amongst those aged 20–24 (32%) and lowest aged
>60y (12%). 6% school children aged 11–15y are regular smokers (5 10%;
4 8%). Surveys of smokers show 73% want to stop and 30% intend to give
up in <1y—but only 72%/y successfully give up permanently.
Risks of smoking Smoking is the greatest single cause of illness and
premature death in the UK. Half of all regular smokers will die as a result
of smoking—106,000 people/y. Smoking is associated with i risk of:
• Cancers 729% all cancer deaths. Common cancers include: lung (>90%
are smokers); lip; mouth; stomach; colon; bladder
• Cardiovascular disease CHD, CVA, peripheral vascular disease
• Chronic lung disease COPD, recurrent chest infection, exacerbation
of asthma (29% of respiratory deaths result from smoking)
• Problems in pregnancy PET, IUGR, preterm delivery, neonatal and
late fetal death
• DM
• Thrombosis
• Osteoporosis
• Dyspepsia and/or gastric ulcers
Passive smoking is associated with
• i risk of coronary heart disease and lung cancer (i by 25%)
• i risk of cot death, bronchitis, and otitis media in children

Helping people to stop smoking Advice from a GP results in 2% of
smokers stopping—5% if advice is repeatedCE. See Figure 8.4.
Aids to smoking cessation BNF 4.10
Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) i the chance of stopping 7 1½xN.
All preparations are equally effectiveC. Start with higher doses for patients
highly dependent. Continue treatment for 3mo, tailing off dose gradually
over 2wk before stopping (except gum which can be stopped abruptly).
Contraindicated immediately post-MI, stroke, or TIA, and for patients with
arrhythmia.
Bupropion (Zyban®) Smokers (>18y) start taking the tablets 1–2wk
before intended quit day (150mg od for 3d, then 150mg bd for 7–9wk).
i cessation rate >2xN. Contraindications: epilepsy or i risk of seizures,
eating disorder, bipolar disorder.
Varenicline (Champix®) Smokers (>18y) start taking the tablets 1wk
before intended quit day (0.5mg od for 3d, 0.5mg bd for 4d then 1mg bd
for 11wk). d dose to 1mg od if renal impairment/elderly. i cessation rate
>2x. If the patient has stopped smoking after 12wk, consider prescribing a
further 12wk treatment to d chance of relapse. Contraindications: caution
in psychiatric illness.
Alternative therapies Hypnotherapy may be helpful in some casesC.

Support In many areas, ‘stop smoking’ services are provided by PCOs.
These programmes vary but generally consist of a combination of group
education, counselling and support ± individual support in combination
with nicotine replacement, bupropion, or varenicline.

Figure 8.4 Management plan for smokers in the surgery
• Smoking cessation medication Prescibe only for smokers who
commit to a target stop date. Initially, prescribe only enough to last 2wk
after the target stop date, i.e 2wk nicotine replacement therapy, 3–4wk
bupropion, or 3wk varenicline. Only offer a second prescription if the
smoker demonstrates continuing commitment to stop smoking.

Alcohol
‘An alcoholic is someone you don’t like who drinks as much as you do’
Dylan Thomas (1914–1953)
Alcohol misuse is a major public health and social concern.
Alcohol-related problems cost the NHS 7£1.7 billion/y. Most harm is
caused by non-dependent drinkers. Screening and brief interventions in primary care can identify drinkers in this group and d consumption and harm.
Recommended limits for alcohol consumption See Table 8.7.

Prevalence of excess alcohol use
• Hazardous/harmful drinking—excess drinking causing potential or
actual harm but without dependence—affects 32% 4; 15% 5
• Binge drinking (>8u for 4 or >6u for 5 in 1d)—affects 21% 4; 9% 5
• Alcohol dependence—affects 6% 4; 2% 5
Health risk Continuum—individual risk depends on other factors too
(e.g. smoking, heart disease). Alcohol-associated problems:
Death 15–22,000 deaths/y in the UK are associated with alcohol misuse
(most related to stroke, cancer, liver disease, accidental injury/suicide).

Non-dependent drinkers Brief GP intervention l 724% d drinking. Present
results of screening interventions, e.g. AUDIT (b p. 185) and identify risks.
Provide information about safe amounts of alcohol and harmful effects of
exceeding these. Assess whether the patient is receptive to change. If so, agree
targets to d consumption, give encouragement, and negotiate follow-up.
Alcohol-dependent drinkers Suffer withdrawal symptoms if they d alcohol
consumption (e.g. anxiety, fits, delirium tremens—b p. 1070).
• If wanting to stop drinking—refer to the community alcohol team;
suggest self-help organizations, e.g. Alcoholics Anonymous; involve
family and friends in support
• Detoxification in the community usually uses a reducing regimen of
chlordiazepoxide over a 1wk period (20–30mg qds on days 1 and 2;
15mg qds on days 3 and 4; 10mg qds on day 5; 10mg bd on day 6;
10mg od on day 7 then stop)
• Community detoxification is contraindicated for patients with:
• i risk of suicide

Assessment of drugs misuse
14% of men and 8% of women aged 16–59 report taking illicit drugs in
the past year. The majority of patients on treatment programmes report
opioid misuse (heroin—54%; methadone—13%) but the most frequently
abused drugs are cannabis, amphetamine, ecstasy, and cocaine. Three factors appear important: availability of drugs; vulnerable personality; and
social pressures—particularly from peers.

Detection Warning signs suggesting drug misuse:
Use of services Suspicious requests for drugs of abuse (e.g. no clear
medical indication, prescription requests are too frequent).
Signs and symptoms
• Evidence of injecting (e.g.
• Inappropriate behaviour
marked veins)
• Lack of self-care
• Hepatitis or HIV infection
• Unexplained nasal discharge
• Unusually constricted/dilated pupils
Social factors Family disruption, criminal history.
Assessment Assess on >1 occasion before deciding how to proceed.
Exceptions are severe withdrawal symptoms and/or evidence of an established regime requiring continuation. Points to cover:
General information
• Check identification (ask to see an official document)
• Contact with other agencies (including last GP)—check accuracy
• Current residence; family—partner, children
• Employment/finances
• Criminal behaviour—past and
• Current legal problems
present
History of drug use/risk taking behaviour
• Reason for consulting now and willingness to change
• Current and past usage
• Unsafe sexual practices
• Knowledge of risks
Medical and psychiatric history
• Complications of drug abuse, e.g. HIV, hepatitis, accidents
•	General medical and psychiatric history and examination
• Alcohol abuse
• Overdose—accidental/deliberate
Investigations
• Consider urine toxicology to confirm drug misuse
• Consider blood for FBC, LFTs, hepatitis B, C and HIV serology (with
consent and counselling—b p. 744), and other tests according to
medical history/examination

Specific drugs SeeTable 8.9, b p. 190. 0 Gabapentin/pregabalin are
increasingly being used as drugs of abuse, particularly in prisons.
Notification of drug misusers Report patients who start treatment
for drug abuse to the relevant authorities (see Table 8.8). All types of
problem drug misuse should be reported. Databases cannot be used as a
check on multiple prescribing as data are anonymized.

Management of drugs misuse
Aims to d risk of infectious diseases; d drug-related deaths; and d criminal activity used to finance drug habits.
Avoid working in isolation. Anyone involved in substitute prescribing
should wherever possible be doing so through their local shared care
arrangements. The GP and primary healthcare team have a vital role in:
• Identifying drug misusers
• Assessing health/willingness to modify drug behaviour (see Figure 8.6)
• Referring for specialist assessment and treatment of drug abuse, and
• Routine screening/prevention (e.g. cervical screening, contraception)

General measures If ongoing care, at each meeting consider:
Education
• Safer routes of drug administration, e.g. smoking/rectal administration
for heroin abusers. Discourage IM/subcutaneous administration
• Specific risks of drugs (e.g. psychosis with amphetamines; local risks,
such as contaminated street drugs)
• Safe injecting advice and overdose prevention
• Safe sexual practices/condom use
• Other local services
• Driving and drug misuse (b p. 131)
Medical care
• Treatment of/advice about complications of drug misuse
• Testing/treatment for blood-borne disease, e.g. hepatitis B or C, HIV
Hepatitis B immunization For injecting drug misusers not already infected/
immune and close contacts of those already infected. Use accelerated
regime—immunization at 0, 7, and 21d, and a booster after 12mo.
Treatment of dependence
• Set realistic goals—aim to help the patient remain healthy, until,
with appropriate care and support, he/she can achieve a drug-free
life. Consider d in illicit drug use, d duration of periods of drug use,
d risk of relapse, d need for criminal activity to finance drug misuse,
improving personal and social functioning. These aims are often best
met by maintenance substitute prescribing, e.g. with methadone/
buprenorphine for heroin abuse
• Set conditions for acceptable behaviour/treatment withdrawal. Agree
on the pharmacy to be used and involve the pharmacist
• Review regularly and include the whole team
•	Give contact numbers for community support organizations (b p. 189)
• Send notification to national authority (b p. 188), if not already done
• Seek advice/refer to a community substance misuse team as needed

Pre-contemplation—
patient is unaware
that there is a problem

Relapse—can occur at any stage. Not
a failure, but a learning experience to
improve chances the next time round

Contemplation—ambivalence,
might acknowledge a problem
and need for change

Maintenance—need to consolidate
gains so as not to relapse

Decision—hypothetical point where
decision made to change/or not

Action—patient seeks help

Figure 8.6 Stages of change in addiction

Safe injecting advice
• Never inject alone
• Always inject with the blood flow and rotate sites—avoid neck,
groin, penis, axilla, foot and hand veins, and any infected areas/
swollen limbs—even if veins are distended
• Use sterile, new injecting equipment with the smallest bore needle
possible and dispose of all equipment safely after use
• Avoid unsuitable preparations e.g. crushed tablets and/or injecting
cocktails of drugs (injection of heroin and cocaine together is known
as ‘speedballing’ or ‘snowballing’)
• Learn basic principles of first aid and CPR (provide information on
courses available). Encourage calling for an ambulance
• Poor veins indicate poor technique—find out what the patient
is doing

Preventing overdose Be aware of risk factors:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Injecting heroin		
• Recent non-fatal overdose
Longer injecting career
• High levels of use/intoxication
High levels of alcohol use
Lowered tolerance through detoxification/imprisonment
Depression, suicidal thoughts
Multiple drug use—particularly CNS depressants
Sharing equipment/other high risk injecting behaviour—may indicate
low concern about personal risk
• Not being on a treatment programme or premature exit from a
methadone programme

Insomnia
From the Latin meaning ‘no sleep’: describes a perception of disturbed or
inadequate sleep. 71:4 of the UK population (5 > 4) are thought to suffer
in varying degrees. Prevalence: i with age, rising to 1 in 2 amongst the over
65s. Causes are numerous—common examples include:
• Minor, self-limiting Travel, stress, shift work, small children, arousal
• Psychological 7½ have mental health problems: depression, anxiety,
mania, grief, alcoholism
• Physical Drugs (e.g. steroids), pain, pruritus, tinnitus, sweats (e.g.
menopause), nocturia, asthma, obstructive sleep apnoea

Definition of ‘a good night’s sleep’
•
•
•
•

<30min to fall asleep
Maintenance of sleep for 6–8h
<3 brief awakenings/night
Feels well rested and refreshed on awakening

Management Careful evaluation. Many do not have a sleep problem
themselves but a relative feels there is a problem, e.g. the retired milkman
continuing to wake at 4 a.m. Others have unrealistic expectations, e.g. they
need 12h sleep/d. Reassurance alone may be all that is required.
For genuine problems
• Eliminate physical problems preventing sleep, e.g. treat asthma or
eczema; give long-acting painkillers to last the whole night; consider
HRT or fluoxetine for sweats; refer if obstructive sleep apnoea is
suspected (b p. 338)
• Treat psychiatric problems, e.g. depression, anxiety
• Sleep hygiene—see Box 8.2
• Relaxation techniques—compact discs (borrow from libraries or buy
from pharmacies); relaxation classes (often offered by local recreation
centres/adult education centres); many physiotherapists can teach
relaxation techniques
• Consider drug treatment Last resort. Benzodiazepines may be
prescribed for insomnia ‘only when it is severe, disabling, or subjecting
the individual to extreme distress’.
Drug treatment Benzodiazepines (e.g. temazepam), zolpidem, zopiclone,
and low-dose TCA (e.g. amitriptyline 10–75mg) nocte are all commonly
prescribed for patients with insomnia.
• Side effects: amnesia and daytime somnolence. Most hypnotics do
affect daytime performance and may cause falls in the elderly. Warn
patients about their effect on driving and operating machinery
• Only prescribe a few weeks’ supply at a time due to potential for
dependence and abuse
1 Beware the temporary resident who has ‘forgotten’ his/her night
sedation.

Insomnia

Box 8.2 Principles of ‘sleep hygiene’
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Don’t go to bed until you feel sleepy
Don’t stay in bed if you’re not asleep
Avoid daytime naps
Establish a regular bedtime routine
Reserve a room for sleep only (if possible). Do not eat, read, work,
or watch TV in it
Make sure the bedroom and bed are comfortable, and avoid
extremes of noise and temperature
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and nicotine
Have a warm bath and warm milky drink at bedtime
Take regular exercise, but avoid late night hard exercise (sex is OK)
Monitor your sleep with a sleep diary (record both the times you
sleep and its quality)
Rise at the same time every morning regardless of how long
you’ve slept

Complications of insomnia d quality of life; d concentration and
memory, affecting performance of daytime tasks; relationship problems;
risk of accidents. 10% motor accidents are related to tiredness.

Chronic disease and elderly care

Chronic disease management
The predominant disease pattern in the developed world is one of chronic
or long-term illness. In the UK, 41% of adult 4 and 43% of adult 5 report
a long-term illness. This figure is increasing as our population ages. People
with long-term conditions are very intensive users of services; they
account for 52% of GP appointments, 65% of outpatient appointments,
and 77% of hospital bed days.
Although details of chronic illness management depend on the illness,
people with chronic diseases of all types have much in common with each
other. They all have similar concerns/problems and must deal not only
with their disease(s) but also its impact on their lives/emotions.

Common patient concerns
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Finding and using health services and other community resources
Knowing how to recognize/respond to changes in a chronic disease
Dealing with problems and emergencies
Making decisions about when to seek medical help
Using medicines and treatments effectively
Knowing how to manage stress/depression that go with chronic illness
Coping with fatigue, pain, and sleep problems
Getting enough exercise
Maintaining good nutrition
Working with your doctor(s) and other care providers
Talking about your illness with family and friends
Managing work, family, and social activities

Personal Health Budgets Being introduced in 2014 for all those
receiving NHS Continuing Care and will also be available to others with
chronic disease who would benefit from increased flexibility of services.
Sum of money allocated to enable tailored care to meet individual health/
well-being needs. Based on a care plan developed between patient and
lead healthcare professional; signed off by the PCO.
Common elements of effective chronic illness management
• Involvement of the whole family Chronic diseases do not only affect
the patient but everyone in a family
• Collaboration Between service providers, patients and carers.
Negotiate and agree a definition of the problem; agree targets and
goals for management; develop an individualized self management plan
• Personalized written care plan Take into account patient/carers’
views and experience and the current evidence base
• Tailored education in self-management A patient with diabetes
spends 73h/y with a health professional—the other 8757h he or she
manages his/her own condition. Helping patients with chronic disease
understand and take responsibility for their conditions is vital
• Planned follow-up Pro-active follow-up according to the care plan—
use of disease registers and call-recall systems is important

Chronic disease management

• Monitoring of outcome and adherence to treatment Use of
disease/treatment markers; monitoring of concordance, e.g. checking
prescription frequency; medicine management programmes—b p. 142
• Tools and protocols for stepped care Provide a framework for
using limited resources to greatest effect; step professional care
in intensity—start with limited professional input and systematic
monitoring, then augment care for patients not achieving an acceptable
outcome; initial and subsequent treatments are selected according to
evidence-based guidelines in light of a patient’s progress
• Targeted use of specialist services For those patients who cannot be
managed in primary care alone
• Monitoring of process Continually monitor management through
clinical governance mechanisms (b p. 72)
Risk profiling In recent years computer software has been produced
that can identify ‘high-risk’ patients from information on GP IT systems and
through service usage data. This helps to target resources towards those
patients and improve outcomes.
Depression and chronic diseaseN Depression affects 30–50% of
those with epilepsy, CVD, dementia, cancer, type 2 DM, and arthritis. It
adversely affects prognosis in those patients, but treatment of depression
can improve prognosis. Depression is associated with:
• i mortality, i morbidity, i disability, and poorer quality of life
• i prevalence of smoking and sedentary lifestyles
• Poorer chronic disease outcomes measures, e.g. higher HbA1c levels
• i use of services and i healthcare costs
• Poor concordance with medication and management plans
Detection of depression Use NICE depression screening questions:
• During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down,
depressed, or hopeless?
• During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little
interest or pleasure in doing things?
A positive response to either of these questions should prompt further
assessment with the following three questions: During the last month have
you often been bothered by:
• Feelings of worthlessness?
• Thoughts of death?
• Poor concentration?
Further assessment and management b p. 1000
Residential care homes 220,000 people live in residential care in
England; 77% are elderly with long-term health conditions. Of younger
residents, 61% have learning disabilities; 21% have mental illness; 17% have
physical disability, and 2% have substance misuse problems. Chronic disease management for residents of care homes is frequently neglected.
Ensure that chronic disease management checks take place, including routine blood monitoring, physical health checks, and medication review.

chapter 9

Chronic disease and elderly care

Medically unexplained symptoms
Medically unexplained symptoms (MUS) are physical symptoms for which
no organic cause can be demonstrated. GPs deal with MUS in about 25%
of consultations, and MUS cost the NHS £3.1 billion/y. MUS cause disability as severe as that originating from organic pathology.

Epidemiology MUS are common throughout the world in all ages. Risk
factors for development of MUS include:
• 5>4
• Physical illness/trauma
• Stressful life events, e.g. illness or death of a close relative, domestic
violence, history of child abuse
• Media campaigns that highlight specific diseases
Classification MUS can be divided into 3 types of complaint:
• Pain of a specific location, e.g. back pain, headache, fibromyalgia
• Functional disturbance in a particular organ, e.g. IBS, palpitations
• Fatigue/exhaustion e.g. chronic fatigue syndrome
Many patients have >1 MUS. There are also common overlaps of symptoms, e.g. patients with IBS often meet diagnostic criteria for chronic pelvic
pain and vice versa.

Concurrent psychological illness 30% of patients with MUS have
an underlying psychiatric problem—usually anxiety or depression.

Underlying mechanism Two mechanisms seem to underpin MUS:

• Enhanced sense of bodily awareness Tendency to notice and
amplify normal physical sensations such as heartbeat. Over-awareness
i anxiety and in turn makes the bodily sensation more likely
• Misattribution of symptoms Rather than normalizing symptoms (e.g.
‘I have a headache because I’ve been working too hard’), patients with
MUS tend to attribute somatic explanations (e.g. ‘I have a headache
because I have a brain tumour’)

Assessment Consider a diagnosis of MUS in any patient with physical

symptoms for >3mo that are affecting functioning but cannot be readily
explained. Even if the patient is known to present with MUS, perform your
assessment without prejudice. Patients with MUS have the same chance of
developing serious new illnesses as any other patient. Ask:
• What are the symptoms? Rule out ‘redflags’
• How much and what type of impairment do the symptoms cause?
• What are the patient’s concerns about the symptom? Has the patient
sought information from other sources, e.g. Internet, friends?
• What made the patient come to the surgery today?
• What would the patient like you to do for him/her?
• Are there any signs of disease on physical examination?
• Does the patient have low mood or any symptoms of anxiety
(consider depression and/or anxiety screening questionnaires)?
• Are there any other social/psychological factors that may be triggering
symptoms, e.g. family member or close friend who is ill; domestic
violence; debt; work problems; past history of child abuse?

Medically unexplained symptoms

Investigation Review patient notes carefully before requesting inves-

tigations. Usually investigations are used to clarify diagnosis and reassure
the patient and GP. However, in patients with MUS:
• >50% of patients are not reassured following negative investigations
• False positive results lead to i anxiety and further investigation, and
• Colluding with the patient i illness behaviour
0 Find a balance between appropriate investigation and risk of harm
through over-investigation. Prior to doing investigations, explain why they
are being done and the meaning of negative results.
ManagementG 4 key areas:
• Connecting Go back to the beginning, listen to the patient,
acknowledge suffering, use existing knowledge of the individual (or
recognize that you have no knowledge of the individual)
• Summarizing Allow the patient to summarize problems, recap your
understanding of the problem to the patient, give an explanation, and
show your interest in the problem
• Hand over Develop a shared action plan or personal health plan with
realistic goals to improve functioning, and provide reassurance about
long-term outcome
• Safety netting Share uncertainty, inform patients about red flags
indicating serious disease, and offer access should symptoms change
Regular appointments may be helpful, as may a brief physical examination at each visit to check for signs of disease. Offering suggestions for
self-management (e.g. doing voluntary work, increasing physical activity levels) can be useful. Avoid referral unless there is a clear medical indication.
General treatment options If self-help is ineffective, try:
• Antidepressant medication, e.g. amitriptyline 10mg at 5 p.m.
(unlicensed). As response is often not dose-dependent, start with a
low dose. Explain that the drug is not being used to treat depression
• CBT Allows patients to develop changes in thinking/behaviour that will
help them cope more effectively with their problems

Chronic disease and elderly care

Normal ageing
The UK is home to 62.3 million people. Median age is 39.9y and rising. By
2012, women aged 65y could expect to live to the age of 85y. Projections
suggest that this will i by another 3y by 2021. Over the past 30y, the
population aged >65y has grown by 23% from 8.4 to 10.3 million. The largest percentage growth in population is in the >85y age group.
What is ageing? Ageing is a gradual series of changes over time that
lead to the loss of function of organs and cells, with the eventual outcome
of death. Individuals vary greatly in the rate at which they age. Several
­factors seem to influence this:
• Genetic make-up
• Socio-economic factors
• Psychological health
• Environment
•	Lifestyle—diet, physical exercise, smoking

Normal changes of ageing See Table 9.1
Difficulties assessing the elderly
• Communication problems—hearing, cognition, speech
• Multiplicity of cause—one symptom may be caused by different,
concurrent processes, e.g. breathlessness as a result of COPD + heart
failure
• Non-specific symptoms/signs—confusion, falls, or ‘off legs’ may be the
only overt sign of underlying disease, e.g. UTI, MI, stroke
• Symptoms may be absent despite disease, and signs harder to elicit
• Polypharmacy (b p. 206) may result in side effects and interactions
•	Laboratory tests may be unreliable—especially white cell counts and
ESR (always check CRP)
Disease The ageing process is compounded by overt disease. This may
affect functional capacity, quality of life and independence, cause frailty,
d well-being and independence, and result in i care and mobility needs.

Multiple morbidity Older people are more likely to have several

ongoing chronic illnesses that can act in combination to cause disability
greater than either illness alone and/or result in:
• Direction of care at some problems with relative neglect of others
• Polypharmacy—b p. 206
• Involvement of multiple specialist teams which can cause
inconvenience to the patient and family, and result in conflicting advice,
and opposing opinions on cause/effect of symptoms

Frailty Many elderly people are described as being ‘frail’. This term is used
to describe individuals who are physically weak and fragile. It can occur on
a background of natural ageing or be precipitated by a disease process. It is
not a disease or disability in itself, but a vulnerability or inability to withstand
physical/psychological stressors. Common features of frailty include:
• Unintentional weight loss (>5kg in a year)
• Feeling of exhaustion
• Weakness—measured by grip strength
• Slow walking speed
•	Low levels of physical activity

Chronic disease and elderly care

Elderly care and rehabilitation
‘Use strengthens, disuse debilitates’
Hippocrates (460–357 BC)

13–14% of the population has some disability. This is increasing as populations age and people survive longer with disability. Many more are just
elderly and frail; 35% of people aged >80y cannot live an independent life.

Role of the GP Most patients are best managed by a multidisciplinary
team in their home (if practicable) with a problem-oriented approach.
Good interdisciplinary communication and coordination is essential.
Psychological and sociocultural aspects are as important as medical
aspects of care. Information alone can improve outcome. The GP of any
elderly patient or patient receiving rehabilitation in the community is a
team member and often the key worker who coordinates care.
Case Management Register (CMR) In England, GP practices must perform risk profiling (see b p. 199) for all registered patients. Those
deemed ‘high risk’ (all patients >75y, those at high risk of admission to
hospital or complications of their illnesses, and those requiring end-oflife care) are added to the CMR. Each patient on the CMR must have a
personalized care plan, and a named GP responsible for coordinating care
and ensuring the care plan is functioning and kept up to date. Same day
support must be provided to these patients if needed.
Consider
• Can physical symptoms be improved?
• Can psychological symptoms be improved (including self-esteem)?
• Can functioning within the home be improved (aids and adaptations
within the home, extra help)?
• Can functioning in the community be improved? (mobility outside
the home, work, social activities)
• Can the patient’s or carer’s financial state be improved?
• Does the carer need more support?
0 If progress is slower than expected or stalls, consider other medical
problems (e.g. anaemia, hypothyroidism, dementia), a neurological event,
depression, or communication problems (e.g. poor vision/hearing).

Principles of rehabilitation and elderly care
• Use of assessments/measures Central to the management of frailty/
disability. Use validated measures accepted by all team members (e.g.
disability scores b p. 584; PHQ-9 b p. 1001). Reassess regularly
• Teamwork Good outcomes are associated with clinicians working
as a team towards a common goal with patients and their families
(or carers) included as team members
• Goal-setting Goals must be meaningful, challenging but achievable.
Use short- and long-term goals. Involve the patient 9 carer(s).
Regularly renew, review, and adapt
• Underlying approach to therapy All approaches focus on modification
of impairment with everyday activities and improvement in function

Elderly care and rehabilitation

• Intensity/duration of therapy How much therapy is needed? Is there
a minimum threshold below which there is no benefit at all? Studies
on well-organized services show it is rare for patients to receive
>2h therapy/d. No one knows what is ideal

Multidisciplinary working A multidisciplinary approach is ideal, for
example:
• DNs Provide nursing care and equipment, advise on all aspects of
nursing care, and teach carers how to do everyday tasks (e.g. emptying
catheter bags, lifting). They are sources of information on local services
and provide support for carers of patients on their caseload
• Community physiotherapists Are invaluable sources of help, advice,
and equipment for practical problems relating to mobility
• Occupational therapists Can help patients and carers cope with
difficulties in everyday living caused by disability by providing for aids
and appliances and arranging alterations
• Speech therapists Can help with communication problems and
swallowing difficulties
• Dieticians Can help maintain calorie intake if undernourished, assist
with weight d if overweight and advise on special diets
Referral
• Medical opinion For clarification of diagnosis (e.g. if diagnosis is in
doubt or patient has symptoms/signs incongruous with diagnosis)
• Specialist rehabilitation services New or deterioration in existing
impairment, disability or handicap, or advances in management that
warrant re-referral for specialist care
• Social services For assessment of the home for modification,
assessment to allow application for mobility aids or services to help
the disabled person and/or carer to cope
• Voluntary organizations and self-help groups Useful sources of
support for patients and carers
• Citizens Advice Bureau For independent advice on benefits and
services

Chronic disease and elderly care

Prescribing for the elderly
Use of medicines i as people get older; 1 in 3 NHS prescriptions are
for patients >65y and 90% of these prescriptions are for repeat medication. Adverse drug events are common reasons for hospital admission in
the over-75 age group; many are avoidable. Regular review is essential.
Problems commonly encountered:

Polypharmacy Elderly people often have multiple problems. It is easy
to keep adding drugs for each new problem l polypharmacy. This i confusion about drug regimes and results in poor concordance and multiple
interactions/side effects.
• Before prescribing a new drug, consider whether it is necessary—avoid
treating normal changes of ageing; use non-pharmacological therapies
wherever possible; avoid ‘a pill for every ill’ approach and try to treat
the underlying condition not the symptoms
• Balance the potential risks of the drug against the benefits. Drug
trials of efficacy of medication often exclude older participants—the
applicability of evidence to elderly patients cannot be assumed. For
prophylactic medication (e.g. warfarin, statins), consider the likelihood
of concordance and benefits in the context of the whole person
(including other co-morbidities)
•	Review medication regularly. Stop ineffective/redundant drugs and
consider if the overall drug regime can be simplified

Form of the medicine Swallowing tablets can be difficult for elderly
people. Consider using liquid preparations/giving explicit advice to take
medication with plenty of water and sitting upright.
Confusion after discharge Up to half of all patients are inadvertently
prescribed the wrong medication after hospital discharge. Take care.
Drug hoarding/self-medication Especially if recent changes in medi-

cation it is common for elderly people to have a back stock of drugs and
continue taking their old drugs alongside new ones. A written list may
be helpful. Many elderly people also self-medicate extensively with OTC
preparations. If necessary do a home visit to sort out the drugs.

i susceptibility to side effects Common due to altered:
• Pharmacodynamics i susceptibility to GI side effects (e.g. constipation
with opioids; gastric irritation with NSAIDs) and i sensitivity to effects
of CNS drugs, e.g. benzodiazepines, opioids—use with care
• Pharmacokinetics d renal function is particularly important—always
assume any elderly person has moderate impairment if renal function
is not known
Social and personal factors Low level of home support; physical factors, e.g. poor vision, poor hearing, or poor manual dexterity; and mental
state e.g. confusion/disorientation, depression—can all affect ability of an
older person to take medication.

Specific medicines The Beer’s list is a list of agents to be avoided/used
with extreme caution in elderly patients. It can be accessed via:

Prescribing for the elderly

Guidelines for prescribing for the elderly
Think before prescribing
• Is the drug needed?
• Is there another non-pharmacological way of managing the problem?
• Are you treating the underlying condition or the symptoms of it?
• What are the pros and cons of the patient taking this drug?
• What is the evidence base for its use in this age group?
• Will the patient be able to take the drug (formulation; packaging)?
• Will the patient be concordant?
• Will the patient comply with any necessary monitoring?
Limit the range of drugs you use Prescribe from a limited array of drugs
that you know well.
Repeats and disposal
• Tell patients how to get more tablets, and monitor frequency of
repeat prescriptions
•	Review repeat prescriptions regularly (b p. 144)
• Tell patients what to do with any leftover if a drug is stopped
d the dose
• Start with 50% of the adult dose
• Avoid drugs likely to cause problems (e.g. long-acting antidiabetic
agents such as glibenclamide)
Review regularly
• Consider on each occasion whether each drug could be stopped or
the regime simplified
• Consider lowering dosage of drugs if renal function is deteriorating
• Involve carers, community pharmacists, and other PHCT members
Simplify regimes
• Use od or bd regimes wherever possible
• Avoid polypharmacy
Explain clearly
• Put precise instructions on the drug bottle—avoid ‘use as directed’
• Give written instructions about how the drug should be taken
• Ensure explanations are given to carers as well as patients where
appropriate
Consider method of administration
• Bottles with childproof tops are often impossible for arthritic hands to
open. Suggest the patient asks the chemist for a standard screw cap
• Drug administration boxes, in which the correct tablets are stored in
slots marked with the day and time of administration can be helpful.
Available from pharmacists and can be filled by the patient, a carer,
friend or relative, or the pharmacist
• Medication reminder charts can also be helpful

Chronic disease and elderly care

Falls amongst the elderly
Falls are a major cause of disability and the leading cause of mortality due
to injury in people aged >75y. Tendency to fall i with age. Assessment of
a patient who has fallen is a common primary care emergency.

Risk factors for falls Recurrence i with number of risk factors:
•	Lower limb weakness or arthritis
• 5:48 2:1 in the over 75s
• History of stroke or PD
• i age
• Use of psychotropic drugs,
• Multiple previous falls
sedatives, diuretics, or B-blockers
• Disorders of gait or balance
• Alcohol
• Visual impairment
• Environmental factors, e.g.
• Cognitive impairment
loose rugs, poor lighting, ice,
•	Low morale/depression
high winds
• High level of dependence
• Infection, e.g. pneumonia, UTI
• d mobility
• Foot problems
Assessment Deal with the injuries first—ask about pain, loss of func-

tion, headache. Ask carers about behaviour. Check for bruising, d function, confusion, BP, pulse, neurology, and fundi. Consider hypothermia if
on the floor for any duration.

Investigate the cause of the fall Consider:
• Physical problems Neurological problems (e.g. stroke); visual loss;
cardiac abnormalities (e.g. arrhythmia, postural hypotension); muscular
abnormalities (e.g. steroid-induced myopathy); skeletal problems (e.g.
osteoarthritis); infection (pneumonia, UTI)
• Environmental problems Climbing ladders to do routine maintenance;
loose/holed carpets; slippery floor/bath; chair or bed too low
Management
• Treat any acute injury (20%). Exclude fracture (mainly Colles’/neck of
femur). 0 Subdural haematoma may take days/weeks to reveal itself
• Even if uninjured, older people might not be able to get up off the
floor without help. The result may be a prolonged period of lying
on the floor until help arrives. Apart from the indignity/helplessness
this causes, secondary problems (e.g. pneumonia, pressure sores,
hypothermia, UTI, and dehydration) may follow
• Perform/refer to a specialist falls service for a falls assessment
• Undertake measures to d risk of falls or damage from falling

Further actions
• Refer to A&E if significant head injury (b p. 1112); any suspicion of
fracture; any other significant injury, e.g. lacerations
• Admit to the acute medical or elderly care team if the cause of the
fall was an acute medical problem, e.g. stroke
• Refer to the intermediate care (rapid response) team if the patient
is unable to cope at home or the patient/carer is worried about the
possibility of further falls
• Refer to the specialist elderly care team or falls clinic if the cause of
recurrent falls remains unclear

Falls amongst the elderly

Osteoporosis and prevention of fracture b p. 504
Prevention of falls Falls are one of the biggest risk factors for fracture.

All elderly people should have risk of falls assessed regularly. 0 Any fall
may seriously undermine an elderly person’s confidence and cause worry
about the possibility of recurrence. As a result, there may be restriction of
activities l d fitness and i dependency on others.
Is a falls assessment needed? Ask if patients fall—they may not volunteer the information spontaneously.
The timed get up and go test 0 May use usual walking aid.
• Start with the patient sitting in a straight-backed chair of comfortable
height with arms
• Ask the patient to rise from the chair, walk to a line 10 feet (3m)
away, turn around, return to the chair, and sit down again
• Start timing whilst the patient is sitting; end timing when the patient
has sat down again
• A time of ≥13 seconds predicts i falls risk
Falls assessment If available, refer to a specialist falls service. Record:
• Frequency and history of circumstances around any previous falls
• Drug therapy: polypharmacy, hypnotics, sedatives, diuretics,
antihypertensives may all cause falls
• Assessment of gait and balance, including abnormalities due to foot.
problems or arthritis, and motor disorders, e.g. stroke, PD
• Examination of basic neurological function, including vision, mental
status (impaired cognition and depression), muscle strength, lower
extremity peripheral nerves, proprioception, and reflexes
• Assessment of basic cardiovascular status, including BP (exclude
postural hypotension), heart rate, and rhythm
• Assessment of environmental risk factors, e.g. poor lighting particularly on
the stairs, loose carpets or rugs, badly fitting footwear or clothing, varifocal
lenses in glasses (can cause to mis-step), lack of safety equipment such as
grab rails, steep stairs, slippery floors, or inaccessible lights or windows

Measures to d risk of falls and damage from falling
• Correct vision, if possible
• Correct postural hypotension—alter medication; consider
compression stockings—but many elderly people cannot apply
stockings tight enough to be of any use themselves
• Treat other medical conditions, e.g. refer to cardiology if arrhythmia
•	Review medication and discontinue/alter inappropriate medication
•	Remove environmental hazards—arrange bath at a day centre, refer to
OT to identify/correct hazards in the home, e.g. remove loose carpets,
wheeled trolley for use indoors, commode/urine bottle at night, etc.
•	Liaise with other members of the PHCT and social services to provide
additional support if needed; refer to local council or Age UK for
‘carephone’ or alarm system to call for help if any further falls
•	Refer to rehabilitation/physiotherapy to improve confidence after falls
and for weight-bearing exercise (focussing on strength and flexibility)
and balance training (d risk of falls). Use of hip protectors d fracture
risk in patients at high risk but compliance is a problemC

Chronic disease and elderly care

Assessment of pain
Take a history to ascertain:
• What the patient means when he/she complains of pain
• The cause of the pain
• The severity of the pain
0 Do not jump to conclusions/make assumptions about a patient’s pain.

Assessment questions There are many approaches to assessing pain.
The specifics of each scheme are not crucial—but it is important the
scheme used has a logical outline which works for the individual clinician.
A simple mnemonic approach is detailed in Figure 9.1.

Elderly patients and those with communication difficulty High
prevalence of pain in the elderly population is now well recognized.
40–80% of elderly people in institutions are in pain. The reason for this
lies in the difficulty in assessing those with communication difficulties.
Additionally, the elderly often minimize their pain making it even more
difficult to evaluate.
Methods of evaluation Unusual behaviour and its return to normal with
adequate analgesia may be the only confirmation of pain in patients with
communication difficulties. Examples include:
Verbal expression, e.g.
• Crying when touched
• Shouting
• Becoming very quiet
• Swearing
• Grunting
• Talking without making sense

Facial expression, e.g.
• Grimacing/wincing
• Closing eyes
• Worried expression
• Withdrawn/no expression

Behavioural expression, e.g.
• Jumping on touch
• Hand pointing to body area
• Increasing confusion
•	Rocking/shaking
• Not eating
• Staying in bed/chair
• Grumpy mood

Physical expression, e.g.
• Cold
• Pale
• Clammy
• Change in colour
• Change in vital signs if acute
pain (e.g. BP, pulse)

Pain assessment tools Sometimes, it is helpful to use pain scales
to assess the degree of pain that a patient is in—particularly if communication is difficult. The most commonly used tool is a simple visual
analogue pain scale—this consists of a line marked in graduations from
0–10. Ask patients to point to the place on the line which represents
how much pain they are in where 10 is the most possible pain and
0 is no pain.
Examine the patient The cause of the problem may be clear to you
from history alone but examine the patient to confirm/refute your proposed diagnosis.

Timing/pattern Is it worse at any time of day? Is it
associated with any particular activities, e.g. movement,
urination, eating, passing stool, coughing?
Exacerbating and relieving factors

Severity Record, especially if the pain is chronic and you
want to measure change over time. Consider a patient
diary. Ask about:
Pain intensity, e.g. none-mild-moderate-severe; rank on
a 1–10 scale.
• Record interference with sleep or usual activities.
• Pain relief e.g. none-slight-moderate-good-complete.

Figure 9.1 Points to consider when taking a history of pain
• Beware of emergency requests for opioids from patients unknown
to you or your practice.

chapter 9

Chronic disease and elderly care

Principles of pain control
Acute pain Symptom of injured/diseased tissue. Subsides as the injury
heals. Can be worsened by fear. Treat the underlying cause.

Chronic pain Defined as pain persisting for >3–6mo. Affects 77% of

adults in the UK. Cause is often multidimensional—with physical, social,
and psychological factors all contributing to the overall feeling of pain.

Goals of chronic pain management
• Set realistic targets—abolition of pain may be impossible—70% have
pain despite analgesia
• If analgesia is not helping—stop it
• The aim is often rehabilitation with d in distress/disability

Strategies for pain management A multidisciplinary approach is
essential. Consider:
• Prevention, e.g. wrist splints for carpal tunnel syndrome; analgesia
prior to minor surgery
• Removal of cause Treat medical causes of pain, e.g. infection, d blood
sugar (diabetic neuropathy). Refer surgical causes for surgery if surgery
is appropriate, e.g. hip osteoarthritis—joint replacement
• Pain-relieving drugs Start with a single drug at low dose and step up
dose or add another drug as needed. Especially in situations of acute
pain, step down if pain diminishes
• Physical therapies Acupuncture, physiotherapy, or TENS
• Nerve blocks Consider referral for epidural (low back pain), local
nerve block, or sympathectomy (e.g. vascular rest pain)
• Modification of emotional response Psychotropic drugs, e.g.
anxiolytics, antidepressants
• Modification of behavioural response, e.g. back pain—consider
referral to a back rehabilitation scheme
The analgesic ladder Use a step-by-step approach (see Figure 9.2).
Step 1: Non-opioid Start treatment with paracetamol. Stress the need for
REGULAR dosage. Adult dose is 1g every 4–6h (maximum daily dose 4g).
If this is not adequate in 24h, either try an NSAID, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg
tds (if appropriate), alone or in combination with paracetamol, or proceed
to step 2.
Step 2: Weak opioid + non-opioid Start treatment with a combined
preparation of paracetamol + codeine/dihydrocodeine. Combining two
analgesics with different mechanisms of action enables better pain control
than using either alone. Combinations have d dose-related side effects but
the range of side effects is i (additive effects of two drugs). Combinations
using 30mg of codeine (e.g. Solpadol®) are more effective than paracetamol
alone, but it is cheaper and more flexible if constituents are prescribed
separately, e.g. ‘paracetamol 500mg/codeine 30mg’. Advise patients to take
tablets regularly and not to assess efficacy after only a couple of doses.
0 There is no proven additional analgesic benefit for preparations containing paracetamol + 8mg of codeine, compared to paracetamol alone.

Principles of pain control

Step 3: Strong opioid + non-opioid
• Use immediate-release morphine tablets or morphine solution. Two
tablets of co-codamol contain 60mg of codeine which is equi-analgesic
to 76mg of oral morphine. If changing to morphine, use a minimum
dose of 5mg (6mg is hard to prescribe)
• Chronic pain may be only partially opioid-sensitive. Give for a 2wk
trial and only continue if of proven benefit. Worries of tolerance/
addiction are unfounded for patients with true opioid-sensitive pain.
If the pain seems responsive to opioids and there are no undue
side effects, i the dose upwards by 30–50% every 24 h until pain is
controlled—b p. 216
• Take care if the patient is elderly or in renal failure—consider starting
with a d dose of morphine.

Addition of co-analgesics and adjuvant drugs In combination
with analgesics, can enhance pain control. Examples include:
• Antidepressants—In low dose for nerve pain and sleep disturbance
associated with pain; in larger doses for secondary depression
• Anticonvulsants—Neuropathic pain
• Corticosteroids—Pain due to oedema
• Muscle relaxants—Muscle cramp pain
• Antispasmodics—Bowel colic
• Antibiotics—Infection pain
• Night sedative—When lack of sleep is lowering pain threshold
• Anxiolytic—When anxiety is making pain worse (relaxation exercises
may also help in these circumstances)

Referral If unable to remove cause and unable to achieve adequate pain

relief consider referral to a specialist pain control clinic or palliative care
(depending on the context of the pain).

Step 2: Moderate pain
Weak opioids,
e.g. tramadol,
dihydrocodeine
Step 1: Mild pain
Non-opioids, e.g. NSAID
and/or paracetamol

± non-opioid
(paracetamol and/or
NSAID)

Step 3: Severe pain
Strong opioids, e.g.
morphine, diamorphine,
hydromorphone,
buprenorphine,
fentanyl TTS patch
± non-opioid
(paracetamol and/or
NSAID)

Co-analgesics: drugs, nerve blocks, TENS, relaxation, acupuncture
Specific therapies: surgery, physiotherapy
Address psychosocial problems
1 Be aware of secondary gain from pain if symptoms seem out of pro-

portion (outstanding compensation claims are a significant negative factor
in success of pain management).

Chronic disease and elderly care

Pain-relieving drugs
Paracetamol (BNF 4.7.1) As effective a painkiller as ibuprofen. No
anti-inflammatory effect but potent antipyretic. Drug of choice in OA where
inflammation is absent. Side effects are rare but long-term use may i CVD
risk. Dose 1g qds. Overdose (>4g/24 h) can be fatal causing hepatic damage
sometimes not apparent for 4–6d. Inadvertent overdose is easy due to presence of paracetamol in most OTC cold preparations—refer to A&E.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) (BNF 10.1.1) See
Table 9.2. Anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antipyretic. Start at the lowest recommended dose and do not use >1 NSAID concurrently. 60% respond to
any NSAID—for those who do not, another may work.
GI side effects Common (50%) including GI bleeds (25% GI bleeds in UK).
i with age. Risks are dose-related and vary between drugs. For the elderly,
those on steroids or with past history of GI ulceration or indigestion,
protect the stomach with misoprostol or a proton pump inhibitor (PPI).
Selective inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX2) are equally effective but
should not be given to any patient with pre-existing or high risk of CVD.
Other side effects Hypersensitivity reactions (5–10% asthmatics have
bronchospasm); fluid retention (relative contraindication in patients with
i BP/cardiac failure); renal failure (rare—more common in patients with
pre-existing renal disease); hepatic impairment (particularly diclofenac).
0 COX2 inhibitors:
• Have no effect on platelet aggregation, and
• Have no benefit if used in patients on continuous low-dose aspirin
Topical NSAIDs Of proven benefit for acute and chronic conditions and
can be as effective as oral preparations. They have lower incidence of GI
and other side effects although these still occur.

Dosage

Features

Ibuprofen

1.2–1.8g/d in 3–4
divided doses

Fewer side effects than other NSAIDs.
Anti-inflammatory properties are weaker. Do
not use if inflammation is prominent, e.g. gout
Higher doses (>1.2g/d) are associated with i
risk of thrombotic events and MI

Naproxen

0.5–1g/d in 1–2
divided doses

Good efficacy with a low incidence of side,
effects. Associated with lower thrombotic risk
than other NSAIDs

Celecoxib

200mg od/bd

Selective COX2 inhibitor. As effective as nonselective NSAIDs and shares side effects, but risk
of serious upper GI events is lower. Only use if at
low risk of CVD. High risk of other GI side effects

0 Diclofenac carries similar increased risk of CVD as COX2 inhibitors, but has similar risk of
GI events to other NSAIDs. It is no longer recommended for anything other than very shortterm use.

Pain-relieving drugs

Codeine (BNF 4.7.2) Most commonly used weak opioid in the UK. Dose
is 30–60mg every 4h to a maximum of 240mg/24h. Analgesic effect is i by
regular ingestion.
Equipotence with morphine 60mg of codeine 4x/d totals 240mg codeine in
24h. 10mg of codeine is equipotent to 1mg of morphine so the equivalent
morphine dose would be 24mg/24h.
Side effects The most common side effects of codeine include nausea,
vomiting, constipation, and drowsiness (b p. 216). Codeine is effective
for the relief of mild to moderate pain but is too constipating for longterm use. Always consider prescribing a laxative, e.g. bisacodyl 1–2 tablets
nocte, with codeine to prevent constipation.
Reasons for decreased effectiveness
• 5–10% of Caucasians have CYP2D6 genotype. They lack a hepatic
enzyme necessary to convert codeine to morphine and will obtain less
analgesia when taking codeine-containing analgesics
• Effects of codeine are reduced by concurrent use of:
• Antipsychotics, e.g. chlorpromazine, haloperidol
• Metoclopramide
• Tricyclic antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline

Dihydrocodeine Has analgesic efficacy and a side effect profile similar
to that of codeine. The dose of dihydrocodeine by mouth is 30–60mg
every 4h. A 40mg tablet is also available.
Tramadol Is a synthetic analogue of codeine. It is not a controlled drug.
Dose is up to 400mg/24h. Produces analgesia by 2 mechanisms:
• An opioid effect, and
• An enhancement of serotonergic and adrenergic pathways
Advantages over codeine and dihydrocodeine
•	Rapid absorption of oral doses—analgesia in <1h—peaks at 1–2h
• Metabolized in the liver—safer for the elderly/those with renal failure
• Fewer typical opioid side effects (notably, d respiratory depression,
constipation, and addiction potential)
• May have a significant effect on neuropathic pain
Disadvantages
• Psychiatric reactions have been reported
• Nausea and vomiting can be a problem with high doses

Chronic disease and elderly care

Morphine and other strong opioids
Morphine is the strong opioid of first choice for moderate to severe pain
in both malignant and non-malignant conditions.
Starting oral morphine Start with 4-hourly immediate release morphine. Give clear instructions. Initial dosage:
• Adults not pain-controlled with regular weak opioids
(e.g. co-codamol 500/30 two tablets qds) 5–10mg every 4h
• Elderly, cachectic, or not taking regular weak opioids 2.5–5mg every
4h (2.5mg if very elderly/frail)
Titration of dose i dose as needed by 25–50%/d until pain is controlled/
unacceptable side effects. There is no ‘maximum’ daily allowance,
e.g. 5l10l15l20l30l40l60l80l100l130l160l200mg.

Maintenance Once pain is controlled, consider a long-acting preparation of equivalent dose (e.g MST® bd, MXL® od). Calculate total daily dose
of morphine by adding together the 4h doses.
Increasing dose If necessary, use a third to a half dose increments. i dose
rather than frequency as tablets are designed for od or bd dosing.
Breakthrough pain Pain of rapid onset and moderate/severe intensity
despite background analgesia. Management:
• Prescribe immediate release morphine for breakthrough pain—give
the equivalent 4-hourly dose as an additional dose
• If pain starts to occur regularly before the next dose of analgesia is
due, i the regular background dose
Common side effects of opioid drugs Warn patients:
• Nausea/vomiting Affects >1 in 3 patients for the first 2wk of opioid
use. Prescribe a regular antiemetic for 2wk, e.g. haloperidol 1.5mg
nocte. If nausea/vomiting continues, consider an alternative opioid
• Constipation Consider prescribing prophylactic laxatives, e.g.
bisacodyl 1–2 tab, nocte. Fentanyl causes less constipation than
morphine
• Drowsiness/cognitive impairment Usually wears off in <1wk. Advise
not to drive, perform other skilled tasks or work with dangerous
machinery for ≥1wk after starting morphine (longer if drowsiness
persists) or after i in dose. If not improving, consider an alternative
opioid or refer for specialist advice
Conversions to other preparations See Table 9.3.
Reasons to choose/switch to an alternative opioid Unacceptable
side effects; renal failure (fentanyl is licensed for use; oxycodone is safe in
mild/moderate renal failure); patient unable to take oral medication regularly (consider fentanyl or buprenorphine patch, or syringe driver); choice
(morphine is unacceptable for some patients).
Alternative strong opioids Diamorphine; oxycodone; fentanyl;

60 ÷ 7.5 = (60 x 2)÷15 =
8mg hydromorphone in
divided doses over 24h

0 If total 24h dose is equivalent to 360mg morphine or more—get specialist advice.

Opioid toxicity Intentional or unintentional overdose produces:
• Drowsiness or coma
• Vomiting
• Pinpoint pupils
• Hypotension
• Confusion—including auditory and/or visual hallucinations
•	Respiratory depression
• If respiratory rate ≥8/min and the patient is easily rousable and
not cyanosed—adopt a policy of ‘wait and see‘; consider reducing
or omitting the next regular dose of opioid. Stop syringe drivers
temporarily to allow plasma levels to d, then restart at lower dose
• If respiratory rate <8/min, and the patient is barely rousable/
unconscious and/or cyanosed—dilute naloxone 400 microgram
to 10mL with sodium chloride 0.9%. Administer 0.5–1mL IV every
min until respiratory status is satisfactory. If respiratory function
still does not improve, question diagnosis. Further doses may be
needed later, as naloxone is shorter acting than morphine
• Muscle rigidity/myoclonus—consider renal failure (can produce
myoclonus alone). Treat by rehydration, stopping other medication
which may exacerbate myoclonus, switching opioid, or with
clonazepam 2–4mg/24h depending on circumstances
Subacute overdosage Slowly progressive somnolence and respiratory depression—common in patients with renal failure. Withhold morphine for 1–2 doses then reintroduce at 25% lower dose.
Opioid toxicity may be i by
• Dehydration
•	Renal failure
• Other change in disease status, • Other analgesics, e.g. NSAIDs
e.g. hepatic function, weight loss • Co-administration of amitriptyline

Chronic disease and elderly care

Neuropathic pain
Neuropathic pain occurs as a result of damage to neural tissue. Examples
include post-herpetic neuralgia, following shingles, complex regional pain
syndrome (reflex sympathetic dystrophy), peripheral neuropathy (e.g. due
to DM), compression neuropathy, and phantom limb pain.
Pain typically occurs in association with altered sensation, e.g. burning,
stabbing, or numbness. Pain may also be provoked by non-noxious stimuli
(allodynia), e.g. gentle heat or cold.
ManagementN Where possible, treat the underlying cause of the pain.
Otherwise, use a stepped treatment regime—see Figure 9.3.
0 For all drugs listed in Figure 9.3, start at low dose and titrate up the
dose according to response. Consider lidocaine patches for people with
localized pain who are unable to tolerate oral medication.
STEP 3
Refer—try tramadol 50–100mg qds whilst
awaiting assessment
STEP 2
Pregabalin
75–300mg bd

±

Amitriptyline
10–75mg taken at 5–7 p.m.

STEP 1*
Amitriptyline
10–75mg taken at 5–7 p.m.

OR

Pregabalin
75–300mg bd

* For patients with diabetic neuropathy, step 1 is duloxetine 60–120mg/d—b p. 358.

Figure 9.3 Neuropathic pain—steps to pain controlN

Review
After starting/changing medication Perform an early review after 1–2wk
to check dosage titration, tolerability, and adverse effects.
Once established on medication Review regularly every 4–8wk to assess
and monitor effectiveness of treatment. Ask about
• Adverse effects
• Overall perception of
• Sleep
improvement
• d in pain (pain diaries may help)
• Ability to do everyday activities, e.g. work, driving
• Mood—depression/anxiety screening questionnaires may be helpful
If improvement is sustained over ≥6mo, consider gradual d dose of medication over time.
Refer To a specialist pain clinic or other appropriate specialist service if:
• Severe pain or pain significantly limits activities
• Underlying health condition has deteriorated
• Inadequate response to first- or second-line medication

Neuropathic pain

Tricyclic antidepressants
Amitriptyline First-line treatment for neuropathic pain (unlicensed
indication). Start at a dose of 25mg at 5–7 p.m.—10mg if elderly. i dose
by 10–25mg at 5–7 p.m. every 5–7d to a maximum of 75mg in a single dose
as needed (higher doses under specialist supervision). Some patients do
not derive benefit for 4–6 wk.
Alternatives to amitriptyline Nortriptyline and imipramine. Both are given
at an initial dose of 10–25mg in the evening; dose can be titrated up to
75mg as needed. May have fewer side effects than amitriptyline.

Anticonvulsants
Pregabalin Licensed for treatment of neuropathic pain. Initially 150mg/d
in two divided doses, increased if necessary after 3–7d to 300mg daily
in two doses, and increased further if necessary after 7d to a maximum
600mg daily in two divided doses.
Gabapentin Effective for neuropathic pain but has a similar side effect
profile, higher NNT for 30% and 50% pain relief, more complicated dosing
and titration regime, and is less cost-effective than pregabalin.
Carbamazepine Unlicensed for treatment of neuropathic pain and often
poorly tolerated. Traditionally the drug of choice for trigeminal neuralgia.
Start with 100–200mg 1–2x/d (less if elderly or frail). Build up dose slowly
to minimize adverse effects to the usual dose of 0.8–1.2g daily in divided
doses. Oxcarbazepine is an alternative.
0 Both gabapentin and pregabalin are drugs of abuse; monitor frequency
of repeat medication and be careful when issuing prescriptions to temporary residents.

NSAIDs Sometimes effective for neuropathic pain—either because

there is mixed nociceptive pain or because they d inflammatory sensitization of nerves. There is considerable variation in individual patient tolerance and response (b p. 214).

Opioids Neuropathic pain often responds only partially to opioid anal-

gesics. Of the opioids, oxycodone, tramadol, and methadone are probably
the most effective—consider trying tramadol when other measures fail.

Topical lidocaine Plasters impregnated with lidocaine 5% (Versatis™).
Licensed for post-herpetic neuralgia. Apply daily for up to 12h, followed
by a 12h plaster-free period; discontinue if no response after 4wk. Up to 3
plasters may be used to cover large areas; plasters may be cut.

Carers
Who is a carer? A carer is someone of any age who provides unpaid
support to family or friends who could not manage without this help. This
could be caring for a relative, partner, or friend who is ill, frail, disabled, or
has mental health or substance misuse problems. Anyone can become a
carer. 72 million people/y move in/out of caring roles.
Young carers Are children and young people who assume inappropriate
responsibilities to look after someone who has an illness, a disability, or is
affected by mental ill health or substance misuse. Young carers often take
on practical and/or emotional caring responsibilities that would normally
be expected of an adult.
0 Some carers do not regard themselves as carers or may dislike the
label ‘carer’, believing that it can detract from their identity as a parent,
child, partner, or sibling to the person that they care for. It is also important not to confuse carers with paid care workers.

How many carers are there? 12% of adults in the UK are carers.
1.2 million provide care for >50h/wk; those aged >65y account for 1 in 3
of those providing >50h care each week and many have their own health
problems too. There are also around 1 million young carers.
Economic importance Carers save the UK economy 7£119 billion/y
in care costs (£18,473/y for every carer in the UK).
Carers as partners in care Carers know the people that they care
for better than anyone else. Involving carers is important in order to identify problems that may require intervention; plan patient care and improve
concordance with care plans.
What problems do carers have as a result of their roles? Many
carers gain great personal satisfaction from their caring role and want to
continue caring, but they suffer adverse consequences too:
• Psychological i stress and depression/anxiety; abuse from the person
being cared for; young carers have i risk of bullying/self-harm
• Physical health i mortality; i morbidity from CVD; i risk of back and
other musculoskeletal injury
• Social Activity restriction, deterioration of relationships with other
family members, social isolation
• Employment/schooling d ability to work, d promotion prospects,
poor performance, and i absenteeism at school
• Financial The more care provided the more likely a carer is to be in
financial difficulty; 55% are in debt but <50% claim all the benefits they
are eligible for
Supporting carers in general practice See Figure 9.4
Benefits For sickness/disability/carers b p. 222; low income b p. 104
Social services assessment Every carer has a right to ask for a full
assessment of their needs by the social services. Emergency planning to
provide substitute care in the event of a crisis is part of that assessment.

Carers

Step 1:
Identifying a carers lead

Step 3:
Involving carers in patient care
• Ask permission to share
patient information with
carers
• Involve carers in care
planning and care
implementation
• Provide or signpost carers to
training to help them to
perform their caring roles
Step 5:
Providing information/support
• Develop links with local
carers’ organizations
• Encourage carers to apply for
benefits they are eligible for
• Signpost carers to other
sources of information and
support
• Refer carers for social
services carers’ assessment
• Ensure carers have an
emergency plan in place

Step 7:
Auditing and improving carer
support

Step 2:
Finding and recognizing adult and
young carers
• Ask carers to self-identify
• Ask patients to identify their carers
• Opportunistically identify carers in the
surgery, on hospital admission or
discharge, on letters from specialists,
and through the annual flu vaccination
programme
• Search for carers on the practice list
• Record carer status on patient notes

Step 4:
Improving healthcare for carers
• Consider screening carers at least
annually for depression
• Provide flexible appointments for carers
• Invite carers for annual flu vaccinations
• Consider providing other services for
carers, e.g. annual health checks or inpractice specialist carer support
worker sessions

Step 6:
Providing support to young carers
• Include young carers in steps 1–5
• Question why the young person is
taking on a caring role. Does the
person cared for need referral for a
review of care needs?
• Provide age-specific information and
support
• Develop links with local young
carers leads
• Consider referring young carer to
local children’s services assessment

Pensions and benefits
Retirement pension A state retirement pension is currently payable
to people of state pension age, even if still working. Claim forms should
be received automatically—if not, request one through the local Benefits
office. Pensions are taxable. State pension age is gradually increasing—in
women from 60–68y and in men from 65–68y.
Basic pension Flat rate amount—different for single people and married
couples. If not enough National Insurance (NI) contributions have been
paid, amounts may d. >80y, a higher rate is payable which is not dependent
on NI contributions.
Increase for dependants Paid if:
• The claimant’s spouse is <60y and earns under a set amount/does not
receive certain other benefits
• The claimant has children (if claim made before April 2003)
Additional pension State second pension (replaced SERPS). Based on NI
contributions and earnings. Workers can opt out of the additional pension
scheme, pay into a private or company scheme instead and pay lower NI.
Graduated pension Some people may be entitled to a graduated pension.
This is based on earnings between 1961 and 1975.
Extra pension For a person who defers claiming retirement pension for
up to 5y. Extra pension is payable when retirement pension is claimed.
0 If hospitalized, retirement pension is payable for 1y at full rate. After
12mo, basic pension is d but additional pension stays the same.

Pension Credit Apply on form PC1 F 0800 99 1234.
Guarantee credit For anyone older than the women’s state pension
age with income below the ‘appropriate amount’. Appropriate amount
varies according to circumstances. Capital (excluding value of own home)
>£6000 is deemed to count as income at the rate of £1/wk/£500 capital.
Receipt confers automatic eligibility for additional low income benefits
(e.g. housing benefit).
Savings credit ≥ 65y and income > savings credit starting point. Amount
received depends on level of income and circumstances. Savings credit will
be phased out after 2016 when pension rates are being simplified.

• Acute arterial
• Haematoma
• Superficial thrombophlebitis
ischaemia
• Baker’s cyst

• Pneumonitis due to inhalation of toxic substances, e.g. gases, radiation

Cyanosis Dusky blue skin.
Central cyanosis Cyanosis of mucus membranes, e.g. mouth. Causes:
• Lung disease resulting in inadequate oxygen transfer (e.g. COPD, PE,
pleural effusion, severe chest infection)

Symptoms and signs of CVD

• Shunting from pulmonary to systemic circulation (e.g. Fallot’s tetralogy,
PDA, transposition of the great arteries)
• Inadequate oxygen uptake (e.g. met- or sulf-haemoglobinaemia)
Peripheral cyanosis, e.g. cyanosis of fingers. Causes: as for central
cyanosis plus
• Physiological (cold, hypovolaemia)
• Local arterial disease (e.g. Raynaud’s syndrome)
0 Feet can be a dusky blue colour due to venous disease. If this occurs
without central cyanosis it does not imply abnormal oxygen saturation.
Mitral facies Dusky bluish red flushing of the cheeks (a form of peripheral
cyanosis) associated with a low cardiac output.

Clubbing Loss of the angle between nail fold and plate, bulbous finger
tip, and the nail fold feels boggy—b p. 609.
• Refer any patient with unexplained nail clubbing for urgent CXRN.

Jugular venous pressure Observe internal jugular vein at 45° with

head turned slightly to the left. Vertical height is measured in relation to
the sternal angle. Raised if >4cm. Causes of i JVP:
• Fluid overload
• Pulmonary hypertension
• Right heart failure and CCF
• Arrhythmia—AF or atrial flutter,
• SVC obstruction (non-pulsatile)
complete heart block
• Tricuspid or pulmonary valve
• i intrathoracic pressure e.g.
disease
pneumothorax, PE, emphysema
Kussmaul’s sign The JVP usually drops on inspiration along with intrathor­
acic pressure. The reverse pattern is called Kussmaul’s sign. Caused by
raised intrathoracic pressure or constrictive pericarditis.

Signs of infective endocarditis

•
•

Infective Fever, weight d, clubbing, splenomegaly, anaemia
Cardiac Murmurs (particularly new murmurs) ± heart failure
Embolic Neurologic deficit due to stroke
Vasculitic Microscopic haematuria, splinter haemorrhages, conjunctival
haemorrhages, Roth’s spots (retinal vasculitis), Osler’s nodes (painful
lesions on finger pulps), Janeway lesions (palmar macules)

Signs of hypercholesterolaemia
Corneal arcus Whitish opaque line surrounding the margin of the cornea,
separated from it by an area of clear cornea. Rarely congenital—more
commonly occurs bilaterally in patients >50y (arcus senilis). Sometimes
associated with i blood lipids—particularly familial hypercholesterol­
aemias. Check lipids. If lipids are normal, no treatment is needed.
Xanthomata Localized collections of lipid-laden cells. Appear as yellowish coloured lumps. Often caused by i lipids. Commonly seen on the eyelids (xanthelasma), on the skin, or in tendons (appear as mobile nodules
in the tendon).

Cardiology and vascular disease

Examining the heart
Apex beat Normal position is in the 5th intercostal space, in the mid­

clavicular line. Moved sideways/inferiorly if the heart is enlarged (e.g. CCF)
or displaced (e.g. pneumothorax). May not be palpable if the patient is
obese, has hyperexpanded lungs (e.g. COPD), or a pericardial effusion. In
infants/children apex beat is superior/more lateral.
Parasternal heave Detect by placing the heel of the hand over the left
parasternal region. If present, the heel of the hand is lifted off the chest
wall with each heart beat. Causes: usually right ventricular enlargement—
rarely, left atrial enlargement.
Heart sounds See Table 10.2. Low/medium frequency sounds (e.g.
3rd/4th heart sounds) are more easily heard with the bell applied lightly
to the skin. High-frequency sounds (e.g. 1st/2nd heart sounds and opening
snaps) are more easily heard with a diaphragm.
Heart murmurs Due to abnormalities of flow within the heart and
great vessels. Very common. Often incidental findings. Described by:
• Location Where heard loudest
• Quality, e.g. blowing, harsh
• Intensity Graded out of 6 (1—virtually undetectable; 6—heard by an
observer with no stethoscope). Grades 4–6 are usually palpable (thrills)
• Timing Systolic or diastolic, and
• Radiation Does the murmur spread elsewhere, e.g. to axilla, carotids

• Red flag symptoms
• Cyanosis
• Breathlessness

• Lethargy/tiredness
• Collapse

• Weight loss (or
failure to thrive)

Always refer for echo. Differential diagnosis—SeeTable 10.1.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Examination of the arterial system
The main conditions affecting the abdominal and peripheral arteries are:
• Aneurysms (b p. 284)
• Atherosclerosis, resulting in ischaemia of the legs and intermittent
claudication, atrophic changes and/or rest pain
• Embolization resulting in acute ischaemia of the limbs

General scheme
• Look at the limbs—are there any signs of ischaemia? Are the
extremities warm or cold? What colour are they?
• Examine the abdomen looking for a pulsatile mass which might suggest
abdominal aortic aneurysm (b p. 284). Auscultation may reveal a bruit
• Check the peripheral pulses
• Tenderness on palpation of an abdominal aortic aneurysm suggests
need for urgent operative repair.

Blood pressure b p. 246
Carotid pulse Ask the patient to lie supine with head/neck at 45° to
the horizontal. When assessing the carotid pulse, consider:
Rate
• Tachycardia >100bpm—b p. 268
• Bradycardia <60bpm—b p. 272
Rhythm
• Irregularly irregular AF, multiple ectopics
• Regularly irregular 2nd degree heart block
Character and volume Always assess with a central pulse, e.g. carotid or
femoral.
• Small volume—shock, pericardial tamponade, aortic stenosis
(slow-rising)
• Large volume—hyperdynamic circulation (e.g. pregnancy), aortic
incompetence (waterhammer, collapsing pulse), PDA
• Pulsus paradoxus—pulse weakens in inspiration by >10mmHg—
asthma, cardiac tamponade, pericarditis

Carotid bruits May signify stenosis (>30%) often near the origin of internal carotid. Heard best behind the angle of the jaw. Usual cause is atheroma.
Peripheral pulses
Location See Table 10.3.
Examination Check whether each pulse is present. If present check:
• Rate
• Rhythm
• Amplitude
• Compare pulses in the two legs/two arms
Check for radiofemoral delay—palpate radial and femoral pulses simultan­
eously—delay suggests coarctation of the aorta.

Examination of the arterial system

Table 10.3 Location of the limb pulses
Pulse
Brachial

Location
72cm medial to the central point of the antecubital fossa over
the elbow skin crease

Radial

7½–1cm on the radial (lateral) side of the flexor carpi radialis
tendon at the wrist

Femoral

Below inguinal ligament; one-third of the way up from pubic
tubercle

Popliteal

With knee flexed at right angles, palpate deep in the midline

Posterior tibial

1cm behind medial malleolus

Dorsalis pedis

Variable—on the dorsum of the foot just lateral to the tendons
to the big toe 0 Many healthy people have only one foot pulse

Check for bruits over the femoral and/or carotid pulses—these indicate
disturbed blood flow—usually 2° to narrowing due to atherosclerosis.
• Character and waveform of the pulse should only be assessed using the
femoral or carotid pulse.

Signs of ischaemia

Acute ischaemia Acutely pale, cold, and pulseless limb—b p. 1126. Refer
immediately—keep the limb cool in the interim.
Chronic ischaemic changes
• Atrophic skin changes—pallor, cool to the touch, hairless, shiny
• On lowering the leg turns a dusky blue-red colour; on elevation—
pallor and venous guttering
• Ulceration—check under the heel and between the toes
• Swelling suggests the patient is sleeping in a chair to avoid rest pain or,
rarely, pain from deep infection
• Absent foot pulses—if pulses are present, consider alternative
diagnosis
• Ankle–brachial pressure index <0.95

Checking the ankle–brachial pressure index (ABPI)
• Check BP in one arm (b p. 246). The systolic measurement is the
brachial pressure (B)
• Then inflate a BP cuff around the lower calf just above the ankle
• Using a Doppler ultrasound probe, record the maximum cuff
pressure at which the probe can still record a pulse (ankle
pressure—A)
• Calculate the ankle–brachial pressure index by dividing the ankle
pressure by the brachial pressure, i.e. ABPI = A ÷ B
Interpretation of ABPI results
• ABPI <0.8—ischaemia
• ABPI <0.5—critical ischaemia
0 Arterial calcification (e.g. due to DM) can result in falsely elevated
ankle pressure readings.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Cardiac investigations
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Graphic recording of electric potentials generated by the heart. Most
surgeries now have ECG machines that interpret themselves and print
out their findings. Analysis is easier but it is still important to be able to
understand the significance of abnormalities and check computer analysis
in the clinical context.
Interpreting ECGs Many mistakes in ECG interpretation are errors of
omission so a systematic approach is best. Check:
• Standardization (calibration) and technical features (including lead
placement and artefacts)
• Heart rate—usual speed (25mm/s). Each big square represents 0.2s
(small square—0.04s). Rate = 300 ÷ R-R interval (in large squares)
• Rhythm—regular/irregular
• PR interval—normal if <0.2s
• QRS interval—abnormal if >0.12s
• QT interval—varies with rate. At 60bpm normal if 0.35–0.43s
• P waves—present or absent, shape
• QRS voltages—height of complexes—see Table 10.4, b p. 240
• Mean QRS electrical axis—sum of all ventricular forces during
ventricular depolarization. Normal axis: –30° to +120°
• If more –ve = left axis deviation; if more +ve = right axis deviation
• Rule of thumb 1 If the majority of the QRS complex is above the
baseline (+ve) in leads I and II the axis is normal
• Rule of thumb 2 The axis lies at 90° to a QRS complex where the
height above the baseline = height below the baseline
• Precordial R-wave progression
• Abnormal Q waves—>25% of the succeeding R-wave and/or >0.04s wide
• ST segments—elevation/depression, shape
• T waves—height, inversion, shape
• U waves—small, rounded deflection (≤1mm), follows T wave and
usually has the same polarity
Brief guide to common ECG changes See Table 10.4, b p. 240

24h ambulatory ECG ECG monitoring equipment is worn for 24h.
Continuous monitoring may detect intermittent arrhythmia or ischaemia.
Exercise ECG ECG testing whilst the patient undergoes graded exercise on a treadmill/exercise bicycle. Local referral criteria vary. Mortality
71 in 10,000. Used for:
• Diagnosis of IHD—75% have a +ve test; false +ve rate of 75%
• Assessment of exercise tolerance
• Response to treatment
• As a prognostic indicator
• Assessment of exercise-related arrhythmias
Contraindications Recent MI (<7d), unstable angina, electrolyte disturbance,
aortic stenosis, severe heart failure, known left main coronary artery
stenosis, LBBB (may not be possible to interpret the trace).

Cardiac investigations

Cardiac enzymes Biochemical blood assay of molecules released
when the heart is damaged. Used in diagnosis of MI.
• Troponins T and I Preferred markers as more sensitive/specific than CK,
AST, or lactate dehydrogenase. Together with CK, earliest to i after MI
• Creatine kinase (CK)i in MI, muscle damage (e.g. prolonged running
or seizures), after IM injection, and with dermatomyositis (e.g. due to
statins). CK-MB assay may help clarify whether a cardiac event has
occurred <48h previously
• AST 2nd to i   • Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) Last to i
Echocardiogram (echo) Heart USS. Local referral procedures vary.

• 2-dimensional Produces a fan-shaped, cross-sectional, moving, realtime image of the heart. May be transthoracic or transoesophageal.
Used to assess valvular abnormalities and prosthetic heart valves;
aortic aneurysm/dissection; heart failure; pericardial effusion;
masses within the heart; myocardial abnormalities (e.g. aneurysms,
hypertrophy); IHD; congenital heart disease
• M-mode Plotted on a scrolling screen. Stationary structures appear as
straight lines across the screen; moving structures appear as undulating
lines. Usually displayed with an ECG trace to enable identification of
phases of the cardiac cycle. Used to investigate movement of individual
structural elements, e.g. valves, chamber walls
• Doppler Enables flow across valves and ASD/VSDs to be quantified

Cardiac catheterization Refer via 2º care. Involves passing a catheter, usually via the femoral or brachial artery, to the heart. Used to:
• Measure pressures within the heart and great vessels
• Assess oxygen saturation via blood samples
• Perform coronary angiography—contrast is injected into the coronary
arteries to assess their anatomy and/or patency
• Perform intravascular ultrasound
• Perform other procedures, e.g. angioplasty, valvuloplasty, cardiac biopsy
Complications Arrhythmia (0.56%); MI (0.07%); stroke (0.07%); death
(0.14%); haemorrhage at the site of insertion (0.56%); thrombo-embolism;
trauma to heart and vessels; infection.

Radionucleotide imaging Refer via 2° care. Involves IV administration of a γ-emitting radionucleotide and gamma camera monitoring.
• Radionucleotide angiography Uses technetium99m-labelled RBCs to
calculate left ventricular ejection fraction/assess ventricular action
• Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy Uses thallium201 injected IV during
exercise testing to demonstrate areas of poorly perfused myocardium
Cardiac MRI/magnetic resonance angiography Used increasingly

in 2° care to provide detailed structural information about the heart and
rapid angiographic images.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Prevention of coronary heart
disease
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common cause of death in UK
(1 in 4 deaths). Mortality is falling but morbidity rising.
Risk factors for heart disease See Table 10.5.
Primary prevention Aims to stop heart disease developing.
Population strategy Influences factors that i CHD risk in an entire
population, e.g. anti-smoking campaigns. GPs can do this by displaying
health education posters/literature (e.g. in waiting room, practice leaflet).
Health checks for the over 40s There is a national screening programme
for people aged 40–74y in the UK to identify CVD, DM, and cancer earlier
through health checks every 5y. The check provides:
• Lifestyle advice
• Information about cancer screening programmes available in the UK
• CVD risk assessment—including demographic information, family
history, smoking status, alcohol consumption, BMI, BP, and lipid profile
• DM risk stratification—b p. 345
High-risk strategy There are a number of paper-based and computerized
risk scores available to estimate CVD risk (b p. 244). Most only apply to
people aged <75y, who are not diabetic and have no past history of CVD.
Most CVD occurs in individuals of medium risk as that is the largest group.
However individuals at high risk have the most to gain from risk reduction.
This strategy aims to identify individuals with 10y CVD risk ≥20% through
opportunistic screening and health checks and d their risk through lifestyle
modification ± medication.
0 Current risk estimation tools give 10y CVD risk; QRisk-Lifetime is a
new tool based on the Joint British Societies (JBS3) lifetime risk algorithm.
It provides an estimate of lifetime risk but place in management is yet to
be determined (M www.qrisk2/lifetime).
Selection of patients for intervention Is based on overall risk.
• All patients aged >75y, or with a familial monogenic dyslipidaemia are
at high risk
• Most patients with DM are at high risk—b p. 354
• Patients with 10y CVD risk ≥20% are at high risk
0 If the risk score is near the threshold for intervention, consider other
factors that may predispose to CVD and are not included in the score:
• Low socio-economic group
• BMI—risk is i if BMI >40kg/m2
• Is the person already taking antihypertensive/lipid modification therapy?
• Has the person recently stopped smoking?
• Is the person taking antipsychotic medication?
• Are other conditions present that i risk, e.g. CKD, RA, SLE, HIV?

Secondary prevention Aims to stop progression of symptomatic
CHD. 46% people who die from MI are already known to have CHD.
There is strong evidence that targeting patients with CHD for risk factor
modification is effective in d risk of recurrent CHD.

* These 9 factors account for 90% of risk for acute MI.

The GP’s role GPs have a role in:
• Identification of patients who would benefit from primary prevention
• Ensuring patients who are at high risk of atherosclerotic disease
(established CVD, DM, CVD risk ≥ 20% over 10y, elevated BP with
systolic ≥160 and /or diastolic ≥100 and target organ damage,
i total cholesterol:HDL ratio ≥6, familial dyslipidaemia) have ongoing
follow-up through disease registers, routine recall, and follow-up
• Promoting lifestyle modification in at-risk patients
• Ensuring current best care guidelines are followed and treatment
regimes are updated as policies change; this is a major challenge for
primary care as guidelines change frequently and often conflict
• Checking the process through audit

Blood pressure measurement
Taking blood pressure
• Use a validated sphygmomanometer—a list is available on the British
Hypertension Society website (M www.bhsoc.org)
• Regularly maintain and calibrate your sphygmomanometer
• Use a cuff of correct bladder size: most adults—12 x 26cm; large
adults (arm circumference >33cm) – 12 x 40cm; thin adults and
children with arm circumference ≤26cm—10 x 18cm
• Seat the patient comfortably with arm outstretched and supported at
the level of the heart
• Measure BP to the nearest 2mmHg; measure diastolic pressure when
heart sounds completely disappear (K5)—only use the pressure at
which they suddenly muffle (K4) when K5 cannot be determined
• Measure BP in both arms—if the difference in systolic BP is >10mmHg
between the 2 arms, repeat the measurement. A consistent difference of
>10mmHg is an independent risk factor for CVD and all-cause mortality;
treat identified CVD risk factors. Use the higher of the 2 readings when
considering further management of BP
0 Automated devices may not measure BP accurately if there is pulse
irregularity (e.g. AF). Check the radial or brachial pulse before checking
BP and measure BP manually using direct auscultation over the brachial
artery if pulse is irregular.
‘White coat’ hypertension Prevalence 10%. Some patients’ BP increases
in response to having their BP checked.
If BP is ≥140/90mmHg in the consultation
• Take a second measurement—if that measurement is substantially
different from the first measurement, take a third measurement;
record the lower of these measurements as the BP
• If BP on repeat testing is ≥140/90mmHg and not known to be
hypertensive, offer ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) or home BP
monitoring (HBPM) to confirm the diagnosis; consider ABPM or
HBPM monitoring (HBPM) for people on antihypertensive medication
who are known to have ‘white coat’ hypertension
• If hypertension is not confirmed on ABPM/HBPM, measure BP every
5y or more frequently if close to 140/90 mmHg
• If the person has severe hypertension (systolic BP ≥180mmHg or
diastolic BP ≥110mmHg, consider starting antihypertensive treatment
immediately without waiting for the result of ABPM/HBPM.
Refer for same day specialist assessment if suspected:
• Accelerated hypertension (BP >180/110mmHg ± papilloedema ±
retinal haemorrhage) or
• Phaeochromocytoma (labile/postural hypotension, headache,
palpitations, pallor, and excessive sweating)

Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) A BP-measuring device is worn
on the body for 24h. It takes BP every 20min in the daytime and less frequently
(usually hourly) at night. i BP readings on ABPM are more strongly correlated
to end-organ damage than one-off measurements. ABPM is used for:

Blood pressure measurement

• The diagnosis of hypertension (b p. 248)
• Diagnosis or exclusion of ‘white coat’ hypertension
• Monitoring of response to treatment
• Assessing medication-related postural hypotension
Interpretation ABPM is considered abnormal if:
• Average daytime ABPM is ≥135/85mmHg
• Average night-time ABPM is ≥120/70mmHg
0 NICE bases the diagnosis of hypertension on average daytime ABPM
only (minimum 14 readings).
Night-time ABPM BP falls at night in normotensive individuals. Some
hypertensive patients are described as ‘non-dippers’. This means that their
BP does not fall at night and is associated with i risk of target end-organ
damage. Conversely, some hypertensive patients have excessive dips in
their BP at night (>10%); this is associated with i CVD events.
Home BP monitoring (HBPM) Useful:
• If ABPM facilities are not available within a reasonable time frame for
diagnosis of hypertension
• For patients who cannot tolerate ABPM, and
• For monitoring of antihypertensive treatment
Instructions Patients should use a validated and calibrated BP machine.
• Measure BP on at least 4—and preferably 7—consecutive days
• Measure BP 2x/d (morning and evening) when seated; take two
readings >1min apart
• Discard the readings taken on day 1 and take an average value of all
the remaining measurements
Interpretation HBPM is abnormal if average is ≥135/85mmHg.
Hypertension b p. 248
Cardiogenic shock b p. 1074
Postural hypotension BP drops on moving from supine, or sitting,
position to standing position. Presents with falls, postural dizziness, and/
or light-headedness. Measure BP supine or seated and then ask the patient
to stand up. Re-measure BP after 1min standing. Standing usually causes
a slight d in the systolic BP (<20mmHg) and a slight i in the diastolic BP
(<10mmHg). In postural hypotension there is usually a marked d in both
systolic (>20mmHg) and diastolic BP.
• Review medication Stop any non-essential medication contributing to
symptoms, e.g. night sedation, unnecessary diuretics
• Optimize treatment of intercurrent heart disease, Parkinson’s
disease, or DM
• Advise patients to take care when standing—especially if getting up
from their beds or out of a hot bath/shower, and after meals
Measure subsequent BP with the patient standing. Consider specialist
referral if symptoms persist despite GP management.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Hypertension
Hypertension is a major risk factor for CVD. It is normally symptomless
until it causes organ damage. Prevalence i with age; 25% of all adults and
>50% of people aged >60y have hypertension. Management aims to detect
and treat i BP before damage occurs.

Causes
• Unknown (‘essential’)—95%; alcohol (10%) or obesity may be
contributory factors
• Renal disease—b p. 438
• Endocrine disease—Cushing’s (both syndrome and 2° to
steroids); Conn’s syndrome; phaeochromocytoma; acromegaly;
hyperparathyroidism; DM—b p. 355
• Pregnancy—b p. 826
• Coarctation of the aorta—b p. 282

Presentation
• Usually asymptomatic and found during routine BP screening or
incidentally. Occasionally headache or visual disturbance
• May be symptoms of end-organ damage—LVH, TIAs, previous CVA/
MI, angina, renal impairment, PVD
Measurement of blood pressure b p. 246
Diagnosis of hypertension BP is a normally distributed continuous variable; each 2mmHg i in systolic BP is associated with a 7% i risk of mortality
from IHD and a 10% i risk of mortality from stroke. There is no figure above
which hypertension can be diagnosed definitively. Criteria currently in useN:
• Stage 1 hypertension Clinic BP ≥140/90mmHg and subsequent
daytime average ABPM/HBPM ≥135/85mmHg
• Stage 2 hypertension Clinic BP ≥160/100mmHg and subsequent
daytime average ABPM/HBPM ≥150/95mmHg
• Severe hypertension Clinic systolic BP ≥180mmHg or clinic diastolic
BP ≥110mmHg
• If the person has severe hypertension (systolic BP ≥180mmHg or
diastolic BP ≥110mmHg) consider starting antihypertensive treatment
immediately without waiting for the result of ABPM/HBPM.
Refer for same day specialist assessment if suspected:
• Accelerated hypertension (BP >180/110mmHg ± papilloedema ±
retinal haemorrhage) or
• Phaeochromocytoma (labile/postural hypotension, headache,
palpitations, pallor, and excessive sweating)

Isolated systolic hypertension Systolic BP ≥160mmHg—offer the
same treatment as people with i systolic and diastolic blood pressure.
Further assessment Aims to identify target organ damage:
• Examination Check heart size, heart sounds, and for heart failure;
examine the fundi, looking for silver wiring, AV nipping, flame
haemorrhages, and cotton wool spots
• Blood tests Creatinine, electrolytes, eGFR, glucose/HbA1c, lipid
profile; consider GGT if excess alcohol is a possibility

Hypertension

• Urine Dipstick for RBCs and protein; laboratory sample for
albumin:creatinine ratio
• Cardiovascular risk estimation b p. 244
• ECG ± echo (if left ventricular hypertrophy is suspected)
0 If i BP is not diagnosed but there is evidence of target organ damage
(e.g. LVH, proteinuria) look for alternative causes.
Education Patients will not take tablets regularly, be motivated to change
lifestyle, or turn up for regular checks if they do not understand why treating
their i BP is important. Conversely, some patients who were fit and well
prior to their diagnosis will assume a sick role unless it is explained that they
are well and treatment is designed to stop illness developing. Back up verbal
information with written information that patients can take home; reinforce
information at follow-up and offer opportunities for discussion. Do not forget to warn patients about possible side effects of any medications.
Lifestyle advice Offer lifestyle advice to all patients with a diagnosis
of hypertension and those with FH of i BP. Reinforce advice with written
information:
• Offer smoking cessation advice and help (b p. 182)
• d weight to optimum for height (b p. 178)
• Encourage regular ­exercise—dynamic is best, e.g. walking, swimming,
cycling (b p. 180)
• d alcohol to <21u/wk for 4 and <14u/wk for 5 (b p. 184)
• d dietary salt intake (aim for <6g salt/d)
• i dietary fruit and vegetable intake—aim for ≥5 portions/d
• d excess coffee consumption and other caffeine-rich products
• Encourage relaxation and stress management
• Do not offer Ca2+, Mg2+, or K+ supplements as a method to d BP
Statin (b p. 253). Prescribe:
• If hypertension complicated by CVD irrespective of baseline
cholesterol or LDL levels or
• For primary prevention in patients >40y with hypertension and 10y
CVD risk ≥20%

Initiating antihypertensive drug treatment
Stage 1 hypertension Offer drug treatment if <80y of age and ≥1 of:
• DM
• Target organ damage
• 10y CVD risk ≥20%
• Established CVD
• Renal disease
Stage 2 hypertension Offer drug treatment to all patients.
0 If aged <40y with stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of target organ
damage, CVD, renal disease, or DM, consider specialist referral to exclude
2° causes of hypertension and for detailed estimation of CVD risk.

General rules for antihypertensive drug treatment
• If a drug is not tolerated Stop; move to the next line of therapy
• If a drug is tolerated but the BP target is not met Add in the next
line of therapy
• Where possible Recommend treatment with drugs taken only once a
day and prescribe non-proprietary drugs which minimize cost

Choice of antihypertensive drug(s) See Figure 10.3, b p. 251.
0 Side effects of drug treatment for hypertension are common. 40–50%
started on an antihypertensive drug discontinue regardless of which class
of drug is used. 80% of side effects are seen in first year of treatment.
Treatment targets
Non-diabetic patients without CKD
• Clinic BP <140/90mmHg (<150/90mmHg if aged ≥80y)
• ABPM/HBPM (e.g. for patients with ‘white coat’ hypertension) average
daytime BP <135/85mmHg (<145/85mmHg if aged ≥80y)
Diabetic patients (b p. 355)
• <140/80mmHg—uncomplicated type 2 DM
• <135/85mmHg—uncomplicated type 1 DM
• <130/80mmHg—if any renal, foot, eye, or cardiovascular complications
of type 1 or type 2 DM
CKD Aim for BP <130/80mmHg (b p. 440).
Follow-up Regular review of patients with i BP is essential.
Review interval Depends on stability of BP:
• After starting treatment Review after 1mo
• If BP is controlled Review after a further 3mo, then every 3–6 mo
• If BP is not controlled Bring the patient back to repeat the BP reading
and/or ask for ABPM/HBPM. Do not alter medication on the strength
of a single BP reading. If i BP is sustained, alter medication. Review in
the same way monthly until BP is controlled
Format of the annual review
• Check BP and look for signs of end-organ failure—including annual
urine test for proteinuria
• Discuss symptoms and medication
• Assess and treat other modifiable risk factors for CHD/CVA
• Reinforce lifestyle advice

Reducing or stopping treatment d BP too far (<120/80) may i
morbidity (e.g. as a result of postural hypotension and falls)—particularly
in the elderly:
• Do not stop medication if high CVD risk or end-organ damage
• If diastolic BP <80 and systolic BP <140 consistently, consider d or
stopping medication; 1–2y after withdrawal of medication 50% are
normotensive and 40% stay off drug therapy permanently
• Continue BP follow-up life-long even if off medication

Step 1: Age <55y
Offer ACE inhibitor (or ARB if ACE
inhibitor not tolerated)

Step 1: Age ≥55y or of African or
Caribbean family origin (any age)
Offer a calcium channel blocker (or

Cardiology and vascular disease

Hyperlipidaemia
Average cholesterol level in a population is a predictor of CVD risk and
dependent on diet but, on an individual level, it is a much poorer predictor—only 42% who develop CVD have i cholesterol. However, lowering
LDL and raising HDL d progression of coronary atherosclerosis—whatever the age of the patient—and is a valuable tool for both primary and
secondary prevention of CVD.

Cholesterol Fatty substance manufactured by the body (mainly liver)
which plays a vital role in functioning of cell membranes. Total plasma
cholesterol consists of:
• LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol High levels are associated
with i risk CVD
• HDL (high-density lipoprotein) cholesterol Low levels are associated
with i risk CVD
• Triglycerides (TGs) Independent risk factor for CVD. If >5 mmol/L,
refer for specialist opinion
• Ratio of total cholesterol:HDL Used to predict risk. No threshold—
the higher the ratio, the greater the risk. High risk if ≥6
Testing for hyperlipidaemia Blood cholesterol concentration is not
steady over time. 1 in 4 i cholesterol levels are normal on repeat testing.
Check ≥2 samples at different times:
• Before initiating treatment or if screening for familial dyslipidaemia
Take fasting samples, checking total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL
cholesterol, and triglycerides
• Screening and routine follow up Take non-fasting samples, testing
total blood cholesterol and total cholesterol:HDL ratio
Primary prevention In the UK, the NHS provides 5-yearly health checks
for those aged 40–74y (b p. 242). This includes a lipid profile. There are
a number of potential problems with this strategy:
• Those most needing a health check are least likely to attend
• There may be less inclination to eat a healthy diet if cholesterol levels
are known to be normal
• Those with i cholesterol levels may assume a sick role
Repeat lipid levels with attention to diet if lipid levels are found to be high
on screening. Only treat with statin if lipids remain high despite low cholesterol diet and 10y CVD risk is ≥20%. Continue to offer opportunistic
screening to those with other risk factors for CVD or signs of i cholesterol (e.g. corneal arcus <50y, xanthelasma, xanthomata).
Screening for familial hyperlipidaemia Screen first-degree blood relatives
aged >18y every 5y with fasting lipids if:
• FH of familial hyperlipidaemia
• FH of premature CVD (men <55y, women <65y) or other
atherosclerotic disease
Secondary prevention For all those who have proven CVD, check
cholesterol levels annually.

Calculating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk Always consider
i cholesterol in the context of other risk factors for CVD—b p. 244.

Non-drug therapy Offer to all patients with i cholesterol and i CVD
risk, and those with DM or FH of CHD/CVD. Reinforce advice with written information.
• d intake of fats to <30% of total energy intake (saturated fats <10%)
and d cholesterol intake to <300mg/d. Replace saturated fats with
monounsaturated/polyunsaturated fats. If cholesterol level >5mmol/L,
low-cholesterol diets result in average d in cholesterol of 8.5% at 3mo
• Eat ≥5 portions of fruit or vegetables/d and ≥2 portions of fish/wk including
one of oily fish (maximum two portions of oily fish/wk if pregnant)
• d alcohol intake to <3–4u/d (4) or <2–3u/d (5)
• Weight d—in patients with BMI ≥30kg/m2, weight d of 10kg l 7% d in
LDL and 13% i in HDL
• i physical activity—enhances cholesterol-lowering effects of diet and
weight d. Advise 30min moderate exercise ≥5x/wk
• Stop smoking (b p. 182)
0 Foods enriched with plant sterol/stanol esters inhibit cholesterol
absorption from the GI tract and can d serum cholesterol in those on an
average diet by 10%. Effect on individuals already on a low-fat diet is less
and effect on CVD risk is unknown.
Who should be treated with a statin? Consider statin therapy for:
• Primary prevention If ≥20% 10y CVD risk (including adjustments for
high-risk ethnic groups and family history), aged >75y or DM (aged
>40y or with additional risk factors—b p. 354)—start treatment after
optimizing lifestyle intervention and treatment of other modifiable risk
factors/secondary causes of dyslipidaemia
• Secondary prevention If history of CVD—start treatment
immediately, irrespective of initial cholesterol levels

Before starting treatment Assess:
• Fasting total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and
triglycerides (if fasting levels not already available)
• Fasting blood glucose
• Liver function (transaminases)
• Renal function
• TSH if dyslipidaemia is present

253

254

chapter 10

Cardiology and vascular disease

Factors to consider before starting a statin
• Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy, breastfeeding, and for those
with active liver disease. Transaminases that are i but <3x upper limit
of normal are not a contraindication
• Important drug interactions—i effect warfarin; i risk myositis when
taken with other lipid-lowering drugs, macrolide antibiotics (e.g.
erythromycin), calcium channel blockers, or ciclosporin
• Statins are most effective taken in the evening

Primary prevention (except DM)
• Start a low-cost statin, e.g. simvastatin 40mg or atorvastatin 20mg nocte
• There is no target level for total or LDL cholesterol for primary prevention
• Check liver function 3mo and 1y after initiating the statin; do not
recheck again unless clinically indicated
• Do not recheck lipid levels
• Review drug therapy at least annually; if statins are not tolerated,
consider a fibrate, anion exchange resin, or ezitimibe

Secondary prevention and DM
• Start low-cost statin, e.g. simvastatin 40mg od or atorvastatin 20mg od;
if acute coronary syndrome, a higher intensity statin may be used
• Aim to d total cholesterol by 25% or to <4mmol/L—whichever is the
lower value—and to d LDL cholesterol by 30% or to < 2.0 mmol/L—
whichever is the lower value
• Measure total cholesterol (non-fasting) 3mo after starting treatment or
after any dose change; if stable measure 6–12 monthly
• Consider i dose of statin if target lipid levels are not met
• Check liver function 3mo and 1y after initiating statin therapy. Do not
recheck again unless clinically indicated
• If statins are not tolerated, consider fibrate, anion exchange resin,
nicotinic acid (not for DM), or ezetimibe
0 <50% will achieve total cholesterol <4mmol/L or LDL cholesterol
<2mmol/L. Use an ‘audit’ standard of total cholesterol <5mmol/L.
Benefits of statinsM NNT to prevent 1 adverse event is:
• Primary prevention—34.5
• Secondary prevention—13.8
For each mmol/L d in LDL
• Major coronary events d 23%
• First stroke d 17%
• CHD death d19%
• Overall death rate d 12%

Adverse effects of statins
Myositis The most important adverse effect of statins (11/100,000 person
years). Ask patients to report unexplained muscle pain/weakness. If this
occurs check CK—if >5x upper limit of normal, withdraw therapy.
Peripheral neuropathy Stop statins and seek specialist advice if
unexplained peripheral neuropathy develops (12/100,000 person years).
Abnormal liver function Discontinue if serum transaminase i (and stays
at) >3x normal.

Hyperlipidaemia

• Simvastatin In 2010 the MHRA issued a warning about i risk of
myopathy with 80mg doses of simvastatin. Consider simvastatin 80mg
only if severe hypercholesterolaemia and high risk of cardiovascular
complications in patients who have not achieved their treatment goals
on lower doses, when benefits outweigh risks.
In August 2012, the MHRA issued a further warning about drug interactions with simvastatin that i the likelihood of myopathy:
• Avoid simvastatin completely when treating patients already
taking itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole, erythromycin,
clarithromycin, telithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors (e.g. nelfinavir),
nefazodone, ciclosporin, danazol, or gemfibrozil
• Do not exceed a simvastatin dose of 10mg daily if taking other
fibrates (except fenofibrate)
• Do not exceed a simvastatin dose of 20mg daily if taking
amiodarone, amlodipine, verapamil, or diltiazem
• Consider temporarily stopping simvastatin if using fusidic acid
• Advise patients taking simvastatin to avoid drinking grapefruit juice
completely

Familial hyperlipidaemia There are many types of familial dyslipid­
aemia. If suspected, refer. Common forms include:
• Polygenic hypercholesterolaemia Most common form of familial dyslipid­
aemia. Presents with FH of premature CHD + i total cholesterol >6.5mmol/L
• Familial combined hyperlipidaemia Polygenic hyperlipidaemia
affecting 0.5–1% of the population and 715% of those suffering MI
aged <60y. Associated with obesity, insulin resistance/DM, i BP,
xanthelasma, corneal arcus, and premature IHD. i total cholesterol
(6.5–10 mmol/L); i TGs (2.3–12 mmol/L)
• Familial hypercholesterolaemia (type IIa) Autosomal dominant. The
heterozygous form is present in 1 in 500 individuals. Associated with
tendon xanthomata and FH of premature IHD. i LDL (>4.9mmol/L);
i total cholesterol (>7.5mmol/L); normal TGs
• Familial hypertriglyceridaemia (type IV/V) Autosomal dominant. Affects
71% of the general population and 75% of those having MI < aged 60y.
Associated with DM, obesity, gout, eruptive xanthomas, and pancreatitis.
Normal (or slightly i) total cholesterol; i TGs (2.3–>10mmol/L)

Angina
Affects 8% 4 and 3% 5 in the UK. Incidence i with age. Coronary artery
disease is the most common cause. Rarer causes include HOCM, valve
disease, hypoperfusion during arrhythmia, arteritis, anaemia, or thyrotoxicosis. Mortality (usually sudden death or after acute coronary syndrome
or LVF) is 70.5–4%/y—doubled if coexistent left ventricular dysfunction.

Chest pain of recent onset b p. 1080
Presentation of stable angina Diagnosis is usually made on history:

• Pain Episodic central-crushing or band-like chest pain that may radiate
l jaw/neck and/or one or both arms. Pain in the arms/neck may be
the only symptom. Ask about frequency, severity, duration, and timing
• Precipitating/relieving factors Precipitated by exertion, cold, emotion,
and/or heavy meals. Pain stops with rest or GTN spray
• Associated symptoms Pain may be associated with palpitations,
sweating, nausea, and/or breathlessness during attacks
• Presence of risk factors Smoking history; family history; history of
other vascular disease, e.g. CVA/TIA, peripheral vascular disease

Examination There are usually no physical signs although anaemia may

exacerbate symptoms. Check BMI and BP. Look for murmurs (especially
ejection systolic murmur of aortic stenosis) and evidence of peripheral
vascular disease and carotid bruits (especially in patients with DM).

First-line investigations
• Blood FBC, fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose. Consider checking
ESR (to exclude arteritis) and TFTs if clinical suspicion of thyrotoxicosis
• 12-lead resting ECG Provides information on rhythm, presence of
heart block, previous MI, myocardial hypertrophy, and/or ischaemia
0 A normal ECG does not exclude coronary artery disease, but an
abnormal ECG identifies those at higher risk of cardiac events in the next
year—consider referral for further investigation.

Differential diagnosis Chest pain—b p. 1080.
Referral of patients with suspected stable angina For patients

with new onset intermittent chest pains, refer to a rapid access chest pain
clinic for prompt specialist assessment to:
• Confirm/refute angina
• Perform an exercise ECG (b p. 238) and/or other investigations as
appropriate, and
• Provide information on treatment options available, including the
merits of revascularization for the individual
0 Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease (e.g. previous MI, valve disease, cardiomyopathy) are often excluded from rapid access chest pain
clinic referral. Refer to cardiology direct.

Management of patients with stable angina
General advice
• Information about angina and its treatment
• Driving b p. 131

Angina

• Occupation May not be able to undertake heavy work—give advice/
support. Special rules apply to some occupations, e.g. merchant
seamen, airline pilots—advise patients to consult occupational health
Non-drug treatment Aimed at secondary prevention of CHD:
• Smoking cessation—b p. 182
• Hypertension Check BP and treat if >140/90—b p. 248
• Diet Advise healthy diet (oily fish, low cholesterol, i fruit and
vegetables, d salt) and, if obese, aim to d weight until BMI <25kg/m2
• Alcohol d excess consumption. Targets: <3u/d 4; <2u/d 5
• Exercise i aerobic exercise within the limits set by the disease state
• Diabetes Treat any underlying DM—b p. 348–53
• Cardiac rehabilitation May be helpful for patients with angina and/or
after surgery
Drug treatment b p. 258
Referral to cardiology E = Admit; U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine.
• Unstable angina/rapidly progressive symptoms—E
• Aortic stenosis with angina—U
• Angina following MI—U/S
• Abnormal ECG at diagnosis—U/S
• Angina not controlled by medication with two drugs—U/S/R
• If diagnosis is in doubt—S/R
• Strong family history—R
• Other factors, e.g. occupation affected—R

Unstable angina Pain on minimal or no exertion, pain at rest (may
occur at night), or angina which is rapidly worsening in intensity, frequency, or duration. Incidence: 6/10,000/y; 15% suffer MI in <1mo.
Management Urgent referral to cardiology. Admit if attacks are
severe, occur at rest or last >10min even with GTN spray.

Surgical intervention Consider referral for coronary revasculariza-

tion with bypass surgery (CABG) or percutaneous intervention (PCI) if
symptoms are not controlled with anti-anginal drug intervention (two
drugs). Both procedures d symptoms, but CABG confers a survival advantage if DM, age >65y, left anterior descending (LAD) artery disease, or
complex 3-vessel disease.
Prinzmetal (variant) angina Angina at rest resulting from coronary
artery spasm. ECG shows ST elevation. Refer to cardiology to exclude MI and
atherosclerotic angina. GTN alleviates immediate episodes. Calcium channel
blockers are used to prevent angina. M. Prinzmetal (1908–87)—US cardiologist.
Cardiac syndrome X Ongoing angina symptoms despite normal coronary angiography. Treat with β-blockers and/or calcium channel blockers
(if effective) but not secondary prevention agents.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Drug treatment of angina
Symptom control BNF 2.6
As required medication
• Glyceryl trinitrate (GTN) spray is used for ‘as required’ symptom relief
for angina
• Advise 1–2 puffs as needed in response to pain and before engaging in
activities that bring on pain
• Warn about side effects—flushing, headaches, and light-headedness
(sit down or find something to hold onto if this occurs)
• If used for chest pain, advise patients to repeat the dose of GTN after
5min if the pain has not gone and to call for an emergency ambulance if
the pain has not gone 5min after the second dose.
Regular treatment Drugs for regular symptomatic treatment—see Table
10.6. Within any drug class use the cheapest preparation that the patient can
tolerate, will comply with, and which controls symptoms. Assess response
every 2–4wk after initiating/changing drug therapy.
• First-line agent β-blocker or calcium channel blocker—choice
depends on co-morbidites, contraindications, and patient preference
• If treatment is ineffective/not tolerated Switch to whichever
first-line agent has not been tried and/or combine a β-blocker and
dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker
Alternative regular treatments Include long-acting nitrates, ivabradine,
nicorandil, and ranolazine. Consider:
• Monotherapy if both first-line agents (β-blockers and calcium channel
blockers) are contraindicated or not tolerated
• In combination with a first-line agent if symptoms are not controlled
with one first-line agent alone and the other first-line agent is
contraindicated or not tolerated
• As a third anti-anginal agent if symptoms are not controlled with two
anti-anginal drugs and the person is either not suitable for CABG/PCI
or is awaiting CABG/PCI

Secondary prevention
Aspirin d mortality by 34%. Unless contraindicated, give 75mg od to all
patients with angina. Consider clopidogrel 75mg od if aspirin intolerant.
Statin d in total cholesterol and LDL by 25–35% using statin therapy l
d CHD mortality by 25–35%. Trial data suggest all patients with proven
CHD benefit from d in total cholesterol and LDL irrespective of initial
cholesterol concentration—b p. 253.
ACE inhibitors Significantly d cardiovascular deaths (RR 0.83) and all-cause
mortality (RR 0.87) even in the absence of left ventricular dysfunction.

Drug treatment of angina

Table 10.6 Drug treatment of angina
Drug

Treatment notes

β-blockers
BNF 2.4
0 May accumulate
in patients with renal
failure—d dose

Effective for symptom control and to prevent vascular
events. Check fully β-blocked by monitoring heart
rate—resting heart rate ≤65bpm; post-exercise (e.g.
walking up two flights of stairs) heart rate ≤90bpm
Further i in dose once adequately β-blocked are
usually unhelpful
Warn patients not to stop suddenly or run out. If the
patient needs to stop the drug, tail off over 4wk
In patients with asthma/COPD in whom β-blockade is
essential, use cardio-selective β-blockers (e.g. atenolol,
bisoprolol, metoprolol, nebivolol) with care
In patients with left ventricular failure, start at very low
dose and titrate dose over weeks/months

Dihydropyridine
calcium channel
blockers

e.g. amlodipine, felodipine
All equally effective in symptom control. No evidence
of cardioprotective effect
Contraindications: vary. Do not use if aortic stenosis,
<1mo post-MI or uncontrolled heart failure except
with specialist advice

BNF 2.6.2
Rate-limiting calcium
channel blockers

e.g. diltiazem, verapamil
Contraindications: avoid if heart block or heart failure

BNF 2.6.2

• Do not combine with β-blockers

Long-acting nitrates

e.g. isosorbide mononitrate (ISMO)
Oral and patch preparations (dosages ≥10mg/24h) are
available. Start with a low dose and i as tolerated.
Side effects are common
Side effects: headache, postural hypotension, and
dizziness—wear off with use. Reflex tachycardia may
d coronary blood flow and worsen angina
Tolerance: many patients rapidly develop tolerance with
d therapeutic effect. To avoid this allow a nitrate-free
period of 4–8h/d overnight by removing patches at
night or giving the 2nd dose of ISMO at 4 p.m.
Contraindications: HOCM, aortic stenosis, constrictive
pericarditis, mitral stenosis, severe anaemia,
closed-angle glaucoma

BNF 2.6.1

Potassium channel
activator
BNF 2.6.3

e.g. nicorandil
Headache is common—usually transitory
Contraindications: left ventricular failure; hypotension

Ivabradine
BNF 2.6.3

Lowers the heart rate by its action on the sinus node
Contraindications: avoid if heart rate <60bpm, heart
block, or heart failure

Ranolazine
BNF 2.6.3

Affects sodium-dependent calcium channels
Contraindications: renal/liver failure; use with caution if
CCF or weight <60kg

After myocardial infarction
Acute coronary syndrome b p. 1082
Modification of risk factors after MI Secondary prevention:
• Cholesterol All patients with proven CHD benefit from d in total
cholesterol and LDL, irrespective of initial cholesterol concentration.
d in total cholesterol and LDL by 25–35% using statin therapy reults in
25–35% d in CHD mortality. Serum cholesterol levels d after MI and
remain d for several weeks
• β-blockers Unless contraindicated, start all patients on an oral β-blocker
(e.g.atenolol) soon after MI and continue indefinitely. Estimated to prevent
12 deaths/1,000 treated/y. If β-blockers are contraindicated, a rate-limiting
calcium channel blocker (e.g. diltiazem or verapamil) is an alternative
ACE inhibitors d myocardial work and deaths <1mo post-MI by
5/1,000 treated. Survival advantage is sustained >1y even if treatment is
not continued long-term. Effects are greater for patients with heart failure
at presentation. Long-term ACE inhibitors: trials show d mortality for all
patients. If ACE inhibitors are not tolerated, use ARB instead.
Antiplatelet medication
Aspirin Starting aspirin 75mg od <24h after MI prevents 80 vascular events
over the next 2y/1,000 patients treated. Unless contraindicated, continue
life-long.
Clopidogrel 75mg od—prescribe in addition to aspirin for:
• 12mo if non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI)/unstable angina
• 1mo following ST elevation MI (STEMI) with no coronary stenting
• 3mo following STEMI with bare metal stenting
• 12mo following STEMI with drug-eluting stenting
Alternatives to clopidogrel In certain circumstances, newer antiplatelet
agents (e.g. prasugrel or ticagrelor) may be used in combination with
aspirin after ACS.

Anticoagulation Occasionally required if AF, left ventricular aneur­ysm
or if clopidogrel/aspirin are not tolerated.

Heart failure/left ventricular dysfunction For patients who have

had an acute MI and have symptoms/signs of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction <0.4), treatment with an
aldosterone antagonist (e.g. spironolactone 25mg od, increasing in <1mo
to 50mg od) should be initiated within 3–14d of the MI, preferably after
ACE inhibitor therapy.
Treatment of angina b p. 258
Exercise testing Routine exercise testing (usually before discharge
from hospital) identifies those likely to have angina post-MI who might
benefit from early angiography ± angioplasty/stenting or CABG.

Cardiac rehabilitation d risk of death by 20–25%. Provided by specialist multidisciplinary teams. Component include: psychological support,
information about CHD, structured exercise programme, and modification of other risk factors.

After myocardial infarction

GP support after discharge
Return to work Guide:
• Sedentary workers: 4–6wk after uncomplicated MI
• Light manual workers: 6–8wk after uncomplicated MI
• Heavy manual workers: 3mo after uncomplicated MI
Physical activity Advise gradual i in activity. Ensure goals given match
those given by local cardiac rehabilitation. Guide:
• Up to 2wk—stroll in garden or street
• From 2–6wk—walk 0.5 mile/d aiming to i to 2 miles/d by 6wk
• From 6wk—i speed of walking; aim 2 miles in <30min
Sexual activity Resume after 6wk. A leaflet is available from the British
Heart Foundation.
Psychological effects 8 50% are depressed 1wk after MI and 25% after
1y. Educate about CHD. Check for depression (b p. 199), counsel, and
treat as needed.
Driving b p. 131
Flying Most airlines will not carry passengers for 2wk after MI and then
only if able to climb 1 flight of stairs without difficulty.

Ongoing GP follow-up
Monitoring health Continue regular reviews at least annually life-long.
Check for symptoms and signs of cardiac dysfunction (breathlessness, palpitations, angina); depression; carer stress.
Monitoring drug therapy Ongoing prescription of drugs, monitoring of
compliance and side effects, changing medication if clinical circumstances
or best practice alter.
Secondary prevention
• Smoking cessation b p. 182. d risk of death by 50% over 15y
• Hypertension Check BP and treat if >140/90—b p. 248
• Diet Advise healthy diet (low cholesterol, i fruit and vegetables,

fish oil supplements in d risk of further MI is controversial—recent
meta-analysis suggests there is no effect
• Alcohol d excess consumption. Targets: <3u/d 4; <2u/d 5
• Exercise i aerobic exercise within the limits set by the disease state
• Diabetes Treat any underlying DM—b pp. 348–53

Chronic heart failure
Chronic heart failure occurs when output of the heart is inadequate to
meet the needs of the body. It is the end stage of all diseases of the heart.
900,000 people in the UK have heart failure; prevalence i with age.

Acute heart failure b p. 1088
Causes of chronic heart failure
High output The heart is working at normal or i rate but the needs of the
body are i beyond that which the heart can supply, e.g. hyperthyroidism,
anaemia, Paget’s disease, AV malformation.
Low output d heart function. Causes:
• i pre-load, e.g. mitral regurgitation, fluid overload
• Pump failure
• Cardiac muscle disease—IHD (46%), cardiomyopathy
• d expansion of heart and restricted filling—restrictive
cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, tamponade
• Inadequate heart rate—β-blockers, heart block, post-MI
• Arrhythmia—AF is the most common
• d power—negatively inotropic drugs, e.g. verapamil, diltiazem
• Chronic excessive afterloadi BP, aortic stenosis

Presentation Clinical diagnosis is difficult. Take a detailed history and
do a clinical examination to exclude other disorders.
Algorithm for diagnosing heart failure See Figure 10.4.

Management of chronic heart failure
0 Always look for the underlying cause and treat wherever possible.
Review the basis for historical diagnosis, and arrange echo to confirm if
diagnosis is in doubt.
Regular review Every 6mo or more often, as needed. Check:
• Clinical state Functional capacity, fluid status, cardiac rhythm, cognitive
and nutritional status
• Screen for depression Affects >40%
• Manage co-morbidities
• Medication Ensure drug record is up to date, review compliance and
side effects, change if clinical circumstances/best practice alter
• Blood U&E, creatinine, and eGFR

Non-drug measures
• Educate About the disease, current/expected symptoms, and need for
treatment. Discuss prognosis. Support with written information
• Discuss ways to make life easier, e.g. benefits, mobility aids, blue
disability parking badge. Consider referral to social services for
assessment for services, such as home care
• Diet Adequate calories, d salt, d weight if obese, restrict alcohol
• Lifestyle measures Smoking cessation (b p. 182); regular exercise
• Restrict fluid intake If severe heart failure
• Vaccination Pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccination
Diuretics Relieve congestive symptoms/fluid retention in all types
of heart failure. Choose a loop diuretic, e.g. furosemide 20–40mg or
bumetanide 1–2mg od. Add a thiazide if continued problems with oedema
or hypertension. Titrate dose i or d according to need. Monitor for d K+
and co-treat with amiloride or K+ supplements as needed.

First-line medication for left ventricular systolic dysfunction

Start all patients on an ACE inhibitor and a β-blocker. Use clinical judgement to decide which drug to start first.
ACE inhibitors Improve symptoms, i exercise capacity, d progression
of disease, d hospital admissions, and i survival in symptomatic and
asymptomatic patients. Start at low dose (e.g. ramipril 1.25mg od) and
titrate upwards. Check U&E and Cr before starting, at first follow-up, and
after each i in dose. Use ARB if not tolerated.
0 If neither an ACE inhibitor nor ARB is tolerated first-line, combination
of hydralazine with a nitrate is an alternative—seek specialist advice.
β-blockers Start a β-blocker licensed for heart failure (e.g. bisoprolol
1.25mg mane) in all those with left ventricular dysfunction regardless
of whether symptoms persist. Use in a ‘start low, go slow’ manner with
assessment of pulse, BP, and clinical status after each titration.
Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) Apart
from diuretics, there is no specific treatment for HFPEF. Treat any
co-morbidities, e.g. DM, i BP, IHD.

Other drugs to consider
• Anticoagulation If heart failure + AF, or history of thromboembolism,
left ventricular aneurysm, or intrathoracic thrombus—b p. 672

Management of chronic heart failure

• Aspirin 75–150mg od if heart failure + atherosclerotic arterial disease
(including CHD)
• Statins Only if other indications—b p. 253
• Amlodipine Treatment for angina and i BP. 0 Avoid verapamil,
diltiazem, or short-acting dihydropyridine agents

Referral to cardiology (or other suitable specialist) Consider if:
(E = Emergency admission; U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine)
• Making the initial diagnosis of heart failure—S/R
• Heart failure unable to be managed at home—E
• Severe heart failure—U/S
• Heart failure not controlled by first-line medication—U/S/R
• Angina, AF, or other symptomatic arrhythmia—U/S/R
• Heart failure due to valve disease or diastolic dysfunction—R
• Co-morbidity that may impact on heart failure, e.g. COPD, renal
failure, anaemia, thyroid disease, PVD, urinary frequency, gout—R
• Woman with heart failure planning pregnancy—R
Treatment under specialist supervision
Left ventricular systolic dysfunction Second-line agents that may be
started under specialist supervision include:
• Aldosterone antagonists, e.g. spironolactone
• Combination of hydralazine and nitrate
• ARB—used in combination with ACE inhibitor and β-blocker
Digoxin Is anti-arrhythmic and a positive inotrope. It is used for worsening
or severe heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction despite
first- and second-line treatment. Only check levels (8–12h after last dose)
if suspected toxicity or non-adherence.
Amiodarone May be used to treat arrhythmias associated with heart failure. It requires specialist initiation and close monitoring with TFTs and
LFTs at least every 6mo once established on a maintenance dose.
Medical devices
• Implantable cardioverter defibrillator—may be fitted in patients
with left ventricular dysfunction and previous episodes of ventricular
tachycardia or widened QRS complexes on ECG
• Cardiac resynchronization therapy—considered if severe symptoms on
maximal therapy and in sinus rhythm with prolonged QRS complexes

Prognosis Progressive deterioration to death; 750% die suddenly—
probably due to arrhythmias. Mortality:
• Mild/moderate heart failure—20–30% 1y mortality
• Severe heart failure—>50% 1y mortality

Cardiology and vascular disease

Pulmonary hypertension and cor
pulmonale
Normal pulmonary arterial pressure is less than a fifth of that in the systemic circulation. Pulmonary hypertension is defined as pulmonary artery
pressure ≥25mmHg. It is classified according to cause:
• Group 1 Pulmonary arterial hypertension—may be idiopathic or
associated with connective tissue disease (mainly scleroderma)
• Group 2 Left heart disease—severe heart failure (systolic or diastolic),
valve disease (e.g. mitral stenosis), congenital heart disease
• Group 3 Lung disease—COPD, interstitial lung disease
• Group 4 Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension—PE,
sickle cell disease
• Group 5 Unclear and multifactorial mechanisms

Cor pulmonale Right heart failure resulting from chronic pulmonary

hypertension.

Diagnosis Non-specific symptoms often lead to delayed diagnosis.
Presentation Fatigue and breathlessness on exertion ± angina, palpitations,
and pre-syncope. Later, as ventricular failure develops, symptoms include
peripheral oedema, ascites, and syncope.
Examination Check for cyanosis, peripheral oedema, i JVP, 4th heart
sound, diastolic murmur from pulmonary regurgitation, hepatomegaly ±
ascites, crepitations at lung bases ± pleural effusion.
Investigations
• CXR Prominent right heart border + enlargement of proximal
pulmonary arteries
• ECG If abnormal—right axis deviation, tall peaked P-wave in lead II,
dominant R-wave in V1, T-wave inversion in anterior leads, or RBBB

Management Refer to specialist cardiologist or chest physician.
Specialist investigation
• Doppler echo Is used to assess ventricular function and give an
estimate of pulmonary arterial pressure
• Right heart catheterization and direct measurement of mean
pulmonary artery pressure confirms diagnosis, provides information on
prognosis, and determines the treatment plan
• Assessment of functional capacity The 6min walk test is used to give
information about prognosis; <380m at presentation is associated with
poor prognosis

Specialist treatment Depending on the underlying cause, treatment
is usually through a tertiary specialist centre and includes:
• Oxygen therapy for symptomatic relief
• Diuretic treatment for heart failure
• Vasodilation with calcium channel blockers (in the 10–15% of patients
who are responsive)
• Anticoagulation

Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale

• Specific drug treatment, and/or
• Surgery

Specific drug treatments for group 1 pulmonary hypertension.
Improve symptoms, delay disease progression, and prolong survival.
Always initiated in specialist centres:
• Prostanoids, e.g. epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil—given IV, sc, or
via nebulizer
• Endothelin receptor antagonists, e.g. bosentan, ambrisentan—require
monthly monitoring with LFTs
• Phosphodiesterase inhibitors, e.g. sildenafil, tadalafil
Pulmonary endarterectomy Treatment of choice for patients with
cardiothromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. The majority can be
cured with normalization of pulmonary pressure following surgery (>90%
5y survival).
Bilateral heart/lung transplantation For those who have severe
symptoms despite optimal treatment. 5y survival following transplantation
is 50–60%.

Tachycardia
Tachycardia is a heart rate >100bpm. It is often felt as palpitations.
Tachycardia is common and may be an incidental finding. History and
examination can exclude significant problems in most patients.
History Ask about:
• Palpitations Duration, frequency and pattern, rhythm (ask the patient
to tap it out if not present when seen)
• Precipitating/relieving factors
• Associated symptoms Chest pain, collapse or funny turns, sweating,
breathlessness or hyperventilation
• Past history, e.g. previous episodes, heart disease, thyroid disease
• Lifestyle Drug history; caffeine/alcohol intake; smoking
• Occupation Arrhythmias may affect driving (b p. 130) and/or work

• Red flag symptoms

• Pre-existing cardiovascular disease
• FH of syncope, arrhythmia, or sudden death
• Arrhythmia associated with falls and/or syncope

Examination
• General examination For anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, other
systemic disease
• Cardiovascular examination Heart size, pulse rate and rhythm, JVP,
BP, heart sounds and murmurs, evidence of left ventricular failure

Investigations
First-line Resting ECG is all that is needed for many patients.
Further investigations Consider if ECG is abnormal or other concerning
features (e.g. syncope, breathlessness, prolonged episodes):
• Blood: TFTs, FBC, ESR/CRP, U&E, FBG/HbA1c, Ca2+, albumin
• Ambulatory ECG or cardiac memo
• Echo if <50y or murmur/heart failure detected
• Exercise tolerance test if exercise-related

Ventricular tachycardia (VT) Broad (>3 small squares) QRS

complexes at a rate of >100bpm on ECG. Admit as a ‘bluelight’
emergency. Meanwhile, give O2 if available ± 100mg IV lidocaine. If no
pulse, treat as VF cardiac arrest (b p. 1058).
Recurrent VT May require surgery, insertion of a pacemaker or implantable
cardioverter defibrillator.

Ventricular ectopic beats Additional broad QRS complexes,
without P-waves, superimposed on regular sinus rhythm. Common and
usually of no clinical significance. Rarely may be the presenting feature of
viral myocarditis. Management:
• Frequent ectopics (>100/h) on ECG Urgent cardiology referral
• R on T phenomenon on ECG Rarely, ectopics can lead to VF,
particularly if they coincide with the T-wave of a preceding beat (‘R on
T phenomenon’). Admit if this occurs >10x/min on ECG

Tachycardia

• After MI Ventricular extrasystoles after MI are associated with i
mortality—refer to cardiology
• No sinister features on ECG Explain benign nature of the condition.
Advise avoidance of caffeine, alcohol, smoking, and fatigue. β-blockers
can be helpful if unable to tolerate ectopics despite reassurance
Long QT syndrome (LQTS) Heart condition associated with syncope/sudden death due to ventricular arrhythmias, often associated with
exercise/excitement. ECG—prolonged QT interval. Genetic form is autosomal dominant or recessive and may be associated with syndactyly or
neural deafness. Refer any patient with a family history of sudden cardiac
death for specialist assessment. Antenatal screening is possible.
Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) Narrow QRS
complex tachycardia with a regular rate >100bpm on ECG.
Management if seen during an attack
• Get an ECG if possible
• Try carotid sinus massage (unless elderly, IHD, digoxin toxicity, carotid
bruit, history of TIAs), the Valsalva manoeuvre, and/or ice on the face
(especially effective for children)
• Admit as an emergency if the attack continues
Management if attack terminates or not seen during attack SVT may
be diagnosed on 12-lead resting ECG or 24h ECG/cardiac memo. Refer
to cardiology for confirmation of diagnosis and initiation of treatment.
Urgent referral if chest pain, dizziness, or breathlessness during attacks.
Include ECG trace during an attack, if available.
Ongoing care Advise patients to avoid caffeine, alcohol, and smoking.
Treatment options are catheter ablation or drug therapy with sotalol,
diltiazem, verapamil, or flecainide.

Sinus tachycardia Consider infection, pain, MI, shock, exercise, emotion (including anxiety), heart failure, thyrotoxicosis, drugs.
Atrial fibrillation/flutter b p. 270
No tachycardia and no ECG abnormalities Reassure. Explore

the possibility of anxiety disorder (b pp. 992–7).

Wolff–Parkinson–White (WPW) syndrome A congenital acces-

sory conduction pathway is present between atrium and ventricle (bundle
of Kent). Clinical features:
• Predisposes to SVT and AF
• ECG Short P-R interval followed by slurred upstroke (‘delta wave’)
into the QRS complex
• Management Refer to cardiology. Treatment is with anti-arrhythmics
(SVT—verapamil; AF—amiodarone or DC shock) ± ablation of the
accessory pathway

Cardiology and vascular disease

Atrial fibrillation
AF is a common disturbance of cardiac rhythm that may be episodic (paroxysmal). Characterized by rapid irregularly irregular narrow QRS complex tachycardia with absence of P-waves. Affects <1% aged <60y but >8%
aged >80y. Associated with 5x i risk of stroke (b p. 562). Causes:
• No cause (isolated AF) 712%
• i BP (especially if LVH)
• Coronary heart disease
• Cardiomyopathy
• Valvular heart disease (especially mitral valve disease)
Acute AF May be precipitated by acute infection, high alcohol intake,
surgery, electrocution, MI, pericarditis, PE, or hyperthyroidism.

Symptoms Often asymptomatic but may cause palpitations, chest pain,
stroke/TIA, dyspnoea, fatigue, light-headedness, and/or syncope.

Examination
• General examination Check for anaemia, thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, and
other systemic disease
• Cardiovascular examination Heart size, pulse rate/rhythm (apex rate
> radial pulse rate if in AF), JVP, BP, heart sounds/murmurs, LVF

Investigations
• Routine investigations Resting ECG, CXR, Blood: TFTs, FBC, U&E
• Further investigations Ambulatory ECG or cardiac memo if
paroxysmal AF; echo if <50y or murmur/heart failure detected;
consider exercise tolerance test if exercise-related

Management See Figure 10.5. Aims to: relieve symptoms, e.g. palpitations, fatigue, dyspnoea; prevent thromboembolism and d risk of stroke;
and maintain cardiac function.

‘Pill-in-the-pocket’ approach to paroxysmal AF Consider self-medication
with a β-blocker prn (e.g. atenolol 50–100mg od) if infrequent symptomatic
paroxysms and no history of LV dysfunction or valvular/ischaemic heart
disease; systolic BP >100mmHg and resting heart rate >70bpm; able to
understand when and how to take the medication.
Referral to cardiology E = Emergency admission; U = Urgent; S = Soon;
R = Routine.
• Fast rate and compromised by arrhythmia (chest pain, d BP or more
than mild heart failure)—E
• Candidate for DC or chemical cardioversion—E/U
• Uncertainty about diagnosis or treatment—S/R
• Symptoms are uncontrolled by standard treatment—S/R
• Paroxysmal AF for consideration of sotalol or other anti-arrhythmic
drugs when standard β-blockers have failed—S/R

Atrial flutter ECG shows regular, sawtooth baseline at rate of 300bpm,

with a narrow QRS complex tachycardia superimposed at a rate of 150bpm
or 100bpm. Manage in the same way as AF (although specialist drug treatment
may differ).

Assess risk and reassess regularly
Warfarin d stroke risk by 60%
Aspirin d stroke risk by 20%
Base decision on which to prescribe

circumstances—Table 16.10 b p. 565

Two treatment approaches
Rhythm control Consider referral/ admission for DC or chemical cardioversion to
restore sinus rhythm if:
• Symptomatic or CCF
• Age ≤65y
• First presentation with lone AF
• AF 2° to a treated/corrected precipitant
After treatment, medication (e.g. β-blocker) may be needed to maintain sinus rhythm.
Rate control Consider controlling ventricular rate with a β-blocker (e.g. atenolol
50–100mg od) or rate-limiting calcium channel blocker (e.g. verapamil 40–120mg tds) if:
• Age >65y
• Long duration of AF (>12mo)
• Coronary artery disease
• No CCF
• Structural heart disease which makes AF likely, e.g. mitral stenosis, large left atrium
• History of multiple failed attempts at cardioversion/relapses
• Contraindications to anticoagulation
• Ongoing but reversible cause of AF, e.g. thyrotoxicosis
Aim for a ventricular rate of 60–80bpm at rest and 90–115bpm during moderate
exercise. If ineffective during normal activities, combine a β-blocker with digoxin;
if ineffective during exercise combine a rate-limiting calcium antagonist with digoxin.
If still ineffective/poorly tolerated—refer for consideration of other anti-arrhythmic
agents, e.g. sotalol, propafenone, flecainide, or amiodarone.
Consider digoxin as monotherapy for predominantly sedentary patients.

Bradycardia
Heart rate <60 bpm.

Presentation Often an incidental finding but may present with faints or
blackouts, drop attacks, dizziness, breathlessness, or lack of energy.

Examination Slow pulse rate; normal/low BP ± evidence of secondary
heart failure. There may also be symptoms/signs of associated disease.
Investigations
• ECG 12-lead resting ECG; ambulatory ECG may help with diagnosis of
intermittent bradycardia (e.g. sick sinus syndrome)
• Blood TFTs, FBC, ESR, U&E, LFTs, digoxin levels (if taking digoxin)

Sinus bradycardia Constant bradycardia. P-waves present and P-R
interval <0.2s (one large square). Causes:

•
•
•
•
•

Physiological, e.g. athletes
Vasovagal attack
Drugs, e.g. β-blockers, digoxin
Inferior MI
Sick sinus syndrome

•
•
•
•

Hypothyroidism
Hypothermia
i ICP
Jaundice

Management Admit acutely if symptomatic. Refer for cardiology opinion
if asymptomatic but HR <40bpm despite treatment of reversible causes.
AV node block (heart block) Causes:
• Cardiomyopathy
• IHD
• Fibrosis
• Drugs (digoxin, verapamil)
• Lyme disease (rare)
• Myocarditis
Types of heart block
• 1st degree block Fixed P-R interval >200ms (one large square)
• 2nd degree block
• Mobitz type I (Wenckebach)—progressively lengthening P-R
interval followed by a dropped beat.
• Mobitz type II—constant P-R interval with regular dropped beats
(e.g. 2:1—every second beat is dropped; consider drug toxicity).
• 3rd degree block (complete heart block)—P-P intervals are constant
and R-R intervals are constant but not related to each other
Management Untreated 2nd and 3rd degree heart block have a mortality
of 835%. Refer all patients to cardiology, even if asymptomatic. If symptomatic (dBP <90mmHg systolic, left ventricular failure, heart rate <40bpm),
admit as an emergency—give O2 (if available) whilst awaiting admission.

Stokes Adams attacks Cardiac arrest due to AV block. Results in
sudden loss of consciousness ± some limb twitching due to cerebral
anoxia. The patient becomes pale and pulseless, but respiration continues.
Attacks usually last 730s although occasionally are fatal. On recovery
the patient becomes flushed. Refer to cardiology if suspected. W. Stokes
(1804–1878)—Irish physician and R. Adams (1791–1875)—Irish surgeon.

Bradycardia

Sick sinus syndrome Due to sinus node dysfunction causing brady­
cardia ± asystole, sinoatrial block (complete heart block), AF, or SVT
alternating with bradycardia (tachy/brady syndrome). Common amongst
elderly patients. If symptomatic, heart rate <40bpm, or pauses >3s on
ECG refer to cardiology for pacemaker insertion.

Pacemakers Electrically stimulate the heart to beat. Indications:
• Symptomatic bradycardia
• 2nd or 3rd degree heart block
• Suppression of resistant tachycardia

Insertion Pacemaker box is attached under the skin of the chest—usually
medial to the left axilla under LA. Wires are fed into the great veins of the
chest and thus to the heart under X-ray and/or US guidance.
Types Classified according to:
• Chamber paced—atrium, ventricle, or both (‘dual’)
• Chamber sensed—atrium, ventricle, or both (‘dual’)
• Mode of response to sensing — inhibited output, triggered, inhibited,
and triggered (‘dual’)
Thus a VVI pacemaker both paces and senses the ventricle in inhibited
mode—i.e. if the ventricle beats spontaneously, the pacemaker will not fire.
ECG changes with a pacemaker If the pacemaker is in operation, a pacing
‘spike’ (vertical line) is seen on ECG.
0 In devices pacing on demand a spike will not be seen if the natural rate
is in excess of the rate set on the pacemaker.
Lifespan Pacemakers last 7–15y. Regular checks are made by pacemaker
clinics to ensure the pacemaker remains operational. Reprogramming
through the skin is possible. Batteries can be changed via a small surgical
procedure under local anaesthetic.
Driving with a pacemaker Inform DVLA and insurance company (b p. 130).
Stop driving for 1mo after insertion.
• Pacemakers must be removed after death before cremation can
occur. A fee is payable.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Infective endocarditis
• New murmur + fever = endocarditis until proven otherwise.
Infective endocarditis occurs when there is infection of a heart valve (mitral
> aortic > tricuspid > pulmonary). The valve may be normal (50%—may
be associated with IV drug abuse), rheumatic, degenerative, congenitally
abnormal, or prosthetic. Uncommon but consequences may be disastrous
and often detected late.

Causes
• Common organisms Strep. viridans (35–50%); Staph. aureus (20%)
• Non-bacterial causes SLE, malignancy
Presentation May be acute (acute heart failure) or subacute (course
worsening over days/weeks). Symptoms/signs:
• Infective Fever, weight d, night sweats, malaise, lethargy, clubbing,
splenomegaly, anaemia, mycotic aneurysms
• Heart murmurs ± heart failure
• Embolic Stroke, lung abscesses (right heart endocarditis)
• Vasculitic Microscopic haematuria, splinter haemorrhages, Osler’s
nodes (painful lesions on finger pulps), Janeway lesions (palmar
macules), Roth’s spots (retinal vasculitis), renal failure

High-risk patients Those with:
• Acquired valvular heart disease with stenosis or regurgitation
• Valve replacement
• Structural congenital heart disease, including surgically corrected or
palliated structural conditions, but excluding isolated atrial septal
defect, fully repaired ventricular septal defect or fully repaired patent
ductus arteriosus, and closure devices that are endothelialized
• Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
• Previous infective endocarditis
When to suspect infective endocarditisG Have a high index of
suspicion and admit as an emergency for further investigation if:
• Febrile illness and murmur of new valvular regurgitation
• Febrile illness + pre-existing high-risk cardiac lesion and no clinically
obvious site of infection
• Febrile illness associated with any of:
• Predisposition and recent intervention with associated bacteraemia
(e.g. dental work or surgical procedure)
• Evidence of congestive cardiac failure
• New conduction disturbance
• Vascular or immunological phenomena, e.g. embolic event, Roth’s
spots, splinter haemorrhages, Janeway lesions, or Osler’s nodes
• New stroke
• Peripheral abscesses (renal, splenic, cerebral, vertebral) of
unknown cause
• Protracted history of sweats, weight d, anorexia or malaise, and at-risk
cardiac lesion
• New unexplained embolic event, e.g. CVA, limb ischaemia

Infective endocarditis

Management For patients at i risk, i.e. with valve lesions or prosthetic
valves. Admit as an emergency if suspected. Avoid starting antibiotics prior
to admission as this might cause delay in diagnosis by rendering the blood
cultures sterile.
Investigations in primary care if non-acute presentation
• Blood—non-specific signs of infection, e.g. leukocytosis, i ESR/CRP
• ECG— 10% develop a conduction defect
• CXR

Hospital treatment Once confirmed treatment is with prolonged IV
broad-spectrum antibiotics (≥2wk).

Prognosis 80% have major complications during admission, e.g. heart

failure. Valve replacement may be required—especially if endocarditis is
on a prosthetic valve. 16–27% of those admitted with a diagnosis of infective endocarditis die—those with endocarditis affecting a prosthetic valve
have poorer prognosis. Other factors predicting poorer prognosis:
• Infecting organism—Staph. aureus 30–40% mortality; streptococci 10%
mortality
• CNS complications
• i age
• Co-morbidity, e.g. DM
• Aortic valve involvement
• Associated heart failure

Prevention of infective endocarditis Guidance advises against routine antibiotic prophylaxis because:
• There is no consistent association between having an interventional
procedure and development of infective endocarditis
• Regular toothbrushing presents a greater risk of infective endocarditis
than a single dental procedure because of repetitive exposure to
bacteraemia with oral flora
• Clinical effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis is not proven
• Antibiotic prophylaxis against infective endocarditis may lead to a
greater number of deaths through fatal anaphylaxis than a strategy of
no antibiotic prophylaxis, and is not cost-effective
Advise instead About the:
• Importance of maintaining good oral health
• Symptoms that may indicate infective endocarditis and when to seek
expert advice
• The risks of undergoing invasive procedures, including non-medical
procedures such as body piercing or tattooing
0 Do not offer chlorhexidine mouthwash as prophylaxis against infective
endocarditis to people at-risk undergoing dental procedures.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Rheumatic fever, myocarditis,
and pericarditis
Rheumatic fever There has been a dramatic d in incidence of rheumatic fever in industrialized countries since 1950s, but recently numbers
of cases have i. Rheumatic fever is still an endemic disease in developing
countries. Peak incidence: age 5–15y.
Cause Rheumatic fever is due to an abnormal immunological response
to β-haemolytic streptococcal infection (e.g. 2–4wk after sore throat). Its
importance lies in the permanent damage caused to heart valves in some
of those affected and subsequent risk of endocarditis.
Diagnosis Can be made if revised Jones criteria are met (see Table 10.7).
Management If suspected refer for specialist care. Specialist management
includes: evaluation of heart lesions with echo, bed rest; penicillin; and
symptom control (e.g. analgesia, sedatives for chorea). Anti-inflammatory
agents such as corticosteroids and aspirin may be used to try to d complications of carditis but their use is controversial.
Prognosis
• 60% develop chronic rheumatic heart disease (70% mitral valve; 40%
aortic; 10% tricuspid; 2% pulmonary). Likelihood correlates with
severity of initial disease
• Recurrence may occur after further streptococcal infection or be
precipitated by pregnancy or combined hormonal contraception

Migratory polyarthritis (‘flitting’ – 75%)
red, tender joints
Sydenham’s chorea (St Vitus’

Rheumatic fever, myocarditis, and pericarditis

Secondary prevention Penicillin 250mg bd po or sulfadiazine 1g od
(500mg od for patients <30kg) for ≥5y to prevent recurrence. Duration of
prophylaxis is dependent on whether there was carditis in the initial attack
(no carditis—continue for 5y; if cardiac involvement—continue until age
25y or longer).

Acute myocarditis Inflammation of the myocardium. May present
in a similar way to MI or with palpitations. Causes: viral infection, e.g.
Coxsackie virus; diphtheria; rheumatic fever; drugs.
Management Admit for specialist cardiologist care. Treatment is supportive. Some recover spontaneously—others progress to intractable heart
failure requiring transplantation.

Pericarditis Sharp, constant sternal pain relieved by sitting forwards.
May radiate to left shoulder ± arm or into the abdomen. Worse lying on
the left side and on inspiration, swallowing, and coughing. A pericardial rub
may be present at the left sternal edge on auscultation. Causes:
• Infection, e.g. Coxsackie virus, TB
• Malignancy
• Uraemia
• MI (Dressler’s syndrome b p. 261)
• Trauma
• Radiotherapy
• Connective tissue disease
• Hypothyroidism
Investigations ECG—concave (saddle-shaped) ST elevation in all leads.
Management Refer to cardiology; treat the cause (if possible); sympto­
matic treatment with NSAID for pain; steroids in resistant cases.
Complications
• Pericardial effusion Fluid in the pericardial sac. Presentation: heart
failure, cardiac tamponade (inability of the heart to dilate in diastole
resulting in tachycardia, d BP, i JVP). CXR—large, globular heart. Echo
is diagnostic. Management: admit for urgent cardiology assessment
• Constrictive pericarditis Pericardium becomes fibrosed and
non-expansile. Most common cause is TB. Presentation: right heart
failure, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, d BP, i JVP. Management: refer to
cardiologist for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment involves surgical
release of the pericardium

Cardiology and vascular disease

Cardiomyopathy and heart transplant
Cardiomyopathy is primary disease of the heart muscle. Although some
cardiomyopathies are ‘unclassified’ most fall into the following four groups:
Dilated (congestive) cardiomyopathy Prevalence 735/100,000.
4 > 5. Dilation of left ± right ventricle and d contractility. Usually presents
with heart failure; may also present with arrhythmia, syncope, peripheral
embolism, or abnormalities on ECG/echo. ECG shows non-specific S-T
abnormalities; CXR—cardiac enlargement and pulmonary venous hypertension. Echo is diagnostic. Causes:
• Idiopathic (50%)
• Cardiotoxic drugs
• Familial (20%)
• Pregnancy
• Cardiovascular—IHD, i BP,
• Connective tissue disease
congenital heart disease, rheumatic
(SLE, PAN, systemic sclerosis)
heart disease
• Sarcoidosis
• Alcohol
• Amyloidosis
• Infection (Coxsackie virus)
• Haemochromatosis
• Endocrine disease—myxoedema,
• Malignancy
thyrotoxicosis, acromegaly
• Muscular dystrophy
Management Advise patients to stop drinking alcohol as alcohol may
make cardio­myopathy worse. Specialist management is needed in all cases
and involves:
• Treatment of heart failure and arrhythmias (may require cardiac
resynchronization and/or implantable cardiac defibrillator device)
• Most patients require long-term anticoagulation
• Surgery—cardiomyoplasty or heart transplantation
Mortality 40% in 2y (sudden death, cardiogenic shock).
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy Familial inheritance (autosomal
dominant), though 1 in 2 cases are sporadic—in its most common form
causes asymmetrical septal hypertrophy ± aortic outflow obstruction
(hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy or HOCM).
Presentation Most cases are diagnosed in childhood (<14y) through echo
screening of asymptomatic patients with a FH. Symptoms/signs:
• Palpitations—associated with arrhythmias—5% have AF
• Breathlessness on exertion
• Chest pain—may be angina or atypical pain
• Murmur—due to outflow obstruction and/or mitral valve dysfunction
• Faints/collapses
Investigations
• ECG—LVH and ischaemic changes, e.g. T-wave inversion
• CXR—normal until disease is in its late stages
• Echo—diagnostic. Refer if suspicious symptoms or family history
Management and prognosis Ongoing specialist care is essential to provide symptomatic treatment, e.g. β-blockers for chest pain, amiodarone
for arrhythmia (digoxin is contraindicated). Implantable cardiac defibrillators improve prognosis for those at high risk of sudden death. Surgical
options include alcohol septal ablation and myotomy/myectomy to debulk
the septum and relieve obstruction.
Mortality Sudden death is unrelated to severity of symptoms.

Cardiomyopathy and heart transplant

Restrictive cardiomyopathy Rare. Stiff ventricle limits filling.
Presents with heart failure. Echo is diagnostic. Causes: amyloid, sarcoidosis, haemochromatosis. Management: specialist management is required.
Treatment is symptomatic.
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy Rare
genetic condition of progressive infiltration of the right ventricular myocardium with fibrofatty tissue. Often asymptomatic until presents with
cardiac arrest. Refer any patients with a suspicious family history.
Family history of sudden death Refer first-degree relatives of victims of sudden cardiac death who died aged <40y to cardiology. Antenatal
screening for familial cardiomyopathy and LQTS is possible if familial mutation is known. If FH of HOCM and no genetic test:
• Children under <10y—screen with ECG and echo every 3–5y
• Children aged 10–16y—screen every 6–12mo if there is a family
history of HOCM; disease is likely to become apparent at this age
•	Young people aged 16–20y—screen annually
• >20y—screen every 5y if FH of late-onset hypertrophic cardiomyopathy
0 Screening intervals are not established for other cardiomyopathies
but should be adapted to the pattern of disease within that particular
family.
Heart transplantation Considered in patients with estimated 1y survival <50%. Indications/contraindications—see Table 10.8.
Assessment Each eligible patient is assessed for psychosocial factors and
physical factors (e.g. renal failure, obesity, age, peripheral vascular disease)
which affect prognosis before a decision whether to place the patient on
the transplant list is made.
Post-operatively Patients require life-long immunosuppression—usually
with ciclosporin. Follow-up is undertaken in specialist clinics.
Prognosis 1 in 4 patients die on the transplant list; 60% receive transplant in
<2y. Perioperative mortality is <10%; 1y survival 92%; 5y survival 75%; 10y
survival 60%. Patients have accelerated graft atherosclerosis. Complications
of immunosuppression include i risk of infection and cancer.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Valve disease
Heart murmurs b p. 234
• All patients with newly detected valve disease, except those with
mitral valve prolapse or aortic sclerosis, require cardiology referral.
• Admit if suspected endocarditis
• Refer urgently/admit if symptomatic valve disease or if valve disease
underlies the presenting condition, e.g. heart failure caused by aortic
stenosis, AF caused by mitral valve disease

Mitral stenosis Usually due to rheumatic fever.
Presentation
• Symptoms Breathlessness, palpitations, fatigue. May result in
pulmonary hypertension, which presents with right heart failure,
haemoptysis, and/or recurrent bronchitis
• Signs Peripheral cyanosis (‘malar flush’ on cheeks), left parasternal heave,
tapping apex beat, AF, rumbling mid-diastolic murmur at the apex
Management Confirm with echo. Refer to cardiology. Treatment is medical (treatment of AF and heart failure, and anticoagulation) ± surgical (valvotomy, balloon valvoplasty, valve replacement).

Mitral regurgitation (incompetence) Causes:

• Congenital
• Rheumatic fever
• Mitral valve
prolapse

• Ventricular
dilatation
• Endocarditis
• Cardiomyopathy

• Ruptured papillary
muscle/chordae
tendinae following MI
• RA

Presentation
• Symptoms Dyspnoea, fatigue
• Signs Displaced apex (l left axilla), pan-systolic murmur at the apex
radiating to axilla, AF, left ventricular failure
Management Confirm with echo. Refer to cardiology. Treatment is medical (treatment of AF and heart failure, anticoagulation) ± surgical (valve
replacement).

Mitral valve prolapse Prevalence 71 in 20.
Presentation
• Symptoms Usually none. Rarely atypical chest pain, palpitations,
syncope, postural hypotension, emboli
• Signs Late systolic murmur over apex
Management Confirm with echo. If syncope or palpitations refer to cardiology—a rare complication is ventricular arrhythmia.

Aortic sclerosis Thickening and stiffening of the aortic valve not associated with outflow obstruction that occurs with age. Clinically an ejection
systolic murmur is present but no other symptoms or signs. CXR may
show a calcified valve. No treatment is required.

Valve disease

Aortic stenosis Causes:
• Congenital
• Rheumatic fever

• Bicuspid valve
• Hypertrophic
• Degenerative calcification
cardiomyopathy

Presentation
• Symptoms Angina, breathlessness, syncope or ‘funny turns’, dizziness,
sudden death
• Signs Small volume pulse, low pulse pressure (difference between
systolic and diastolic BP), ejection systolic murmur loudest in the
aortic area which radiates to carotids and apex
Management Echo is diagnostic and gives an estimate of the gradient
across the valve and thus severity of the condition. Refer to cardiology.
Surgery (valve replacement or transcutaneous vulvoplasty) is considered
for those with syncope or if systolic gradient across the valve is 50mmHg.
Avoid treatment with ACE inhibitors.

Aortic regurgitation Causes:

• Congenital, e.g. VSD
• Bicuspid aortic valve
• Rheumatic fever

• Aortic dissection
• Endocarditis
• Cardiomyopathy

• Syphilis
• Marfan’s or Ehlers–
Danlos syndrome

Presentation
• Symptoms Dyspnoea, palpitations (extrasystoles)
• Signs Prominent pulse (‘waterhammer’), wide pulse pressure, visible neck
pulsation (Corrigan’s sign), head nodding in time with pulse (De Musset’s
sign), visible capillary pulsations (e.g. in nail bed—Quincke’s sign),
displaced apex beat, high-pitched early diastolic murmur (easily missed)
Management Confirm with echo. Refer to cardiology for consideration
of surgery.

Right heart valve disease Echo is diagnostic. Always requires specialist management.
• Tricuspid stenosis Mitral valve disease coexists. Cause: rheumatic
fever. Murmur: early diastolic (left sternal edge in inspiration).
Treatment is with diuretics ± surgery (valvotomy or replacement)
• Tricuspid regurgitation Causes: RV enlargement, endocarditis (IV
drug misusers), carcinoid, rheumatic fever, congenital. Presents with
oedema, breathlessness, pulsatile hepatomegaly (± jaundice), ascites,
pansystolic murmur loudest at left sternal edge. Treatment is with
diuretics, vasodilators ± surgery (valve replacement or annuloplasty)
• Pulmonary stenosis Causes: congenital (Fallot’s tetralogy), rheumatic,
carcinoid. Murmur: ejection systolic murmur (loudest to left of upper
sternum, radiating to left shoulder). ECG: RVH. CXR: dilated pulmonary
artery. Treatment (if needed) is with pulmonary valvotomy
• Pulmonary regurgitation Due to pulmonary hypertension (b p. 266).
Murmur: decrescendo early diastolic murmur at left sternal edge
• Women planning pregnancy who have known valve disease require

Cardiology and vascular disease

Other structural abnormalities
of the heart
Coarctation of the aorta Localized narrowing of the descending
aorta usually distal to the origin of the left subclavian artery.

Presentation Heart failure, i BP, murmur heard incidentally (ejection systolic murmur over the left side of the chest radiating to the back), lack of
femoral pulses or radiofemoral delay. Rarely presentation is with a complication, e.g. subarachnoid haemorrhage or endocarditis. CXR—prominent
left ventricle. ECG—left ventricular hypertrophy.
Management Refer to cardiology—surgery to remove the narrowed portion of the aorta is usually indicated.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) A hole connects the two atria. Holes
high in the septum (ostium secundum) are most common (2 in 1,000 live
births); holes lower in the septum (ostium primum) are associated with
AV valve abnormalities. Blood flows from L l R through the shunt and the
right heart takes the burden.
Presentation
• Ostium secundum defects Symptoms are rare in infancy and
uncommon in childhood. If detected in these groups presents as
a murmur (systolic—loudest in the second left interspace) found
incidentally, with breathlessness or tiredness on exertion or recurrent
chest infections. Presentation is usually in the third or fourth decade
with heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and/or atrial arrhythmias
• Ostium primum defects Heart failure commonly develops in infancy/
childhood ± severe pulmonary hypertension. In addition to the ASD
murmur, there may be a pansystolic murmur signifying mitral or
tricuspid valve regurgitation
Investigation
• CXR Cardiomegaly with a prominent right atrium ± pulmonary artery
± pulmonary plethora
• ECG Right axis deviation (ostium secundum defect) or left axis
deviation (ostium primum defect), RVH ± RBBB
• Echo Diagnostic
Management Refer to cardiology. Cardiac surgery to close the defect is
usually indicated.

Ventricular septal defect (VSD) A hole connects the 2 ventricles.
Blood flows initially from L l R through the hole. May be congenital (2 in
1,000 live births) or acquired (usually septal rupture post-MI).
Acquired VSD Suspect if new pansystolic murmur ± heart failure develop
after MI. Investigate as for congenital VSD. Refer to cardiology (speed
of referral will depend on state of the patient) for advice on further
management.

Other structural abnormalities of the heart

Congenital VSD
• Small VSD (‘maladie de Roger’) Normally asymptomatic. A thrill may
be palpable at lower left sternal border; harsh pansystolic murmur—
small holes give loud murmurs. CXR and ECG are normal. Diagnosis is
confirmed on echo. Refer to cardiology
• Moderate VSD Symptoms usually appear in infancy—breathlessness
on feeding/crying, failure to thrive, recurrent chest infections. As the
child gets older symptoms improve (relative size of the defect d). On
examination, there may be cardiomegaly, a thrill palpable at the left
sternal edge and a pansystolic murmur. CXR shows cardiomegaly ±
prominent pulmonary arteries ± pulmonary plethora. Diagnosis is
confirmed on echo. Refer to cardiology
• Large VSD Presents with heart failure at 73mo of age, though there
may be symptoms of breathlessness on feeding/crying prior to
then. On examination, the baby is obviously unwell—underweight,
breathless, pulmonary oedema ± cyanosis, large heart, thrill over left
sternal edge ± parasternal heave, murmur (often not pansystolic due
to high right ventricular pressures). Admit to paediatrics—medical
treatment ± surgery is always needed

Marfan syndrome Autosomal dominant connective tissue disease
causing abnormalities of fibrillin (a glycoprotein in elastic fibres). Features
include:
• Arachnodactyly (long, spidery fingers)
• High-arched palate
• Arm span > height
• Lens dislocation ± unstable iris
• Aortic dilatation (β-blockers appear to slow this)
• Aortic incompetence may occur, e.g. in pregnancy
• Aortic dissection may cause sudden death—echo screening may be
helpful for affected individuals
If suspected, refer to cardiology ± genetics. There is currently no antenatal
screening test available. E.J.A. Marfan (1858–1942)—French paediatrician.

Aneurysms
An arterial aneurysm forms when there is a 50% i in normal diameter
of the vessel. Aneurysms may affect any medium/large artery—aorta/iliac
arteries > popliteal > femoral > carotid. FH of aneurysm is a risk factor.
Causes Atheroma (most common); injury; infection (e.g. endocarditis,
syphilis-mycotic aneurysms).
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) Prevalence is 74% in men aged
65–74y (4:58 6:1). Acute rupture of AAA in the community has 790%
mortality accounting for 2% of deaths in 4 aged >65y. Elective surgical
repair has 75–7% mortality.
Risk factors Smoking; i BP; family history (risk i x4–10 if there is an
affected first-degree relative).
Factors predisposing to rupture of AAA
• Diameter (risk i with diameter) • Fast rate of expansion
• COPD
• Inflammation within the
• Smoking
aneurysm wall
• i diastolic BP
• Thrombus-free surface area of
• FH
aneurysm sac
Presentation Often discovered as an incidental finding on abdominal
examination, X-ray (calcification of aneurysm wall in 50% cases) or USS
(75% asymptomatic at diagnosis). Otherwise presents with:
• Local symptoms Vague abdominal or back pain
• Distant symptoms Embolization/acute ischaemia of a limb. Multiple
small infarcts (e.g. of toes) with good peripheral pulses suggests an
aneurysm proximally
• Collapse due to rupture Hypovolaemic shock ± pulsatile abdominal
mass ± abdominal or back pain—b p. 1074
Investigation USS confirms diagnosis, diameter, site, and extent.
Screening In the UK, all men aged 65y are offered aneurysm screening
with a single abdominal USS. Men >65y can self-refer. Screening d death
from AAA by 44% over 4y. Possible screening results—see Figure 10.6.
Management of abdominal aortic aneurysm
• Acute rupture b p. 1074
• Elective surgery Refer if risk of rupture > risk elective repair. The greater
the diameter, the more the risk (5.5cm diameter 8 10% 1y rupture rate;
10cm diameter >75% 1y rupture rate). AAAs >5.5cm are routinely
repaired except if other factors i risk of surgery; there is no survival
benefit from treating smaller aneurysms. Refer urgently if symptomatic—
may indicate rapid expansion or inflammation, both risk factors for rupture
• USS surveillance Patients with AAAs <5.5cm diameter are screened
at least annually (see Figure 10.6). Routine repair takes place when and
if the aneurysm expands to >5.5cm. 3 in 5 eventually warrant surgery

Inflammatory aneurysms Characterized by inflammatory infiltrate in
the aneurysm wall. May be adherent to surrounding structures. Presentation:
fever, malaise, and abdominal pain. Associated with i mortality at operation.

more complex and carries higher mortality.
Dissecting thoracic aortic aneurysm b p. 1074
Popliteal aneurysm 80% peripheral aneurysms. Most are >2cm diameter; 50% are bilateral. Associated with AAA (40%). Presents with acute
below-knee ischaemia secondary to aneurysm thrombosis or embolization. Popliteal pulses are pronounced. Diagnosis is confirmed on USS.
Management
• Acute ischaemia—b p. 1126
• Elective surgery (popliteal bypass)—when aneurysm >2.5cm diameter
Femoral artery aneurysm Presentation: local pressure symptoms,
thrombosis, or distal embolization. Surgical treatment: bypass surgery.
Carotid artery aneurysm Rare. Presents with pulsatile lateral neck
swelling ± carotid territory TIAs. Rarely can rupture. Refer to vascular
surgery for surgical treatment.
Carotid body tumour Slow-growing tumour arising in the carotid
body at the carotid bifurcation. Presents with a slowly enlarging mass
which transmits carotid pulsation. Refer to vascular surgery for angiographic confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment is with surgical excision. If
untreated, becomes locally invasive and may eventually metastasize.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Chronic peripheral ischaemia
Peripheral vascular disease (normally atherosclerotic) commonly affects
arteries supplying the legs. Prevalence: 20% patients aged >60y. Assess for
the presence of peripheral arterial disease if:
• Symptoms suggestive of peripheral arterial disease, or
• DM, non-healing wounds on the legs or feet, or unexplained leg pain, or
• Being considered for interventions to the leg or foot, or
• Need to use compression hosiery
Natural history Most remain stable. A minority (20% over 10y) progress from intermittent claudication to critical limb ischaemia. Management
of CVD risk factors is essential.
Intermittent claudication Restriction of blood flow causes pain on
walking. Risk factors:
• Physical inactivity
• 4>5
• i BP
• Hypercoagulable states
• Smoking
• Hyperlipidaemia
• Post-menopausal
• Obesity
• DM
Presentation Presents with muscular, cramp-like pain in the calf, thigh,
or buttock on walking that is rapidly relieved on resting. The leg is cool
and white, with atrophic skin changes and absent pulses (see Table 10.9):
• Disease in the superficial femoral artery Absent popliteal and foot
pulses. Causes calf claudication
• Disease of the aorta or iliac artery Weak or absent femoral pulse ±
femoral bruit. Causes calf, thigh, or buttock claudication
Differential diagnosis Nerve root compression, e.g. sciatica; spinal stenosis—usually bilateral pain which may occur after prolonged standing as
well as exercise; not rapidly relieved by rest.
Investigation
• Blood FBC, U&E, Cr, eGFR (peripheral vascular disease is associated
with renal artery stenosis—b p. 443), FBG/HbA1c, lipids
• Ankle–brachial systolic pressure index (ABPI) Good history + ABPI
<0.95 confirms diagnosis; if good history but normal ABPI (= 1),
consider referral for exercise testing*
• Duplex USS Used to determine site of disease*
Management
• Exercise Offer a supervised programme (ideally 2h/wk for 3mo) to all
patients; encourage to exercise to the point of maximal pain
• d risk factors Patients with claudication have a 3x i risk of death from
MI/stroke. Advise to stop smoking, moderate alcohol, and lose weight.
Ensure optimum treatment of i BP, lipids, and DM
• Antiplatelet agents Treat all patients with aspirin 75mg od (or
clopidogrel 75mg od if aspirin-intolerant)
• Foot care Regular chiropody
Referral to vascular surgery E = Emergency admission; U = Urgent; S =
Soon; R = Routine.
• Critical limb ischaemia—E/U • Uncertainty about diagnosis—R
• Severe symptoms—S
• No better after exercise training—R

Critical limb ischaemia
Presentation Deteriorating claudication and nocturnal rest pain (usually
just after fallen asleep—hanging the foot out of bed improves the pain).
Ulceration or gangrene results from minor trauma.
Examination Look for:
• Atrophic skin changes—pallor, cool to the touch, hairless, shiny
• On lowering the leg turns a dusky blue-red colour; on elevation—
pallor and venous guttering
• Ulceration—check under the heel and between the toes
• Swelling suggests the patient is sleeping in a chair to avoid rest pain or,
rarely, pain from deep infection
• Absent foot pulses—if present, consider alternative diagnosis
• ABPI <0.5—0 arterial calcification can result in falsely high readings
Management Analgesia (often requires opioid); refer for urgent vascular
surgical assessment.
The diabetic foot b p. 360

Specialist management of peripheral arterial disease
• Angiography To assess extent and position of disease
• Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty ± stenting Most suitable for
short occlusions/stenoses of the iliac and superficial femoral vessels. 1y
patency rate 80–90%
• Surgery Most suitable for longer occlusions/multiple stenoses—
aortobifemoral bypass grafts have 5y patency rates >90%;
femoropopliteal bypass grafting gives 5y patency rates of <70%. Aspirin
d risk of re-occlusion. Amputation is a last option
Drug treatment of intermittent claudication Naftidrofuryl i
walking distance but it is unclear whether it influences outcome. Consider
only if supervised exercise has not led to improvement and the person
does not want or is unsuitable for angioplasty or bypass surgery. Reassess
after 3–6mo. Discontinue if no improvement.

Cardiology and vascular disease

Varicose veins
Tortuous, twisted, or lengthened veins. Prevalence: 17–31%. 4 > 5 (8 5:4). The
vein wall is inherently weak leading to dilatation and separation of the valve
cusps so they become incompetent. Blood flows backwards from the deep to
superficial venous system, causing back pressure and further dilatation.
Most varicose veins are primary. Risk factors: age, parity, occupations
requiring a lot of standing, obesity (women only). 2° causes: DVT, pelvic
tumour, pregnancy, or AV fistula.

Types
• Trunk Varicosities of the long or short saphenous vein or their
branches. May be symptomatic
• Reticular Usually asymptomatic. Dilated tortuous subcutaneous veins
not belonging to the main branches of the long or short saphenous vein
• Telangectasia Intradermal venules <1 mm—spider veins, thread veins,
star bursts, matted veins. Unsightly but otherwise asymptomatic

Presentation Consider:

• Why is the patient consulting now? Patients are often worried about
appearance of varicose veins or prognosis if left untreated but have no
other symptoms (1 in 3 consultations)
• Symptoms Heaviness, tension, aching (worse on standing and in the
evening; improved by elevating the leg and support stockings), itching
• Complications
• PMH Previous surgery or injection for varicose veins; pregnancy; past
history of DVT or thrombophlebitis; CHC or HRT
• FH Varicose veins or DVT

Examination
• Abdominal examination To exclude secondary causes
• Veins With the patient standing, inspect distribution of the veins and
any secondary skin changes. Patterns of distribution:
• Long saphenous distribution: thigh and medial aspect of the calf
• Short saphenous distribution: below the knee on the posterior and
lateral aspects of the calf

Management Reassurance is often all that is needed.
• If symptoms are troublesome Advise support stockings; avoid
standing for prolonged periods and if standing do not stand still; walk
regularly; d weight (if obese)
• If any complications or severe symptoms Refer for vascular surgical
assessment. In general, patients with purely cosmetic problems are not
treated under the NHS
• Check ABPI to exclude significant arterial disease before recommending compression hosiery (ABPI should be >0.8).

Bleeding varicose veins Bleeding can be stemmed by raising the foot
above the level of the heart and applying compression. If the patient is fit
for surgery, refer for surgical assessment. Once recovered from the bleed,
advise compression hosiery if ABPI >0.8.

Complications

•
•
•

• Thrombophlebitis
Haemorrhage
• Oedema
Varicose eczema
Skin pigmentation
Venous ulceration—40% do not have visible varicose veins
Atrophie blanche—white, lacy scars
Lipodermatosclerosis—fibrosis of the dermis and subcutis around the
ankle, resulting in firm induration

CHC and HRT Women with varicose veins taking CHC or HRT are
not at i risk of DVT but are at i risk of thrombophlebitis.

Saphena varix Dilatation of the saphenous vein at its confluence with
the femoral vein, which transmits a cough impulse. May have bluish tinge
and disappears on lying down. A cause of a lump in the groin. Action only
needed if symptomatic.

Thrombophlebitis Presents as severe pain, erythema, pigmentation
over, and hardening of the vein. Thrombophlebitis in varicose veins results
from stasis. Consider underlying malignancy or thrombophilia if thrombophlebitis occurs in normal veins or there is recurrent thrombophlebitis in
varicose veins.
Management There is no indication for antibiotics.
• Crepe bandaging to compress vein and minimize propagation of
thrombus (if ABPI >0.8)
• Analgesia—preferably NSAID
• Ice packs and elevation
• Low dose aspirin—75–150mg od
• If phlebitis extends up the long saphenous vein towards the
saphenofemoral junction, refer for urgent duplex scanning—saphenofemoral ligation may be indicated if thrombus extends into the femoral vein.
Follow-up If the patient is fit for surgery, refer for surgical assessment as
thrombophlebitis tends to recur if the underlying venous abnormality is
not corrected.
0 History of thrombophlebitis is a relative contraindication to CHC
(b p. 752). Evidence regarding HRT is less clear.

Thrombophlebitis migrans Recurrent tender nodules affecting
veins throughout the body. Associated with carcinoma of the pancreas.

Deep vein thrombosis
DVT may be proximal—involving veins above the knee—or isolated to
the calf veins. It may also occur in the cerebral sinus and veins of the arms,
retina, and mesentery. Incidence: 1 in 1,000 people/y.

Risk factors

Immediate action Clinical diagnosis is unreliable. <50% with clinically
suspected DVT have diagnosis confirmed on diagnostic imaging. In most
areas in the UK, rapid access DVT assessment clinics operate.
•
•
•
•

• If there will be a delay in investigation to exclude DVT, provide anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the interim.
Clinical prediction rules (e.g. Wells’ score—see Box 10.1) Are used to
decide whether patients fall into high or low probability groups for DVT.
• If low probability A blood D-dimer test is done. If the D-dimer test is
–ve, DVT is excluded. If +ve, the patient is assessed as if medium/high
probability
• If medium/high probability Compression USS assessment is undertaken
± D-dimer. If USS is negative and low probability or –ve D-dimer, DVT
is excluded. If USS is +ve, diagnosis of DVT is confirmed. If USS is –ve
and medium/high probability or +ve D-dimer, USS is repeated after 1wk
or the patient is assessed with venography, CT, or MRI
D-dimer testing Detects a degradation product of fresh venous thrombus.
It may be available as a near-patient test with a result in <15min in some
practices—do not delay referral to await result if near-patient testing with
rapid result is not available. A normal D-dimer result has a high negative predictive value making DVT unlikely. However raised D-dimer levels are not
specific for venous thromboembolism. Other causes of i D-dimer include:
• Recent trauma
• Sepsis
• Malignancy
• Inflammation
• Liver impairment
• Pregnancy
• Wound healing

Deep vein thrombosis

Management of patients with confirmed DVT
• Initial anticoagulation is with LMWH followed by oral anticoagulation
(usually warfarin as an outpatient)
• LMWH should be continued for at least 4d and until INR is in
therapeutic range for ≥2d. Target INR 2.5 (range 2–3)
• Oral anticoagulants d risk of further thromboembolism and should be
continued for 3–6mo after a single DVT (b p. 672)
• Graduated elastic compression stockings—should be worn for >2y as
they d risk post-thrombotic leg syndrome by 12–50%
0 If a patient has a DVT and there is no obvious cause:
• If <45y, consider thrombophilia
• If >45y, consider undiagnosed cancer
Management during pregnancy b p. 824

Complications of DVT
• Pulmonary embolus Without treatment 20% with proximal DVT
develop PE (b p. 1090)
• Post-thrombotic syndrome Occurs after DVT. Results in chronic
venous hypertension causing limb pain, swelling, hyperpigmentation,
dermatitis, ulcers, venous gangrene, and lipodermatosclerosis
• Recurrent venous thromboembolism Patients with history of DVT
or PE have i risk of recurrence in high-risk situations (trauma, surgery,
immobility, pregnancy) and should receive prophylaxis with heparin/
oral anticoagulants in such situations

Box 10.1 Wells’ diagnostic algorithm
Score 1 point if
• Active cancer (ongoing treatment or treatment in the past 6mo, or
palliative care)
• Paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the legs
• Recently bedridden for ≥3d or major surgery in the past 12wk (GA
or regional anaesthesia)
• Localized tenderness along the distribution of the deep vein system
(e.g. back of the calf)
• Entire leg swelling
• Calf diameter of affected leg (measured 10cm below the tibial
tuberosity) >3cm greater than that of the unaffected leg

Breathlessness
Dyspnoea Sensation of shortness of breath. Speed of onset helps diag-

nosis (see Table 11.1). Try to quantify exercise tolerance (e.g. dressing,
distance walked, climbing stairs).
Acute breathlessness b p. 1088

Exertional dyspnoea Breathlessness with exercise. Causes are the same
as dyspnoea generally. The New York Heart Association classifies four
grades of severity:
• Normal
• Moderate Walking on the level causes breathlessness
• Severe Has to stop due to breathlessness when walking on the flat. All
but the lightest housework is impossible
• Gross Slightest effort l severe breathlessness. The patient is almost
bed/chair-bound
Orthopnoea Dyspnoea on lying flat and relieved by sitting up. Associated
with left heart dysfunction, e.g. LVF.
Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnoea Acute form of dyspnoea that causes the
patient to awake from sleep. The patient is forced to sit upright or stand
out of bed for relief. Associated with pulmonary oedema.
Combined chest pain and dyspnoea Consider:
• Chest infection
• PE
• MI
• Pulmonary malignancy
• Oesophageal pain
• Pericarditis
• Dissecting aneurysm • Musculoskeletal pain
• Refer any patient with symptoms/signs of superior vena cava obstruction (acute breathlessness, headache worse on stooping, swelling of the
face and/or neck with fixed elevation of jugular venous pressure) for
immediate medical or oncology assessmentN. Refer any patient with
unexplained dyspnoea of >3wk duration for urgent CXRN.

Respiratory rate Normal rate for an adult is 14 breaths/min at rest.
Higher in children:
• Neonate: 30–60 breaths/min
• Infant: 20–40 breaths/min
• 1–3y: 20–30 breaths/min

i respiratory rate Consider:
• Lung disease, e.g.
pneumonia, asthma
• Heart disease, e.g. LVF
• Metabolic disease, e.g.
ketoacidosis
d respiratory rate Consider:
• CNS disease, e.g. CVA

• 4–10y: 15–25 breaths/min
• >10y: 15–20 breaths/min

• Drugs, e.g. salicylate
overdose
• Psychiatric causes, e.g.
hyperventilation

• Drugs, e.g. opioids

Cheyne–Stokes respiration Breathing becomes progressively deeper

and then shallower (± episodic apnoea) in cycles. Causes: brainstem lesions/
compression (stroke, i ICP); chronic pulmonary oedema; poor cardiac output. It is enhanced by narcotics.

Cough
A cough is a reaction to irritation anywhere from pharynx to lungs.
Acute cough (<3wk) Causes:
• Acute exacerbation of normally
• URTI
well-controlled asthma
• Croup
• Inhaled foreign body—especially
• Tracheitis
in well children
• Acute bronchitis
• Pneumonia—productive, loose cough
Reserve CXR for patients with marked focal chest signs or where inhalation of foreign body or lung cancer is suspected.
Management Treat the cause where possible; advise OTC cough mixture
as needed, e.g. simple linctus; steam inhalation often eases symptoms temporarily; review if not clearing.
Reasons to prescribe antibiotics immediatelyN Investigate further and/
or give antibiotics immediately (e.g. amoxicillin 500mg tds/clarithromycin
500mg bd/doxycycline 100mg od) if the patient:
• Is systemically very unwell or has symptoms/signs suggestive of serious
illness and/or complications, e.g. pneumonia
• Is at high risk of serious complications because of pre-existing
co-morbidity, e.g. significant heart, lung, renal, liver, or neuromuscular
disease, immunosuppression, CF, and young children born prematurely
• Is aged >65y with acute cough and ≥2 or more of the following, or
aged >80y with acute cough and ≥1 of the following:
• Hospitalization in the
• History of congestive heart failure
previous year
• Current use of oral
• Type 1 or type 2 DM
glucocorticoids

Chronic cough (>3wk) Causes:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Post-nasal drip
Post-viral
COPD/asthma
Lung cancer
Pertussis
TB

•
•
•
•
•
•

Bronchiectasis
Pulmonary oedema
Foreign body
Vocal cord palsy
GORD
LVF

• Drug-induced (e.g.
ACE inhibitors)
• Smokers’ cough
• Idiopathic
• Ear wax
• Psychogenic

• Red flags Weight d, night sweats.
Management Refer any patient with a persistent cough for >3wk for
urgent CXRN. Treat the cause. If no cause is found, refer.

Sputum
• Absolutely clear sputum is probably saliva
• Smoking is the leading cause of excess sputum production—look for
black specks of inhaled carbon
• Yellow-green sputum is due to cell debris (bronchial epithelium,
neutrophils, eosinophils) and is not always infected
• Bronchiectasis causes copious greenish sputum
• Bloodstained sputum (haemoptysis) always needs full investigation
• Pink froth suggests pulmonary oedema

Cough

Haemoptysis Expectoration of blood/bloodstained sputum. Causes:
• Infection—bronchitis, pneumonia, • Cardiac: acute LVF, mitral stenosis
lung abscess, TB
• Blood dyscrasia/bleeding diathesis
• Violent coughing
• Idiopathic pulmonary
• Bronchiectasis
haemosiderosis
• Lung cancer
• Bronchial adenoma
• PE (blood is not mixed with
• Mycosis, e.g. aspergilloma
sputum)
• Goodpasture’s syndrome
• Inhaled foreign body
• Collagen vascular disease, e.g.
• Iatrogenic: anticoagulation,
PAN, Wegener’s granulomatosis
endotracheal tube
• Unknown
• Trauma
0 Differentiate from haematemesis or local bleeding from the naso­
pharynx or sinuses. Melaena may occur if enough blood is swallowed.
Management Always requires investigation to find the cause.
• Admit as an acute medical emergency if the patient is compromised by
the bleeding (i.e. tachycardia, low BP, postural drop) or has symptoms/
signs of a cause requiring acute admission (e.g. PE, acute LVF)
• If not compromised by the bleeding, refer for urgent CXRN
• Refer for urgent chest physician assessment if abnormal CXR,
persistent haemoptysis with normal CXR, aged >40y and smoker/
ex-smoker, or normal CXR but high suspicion of lung cancerN
0 In patients with lung cancer who have a massive haemoptysis, consider
whether it is a terminal event. If so, consider treating with IV morphine/diamorphine and a sedative (e.g. midazolam or rectal diazepam) rather than admitting.
Bronchiectasis Consider in any patient with persistent or recurrent
chest infections. Permanently dilated bronchi act as sumps for infected
mucus. Causes:
• Congenital CF, Kartagener syndrome
• Post-infection TB, pertussis, measles, pneumonia
• Other Bronchial obstruction, aspergillosis (b p. 328),
hypogammaglobulinaemia (b p. 684), gastric aspiration
Presentation
• Mild cases Asymptomatic with winter exacerbations consisting of
fever, cough, purulent sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea
• More severe cases Persistent cough and sputum, haemoptysis,
clubbing, low-pitched inspiratory and expiratory crackles, and wheeze
Investigations CXR; sputum—M,C&S; spirometry—reversible airways
obstruction is common; high-resolution CT detects disease in 97% cases.
Management Refer to a respiratory physician. Treatment includes physio­
therapy, antibiotics, bronchodilators, vaccination (influenza and pneumococcal), and (rarely) surgery.

Respiratory medicine

Chest signs
Chest deformity

• Barrel chest The antero-posterior diameter of the chest is high
compared to the lateral diameter, and expansion is d. Ribs move
in a pump handle, up-and-down motion. Associated with chronic
hyperinflation (e.g. asthma or COPD)
• Pigeon chest (pectus carinatum) Prominent sternum and flat chest
associated with history of chronic childhood asthma or rickets
• Funnel chest (pectus excavatum) The lower end of sternum is
depressed. Often inherited or idiopathic and usually harmless
• Kyphosis i forward spinal convexity usually affecting thoracic spine
• Postural (‘drooping shoulders’ or ‘roundback’): is common and
voluntarily correctable
• Structural: cannot correct voluntarily. Causes: osteoporosis, Paget’s
disease, ankylosing spondylitis, Scheuermann’s disease. May cause a
restrictive ventilatory defect and eventually respiratory failure
• Scoliosis b p. 478
• Harrison’s sulcus Groove deformity of the lower ribs at the
diaphragm attachment site. Suggests chronic childhood asthma or
rickets
• Scars Are there any scars indicative of previous chest surgery?
Chest expansion Expansion should be symmetrical and equal. If not
suspect chest pathology (e.g. consolidation, collapse, pneumothorax, effusion—see Table 11.2) on the side with d movement.

Vocal fremitus or resonance
• i transmission Implies consolidation. Even whispered sounds are
heard clearly with a stethoscope (whispering pectoriloquy)
• d transmission Implies something in the way blocking the transmission
of sound. Consider: air (e.g. pneumothorax), fluid (e.g. effusion), pleural
thickening (e.g. mesothelioma)
Percussion Define any areas of dullness to percussion by percussing
from a resonant to dull area. Interpretation:
• i resonance—emphysema or pneumothorax (b p. 1090)
• d resonance—consolidation, collapse, abscess, tumour, fibrosis
• Stony dullness—pleural effusion

Breath sounds Assess character of breath sounds and added sounds:
• Bronchial breathing Breath sounds are harsher than normal and there
is an audible gap between inspiration and expiration—often caused by
lung consolidation, e.g. due to pneumonia
• d breath sounds Consider: pleural effusion, pneumothorax,
emphysema, lung collapse
• Added sounds Pleural rub; wheeze; crepitations/crackles
Wheeze Musical sound heard during expiration.
• Polyphonic wheeze Indicates narrowing of many small airways—
typical of asthma or COPD
• Monophonic wheeze Indicates single large airway obstruction, e.g. due
to foreign body or tumour

Chest signs

Crackles in the chest Produced by airflow moving secretions.

• Fine crackles Consider pulmonary oedema (early inspiratory—usually
best heard at the lung bases at the back); early pneumonia; fibrosing
alveolitis (late inspiratory)
• Coarse crackles Consider TB; resolving pneumonia; bronchiectasis;
lung abscess
Pleural rub Creaking sound produced by movement of visceral over
parietal pleura when both are inflamed (e.g. pneumonia, infarction).
Pleural effusion Fluid in the pleural cavity. Simple effusions may be transudates (<30g/L protein) or exudates (>30g/L protein). Effusions may also
be blood, lymph, or pus (empyema). Causes of simple effusion:
• Constrictive pericarditis
• Malignancy, e.g. lung cancer,
• Inflammation (SLE, RA,
mesothelioma, Meig’s syndrome
pancreatitis, asbestos exposure)
• Infection (e.g pneumonia, TB)
• Hypoproteinaemia
• Infarction (PE)
• Hypothyroidism
• Heart failure
Presentation May be incidental finding on CXR. Symptoms: dyspnoea,
pleuritic pain, symptoms of underlying cause. Signs: absent breath sounds,
dullness to percussion, d tactile vocal fremitus, d vocal resonance. Above
the effusion, there is usually a zone of bronchial breathing. Early on there
may be a pleural rub. Large effusions shift the mediastinum away from
the affected side and there may be d chest wall movement. Confirm with
CXR. If cause is not immediately apparent refer for diagnostic tap.
Management Treat the underlying cause. Refer for drainage if symptomatic. Repeated drainage ± pleurodesis may be necessary.
Surgical emphysema Air in the subcutaneous tissue. Can be caused
by spontaneous pneumothorax or trauma to the chest wall. Tissues
appear swollen and crackle on palpation

Other signs of respiratory disease
Weight loss Non-specific symptom or sign. Consider:
• GI causes Malabsorption, malnutrition, dieting
• Chronic disease Hyperthyroidism, DM, COPD, heart failure, renal
disease, degenerative neurological/muscle disease, chronic infection
(e.g. TB, HIV)
• Malignancy
• Psychiatric causes Depression, dementia, anorexia
• Refer any patient with unexplained weight loss for urgent CXRN.

Cachexia Severe generalized muscle wasting. Causes: neoplasia, malnutrition, chronic infection (e.g. TB), prolonged inactivity, dementia.
Night sweats Consider: TB, lymphoma, leukaemia, solid tumour (e.g.
renal carcinoma), menopause, anxiety states.

Erythema nodosum b p. 600
Peripheral oedema b p. 232
Horner’s syndrome Sympathetic nerve disruption to the iris causes:

•
•
•
•

Small (miotic) pupil with lack of pupil dilation in the dark
Partial lid ptosis
Anhydrosis of the forehead, and
Enophthalmos

Causes
• Pancoast, cervical cord or mediastinal tumour
• Aortic aneurysm
• Posterior inferior artery or basilar artery occlusion
• Hypothalamic lesion
• Syringomyelia
J. F. Horner (1831–1886), Swiss ophthalmologist.

Pallor Check eyes/mucous membranes for pallor suggesting anaemia.
Cyanosis b p. 232
Flapping tremor/asterixis Bilateral motor disturbance. Ask the

patient to hold his hands straight out in front of him and dorsiflex his
hands—this provokes a flapping, asynchronous tremor which is absent at
rest. Due to CO2 retention in severe COPD.
Lymphadenopathy b p. 938
• Refer any patient with supraclavicular or cervical lymphadenopathy
persisting >3wk for urgent CXRN.
• Refer any unexplained lump in the neck of recent onset, or any previously undiagnosed neck lump that has changed over a period of 3–6wk,
for urgent further investigationN.

Other signs of respiratory disease

Clubbing b p. 605
• Refer any patient with unexplained nail clubbing for urgent CXRN.

Yellow nails b p. 604
Hoarseness b p. 936
• Refer urgently for chest X-ray (CXR)N ALL patients with hoarseness for >3wk—particularly smokers aged >50y and heavy drinkers.
• If there is a POSITIVE finding on CXR Refer urgently to a team
specializing in the management of lung cancer
• If there is a NEGATIVE finding on CXR Refer urgently to a team
specializing in the management of head and neck cancer
Stridor b p. 937
Jugular venous pressure b p. 233
The trachea
• Palpate the trachea in the supraclavicular notch in the midline
• Deviation to the left or right suggests a shift of the upper mediastinum
to that side
• The distance between the suprasternal notch and cricoid cartilage
in an adult is 2–3 finger breadths. If it is less than this, the lungs are
probably hyperinflated

Respiratory medicine

Respiratory investigations
Indications for urgent CXRN

• Haemoptysis
• Any of the following if unexplained or present for more >3wk:
• Weight loss
• Cough
• Chest signs
• Chest/shoulder pain
• Hoarseness
• Dyspnoea
• Cervical/supraclavicular lymphadenopathy • Finger clubbing
• Signs suggesting metastases (brain, bone, liver, skin)
Peak flow A simple and cheap test. Peak flow is not a good measure of
airflow limitation as it tends to overestimate lung function. It is best used
to monitor progress of disease and effects of treatment for patients with
asthma. Link with self-management plan (b p. 310). Peak flow meters are
available on NHS. Peak flow charts are available from NHS supplies (form
FP1010) and drug companies.
Measuring peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR)
• Ask the patient to stand up (if possible) and hold the peak flow meter
horizontally. Check the indicator is at zero and the track clear
• Ask the patient to take a deep breath in and blow out forcefully into
the meter ensuring lips are sealed firmly around the mouthpiece
• Read the PEFR off the meter. The best of three attempts is recorded
• Consider using a low range meter if predicted or best PEFR is <250L/min
• Normal values—see Table 11.4 (b p. 304)
Spirometry Measures the volume of air the patient (adult or child >5y)
is able to expel from the lungs after a maximal inspiration (see Table 11.3).
• FEV1 Volume of air the patient is able to exhale in the first second of
forced expiration
• FVC Total volume of air the patient can forcibly exhale in one breath
• FEV1/FVC Ratio of FEV1 to FVC expressed as a %
Measuring FEV1 and FVC Sit the patient comfortably, then:
• Ask the patient to take a deep breath in
• Ask the patient to blow the whole breath out as hard as possible until
there is no breath left to expel and ensuring lips are sealed firmly
around the mouthpiece; encourage the patient to keep breathing out
• Repeat the procedure twice (i.e. three attempts in all)
• At least two readings should be within 100mL or 5% of each other
• Normal values—see Table 11.5 (b p. 305)
Flow volume measurement Available with some spirometers—see Figure 11.1.
Fractional exhaled nitric oxide concentration Exhaled nitric
oxide concentration is i in patients with asthma or other inflammatory
respiratory conditions. Measurement of exhaled nitric oxide (usually with
hand-held monitor) can be a useful test to support a diagnosis of asthma
or assess response to treatment. A normal result does not exclude a diagnosis of asthma.
RCP three questions Useful tool to identify patients with poor
asthma control in general practice and monitor effect of changes of treatment. Morbidity categories correlate with lung function.

Respiratory investigations

In the last month
• Have you had any difficulty sleeping because of your asthma symptoms
(including cough)?
• Have you had your usual asthma symptoms during the day (cough,
wheeze, chest tightness, or breathlessness)?
• Has your asthma interfered with your usual activities, e.g. housework,
work/school etc.?
NO to all questions = low morbidity.
1x YES answer = medium morbidity.
2 or 3x YES answers = high morbidity.
0 Alternatives include the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) and
Asthma Control Test (ACT)/Children’s Asthma Control Test. These
questionnaires are not designed for use during an acute attack.

Respiratory medicine

Bronchodilators and steroids
Bronchodilators Cause relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle.
Short-acting β2 agonists (e.g. salbutamol, terbutaline). Safest, most effective β2 agonists for use as quick relievers in asthma and COPD.
• Duration of action: 73–5h. Oral preparations are less effective than
inhaled preparations. Prescribe as 1–2 puffs prn
• Warn patients to seek medical advice if usual dose does not relieve
symptoms or relieves symptoms for <3h
• Regular treatment with bronchodilators alone may be linked with
worsening of asthma and asthma deaths. If the patient has asthma and
is using a β2 agonist inhaler >2x/wk, consider prophylaxis—b p. 312
Longer-acting β2 agonists (e.g. salmeterol, formoterol)
• Asthma (e.g. salmeterol 50–100 micrograms bd), as an adjunct to existing
corticosteroid treatment—b p. 312. Particularly useful for night time
asthma. Duration of action is 712h. Not for relief of acute attacks
• COPD—b p. 316

Steroids Short- and long-term treatment of inflammatory conditions.
• Oral steroids Prescribe as a single dose in the morning. Often started
at high dose (e.g. 40–50mg od) to suppress disease process and then
stopped after improvement. If used as maintenance therapy, use the
minimum dose that controls disease. Supply with a ‘steroid card’
• Inhaled steroids Use regularly to obtain maximum benefit. Alleviation
of symptoms occurs 3–7d after initiation. If causes coughing, try a
short-acting β2 agonist before use. Common unwanted effects are oral
candidiasis (5%) and hoarseness—d by use of a large volume spacer or
mouthwashing after use
0 Beclometasone inhalers should be prescribed by brand name.
Side effects
•
• i BP
• Osteoporosis ± fracture
•
• Proximal muscle wasting
•
• Euphoria
• Paranoid states/
•
depression—especially if PMH
• Peptic ulceration—soluble or
enteric-coated versions may d risk
• Suppression of clinical signs—may
allow diseases, e.g. septicaemia,
to reach advanced stage before •
•
being recognized

Spread of infection, e.g.
chickenpox
DM/worsening of diabetic control
Cushing’s syndrome—moon face,
striae, and acne
Adrenal atrophy—can persist
years after stopping long-term
steroids—illness/surgical
emergencies may need to be
covered with steroid supplements
Growth suppression in children
Na+ and water retention; K+ loss
Steroid cards Should be carried by patients on oral/high doses of inhaled
steroids. The card informs other practitioners that the patient is on steroids and gives the patient advice on use of steroids and risk of infection.
Steroid cards can be obtained from: F 0161 6832189 E-mail: nhsforms@

Bronchodilators and steroids

Withdrawal of steroids Stop abruptly if disease is unlikely to relapse, the
patient has received treatment for ≤3wk and is not included in the patient
groups described in the following list. Withdraw gradually if disease is
unlikely to relapse and the patient has:
• Recently had repeated steroid courses (particularly if taken for >3wk)
• Taken a short course <1y after stopping long-term therapy
• Other possible causes of adrenal suppression
• Received >40mg od of prednisolone (or equivalent)
• Been given repeat doses in the evening
• Received treatment with steroids for >3wk
During corticosteroid withdrawal, d dose rapidly to physiological levels
(77.5mg od prednisolone)—thereafter d more slowly. Assess the disease
during withdrawal to ensure relapse does not occur.

Use of spacers with metered-dose inhalers (MDIs)
Advantages of using a spacer Allows more time for evaporation of propellant so a larger proportion of active drug is deposited in the lungs;
there is no need to coordinate actuation with inhalation; results in less
oropharyngeal side effects (e.g. thrush, hoarseness with inhaled steroids).
Use of spacers Both large Volumatic® spacers and medium-volume devices
(e.g. AeroChamber®) are widely available, acceptable, and portable. Inhale
the drug from the spacer immediately after actuation as effect of the drugs is
short-lived. Spacers should be washed and air-dried weekly to prevent build-up
of electrostatic charge affecting drug delivery, and replaced every 6–12mo.
Home nebulizer therapy In England and Wales nebulizers are not available via the NHS (but are free of VAT). Some nebulizers are available in
Scotland on form GP10A. Nebulizers convert a solution of drug into an
aerosol for inhalation. They are used to deliver a higher dosage of drug
than is usual with inhalers over a short period of time (5–10min). List of
available devices—BNF 3.1.5. Indications:
• Acute exacerbations ± regular treatment of asthma/COPD
• Antibiotic treatment—for patients with chronic, purulent infection,
e.g. CF, bronchiectasis; prophylaxis and treatment of pneumocystis
pneumonia with pentamidine in patients with AIDS
• Palliative care—palliation of breathlessness and cough, e.g.
bronchodilators, lidocaine, or bupivacaine for dry, persistent cough
Use in asthma/COPD Before suggesting long-term use:
• Review diagnosis, technique using handheld device ± spacer, and
compliance
• Try i dose of bronchodilator via a handheld device for at least 2wk
• Perform a 2wk trial of nebulizer therapy and monitor therapeutic
effect (e.g. with PEFR in asthma or dyspnoea score with COPD)
• Provide clear instructions on the use of the nebulizer, monitoring and
when to seek help. Follow up regularly

Management of an acute asthma attack b pp. 1092–7
Asthma is a condition of paroxysmal, reversible airways obstruction with
3 characteristic features:
• Airflow limitation—usually reversible spontaneously or with treatment
• Airway hyper-responsiveness to a wide range of stimuli
• Inflammation of the bronchi
Prevalence European Respiratory Health Survey figures:
• 25% adults aged 20–44y suffer from wheeze ± breathlessness
• 7% have doctor-diagnosed asthma (1–2% occupational asthma)

Asthma in special groups
• Children b pp. 882–7
• Pregnancy b p. 822
• Occupational asthma b p. 336
Diagnosis of asthma Is based on recognition of a characteristic pattern of symptoms/signs in the absence of an alternative explanation.
Clinical features that i probability of asthma >1 of:
• Wheeze
• Chest tightness
• Breathlessness
• Cough
Particularly if:
• Symptoms are worse:
• At night/early morning
• With exercise, allergen and/
or cold air exposure
• After aspirin/β-blockers

•

• Voice disturbance
• Prominent dizziness,
light-headedness, peripheral tingling • Symptoms with colds only
• Smoking history (>20 pack y)
• Chronic productive cough
• Cardiac disease
without wheeze/breathlessness
• Normal PEFR/spirometry when
• Normal examination of chest

0 Normal spirometry when asymptomatic does not exclude asthma.
Tests Spirometry is the preferred initial test. Interpret PEFR records with
caution. They are more useful for monitoring established asthma.

Asthma in adults

Differential diagnosis Airflow obstruction = FEV1/FVC <0.7.
Airflow obstruction
• COPD
• Bronchiectasis*
• Inhaled foreign body*
• Obliterative bronchiolitis
• Large airway stenosis
• Lung cancer*
• Sarcoidosis*

No airflow obstruction
• Chronic cough syndromes
• Hyperventilation syndrome
• Vocal cord dysfunction
• Rhinitis
• Gastro-oesophageal reflux
• Heart failure
• Pulmonary fibrosis

* May also be associated with non-obstructive spirometry.

Action
High probability of asthma Give trial of treatment with inhaled beclometasone 200 micrograms bd (or equivalent) for 6–8wk. If response is
poor despite adequate inhaler technique/concordance, investigate further.
0 If significant airflow obstruction, there may be inhaled steroid resistance. Treat with oral prednisolone 30mg od for 2wk instead.
Intermediate probability of asthma
• If FEV1/FVC <0.7 (i.e. significant airways obstruction)—offer reversibility
testing and/or trial of treatment. If significant reversibility and/or trial of
treatment is beneficial, treat as asthma. If insignificant reversibility and
treatment trial is not beneficial, consider tests for alternative diagnoses
• If FEV1/FVC >0.7 (i.e. no evidence of airways obstruction), arrange
further investigations before commencing treatment ± refer
Low probability of asthma Consider alternative diagnoses and investigate/
manage accordingly. Reconsider asthma if no response.
Reversibility testing For patients with diagnostic uncertainty:
• If airflow obstruction is present at the time of assessment—assess
FEV1 (or PEFR) and/or symptoms before and after 400 micrograms of
inhaled salbutamol via MDI and spacer
• If no airflow obstruction is present or response to inhaled salbutamol
is uncertain—assess FEV1 (or PEFR) and/or symptoms after trial
of treatment with inhaled (beclometasone 200 micrograms bd or
equivalent) or oral steroids (prednisolone 30mg od for 14d)
>400mL i in FEV1 suggests asthma. If smaller improvement—decide
whether to continue treatment based on assessment of symptoms. Trial
of treatment withdrawal may be helpful if there is doubt.
Other investigations to consider in primary care CXR—consider
if atypical/additional symptoms; exhaled nitrous oxide testing, eosinophil count.

Asthma management in practice
Aims of treatment To:
• d symptoms and impact on lifestyle (e.g. absence from work/school)
• Minimize the need for reliever medication
• Prevent severe attacks/exacerbations
GP services Routine asthma care should be carried out in a specialized clinic. Doctors/nurses involved need appropriate training and regular
updates. Practices should keep an asthma register to ensure adequate
follow-up and allow audit. 0 Not all patients want to attend a pre­
arranged appointment. Telephone reviews may be as effective as face-toface consultations.
Reviews and monitoring Frequency depends on needs. Aim to
review all patients with asthma at least annually (see Figure 11.2).
• Check symptoms since last seen. Use objective measures, e.g. RCP
three questions (b p. 303)
• Record smoking status and advise smokers to stop
• Record any exacerbations/acute attacks since last seen
• Check medication—use, concordance (prescription count—
b p. 142), inhaler technique, problems, side effects
• Check influenza/pneumococcal vaccination received
• Review objective measures of lung function e.g. home PEFR chart,
PEFR/spirometry at review
• Address any problems or queries and educate about asthma
• Agree management goals and date for further review
Self-management All patients should receive:
• Self-management education Brief, simple education linked to patient
goals is most likely to be successful. Include information about: nature
of disease, nature of the treatment and how to use it, self-monitoring/
self-assessment, recognition of acute exacerbations, allergen/trigger
avoidance, patients’ own goals of treatment
• Written action plan Focus on individual needs. Include information
about symptom triggers and peak flow levels that indicate when
asthma is worsening, and guidance about what to do under those
circumstances. Action plans d morbidity and health costs from asthmaS
• PEFR monitoring Record PEFR at asthma review and if acute
exacerbation. Home monitoring + action plan can be useful, especially
for patients with severe asthma, brittle asthma (i.e. rapid development
of acute asthma attacks) and/or if poor perceivers of symptoms
• Be aware that those from ethnic minorities, socially disadvantaged
groups, those with communication problems, adolescents, and the elderly
have complex needs.

Drug treatment of asthma
Management of acute asthma b pp. 1092–7
Use a stepwise approachG (see Figure 11.3). Start at the step most

appropriate to the initial severity of symptoms. The aim is to achieve early
control of the condition and then to d treatment by stepping down.

Exacerbations Treat early. In adult patients on 200 microgram doses
of inhaled steroids, a 5x i in dose reduces severity of exacerbations.
Alternatively, and in all other cases, use prednisolone 30–40mg od for 1–2wk.
Selection of inhaler device If possible use an MDI. Inadequate technique may result in drug failure. Patients must inhale slowly and hold their
breath for 10s after inhalation. Demonstrate inhaler technique before
prescribing and check at follow-ups. Spacers/breath-activated devices
are useful if patients find activation difficult. Dry powder inhalers are an
alternative.
Short-acting β2 agonists b p. 306 (e.g. salbutamol). Work more
quickly and with fewer side effects than alternatives. Use prn unless shown
to benefit from regular dosing. Using �2 canisters/mo or >10–12 puffs/d is
a marker of poorly controlled asthma.
0 A budesonide/formoterol combination inhaler is an alternative rescue
medication.
Inhaled corticosteroids (b p. 306) Effective preventer. May be beneficial even for patients with mild asthma. Consider if: exacerbation of
asthma in the last 2y requiring steroids; using inhaled β2 agonists �3x/wk;
or symptomatic � 3x/wk or �1 night/wk.
Oral steroids b p. 306
Add-on therapy Aims to improve lung function/symptoms. Before
initiating a new drug, check compliance, inhaler technique, and eliminate
trigger factors. Only continue if of demonstrable benefit.
• Inhaled long-acting β2 agonists (LABA) b p. 306 (e.g. salmeterol).
Do not use without inhaled steroids. Combination inhalers (steroid +
LABA) improve compliance
• Leukotriene receptor agonists (e.g. montelukast) d exacerbations
• Theophylline Side effects are common
Stepping down Review and consider stepping down at intervals �3mo.
Maintain on the lowest dose of inhaled steroid controlling symptoms.
When reducing steroids, cut dose by 25–50% each time.
Omalizumab Monoclonal antibody that binds to circulating IgE. Useful
for adults and children >6y if allergy is a factor in asthma, on high-dose
inhaled steroid + LABA, and frequent exacerbations. Given sc every
2–4wk. Always specialist-initiated.
Complementary therapies Buteyko breathing technique d symptoms/bronchodilator use. Immunotherapy in specialist clinics is effective
for patients with specific allergies. Other complementary therapies—no
convincing evidence of effectiveness.

Drug treatment of asthma

* All doses given refer to hydrofluoroalkane-beclometasone dipropionate (BDP-HFA) equivalent
inhalers. For other drugs/formulations adjust dose accordingly (see BNF Section 3).

Respiratory medicine

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a slowly progressive
disorder characterized by airflow obstruction. Affects 716% of the population in the 40–68y age group (73 million people in the UK—two-thirds
undiagnosed). 4 > 5. Responsible for 75% of deaths.

Causes
•
•
•
•

Cigarette smoking
Genetic—bronchial hyperresponsiveness; α1-antitrypsin deficiency
Race—Chinese and Afro-Caribbeans have d susceptibility
Diet—poor diet and low birthweight

Diagnosis Is suggested by history, signs, and baseline spirometry.
Consider in any patient >35y with a risk factor for COPD (generally smoking) and �1 of:
• Shortness of breath on exertion—use an objective measure, e.g. MRC
dyspnoea scale (see Table 11.6) to grade breathlessness
• Chronic cough
• Regular sputum production
•	 Wheeze
• Frequent winter ‘bronchitis’
Table 11.6 MRC dyspnoea scale
Grade

Degree of breathlessness related to physical activity

1

Not troubled by breathlessness, except on strenuous exercise

2

Short of breath when hurrying or walking up a slight hill

3

Walks slower than contemporaries on level ground because of
breathlessness or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace

4

Stops for breath after walking 100m or after a few minutes on level ground

5

Too breathless to leave the house or breathless on dressing/undressing

If diagnosis is suspected also ask about weight d, effort intolerance, waking at night, ankle swelling, fatigue, and occupational hazards.
• Chest pain or haemoptysis are uncommon in COPD—if present consider an alternative diagnosis.
Signs May be none. Possible signs:
• Hyperinflated chest ± poor
chest expansion on inspiration
• d cricosternal distance
• Hyperresonant chest with d
cardiac dullness on percussion
• Wheeze or quiet breath sounds
• Paradoxical movement of
lower ribs

• Use of accessory muscles
• Tachypnoea
• Pursing of lips on expiration
(purse lip breathing)
• Peripheral oedema
• Cyanosis
• i JVP
• Cachexia

Spirometry (b p. 302) Predicts severity (see Table 11.7) and prognosis
but not disability/quality of life. Diagnose airflow obstruction if:
• FEV1/FVC <0.7 (<70%), and
• FEV1 <70% predicted (QOF criterion), and
• <15% response to a reversibility test

Reversibility testing Can be misleading. Not routinely recommended:
• >400mL i in FEV1 following trial of bronchodilator or prednisolone
(30mg od for 2wk) suggests asthma
• Clinically significant COPD is not present if FEV1 and FEV1/FVC return
to normal after drug therapy
PEFR (b p. 302) Patients with COPD have little variability in PEFR. Serial
home PEFR measurements can help distinguish between asthma and
COPD. PEFR may underestimate severity of airflow limitation and a normal PEFR does not exclude airflow obstruction.
Other investigations organized in primary care
• CXR Indicated to exclude other diagnoses, e.g. lung cancer
• FBC To identify polycythaemia or anaemia
• BMI
• α1-antitrypsin If early onset COPD or family history
• ECG/echo If cor pulmonale is suspected
• Sputum culture If purulent sputum is persistent

Respiratory medicine

Management of COPD
Record values of spirometric tests performed at diagnosis and review. At
each review record current symptoms, problems since last seen, exercise
tolerance, and smoking status. Calculate BODE score if possible. Educate
the patient/family about COPD, medication, and self-help strategies.

Non-drug therapy
• Smoking cessation Most important. Improves outcome (see Table 11.9).
• Vaccination Offer pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccination
• Exercise Lack of exercise d FEV1. Pulmonary rehabilitation is of
proven benefit—refer directly or via respiratory physicians
• Nutrition Weight d in obese patients improves exercise tolerance
Screening for depression b p. 199
Drug therapy Treat according to severity (Table 11.7); document
effects of each drug treatment on symptoms, quality of life, and lung function as tried—see Figure 11.4.
Management of acute exacerbations b p. 318

Referral for specialist care

• Assessment for:
• LTOT
• Long-term oral steroids
• Withdrawal of long-term
steroids
• Long-term nebulizer therapy
• Pulmonary rehabilitation
• Surgery, e.g. lung transplant
Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) Only prescribe after evaluation by a respiratory physician. Refer patients with:
• Severe airflow obstruction (FEV1 <30%—consider if 30–49%)
• Hypoxaemia (oxygen saturation ≤92% breathing air)
• Cyanosis
• Peripheral oedema
• Polycythaemia
• i JVP
Treatment for >15h/d i survival and quality of life. Ambulatory oxygen
therapy can i exercise tolerance in some patients. 0 Always warn
patients about the fire risks of having pure oxygen in their homes.
O2 cylinders and associated equipment Arrangements for supply of oxygen are different in England and Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland—
see BNF section 3.6. Specify amount of O2 required (h/d) and flow rate. O2
concentrators are more economical for LTOT. Supply back-up cylinders in
case of breakdown or power cut.

Acute exacerbations of COPD
Presentation Worsening of previous stable condition. Features: ≥1 of:

• i dyspnoea—marked dyspnoea, • i wheeze
• Chest tightness
tachypnoea (>25 breaths/min),
use of accessory muscles at rest • i cough
and purse lip breathing are signs • i sputum purulence
• i sputum volume
of severe exacerbation
• Upper airways symptoms,
• d exercise tolerance—marked
e.g. colds, sore throats,
d in activities of daily living is a
• New-onset cyanosis—severe
sign of severe exacerbation
exacerbation
• i fatigue
• Acute confusion—severe
• i fluid retention—new-onset
exacerbation
oedema is a sign of severe
exacerbation
0 Fever and chest pain are uncommon presenting features—consider
alternative diagnosis.
Causes of exacerbations 30% have no identifiable cause
• Infections Viral upper and lower respiratory tract infections, e.g.
common cold, influenza; bacterial lower respiratory tract infections
• Pollutants, e.g. nitrous oxide, sulphur dioxide, ozone

Differential diagnosis
•
•
•
•

Pneumonia
LVF/pulmonary oedema
Lung cancer
Pleural effusion

•
•
•
•

Recurrent aspiration
Pneumothorax
PE
Upper airway obstruction

Investigations

• Pulse oximetry Can be used to assess severity (saturation ≤92%
breathing air suggests hypoxaemia—consider admission) and to
monitor progress
• CXR Consider if diagnostic doubt and/or to exclude other causes
of symptoms
• Sputum culture Not recommended routinely in the communityG
Management Decide whether to treat at home or admit to hospital—
see Table 11.11.

Home treatment of acute exacerbations
• Add or i bronchodilators Consider if inhaler device and technique
are appropriate
• Start antibiotics Use broad-spectrum antibiotic, e.g. clarithromycin
500mg bd or doxycycline 100mg od/bd if sputum becomes more
purulent or clinical signs of pneumonia or consolidation on CXR
• Oral corticosteroids Start early in the course of the exacerbation
if i breathlessness which interferes with daily activities. Dosage:
30–40mg/d of prednisolone for 1–2wk. Consider osteoporosis
prophylaxis with a bisphosphonate if frequent courses are required
(b p. 509)

Acute exacerbations of COPD

Follow-up
• Reassess as necessary. If the patient deteriorates, reconsider the need
for hospital admission. If not fully improved within 2wk consider CXR
and/or hospital referral
• Reassess patients who have been admitted 4–6wk after discharge
Assess their ability to cope at home. 71 in 3 are readmitted in <3mo
• Reassess inhaler technique and understanding of treatment regime
• In severe cases, reassess the need for LTOT and/or home nebulizer
• Check FEV1
• Emphasize the potential benefit of lifestyle modification—smoking
cessation, exercise, weight loss if obese
• Arrange ongoing regular follow-up

Lung cancer
Referral for suspected lung cancer
Immediate referral/acute admission
• Stridor
• Superior vena cava obstruction (swelling of face/neck with fixed i JVP)
Urgent referral
To a team specializing in management of lung cancer:
• History of asbestos exposure
• Persistent haemoptysis (in
and recent onset of chest
smokers/ex-smokers aged �40y)
pain, shortness of breath, or
• CXR suggestive of lung cancer
unexplained systemic symptoms
(including pleural effusion and
where a CXR indicates pleural
slowly resolving consolidation)
effusion, pleural mass, or any
• Normal CXR where there is
suspicious lung pathology
high suspicion of lung cancer
Urgent referral for CXR
• Haemoptysis
• Any of the following if unexplained or present for >3wk*:
• Cough
• Hoarseness (refer urgently to ENT if CXR
• Chest/shoulder pain
is normal)
• Dyspnoea
• Finger clubbing
• Weight loss
• Cervical or supraclavicular
• Chest signs
lymphadenopathy
• Features suggestive of metastases from a lung cancer, e.g.
secondaries in the brain, bone, liver, or skin
* Do not delay for 3wk if high risk of lung cancer, i.e. smoker/ex-smoker,
COPD, history of asbestos exposure, previous history of cancer (especially
head/neck cancer).
Lung cancer is the most common cancer and third most common cause of
death in the UK. Incidence i with age—85% are aged >65y and 1% <40y at
presentation. 4: 5 8 2:1 but incidence is increasing in women.

Types
• Small cell lung cancer Accounts for 725% all cases. Often
disseminated at diagnosis. Spreads to liver, bones, brain, and adrenals
• Non-small cell lung cancer Mainly adenocarcinoma or squamous cell
carcinoma. Not always smoking-related
Screening A 2003 Cochrane review concluded that current evidence
does not support screening for lung cancer with chest radiography or sputum cytology. Frequent chest X-ray screening might be harmful. Results
of trials of screening with CT scanning are awaited from the US but preliminary results do not suggest this will be an effective screening strategy.

Prevention

• Smoking cessation 90% of lung cancer patients are smokers or
ex-smokers. The younger a person is when he/she starts smoking the
greater the risk of developing lung cancer. Risk also i with amount
smoked (duration of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked/d)

Lung cancer

• Diet i consumption of fruit, carrots, and green vegetables may
d incidence, but there is no evidence that vitamin supplements are
beneficial and they might be harmfulC
Presentation >90% have symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Common
presenting features:
• Weight d
• Cough (56%)
• Finger clubbing
• Chest/shoulder pain (37%)
• General malaise
• Haemoptysis (7%)
• Distant metastases
• Dyspnoea
• Incidental finding on CXR
• Hoarseness
Pancoast syndrome Apical lung cancer + ipsilateral Horner’s syndrome. Cause: invasion of the cervical sympathetic plexus. Other features:
shoulder and arm pain (brachial plexus invasion C8–T2) ± hoarse voice/
bovine cough (unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and vocal cord
paralysis). H.K. Pancoast (1875–1939)—US radiologist.
Paraneoplastic syndromes (e.g. ectopic ACTH production, SIADH,
hypercalcaemia, hypercoagulability) Affect 10–20% of patients with lung
cancer—particularly small cell. Have a high index of suspicion and refer
for specialist management if suspected.
Management Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, liaise with the
chest physician, specialist lung cancer team, primary healthcare team, and
specialist palliative care services (e.g. Macmillan nurses). Active treatment
options depend on type and extent of tumour and include surgery, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy. Follow-up regularly. 80% die in <1y.
Palliative radiotherapy Radiotherapy is a key component of symptomatic
treatment for:
• Haemoptysis
• Pain from bone metastasis
• Chest pain
• Symptoms from brain metastasis
• Breathlessness due to bronchial occlusion
Radiotherapy may be combined with palliative chemotherapy, particularly
for patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

Respiratory medicine

Colds and influenza
The common cold Acute, usually afebrile, respiratory tract infection.
• Causes Rhino (30–50%), picorna, echo, and Coxsackie viruses. At any
one time only a few viruses are prevalent
• Spread Contaminated secretions on fingers and droplet infection.
Most people are infected 2–3x/y
• Management Advise patients to take plenty of fluids and paracetamol
for symptom relief. Usually symptoms resolve in <1.5wk
• Complications Exacerbation of asthma/COPD; secondary infection
(bronchitis, pneumonia, conjunctivitis, OM, sinusitis, tonsillitis). Similar
symptoms are caused by the adeno and parainfluenza viruses
Acute bronchitis Inflammation of major bronchi. Often follows viral
URTI especially in winter months. Symptoms include cough ± sputum,
breathlessness, and wheeze. If signs are present they include wheeze and
scattered coarse crepitations.
Management Self-limiting illness (settles in <3wk) in normally healthy
people. Consider: bronchodilators if wheeze is heard; antibiotics—may
shorten symptoms but weigh benefits against possible side effects (i in
community antibiotic resistance and ‘medicalizing’ a self-limiting condition). If recurrent bronchitis, consider a diagnosis of COPD.
Reasons to prescribe antibiotics immediatelyN Investigate further and/or
give antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin 500mg tds) if:
• Systemically very unwell
• Symptoms/signs of serious illness or complications, e.g. pneumonia
• At high risk of serious complications because of pre-existing
co-morbidity, e.g. significant heart, lung, renal, liver, or neuromuscular
disease, immunosuppression, CF, or young children born prematurely
• Aged >65y with acute cough and ≥2 or more of the following, or aged
>80y with acute cough and ≥1 of the following:
• Hospitalization in the previous year
• History of CCF
• Type 1 or type 2 DM
• Current use of oral steroids

Influenza Sporadic respiratory illness during autumn and winter, causing 7600 deaths/y with epidemics every 2–3y leading to a 10x i in deaths,
and worldwide pandemics every 30–40y killing many more. Causes: influenza viruses A, B, or C. Spread: droplet infection, person-to-person contact, or contact with contaminated items. Incubation: 1–7d.
Presentation In mild cases symptoms are like those of a common cold.
In more severe cases fever begins suddenly accompanied by prostration and generalized aches/pains. Other symptoms may follow: headache, sore throat, respiratory tract symptoms (usually cough ± coryza).
Acute symptoms resolve in <5d but weakness, sweating, and fatigue may
persist longer. Secondary chest infection with Staphylococcus aureus or
Streptococcus pneumoniae is common. Rarely patients with influenza
A (Asian flu) develop severe viral pneumonia.
Management Rest, fluids, and paracetamol for fever/symptom control.
Treat complications, e.g. antibiotics for chest infection; treatment of exacerbations of COPD or asthma.

Colds and influenza

Antivirals: Zanamivir (10mg bd for 5d by inhalation) and oseltamivir
(75mg bd for 5d) are not a ‘cure’ for influenza but shorten symptoms
and d incidence of complications if started <72h after onset. Zanamivir is
for adults only; oseltamivir can be used for adults and children. Only use:
• For treatment of high-risk groups (see Box 11.1—except pregnancy) and
• When influenza is prevalent in the community— determined by
community-based virological surveillance schemes
• Zanamivir may cause bronchospasm—avoid in severe asthma, and
ensure a short-acting bronchodilator is available.
Prevention
• Influenza vaccine is prepared each year from viruses of the three strains
thought most likely to cause ‘flu’ that winter. It is 770% effective (range
30–90%). Protection lasts 1y. Give to high-risk groups—see Box 11.1
• Oseltamivir is recommended for prophylaxis in high-risk patients
>13y who are not effectively vaccinated or who live in residential
care where a staff member has influenza-like symptoms (only when
influenza is prevalent in the community). Use at a dose of 75mg od for
7–10d from diagnosis of the latest case in the establishmentN

Box 11.1 Risk factors for severe disease with influenza
• Aged �65y, or
• With �1 of the following conditions:
• Chronic respiratory disease, including COPD and asthma, or
weak respiratory muscles, e.g. MS, MND, CVA
• Significant cardiovascular disease, excluding hypertension
• Immunosuppression, (including hyposplenism)
• Chronic renal disease
• DM
Indications for influenza vaccination
• Cardiovascular disease (except
• ≥65y
i BP alone)
• Pregnant women
• Immunocompromised or
• DM
asplenic patients
• Chronic renal disease
• Carers of patients with
• Chronic lung disease, e.g.
disabilities
asthma, COPD
• Chronic liver disease
• Patients living in long-stay residential care establishments
• Health professionals expected to be in contact with influenza
0 In 2013, annual intranasal influenza vaccine was introduced for all
children aged 2–3y in the UK; plans to extend this programme to all
children aged 2–16y are under way.

Pneumonia in adults
Common condition with annual incidence of 78 cases/1,000 adult population. Incidence i with age and peaks in the winter. Mortality for those
managed in the community is <1% but 1 in 4 patients with pneumonia are
admitted to hospital and mortality for those admitted is 79%.

Presentation Acute illness is characterized by:

• Symptoms of an acute lower respiratory tract illness (cough + �1
other lower respiratory tract symptom, e.g. purulent sputum, pleurisy)
• New focal chest signs on examination (consolidation or d air entry,
coarse crackles, and/or pleural rub)
• �1 systemic feature:
• Sweating, fevers, shivers, aches and pains, and/or
• Temperature �38oC
• No other explanation for the illness
0The elderly may present atypically, e.g. ‘off legs’ or acute confusion.

Common causative organisms
• Pneumococcus (S. pneumoniae–36%)—b p. 654
• H. influenzae (10%)—more common amongst the elderly (b p. 656)
• Influenza A and B (8%)—annual epidemics during the winter
months—73% develop pneumonia (b p. 332)
• Mycoplasma pneumoniae (1.3%)—less common in the elderly;
epidemics occur every 4y in the UK (b p. 328)
• Gram –ve enteric bacteria (1.3%)
• C. psittaci (1.3%)—720% have history of bird contact (b p. 328)
• S. aureus (0.8%)—more common in the winter months; may be
associated with viral infection, e.g. flu (b p. 655)
• Legionella spp. (0.4%)—most common in September/October; >50%
related to travel
TB b p. 326    Immunocompromised patients b p. 650

Prevention

• Influenza vaccination: b p. 323
• Pneumococcal vaccination: b p. 654

Differential diagnosis Pneumonitis, e.g. secondary to radiotherapy,
chemical inhalation; pulmonary oedema (may coexist in the elderly); PE.

Investigations Often unnecessary in general practice. Consider:
• Pulse oximetry Use to assess severity. If oxygen saturation is ≤92% in
air, the patient is hypoxic and requires admission
• CXR If diagnostic uncertainty or symptoms not resolving. CXR
changes may lag behind clinical signs but should return to normal
<6wk after recovery. Persistent changes on CXR >6wk after recovery
require further investigation
• Sputum culture If not responding to treatment. If weight d, malaise,
night sweats or risk factors for TB (ethnic origin, history of TB exposure,
social deprivation, or elderly), request mycobacterium culture
• Blood FBC—i WCC; i ESR; acute and convalescent titres to confirm
‘atypical’ pneumonia (Legionella, C. psittaci, M. pneumoniae)

adults: update 2009. Thorax 2009; 64 (Supppl III): 1–55, with permission from the British
Thoracic Society.

Management
• Consider the need for admission See Figure 11.5. Have a low
threshold for admission if ill but apyrexial, concomitant illness (e.g.
heart failure, chronic lung, renal or liver disease, DM, cancer), or poor
social situation. If life-threatening infection or considerable delay (>2h)
consider administering antibiotics before admission
• If a decision is made to treat at home
• Advise not to smoke, to rest, and drink plenty of fluids
• Start antibiotics, e.g. amoxicillin 500mg–1g tds, doxycycline
100–200mg od, or clarithromycin 500mg bd
• Treat pleuritic pain with simple analgesia, e.g. paracetamol 1g qds
• Review within 48h. Reassess clinical state. If deteriorating or not
improving consider CXR or admission

Complications Require specialist management—refer.

TuberculosisND
Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Worldwide 1.5 billion people have
tuberculosis (TB). In the UK 9,000 cases of TB are reported each year and
7350 patients die. Incidence is increasing.
Risk factors In the UK:
• 40% cases of TB occur in London; TB is an urban disease
• 70% cases occur in ethnic minority populations—60% in those born
abroad (half are diagnosed <5y after entering the country)
• Contacts—if living in the same house, risk is 1 in 3; if school/work
contact, risk is 1 in 50; casual social contact risk is 1 in 100,000
• Immunosuppression—especially patients with HIV
• Homelessness
Primary TB Initial infection. Transmitted by droplet infection. A lesion
forms (usually pulmonary) which drains to local LNs. Immunity develops and the infection becomes quiescent. There may be no symptoms.
Possible symptoms include:
• Fever
• Anorexia
• Haemoptysis
• Night sweats
• Weight d
• Pneumonia
• Persistent cough ± sputum • Pleural effusion • Erythema nodosum
Investigations and management
• CXR
• Sputum samples for culture (state on the form that you are looking for
acid-fast bacilli)
• Tuberculin test +ve (may be –ve if immunocompromised)
• If diagnosis is confirmed, refer for treatment and contact tracing.
Post-primary TB Reactivation of a primary infection. Initial lesions
(usually in the upper lobes of the lung) progress and fibrose. Other sites
may develop disease. Multiple small lesions throughout the body result in
miliary TB which is common in immunocompromised patients. Symptoms
and signs relate to the organs infected. In all cases refer for specialist treatment. Extrapulmonary disease sites:
• Spine (rarely other bones/joints) • Pericardium
• CNS
• Miliary
• Lymph nodes • Peripheral cold abscess
Screening TB is a notifiable disease. After notification, contact tracing
is initiated—usually through chest clinics. All contacts are screened for TB
with a tuberculin test (see Table 11.12).
Tuberculin skin test Useful in diagnosis of TB and must be carried
out before BCG immunization, except for infants <3mo old who have
not had any recent contact with TB. Interpretation—see Table 11.13. The
tuberculin test can be suppressed by:
• Hodgkin’s disease
• Viral infections
• Sarcoidosis
• Glandular fever
• Corticosteroid therapy
• Live viral vaccines—do not do a tuberculin test <3wk after vaccination
• Immunosuppressant treatment or diseases, including HIV.
• If a patient has a +ve tuberculin test—DO NOT give BCG vaccination.

TreatmentN 0 Always refer to the chest clinic; 10% of infections are
antibiotic-resistant.
Asymptomatic patients If +ve tuberculin skin test (Mantoux >10mm) but
normal CXR, treatment is with isoniazid for 6mo or isoniazid + rifampicin
for 3mo to prevent development of the clinical disease.
Treatment of symptomatic patients Combination of 3–4 antibiotics for
the first 2mo, then two antibiotics for a further 4mo. Antibiotics used are
rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. All have potentially
serious side effects and require blood monitoring. Compliance is imperative to prevent antibiotic resistance. Those found to be non-compliant are
treated with directly observed therapy (DOT)—drugs are dispensed by
and taken in the presence of a health professional.
Prevention Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) is a live attenuated strain
of bacteria derived from M. bovis. BCG vaccination provides immunity lasting �15y to 70–80% of recipients. It is given by intradermal injection into
the left upper arm. Target groups:
• All infants living in areas where incidence of TB is �40/100,000 and
infants whose parents or grandparents were born in a country with TB
incidence of �40/100,000
• Previously unvaccinated new immigrants from countries where there is
a high prevalence of TB
• Those at risk due to their occupation, e.g. healthcare workers,
veterinary staff, prison staff
• Contacts of known cases or those living or working in high prevalence
countries for extended periods (generally �1mo)
• Do not give other immunizations into the same arm for 3mo.

Other respiratory infections
Mycoplasma Mycoplasma pneumoniae causes epidemics of lower respiratory tract infection every 3–4y. Spread by droplet infection.
• Incubation 12–14d
• Presentation Dry, persistent cough ± arthralgia. CXR shows bilateral,
patchy consolidation. Infection is confirmed with serology
• Management Clarithromycin 500mg bd for 2wk or doxycycline
100–200mg daily for 2wk. Relapse is common. Severe infections may
require hospital admission
Respiratory chlamydial infection
• C. pneumoniae Responsible for 6–19% of community-acquired
pneumonia—especially in children and young adults. May be clinically
indistinguishable from pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma. Treat
with doxycycline 100–200mg/d or clarithromycin 500mg bd for 2wk
(azithromycin 500mg od for 3d is an alternative)
• C. psittaci Infects many animals, but human infection is closely related
to contact with birds. Treat as for C. pneumoniae
Pertussis (whooping cough)ND Caused by Bordetella pertussis
• Incubation 7d
• Symptoms
• Catarrhal stage—symptoms and signs of URTI; lasts 1–2wk
• Coughing stage—increasingly severe and paroxysmal cough
with spasms of coughing followed by a ‘whoop’; associated with
vomiting, cyanosis during coughing spasms, and exhaustion; lasts
4–6wk, then cough improves over 2–3wk
• Examination Chest is clear between coughing bouts
• Investigation Microscopy and culture of pernasal swabs (special swab
and culture medium available from the lab); FBC—lymphocytosis
• Management Erythromycin in the catarrhal stage. Once coughing stage
has started, treatment is symptomatic
• Complications Pneumonia, bronchiectasis, convulsions,
subconjunctival haemorrhages, and facial petechiae
Prevention
• Proven contacts Treat with erythromycin
• Vaccination Routinely given in childhood (b p. 645). Children with
a personal or family history of febrile convulsion, FH of epilepsy,
and children with well-controlled epilepsy can be vaccinated—give
advice on fever prevention. Defer vaccination for children with any
undiagnosed or evolving neurological condition or poorly controlled
epilepsy until the condition is stable—if in doubt refer to paediatrics.
A temporary pertussis vaccination programme was launched in 2012 in
the UK for pregnant women (28–38wk) to protect newborn babies.
0 Pertussis immunity wanes 4–20y after vaccination—do not rule out the
possibility of pertussis because a person has been vaccinated

Aspergillosis A spectrum of diseases. Cause: Aspergillus fungus present in
the soil and decaying vegetation. Its spores can be inhaled any time of the year
but reach peak levels in autumn and winter. Inhaled fungal spores colonize
bronchial mucosa and nasal sinuses.

Other respiratory infections

Presentations
• Extrinsic asthma b p. 308
• Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis Grows in the walls of
the bronchi. Presents with episodes of eosinophilic pneumonia
(characterized by wheeze, cough, fever, and malaise) throughout the
year but worse in late autumn. CXR shows fleeting lung shadows
(cleared by expectorating firm, brown plugs of mucus). Untreated l
upper lobe fibrosis and ‘proximal’ bronchiectasis
• Invasive aspergillosis Only occurs in the immunocompromised.
Aspergillus disseminates from the lung l brain, kidneys, and other
organs. Carries very poor prognosis
• Aspergillus sinusitis Nasal congestion, headache, and facial pain
• Aspergilloma Growth within existing lung cavities (e.g. from previous
TB or sarcoidosis). A ball of fungus forms. CXR shows a round lesion
with air halo above it. Occasionally results in haemoptysis
Management If suspected, refer for specialist management.

Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as PCP) May be classified as a

protozoan or fungus. Causes pneumonia in immunocompromised patients.
• Presentation Fever, breathlessness, tachypnoea, dry cough, respiratory
failure (± cyanosis)
• Investigation CXR normal or ‘ground glass’ appearance; sputum
culture may be diagnostic
• Management If suspected refer for specialist care. Treatment is with
co-trimoxazole or dapsone
• Prevention Prophylactic antibiotics (usually co-trimoxazole) are given
to AIDS patients with CD4 counts <200 cells/mm3

SARS (sudden acute respiratory syndrome) SARS was first
reported in China in 2002. Since then there have been several further
clusters in far east Asia and one in Canada. SARS is caused by a corona
virus (SARS-CoV) and spread by direct contact with an infected individual
or rarely aerosol transmission. Incubation is 2–10d.
Two stages
• Prodrome—fever (>38°C), malaise, headache, myalgia
• Respiratory phase—develops after 3–7d—dry cough and
breathlessness. A high proportion progress to respiratory failure. 70%
also develop diffuse watery diarrhoea
0 Cases in the UK are most likely to occur within 10d of return from an
affected area—especially one where transmission is thought to be continuing. Admit to a specialist infectious diseases unit. Symptomatic suspected
cases should wear a surgical mask during transit.

Cystic fibrosis and Kartagener syndrome
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common inherited disorder in the

UK (prevalence: 1 in 2500). Median survival has i dramatically and is now
>40y but, of the 7500 CF patients in the UK, 6000 are <25y old.
Genetics Results from mutation of a single gene on chromosome 7 (cystic
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) essential for salt and
water movement across cell membranes l thickened secretions. >1200
different mutations have been described. Autosomal recessive inheritance—1 in 4 chance of having a child with CF if both parents are carriers. 71 in 25 adults in the UK carries the CF gene. Most common in
Caucasians—rare in people of Afro-Caribbean origin.
Screening Several possibilities:
• Preconceptual screening Buccal smears to karyotype prospective
parents
• Antenatal screening Chorionic villous sampling at 710wk—for parents
with an affected child already or where both parents are +ve on
karyotyping
• Neonatal screening— b p. 850
Common problems associated with CF Figure 11.6.
Diagnosis
• Screening
• If clinical suspicion of CF, refer to paediatrics. A +ve sweat test (Na+
> 70mmol/L; Cl– >60mmol/L on 2 occasions) is diagnostic as is i
potential difference across the nasal respiratory epithelium

Management CF is a multisystem disease requiring a holistic approach
to care which aims to maintain patients’ independence, improve quality of
life and extend life expectancy. A multidisciplinary team in a specialist CF
centre is best placed to achieve this. Patients usually have direct access.
Management involves:
• Treatment of lung disease e.g. with exercise, physiotherapy, antibiotics,
and mucolytics
• Maintaining good nutritional state e.g pre-meal oral pancreatic
enzymes, high calorie diet and fat soluble vitamin supplements
(A, D, & E)
• Treatment of complications e.g. DM, osteoporosis

Respiratory medicine

Interstitial lung disease
Also known as diffuse parenchymal lung disease. Comprises >200 different
diseases (many rare) in which inflammation affects the alveolar wall, leading to fluid in the alveolar air spaces.
Presentation Increasing dyspnoea ± cough. More rarely wheeze, pleurisy, and/or haemoptysis. May present incidentally with changes on CXR.

Further assessment
• History of the condition—acute, episodic, chronic?
• Severity—exercise tolerance
• Possible causes:
• Smoking
• Hobbies and occupation
• Usual environment (e.g. lives on a farm) and travel
• Past medical history (particularly rheumatological symptoms and
immunosuppression, e.g HIV) and family history
• Drugs
• Examine looking for fine inspiratory crackles in the chest and evidence
of systemic disease, e.g fever, rashes or other skin changes, eye signs
(particularly red eye), hepatomegaly and/or splenomegaly, arthritis
• Pulse oximetry—decreased saturations
Investigations
• CXR Diffuse shadowing
• Urine dipstick For protein and blood
• Blood FBC, ESR, liver and kidney function tests, thyroid function tests,
autoimmune profile
• Lung function tests Usually show restrictive picture—rarely no
abnormalities or obstructive picture
Classification See Table 11.13.
Hypersensitivity pneumonitis Also known as extrinsic allergic alveolitis, farmer’s lung, and bird fancier’s lung. Inhaled particles (e.g. fungal
spores, avian proteins) cause an allergic reaction in lungs of hypersensitive
individuals. May present as an acute or chronic reaction, or both may
occur together.
• Acute reaction 2–4h post-exposure. Fever, malaise, dry cough,
shortness of breath
• Chronic reaction Malaise, weight d, exertional dyspnoea, fine
crepitations in both lung fields
Investigations
• Blood FBC: i neutrophils (acute reaction); i ESR (acute reaction)
• CXR May be normal or show typical changes (shadowing, widespread
small nodules, or ground glass appearance)
• Diagnosis is based on history and high-resolution CT scan findings.
Serum precipitins to the provoking factor are found in ≥90%
Management If possible prevent further exposure to the allergen. In all
cases, refer for specialist advice. Treatment is usually with corticosteroids.
If occupational exposure, may qualify as industrial disease and be eligible
for compensation—b p. 116.

• Advise all patients with interstitial lung disease to stop smoking. This results
in better prognosis for their interstitial lung disease. Furthermore, patients with
chronic interstitial lung disease are at substantially increased risk of lung cancer.

Respiratory medicine

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) Incidence i with age. Most
patients are >50y. Progressive condition of unknown cause with insidious
onset. Can only be diagnosed if other causes of interstitial lung disease
have been excluded and symptoms present >3mo.
Presentation
• Progressive exertional dyspnoea
• Dry cough
• Clubbing (>50%)
• Fine ‘Velcro-like’ crepitations

• Malaise
• Weight d
• Central cyanosis and right heart
failure (advanced cases)

Investigations
• CXR Diffuse shadowing (although may be normal)
• Lung function tests Restrictive picture
Differential diagnosis
• Inhalant exposure (O2, NO2)
• LVF
• COPD
• Radiation
• Drugs
• Other causes of lung fibrosis—dust exposure (coal, asbestos, silica,
farmer’s lung, bird fancier’s lung)
Management Refer to a respiratory physician for diagnosis and advice on
management. Treatment, where appropriate, is with oral steroids + azathioprine. Pulmonary rehabilitation may be helpful. Lung transplant is a last
option. Most patients have poor prognosis, with median survival 3y (5y survival 10–15%), but the subgroup with fibrotic, non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP) has substantially better prognosis with >50% surviving 5y.
0 Patients with IPF have a 10x i risk of lung cancer. This risk is multiplicative with that from smoking. Patients with IPF who smoke 20 cigarettes a
day may have a 200x i risk of lung cancer compared with non-smokers
without IPF.

Sarcoidosis Multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown cause characterized by non-caseating granuloma. Incidence in the UK is 3/100,000/y.
Typically presents with lung granuloma in a young adult. 5 > 4.
Non-respiratory manifestations of sarcoidosis
• Heart failure
• Fever and malaise
• Pericardial effusion
• Erythema nodosum
• Cranial and/or peripheral nerve
• Lupus pernio (blue red nodules
palsies
on the nose, face, and/or hands)
• Seizures
• Scar infiltration
• Hypercalcaemia
• Enlarged lacrimal glands
• Renal stones
• Hypopyon
• Lymphadenopathy
• Uveitis
• Hepatosplenomegaly
• Arthralgia
• Arrhythmias
Acute sarcoidosis (Löfgren syndrome)
• Polyarthralgia
• Erythema nodosum
• Swinging fever
• Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on CXR

Interstitial lung disease

Insidious onset CXR shows hilar lymphadenopathy—incidental finding in
30–50%. If symptomatic, usually presents with tiredness, malaise, weight d
and/or arthralgia. 15% have lung symptoms with gradual onset of progressive exertional dyspnoea and dry cough.
Management Refer any patient with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy for
further investigation. For patients with confirmed sarcoidosis, specialist
management is needed. Steroids are the first-line treatment but should
only be used if:
• Progressive disease (on imaging or lung function testing)
• Significant symptoms, or
• Extrapulmonary disease requiring treatment
Rarely, if steroids are not controlling disease progression or symptoms,
methotrexate will be added. Inhaled steroids may be helpful to control
cough but do not influence disease progression. For patients with severe
symptoms, pulmonary rehabilitation may be helpful. Lung transplant may
be considered for patients with end-stage pulmonary sarcoidosis.
Prognosis Remits without treatment in 2:3 cases. Acute sarcoidosis has good
prognosis with most resolving in <2y. 730% have chronic progressive disease.
Mortality is <3%—usually death is due to CCF and/or cor pulmonale.

Respiratory medicine

Occupational lung disease
Exposure to gases, vapours, and dusts at work can lead to lung disease.

Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis 90% of all compensated industrial
lung disease in the UK. ‘Pneumoconiosis’ means accumulation of dust in
the lungs and tissue reaction to its presence. Incidence is related to total
dust exposure. Divides into:
• Simple pneumoconiosis Deposition of coal dust in the lung. Graded
on CXR appearance. Grading determines whether disability benefit is
payable in the UK. Effect on lung function is debated. Predisposes to
progressive massive fibrosis
• Progressive massive fibrosis Round fibrotic masses several cm in
diameter form in the upper lobes. Presents with exertional dyspnoea,
cough, black sputum, and, eventually, respiratory failure. Symptoms
progress (or even start) after exposure to coal dust has ceased. Lung
function tests show a mixed restrictive and obstructive picture with
loss of lung volume, irreversible airflow limitation, and d gas transfer
Asbestosis Before legislation banning its use, exposure was widespread
and occurred particularly in naval shipyards and power stations. Effects
of asbestos exposure—see Table 11.14. Also consider diagnosis in relatives who came into contact with asbestos, for example whilst washing
clothes—they can claim compensation if affected.
Silicosis Uncommon. Affects stonemasons, pottery workers, workers
exposed to sandblasting, and fettlers (remove sand from metal casts).
Caused by inhalation of silica. CXR appearance is distinctive. Presents with
exertional dyspnoea ± cough. Lung function tests: as for progressive massive fibrosis. Associated with i risk of lung cancer and TB.
Byssinosis Affects cotton mill workers. Symptoms (tightness in the chest,
cough, and breathlessness) start on the first day back at work after a break
(Monday sickness) with improvement as the week progresses. CXR is normal.
Berylliosis Rare. Long latent period. Affects workers in the aerospace,
nuclear power, and electrical industries, and their close relatives. Presents
similarly to sarcoidosis (b p. 334).
Iron (siderosis), barium (baritosis), and tin (stannosis) dust
inhalation Result in dramatic dense nodular shadowing on the CXR but

effects on lung function and symptoms are often minimal.

Occupational asthma >200 industrial materials cause occupational
asthma. Important causes are recognized occupational diseases in the
UK—patients may be eligible for statutory compensation if they apply
<10y after leaving the occupation in which asthma developed. Suspect if
a patient has symptoms which improve on days away from work/holiday.

Hypersensitivity pneumonitis (‘farmer’s lung’) b p. 332
Management In all cases, refer to a respiratory physician for confirmation
of diagnosis (essential if seeking compensation) and advice on management.

Respiratory medicine

Snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea
Snoring During sleep, the pharyngeal airway narrows due to d dilator
muscle tone. Snoring is vibratory noise generated from the pharynx and
soft palate as the air passes through this narrowed space. Further narrowing produces louder snoring, laboured inspiration and eventually apnoeic
episodes. Social consequences are the usual reason for the patient to
seek help. They can be distressing: banishment from the bedroom, marital
disharmony, no holidays, fear of travelling, or falling asleep in a public
place, etc.
0 Snoring may be used by the spouse as an excuse to leave the marital
bed and may actually be trivial/absent. If suspected, ask the patient to bring
a cassette recording of the offending noise.

Obstructive sleep apnoea Occurs when the pharyngeal airway com-

pletely closes during sleep resulting in apnoeic episodes. i inspiratory
effort is sensed by the brain and a transient arousal provoked. A few of
these arousals don’t matter—but many (sometimes hundreds) per night
l fragmented sleep and consequent daytime sleepiness.
Clinical features
• Dominant features Excessive daytime sleepiness (not tiredness—
Epworth Sleepiness Scale is a useful assessment tool), impaired
concentration, snoring (see Figure 11.7)
• Other features Unrefreshing sleep, choking episodes during sleep,
witnessed apnoeic episodes, restless sleep, irritability/personality
change, nocturia, d libido

Causes of snoring and sleep apnoea Overweight (neck circum-

ference >16"), nasal congestion, evening alcohol/sedatives, large tonsils,
receding lower jaw, smoking, hypothyroidism, menopause.

Management
Snoring without sleep apnoea
• Initial approaches Suggest changing sleeping position (discourage
from sleeping on back); elevate head of the bed (e.g. prop up on
bricks—can d nasal congestion); limit number of pillows to one thick/
two thin pillows to maximize pharyngeal size; d weight if obese;
d or stop evening alcohol/sleeping tablets; suggest partner tries ear
plugs (purchase from chemist—takes several nights to get used to
wearing them)
• If clinically indicated
• Nasal congestion—start beclometasone nasal spray (applied
head downwards) 2 puffs bd ± ipratropium bromide nasal spray
2 puffs nocte
• Check TFTs to exclude hypothyroidism
• Discuss the use of HRT in menopausal women
• If simple measures fail Refer to:
• Dentist or ENT for a mandibular advancement device
• ENT for surgery—septal straightening, polypectomy, turbinate
reduction, tonsillectomy, or uvulopalatopharyngoplasty

Snoring and obstructive sleep apnoea

Sleep apnoea
• Advise patients to: d weight if obese; d or stop evening alcohol/
sleeping tablets, and
• Refer to a sleep unit or physician with a special interest in sleep
problems. If diagnosis is proven and causing significant daytime
sleepiness, usual treatment is with CPAP therapy at night. Mandibular
advancement devices are alternatives for patients who cannot tolerate
CPAP or have very mild symptoms with no daytime sleepiness.
Occasionally, if large tonsils, referral to ENT for surgery is warranted

• Driving Warn patients NOT to drive if sleepy. Once diagnosis of sleep

apnoea is confirmed, they must inform the DVLA and their insurance company (b p. 130).

Sleep apnoea in children Common in children aged
2–7y in association with tonsil enlargement during URTI.
Sleep disruption can cause daytime sleepiness, hyperactivity, poor attention span, and bad behaviour. If tonsils are big
enough to produce sleep apnoea in the absence of current infection,
refer to ENT for consideration of tonsillectomy.
How likely are you to doze off or fall asleep in the following situations, in contrast
to feeling just tired?
This refers to your usual way of life in recent times. Even if you have not done
some of these things recently try to work out how they would have affected you.

permit



Sitting and talking to someone



Sitting quietly after a lunch without alcohol



In a car, while stopped for a few minutes in traffic
0=no chance of dozing
1=slight chance of dozing

Endocrinology

Symptoms of endocrine disease
Hormones secreted by the endocrine system perform a wide range of
functions. Therefore, clinical presentation of different endocrine disorders
varies widely from non-specific symptoms such as tiredness, to very specific signs such as delayed puberty. Specific features depend on the gland
and hormones involved.

Polydipsia Over-frequent drinking of fluid—often associated, for logical
reasons, with polyuria. Ask if associated with thirst. Take a history of fluid
intake. If no history of excess fluid intake and BM/fasting blood glucose/
HbA1c is normal, investigate further with U&E, Cr, and Ca2+.
Common causes
•	Change in lifestyle: diet/activity/exercise level—may be associated with
polyuria but no other symptoms. No history of thirst
• DM—usually accompanied by a history of thirst
Other causes Diarrhoea, diabetes insipidus, i Ca2+, compulsive water
drinking (may be a feature of psychotic illness), phosphorus poisoning.

Polyuria Passage of excessive urine. Check the patient does not mean

frequency of urination. It can be difficult to distinguish the two. Causes are
similar to those of polydipsia and the 2 symptoms are related. Take a history
of fluid intake. If no history of excess fluid intake and BM/fasting blood glucose/
HbA1c is normal, investigate further with MSU (for M,C&S), U&E, Cr, and Ca2+.
Consider
• DM—always check a BM and/or fasting blood glucose if a patient
complains of polyuria
• Diabetes insipidus
• Hypercalcaemia
•	Excessive intake—due to change in lifestyle or psychiatric conditions,
e.g. schizophrenia
•	Chronic renal failure
• Drugs—diuretics, caffeine, alcohol

Glycosuria Often detected incidentally on urine dipstick. Causes:
• DM
• Pregnancy

• Sepsis
• Renal tubular damage

• Low renal threshold

In all cases, check HbA1c/fasting blood glucose (+ glucose tolerance test
if pregnant). Check immediate BM if other symptoms suggestive of DM.

Hirsutism Affects 10% 5. Excess hair in androgenic distribution.
Causes:
• Most cases are idiopathic; there may be a family history
• Drugs—phenytoin; corticosteroids; ciclosporin; androgenic oral
contraception; anabolic steroids; minoxidil; diazoxide
• Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)
• Cushing’s syndrome
• Late-onset congenital adrenal
• Ovarian tumours (rare)
hyperplasia (rare)

Symptoms of endocrine disease

Assessment
• History Long-standing or recent onset, family history, ethnic origin
(more common in Mediterranean countries), menstrual history
• Examination Distribution of excess hair
Investigation Women with longstanding hirsutism (since puberty) and
regular periods need no further investigation unless abnormal signs.
Otherwise: blood—testosterone (i in PCOS, androgen-secreting tumour,
late-onset congenital adrenal hyperplasia); LH/FSH ratio (>3:1 suggests PCOS).
Refer to gynaecologist or endocrinologist if recent onset, abnormal blood
tests, virilism, galactorrhoea, menstrual disturbance, infertility, and/or
pelvic mass.
Treatment of idiopathic hirsutism
•	Cosmetic—bleaching, shaving, waxing, depilatory creams, electrolysis
• Weight d in obese individuals
• Psychological support
• Topical eflornithine d growth of unwanted facial hair. Continuous use
for >8wk is required before benefit is seen. Must be used indefinitely
to prevent regrowth. Discontinue if no improvement in 4mo
• Oral medication—all must be taken for ≥6mo to take effect and none
abolishes the problem. In all cases, continue treatment until acceptable
level of hair growth then stop. Relapse usually follows withdrawal and
repeat courses are then required. Drugs used: COC pill containing
desogestrel or co-cyprindiol; spironolactone

Menopause b p. 710
Delayed or precocious puberty b p. 893
Obesity b p. 178
Metabolic syndrome (syndrome X; insulin resistance
syndrome) Impaired glucose tolerance or DM, insulin resistance (in

patients on insulin, suggested by insulin doses >1u/kg/d) + other risk factors
for CVD including:
• Truncal obesity—waist circumference >0.9m (5); >1.0m (4), use 0.1m
lower figures for people of south Asian extraction
• i BP—>135/80
• Dyslipidaemia—serum HDL <1.2mmol/L (5) or <1.0 (4); fasting
serum triglycerides >1.8mmol/L
Associated with high risk of CVD. Treat risk factors aggressively.

Endocrinology

Diabetes mellitus
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common syndrome caused by lack, or d effectiveness, of endogenous insulin. It affects 3% of the UK population and is characterized by i blood sugars + abnormalities of carbohydrate/lipid metabolism.

Classification of primary diabetes
Type 1 Occurs at any age but more common in those aged <30y.
Autoimmune disease—islet cell antibodies may initially be present.
Associated with other autoimmune disease and certain genotypes (HLA
DR3/4—although identical twin concordance ≈30%.). Patients are prone
to profound weight d and ketoacidosis. Insulin is needed from diagnosis.
Type 2 80–90% patients with DM. 4:58 3:2. Prevalence is rising. Lifetime
risk of developing type 2 DM is >10% and 750% remain undiagnosed. Risk
factors:
• Age >65
• Ethnic group—South Asians/Afro• Obesity
Caribbeans have 5–10x i risk
•	FH of DM (identical twin • PMH of gestational diabetes or a baby
concordance 8 100%)
>4kg at birth
• Impaired glucose tolerance
Progressive disease resulting from impaired insulin secretion and insulin
resistance. Life expectancy is d by 30–40% in the age range 40–70y—a d of
8–10y of life. Onset is often insidious; 50% have complications at diagnosis.
Latent autoimmune diabetes in adulthood (LADA) 6–10% of patients
with type 2 DM. Characterized by anti-glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD)
antibodies. Associated with higher risk of ketoacidosis and i risk of
progression to insulin dependence. Suspect if type 2 DM and:
• Absence of metabolic syndrome features
• Uncontrolled hyperglycaemia despite oral agents, and/or
• Other autoimmune diseases (e.g. thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia)
Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) 1–2% of patients with DM.
Present <25y and there is a family history. Genetic syndrome with autosomal
dominant inheritance. Gene mutations involved: HNF1-α (70%); HNF1-β;
HNF4-α; glucokinase. Gene testing is important to identify the type of
MODY, as treatment differs according to type.

Diabetes and pregnancy b p. 828
Other (secondary) causes of DM
• Drugs Steroids, thiazides
• Pancreatic disease Pancreatitis, surgery, pancreatic cancer,
haemochromatosis, cystic fibrosis
• Endocrine disease Cushing’s disease, acromegaly, thyrotoxicosis,
phaeochromocytoma
• Others Glycogen storage diseases, insulin receptor antibodies
• Blood glucose may be temporarily i during acute illness, after trauma
or surgery or during short courses of blood glucose-raising drugs (see s
causes). If HbA1c >48mmol/mol DM is likely.

Diabetes mellitus

Presentation
• Acute Ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma (b p. 1100)
• Subacute Weight d, polydipsia, polyuria, lethargy, irritability, infections
(candidiasis, skin infection, recurrent infections slow to clear), genital
itching, blurred vision, tingling in hands/feet
• With complications Skin changes, neuropathy, nephropathy, arterial
or eye disease (b pp. 354–61)
• Asymptomatic Incidental finding or through risk stratification

Risk stratificationN Use a risk stratification tool (e.g. Diabetes Risk
Score or QDiabetes) to assess all patients:
• >40y, or
• >25y of South Asian, Chinese, Afro-Caribbean, or black African origin,
from hard-to-reach populations (e.g. homeless) or with other medical
conditions that predispose to DM (e.g. pancreatitis)
If low/intermediate risk, give lifestyle advice and reassess in 5y. If high risk or of
South Asian/Chinese ethnic origin and BMI >23kg/m2, check FBG or HbA1c:
•	FBG <5.5mmol/L or HbA1c <42mmol/mol—provide lifestyle advice
and reassess every 3y
•	FBG 5.5–6.9mmol/L or HbA1c 42–47mmol/mol—provide interventions
to d risk (e.g. weight management, dietary advice, help with smoking
cessation, BP and lipid management) and reassess annually
•	FBG ≥7.0mmol/L or HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol—consider type 2 DM

Diagnosis of diabetes
If symptomatic i plasma glucose (random ≥11.1mmol/L; fasting
≥7.0mmol/L) or i HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol. For all children and adults
with suspected ketoacidosis or who are unwell, do not delay to get a
laboratory sample, but admit or refer for same-day specialist assessment
on BM alone. Otherwise only diagnose with laboratory samples.
If asymptomatic
• i plasma glucose (random ≥11.1mmol/L; fasting ≥7.0mmol/L) or
i HbA1c ≥48mmol/mol on two separate measurements on different days
• i plasma glucose (random ≥11.1mmol/L; fasting ≥7.0mmol/L) and
i HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol at the same testing
Pre-diabetes (non-diabetic hyperglycaemia) FBG ≥6.1 and <7mmol/L
or HbA1c of 42–47mmol/mol. Risk factor for DM and CVD. Follow-up
with annual FBG or HbA1c. 4%/y develop DM. Treat CVD risk factors
aggressively.

Organization and monitoring of care
Aims of diabetic care
• Alleviation of symptoms
• Minimization of complications
• d in early mortality

• Quality of life enhancement
•	Education of the patient and
family/carers

Features of well-organized care

• Use of a register and structured records (available as part of in-house
computer software)
• 6-monthly review, with recall system and follow-up of defaulters
• Protocol for patient-centred care, including provision of personal care
plans tailored to each individual and including self-management plans
• Provision of protected time for the clinic
• Availability of good quality written information for patients
• Open access for patients to receive advice
• Multidisciplinary team covering all aspects of diabetes care—GPs,
diabetes nurse specialists/assistants, educators, dieticians, and podiatrists
• Quality monitoring through audit and patient feedback
•	Continuing education for professional staff

Routine diabetic review Each diabetic patient requires 6-monthly
review (or more frequent, as necessary). This should include a thorough
annual review of all aspects of disease and care. Reviews should cover:
• Problems Recent life events; new symptoms; difficulties with
management since last visit
• Review of:
• Indices of control, e.g. HbA1c
• Self-monitored results and discussion of their meaning
• Lifestyle—dietary behaviours; physical activity; smoking
• Diabetes education—including referral to a structured education
programme for those newly diagnosed and information on lifestyle,
self-care, support, and when to step up treatment/seek further
medical help
• Skills, e.g. injection technique
• Foot care
• Blood glucose, lipid and BP therapy, and results
• Other medical conditions and therapy affecting DM
• Immunizations—influenza ± pneumococcal vaccination
• Depression screening (b p. 199)
• Review of complications Annual review—more frequent if established
complications. Cardiovascular disease; nephropathy; neuropathy; eye
disease; foot problems; erectile dysfunction
• Review of services Annual review—more frequent if problems
• Analysis and planning Agreement on the main points covered, targets
for coming months, changes in therapy, interval to next review
• Recording Completion of structured record ± patient-held record
0 7–10% of patients in long-term residential care have DM. Patients in
residential care with DM tend to be neglected. Agree a diabetes care plan
for each affected resident, and ensure at least annual diabetic review.

Organization and monitoring of care

Monitoring blood glucose All patients can achieve good levels of

control (see Table 12.1). Poorer control is acceptable in the elderly or
others with limited life expectancy as long as they are symptom-free.
• Fingerprick capillary glucose monitoring Essential for all patients
using insulin. Useful for patients taking sulfonylureas/glinides
• Explain the range of suitable monitoring devices available (BNF
6.1.6), and train in the use of the selected method
• Frequency of self-monitoring varies according to need
• Set targets for preprandial glucose levels
• Assess skills (and meters) yearly or if problems self-monitoring
• Evaluate reliability of results by comparison with HbA1c results and
results obtained at review
• Glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) Measure at least 2x/y. Represents
average blood glucose control over the previous 6–8wk
0 Patients with type 2 DM who have a Group 2 driving licence and are
taking sulfonylureas or glinides must check blood glucose twice daily so
will need blood glucose meters and a supply of testing sticks.

Management of diabetes: education
Education is an essential aspect of diabetic care. Diabetes is a chronic condition, and however well it is managed in the clinic, the patient has to
manage his or her own disease the rest of the time. Everyone with DM
should receive education through a structured, quality-controlled education programme, e.g. diabetes education and self-management for ongoing
and newly diagnosed (DESMOND). Education enables patients and their
carers to become equal partners in the management of their disease. Topics
to cover during routine reviews:
General knowledge Information about:
• DM, its progressive nature, and complications
• Aims of management
• Structure of diabetic services and ways to access them
•	Equipment required and usage instructions—syringes, needles, blood
testing equipment, etc.
•	Free prescriptions for patients requiring drugs or insulin to control
their diabetes
• Problems of pregnancy (women of childbearing age only)
• Alert bracelets/tags—Medic-Alert (F 0800 581 420) or Medi-Tag
(F 0121 200 1616) provide engraved jewellery, watches, and tags

Diet Patients do not need a separate diet from the rest of the family or
expensive ‘diabetes’ food products. A diabetic diet is a healthy diet.
• Aim for ≥50% of calorie intake from fibre-rich carbohydrate, with
minimum fat (especially saturated), refined carbohydrate, and alcohol
• Adjust total calorie intake according to desired BMI
•	Recommend ≥5 portions of fresh fruit or vegetables/d
• Spread food intake evenly across the day for patients controlled with
tablets or diet
• Diet sheets are available from Diabetes UK and should be provided
•	Ready-made meals, processed foods, and alcohol are often sources of
hidden sugar
Immunizations Offer influenza and pneumococcal vaccine to all
patients with diabetes.
Psychological problems Discuss concerns about the diagnosis of DM
or development of complications. Arrange counselling/refer to self-help
resources as needed. Teenagers with diabetes can be a particularly
difficult group to manage. Often control is poor due to a combination of
rapid bodily changes and rebellion against the diagnosis of DM. Support
information and advice given in specialist clinics.
Exercise Encourage regular exercise.
•	Review activity at work and in getting to and from the workplace,
hobbies, and physical activity in the home
• Advise physical activity can i insulin sensitivity, d BP, and improve
blood lipid control
• If appropriate, suggest regular physical activity tailored to individual
ability (e.g. brisk walking for 30min/d; exercise prescription)
Smoking Advice on and assistance with smoking cessation (b p. 182).

Management of diabetes: education

Driving Advise all drivers that they must notify their car insurance
company and the DVLA, unless their diabetes is controlled by diet alone.
Be aware of insurers who cater for diabetic drivers.
• Type 1 DM—must be aware of hypoglycaemic episodes
• All type 1 DM and those with type 2 DM taking sulfonylurea or
glinide: group 1 licence—<2 hypoglycaemic episodes/y requiring
assistance of another person; group 2 licence—no hypoglycaemic
episodes requiring assistance of another person and must monitor
blood glucose 2x/d
Foot care b p. 360
Employment Advise those on insulin that certain jobs are no longer
possible:
• Working on scaffolding or with dangerous machinery
• Joining the police or the armed services
• Driving a heavy goods or public service vehicle

Jobs without these hazards should pose no problems though the patient
might wish to tell his/her employer. Special advice may be needed for
shift work.

Travel Give advice on:

•
•
•
•
•
•

Management of change in time zones (b p. 133)
Transport of insulin
Keeping monitoring and injection equipment in hand-luggage
Differences in insulin types and concentrations between countries
Travel related illness (especially gastroenteritis)
Need for immunization and travel insurance

Be aware of insurers who cater for diabetic travellers.

Treatment of type 2 diabetes
• Always combine treatment of hyperglycaemia with modification of
other risk factors for vascular complications—b p. 354.

Healthy eating and exercise Diet is the cornerstone of treatment.
Diet sheets are available from Diabetes UK. i physical activity is beneficial
(d weight, d lipids, and i insulin sensitivity) but not always possible.
First-line oral hypoglycaemic agentsN See Figure 12.1 and BNF 6.1.2.
Biguanides Metformin 500mg–1g bd. d gluconeogenesis and i peripheral
utilization of glucose. Only effective if some endogenous insulin production.
Initiate metformin for all patients if HbA1c remains ≥48mmol/mol after a
trial of diet/lifestyle interventions. Avoid in very elderly patients and those
with serious heart disease, liver/renal failure, or high alcohol intake, as i risk
of lactic acidosis. Hypoglycaemia is not a problem. Start with the minimum
dose and i monthly until control is achieved/maximum dose reached.
Sulfonylureas (e.g. gliclazide 80–160mg bd) Consider first-line if not
overweight, hyperglycaemic symptoms requiring rapid response, and/or
metformin is contraindicated/not tolerated. Augment insulin secretion,
so only effective if residual endogenous insulin production. All are equally
effective. If one sulfonylurea does not work—another is not likely to either.
Advise patients to take before meals—warn about hypoglycaemia if meals
are omitted (and need for blood monitoring if group 2 driving licence). Start
at the minimum dose, and i until blood sugar is controlled/maximum dose
is reached. Wait ≥1mo between adjustments. Main side effect is weight i.

Second-/third-line oral hypoglycaemic agentsN (BNF 6.1.2)
Pioglitazone 15mg od. i insulin secretion/sensitivity, slightly d BP, and
d total cholesterol. Does not cause hypoglycaemia. May cause weight i.
Use in combination with metformin and/or sulfonylurea for patients with
poor glycaemic control. 0 Associated with i risk of bladder cancer, fluid
retention, and heart failure.
DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g. sitagliptin 100mg od, saxagliptin 5mg od, vildagliptin
5mg od/bd, linagliptin 5mg od) i incretin levels. Do not cause weight i or
hypoglycaemia. Use with metformin and/or sulfonylurea if poor glycaemic
control. Linagliptin is useful for patients with renal failure as excreted via
the gall bladder.

Other treatmentsN
• Exenetide (bd/weekly injection), lixisenatide (od injection) and
liraglutide (od injection)—may be an alternative to insulin in obese
patients. Stimulate insulin production and d rate of glucose absorption
from the gut. Licensed for use in addition to metformin and/or a
sulfonylurea. Continue after 6mo only if HbA1c has d >1mmol/mol and
weight d is >3% of initial body weight
• Rapid-acting insulin secretagogues (nateglinide, repaglinide)—stimulate
insulin release. Rapid onset and short duration of activity. May be useful
as second-line treatment with metformin for those with erratic lifestyle

Treatment of type 2 diabetes

Starting insulin (b p. 352) If on dual therapy (metformin +

sulfonylurea) and markedly hyperglycaemic, start insulin in preference to
adding other drugs unless very good reasons not to. Continue metformin
and sulfonylurea except if planning pregnancy. Review the use of
sulfonylurea if hypoglycaemia occurs.

Endocrinology

Treatment with insulin
First-line treatment for type 1 DM and used when diet + oral therapy have
failed for type 2 DM. Local guidelines govern who does what.
• All drivers must notify the DVLA and their insurance company.

Types of insulin
• Rapid-acting analogues (e.g. insulin lispro—fastest acting; peak 0–3h
after injection; last 2–5h; give just prior to meals)
• Soluble (clear) human, porcine, or bovine (e.g. Actrapid®—short-acting;
peak 2–6h after injection; last 8h; give 15–30min before meals)
• Intermediate- or longer-acting (cloudy) human, porcine, or bovine (e.g.
Humulin I®)—peak 4–12h after injection; last up to 30h. Taken alone, od/
bd to provide background insulin, or with short/rapid-acting insulin
• Long-acting insulin analogues (e.g. insulin glargine)—last 24h; provide
background insulin; as no peak, associated with d risk of hypoglycaemia
• Pre-mixed—combination of short- + long-acting insulin, e.g. 30%:70%

Examples of injection regimes*
• Intermediate ± short-acting insulin od/bd (mane ± pre-evening meal)
• Short- + intermediate-acting insulin mane, short-rapid-acting* insulin
before evening meal, and intermediate-acting insulin before bed
• Short-rapid-acting* insulin tds pre-meals + intermediate-acting pre-bed
•	Combinations of oral therapy + od/bd long-intermediate-acting insulin
•	Rarely, continuous sc infusion of short-acting insulin is needed to
achieve control—needs specialist supervision
*
Use rapid-acting insulin as an alternative to mealtime soluble insulin where nocturnal or late
interprandial hypoglycaemia is a problem or to eliminate the need for snacks between meals.

Administration
• Deep sc injection into upper arm, thigh, buttock, or abdomen
• Fat hypertrophy/scarring are minimized by rotation of injection sites
• ‘Pen’ devices and syringe/needle are equally effective. In all cases prime
the needle using an ‘air shot’ (an empty needle d insulin dose by ~2u)
•	Rock ‘pens’ containing premixed insulins to mix contents before use
• i absorption can occur if a limb is exercised following injection

Monitoring

•	Check blood glucose pre-prandially ≥1x/d at different times—more
often if multiple injection regimes, after dose changes or during
intercurrent illness; ask patients to keep a timed/dated diary of readings
•	Record episodes of hypoglycaemia
• Target: blood glucose 4–7mmol/L pre-meals, with hypoglycaemic
episodes kept to a minimum (4–8mmol/L pre-meals if <18y old)

Starting insulin for patients with type 2 DM Use a structured
programme. Appropriate training is needed for all practice staff involved.
• Before starting—teach home blood glucose monitoring; reinforce diet
•	Continue metformin ± sulfonylurea
• Teach insulin injection technique—start 10u of long-acting insulin od
• Teach patients/carers about safe disposal of sharps and hypoglycaemia

Treatment with insulin

• Give instructions to i dose every 3–7d until target levels are reached
e.g. average fasting glucose >10mmol/L—i by 6–8u/d; 8–10mmol/L—i
by 4–6u/d; 6–8mmol/L—i by 2–4u/d
• Provide a contact telephone number for advice; follow up after 2–3d
and then as needed; check HbA1c every 3mo until stable
Exercise d insulin dose acting at the time of exercise or take 1–2 glucose
tablets before exercise, then check blood glucose afterwards. Adjust
alterations/glucose dose with experience of effects of exercise.

Intercurrent illness Continue insulin in usual dose and keep a regular

check (≥qds) of blood sugar. Maintain glucose intake even if not eating (e.g.
with Lucozade or milk).
• If glucose >13mmol/L, i insulin by 2u/d until control is achieved or use
top-up injections of short-acting insulin qds prn
• Admit to hospital if: condition warrants admission; unable to take
glucose; persistent vomiting and/or dehydration; ketotic (check urine if
blood sugar >13mmol/L)

Poor control

•	Exclude intercurrent illness
•	Consider diet and/or gastroparesis
•	Consider psychosocial factors
•	Check insulin is being used correctly
• Check injection sites are not scarred or hypertrophic
•	Consider changing insulin dose—ask the patient to record a glucose
profile (blood sugar pre-meals and before bed); if using >1 insulin,
adjust one at a time i or d as needed; alter by ≤10% each time; allow
≥48h between dose adjustments; alter dose of insulin acting at the
time blood sugar is most out of control

Hypoglycaemia
Emergency management b p. 1100
Advice for patients
• Check blood sugar before driving and every 2h during a long journey
• Carry glucose everywhere and sandwiches on long journeys
• If hypoglycaemia occurs, stop hazardous activities and take action
• Wait until fully recovered before resuming activities
In case of severe hypoglycaemia Supply a responsible member of the family
with glucose gel (e.g. GlucoGel®) and glucagon injection—teach him/
her to use it. Response is short-lived—give oral glucose (e.g. Lucozade,
glucose tablets, milk) as soon as the patient is conscious.
Recurrent hypoglycaemia
• If hypoglycaemia occurs in a regular pattern check pattern of meals
and activity and alter insulin to match needs
• If erratic consider erratic lifestyle, alcohol, problems with absorption,
errors in administration, gastroparesis
• If no obvious cause, consider change in underlying insulin sensitivity
(e.g. age, renal impairment)
Hypoglycaemia unawareness To restore warning signs adjust insulin/food
intake to stop glucose levels dropping to <4mmol/L. Consider undetected
night-time hypoglycaemia if HbA1c < expected from blood sugar diary.
Driving is not permitted if hypoglycaemic awareness has been lost or >1
hypoglycaemic episode requiring assistance from another individual in the
past year (no episodes permitted for group 2 licence).

Diabetic complications: cardiovascular
Diabetic patients are at i risk of MI (2–5x), stroke (2–3x), and peripheral
vascular disease. Protective effect of female sex is lost. Atherosclerotic
disease accounts for most of the excess mortality due to DM. Check
arter­ial risk factors annually:
• Lipid profile (LDL, HDL
• Age
cholesterol, and triglycerides)
•	Family history of arterial disease
• Albumin excretion rate
• Abdominal adiposity
• Blood glucose control
• BP
• Smoking—give smoking cessation advice at every opportunity. Help
patients who want to give up with advice, medication, and support

• High-risk groups
Type 1 Consider patients at increased risk if:
• >35y
• Originate in the Indian subcontinent
•	Family history of premature heart disease
• Pre-existing CVD
• ≥2 features of the metabolic syndrome (b p. 343)
• Abnormal lipids
• i BP
• Microalbuminuria/proteinuria
Type 2 Consider to be at high CVD risk unless all the following apply:
• Not overweight for ethnic group
• Normotensive (BP <140/80mmHg without antihypertensive therapy)
• No microalbuminuria
• Non-smoker
• No high-risk lipid profile
• No history of cardiovascular disease
• No family history of cardiovascular disease

Aspirin Control systolic BP to <145/90mmHg before starting treatment.
Give 75mg od to all those with a prior history of CVD. Do not use for
primary prevention.
Statin Give a statin (e.g. simvastatin or atorvastatin) to:
•
•
•
•

All type 1 diabetics with i risk of arterial disease
All type 2 diabetics aged >75y
Type 2 diabetics of any age with any high-risk factors
Type 2 diabetics >40y with no high risk factors, but who have 10y
CVD risk >20%, calculated using special diabetic risk tables, e.g.
UKPDS risk engine (M www.dtu.ox.ac.uk/riskengine)
Choice of statin depends on cost and other medication the patient is taking. Start with a mid-range dose (e.g. simvastatin 40mg or atorvastatin
20mg nocte). Recheck lipid profile 1–3mo after starting treatment. Aim
to d total cholesterol to <4mmol/L or d LDL cholesterol to <2.0mmol/L.
If treatment does not bring lipids within target levels, i the statin dose

Diabetic complications: cardiovascular

or change to an alternative statin (• simvastatin at a dose of 80mg is no
longer recommended; avoid 40mg dose in combination with amlodipine,
diltiazem, verapamil, or amiodarone).
Triglycerides
• If triglycerides are >4.5mmol/L despite optimal glycaemic control, start
a fibrate (e.g. fenofibrate) to d risk of pancreatitis. If this is ineffective,
consider a trial of high-concentration omega-3 fish oils
• If high CVD risk and triglycerides are 2.3–4.5mmol/L despite statin
treatment, consider adding a fibrate

Blood glucose Target HbA1c is <48mmol/mol if type 1 DM or type 2

DM treated with lifestyle measures or one/two oral agents. Otherwise
target HbA1c is <58mmol/mol.

BP Any d in average BP d risk of cardiovascular complications. Measure
BP annually if not hypertensive and no renal disease. If BP is higher than
target, consider 24h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (b p. 246).
• Type 1 DMN Treat if systolic BP >135 or diastolic BP >85mmHg, unless
microalbuminuria/proteinuria or ≥2 features of the metabolic syndrome
(b p. 343) when treat if systolic BP >130 or diastolic BP >80mmHg
• Type 2 DMN Treat if systolic BP ≥140 or diastolic BP ≥80mmHg,
regardless of absolute risk of CVD. Aim to d BP to <140/80mmHg (or
<130/80mmHg if kidney, eye, or cardiovascular disease)
Choice of antihypertensiveN
• In all cases, discuss lifestyle modifications (b p. 249)
• If already on antihypertensives at the time of diagnosis of DM, review
BP and medication use. Change only if BP is poorly controlled or
current medication is inappropriate
•	For those with new hypertension, start with an ACE inhibitor (unless
possibility of becoming pregnant when start with Ca2+ channel
blocker). Titrate dose to the maximum tolerated. If side effects with
ACE inhibitor, ARB is an alternative. For people of Afro-Caribbean
descent offer ACE inhibitor + Ca2+ channel blocker. Monitor BP every
1–2mo until stable within target
• If BP remains above target add a calcium channel blocker (e.g.
amlodipine 5mg od)
• If BP still remains above target, add a diuretic (e.g. indapamide M/R
1.5mg od)
•	Fourth-line agents include alpha-blockers, beta-blockers, or further
diuretic therapy, e.g. spironolactone 25mg od. Consider referral
Monitoring Monitor BP every 4–6mo once stable on treatment. Check
for possible adverse side effects of medication (including postural drop).

Diabetic complications: renal and eye
Renal disease
Urinary tract infections More common in patients with poorly controlled
DM. May exacerbate renal failure and lead to renal scarring. Consider
papillary necrosis if recurrent (more common in DM).
Nephropathy
• Most common cause of end-stage renal failure in adults starting dialysis
in the UK. 25% diabetics have renal damage—more common if of
Asian or African ethnic origin
• Nephropathy is characterized by proteinuria, i BP, and progressive d
in renal function
• Before overt nephropathy occurs, there is a phase (microalbuminuria
or incipient nephropathy) in which the urine contains traces of protein
not detected by standard protein dipstick. Presence of i urine albumin
levels and/or i serum creatinine is associated with i risk of premature
cardiovascular events and renal failure
•	Check renal function annually (first-pass urine specimen for
albumin:creatinine ratio; dipstick for protein and haematuria; serum
creatinine and eGFR)
Interpretation of albumin:creatinine ratio
• Microalbuminuria is defined as albumin:creatinine ratio ≥2.5mg/mmol
(4) or ≥3.5mg/mmol (5) or albumin concentration ≥20mg/L in the
absence of overt proteinuria or urinary tract infection
• If albumin:creatinine ratio is abnormal, repeat the test 2x over the next
3–4mo. Microalbuminuria is confirmed if ≥1 of the repeat results is
also abnormal
Suspect other renal disease if
• Albumin:creatinine ratio is i without retinopathy
• BP is particularly high or resistant to treatment
• Heavy proteinuria (albumin:creatinine ratio >100mg/mmol) but
previously documented as normal
• Significant haematuria
• GFR has worsened rapidly
• The person is systemically unwell
Management of nephropathy
• Optimize blood glucose control
• Monitor and treat i BP (target BP <130/80mmHg) and treat other
arterial risk factors aggressively
• Modify diet (d salt intake, d protein intake with target of 0.8g/kg)
• Treat all patients with DM and microalbuminuria or CKD with an ACE
inhibitor (or ARB), titrating the dose to the maximum tolerated. This
protects renal function and d proteinuria, even if the patient is not
hypertensive
•	Refer to a nephrologist if proteinuria (albumin:creatinine ratio >70mg/
mmol, or total protein:creatinine ratio >100mg/mmol, and UTI
excluded); eGFR <30 or eGFR drops by >15% between tests (see
CKD b p. 440)

Diabetic complications: renal and eye

Eye disease 71:3 diabetics have eye problems at the time of diagnosis.
Blurred vision May occur if blood glucose control is poor—caused by
osmotic changes in the lens, and corrects with normalization of blood
sugar. Wait before changing glasses.
Cataract Juvenile ‘snowflake’ cataracts are more common and can develop
rapidly (over days). Senile cataracts occur 710y earlier in DM.
Glaucoma DM is a risk factor for developing glaucoma.
Retinopathy Most common cause of blindness in people of working age
in industrialized countries (risk is i x20 compared to non-diabetics).
20–40% type 2 diabetics have retinopathy at diagnosis. 20y after diagnosis,
95% type 1 diabetics and 60% type 2 diabetics have retinopathy—
sight-threatening in 5–10%.
Pathogenesis of retinopathy Small retinal blood vessels become blocked,
swollen (aneurysms) or leaky causing exudate formation, oedema or new
vessels. Laser treatment (photo-coagulation) halts progression but does
not restore vision.
• Good diabetic control slows development of retinopathy. Aim for
HbA1c of <58 mmol/mol
• Monitor and treat risk factors—BP, lipids (hard exudates), smoking
•	Fenofibrate d risk of retinopathy and retinopathy progressionR. Place

Diabetic complications: nerve and skin
Neuropathy Enquire annually about painful and other symptomatic
neuropathy, impotence in men and manifestations of autonomic
neuropathy especially if renal complications or erratic blood glucose
control. Optimize blood sugar control.
Symmetrical sensory progressive polyneuropathy Affects 40–50% of patients
with DM. Starts distally feet>hands. Glove-and-stocking distribution. May be
asymptomatic or cause numbness, tingling, or neuropathic pain. Pain can be
depressing and disabling. Be supportive. If simple analgesia with paracetamol
or NSAID is ineffective try neuropathic painkillers (Figure 12.2). When pain
is controlled, review regularly and consider reducing dose/stopping.
Mononeuropathies/mononeuritis multiplex Especially cranial nerves III and
VI—b p. 536.
Amyotrophy Painful wasting of quadriceps muscles—reversible with
improved blood sugar control.
Autonomic neuropathy
• Postural d BP Common especially in the elderly. Increasing dietary
salt intake may help. Other treatments are all unlicensed. They include
fludrocortisone 100–400 micrograms od (uncomfortable oedema is
a common side effect) ± flurbiprofen or ephedrine hydrochloride
(30–60mg tds to relieve oedema), and midodrine (alpha agonist)
• Urinary retention b p. 454
• Diabetic diarrhoea Exclude other causes of change in bowel
habit—b p. 406. Diabetic diarrhoea can be treated with 2 or 3 doses
of tetracycline (250mg—unlicensed). Otherwise treat with codeine
phosphate 30mg tds/qds prn
• Erectile dysfunction b p. 776
• Gastric paresis Treat with an antiemetic which promotes gastric
transit e.g. domperidone 30mg tds. When this fails, erythromycin may
be used but evidence of effectiveness is lacking
• Gustatory sweating Can be treated with an antimuscarinic
such as propantheline bromide but side effects are common.
Hyperhidrosis—b p. 603

Depression Some physical illnesses, including DM, predispose patients
to depression. Screen for depression as part of the annual diabetic check
(b p. 199)

Skin changes associated with DM Numerous skin problems are
associated with DM. These include:
• Predisposition to infection e.g. candidiasis, staphylococcal infection
(folliculitis, boils)
• Pruritus
• Xanthomas
• Vitiligo (type 1 DM)
• Neuropathic and/or ischaemic ulcers—see the diabetic foot—b p. 360

Diabetic complications: nerve and skin

• Fat atrophy/hypertrophy at insulin injection sites
• Necrobiosis lipoidica—50% associated with DM. Small, dusky red
nodules with well-circumscribed borders; can be single or multiple.
Usually on the outside of the shin. Enlarge slowly becoming brownish
yellow, irregular, and flattened/depressed. Long-standing lesions may
ulcerate. No effective treatment
• Diabetic dermopathy—pigmented scars over shins
• Granuloma annulare —asymptomatic dermal nodules; association
with DM is controversial
• Diabetic cheiroarthropathy—waxy skin thickening over the dorsum of
the hand with restricted mobility

Refer to pain clinic or endocrinology
If pain is not controlled, try adding/replacing with
tramadol (50–100mg qds)
If amitriptyline is ineffective, consider
changing to/adding pregabalin (75–300mg bd)
If duloxetine is ineffective or not tolerated, switch to
amitriptyline (10–75mg) taken at 5–7 p.m.
Start with duloxetine (60–120mg/d)

Endocrinology

The diabetic foot
Foot problems are common amongst people with diabetes—5% develop a
foot ulcer in any year (see Table 12.2). Foot problems are due to:
• Peripheral neuropathy (affects 20–40% diabetic patients) l d foot
sensation, and
• Peripheral vascular disease (affects 20–40% diabetic patients) l pain
and predisposition to ulceration
Table 12.2 Clinical features of neuropathic and vascular foot ulcers
Neuropathic

Vascular

Warm foot
Bounding pulses, normal ABPI
Located at pressure points
Painless
Clearly defined or ‘punched out’
Surrounded by callus

Cool foot
Absent pulses, d ABPI
Located at extremities (e.g. between toes)
Painful
Less clearly delineated

Information about foot care
• Self-care and self-monitoring:
• Daily examination of the feet for problems—colour change;
swelling; breaks in the skin; numbness
• Footwear—importance of well-fitting shoes and hosiery
• Hygiene (daily washing and careful drying) and nail care
• Dangers associated with procedures, e.g. corn/verruca removal
• Methods to help self-monitoring, e.g. mirrors if d mobility
• When to seek advice from a health professional—if any colour change,
swelling, breaks in the skin, or numbness, or if self-monitoring is not
possible (e.g. due to mobility problems)
•	For patients at increased or high risk or with ulcers, additionally, advise
no barefoot walking and that, due to d sensation, extra care and
attention is needed
• If skin lesions, advise patients to seek help if any change in the lesion,
or if i swelling, pain, odour, colour change, or systemic symptoms

Risk factors
•	Foot deformities
• Neuropathy
• Poor footwear
• Peripheral vascular disease
• Long duration of DM
• Previous ulceration or
• Social deprivation and isolation
amputation
• Poor vision
• Age >70y
• Smoking
• Plantar callus
The foot check Check the feet as part of the annual review.
History
•	Foot problems since last review
• Visual or mobility problems affecting self-care of feet
• Self-care behaviours and knowledge of foot care
• History of numbness, tingling, or burning—may be worse at night

The diabetic foot

Examination
• Foot shape, deformity, joint rigidity, and shoes
•	Foot skin condition—fragility, cracking, oedema, callus, ulceration,
sweating, presence of hair
•	Foot and ankle pulses
• Sensitivity to 10g monofilament or vibration

Management
General points
• Optimize diabetic control and risk factors for vascular disease
(including smoking cessation)
•	Review drug therapy—stop β-blockers if peripheral vascular disease
•	Educate about foot care
Specific management Classification—Table 12.3
• Low risk Foot care education
• Increased risk Foot care education. Refer to the foot protection team.
Check feet every 3–6mo. Consider referral for vascular assessment.
Consider regular podiatry if poor vision, immobility, or poor social
conditions/foot hygiene. If previous foot ulcer, deformity, or skin
changes manage as high risk
• High risk Stress importance of foot care. Refer to the foot protection
team for specialist podiatry. Inspect feet every 3–6mo. Review need
for vascular assessment. Treat fungal infection
• Foot ulcer Refer to the multidisciplinary specialist foot care team
urgently. Assess ischaemia using Dopplers. Consider referral
for angiography. Treat infection. If new ulceration, cellulitis or
discoloration refer to a specialized podiatry/foot care team within 24h

Lumps in the thyroid gland and goitres
Faced with a lump in the pre-tracheal region of the neck, ask:
• Is it in the thyroid (moves up and down on swallowing)?
• Is it a solitary lump or more generalized (a goitre)?
• Is the patient thyrotoxic, euthyroid, or hypothyroid?
• Is the trachea being compressed (patient is breathless)?

Management of thyroid lumpsN
Refer immediately to a thyroid surgeon If symptoms of tracheal
compression, including stridor due to thyroid swelling.
Refer urgently to a thyroid surgeon If thyroid swelling + any of:
• Unexplained hoarseness/voice
• Patient aged ≥65y
changes
• Solitary nodule increasing in size
•	Cervical lymphadenopathy
• History of neck irradiation
• Very young (pre-pubertal) patient
•	FH of an endocrine tumour

Investigation of patients who do not require urgent referral Request
TFTs if thyroid swelling without stridor or any of the features listed
above. 0 Do not request USS or isotope scanning
• Refer non-urgently to endocrinology Patients with hyper- or
hypothyroidism and an associated goitre
• Refer non-urgently to a thyroid surgeon Patients with goitre and
normal thyroid function tests without any of the features listed above

Solitary thyroid nodules Investigate all solitary nodules. Check TFTs
and refer as above. Differential diagnosis:
• Benign (90%): cyst, adenoma, discrete nodule in a nodular goitre
• Malignant (10%): primary—thyroid adenocarcinoma, lymphoma,
medullary carcinoma; secondary—direct spread from local tumour,
metastatic spread from breast, colon/rectum, kidney, lung, lymphoma

Carcinoma of the thyroid
Primary tumours
• Papillary adenocarcinoma (60%) Typical age: 10–40y. 5 > 4
Low-grade malignancy. Rarely fatal. Spreads to local LNs and/or lung.
Sensitive to TSH. Treated with thyroidectomy then life-long thyroxine
• Follicular carcinoma (25%) Typical age range: 40–60y. 5 > 4. May
arise in a pre-existing multinodular goitre. Spreads via bloodstream.
Bony secondaries are common. Treatment is with surgery and
thyroxine suppression therapy and/or radioactive iodine
• Lymphoma (5%) Occurs at any age. May be p or s. Associated with
Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. Staged/treated as for lymphomas elsewhere
(b p. 680). Prognosis is good
• Anaplastic carcinoma (rare) Typical age: 50–60y. 5 > 4. Aggressive
tumour. Grows rapidly and infiltrates tissues of the neck. Tracheal
compression is common. Metastasizes locally to LNs and via
lymphatics. Poor response to treatment
• Medullary carcinoma (rare) Occurs at any age. 5 = 4. Familial
incidence; associated with adenomas elsewhere. Often secretes
calcitonin (used as tumour marker). Spreads to local LNs. Treated by
excision then chemotherapy ± radiotherapy

Lumps in the thyroid gland and goitres

Goitre There are 4 main types of goitre—see Table 12.4.
Thyroid cyst Usually degenerative part of a nodular goitre, though true

cysts do occur. Rapid enlargement/pain may be caused by haemorrhage
into a cyst. Refer for confirmation of diagnosis.

Thyroid adenoma 4 types classified according to histological

appearance—papillary, follicular, embryonal, hurtle cell. A few produce
thyroxine l thyrotoxicosis. Haemorrhage is rare and results in rapid i in
size. Refer for confirmation of diagnosis 9 surgery.

Hypothyroid babies are treated
with thyroxine; if there is tracheal
compression or hyperthyroidism,
treatment is surgical

Physiological

Occurs at puberty, during
pregnancy, and in conditions
of iodine deficiency

Usually requires no treatment. If iodine
deficient, treat with iodine supplements

Nodular

Toxic

Benign enlargement of the
thyroid gland with areas of
hyperplasia and involution

Graves’ disease—smooth

No treatment is necessary unless:
• Thyrotoxic
• Compression of the neck structures
l dyspnoea or dysphagia
• Worried by cosmetic appearance
• Focal i in size or recurrent laryngeal
nerve palsy (hoarseness)—suggests

hyperthyroidism—b p. 364

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis:
5>4. Antibodies to thyroid
tissue are produced. Initially
goitre and thyrotoxicosis
Later myxoedema

Inflammatory

De Quervain’s thyroiditis:
Inflammation due to viral
infection—usually Coxsackie

Thyroid disease
Interpretation of thyroid function tests See Table 12.5
Hyperthyroidism Affects 2% 5 and 0.2% 4. Peak age: 20–49y. Causes:
• Graves’ disease
• Toxic nodular goitre—older women
with past history of goitre
Presentation
• Hyperactivity
• Weight loss
• AF
• Tremor
• Hyperhidrosis
• Palpitations

• Thyroiditis
• Amiodarone
• Kelp ingestion
•	Eye changes
• Infertility
• Alopecia

0 In elderly patients, symptoms may be less obvious and include confusion, dementia, apathy, and depression.
Management Refer to endocrinology at presentation. Treatment:
• β-blockers (e.g. propranolol, atenolol) Useful for symptom control
until antithyroid drug therapy takes effect
• Carbimazole Inhibits synthesis of thyroid hormones. Ineffective
for treatment of thyroiditis. May be given short-term to render a
patient euthyroid prior to surgery or treatment with radioactive
iodine, or long-term (12–18mo) in an attempt to induce remission
(but >50% relapse). 3/1,000 patients have serious adverse effects—
agranulocytosis, hepatitis, aplastic anaemia, or lupus-like syndromes
• Radioactive iodine (131I) Effects take 3–4mo to become apparent.
Withdraw carbimazole >4d prior to treatment, and do not restart
until >3d after. Advise women of childbearing age to avoid pregnancy
for 4mo. Most become hypothyroid at some point (sometimes years)
after treatment. Continue monitoring TFTs long-term. Associated with
small i risk of thyroid malignancy
• Surgery Partial or total thyroidectomy—reserved for patients with
large goitres or who decline radioactive iodine. Carries risk of damage
to recurrent laryngeal nerve or parathyroids
• Warn all patients starting carbimazole to stop the drug and seek
urgent medical attention if they develop sore throat or other infection.

Thyrotoxic crisis/storm b p. 1101
Graves’ disease Most common cause of hyperthyroidism. 5:48 5:1.

Peak age: 30–50y. Associated with smoking and stressful life events.

Hypothyroidism (myxoedema) Common—10% 5 >60y, 5:48 8:1.
Causes Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, post-131I, thyroidectomy.
Presentation Onset tends to be insidious and may go undiagnosed for
years. Always consider hypothyroidism when a patient has non-specific
symptoms, depression, fatigue, lethargy, or general malaise. Other
symptoms—weight i, constipation, hoarse voice, or dry skin/hair. Signs
are often absent—there may be a goitre, slow-relaxing reflexes, or
non-pitting oedema of the hands, feet, or eyelids.
Screening Check TFTs in patients:
• With persistent symptoms of tiredness/lethargy without clear cause
• On amiodarone or with a history of 131I administration
• With hypercholesterolaemia, infertility, Turner’s or Down’s syndrome,
depression, dementia, obesity, DM, or other autoimmune disease
Management Patients taking thyroxine replacement are entitled to apply
for free prescriptions in England (b p. 137).
• <65y and healthy 100 micrograms od levothyroxine. Recheck TFTs
after 4–6wk. Adjust dose to keep TSH in the normal range. Once
dose is stable and TSH is within normal range monitor annually and if
symptomatic or worries about compliance. 0 Over-replacement is
associated with AF and osteoporosis
• If elderly or pre-existing heart disease Start 25 micrograms od
levothyroxine and i dose every 4–6wk according to TFTs. Consider
adding propranolol if history of CHD as levothyroxine can provoke angina
Withdrawal of levothyroxine Usually needed life long. If diagnosis is in
doubt stop and remeasure TFTs after 4–6wk.

Hyper- and hypocalcaemia
Checking Ca2+ Take an uncuffed sample (to avoid falsely high
readings) and correct for serum albumin—for every mmol/L less than
40, a correction of 0.02mmol/L should be added. For example:
Calcium  2.40
Albumin 24

Corrected calcium

= (40 – 24) × 0.02 + 2.4
= 0.32 + 2.4 = 2.72

Hypocalcaemia d serum calcium (<2.15mmol/L). Causes:
• If phosphate i CRF, hypoparathyroidism (may be congenital or
s to thyroid or parathyroid surgery, or malignant infiltration),
pseudohypoparathyroidism (insensitivity to parathyroid hormone)
• If phosphate normal or d Vitamin D deficiency (osteomalacia,
rickets), malabsorption, overhydration, pancreatitis
Presentation May be subtle. Includes:
• Perioral paraesthesia
• Tetany
•	Carpo-pedal spasm (wrist flexion
• Irritability, depression, or
and fingers drawn together)
psychosis
• Neuromuscular excitability (tapping over parotid causes facial muscles
to contract—Chvostek’s sign)
0 Apparent hypocalcaemia may be an artefact of hypoalbuminaemia.
Management Check vitamin D levels. Supplement with calcium. Referral
may be needed to investigate/treat the underlying cause.

Hypercalcaemia i level of serum calcium (>2.55mmol/L). Prevalence
81:500; 4:5 81:3. Rare < age 50y.
Uncommon causes
•	Chronic renal failure
•	Familial benign hypercalcaemia
• Sarcoidosis
• Thyrotoxicosis
• Milk alkali syndrome
• Vitamin D treatment
Presentation Often very non-specific. May be an incidental finding. Other
symptoms: ‘bones, stones, groans, and abdominal moans’.
• Polyuria and polydipsia
• Weight loss
• Tiredness
• Abdominal pain
• Low mood
• Lethargy
•	Constipation
• Stone formation
• Weakness
•	Confusion
• Mild aches and pains • Nausea/vomiting
•	Corneal calcification
(often intractable)
• Anorexia
Management
• Treat according to cause (see Figure 12.3)—malignancy (b p. 1030);
hyperparathyroidism (b p. 367)
• If diagnosis is unclear, refer to endocrinology. Urgency depends on
serum Ca2+ and severity of symptoms

Common causes (90%)
• Primary hyperparathyroidism
• Malignancy (10% tumours—
usually myeloma, breast, lung,
kidney, thyroid, prostate, ovary,
or colon)

• Hypercalcaemia can be fatal. If Ca2+ >3.5mmol/L or severe symptoms,
admit for lowering of Ca2+ with forced diuresis and IV bisphosphonate.

Hyper- and hypocalcaemia

Hyperparathyroidism i secretion of parathyroid hormone (PTH).
• p hyperparathyroidism Incidence 0.5/1,000. Peak age 40–60y. 5:48
2:1. Circulating level of PTH is inappropriately high. Most patients are
hypercalcaemic (but may be normocalcaemic if coexistent vitamin D
deficiency). Due to i secretion of PTH from one or both parathyroid
glands. Refer. Treatment is usually surgical
• s hyperparathyroidism i PTH in response to chronic hypocalcaemia
or hyperphosphataemia. Treat cause
• Tertiary hyperparathyroidism Inappropriately i PTH li Ca2+.
Follows prolonged s hyperparathyroidism. Most common in
patients with chronic renal failure (especially if on dialysis) or chronic
malabsorption. Treatment is usually surgical

Familial benign hypercalcaemia Asymptomatic. Inherited condition
in which serum calcium concentrations are mildly i throughout life.
Confirm (if possible) by demonstrating i Ca2+ in other family members.
No adverse consequences and no treatment needed.
Milk alkali syndrome Usually due to ingestion of OTC indigestion
remedies (e.g. Rennies®). Ca2+ levels revert to normal on stopping. Investigate
the reason why the patient is taking these remedies (? peptic ulcer).
Sometimes also caused by calcium supplements taken with bisphosphonates
for prophylaxis of osteoporosis—stop the calcium supplement.

Endocrinology

Adrenal disorders
Disorders of the adrenal cortex The adrenal cortex produces three
classes of steroids:
• Glucocorticoids, e.g. cortisol
• Mineralocorticoids, e.g. aldosterone, and
• Sex hormones, e.g. androstenedione, testosterone, and oestrogen
Symptoms result from disturbance in production of these steroids.
Cushing’s syndrome In the majority of cases, Cushing’s syndrome is
iatrogenic—caused by exogenous administration of prednisolone or other
corticosteroids. Non-iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome is much rarer with
annual incidence of 1–2/million (5:4 83:1):
• 80% have a pituitary adenoma which secretes adrenocorticotrophic
hormone (ACTH) causing hypersecretion of glucocorticoids and sex
hormones (Cushing’s disease)
• 20% are due to ectopic ACTH secretion by other tumours (e.g. small
cell lung cancer) or hypersecreting tumours of the adrenal cortex
H.W. Cushing (1869–1939)—US neurosurgeon.
Presentation Cushing’s syndrome has high morbidity and mortality.
Clinical features include:
• Osteoporosis (60%) • Pigmentation
• Moon face (90%)
•	Feminization in men
• Truncal obesity (85%) • Lethargy/
• Polyuria and
depression (60%)
• Hypertension (80%)
polydipsia
• Hirsuitism
• Menstrual
• Psychosis
• Acne
disturbance (80%)
• Striae and bruising (60%)
Management
• Stop/minimize exogenous steroids
• If no exogenous steroids and Cushing’s syndrome is suspected, request
a dexamethasone suppression test—dexamethasone 1mg po at
midnight, then serum cortisol measured at 9 a.m. If <50mmol/L exclude
diagnosis unless cortisol secretion is episodic. If ≥50mmol/L check
ACTH level and 24h urinary free cortisol and seek expert advice

Adrenal insufficiency (Addison’s disease) May be:
• Primary—resulting from adrenal disease/failure, or
• Secondary—resulting from inadequate pituitary or hypothalamic
stimulation of the adrenal glands
In the UK, most cases result from autoimmune disease, surgery, cessation
of therapeutic corticosteroids, or failure to i steroid dose to cover stress.
Worldwide TB and AIDS are major causes. T. Addison (1795–1860)—
English physician.
Clinical features
• Postural hypotension/
• Abdominal
• Tiredness (95%)
fainting (15%)
pain (30%)
• Weakness (95%)
• Nausea
• Myalgia/
• Anorexia (95%)
arthralgia (20%)
• Weight loss (90%)
• Pigmentation (buccal, palmar creases, new scars—90%)

Adrenal disorders

Presentation
•	Can be dramatic with coma and severe hypoglycaemia (b p. 1101—
admit as an emergency) or insidious
• 50% patients with autoimmune Addison’s disease have or will develop
another autoimmune disease (e.g. Graves’ disease, pernicious anaemia)
and 5% of women develop premature ovarian failure
Short Synacthen® test Take 9 a.m. blood for serum cortisol levels; inject
250 micrograms Synacthen® IV or IM; take a further blood sample for
serum cortisol levels half an hour later. If 30min cortisol level is:
• >600nmol/L—adrenal insufficiency is excluded
• 400–590nmol/L—the result is equivocal; repeat
• <400nmol/L—adrenal insufficiency is confirmed; check ACTH (if d,
investigate pituitary function; if i investigate cause of adrenal disease)
Other investigations
• Biochemical abnormalities—i K+, d Na+, d glucose (may not be
symptomatic), uraemia, i Ca2+, abnormal LFTs
•	FBC—normocytic anaemia, eosinophilia, lymphocytosis
Management Refer to endocrinology. Treatment usually involves replacing
deficient steroids with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone.
0 Warn patients not to stop steroids abruptly, to tell any doctor treating
them about their condition and wear Medic-Alert/Medi-Tag bracelet in
case of emergency. Double dose of hydrocortisone prior to dental treatment or if intercurrent illness (e.g. URTI). If vomiting, replace hydrocortisone po with IM hydrocortisone.

Hyperaldosteronism Suggested by presence of i BP resistant to
treatment together with d K+—but normokalaemic cases are also
described. May be primary (two out of three have an aldosterone-secreting
adenoma) when termed Conn’s syndrome, or secondary to excess
renin secretion (e.g. due to renal artery stenosis). If suspected, refer for
endocrine assessment. Treatment depends on the cause.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia b p. 894
Disorders of the adrenal medulla
Phaechromocytoma Rare but serious disorder affecting 0.1% hypertensive
patients. Usually caused by catecholamine-secreting tumours—10% are
bilateral; 10% are extra-adrenal; 10% occur in children; 10% are malignant.
May present with a huge array of symptoms and signs. i BP may be
sporadic or sustained. Suspect in patients who:
• Are young with i BP
• Have very labile BP or sudden onset hypertension
• Have i BP and associated headaches, sweating, and/or palpitations
• Have other associated conditions (e.g. neurofibromatosis)
Check 24h urine catecholamine/metabolite levels (follow local laboratory
protocol). If confirmed or strong suspicion despite –ve test, refer for specialist opinion. Treatment is usually surgical if tumour is found.

• Tumour (may be non-secreting or secrete one pituitary hormone with
d secretion of the others)
• Infection—TB
• Sheehan’s syndrome—pituitary necrosis after post-partum
haemorrhage (H.L. Sheehan—English pathologist)
Presentation
• Hypothyroidism
• Hypogonadism
• Anorexia

• Headache
• Depression
• Hair loss

• Hypotension
• Visual field defect

Management If suspected refer to neurology or endocrinology for
further investigation and advice on treatment.

Pituitary tumours 10% intracranial tumours. Almost all are benign.
Classified by histological type (chromophobic, acidophilic, or basophilic)
or by the hormone secreted:
• No hormone (30%)
• Prolactin (35%)
• Growth hormone (20%)
• ACTH (7%)
• Prolactin and growth hormone (7%)
• LH, FSH, and TSH (1%)
Presentation Present with symptoms caused by:
• Local pressure—bilateral hemianopia, cranial nerve palsies, headache
• Hormone secretion, and/or
• Hypopituitarism
Management If suspected refer for further investigation and treatment.
Pituitary apoplexy Rapid expansion of a pituitary tumour due to infarction
or haemorrhage. Suspect if sudden onset of headache in a patient with
a known pituitary tumour. Admit as a medical/neurosurgical emergency.

Craniopharyngioma Tumour originating from Rathke’s pouch. 50%
present with local pressure effects in children. Refer as for pituitary
tumours.
Hyperprolactinaemia The most common pituitary disorder resulting
from pituitary adenoma.
Presentation Tends to present earlier in women than men. Symptoms are
due to pressure effects or i prolactin. Symptoms of i prolactin:
• 5: loss of libido, weight gain, apathy, vaginal dryness, menstrual
disturbance, infertility, galactorrhoea
• 4: impotence, d facial hair

Pituitary problems

Investigation Check basal plasma prolactin (ask the laboratory for
conditions under which they would like the sample taken).
Management If suspected refer for specialist opinion.
Other causes of i prolactin
• Drugs—phenothiazines,
• Pregnancy
metoclopramide, domperidone,
• Breastfeeding
SSRIs, methyldopa, oestrogens
• Stress
•	Chronic renal failure
• Sleep
• Sarcoidosis
• Hypothyroidism
Acromegaly Rare condition due to a growth-hormone-secreting
pituitary tumour. Typical age at presentation: 30–50y.
Presentation
• Local pressure symptoms
•	Changes in appearance—coarse oily skin; change in facial appearance
with coarsening of features; i foot size; i teeth spacing
• Other effects—deepening of voice, sweating, paraesthesia, proximal
muscle weakness, progressive heart failure, goitre
• Complications—DM, i BP, cardiomyopathy, large bowel tumours
Investigation and management Refer to endocrinology.
Diabetes insipidus (DI) Caused by impaired water resorption by the
kidney. Two mechanisms:
• Cranial DI d ADH secretion from the posterior pituitary. 50%
idiopathic. Other causes: head injury, tumour, infection, sarcoidosis,
vascular, inherited
• Nephrogenic DI Impaired response of the kidney to ADH. Causes:
drugs (e.g. lithium), hypercalcaemia, pyelonephritis, hydronephrosis,
pregnancy (rare)
Presentation Polydipsia, polyuria, dilute urine, dehydration.
Investigations U&E (Na+i), plasma and urine osmolality (plasma i,
urine d—ratio >1). Specialist investigations (e.g. water deprivation test)
confirm diagnosis.
Management Treat the cause.
•	Cranial DI may be treated with intranasal desmopressin or surgery
• Nephrogenic DI may be treated with dietary restriction of protein and
salt and/or bendroflumethiazide

Syndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH) Important cause of

hyponatraemia. Diagnosis is made by finding a concentrated urine (sodium
>20mmol/L) in the presence of hyponatraemia (<125mmol/L) or low
plasma osmolality (<260mmol/kg) in the absence of hypovolaemia, oedema,
or diuretics. Always requires specialist management. Causes:
• Malignancy, e.g. small cell lung cancer; pancreas; lymphoma
• CNS disorders, e.g. stroke; subdural haemorrhage; vasculitis (SLE)

0 Signs may be unclear in elderly patients, children, or those on steroids.

History Consider:
• Site of pain—see Figure 13.1
• Onset: how long? How did it start? Change over time?
• Character of pain: colicky pain comes and goes in waves—results from
GI obstruction, renal/biliary colic, gastroenteritis, or IBS
• Radiation
• Associated symptoms, e.g. nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea
• Timing/pattern, e.g. constant, colicky, relationship to food
• Exacerbating/relieving factors—including previous treatments tried
• Severity
Examination

Temperature, pulse, BP, respiratory rate
Anaemia or jaundice?
Abdomen—site of pain (see Figure 13.1); guarding/rebound tenderness?
Rectal/vaginal examination as needed
Consider urine dipstick/finger prick blood glucose testing as needed

Management Treat the cause (see Table 13.1).

Vomiting and diarrhoea
Most episodes of acute vomiting and diarrhoea are due to viral infection,
short-lived (2–5d), and self-limiting.
Nausea Unpleasant symptom. The patient feels as if he/she might vomit.
Most conditions which cause vomiting can also cause nausea.

Vomiting Common symptom. Causes—see Table 13.2.
History
• Duration
• Ability to retain food and fluids/relationship to eating
•	Nature of vomitus, e.g. presence of blood or ‘coffee grounds’; bilious
• Contact with anyone else with similar symptoms?
• Other associated symptoms, e.g. fever, abdominal pain, diarrhoea
• Other illnesses, e.g. DM, Ménière’s disease, migraine, cancer
• Medication, e.g. opioids, chemotherapy
Examination
• Assess hydration status—BP, pulse rate; dry mouth, d skin turgor,
sunken eyes, or sunken fontanelle (babies) are all late signs
• Abdomen—masses, distension, tenderness, bowel sounds
• For children—look for other sources of infection, e.g. ENT, chest, UTI

Haematemesis b p. 1076
Slimy stool Caused by overproduction of mucus in the large bowel.

Almost always associated with colonic disease/irritable bowel syndrome.
Investigate, unless all other features are typical of IBS and age is <40y.

Diarrhoea Establish what the patient means by diarrhoea. Diarrhoea is
the abnormal passage of loose or liquid stools. Causes—see Table 13.2.
History
• Duration—termed ‘chronic’ if persists >4wk
•	Nature of the diarrhoea—colour, consistency, blood/mucus
• Contact with anyone else with similar symptoms?
• Occupation and travel history
• Associated symptoms, e.g. fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, weight d
• Association with other factors (e.g. food intolerance, stress)
• Past medical history—surgery (especially ileal resection or
cholecystectomy); pancreatic disease; systemic disease (e.g. DM,
thyrotoxicosis)
• Family history—inflammatory bowel or coeliac disease; bowel cancer
• Alcohol consumption—high intake is associated with diarrhoea
• Medication, e.g. antibiotics, regular medications (4% chronic diarrhoea)
Examination
• Assess hydration status—BP, pulse rate; dry mouth, d skin turgor,
sunken eyes, or sunken fontanelle (babies) are all late signs
• Abdomen—masses, distension, tenderness, bowel sounds, stool
Investigation Send a stool sample for M,C&S if any of the following:
• Recent return from • Resident in an
• Fever
institution
a tropical climate
• Blood in stool
• Immunocompromise • Persists >7d
• Food worker

Vomiting

Diarrhoea

Physiological e.g. possetting in babies
Travel/motion sickness
GI infection, e.g. viral gastroenteritis, food
poisoning
Other infection (particularly children)—
tonsillitis, otitis media
Other GI causes: GI obstruction, pyloric
stenosis, ‘acute abdomen’
CNS causes: raised intracranial pressure,
head injury, migraine, vertigo
Metabolic causes: pregnancy, uraemia,
ketoacidosis
Psychiatric causes: anorexia, bulimia
Malignancy
Drugs and toxins, e.g. alcohol, opioids,
cytotoxic agents

Acute diarrhoea
– Dietary indiscretion
– Infection, e.g. food poisoning,
travellers’ diarrhoea
– Constipation with overflow
– Pseudomembranous colitis—
recent history of oral antibiotics
– Onset of inflammatory bowel
disease or other chronic diarrhoea
Chronic diarrhoea
See Table 13.11, b p. 407

Management of acute diarrhoea and/or vomiting
• Treat any identified cause
• Rehydration—encourage clear fluid intake (small amounts frequently)
± rehydration salts (use a commercial preparation, e.g. Dioralyte®)
• Food—stick to a bland diet, avoiding dairy products until symptoms
have settled. Babies who are breastfed or have not been weaned
should continue their normal milk
• If dehydrated and unable to replace fluids, e.g. diarrhoea with
concomitant vomiting or child/elderly person refusing to drink—admit
• Never give children antidiarrhoeal agents.
0 If no cause is found and diarrhoea lasts >4wk or any atypical features,
consider referral for urgent investigation—b p. 406.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Constipation
3 million GP consultations/y in the UK result from constipation.
Differentiate normal stools a few days apart (normal, needs no treatment)
and infrequent hard stools (suggests constipation).
Definition Two or more of the following for ≥3 mo:
• Straining at defecation ≥25% of the time
• A sensation of incomplete evacuation ≥25% of the time
• ≤2 bowel movements /wk
• Lumpy and/or hard stools ≥25% of the time
0 Most patients consulting in general practice do not meet these criteria.
Children with constipation b p. 888
Young patients <40y with lone constipation 5:48 9:1. Establish
symptoms—constipation is usually long-standing in this group. Include drug
and diet history. Ask about health beliefs—80% believe their bowels should
open daily. Explore concerns about underlying disease. If long-standing ask
why the patient is consulting now. Examine the abdomen. Investigate if
symptoms/signs suggestive of organic disease (see Table 13.3).
Management Treat organic causes. Otherwise:
• Give lifestyle advice—i fluid intake to ≥2L/d (8–10 cups); avoid
alcohol; i exercise if possible; add fibre to diet (i fruit/vegetables,
eat wholegrain foods, add coarse bran to food); open bowel
when needed
• If lifestyle advice alone fails and symptoms are causing distress, start an
osmotic laxative, e.g. magnesium hydroxide 15mL bd
• If an osmotic laxative fails, try a short course of stimulant laxative
e.g. senna 1–2 tablets at 5 p.m. either alone or in combination with
an osmotic laxative. Long-term use of some stimulant laxatives
is reported to cause cathartic atonic colon. Although there is no
evidence that senna causes this, in young, fit patients only use short
courses or use intermittently, e.g twice weekly
• If still constipated specialist referral is warranted
Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation 20% develop
symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in their lifetime (b p. 418).
Constipation is the predominant symptom in 30%, but other symptoms are
usually present. Establish symptoms. Examine the abdomen. Investigation
includes FBC, CRP, and coeliac serology to exclude organic causes.
Management If <40 y, examination and investigations are normal and
fulfill IBS criteria (b p. 418), manage as for young patients with lone
constipation but avoid osmotic laxatives as they make bloating worse.
Constipation in the over 40s Any sustained change in bowel habit
for >6wk should be taken seriously and investigated if appropriate.
Establish symptoms and onset. Specifically ask about tenesmus, blood
in stool, abdominal pain, and diarrhoea. Check current medication.
Examine the abdomen for masses and hepatomegaly. Rectal examination
is essential to exclude low rectal or anal carcinoma and detect faecal
impaction.

Management
• Check FBC, ESR, renal function tests, LFTs, TFTs, and serum glucose
• Image the lower bowel by colonoscopy or CT colography if new
symptoms that persist >6wk
• Treat any reversible, underlying organic cause—see Table 13.3
• Give lifestyle advice (see management of young people with lone
constipation)
• Treat symptomatically if no cause is found/cause is untreatable
• Laxatives—consider an osmotic (e.g. lactulose, magnesium hydroxide)
or bulk-forming laxative (e.g. ispaghula, sterculia) ± a stimulant laxative
(e.g. senna). Titrate dose to response
• Long-term use of stimulant laxatives including co-danthrusate is
acceptable in the very elderly. Otherwise, use prn or intermittently
• If oral laxatives are ineffective consider adding rectal measures. If soft
stool, try bisacodyl suppositories (0 must come into direct contact
with rectum); if hard stools try glycerin suppositories (act in 1–6h)
• If still not cleared/faecal impaction—refer to the district nurse for
lubricant ± high phosphate (stimulant) enema (acts in 720min)
• Once constipation has been cleared, leave the patient with clear
instructions about what to do if symptoms recur

• High-risk patients, e.g. patients on opioids; those who are immobile or have medical conditions which predispose them to constipation.
Pre-empt constipation by putting high-risk patients on regular aperients.
	
Occult presentations of constipation are common
in the elderly and include:
• Overflow diarrhoea
• Confusion
• Loss of appetite and nausea
• Urinary retention
• Abdominal pain

Abdominal distension Consider abdominal/pelvic masses and:
• Fluid—ascites or
full bladder
• Fat

• Faeces
• Fetus
• Flatus—intestinal
• Food, e.g.
obstruction; air swallowing

Abdominal masses Distinguished from pelvic masses by the ability
to get beneath them. Causes: Malignancy—any intra-abdominal organ or
kidney; stool; abdominal aortic aneurysm; hepato- and/or splenomegaly;
appendix mass/abscess; Crohn’s mass; lymph nodes or TB mass. 0 A hernia may present as a mass in abdominal wall/groin lump—b p. 392.
Pelvic masses Causes: fetus; full bladder; fibroids; gynaecological
malignancy; bladder cancer.

Splenomegaly Causes:
• Haematological Lymphoma, leukaemia, myeloproliferative disorders,
sickle cell disease (children usually), thalassaemia
• Inflammatory RA or Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoid, amyloid
• Infection Glandular fever, malaria, SBE, TB, leishmaniasis
Hepatomegaly Causes:
• Apparent Reidel’s lobe, low-lying diaphragm
• Tumours Secondary (most common), primary
• Venous congestion Heart failure, hepatic vein occlusion
• Haematological Leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorders,
sickle cell disease
• Biliary obstruction Particularly extrahepatic
• Inflammation Hepatitis, abscess, schistosomiasis
• Metabolic Fatty liver, amyloid, glycogen storage disease
• Cysts Polycystic liver, hydatid
Ascites Free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Signs: abdominal distension,
shifting dullness to percussion, fluid thrill. Causes: Malignancy—any
intra-abdominal organ, ovary, or kidney; hypoproteinaemia, e.g. nephrotic
syndrome; right heart failure; portal hypertension.

Urgent referral for upper GI symptomsN Consider checking
FBC when referring, depending on local protocols.
Urgent referral to a team specializing in upper GI malignancy Patients
presenting with:
• Dysphagia
• Unexplained upper abdominal pain and weight d ± back pain
• Upper abdominal mass without dyspepsia
• Obstructive jaundice (depending on clinical state)—consider urgent
USS if available
Consider urgent referral to a specialist in upper GI malignancy Patients
presenting with:
• Persistent vomiting and weight d in the absence of dyspepsia
• Unexplained weight d or iron deficiency in the absence of dyspepsia
• Unexplained worsening of dyspepsia and Barrett’s oesophagus;
known dysplasia, atrophic gastritis, or intestinal metaplasia; or peptic
ulcer surgery >20y ago
Consider urgent specialist referral or referral for urgent endoscopy Patients
of any age with dyspepsia and:
• Persistent vomiting
• Chronic GI bleeding
• Iron deficiency anaemia
• Dysphagia
• Epigastric mass
• Progressive unintentional
• Suspicious barium meal result
weight d
Urgent referral for endoscopy Any patient ≥55y and with unexplained
(i.e. no obvious cause, e.g NSAIDs) and persistent, recent-onset
dyspepsia alone. GPs should not allow symptoms to persist >4–6wk
before referral.
0 Helicobacter pylori status should not affect the decision to refer for
suspected cancer. Consider checking FBC to exclude iron deficiency
anaemia in all patients presenting with new-onset dyspepsia.
Urgent referral for lower GI symptomsN Refer urgently to a
team specializing in lower GI malignancy if:
Any age with:
• Right lower abdominal mass consistent with involvement of large bowel
• A palpable rectal mass (intraluminal, not pelvic; a pelvic mass outside
the bowel would warrant an urgent referral to a urologist)
• Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (Hb ≤110g/dL for 4 ≤100g/dL
for a non-menstruating 5)
Aged ≥40y Reporting rectal bleeding with a change of bowel habit
towards looser stools and/or increased stool frequency persisting ≥6wk.
Aged ≥60y with:
• Rectal bleeding persisting for ≥6wk without a change in bowel habit
and without anal symptoms
• Change in bowel habit to looser stools and/or more frequent stools
persisting for ≥6wk without rectal bleeding
0 In a patient with equivocal symptoms who is not unduly anxious, it is
reasonable to ‘treat, watch, and wait’.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Dyspepsia and H. pylori
In any year, up to 40% of the adult population suffer from dyspepsia—1:10
seek their GP’s advice; 710% of these are referred for endoscopy.

Causes
•
•
•
•

Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)—15–25% (b p. 386)
Peptic ulcer (PU)—15–25% (b p. 388)
Stomach cancer—2% (b p. 390)
The remaining 60% are classified as non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD,
‘functional’ dyspepsia)—manage as for uninvestigated dyspepsia
• Rarer causes: oesophagitis from swallowed corrosives, oesophageal
infection (especially in the immunocompromised)
Differential diagnosis Cardiac pain (difficult to distinguish), gallstone
pain, pancreatitis, bile reflux.

Presentation Common symptoms include retrosternal or epigastric
pain, fullness, bloating, wind, heartburn, nausea, and vomiting. Examination is
usually normal though there may be epigastric tenderness. Check for clinical
anaemia, epigastric mass/hepatomegaly, and LNs in the neck.
Management See Figure 13.2.
Helicobacter pylori Infection is associated with:
• GI disease—peptic ulcer disease; gastric cancer; non-ulcer dyspepsia;
oesophagitis
• Non-GI disease—ranging from cardiovascular disease and
haematological malignancy to cot death
Testing for H. pyloriN ‘Test and treat’ all patients with dyspepsia who do
not meet referral criteria (see Figure 13.2). In practice choice of test is
limited by availability, ease of access, and cost. Options in the community
are: serology, urea breath test, and faecal antigen test. A 2wk washout
period following proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use is necessary before
testing for H. pylori with a breath test or a stool antigen test.
EradicationN Clears 80–85% H. pylori infections. Options:
• PAC500 regimen Full-dose PPI (e.g. omeprazole 20mg bd) +
amoxicillin 1g bd + clarithromycin 500mg bd for 1wk, or
• PMC250 regimen Full-dose PPI (e.g. omeprazole 20mg bd) +
metronidazole 400mg bd + clarithromycin 250mg bd for 1wk
0 Do not re-test even if dyspepsia remains unless there is a strong clinical need. Re-test if needed using a urea breath test.
Lifestyle advice Give advice on healthy eating, weight d, and smoking
cessation. Advise patients to avoid precipitating factors, e.g. alcohol, coffee,
chocolate, fatty foods. Raising the head of the bed and having a main meal
well before going to bed may help some people. Promote continued use
of antacids/alginates.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Oesophageal conditions
Oesophagitis Common condition. Reflux of acid from the stomach

to the oesophagus causes mucosal damage resulting in inflammation and
ulceration. Other causes: drugs (e.g. NSAIDs); infection (e.g. CMV, HSV,
candida—especially in the immunocompromised); ingestion of caustic
substances.
Management Treat reflux-induced oesophagitis as for GORD—b
p. 386. Otherwise treat the cause.
Barrett’s oesophagus b p. 387.

Chronic benign stricture Recurrent oesophagitis (e.g. s to GORD,

NSAIDs, K+ preparations) scars the oesophagus resulting in stricture
formation. Most common in elderly women.
Presentation Long history of reflux with more recent dysphagia. If
obstruction is severe undigested food may be regurgitated immediately after
swallowing. May be associated with night-time coughing paroxysms due to
aspiration of gastric contents into the chest. Examination is usually normal.
Management Refer for urgent endoscopy to confirm diagnosis and
exclude carcinoma. Treatment is by endoscopic dilatation of the stricture.

Carcinoma of the oesophagus b p. 390
Presbyoesophagus Common among the elderly. Intermittent
sensation that food is getting stuck—usually at the back of the throat.
Examination is normal as is endoscopy. Barium swallow or oesophageal
motility studies may reveal oesophageal spasm. Reassure.
Globus pharyngis (or hystericus) Sensation of a lump in the throat
without difficulty swallowing is common. It may indicate anxiety. Reassure
if no organic signs and treat any dyspepsia. If not responding refer to ENT
for exclusion of an organic cause.
Oesophageal achalasia Failure of relaxation of the circular muscles at
the distal oesophagus. Peak incidence: 30–40y; 5 slightly >4.

Presentation Gradual onset of dysphagia over years accompanied by
regurgitation of stagnant food and foul belching. Night-time coughing fits are
due to aspiration which can result in recurrent chest infections. Examination
is usually normal although there may be signs of aspiration pneumonia.
Management CXR to exclude aspiration pneumonia; endoscopy confirms
diagnosis. Refer for surgery.

Plummer–Vinson syndrome Iron deficiency anaemia + dysphagia due

to a post-cricoid web in the oesophagus. 5 > 4. Peak incidence: 40–50y.
Presents with high dysphagia with food sticking in the back of the throat
± retching/choking sensation. This is a pre-malignant condition so refer for
biopsy and dilatation of pharyngeal web; replace iron.
H.S. Plummer (1874–1936); P.P. Vinson (1890–1959)—US physicians.

Oesophageal conditions

Pharyngeal pouch Pulsion diverticulum of the pharyngeal mucosa

through Killian’s dehiscence (area of weakness between the 2 parts of
the inferior pharyngeal constrictor). 4 > 5; i with age. Usually develops
posteriorly then protrudes to one side—L > R. As the pouch gets larger
the oesophagus is displaced laterally.
Presentation Dysphagia—the first mouthful is swallowed easily, then
fills the pouch which makes further swallowing difficult. Accompanied by
regurgitation of food from the pouch ± symptoms of aspiration (night-time
coughing, recurrent chest infection). A swelling is palpable in the neck in
two-thirds of cases.
Management Refer for further investigation. Diagnosis is confirmed with
endoscopy/barium swallow. Treatment is surgical.

Oesophageal varices Result from portal hypertenion (b p. 425) and
can bleed massively—admit as a ‘blue light’ emergency if bleeding.
Impacted oesophageal foreign body Usually the patient notices

something has stuck resulting in pain, difficulty swallowing ± retching. If
suspected refer immediately to A&E for further investigation ± removal
of the foreign body.

Oesophageal perforation Rare—usually a complication of
endoscopy. Less commonly due to violent vomiting. The patient becomes
very distressed with pain relating to the site of perforation which is
worse on swallowing. Examination reveals tachycardia, shock ± pyrexia
± breathlessness ± surgical emphysema in neck. Admit as a surgical
emergency.
	Oesophageal atresia and/or tracheo-oesophageal
fistula 1:2,500 live births. 5% have oesophageal atresia

alone; 5% tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) alone; the
remainder have both. Risk factor for sudden infant death
syndrome.

Presentation
• Antenatal: at routine USS or following investigation of
polyhydramnios
• Post-natal: cough or breathing difficulties in a newborn infant,
choking on the first feed, inability to swallow saliva l bubbling of
fluid from the mouth, developing soon after birth
• Later in childhood: ‘H type’ fistulas where there is no atresia, but
just a fistula may present late with recurrent chest infections
Management Diagnosis is confirmed with X-ray. Treatment is surgical.
Post-operatively children may have a barking cough (‘TOF cough’ ) and/
or dysphagia—both settle before 2y.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Gastro-oesophageal reflux
and gastritis
Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) Caused by retrograde
flow of gastric contents through an incompetent gastro-oesophageal junction.
It affects 75% of the adult population.
Risk factors
• Obesity
• Drugs (NSAIDs, TCAs,
• Smoking
• Hiatus hernia
SSRIs, iron supplements,
• Alcohol
• Tight clothes
anticholinergics, nitrates,
• Coffee
• Pregnancy
alendronic acid)
• Fatty food
• Systemic sclerosis
• Surgery for achalasia
• Big meals
Conditions caused by GORD
• Oesophagitis (defined by mucosal breaks) ± oesophageal ulcer
• Benign oesophageal stricture—b p. 384
• Intestinal metaplasia: Barrett’s oesophagus
• Oesophageal haemorrhage
• Anaemia
Presentation
• Heartburn: most common symptom. Burning retrosternal or epigastric
pain which worsens on bending, stooping or lying, and with hot drinks.
Relieved by antacids
• Other symptoms:
• Waterbrash—mouth fills with saliva
• Reflux of acid into the mouth—especially on lying flat
• Nausea and vomiting
• Nocturnal cough/wheeze due to aspiration of refluxed stomach
contents
• Examination: usually normal. Check for clinical anaemia, epigastric
mass/hepatomegaly, and LNs in the neck
Investigation Endoscopy if indicated—see Figure 13.2, b p. 383.
0 Symptoms are poorly correlated with endoscopic findings. Reflux
may remain silent in patients with Barrett’s oesophagus but heartburn can
severely affect quality of life of patients with –ve endoscopy results.
Initial managementN
• In all cases, give lifestyle advice (b p. 382)
• If diagnosis is clinical (i.e. patient presents with ‘reflux-like’ symptoms),
treat as for uninvestigated dyspepsia (see Figure 13.2, b p. 383)
• For patients with reflux confirmed on endoscopy, offer treatment
with a PPI (e.g. omeprazole 20mg od) for 1–2mo. If oesophagitis at
endoscopy and the patient remains symptomatic on PPI, double the
dose of PPI for a further 1mo
• If inadequate response to PPI, try an H2 receptor antagonist
(e.g. ranitidine 150mg bd) and/or add a prokinetic (e.g. domperidone
10mg tds) for 1mo

Gastro-oesophageal reflux and gastritis

Long-term management of endoscopically/barium-confirmed GORDN.
• Patients who have had dilatation of an oesophageal stricture should
remain on long-term full-dose PPI therapy
• For all other patients, if symptoms recur following initial treatment,
offer a PPI at the lowest dose possible to control symptoms, with a
limited number of repeat prescriptions. Discuss using the treatment on
an as-required basis to manage symptoms
• Refer for consideration of surgery if quality of life remains significantly
impaired despite optimal treatment. Surgery of any type is >90%
successful although results may deteriorate with time

Hiatus hernia Common (30% of over 50s); 50% have GORD. Obesity
is a risk factor. The proximal stomach herniates through the diaphragmatic
hiatus into the thorax
• 80% have a ‘sliding’ hiatus hernia where the gastro-oesophageal
junction slides into the chest
• 20% have a ‘rolling’ hernia where a bulge of stomach herniates into
the chest alongside the oesophagus. The gastro-oesophageal junction
remains in the abdomen
Management Treat as for GORD.

Barrett’s oesophagus Usually found incidentally at endoscopy for

symptoms of GORD and caused by chronic GORD. The squamous
mucosa of the oesophagus undergoes metaplastic change, and the
squamocolumnar junction appears to migrate away from the stomach.
The length affected varies. It carries a x40 i risk of adenocarcinoma of
the oesophagus, so regular endoscopy is essential. Treatment is with
long-term PPIs (e.g omeprazole 20–40mg od) ± laser therapy ± resection.
N.R. Barrett (1903–1979)—British surgeon.

Acute gastritis Mucosal inflammation of the stomach with no ulcer.
• Type A: affects the entire stomach; associated with pernicious
anaemia; pre-malignant
• Type B: affects antrum ± duodenum; associated with H. pylori
• Type C: due to irritants, e.g. NSAIDs, alcohol, bile reflux
Presentation and investigation Dyspepsia—b p. 382
Management
• Treat the cause where possible (e.g. vitamin B12 injections; H. pylori
eradication; avoidance of alcohol)
• Acid suppression—H2 receptor antagonist (e.g. ranitidine, nizatidine)
or PPI for 4–8wk
• Re-endoscope to confirm healing
Complications Haemorrhage, gastric atrophy ± gastric cancer (type A only).

Gastrointestinal medicine

Peptic ulceration
Peptic ulceration (PU) is a term which includes both gastric and duo­denal
ulceration. Most patients present with dyspepsia (b p. 382). Specific
­features of gastric and duodenal ulcers are listed in Table 13.5.

Management
For patients not taking NSAIDs
• Eradicate H. pylori if present (b p. 382). Speeds ulcer healing and
d relapse; confirm eradication with a urea breath test (duodenal ulcer)
or repeat endoscopy (gastric ulcer), and retreat if still present
• If H. pylori negative Treat with full-dose PPI (e.g omeprazole 20mg
od) for 1–2mo. If gastric ulcer, re-endoscope to check ulcer is healed
For patients taking NSAIDs
• Stop NSAIDs where possible. If not possible consider changing
to a safer alternative (e.g. paracetamol, d dose of NSAID,
COX2-selective NSAID) and adding gastric protection with a PPI or
misoprostol
• Offer full-dose PPI or H2 receptor antagonist (H2RA) therapy for 2mo
and, if H. pylori is present, subsequently offer eradication therapy
• Check eradication with repeat endoscopy (gastric ulcer) or urea
breath test (duodenal ulcer)
For all patients
• Lifestyle measures Avoid foods (or alcohol) which exacerbate
symptoms; eat little and often; avoid eating <3h before bed. Stop smoking
• If symptoms recur following initial treatment Offer a PPI at
lowest dose to control symptoms, with a limited number of repeat
prescriptions. Discuss using the treatment on a prn basis
• Offer H2RA therapy If there is an inadequate response to a PPI
• In patients with unhealed ulcer or continuing symptoms Despite
adequate treatment, exclude non-adherence, malignancy, failure to
detect H. pylori, inadvertent NSAID use, other ulcer-inducing medication,
and rare causes, e.g. Zollinger–Ellison syndrome, Crohn’s disease
• Once symptoms are controlled Review at least annually to discuss
symptom control, lifestyle advice, and medication
• Refer If gastric ulcer fails to heal or if symptoms do not respond to
medical treatment. Possible surgical procedures include: gastrectomy,
vagotomy, and drainage procedure; highly selective vagotomy
Zollinger–Ellison syndrome Association of peptic ulcer with
a gastrin-secreting pancreatic (rarely duodenal) adenoma—50–60%
are malignant, 10% are multiple, and 30% are associated with multiple
endocrine neoplasia (MEN I). Incidence: 0.1% of patients with duodenal
ulcer disease. Suspect in those with multiple peptic ulcers resistant to
drugs, particularly if associated with diarrhoea ± steatorrhoea or a family
history of peptic ulcers (or islet cell, pituitary, or parathyroid adenomas).
Refer for further investigation. Treatment is with PPIs (e.g omeprazole
10–60mg bd) ± surgery.

indigestion. Presents with sudden onset severe epigastric pain
which rapidly becomes generalized. When a GU perforates into
the lesser sac symptoms may remain localized or be confined
to the right side of the abdomen. Examination: generalized
peritonism with ‘board-like rigidity’. Management: acute surgical
admission
Pyloric stenosis in adults: duodenal stenosis s to scarring
from a chronic DU. Characterized by copious vomiting of food
1–2 days old. There may not be a past history of indigestion.

Gastro-oesophageal malignancy
Carcinoma of the oesophagus Common cancer accounting for
7,500 deaths/y in the UK. Most common in patients >60y. Overall, 4:5
85:1. Usually presents late when prognosis is poor. Two types:
• Squamous cell carcinoma (50%)—predominant form in upper
two-thirds of the oesophagus
• Adenocarcinoma (50%)—predominant in lower third of the
oesophagus. Incidence is increasing. 4:5 85:1
Common risk factors
Squamous cell carcinoma
• Smoking*
• Alcohol
• Low fruit/vegetable intake
*
Risk d to that of a non-smoker
10y after giving up

Adenocarcinoma
• Smoking*
• Obesity
• Low fruit/vegetable intake
• GORD—particularly Barrett’s
oesophagus (risk i >30x—the
longer the affected segment, the
higher the risk)

Other risk factors
• Previous mediastinal radiotherapy (i x2 for patients treated for breast
cancer; i x20 for patients treated for Hodgkin’s lymphoma)
• Plummer–Vinson (or Patterson–Kelly) syndrome—oesophageal web
and iron deficiency anaemia
• Tylosis—rare, inherited disorder with hyperkeratosis of the palms; 40%
develop oesophageal cancer
Presentation Short history of rapidly progressive dysphagia affecting solids
initially then solids and liquids ± weight loss ± regurgitation of food and
fluids (may be bloodstained). Retrosternal pain is a late feature. Other
symptoms include hoarseness and/or cough (due to aspiration or fistula
formation). Examination may be normal. Look for evidence of recent
weight loss, hepatomegaly, and cervical lymphadenopathy.
Management Refer for urgent endoscopy if suspected. Rapid access
dysphagia clinics are run in most areas. Specialist management involves
resection (treatment of choice but only 1:3 patients are suitable),
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and/or palliation with a stenting tube. Tubes
commonly become blocked. Good palliative care is essential—refer early
(b p. 1028). Overall 8% 5y survival.

Stomach cancer Stomach cancer causes 75,000 deaths/y in the UK;
95% are adenocarcinomas. Disease affecting older people, with 92%
diagnosed >55y; 4 > 5 (5:3). Incidence has more than halved over the
past 30y in the UK probably due to improved diet.
Other risk factors Include:
• Geography—common in Japan
• Blood group A
• H. pylori infection (not clear if
eradication d risk)
• Atrophic gastritis

•
•
•
•
•

Pernicious anaemia
Smoking
Adenomatous polyps
Social class
Previous partial gastrectomy

Gastro-oesophageal malignancy

Presentation Often non-specific. Presents with dyspepsia, weight d,
anorexia or early satiety, vomiting, dysphagia, anaemia, and/or GI bleeding.
Suspect in any patient >55y with recent onset dyspepsia (within 1y) and/or
other risk factors. Examination is usually normal until incurable. Look for
epigastric mass, hepatomegaly, jaundice, ascites, enlarged supraclavicular
LN (Virchow’s node), acanthosis nigricans.
Management If suspected, refer for urgent endoscopy. In early stages
total/partial gastrectomy may be curative. Most present at later stage.
Overall 5y survival is 15%.

Post-gastrectomy syndromes
Abdominal fullness A feeling of early satiety ± weight loss. Advise to take
small, frequent meals.
Bilious vomiting Affects 710% patients post-gastrectomy. Intermittent,
sudden attacks of bilious vomiting 15–30min after eating ± epigastric
cramping pain relieved by vomiting. Usually settles spontaneously.
Metoclopramide or domperidone may be helpful in the interim. If
symptoms are severe or fail to settle, request surgical review. Surgical bile
diversion or stomach reconstruction may alleviate symptoms.
Dumping Abdominal distension, colic, and vasomotor disturbance (e.g.
sweating, fainting) after meals. Affects 1–2% of gastrectomy patients (more
common early after surgery—most settle within 6mo). 2 types:
• Early dumping Due to rapid gastric emptying. Starts immediately
after a meal. Consists of: sweating, flushing, tachycardia, palpitations,
epigastric fullness, nausea. Occasionally there may be vomiting,
diarrhoea ± colicky abdominal pain. Advise: small, dry meals with
restricted carbohydrate. Take drinks between meals. If severe, re-refer
• Late dumping Due to rapid gastric emptying l hyperglycaemia. The
resultant hyperinsulinaemia causes a rebound hypoglycaemia. Starts
1–2h after meals. Consists of: faintness, sweating, tremor, and nausea.
Advise patients to d the sugar content of meals, rest for 1h after each
meal, and take glucose if symptoms occur. If severe, re-refer
Diarrhoea post-gastrectomy 50% of patients who have had a truncal
vagotomy or gastrectomy suffer some frequency of defecation; 5% require
treatment. The diarrhoea is typically episodic and unpredictable. The
exact mechanism is not clear. Treatment is with codeine phosphate or
loperamide prn. Antibiotic treatment is occasionally successful—seek
expert advice. Surgical measures are rarely necessary.
Anaemia Gastrectomy can result in both vitamin B12 deficiency and iron
deficiency anaemia. Prophylactic B12 injections may be advised by the
operating surgeon. Many advise iron supplements for life. An annual FBC
to monitor for anaemia is advisable. Treat with iron/B12 supplements.
Stomach cancer Risk of stomach cancer is i after partial gastrectomy
(2x after 20y, and 7x after 45y).

Hernias
Irreducible hernia

• Most types of hernia may become irreducible
• It may be the first presentation of a hernia or a complication of a
longstanding hernia
• If obstructed (incarcerated) or strangulated (blood supply to bowel
contained within the hernia sac is compromised) the hernia is tender
and there are symptoms/signs of small bowel obstruction
• If you are unable to reduce a hernia, admit for surgical assessment.

Inguinal hernia Protruberance of peritoneal contents through the
abdominal wall where it is weakened by the presence of the inguinal canal.
Common condition (4 > 5) which can occur at any age.
Presentation Lump in the groin ± discomfort on straining/standing for any
length of time. There may be a distinct precipitating event (e.g. heavy lifting).
Risk factors: chronic cough (e.g. COPD), constipation, urinary obstruction,
heavy lifting, ascites, previous abdominal surgery. 2 types:
• Indirect (80%) Follow the course of the spermatic cord or round
ligament down the inguinal canal through the internal inguinal ring
(located at the mid-point of the inguinal ligament, 1.5cm above the
femoral pulse), and sometimes out through the external inguinal ring
into the scrotum/vulva
• Direct (20%) Passes through a defect in the abdominal wall into the
inguinal canal. Rare in children and more common in the elderly
Differential diagnosis of groin lumps See Table 13.6.
Examination Examine the patient standing up. Look for a bulge in the
groin above the line of the inguinal ligament. Unless incarcerated the
lump should have a cough impulse. Check that you are able to reduce
the hernia—sometimes, it is easier if the patient lies down. Ask the patient
to reduce the hernia if you cannot.
Management Small hernias often require no treatment. For larger hernias
and smaller hernias that are symptomatic, consider referral for surgical repair.
Various methods are used—all have a high level of success (<2% recurrence).
Trusses can be useful for symptomatic hernias in elderly patients, those unfit
for surgery, or whilst awaiting surgery (prescribe on NHS prescription).
Inguinal hernias in children b p. 890

Femoral hernia Less common than inguinal hernia. 4 > 5. The patient

is usually elderly, although can occur at any age. Peritoneal contents
protrude down the femoral canal. Risk of strangulation is high. Presents as
a painful lump in the groin and/or small bowel obstruction.
Examination Rounded swelling medially in the groin and lateral to the
pubic tubercle; if reducible a soft palpable lump remains after reduction.
Management Always refer for urgent surgical repair. Admit as surgical
emergency if obstructed or irreducible.

Hernias

Incisional hernia Breakdown of the muscle closure in an abdominal
wound sometime after surgery. There may be a history of wound sepsis,
haematoma, or breakdown. Presents with a bulge at the site of the operation scar ± discomfort.
Examination The hernia is usually visible when the patient stands—it can
be made more obvious by asking the patient to cough or straight leg raise
whilst lying flat. The margins of the muscular defect are palpable under the
skin. Note whether fully reducible or not.
Management Often reassurance suffices. If obstructed/strangulated or
causing discomfort, then refer for surgical assessment.
Umbilical hernia Most common in infants (b p. 890). In adults
para-umbilical hernias, presenting as a bulge adjacent to the umbilicus, may
occur due to weakness in the linea alba. 5 > 4. Refer adults for surgical
assessment—usually repaired as risk of strangulation is high. Admit as a
surgical emergency if obstructed/irreducible.
Epigastric hernia Midline hernia through a defect in the linea alba
above the umbilicus. Never contains bowel. Usually symptomless, though
occasionally causes epigastric pain ± vomiting. Examination: epigastric mass
with cough impulse. Refer for surgical repair.
Spigelian hernia A hernial sac protrudes lateral to the rectus sheath
midway between the umbilicus and pubic bone. Presents with discomfort
± vomiting. Refer for surgical repair.
Obturator hernia Hernia protrudes out from the pelvis through the
obturator canal. Usually presents with strangulation ± pain referred to the
knee. Admit for surgery.
Richter hernia A knuckle of the side wall of the gut gets caught in a
hernia sac and becomes strangulated but the bowel is not obstructed.
Presents with abdominal pain which rapidly becomes worse ± shock.
Admit as for acute abdomen; diagnosis is usually made at surgery.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Appendicitis and small bowel disease
Acute appendicitis Most common surgical emergency in the UK.

Peak age: 10–30y. Presents with central abdominal colic that progresses
to localize in the right iliac fossa. Pain is worse on movement (especially
coughing, laughing) and associated with anorexia, nausea ± vomiting,
dysuria, constipation or rarely diarrhoea.
Assessment Watch for discomfort on walking (walk stooped). May be
flushed and unwell—pyrexial (737.5°C); furred tongue and/or foetor
oris; tenderness, rebound tenderness and guarding in the right iliac fossa
(especially over McBurney’s point—two-thirds of the distance between
the umbilicus and anterior superior iliac spine); pain in the right iliac fossa
on palpation of the left iliac fossa (Rovsing’s sign). Urinalysis is normal or
+ve for protein and/or leucocyte esterase but –ve for nitrites.
Differential diagnosis
• Urological cause, e.g. UTI, testicular torsion
• Mesenteric adenitis
• Gynaecological cause (e.g. pelvic
• Gastroenteritis
inflammatory disease; ectopic pregnancy)
• Meckel’s diverticulum
•	Non-abdominal cause, e.g. otitis media,
• Intussusception
diabetic ketoacidosis, pneumonia
• Crohn’s disease
Management Admit as a surgical emergency—expect to be wrong 750%
the time. Complications: generalized peritonitis s to perforation; appendix
abscess; appendix mass; subphrenic abscess; female infertility.
Subphrenic abscess Rarely follows 7–21d after generalized peritonitis—
particularly after acute appendicitis. Presents with general malaise, swinging
fever, nausea, and weight d ± pain in the upper abdomen radiating to
the shoulder tip. Breathlessness can be associated due to reactive pleural
effusion or lower lobe collapse. Examination: subcostal tenderness ± liver
enlargement. FBC—i WCC. If suspected admit for surgical assessment.

• Appendicitis in pregnancy Appendicitis affects 1:1,000 pregnan-

cies. Mortality is i and perforation more common (15–20%). Fetal mortality is 5–10% for simple appendicitis; 30% when there is perforation.
Due to the pregnancy, the appendix is displaced—pain is often felt in
the paraumbilical region or subcostally. Admit immediately if suspected.
	
Children with appendicitis Symptoms/signs of appendicitis may be atypical—especially in very young children—
as children localize pain poorly and signs of peritonitis can
be difficult to elicit.
• If unsure of diagnosis and the child is unwell, admit
• If unsure of diagnosis and the child is well, either arrange to review
a few hours later, or ask the carer to contact you if there is any
deterioration, or change in symptoms
Mesenteric adentitis Inflammation of the mesenteric LNs, causing
abdominal pain in children. May follow URTI. Can mimic appendicitis.
Check MSU to exclude UTI. If guarding/rebound tenderness, refer for
acute surgical assessment. Settles spontaneously with simple analgesia
and fluids. If not settling in 1–2wk refer for paediatric assessment.

Appendicitis and small bowel disease

Meckel’s diverticulum Remnant of the attachment of the small

bowel to the embryological yolk sac. It is 2 inches (75cm) long, 72ft (60cm)
proximal to the appendix and present in 2% of the population. A Meckel’s
diverticulum may not cause any problems or cause an appendicitis-like
picture; acute intestinal obstruction, or GI bleeding. Symptoms can occur
at any age but are most common in children.
J.F. Meckel (1781–1833)—German anatomist.

Intussusception b p. 891 Coeliac disease b p. 412
Crohn’s disease b p. 414 Obstruction and ischaemia b p. 400
Adhesions Arise as a result of intra-abdominal inflammation. Bowel loops
become adherent to each other, omentum, mesentery, and the abdominal
wall. Fibrous bands may form connecting adjacent structures. Presents
with abdominal pain ± obstruction. Causes: surgery; intra-abdominal sepsis
(e.g. appendicitis, cholecystitis; salpingitis); inflammatory bowel disease;
endometriosis. Refer to a surgeon. Treatment is difficult, as any surgery
may result in new adhesions; conservative management with analgesia
and stool softeners is preferred. Laparoscopic, or rarely open division of
adhesions is occasionally necessary.
Intestinal non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma The majority of intestinal NHLs

are B-cell type lymphomas, but coeliac disease is associated with T-cell intestinal
lymphoma. Abdominal symptoms: non-specific abdominal pain (70–80%);
perforation (up to 25%); bowel obstruction; abdominal mass; intussusception;
malabsorption (usually lymphoma associated with coeliac disease), or alteration
in bowel habit (small intestine NHL may present like Crohn’s disease).
Systemic symptoms: weight d (30%), fatigue, sweats, unexplained fevers.
0 Lymphadenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly are usually absent.
Management (b p. 680) Gastric lymphoma may remit with treatment
of H. pylori infection.

Carcinoid tumours Slow-growing tumours of low malignancy, which
arise from neuroendocrine cells or their precursors. Incidence: 3–4/100,000.
Peak age: 61y. 5 > 4. 60% are in the midgut (especially appendix and terminal ileum). Examination may reveal an abdominal mass and/or enlarged
liver. Rarely presents with bowel obstruction. Ileal carcinoids are multiple
in 30%. Non-intestinal sites: lung, testes, and ovary.
Carcinoid syndrome Affects <10% of patients with a carcinoid tumour.
Develops when serotonin (5HT) is released by the tumour and not
degraded by the liver due to hepatic metastases. Features:
• Paroxysmal flushing, e.g. following alcohol or certain foods
• Watery, explosive diarrhoea
• Bronchoconstriction (like asthma)
• Abdominal pain
• Right heart failure
• Rash—symmetrical, pruritic erythematous rash which blisters/crusts
Management Refer for urgent assessment if suspected. Therapeutic
options include surgery, somatostatin analogues such as octreotide, or
radiofrequency ablation of liver metastases. Prognosis—if no metastases,
median survival is 5–8y; with metastases median survival is 38mo.

Colorectal cancer screening
Screening for colorectal cancer is available throughout the UK. Patients
presenting with tumour confined to the bowel wall have >90% long-term
survival. Without screening, most tumours are detected at advanced
stages and overall 5y survival is 850%. Screening aims to detect colorectal
cancer at an early stage to i survival chances.
Screening test Faecal occult blood (FOB) test kits are sent every 2y
to all patients aged 60–74y with instructions for completion/return. The
test kit has 3 flaps, each with 2 windows underneath. 2 samples are taken
from a bowel motion and spread onto the 2 windows under the first
flap using the cardboard sticks provided. The flap is then sealed and the
process repeated using the remaining 2 flaps for the subsequent 2 bowel
motions. Once all 6 windows have been used, the kit is returned. Kits must
be returned <14d after the first sample is taken. Results are sent to the
patients in <2wk.

Screening outcomes (See Tables 13.7 and 13.8) If 60% of those aged
60–69y do the FOB test, 1,200 deaths will be prevented each year in the UK.

Family history If a patient has one first-degree relative (mother, father,

sister, brother, daughter, or son) with colorectal cancer, risk of developing
colorectal cancer is i 2–3x.
Refer for colonoscopy At presentation or aged 35–40y (whichever is
later), and repeat colonoscopy aged 55y if:
• 2x first-degree relatives with a history of colorectal cancer, or
• 1x first-degree relative with a history of colorectal cancer aged <45y
Refer for specialist follow-up and genetic counselling if:
• >2x first-degree relatives with a history of colorectal cancer, or
• Family history of:
• Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)—usually develop cancer
aged <40y. Lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 1:2.5
• Juvenile polyposis—lifetime risk of colorectal cancer is 1:3
• Peutz–Jegher syndrome—autosomal dominant disorder. Benign
intestinal (usually small intestine) polyps in association with dark
freckles on lips, oral mucosa, face, palm and soles. May cause GI
obstruction or GI bleeding. Malignant change occurs in 73%
• Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer—≥3 family members
with colorectal cancer where ≥2 generations have been affected
and ≥1 affected family member developed the disease <50y of age;
40% lifetime risk of colorectal cancer
• MMR (mismatch repair) oncogene
Ulcerative colitis i risk of colorectal cancer. Offer all patients a
follow-up plan agreed with their specialist. In some cases, prophylactic
colectomy is appropriate.
Previous colorectal cancer i risk of developing a second colorectal
primary. After successful treatment, younger patients are routinely
followed up with colonoscopy every 5y until 70y. Remain vigilant for
recurrences, and re-refer urgently if suspected.

Colorectal cancer
Lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is 1:15 for 5 and 1:19 for 4.
Colorectal cancer accounts for 14% of all cancers and 16,000 deaths/y in
the UK. Two-thirds arise in the colon and a third in the rectum; 72% of
tumours occur in patients >65y and >95% are adenocarcinomas.
Adenomatous polyps Bowel cancers arise from polyps over many
years. Polyps may be removed because of risk of malignant change.
Follow-up surveillance with repeated colonoscopy may be necessary
depending on the number of polyps and their size (b p. 397).

Protective and risk factors
Lifestyle factors
• Obesity—i risk by 15% if overweight and 30% if obese
• Dietary factors—diets with less red and processed meat, and more
vegetables, fibre, fish, and milk are associated with d risk (diet is
thought to explain geographic variations)
• Alcohol—i risk for heavy drinkers, especially if also low folate
• Physical activity—i physical activity can d risk by 30%
Medication history
• HRT—risk d by 20% if ever taken; d by 30% if taking HRT currently
• COC pill—risk d by 18% if ever taken
• Statins—risk is d after 5y use
• Aspirin—75mg od taken for >5y d risk by 40%
Other medical history
• History of gall bladder disease and/or cholecystectomy—50% i in risk
• Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes—30% i risk
• UC or Crohn’s disease—i risk (b p. 414)
Family history b p. 396

Bowel cancer screening b p. 396
Presentation May be found at bowel cancer screening. Clinical
presentations depends on site involved:
• Change in bowel habit: diarrhoea ± mucus, constipation or alternating
diarrhoea and constipation, tenesmus
• Intestinal obstruction: pain, distension, absolute constipation ±
vomiting. May be an acute, sudden event (20% of patients not detected
by screening present with an acute obstruction) or gradually evolve
• Rectal bleeding: bright red rectal bleeding or +ve faecal occult blood
test—60% rectal tumours. Rarely melaena if high tumour
• Perforation: causing generalized peritonitis or into an adjacent viscus
(e.g. bladder), resulting in a fistula
• Spread: abdominal distension s to ascites, jaundice, rectal/pelvic pain
• General effects: weight d, anorexia, anaemia, malaise

Examination and investigation
• General examination—cachexia, jaundice, anaemia (check FBC)
• Abdominal mass
• Hepatomegaly
• Ascites
• Rectal examination—detects >75% of rectal tumours

Colorectal cancer

Suspicious lower GI symptoms and signs Refer urgently (to be
seen in <2wk) to a team specializing in lower GI malignancy.
Any age with:
• Right lower abdominal mass consistent with involvement of
large bowel
• A palpable rectal mass (intraluminal, not pelvic; a pelvic mass outside
the bowel would warrant an urgent referral to a urologist)
• Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (Hb ≤11g/dL for 4; ≤10g/dL for
a non-menstruating 5)
Aged �40y Reporting rectal bleeding with a change of bowel habit
towards looser stools and/or i stool frequency persisting ≥6wk.
Aged �60y with:
• Rectal bleeding persisting for ≥6wk without a change in bowel habit
and without anal symptoms
• Change in bowel habit to looser stools and/or more frequent stools
persisting for ≥6wk without rectal bleeding
0 In a patient with equivocal symptoms who is not unduly anxious, it is
reasonable to ‘treat, watch, and wait’.

Specialist management Confirmation of diagnosis with sigmoidoscopy/

colonoscopy and/or CT colonography. If diagnosis is confirmed further
investigations include LFTs, tumour markers (carcino-embryonic antigen
or CEA is produced in >80% advanced tumours), CXR, CT/MRI, and USS
to evaluate spread.

Treatment Laparoscopic or open surgical resection when possible.

Staging based on findings at surgery dictates further management with
chemotherapy. For patients with more advanced disease, resection or
radioablation of hepatic metastases may be an option.
Adverse pathological features
• Presence/number of involved LNs
• Lymphovascular, perineural,
or venous invasion
• Depth of bowel wall penetration
• Positive resection margin
• Mucinous histology

Adverse clinical features
• Emergency presentation
with bowel obstruction or
perforation
• Incomplete resection
• Metastatic disease
• Presentation aged <50y

Gastrointestinal medicine

Other large bowel conditions
Intestinal obstruction Blockage of the bowel due to either mechanical
obstruction or failure of peristalsis (ileus). Causes:
• Obstruction from outside the bowel Adhesions/bands; volvulus;
obstructed hernia (b p. 392); neighbouring malignancy (e.g. bladder)
• Obstruction from within the bowel wall Tumour; infarction;
congenital atresia; Hirschprung’s disease; inflammatory bowel disease
(b p. 414); diverticulitis
• Obstruction in the lumen Impacted faeces/constipation (b p. 378);
bolus obstruction (e.g. swallowed foreign body); gallstone ileus;
intussusception; large polyps
• Ileus/functional obstruction Post-op; electrolyte disturbance; uraemia;
DM; back pain; anticholinergic drugs
Presentation Anorexia; nausea; vomiting (may be faeculent) gives relief;
colicky central abdominal pain and distension; absolute constipation
for stool and gas (though if high obstruction constipation may not be
absolute). Examination: uncomfortable and restless; abdominal distension
± tenderness (though no guarding/rebound); active tinkling bowel sounds
or quiet/absent bowel sounds (later).
Management Admit as surgical emergency.
Diverticulosis Common condition of the colon associated with muscle
hypertrophy and i intraluminal pressure. Mucosa-lined pouches are pushed
out through the colonic wall usually at the entry points of vessels. These
pouches are the diverticula; 95% are in the sigmoid colon although they
may occur anywhere in the bowel. They are present in >1:3 people >60y in
the UK. Risk factors include low-roughage diet and age. Diverticular disease
implies the diverticula are symptomatic—see Table 13.9.
Ischaemic bowel Interruption of the blood supply of the bowel.
• 1° ischaemia: usually due to either mesenteric embolus from the right
side of the heart, or venous thrombosis and typically occurs in elderly
patients who might have pre-existing heart or vascular disease
• 2° ischaemia: usually due to intestinal obstruction (e.g. strangulated
hernia, volvulus, intussusception)
Presentation Sudden onset of abdominal pain which rapidly becomes
severe. There may be a prior history of pain worse after meals (mesenteric
angina). Rarely presents with PR bleeding. Examination: very unwell;
shocked; may be in AF; generalized tenderness but normally no guarding/
rebound. Often signs are out of proportion to symptoms.
Management Give opioid analgesia. Admit as surgical emergency.
Sigmoid volvulus Occurs in people who have redundant colon on a long
mesentery with a narrow base. The sigmoid loop twists, causing intestinal
obstruction. The loop may become ischaemic. Risk factors: constipation,
laxatives, tranquillizers. Presents with acute onset of abdominal distension
and colicky abdominal pain with complete constipation and absence of
flatus. There may be a history of repeated attacks.
Management Admit acutely to hospital. Treatment is release by passing
a flatus tube and/or surgery. Once treated, d recurrences by preventing
constipation and stopping tranquillizers if possible.

Other large bowel conditions

Hirschprung’s disease Caused by absence of the ganglion cells of the myenteric plexus in the distal bowel.
Presents with delay in passing meconium, abdominal distension, vomiting, and poor feeding in a neonate. If only a short
segment is affected, presentation may be much later with chronic constipation. Diagnosis is confirmed with rectal biopsy. Refer to surgery.
Treatment is surgical removal of the affected area of bowel.

Gastrointestinal medicine

Anal and perianal problems
Haemorrhoids (‘piles’) Common in all age groups from mid-teens
onwards. Represent distension of the submuscosal plexus of veins in the
anus. Three main groups situated at 3, 7, and 11 o’clock positions (relative
to the patient viewed in lithotomy position). Risk factors: constipation;
FH; varicose veins; pregnancy; i anal tone (cause not understood); pelvic
tumour; portal hypertension. Classification:
• 1st degree Piles remain within the anal canal
• 2nd degree Prolapse out of anal verge but spontaneously reduce
• 3rd degree Prolapse out of anus and require digital reduction
• 4th degree Permanently prolapsed
Presentation Discomfort or discharge ± fresh red rectal bleeding (blood
on toilet paper, coating stool, or dripping into pan after defecation);
feeling of incomplete emptying of the rectum; mucus discharge; pruritus
ani. Rectal examination: prolapsing piles are obvious, 1st degree piles are
not visible or palpable.
Management If piles are not obvious on examination, arrange
proctoscopy ± sigmoidoscopy for all patients >40y. Treatment: soften stool
(bran, ispaghula husk) and recommend topical analgesia (e.g. lidocaine 5%
ointment or OTC preparation). If not responding to treatment, uncertainty
over diagnosis, or severe symptoms (e.g. soiling of underwear), refer for
surgical assessment. Complications:
• Strangulation Circulation to the pile is obstructed by the anal
sphincter. Results in intense pain + anal sphincter spasm. Treat with
analgesia. If severe pain or symptoms are not settling, admit
• Thrombosis Pain/anal sphincter spasm—analgesia, ice packs, and bed
rest; consider referral for surgery to prevent recurrence
Perianal haematoma (thrombosed external pile) Due to a
ruptured superficial perianal vein causing a subcutaneous haematoma.
Presents with sudden onset of severe perianal pain. A tender, 2–4mm
‘dark blueberry’ under the skin adjacent to the anus is visible. Give
analgesia. Settles spontaneously over 71wk. If <1d old can be evacuated
via a small incision under LA.
Rectal prolapse Occurs in 2 age groups—the very young and those
>60y. Presents with mass coming down through the anus ± anal discharge.
In adults there are 2 types:
• Mucosal Adults with 3rd degree piles—bowel musculature remains in
position but redundant mucosa prolapses from the anal canal
• Complete Descent of the upper rectum into the lower anal canal.
Usually due to weak pelvic floor from childbirth. Bowel wall is inverted
and passed out through the anus. May be associated uterine prolapse
Refer for surgery. A supporting ring may be used if unfit for surgery.
Anal fissure The anal mucosa is torn—usually on the posterior aspect of
the anal canal. May occur at any age. Presents with pain on defecation ±
constipation ± fresh rectal bleeding (‘blood on toilet paper’). The fissure is
often visible as is a ‘sentinel pile’ (bunched up mucosa at the base of the tear).
Rectal examination is very tender due to muscle spasm.

Anal and perianal problems

Management Soften stool (e.g. ispaghula husk); try analgesic suppositories
(e.g. 5% lidocaine ointment; OTC haemorrhoid preparations). If
unsuccessful add glyceryl trinitrate 0.4% ointment bd which relieves pain
and spasm but may cause headache; 2% topical diltiazem cream bd is a
third-line option (unlicensed). If interventions fail refer to surgeon.
Perianal abscess Usually caused by infection arising in a perianal gland.
Tends to lie between the internal and external sphincters and points
towards the skin at the anal margin. May affect patients of any age and
presents with gradual onset of perianal pain which becomes throbbing
and severe; defecation and sitting are painful—characteristically patients
sit with one buttock raised off the chair. Examination: abscess in the skin
next to the anus. Refer as an acute surgical emergency for drainage.

Perianal fistula Abnormal connection between the lumen of the anus

(or rectum) and skin. Usually develops from a perianal abscess. Fistulae are
either ‘high’ (open into the bowel above the deep external anal sphincter)
or ‘low’ (open into the bowel below this point). High fistulae are rare and
usually due to UC, Crohn’s disease, or tumour—they are more complex
to repair. Presents with persistent perianal discharge and/or recurrent
abscess. The external opening is usually visible lateral to the anus; the
internal opening may be palpable on rectal examination. Refer for surgical
repair.
Pilonidal sinus Obstruction of a hair follicle in the natal cleft. The
ingrowing hair triggers a foreign body reaction l pain, swelling, abscess,
and/or fistula formation ± foul-smelling discharge. Refer for surgery.
Pruritus ani Itching around the anus. Occurs if the anus is moist or
soiled, e.g. poor personal hygiene; anal leakage or faecal incontinence;
fissures; nylon/tight underwear. Other causes: dermatological conditions
(e.g. contact dermatitis, lichen sclerosus); threadworm infection; anxiety;
other causes of generalized pruritus (b p. 594). Treat cause if possible;
avoid spicy food; moist wipe post-defecation.

Anal ulcers Rare. Consider Crohn’s disease, syphilis, tumour.
Threadworm Common in the UK—especially in children.
Enterobius vermicularis causes anal itch, as it leaves the bowel
to lay eggs on the perineum. Often seen as silvery thread-like
worms at the anus of children. Treatment: mebendazole
(available OTC). Treat household contacts as well as the index case.
Anal cancer Usually squamous cell cancer (>50%). Risk factors: anal
sex; syphilis; anal warts (HPV). Presents with bleeding, pain, anal mass or
ulcer, pruritus, stricture, change in bowel habit. A mass may be palpable
on rectal examination. Check for inguinal LNs.
Management Refer for urgent surgical review and confirmation of
diagnosis. Treatment is usually with a combination of radiotherapy ±
chemotherapy. Abdominoperineal resection is reserved for salvage
therapy after chemo- or radiotherapy failure.

Patients with ostomies
0 Specialist stoma nurses are an extremely useful source of advice and
help. If in doubt about the correct stoma appliances and accessories to
supply or a patient has a problem with a stoma, wherever possible liaise
with your local specialist stoma nurse.
The first iatrogenic stoma was constructed in France in 1776 for an
obstructing rectal cancer. Stomas (from the Greek meaning ‘mouth’) may
be temporary or permanent (see Table 13.10).
Stoma retraction can l leakage and severe skin problems. Most
common reason for re-operation. Refer for specialist advice.

Prolapse Seen most frequently with loop colostomy. If persists and
disrupts pouching, refer for consideration of revision.

Peristomal hernia Common complication. Symptomatic cases require

referral for repair.

Stenosis Narrowing of the stoma may result in difficulty or pain passing
stool and/or obstruction. If problematic refer for revision.
Skin complications Skin irritation can be due to:
•
•
•
•

Leakage onto the skin
Allergic reactions to the adhesive material in a skin barrier
Fungal infection, or
Inadequate hygiene

Prevention of skin complications
• Advise patients to clean, rinse, and pat the skin dry between pouch
changes
• Avoid using an oily soap, which can leave a film that interferes with
proper adhesion of the skin barrier
• Ensure the pouch system fits
• Treat any infection with oral antibiotics and/or oral or topical antifungals
• Apply skin barrier cream
• If the skin is uneven (e.g. due to scarring), fill irregularities with stoma
paste to give a better fit
• Consider the use of convex discs or stoma belts (refer to specialist
stoma nurse for advice)
Drugs Enteric-coated and modified-release preparations are unsuitable
for people with bowel stomas—particularly for patients with ileostomy.

Diet
• Avoid foods that cause intestinal upset or diarrhoea
• For descending/sigmoid colostomy, avoid foods that cause constipation.
If constipation does occur, i fluid intake and/or dietary fibre
• Certain foods, e.g. beans, cucumbers, and carbonated drinks, can
cause gas, along with certain habits such as talking or swallowing
air while eating, using a straw, breathing through the mouth, and
chewing gum

Patients with ostomies

• A daily portion of apple sauce, cranberry juice, yogurt, or buttermilk
can help control odour. If odour is strong and persistent, consider use
of charcoal filters or pouch deodorizers (seek advice from a specialist
stoma nurse)

Psychosocial problems Self-help groups provide information and tips
on lifestyle and stoma care; specialist stoma nurses can provide support
and counselling.

Activities Advise patients to avoid rough contact sports and heavy

lifting as these might l herniation around the stoma. Patients with stomas
may swim. Water will not enter a stoma due to peristalsis so stomas do
not need to be covered when bathing. A body belt (available on FP10) to
hold the stoma bag in place against the body may stop rustling/leakage for
those doing aerobic exercise—seek advice from a specialist stoma nurse.

Travel Advise patients to pack sufficient supplies of their stoma
products and carry supplies with them in case baggage is misplaced. Avoid
storing supplies in a very hot environment as heat may damage pouches.

Chronic diarrhoea and
malabsorption
Chronic diarrhoea Diarrhoea persisting >4wk. Patients’ perceptions
of diarrhoea vary widely. Clarify what is meant. Chronic diarrhoea affects
74–5% of adults in the UK. There are many causes (see Table 13.11), and all
patients require investigation. Careful history is vital.
Symptoms suggestive of organic disease
• History of <3mo duration
• Mainly nocturnal or continuous (as opposed to intermittent) diarrhoea
• Significant weight d
• Liquid stools with blood and/or mucus
Symptoms suggestive of malabsorption
• Pale and/or offensive stools
• Steatorrhoea—excess fat in faeces. The stool is pale-coloured and
foul-smelling and floats (‘difficult to flush’)
Examination and investigation Full examination. Look for signs of
systemic disease and examine abdomen thoroughly. Check:
• Blood: FBC, ESR, Ca2+, LFTs, haematinics, TFTs, coeliac serology
• Stool: M,C&S
Management
• If obvious identifiable cause, e.g. GI infection, constipation, drug side
effect, then treat and review. Refer to gastroenterology if treatment
does not relieve symptoms
• If symptoms suggestive of functional bowel disease and <45y with
normal investigations, irritable bowel syndrome is likely. Reassure,
offer advice, and review as necessary. Refer to gastroenterology if
atypical symptoms appear or the patient is unhappy with the diagnosis
• Otherwise refer to gastroenterology for assessment. Speed of referral
depends on age and severity of symptoms
• Refer urgently to a team specializing in lower GI malignancy if:
Any age with:
• Right lower abdominal mass consistent with involvement of large bowel
• A palpable rectal mass (intraluminal, not pelvic; a pelvic mass outside
the bowel would warrant an urgent referral to a urologist)
• Unexplained iron deficiency anaemia (Hb ≤11g/dL for 4; ≤10g/dL for
a non-menstruating 5)
Aged ≥40y Reporting rectal bleeding with a change of bowel habit
towards looser stools and/or increased stool frequency persisting ≥6wk.
Aged ≥60y with:
• Rectal bleeding persisting for ≥6wk without a change in bowel habit
and without anal symptoms
• Change in bowel habit to looser stools and/or more frequent stools
persisting for ≥6 wk without rectal bleeding
0 In a patient with equivocal symptoms who is not unduly anxious, it is
reasonable to ‘treat, watch and wait’.

• Following gastric surgery
• Biliary insufficiency
Whipple’s disease A cause of malabsorption which usually occurs in 4
>50 y. Other features: arthralgia, pigmentation, weight d, lymphadenopathy,
± cerebellar or cardiac signs. Cause: Tropheryma whippelii. Refer for
gastroenterology assessment. Jejunal biopsy is characteristic. Treatment:
long-term broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Malabsorption in children b p. 888
Factitious diarrhoea Responsible for 4% referrals to gastroen­terology

departments and 20% of tertiary referrals. Due to laxative abuse or
adding of water or urine to stool samples. Difficult to spot—have a high
index of suspicion especially in patients with history of eating disorder or
somatization.

Faecal incontinence
Affects 72% of all ages, causing great personal disability. It is a common
reason for carers to request placement in a nursing home.

Causes
• Age and frailty
• Constipation (overflow
incontinence)
• Childbirth
• Colonic resection/anal surgery
• Rectal prolapse/haemorrhoids
• Loose stools or diarrhoea from
any cause, e.g. inflammatory
bowel disease

• After radiotherapy
• Systemic sclerosis
•	Neurological disorders
• Cognitive deficit
• Congenital disorders (e.g. anal
atresia, Hirschprung’s disease)
• Emotional problems, e.g.
encoparesis in children

History Aimed at establishing the underlying causes of the incontinence
(may be >1) and other factors that might be contributing to it. Ask about:
• Onset and nature of symptoms 0 Always consider faecal
incontinence when patients present with anal soreness and/or itching
• Bowel habit including timing and frequency of incontinence
• Difficulties with toileting and help available
• Other medical conditions
• Diet
• Medication
• Social circumstances
• Persistent change in bowel habit to looser stools may be a sign of GI
malignancy—b p. 399.

Examination General and rectal examination (to detect abnormalities
of anal tone, local anal pathology, e.g. rectal prolapse, and constipation
causing overflow incontinence). Further examination depends on age
group and history, e.g. cognitive assessment if suspected cognitive deficit;
neurological examination if d anal tone.
Primary care management
Treatment of cause
• Clear any constipation/faecal loading (b p. 378)—use rectal
preparations initially to clear faecal load. If unsuccessful/rectal
preparations are inappropriate, then switch to oral laxatives. Take
steps to prevent recurrence, e.g. add fibre to diet, i fluid intake,
consider regular laxatives
• Treat other reversible causes, e.g. infective diarrhoea, UC
• Consider alternatives to any contributing medications, e.g. tranquillizers
General measures where cause cannot be treated
• Advise fluid intake of at least 1.5L/d
• Encourage bowel emptying after a meal—advise patients to assume a
seated/squatting position and not to strain
• Ensure that toilet facilities are private, accessible, and safe—refer for
OT assessment if needed

Faecal incontinence

• Manipulate diet to promote optimal stool consistency and predictable
bowel emptying. A food/fluid diary may be helpful. Only change one
food at a time. Consider referral to a dietician
• If stool must be in the rectum at a set time (e.g. when a carer is there),
manipulate bowel action with pr/po laxatives and/or loperamide
• If loose stools, consider treatment with loperamide, co-phenotrope,
or codeine phosphate, prn or continuously. When using loperamide,
introduce at a very low dose (consider syrup for doses <2mg) and i
dose until desired stool consistency is reached. Dose and/or frequency
can be adjusted i or d in response to stool consistency and lifestyle
0 Do not use if hard stools, undiagnosed diarrhoea, or flare-up of UC
• Review regularly. If no improvement with simple strategies, consider
referral for specialist care
Patients with faecal incontinence from enteral feeding Discuss with the
patient’s dietician. Modifying type/timing of feeds may help.
Patients with spinal injury or disease Bowel function is a reflex action
which we learn to override as children. If the lesion is above the level
of this reflex pathway (T12 for bowel function) then automatic emptying
will still occur when the bladder or bowel is full, although there is no
control. If the lesion is below this level there is no emptying reflex. Bowel
care programmes reflect this. Useful leaflets are available from the spinal
injuries association (F 0800 980 0501 M www.spinal.co.uk).

Referral Consider if symptoms are not controlled:
• To continence adviser—for advice on skin care/hygiene and supplies
of incontinence pads. Pelvic floor muscle training, bowel retraining,
biofeedback, electrical stimulation, and/or rectal irrigation may be useful.
Devices e.g. anal plugs or faecal collectors can help in some situations
• To surgeon—for sphincter repair if significant sphincter defect;
for consideration of implanted sacral nerve stimulation device; for
appendicostomy/continent colonic conduit for anterograde irrigation in
patients with colonic motility disorders; for stoma formation (last resort)
• To old age psychiatry—if cognitive deficit and incontinence
• To paediatrics—if encoparesis due to chronic constipation, or child
psychiatry if encoparesis due to emotional distress

Gastroenteritis and food poisoning
Ingestion of viruses, bacteria, or their toxins commonly causes diarrhoea
and/or vomiting (see Table 13.12). 0 Suspected food poisoning is a
­notifiable disease.
Prevention Handwashing after using the toilet; longer cooking and
rewarming times; prompt consumption of food.

Presentation
• History Severity and duration of symptoms, food eaten and water
drunk, time relationship between ingestion and symptoms, other
affected contacts, recent foreign travel
• Examination Usually normal. Dehydration may prompt admission
Investigation and management See Vomiting and diarrhoea—b
p. 376. Advise fluid replacement. Only give antibiotics if recommended
following stool culture (exception is Giardia diarrhoea—b p. 649).
Campylobacter Most common bacterial cause of infectious diarrhoea
in the UK. Two species (C. jejuni and C. coli) are responsible for most cases.
Symptoms occur 2–5d after ingestion of infected food (usually milk or
poultry). Malaise followed by abdominal pain and diarrhoea—often bloody.
Rarely associated with arthritis. Usually clears spontaneously. If needed,
treatment is with erythromycin or ciprofloxacin.
Salmonella Common cause of infectious diarrhoea. Usually ingested in
infected meat, poultry, or eggs. Symptoms: vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal
pain, and fever—develop from 12h–2d after ingestion. Rarely associated
with arthritis 2–3 wk after acute infection. In <1%, a carrier state develops.
Only use antibiotics on microbiologist advice.
Escherichia coli Many different strains of E. coli cause diarrhoea via a
variety of mechanisms. In most cases, treatment is supportive with fluid
replacement. Rarely, for enterohaemorrhagic strains, antibiotics may be
recommended, but use is controversial, as antibiotic treatment has been
linked with haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
Cryptosporidium Protozoan causing diarrhoeal disease. Infections
are usually spread in water. Responsible for 75% of all gastroenteritis
in both industrialized and developing countries. Presents with profuse
watery diarrhoea, abdominal cramp ± nausea, anorexia, fever, and malaise.
Treatment is supportive. Usually symptoms last 1–2wk (rarely >1mo).
Immunocompromised patients develop profuse intractable diarrhoea which
is difficult to clear and may continue intermittently for life.
Norovirus (‘winter vomiting virus’) Most common cause of
infectious gastroenteritis in the UK—particularly in communal settings, e.g.
schools, hospitals. Illness is generally mild and lasts 2–3d. There are no
long-term effects. Infections can occur at any age because immunity is not
long-lasting. Scrupulous hygiene is needed to contain outbreaks.

Coeliac disease
Gluten sensitivity results in inflammation of the bowel and malabsorption.
Coeliac disease is a common disorder (UK prevalence 0.5–1%, 5:4 83:1)
although only a minority have recognized disease. Peak incidence in adults
is in the fifth decade; in children at 74y. Associated with HLA-DQ2 or
DQ8; first-degree relatives have a 1:10 chance of being affected.

Investigation
• Serological testing With IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase antibodies
(TTG) or anti-endomysial antibodies (EMA) if any symptoms/signs
listed in Table 13.13. Consider testing if associated condition or
genetic predisposition. 0 Test only if the patient has eaten >1 meal/d
containing gluten for ≥6wk
• Other tests Also consider FBC, ESR/CRP, B12, folate, ferritin, LFTs,
Ca2+, TFTs, and stool sample for M,C&S (if diarrhoea)
• Selective IgA deficiency is more common amongst people with coeliac disease (2.6%) than the general population (0.4%). People who are
IgA-deficient have false –ve results with IgA TTG/EMA testing. When
there is strong clinical suspicion and coeliac serology is negative, check
serum IgA levels; if deficient, request IgG TTG/EMA antibody testing.

Initial management Refer for specialist review if:
• +ve serology—duodenal biopsy showing villous atrophy is diagnostic
• Strong clinical suspicion of coeliac disease but –ve serology
• Unwilling to reintroduce gluten to diet to enable serological testing
Gluten-free diet Is the cornerstone of the management of coeliac
disease and should be followed life-long. Patients should avoid proteins
derived from wheat, rye, or barley. X Avoidance of oats is controversial.
Refer to a dietician for specialist advice. Coeliac UK provides a directory
of approved products as well as recipes for those on gluten-free diets.
Prescriptions for gluten-free foods Prescribe adequate gluten-free foods
(see Table 13.14), marking prescriptions ‘ACBS’. Add deficient nutrients,
e.g. iron, folic acid, calcium until established on a gluten-free diet.
Failure to respond to diet The most common reason is continued
ingestion of gluten (intentional or inadvertent). Re-refer to dieticians. If
symptoms recur after a period of remission, re-refer for specialist review.

Pneumococcal

vaccination Pneumococcal

Follow-up Every 6–12mo in a specialist clinic or by a GP under shared

care arrangements. Routine checks include: symptoms, weight, and blood
tests (Hb, B12, folate, iron, albumin, Ca2+, TTG or EMA antibodies).

Long-term complications Are almost eliminated by strict diet:
• Osteoporosis—consider DEXA scan at diagnosis, after 3y on a
gluten-free diet (if abnormal baseline DEXA), at menopause for 5,
aged 55y for 4, or if fragility fractureG
• Malignancy—lymphoma or carcinoma of the small intestine. Rare—if
suspected, refer urgently for specialist review

Gastrointestinal medicine

Inflammatory bowel disease
Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (B.B. Crohn (1884–1983)—
US gastroenterologist) are collectively termed inflammatory bowel
disease. Both are chronic, relapsing-remitting diseases characterized by
acute, non-infectious inflammation of the gut. In UC, inflammation is
limited to the colorectal mucosa. Extent varies from disease limited to
the rectum (proctitis) to disease affecting the whole colon (pancolitis).
In Crohn’s, any part of the gut from mouth to anus can be affected with
normal bowel between affected areas (skip lesions).
Cause Unknown. Both diseases are thought to result from an
environmental trigger on genetically susceptible individuals. Factors
implicated (none proven) include:
• Smoking—protective against UC (95% are non-smokers or
ex-smokers) but a causative factor in Crohn’s disease (two-thirds are
smokers, and smoking cessation halves the relapse rate)
• Gut flora or other infections, e.g. Mycobacterium paratuberculosis
• Food constituents

Features See Table 13.16.
Differential diagnosis
• Colonic tumour
Irritable bowel syndrome
• Food sensitive colitis (infants)
Coeliac disease
• Pseudomembranous colitis
Anal fissure
• Ischaemic colitis
Gut infection, e.g. giardiasis
• Microscopic colitis
Diverticulitis
Suspected diagnosis 750% of severe attacks of UC are first attacks
in patients who do not have a prior diagnosis. If bloody diarrhoea +
fever >37.5oC or tachycardia >90bpm, admit as an acute emergency.
If persistent, unexplained diarrhoea lasting >4wk and/or persistent
abdominal pain, refer for urgent further investigation to exclude GI
malignancy and establish diagnosis.

sclerosing cholangitis (UC > Crohn’s)
Miscellaneous—thromboembolism, osteoporosis (Crohn’s);
amyloidosis (Crohn’s)

Examination

Abdominal + rectal examination—abdominal tenderness. Anal
and perianal lesions (pendulous skin tags, abscesses, fistulae)
and/or mass in the right iliac fossa are characteristic of Crohn’s
disease
General examination—clubbing, aphthous ulcers in the mouth
(Crohn’s), signs of weight loss, anaemia, or hypoproteinaemia

Investigation

Blood: FBC (anaemia, i WCC), ESR (i when disease is active),
eGFR, LFTs (including serum albumin). In severe UC, CRP >45g/dL
after 3d steroid treatment indicates high (785%) risk for colectomy.
Stool: M,C&S (including C. difficile) to exclude infection
AXR: consider to clarify extent of disease, exclude toxic megacolon
(transverse colon diameter >5cm) or bowel obstruction, and/or
identify proximal constipation
Proctoscopy: inflammation and shallow ulceration extending
proximally from the anal margin suggests UC

UC and Crohn’s disease are rare in childhood. Presentation is
variable and can be with non-specific features (e.g. failure to
thrive), GI symptoms (e.g. malabsorption, bloody diarrhoea,
acute abdomen) or complications (e.g. arthropathy or iritis). If
suspected refer for confirmation of diagnosis and specialist management.

chapter 13

Gastrointestinal medicine

Management of ulcerative colitis See BNF 1.5.
Assessing severity See Table 13.15, b p. 414.
Active disease
• Mesalazine 2–4g daily. Topical 5-ASA derivatives are a useful adjunct if
troublesome rectal symptoms
• Add steroids (prednisolone 40mg od po + rectal preparation) if
prompt response is needed or mesalazine is unsuccessful. Review
frequently and d dose over 8wk. Rapid withdrawal i risk of relapse
• Azathioprine is added if the patient is having recurring attacks despite
mesalazine maintenance frequent steroids (≥2 courses/y), disease
relapses as dose of steroid is d, or relapse <6wk after stopping
steroids. Requires regular supervision
• Ciclosporin or infliximab (anti-TNF antibody)—consultant supervised;
may be effective as acute therapy for severe, steroid-refractory disease
• Admit acutely if
• Severe abdominal pain (especially if associated with tenderness)
• Severe diarrhoea (>8x/d) ± bleeding
• Dramatic weight loss
• Fever >37.5°C, tachycardia >90bpm, or other signs of systemic disease
Maintenance treatment Follow-up in s care is routine. Most patients
require life-long therapy. Mainstays of treatment are 5-ASA derivatives
(e.g. mesalazine 1–2g/d or balsalazide 3g/d). Use a rectal formulation (e.g
mesalazine 1g/d PR) if disease is confined to the rectum or descending
colon. Long-term treatment d risk of colonic cancer by 75%. 10% are
intolerant to 5-ASA derivatives—alternative is azathioprine (consultant
supervision required). Treat proximal constipation with stool-bulking
agents or laxatives. NSAIDs can precipitate relapse so avoid.
Surgery Last resort—but should not be delayed if severe colitis and failing
to respond to medical therapy. 20–30% of patients with pancolitis require
colectomy—1:3 develop pouchitis (non-specific inflammation of the ileal
reservoir) within 5y of surgery.
Prognosis At any time 50% are asymptomatic, 30% have mild symptoms,
and 20% moderate/severe symptoms. <5% are free from relapse after 10y.
Relapses usually affect the same part of the colon.
Complications See Table 13.17.

Management of Crohn’s disease
Active ileal and/or colonic disease
• Treat with mesalazine 4g daily. Less effective than for UC
• Add steroids (prednisolone 40mg od po or budesonide 9mg daily) if
unresponsive to mesalazine. Review frequently, and d dose over 8wk.
Rapid withdrawal i risk of relapse. 0 Steroids are associated with
i risk of severe sepsis and mortality in Crohn’s disease, so alternatives
to steroid therapy are increasingly sought and steroid maintenance for
>3mo should always be avoided
• Elemental or polymeric diets for 4–6wk can be a useful adjunct or
alternative to steroid treatment—take consultant advice

Inflammatory bowel disease

• Other treatments (consultant supervision) include metronidazole,
azathioprine, anti-tumour necrosis factor (infliximab or adalimumab)
• Surgery is an option if medical treatment has failed. 50% need surgery
<10y after onset. Surgery is not curative and 50% will require a further
operation at a later stage. After ileal resection check B12 levels annually

• Admit acutely if

•
•
•

Severe abdominal pain (especially if associated with tenderness)
Severe diarrhoea (>8x/d) ± bleeding
Dramatic weight loss
Bowel obstruction
Fever/other signs of systemic disease

0 For disease elsewhere, take specialist advice.
Maintenance treatment Follow-up in s care is routine. Treatment
is aimed at d impact of the disease. The most effective measure is to
stop smoking. Mesalazine has limited benefit. It is ineffective at doses
<2g/d. Other agents used include azathioprine, methotrexate, and
2-monthly infliximab. All require consultant supervision. Treat diarrhoea
symptomatically with codeine phosphate or loperamide unless it is due
to active colonic disease. C-olestyramine (4g 1–3x/d) d diarrhoea due to
terminal ileal disease/resection. NSAIDs can precipitate relapse so avoid.
Prognosis 75% are back to work after the first year but 15% remain unable
to work long term. Complications—see Table 13.17.

Irritable bowel syndrome
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic (>6mo) relapsing and remitting
condition of unknown cause, with symptoms including: Abdominal pain or
discomfort; Bloating; and Change in bowel habit.
It is a diagnosed on symptoms with no confirmatory test and no cure.
Extremely common. Lifetime prevalence ≥20%, although 750% never consult a GP. 5 > 4 (2.5:1). Symptoms can appear at any age.
Diagnosis of IBS Abdominal pain or discomfort that is:
• Relieved by defecation, or
• Associated with altered bowel frequency or stool form
and ≥2 of the following:
• Altered stool passage (straining, urgency, incomplete evacuation)
• Abdominal bloating (5 > 4), distension, tension, or hardness
• Symptoms made worse by eating
• Passage of mucus
Other commonly associated symptoms include Lethargy, nausea, backache,
and bladder symptoms.

Differential diagnosis
• Pelvic inflammatory disease
• Colonic carcinoma
• Endometriosis
• Coeliac disease
• GI infection
• Inflammatory bowel disease
• Thyrotoxicosis
(Crohn’s disease or UC)
Investigation A diagnosis of exclusion. How far to investigate is a clinical
judgement weighing risks of investigation against possibility of serious disease.
Judgement is based on age of the patient, family history, length of history, and
symptom cluster.
• Patients <40y Check FBC, ESR, and antibody testing to exclude coeliac
disease (TTG/EMA)
• Patients >40y Colonic cancer must be excluded for any patient with
a persistent, unexplained change in bowel habit—particularly towards
looser stools (b p. 399)
• Other investigations to consider
• Thyroid function tests if other symptoms/signs of thyroid disease
• Stool samples to exclude GI infection if diarrhoea
• Endocervical swabs for chlamydia
• Colonoscopy to exclude inflammatory bowel disease
• Laparoscopy to exclude endometriosis
Referral To gastroenterology/colorectal surgery if:
• Passing blood (except if from an anal fissure or haemorrhoids)—U
• Abdominal, rectal, or pelvic mass—U
• Unintentional/unexplained weight loss—U/S
• Positive inflammatory markers and/or anaemia—U/S
• >40y with new symptoms—U (if age >60y)/S/R
• Change in symptoms, especially if >40y—U (if age >60y)/S/R
• Atypical features (i.e. not those listed above)—U/S/R
• Family history of bowel or ovarian cancer—R
• Patient is unhappy to accept a diagnosis of IBS despite explanation—R
U = urgent; S = soon; R = routine.

Irritable bowel syndrome

Treatment Reassure. Information leaflets are helpful. Encourage

lifestyle measures, stress d, leisure time, and regular physical exercise.
Diet Encourage patients to have regular meals and take time to eat. Avoid
missing meals or leaving long gaps between eating.
• Drink ≥8 cups of fluid/d, especially water. Restrict tea/coffee to
3 cups/d. d intake of alcohol and fizzy drinks
• d intake of high-fibre foods (e.g. wholemeal/high-fibre flour and
breads, cereals high in bran, and whole grains such as brown rice)
• d intake of ‘resistant starch’ found in processed or re-cooked foods
• Limit fresh fruit to 3x 80g portions/d
• For diarrhoea, avoid sorbitol, an artificial sweetener
• For wind and bloating consider increasing intake of oats (e.g. oat-based
breakfast cereal or porridge) and linseeds (≤1 tablespoon/d)
• Up to 50% may be helped by exclusion of certain foods (especially
patients with diarrhoea—predominant disease). Diaries may help
identify foods that provoke symptoms. Common candidates are dairy
products, citrus fruits, caffeine, alcohol, tomatoes, gluten, and eggs.
Refer to dietician for exclusion diet
Specific measures
• Probiotics Some evidence of effectiveness. Try a 4wk trial
• Fibre/bulking agents Constipation-predominant IBS. Bran can make
some patients worse. Ispaghula husk is better tolerated. Laxatives are
an alternative but avoid use of lactulose
• Antispasmodics (e.g. mebeverine, peppermint oil) All equally effective.
If no response in a few days, switch to another—different agents suit
different individuals. Once symptoms are controlled use prn
• Antidiarrhoeal preparations (e.g. loperamide) Avoid codeine
phosphate as may cause dependence. Use prn for patients with
diarrhoea-predominant disease. Use pre-emptive doses to cover
difficult situations (e.g. air travel)
• Antidepressants There is evidence that low-dose amitriptyline, e.g.
10mg nocte, is effective. SSRIs are less effective unless the patient is
overtly depressed. Withdraw if no response after 4–6wk
• Psychotherapy and hypnosis Some effect in trials. Reserve for cases
that have failed to respond to more conventional treatment
Failure to respond to treatment Consider another diagnosis—review history
and examination ± refer for further investigation.

Prognosis >50% still have symptoms after 5y.

Jaundice and abnormal liver function
Jaundice Yellow pigmentation of the tissues due to excessive bile
pigment. Clinical jaundice appears when serum bilirubin >35micromol/L.
Causes
• i production of bilirubin (pre-hepatic) Haemolytic anaemia,
drug-induced haemolysis, malaria, Gilbert’s/Crigler–Najjar syndrome
• Defective processing (hepatic) Hepatitis, cirrhosis
• Blocked excretion (obstructive) Gallstones, pancreatic cancer, primary
biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma,
sepsis, enlarged porta hepatis (e.g. s to lymphoma)
History Patients presenting with jaundice may have no other symptoms.
General symptoms include tiredness, nausea, and pruritus. Ask about colour
of the stools and urine (dark urine suggests conjugated hyperbilirubinaemia
and hepatobiliary disease). Check alcohol consumption.
Examination Mild jaundice is best seen by examining the sclerae in natural
light. Look for signs of chronic liver disease and examine the abdomen for
masses and hepatomegaly.
Investigations Initially check FBC and liver function tests—see Table 13.18.
Further investigations depend on the results.
Management Treat the cause of the jaundice. Most patients (except
those with Gilbert’s syndrome or self-limiting viral hepatitis) will require
specialist referral. Refer patients with pre-hepatic and hepatic jaundice
to a hepatologist or gastroenterologist; refer patients with post-hepatic
(obstructive or cholestatic) jaundice to a general or hepatobiliary surgeon.

Neonatal jaundice b p. 868
Abnormal liver function
Raised AST/ALT/GGT in isolation Liver enzymes can i transiently as a
result of viral infection, drugs, or alcohol. ALT tends to be more raised in
viral and autoimmune hepatitis; AST tends to be more raised in patients
with fatty liver; raised GGT is particularly associated with alcohol excess.
• Check medication including herbal medicines
• Stop alcohol
• Repeat LFTs:
• In 1mo if AST/ALT are <3x upper limit of normal
• In 1wk if AST/ALT is ≥3x upper limit of normal
• If still raised request hepatitis screen and USS, or refer to hepatology
or gastroenterology depending on clinical state
• If ALT is <2x upper limit of normal and hepatitis screen is negative:
• If USS is normal, repeat LFTs every 3–6mo to see if abnormalities
settle—may be due to drugs, alcohol, or early fatty liver disease
• If USS shows fatty liver and consuming excess alcohol—advise
abstinence from alcohol and recheck LFTs every 3–6mo
• If USS shows fatty liver and alcohol consumption is within
normal limits, advise weight loss and low-fat diet; treat metabolic
syndrome, and recheck LFTs every 3–6mo
• In all other cases, refer for specialist opinion

0 A mixed picture is common and can be confusing.

Raised bilirubin Possible causes include:
• Hepatitis/biliary obstruction—if ALT/AST are i, refer for liver USS and
do a hepatitis screen or refer as for jaundice
• Haemolysis—check FBC/reticulocyte count—refer to haematology if
abnormal
• Gilbert’s disease—likely if serum bilirubin is <40mmol/L and ALT/AST
and RBC/reticulocytes are normal. Bilirubin levels i after a fast
• If isolated i bilirubin >40mmol/L—probably still Gilbert’s syndrome,
but refer
Raised alkaline phosphatase Usually originates from liver or bone. Bone
is more likely if serum Ca2+ and phosphate are raised and GGT is normal.
i may be associated with any liver disease but is particularly marked in
patients with biliary obstruction and primary biliary cirrhosis.

Medications that cause raised AST/ALT
• Anti-epileptics
•	NSAIDs
• Some herbal medicines
• Some recreational drugs
Statins and abnormal liver function Statins cause a biochemical
abnormality only but do not cause liver failure and are not contra-indicated
in compensated liver disease. May improve fatty liver disease. Measure
liver function tests pre-treatment and after 1–3mo. Thereafter measure
each 6m for 1y. Discontinue if AST/ALT i and stays at >3x normal.
Hepatitis screen Check as appropriate:
• α1-antitrypsin level
• Hepatitis A, B, and C serology
• Serum copper and
• EBV serology
caerulo-plasmin levels (if <40y)
• Liver autoantibodies
• αFP
• Iron studies and transferrin
• Fasting blood glucose and lipids
saturation to exclude
• HbA1c
haemochromatosis
• Most penicillins (especially
co-amoxiclav) and minocycline
• Antifungals
• Statins

Gastrointestinal medicine

Hepatitis
Acute hepatitis May be asymptomatic or present with fatigue, flu-like
symptoms, fever, light stools, dark urine, and/or jaundice. Causes:
• Viral hepatitis, e.g. HBV, HAV, EBV • Toxins
• Obstructive jaundice
• Alcohol
• Other infections—malaria,
• Drugs (e.g. diclofenac,
Q fever, leptospirosis, yellow fever
co-amoxiclav)
Management Check LFTs, FBC, U&E, eGFR, hepatitis serology. Treat
the cause. Admit if condition is poor or rapidly deteriorating; refer for
investigation if sustained abnormalities in liver function with unclear cause
(b p. 420). Complications: chronic hepatitis, acute liver failure.

Hepatitis A (HAV) Common. Spread: faecal–oral route. Patients

are infectious 2wk before feeling ill. Incubation is 2–7wk (average 4wk).
High-risk groups: travellers to high-risk areas, institutional inhabitants and
workers, IV drug abusers, patients with high-risk sexual practices. May be
asymptomatic (especially young children) or present with fever, malaise,
fatigue, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tender
hepatomegaly, pale stools, dark urine, and/or jaundice (70–80% adults).
Management Check LFTs (hepatic jaundice—b p. 420) and hepatitis
serology—IgM antibodies signify recent infection, IgG remains detectable
life-long. Management is supportive. Avoid alcohol until LFTs are normal.
Most recover in <2mo. There is no carrier state and hepatitis A does not
cause chronic liver disease. After infection immunity is life-long.
Prevention Vaccination is indicated for travellers to high-risk areas,
people with chronic liver disease, or those working in high-risk situations.
Preparations available include monovalent vaccine (e.g. Havrix®), hepatitis
A and B combined vaccine (Twinrix®) and hepatitis A and typhoid
combined vaccine (e.g. Hepatyrix®). Passive immunization with human
immunoglobulin gives protection for ≤3mo and is used for short-term
travel or protecting household contacts of sufferers.
Hepatitis E (HEV) Similar to HAV infection. Usually acquired in
developing countries. Incubation is 2–9 wk (average 40d). Diagnosis is
made with serology. Treatment is supportive. There is no chronic state.
Mortality in pregnancy can be as high as 20%. No vaccine exists.
Hepatitis B (HBV) b p. 742
Hepatitis C (HCV) b p. 742
Chronic hepatitis Hepatitis lasting >6mo. May be asymptomatic or
present with fatigue; RUQ pain; jaundice; arthralgia; signs of chronic liver
disease—gynaecomastia, testicular atrophy, clubbing, palmar erythema,
leuconychia, peripheral oedema, spider naevi, portal hypertension,
recurrent infection; and/or complications—acute liver failure, cirrhosis,
hepatocellular carcinoma. Causes:
• Primary biliary cirrhosis
• Viral hepatitis
• Wilson’s disease
• Alcohol
• Haemochromatosis
• Drugs (e.g. nitrofurantoin,
• α1-antitrypsin deficiency
methyldopa, isoniazid)
• Sarcoidosis
• Chronic autoimmune hepatitis

Hepatitis

Management Check LFTs; FBC; U&E; eGFR; and hepatitis screen
(b p. 421). Refer for specialist care.
Chronic autoimmune hepatitis Typically young women. Associated
with personal/family history of autoimmune disease (e.g. RA, vitiligo).
Diagnosis is confirmed with liver biopsy and autoimmune markers.
Specialist management is with steroids ± immunosuppressants.

Primary biliary cirrhosis Slow progressive cholangiohepatitis

eventually resulting in cirrhosis. 5:4 89:1. Peak age at presentation: 45y.
Cause: probably autoimmune. Associations:
• Coeliac disease
• Thyroid disease
• Hepatic and extrahepatic malignancy
• Sjögren’s syndrome
• Pancreatic hyposecretion
• CREST syndrome
Presentation 50% are asymptomatic at presentation. Symptoms/signs:
• Obstructive jaundice (late)
• Fatigue
• Osteoporosis/
• Symptoms/signs of cirrhosis
• Pruritus
osteomalacia
or liver failure
• Arthralgia
• Hirsutism
Investigation and management Blood: LFTs (i alk phos, i ALT, i GGT).
Liver biopsy is diagnostic. Refer for specialist care. If asymptomatic, 1:3
remain symptom-free—the rest develop symptoms in 2–4y. Median
survival is 7–10y. Liver transplant is an option. Prognosis following
transplant is good but recurrence may occur in the transplanted liver.
Primary haemochromatosis Autosomal recessive condition of
excess gut absorption of iron l iron deposition and damage to heart,
liver, pancreas, joints, and pituitary. 71:400 people are homozygous for
the condition but expression is highly variable. 4 > 5 (women present
710y later). Often an incidental finding, or found by screening relatives
of affected individuals (genetic testing or serum ferritin). Symptoms/signs:
• Impotence/
• Hepatomegaly ±
• Tiredness
testicular atrophy
signs of cirrhosis
• Arthralgia/arthritis
• Cardiomyopathy
• DM
• Skin pigmentation
Investigation and management Blood: i ferritin; i iron; transferrin saturation
>70%; total iron binding capacity d. Refer. Liver biopsy is diagnostic.
Venesection returns life expectancy to normal.
Secondary haemochromatosis Iron overload from frequent
transfusions, e.g. for haemolysis. Specialist management with chelation
therapy to i iron excretion is required.
α1- antitrypsin deficiency b p. 425
Wilson’s disease (hepatolenticular degeneration) Rare,
autosomal recessive disorder. Defective biliary copper excretion l
accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, kidney, and cornea. Treatment is
with penicillamine. Liver transplantation is the only treatment if presentation
is with acute liver failure. S.A.K. Wilson (1878–1937)—British neurologist.

Liver failure and portal hypertension
‘Jaundice is the disease that your friends diagnose’
Aphorisms, Sir William Osler (1849–1920)

Cirrhosis The liver is replaced by fibrotic tissue and regenerating nod-

ules of hepatocytes.

Causes
• Unknown (30%)
• Alcohol (25%)
• Viral hepatitis
• Primary biliary cirrhosis
• Haemochromatosis

•
•
•
•

Wilson’s disease
Budd–Chiari syndrome
Chronic active hepatitis
α1-antitrypsin deficiency

Presentation Variable. May be an incidental finding. Symptoms/signs:
• Gynaecomastia
• Hepatomegaly (although liver
• Testicular atrophy
becomes small and hard in late
• Clubbing
stages)
• Xanthelasma/xanthomata
• Spider naevi
• Portal hypertension
• Dupuytren’s contracture
• Splenomegaly
• Palmar erythema

Acute liver failure Presents with sudden onset of severe illness.
• Jaundice
• Hypoglycaemia
• Hepatic encephalopathy—ranges from mild confusion and irritability,
through drowsiness and increasing confusion, to coma
• Haemorrhage—due to deranged clotting factors
• Ascites—hepatosplenomegaly and ascites are not usually prominent
• Infection
•	Nausea ± vomiting
• i BP
• Foetor hepaticus (sweet smell on the breath)
Causes
In previously healthy patients:
tetrachloride)
• Viral hepatitis
• Heatstroke
• Weil’s disease
• Paracetamol overdose
• Budd–Chiari syndrome
• Halothane
• Pregnancy
• Idiosyncratic drug reactions
• Wilson’s disease
• Fungal/plant toxins
• Reye’s syndrome
• Malignant infiltration
• Chemical exposure (e.g. carbon
In patients with chronic liver disease:
• Diuretics and/or electrolyte imbalance
• Infection
• Alcohol binges
• GI bleeding
• Constipation
• Sedation
Management Admit as emergency to a hepatologist/gastroenterologist
unless an expected terminal event. Prognosis is poor (<60% survive).

Liver failure and portal hypertension

Late signs Occur when the liver can no longer compensate for the
damage to it—jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy, leuconychia, and oedema
(due to hypoalbuminaemia).
Investigation
• Blood—FBC, LFTs (may be normal until late stages), GGT, U&E, Cr,
eGFR, hepatitis screen (b p. 421)
• Liver USS
Management
• Refer to gastroenterology/hepatology for expert advice
• Treat the cause where possible
• Avoid alcohol and refer to dietician for advice on nutrition
• Pruritus s to jaundice may respond to cholestyramine
• Give flu and pneumococcal vaccination
Complications
• Portal hypertension (± bleeding • Ascites (bacterial peritonitis
complicates 1:4 cases—consider
oesophageal varices)
prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin)
• Encephalopathy
• Renal failure
• Hepatocellular carcinoma
Prognosis Very variable—half survive 5y.

α1-antitrypsin deficiency Autosomal recessive disorder. Defective
α1-antitrypsin production l lung, and more rarely, liver damage. X
Treatment with IV α1-antitrypsin d progression of COPD. Paracetamol
may protect the liver. Encourage use for minor illness. Liver transplantation
may eventually be needed.
Portal hypertension Portal venous pressure is raised due to
obstruction of the portal system before, within, or after the liver. In
western countries the most common cause is cirrhosis.
• Elevated portal venous pressure l collaterals between the portal and
systemic circulation (including oesophageal varices). Usually presents
with haematemesis and/or melaena from bleeding varices
• Ascites develops if there is coexistent liver failure with
hypoproteinaemia and hyperaldosteronism
• Splenomegaly is common l thrombocytopaenia and leucopenia
• Signs: splenomegaly (80–90%), ascites, dilated veins around the
umbilicus (rare); purpura; signs of chronic liver disease—jaundice,
clubbing, spider naevi, palmar erythema, gynaecomastia, testicular
atrophy; encephalopathy
• Refer to gastroenterology/hepatology. Specialist management is
essential. If GI bleeding, refer as a ‘blue light’ emergency

Other liver disease
Fatty liver Reversible condition affecting up to 1:4 adults in the UK.
Large vacuoles of triglyceride accumulate in liver cells.
Presentation
• Usually asymptomatic. >50% present as a result of investigation for
abnormal LFTs (b p. 420). Characteristic ‘bright’ appearance on liver USS
• Less frequently presents with a smoothly enlarged liver or symptoms—
nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fat embolus (may be fatal)
Broadly divides into 2 forms:
Alcohol associated fatty liver disease
• Defined as fatty liver disease with daily ethanol consumption >20g (5)
or 30g (4)
• Typically serum AST and ALT are i, but serum AST > serum ALT
• GGT may be i, and alk. phos may also be i but usually <2x upper
limit of normal
• Predisposes to alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis (irreversible)
• Abstinence from alcohol results in resolution
Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)
• Associated with obesity (present in 35% of obese patients), insulin
resistance, and metabolic syndrome (b p. 343)
• Typically, serum AST and ALT are i, but serum ALT > serum AST
• GGT may be i and ALP may also be i but usually <2x upper limit of
normal
• More severe disease results in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and
is thought to be one of the major causes of cryptogenic cirrhosis—
liver failure is uncommon
• A high proportion of patients develop DM long-term
• Treatment is with weight d, metformin, and/or thiazolidinediones
• Treatment with statins is ineffective
Other rarer causes of fatty liver disease
• Drugs, e.g. amiodarone, tamoxifen, valproate
• Pregnancy
• Malnutrition
• Inflammatory bowel disease

Gilbert’s syndrome Inherited metabolic disorder causing unconjugated
hyperbilirubinaemia. Prevalence: 71–2%. Onset is shortly after birth—but the
condition may go unnoticed for years. Jaundice occurs during intercurrent
illness. i bilirubin on fasting can confirm the diagnosis. Liver biopsy is
normal. No treatment is required and prognosis is excellent.
N.A. Gilbert (1858–1927)—French physician
Benign tumours Hepatomegaly ± RUQ pain or an incidental finding.
Common types Hepatic adenoma, fibroma, leiomyoma, lipoma,
haemangioma, focal nodular hyperplasia (e.g. with cirrhosis).

Other liver disease

Management Refer to gastroenterology to exclude malignancy and
confirm diagnosis. Urgency depends on clinical picture and findings on USS.

Hepatocellular cancer (HCC) Rare in the UK (100 new cases and

100 deaths/y). Much more common in areas of the world where hepatitis B
is endemic (e.g. China, India). Usually arises from regenerating nodules in a
cirrhotic liver. Peak age: 60–70y. Intra- and extrahepatic spread is common
and occurs early.
Presentation In a patient with known cirrhosis:
• Fatigue
• Anorexia and/or weight d
• Fever
• Ascites
• Rapid deterioration in liver function
• Haemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity (often fatal)
• Budd–Chiari syndrome (occlusion of the hepatic vein resulting in
jaundice, epigastric pain, and shock)
• Examination—may reveal an abdominal mass, hepatomegaly ± an
arterial bruit over the tumour
Management If suspected check αFP and refer for urgent assessment. αFP
>500ng/mL in a patient with known cirrhosis is almost certainly diagnostic.
The most important prognostic factors are the number and size of the
liver lesions and the presence of vascular involvement. 95% of patients
with cirrhosis have disease too extensive for curative surgery, or their
severely compromised liver function makes radical surgery inappropriate.
50% of patients without cirrhosis have resectable tumours. Surgery may be
combined with liver transplantation. Inoperable tumours may be treated
with hepatic artery ligation or embolization. Tumours respond poorly to
chemo- or radiotherapy.
Overall prognosis Patients with cirrhosis—median survival 3mo; patients
without cirrhosis—median survival 1y.
Cholangiocarcinoma Rare adenocarcinoma of the biliary tract. May
be associated with UC. Typically presents in patients >60y with jaundice,
RUQ pain and weight loss. The only effective treatment is surgery, which is
only possible in 710–20% of patients. Selected fit patients with unresectable
disease may be offered palliative chemotherapy or enrolment in a clinical
trial. Median survival 4–6mo.
Secondary tumours The most common type of liver tumours—usually
signalling late disease. Presentation: hard, enlarged, knobbly liver ± RUQ pain
± jaundice (late). If found and no history of malignancy refer to oncology/
general surgery for urgent referral to find the primary.
1° tumours commonly metastasizing to the liver Lung, breast, large
bowel, stomach, uterus, pancreas, carcinoid, lymphoma, leukaemia.

Gallbladder disease
Gallstones Gallstones are increasingly common. 9% of 60y olds have
them and prevalence i with age.
Other risk factors
• Gender (5 > 4)
• Body weight—prevalence i with weight; also associated with rapid
weight d
• Race—in the USA, Native American > Hispanic > white > black
• Affluency
• Pregnancy (and possibly HRT but not COC pill)
• Alcohol is protective
• Diet—vegetarian diet is protective
Associated conditions
• Haemolysis
• DM
• Hypertriglyceridaemia

• Cirrhosis
• Crohn’s disease
• Partial gastrectomy

Drugs which cause gallstones Clofibrate (and other fibric acid derivatives);
octreotide (somatostatin analogue).
Presentation Gallstones are blamed for many digestive symptoms—they
are probably innocent in most cases. 70% of stones in the gall bladder do
not cause symptoms. Common presentations—see Table 13.19.
Management of gallstones
• Advise the patient to stick to a low-fat diet
• Refer for surgical review ± further evaluation (e.g. ERCP—endoscopic
retrograde cholangiopancreatography)
• Gallstones can be removed by cholecystectomy (laparoscopic or
open) or ERCP or may be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid (stones
<5mm diameter—40% recur in <5y) or shattered with lithotripsy
(1:3 develop biliary colic afterwards)
• Persistent digestive symptoms after surgery are common (50% after
cholecystectomy) and difficult to treat

Gallbladder cancer Rare. 5 > 4. Gallstones are a predisposing

factor. Typically presents in patients >40y with right upper quadrant pain,
anorexia, weight d, and jaundice. Surgical resection offers the only hope of
cure but disease is usually advanced at presentation. Selected fit patients
with unresectable disease may be offered palliative chemotherapy or
enrolment in a clinical trial. Prognosis is poor.

Pancreatitis
Acute pancreatitis Premature activation of pancreatic enzymes

results in autodigestion and tissue damage. Most episodes are mild and
self-limiting but 1:5 patients have a severe attack. Overall mortality
75–10%. May be recurrent.
Causes In 10% patients no cause is identified.
• Common causes (80%): gallstones, alcohol
• Rarer causes:
• Hyperlipidaemia
• Drugs (e.g. azathioprine)
• Pancreas divisum (normal variant
• Trauma
in 7–8% of the white population)
• Pancreatic tumours
• Familial pancreatitis
• Post-ERCP
• Vasculitis
• Viral infection (mumps, HIV,
• Ischaemia or embolism
Coxsackie B)
• Pregnancy
• Mycoplasma infection
• End-stage renal failure
• Hypercalcaemia
Presentation
• Poorly localized, continuous, boring epigastric pain which i over 71h—
often worse lying down ± radiation to the back (50%)
•	Nausea ± vomiting
Examination
• General Tachycardia, fever, shock, jaundice
• Abdominal Localized epigastric tenderness or generalized abdominal
tenderness; abdominal distension ±d bowel sounds; evidence of
retroperitoneal haemorrhage (periumbilical and flank bruising—rare)
Management Admit as an acute surgical emergency. Prior to transfer, give
analgesia with pethidine (morphine may induce spasm of the sphincter of Oddi).
Complications Delayed complications may present in general practice—
suspect if persistent pain or failure to regain weight or appetite. Complications
include:
• Pancreatic necrosis
• Pseudocyst—localized collection of pancreatic secretions
• Fistula/abscess formation
• Bleeding or thrombosis
Prevention of further attacks
• Avoid factors that may have caused pancreatitis, e.g. alcohol, drugs
• Advise patients to follow a low-fat diet
• Treat reversible causes, e.g. hyperlipidaemia, gallstones

Chronic pancreatitis Chronic inflammation of the pancreas results in
gradual destruction and fibrosis of the gland ± loss of pancreatic function
l malabsorption and DM.
Cause Alcohol is responsible for most cases. More rarely: familial; CF;
haemochromatosis; pancreatic duct obstruction (gallstones/pancreatic
cancer); hyperparathyroidism.

Pancreatitis

Presentation
• Constant or episodic epigastric pain, radiating to the back and relieved
by sitting forwards
• Weight d
• Vomiting
• DM
• Weakness
• Chronic poor health
• Jaundice
• Steatorrhoea
Management Refer to gastroenterology. Treatment:
• Diet Low-fat, high-protein, high-calorie diet with fat-soluble vitamin
supplements. Refer to dietician
• Pancreatic enzyme supplementation (e.g. Creon® capsules pre-meals)
May improve diarrhoea
• Alcohol abstinence
• Pain control Provide analgesia—beware of opioid abuse. Consider
referral for coeliac plexus block
• Surgery Pancreatectomy or pancreaticojejunostomy for pancreatic
duct stricture, obstructive jaundice, unremitting pain, or weight loss
• Diabetes management

Pancreatic insufficiency Global d function of the pancreas. Causes:
• Child Cystic fibrosis
• Adult Chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic tumour, pancreatectomy, total
gastrectomy
Presentation Malabsorption (frequent loose, odorous stools ± abdominal
pain), weight loss or failure to thrive, DM.
Management Take specialist advice. Treat the underlying cause. Treat
associated DM. Suppplement digestive enzymes (e.g. with Creon®).

Pancreatic tumours
Pancreatic cancer accounts for 3% of all malignancies, causing 7,800
deaths/y in the UK. 80% of cases occur in patients >60y. 4 > 5 (3:2).

Risk factors
• Smoking—causes 25–30% of pancreatic cancers in the UK. Risk returns
to non-smoker levels 10–20y after cessation
• Chronic pancreatitis—usually related to excess alcohol
• Type II (non-insulin-dependent) DM—relative risk 8 1.8
• Obesity—i risk by 19%
• Genetic—5% pancreatic cancers are hereditary; characterized by
presentation aged <30y. and +ve FH
• Occupation—cancer is i among nickel workers and workers exposed
to insecticides, radiation, lead, iron, or chromium

Tumour characteristics
• The majority of pancreatic tumours develop in the exocrine part
of the gland. 95% of tumours are adenocarcinomas. Rarely tumours
develop from the endocrine part—these have better prognosis
• 75% arise in the head of the pancreas, 15% from the body, and 10%
from the tail. Tumours arising in the head of the pancreas tend to
present earlier and are easier to remove
• Spread to local LNs occurs early and metastatic spread to the
peritoneum, liver, and lungs is frequently found at presentation
Presentation Non-specific with:
• Gradual deterioration in health or fatigue
• Anorexia or weight d
• Pain—epigastric ± radiation l back—may be relieved by sitting
forward
• Diarrhoea/steatorrhoea due to malabsorption
• Early satiety, dyspepsia, or nausea/vomiting (gastric outlet obstruction)
•	New DM
• Obstructive jaundice
• Spontaneous venous thrombosis
• Pancreatitis

Examination Check for weight d, epigastric or left upper quadrant
mass, hepatomegaly, jaundice. If jaundice is present the gall bladder may
be palpable as a small, rounded mass beneath the liver.

Management Refer for urgent surgical assessment. Diagnosis is
confirmed using a combination of USS, CT, MRI, and/or ERCP. The only
potentially curative treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgery but <15% of
patients are suitable for surgery at presentation. The operation of choice is
a Whipple’s procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy). Surgery is associated
with significant morbidity; mortality 5–15%.
Prognosis Those undergoing surgical resection have 5y survival of
7–25% (median survival 11–20mo) but those that survive 5y are likely
to survive long-term. Median survival for those with irresectable locally
advanced disease is 6–11mo, and 2–6mo if metastatic disease.

Pancreatic tumours

Palliative treatment Patients with locally advanced/metastatic disease

may benefit from surgical bypass of common bile duct and/or duodenal
obstruction. An alternative is a biliary stent. Chemotherapy may give some
survival benefit. Refer for palliative care support early.

Endocrine tumours In all cases specialist management is required.
Glucagonoma Islet cell tumour of the pancreas. Most are malignant and
90% have liver or LN metastases at presentation. 5–20% of tumours occur
as part of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN I) syndrome. Presents with:
• Attacks of hyperglycaemia (DM in >50%)
• Skin changes—sore mouth, necrolytic migratory erythema (70%—rash
which starts as an erythematous rash then blisters before crusting)
• Anaemia
• Weight d/cachexia (60%)
• Diarrhoea
• Tendency to venous
• Depression/psychosis
thrombosis (11%)
Insulinoma Tumour of the APUD cells of the Islets of Langerhans.
>90% are benign. 7–8% are associated with MEN I syndrome. Presents
with episodes of hypoglycaemia, especially when exercising or fasting.
i appetite and frequent food intake to avoid hypoglycaemia often results
in substantial weight gain.
Somatostatinoma Uncommon islet cell tumour. Most are large tumours
(>5cm) in the head/body of the pancreas. Presents with gallstones,
steatorrhoea, and DM.
0 Extrapancreatic somatostatinomas can present in association with neuro­
fibromatosis type I and phaeochromocytoma.
Verner–Morrison syndrome An intestinal vasointestinal peptide (VIP)producing tumour results in profuse watery diarrhoea l dehydration,
metabolic acidosis, and d K+. Also associated with insulin resistance and
impaired glucose tolerance. VIPomas account for <10% islet cell tumours.
60% are malignant. J.V. Verner, (b.1927)—US physician; A.B. Morrison,

Renal medicine and urology

Creatinine, urea, and electrolytes
Serum creatinine Commonly ordered test to detect renal dysfunction.

Rough guide to glomerular filtration rate (GFR) when corrected for age,
gender, and weight—d in GFR is associated with i in serum creatinine.
Causes of an abnormal serum creatinine—see Table 14.1.

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) More sensitive
measure than serum creatinine to assess renal function. Calculated from:
• Serum creatinine
• Age
• Gender, and
•	Ethnicity—people of Afro-Caribbean origin tend to have i muscle
mass so their eGFR must be multiplied by 1.21

Changes in eGFR can be used to monitor changes in kidney function.
• Normal eGFR is >90mL/min/1.73m2
• eGFR 60–90mL/min/1.73m2 does not indicate CKD unless additional
markers of damage are present—persistent microalbuminuria,
persistent proteinuria, persistent microscopic haematuria, or structural
abnormality, e.g. polycystic kidneys
• eGFR <60mL/min/1.73m2 indicates CKD (b p. 440)
Renal function d with age (approximately 1mL/min/y >40y).
Many elderly patients have a GFR <60mL/min which, because of
d muscle mass, may not be indicated by a i serum creatinine.
Measuring eGFR gives a better indication of renal function.

Urea Commonly ordered test to detect renal dysfunction. While d in GFR

is associated with i in serum urea, serum urea may also vary independently of
the GFR. Causes of abnormal serum urea—see Table 14.1.

Hyperkalaemia High serum potassium (>5mmol/L). Causes: See
Table 14.2. Treat the cause.

• Plasma potassium >6.5mmol/L needs urgent treatment.
• Check it is not an artifact, e.g. due to haemolysis inside the bottle
• Admit for investigation of cause and treatment
ECG changes associated with hyperkalaemia Tall tented T-waves; small
P-wave; wide QRS complex becoming sinusoidal VF.

Hypokalaemia Low serum potassium (<3.5mmol/L). Presents with
muscle weakness, hypotonia, cardiac arrhythmias, cramps, and tetany.
Causes: see Table 14.2. If K+ >2.5mmol/L and no symptoms, give oral
potassium supplement. 0 If the patient is taking a thiazide diuretic,
hypokalaemia >3.0mmol/L rarely needs treating.
• Plasma potassium <2.5mmol/L needs urgent treatment—admit.
ECG changes associated with hypokalaemia Small/inverted T-waves;
prominent U-wave; prolonged P-R interval; depressed ST segment.

Hyponatraemia Low serum sodium (<135mmol/L). Rarely symptomatic
in general practice. May present with signs of water excess— confusion, fits,

Creatinine, urea, and electrolytes

i BP, cardiac failure, oedema, anorexia, nausea, muscle weakness. Causes: see
Table 14.2. Management: treat the cause. If unwell admit for investigation.

Hypernatraemia Excess serum sodium (>145mmol/L). Rare in general
practice. Presentation: thirst, confusion, coma, fits, signs of dehydration—
dry skin, d skin turgor, postural hypotension, and oliguria if water deficient.
Causes: see Table 14.2. Management: admit for investigation.

•	Outflow tract obstruction (b p. 454) • Renal failure (b p. 440)
• Hypertension (b p. 248)
• Nephrotic syndrome

Proteinuria Normally detected with urine dipstick. If +ve, then repeat
with another sample to exclude spurious results, and send sample for
M,C&S to exclude UTI. Treat the cause where necessary. Causes:
• CCF
• Pregnancy (and PET)
• UTI
• SLE
• Postural
• Vaginal mucus

• Amyloid
syndrome
• Pyrexia
Microalbuminuria Albuminuria in the range 30–200 mg/L. Not detectable
with standard urine dipsticks. Special sticks are available for routine
screening of high-risk groups, e.g. diabetics. Causes:
• DM Microalbuminuria precedes frank proteinuria—b p. 356
• Arteriopathy Microalbuminuria may be present in patients with CCF
or i BP. Presence of microalbuminuria predicts i risk of MI, CVA,
CCF, and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality
• Other chronic illness Malignancy, COPD
• Acute illness Inflammatory bowel disease, MI, acute pancreatitis,
trauma, burns, meningitis
Haematuria b p. 446	

Presentation of renal disease

• Loss of specific proteins, e.g. transferrin (causes hypochromic anaemia,
which is iron-resistant)
Nephritic syndrome Central feature is blood and protein in the urine
from glomerular inflammation.

infection with group A β-haemolytic streptococci), vasculitis.
• Features Oliguria, haematuria and proteinuria, fluid retention, i BP,
uraemia, and i creatinine
• Management Refer suspected cases immediately to renal medicine
• Risks Hypertensive encephalopathy, pulmonary oedema, acute kidney
injury
• Prognosis Excellent in children; in adults some proteinuria/urine
sediment may persist. CKD is rare
Nephrocalcinosis Deposition of Ca2+ in the kidneys. X-ray—
calcification. May cause symptoms of UTI or renal stones. Causes:

Renal failure
Oliguria Urine output <400mL/24h. Causes: dehydration, cardiac failure,
ureteric obstruction, renal failure.

Acute kidney injury (AKI) Also known as acute renal failure (ARF).

d renal function over hours/days ± oliguria/anuria. Refer immediately if
acute i in urea/creatinine or d in eGFR (to <60mL/min/1.73m2 if normal
in last 3mo, or d of >15% over 5d). Causes: acute tubular necrosis (80%—
due to acute circulatory compromise); renal tract obstruction (5%); GN.

Chronic kidney disease (CKD)N Also known as chronic renal failure
(CRF). Slow d renal function over months/years. Causes:
• SLE
• Amyloid
• Polycystic kidneys
• DM
• Myeloma
• Glomerulonephritis
• i BP • i Ca2+
• PAN
• Renovascular disease
• Urinary tract obstruction
• Interstitial nephritis
• Chronic pyelonephritis
Presentation
• History FH (polycystic kidneys); UTI; drugs (especially analgesics)
• Symptoms Often no symptoms. Nausea, anorexia, lethargy, itch,
nocturia, impotence. Later: oedema, dyspnoea, chest pain (from
pericarditis), vomiting, confusion, fits, hiccups, neuropathy, coma
• Signs Pallor, ‘lemon tinge’ to skin, pulmonary/peripheral oedema,
pericarditis, pleural effusions, metabolic flap, i BP, retinopathy
Investigation
• Urine M, C&S, microalbuminuria, albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR) or
TPCR, RBCs, glucose
• Blood U&E, creatinine, eGFR, glucose, Ca2+, PO4– urate, protein, FBC,
ESR, serum electrophoresis.
• Renal tract USS If progressive or advanced (stage 4/5) disease, refractory
i BP, haematuria, or palpable bladder/lower urinary tract signs
Management classification—see Table 14.4
• Treat reversible causes. Stop/avoid nephrotoxic drugs (e.g. NSAIDs).
Consider d dose of other drugs as excretion/metabolism may be
impaired. 0 Metformin should be stopped if eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2
• Monitor Cr/eGFR and dipstick urine (see Table 14.4). If proteinuria, send
urine for M,C&S. If no infection but proteinuria persists, test TPCR or ACR
in early morning urine. If TPCR >100mg/mmol or ACR >70mg/mmol, refer
• Manage CVD risk. Monitor/treat i cholesterol and i BP (target
130/80—ACE/ARB is first-line). Treat DM. Smoking cessation
• Monitor and treat anaemia and renal bone disease
0 If sudden d in renal function (d eGFR of >15% between tests or >5mL/
min/1.73m2 in <1y or >10mL/min/1.73m2 in <5y) suspect infection, dehydration, uncontrolled i BP, metabolic disturbance (e.g. i Ca2+), obstruction, nephrotoxins (e.g. drugs). If unable to find cause or treatment does
not i renal function, refer.
Refer To a renal physician if:
• Stage 4/5 CKD
• Significant proteinuria (TPCR >100mg/mmol or ACR >70mg/mmol)

Renal failure

• Sudden d in eGFR (>15%) and UTI excluded
• Persistent microscopic haematuria and <50y (to urologist if >50y)
• Functional consequences of CKD, i.e. anaemia (<11g/dL), bone disease,
or refractory hypertension (>140/90 on 4 agents)
End-stage renal disease (ESRD) 80 new patients/million population/y.
Irreversible. Dialysis starts when GFR is 10–15% normal. Dialysis is needed
lifelong unless a kidney transplant becomes available. Refer back to the renal
unit managing the patient if you have any problems.
Haemodialysis Blood flows opposite dialysis fluid and substances are
cleared along a concentration gradient across a semi-permeable membrane. Problems: pulmonary oedema; infection (HIV, hepatitis, bacteria);
U&E imbalance; BP d or i; problems with vascular access; dialysis arthro­
pathy (especially shoulders and wrists); aluminium toxicity; time.
Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) A permanent catheter
is inserted into the peritoneum via a subcutaneous tunnel. 72L dialysis fluid
is introduced and kept in the peritoneum. This is changed for fresh fluid up
to 5x/d at home. Does not tie the patient to a dialysis machine. Problems:
peritonitis; catheter blockage (refer as an emergency); weight i; poor DM
control; pleural effusion; leakage.
Anaemia and erythropoietin s anaemia due to d kidney erythropoietin
production is universal amongst people with ESRD. Exclude other causes.
Recombinant erythropoietin is given if Hb <10.5g/dL (75%).
Renal transplantation Transplanted kidneys are usually sited in an
iliac fossa. 5y graft survival is 788% for adults. Closer genetic matches have
better survival rates. Problems:
• Rejection
• Renal artery stenosis at 3–9mo post-op
• Persistent i BP and i
•	Obstruction at ureteric anastmosis
cholesterol
• Ciclosporin-induced nephropathy
• Atherosclerosis (5x i risk

Renal medicine and urology

Kidney diseases
Interstitial nephritis Important cause of renal failure. Associated with
inflammatory cell infiltration of the renal interstitium/tubules. Causes:
• Acute interstitial nephritis Idiosyncratic reaction to drugs (penicillin,
NSAIDs, furosemide) or infection (Staphylo- or Streptococcus)
• Chronic interstitial nephritis Idiopathic (most), drugs, sickle-cell
disease, analgesic nephropathy.
Presentation and prognosis Presents with AKI/CKD, raised temperature,
arthralgia, eosinophilia. Patients with AKI have good prognosis. Those with
CKD have gradual deterioration over time.

Diabetic nephropathy b p. 356
Analgesic nephropathy Caused by prolonged heavy use of analgesics
(including NSAIDs). Presents with an interstitial nephritis-like picture.
Associated with i incidence of UTI. Carcinoma of the renal pelvis is a
rare complication. Investigate promptly if the patient develops haematuria.
Glomerulonephritis Types and presentation—see Table 14.5. Refer

all suspected cases urgently to a renal physician. Terminology:
• Focal Some glomeruli affected
• Diffuse All glomeruli affected
• Segmental Part of each glomerulus affected
• Global All of each glomerulus affected
Chronic pyelonephritis Presents as CKD or one of its complications.
Probably arises from UTIs, vesico-ureteric reflux and consequent renal
scarring in childhood (b p. 878). Refer to a renal physician.
Table 14.5 Types of glomerulonephritis

Proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome. May be associated with
heroin abuse. >50% progress to CKD

Membranoproliferative

50% present as nephrotic syndrome. Associations—endocarditis,
C3 nephritic factor (autoantibody), hepatitis C, measles

Proliferative

Presents with nephritic syndrome. Classically seen 2wk after
Strep. infection. Prognosis is excellent

IgA disease
(Berger’s disease)

Causes recurrent haematuria in young men. A similar
histological picture is seen in Henoch–Schönlein purpura
(b p. 526). 30% progress to ESRD

Rapidly progressive/ Presents with haematuria, oliguria, i BP, acute renal failure.
crescentic
Vigorous treatment may preserve renal function. Causes:
anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture’s
disease), Wegener’s granulomatosis, Henoch–Schönlein purpura

Kidney diseases

Haemolytic uraemic syndrome Most common cause
of AKI in children. Usually follows gastroenteritis. Due to E. coli
toxin. Have a high index of suspicion in any child with bloody
diarrhoea. Occasionally occurs without diarrhoea. Other features:
• Dehydration
• CNS symptoms—irritability,
•	Oliguria (though may be polyuria)
drowziness, ataxia, coma
• Proteinuria/haematuria
• i BP (associated with
• Haematological features—anaemia,
non-diarrhoeal disease)
thrombocytopenia ± purpura
Management Admit for specialist care—often including dialysis. If
associated with diarrhoeal illness, >80% make full recovery. Mortality
is 1.8%. Poor prognostic indicators are age >5y at onset and dialysis for
>2wk. Disease in the absence of diarrhoea has poorer prognosis.
Adult polycystic kidney disease Autosomal dominant disease
(1:1,000). Cysts develop in the kidney causing gradual d in renal function.
Common cause of CKD. Presents with haematuria, UTI, abdominal mass
(30% have cysts in the liver/pancreas too), lumbar/abdominal pain, and/
or i BP. May be associated with mitral valve prolapse and SAH/berry
aneurysms. USS shows large kidneys with multiple cysts. Refer to a renal
physician if CKD 3–5. Treat infections and i BP. Check family members
(though cysts may not be seen <30y). 45% progress to ESRD by 60y.
Medullary sponge kidney Developmental abnormality of the

medullary pyramids of the kidney, characterized by dilatation of the
renal collecting tubules. 4 > 5. There may be a family history. Most are
asymptomatic and the condition is an incidental finding. If symptomatic,
presents with UTIs, renal stones, haematuria. Refer if symptomatic.
Usually prognosis is very good and most require no treatment.

Renal vein thrombosis (RVT) Causes: nephrotic syndrome (15–20%
develop RVT); membranous GN (30%); acute dehydration. Presentation
varies from no symptoms to severe pain and loin tenderness. Suspect in
at-risk individuals if unexplained loss of renal function and RBCs in urine.
Refer to a renal physician for further investigation.
Renal artery stenosis Causes: atheroma, fibromuscular hyperplasia (in
the young). Presents with i BP (may be severe or drug-resistant); vascular
disease elsewhere; abdominal bruit; i Cr, d eGFR, and proteinuria. If
bilateral or extensive, renal failure may be precipitated by dehydration,
d BP, or drugs (ACE/ARB initiation; NSAIDs). Refer to a renal physician (if
diagnosis is unsure) or vascular surgeon (if diagnosis is known).

Alport’s syndrome X-linked or autosomal inherited disease. Congenital
sensorineural deafness, haematuria, proteinuria, and renal failure. Associated
with lens abnormalities, platelet dysfunction, and i BP. Causes ESRD by
third decade in 4; 5 rarely develop ESRD. Renal failure does not recur after
transplantation. A.C. Alport (1880–1959)—South African physician.

Renal medicine and urology

Renal stones
12% of 4 and 3% of 5 will develop a renal stone at some point; peak age
20–50y. Symptoms are not dependent on size of the stone.

Risk factors
• Family history—i risk x3. Specific conditions: X-linked nephrolithiasis,
cystinuria, hyperoxaluria
• Anatomically abnormal kidneys, e.g. horseshoe kidney, medullary
sponge kidney
• Metabolic disease, e.g. gout, hypercalcaemia/hypercalciuria, cystinuria,
renal tubular acidosis or other acidosis (ileostomy, adenomatous
polyp), oxaluria, aminoaciduria
• Dehydration
• Immobilization
• Chronic UTI
Drugs predisposing patients to stone formation Acetazolamide, allopurinol,
aspirin, steroids, indinavir, nelfinavir, loop diuretics, probenecid, quinolones,
sulfonamides, theophylline, thiazides, triamterene, antacids, calcium/vitamin
D supplements, high-dose vitamin C.

Presentation Usually presents with pain ± nausea/vomiting. Location

and type of pain gives clues about the site of the stone:
• Loin pain—kidney stone
• Strangury—bladder stone
• Renal colic—ureteric stone • Interruption of flow—urethral stone
Renal colic
• Symptoms Severe pain with waves of i severity. Usually starts
abruptly as flank pain which then radiates around the abdomen to the
groin as stone progresses down the ureter. May be referred to testis/
tip of penis in men or labia majora in women
• Signs Patient is obviously in pain—usually unable to sit still and keeps
shifting position to try to get comfortable (in contrast to peritonitis
where patients tend to keep still). May be pale and sweaty. May be
mild tenderness on deep abdominal palpation or loin tenderness,
though often minimal signs. If fever suspect infection
Other presentations UTI, haematuria, retention, renal failure (rare).

Differential diagnosis Pyelonephritis; ruptured AAA; cholecystitis;
pancreatitis; appendicitis; diverticulitis; obstruction; strangulated hernia;
testicular torsion; pethidine addiction.

Immediate investigations Dipstick urine if possible. Absence of RBCs
does not exclude renal colic but consider alternative diagnosis.
Immediate management Stones usually pass spontaneously. Give

pain relief (diclofenac
admission to hospital if:
• Fever
•	Oliguria
• Poor intake of fluid

75mg IM/100mg PR) ± antiemetic. Consider

• Pregnant
• Lives alone
• Uncertain diagnosis

• Analgesia ineffective /
short-lived
• Symptoms >24h

If not admitted Encourage i fluid intake; sieve urine for stones.
Monitor/review pain relief and for complications.

Renal stones

Further investigations Can wait until the next working day and include:
• Blood U&E, creatinine, eGFR, Ca2+, PO43–, alkaline phosphatase, uric
acid, albumin
• Urine M,C&S; RBCs. Consider checking ‘spot’ test for urine cystine,
and TPCR, Ca2+, PO43–, uric acid, and sodium excretion
• Radiology X-ray of kidneys, ureters, and bladder—90% of renal
stones are radio-opaque—only urate and xanthine stones are
radio-transluscent; renal tract USS

Follow-up 50% recur in 5–7y. Give general advice on prevention of

stones (see Table 14.6). If investigations show any loss of renal function,
renal obstruction, or remaining stones—refer to urology. Dependent on
composition of stones, give dietary advice/refer to dietician (see Table 14.6).

Hyperoxaluria May be 1° (autosomal recessive condition) or s to gut
resection/malabsorption or dietary excess of spinach or vitamin C. Take
specialist advice on management. There are two types of p hyperoxaluria:
• Type 1 hyperoxaluria Calcium oxalate stones are widely distributed
throughout the body. Presents as renal stones and nephrocalcinosis in
children. 80% have chronic renal failure in <20y.
• Type 2 hyperoxaluria More benign but less common—
nephrocalcinosis but no chronic renal failure.
Cystinuria Most common aminoaciduria. Usually presents with stones
at age 10–30y. Urine: cystine i, ornithine i, arginine i, lysine i. Take specialist advice on management.
Hypercalcaemia b p. 366
0 Hypercalciuria may occur without hypercalcaemia and is found in
7 80% of patients with calcium oxalate stones.

Haematuria, bladder and renal cancer
Haematuria Blood in the urine. Causes—see Table 14.7.

• May be frank (visible) or microscopic (up to 20% population).
• Investigate all cases of haematuria further
• Check MSU for M,C&S, and blood for U&E, creatinine, and eGFR. Free
Hb and myoglobin make urine test sticks +ve in absence of red cells
• Urine discoloration can result from beetroot ingestion, porphyria, or
rifampicin
• If cause is identified (e.g. sample taken when menstruating, UTI)—
repeat the check for blood in urine once treated/resolved
• Refer if no cause is found. Rapid access one-stop clinics are now

Urinary tract infection
Urinary tract infection (UTI) is one of the most common conditions seen
in general practice, accounting for up to 6% of consultations (one case/
average surgery). 5 > 4. 20% of women at any time have asymptomatic
bacteriuria and 20–40% of women will have a UTI in their lifetime.
Infecting organisms E. coli (>70%), Proteus spp., Pseudomonas spp., streptococci, staphylococci.

Risk factors

• Sexual intercourse
• Diaphragm use
• GU malformation

• Urinary stasis (e.g.
obstruction)
• Delayed micturition
(e.g. on long
journeys)

Presentations of UTI
• Cystitis Frequency, dysuria, urgency, strangury, low abdominal pain,
incontinence of urine, acute retention of urine, cloudy or offensive
urine, and/or haematuria
• Pyelonephritis Loin pain, fever, rigors, malaise, vomiting, and/or haematuria
Dysuria and urgency Painful micturition resulting from urethral or bladder
inflammation. Causes: UTI, urethral syndrome, inflammation (e.g. interstitial cystitis, radiation-induced cystitis), intravesical lesion (tumour, stone),
atrophy (menopause).
Frequency Passage of urine more often than usual. Causes:
•	External pressure (e.g.
• UTI
pregnancy, fibroids)
• Urethral syndrome
• Bladder tumour or stone
• Detrusor instability
•	Enlarged prostate
• Inflammation (e.g. interstitial
• Drugs (e.g. diuretics)
cystitis)
• Fibrosis (e.g. post-radiotherapy) • DM
•	Excessive fluid intake
• Atrophy (menopause)
• Habit
• Neurogenic bladder (e.g. MS)

Initial investigation If uncomplicated UTI in an otherwise healthy
woman, test urine with a leucocyte and nitrite dipstick. If +ve, treat for
UTI. Reasons to send MSU for M,C&S:
• Child—b p. 878
• Unresolved infection after

0 For women with severe or 3 or more symptoms of cystitis, start treatment without urine dipstick. Take MSUs prior to starting antibiotics—send
to the laboratory fresh. Consider chlamydia infection in young men or
women with symptoms of UTI.

Urinary tract infection

Further investigation Consider further investigation with blood tests

(U&E, Cr, eGFR, and/or PSA if >40y and 4) and/or radiology (e.g. renal
tract USS, KUB) if:
• Unclear diagnosis (e.g. persisting

• Pyelonephritis

Management
Catheterized patients—b p. 453    Pregnant women—b p. 812
Children—b p. 878
All other patients
• i fluid intake (>3L/24h). Alkalinize urine (e.g. potassium citrate
solution) to ease symptoms
• Prescribe oral antibiotics, e.g. trimethoprim 200mg bd (80% organisms
are sensitive). Use a 3d course for women with uncomplicated
UTI, a 7d course for men, patients with GU malformations or
immunosuppression, relapse (same organism) or recurrent UTI
(different organism). Use a 7d course of a quinolone (e.g. ciprofloxacin
500mg bd) for patents with pyelonephritis
• Refer to urology if any abnormalities are detected on further
investigation or unable to resolve symptoms. Admission is rarely needed
Prevention of recurrent cystitis Reinfection after successful treatment of infection (90%) or relapse after inadequate treatment.
• General advice Advise patients to urinate frequently; i fluid intake;
double void (i.e. go again after 5–10min) and void after intercourse.
X Efficacy of cranberry juice is controversial
• Prophylactic antibiotics Consider prescribing either post-coitally (e.g.
nitrofurantoin 50mg stat) or continuously (trimethoprim 100mg nocte
or nitrofurantoin 50mg nocte)

Urethral syndrome Symptoms of cystitis with –ve MSU. Unknown
cause. Associated with cold, stress, nylon underwear, CHC, and intercourse. Advise fluids ++ and to wear cotton underwear. Consider
changing/stopping CHC or trying topical oestrogen if post-menopausal.
Tetracyclines (e.g doxycycline 100mg bd for 14d) or azithromycin (500mg
od for 6d)R are helpful in some. If not settling, refer to urology. Urethral
dilatation/massage may be helpful.
Interstitial cystitis Predominantly middle-aged women. Can cause
fibrosis of the bladder wall. Main symptoms—frequency, urgency, and pelvic/suprapubic pain especially when the bladder is full. Often mis­diagnosed
as recurrent UTI. MSU—no bacteriuria. Refer to urologist for confirmation. There is no satisfactory treatment, though antispasmodics, amitriptyline, and bladder stretching under GA may help some patients.

Incontinence of urine
Involuntary loss of urine which is objectively demonstrable and a social or
hygienic problem. 1 in 3 with incontinence consult at outset, 1 in 3 consult
later, 1 in 3 suffer in silence. Opportunistic questioning can identify sufferers.

Examination
• Abdominal including DRE—enlarged bladder, masses, loaded colon,
faecal impaction, anal tone
• Pelvic—prolapse, atrophy, neurological deficit, retention of urine, and
pelvic masses

Investigation Intake/output diary (at least 3d, including working and
leisure days)—evaluates problem and benchmark for progress—record
drinks and passage of urine; urine—RBCs, MC&S; consider blood for U&E,
eGFR, FBC, FBG/HbA1c if renal impairment/DM is suspected.

Drugs that exacerbate/cause incontinence Diuretics, antihistamines, anxiolytics, α-blockers, sedatives and hypnotics, anticholinergic
drugs, TCAs.
GP management 0 30% have a mixed pattern. Treat according to
dominant symptom. Try general measures before referring to urology/
gynaecology or for further investigations (see Table 14.9).
General measures
• Manipulate fluid intake: amount, type (avoid tea, coffee, alcohol), timing
• Promote weight d
• Alter medication, e.g. timing of diuretics
• Treat UTI and chronic respiratory conditions
• Avoid constipation
• Consider HRT (topical or systemic) for oestrogen deficiency
• Consider scheduled voiding if cognitive deficit

• Causes Prostatectomy; childbirth; deterioration of pelvic floor muscles/
nerves
• Treatment Pelvic floor exercises (b p. 841) continued >3mo help 60%
(taught by physiotherapists/continence advisors; leaflets available)—may
be assisted by vaginal cones and/or electrical stimulation. Mechanical
devices (e.g. Contrelle Activguard®, FemSoft®) may help.

Incontinence of urine

Urge incontinence (overactive bladder syndrome) Detrusor instability or
hyperreflexia cause the bladder to contract unintentionally
• Symptoms Frequency, overwhelming desire to void (often precipitated
by stressful event), large loss, nocturia
• Causes Idiopathic, neurological problems (stroke, MS, DM, spinal cord
injury, dementia, PD), local irritation (bladder stones, bladder cancer,
infection), obstruction (BPH), surgery (TURP)
• Treatment Bladder training—resist the urge to pass urine for i
periods. Start with an achievable interval based on diary evidence
and i slowly—continue for >6wk. If bladder training is ineffective, try
oxybutinin first-lineN (alternatives: darifenacin, solifenacin, tolteridone,
trospium). Spontaneously remits/relapses, so reassess every 3–4mo
Overflow Constant dribbling loss day and night. Causes: BPH, prostate cancer,
urethral stricture, faecal impaction, neurological (LMN lesions), side effect of
medication. Treatment is aimed at relieving the obstruction (b p. 454).
Urinary fistula Communication between bladder and the outside—normally
through the vagina. Results in constant dribbling loss day and night. Refer to
gynaecology/urology. Causes: congenital, malignancy, complication of surgery.
Functional incontinence No urological problem. Caused by other factors,
e.g. inaccessible toilets/immobility, behavioural problems, cognitive deficit.
Treat the cause.

Renal medicine and urology

Aids and appliances for incontinence
Pads Many different types. DNs or continence advisors are best aware
of those available via the NHS locally. They are not available on FP10
and supplied by local NHS Trusts on a ‘daily allowance’ basis. This varies
across the country.

Bed covers Absorb 1–4L of urine. Good laundry facilities are needed. If
left wet can cause skin breakdown. Available via NHS Trusts.
Sheaths or external catheters Can be prescribed on NHS prescrip-

tion. Approved appliances are listed in part IXB of the UK Drug Tariff.
Used for men who have intractable incontinence and who are highly
physically dependent, do not have urine retention and do not require an
internal catheter. Assessment and fitting by a DN or continence adviser
is essential.
Used in association with a drainage bag. Sheaths may be non-adhesive,
self-adhesive or attached with adhesive strips. Adhesive sheaths can last
several days but daily changing is recommended. Replace non-adhesive
sheaths 2–3x/d (some are reusable).
Problems Include i susceptibility to UTI, sores on penis, and skin irritation due to the adhesive.

Catheters Can be prescribed on NHS prescription. Approved appliances are listed in part IXA of the UK Drug Tariff.

Indwelling catheters Only use catheters in patients who have:
•
•
•
•
•

Urinary retention or neurogenic bladder dysfunction
Severe pressure sores
Inoperable obstructions that prevent the bladder emptying
Terminal illness
Housebound without adequate carer support

Types Only long-term Foley catheters are suitable for use in primary care.
They last 3–12wk.
Catheter size Unless specified a 12 or 14Ch catheter is supplied. Use
the smallest diameter of catheter that drains urine effectively. Catheters
>16Ch are more likely to cause bypassing of urine around the catheter
and urethral strictures.
Catheter length Men require longer catheters than women. Specify ‘male’
or ‘female’ on the prescription.
Catheter balloon 10mL balloons are supplied unless specified otherwise.
Pre-filled catheters contain sterile water which inflates the retaining balloon with water. They are more expensive but quicker to insert and there
are no costs for syringes or sterile water.
Insertion b p. 455
Drainage Usually attached to a leg bag, although catheter valves are also
available allowing the patient to use his/her bladder as a urine reservoir.
The valve must be released every 3–4h to drain out the urine.

Aids and appliances for incontinence

Common problems
• Leakage Check no constipation, check catheter not blocked, try
smaller gauge catheter
• Infection 90% develop bacteriuria <4wk after insertion. Always
confirm suspected UTI with MSU—only treat if symptomatic or
Proteus species grown. May prove difficult to eliminate. No good
evidence bladder instillations help
• Encrustation (50%) Deposition of minerals and other materials from
the urine onto the catheter. Worse if there is infection with Proteus
species. May cause catheter blockage or pain changing the catheter.
Check pH of urine regularly in patients with problems. Citric acid
patency solutions may help if pH >7.4, or a daily dose of vitamin C
• Inflammation Results from physical presence of a catheter in the urethra.
Exacerbated by encrustation and infection. There is no easy solution—try
a different brand catheter (e.g. hydrogel catheter rather than silicone)
• Blockage Change catheter. The interval of routine changes should
be altered if there is regular blockage towards the end of the life of a
catheter

Intermittent self-catheterization Patient inserts a catheter into

his/her bladder 4–5x/d to drain urine. d problems of infection and blockage. Useful for neurological bladder dysfunction. Types:
• Reusable silver or stainless steel
• Reusable PVC—washed and reused for 1wk. Usually supply 5/mo
• Single use—need 125–150/mo. Expensive. Only use on consultant advice

Collecting bags Can be prescribed on NHS prescription. Approved
appliances are listed in part IXB of the UK Drug Tariff.
• Leg bags Drainable bags last 5–7d. Usually 500/750mL. Larger capacity
bags are too heavy for mobile patients. A variety of attachment systems
are available on prescription. Long tubes are needed to wear a bag on
the calf
• Night drainage bags Connect to night bag attachment of day bags
Single use, disposable non-draining bags are recommended. Bag
hangers are not available on NHS prescription

Urinary tract obstruction
Causes of obstruction (See Figure 14.1) Obstruction may be unilateral

(kidney, pelvi-ureteric junction, or ureter) or bilateral (bladder, urethra, prostate). Unilateral obstruction may present late if the other kidney remains
functioning. Suspect if loin ache worsened by drinking. Confirm with USS and
refer to urology. Obstructing lesions may be in the lumen (e.g. stones) in the
wall (e.g. tumours) or impinging from outside (e.g. retroperitoneal fibrosis).

Acute retention of urine Sudden inability to pass urine l lower
abdominal discomfort with inability to keep still. Differentiate from AKI.
4 > 5. Risk factors: age >70y; symptoms of prostatism/poor urinary stream.
Causes Prostatic obstruction (82%); constipation; alcohol; drugs (anticholinergics, diuretics); UTI; operation (e.g. hernia repair). Rarer causes: urethral stricture; clot retention; spinal cord compression; bladder stone.
Examination Abdomen—palpable bladder; DRE—enlarged ± irregular
prostate; perineal sensation to exclude neurological cause.
Investigation MSU to exclude infection. Blood for U&E, Cr, and eGFR.
Only investigate if catheterizing in the community.
Management Catheterize (record initial volume drained) or refer to
urology for catheterization—local policies vary. Treat infection. Refer to
DN for instruction on management of the catheter. Refer to urology for
further assessment and treatment.

Chronic retention of urine Insidious onset. Causes: benign prostatic
hypertrophy; pelvic malignancy; CNS disease. May present as:
• Nocturnal enuresis
• Acute on chronic retention • UTI
•	Overflow incontinence • Lower abdominal mass
• Renal failure
Examination and investigation As for acute retention. Bladder is enlarged
(may contain >1.5L) but usually non-tender.
Management Refer to urology for further assessment and treatment.
Refer urgently or acutely if pain, UTI or renal failure (eGFR <60mL/
min/1.73m2). Do not catheterize in the community.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis Ureters become embedded in dense
fibrous plaques in the retroperitoneal space. Associations:
• Connective tissue disease
• Drugs, e.g. methysergide
• Raynaud’s syndrome
• Carcinoma
• Fibrotic diseases (e.g. alveolitis)
• Crohn’s disease
Presentation and management Typically middle-aged men presenting
with fever, malaise, sweating, leg oedema, i BP, palpable mass, and/or
acute/chronic renal failure. Refer for specialist care. Options include steroids and nephrostomies.

Horseshoe kidney Congenital abnormality. Kidneys are fused in the
midline to form a horseshoe-shaped mass. The kidney may function normally or may present with obstructive nephropathy or UTIs.

Passing a urethral catheter 0 Technique learned through supervised experience. Only attempt alone if you are competent to do so.
Prepare the equipment needed
• Sterile rubber gloves, plastic sheet to prevent spills, paper sheet to
provide sterile field, cleansing materials—cotton swabs, cleansing fluid
• Local anaesthetic/lubricating gel e.g. 1% lidocaine + 0.25% chlorhexidine
• Catheter—usually 12Ch or 14Ch; ensure the catheter is a long
catheter if catheterizing a man (b p. 452); and if the catheter is not
pre-filled—sterile syringe + 10mL of sterile water
• Kidney dish/other receptacle to catch the urine before connecting
the drainage bag; drainage tube and bag
Inserting the catheter
•	Ensure the patient is comfortable; protect against spills with a plastic
sheet; cover area with a sterile paper sheet
•	Ensure strict aseptic technique. Cleanse the penis/vulva and squeeze
lubricant/local anaesthetic gel into the urethra—allow to work
• Gently but firmly, push the catheter into the urethra. Ensure the end
of the catheter is over the receptacle. When the catheter enters
the bladder, urine flows into the receptacle. Inflate the balloon with
sterile water (if needed) once the catheter is inside the bladder.
Connect the catheter to the collecting tube and bag
• If male, pull the foreskin over the glans again to prevent paraphimosis
0 If you are unable to pass a catheter, refer to urology.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy
10–30% of men in their early 70s have symptomatic benign prostatic
hypertrophy (BPH). There is no relation between size of the prostate and
symptoms. Assessment—see Table 14.10.

Symptoms of prostatism
• Obstructive d and intermittent urinary stream, double micturition,
hesitancy, terminal dribbling, feeling of incomplete emptying, and
straining to void. Differential diagnosis: prostatic enlargement, strictures,
tumours, urethral valves, bladder neck contracture
• Irritative (due to detrusor muscle hypertrophy)—Urinary frequency,
urgency, dysuria, and nocturia. Differential diagnosis: enlarged prostate,
UTI, polydipsia, detrusor instability, hypercalcaemia, uraemia

Complications 10% at presentation:

•
•
•
•

• Chronic retention—b p. 454
Recurrent UTI
•	Overflow incontinence—b p. 451
Bladder stones
•	Obstructive nephropathy
Haematuria
Acute retention of urine (± prior obstructive symptoms)—b p. 454

GP management Symptoms can improve spontaneously but overall
progress slowly. 1–2%/y develop urinary retention. Options:
Watchful waiting Patients with mild to moderate symptoms at presentation, with no complications of BPH and who are not severely troubled
by their symptoms. Self-help includes: d evening fluid intake, d caffeine
intake, bladder retraining, and prevention of constipation.
Drug therapy Those with mild/moderate symptoms who are troubled by
their symptoms. Consider:
• α-adrenoceptor antagonists, e.g. prazosin, doxazosin—watch for
postural hypotension. d symptomatic worsening
• 5α-reductase inhibitors, e.g. finasteride—best for patients with bulky
prostates; takes up to 6mo to work. d risk of urinary retention
• Combination therapy—α-adrenoceptor agonist and 5α-reductase
inhibitor d progression by 66% more than either agent alone
0 Serenoa repens (saw palmetto) has no benefit over placeboC.

retention)—E/U
• Nodular/firm prostate on DRE—U
• Failure to respond to drug therapy after 3–12mo (α-blocker) or
6–12mo (5α-reductase inhibitor)—R

Acute bacterial prostatitis Consider in men presenting with suspected UTI. Other features: fever; arthralgia/myalgia; low back, perineal,
penile ± rectal pain. DRE reveals swollen, tender prostate. If suspected,
check MSU and treat with 4wk course of oral antibiotic which penetrates
prostatic tissue, e.g. ciprofloxacin 500mg bd, ofloxacin 200mg bd. Refer
for specialist advice if not settling. Complications include: acute retention of
urine, chronic bacterial prostatitis, and prostate abscess.

Benign prostatic hypertrophy

Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing There is no prostate

screening programme in the UK but men can request a PSA test. The
government has introduced a PSA Informed Choice Programme. Warn
patients about the poor specificity of the test, before performing the test
and provide information about the pros and cons of testing.
In addition, PSA is routinely measured in men with urological symptoms.
Abnormal PSA is a common reason for referral to a urologist. Its sensitivity and specificity are poor.
Pros and cons of PSA testing
Benefits of PSA testing
• It may provide reassurance if the
test result is normal
• It may find cancer before
symptoms develop and at an early
stage when treatments could be
beneficial
• If treatment is successful, the
consequences of more advanced
cancer are avoided

Reasons for increased PSA
• Prostate cancer
• Benign prostatic hypertrophy
• Acute or chronic prostatitis
• Physical exercise
• Acute urinary retention

Downside of PSA testing
•	It can miss cancer and provide
false reassurance
• It may lead to unnecessary
anxiety and medical tests when
no cancer is present
• It might detect slow-growing
cancer that may never cause any
symptoms or shortened lifespan
• The main treatments of prostate
cancer have significant side
effects, and there is no certainty
that treatment will be successful
• Prostate instrumentation
(includes prostate biopsy and
urinary catheterization)
•	Old age

0 PSA may be normal when early prostate cancer is present.
Performing a PSA test Digital rectal examination may cause a transient i
in PSA levels (X), so do the PSA test before doing a digital rectal examination. If that is not possible, delay the test for 1wk after the examination.
Exclude urinary infection before PSA testing. Do NOT do a PSA test if
the man has:
• A proven UTI—treat the UTI and postpone the PSA test for ≥1mo
•	Ejaculated within 48h
•	Exercised vigorously in the previous 48h
• Had a prostate biopsy <6wk ago

Renal medicine and urology

Prostate cancer
Prostate cancer is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. It is the
second most common cancer affecting men and 10,720 men/y die from the
disease in the UK. 1 in 6 men have clinical prostate cancer in their lifetime
and the incidence is rising.

Classification
Non-metastatic prostate cancer
Can be divided into:
• Clinically localized disease—cancer thought, after clinical examination,
to be confined to the prostate gland
• Locally advanced disease—cancer that has spread outside the capsule
of the prostate gland but has not yet spread to other organs
Metastatic prostate cancer Cancer that has spread outside the prostate
gland to local, regional, or systemic LNs, seminal vesicles, or other body
organs (e.g. bone, liver, brain).

Risk factors
• Age Uncommon <50y; 85% are diagnosed aged >65y
• Genetic i incidence if first-degree relative affected
• Racial Incidence varies according to location in the world and ethnic
group. Highest rates are in men of black ethnic group in the USA—
lowest in Chinese men
• Dietary Links are proposed between prostate cancer, low intake of
fruit (particularly tomatoes) and high intake of fat, meat, and Ca2+
Screening A large-scale trial of screening for prostate cancer is underway in the UK. Problems with screening:
• Incidental post-mortem evidence of prostate cancer is high (775% men
>75y); very few become clinically evident, so many more men would
be found with prostate cancer by screening than would die or have
symptoms from it
• Natural history of prostate cancer is not understood—there is no
means to detect which ‘early’ cancers become more widespread
• Inadequate screening tests
• It is not clear if early treatment enhances life expectancy
• Peak incidence of morbidity and mortality is in old age (75–79y), so
potential years of life saved by screening are small
Screening tests
• Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) b p. 459
• Digital rectal examination (DRE) Operator-dependent, fails to detect
early prostate cancers, and lacks specificity. Annual screening in the
USA and Germany has not d mortality
• Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) Too expensive
The most effective screening regime involves rectal examination and PSA
testing followed by TRUS for suspicious lesionsS. Optimal screening interval is unknown but serial screening does i detection.

Symptoms and signs
Early cancer Symptomless. Usually detected following an incidental finding of i PSA. Hard nodule sometimes felt in prostate on DRE.

Prostate cancer

Local disease
• Prostatism
• Urinary retention
• Haematuria

• Lower extremity oedema
•	On rectal examination, the prostate is hard
and non-tender and sulci lose definition

Metastatic disease
• Malaise
• Weight loss
• Bone pain
• Pathological fractures

• Spinal cord compression
• Ureteric obstruction may cause
renal failure
• Signs depend on site of metastases

InvestigationN A digital rectal examination and PSA test (after counselling) are recommended for patients with any of the following unexplained
symptoms:
• Inflammatory or obstructive
•	Erectile dysfunction
lower urinary tract symptoms
• Haematuria
• Weight loss, especially in the
• Lower back pain
elderly
• Bone pain
0 Exclude UTI before PSA testing and postpone digital rectal examination until after the PSA test is done.

Urgent referralN
• Rectal examination—hard, irregular prostate typical of prostate
cancer. PSA result should accompany the referral
• Rectal examination—normal prostate, but rising/raised age-specific
PSA ± lower urinary tract symptoms*
• Symptoms and high PSA levels
• Asymptomatic men with borderline, age-specific PSA results repeat
PSA after 1–3mo. If the PSA level is rising, refer the patient urgently
* Consider discussion with specialist and patient ± carer before referral for very elderly
patients/those compromised by other co-morbidities.

0 Referral is not needed if the prostate is simply enlarged and the PSA is
in the age-specific reference range.

Renal medicine and urology

Treatment of prostate cancer
Symptomless local disease Treatment is controversial. There are

two arguments:

Benefits of treatment
are outweighed by risks

or

Aggressive treatment before spread
is the only way to ensure cure

>50% of men >50y who die from other causes are found post-mortem
to have prostate cancer—prostate cancer kills only a small minority of
men who have it. The personal and economic cost of treating men whose
cancer would never have caused them any problems must be considered.
Options
• Watchful waiting or active surveillance Monitor with PSA and
regular rectal examination. i in PSA or size of nodule triggers active
treatment. At 10y follow-up <10% with moderately well-differentiated
cancer will have died from their cancer. Progression rates are higher
in patients with poorly differentiated cancer. Some men find the
uncertainty of waiting difficult to cope with
• Radical prostatectomy Has potential for cure, but in the age group
most affected by prostate cancer mortality is 1.4%. Other common
complications: impotence (50%), incontinence (25%)
• Radiotherapy May not be effective—persistent cancer is found in 30%
on biopsy. Brachytherapy (radioactive treatment in implanted seeds or
wires) has proven efficacy in early prostate cancer
• Hormone treatment No convincing evidence that this gives survival
benefit in early disease
• Others Minimally invasive treatments, e.g. cryotherapy and microwave
therapy, are as yet unproven

Symptomatic disease 30% 5y survival. Hormone manipulation is the

mainstay of treatment and gives 80% d in bone pain, PSA, or both, and a
lower incidence of serious complications (e.g. spinal cord compression) if
treatment starts at the time of diagnosis. Options:
Luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues (e.g. goserelin) sc injection every 4–12wk (depending on the preparation used).
Testosterone levels d to levels of castrated men in <2mo. Side effects:
impotence, hot flushes, gynaecomastia, local bruising, and infection around
injection site. When starting LHRH analogues, LH level initially i which can
cause increased tumour activity or ‘flare’. Counteracted by prescription of
anti-androgens (e.g. flutamide) for a few days before administration of the
first dose of LHRH and concurrently for 3wk. Response in most patients
lasts for 12–18mo.
Anti-androgens (e.g. cyproterone actetate, flutamide, bicalutamide). Do
not suppress androgen production completely. Used to prevent side
effects due to testosterone flare during initiation of LHRH analogues, as
monotherapy (e.g. bicalutamide 150mg od) and in combination with LHRH
analogues to produce maximum androgen blockade.
Surgical castration d testosterone secretion permanently without the
need for medication. However, rarely used.

Treatment of prostate cancer

Bony metastases In addition to hormone therapy, local radiotherapy

and corticosteroids are used for bone pain. Radioactive strontium d the
number of new sites of bone pain developed. Mean survival <5y.
Hormone-resistant disease No agreed treatment. Involve the
multidisciplinary team-including urology, oncology, and palliative care.
Dexamethasone 0.5mg daily or docetaxel may be helpful.

Renal medicine and urology

Conditions of the penis
Posterior urethral valves Folds of mucosa inhibit or
block passage of urine causing urethral, bladder, ureter, and
renal pelvis dilatation.
Presentation Usually detected on antenatal USS. Can present in neonates with urinary retention or dribbling urine + distended bladder, UTI
or uraemia, or later in childhood with recurrent UTI or incontinence.
Investigation and management MCUG confirms diagnosis. In all cases
refer to urology for surgical disruption of the valves.

Hypospadias 1 in 400 male births. The urethral meatus opens on
the ventral side of the penis. There is often hooding of the foreskin and
ventral flexion of the penis. Refer to urology. Treated with corrective
surgery, ideally preschool.
Non-retractile foreskin Usually noted by parents. May be history
of recurrent balanitis. Examination: foreskin adherent.
Management Age <4y—do nothing unless recurrent balanitis. If >4y
and/or recurrent balanitis, consider treatment with topical steroids (e.g.
betamethasone 0.1% od) for 3–4mo. If ineffective, refer to paediatric
surgery for circumcision.

Phimosis Foreskin obstructs urine flow. Common in small children. Time usually obviates the need for circumcision. Treat as for
non-retractile foreskin if recurrent balanitis.
Peyronie’s disease Hard lumps in the shaft of the penis. Unknown

cause. 4% 4 >40y. 1 in 3 have pain/bending of the penis when erect.
Associated with erectile dysfunction (b p. 776). 5% have Dupuytren’s
contracture. F.G. de la Peyronie (1678–1747)—French surgeon.
Management Reassurance usually suffices. No proven medical treatments. Refer to urology for surgery if pain or severe bending on erection
so that intercourse is not possible.

Paraphimosis Foreskin is retracted then (because of oedema) unable to

be replaced. Commonly occurs in catheterized patients when the catheter
is changed.

Management Try to replace foreskin using ice packs (d swelling) and lubrication (e.g. KY jelly). If unable to replace the foreskin, admit for surgery.

Balanitis Acute inflammation of glans and foreskin. Common organisms—staphylococci, streptococci, coliforms, candida. Can occur at any
age. Most common in young boys when associated with non-retractile
foreskin/phimosis. In elderly patients consider DM.
Management Oral antibiotics (e.g. flucloxacillin) or topical antifungals
(e.g. clotrimazole). If recurrent or secondary to phimosis consider referral
for circumcision.

Conditions of the penis

Balanitis xerotica et obliterans Chronic fibrosing condition of the foreskin
which may become adherent to the glans. Treatment is with topical steroid creams, e.g betamethasone 0.1%. Consider referral for circumcision.

Trauma to the foreskin Torn frenulum—seen after poorly lubricated intercourse or if caught in a zip. No treatment required. If recurrent,
consider referral for circumcision.
Erectile dysfunction b p. 776
Priapism Persistent painful erection not related to sexual desire.
Cause Medication for erectile dysfunction, idiopathic, leukaemia, sickle
cell disease, or pelvic tumour.
Management Ask the patient to climb stairs (arterial ‘steal’ phenomenon), apply ice packs. If unsuccessful refer to A&E for aspiration of corpora. Rarely surgery is needed.

Erythroplasia of Queryat Pre-malignant condition of glans. Moist
velvety-looking patches. Refer to urology. Treatment is surgical.
Carcinoma of the penis Squamous cell carcinoma (95%) or malignant
melanoma. Usually elderly men. Rare in the UK.
ManagementN Refer urgently patients with symptoms or signs of penile
cancer. These include:
• Progressive ulceration in the glans, prepuce, or skin of the penile shaft
• Mass in the glans, prepuce, or skin of the penile shaft
0 Lumps within the corpora cavernosa can indicate Peyronie’s disease,
which does not require urgent referral.

Penile discharge Associated with urethritis, e.g. due to chlamydia or
gonorrhoea. Refer to GUM clinic.

Testicular disease
Testicular pain Treat the cause:

•	Epididymo-orchitis
• Torsion of the testis
• Trauma and haematoma formation

• Varicocele
• Testicular tumour (rarely
painful)

Torsion of the testis Peak age 15–30y. Presents with sudden onset
of severe scrotal pain. May be associated with right iliac fossa pain,
nausea, and vomiting. Examination: tender, hard testis riding higher than
contralateral testis. Admit urgently to surgical/urology team.
Torsion of the hydatid of Morgagni Small embryological remnant
at the upper pole of the testis. Presents similarly to torsion of the testis.
Refer as an emergency to exclude torsion of the testis.

Epididymo-orchitis Inflammation of the testis and epididymis due to
infection. May occur at any age. The most common viral cause is mumps.
The most common bacterial causes are chlamydia or gonococci (<35y)
and coliforms (>35y). Chronic infection with TB or syphilis is rare.
Presentation Acute onset pain in testis; swelling and tenderness of testis/
epididymis; fever ± rigors; may be urethritis, dysuria, and/or i frequency.
Management May be difficult to distinguish from torsion of the testis. If in
doubt, admit for urology/surgical opinion. Otherwise investigate and treat
for the underlying cause.
Testicular lumps and swellings See Figure 14.2.
Hydrocele Collection of fluid in the tunica vaginalis. Occurs at any age.
• p hydrocele—no predisposing cause in scrotum
• s hydrocele—reaction to pathology in testis or covering (infection,
tumour, torsion). In adults presenting with hydrocele always consider
impalpable tumour beneath
Presentation Swelling in the scrotum. The examiner should be able to get
above the swelling. Smooth surface, transilluminates; testis is within the
swelling and not palpable separately.
Management Investigation is not required in children; refer adults for
USS if testis is not palpable. Options for adults:
• Conservative management—reassurance; small hydroceles
• Tapping—may be suitable for large hydroceles where surgery is
inappropriate; s infection and recurrence are common
• Surgery—refer to urologist
Hydroceles in children are usually congenital. May be unilateral
or bilateral. Most resolve spontaneously in the first year of life.
Refer to urology if persists >1y.

Hydrocele of the cord Arises in part of the processus vaginalis in the

spermatic cord above the testis. Rounded lump which slips up and down
the inguinal canal. No action needed.

Renal medicine and urology

Haematocele Damage to the testis (e.g. due to a direct blow, vasectomy) can result in the testis rupturing and the tunica vaginalis filling with
blood. Refer as an emergency for urological assessment.
Varicocele Collection of varicose veins in the pampiniform plexus of
the cord and scrotum. Can be s to obstruction of the testicular veins in
the abdomen. L > R. Associated with infertility (thought due to i temperature of testis). Presents with a dull ache in the testis especially at the end
of the day or after exercise. Usually visible when the patient is standing.
No treatment is needed—reassure. Occasionally surgery or radiological
embolization may help if symptoms are severe.
Epididymal cyst Common and often multiple. Found in middle-aged/
elderly men. Usually presents when the patient finds a painless lump.
• Examination Smooth-walled cyst in epididymis (palpable above and
behind testis), often bilateral
• Investigation If unsure of diagnosis refer for USS
• Management Reassurance. Refer to urology if painful
Spermatocele Cyst containing sperm. Typically situated in the head of
the epididymis—more rarely in the spermatic cord. Clinically presents in
the same way as epididymal cyst. Management is the same.
Testicular gumma b p. 749
Benign testicular tumours Rare (<2% tumours). Sertoli cell adenomas; Leydig cell adenomas. Produce sex hormones and cause feminization/
masculinization respectively. Refer.

Testicular cancer Most common malignancy in men age 20–34y.

Devastating disease as sufferers tend to be young and fit and do not
expect to be ill. Screening is not effective. Education to ensure men check
their testes for lumps regularly and present early is preferable.
Risk factors Undescended testes—bilateral undescended testis l 10x
i risk; past history of testicular cancer—4% risk second cancer.
Presentation Painless lump in testis; occasionally testicular pain or hydrocele; may present with metastases—back pain/dyspnoea.
Management Testicular lumps are tumours until proven otherwise. Refer
for urgent urological opinion. USS can help diagnosis but do not delay
referral. Definitive diagnosis is only made at biopsy. Specialist treatment
depends on tumour type and extent (see Table 14.13). Sperm banking is
routinely offered in case of d fertility due to treatment.
0 Children conceived of men treated for testicular cancer are not at
i risk of congenital abnormality.

Empty scrotum If the scrotum has never contained a testis, it is hypo-

plastic. If the scrotum has contained a testis in the past, it is normally
developed but empty.
Causes of an empty scrotum Undescended or retractile testis; surgical
removal, e.g. for torsion, trauma, or tumour; testicular atrophy (e.g. due
to mumps or trauma); ambiguous genitalia; testicular agenesis—diagnosis
of exclusion.

Fournier’s gangrene Necrotizing fasciitis of the scrotal skin and/or
penis. Patients are usually elderly and often have a hydrocele. Starts as
a black spot and spreads rapidly. Early diagnosis is critical to survival so,
if suspected admit as an acute urological emergency. Treatment is with
surgical debridement and IV antibiotics.
Undescended testis Affects 2–3% of 4 neonates—but

most descend during the first year. Refer those that do not
for surgical descent/fixation to avoid i risk of malignancy and
later infertility.
Retractile testis Usually young boys with active cremasteric reflex.
No treatment needed.
Examination Scrotum is usually well developed. Try to find the testis,
and milk it down into scrotum. May be found anywhere from the
scrotum to the internal inguinal ring. If not found or you are unable to
bring the testis down into the scrotum assume it is undescended.

Musculoskeletal problems

Symptoms of musculoskeletal disease
Bone pain Consider:
• Fracture Due to injury, stress fracture, or pathological fracture
• Arthritis Referred pain from affected joints
• Malignancy Primary bone malignancy, haematological malignancy, e.g.
multiple myeloma, or secondaries (usually from breast, prostate, lung,
thyroid, kidney—more rarely bowel, melanoma)
• Benign bone tumour
• Osteomyelitis
• Metabolic causes, (e.g. hypercalcaemia)
Pain in one joint Common. Ask:
Is the problem articular or periarticular?
• Articular disease (e.g. osteoarthritis) is suggested by joint line
tenderness and pain at the end of the range of movement in any
direction
• Periarticular problems (e.g. ligamentous injury)—point tenderness over
the involved structure and pain exacerbated by movements
If articular Is the problem inflammatory or mechanical? Look for:
• Signs of inflammation—warmth, redness, effusions; may indicate joint
infection or inflammatory arthritis
• Features of a mechanical problem—locking or catching, e.g.
cartilage tear
If periarticular Which structure is causing pain? Options: bursa; tendon;
tendon sheath; ligament; soft tissue.
• Red flags Features which should prompt early/urgent referral:
• Inflamed joint with associated fever or constitutional disturbance—
beware of infection
• Any joint which is ‘locked’ or so painful that movement is impossible
• Severe pain at rest or at night
• Pain that gets relentlessly worse over a period of days or weeks

Pain in multiple joints
• Differentiate between articular or periarticular disease, and whether
the condition is inflammatory or not as for pain in one joint. Screening
with blood tests (ESR or CRP, FBC ± autoimmune profile) may help
• Look for the pattern of disease—joint sites involved and other
symptoms/signs

• Severe systemic symptoms—high fevers, significant weight loss, or a
very ill patient (suggests rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, or malignancy)
• Focal systemic signs, e.g. rashes, nodules, or GI disturbances
• Severe pain and/or inability to function

Myalgia Isolated myalgia can be a result of overuse or soft tissue injury.
Generalized myalgia is associated with many diseases including:
• PMR (shoulder and hip girdle)
• Infection
• Vasculitis e.g. Wegener’s
• Statin use (check CK)
granulomatosis, PAN
• Fibromyalgia
• Chronic fatigue syndrome
Dystonia b p. 546
Short stature b p. 892
Tall stature b p. 893
Chest deformity b p. 298
Children with musculoskeletal pain of unknown
cause Take a history and examine carefully. Investigate

further with FBC, blood film, and ESR ± X-ray if bone pain,
rest pain, or persistent or unexplained back painN. If no cause is found,
treatment is with analgesia and reassurance. Advise to return for
reassessment ± orthopaedic referral if pain worsens, continues >6wk,
changes in nature, or other symptoms develop.

Nocturnal musculoskeletal pains (growing pains) Episodic,
muscular pains, usually in the legs, lasting 730min and waking the child
from sleep. Rubbing the limb brings rapid relief. There is no pain or
disability in the morning. Diagnosis can be made on history if there are
no associated symptoms and examination is normal. If in doubt, check
FBC and ESR—which should be normal. In most cases reassurance
± analgesia are all that is needed. In resistant cases, physiotherapy
may help.

Musculoskeletal problems

Neck pain
• Neck trauma Any significant cervical trauma requires neck immobil­

ization with a hard collar and referral to A&E for cervical spine X-rays to
exclude vertebral fracture or instability that could threaten the spinal cord.

Neck pain is common (lifetime incidence 50%) and contributes to 2% of
GP consultations. Prevalence is highest in middle age. Most neck pain is
acute and self-limiting (within days/weeks) but 1 in 3 have symptoms lasting >6mo or recurring pain.

History
•
•
•
•
•

Pain—onset, site, radiation, aggravating and relieving factors, timing
Stiffness—timing (continuous? worse in the mornings?)
Deformity (e.g. torticollis)—onset, changes
Neurological symptoms—numbness, paraesthesiae, weakness
Other symptoms—weight loss, bowel/bladder dysfunction, sweats

0 Pain is often poorly localized and neck problems commonly present
with shoulder pain and/or headache (cervicogenic headache).

Examination
• Look Posture; deformity, e.g. torticollis, asymmetry of scapulae; arms
and hands—wasting, fasciculation? Leg weakness?
• Feel Tenderness? Midline tenderness may be due to supraspinous
or spinous process damage following a whiplash injury. Paraspinal
tenderness ± spasm radiating into the trapezius ± crepitation is
common with cervical spondylosis
• Move/measure Normal ranges: flexion/extension—130o total
range; lateral flexion—45o in each direction from a neutral position;
rotation—80o in each direction from a neutral position
• Neurology Weakness in the upper limbs in a segmental distribution,
with loss of dermatomal sensation and altered reflexes indicates a
root lesion (see Table 15.1). If cervical cord compression is suspected,
examine the lower limbs looking for upgoing plantars and hyperreflexia
Cervical spondylosis Degenerative disease of the cervical spine can
cause pain, but minor changes are normal (especially >40y) and usually
asymptomatic. Pain is generally intermittent and related to activity.
Examination reveals d neck mobility. Severe degeneration can cause nerve
root signs. Treat with analgesia ± cervical collar. X-ray only if conservative
measures fail, troublesome pain, nerve root signs, or the patient has
psoriasis (? psoriatic arthropathy).
Nerve root irritation or entrapment Secondary to degeneration,
vertebral displacement/collapse, disc prolapse, local tumour, or abscess.
Causes neck stiffness, pain in arms or fingers, d reflexes, sensory loss, and
d power. The level of entrapment can usually be determined clinically
(see Table 15.1). Treat with analgesia ± cervical collar. X-ray cervical
spine—lateral or oblique views. Refer for physiotherapy. Refer for further
investigations (e.g. MRI) if conservative management fails and there is
objective evidence of a root lesion.

• Refer urgently if there are signs of spinal cord compression:
• Root pain and lower motor neurone signs at the level of the lesion, and
• Spastic weakness, brisk reflexes, upgoing plantars, loss of
coordination and sensation below the lesion
Spasmodic torticollis (wry neck) Common. Sudden onset of painful stiff neck due to spasm of trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles.
Self-limiting. Heat, gentle mobilization, muscle relaxants, and analgesia
can speed recovery. A cervical collar may help in the short term but can
prolong symptoms. Often caused by poor posture, e.g. computer-seating
position; carrying heavy, uneven loads.
Cervical rib Congenital condition of C7 vertebra costal process
enlargement. Usually asymptomatic but can cause thoracic outlet
compression l hand or forearm pain, weakness or numbness, and thenar
or hypothenar wasting. Radial pulse may be weak. X-ray of thoracic outlet
may show cervical rib—but symptoms are sometimes due to fibrous bands
that are not seen on X-ray. Refer to upper limb orthopaedic surgeon for
further assessment.
Whiplash injuries Neck pain resulting from stretching or tearing of
cervical muscles and ligaments due to sudden extension of the neck—often
due to a RTA. Pain and d neck mobility typically starts several hours or days
after injury. Pain may radiate to shoulders, arms, and head.
Management Examine carefully to exclude bony tenderness requiring
X-ray. Treat with analgesia and early mobilization—collar may help
initially but avoid long-term use. Recovery is often slow and 40% patients
suffer long-lasting symptoms. As a general rule of thumb, the quicker
the symptoms develop, the longer they will take to disappear. Early
physiotherapy, if available, can improve recovery rate. Psychological
problems and medicolegal issues can affect progress.

Musculoskeletal problems

Low back pain
Definitions
• Acute low back pain New episode of low back pain of <6wk duration.
Common—lifetime prevalence 58%
• Chronic low back pain Back pain lasting >3mo
Causes of back pain See Table 15.2.
History Ask:
• Circumstances of pain—history of injury; duration
• Nature/severity of pain—pain/stiffness mainly at rest/at night, easing
with movement suggests inflammation, e.g. discitis, spondylarthropathy
• Associated symptoms—numbness, weakness, bowel/bladder symptoms
• PMH—past illnesses (e.g. cancer), previous back problems
• Exclude pain not coming from the back (e.g. GI or GU pain)

Examination
• Deformity, e.g. kyphosis (typical of ankylosing spondylitis), loss of
lumbar lordosis (common in acute mechanical back pain), scoliosis
• Palpate for tenderness, step deformity, and muscle spasm
• Assess flexion, extension, lateral flexion, and rotation whilst standing
• Ask to lie down—this gives a good indication of severity of symptoms
• In lower limbs look for muscle wasting and check power, sensory loss, and
reflexes (knee jerk and ankle jerk). See Table 15.3. Assess straight leg raise
(SLR)—sciatica is present if SLR on one side elicits back/buttock pain (usually
ipsilateral but can be either side) compared to SLR on the other side

• ‘Red flags’

•
• <20 or >55y
• Non-mechanical pain
• Pain that worsens •
•

• Weight d
• Widespread
neurology (see
Table 15.3)
• Structural deformity

Management of acute pain in the community Triage according

to history and examination—see Figure 15.1, b p. 479.

For patients who do not require immediate referral Prescribe analgesia,
e.g. paracetamol ± NSAIDs ± amitriptyline (10–25mg nocte) and use the
Keele STarT back screening tool (see Box 15.1):
• If total score ≤3, explain likely natural history of the pain and advise to
avoid bed rest and maintain normal activities as far as possible
(d chance of chronic pain). Suggest self-help exercises
• If total score is ≥4, check question 5–9 sub-score:
• If ≤3—if not resolved in 4wk, refer for physical therapy. Options
include: back exercise classes, physiotherapy, chiropractic,
osteopathy, or acupuncture, if available.
• If ≥4—if not resolved in 4wk, refer directly for specialist
intervention, sooner if worsening or severe pain
• In all cases, challenge any ‘yellow flag’ factors (see Figure 15.1, b
p. 479) that may inhibit recovery and delay return to normal functioning

Box 15.1 Keele STarT Back Pain Scoring Tool
Ask patients to consider the following statements and state whether
they agree or disagree with them. Thinking about the past 2wk:
1. My back pain has spread down my leg(s) at some time in the last 2wk
2. I have had pain in the shoulder or neck at some time in the last 2wk
3. I have only walked short distances because of my back pain
4. In the last 2wk, I have dressed more slowly than usual because of
back pain
5. It’s not really safe for a person with a condition like mine to be
physically active
6. Worrying thoughts have been going through my mind a lot of the time
7. I feel that my back pain is terrible and it’s never going to get any better
8. In general I have not enjoyed all the things I used to enjoy
If the patient agrees with a statement, score 1; if disagrees, score 0.
9. Overall, how bothersome has your back pain been in the last 2wk?
• Not at all, slightly, or moderately—score 0
• Very much or extremely—score 1

chapter 15

Musculoskeletal problems

0 Do not X-ray for back pain routinely X-rays require a high radiation
dose, and clinically meaningful findings are rare. Exceptions:
•	Young (<25y)—X-ray SI joints to exclude ankylosing spondylitis
• Elderly—if vertebral collapse/malignancy suspected
• History of trauma

Cauda equina syndrome Compression of the cauda equina below
L2, e.g. by disc protrusion at L4/5. Presents with:
• Numbness of the buttocks and backs of thighs
•	Urinary/faecal incontinence
• Lower motor neurone weakness:
• L4—loss of dorsiflexion of the foot (and toes—L4/5)
• S1—loss of ankle reflex, plantarflexion, and eversion of the foot
Management Refer/admit as a neurological emergency. Rapid surgical
intervention i the chance of full motor and sphincter recovery.
Spinal cord compression Affects 5% of cancer patients—70% in
the thoracic region. Maintain a high level of suspicion if history of cancer
and new back pain—especially if known bony metastases or tumour
likely to metastasize to bone. Presents with:
• Back pain, worse on movement—often appears before neurology
• Neurological symptoms/signs—can be non-specific, e.g. constipation,
weak legs, urinary hesitancy. Lesions above L1 (lower end of spinal
cord) produce upper motor neurone signs (e.g. i tone/reflexes) and
a sensory level; lesions below L1 produce lower motor neurone signs
(d tone/reflexes) and perianal numbness (cauda equina syndrome)
Management Prompt treatment (<24–48h from first neurological
symptoms) is needed; once paralysed, <5% walk again. Treat with oral
dexamethasone 16mg/d and refer for same-day assessment and surgery/
radiotherapy unless in final stages of disease.

Osteoporotic vertebral collapse b p. 508
Scoliosis Lateral curvature of the spine associated with rotation of ver-

tebrae ± ribs or wedging of vertebrae. Early treatment prevents progression and complications, e.g. cardiopulmonary disturbance. Causes:
• Idiopathic
• Infection—TB of spine
• Congenital (butterfly vertebra)
• Metabolic, e.g. bone dysplasias
• Neuromuscular problems, e.g. cerebral palsy, neurofibromatosis,
Friedreich’s ataxia, muscular dystrophy, polio
• Trauma l damage in vertebral growth plate and uneven growth
• Neoplasm 1°, 2°, or as a result of radiotherapy
Clinical features Difference in shoulder height; spinal curvature;
difference in the space between the trunk and upper limbs. 0 Scoliosis
which disappears on bending is postural and of no clinical significance.
Management In all cases where structural scoliosis is suspected, refer
for an orthopaedic opinion. If associated with pain, especially at night,
consider spinal tumour and refer urgently.

Musculoskeletal problems

Shoulder problems
History
• Pain and stiffness Joint pain is felt anteriorly and may radiate down the
arm; pain on top of the shoulder suggests acromioclavicular joint
problems or cervical spine disorders. 0 Pain in the shoulder may be
referred from the neck, heart, mediastinum, or diaphragm
• Deformity Swelling of the shoulder; prominence of the
acromioclavicular (AC) joint; winging of the scapula
• Loss of function Difficulty reaching behind back (e.g. doing up bra
strap), brushing hair, or dressing

Examination
• Look Posture; asymmetry; muscle wasting; swelling (large effusions can
be seen anteriorly); scars
• Feel Tenderness; warmth; swelling; crepitus
• Move/measure Compare sides. Check range of movement; complex
movements (e.g. scratching opposite scapula in 3 ways, hands behind
head, arm across front of chest to top of opposite shoulder); power
General rules Intra-articular disease—painful limitation of movement in
all directions; tendonitis—painful limitation of movement in one plane
only; tendon rupture or neurological lesions—painless weakness.

Adhesive capsulitis—p or s to DM or intrathoracic pathology
Inflammation—inflammatory arthritis (e.g. RA, psoriatic), infection
Osteoarthritis
Prolonged immobilization, e.g. hemiplegia, strapping after dislocation
Polymyalgia rheumatica
Shoulder OA Often occurs after a history of trauma. Less common than
knee or hip OA. Often associated with crystal-induced inflammation and
s causes of OA (e.g. gout, haemochromatosis). Imaging for synovitis (USS/
MRI) is important to rule out disease that may benefit from steroid injection.
Shoulder replacement may be considered in severe cases.
Frozen shoulder (adhesive capsulitis) Overdiagnosed in primary
care. Affects patients aged 40–60y. Painful, stiff shoulder with global
limitation of movement—notably external rotation. Pain is often worse
at night. Cause unknown, but i in diabetics and those with intrathoracic
pathology (MI, lung disease) or neck disease.
Management If not known to be diabetic, check fasting blood glucose.
NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and local steroid injection can all be helpful. May
take >1y to recover and long-term outcome is uncertain. If restricted
movements are slow to return consider orthopaedic referral.

Shoulder problems

Rotator cuff injury The shoulder is the most mobile joint in the body
and relies on the musculo-tendinous rotator cuff to maintain stability.
Disorders of the rotator cuff account for most shoulder pain.
• Acute tendinitis Often caused by excessive use/trauma in patients
<40y. Presents with severe pain in the upper arm. Patients hold the
arm immobile and are unable to lie on the affected side. Usually starts
to resolve spontaneously after a few days. In middle age can be caused
by inflammation around calcific deposits—requires steroid injection
• Rotator cuff tears May accompany subacromial impingement pain
and is difficult to diagnose clinically unless the tear is large—suspect if
impingement pain is recurrent. Refer
• Subacromial impingement Pain occurs in a limited arc of abduction
(60–120o—painful arc syndrome) or on internal rotation due to acromial
or ligament pressure on a damaged rotator cuff tendon. In patients
<40y, associated with glenohumeral instability from generalized
connective tissue laxity or labral injury. In older patients, often due to
chronic rotator cuff tendinitis or functional cuff weakness/tear
Investigations X-ray may show calcification of the supraspinatus tendon in
acute tendinitis and irregularities/cysts at the humeral greater tuberosity
if chronic cuff tendinitis.
Treatment Rest followed by mobilization and physiotherapy, NSAIDs,
and/or subacromial steroid injection (b p. 166). If conservative measures
fail refer for imaging, arthroscopy, and consideration for surgery.
Shoulder dislocation Usually due to fall on arm or shoulder—anterior dislocation is most common. Shoulder contour is lost (flattening of
deltoid) and the head of the humerus is seen as an anterior bulge. Axillary
nerve may be damaged l absent sensation on a patch below the shoulder.
Refer to A&E for X-ray and reduction. In young patients, 730% have recurrent dislocations afterwards due to labral tear. Dislocation is associated
with rotator cuff tear in 725% of elderly patients.
Recurrent dislocation Usually anterior and follows trauma—but 5%
recurrent dislocations are in teenagers with no trauma but general joint
laxity. Refer for specialist physiotherapy and consideration of surgery.
Acromioclavicular joint problems Pain on the top of the shoulder or
in the suprascapular area suggests a problem with the acromioclavicular (AC)
joint or neck. AC joint pain is usually due to trauma or OA—joint tenderness
and pain are present on palpation and passive horizontal adduction.
Management: NSAIDs ± local steroid injection.
Fractured clavicle b p. 1111
Cleido-cranial dysostosis Inherited autosomal dominant condition.
Part/all of the clavicle is missing and ossification of the skull is delayed—
sutures remain open. Associated with short stature. No treatment.
Rupture of the long head of biceps Discomfort in the arm on
lifting and a feeling of ‘something going’. A lump appears in the body of
biceps muscle on elbow flexion. May be associated with other shoulder
pathology. Management: exclude distal rupture of the tendon at the
elbow. Reassure. No treatment necessary.

Musculoskeletal problems

Elbow problems
History
• Pain and stiffness Joint pain is diffuse; pain well localized over the
medial or lateral epicondyles may be due to tendinitis
• Deformity Swelling? Nodules? Structural deformity?
• Loss of function May be limitation of flexion, extension, pronation,
and/or supination. This can affect function, e.g. causing difficulty eating
(can’t get hand to mouth) or with personal care
• Neurology Numbness and paraesthesiae distal to the elbow—
particularly in the ulnar nerve distribution

Examination
• Look Carrying angle (711o for 4 13o for 5). Effusion may be visible
either side of the olecranon. A discrete swelling over the olecranon
could be RA nodule, gouty tophus, olecranon bursa, or other nodule.
Check for muscle wasting
• Feel Tenderness? Swellings? Warmth? If indicated test neurology and
check pulses distal to the elbow
• Move Active and passive movements. Compare both sides. Normal
range is from 0o in full extension to 145o in full flexion. Check
pronation/supination. Normal range is 75o and 80o respectively

Tennis elbow and golfer’s elbow (epicondylitis) Common
extensor tendon inflammation at the epicondyle. Cause: repeated strain.
• Tennis elbow—tenderness over the lateral epicondyle and lateral
elbow pain on resisted wrist extension
• Golfer’s elbow—tenderness over the medial epicondyle and medial
elbow pain on resisted wrist pronation
Management Stop trigger movements if possible. Often settles with time
± NSAIDs. Recovery is speeded by local steroid injection (b p. 166),
although relapse is more common after injection. Physiotherapy may help,
as may an epicondylar clasp. Rarely referral for autologous blood injection
or surgical release is indicated.

Dislocated elbow Usually due to fall on outstretched hand with flexed
elbow. Ulna is displaced backwards, elbow is swollen and held in fixed
flexion. May have associated fracture. Refer to A&E for reduction.
Olecranon bursitis Traumatic bursitis due to repeated pressure on

the elbow. Pain and swelling over olecranon. Aspirate fluid from bursa
—send for microscopy to exclude sepsis and gout (request polarized light
microscopy). Fluid may reaccumulate—if sepsis has been excluded, inject
hydrocortisone to help settle. Refer septic bursitis for surgical drainage.

Ulnar neuritis Narrowing of the ulnar grove (from OA, RA, or
post-fracture) causes pressure on the ulnar nerve l ulnar neuropathy.
Clumsiness with the hand is often the first symptom, then weakness ±
wasting of hand muscles innervated by the ulnar nerve and d sensation
in the little finger and medial half of the ring finger. Rule out metabolic
and autoimmune causes of a mononeuritis and refer for consideration of
surgical decompression ± nerve conduction studies if entrapment is likely.

Elbow problems

Pulled elbow Common in children <5y. Traction injury to

unhelpful.

elbow causes subluxation of radial head. Often occurs when
the child is pulled up suddenly by the hand. Child will not use
the arm. No clinical signs. 4 > 5. Left arm > right. X-rays are

Management Apply anterior pressure with the thumb on the radial
head whilst supinating and extending the forearm. Immediate recovery
is seen after reduction.

Musculoskeletal problems

Wrist and hand problems
History
Wrist
• Pain/stiffness Pain is often well localized in the wrist. Five conditions
are associated with point tenderness: De Quervain’s disease; old
scaphoid fracture; carpometacarpal OA; Kienböck’s disease (avascular
necrosis of the lunate); tenosynovitis of the extensors. Wrist pain may
also be associated with RA, OA, and ganglia. Carpal tunnel syndrome
is associated with pain in the hand
• Deformity May be swelling of tendon sheaths or wrist. Bony deformity
is a late feature of arthritis or secondary to trauma
• Function Ask about weakness and numbness in the hand
Hand
• Pain/stiffness Pain from the hand is felt in the fingers and/or palm.
A diffuse ache may be referred from the neck, shoulder, or mediastinum
• Deformity May occur acutely, e.g. due to tendon rupture or slowly
due to bone or joint pathology. The pattern and symmetry of joint
involvement can be diagnostic
• Function Good hand function is essential for everyday tasks, e.g.
turning keys, doing buttons up, writing. Ask about limitations

Examination
Wrist
• Look Symmetry; swelling; deformity (ulnar deviation, volar subluxation;
rheumatoid nodules; ganglia); muscle wasting in forearm/hand
• Feel Temperature; nature of any swellings; tenderness of the
radiocarpal, midcarpal, or distal radio-ulnar joint
• Move/measure Range of movement (normal range—extension >75o,
flexion >75o, pronation >75o from the vertical, supination >80o from
the vertical); crepitation?
• Neurology Check for ulnar and median nerve function
Hand
• Look Posture of the hand; swellings (rheumatoid nodules; Heberden’s
and Bouchard’s nodes; ganglions; tophi); nail signs, e.g. pitting of
psoriasis; scars; deformity (mallet finger; swan neck deformity;
Boutonnière deformity; Dupuytren’s contracture); ulnar deviation. If
there is joint disease note distribution and whether it is symmetrical
• Feel Temperature; condition of the skin, e.g. dryness, sweating; nature
of swellings; muscle bulk, e.g. small muscles of the hand; tenderness
• Move/measure Ask the patient to make a fist, spread his fingers out,
and then test each individual joint. Then test opposition, pinch grip,
key grip, palmar grasp of ball, and practical tasks, e.g. picking up a coin

Fractures b p. 1111.
Ganglion Smooth, firm, painless swelling—usually around the wrist.
No treatment is needed unless causing local problems. May resolve
spontaneously; can be drained (large-bore needle)/excised but often recurs.

Wrist and hand problems

For all hand injuries Check for:
Nerve injury Can occur due to trauma or lacerations of the hand or
wrist. Examine sensory and motor function. Always ensure no other
structures are damaged before suturing skin wounds. Refer all nerve
injuries for specialist assessment and management—surgery can improve
the outcome considerably in some cases. Intensive hand physiotherapy
is important to regain function. Types of nerve injury:
• Neurapraxia Temporary loss of nerve conduction—often caused by
pressure causing ischaemia
• Axonotmesis Damage to the nerve fibre, but nerve tube is intact—
the chance of successful nerve regrowth and a good recovery is high
• Neurotmesis—Divided nerve—lack of guidance to the regrowing
fibrils gives d chance of a good recovery, and a neuroma may develop
Median nerve damage The median nerve controls grasp. Damage causes
inability to lift the thumb out of the plane of the palm (abductor pollicis
brevis failure) and loss of sensation over the lateral side of the hand.
Ulnar nerve damage Injury distal to the wrist causes a claw hand
deformity, loss of abduction/adduction of the fingers, and sensory loss
over the little finger and a variable area of the ring finger.
Radial nerve damage The radial nerve opens the fist—injury produces
wrist drop and variable sensory loss including the dorsal aspect of the
root of the thumb.
Tendon injury Can occur due to attrition or lacerations of the hand or
wrist. Examine hand function. Always ensure no other structures are damaged before suturing skin wounds. Extensor or flexor tendons can be
affected. Refer—primary surgical repair is usually the treatment of choice.
Vascular injury Can occur due to trauma/lacerations of the hand or
wrist. Check perfusion and temperature of fingers and examine pulses.
Ensure no other structures are damaged before suturing skin wounds.
Refer all vascular injuries for specialist assessment and management.
Work-related upper limb pain Work-related pain in the arm ±

wrist, e.g. due to keyboard use. Overuse syndrome. Often termed repetitive strain injury (RSI). Diagnosis of exclusion—no physical signs. Exclude
other conditions, e.g. carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), tennis elbow.
Management Reassure—condition is curable, continue work, but avoid
the aggravating activity, liaise with work to ensure evaluation of workstation
ergonomics. Gradually reintroduce activity. Physiotherapy may help.
Explore psychological and work-related issues. A multidisciplinary
approach is needed. 0 Work-related upper limb pain is a notifiable
industrial disease.
X Existence of RSI has been challenged—rigorous assessment often
reveals undiagnosed causes of pain.

Musculoskeletal problems

Complex regional pain disorder (also known as reflex sympathetic

dystrophy or algodystrophy). Pain ± vasomotor changes in a limb l loss
of function. Most common in the hand and wrist. Usually follows trauma—
but the trauma may be trivial and signs may appear weeks/months later.
Signs: pain at rest exacerbated by movement and light touch, swelling, discoloration, temperature changes, abnormal sensitivity, sweating, and loss
of function. X-ray may show osteopenia.
Management Physiotherapy improves prognosis if started early;
analgesia (NSAIDs, opioids, and/or nerve painkillers). Refer to pain clinic
or rheumatology for specialist treatments, e.g. nerve block, spinal cord
stimulation, CBT, and/or graded motor imagery.

Tenosynovitis Inflammation of the tendon sheath—often due to
unaccustomed activity (e.g. gardening). May affect extensor or flexor
tendons. Pain is often worse in the morning. Presents with swelling and
tenderness over the tendon sheath and pain on using the tendon. Treat
with rest and NSAIDs. If not settling, an injection of steroid into the
tendon sheath may help. 0 Notifiable industrial disease if work-related.
De Quervain’s tenosynovitis Tenosynovitis of thumb extensor and
abductor tendon sheaths. Pain over radial styloid and on forced adduction/
flexion of the thumb. Treat with thumb splint ± local steroid injection.
Refer if not settling. F. de Quervain (1868–1940)—Swiss surgeon.

Carpal tunnel syndrome Pain in the radial 3½ digits of the hand

± numbness, pins and needles, and thenar wasting. Due to compression
of the median nerve as it passes under the flexor retinaculum. Worse at
night. Symptoms are improved by shaking the wrist. Associations: pregnancy, hypothyroidism, DM, obesity, and carpal arthritis.
Investigations Phalen’s test—hyperflexion of wrist for 1min triggers
symptoms; Tinel’s test—tapping over the carpal tunnel causes paraesthesiae;
request nerve conduction studies if diagnosis is in doubt.
Management GP treatment—night splints may help ± carpal tunnel
steroid injection (b p. 166). Less likely to help if age >50y or symptoms
>10mo. If GP treatment fails, constant paraesthesiae and/or triggering of
fingers, refer to orthopaedics for division of the flexor retinaculum.

Kienböck’s disease The lunate bone develops patchy necrosis after
acute or chronic injury. The patient is usually a young adult complaining
of aching and stiffness of one wrist. Examination: tenderness in the centre
of the back of the wrist ± limitation of wrist extension. X-ray is normal
at first but later shows i density of the lunate ± deformity. Refer for
orthopaedic opinion. R. Kienböck (1871–1953)—Austrian radiologist.
Osteoarthritis in the hand
• Heberden’s nodes—swellings of DIP joints. No treatment needed
• Bouchard’s nodes—swellings of PIP joints. No treatment needed
First carpometacarpal OA Pain and swelling at the base of the thumb.
Thumb becomes stiff. A splint or steroid injection can be helpful. If pain
persists surgery (trapeziectomy) may help.

Wrist and hand problems

Dupuytren’s contracture Palmar fascia contracts so that the fingers
(typically the right fifth finger) cannot extend. Prevalence: 10% 4 > 65y
(more if family history). Less common in women. Associations: smoking;
alcohol; heavy manual labour; trauma; DM; phenytoin; Peyronie’s disease;
AIDS. Often simple reassurance suffices. Consider referral for surgery
(fasciotomy or fasciectomy) if MCP joint contracture >30° or PIP/DIP joint
contracture >10°. G. Dupuytren (1777–1835)—French surgeon.
Trigger finger Nodules on the tendon can occur spontaneously and in
RA and DM. Most common in ring and middle fingers. The nodule can be
palpated moving with the tendon. Pain and triggering (the finger is in fixed
flexion and needs to be flicked straight by the other hand) occur because
the nodule jams in the tendon sheath. Management: local steroid injection
or refer for surgical release.
Mallet finger The fingertip droops due to avulsion of the extensor
tendon attachment to the terminal phalanx (see Figure 15.2). Refer for
X-ray. Management: a plastic splint which holds the terminal phalanx
in extension is worn for 6wk to help union (must not be removed).
Arthrodesis may be needed if healing does not occur.
Gamekeeper’s thumb Forced thumb abduction causes rupture of the
ulnar collateral ligament. Can occur on wringing a pheasant’s neck—hence
the name, or, more commonly, by catching the thumb in the matting on a
dry ski slope. The thumb is very painful and pincer grip weak. Refer—open
surgical repair is the most effective treatment.
Nail injuries
Avulsed nail Protect the nail bed of an avulsed nail with soft paraffin and
gauze, check tetanus status, and give antibiotic prophylaxis (e.g. flucloxacillin 500mg qds for 7d). Partially avulsed nails need removing under ring
block to exclude an underlying nail bed injury—the nail is replaced to act
as a splint to the nail matrix.
Subungual haematoma A blow to the finger can cause bleeding under
the nail—very painful due to pressure build-up. Relieve by trephining a
hole through the nail using a 19 gauge needle (no force required; just twist
the needle as it rests vertically on the nail) or a heated point (e.g. of a
paper clip or cautery instrument). Of benefit up to 2d after injury.

Polydactyly Extra digits can vary from small fleshy tags to
complete duplications. They may be an isolated defect or
associated with syndromes. Small fleshy tags are removed in
the first few months. For extra digits that are firmly fixed or
involving tendons or joints, surgery is delayed until the child is >1y.
Refer to orthopaedics or plastic surgery.
Syndactyly Digits may be joined by a web of skin or more firmly
fused. Webbing is usually mild and treatment is for cosmetic reasons if
at all. Where digits are fused separation and skin grafting is carried out
at 74y. Refer to plastic surgery.

Musculoskeletal problems

Hip and pelvis problems
History Pain on walking? Pain at rest? Hip joint pain is usually felt in the
groin (see Table 15.4). Referred pain is often felt in the knee. Hip disease
results in d walking distance, difficulty climbing stairs and getting out of
low chairs.
Examination
• Look Watch the patient walk—hip disease l limp or waddling gait
• Feel Joint tenderness is just distal to the midpoint of the inguinal
ligament
• Move Passive movement with the patient lying supine. Check range of
movement—pain reproduced on movement? Crepitus?
• Measure Hip disease is often associated with shortening of the
affected leg—true leg length: anterior superior iliac spine l medial
malleolus; apparent leg length: umbilicus l medial malleolus
• Trendelenburg test Ask the patient to stand on one leg and lift the
foot on the contralateral side off the ground. Place your fingers on
the anterior superior iliac spines. If the pelvis sags on the unsupported
side (+ve Trendelenburg sign) the hip on which the patient is standing
is painful or has a weak/mechanically disadvantaged gluteus medius
0 False +ve in 10%.

Malignancy Hip and pelvis are common sites for s malignancy. Pain is
severe and unremitting, day and night. Often accompanied by weight loss.
X-ray may show no abnormalities or reveal lytic or sclerotic deposits. Bone
scan is diagnostic but may miss myeloma. Depending on clinical circumstances
either refer for specialist advice (oncologist, radiotherapist) or to palliative
care. Treat with analgesia meanwhile. High risk of pathological fracture.
Osteoarthritis of the hip Major cause of hip pain and disability.
Incidence i with age; 4 8 5. Predisposing factors: past hip disease (e.g.
Perthes’) or trauma; unequal leg length.
Presentation Pain may be diffuse and felt in hip region, thigh, or knee.
Relieved by rest in early stages of disease. Signs: d internal rotation
and abduction of hip, with pain at extremes of movement; antalgic gait;
eventually fixed flexion of the hip. Investigation: X-ray may confirm
diagnosis but is often not needed. There is poor correlation between
X-ray changes and pain felt. Perform Oxford Hip Score (see Table 15.5).

Musculoskeletal problems

Management of hip osteoarthritis Analgesia (e.g. regular paracetamol,
NSAIDs), education, weight d, exercise, correction of unequal leg
length. Walking stick ± shock-absorbing shoe insoles can help. Consider
referral for physiotherapy (muscle strengthening exercises may d pain)
or, if significant impairment in functioning (e.g. Oxford Hip Score ≤20) to
orthopaedics for hip resurfacing or replacement .
Total hip replacement >90% achieve good result. Most last >15y. Post-op
care: risk of dislocation in the first 6wk—advise to avoid crossing legs; take
care with transfers; use a walking stick; no driving for 6wk. Physiotherapy
is usually arranged via secondary care.
Hip dislocation Occurs in front seat passengers in car accidents as
the knee strikes the dashboard. Reduction under anaesthetic is required.
Greater trochanter pain (trochanteric bursitis) Can mimic ±
coexist with hip OA. May be associated with muscle weakness around the
hip. Diagnosis: point tenderness over the greater trochanter.
Management Consider local steroid injection if trochanteric bursitis is
likely. Refer to physiotherapy for exercises to strengthen hip musculature
to prevent recurrence.
Meralgia paraesthetica Burning/numbness in the upper lateral aspect
of the thigh due to compression of the lateral cutaneous nerve of the
thigh. Risk factors: pregnancy, obesity, DM. Examination: extension of the
hip or deep palpation just below the anterior superior iliac spine provokes
symptoms. Treatment: analgesia (including neuropathic painkillers), TENS
± local steroid injection. Rarely surgical decompression is needed.
Fascia lata syndrome Inflammation of the fascia lata causing pain in
the lateral thigh. Often due to overuse or weak musculature around the
hip. Treatment is with rest ± referral to physiotherapy.
Hip infection Presents with hip pain, d weight, night sweats, and rigors. Be
aware of infection in patients with RA, hip prosthesis, or immunocompromise.
Refer for investigation. X-rays are often unhelpful—bone scan is non-specific.
Admit for USS-guided drainage, bed rest, and IV antibiotics.
Avascular necrosis May present with hip pain. Have a high level
of suspicion in patients with risk factors—SLE, sickle cell disease, high
alcohol consumption, pregnancy, or corticosteroids. X-ray or bone scan
may confirm diagnosis but MRI is most sensitive. Specialist management is
needed. Usually progresses to cause OA.
Pubic symphysis dehiscence Painful condition occuring in late
pregnancy that may persist after delivery. The pubic symphysis separates
resulting in low abdominal pain which may be accompanied by low back
pain and radiate down both thighs. Pain is constant and worse on movement.
It resolves on rest. Examination reveals a soft abdomen and obstetric
examination is normal. Advise simple analgesia (paracetamol 1g qds). Rest in
a semi-recumbent position when in pain. Refer for physiotherapy, especially
if still a problem in the puerperium. Most resolve spontaneously within
several months of delivery. Some persist and need specialist referral.

Hip and pelvis problems

The limping child
• If a child is limping, take it seriously. Look for a problem
• Children find it difficult to localize pain. Pain can be referred
from the hip to the knee. Examine the whole limb carefully
• Other causes of referred pain include: spinal pathology, psoas spasm
from GI pathology (e.g. appendicitis)
• Limping without pain is uncommon and may be due to undiagnosed
developmental dysplasia of the hip—b p. 854
Transient synovitis of the hip (irritable hip) The most common
reason for limping in childhood. Peak age: 2–10y. 4 > 5. The child is
usually well but complains of pain in the hip or knee and may refuse
to weight-bear. Often occurs after a viral infection. Cause is unknown.
Exclude septic arthritis—refer to orthopaedics. Usually resolves in
7–10d without treatment.
Perthes’ disease Pain in the hip or knee, limp, and limited hip movement developing over 71mo. Due to avascular necrosis of the femoral
head. Bilateral in 10%. Peak age: 4–7y (range 3–11y). 4 : 58 4:1.
Management If suspected refer for X-ray and to orthopaedics.
Treatment is with rest, X-ray surveillance, bracing, and/or surgery
depending on severity. Usually heals over 2–3y. Joint damage may cause
early arthritis. Risk factors for poor outcome include:
• 5
• Onset >8y
• Involvement of the whole femoral head
• Pronounced metaphyseal rarefaction
• Lateral displacement of the femoral head
G.C. Perthes (1869–1927)—German surgeon.

Slipped upper femoral epiphysis The upper femoral epiphy-

sis slips with respect to the femur, usually in a postero-inferior direction. Bilateral in 20%. Incidence: 1:100,000. Peak age: 10–15y. 4:58 3:1.
Typically affects obese, underdeveloped children or tall, thin boys.
Presentation Pain at rest in the groin, hip, thigh, or referred to the knee; limp
and/or pain on movement; d hip movements—particularly abduction and
medial rotation. The affected leg may be externally rotated and shortened.
Management Confirm diagnosis on X-ray (include lateral views)—
shows backwards and downwards slippage of the epiphysis. Refer to
orthopaedics—surgical pinning or reconstructive surgery is needed.
Monitoring of the other hip is essential. Complications include: avascular
necrosis; coxa vara; early OA; slipped epiphysis on the contralateral side.
Developmental dysplasia of the hip b p. 854

Musculoskeletal problems

Knee problems
History
• Trauma History of injury—ask about degree and direction of force
• Pain/stiffness Attempt to distinguish well-localized mechanical pain and
diffuse inflammatory/degenerative pain
• Deformity Swelling? If injury, time of onset of swelling in relation to
history (immediate effusion suggests haemarthrosis; post-traumatic
effusions appear later). Knock-knees or bow-legs?
• Function Do the Oxford Knee Score (see Table 15.6)

Examination Always compare the two knees.
• Look Watch the patient walk. Look at the knees whilst standing—
varus/valgus deformity? Ask the patient to lie down. Note quadriceps
wasting, scars, skin changes, swelling, and deformity. A space under
the knee viewed laterally suggests a fixed flexion deformity. With legs
extended, lift both feet off the bed to demonstrate hyperextension
• Feel Feel the quadriceps for wasting and palpate the knee for warmth.
Check the joint line, collateral ligaments, tibial tubercle, and femoral
epicondyles for tenderness. Palpate the popliteal fossa for a Baker’s
cyst. Check for an effusion. Test for patellofemoral lesions by sliding
the patella sideways across the underlying femoral condyles
• Move With the patient lying on his back check active and passive range
of movement—pain reproduced on movement? Crepitus? Test the
medial and lateral collateral ligaments and cruciate ligaments
• Measure Quadriceps diameter 18cm up from the joint line in adults
0 Knee pain can be referred from the hip so examine the hip as well.
Osteoarthritis of the knee Very common; X-ray evidence of OA is even
more common. Treatment: education; glucosamine; analgesia (paracetamol ±
NSAIDs); exercise (refer to physiotherapy). Suggest using a walking stick.
Steroid injection can be helpful in some patients. If pain and disability are
severe (e.g. Oxford Knee Score ≤16), refer to orthopaedics for consideration
of total or partial knee replacement. Knee replacement is a very successful
procedure resulting in d pain and i mobility. 95% prostheses last >10y.
Infection of the knee joint Most commonly infected joint. Signs: hot,
red, swollen, painful knee. Differential diagnosis: Reiter’s disease, gout,
pseudogout, traumatic effusion, RA. If infection is suspected refer as an
emergency to rheumatology or orthopaedics for investigation. 0 Do not
give antibiotics until the joint has been aspirated.
Non-traumatic knee effusion Common causes: gout, RA, calcium
pyrophosphate dehydrate disease (pseudogout), spondylarthropathies
(including reactive arthritis). Consider FBC, ESR, rheumatoid factor,
anti-nuclear antibody, LFTs, bone biochemistry, and thyroid function tests.
Drain effusion (or refer to rheumatology to drain) and send fluid for polarized light miscroscopy (for crystals) and microbiology (?infection).
Management If no infection, inject with long-acting steroid (b p. 164). If
recurrent and no cause found, refer to rheumatology.

Musculoskeletal problems

Bipartite patella Detected on X-ray. Usually asymptomatic incidental
finding but can cause pain due to excessive mobility of a patella fragment.
If troublesome refer for fragment excision.
Patellar dislocation Lateral dislocation of the patella and tearing of
the medial capsule/quadriceps can occur due to trauma. More common
in young people and if joint hypermobility syndrome. Patient is in pain and
unable to flex knee. Refer via A&E or orthopaedics for reduction.
Recurrent subluxation of the patella Medial knee pain + knee
‘gives way’ due to lateral subluxation of the patella. Most common in girls
with valgus knees. Associations: familial, hypermobility, high-riding patella.
Signs:i lateral patella movement and +ve apprehension test (pain and
reflex contraction of quadriceps on lateral patella pressure). Refer to
physiotherapy for vastus medialis exercises. If that is unhelpful, refer to
rheumatology to exclude a hereditary connective tissue disorder and/or
to orthopaedics for consideration of lateral retinacular release.
Patella tendinitis Small tear in the patella tendon causes pain. Most
commonly seen in athletes. Differential includes inferior patellar pole
enthesitis (spondylarthropathies), fat-pad syndrome, anterior cartilage
lesion, and bursitis. Diagnosis is with USS. Treatment is with rest, NSAIDs
± steroid injection around (not into) the tendon.
Bursitis Prepatellar bursitis (housemaid’s knee) is associated with
excess kneeling. Vicar’s knee (infrapatellar bursitis) is associated with
upright kneeling. Avoid aggravating activity, aspirate ± steroid injection
(d recurrence). If infected treat with antibiotics ± refer for drainage.
Baker’s cyst Popliteal cyst (herniation of joint synovium) can cause
swelling and discomfort behind the knee. Usually caused by a degenerative
knee. Rupture may result in pain and swelling in the calf mimicking DVT.
Treat underlying knee synovitis. Surgical cyst removal may be necessary if
persistent problems. W.M. Baker (1839–96)—English surgeon.
Collateral ligament injury Common in contact sports. Causes
knee effusion if severe ± tenderness over the injured ligament. Collateral
ligaments provide lateral stability to the knee. Normally there is <5° of
movement—if >5° the ligament may be ruptured. Treat with rest, knee
support, analgesia. Refer to orthopaedics if rupture is suspected.
Cruciate ligament injury Cruciate ligaments provide anterior/
posterior knee stability. Assessment can be difficult.
• Anterior cruciate tears Result from a blow to the back of tibia ±
rotation when the foot is fixed on the ground. Signs: effusion and +ve
drawer test (supine with foot fixed and knee at 90°, pull the tibia
forward—test is +ve if the tibia moves forward on the femur)
• Posterior cruciate tears Caused, e.g. when the knee hits the
dashboard in car accidents. Reverse drawer test is +ve (supine with
knee at 90°; apply pressure to push the tibia backwards—test is +ve if
the tibia moves backward on the femur)
Management Refer to orthopaedics if suspected. Splinting and then
physiotherapy helps most (60%) but some require reconstructive surgery—
consider urgent referral if keen sportsman.

Knee problems

Loose bodies in the knee May result in locking of the joint and/or
effusion. Causes: OA, chip fractures, osteochondritis dissecans, synovial
chondromatosis. If problematic refer for removal.
Osteochondritis dissecans Necrosis of articular cartilage and
underlying bone. Can cause loose body formation. Cause unknown. Seen
in young adults l pain after exercise and intermittent knee swelling ±
locking. Predisposes to arthritis. Refer for expert management.
Meniscal lesions Twisting with the knee flexed can cause medial
(bucket handle) meniscal tears and adduction with internal rotation can
cause lateral cartilage tears. Symptoms/signs:
• Locking of the knee—extension is limited due to cartilage fragment
lodging between the condyles
• Giving way of the knee        • Tender joint line
• +ve McMurray’s test—rotation of the tibia on the femur with flexed
knee followed by knee extension causes pain and a click, as the trapped
cartilage fragment is released. X Reliability of this test is debated
Management Refer for MRI ± arthroscopy. Treated by removal of the
torn meniscal fragment.
Meniscal cyst Pain + swelling over the joint line due to a meniscal tear.
Lateral cysts are more common than medial. The knee may click and give
way. Refer for arthroscopy—removal of damaged meniscus relieves pain.
Chondromalacia patellae Common in teenage girls. Pain

on walking up or down stairs or on prolonged sitting. Signs: pain
on stressing the undersurface of the patella. Arthroscopy (indicated only in severe cases) reveals degenerative cartilage on the
posterior surface of the patella. Treat with analgesia + physiotherapy (vastus medialis strengthening d pain in 80%). If persistent, exclude spondylarthropathy ( b p. 518) and refer to orthopaedics for arthroscopy.
Osgood–Schlatter disease Seen in athletic teenagers. Pain and
tenderness ± swelling over the tibial tubercle. X-rays not required.
Avoid aggravating activities. Usually settles over a few months. If not
settling refer to orthopaedics or rheumatology for further assessment.
R.B. Osgood (1873–1956)—US orthopaedic surgeon; C.B. Schlatter
(1864–1934)—Swiss physician.

Bow-legs and knock-knees in children
• Genu varum (bow-legs) Outward curving of the tibia usually
associated with internal tibial torsion. Except in severe cases always
resolves spontaneously. Severe cases raise the possibility of rickets or
other rare developmental disorders—refer for orthopaedic opinion.
• Genu valgum (knock-knees) Common amongst 2–4y olds. Innocent
if symmetrical and independent of any other abnormality. Severe,
progressive cases suggest rickets—refer for X-ray.

Musculoskeletal problems

Ankle and foot problems
History Trauma; i activity, e.g. walking or running a long way for the
patient; feeling of instability; pain/stiffness (relation to weight-bearing;
localized/diffuse); deformity (problems getting shoes, shoes wear in odd
places, or shoes are always uncomfortable); interference with activities.
Examination Compare one foot with the other:
• Look Watch the patient walk normally and on tiptoe. Look at the foot
with the patient seated. Check for deformities, the colour of the foot,
and any skin/nail changes. Check the shoes for any abnormal patterns
of wear (wear is normally under the ball of the foot medially and
posterolaterally at the heel)
• Feel Is there any tenderness? Palpate any swellings. Check pulses and
skin temperature
• Move Assess active and passive movements of the ankle, subtalar,
mid-tarsal, and toe joints systematically. Check range of movement of
joints and pain
• Neurology Check sensation if patient reports any loss of sensation
Ankle, foot, and toe fracture b p. 1110
Achilles tendonitis Inflammation of the Achilles tendon may be
related to overuse or a spondylarthropathy. Presents as a painful local
swelling of the tendon. Advise rest. NSAIDs, heel padding, physiotherapy
± steroid injection may help (never inject into the tendon). If persistent
refer to rheumatology.
Ruptured Achilles tendon Presents with a sudden pain in the back of
the ankle during activity (felt as a ‘kick’). The patient walks with a limp. There
is some plantar flexion, but the patient cannot raise the affected heel from the
floor when standing on tiptoe. A ‘gap’ can usually be felt in the tendon. Calf
squeeze test is –ve (squeezing the calf muscles results in movement of the
foot if the Achilles tendon is intact). Refer immediately for consideration of
repair. The alternative is immobilization in a splint with the foot plantar flexed.
Pes cavus High foot arches may be idiopathic, due to polio, spina
bifida, or other neurological conditions. Toes may claw. Padding under
the metatarsal heads relieves pressure. Operative treatment—soft tissue
release or arthrodesis—straightens toes. Can lead to tarsal bone OA
causing pain—refer for fusion.
Foot drop Patients trip frequently or walk with a high stepping gait.

On examination, patients are unable to walk on their heels and cannot
dorsiflex their foot. Check ankle jerk. Causes:
• Common peroneal palsy, e.g. due to trauma—normal ankle jerk
• Sciatica—ankle jerk absent
• L4, L5 root lesion—ankle jerk may be absent
• Peripheral motor neuropathy, e.g. alcoholic—ankle jerk weak or absent
• Distal myopathy—ankle jerk weak or absent
• Motor neurone disease—i ankle jerk

Ankle and foot problems

Club foot (talipes) Consists of inversion of the foot,
adduction of forefoot relative to hindfoot, and equinus (plantar flexion).
Positional talipes Moulding deformity seen in neonates. The
foot can be passively everted and dorsiflexed to the normal position.
Treatment is with physiotherapy. Follow-up to check the deformity is
resolving.
True talipes The foot cannot be passively everted and dorsiflexed
to the normal position. Refer to orthopaedics. Treatment is with
physiotherapy, splints ± surgery.
Flat feet (pes planus) Low medial arch. All babies and toddlers
have flat feet. The arch develops after 2–3y of walking. Persistent flat
feet may be familial or due to joint laxity. If pain-free, foot is mobile, and
the patient develops an arch on standing on tiptoe (‘flexible’ foot), no
action is required. If painful may be helped by analgesia, exercises, or
insoles. For severe pain, hind foot fusion is an option. Refer if the arch
does not restore on tiptoeing (‘rigid’).
In-toe and out-toe gait

• In-toe Originates in the femur (persistent anteversion of the femoral
neck), tibia (tibial torsion), or foot (metatarsus varus). Does not
cause pain or affect mobility. Usually resolves by age 5–6y
• Out-toe Common <2y. May be unilateral. Corrects spontaneously
Sever’s disease Apophysitis of the heel. Peak age: 8–13y. Treated
with analgesia, raising the heel of the shoe a little, calf-stretching, and
avoiding strenuous activities for a few weeks.

Musculoskeletal problems

Tender heel pad Dull throbbing pain under the heel. Develops a few

months after heel trauma. May be due to plantar fasciitis, bursitis, or tendinitis. Treat with rest and heel padding. Refer to physiotherapy—ultrasound treatment can help. Blind steroid injections into the fat pad are not
recommended. In persistent cases refer to rheumatology.

Plantar fasciitis/bursitis Common cause of inferior heel pain,
especially amongst runners. Pain is worst when taking the first few steps
after getting out of bed. Usually unilateral and generally settles in <6wk.
Advise shoes with arch support, soft heels, and heel padding (e.g. trainers).
Achilles tendon-stretching exercises can help; NSAIDs and steroid
injection are also helpful. In persistent cases refer to podiatry (for fitting
of an insole) ± orthopaedics.
Metatarsalgia (forefoot pain) May be due to synovitis, stress

fractures, sesamoid fracture, injury or i pressure on the metatarsal heads
due to mechanical dysfunction (e.g. in RA). Treat with insoles and padding
under the metatarsal heads. Surgery may be helpful in RA—discuss with
rheumatologist.

Morton’s metatarsalgia (interdigital neuroma) Pain due to

entrapment of the interdigital nerve between the third/fourth metatarsal
heads (usually). Gradual onset of sudden attacks of pain or paraesthesia
during walking. Refer to orthopaedics. Treatment is with steroid injection
and advice on footwear. Some need surgical excision of the neuroma. T.G.
Morton (1835–1903)—US surgeon.

Hammer and claw toes See Figure 15.2.
• Hammer toes Extended MTP joint, hyperflexed PIP joint, and
extended DIP joint. Most common in second toes
• Claw toes Extended MTP joint, flexion at PIP and DIP joints. Due to
imbalance of extensors and flexors (e.g. after polio)
If causing pain or difficulty with walking/footwear, refer for surgery.
Hallux valgus (bunion) Lateral deviation of the big toe at the MTP
joint exacerbated by wearing pointed shoes ± high heels. A bunion
develops where the MTP joint rubs on footwear. Arthritis at the MTP joint
is common. Bunion pads can help but severe deformity requires surgery.

Hallus rigidus Arthritis at first MTP joint causes a stiff, painful big toe.

Refer severe cases to podiatrist or orthotist for offloading or custom-made
rocker-bottom foot orthoses. Resistant pain requires surgery.

Ingrowing toe nail Most common in the big toe. Ill-fitting shoes and
poor nail cutting predispose to the nail growing into the toe skin l pain.
The inflamed tissue is prone to infection. Advise about cutting nails (cut
straight with edges beyond the flesh). Refer to podiatry. Treat infection
with antibiotics (e.g. flucloxacillin 250–500mg qds). If recurrent infection,
consider referral for surgery (e.g. wedge resection of the nail).

Achilles-tendon-stretching exercises
Towel stretch Sit on the floor with your legs stretched out in front of
you. Loop a towel around the top of the injured foot. Slowly pull the
towel towards you keeping your body straight. Hold for 15–30s then
relax—repeat x10.
Calf/Achilles stretch Stand facing a wall. Place your hands on the wall,
chest high. Move the injured heel back and with the foot flat on the
floor. Move the other leg forward and slowly lean toward the wall until
you feel a gentle stretch through the calf; hold for 15–20s and repeat.
Stair stretch Stand on a step on the balls for your feet, hold the rail
or wall for balance. Slowly lower the heel of the injured foot to gently
stretch the arch of your foot for 15–20s.
Toe stretch Sit on the floor with knee bent. Pull the toes back on the
injured foot until stretch across the arch is felt. Hold for 15–20s and
repeat.
Frozen can roll Roll your bare injured foot back and forth from the
tip of the toes to the heel over a frozen juice can (not fizzy) or small
plastic water bottle. This is a good exercise after activity because it
both stretches the plantar fascia and provides cold therapy to the
injured area.

Musculoskeletal problems

Sports medicine
Fitness to perform sporting activities GPs are commonly asked

to certify fitness to perform sports. Normally the patient will come with
a medical form. If there is a form, request to see it before the medical. If
there is no form and you are unsure what to check, telephone the sport’s
governing body or the event organizer. A fee is payable by the patient.
Many gyms/sports clubs also ask older patients/patients with pre-existing
conditions or disabilities to check with their GP before they will sign them
on. Assuming that a suitable regime is undertaken most people can participate. Consider the patient’s baseline fitness, check BP and medications and
recommend gradual introduction to new forms of exercise.

0 Remember—signing a form may result in legal action against you
should the patient NOT be fit to undertake an activity. Where possible,
include a caveat, e.g. ‘based on information available in the medical notes
the patient appears to be fit to . . . although it is impossible to guarantee
this.’ If unsure, consult your local LMC/medical defence organization.

• Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Can cause sudden death
during sport. It is difficult to exclude on clinical examination—if there
is a FH or systolic murmur, refer to cardiology before recommending
new intense activity.
Benefits of exercise b p. 180
Children and sport
• Exercise is good for children—it stimulates development of
the musculoskeletal and cardiovascular systems
• It should be fun and not physically or emotionally over-demanding
• Children are more prone to sports injuries due to continuing growth
(bone growth plates are prone to damage) but are more flexible so
have d injury rate
• Children’s temperature control is not as good as adults
• Equipment must be checked regularly to ensure it fits
• Encourage warm up and stretching exercises before sport
• Refer children with suspected overuse or sports injuries, that do not
recover rapidly with simple analgesia, for specialist assessment

Nutrition Recommend a normal varied diet (b p. 174).

• Special circumstances Particular sports have special requirements
(e.g. i protein for strength athletes); increasing muscle glycogen
stores before exercise can d fatigue during prolonged heavy exercise,
e.g. ‘carbohydrate loading’—3–4d of i carbohydrate (8–10g/kg body
weight) and a carbohydrate meal 3–4h before competing
• Fluids Sufficient fluid during exercise is vital to good performance
and health especially in hot conditions. Rehydration fluids containing
carbohydrate and electrolytes are absorbed faster than plain water
• Supplements (e.g. vitamins, minerals, amino acids, carnitine, creatine)
A good diet generally supplies sufficient nutrients

Sports medicine

Drugs and sport Most regulating bodies have strict codes regarding

drug use. Regulations may differ between different sports. Status of a particular medicine may be checked in the Global Drug Reference Online
(M www.globaldro.com).

Prohibited classes of drugs
• Stimulants—e.g. amphetamine, caffeine (above 12micrograms/mL),
ephedrine, certain β2-agonists (inhaled medication for asthma is
allowed)
• Narcotics—e.g. morphine, diamorphine, pethidine, methadone
(codeine is allowed)
• Anabolic agents—e.g. nandrolone, DHEA, testosterone
• Diuretics—e.g. furosemide, bendroflumethiazide
• Hormones, hormone antagonists, and related substances—e.g.
growth hormone, erythropoietin
• Cannabinoids
Classes of drugs subjected to restrictions
• Alcohol and marijuana Restricted in certain sports
• Local anaesthetics Local or intra-articular injections only are allowed
(provide written notification of administration)
• Corticosteroids Topical, inhaled, or local/intra-articular injections only
are allowed (provide written notification of administration)
• β-blockers—Restricted in certain sports
Drugs for pain relief Generally paracetamol, all NSAIDs, and codeine
are allowed for pain relief. Stronger opioids and drugs containing caffeine
are banned. If in doubt, check on the Global Drug Reference before
prescribing.
Anabolic steroid misuse Significant problem in the UK (5% in gyms and
fitness clubs). Drugs are often used in complicated regimes at high doses
to i lean muscle mass and d body fat. Side effects include:
• Acne
• i LFTs
• i cholesterol
• Mood changes
• Testicular atrophy
• i BP
• Baldness
• Gynaecomastia
0 Other drugs may be taken in conjunction with anabolic steroids to
d these side effects.
• Doctors who prescribe or collude in the provision of drugs or treatment with the intention of improperly enhancing an individual’s performance in sport, risk losing their GMC registration. This does not
preclude the provision of any care or treatment where the doctor’s
intention is to protect or improve the patient’s health.

Musculoskeletal problems

Management of sporting injuries
Principles of managing sporting injuries
• First aid (Airway, Breathing, Circulation). Refer severe injuries to A&E.
• RICE
• Rest Relative rest of affected part whilst continuing other
activities to maintain overall fitness
• Ice and analgesia Use immediately after injury (wrap ice in a towel
and use for maximum 10min at a time to prevent acute cold injury)
• Compression Taping or strapping can be used to treat
(d swelling) and also to prevent acute sprains and strains
• Elevation d local swelling and dependent oedema, enabling
quicker recovery
• Confirm the diagnosis Clinical examination, X-ray
• Early treatment According to cause. Do not delay
• Liaise With sports physician, sports physio, and coach if elite athlete
• Rehabilitation Regaining fitness, strength, and flexibility, examine and
correct the cause of the injury (e.g. poor technique, equipment)
• Graded return to activity Discuss with coach
• Prevention Suitable preparation and training (e.g. suitable footwear,
warm-up and warm-down exercises, safety equipment) can d
likelihood of injuries

Muscle injuries
• Haematoma Within or between muscles can l dramatic whole limb
bruising (due to tracking of blood) and stiffness. Treat with RICE
regime, encourage movement in pain-free range
• Strain (e.g. hamstring injury) Refer to physiotherapy. A secondary
injury is likely if the patient returns to sport too soon

Ligament injuries (sprains)

• Grade 1 Local tenderness, normal joint movement. Give NSAIDs,
support strain, encourage mobilization
• Grade 2 Slightly abnormal joint movement. More joint protection,
NSAIDs, elevate limb, encourage middle of the range movement
• Grade 3 Abnormal joint movement. Refer to orthopaedics
Groin pain in athletes Consider:
• Conjoint tendon pathology (Gilmour’s groin)
• Symphysitis (footballers notably), and
• Adductor tendonitis
Liaise with a sports medicine physician or physiotherapist early.

Overuse injuries Incidence is increasing due to increasingly intensive

training regimes, especially in young adults—even amongst amateurs.
• Causes Load too great for conditions, poor technique or posture,
faulty or poor-quality equipment
• Types of injury Stress fractures, joint tenderness or effusion, ligament
and tendon strains, muscle stiffness

Management of sporting injuries

• Management Rest, NSAIDs, physiotherapy, improved training regime
• Prevention Recognize and correct poor posture or technique, check
equipment is appropriate and fits, warm-up and stretching before
exercise, gradually i intensity and duration of training

Shin splints Exercise-related shin pain may be due to a stress fracture
of the tibia, compartment syndrome, or periostitis. Fractures are not
always seen on X-ray—bone scan is more sensitive and shows periostitis.
Treat with rest and analgesia. Consider referral to sports physiotherapist.
Iliotibial tract syndrome Pain due to inflammation of the synovium
under the iliotibial tract from rubbing of the tract on the lateral femoral
condyle. Seen in runners. Treat with rest, NSAIDs, specialist physiotherapy
± steroid injection.

Over-training syndrome Poor performance, fatigue, heavy muscles,

and depression due to excessive sports training or competing without
sufficient rest. Usually diagnosed from history. Exclude other causes
of fatigue (b p. 528). Manage with rest, reassurance, and alteration of
training programme.

‘Scrumpox’ (herpes gladiatorum) Herpes simplex virus is very

contagious and outbreaks among sporting teams are common, e.g. spread
by close contact and facial stubble grazes whilst scrumming. Treatment:
aciclovir (cream or tablets) and exclusion of infected players. Impetigo,
erysipelas, and tinea barbae can be transmitted in the same way.

Environmental factors
• Heat cramps Painful spasm of heavily exercised muscles (calves and
feet)—due to salt depletion. Treatment: rest, massage of affected
muscle, and fluid and salt replacement (e.g. Dioralyte®)
• Heat stroke/exhaustion Exercising in excessive heat l salt and water
depletion, dehydration, and metabolite accumulation. Signs: headache,
nausea, confusion, incoordination, cramps, weakness, dizziness, and
malaise. Eventually thermoregulatory mechanisms fail l seizures and
coma. Signs: flushing, sweating, and dehydration. Temperature may be
normal (mild cases) or i. Treatment: rest, fluid and salt replacement
(e.g. Dioralyte®). Admission for IV fluids and supportive measures in
severe cases
• Hypothermia Ensure appropriate clothing and limit time in the cold
Signs: behaviour change, incoordination, clouding of consciousness
Treatment: remove from cold environment, wrap in blankets (including
the head), and transfer to hospital. Do not use direct heat
• Frost bite Freezing of the peripheries (usually feet, hands, ears, or
nose). Tissues become hard, insensitive, and white. Treatment: gentle
re-warming. Refer if significant dead tissue. Debridement is usually
delayed to allow natural recovery
• Diving Decompression illness is due to rapid ascent causing nitrogen
dissolved in blood to form gas bubbles. Usually <1–36h after surfacing.
Presentation: deep muscle aches, joint pains, skin pain, paraesthesia,
itching and burning, retrosternal pain, cough and breathlessness,
neurological symptoms. Refer suspected cases urgently to A&E

Musculoskeletal problems

Bone disorders
Osteogenesis imperfecta Inherited condition with autosomal dominant inheritance (rarely recessive). Several types
but all have an underlying problem with collagen metabolism
resulting in fragile bones that break easily. Other features
include lax joints, thin skin, blue sclerae, hypoplastic teeth, and deafness.
Presentation varies according to severity. May be obvious at birth or
present early with fractures. Less severe cases present later and may be
mistaken for NAI. Mild cases may not present until adolescence with
thin bones on X-ray. Treatment is supportive.
Osteopetrosis (marble bone disease) Inherited condition with
autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance. Dominant form presents
in childhood with fractures, osteomyelitis ± facial paralysis. Recessive
form is more severe causing bone marrow failure and death. Bone
marrow transplantation has been tried but is of limited success.
Paget’s disease of bone Abnormal osteoclast activity causes acceler-

ated disorganized bone remodelling. Affects 1–2% of UK adults; 15% have
a FH. 4:58 3:1. Most common in the elderly—only a minority are symptomatic. Affects just one bone in 1 in 3 cases.
Presentation Pain—dull ache aggravated by weight-bearing often remains
at rest; deformity—bowing of weight-bearing bones, especially tibia
(sabre), femur, and forearm usually asymmetrical; frontal bossing of the
forehead; distinctive changes on X-ray; i bone-specific alk phos; normal
Ca2+, PO43–, and PTH.
Management Refer to rheumatology. Give analgesia. Oral/IV
bisphosphonates d pain and long-term complications. Complications:
pathological fracture; OA of adjacent joints; high-output CCF; hydrocephalus
and/or cranial nerve compression l neurological symptoms, e.g. deafness;
spinal stenosis; bone sarcoma (rare—0.1–1.15%).

Osteomyelitis Infection of bone. May spread from abscesses or follow
surgery. Often no primary site is found. More common in those with
DM, sickle cell disease, impaired immunity, and/or poor living standards.
Organisms involved: S. aureus, streptococci, E. coli, Salmonella, Proteus,
and Pseudomonas species, TB. Presents with pain, unwillingness to move
affected part, warmth, effusions in neighbouring joints, fever, and malaise.
Blood cultures are +ve in 60%; i ESR/CRP; i WCC.
Management Refer suspected cases for same-day orthopaedic opinion.
Diagnosis is confirmed with imaging, e.g. MRI or bone scan (X-ray changes
can take days to appear). Treatment: is with IV then po antibiotics (≥6wk)
and surgery to drain abscesses. Complications: septic arthritis, pathological
fracture, deformity of growing bone, chronic infection.
Chronic osteomyelitis Occurs after delayed/inadequate treatment of acute
osteomyelitis. Signs: pain, fever, and discharge of pus from sinuses. Follows
a relapsing/remitting course over years. Needs specialist management.

Bone disorders

Referral guidelines for suspected sarcomaN
Refer for immediate X-ray Any patient with suspected spontaneous
fracture. If the X-ray:
• Indicates possible bone cancer, refer urgently
• Is normal but symptoms persist, follow up and/or request repeat
X-ray, bone function tests, or referral
Refer urgently If a patient presents with a palpable lump that is:
• >5cm in diameter
• Increasing in size
• Deep to fascia, fixed, or immobile • Painful
• A recurrence after previous excision
0 If a patient has HIV, consider Kaposi’s sarcoma and make an urgent
referral if suspected.
Urgently investigate increasing, unexplained, or persistent bone pain or
tenderness, particularly pain at rest (and especially if not in the joint),
or an unexplained limp. In older people metastases, myeloma or lymphoma, as well as sarcoma, should be considered.

Sarcoma Is cancer of the bone or connective tissue. 2,300 patients/y
are diagnosed with sarcoma in the UK, and it causes 1,000 deaths. There
are 2 peaks of incidence—1 in teenagers and another in old age. 5 types of
sarcoma account for >80% of tumours:
Osteosarcoma and the Ewing’s family of tumours Present with aching
bone pain, swelling ± pathological fracture. If X-ray is normal, but
symptoms persist, consider checking bone function tests, re-X-raying,
discussing the patient with a specialist or referral. Treatment involves
surgery and chemotherapy. Overall 5y survival is 50–80%.
Adult soft tissue sarcoma of limb or trunk Usually presents with a palpable
lump. The most common tumours are leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma,
and synovial sarcoma. Treated with surgery ± radiotherapy (high-grade
tumours). Chemotherapy is reserved for palliation.
Kaposi’s sarcoma b p. 746
Intra-abdominal sarcoma Usually presents late. Often arises in the
retroperitoneum. If possible, surgery is the main treatment. Local relapse
is common and often not responsive to cytotoxic therapy.
Rhabdomyosarcoma Originates from striated muscle.
Presents usually in children <2y with a lump. Responds to
intensive multi-modal therapy; outlook is generally good
(>60% long-term survival).

Rickets and osteomalacia
Vitamin D deficiency causes rickets in children and osteomalacia in adults.
The body needs 710 micrograms of vitamin D per day to maintain healthy
bones. The body makes its own vitamin D when sunlight falls on the skin
in the summer months but a diet with adequate vitamin D is needed to
maintain the supply in the winter—especially for people who do not get
out or for cultural or religious reasons are completely shielded from the
sun by their clothing. For dietary sources of vitamin D and calcium see
Tables 15.8 and 15.9.

Clinical features of rickets
• Bone pain/tenderness: arms, legs, spine, pelvis
• Skeletal deformity: bow-legs, pigeon chest (forward projection of
the sternum), rachitic rosary (enlarged ends of ribs), asymmetrical/
odd-shaped skull due to soft skull bones, spinal deformity (kyphosis,
scoliosis), pelvic deformities
• Pathological fracture
• Dental deformities—delayed formation of teeth, holes in enamel,
i cavities
• Muscular problems—progressive weakness, d muscle tone,
muscle cramps
• Impaired growth l short stature (can be permanent)

Clinical features of osteomalacia
•
•
•
•

Bone pain—diffuse, particularly in hips
Muscle weakness
Pathological fractures
Low calcium l perioral numbness, numbness of extremities, hand and
feet spasms, and/or arrhythmias

Causes and management
Dietary deficiency (<30nmol/L) Particularly in children with pigmented
skin in northern climes. Give vitamin D and Ca2+ supplements.
Age-related deficiency (<30nmol/L) Vitamin D metabolism deteriorates
with age and many >80y are deficient. Consider giving vitamin D (800iu/d)
to all elderly >80y.
Secondary rickets/osteomalacia Due to other disease, e.g. malabsorption,
liver disease, renal tubular disorders, or chronic renal failure. Treat underlying cause/supplement Ca2+ and vitamin D.
Vitamin D-dependent rickets Rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder
resulting in an enzyme deficit in the metabolism of vitamin D. Refer for
specialist care. Treated with vitamin D and Ca2+ supplements.
Hypophosphataemic rickets (vitamin D-resistant rickets) X-linked dominant trait resulting in d proximal renal tubular resorption of phosphate.
Parathyroid hormone and vitamin D levels are normal. Specialist management is needed. Treatment is with phosphate replacement ± calcitriol.

Musculoskeletal problems

Osteoporosis
Lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture is 1:3 in 5 and 1:5 in 4 (>200,000
fractures/y in the UK). The main morbidity and financial costs of osteoporosis relate to hip fracture where incidence i steeply >70y. Treatment
aims to prevent fracture.

Definitions
• T-scores compare bone mineral density (BMD) of the subject with the
young adult mean (age 30y)
• Osteoporosis is defined as BMD >2.5 standard deviations (SD) below
the young adult mean (T-score of –2.5). There is i relative risk of
fracture x2–3 for each SD d in BMD
• Osteopenia is diagnosed if T-score is between –1 and –2.5
• Z-scores compare BMDs of subjects and age-matched normal
controls, i.e. they measure whether BMD is normal for the patient’s
age. They cannot be used to diagnose osteoporosis or osteopenia, but
may be useful in young patients to predict osteoporosis risk for the
future

Causes Osteoporosis may be 1o or 2o to other medical conditions:
• Endocrine Hypogonadism (e.g. premature menopause, anorexia,
androgen blockade, taking aromatase inhibitors), hyperthyroidism,
hyperparathyroidism, hyperprolactinaemia, Cushing’s disease, type 1 DM
• GI Coeliac disease or other causes of malabsorption, inflammatory
bowel disease, chronic liver disease, chronic pancreatitis
• Rheumatological RA, other inflammatory arthropathies
• Other Immobility, multiple myeloma, haemoglobinopathy, systemic
mastocytosis, CF, COPD, CKD, homocystinuria
Fragility fracture Fracture sustained falling from ≤ standing height—
includes vertebral collapse (may not be as a result of a fall). Previous
fracture is a risk for future fracture. Common fractures:
• Hip Associated with i mortality • Wrist Colles’ fracture
• Osteoporotic vertebral collapse causes pain, d height, and kyphosis.
Pain can take 3–6mo to settle and requires strong analgesia. Calcitonin
is useful for pain relief for 3mo after vertebral fracture if other
analgesics are ineffective
Predicting fracture riskN 2 validated fracture risk prediction tools are
available: FRAX (available from M www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX) and Qfracture
(available from M www.qfracture.org). Qfracture does not require BMD
measurement; FRAX can be performed without BMD measurement.
Both provide information on 10y probability of hip or other osteoporotic
fracture. Case-finding and further actions—see Figure 15.3.
Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement X-rays cannot be

used to measure BMD but are useful if vertebral fracture or metastases
are suspected. Hip and lumbar spine BMD is measured using dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Do not request without prior use of a risk
prediction tool, e.g. FRAX (without BMD measurement) or Qfracture.

Osteoporosis

Glucocorticoid use Steroid use is a risk factor for osteoporosis.

Minimize steroid dose. For patients taking oral/high-dose inhaled steroids
for >3mo or frequent courses of steroids, in addition:
• Add bone protection agent (e.g. bisphosphonate) for patients >65y or
with history of fragility fracture, or
• Refer patients <65y without history of fragility fracture for DEXA scan
and add a bone protection agent if T-score is ≤–1.5
5 age 50–64y
4 age 50–74y

Age <50y

Musculoskeletal problems

Treatment options for osteoporosis
Lifestyle advice Provide to all at-risk patients.
Adequate nutrition
• Maintain body weight so BMI >19kg/m2
• Advise adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (food rich in calcium
and vitamin D—see Tables 15.8 and 15.9, b p. 507)
• Give Ca2+ and/or vitamin D supplements to post-menopausal women
with dietary deficiency; also consider if on long-term steroids, >80y,
housebound, or institutionalized
Regular exercise Weight-bearing activity >30min/d d fracture rate
Stop smoking Women that stop smoking pre-menopause have a 25% d
fracture rate post-menopause
d alcohol consumption To <21u/wk (4) or <14u/wk (5)

Bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronic acid 70mg once weekly) d bone loss
and fracture rateC. Mainstay of treatment for osteoporosis. Avoid if severe
CKD or woman of child bearing age (possible teratogenic effects).
Instructions for use Take on an empty stomach first thing in the morning,
≥30min before food/other medication; take in an upright position washed
down with plenty of water; sit upright for 30min after taking.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw Rare complication of bisphosphonate therapy (IV
> po preparations). Causes non-healing gum lesions. The only treatment is
surgical excision of the affected bone. Risk of osteonecrosis i after dental
work—advise patients to have a dental check-up and any necessary dental
work done before starting bisphosphonate treatment, and to report any
oral symptoms when on treatment to their dentist.
Atypical femoral fracture Prolonged bisphosphonate treatment >5y
l oversuppression of bone turnover and i bone fragility. Acute
sub-trochanteric or mid-shaft femoral fractures are most common. X To
prevent this, a ‘drug holiday’ of 1–5y has been proposed for low-risk
patients after 5y use—follow local guidance.
Strontium ranelate No longer recommended for p or s prevention
of osteoporosis due to concerns regarding skin/hypersensitivity reactions
and i risk of venous thromboembolism and CVD. May still be of benefit
for those at high risk of fracture, who have no history of CVD and are
intolerant of other medication. Patients taking strontium ranelate should
have regular screening/monitoring to exclude CVD.
Raloxifene 60mg od. Selective oestrogen receptor modulator (SERM).
• For patients with previous fragility fracture if bisphosphonates are
contraindicated/not tolerated or there is an unsatisfactory response
with bisphosphonates (further fracture and/or d in BMD after ≥1y
treatment). SERMs are not recommended for primary prevention of
osteoporotic fractureN
• Avoid if past history of DVT/PE, cholestasis, endometrial cancer, or
undiagnosed vaginal bleeding

Treatment options for osteoporosis

Denosumab 60mg sc every 6mo. Monoclonal antibody that d osteoclast activation and d bone resorption.
• For post-menopausal osteoporosis when bisphosphonates are
contraindicated/not tolerated and severe osteoporosisN
• Can be used for women with severe CKD; correct hypocalcaemia
before starting treatment. May cause osteonecrosis of the jaw
HRT (b p. 712) Postpones post-menopausal bone loss and d fracturesC.
Optimum duration of use is uncertain (>5–7y) but benefit disappears <5y
after stopping. i in breast cancer and cardiovascular risk limits useR.
• CSM guidance (2003)
• Premature menopause HRT is recommended for the prevention of
osteoporosis until women reach 51y
• >51y HRT should not be considered first-line therapy for long-term
prevention of osteoporosis. HRT remains an option where other
therapies are contraindicated, cannot be tolerated, or if there is a
lack of response; risks and benefits should be carefully assessed

Teriparatide Third-line for postmenopausal women and second-line
for men with past history of fragility fracture if other treatments are not
tolerated/ineffective and specific T-score and clinical criteria are met.
Given by daily injection. Maximum duration of use is 18mo. Consider
referral for consultant initiation if other treatment options are exhausted.
Osteoporosis in men Currently only bisphosphonates and teriparatide
are recommended for treatment of osteoporosis in men.
Monitoring There is no consensus about duration of treatment for
osteoporosis or monitoring of BMD during treatment. Circumstances in
which repeat DEXA scanning might be necessary include:
• Fragility fracture on treatment
• If considering a change in treatment
• When considering restarting therapy after a drug holiday
Referral Consider referral to an appropriate specialist if:
• Another cause for fragility fracture is suspected (e.g. metastasis)—U
• Fragility fracture on treatment—R
•	Unusual presentation of osteoporosis, e.g. pre-menopausal woman—R
• For consideration of treatment with IV bisphosphonate, denosumab,
or teriparatide—R
U = urgent referral; R = routine referral.
Osteopenia If T-score of between –1 and –2.5, provide lifestyle advice.
Repeat DEXA scan in 72y.

Musculoskeletal problems

Osteoarthritis
Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most important cause of locomotor disability.
It used to be considered ‘wear and tear’ of the bone/cartilage of synovial
joints but is now recognized as a metabolically active process involving the
whole joint—i.e. cartilage, bone, synovium, capsule, and muscle.
The main reason for patients seeking medical help is pain. Level of pain
and disability are greatly influenced by the patient’s personality, anxiety,
depression, and activity, and often do not correlate well with clinical signs.

Risk factors i age (uncommon <45y); 5 > 4;i in black and Asian

populations; genetic predisposition; obesity; abnormal mechanical loading
of joint, e.g. instability; poor muscle function; post-meniscectomy; certain
occupations, e.g. farming.

Symptoms and signs Joint pain ± stiffness, synovial thickening,

deformity, effusion, crepitus, muscle weakness and wasting, and
d function. Most commonly affects hip, knee, and base of thumb. Typically
exacerbations occur that may last weeks to months. Nodal OA, with
swelling of the distal interphalangeal joints (Heberden’s nodes), has a
familial tendency.

Investigations X-rays may show d joint space, cysts, and sclerosis
in subchondral bone, and osteophytes. OA is common and may be a
coincidental finding. Exclude other causes of pain, e.g. check FBC and ESR
if inflammatory arthritis is suspected (normal or mildly i in OA—ESR
>30mm/h suggests RA or psoriatic arthritis).
Management of osteoarthritis in primary care Employ a holistic
approach. Assess effect of OA on the patient’s functioning, quality of
life, occupation, mood, relationships, and leisure activities. Formulate
a management plan with the patient that includes self-management
strategies, effects of co-morbidities, and regular review.

Information and advice Give information and advice on all relevant
aspects of osteoarthritis and its management. Arthritis Research UK
produces a range of leaflets for patients. Use the whole multidisciplinary
team, e.g. refer to:
• Physiotherapist for advice on exercises, strapping, and splints
• OT for aids
• Chiropodist for foot care and insoles
• Social worker for advice on disability benefits and housing
• Orthopaedics for surgery if significant disability/night pain
d load on the joint Weight reduction can d symptoms and may
d progression in knee OA. Using a walking stick in the opposite hand to
the affected hip and cushioned insoles/shoes (e.g. trainers) can also help.
Exercise and improving muscle strength d pain and disability, e.g. walking
(for OA knee), swimming (for OA back and hip but may make neck
worse), cycling (for OA hip or knee but may worsen patellofemoral
OA). Refer to physiotherapy for advice on exercises especially isometric
exercises for the less mobile.

Osteoarthritis

Pain control
•	Use non-pharmacological methods first (activity, exercise, weight d,
footwear modification, walking stick,TENS, local heat/cold treatments)
• Regular paracetamol (1g qds) is first-line drug treatment for all OA
and/or topical NSAIDs for knee/hand OA only. Topical NSAIDs have
less side effects than oral NSAIDs and are more acceptable to patients
•	Use opioids, oral NSAIDs, or COX2 inhibitors as second-line agents in
addition to, or instead of paracetamol. Use the lowest effective dose
for the shortest possible time. Co-prescribe a proton pump inhibitor
(e.g. omeprazole 20mg od) with NSAIDs
• Low-dose antidepressants, e.g. amitriptyline 10–75mg nocte (unlicensed),
are a useful adjunct especially for pain causing sleep disturbance
• Capsaicin cream can also be helpful for knee/hand OAN
Aspiration of joint effusions and joint injections Can help in exacerbations.
Some patients respond well to long-acting steroid injections—it may be
worth considering a trial of a single treatment. Hyaluronic acid knee
injections are not recommended by NICE.
Complementary therapies 760% of sufferers from OA are thought to
use CAM, e.g. copper bracelets, acupuncture, food supplements, dietary
manipulation. There is good evidence chiropractic/osteopathy can be helpful
for back pain, but otherwise evidence of effectiveness is scanty. Advise patients
to find a reputable practitioner with accredited training who is a member of
a recognized professional body and carries professional indemnity insurance.
X Other drugs/supplements
• Glucosamine It is controversial whether glucosamine modifies OA
progression. It is available OTC but not recommended by NICE
• Strontium ranelate d progression of OA, d pain, and i mobilityR.
Place in OA management is yet to be determined
Psychological factors have a major impact on the disability from OA.
Education about the disease, and emphasis that it is not progressive in
most people, is important. Seek and treat depression and anxiety with
screening tools—b p. 199

Refer
• To rheumatology To confirm diagnosis if coexistent psoriasis
(psoriatic arthritis mimics OA and can be missed by radiologists); rule
out s causes of OA (e.g. pseudogout, haemochromatosis) if young
OA or odd distribution; if joint injection is thought worthwhile but you
lack expertise or confidence to do it
• To orthopaedics If symptoms are severe for joint replacement. Refer
as an emergency if you suspect joint sepsis

Musculoskeletal problems

Rheumatoid arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is the most common disorder of connective
tissue affecting 71% of the UK population. It is an immunological disease,
triggered by environmental factors, in patients with genetic predisposition.
Disease course is variable with exacerbations and remissions.
• Refer all suspected cases of rheumatoid arthritis to rheumatology—
early treatment with disease-modifying drugs can significantly alter disease progression. Refer urgentlyN if:
• Small joints of the hands/feet are affected
• >1 joint is affected
• There has been a delay of ≥3mo between onset of symptoms and
seeking medical advice

Presentation

• Can present at any age—most common in middle age. 5:4 83:1
• Variable onset—often gradual but may be acute
•	Usually starts with symmetrical small joint involvement—i.e. pain,
stiffness, swelling, and functional loss (especially in the hands); joint
damage and deformity occur later
• Irreversible damage occurs early if untreated and can l deformity and
joint instability
• Other presentations—monoarthritis, migratory (palindromic) arthritis;
PMR-like illness; systemic illness of malaise, pain, and stiffness
Symptoms and signs Predominantly peripheral joints are affected—
symmetrical joint pain, effusions, soft tissue swelling, early morning
stiffness. Progression to joint destruction and deformity. Tendons may
rupture. Specific features—see Table 15.10.
Differential diagnosis Diagnosis may not be easy—consider:
• Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
• Psoriatic arthritis
• Other connective tissue disorders
• Nodal OA
• Polymyalgia rheumatica if >50y
• SLE (especially in 5 <50y)

Investigations
• Check FBC (normochromic, normocytic or hypochromic, microcytic
anaemia), ESR and/or CRP (i). May have i platelets, d WCC
• Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibodies are +ve in the majority.
A minority have a +ve ANA titre
• X-rays—normal, periarticular osteoporosis or soft tissue swelling in the
early stages; later—loss of joint space, erosions, and joint destruction
Management A multidisciplinary team approach is ideal, e.g. GP, medical and surgical teams, physiotherapist, podiatrist, OT, nurse specialist and
social worker.
Screening for depression b p. 199.
General support Provision of information about the disease, treatments, and
support available (including equipment and help with everyday activities, self-help
and carers groups, disabled parking badges, financial support—b p. 222).
Physical therapy Exercises, splints, appliances, and strapping help to keep
joints mobile, d pain, and preserve function.

Musculoskeletal problems

Medication
NSAIDs and simple analgesics (e.g. regular paracetamol). Provide symptomatic relief but do not alter the course of disease. Patients’ response to NSAIDs
is individual—start with the least gastric-toxic, e.g. ibuprofen 200–400mg tds
and alter as necessary, e.g. to naproxen 500mg bd. If the patient has a history
of indigestion/gastric problems consider adding gastric protection, e.g. PPI, or,
if there is no history of CVD, using a COX2 inhibitor, e.g. celecoxib 100mg bd.
Corticosteroids Intra-articular injections of steroids (e.g. triamcinolone)
can settle localized flares (e.g. knee or shoulder) and can be used up to
3x/y in any particular joint. Depot IM injections or IV infusions (pulses) can
also help to settle an acute flare but offer short-term benefits with the
risk of systemic side effects. Daily low-dose oral steroids help symptoms
and there is some evidence that they can modify disease progression, but
concerns about adverse side effects have limited use.
Disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs)
• Hydroxychloroquine
• Gold
• Methotrexate
• Ciclosporin
• Azathioprine
• Sulfasalazine
• Cyclophosphamide
• Leflunomide
• Penicillamine
• Biologic therapies, e.g. rituximab, infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab
Use only under consultant supervision. d disease progression by modifying
the immune response and inflammation. Used individually or in combination, they are now started very early in the disease (i.e. first 3–6 mo)—
hence the need for early referral. DMARDs can take several months to
show any effect. Before starting check baseline U&E, Cr, eGFR, LFTs, FBC,
and urinalysis. Side effects and monitoring—see Table 15.11.
• Results requiring action
• Platelets <150 x 109/L
• Total WBC <3.5 x 109/L
• Neutrophils <2 x 109/L
• LFTs (ALT/AST) >2x baseline
• Persistent proteinuria (>1+ x2) or haematuria
Discuss with rheumatologist ± stop medication

Surgery Aims to relieve pain and improve function. Consideration of
the risks, benefits, and the most appropriate timing of surgery is vital.
Common procedures include: joint fusion, replacement, and excision;
tendon transfer and repair; and nerve decompression.
Complications of RA Physical disability, depression, osteoporosis,
i infections, lymphoma, cardiovascular disease, amyloidosis (10%), side
effects of treatment.

Musculoskeletal problems

The spondylarthropathies
A group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases characterized by predom­
inant involvement of axial and peripheral joints and entheses (areas where
tendons, ligaments, or joint capsules attach to bone). Includes:
• Ankylosing spondylitis
• Psoriatic arthritis
• Reactive arthritis and Reiter’s syndrome
• Behçet’s disease
• Arthritis that accompanies inflammatory bowel disease
• Whipple’s disease (b p. 407)
Sacroiliitis and spondylitis occur with all of them, and they are all associated with the HLA B27 genotype.

Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) Prevalence 1:2,000. 4:5 82½:1. 95%
HLA B27 +ve—prevalence in a population mirrors the frequency of the
HLA B27 genotype. Risk of developing AS if HLA B27 +ve 81:3.
Presentation Typically presents with morning back pain/stiffness in a young
man. Progressive spinal fusion (ankylosis) leads to d spinal movement,
spinal kyphosis, sacroiliac (SI) joint fusion, neck hyperextension, and neck
rotation. Other features:
• Crohn’s or UC
• d chest expansion
• Heart disease—carditis, aortic
• Chest pain
regurgitation, conduction defects
• Hip and knee arthritis
• Osteoporosis
• Plantar fasciitis and other
• Psoriaform rashes
enthesopathies
• Iritis
Tests
• Blood FBC—normochromic or microcytic hypochromic anaemia,
i ESR (may be normal), rheumatoid factor is usually –ve
• X-ray Initial signs are widening of the SI joints and marginal sclerosis—
later, SI joint fusion and a ‘bamboo spine’ (vertebral squaring/fusion)
Management Aims to d inflammation, pain, and stiffness; alleviate
systemic symptoms, e.g. fatigue; and slow or stop long-term progression
of the disease. Exercise helps back pain. NSAIDs (e.g. naproxen 500mg
bd) also help pain. Refer to a rheumatologist early for confirmation of
diagnosis, education, disease-modifying drugs (b p. 517), and advice on
appropriate exercise regimes to maintain mobility.

Psoriatic arthritis Inflammatory arthritis associated with psoriasis

(740% psoriasis patients. 4 = 5). 75% patients have a pre-existing history of psoriasis before the arthropathy; in 15% the rash appears simultaneously with the joint symptoms; in 10% the arthritis precedes the skin
changes. Presentation is variable. Patterns include:
• Distal arthritis DIP joint swelling of hands/feet, nail dystrophy ±
flexion deformity. Sausage-shaped fingers are characteristic of psoriatic
arthritis affecting the hand
• Rheumatoid-like polyarthropathy Similar to rheumatoid arthritis
but less symmetrical and rheumatoid factor is –ve

The spondylarthropathies

• Mutilans Associated with severe psoriasis. Erosions in small bones of
hands/feet l progressive deformity
• Ankylosing spondylitis/sacroiliitis Usually HLA B27 +ve
Investigations WBC—usually i; ESR/CRP—usually i; rheumatoid
factor –ve; X-ray appearances can be diagnostic.
Management Education; physiotherapy; NSAIDs. Refer to rheumatology
for confirmation of diagnosis, advice on management, and disease-modifying
drugs (b p. 517). Medication, e.g. methotrexate, may improve both skin
and musculoskeletal symptoms.

Reactive arthritis Often asymmetrical aseptic arthritis in ≥1 joint.

Occurs 2–6wk after bacterial infection elsewhere—e.g. gastroenteritis (Salmonella, Campylobacter), GU infection (chlamydia, gonorrhoea).
i incidence in HLA B27 +ve individuals.
Management NSAIDs, physiotherapy, and steroid joint injections.
Recovery usually occurs within months. A minority develop chronic
arthritis requiring disease-modifying drugs. Refer to rheumatology.
Reiter’s syndrome Polyarthropathy, urethritis, iritis, and a psoriaform rash.
Affects men with HLA B27 genotype. Commonly follows genito-urinary or
bowel infection. Joint and eye changes are often severe. Refer for specialist
management. H.C. Reiter (1881–1969)—German public health physician.

Behçet’s disease Multi-organ disease of unknown cause (although

thought to be infective). 4:5 8 2:1. Clinical picture (only some
features): arthritis; ocular symptoms and signs—pain, d vision, floaters,
iritis; scarring, painful ulceration of mouth and/or scrotum; colitis;
meningoencephalitis. Refer to GUM clinic, ophthalmologist or general
physician depending on symptom cluster. Treatment is usually with
steroids ± azathioprine or ciclosporin. Topical steroids may be useful for
ulcers. H. Behçet (1889–1948)—Turkish dermatologist.

Enteropathic spondylarthropathy Oligoarticular or polyarticular
arthritis linked to inflammatory bowel disease. Presentation is variable and
includes: sacroiliitis, plantar fasciitis, inflammatory spinal pains, and other
enthesitides (insertional ligament/tendon inflammation). Arthritis may
evolve and relapse/remit independently of bowel disease.
Management NSAIDs may help joint pain but aggravate bowel
disease. Refer to rheumatology for confirmation of diagnosis, advice on
management, and disease-modifying drugs.

Presentation Painful swollen joint (big toe, feet, and ankles most
commonly); red skin which may peel ± fever. Can be polyarticular—
especially in elderly 5. May mimic septic arthritis.
Investigation
• Blood i WCC; i ESR; i blood urate (but may be normal)
• Microscopy of synovial fluid Not usually required—reveals sodium
monourate crystals on polarized light microscopy
• X-rays Not usually required—show soft tissue swelling only, unless
severe disease when an erosive pattern is seen
Management Resolves in <2wk—often after 2–7d if treated.
• Exclude infection
• Rest and elevate joint—apply ice packs
• NSAIDs are helpful—e.g. naproxen 500mg bd—caution if GI problems
• Alternatively, if NSAIDs are contraindicated, try colchicine 500 micrograms
bd, increased slowly to qds until pain is relieved or side effects, e.g. nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhoea (max 6mg—do not repeat in <3d)
• Steroid joint injection or IM steroid (e.g. Depo-Medrone® 80–120mg)
are also effective
Prevention of further attacks
• d weight; avoid alcohol and purine-rich foods (e.g. offal, red meat,
yeast extracts, pulses, and mussels)
• Avoid thiazide diuretics and aspirin
• Consider prophylactic medication if recurrent attacks. First-line
treatment is allopurinol 100–300mg daily—wait until 1mo after acute
attack and co-prescribe colchicine (500 micrograms bd) or NSAID
for first 1–3mo to try to avoid precipitation of another acute attack.
Check serum urate level after 2mo—aim for low normal range
• If allopurinol is not effective/not tolerated, febuxostat is an alternative
• Alternatively or in addition try a uricosuric, e.g. sulfinpyrazone

Crystal-induced arthritis

0
• Gout may be linked to i risk of hypertension and coronary heart
disease—screen patients
• Refer any patient with gout and kidney stones or recurrent UTI to
urology

Chronic gout Recurrent attacks, tophi (urate deposits) in pinna, tendons and joints, and joint damage. Refer to rheumatology.
Calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPPD) Also
known as pseudogout. Inflammatory arthritis due to deposition of
pyrophosphate crystals. Associated with OA, hyperparathyroidism, and
haemochromatosis.

Presentation Attacks are less severe than gout and may be difficult to
differentiate from other types of arthritis. Knee, wrist, and shoulder are
most commonly affected. Acute attacks can be triggered by intercurrent
illness and metabolic disturbance.
Investigation Chondrocalcinosis may be seen on X-ray (calcification of
articular cartilage). Presence of joint crystals confirms diagnosis.
Management
• Treat acute attacks like acute gout
• A chronic form also occurs—frequently erosive. Refer to
rheumatology for confirmation of diagnosis, advice on management
and disease-modifying drugs

• Septic arthritis This is the most important differential diagnosis
for acute gout. It is most common in children <5y old and most commonly affects the hip or knee, but septic arthritis can occur at any age
and affect any joint. The patient is usually systemically unwell and holds
the affected joint completely still. The joint may be swollen, hot, and tender. This is an orthopaedic emergency—if suspected admit. Treatment is
with IV antibiotics ± surgical washout of the joint.

Musculoskeletal problems

Connective tissue diseases
Group of overlapping diseases that affect many organs and are associated with fever, malaise, chronic (often relapsing/remitting) course, and
response to steroids. Often difficult to diagnose.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Autoimmune disease with
prevalence 1:3,000; 5:48 9:1. i in Afro-caribbeans and Asians. Onset 15–40y.
Presentation—see Table 15.12. There must be multisystem involvement.
Investigations Check an autoimmune profile—95% are ANA (anti-nuclear
antibody) +ve. Other immunological abnormalities—i double-stranded
DNA, RhF +ve (40%), d complement (C3, C4). FBC: d Hb, d WCC, i ESR.
Management Refer to rheumatology. Use NSAIDs for symptom control.
Sunscreens protect skin (ACBS). Steroids are the mainstay of treatment of
acute flares (always discuss with a rheumatologist). Hydroxychloroquine
can improve skin and joint symptoms. Cyclophosphamide, methotrexate,
and ciclosporin are also used.
• Sulfonamides and hormonal contraceptives/HRT may worsen SLE.

Drug-induced lupus Occurs with:
• Minocycline
• Isoniazid
• Hydralazine

• Procainamide
• Chlorpromazine
• Sulfasalazine

• Losartan
• Anticonvulsants

Remits slowly when the drug is stopped, but steroids may be needed.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (LE) 5:4 82:1. ≥1 well-defined, red,

round/oval plaques on the face, scalp, or hands. Scarring may l scalp
alopecia and skin hypopigmentation. Internal involvement is not a feature.
Confirm with lesion biopsy. Investigate with an autoimmune profile as for
SLE. Treat with potent topical steroids and sunscreen. Remission occurs
in 40%. 5% develop SLE.
Antiphospholipid syndrome i clotting tendency occurring with
SLE or alone. Associated with thrombosis, stroke, migraine, miscarriage,
myelitis, MI, and multi-infarct dementia. If suspected start aspirin 150mg od
and refer to rheumatology. May need anticoagulation.

Sjögren’s syndrome
• Primary Sjögren’s syndrome Under-recognized cause of fatigue and
dryness of skin/mucous membranes (may present with dyspareunia).
Often presents with nodal OA. Long-term, associated with lymphoma.
Autoimmune profile is characteristic
• Secondary Sjögren’s syndrome Association of any connective tissue
disease (50% have RA) with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (d lacrimation l
dry eyes) or xerostomia (d salivation l dry mouth)
Management Refer to rheumatology. Provide information/support. Use
artificial tears for dry eyes. Xerostomia may respond to frequent cool
drinks, artificial saliva sprays, e.g. Glandosane®, or sugar-free gum. Inform
dentist of the diagnosis. Rashes may respond to antimalarials.
H.S.C. Sjögren (1899–1986)—Swedish ophthalmologist.

Connective tissue diseases

Raynaud’s syndrome Intermittent digital ischaemia precipitated by

cold or emotion. Fingers ache and change colour: pale l blue l red on
rewarming. Usually presents <25y of age and is idiopathic. Prevalence:
3–20%; 5 > 4; often abates at the menopause; 5% develop autoimmune
rheumatic disease—mainly scleroderma and SLE.
Differential diagnosis
• Other rheumatology conditions—scleroderma; SLE; RA
• Haematology conditions—leukaemia; polycythaemia; thrombocytosis;
cold agglutinins; monoclonal gammopathy; mixed cryoglobulinaemia
• Drugs, e.g. β-blockers
• Smoking/arteriosclerosis
• Thoracic outlet obstruction
• Trauma, e.g. use of vibrating tools
Management Keep warm—woolly socks/gloves/hats in cold weather,
hand warmers, stay inside if cold. Avoid drugs that worsen symptoms, e.g.
β-blockers. Stop smoking. Nifedipine 10–20mg tds, amlodipine 5mg od, or
fluoxetine 20mg od (unlicensed) may help. If associated/severe symptoms.
refer to rheumatology (urgently if critical ischaemia—e.g. ulceration/
infarcts on fingers). A.G.M. Raynaud (1834–1881)—French physician.
Systemic sclerosis Spectrum of disorders causing fibrosis and skin
tightening (scleroderma). Raynaud’s is usually present ± i BP, lung
fibrosis, GI symptoms, telangiectasia, polyarthritis, and/or myopathy.
Provide education/support. Treat symptoms. Early specialist referral is
vital. CREST (Calcinosis of subcutaneous tissues; Raynaud’s; oEsophageal
motility problems; Sclerodacyly; and Telangectasia) has better prognosis.

Musculoskeletal problems

Polymyalgia and giant cell arteritis
Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) and giant cell (or temporal) arteritis
(GCA) are two clinical syndromes that are part of the same spectrum.
Key features:
• Both PMR and GCA affect the elderly (rare <50y); 5:4 83:1
• 50% of patients with GCA also have PMR; 15% with PMR have GCA
• Both conditions usually respond rapidly and dramatically to
corticosteroids

Presentation Diagnosis is clinical. Both PMR and GCA may present

with malaise, anorexia, fever, night sweats, weight d, and depression.
Check ESR/CRP on presentation.

Diagnosis of PMR A person may be regarded as having PMR if the
following criteria are presentG:
• Age >50y; duration >2wk
• Bilateral shoulder or pelvic girdle aching, or both
• Morning stiffness duration of >45min
• Evidence of acute phase response, i.e. i ESR (usually >30mm/h) or
i CRP) 0 Diagnosis can be made without i inflammatory markers if
classical clinical picture and rapid response to steroid treatment
Diagnosis of GCA A person may be regarded as having GCA if ≥3 of the
following criteria are metG:
• Age ≥50y
• New headache—unilateral throbbing headache, facial pain, scalp
tenderness, e.g. on brushing hair and/or jaw claudication (i likelihood
of visual symptoms)
• Temporal artery abnormality (tenderness, thickening, d pulsation)
• i ESR >50mm/h (or i CRP)
• Abnormal temporal artery biopsy compatible with GCA
0 Visual symptoms (amaurosis fugax, diplopia, or sudden loss of vision)
are early complications of GCA and may be the presenting feature.

Differential diagnosis
PMR
• Inflammatory arthritis, e.g. RA
• Connective tissue disease/
vasculitis, e.g. SLE
• OA
• Septic arthritis
• Shoulder disease
• Neoplasia, e.g. myeloma
• Occult sepsis, e.g. endocarditis
• Inflammatory myopathy
• Fibromyalgia
• Endocrinopathy/metabolic bone
disease

GCA
• Herpes zoster
• Migraine
• Intracranial pathology
• Other causes of acute vision
loss, e.g. amaurosis fugax
• Cluster headache
• Cervical spondylosis or other
cervical spine disease
• Sinus/ear disease
• TMJ pain
• Connective tissue disease/
vasculitis

Polymyalgia and giant cell arteritis

Further investigation Intended to exclude other diagnoses:

• Full blood count—normocytic anaemia may be seen in PMR/GCA
• TFTs
•	Urea and electrolytes/eGFR
• Creatine kinase
• Liver function tests
• Dipstick urinalysis
• Bone profile
• Protein electrophoresis (also consider urinary Bence Jones protein)
• Rheumatoid factor (consider ANA and anti-CCP antibodies too)
• Consider CXR and/or hip/pelvis/shoulder/cervical spine X-ray
Further management of PMR If typical symptoms/signs management in primary care is appropriate.
• Start prednisolone 15mg od—there should be a rapid response (≥70%
d of symptoms in <1wk); if not question the diagnosis. ESR/CRP
should return to normal in <4wk
• Continue prednisolone 15mg od for 3wk then d dose to 12.5mg od for
3wk, then 10mg od for 4–6wk, then by 1mg every 4–8wk. Tailor steroid
regime to the individual—a longer time at each dose may be needed
• If there is relapse of symptoms, go back to the previous higher dosage
• At the start of treatment give osteoporosis prophylaxis (b p. 509)
and supply with a steroid card (b p. 306)
•	Usually 1–2y of treatment is needed. The need for ongoing treatment
>2y should prompt referral for specialist assessment
Referral for rheumatology assessment
• Red flag features: prominent systemic features, weight d, night pain,
neurological signs (urgent referral)
• Lack of shoulder involvement
• Symptoms of GCA
• Lack of inflammatory stiffness
•	Younger patient <60y
• Normal or very high ESR/CRP
• Chronic onset (over >2mo)
• Peripheral arthritis or other features of connective tissue/muscle disease
• Treatment dilemmas e.g. incomplete/non-response to steroids;
treatment required >2y

Further management of GCA
• Corticosteroids prevent vascular complications, particularly blindness,
and rapidly relieve symptoms (70% improvement in <1wk); prescribe
prednisolone 40–60mg daily to start immediately if a diagnosis of GCA
is suspected
• At the start of treatment give osteoporosis prophylaxis (b p. 509)
and supply with a steroid card (b p. 306)
• Consider starting aspirin 75mg od
• Refer urgently to ophthalmology or rheumatology depending on local
referral pathways for temporal artery biopsy and ongoing management
(same day if visual symptoms)
0 Temporal artery biopsy may be –ve even in cases of GCA due to skip
lesions. Do not withhold treatment whilst waiting for biopsy—but if the
patient has had steroids ≥2wk +ve biopsy is less likely.

Musculoskeletal problems

Vasculitis
Characterized by inflammation within or around blood vessels ± necrosis.
Severity depends on size and site of vessels affected. Systemic vasculitis
can be life-threatening. Causes:
• Idiopathic (50%)
• Connective tissue disease (e.g. RA, SLE)
• Infection (e.g. rheumatic fever, infective endocarditis, Lyme’s disease)
• Drugs (e.g. NSAIDs, antibiotics)
• Neoplasia (e.g. lymphoma, leukaemia)
Presentation Variable—may be confined to the skin or systemic
involving joints, kidneys, lungs, gut, and nervous system.
• Skin signs Palpable purpura (often painful)—usually on lower legs/
buttocks
• Systemic effects Fever, night sweats, malaise, weight d, myalgia, and
arthralgia may occur in all types of vasculitis
Conditions See Table 15.13—many are rare.

Musculoskeletal problems

Tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome
Tired all the time Fatigue is common. 1:400 sustained episodes of

fatigue generate a GP consultation. GPs see 30 patients/y whose main
complaint is fatigue and it may be a 2° symptom in many others. 2% of
consultations result in 2° care referral. Almost any disease processes
can cause tiredness—whether physical or psychological. Physical causes
account for 79% of cases; 75% have symptoms of emotional distress.
Assessment
• Onset/duration—short history/abrupt onset suggest post-viral or DM
• Pattern of fatigue—on exertion relieved by rest suggests organic
cause; worst in the morning and never goes suggests depression
• Associated symptoms—e.g. breathlessness, weight d, or anorexia
suggest underlying organic disease. Chronic pain may cause fatigue
• Sleep patterns—early morning wakening/unrefreshing sleep suggest
depression; snoring, pauses of breathing in sleep, and daytime
sleepiness suggest sleep apnoea
• Psychiatric history—symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress
• Alcohol and medication—including OTC and illicit drugs
• Patient’s worries—what does the patient think is wrong?
• Examination—usually normal
Common organic causes of fatigue in general practice
• Asthma
• Hypo- or
• Anaemia
• Carcinomatosis
hyperthyroidism
• Infections (EBV,
• Sleep apnoea
• Perimenopausal
CMV, hepatitis)
• DM
Investigation If sustained fatigue with no obvious cause, check:
• Urine Dipstick for protein, blood, and glucose
• Blood FBC (all children should have FBC/blood film checked on
presentation with fatigueN); ESR/CRP; U&E, Cr, and eGFR; LFTs and
Ca2+; TFTs; random blood glucose; anti-endomysial antibody test
(to exclude coeliac disease); CK
In addition, check serum ferritin if the patient is a child/young
person. Do not check ferritin in adults unless FBC suggests
iron deficiency.
Use clinical judgement to decide on additional tests to exclude other diagnoses (e.g. serological testing if history suggestive of infection).
Management Treat organic causes. In most no physical cause is found—
reassure. Explaining the relationship of psychological and emotional factors to
fatigue can help patients deal with symptoms. If lasts >6–12wk and symptoms/
signs of depression, consider a trial of antidepressants, e.g. sertraline 50mg od.
Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS, ME) A debilitating and distressing condition. Prevalence: 0.2–2.6%; 5:4 83:2. Cause is unknown though
viral infections (810% after EBV), immunization, chemical toxins (e.g.
organophosphates, chemotherapy drugs) have all been implicated.
0 Fatigue must have been present for ≥4mo for adults and ≥3mo for
children and young people for a diagnosis of CFS to be made.

Tiredness and chronic fatigue syndrome

Clinical features Unexplained persistent and/or recurrent fatigue of new/
definite onset, not explained by other conditions and resulting in d activity
(often starting 1–2d after mental/physical exertion and lasting >24h) and ≥1 of:
• Physical/mental exertion makes
• General malaise
symptoms worse
• Dizziness/nausea
• Headaches of new type, pattern,
• Palpitations without cardiac

• Multi-site muscle/joint pain
• Cognitive dysfunction, e.g.
without inflammation
impaired concentration/memory
• Sore throat
• Tender cervical/axillary LNs
• Difficulty with sleeping
without enlargement
Additional symptoms Must not have pre-dated fatigue. Symptoms may
fluctuate or change in nature over time. Include:
• Fibromyalgia
• Sensitivity to light/
• Postural dizziness
• Feelings of dyspnoea
sound
• Vertigo
• Mood swings
• Altered temperature • Palpitations
• Panic attacks
• IBS
sensation
• Depression
• Food intolerance
• Paraesthesiae
0 Infection/immunization, drugs, caffeine, alcohol, and stress cause setbacks.
• Red flag symptoms that suggest another diagnosis
• Signs/symptoms of
• Significant weight d
cardiorespiratory disease
• Localizing/focal
• Sleep apnoea
neurological signs
• Signs/symptoms of inflammatory • Clinically significant
lymphadenopathy
arthritis or connective tissue
disease
Children presenting with sustained fatigue of any duration
with no obvious cause should always be referred for
paediatric review.
Reconsider diagnosis if none of the following are present Cognitive
difficulties; chronic pain; post-exertional fatigue/malaise; sleep disturbance.
Management Provide support and reassurance—explanation, information ±
self-help groups. Avoid exacerbating factors, e.g. caffeine, alcohol. Advise graded
exercise and regular, limited rest periods (e.g. 30min 4–5x/d). Treat symptoms,
e.g. amitriptyline 10–50mg nocte to help sleep ± relieve headache/neuropathic
pain; SSRI for depression. Refer adults if severe symptoms or symptoms persist
>6mo. Specialist treatments include CBT and rehabilitation programmes.
Prognosis Variable. 55% of adults have symptoms >6mo. Risk i x3 if
history of anxiety/depression. Prognosis in children is better.

Musculoskeletal problems

Miscellaneous conditions
Neuropathic arthritis Charcot’s disease is a rapidly progressive

degeneration in a joint which lacks position sense and protective pain
sensation. Upper limb disease is usually associated with syringomyelia.
Lower limb disease is usually associated with diabetic neuropathy or cauda
equina lesions. The joint may be very deformed but is usually painless.
Treat the underlying condition (e.g. DM). The joint cannot recover, but
refer to orthopaedics for advice on stabilization.

Fibromyalgia Painful, non-articular condition of unknown cause, predominantly involving muscles. Fibromyalgia is common and often results in
significant disability. Peak age 40–50y—90% female.
Diagnostic criteria
• History of widespread pain (defined as pain on both left and right
sides, above and below the waist, together with axial skeletal pain, e.g.
neck or back pain), in combination with:
• Pain in ≥11 out of 18 tender sites (see Figure 15.5) on digital palpation
Other clinical features
• Clinical findings are unremarkable
• Pain is worsened by stress, cold, and activity and associated with
generalized morning stiffness; analgesics, NSAIDs, and local physical
treatments are ineffective and may worsen symptoms
• Sleep patterns are poor—patients tend to wake exhausted and complain
of poor concentration; anxiety and depression scores are high
• Associated symptoms include unexplained headache, paraesthesiae of
hands/feet, urinary frequency, and abdominal symptoms
Investigation Exclude other causes of pain and fatigue (e.g.
hypothyroidism, SLE, Sjögren’s, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory myopathy,
hyperparathyroidism, osteomalacia)—check FBC, ESR, TFTs, U&E, eGFR,
Ca2+, CK, PO43–, ANA, RhF, and immunoglobulins.
Management Multidisciplinary approach is helpful.
• Be supportive—reassurance that there is no serious pathology,
explanation and information are vital
• Low-dose amitriptyline 25–75mg nocte may help with sleep/pain. SSRI,
e.g. sertraline 25–50mg od, may help anxiety, depression, and sleep—
stop if no improvement after a month’s trial
• Graded exercise regimes improve pain, lethargy, mood, and malaise
• Counselling/learning coping strategies/CBT can be beneficial
• X Some patients benefit from injection of hyperalgesic trigger points
with steroid or acupuncture to trigger points

Hypermobility Children/young adults with lax joints; <50% are
symptomatic. Those that have symptoms present with recurrent joint
pains—mainly affecting the knees. Other symptoms include joint effusion,
dislocation, ligamentous injuries, low back pain, and premature OA. The
condition is benign, and joints become stiffer with age. Treatment, when
needed, is with physiotherapy. Rarely associated with congenital disorders,
e.g. Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.

Tietze’s syndrome Idiopathic costochondritis. Pain is enhanced by motion,
coughing, or sneezing. The second rib is most commonly affected. Examination:
marked localized tenderness. Differential diagnosis: muscular sprain; rarely
inflammatory chest wall enthesitis/osteitis s to spondylarthropathy. When
affects lower ribs (L>R), sometimes termed slipped rib syndrome.
Management Explanation and reassurance that nothing serious is
happening; simple OTC analgesia, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds. If pain persists,
local steroid or marcaine injections can be helpful. If not settling consider
referral to rheumatology.

Neurology

Reflexes and muscle power
Automatic responses. The reflex arc goes from the stimulus via a sensory
nerve to the spinal cord and then back along a motor nerve to cause
muscle contraction, without brain involvement.

Key reflexes See Table 16.2. Record whether absent, present with
reinforcement, normal, or brisk 9 clonus.

Absent or d reflex Implies a breach in the reflex arc at:
•
•
•
•
•

Sensory nerve or root, e.g. neuropathy, spondylosis
Anterior horn cell, e.g. MND, polio
Motor nerve or root, e.g. neuropathy, spondylosis
Nerve endings, e.g myasthenia gravis, or
Muscle, e.g. myopathy

i reflex Implies lack of higher control—an upper motor neurone lesion,
e.g. post-stroke.
Clonus Rhythmic involuntary muscle contraction due to abrupt tendon
stretching, e.g. by dorsiflexing the ankle—associated with an UMN lesion.
Reinforcement Method of accentuating reflexes. Use if a reflex seems
absent. Ask patients to clench their teeth (to reinforce upper limb reflexes)
or clench their hands and pull in opposite directions (to accentuate lower
limb reflexes). This effect only lasts ~1s, so ask patients to perform the
manoeuvre simultaneously with the tap from the tendon hammer.

Cranial nerve lesions
Table 16.3 summarizes cranial nerve lesions and their causes. Figure 16.1
shows the cutaneous innervation of the head and neck. Cranial nerves may
be affected at any point from the nerve nucleus within the brainstem to
the point of innervation. Think systematically about the level of the lesion.
Potential sites:
• Muscle
• Neuromuscular junction
• Along the course of the nerve outside the brainstem
• Within the brainstem
0 Any cranial nerve may be affected by DM, MS, tumours, sarcoid, vasculitis or syphilis and >1 nerve may be affected by a lesion. Refer according
to cause to ENT, ophthalmology, or neurology.

Dermatomes and peripheral nerve distribution See Figure 16.2
(b p. 540) and Figure 16.3 (b p. 541).

Mononeuropathy Lesions of individual peripheral (including cranial)

nerves. Causes: trauma, compression, DM, leprosy. If >1 peripheral nerve
is involved, the term mononeuritis multiplex is used. Causes: DM, sarcoid,
cancer, PAN, amyloid, leprosy.

Common mononeuropathies See Table 16.4.
Bell’s palsy Facial palsy without other signs. Unknown cause—possibly

viral. Peak age: 10–40y. 4 = 5. Lifetime incidence: 71:65. Affects left and
right side of the face equally often. Usually sudden onset—may be preceded by pain around the ear. Other possible symptoms: facial numbness;
d noise tolerance; disturbed taste on the anterior part of the tongue.

Management 770% recover completely; 13% have insignificant sequelae;
the remainder have permanent deficit. 85% improve in <3wk—reassure.
Give prednisolone (25mg bd for 10d) if <72h after onset of symptomsR.
Protect eye—tape lid shut and pad at night; glasses in the day 9 artificial
tears if drying. Refer:
• If recovery is not starting after 3wk
• For tarsorraphy if complete or long-standing palsy
• If unacceptable cosmetic result—may benefit from plastic surgery
C. Bell (1774–1842)—Scottish anatomist and surgeon

Ramsay Hunt syndrome (herpes zoster oticus) Severe pain in

the ear precedes facial nerve palsy. Zoster vesicles appear around the ear,
in the external ear canal, on the soft palate, and in the tonsillar fossa. Often
accompanied by deafness 9 vertigo which are slow to resolve and may
result in permanent deficit. Pain usually abates after 48h but post-herpetic
neuralgia can be a problem. If detected <24h after the rash appears, treatment with antivirals (e.g. aciclovir 800mg 5x/d for 1 wk) may be effective.
J. Ramsay Hunt (1872–1937)—US neurologist.

Morton’s metatarsalgia b p. 498
Autonomic neuropathy Postural hypotension (dizziness or syncope

on standing, after exercise or a large meal), impotence, inability to sweat,
vomiting and dysphagia, diarrhoea or constipation, urinary retention or
incontinence, Horner’s syndrome (b p. 300). Check BP lying and standing—a postural drop of ≥30/15mmHg is abnormal. Causes:
• Primary autonomic failure No known cause. Occurs alone or as part
of multisystem atrophy. Typically middle-aged/elderly men. Onset is
insidious. Survival—rarely >10y after diagnosis
• Ageing 25% >74y have postural hypotension. Review medication,
discourage prolonged bed rest. Often associated with disordered
thermoregulation, making elderly people prone to hypothermia.
Exclude other disorders (e.g. DM, multisystem atrophy, drugs) before
putting down to ageing alone

Neurology

Polyneuropathy
Generalized disorder of peripheral nerves, including cranial and autonomic
nerves. Distribution is bilateral, symmetrical, and widespread.
Sensory neuropathy Presents as numbness, tingling, or burning sensation often affecting the extremities first (glove and stocking distribution) or
causing clumsiness handling fine objects (e.g. needle).
Motor neuropathy Presents as progressive weakness or clumsiness
of hands, stumbling/falls on walking, respiratory difficulty (can progress
rapidly). Examination: wasting and weakness most marked distally; reflexes
are d or absent.
Causes See Table 16.5.

Initial investigations Exclude common causes—check blood glucose,
FBC, ESR, U&E, Cr and eGFR, LFTs, TFTs, plasma B12, autoimmune profile,
syphilis serology.
Management Treat cause if possible. Involve physiotherapists and OT.
If sensory neuropathy care of the feet is important to minimize trauma and
consequent disability. Refer if a cause is not found.
• If rapid deterioration admit as acute medical emergency as ventilation may be needed.

Specific polyneuropathies
Charcot–Marie–Tooth syndrome (peroneal muscular atrophy) Presents
at puberty or in early adult life and begins with foot drop and weak legs.
The peroneal muscles are the first to atrophy. The disease spreads to the
hands then arms. Sensation and reflexes are also d. Unknown cause. Once
diagnosis is confirmed treatment is supportive.
J.M. Charcot (1825–93) and P. Marie (1853–1940)—French neurologists;
H.H. Tooth (1856–1925)—English neurologist.
Guillain–Barré polyneuritis Develops within a few weeks of surgery, flu
vaccination or infection (URTI, flu, VZ, HSV, CMV, EBV, Campylobacter,
Mycoplasma). In 40% no precipitating event is found.
Presents with ascending motor neuropathy which may advance fast.
Proximal muscles are more affected than distal muscles. Trunk, respiratory muscles, and cranial nerves are commonly affected.
If suspected admit immediately to hospital as an emergency. Ventilation
on ITU is frequently required; 85% make a complete or near-complete
recovery; 10% are unable to walk alone at 1y; mortality is 10%.
C. Guillain (1876–1961) and J.A. Barré (1880–1967)—French neurologists.
Polio b p. 579
Refsum’s syndrome Rare autosomal recessive disorder which presents
in the second decade or later with sensorimotor polyneuropathy, ataxia,
visual, and/or hearing problems. Treatment involves dietary restriction
(avoidance of chlorophyll-containing foods) and plasmapheresis.
S. Refsum (1907–1991)—Norwegian physician.

Walking problems
Walking difficulty (‘off legs’) Common symptom in the
elderly. Causes:
• Musculoskeletal Osteoarthritis or RA, osteoporotic
fractures, fractured neck of femur, osteomalacia, Paget’s
disease, polymyalgia rheumatica
• Psychological Depression, bereavement, fear of falling
• Neurological Stroke, Parkinson’s disease, peripheral neuropathy
• Spinal cord compression
• Systemic Pneumonia, UTI, anaemia, hypothyroidism, renal failure,
infection, hypothermia
Management Treat according to cause. Refer (e.g. to rapid response
team, social services, or elderly care) if inadequate support at home,
cause warrants referral, or no cause is found.
Abnormal gait Gait means manner of walking. Abnormal gait can give
clues to the underlying problem.
Abnormal movements Normal gait is interrupted by abnormal movements, e.g. choreiform movements, athetoid movements or hemiballismus. May indicate underlying neurological problem, e.g. cerebral palsy,
Huntington’s chorea.
Antalgic gait Gait adjusts to try to minimize pain in a joint—usually OA
hip. The patient leans towards the affected side and takes a rapid step
on that side followed by a slower step on the contralateral side—check
Trendelenburg’s sign (b p. 488).
Drunken gait Apart from alcohol, the other major cause of drunken gait
is a cerebellar lesion. Features:
• Wide-based gait or reeling gait on a narrow base
• Feet are often raised too high and placed over carefully, with the
patient looking ahead
• If a cerebellar lesion, the patient falls to the side of the lesion
Foot drop Patients trip frequently or walk with a high stepping gait. On
examination, patients are unable to walk on their heels and cannot dorsiflex their foot. Check ankle jerk. Causes:
• Common peroneal palsy, e.g. due to trauma—normal ankle jerk
• Sciatica—ankle jerk absent
• L4, L5 root lesion—ankle jerk may be absent
• Peripheral motor neuropathy, e.g. alcoholic—ankle jerk weak or absent
• Distal myopathy—ankle jerk weak or absent
• Motor neurone disease—i ankle jerk
Hemiplegic gait Style of walking seen in patients with UMN lesions. Features:
• Arm adducted and internally rotated, elbow flexed and pronated
± finger flexion
• Foot is plantar flexed and the leg swings in a lateral arc
Frontal lesions Marked unsteadiness—the feet appear stuck to the floor
causing a wide-based, shuffling gait.

Walking problems

Parkinsonian gait Seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease and other
causes of parkinsonism. Features:
• Shuffling gait Short steps, with the feet barely leaving the ground,
producing an audible shuffling noise. May trip over small obstacles
• Turning ‘en bloc’ Keeping the neck and trunk rigid, and requiring
multiple small steps to accomplish a turn
• Gait freezing Inability to move feet. May worsen in tight, cluttered
spaces or when attempting to initiate gait
• Festinant gait Flexed posture as if hurrying to keep up with feet
• Lack of normal arm swing
Scissor gait As the name implies, the patient walks as if his/her legs were
like a pair of scissors. Associated with spastic paraplegia
• Both legs are held rigid with plantar flexion of the ankle, extension of
the knee, and adduction/internal rotation of the hips
• The patient walks on tiptoe and the knees rub together/cross during
the walking cycle
• Often accompanied by complex movements of the upper limbs to
assist the walking movements
Sensory ataxic gait Loss of proprioception due to peripheral neuropathy
or spinal cord disease (e.g. cervical spondylosis, MS, syphilis, combined
degeneration of the cord) results in an ataxic gait similar to that seen with
cerebellar disease. Check Romberg’s test. Features:
• Broad-based gait with a tendency to stamp feet down clumsily
• Patient tends to look at feet throughout the walking cycle
• Romberg’s sign +ve
Waddling gait Typically seen in patients with proximal myopathy, e.g. due
to muscular dystrophy. Other causes: pregnancy, congenital dislocation of
the hip. Features:
• Broad-based gait. The pelvis drops to the side of the leg being raised
• The patient moves his/her body and hips to accommodate this,
resulting in a duck-like waddle in the swing phase
• Commonly accompanied by i forward curvature of the lower spine

Examining gait Note abnormalities and any aids/assistance required.
• Make sure that you can see the legs well
• Ask the patient to stand up from a chair without support. If able to
do that, repeat with feet together and/or with eyes closed
• Ask the patient to stand still with feet together. If able to do that ask
the patient to close his eyes and see what happens (Romberg’s sign)
• Ask the patient to walk normally for 75m, turn round, and walk back
• Ask the patient to walk heel-to-toe (testing for cerebellar disease)
• Ask the patient to stand with the feet together
• With eyes open—testing cerebellar and posterior column function
• With eyes closed—testing posterior column function
• On toes alone—impossible with S1 lesions
• On heels alone—impossible if L4/L5 lesion

Neurology

Other movement problems
Abnormal gait b p. 544
Cramp Painful muscle spasm. Common—especially at night and after

exercise. Rarely associated with disease—salt depletion, muscle ischaemia, myopathy. Forearm cramps suggest motor neurone disease. Night
cramps in the elderly may respond to quinine bisulphate 300mg nocte
twice weekly.

Dystonia Prolonged muscle contraction producing abnormal postures
or repetitive movements.
• Spasmodic torticollis Head is pulled to one side and held there by a
contracting sternomastoid muscle. Treat with physiotherapy
• Blepharospasm Involuntary contraction of the orbicularis oculi. If
troublesome, consider treatment with diazepam (but be careful to
avoid dependence) or refer for treatment with botulinum toxin
• Writer’s cramp Spasm of the hand and forearm muscles on writing
• Generalized dystonia Primary generalized dystonia is usually genetic.
Specialist treatment from a neurologist is essential. First-line drug
treatment is with levodopa. If that is ineffective, an anticholinergic
drug (e.g. trihexyphenidyl) can be helpful in controlling muscle
spasms and tremor. Second-line treatments may include clonazepam,
tetrabenazine, baclofen, botulinum toxin injections. Deep brain
stimulation may also be helpful
• Secondary dystonia Symptoms of dystonia that result from drugs
or other medical conditions. Includes: drug-induced dystonia (acute
dystonia or tardive dyskinesia); dystonia associated with cerebral palsy;
dystonia assosicated with Parkinson’s disease; dystonia associated with
other brain injury or disease; and dystonia associated with metabolic
conditions (e.g. Wilson’s disease)
Tardive dyskinesia Involuntary chewing and grimacing movements,
resulting from long-term neuroleptic treatment (metoclopramide and
prochlorperazine are also possible causes). Withdraw neuroleptic—if no
improvement after 3–6mo consider tetrabenazine 25–50mg tds po.
Patient information and support
The Dystonia Society F 020 7793 3650 M www.dystonia.org.uk

Myoclonus Sudden, involuntary focal or general jerks. May be normal,
especially if occurs when falling asleep. Other causes:
• Neurodegenerative disease (e.g. CJD)
• Myoclonic epilepsy
• Benign essential myoclonus (generalized myoclonus beginning
in childhood as muscle twitches, may be inherited as autosomal
dominant)
• Asterixis (metabolic flap—e.g liver failure, uraemia)

Treatment If needed treat with sodium valproate or clonazepam.

Other movement problems

Dyspraxia Impairment of performance of complex movements despite
preservation of ability to perform their individual components. Test by
asking the patient to perform everyday tasks (e.g. ask to dress/undress),
copy complex hand movements and do familiar sequences of movements
(e.g. ‘head, shoulders, knees, and toes’).
Childhood b p. 916
Adults Most common causes are stroke or space-occupying lesion.
Involve rehabilitation services and OT.
• Dressing dyspraxia Patient is unsure of the orientation of clothes on
his/her body.
• Constructional dyspraxia Difficulty in assembling objects or drawing
(ask to draw 5-pointed star)
• Gait dyspraxia Gait disorder although the lower limbs function
normally—more common amongst the elderly

Tremor
• Resting tremor Present at rest but abolished on voluntary movement.
Most common cause—PD when tremor is rhythmic
• Intention tremor Irregular large amplitude tremor worse on
movement, e.g. reaching for something. Typical of cerebellar disease
• Tremors on movement Thyrotoxicosis, anxiety, benign essential
tremor (inherited), and drugs (e.g. β-agonists) cause a fine tremor
abolished at rest. Alcohol and β-blockers may help

Asterixis Intermittent lapses of an assumed posture. May involve arms,

neck, tongue, jaw, and eyelids. Usually bilateral, absent at rest, and asynchronous on each side. Causes: liver failure (flapping tremor), heart failure,
respiratory failure, renal failure, hypoglycaemia, barbiturate intoxication.

Athetosis Slow, confluent, often rhythmic, purposeless movements of
hands, tongue, fingers, or face. Causes: cerebral palsy, kernicterus.
Chorea Non-rhythmic, jerky, purposeless movements (especially hands),
with voluntary movements possible in between. Most common causes: cerebral palsy, Huntington’s chorea, Sydenham’s chorea.

Ballismus/hemiballismus Large-amplitude, involuntary flinging
movements of limbs. May occur after stroke, in Huntington’s disease or
with high doses of levodopa for PD.
Tics Brief, repeated, and stereotyped movements which are able to be

suppressed voluntarily for a while. Common in children and usually resolve
spontaneously. Consider clonazepam or clonidine if tics are severe.

Speech problems
Hoarseness b p. 936
Stammer Disorder of rhythm and fluency of speech in which syllables,

words, or phrases are repeated. 4: 5 84:1. Cause: unknown. Can result in
stress and embarrassment.
• Younger children Often short-lived; usually resolves spontaneously
• Older children/adults Refer to speech therapy

Dysarthria Difficulty with articulation due to incoordination or weak-

ness of the musculature of speech. Language is normal. Ask to repeat ‘baby
hippopotamus’ or ‘British constitution’. Treat the cause if possible otherwise support with speech therapy and aids to communication. Causes: see
Table 16.6.

Dysphasia Impairment of language due to brain damage to the dominant hemisphere. The left hemisphere is dominant for 99% of right-handed
people and 60% of left-handers. In most cases, due to stroke or brain
tumour. Rarely due to head injury or dementia. Assessment and classification: see Table 16.7. Mixed pictures are common. Treatment:
• Speech therapy may, or may not, be helpful
• Support, e.g. dysphasia groups
• Aids to communication, e.g. computers, picture boards

Myasthenia gravis Autoimmune disease. Antibodies to the acetylcholine
receptor cause a deficit of receptors at the neuromuscular junction l muscle weakness. Antibodies are detectable in 90%. 5:4 82:1. Associated with
thymic tumours and other autoimmune disease, e.g. RA, SLE, hyperthyroidism. Generally follows a relapsing or slowly progressive course. If thymoma
present, 5y survival 8 30%.
Presentation Young adults with easy fatigability of muscles. Commonly
affected muscles are the:
• Orbital muscles causing ptosis and diplopia, and
• Bulbar muscles causing slurring of speech—ask to count to 50
Weakness is exacerbated by pregnancy, infection, drugs (e.g. β-blockers,
opiates, tetracycline, quinine), climate change, emotion, and exercise.
Management If suspected refer for confirmation by a neurologist and
specialist treatment. Treated with:
• Anticholinesterase, e.g. pyridostigmine
• Immunosuppression with prednisolone, methotrexate, or azathioprine
• Thymectomy l remission in 30% and benefit in another 40%
• Plasmapheresis
Lambert–Eaton syndrome (or myasthenic syndrome) Occurs in association
with small cell carcinoma of the lung or rarely autoimmune disease. Differs
from myasthenia gravis by the tendency to hyporeflexia. Autonomic
involvement is common. Proximal limb muscles/trunk are most commonly
involved. Specialist treatment is essential.

Neurology

Fits, faints, and funny turns
Blackouts, faints, and funny turns are all common presentations to general
practice. The major questions which should be asked seeing an individual
who has had a funny turn are:
• Is it epilepsy?
• If it is epilepsy, then what kind?
• If it is not epilepsy, then is there another serious underlying cause,
e.g. heart disease?

History A good history from the patient and ideally from a witness is
essential in the correct diagnosis. Ask:
• What happened?
• When and where? Particularly, did it start during sleep?
• Were there any precipitating events?
• Were there any warning signs (e.g. aura, feeling going to faint, etc.)?
• Does the patient remember the whole episode? If not, which bits are
missing and how long are the gaps?
• Did the patient lose consciousness? Quite frequently, patients describe
episodes of dizziness or unsteadiness/falling as ‘funny turns’
• Did the patient jerk his/her limbs? If so, was the jerking generalized or
restricted to one area of the body?
• What did the patient look like during the attack? An eye witness
account is helpful
• Did anything else happen during the attack (e.g. tongue biting,
incontinence)?
• What happened after the attack? Was the patient conscious straight
away? Was there disorientation, drowsiness, or headache?
Also check
• General medical history, including cardiac history and history of other
neurological symptoms
• Psychiatric history—anxiety, depression, panic attacks?
• Past medical history—birth trauma, febrile convulsions in childhood,
significant head injury, and/or meningitis/encephalitis
• Family history—epilepsy
• Substance abuse? Drugs or alcohol?

Examination Complete general and neurological examination. Particularly
check for:
• Skin changes Café-au-lait spots (neurofibromatosis); adenoma
sebaceum (tuberous sclerosis); trigeminal capillary haemangioma
(Sturge–Weber syndrome)
• Cardiovascular abnormalities Heart rate and rhythm, murmurs,
carotid bruits, BP
• Focal neurological deficits Suggest presence of a structural
neurological lesion
Funny turns in small children b p. 896
Epilepsy b p. 574

Fits, faints, and funny turns

Syncope Abrupt and transient loss of consciousness due to a sudden
d in cerebral perfusion. Common—prevalence 76% adults. It has many
causes, ranging from benign (vasovagal syncope) to fatal (sustained ventricular tachycardia); the prognosis depends on the cause.
Diagnosis A typical attack takes the following pattern:
• Prodromal symptoms Nausea, clammy sweating, blurring, greying and
possible loss of vision, light-headedness, dizziness and tinnitus, yawning.
The collection is characteristic
• Anoxic phase Loss of consciousness, pallor, sweating, pupil dilatation,
tachypnoea, bradycardia. Muscle tone is d, causing eyes to roll up and
the patient to fall. May be accompanied by a few myoclonic jerks as
the patient falls
• Recovery In the horizontal position, skin colour, pulse, and
consciousness usually return within seconds. 0 If the patient is unable
to fall and is kept upright a s anoxic seizure may occur
• After-effects Confusion, amnesia, and drowsiness are not prolonged.
Injury and incontinence are rare but may occur. Tongue biting is
very rare
Presyncope Is the term applied to a less severe attack with partial loss of
consciousness and a near fall.
Simple faint/vasovagal attack Common. Peripheral vasodilatation, bradycardia, and venous pooling l postural hypotension. Often cause is unclear, though
5 > 4. Known precipitants: fright (e.g. during venesection) or emotion. Exclude
other reasons for loss of consciousness. No treatment needed—reassure.

Dizziness and giddiness Distinguish between true vertigo (the illusion of rotatory movement—the room spinning) and a feeling of unsteadiness or light-headedness:
• Vertigo b p. 950
• Imbalance Implies difficulty in walking straight, e.g. from disease of
peripheral nerves, posterior columns, or cerebellum
• Faintness The feeling of being about to pass out. Associated with
some seizure disorders and a variety of non-neurological conditions
(e.g. postural hypotension, vasovagal fainting; hyperventilation;
hypoglycaemia; arrhythmias; cough syncope). Sometimes >1 element
coexists
Hyperventilation and panic attacks b p. 1120
0 Usually history is diagnostic but occasionally, seizures of temporal lobe
origin may have similar symptomatology.
Hypoglycaemia Affects patients with DM—particularly those tak-

ing insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents. Produces autonomic changes,
e.g. pallor, sweating and tachycardia, and behavioural changes (confusion,
altered personality). If action is not taken to i blood sugar, coma ± fitting
ensues—b p. 1100.

Abnormal perceptions (e.g hallucinations—b p. 988).

Assessment of headache
Common presenting complaint. The skill lies in deciding which headaches
are benign, needing no intervention, and which require action.

History
• Is there >1 type of headache? Take a separate history for each.
• Time When did the headaches start? New or recently changed
headache calls for especially careful assessment. How often do they
happen? Do they have any pattern? (e.g. constant, episodic, daily)
How long do they last? Why is the patient coming to the doctor now?
A headache diary over >8wk may help if long-standing headaches
• Character Nature/quality, site, and spread of the pain. Associated
symptoms, e.g. nausea/vomiting, visual disturbance, photophobia,
neurological symptoms
• Cause Predisposing and/or trigger factors; aggravating and/or relieving
factors; relationship to menstrual cycle; family history
• Response Details of medication used (type, dose, frequency, timing).
What does the patient do, e.g. can the patient continue work?
• Health between attacks Do headaches go completely or is the patient
unwell between attacks? Other past/current medical problems
• Anxieties and concerns Of the patient/family

Examination In acute, severe headache, examine for fever and purpuric

skin rash. In all cases check BP, brief neurological examination including
fundi, visual acuity, and gait, palpation of the temporal region/sinuses for
tenderness, and examination of the neck. In young children, measure head
circumference and plot on a centile chart.

• Red flags
• Fever and worsening headache
± purpuric rash/meningism
• Thunderclap headache (reaching
peak intensity in <5min)
• Progressive headache,
worsening over weeks
• Headache associated with
postural change, sneezing,
coughing, or exercise

• Recent head injury (<3mo)
• Papilloedema
• Change in personality/new
cognitive or neurological deficit
• New onset in a patient with a
history of HIV or cancer.
• Headache with atypical aura
(>1h ± motor weakness)
• Aura for first time and using CHC

Investigation Often not needed. ESR if temporal arteritis is suspected.
Differential diagnosis and management See Table 16.8. i BP may
cause acute or chronic headache. Direct treatment at the cause.

Meningism Headache, stiff neck, and photophobia. Associated with
meningitis. May also be seen with encephalitis and SAH.

Neurology

Migraine
Migraine affects 15% of the UK population. 4:5 81:3. One in three experiences significant disability. Caused by disturbance of cerebral blood flow
under the influence of 5HT.

Aura Occurs with or without headache. Symptoms arise over ≥5min and
last 5–60min before resolving completely. Diagnose if:
• Visual symptoms, e.g. flickering lights, spots, lines; partial loss of vision
• Sensory symptoms, e.g. numbness; paraesthesia and/or
• Speech disturbance
Atypical aura Consider referral for further investigation if: motor weakness; double vision; visual symptoms affecting only one eye; poor balance or
d level of consciousness.
Migraine headache Moderate to severe unilateral or bilateral throbbing/pulsating headache that lasts 4–72h (1–72h in children) and prevents
usual activities. May occur with or without aura and be associated with
nausea/vomiting ± i sensitivity to light/noise.
• Episodic Occurs on <15d/mo
• Chronic Occurs on ≥15d/mo over >3mo
History, examination, and differential diagnosis b p. 552

Management of an acute attackN Combination therapy with:
• Triptan (e.g. sumatriptan 50–100mg po)—choice depends on cost. Not
effective if taken before the headache develops. Stops 70–85% attacks.
Start with lowest dose and i as needed. If consistently ineffective try an
alternative triptan. Consider nasal triptan as first-line if aged 12–17y
• NSAID (e.g. naproxen 500mg bd) or paracetamol (1g qds)
± antiemetic (e.g. prochlorperazine 5mg, metoclopramide 10mg, or
domperidone 10–20mg)—even if no nausea/vomiting
If oral preparations are ineffective/not tolerated, offer metoclopramide 10mg pr or buccal prochlorperazine 3–6mg and consider adding a
non-oral NSAID (e.g. diclofenac 100mg pr) or triptan (e.g. sumatriptan
20mg nasal spray or 6mg sc).
• Do not offer ergots or opioids for the acute treatment of migraine.
Treatment of recurrence within the same attack Repeat symptomatic
treatments within their dose limitations—pre-emptively if recurrence
is usual/expected. If using triptans, a second dose may be effective, but
repeated dosing can cause rebound headache. Naratriptan and eletriptan
are associated with relatively low recurrence rates.
Management of chronic migraineG Aims to control symptoms and
minimize impact on the patient’s life. Cure is not a realistic aim.
Trigger factors Half have a trigger for their migraine. Consider:
• Psychological factors Stress/relief of stress; anxiety/depression;
extreme emotions, e.g. anger or grief
• Environmental factors Loud noise, bright/flickering lights, strong
perfume, stuffy atmosphere, VDUs, strong winds, extreme heat/cold

Migraine

• Food factors Lack of food/infrequent meals; foods containing
monosodium glutamate, caffeine, and tyramine; specific foods,
e.g. chocolate, citrus fruits, cheese; alcohol, especially red wine.
• Sleep Overtiredness (physical/mental); changes in sleep patterns
(e.g. late nights, weekend lie-in, shift work, holidays); long-distance travel
• Health factors Hormonal changes (e.g. monthly periods, CHC, HRT,
the menopause); i BP; toothache or pain in the eyes, sinuses,
or neck; unaccustomed physical activity
Assessing severity Assessment scales, e.g Migraine Disability Assessment
Score (MIDAS—see Box 16.1 b p. 585), can be useful in assessing impact
of symptoms on daily life and monitoring response to treatment.
General measures Reassure. Instruct about management of acute attacks.
A diary can be used to identify trigger factors, assess headache frequency,
severity, medication usage/overusage, and response to treatment. Avoid
trigger factors where possible. Give advice on relaxation techniques and
stress management. Do not offer CHC to women with migraine, especially if aura (b p. 753).
ProphylaxisN Consider if ≥4 attacks/mo or severe attacks. d attacks by
750%. Try a drug for 2mo before deeming it ineffective. If effective, continue for 6mo then review to consider d dose slowly before stopping.
• 1st-line Propranolol S/R 80–160mg od/bd or topiramate 25–50mg od/
bd—start at low dose and i dose every 2–4wk; 0 Topiramate is
teratogenic and may interact with hormonal contraception
• 2nd-line Gabapentin (up to 1200mg/d in divided doses) or acupuncture
(up to 10 sessions over 5–8wk)
• 3rd-line Botulinum type A toxin may be helpful for patients who have
chronic migraine, do not have medication-overuse headache and have
not responded to ≥3 different prophylactic medicationsN
Alternative therapies Riboflavin 400mg od may d frequency/intensity of
headachesN; feverfew 200mg daily mayd symptoms after 6wk useC.

Menstrual migraineN Suspect if migraine occurs from 2d before to
3d after start of period on at least 2 out of 3 consecutive months (use
headache diary). If predictable menstrual-related migraine that does not
respond to standard acute treatment, consider frovatriptan (2.5mg bd) or
zolmitriptan (2.5 mg bd/tds) on the days that migraine is expected.
0 >1 type of headache may coexist—50% migraine sufferers develop
tension type headache resulting in background pain between attacks.
Consider each separately.

Other headaches and facial pain
Assessment and differential diagnosis of headache b p. 552
Migraine b p. 554
Chronic daily headache Prevalence 4%. Defined as any headache

that occurs >15d/mo. Common causes: tension-type headache, cervicogenic headache (b p. 474), medication-overuse headache, migraine,
errors of refraction (usually headache is mild, frontal, in the eyes themselves, and absent on waking). Treat the cause (may be >1).

Tension type headacheN Associated with stress and anxiety and/or

functional or structural abnormalities of the head or neck. Prevalence 82%.
5:4 82:1. Symptoms begin aged <10y in 15% patients. Prevalence d with
age. Family history of similar headaches is common (40%), but twin studies
do not suggest a genetic basis. Distinguish between episodic and chronic
tension-type headache:
• Episodic Defined as headache lasting 30min–7d and occurring <180d/y
(<15d/mo)
• Chronic Headaches on ≥15d/mo (≥180d/y) for ≥3mo
In both cases pain:
• Is bilateral, pressing, and/or tightening in quality
• Of mild/moderate intensity
• Does not prohibit activities
• Is not associated with vomiting • Is not aggravated by physical activity
Non-drug management Reassure no serious underlying pathology. Try
measures to alleviate stress—relaxation; massage; yoga; exercise. Treat
musculoskeletal symptoms with physiotherapy.
Drug therapy Analgesics are of limited value and might make matters
worse (see Medication-overuse headache).
• Acute management Simple analgesia, e.g. paracetamol, ibuprofen.
Avoid codeine-containing preparations and other opioids
• Prophylaxis Acupuncture—up to 10 sessions over 5–8wk

Cluster headaches Extremely painful headaches focussed around

1 eye with associated autonomic symptoms on that side (drooping eyelid,
constricted pupil, red watery eye, runny or blocked nose, forehead sweating). Rare <20y of age. 4:5 86:1. More common in smokers. Pain lasts
15–180min and occurs from 1x every 2d to 8x/day. Recurrences affect
the same side. Onset is often predictable (1–2h after falling asleep; after
alcohol). 2 patterns:
• Episodic Remissions of >1mo
• Chronic Remissions of <1mo in a 12mo period

Management Refer for specialist advice/neuroimaging for first bout of
cluster headache. Drug treatments:
• Acute attack 100% oxygen (>12L/min) for 10–20min; 5HT1 agonists,
e.g. sumatriptan (6mg sc or 20mg nasal)—stops 75% in <15min
• Prophylaxis Consider verapamil 80mg tds/qds if attacks are frequent
(needs ECG monitoring—seek specialist advice if unfamiliar with use).
More effective if initiated early at the start of a new cluster. Refer for
specialist advice if no response to verapamil.

Other headaches and facial pain

Medication overuse (analgesic) headacheN Persistent headache

in patients with other causes of pain who are overusing analgesics. Affects
1 in 50 adults; 5:4 85:1. Consider if headache develops/worsens when
taking analgesic medication for ≥3mo. Implicated drugs include:
• Triptans, opioids, ergots, or combination analgesics on ≥10d/mo
• Paracetamol, aspirin, or NSAID on ≥15d/mo
Management Explain the condition to the patient. Advise stopping overused medication abruptly for at least 1mo. Provide follow-up and support
over 4–8wk; warn that symptoms may worsen initially (day 3–7) before
improving. Review treatment of any underlying problem (e.g. migraine or
chronic musculoskeletal pain). Consider specialist referral if taking strong
opioids or recurrent, failed attempts to stop medication overuse.

Facial pain Treat the cause. Common causes include: trigeminal neural-

gia; temporomandibular joint disorders; dental disorders; sinusitis; migrainous neuralgia; shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia. No cause is found in
many patients—it is then termed atypical facial pain. Atypical facial pain
may respond to simple analgesia with paracetamol or NSAID. If this fails,
try nerve painkillers, e.g. amitriptyline 10–75mg nocte. If troublesome
symptoms, refer to ENT, maxillofacial surgery, or neurology.
Trigeminal neuralgia Paroxysms of intense stabbing, burning, or
‘electric shock’ type pain, lasting seconds to minutes in the trigeminal
(V) nerve distribution; 96% unilateral. Mandibular/maxillary > ophthalmic
division. Between attacks there are no symptoms. Frequency of attacks
ranges from hundreds/d to remissions lasting years. Pain may be provoked
by movement of the face (talking, eating, laughing) or touching the skin
(shaving, washing). Can occur at any age but more common >50y. 5 > 4.
Unknown cause but associated with MS.
Management Spontaneous remission may occur.
• Carbamazepine Start at low dose, e.g. 100mg od/bd, and i dose over
weeks until symptoms are controlled. Usual dose 8200–400mg tds.
Oxcarbazine is an alternative
• Pregabalin Start with 75mg bd. Increase as needed to a maximum of
300mg bd. If ineffective, consider combining with amitriptyline
• Amitriptyline Start at a dose of 25mg at 5–7 p.m.—10mg if elderly.
i dose by 10–25mg every 5–7d to a maximum of 75mg in a single dose
as needed. Consider combining with pregabalin if ineffective alone
Refer to neurology if <50y; neurological deficit between attacks; treatment
with first-line agents fails—specialist options include lamotrigine, duloxetine,
baclofen, phenytoin, or surgical intervention.

Neurology

Raised intracranial pressure
Raised intracranial pressure (i ICP) usually presents with increasing headache associated with drowsiness, listlessness, vomiting, focal neurology,
and/or seizures. Causes include: p or s tumours, head injury, intracranial
haemorrhage, hydrocephalus, meningitis, encephalitis, brain abscess, and
cerebral oedema (s to tumour, trauma, infection, ischaemia).

Clinical features of i ICP • If suspected, admit as an emergency.
•
•
•
•
•
•

Drowsiness
d conscious level
Irritability
VI nerve palsy
Papilloedema
Dropping pulse

• Rising BP
• Focal neurological signs—due
to underlying pathology
• Pupil changes—constriction, then
dilatation

Benign intracranial hypertension Symptoms/signs of a space-occupying

lesion, but none is found. Usually occurs in young, obese women. Cause
unknown. Treated with repeat lumbar puncture, ventriculo-peritoneal
shunt, diuretics, or dexamethasone. Usually resolves—but 10% recur later.
Brain abscess May be single or multiple. Organisms reach the brain via
the blood stream, direct implantation, or local extension from adjacent
sites (e.g. sinusitis). Presents with i ICP, focal neurological signs, systemic
effects of infection, and/or local effects due to the cause. Usually, features
develop over 2–3 wk—occasionally, more slowly; in the immunosuppressed, onset is rapid. If suspected, admit as an emergency. Treatment is
with IV antibiotics ± surgical drainage. Mortality is 20–30%. 50% of survivors have long-term neurological deficit; 30% epilepsy.

Intracranial tumours
• 1˚ tumours 70%. Classified by whether they are benign/malignant and
cell type. Glioma is an umbrella term meaning tumour of nervous system
origin. Common subtypes: astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma, glioblastoma
multiforme, and ependymoma. Tumours of the meninges (meningiomas)
and cerebral blood vessels (cerebellar haemangioblastomas) can also occur.
• 2˚ brain tumours 30%—usually from carcinoma of breast, lung, or
melanoma—in 50%, tumours are multiple
Presentation 0 <1% of patients with headache have a brain tumour.
• i ICP 23–50% have papilloedema at presentation; headache 25–35%
• Seizures 25–30%. Suspect in all adults who have a first seizure—
especially if focal or with localizing aura. Refer for urgent assessmentN
• Evolving focal neurology Depends on the site. >50% have focal
neurology at presentation. Frontal lobe lesions tend to present late
• False localizing signs Caused by i ICP. VI nerve palsy (causing double
vision) is most common due to its long intracranial course
• Subtle personality change 16–20% at presentation—irritability, lack of
application, lack of initiative, socially inappropriate behaviour
• Local effects Skull base masses, proptosis, epistaxis
Differential diagnosis Stroke, MS, head injury, vasculitis, encephalitis,
Todd’s palsy (b p. 574), metabolic/electrolyte disturbance, other causes
of space-occupying lesion—aneurysm, abscess, chronic subdural haematoma, granuloma, cyst.

Raised intracranial pressure

Prognosis Gliomas all have <50% 5y survival. Depending on site, meningiomas and haemangioblastomas have better prognosis.

• Referral guidelines for suspected brain tumourN
Refer urgently (to be seen in <2wk) Patients in whom a brain tumour
is suspected with:
• Symptoms related to the CNS, including:
• Headaches
• Progressive neurological deficit
• Mental changes
• New-onset seizures
• Cranial nerve palsy
• Unilateral sensorineural
deafness
• Headaches of recent onset accompanied by features suggestive of
raised intracranial pressure, e.g.:
• Vomiting
• Posture-related headache
• Drowsiness
• Pulse-synchronous tinnitus
or accompanied by other focal or non-focal neurological symptoms,
e.g. blackout, change in personality, or memory
• A new, qualitatively different, unexplained headache that becomes
progressively severe
• Suspected recent-onset seizures
Consider urgent referral In patients with rapid progression of:
• Subacute focal neurological deficit
• Unexplained cognitive impairment, behavioural disturbance or
slowness, or a combination of these
• Personality changes confirmed by a witness and for which there is no
reasonable explanation even in the absence of the other symptoms
and signs of a brain tumour
Consider non-urgent referral Or discussion with specialist for unexplained
headaches of recent onset:
• Present for ≥1 mo
• Not accompanied by features suggestive of i intracranial pressure

Hydrocephalus Dilatation of the cerebral ventricles and accumulation
of CSF. May be:
• Communicating Due to d reabsorption of CSF. Causes:
post-meningitis; SAH (80% develop some degree of hydrocephalus);
trauma; neoplastic infiltration in the subarachnoid space
• Non-communicating CSF flow is blocked due to an obstruction
within the ventricles. Due to congenital malformations, tumour, brain
abscesss, SAH, meningeal scarring due to meningitis, or cranial trauma

Presentation and management In infants presents with macrocephaly
(b p. 893); convulsions; developmental delay; and/or spasticity. In adults
presents with i ICP. Refer for urgent neurological assessment. 0 All
patients with a CSF shunt should have pneumococcal vaccination.

Intracranial bleeds
Haemorrhagic stroke b p. 562
Subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) Spontaneous bleeding into the

subarachnoid space. Incidence 15/100,000. 5 > 4. Peak age 35–65y. Frequently
fatal. Causes:
• Bleeding disorder
• No cause (15%)
• Mycotic aneurysm s
• Rupture of congenital berry
to endocarditis (rare)
aneurysm (70%)
• Arteriovenous malformation (15%)
Risk factors Smoking, alcohol, i BP, less common pre-menopause. Berry
aneurysms may run in families and are associated with polycystic kidneys,
coarctation of the aorta, and Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.
Presentation
• Typically presents as a sudden devastating headache—‘thunderclap
headache’—often occipital
• Rarely (6%) preceded by a ‘sentinel headache’ representing a small leak
ahead of a larger bleed
• Vomiting and collapse with loss of consciousness ± fitting ± focal
neurology follow
Examination May be nothing to find initially. Neck stiffness takes 6h to
develop. In later stages:
• Focal neurology
• Papilloedema
• d level of consciousness
• Retinal and other intraocular
haemorrhages
Action If suspected admit immediately as a medical emergency. Only 1 in
4 admitted with suspected SAH turn out to have one. In most no cause
for the headache is found.

Subdural haemorrhage Bleeding is from bridging veins between cortex and venous sinuses, resulting in accumulation of blood between dura
and arachnoid. Causes: trauma (may be trivial); idiopathic.
Risk factors Age, alcohol, falls, epilepsy, anticoagulant therapy.
Presentation Often insidious and history may go back several weeks:
• Personality change
• Fluctuation of conscious
• Unsteadiness on feet
level (35%)
• Physical and intellectual slowing • Slowly evolving stroke (e.g.
hemiparesis)
• Sleepiness
• Symptoms/signs of i ICP
• Headache
Differential diagnosis Stroke, cerebral tumour, dementia.
Action If suspected, admit as a medical emergency for further investigation. Evacuation of clot is possible even in very elderly patients and often
results in full recovery.

Intracranial bleeds

Extradural haemorrhage Blood accumulated between the dura and
bone of the skull. Usually occurs after head injury.

Presentation Deterioration of level of consciousness after head injury
that initially produced no loss of consciousness or after initial post-injury
drowsiness has resolved. This ‘lucid’ interval may last anything from a few
hours to a few days. May be accompanied by worsening headache, vomiting, confusion ± focal neurological signs.
Action If suspected, admit as an emergency for further investigation. Early
evacuation of clot carries excellent prognosis. Outlook is less good if
coma pre-op.

Acute stroke
Clinical syndrome typified by rapidly developing signs of focal or global
disturbance of cerebral functions, lasting >24h or leading to death, with no
apparent causes other than of vascular origin. Common and devastating
condition—most common cause of adult disability in the UK. Half of all
strokes occur in people >70y.

Causes
• Cerebral infarction (770%). Atherothrombotic occlusion or embolism.
Sources of embolism: left atrium (AF) or left ventricle (MI or heart
failure). Ischaemia causes direct injury from lack of blood supply
• Intracerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage (719%). Haemorrhage
causes direct neuronal injury and pressure exerted by the blood
results in adjacent ischaemia
• Rare causes Sudden d BP, vasculitis, venous-sinus thrombosis, carotid
artery dissection

Presentation
• History Sudden onset of CNS symptoms or stepwise progression of
symptoms over hours or days
• Examination Conscious level—may be d or normal; neurological signs
(including dysphagia and incontinence); BP; heart rate and rhythm;
heart murmurs; carotid bruits; systemic signs of infection or neoplasm
Differential diagnosis Decompensation after recovery from previous
stroke (e.g. due to infection, metabolic disorder); SOL—1o or 2o cerebral
neoplasm; cerebral abscess; trauma—subdural haematoma, traumatic
brain injury; epileptic seizure; migraine; MS.

Acute management Admit all patients who have suffered an acute
stroke to hospital. Treatment of stroke in a stroke unit d mortality and
morbidityC. Thrombolysis early after stroke results in better outcome, so
do not delay referral until the patient is seen. If stroke is suspected admit
directly to hospital by emergency ambulance.
• Do not give aspirin prior to admission.

Transient ischaemic attack (TIA) History is as for stroke but recovery takes place within 24h of initial symptoms. Patients with a history of TIA
have a 20% risk of stroke in the following month with highest risk in the first
72h. Risk can be predicted using the ABCD2 scoring system (see Table 16.9).
Management of TIA
• Admit if >1 TIA in <1wk. Consider admission/specialist assessment in
<24h if the patient falls into a high/medium-risk group

Acute stroke

• If not admitting, once all symptoms have stopped, start aspirin
75mg od. Check blood for FBC, ESR, U&E, Cr, eGFR, lipids, and
glucose. Consider clotting screen ± thrombophilia screening if FH of
thrombosis. Check ECG and CXR
• Start treatment for risk factors, e.g. advise to stop smoking, start
antihypertensives if i BP, start statin and dipyridamole S/R 200mg bd
• Refer for urgent assessment (to be seen in <1wk) and further
investigation to a specialist service, e.g. TIA clinic. Specialist
investigations include: CT or MRI scan to confirm diagnosis, carotid
Dopplers if carotid artery territory symptoms; echocardiogram if
recent MI, CCF/LVF, or murmur
Amaurosis fugax Form of TIA due to emboli passing through the retina.
This causes brief loss of vision for a matter of minutes ‘like a curtain’.
Management is as for TIA.

Management after stroke
After stroke Stroke is a family illness. 40% carers suffer psychological distress starting <6wk after discharge. Involve carers/families. Provide
information/support. Address psychosocial issues and physical disability.
• Monitor and reassess frequently. Continue follow-up even when
specialist services have finished. Monitor s prevention measures. Refer
for more specialist rehabilitation if there is any deterioration in function
• Aids/appliances can help. Patients/carers may be entitled to benefits
• After stroke most patients are prescribed ≥1 drugs to d risk of further
stroke, but some have memory loss or problems opening containers.
Provide verbal and written information about medicines and help with
packaging, e.g. non-childproof tops
Screening for depression b p. 199
Secondary stroke prevention Patients with a history of stroke or
TIA/amaurosis fugax have a 30–43% risk of recurrent stroke within 5y.
Prevention focusses on ischaemic/embolic events which account for the
majority of strokes. Preventative strategies include:
Lifestyle advice
• Stopping smoking—b p. 182
• Regular exercise— b p. 180
• Diet and achieving a satisfactory weight—b pp. 174–9
• Reducing salt intake—d salt of 3g/d leads to d in stroke risk of 13%
• Avoiding alcohol excess—predisposes to both ischaemic and
haemorrhagic stroke through effects on BP—b pp. 184–7
Antiplatelet drugs Start patients not taking warfarin, who have had a
non-haemorrhagic stroke on CT/MRI on clopidogrel 75mg od long-termN
(aspirin 75mg od + dipyridamole S/R 200mg bd if intolerant). For patients
who have had a TIA start aspirin 75mg od + dipyridamole S/R 200mg bd
(dipyridamole M/R 200mg bd alone if intolerant to aspirin).
Oral anticoagulation For both p and s stroke prevention, anticoagulate
with warfarin or dabigatran if there are potential causes of cardiac thrombo­
embolism, e.g. rheumatic mitral valve disease; prosthetic heart valves;
dilated cardiomyopathy; and AF associated with valvular heart disease or
prosthesis. CHA2DS2-VASc score (see Table 16.10) is used to predict
stroke risk and need for anticoagulation for patients with non-valvular AF.
Hypertension management b p. 248
• Systolic and diastolic BP independently predict stroke. Risk escalates
with increasing BP. A 5–6mmHg d BP reduces risk by >30%
• After stroke (but not after TIA) defer treating hypertension until >2wk
after the event as i BP may be physiological response—lowering BP
decreases perfusion of the brain and may be harmful
Cholesterol
• Primary prevention A 22% d in cholesterol using a statin results in a
30%d in stroke in individuals with no past history of stroke/TIA. Treat
if patients meet criteria for coronary prevention (b p. 242)
• Secondary prevention Treat all patients with a history of CVD with
a statin regardless of baseline cholesterol. National Stroke Guidelines
suggest treatment with a statin, e.g. simvastatin 40mg od, if total
cholesterol is >3.5mmol/L unless contraindicated

Management after stroke

Carotid stenosis and carotid endarterectomy Carotid endarterectomy d mortality if carotid stenosis is symptomatic. Benefits d as
stenosis gets less—no evidence of benefit if <30% stenosis.
• Patients without history of stroke/TIA 2% annual risk of stroke so
surgery is controversial—in general risks outweigh benefits
• Patients with a history of stroke /TIA Consider referral for carotid
endarterectomy/carotid artery stenting if >70% carotid artery stenosis
and no severe disability

Parkinsonism and Parkinson’s disease
Parkinsonism Syndrome of:

• Tremor Coarse tremor, most marked at rest, ‘pill-rolling’
• Rigidity Limbs resist passive extension throughout movement—
lead-pipe rigidity—and juddering on passive extension of the forearm
or pronation/supination—cogwheel rigidity
• Difficulty in initiating movement
• Slowness of movement Mask-like or expressionless face, d blink rate,
d fidgeting, d peristalsis
• Abnormal gait Small steps—shuffling gait—and flexed posture as if
hurrying to keep up with feet—festinant gait
• Micrographia Small handwriting
Causes
• Parkinson’s disease (PD)
• Other neurodegenerative
diseases, e.g. Alzheimer’s
disease, multisystem atrophy
• Following encephalitis

• Drugs, e.g. haloperidol,
chlorpromazine, metoclopramide
• Toxins, e.g. CO poisoning
• Trauma
• Normal pressure hydrocephalus

Treatment of drug-induced parkinsonism If possible, stop the implicated
drug. If on an antipsychotic for schizophrenia do not stop treatment, but
add an antimuscarinic (e.g. procyclidine 2.5mg tds). Consider switching to
an atypical antipsychotic drug—take specialist advice.

Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome Parkinsonism accompanied by absent vertical gaze and dementia. Due to progressive supranuclear
palsy. J.C. Steele, J.C. Richardson, and J. Olszewski—Canadian neurologists.
Parkinson’s disease (PD) Incurable, progressive, degenerative disease affecting the dopaminergic neurones of the substantia nigra in the
brainstem, resulting in deficiency of dopamine and relative excess of
acetyl­choline transmitters. Cause: unknown. Lifetime risk: 1 in 40. 4 = 5.
Peak age at onset: 865y, but 5–10% patients are diagnosed when <40y old.
Prevalence i with age. J. Parkinson (1755–1824)—English physician.
Non-motor symptoms
• Neuropsychiatric—apathy, anxiety/depression, visual hallucinations,
psychosis, dementia, pain, olfactory disturbance
• Sleep—excessive daytime sleepiness, restless legs
• Autonomic—drooling, postural hypotension, hyperhidrosis, urinary
dysfunction, dysphagia, weightd, constipation, sexual dysfunction
Management Aims to:
• d symptoms and i quality of life
• d rate of disease progression
• Limit side effects of treatment
Screening for depression b p. 199
Referral Refer all patients to a specialist with an interest in Parkinson’s
disease for confirmation of diagnosis, advice on management, and to
access a multidisciplinary specialist rehabilitation team.

Parkinsonism and Parkinson’s disease

Rehabilitation Liaise closely with the specialist rehabilitation team.
• General principles b p. 204
• Specific issues b p. 582
Drug treatment (BNF 4.9) Rarely achieves complete control of symptoms;
5–10% respond poorly. Treatment for PD should be consultant-initiated
and is not started until symptoms cause significant disruption of daily
activities. Options:
Dopamine receptor agonists (e.g. bromocriptine, pergolide). Often used
alone as first-line treatment. i dose gradually, according to response and
tolerability. Withdraw gradually. Can also be used in association with
L-dopa to d off times and motor impairment.
• Bromocriptine, pergolide, cabergoline, and lisuride have been associated with pulmonary, retroperitoneal, and pericardial fibrosis.
• Check CXR ± spirometry, ESR, and creatinine before starting
• Monitor for dyspnoea, persistent cough, chest pain, cardiac failure,
abdominal pain, or tenderness
Levodopa (or L-dopa) Precursor of dopamine. i dopamine levels within
the substantia nigra. Start with low dose and i in small steps—aim to
keep final dose as low as possible and a compromise between i mobility
and dose-limiting side effects (involuntary movements, psychiatric effects).
Optimum dose interval varies between individuals.
• Only effective for PD. Not effective for patients with parkinsonism due
to other causes. Improves bradykinesia and rigidity > tremor
• Often given with a co-drug (carbidopa or benserazide) which prevents
peripheral breakdown of levodopa to dopamine but does not cross
the blood–brain barrier
• With time, there is d response and troublesome side effects appear:
• On-off effect—fluctuation between periods of exaggerated
involuntary movements and periods of immobility
• End-of-dose effect —duration of benefit after each dose reduces
• Abnormal involuntary movements i
Other drugs
• Monoamine oxidase B inhibition (e.g selegiline, rasagaline). Used in
severe PD in conjunction with levodopa to d end-of-dose effect. Early
use may postpone onset of treatment with levodopa
• Amantadine Improves bradykinesia, dyskinesias, tremor, and rigidity.
Introduce and withdraw slowly
• Inhibition of enzymatic breakdown of dopamine (e.g. entacapone,
tolcapone). For patients suffering from end-of-dose effect
Surgery A small proportion of carefully selected patients benefit from
‘deep brain stimulation’ (DBS).

Neurology

Multiple sclerosis
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disabling neurological disease due to
an autoimmune process of unknown cause. Characterized by formation of
patches of demyelination (‘plaques’) throughout the brain and spinal cord.
There is no peripheral nerve involvement.
It is the most common neurological disorder of young adults, with a lifetime risk of 1:1,000. Peak age of onset is 20–40y. 5:4 82:1. There is a
marked geographical variation—prevalence i with latitude.
Presentation Depends on the area of CNS affected. Take a careful ­history—although a patient usually presents with a single symptom,
history may reveal other episodes that have gone unheralded. Isolated
neurological deficits are never diagnostic. The hallmark of MS is a series
of neurological deficits distributed in time and space not attributable to
other causes. Predominant areas of demyelination are optic nerve, cervical
cord, and periventricular areas.
Common features
• Pain on eye movement
• Problems with speech
(optic neuritis)
(e.g. slurred or slow)
• Visual disturbance— d,
• Bladder problems (e.g. frequency,
blurring, or double vision
urgency, incontinence)
• d balance and coordination
• Constipation
• Sensory disturbance (e.g.
• Sexual dysfunction
numbness, tingling)
(e.g. impotence)
• Pain (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia)
• Cognitive changes (e.g. loss
• Fatigue
of concentration, memory
• Depression
problems)
• Transverse myelitis (b p. 572)
• Dysphagia
0 Symptoms may be worsened by heat or exercise.

Prognosis
• Benign MS (10%). Retrospective diagnosis. The patient has a few mild
attacks and then complete recovery. There is no deterioration over
time and no permanent disability
• Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 85% patients. Episodes of sudden i in
neurological symptoms or development of new neurological symptoms
with virtually complete recovery after 4–6wk. With time remissions
become less complete and residual disability accumulates
• Secondary progressive MS (SPMS) After 715y, 65% of patients with
relapsing-remitting disease begin a continuous downward progression
which may also include acute relapses
• Primary progressive MS (PPMS) 10% patients. Steady progression
from the outset with increasing disability
Management If suspected, refer to neurology for confirmation of diagnosis and support from the specialist neurological rehabilitation team.
Disease-modifying drugs d frequency and/or severity of relapses by
730% and slow course of the disease. Options are β-interferon (for
RRMS and SPMS), and glatiramer (for RRMS only). Prescription must be
consultant-led under the NHS risk-sharing scheme—Table 16.11.

neurological symptoms/signs refer to neurology immediately
• Fingolimod Is associated with macular oedema in 0.4%; routine
ophthalmological review is recommended 3–4mo after initiation
Acute relapses Treat episodes causing distressing symptoms or i limitation with high-dose steroids e.g. prednisolone 500mg–2g od po for 3–5d.

Neurology

Motor neurone disease and CJD
Motor neurone disease (MND) Is a degenerative disorder of
unknown cause affecting motor neurones in the spinal cord, brainstem,
and motor cortex. Prevalence in the UK 74.5/100,000 population 4:5 83:2.
Peak age of onset 860y. 10% have a FH. There is never any sensory loss.
Patterns of disease There are 3 recognized patterns of MND:
• Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (50%). Combined LMN wasting
and UMN hyperreflexia
• Progressive muscular atrophy (25%). Anterior horn cell lesions,
affecting distal before proximal muscles. Better prognosis than ALS
• Progressive bulbar palsy (25%). Loss of function of brainstem motor
nuclei (LMN lesions), resulting in weakness of the tongue, muscles of
chewing/swallowing, and facial muscles
Clinical picture Combination of progressive upper and/or lower motor
neurone signs, affecting >1 limb or a limb and the bulbar muscles. Symptoms
and signs:
• Fasciculation of skeletal muscles
• Stumbling (spastic gait,
• Fasciculation of the tongue
foot drop)
• Difficulty with speech
• Tiredness
(particularly slurring, hoarseness,
• Muscle wasting
or nasal or quiet speech)
• Weak grip
• Difficulty with swallowing
• Weakness of skeletal muscles
• Aspiration pneumonia
• Cramp
0 MND never affects eye movements (cranial nerves III, IV, VI)
Management Refer to neurology for exclusion of other causes of symptoms and confirmation of diagnosis. MND is incurable and progressive.
Death usually results from ventilatory failure 3–5y after diagnosis.
Drug therapy
• Riluzole (50mg bd) is the only drug treatment licensed in the UK
• Evidence suggests it extends life or time to mechanical ventilation for
patients with ALS. It may also slow functional declineN
• It should be initiated by a specialist with experience of MNDN
• Monitoring of liver function is essential—monthly for the first 3mo;
then 3-monthly for 9mo; then annually thereafter
Support
• Involve relevant agencies early, e.g. DN, social services, carer groups,
self-help groups
• Apply for all relevant benefits (b p. 222)
• Screen for depression (b p. 199)
• Discuss the future and patients’ wishes for the time when they become
incapacitated with patient and carer(s)
• Regular review to help overcome any new problems encountered is
helpful for patients and carers

Motor neurone disease and CJD

Symptom relief
• Spasticity—baclofen, tizanidine, botulinum toxin
• Drooling—propantheline 15–30mg tds po or amitriptyline 25–50mg tds
• Dysphagia—blend food, discuss NG tubes/PEG (b p. 583)
• Depression—common. Reassess support, consider drug treatment,
and/or counselling
• Joint pains—analgesia
• Respiratory failure—discuss tracheostomy/ventilation; weigh pros and
cons of prolongation of life versus prolongation of discomfort
• Palliative care b pp. 1028–47

Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) (human spongiform encephalo­

pathy). Fatal, degenerative brain disease due to a rogue form of brain
protein or ‘prion’. Types:
• Sporadic or classical Most common form in the UK (750 cases/y).
Rare <40y. Median duration of symptoms 3–4 mo. Cause: unknown
• Variant Affects younger people than classical CJD and duration is
longer, lasting a median of 14mo. Cause: transmitted by ingestion of
nervous tissue in beef infected with bovine spongiform encephalitis or
‘mad cow disease’. Compensation may be available to families
• Iatrogenic Cases associated with treatments using human growth
hormone and human dura mater grafts. Rarely associated with corneal
grafts or contaminated instruments used in surgery
• Familial prion disease 720–30 families in the UK are affected with a
version of CJD passed from generation to generation in an autosomal
dominant pattern. Median duration of symptoms from onset is 2–5y
Presentation Long incubation (>25y in some cases). Clinical features
vary according to the areas of brain most affected but are always rapidly
progressive. Common features: personality change; psychiatric symptoms;
cognitive impairment; neurological deficits (sensory and motor deficits,
ataxia); myoclonic jerks, chorea, or dystonia; difficulty with communication, mobility, swallowing, and continence; coma and death.
Differential diagnosis Dementia, depression, MS, MND, SOL.
Management There is no simple diagnostic test and often families
feel frustrated by early misdiagnosis. Refer to neurologist if suspected.
Treatment is supportive. Palliative care b pp. 1028–47

Spinal cord conditions
Spinal cord injury tends to affect young people, especially young men. It
is devastating, and the GP and primary care team are a vital part of the
ongoing support network. Causes: trauma (42% falls; 37% RTAs), herniated
disc, transverse myelitis, tumour, abscess.

Quadriplegia and tetraplegia Caused by spinal cord injury above
the first thoracic vertebra. Usually results in paralysis of all four limbs,
weakened breathing, and an inability to cough and clear the chest.
Paraplegia Occurs when the level of injury is below the first thoracic
nerve. Disability can vary from the impairment of leg movement to complete paralysis of the legs and abdomen up to the nipple line. Paraplegics
have full use of their arms and hands.
Incomplete spinal cord injuries
• Anterior cord syndrome Damage is towards the front of the
spinal cord, leaving the patient with loss or d ability to sense pain,
temperature, and touch sensations below the level of injury. Pressure
and joint sensation may be preserved
• Central cord syndrome Damage is in the centre of the spinal cord.
Typically results in loss of function in the arms, but preservation of
some leg movement ± some control of bladder/bowel function
• Posterior cord syndrome Damage is towards the back of the spinal
cord. Typically leaves patients with good muscle power, pain, and
temperature sensation, but difficulty coordinating limb movements
• Brown-Séquard syndrome Damage is limited to one side of the
spinal cord resulting in loss or d movement on the injured side but
preserved pain and temperature sensation, and normal movement on
the uninjured side but loss or d in pain and temperature sensation.
C.E. Brown-Séquard (1817–94)—French neurologist/physiologist

Cauda equina lesion The spinal cord ends at L1/L2 at which point a
bundle of nerves travels downwards through the lumbar and sacral vertebrae. Injury to these nerves causes partial or complete loss of movement
and sensation. There may be some recovery of function with time.
Transverse myelitis Inflammation of the spinal cord at a single level.

Symptoms develop rapidly over days/weeks and include limb weakness,
sensory disturbance, bowel and bladder disturbance, back pain, and
radicular pain. Recovery generally begins within 3mo but is not always
complete. Causes:
• MS
• Idiopathic (thought to be
• Malignancy
auto-immune mechanism)
• Vascular, e.g. thrombosis of
• Infection
spinal arteries, vasculitis s
• Vaccination
to heroin abuse, spinal A-V
• Autoimmune disease, e.g. SLE,
malformation
Sjögren’s syndrome, sarcoidosis
Management Depending on severity of symptoms, admit as an acute
medical emergency or refer for urgent neurological opinion.

Spinal cord conditions

Syringomyelia Tubular cavities (syrinxes) form close to the central
canal of the spinal cord. As the syrinx expands it compresses nerves within
the spinal cord. Most common in patients with previous spinal injury—
although may be years before. Typically presents with wasting and weakness of hands and arms, and loss of temperature and pain sensation over
trunk and arms (cape distribution). Refer to neurology.
General principles of rehabilitation b p. 204
Common neurological rehabilitation problems b p. 582
Specific problems associated with spinal cord injury
Autonomic dysreflexia (hyperreflexia) Reflex sympathetic overactivity,
causing flushing and i BP which may be severe. Only occurs in patients
with lesions above T5/6. Usually triggered by discomfort below the level
of the lesion. Presentation is with pounding headache, sweating, flushing,
or mottling above the level of the lesion.
Sit the patient up and remove any obvious cause, e.g. pain, bladder distension, constipation. Give GTN spray (1–2 puff sublingual) or nifedipine
5–10mg capsule broken sublingually. If not settling, admit to hospital.
Loss of temperature control Most people with complete spinal cord injuries do not sweat below the level of the injury and many quadriplegics
cannot sweat above the injury (even though they may sweat due to autonomic dysreflexia). With loss of ability to sweat or vasoconstrict, careful
control of environmental conditions is essential to avoid hypothermia or
overheating. In hot weather advise cooling with wet towels.
Infertility Many 4 patients suffer infertility due to:
• Failure of ejaculation
• Retrograde ejaculation
• Thermal damage due to sitting in a wheelchair l poor-quality sperm
• Chronic infection of prostate and seminal vesicles (common)
Refer for specialist advice.
Bowel/bladder function Both bladder and bowel function are reflex
actions that we learn to override as children. If the lesion is above the
level of this reflex pathway (T12 for bowel and T6 for bladder function)
then automatic emptying will still occur when the bladder or bowel is
full—though there is no control. If the lesion is below this level there is
no emptying reflex. Bladder/bowel care programmes reflect this. Useful
leaflets are available from the Spinal Injuries Association.

Neurology

Epilepsy
Epilepsy is a group of disorders in which fits or seizures occur as a result
of spontaneous abnormal electrical discharge in any part of the brain. They
take many forms but usually take the same pattern on each occasion for a
given individual. Prevalence 5–10/1,000. 5% of those >21y old having their
first fit have cerebral pathology (10% aged 45–55y).
Epilepsy in children b p. 898
Management of a fitting patient/status epilepticus b p. 1070
Management after first fit 60% of adults who have one fit will never
have another (90% if EEG is normal).
• Refer all patients with a first suspected seizure for urgent (within
2wk) assessment by a neurologist with training and expertise in epilepsy
to exclude underlying causes (e.g. tumour) and receive clear guidance
on medication, work, and driving N.

Classification of seizure types Is important, as these have implications for management and prognosis.
• Partial seizures The seizure is limited to one area of the brain only.
Termed ‘simple’ if no impairment of consciousness (previously called
focal or Jacksonian epilepsy) and ‘complex’ if consciousness is impaired
(previously called psychomotor or temporal lobe epilepsy). Partial
seizures may become generalized
• Generalized seizures Whole brain is involved. Consciousness is
usually but not always impaired. 6 major types: tonic-clonic (grand
mal); absence (petit mal); myoclonic; tonic; clonic; and atonic
0 Some people have seizures that cannot be classified in this way.
Todd’s palsy Focal CNS signs (e.g. hemiplegia) following an epileptic
seizure. The patient seems to have had a stroke but recovers in <24h.
Causes of epilepsy in adults A cause is found in more than two-thirds
of people with epilepsy. The most common causes are:
• Drugs, alcohol, and other
• Cerebrovascular disease
toxic causes
• Cerebral tumours
• Head trauma (including
• Genetic, congenital, or
surgery)
hereditary conditions
• Post-infective causes (e.g. meningitis, encephalitis)

Assessment See Table 16.12.
Screening for depression b p. 199
Long-term management of epilepsy b p. 576
Epilepsy and pregnancy b p. 829
Mortality Death rate is i x2–3. Deaths are related to underlying condi-

tion, accidents, SUDEP, or status epilepticus.

Sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (SUDEP) Probably due to central
respiratory arrest during a seizure. Minimize risk by optimizing seizure
control and being aware of potential consequences of night seizures.

Neurology

Management of epilepsy
Regular GP review, at least annually, is essential.

Education Epilepsy is a diagnosis causing alarm and fear. Find out how
much the patient (and family) understands about epilepsy. Acknowledge
distress at diagnosis and answer their questions. Provide information on:
• What to expect—fits are controlled with drugs in 80%
• What to do during an attack
• Driving (b p. 130) and work—stop driving, and notify DVLA and
motor insurance company. Inform employer. Do not work at heights
or with/near dangerous machinery
• Avoiding risks—avoid cycling in traffic; only swim if lifeguard present
• Importance of concordance with medication
• When drug withdrawal may be considered if fit-free
Leaflets are available from Epilepsy Action. Support groups can help.

Drug therapy BNF 4.8.1. NICE recommends drug treatment (see Table

16.13) after the second seizure, except in specific circumstances. Drug
choice is a specialist decision. 0 Patients on anticonvulsants are entitled
to free prescriptions throughout the UK.
Withdrawal of drug therapy Consider if fit-free for 2–3y. Decision
to stop must be the patient’s. Balance problems/inconvenience of drugtaking against risks of fits. Refer to neurology for supervision of drug withdrawal. If adult with grand mal epilepsy, 59% stay fit-free for 2y.
Seizure recurrence is more likely if generalized tonic-clonic seizures;
myoclonic epilepsy or infantile spasms; taking >1 drug for epilepsy; ≥1
seizure after starting treatment; duration of treatment >10y; fit-free <5y.
• Advise patients not to drive during withdrawal of epileptic medication or for 6mo afterwards.

Surgery Used for intractable partial seizures, hemiepilepsy, and epilepsy
with focal EEG and/or radiological features.
Vagus nerve stimulation d frequency of seizures for those refractory to anti-epileptic medication but not suitable for resective surgery.
Ketogenic diet Effective in some patients with refractory epilepsy—
take specialist advice.
At review Review the individual’s care plan. Record fits and precipitating causes; check drug concordance (frequency of repeat prescriptions)
and side effects; if fit-free >2y—discuss the possibility of withdrawing
medication, if appropriate. For women of reproductive age give contraception (b p. 756) and pre-conception advice (b p. 829).
Re-refer For review by a neurologist or epilepsy nurse specialist if:
•
•
•
•
•

Control is poor or drugs are causing unacceptable side effects
Seizures have continued despite medication for >2y or on two drugs
Pointers to a previously unsuspected cause for the fits appear
Concurrent illness (physical or psychiatric) complicates management
For pre-conceptual advice or to discuss withdrawal of medication

Table 16.13 Commonly used drugs in epilepsy. Stress the importance of concordance. Start at a low dose, and i dose until fits
are controlled or side effects occur. Use monotherapy wherever possible—two drugs i toxicity and side effects. Polytherapy offers
no advantage over monotherapy for 90% patients. Prescribe by brand name—generic prescribing may lead to changing of brand.
Changing brand carries 10% risk of worsening of seizure control.

Neurology

Muscle disorders
Symptoms Muscle weakness, fatigability. Pain at rest suggests inflammation—pain on exercise, ischaemia, or metabolic myopathy.

Signs Look for associated systemic disease.

• Myotonia—delayed muscular relaxation after contraction,
e.g. difficulty letting go after gripping something
• Local muscular tenderness or firm muscles—may be due to
infiltration of muscle with connective tissue or fat
• Fasciculation—spontaneous, irregular, and brief contractions of part
of a muscle; suggests LMN disease, e.g. MND
• Lumps—tumours are rare; lumps may be due to tendon rupture,
haematoma, or herniation of muscle through fascia
Muscular dystrophies Group of genetic disorders characterized by
progressive degeneration and weakness of some muscle groups.
Myotonic dystrophy (dystrophia myotonia) Autosomal dominant inheritance—abnormal DMPK gene on chromosome 19. Presents at any age.
Symptoms vary from mild to severe and may include:
• Muscle symptoms—weakness and myotonia, particularly involves face,
eyelids, jaw, neck, forearms/hands, lower legs/feet. Can affect speech
and result in a lack of facial expression
• Respiratory symptoms—weakness of respiratory muscles l poor
night-time sleep, daytime sleepiness, headaches, and difficulty waking;
aspiration l recurrent chest infections
• Eye symptoms—cataract (may be the only problem) and ptosis
• Reproductive problems—infertility as a result of atrophy of the testes
and problems in labour due to uterine muscle weakness
• Learning difficulty and behavioural problems
• Digestive symptoms—swallowing difficulty, abdominal pain,
constipation/diarrhoea, gallstones
• Cardiac arrhythmias—annual ECG is advisable
• Endocrine abnormalities, e.g. DM
• Anaesthetic problems—pre-warn anaesthetist/surgeon prior to surgery
Prognosis is variable depending on severity of symptoms. Refer to confirm
diagnosis and for advice on management/genetic counselling.
Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy Sex-linked recessive inheritance means almost always confined to boys. 30% of cases are
due to spontaneous mutation. Investigation shows markedly i
CK (>40x normal). Presents typically at 74y with progressively
clumsy walking. Few survive to >20y old. Refer for confirmation of diagnosis and ongoing specialist support. Genetic counselling is important.

Muscle disorders

Toxic myopathies Certain drugs can cause myopathy including:

• Alcohol
• Ciclosporin
• Steroids
• Labetalol
• Cocaine
• Chloroquine
• Cholesterol-lowering
• Heroin
• Zidovudine
drugs (including statins)
• PCP
• Vincristine
Management Stop the implicated drug immediately. If symptoms do not
resolve, refer for confirmation of diagnosis and management advice.
Acquired myopathy of late onset Often a manifestation of systemic disease, e.g. thyroid disease (especially hyperthyroidism), carcinoma,
Cushing’s disease. Investigate to find the cause. Treat the cause if found
else refer for further investigation.
Polymyositis Insidious, symmetrical, proximal muscle weakness due
to muscle inflammation. Dysphagia, dysphonia, and/or respiratory muscle
weakness may follow. 25% have a purple rash on cheeks, eyelids, and other
sun-exposed areas (dermatomyositis) ± nail fold erythema. CK levels are i.
Associated with malignancy in 10% of patients >40y. Refer.

PoliomyelitisND
Acute polio Spread: droplet or faecal-oral. Incubation: 7d. Presents with
2d flu-like prodrome then fever, tachycardia, headache, vomiting, stiff
neck, and unilateral tremor (‘pre-paralytic stage’). 65% who experience
the pre-paralytic stage go on to develop paralysis (myalgia, LMN signs ±
respiratory failure). Management: supportive—admit to hospital. <10% of
those developing paralysis die. Permanent disability may result.
Prevention
• 1º immunization in babies and children <10y 3 doses of the 5-part
vaccine (DTaP/IPV/Hib), protecting against polio, diphtheria, whooping
cough, tetanus, and Haemophilus influenzae, each 1mo apart—usually
at 2mo, 3mo, and 4mo. If schedule is disrupted resume where stopped
• Booster doses in children 1 dose of 4-part vaccine (DTaP/IPV), protecting
against polio, diphtheria, whooping cough, and tetanus >3y after the 1o
course (usually pre-school), and another dose of 3-part vaccine (Td/IPV)
against tetanus, diphtheria, and polio, 10y later (age 13–18y)
• 1º immunization in children >10y and adults Three doses of 3-part
vaccine (Td/IPV), each 1mo apart. Give booster doses after 3y and 10y
• Booster doses for travel Not required unless at special risk, e.g.
travelling to endemic/epidemic area or healthcare workers. Boosters
of Td/IPV are then given every 10y
Late effects of polio 20–30y after initial infection some patients develop
new symptoms often triggered by a period of immobilization:
• i muscle weakness and fatigue
• Pain in muscles and joints
• Respiratory difficulties (particularly in those who spent some time in
an iron lung ventilator)—may present with symptoms relating to sleep
Once other causes are excluded, treatment is supportive.

Neurology

Other neurological syndromes
von Recklinghausen’s disease (type 1 neurofibromatosis; NF1)

Autosomal dominant trait. Criteria for diagnosis: ≥2 of:
• ≥6 café-au-lait patches (flat, coffee-coloured patches of skin seen
in first year of life, increasing in number and size with age) >5mm
(pre-pubertal) or >15mm (post-pubertal)
• ≥2 neurofibromas:
• Dermal neurofibromas—small violaceous skin nodules which
appear after puberty
• Nodular neurofibromas—subcutaneous, firm nodules arising from
nerve trunks (may cause paraesthesiae if compressed) or a plexiform
neurofibroma which appears as a large subcutaneous swelling
• Freckling in axilla, groin, neck base, and submammary area (women).
Present by age 10y
• ≥2 Lisch nodules—nodules of the iris only visible with a slit lamp
• Distinctive bony abnormality specific to NF1, e.g. sphenoid dysplasia
• First-degree relative with NF1
Management Ongoing specialist management is essential.
Complications Affect 1 in 3 patients:
• Pseudoarthrosis
• Mild learning disability
• i BP (6%)—due to renal artery
• Short stature
stenosis or phaeochromocytoma
• Macrocephaly
• Malignancy (5%)—optic glioma
• Nerve root compression
or sarcomatous change of
• GI bleeding or obstruction
neurofibroma
• Cystic bone lesion
• Epilepsy (slight i)
• Scoliosis
F.D. von Recklinghausen (1833–1910)—German pathologist.

Type 2 neurofibromatosis (NF2) Much rarer than type 1. Auto­

somal dominant inheritance.

Diagnosis One of:
• Bilateral vestibular schwannoma (acoustic neuroma—sensorineural
hearing loss, vertigo ± tinnitus)
• First-degree relative with NF2 and either a unilateral vestibular
schwannoma or ≥1 neurofibroma, meningioma, glioma, schwannoma,
or juvenile cataract
Management Screen at-risk patients with annual hearing tests. Once diagnosis is made, specialist neurosurgical management is needed.
Complications Schwannomas of other cranial nerves, dorsal nerve roots,
or peripheral nerves; meningioma (45%); other gliomas (less common).

Ekbom’s syndrome (restless legs syndrome) The patient (who

is usually in bed) is seized by an irresistible desire to move his/her legs in
a repetitive way accompanied by an unpleasant sensation deep in the legs.
Sleep disturbance is common, as is +ve FH. Cause: unknown.

Other neurological syndromes

Management
• Exclude drug causes—common culprits: β-blockers, H2 antagonists,
neuroleptics, lithium, TCAs, anticonvulsants
• Exclude peripheral neuropathy or ischaemic rest pain
• Iron deficiency (with or without anaemia) is associated in 1 in 3
sufferers so check FBC and serum ferritin
• Also check: U&E, Cr, eGFR, fasting blood glucose, and TFTs
• Try non-drug measures first—reassurance, information, walking/
stretching, warmth, relaxation exercises, massage
• Drugs—dopamine agonists are often effective, e.g. ropinirole,
pramipexole
• Refer if severe symptoms or diagnosis is in doubt

Wernicke’s encephalopathy Thiamine deficiency causing nystag-

mus, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia. Other eye signs, e.g. ptosis, abnormal
pupillary reactions, and altered consciousness or confusion may also
occur. Consider in any patient with symptoms and a history of alcoholism.

Management Refer for confirmation of diagnosis. Meanwhile start thiamine
200–300mg od po to prevent irreversible Korsakoff’s syndrome. In severe
cases admit as a medical emergency. K. Wernicke (1848–1904)—German
psychiatrist.

Korsakoff’s syndrome d ability to acquire new memories. May follow Wernicke’s encephalopathy and is due to thiamine deficiency.
Confabulation to fill gaps in memory is a feature. Refer for specialist advice
on management. S.S. Korsakoff (1853–1900)—Russian neuropsychiatrist.

Gilles de la Tourette syndrome b p. 911
Huntington’s disease (chorea) Autosomal dominant trait. Testing
can identify affected individuals before symptoms occur. Pre-conceptual
and antenatal testing is available and should be offered to any couple
with a family history on either the mother’s or the father’s side. Presents
with movement abnormalities (e.g. hemichorea and rigidity) and dementia. Memory is relatively spared compared to cognition. Refer for expert
advice. G. Huntington (1851–1916)—US physician.
Friedreich’s ataxia The most common inherited ataxia (autosomal
recessive). Prevalence—1:50,000. Presents in adolescence with progressive gait and limb ataxia, loss of proprioception, pyramidal weakness, and
dys­arthria. Extra-neurological involvement includes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (most patients) and DM (10%). Treatment is supportive. Most
patients become chairbound with in 15y and die in the 4th or 5th decade from cardiac or pulmonary complications. N. Friedreich (1825–82)—

Neurological rehabilitation problems
New symptoms or limitations Consider:
• Is it due to an unrelated disease (e.g. change in bowel habit in
someone who has had a stroke might indicate bowel cancer)?
• Is it due to an incidental infection (e.g. UTI, chest infection)?
• Is it due to a relapse (e.g. acute relapse in MS, TIA or further stroke
in a stroke patient)?
• Is it due to a side effect of treatment (e.g. acute confusion,
involuntary movements or the on-off effect in a patient with PD)?
• Is it part of a gradual progression (e.g. in MS, MND, brain tumour)?
Treat any cause of deterioration identified. If no cause is found, consider
re-referring for specialist review and/or referring to the multidisciplinary
rehabilitation team involved with the patient.
General principles of rehabilitation b p. 204
Fatigue Consider and treat factors that might be responsible:
• Depression
• Disturbed sleep
• Chronic pain
• Poor nutrition
Action Review support, diet, and medication; encourage graded aerobic
exercise; consider a trial of amantadine 200mg/d to improve symptomsN.
Depression and anxiety Common. Diagnosis can be difficult. Standardized
questionnaires, e.g. PHQ-9 (b p. 1001), are helpful for screening.
Action Give opportunities to talk about the impact of the illness on lifestyle. Jointly identify areas where positive changes could be made, e.g.
referral to day care to widen social contact. Consider referral for counselling or to a self-help/support group. Consider antidepressant medication
and/or referral to psychiatric services.

Emotionalism If the patient cries (or laughs) with minimal provocation,
consider emotionalism—impairment in the control of crying. Reassure.
Sexual and personal relationships Problems are common. Useful
information sheets are available at M www.outsiders.org.uk
Communication problems Speech therapy assessment is vital.
Consider support via dysphasia groups and communication aids, e.g. simple pointing board (take advice from speech therapy and OT).
Poor vision Refer to an optician in the first instance. If corrected vision
is still poor refer for ophthalmology review.
Respiratory infections Common. Treat with antibiotics unless in terminal stages of disease. Advise pneumococcal and influenza vaccination.
Venous thromboembolism Common but clinically apparent in <5%.

Ensure adequate hydration and encourage mobility. Consider use of aspirin 75–150mg od and compression stockings if immobile. Prophylactic anticoagulation does not improve outcome.

Neurological rehabilitation problems

Motor impairment Aim to maintain physical independence:

• Involve physiotherapy—often only 2–3 visits are needed
• Involve OT—a task-oriented approach is used (e.g. learning how
to dress). Can also supply/advise on aids and appliances, e.g. Velcro
fasteners, wheelchairs, adapted cutlery, etc
• Refer for social services OT assessment if aids, equipment, or
adaptations are needed for the home
• Refer for home care services as necessary
• Give information about driving (b pp. 128–31) and/or employment
where appropriate

Spasticity ± muscle and joint contractures Treat with physiotherapy (usually involving exercise ± splinting) ± drugs. Anti-spasticity
drugs include dantrolene (25mg od), baclofen (5mg tds or rarely through
a pump), and tizanidine (2mg od). Botulinum toxin can be directed at
specific muscles. Refer via the specialist rehabilitation team.

Pain Most pain arises from d mobility. Other causes include: pre-morbid
disease (e.g. osteoarthritis); central pain due to neurological damage; and
neuropathic pain.
Action Chronic pain, especially central pain, may respond to TCAs.
Peripheral pain may respond to simple analgesia ± physiotherapy. Other
options are TENS and local joint injection. A cannabinoid is now available
as an oromucosal spray (Sativex®) for relief of pain/muscle spasm in MS on
specialist prescription only. Refer patients with intractable pain to specialist
pain clinics.

Bladder problems
• UTI If suspected, check urine dipstick ± send MSU for M,C&S and
start antibiotics. If >3 proven UTIs in 1y refer to specialist incontinence
service or urology for further assessment
• Incontinence b pp. 450–3
• Nocturia Desmopressin 100–400 micrograms po or 10–40 micrograms
intranasally may be helpful
• Urgency Modify environment, e.g. provide commode; try
anticholinergic, e.g. tolterodine 2mg bd or oxybutinin 5mg tds. If not
settling refer for specialist assessment

Bowel problems
• Dysphagia Common. Fluids are more difficult to swallow than
semisolids. Formal assessment by trained staff is essential. Feeding
through NG tube or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) may
be needed long- or short-term—in terminal disease (e.g. MND), weigh
provision of nutrition against prolongation of poor-quality life
• Constipation Difficulty with defecation or BO <2x/wk—i fluid intake
and i fibre in diet. If no improvement, use po laxative ± regular
suppositories/enemas
• Incontinence Exclude overflow due to constipation

Skin breakdown Prevented by: positioning; mobilization; good skin
care; management of incontinence; pressure-relieving aids (e.g. special
mattresses/cushions). Involve community nursing services.

Neurology

Neurological assessment scales
A number of neurological assessment scales are in common use. Agreeing
to use a formal, validated assessment scale enables comparison of observations between different team members, and also allows comparison of
observations over time. Commonly used scales include:

Glasgow Coma Scale Assesses level of consciousness—b p. 1068
Motor scoring scale Assesses muscle power

•
•
•
•
•
•

0—no muscle movement
1—muscle flicker but no movement
2—moves but not against gravity
3—supports limb against gravity but not resistance
4—able to overcome mild resistance (mild weakness)
5—able to overcome strong resistance (normal power)

Disability severity scales Assess the impact of a particular condition on the individual. These scales are usually condition specific, e.g. the
Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS)—see Box 16.1, or Seizure
Severity Questionnaire for patients with epilepsy. These scales are useful
to gauge severity of symptoms and also monitor response to any treatments provided.
Daily living scales A number of scales are available that measure what
the individual can do in practice. These may be:
• Non-disease specific e.g. Barthel Index, or
• Disease specific e.g. Oxford Stroke Handicap Scale

It is not really important which scale is used as long as everyone in the
team uses the same scale for any given patient. Most use a graded Likert
scale (e.g. 0–5) and rate activities such as:
• Mobility—walking, stairs, ability to transfer
• Personal care—dressing, washing
• Feeding—ability to prepare food, ability to feed self
• Toileting—ability to use the toilet, continence (bowels and bladder)

Quality of life scales Neurological conditions can have a profound

impact on quality of life. Scales used to assess impact on quality of life
may be completed by the patients themselves, or by the attending health
professional. Examples include:
• Non-disease specific scales e.g, Euroqol EQ-5D
• Disease specific scales, e.g. Quality of Life in Essential Tremor
(QUEST); Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QUOLIE)

Cognitive function tests e.g. The General Practitioner Assessment of
Cognition (GPCOG), or 6 Cognitive Impairment Test (6CIT—b p. 1011).
Mental health scales, e.g.
• Anxiety—GAD-2 (b p. 993)
• Depression—NICE Chronic disease depression screening questions
(b p.199); PHQ-9 (b p. 1001)

Skin assessment
History Use open questions at the start becoming directive when necessary—clarify, reflect, facilitate, listen. Ask about:
Age and gender Gives clues to likely diagnosis (see Table 17.1).
Presenting complaint Chronological account—when, where, and how the
problem started. Ask directly about:
• Skin lesions What did the initial lesions look like? How have they
evolved and extended?
• Associated symptoms Itching (b p. 594)? Sweating (b p. 603)?
Systemic symptoms?
• Aggravating or relieving factors, e.g. sunlight
• Past medical history Similar symptoms, atopy, systemic disease, e.g.
rheumatoid arthritis, coeliac disease
• Family history Genetic skin problems, e.g. neurofibromatosis; other
family members with similar symptoms, e.g. scabies
• Drug history New drugs (including OTC), immunosuppressants, drug
allergies
• Occupation/hobbies Does the problem improve when away from
work/hobbies? Could the problem have been caused as a result of
work/hobbies?
• Previous treatments tried and result
Attitudes and beliefs How does the patient see the problem? What does
he/she think is wrong? How does he/she think other people view the situation? What does the patient want you to do about it?
Examination Use a systematic approach to the skin lesions:
Distribution See Figure 17.1.
Individual lesion morphology A magnifying hand lens is often helpful in
looking at individual lesions. Palpation is also important to determine consistency, depth, and texture. Skin lesions—b p. 592.
• Are lesions monomorphic (take one form—e.g. guttate psoriasis) or
pleomorphic (take many forms—e.g. chickenpox)?
• Are there s changes on top of primary lesions, e.g. excoriations?
• How are lesions grouped locally, i.e. ring-shaped, linear, Koebner
phenomenon?
Check hair, nails, and mucous membranes Hair problems—b p. 602;
nail changes—b p. 604.
Consider general examination If examination of the skin suggests
systemic cause.

Action
• Summarize the history back to the patient and give an opportunity for
the patient to fill in any gaps
• Draw up a problem list and outline a management plan with the patient.
Further investigations and interventions are guided by the findings on
history and examination—so a good history and examination is essential
• Set a review date

Skin assessment

• Localized or generalized?
• Symmetrical? If so, are the lesions peripheral
(e.g. lichen planus) or
central
(e.g. pityriasis versicolor)?
• Do skin lesions involve the flexures
(e.g. eczema) or extensor
surfaces
(e.g. psoriasis)
• Are lesions limited to sun-exposed areas? b p. 624
• Are lesions linear or ring-shaped? b p. 592
• Is the distribution dermatomal e.g. shingles?
• Does the problem affect only one region e.g. axilla, face, groin, foot?

Dermatology

Treatment of skin conditions
Skin conditions are usually treated with topical creams and lotions.
Consider the vehicle as well as the active ingredient. In primary care, the
choice is usually between creams or ointments.
• Creams Emulsions of oil and water. Well absorbed into the skin, less
greasy, and easier to apply than ointments
• Ointments Greasy preparations suitable for chronic, dry lesions
Other alternatives include applications, gels, lotions, and pastes.
Emollients (see BNF 13.2.1; e.g. white soft paraffin). Useful for all dry
or scaling disorders to soothe, smooth, and hydrate the skin—apply in the
direction of hair growth. Effects are short-lived—advise frequent application,
even after improvement occurs. Quantities to prescribe—see Table 17.2.
• Severity of the condition, patient preference, and site of application
guide choice of emollient. Some ingredients rarely cause sensitization
(see Box 17.1)—suspect if an eczematous reaction occurs
• Preparations such as aqueous cream and emulsifying ointment can be
used as soap substitutes for hand washing and in the bath. Addition of
an emollient bath oil e.g. Oilatum® or Balneum®, may also be helpful
• Avoid preparations containing an antibacterial (e.g. Dermol®), unless
infection is present or a frequent complication
• Using a preparation with added urea (e.g. Balneum Plus®, Eucerin®)
may improve hydration for scaling conditions or in elderly patients
Topical corticosteroids (see BNF 13.4)
• Used to suppress inflammatory conditions of the skin, e.g. eczema,
when other measures such as emollients are ineffective used alone.
Use the least potent preparation that is effective (see Table 17.3).
Apply a thin layer just to affected areas >30min prior to emollients
once or twice daily. Quantities to prescribe—see Table 17.2
• Creams are suitable for moist or weeping lesions, and ointments for
dry, lichenified, or scaly lesions or where a more occlusive effect is
wanted. Lotions may be useful when minimal application to a large or
hair-bearing area is needed or for the treatment of exudative lesions
• Inclusion of urea or salicylic acid i penetration of the corticosteroid
Cautions and contraindications Topical steroids:
• Are of no value in the treatment of urticaria
• Are contraindicated for rosacea and not recommended for acne
•	May worsen ulcerated or secondarily infected lesions
• Should not be used indiscriminately for pruritus—they will only be of
benefit if inflammation is causing the itch
• Should not be used long-term (>7–14d) on the face (and keep away
from eyes) or for children. Use potent or very potent corticosteroids
on the face only under specialist supervision
0 For perioral inflammatory lesions use hydrocortisone 1% for ≤7d or, if
infected (e.g. angular cheilitis), hydrocortisone + miconazole cream.
• Potent topical or systemic steroids used to treat patients with
­psoriasis can result in rebound relapse, development of generalized
­pustular psoriasis, and/or local and systemic toxicity.

Spider naevi Small red lesions (barely visible—0.5cm diameter) in

superior vena cava distribution, i.e. on the arms, neck, and chest wall.
Large arteriole with numerous small vessels radiating from it giving the
appearance of a spider—hence the name. Pressure applied to the central
arteriole (e.g. with a pointed object) causes blanching of the whole lesion.
>2 spider naevi is abnormal. Causes:
• Cirrhosis—most frequently, alcoholic

Dermatology

Itching and blistering of the skin
Itching In any patient presenting with pruritus or itch, ask: Are there
skin lesions present?
Skin lesions present Search for unexcoriated lesions. Investigations are
not usually needed. Exceptions are patch testing for contact dermatitis and
skin biopsy for dermatitis herpetiformis. Causes:
• Infections—viral, e.g.
• Urticaria
chickenpox; fungal
• Contact dermatitis and allergies
• Dermatitis herpetiformis
to food and drugs
• Lichen planus
• Prickly heat
• Senile atrophy
• Skin infestations, e.g. scabies,
• Psychological causes*
pediculosis, insect bites
* excessive excoriation causes lichenification of the skin.

Skin lesions absent Large differential diagnosis. Look for pallor, jaundice,
weight d, LN enlargement, and abdominal organomegaly. Investigate as
necessary—consider urinalysis (dipstick and MSU), FBC, ESR/CRP, serum
ferritin, LFTs (including alkaline phosphatase), U&E, Cr and eGFR, glucose,
serum Ca2+, TFTs, and CXR. If still undiagnosed—refer. Causes:
• Hepatic—obstructive jaundice, pregnancy
• Endocrine—DM, thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism, hyperparathyroidism
•	Renal—chronic renal failure
• Haematological—polycythaemia vera, iron deficiency, leukaemia,
Hodgkin’s disease
•	Malignancy—any carcinoma
• Drug allergies
• Psychological—obsessive states, schizophrenia
•	Rare causes—diabetes insipidus, roundworm infection

Blisters Result from separation of skin layers. Type of blister depends
on level of cleavage of the skin—subcorneal or intraepidermal blisters
rupture easily, subepidermal blisters are much tougher. Causes:
• Subcorneal Pustular psoriasis (b p. 619), bullous impetigo (b p. 632)
• Intraepidermal Eczema (b pp. 606–11), HSV (b p. 634), VZ—
chickenpox (b p. 652) or shingles (b p. 653), pemphigus, friction
• Subepidermal Cold or heat injury (burns—b p. 1114), pemphigoid,
dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease
• Other Insect bites (may cause cleavage at any level)

PemphigoidG Autoimmune disorder.
• Bullous pemphigoid Usually affects the elderly. An urticarial reaction
may precede onset of blistering. Large, tense blisters arise on red or
normal skin on the limbs, trunk, and flexures. Oral lesions in 20–30%.
May be localized to one site, e.g. lower leg. Differential diagnosis:
pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, linear IgA disease
• Cicatricial pemphigoid Mainly affects mucous membranes in the eyes/
mouth. Scarring results in visual loss. Refer to ophthalmology
• Pemphigoid gestationis Rare but characteristic bullous eruption
associated with pregnancy. Remits after delivery but often recurs in
subsequent pregnancies. b p. 805

Itching and blistering of the skin

Management Refer to dermatology for skin biopsy and confirmation of
diagnosis. Treatment is usually with oral steroids (prednisolone 30–60mg
daily initially—reducing as symptoms improve). Other treatments include
antibiotics and nicotinamide, azathioprine, or other immunosuppressants.
Prognosis Self-limiting in 50%—steroids are often stopped after 72y.

PemphigusG Uncommon, autoimmune disorder affecting skin and
mucous membranes. Affects adults (peak incidence 30–70y). Cause: 90%
have detectable circulating autoantibodies. Associated with other auto­
immune disorders, e.g. myasthenia gravis.
Presentation 50% present with oral lesions. Suspect in anyone presenting
with mucocutaneous erosions/blisters. Flaccid superficial blisters then
appear—sometimes months later—over scalp, face, back, chest, and
flexures. As blisters are fragile they burst early and the condition may
present as crusted erosions. Untreated the condition is progressive.
Management Refer to dermatology. Treatment is with high-dose systemic
steroids or other immunosuppressive agents. Treatment is continued
long-term although occasional remissions occur. Before treatment with
steroids 75% of patients died in <4y. Now excess morbidity and mortality
is due to side effects of treatment.

Dermatitis herpetiformis 4 > 5 (2:1). Peak incidence: third/fourth
decade. Consists of itchy vesicular skin rash on elbows (extensor surface), knees, buttocks, and scalp, which are often broken by scratching to
leave excoriations. Closely related to coeliac disease (b p. 412); 2–5%
of patients with coeliac disease have dermatitis herpetiformis but classic
symptoms of coeliac disease are uncommon. Differential diagnosis: scabies,
eczema, linear IgA disease.
Management Refer to dermatology for skin biopsy to confirm diagnosis.
Responds to withdrawal of gluten—although may take up to 1y. Controlled
in the interim with dapsone or sulfapyridine.

Epidermolysis bullosa A group of genetically inherited diseases char-

acterized by blistering on minimal trauma. Range from being mild and trivial
to being incompatible with life. The most common form is simple epidermolysis bullosa (autosomal dominant)—blistering is caused by friction, is
mild and limited to hands and feet. Patients are advised to avoid trauma.

Linear IgA disease Rare condition of blisters and urticarial lesions on
the back and extensor surfaces. Refer to dermatology. Responds to dapsone.

Erythema
Erythema is redness of the skin—usually due to vasodilatation. It may be
localized (e.g. pregnancy—on the palms), generalized (e.g. flushing) or
take the form of a red rash (e.g. drug eruption, viral exanthem).
• Erythroderma (exfoliative dermatitis) Erythema affecting
>90% skin surface. Rare, but systemic effects of skin failure are potentially fatal. 4:5 82:1. Typical patient is middle-aged or elderly. Patchy
erythema becomes universal in <48h. Accompanied by fever, shivering,
and malaise. 2–6d later scaling appears. The skin is hot, red, itchy, dry,
thickened, and feels tight. There may be oedema/oozing. Hair and nails
may be shed. Admit as an acute medical emergency.
Causes Eczema (40%); psoriasis (25%); lymphoma (15%); drug eruption
(10%); other skin disease (2%); unknown (8%).

Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome b p. 903
Erysipelas and cellulitis b p. 632
Flushing Generalized erythema due to vasodilatation. Common and

usually benign. Tends to affect face, neck, and upper trunk. Cause:
• Physiological, e.g. exertion, heat
• Emotion, e.g. anger, anxiety, embarrassment
• Foods, e.g. spices, chillies, alcohol
• Endocrine, e.g. menopause, Cushing’s syndrome
• Drugs, e.g. opioids, tamoxifen, danazol, GnRH analogues, clomifene,
nitrates, calcium channel blockers
• Dermatological Rosacea (unknown mechanism); contact dermatitis
• Inflammatory SLE; dermatomyositis
• Infection, e.g. slapped cheek syndrome (Fifth disease); cellulitis/erysipelas
• Tumour Pancreatic tumours, medullary thyroid cancer, carcinoid,
phaeochromocytoma

Management Treat cause if possible (e.g. avoid alcohol, HRT). Embarrassing
flushing may be helped with propranolol (e.g. 40mg od/bd) or clonidine (e.g.
50 micrograms bd). If severe and disabling and no response to conservative
measures, consider referral to dermatology.

Palmar erythema Generalized reddening of the palms associated with
pregnancy, liver disease, and polycythaemia.
Erythema nodosum Tender erythematous nodules 1–5cm diameter on
extensor surfaces of limbs—especially shins (see Figure 17.2) ± ankle and
wrist arthritis ± fever. 5:4 83:1. Resolves in <8wk, non-scarring. No treatment needed although analgesia and mild compression may ease symptoms.
Associations 0 20% of cases are idiopathic with no associations.
• Inflammatory bowel disease—
• Streptococcal infection
UC, Crohn’s
• Drugs, e.g. oral contraceptives,
•	Malignancy
sulfonamides
• TB
• Acute sarcoidosis

Erythema multiforme Immune-mediated disease characterized by
target lesions on hands and feet (see Figure 17.3). Causes:
• Idiopathic (50%)
• Infective Streptococcal, HSV, hepatitis B, mycoplasma
• Drugs Penicillin, sulfonamide, barbiturate
• Other SLE, pregnancy, malignancy
Presentation Target lesions (red rings with central pale or purple area) on
hands and feet. New lesions appear for 2–3wk. Frequently oral, conjunctival,
and genital mucosa is affected—if severe termed Stevens–Johnson syndrome.
Differential diagnosis Toxic erythema, toxic epidermal necrolysis, Sweet’s
disease, urticaria, pemphigoid.
Management Identification and removal of the underlying cause. Mild
cases resolve spontaneously and require symptomatic measures only.
Admit if extensive involvement.

Presentation Earliest symptom is flushing. Erythema, telangiectasia,
papules, pustules ± lymphoedema affect cheeks, nose, forehead, and chin
(see Figure 17.4a). Exacerbated by sunlight and topical steroids.
Aggravating factors Sun exposure (61%); emotional stress (60%); hot
weather (53%); alcohol (45%); spicy foods (43%); exercise (39%); cold
weather or wind (38/36%); hot baths (37%); hot drinks (36%); cosmetics/
skin care products (24%).
Complications Rhinophyma (bulbous appearance of nose—see
Figure 17.4b); eye involvement—blepharitis, dry eye, and conjunctivitis.
Differential diagnosis Acne (lacks comedones and older age group);
contact dermatitis, SLE, photosensitive eruptions; seborrhoeic dermatitis.
Management
• Avoid triggers
• Antibiotics—repeated treatment is usually needed over many
years with prolonged courses of topical or systemic antibiotics (e.g.
metronidazole 0.75% gel bd or 15% topical azelaic acid bd for 3–4mo;
or lymecycline 408mg od or tetracycline 500mg bd, decreasing to
250mg od after 3wk and continuing for 4mo). Rebound may occur if
antibiotics are stopped suddenly
•	Refer to dermatology if rhinophyma, ocular complications, or failure to
respond to treatment in general practice

Livedo reticularis Marbled, patterned cyanosis of the skin. If not
reversible by warming investigate and treat the cause. Causes: physiological (e.g. cold); vasculitis (e.g. SLE); hyperviscosity.
Chilblains Inflamed and painful purple pink swellings on fingers, toes, or
ears. Appear in response to cold. 5 > 4. Advise warm housing/clothing,
gloves, and woolly socks. In severe cases oral nifedipine may help.

Erythema

Erythema ab igne Reticulate pigmented erythema due to

heat-induced damage. Common in the elderly—especially from
sitting in front of the fire or using hot water bottles to alleviate
pain. In younger patients may be caused by laptop computers
balanced on thighs. Explain the cause. Resolves spontaneously.

Viral rash Common, particularly in children. Appears suddenly (over

hours) and is associated with symptoms of the underlying viral infection. The
rash may take many forms but is usually widespread, red, maculopapular
and blanches on pressure. In most cases, the underlying virus cannot be
identified, but viral infections with characteristic rashes include:
• Fifth disease (slapped cheek) b p. 652
• Chickenpox b p. 652
•	Roseola infantum b p. 652
•	Measles b p. 652
• Hand, foot, and mouth b p. 652
•	Rubella b p. 652
Management In all cases, no specific treatment is needed for the rash—
treat the underlying viral infection symptomatically.
Rash illness in pregnancy b p. 804

Lyme disease Cause: Borrelia burgdorferi. Spread: transmitted by ticks—
usually from deer or sheep. Presents with:
• Erythema migrans (75%—see Figure 17.5)—a red macule/papule on
the upper arm, leg, or trunk 7–10d after a tick bite, which expands
over days/weeks to form a ring with central clearing; diameter can be
up to 50cm; further smaller lesions then develop elsewhere
• Flu-like illness
• Lymphadenopathy ± splenomegaly
• Arthralgia

Symptoms are typically intermittent and changing. Complications include
neurological abnormalities, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, and arthritis.
Management Confirm diagnosis with serology. Treatment is usually with
2–3wk course of doxycycline—take microbiology advice. X Treatment
with antibiotics after a tick bite but before symptoms have arisen is
controversial.

Dermatology

Pigmentation disorders
Hypopigmentation Lack of skin pigmentation. May be:
• Generalized Albinism; phenylketonuria; hypopituitarism
• Patchy Vitiligo; tuberous sclerosis; morphoea; pityriasis alba; or after
inflammation (e.g. post-cryotherapy, s to eczema or psoriasis),
infection (e.g. pityriasis versicolor), or exposure to chemicals
(substituted phenols, hydroquinone)
• Around a mole—halo naevus
Hyperpigmentation Excess skin pigmentation. May be:
• Genetic Racial; freckles; neurofibromatosis; Peutz–Jegher’s syndrome
• Due to drugs Amiodarone (blue-grey pigmentation of sun-exposed
areas); psoralens; minocycline (blue-black pigmentation in scars and
buccal mucosa); chloroquine (blue-grey pigmentation of face and
arms); chlorpromazine (grey pigment in sun-exposed sites); cytotoxics
• Endocrine Addison’s disease; chloasma; Cushing’s syndrome
• Nutritional Ingestion of carrots (carotinaemia); malabsorption
• Post-inflammatory Varicose eczema; lichen planus; systemic sclerosis
• Other Benign naevi; malignant melanoma; chronic renal failure (lemon
yellow); liver disease (jaundice); acanthosis nigricans
Freckles and lentigines
• Freckles are small, light brown macules—typically facial—which
darken in the sun. They are common particularly in red heads and
develop in childhood. Require no treatment
• Lentigines Are also brown macules but more scattered and do not
darken in the sun. Most common in elderly sun-exposed skin

Chloasma Patterned macular symmetrical facial pigmentation, usually
involving the forehead and/or cheeks (see Figure 17.6), 5 >> 4. Peak age
20–40y. Affects dark skins > fair skins.
Risk factors Pregnancy (usually fades after delivery); taking CHC or depot
contraceptives (may be slow to fade when stopped); use of cosmetics,
perfumes, or deodorant soap.
Management Reassurance is normally all that is needed. Consider:
• Stopping hormonal contraception
• Avoid irritating the skin with strong soaps/abrasive cleaners
• Vigorous photoprotection using sunscreen and hat
• 20% azelaic acid cream or 0.05% tretinoin cream may be used but
requires application for >6mo to have any effect
•	Rarely, patients are so worried about their appearance that
camouflage cosmetics are warranted
• Laser resurfacing—mixed results—refer for expert advice

Albinism Prevalence: 1:20,000. Rare genetic syndrome (autosomal

recessive inheritance) in which the melanocytes are unable to produce
skin, hair, or eye pigment. Patients have white hair, pale skin, pink eyes,
poor sight, photophobia, and nystagmus. Several different varieties exist.
Management Strict sun avoidance, sunglasses, sunscreens, refer any skin
lesions for biopsy (i risk squamous cell carcinoma).

Vitiligo Affects 1% of the population. 4 = 5. Peak age of onset: 10–30y.
Cause: autoimmune; 18% have a family history. Associations: pernicious
anaemia, Addison’s and thyroid disease.
Presentation May be precipitated by injury or sunburn. Presents as smooth
sharply defined white macules or patches which contain no melanocytes
(see Figure 17.7). Skin appears bright white under Wood’s light. Often
symmetrical distribution. Hair may also be affected. Most common sites:
hands, wrists, knees, neck, face, around eyes, and mouth.
Differential diagnosis Post-inflammatory hypopigmentation, chemical
exposure.
Management Prognosis is variable—some develop a few lesions which
remain static; some progress to larger depigmented areas; some repigment.
There is no cure. Advise use of sunscreens for affected areas (ACBS
prescription); camouflage cosmetics (refer to Changing Faces for advice
on application, ACBS prescription). Consider referral to dermatology for
consideration of topical steroid treatment, topical calcineurin inhibitors
(tacrolimus, pimecrolimus—unlicensed), or phototherapy.
Morphoea (localized scleroderma) 5:4 83:1. Cutaneous
localized form of scleroderma. Pathologically distinct from lesions of
systemic sclerosis. Internal disease is not associated. Cause: autoimmune
but not fully understood—may follow trauma. Presents with round/oval
plaques of induration and erythema which become smooth, shiny and
white, with violet borders. Eventually leaving atrophic hairless pigmented
patches. Affects trunk/proximal limbs. No established treatment—topical
steroids are often tried. Usually resolves spontaneously in 3–5y.

Hair and sweat gland problems
Hair loss or alopecia May be diffuse or localized, scarring or nonscarring. Treatment is according to cause. Differential diagnosis:
• Diffuse non-scarring Male pattern baldness (responds to topical
minoxidil and 1mg finasteride orally but hair loss returns as soon
as stopped—neither treatment is available on NHS prescription);
hypothyroidism; iron deficiency; malnutrition; hypopituitarism;
hypoadrenalism; drug-induced
• Localized non-scarring Alopecia areata; ringworm; traumatic; hair
pulling; traction; SLE; secondary syphilis
• Scarring Burns; radiation; shingles; tertiary syphilis; lupus
erythematosus; morphoea; lichen planus
Alopecia areataG Common chronic inflammatory disease affecting the
hair follicles ± nails (710%). Patches of hair loss usually on the scalp (see
Figure 17.8) but can affect any hair-bearing skin. 20% have a family history.
Consider alternative diagnosis of tinea capitis if scales/erythema present.
Management Investigation is usually unnecessary. If mild hair loss, reassure
and monitor hair loss; refer more severe cases to dermatology. Treatment
options include topical/locally injected/systemic steroids ± contact
immunotherapy. 740% recover in <1y; 20% lose all scalp hair—recovery
in these cases is unusual (<10%). Psychological support may be needed.

Figure 17.8 Alopecia areata

Hirsutism Excess hair in androgenic distribution (b p. 342)
Hypertrichosis Excess hair in non-androgenic distribution—usually face

and trunk, although can be generalized. Mostly drug-induced (e.g. phenytoin,
ciclosporin, minoxidil). If not, investigate to find other causes: malnutrition,
anorexia nervosa, porphyria cutanea tarda, malignancy. If a cause cannot be
found, treat symptomatically with electrolysis, bleaching, waxing ± depilatories.
Local hypertrichosis Can be associated with topical steroid usage, be over
a melanocytic naevus, or associated with spina bifida occulta.
Hidradenitis suppuritiva Chronic inflammatory condition of sweat
glands in axilla, groin, and perineum. Nodules, abscesses, cysts, and
sinuses form l scarring. Treat with topical antiseptics (e.g. chlorhexidine),
systemic antibiotics ± surgical drainage/excision.

Hair and sweat gland problems

Hyperhidrosis Sweating, or perspiration, is normal and essential for
temperature control. The amount people sweat varies enormously.
Usually sweating can be controlled with shop-bought antiperspirants and
is only excessive when it cannot be controlled and interferes with the
patient’s quality of life. Excessive sweating may be focal or generalized.
Generalized hyperhidrosis Most likely to occur s to other medical
conditions. Where possible treat the cause:
• Physiological After and during exercise; hot, humid conditions;
emotional response (e.g. anxiety)
• Infection Can occur with any bacterial or viral infection. Consider
malaria if recent history of travel
• Non-infective Menopause; thyrotoxicosis; phaeochromocytoma;
lymphoma; leukaemia
If no cause is found, β-blockers (e.g. propranolol 40mg od/bd) or SSRIs
(e.g. fluoxetine 20mg od) may be effective (unlicensed).
Focal hyperhidrosis Usually a primary condition—mainly affects the
axillae, palms, soles of feet, and/or face. Affects 75% of the population.
Onset is typically in the teenage years. Distressing and socially disabling.
• Advice for patients—avoid clothing made of Lycra, nylon, and other
man-made fibres, and tight clothing; wear colours that do not show
the sweat, e.g. white, black; use emollient washes/moisturizers rather
than soap; identify trigger factors for sweating (e.g. alcohol, crowded
rooms) and avoid those situations
• Treat topically with 20% aluminium chloride (e.g. Anhydrol Forte®).
Apply to clean skin at night—wash off in morning. d frequency of
application as symptoms subside. Treat local irritation with topical
steroid, e.g. hydrocortisone 1%. Absorbent dusting powder may help
axillary/plantar sweating
• Consider a trial of drug therapy with B-blockers (e.g. propranolol
40mg od/bd) or SSRIs (e.g. fluoxetine 20mg od) (both unlicensed uses)
•	Refer to dermatology or vascular surgery if not responding
Secondary care treatments include:
• Iontophoresis For palmar/foot hyperhidrosis. A mild electric current
is passed through the skin whilst immersed in a warm water bath.
Multiple sessions are needed initially then treatments every 6wk–6mo
• Botulinum toxin injections For isolated excess sweating of the axillae/
groins. d sweating. Lasts 4–12mo then repeat injections are needed
• Endoscopic transthoracic sympathectomy (ETS) 99% effective for
palmar hyperhidrosis; 80% effective for axillary hyperhidrosis; 70%
effective for facial flushing, blushing, or sweating. Expect compensatory
hyperhidrosis elsewhere (usually the small of the back)

Assessment
• Take a history Duration, initial changes, evolution of changes, other
systemic or local symptoms, family history, drug and alcohol history,
occupation, hobbies
• Examine Colour, shape, extent, and pattern of involvement; consider

Atopic eczema
Affects 15–20% of schoolchildren and 2–10% of adults—usually starts
<6mo of age, and by 1y 60% of those likely to develop eczema will have
done so. Associated with other atopic conditions, e.g. asthma, hay fever.
Remission occurs by 15y of age in 75%, although some relapse later.

Differential diagnosis Scabies; ringworm; rare syndromes, e.g.
Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome; dermatitis herpetiformis.

Presentation Waxing and waning itchy condition. 0 If no itching then
unlikely to be eczema.

Infants Itchy vesicular exudative eczema on face (see
Figure 17.9) ± hands, often with s infection. May cause
sleep disturbance due to itch. >½ are free of eczema
by 18mo.
Children >18mo Involves antecubital and popliteal fossae (see
Figure 17.10), neck, wrists, and ankles. Lichenification, excoriation, and dry
skin are common. Face may be erythematous and have typical infraorbital
folds. Loss of self-esteem, behaviour, and sleep problems are common.
Adults Most commonly irritant hand dermatitis (see Figure 17.11) in a
person with past history of atopic eczema—b p. 609. A few continue
to have generalized atopic eczema; <2% develop new eczema aged >20y.
May interfere with employment/social activities. Exacerbated by stress.
Diagnosis Itchy skin plus ≥3 of:
• Itching in skin creases
• Generally dry skin
• History of asthma or hay fever
• Visible flexural eczema
• Onset in the first 2y of life
Assessment Ask about:
• Family (two-thirds) and personal history of atopy and eczema
• Onset and distribution of the disease
• Aggravating factors (pets, irritants, e.g. soaps/detergents, allergens)
• Sleep disturbance due to itching/rubbing
• Impact on quality of life (school work, career, social life)
• Previous treatments (including dietary restrictions), expectations of
treatment and other medications being taken (e.g. steroids for asthma)
• Nipple eczema May be Paget’s disease of the breast (b p. 688).
Refer urgently to a breast surgeon if no response to topical treatmentN.

Complications
• Skin thickening and scaling
• Bacterial infection Secondary infection (usually with Staph. aureus)
commonly causes exacerbations and may not be seen as obvious
infection. Bacterial infection is suggested by presence of crusting or
weeping or sudden deterioration of eczema
• Viral infection i susceptibility to infection, e.g. viral warts, molluscum.
Eczema herpeticum—propensity to develop widespread lesions with
HSV and VZ; may require admission and IV aciclovir
• Cataracts Rarely occur in young adults with very severe eczema
• Growth retardation Children with severe eczema, cause unknown.
A growth chart should be kept for children with chronic severe eczema

Management
• Education is time well spent—explain the condition and provide
verbal and written information on a stepped approach to care and
management of flaresN
• Advise—loose cotton clothing; avoid wool (exacerbates eczema);
avoid excessive heat; keep nails short; gloves in bed
• If a specific irritant is identified (e.g. house dust mite, pets) then avoid

Specific treatment
• Emollients Topical creams/ointments and bath emollients—use
regularly on skin and as soap substitutes, even if skin is clear. May
need to try several to find one that suits. Ideally apply 3–4x/d to
moist skin. Ensure enough is supplied. Addition of an antipruritic, e.g.
lauromacrogol to the emollient, may help break the scratch–itch cycle.
Addition of an antiseptic to bath emollient may d bacterial infection
• Topical steroids Prescribe the least potent strength that is effective.
Use od or bd. Ointments are preferable on dry, scaly eczema; creams
on wet, exudative eczema. Emollients d steroid requirement
• Antibiotics For infected eczema—topical (alone or in combination
with steroid, e.g. Fucidin® H) or oral (e.g. flucloxacillin or erythromycin
250–500mg qds for 2wk). Swab if antibiotic treatment is ineffective
• Oral steroids Rescue therapy while waiting for an urgent consultant
opinion. Only use short courses, e.g prednisolone 20–30mg od for 5d
• Topical immunosuppressants, e.g. tacrolimus—on consultant advice only
• Antihistamines Sedative antihistamines given nocte d desire to itch,
e.g. promethazine, hydroxyzine
• Bandages Excoriated or lichenified eczema—ichthammol or zinc and
calamine. Bandages can be applied at night on top of steroid ointment.
Refer to dermatology
• Wet wrapping Used for exudative eczema—tubigrip bandage or
tubular gauze soaked in emollient is applied and covered with a dry
bandage. Refer to dermatology
• Dietary manipulation Few (<10%) benefit. Egg and milk are most
commonly excluded. Refer to a dietician to avoid malnutrition

Referral E = Emergency admission; U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine
• Infection with disseminated HSV (eczema herpeticum)—E
• Severe eczema resistant to treatment. Additional secondary care
treatments include phototherapy and immunosuppressive agents—U
• Infection which cannot be cleared in primary care—U
• Severe social/psychological problems due to eczema—S
• Treatment requires excessive amounts of topical steroids—S
• Failure to control symptoms in primary care—R
• Patient/family might benefit from additional advice on application of
treatments (e.g. bandaging techniques)—R
• Patch testing required if contact dermatitis suspected—R
• Dietary factors are suspected (refer direct to dietician)—R
Prurigo nodularis (nodular prurigo) Intensely itchy firm lumps
1–2cm in diameter. Cause unknown, but 80% have a history of atopy.
Exclude scabies and systemic causes of itching (b p. 594). Treatment: topical steroids ± occlusion. May need sedating antihistamine for itch.

Atopic eczema

Contact dermatitisG Precipitated by an exogenous agent which is:
• Irritant (e.g. water, abrasives, chemicals, detergent), or
• Allergen (e.g. nickel—10% 5, 1% 4; chrome; rubber)
Clinical presentation is often indistinguishable. More common in patients
with a past history of atopic eczema. In some patients contact dermatitis
may be an industrial disease (b p. 116). Differential diagnosis: endogenous
eczema, psoriasis, fungal infection.
Presentation Affects any part of the body but most commonly the hands—
site and knowledge of occupation, hobbies, sports, etc help elucidate cause.
• Acute itchy erythema and skin oedema ± papules, vesicles, or blisters
• Chronic lichenification, scaling, and fissuring
Management
• Identification of the allergen or irritant Consider referral for patch
testing (b p. 684)
• Exclusion of the offending allergen or irritant from the environment
Although this may be impossible. There is some evidence that nickel
avoidance diets can help patients with nickel sensitivityG. Nickel testing
kits are available from dermatology departments
• Hand care See Table 17.5
• Emollients Help skin to recover—apply frequently
• Topical steroids Help but are secondary to avoidance measures
• Exclude/treat secondary infection
Table 17.5 Hand care
Hand
washing

Use warm water and substitute soap with emollient, e.g.
aqueous cream; dry with a clean cotton towel—avoid paper
towels or drying machines

Avoidance

Avoid handling hair preparations (including shampoos),
other detergents, household or industrial cleaning fluids, raw
vegetables (e.g. peeling potatoes, tomato juice); fruits (e.g.
peeling oranges); or raw meat

Protection

If performing any task where hands would get wet or any of
the substances listed above are being handled, wear cotton
gloves under PVC gloves. Wear gloves for dusty work or in
the cold

Medication

Use emollients frequently throughout the day (e.g.
Diprobase® cream). If necessary, apply a thin layer of steroid
ointment od/bd

Other eczemas
Discoid (nummular) eczema
•	Middle-aged/elderly patients. 4 > 5. Unknown cause
• Presentation Intensely itchy, coin-shaped lesions on limbs. Tend to be
symmetrical. May be vesicular or chronic and lichenified
• Differential diagnosis Tinea corporis; contact dermatitis, psoriasis
• Management Often clears spontaneously after a few weeks but tends
to recur. If treatment is needed, use a moderate or potent topical
steroid. Secondary infection is common—treat with topical/systemic
antibiotics. A sedating antihistamine (e.g. hydroxyzine 50mg nocte) may
be useful if sleep is disturbed by itching

Venous (stasis, varicose) eczema
•	Middle-aged/elderly patients. 5 > 4
• Associated with underlying venous disease
• Early signs Capillary veins and haemosiderin deposition around the
ankles and over prominent varicose veins
• Later signs (see Figure 17.12) Eczema ± lipodermatosclerosis (fibrosis
of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue) ± ulceration
• Management Emollients ± mild or moderate steroid ointment (avoid
long-term use) and compression hosiery. Treat venous disease
(b p. 288) or ulceration (b p. 612) on its own merits

steroid is required

Other eczemas

Pompholyx
• Sago-like intensely itchy vesicles on the sides of fingers ± palms/soles
• No associated atopic eczema or contact dermatitis
•	Young adults. More common in warm weather. Frequently recurrent
• Treat with emollients and topical steroids (some need potent steroids)
• Treat any infection with oral antibiotics
• In severe cases, refer to dermatology for wet dressings

Lichen simplex chronicus Area of lichenified eczema due to
repeated rubbing/scratching. May be due to habit or stress. Treatment:
take scrapings to exclude fungal infection; topical steroids; occlusive dressing (e.g. Duoderm®) to protect skin from scratching.

Seborrhoeic dermatitis Chronic scaly eruption affecting scalp, face
and/or chest. Differential diagnosis: psoriasis, rosacea, contact dermatitis,
fungal infection. Five patterns:
• Scalp and facial involvement Most common in young men. Excessive
dandruff, itchy scaly erythematous eruption affecting sides of the nose,
eyes, ears, hairline. May be associated blepharitis
• Petaloid Dry, scaly eczema over the pre-sternal area
• Pityrosporum folliculitis Erythematous follicular eruption with
papules/pustules over the back
• Flexural Most common in the elderly. Axillae, groins, and
submammary areas. Moist intertrigo. Associated with s candida
infection
• Infantile b p. 903
Treatment
• Facial, truncal, and flexural involvement Imidazole + hydrocortisone.
Pityrosporum folliculitis may respond to itraconazole 200mg od for 7d
or fluconazole 50mg od for 2wk
• Scalp lesions Ketoconazole or coal tar shampoo. In resistant cases,
apply 2% sulphur + 2% salicylic acid cream several hours before
shampooing
• Recurrence requiring repeated treatment is common. Consider
maintenance treatment with topical antifungal every other week
0 Severe or recalcitrant seborrhoeic dermatitis is an indicator disease for
HIV infection—offer HIV testing.

Dandruff Is exaggerated physiological exfoliation of fine scales from an

otherwise normal scalp. More severe forms merge with seborrhoeic dermatitis and treatment is the same.

• Duration of ulceration
• Pain—painful, unless neuropathic when often painless
•	Mobility
• Past history of ulceration, DVT, or varicose vein surgery
• History of trauma to the limb
• Systemic disease—e.g. DM, peripheral vascular disease, RA
Examination
• Ulcer Position; evidence of infection; surrounding callus—typical of
neuropathic ulcers; evidence of tracking to involve the bones of the foot
• Leg Pulses; varicose veins and/or signs of venous hypertension—
haemosiderin pigmentation, varicose eczema, atrophie blanche (white
lacy scars), lipodermatosclerosis; sensation—d when peripheral
neuropathy; range of joint movement
Investigation
• Bloods FBC, ESR, VDRL, blood glucose
• Ankle–brachial pressure index (b p. 237)
• Swab for M,C&S if any signs of cellulitis/infection
• Diabetic ulcer—if signs of infection, X-ray foot to exclude osteomyelitis
Management
• Arterial ulcers Refer to vascular surgery
• Diabetic foot ulcers Refer to a specialist diabetic foot team
• Venous ulcers If ABPI >0.8, can be managed in the community with
graduated compression bandaging (elastic bandages applied in multiple
layers over a non-adherent dressing). Change dressings 1–2x/wk.
Keep skin under the bandage moist with simple emollients and treat
surrounding eczema with topical steroids. Give analgesia. Encourage
walking, weight d if obese, and elevation of the leg when resting.
65–70% heal in <6mo. Recommend compression hosiery after healing
Referral
• Non-healing ulcers or ulcers of uncertain cause Dermatology
• ABPI <0.8 Vascular surgery
• Varicose veins Vascular surgery—60% may benefit from vein surgery

Ulcers

Prevention of recurrence 5y recurrence rate is 40%—graduated compression
hosiery d recurrence. Below-knee class 2 stockings are adequate for most
and can be prescribed with NHS prescription but are difficult to apply
especially with arthritic hands. Applicators are available and can be obtained
on NHS prescription, via the OT or bought from specialist disability shops.
Complications
• Infection—treat with systemic antibiotics only if rapidly advancing ulcer
edge, cellulitis, or systemic symptoms
• Lymphoedema
• Contact dermatitis to topical medicaments and dressings. Consider
referral for patch testing if suspected
•	Malignant change—squamous cell cancer (rare). Refer for biopsy to
confirm diagnosis
Pyoderma gangrenosum Uncommon cause of ulceration. Starts as a
pustule/inflamed nodule that breaks down to form an ulcer that often expands
rapidly and is painful (see Figure 17.13). The ulcer has a purplish margin and
surrounding erythema. Usually on trunk/lower limbs. Refer to dermatology.
Causes UC (50% patients with pyoderma gangrenosum); Crohn’s disease; RA;
Behçet’s syndrome; multiple myeloma and monoclonal gammopathy; leukaemia.

Bed sores or pressure ulcers
• Caused by pressure necrosis of the skin. Immobile patients
are at high risk—especially if frail ± incontinent
• If at risk, refer to the DN for advice on prevention of bed sores—
protective mattresses and cushions, incontinence advice, guidance
on positioning and movement
• Warn carers to make contact with the DN if a red patch does
not improve 24h after relieving the pressure on the area. Treat
aggressively and admit if not resolving

Dermatology

Urticaria and angio-oedema
Urticaria (hives or nettle rash) Common; affects 1 in 6 at some

time. Superficial, itchy swellings of the skin or weals (see Figure 17.14)
come and go in an attack giving the appearance of a shifting rash.

Figure 17.14 Typical urticarial lesions in a child

Angio-oedema Deeper longer-lasting swellings; painful rather than
itchy. Commonly affect eyes, lips, genitalia, hands, and/or feet. May affect
bowel (abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) or airway (tongue
swelling, shortness of breath, wheeze). If airway compromise, consider
anaphylaxis (b p. 1072).
Classification (see Table 17.6) Half present with urticaria alone; 1 in 10
has angio-oedema alone; the remainder have both.
Management of acute urticaria Only treat if needed:
• Try antihistamines for itch—non-sedating for daytime (e.g. cetirizine,
fexofenadine) ± sedative if interferes with sleep (e.g. chlorphenamine,
hydroxyzine). If one antihistamine is ineffective, try another
• Topical menthol 1% cream is an alternative/adjunct to antihistamines
• If severe, consider short-course steroids (e.g. prednisolone 40 mg od
for 3–5d). If rebound symptoms after stopping, seek specialist advice
Management of chronic urticaria Check FBC, ESR, and TFTs.
Assess severity and impact of symptoms. Identify potential causes. Advise
to avoid non-specific aggravating factors, e.g. overheating, stress, alcohol,
aspirin/codeine, and NSAIDs if aspirin-sensitive. Prescribe antihistamines
for itch as for acute urticaria. If these measures do not control symptoms,
refer. Other treatments are usually specialist-initiated and unlicensed.
They include H2 receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine, ranitidine) and antileukotrienes (e.g. montelukast)—response is highly variable.

Management of angio-oedema

•
•
•
•

If anaphylaxis is suspected, give adrenaline and admit (b p. 1072)
If any airway compromise, admit—even if anaphylaxis is not suspected
Otherwise treat as for acute urticaria; monitor for airway compromise
If not taking ACE inhibitor, refer to allergy clinic/immunology; if taking
ACE inhibitor, stop—refer if symptoms continue/recur after >3mo

Urticaria pigmentosa (cutaneous mastocytosis)

Appears in infancy (usually <2wk old). Dark freckle-like
lesions on the face, limbs, or trunk become urticarial when
the skin is rubbed. No treatment is needed—clears spontaneously in childhood.

Urticaria and angio-oedema

Table 17.6 Classification of urticaria and angio-oedema
Type

Features

Ordinary/
idiopathic

Spontaneous weals ± angio-oedema. Individual weals last 2–24h
• Acute <6wk of continuous activity
• Chronic ≥6wk of continuous activity—affects 1–5/1,000. May remit/
relapse. Relapses are triggered by illness, stress, drugs, alcohol or
hormonal changes (e.g. menstruation). 50% resolve in 3–5y; 20%
persist >10y. Associated with autoimmune thyroid disease (i 2x);
children/adolescents have i prevalence of coeliac disease. Severe
impact on quality of life—14% develop depression
• Episodic (acute intermittent/recurrent) Symptoms last hours/
days but recur over months/years. Treated like chronic urticaria
Cause unknown. Triggers include: stress, overheating, drugs, alcohol,
viral infections (particularly children)

Physical

Except for delayed pressure urticaria, weals last <1h. Induced by a
specific physical stimulus; avoidance prevents attacks:
• Mechanical Delayed pressure urticaria (weals appear in 2–6h
and fade over 48h); symptomatic dermographism; vibratory
angio-oedema
• Thermal Cholinergic urticaria (induced by sweating); cold
contact urticaria; localized heat urticaria
• Other Aquagenic urticaria (contact with water); solar urticaria;
exercise-induced anaphylaxis

Contact

Weals last <2h. Caused by allergens (e.g. nuts, shellfish, milk, eggs,
penicillin, insect stings, latex) or chemicals (e.g. drugs—opioids, aspirin,
NSAIDs; radio-contrast media; food additives—azo-dyes, preservatives)
Refer for allergy testing if a specific allergen is suspected

Urticarial
vasculitis

Individual weals last >24h; lesions are burning/painful rather than
itchy and/or lesions leave scaling, bruising, purpura/petechial
haemorrhages. Suspect if relentless rather than self-limiting
urticaria. Other associated features: joint pains, fever, and/or malaise.
Refer. Diagnosis is confirmed by skin biopsy. Specialist treatment:
steroids and/or other immunosuppressive agents

Autoimmune

Urticaria, pyrexia, and malaise + disease-specific features. May be
hereditary or acquired (e.g. SLE)—treat the cause

Lone
angio-oedema

Swellings last <3d. Causes: idiopathic; drug-induced (ACE inhibitors,
ARBs, NSAIDs); C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency

C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency (hereditary angio-oedema)

Autosomal dominant—usually presents in puberty with episodes of
angio-oedema without weals. d C4 level suggests the diagnosis. Emergency
treatment is with hospital admission for C1 inhibitor concentrate infusion.
Maintenance therapy (under consultant supervision with anabolic steroids
or tranexamic acid) is necessary only for patients with symptomatic
recurring angio-oedema or related abdominal pain.

Dermatology

Acne
Chronic inflammatory condition characterized by comedones, papules,
pustules, cysts, and scars. Acne vulgaris is common and affects >80% teenagers; 50% have a family history. Peak age: 18y; 4 = 5.
Cause Complex—androgen secretion results in i sebum excretion;
pilosebaceous duct blockage (producing comedones); colonization of the
duct with Propionibacterium acnes bacteria and release of inflammatory
mediators. Inflammatory acne is the result of the host response to the
follicular Propionibacterium acnes.

Rarer causes

• Drugs—systemic steroids,
• Endocrine—PCOS, Cushing’s,
androgens, topical steroids
virilizing tumours
• Infantile—faces of male infants—
• Squeezing—acne excoriée
cause unknown
• Aromatic industrial
• Physical occlusion, e.g. under a
chemicals—chloracne
violinist’s chin
• Cosmetics
Presentation Spots on face, neck ± back and chest. Examination
reveals blackheads (dilated pores with black plug of keratin = comedones)
and whiteheads (small cream-coloured dome-shaped papules); red papules; pustules ± cysts. There may be scarring from old lesions. Burrowing
abscesses and sinuses with scarring (conglobate acne) are seen in severe
cases. Scars may become keloidal. 0 Severity of acne (see Table 17.7) is
often overestimated by the patient and minimized by the doctor.

Differential diagnosis Rosacea (b p. 598), bacterial folliculitis (often
coexists—b p. 633), milia (b p. 621), perioral dermatitis.

Management Aims to:d number of lesions; prevent scarring; d the

psychological impact of the condition.
• Misconceptions Explain:
• Acne is not a disease of poor hygiene. The black tip of a comedone
is oxidized sebum not dirt
• Diet is not associated with acne
• Picking at acne does not improve it and can cause scarring
• General measures Wash with soap and warm (not hot or cold) water
twice daily. Do not excessively scrub the skin. Use a fragrance-free
water-based emollient if dry skin—avoid greasy preparations
• Medication (see Table 17.5) Warn patients any treatment takes weeks l
months to work fully and is usually continued for months/years; reassess
progress every 2–3mo and continue treatment until new lesions stop
developing

Complications Acne is not a trivial disease—it can cause scars (both
skin and emotional) that last a lifetime. Anxiety, social isolation, and lack
of self-confidence are common—ask specifically about these factors and
treat as needed.
Perioral dermatitis Papules and pustules which appear around the
mouth and chin of a woman, often after use of topical steroids. Treat with
oral tetracycline as for acne.

Acne

Table 17.7 Treatment of acne (see BNF 13.6)
Severity

Description

Management

Mild

Open and closed
comedones and some
papules

Topical treatment applied to the whole area
(not just the spots):
Benzoyl peroxide applied bd—start at
lowest strength and build up as needed
Topical retinoids (e.g. isotretinoin)—apply
low strength preparation every 2–3 nights
initially and build up strength and frequency
as tolerated; warn patients to avoid the sun.
Retinoids cause erythema and scaling in
most patients which settles with time and
acne may worsen for the first few weeks
of treatment
Topical antibiotics (e.g. clindamycin)—
resistance is increasing, use only in
combination with benzoyl peroxide or if
benzoyl peroxide has failed. Avoid if using
oral antibiotics

Moderate

More frequent papules
and pustules with mild
scarring

Try topical treatment first. If not working
after 4–8wk, try either:
Long-term oral antibiotics (e.g. lymecycline
408mg od or tetracycline 500mg bd) for a
minimum of 8wk, or
For girls, an anti-androgen for >6mo (e.g.
cyproterone acetate in co-cyprindiol—also
contraceptive)
0 Topical benzoyl peroxide ± isotretinoin
may be used simultaneously with systemic
therapy

Severe

Nodular abscesses l
more widespread
scarring

As for moderate acne. If ineffective, or rapid
relapse after antibiotics are stopped, refer
to dermatology for consideration of oral
retinoid treatment

• Oral retinoids are teratogenic

Referral to dermatology U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine

• Acne fulminans. Seen in adolescent males; severe acne is associated
with fever, arthritis, and vasculitis—U
• Severe acne or painful, deep nodules or cysts and could benefit from
oral isotretinoin—S
• Severe social/psychological sequelae—S
• At risk of/developing scarring despite primary care remedies—R

Psoriasis
Chronic, non-infectious inflammatory skin condition. Epidermal cell proliferation rate is i x20 and turnover time d from 28 to 4d. Affects 72% Caucasian
population (less in other races). Mean age 28y; rare <8y. 4 = 5. Associations:
inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s > UC); i risk CVD (check BP, lipids;
exclude DM). Presentation: see Table 17.8.
Cause Genetic (polygenic; 35% have a family history; if one parent
affected, there is a 25% probability that a child will be affected—60%
chance with two). Environmental factors trigger disease, e.g. trauma
(Koebner phenomenon); infection; drugs (e.g. β-blockers, NSAIDs, lithium); alcohol; sunlight (aggravates psoriasis in 10%); psychological stress.
Management Explain the condition/treatment options. Discuss its
chronic nature and reassure not infectious. Social/psychological problems
are common. Be supportive. Advise on self-help groups.
Drug treatment (see BNF 13.5) Frequent emollients ±
• Salicylic acid d surface scale. Available as Lassar’s paste (apply bd) or
with dithranol (Psorin®) or coal tar (e.g. Sebco®)
• Coal tar Anti-inflammatory + anti-scaling. The thicker the patch the
stronger the preparation needed. d smell by topping with emollient
• Vitamin D analogue (e.g. calcipotriol, tacalcitol). Plaque/scalp
psoriasis—effective and no unpleasant smell or staining of clothing
• Dithranol Plaque psoriasis—apply to lesion only. Stains
• Topical retinoids (e.g. tazarotene) Mild/moderate plaque psoriasis
• Topical steroids (e.g. Dovobet®) Can be used on localized plaques.
Less useful in widespread disease. Avoid prolonged use
0 Plaques can become inflamed and/or aggravated on starting topical
treatments, after prolonged use, or if steroids are stopped suddenly.

Generalized
pustular

Rare but serious. Unwell with fever and malaise. Sheets of
small sterile yellowish pustules develop on an erythematous
background and spread rapidly. Admit

Plaque (see
Figure 17.15a)

Most common form. Well-defined disc-shaped plaques involving
the knees, elbows, scalp, hair margin, or sacrum. Plaques are
usually red and covered with waxy white scales which may leave
bleeding points if detached. Plaques may be itchy. Differential
diagnosis: psoriasiform drug eruption; hypertrophic lichen planus

Scalp psoriasis

Very common. May be confused with dandruff but generally
better demarcated and thicker scales

Guttate (see
Figure 17.15b)

Acute symmetrical raindrop lesions on trunk/limbs. Most common
in adolescents/young adults—may follow streptococcal throat
infection. Differential diagnosis: pityriasis rosea

Flexural

Affects axillae, submammary areas, and natal cleft. Plaques are
smooth and often glazed. Most common in elderly patients.
Differential diagnosis: flexural candidiasis

Nail

Nail bed is affected in 50%. Fingernails > toenails. Thimble pitting,
onycholysis, and oily patches (oily brownish yellow discoloration
of the nail bed—often adjacent to onycholysis). Associated with
arthropathy. Treatment is difficult. Differential diagnosis: fungal nail
infection (0 can coexist so send clippings for mycology)

Dermatology

Lichen planus and keratinization
disorders
Lichen planus Very itchy, polygonal, flat-topped papular lesions 2–5mm

diameter, affecting flexor surfaces, palms/soles, mucous membranes
(two-thirds), and genitalia in a symmetrical pattern. Koebner phenomenon
(lesions occur in the line of damaged skin due to a scratch—see Figure 17.16a)
is exhibited. Papules may have a surface network of white lines (Wickham’s
striae). Initially papules are red but become violaceous. Papules flatten over
a few months to leave pigmentation or occasionally become hypertrophic.
Two-thirds of cases occur in the 30–60y age group. 4 = 5. Cause unknown.
Variants:
• Annular (10%). Commonly on glans penis
• Atrophic Rare, associated with hypertrophic lesions
• Bullous Blistering is rare
• Follicular May occur with typical lichen planus or just affect the scalp
• Hypertrophic Plaques may persist for years
• Mucous membrane (see Figure 17.16b) Alone or with skin changes

Differential diagnosis Lichenoid drug eruption; psoriasis.
Complications
• Nail involvement (10%)—longitudinal pitting and grooving
• Scalp—scarring alopecia
•	Malignant change X—it is controversial whether oral lichen planus
can undergo malignant transformation. If it can, risk is low (<2% over
10y). NICE recommends patients with confirmed oral lichen planus are
monitored for oral cancer as part of routine dental examinationN
Management Emollients and moderate/high potency topical steroids provide
symptomatic relief. Sedating antihistamines may be useful if sleep disturbed.
Oral lesions can be treated with hydrocortisone pellets. Rarely, oral lesions
are a reaction to mercury amalgam fillings—removing the fillings and replacing
them with other materials may solve the problem. Refer to dermatology if:
• Diagnosis is in doubt
• Potentially scarring nail dystrophy
• Extensive involvement
•	Resistant to topical treatment
Specialist treatment involves oral steroids ± PUVA.
Prognosis 50% are clear in <9mo; 15% have continuing symptoms >18mo;
20% have a further attack.

Lichen planus and keratinization disorders

Lichen planus-like drug eruptions Recorded after treatment with:

•

Phenothiazines
Streptomycin
Tetracycline
Isoniazid

• Gold
• Quinine
• Chloroquine

Resolution after withdrawal of the drug is often slow.

Lichen sclerosus b p. 731
Callosities Painless localized thickenings of the keratin layer—protec-

tive response to friction/pressure. Management: keratolytics, e.g. 5–10%
salicylic acid ointment or 10% urea cream; attention to footwear.
Corns Painful. Develop at areas of high local pressure on the feet, e.g.
where shoes press on bony protrusions. Management: attention to footwear, keratolytics, cushioning (e.g. corn pads). Occasionally surgery may
be indicated if deformity of the foot causes recurrent corns.
Keratosis pilaris Common, sometimes inherited condition. Small horny
plugs are on the upper thigh, upper arm, and face (see Figure 17.17). Associated
with icthyosis vulgaris. Keratolytics, e.g. 10% urea cream improve symptoms.
Ichthyosis Inherited disorders characterized by dry scaly skin. Most
common form is ichthyosis vulgaris: prevalence 1 in 300, autosomal dominant. Small branny scales on extensor aspects of limbs and back. Mild
and often undiagnosed. Management: topical emollients ± bath additives.
Severe cases require dermatology advice.
Keratoderma Hyperkeratosis of palms and soles. Tylosis is diffuse
hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. It is usually inherited (autosomal dominant) but rarely may be associated with oesophageal cancer.
Acquired keratoderma occurs in women around the menopause and
patients with lichen planus. Treat with keratolytics, e.g. 10% urea cream.
Milia Small white raised 1–2mm diameter spots (see Figure 17.18) resulting
from small keratin-filled cysts. Usually on the face (upper cheeks and eyelids).
Most common in children but can occur at any age. No treatment is required.

Pityriasis and seborrhoeic warts
Pityriasis rosea Acute self-limiting disorder most commonly affecting
teenagers and young adults. Cause: unknown, possibly viral. Generalized
eruption is preceded by the herald patch—a single large, oval lesion
2–5cm diameter (see Figure 17.19). Several days later the rash appears
consisting of many smaller lesions mainly on trunk (following the ribs giving a ‘Christmas tree’ pattern) but also upper arms and thighs. Lesions are
oval, pink and have a delicate ‘collarette’ of scale. May be asymptomatic or
cause mild/moderate itch. Treatment does not speed clearance. Topical
steroid may relieve itch. Fades spontaneously in 4–8wk.

Herald

Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor Chronic, often asymptomatic, fungal

infection of the skin (Pityrosporum orbiculare). Common in humid/tropical conditions. In the UK often affects young adults and teenagers. On
untanned, white skin appears as pinkish-brown, oval, or round patches
with a fine superficial scale. In tanned or darker skin patchy hypopigmentation occurs (see Figure 17.20). Involves trunk ± proximal limbs.
Management Topical imidazole antifungal (e.g. clotrimazole cream bd), or
topical selenium sulfide shampoo to all affected areas at night, washed off
the following morning and repeated x2 at weekly intervals. For resistant
cases, try a systemic antifungal, e.g. itraconazole 200mg od, for 1wk.
Recurrences are common. Hypopigmentation may take some time to clear.

Pityriasis and seborrhoeic warts

Pityriasis alba Finely scaled white patches on face or arms (see

Figure 17.21). Affects children/young adults. Associated with atopy. Usually
no treatment is required. Resolves spontaneously over months or years. If
severe refer to dermatology for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment for
severe cases is with topical steroids and/or PUVA.

Seborrhoeic wart (senile wart, basal cell papilloma) Common

>60y. Often multiple—most commonly on trunk. Warty nodules, usually pigmented, 1–6cm diameter with a ‘stuck-on’ appearance (see
Figure 17.22). Pieces of the wart can be picked off. Cause: unknown.
Features on dermoscopy 0 Dermoscopy requires specialized training.
Useful for distinguishing benign/malignant pigmented lesions. Typical
dermoscopic features of seborrhoeic warts are:
• ‘Fat fingers’
• Fissures/ridges
• Irregular crypts
• Blue-grey globules
• Light brown fingerprint-like parallel structures
•	Milia-like cysts—2 types: tiny, white starry and larger, yellowish cloudy
Management Reassurance. If removal is required cryotherapy, curettage,
shave biopsy, and excision biopsy are all effective.

Sunlight and the skin
Skin conditions worsened by sunlight HSV (cold sores); lupus ery-

thematosus (LE); porphyria; rosacea; vitiligo.

Skin conditions improved by sunlight Acne; atopic eczema; pityriasis rosea; psoriasis (10% get worse).
Skin cancer b p. 628 Sunburn b p. 1115 Pellagra b p. 641
Actinic (solar) keratosis (see Figure 17.23a) Single/multiple, discrete,
scaly, hyperkeratotic, rough-surfaced areas over sun-exposed sites (e.g.
dorsum of hands; head, neck). Occasionally occur on lower lip. More common with fairer skin types. May regress spontaneously or be pre-malignant.
Management Removal by cryotherapy, currettage, excision biopsy or
topical:
• Ingenol mebutate (Picato®) gel—150 microgams/g od for 3d to scalp/
face or 500 micrograms/g od to trunk/extremities for 2d
• Fluorouracil cream (Efudix®)—apply thinly od/bd for 3–4wk
• Diclofenac gel (Solareze®)—apply thinly bd for 2–3mo
• Imiquod cream—instructions vary according to preparation.
Advise patients to wear sunblock daily; avoid sun exposure by covering up,
and wear a hat with a brim. Look for other signs of sun damage/malignancy.
Complications Malignant change; cutaneous horn development (see
Figure 17.23b—treat with excision or curettage; send for histology).

Figure 17.23 Actinic keratosis (a) Scalp lesions (b) Keratin horn

Solar urticaria Rare. Wheals appear within minutes of sun exposure.
Differential diagnosis: porphyria. Management: sunscreens, avoidance.
Refer to dermatologist if disabling.
Drug-induced photosensitivity Drugs may produce a light eruption
in exposed areas, by dose-dependent or allergic mechanisms. The reaction
varies according to the drug. Common examples are: amiodarone, chlorpropamide, furosemide, griseofulvin, phenothiazines, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, thiazides, nalidixic acid, coal tar, plant-derived psoralens.
Plant-induced photodermatitis Contact dermatitis (b p. 609) in
light-exposed areas resulting from local sensitization of the skin by contact
with psoralens from plants, e.g. carrots, celery, fennel, parsnip, common
rue, giant hogweed. Oils used in perfumes derived from plants (e.g. oil of
bergamot) may also contain psoralens.

Sunlight and the skin

Polymorphic light eruption Pruritic papules, plaques ± vesicles appear
in sun-exposed areas 724h after exposure (see Figure 17.24). Most common
photodermatosis. 5:4 82:1. Cause: unknown. Management: sunscreens
and avoidance of sun exposure (sit in the shade, long sleeves, trousers,
broad-brimmed hat); a short course of PUVA in the spring may help severe
cases—refer to dermatology. Condition is non-scarring. Differential diagnosis: photoallergic contact dermatitis; drug-induced photosensitivity; lupus.

sun-exposed sites. Management: sunscreens and avoidance. Refer to dermatology for confirmation of diagnosis and advice on further management.

Porphyria A group of rare, mostly inherited, metabolic disorders.

Porphyrins are important in the manufacture of haemoglobin. Deficiency
of enzymes in the porphyrin pathway results in build-up of intermediary
metabolites which are toxic to the skin and nervous system. All require
specialist management by either a general physician or a dermatologist.
The main porphyrias are:
• Acute intermittent porphyria Intermittent attacks precipitated by
many drugs. Presentation: fever, GI symptoms (vomiting, abdominal
pain—can be severe); neuropsychiatric symptoms (hypotonia,
paralysis, fits, impaired vision, peripheral neuritis, odd behaviour—even
psychosis); no skin features. Urine may go deep red on standing
• Porphyria cutanea tarda Most common porphyria. Typically occurs
in male alcoholics with liver damage. Presents with sun-induced
subepidermal blisters on hands which scar. Management: avoidance of
alcohol and aggravating drugs (e.g. oestrogens); venesection; chloroquine
• Erythropoietic protoporphyria Autosomal dominant; starts in
childhood; red blistering eruption leaving scars on hands and nose
• Variegate porphyria Autosomal dominant. Common in South Africa.
Skin signs are like porphyria cutanea tarda, but abdominal pain and
neuropsychiatric symptoms resemble acute intermittent porphyria

Benign skin tumours
Seborrhoeic wart (senile wart, basal cell papilloma) b p. 623
Chondrodermatitis nodularis b p. 945 Milia b p. 621
Naevus Benign proliferation of ≥1 normal constituent of the skin. The
most common type is the melanocytic naevus or ‘mole’. Most develop in
childhood and adolescence. Features:
• Congenital Present at birth in 1% Caucasians (less in darker-skinned
races). Usually >1cm diameter. Large ones have i risk of malignancy
• Junctional Flat, round/oval, brown/black, 2–10mm diameter. Common
sites: soles, palms, genitalia
• Intradermal Dome-shaped papule/nodule commonly on the face or
neck. May be pigmented
• Compound <10mm diameter, smooth surface, variable pigmentation
• Blue Blue-coloured solitary naevus usually found on extremities—
especially hands and feet
• Halo Common in children/adolescents. White halo of depigmentation
surrounds the naevus which then disappears. Associated with vitiligo.
New onset in adults may suggest melanoma elsewhere
Differential diagnosis Freckle, lentigo, seborrhoeic wart, haemangioma (may
be pigmented), dermatofibroma, pigmented BCC, malignant melanoma.
Management Patients usually present if worried about a mole. Any
change merits serious attention. Reasons for excision biopsy:
• Concern about malignancy (b p. 628) • i risk of malignant change
•	Recurrent trauma/inflammation
• Cosmetic reasons
Refer for urgent dermatology assessment if malignancy is suspected.
Dermoscopy features that suggest malignant melanoma—b p. 629
Skin tags Common. Small pedunculated polyps found in axillae, groin,
neck, or on the eyelids. Reassure. Cosmetic removal can be achieved by
snipping across the skin tag with scissors, cryotherapy, or diathermy.
Sebaceous cyst (epidermal cyst) Common. Round or oval,
keratin-filled firm cysts, 1–3cm in diameter, within the skin. Usually a punctum is seen on the surface. Reassure. Treat any complicating bacterial infection with oral antibiotics (e.g. flucloxacillin 500mg qds). Excision is curative.
Dermatofibroma Common (5 > 4; young adult > elderly) and
usually asymptomatic. Firm (sometimes pigmented) nodule 5–10mm in
diameter, that may occur following an insect bite or minor trauma (see
Figure 17.25). Most common site: lower legs. Treatment is with excision
biopsy of symptomatic or diagnostically doubtful lesions.
Keratoacanthoma Rapidly growing nodular tumour (<2cm in diameter) of sun-exposed skin of face/arms—see Figure 17.26. A central keratin plug may fall out to leave a crater. Heals spontaneously over several
months leaving a scar. Differential diagnosis: SCC. Treatment is with excision biopsy to exclude SCC or curettage and cautery.

Benign skin tumours

Figure 17.25 Dermatofibroma

Figure 17.26 Keratoacanthoma

Keloid scar Proliferation of connective tissue presenting as firm
smooth nodules/plaques in response to trauma. A scar is termed hypertrophic if changes are limited to the scar, but keloid if it extends beyond
the limit of the original injury (see Figure 17.27). Most common sites: upper
back, chest, ear lobes. More common in negroid races (2nd–4th decades).
Management Consider steroid injection into the scar. Refer to
dermatologist or plastic surgeon if this is ineffective—other treatments
include cryotherapy or topical silicone gel sheeting.
Pyogenic granuloma Bright red/blood-crusted nodule that bleeds
easily (see Figure 17.28). Typically at the site of trauma (e.g. small cut) and
enlarges rapidly over 2–3wk. Usually occurs in children/young adults. Most
common site: finger. Differential diagnosis: malignant melanoma.
Management
• Pregnant women May disappear spontaneously after delivery
• Other patients Excision biopsy to exclude malignancy; topical
imiquimod is an alternative if diagnosis is certain
Lipoma Common. Benign tumour of fat. Present as soft masses in the
subcutaneous tissue. Often multiple. Most common on trunk, neck, and
upper extremities. Removal by excision is rarely necessary.
Campbell de Morgan spot (cherry angioma) Small bright red
papules on the trunk in middle-aged/elderly patients. Usually require no
treatment. Campbell de Morgan (1811–76)—English surgeon.

Skin cancer
• Sun safety code 80% of skin cancer is preventable.
• Take care not to burn—protect the skin with clothing, including a
shirt, trousers/skirt, hat, and ultraviolet-protective sunglasses
• Seek shade between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m
• Apply high factor sunscreen (≥SPF 30 with high UVA protection)
• Take particular care to protect children in the sun

Cutaneous malignant melanoma Every year in the UK, there

are 11,900 new cases of melanoma (lifetime incidence 1 in 60) and 2,800
deaths. Incidence is rising. Particularly common in Caucasians. Frequently
metastasizes and may present with metastases. Types:
• Superficial spreading 70% UK cases. 5 > 4. Most common site: lower
leg in 5 (50%); back in 4. Macular lesion with variable pigmentation
(see Figure 17.29a)
• Nodular (see Figure 17.29b) 20% UK cases. 4 > 5. Most common on
trunk. Pigmented nodule grows rapidly and may ulcerate
• Lentigo A lentigo maligna arises in sun-damaged skin—usually on the
face—and melanoma develops many years afterwards within it. Most
common >60y—especially if outdoor occupation
• Acral lentiginous 35–60% melanoma in black-skinned populations.
Affects palms, soles, and nail beds. Often detected late. Poor prognosis
Risk factors Sun exposure/sunbed use; genetic (10% have family history);
multiple benign moles (>50 of >2mm diameter); congenital naevus;
previous malignant melanoma; immunosuppression; fair skin type (red hair,
blue eyes, and burns easily); severe sunburn in childhood/adolescence;
30% arise out of pre-existing moles, but risk of change in a benign mole
(except dysplastic or congenital naevus) is small.
Assessment Encourage patients to report changes in moles early. Check
the ABCDEF criteria:
• A Asymmetry of outline
• C Colour variation
• B Border irregularity
• D Diameter
• E Evolution—changes in size, shape, colour, and/or elevation
• F Funny-looking’ mole—‘ugly duckling’ moles that stand out from the
others are very discriminatory for nodular melanoma
Management Use the 7-point checklist (see Box 17.2) ± dermoscopy
findings (if available) to identify changes needing referral. Refer all
suspicious lesions for urgent dermatology assessment ± wide excision.
Dermoscopy 0 Requires specialized training. Useful for distinguishing
benign/malignant pigmented lesions. Use the 3-point checklist—see
Box 17.3.
Specialist treatment Best chance of cure comes with complete excision.
Chemotherapy/radiotherapy are of little benefit, but biological therapies
(e.g. interferon, interleukin-2, ipilimumab, vemurafenib) are commonly
used. A treatment vaccine is currently undergoing clinical trials.
Prognosis Relates to tumour depth at presentation. 5y survival: <0.76mm
deep—95%; >4mm deep—45%; metastases—10%.

• Atypical pigment network Irregular holes and thick lines
(broadened network); streaming (irregular finger-like projections
at the edge of the lesion) and pseudopods (bulbous areas of
pigmentation joined to the tumour body or pigmented network at
the periphery of the lesion) are also atypical
• Blue-white structures Blue-white veil (irregular, structureless area
of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white ‘ground-glass’
haze) ± regression structures (e.g. scar-like depigmentation)

Dermatology

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) 20% of skin cancer in the UK.

Most common >55y; 4 > 5. May metastasize (10%). Usually develops in
sun-exposed sites, e.g. face, neck, hands. May start within an actinic (solar)
keratosis (b p. 624) or de novo as a nodule which progresses to ulcerate
and crust (see Figure 17.30).
Causes Chronic sun damage, X-ray exposure, chronic ulceration and
scarring (aggressive SCC may develop at the edge of chronic ulcers),
smoking pipes and cigars (lip lesions), industrial carcinogens (tars, oils),
wart virus, immunosuppression, genetic.
Management Refer urgently to dermatology. Treated with surgical
excision ± LN biopsy. Large lesions may require skin grafting. Radiotherapy
is an alternative for large lesions in elderly patients.
Bowen’s disease Intraepidermal SCC. Common—typically occurs on
the lower leg in elderly women. Lesions are flat-edged, pink/slightly pigmented scaly plaques (<5cm diameter) and may be solitary or multiple
(see Figure 17.31). Risk factor: exposure to arsenicals, chronic sun exposure, immunosuppression. Transformation to SCC is rare. Biopsy confirms
diagnosis. Treatment is with cryotherapy, curettage, excision, or topical
imiquimod/5-fluorouracil. J.T. Bowen (1857–1941)—US dermatologist.
Kaposi’s sarcoma b p. 746
Basal cell carcinoma (rodent ulcer, BCC) Most common form of
skin cancer—accounts for >75% of skin cancer in the UK. Locally invasive
but rarely metastasizes. Tends to occur in middle-aged/elderly patients,
may be multiple and appears mainly on light-exposed areas—most commonly the face. 3 major types (see Figure 17.32—all can be pigmented):
• Nodular Most common. Starts as small pearly nodule ± surface
telangiectasia. May necrose centrally leaving a small crusted ulcer with
pearly, rolled edge
• Superficial ≥1 scaly erythematous plaques with pearly edges
• Morphoeic Waxy indurated plaque resembling a scar
Dermoscopy of pigmented BCC 0 Requires specialized training:
• Absence of pigment network • Specks of brown/grey pigment
•	Multiple blue-grey globules
• Focal ulceration
• Large blue-grey ovoid nests or blotches
• Linear and arborizing (tree branch-like) telangiectasia
• Structureless or leaf-like areas towards the edge of the lesion
• Spoke wheel areas (like spokes of a wheel radiating from a central hub)
Causes Sun exposure, X-ray irradiation, chronic scarring, genetic
predisposition, arsenic ingestion
Management Complete excision is the ideal. Refer routinely—if low risk
to GPwSI working in a community skin cancer clinic; if uncertain or any
high-risk features to dermatology. High-risk features:
• Site—nose/paranasal folds, scalp/temples, lips • Size >2cm
• Immunosuppression
• Previously treated lesion
• Genetic disorder associated with BCC, e.g. Gorlin’s syndrome
Prognosis Recurrence rate is 5% at 5y for all modalities of treatment.
Development of new basal cell carcinoma at other sites is common.

Dermatology

Bacterial skin infection
Impetigo Superficial skin infection due to Staph. aureus.

Very common in childhood. A thin-walled blister ruptures
easily to leave a yellow crusted lesion. May occur anywhere
but most common on the face. Differential diagnosis: HSV,
fungal infection (e.g. ringworm). Lesions spread rapidly and are
contagious. Avoid spreading to other children—no sharing of towels,
face flannels, etc.; some schools/nurseries/childminders prohibit
attendance until lesions are cleared. Reassure that non-scarring:
• Localized Treat with topical antibiotics (e.g. fusidic acid cream)
• Widespread Treat with oral flucloxacillin or clarithromycin

Erysipelas and cellulitis Acute infection of the dermis. Often pre-

ceded by fever/‘flu-like’ symptoms. Usually affects face/lower leg. Appears
as a painful, tender reddened area with a well-defined edge. Often the area
is swollen and may blister. May be an obvious entry wound. Differential
diagnosis: angio-oedema, contact dermatitis, gout.
Management
• Severe infection Admit for IV antibiotics
• If systemically well Mark the area before starting flucloxacillin 500mg
qds or clarithromycin 500mg bd for 7–14d. Advise to seek help if
infection is spreading or becoming systemically unwell
• Facial infection Treat with penicillin V 500mg qds (flucloxacillin 500mg
qds if staphylococcal infection suspected or clarithromycin 500mg bd if
penicillin-allergic). Have a low threshold for admission
• Recurrent infections (>2 episodes at one site). May need prophylactic
long-term penicillin (e.g. penicillin V 250mg od or bd) with attention to
skin care and management of any lymphoedema

Boils and carbuncles
• Boil (furuncle) Acute infection of a hair follicle, usually with Staph.
aureus. A hard, tender, red nodule surrounding a hair follicle becomes
larger and fluctuant after several days. Occasionally associated with
fever ± malaise. Later may discharge pus and a central ‘core’ before
healing; may leave a scar. Predisposing factors: usually absent—DM; HIV;
obesity; blood dyscrasias; immunosuppressive drugs
• Carbuncle Swollen, painful area discharging pus from several points.
Occurs when a group of hair follicles become deeply infected, usually
with Staph. aureus. May be associated with fever ± malaise. Predisposing
factors: malnutrition, cardiac failure, drug addiction, severe generalized
dermatosis, prolonged steroid therapy, DM
Management
• Non-fluctuant lesions Apply moist heat to relieve discomfort, help
localize the infection, and promote drainage
• If fever or surrounding cellulitis or lesion is on the face Treat with
oral antibiotics, e.g. flucloxacillin 500mg qds for 7d—clarithromycin
500mg bd is an alternative if allergic to penicillin
• If large but localized, painful, and fluctuant Consider incision and
drainage (0 do not attempt if you are not confident). Admission may
be needed if young or uncooperative child, or the boil is in a sensitive

Bacterial skin infection

area, e.g. genital region, face, neck, axilla, breast. Afterwards treat with
oral antibiotics until inflammation resolves
• Admit If not settling with primary care treatment
• If recurrent or chronic Take swabs for culture from lesions and
carrier sites (nose, axilla, and groin); treat carrier sites with topical
antibiotic (e.g. Naseptin® qds for 10d). Advise improved hygiene and
use of antiseptics in the bath (e.g. chlorhexidine); consider long-term
antibiotics (e.g. clarithromycin 500mg od)

Folliculitis Superficial infection of the hair follicles usually caused by
Staph. aureus. Presents as pustules in hair-bearing areas, e.g. legs, beard
area. Risk factors: obesity, DM, occlusion from clothing, topical steroid use.
Differential diagnosis: pityrosporum folliculitis (b p. 611).
Management Exclude DM; treat with topical antiseptic, or if not clearing
with topical or systemic antibiotics (e.g. fusidic acid cream or oral
flucloxacillin). If recurrent or chronic: treat as for recurrent boils.

Acute paronychia Infection of the skin and soft tissue of the proximal and
lateral nail fold, most commonly caused by Staph. aureus. Often originates
from a break in the skin or cuticle as a result of minor trauma, e.g. nail biting.
Skin and soft tissue of the proximal and lateral nail fold are red, hot, and tender; nail may appear discoloured/distorted. Treat in the same way as for a boil.
Staphylococcal whitlow (felon) Infection involving the bulbous dis-

tal pulp of the finger following trauma or extension from an acute paronychia. The finger bulb is red, hot, oedematous, and usually exquisitely
tender. Onset of pain is rapid and there is swelling of the entire finger
pulp. Differential diagnosis: herpetic whitlow—b p. 635.
Management
• If fluctuant Admit for drainage and antibiotics
• If non-fluctuant Elevate, apply moist heat (e.g. soak in hot water), and
treat with oral antibiotics; if this fails, admit for incision and drainage

Wound infection Suspect if a wound becomes painful. Look for swelling, erythema, wound tenderness ± pus. Risk factors:
•	Malnutrition • Carcinomatosis • Infection near the site of incision
• Steroid therapy • Contamination of the wound
• DM
Management If pus is present send a swab for M,C&S:
• If indurated + infection is localized to the wound suspect staphylococcus.
Treat with flucloxacillin 500mg qds or clarithromycin 500mg bd
• If cellulitis around the wound suspect streptococcus. Treat with
penicillin V 500mg qds or clarithromycin 500mg bd
• If foul smell, suspect anaerobes—treat with metronidazole 400mg tds

Give adequate analgesia; dress the wound frequently; review regularly;
allow pus to drain. If a surgical wound, refer back to the operating surgeon
if simple measures are ineffective.
• Necrotizing fasciitis Life-threatening soft tissue infection. Usually
occurs in otherwise healthy individuals after surgery/trauma (often minor).
Ill-defined erythema + high fever. The wound rapidly becomes necrotic.
Admit as an emergency for IV antibiotics ± surgical debridement.

Viral skin infection
Systemic viral infections b p. 652
HIV infection b p. 746
Viral warts Common and benign. Due to infection of epidermal cells

with human papilloma virus (HPV). >50 types identified. The virus is transmitted by direct contact. Immunosuppressed patients are particularly
vulnerable.
Genital warts b p. 748
Common warts Dome-shaped papules with papilliferous surface. Usually
>1. Most common on hands but may affect other areas. In children 30–50%
disappear spontaneously in <6mo.
Plantar warts (verrucas) On soles of feet. Common in children. Pressure
makes them grow into the dermis. Often painful. Characterized by dark
punctate spots on the surface (may need to pare callus off to see). Warts
group together to form mosaics.
Plane warts Smooth, flat-topped papules often slightly brown in colour.
Most common on face/backs of hands. Usually >1. Manage as for common/
plantar warts. Eventually resolve spontaneously. May show Koebner
phenomenon.
Treatment of common, plantar, and plane warts Refer immunosuppressed
patients for specialist advice. Otherwise treatment is usually unnecessary.
If patients are insistent, advise over-the-counter topical salicylic acid
preparations, e.g. Duofilm®, Salactol®.
HPV vaccination b p. 749

Herpes simplex infection Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is transmitted

by direct contact with lesions. Lesions may appear anywhere on the skin
or mucosa but are most frequent around the mouth and on the lips,
conjunctiva, cornea, and genitalia. Diagnosis is usually clinical.
Primary HSV stomatitis After a prodromal period (<6h) of tingling,
discomfort, or itching, small tense vesicles appear on an erythematous
base. These burst to form multiple, small, painful mouth ulcers. Infection
may be accompanied by systemic symptoms, e.g. fever, malaise, and tender
lymph nodes. 0 May be asymptomatic and go unnoticed.

Management of p HSV stomatitis Give symptomatic relief—try analgesic
mouthwashes, e.g. benzydamine; healing occurs in 8–12d. If seen <48h
after onset prescribe oral antivirals, e.g. aciclovir 200mg 5x/d for 5d. If
unable to take fluids/becoming dehydrated, admit for IV fluids.
Recurrent infection (cold sores) (See Figure 17.33) After initial infection,
HSV remains dormant in the nerve ganglia. Recurrent eruptions can
occur, precipitated by overexposure to sunlight, febrile illnesses, physical
or emotional stress, or immunosuppression. The trigger stimulus is often
unknown. Recurrent disease is generally less severe and more localized.
Treat with aciclovir cream 5% 5x/d for 5d if needed (available OTC).

Viral skin infection

Molluscum contagiosum Most common in preschool
children.
• DNA pox virus infection spread by contact—including
towels. Presents as discrete pearly pink umbilicated papules,
1–3mm diameter (see Figure 17.34). If squeezed papules release a
cheesy material
• Lesions are multiple and grouped—usually on the trunk, face, or neck
• Untreated lesions resolve spontaneously after 12–18mo
• In the older child, removal by expressing the contents with forceps,
curettage or cryotherapy is possible but usually unnecessary
Orf Solitary, red, rapidly growing papule <1cm diameter—often on hand.

Evolves into a painful purple pustule (see Figure 17.35). Patients usually have
a history of close contact with sheep, e.g. vet, farmer, or cows (when termed
milker’s nodule rather than orf). Cause—parapox virus. Incubation period 76d.
Resolves spontaneously in 2–4wk. Complications include 2º infection (treat
with topical/systemic antibiotics); erythema multiforme; lymphangitis.

There are two major groups of fungal skin infections seen in the UK.
Candidiasis Uniform commensal of the mouth/GI tract which causes
opportunistic infection. Risk factors: moist, opposing skin folds; obesity; DM;
neonates; pregnancy; poor hygiene; humid environment; wet work occupation; use of broad-spectrum antibiotic. Presentation—see Table 17.9.
Dermatophyte infection Tinea denotes fungal infection. Common.
Affects skin, hair, or nails. Skin scrapings or nail clippings may confirm
diagnosis. Presentation—see Table 17.10.
General measures for prevention of fungal infections Keep
body folds separated and dry (e.g. with dusting powder) and minimize hot
and humid conditions (e.g. advise open footwear).

Topical treatment of fungal infections
• Mouth lesions Remove tongue deposits with a toothbrush by brushing
2x/d. Treat with oral suspensions or gels (e.g. nystatin, miconazole). If
false teeth advise to place imidazole gel on the teeth before insertion
and sterilize overnight with dilute hypochlorite solution (e.g. Milton®)
• Genital lesions Imidazole cream or pessaries

Fungal infection

• Nail infections If confined to the edge of 1 or 2 nails, use a lacquer or paint,
e.g. amorolfine; apply 1–2x/wk after filing/cleansing for 6mo (fingernails) or
9–12mo (toenails). Avoid nail varnish/articifial nails during treatment
• Skin lesions Imidazole cream, spray, or powder; terbinafine cream

Systemic treatment Use for resistant, recurrent, extensive, or systemic infection, and nail or scalp infection. Warn about side effects.
• Oral, mucocutaneous, or systemic candidiasis Oral fluconazole 50mg
od for 1–2wk—higher doses/prolonged therapy may be needed if
immunosuppressed (seek specialist advice)
• Genital candidiasis Single oral dose of 150–200mg fluconazole
• Tinea pedis/manuum Oral terbinafine (250mg od for 2–6wk) or
itraconazole (100mg od for 30d or 200mg bd for 7d)
• Tinea cruris/corporis Oral terbinafine (250mg od for 2–4wk for tinea
cruris and 4wk in tinea corporis) or itraconazole (100mg od for 15d or
200mg od for 7d)
• Nail infection Consider if topical treatment is unsuccessful or if the
proximal nail or >2 nails are involved. Confirm diagnosis with nail
clipping mycology before treatment with oral terbinafine (250mg od
for 6wk–3mo) or pulsed itraconazole (200mg bd for 7d, repeated after
21d, x2 for fingernail infections and x3 for toenail infections)
• Scalp infection If kerion (pustular boggy mass) is suspected, refer to derma­
tology. Otherwise, oral terbinafine (250mg od) or griseofulvin (500mg–1g
od) depending on sensitivities. • Griseofulvin may be teratogenic—advise
5 to avoid pregnancy during treatment and for 1mo afterwards and 4 to
use contraception during treatment and for 6mo afterwards

Dermatology

Infestations
Head lice Most common in children aged 4–11y (5 > 4)

but may occur in anyone. Contrary to popular belief lice infest
clean as often as dirty hair. Adult lice are about the size of a
sesame seed, brownish grey in colour and wiggle their legs
(see Figure 17.36). Only adults are contagious. Spread by close head–head
contact. Lice do not jump/fly and do not remain viable away from a host.
Symptoms/signs Normally asymptomatic. Detected by contact tracing
of other cases or routine inspection at home or school. Occasionally
present as itchy scalp. Presence of ‘nits’ (eggshells—white dots attached
to hair), eggs, or dead lice indicate past infection—a moving louse must
be found to confirm active infection.
Detection After washing hair, apply conditioner and comb with
fine-tooth detector comb (available from pharmacy). In at-risk groups
e.g. schoolchildren repeat weekly. Lice are removed by the comb and
seen trapped in its teeth.
Management Treat all household contacts simultaneously.
• Prophylactic preparations No evidence of effectiveness
• Dimeticone Lotion or spray. Coats lice and interferes with their
water balance by preventing the excretion of water. Advise to rub
into dry hair and scalp in the evening, allow to dry naturally, then
shampoo off the next morning. Repeat after 7d
• Insecticides Effective. 4 types: malathion, phenothrin, permethrin
(all available OTC, but NHS prescriptions are often sought), and
carbaryl (prescription only). Malathion and phenothrin/permethrin
are used as first-/second-line; carbaryl is reserved for third-line.
Apply according to the manufacturer’s instructions using 2
applications 7d apart. Check wet, conditioned hair with a detector
comb before the first application, then every 2d until 2–3d after the
second application. Supply enough for 2 applications. Shampoos are
ineffective—use lotions, liquids, or cream rinses
• Mechanical clearance Wet-comb conditioned hair with a fine-tooth
comb until all lice are removed and repeat at 3–4d intervals for 2wk.
Alternative to insecticides but requires motivation
• Other methods of treatment, e.g. electric combs, aromatherapy
(tea tree oil), herbal treatments—no evidence supporting use
0 If pregnant/breastfeeding, treat with wet-combing or dimeticone.
Contact tracing All cases—trace close contacts over the past month
and ask them to check their scalps for lice/treat as needed.
Reinfestation/resistance to treatment 3 possible reasons:
• Reinfestation Lice found are large adults only. Ask patient to check
close contacts again. Re-treat with a different insecticide
• Incorrect use of insecticide/mechanical clearance Lice are at mixed
stages of development. Check procedure and make sure instructions
are understood. Repeat treatment with a different insecticide
• Resistance to insecticide Lice are seen at all stages of development.
Re-treat with another product

Figure 17.36 Head lice with needle and thread to give an idea of size

Crab (pubic) lice b p. 749
Scabies Extremely contagious. The scabies mite (Sarcoptes scabei) is

70.5mm long and spread by direct physical contact. Average infection consists of 12 mites.
Presentation Symptoms of intense itching appear 4–6wk after infection.
Examination reveals burrows (irregular, tortuous, and slightly scaly, <1cm long)
on the sides of fingers, wrists, ankles, and nipples. May form rubbery nodules on
genitalia. Itching results in excoriations. Untreated infection becomes chronic.
Differential diagnosis Lichen planus; dermatitis herpetiformis; papular
urticaria; eczema.
Management Treat with scabicide, e.g. permethrin 5% or malathion
lotion. Apply according to manufacturer’s instructions. All close contacts
need treatment simultaneously, which may result in all occupants of a
residential home being treated. Apply to whole body including scalp, neck,
face, and ears. Ensure finger/toe webs are covered, and brush lotion under
the ends of finger/toenails. Reapply to whole body after 1wk and to hands
alone if washed with soap <8h after application. Advise patients to launder
all worn clothing and bedding after application. Itching may persist for
some time after elimination of infection—use chilled crotamiton lotion
and/or sedating oral antihistamines for symptomatic relief.
Complications s infection (treat with topical or systemic antibiotics).
Crusted ‘Norwegian’ scabies Affects debilitated or immunosuppressed patients
There is overwhelming infection with >10,000 mites. Typically the infestation is
not itchy but presents with a crusted skin rash often misdiagnosed as psoriasis.
Under the microscope, crusts are seen to contain hundreds of scabies mites.
Treatment is as for scabies; resistant cases can be treated with ivermectin
which is available only on a named patient basis in the UK—discuss with a
specialist dermatologist. 0 People in contact with sufferers may develop a red,
itchy rash themselves—treat with insecticide as for scabies.

Infectious disease

Immunization
Immunity can be induced in 2 ways
• Active immunity Induced using inactivated or attenuated live
organisms or their products. Acts by inducing cell-mediated immunity
and serum antibodies. Generally long-lasting
• Passive immunity Results from injection of human immunoglobulin.
The protection afforded is immediate but lasts only a few weeks

Storage of vaccines Follow manufacturers’ instructions. Do not store

vaccines in the door of a vaccine fridge and make sure there is a maximum
and minimum thermometer in the fridge. Record readings regularly and
discard vaccines if not stored at the correct temperature.

Administration of vaccines Only suitably trained GPs/nurses should give

immunizations. Check immunization is needed and the patient is fit. Check
consent has been obtained and that immunizations are the correct ones and
in date. Ensure resuscitation facilities are available. Record vaccine expiry
date/batch number. Reconstitute vaccine (if necessary) and give according
to manufacturer’s instructions. Record date and site in the medical notes.

Childhood immunization In the UK, routine vaccinations
for the under 5s are usually done in the GP surgery. Routine
vaccinations for older children are normally done through the
school health service. Schedule for childhood immunizations—see
Table 18.1.
Adult immunization
Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination Available as a Directed Enhanced
Service—existing practices do not have preferred provider status. Additional
payments are available through the Quality and Outcomes Framework for
ensuring at-risk patients receive vaccination.
Other necessary vaccinations Can be provided as an Additional Service.
Opting out incurs a 2% d in global sum. A list of eligible vaccinations and
terms of eligibility is available on the BMA website (M www.bma.org.uk).
Travel vaccinations that do not fall into these criteria can be administered
as a private service.

Contraindications to vaccination For specific contraindications to
individual vaccinations consult the Green Book. General rules:
• Acute illness Delay until fully recovered. Minor ailments without fever
or systemic upset are not reasons to postpone immunization
• Severe local reaction to previous dose Extensive area of redness/
swelling that involves much of the antero-lateral surface of the thigh or
a major part of the circumference of the upper arm
• Severe generalized reaction to a previous dose Fever ≥39.5°C <48h
after vaccination; anaphylaxis, bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema, and/
or generalized collapse; prolonged unresponsiveness; prolonged
high-pitched or inconsolable screaming for >4h; convulsions or
encephalopathy <72h after vaccination

Infectious disease

Symptoms, signs, and notification
of infectious disease
Specific symptoms and signs of infection depend on the infecting organism
and organs affected. For example, a chest infection will cause respiratory
symptoms; a urine infection, urinary tract symptoms. Symptoms suggesting
an infectious cause include:

Lymphadenopathy Palpable enlargement of the LNs.
Benign causes
• Infective Bacterial—pyogenic, TB, brucella; fungal; viral—EBV, CMV,
HIV; toxoplasmosis; syphilis
• Non-infective Sarcoid, connective tissue disease (rheumatoid arthritis);
skin disease (eczema, psoriasis); drugs (phenytoin); berylliosis
Malignant causes Lymphoma, CLL, ALL, metastases.
Management in adults Refer immediately for urgent investigationN if:
• Rapidly growing
• Non-tender, firm/hard lymph node, >3cm diameter
• Lymph nodes associated with other unexplained signs of ill health
(night sweats, weight loss, persistent fever)
• Lymph nodes associated with other sinister signs, e.g. petechial rash
(same day assessment), suspected head or neck tumour
• Enlarged supraclavicular nodes in the absence of local infection
Most enlarged lymph nodes are reactive lymph nodes—suggested by a
short history, soft tender mobile lump, and concurrent infection. If there
are no sinister features, give these 2wk to settle. If not settling, check FBC,
ESR ± EBV screen. Refer lymphadenopathy >1cm diameter persisting for
>6wk for urgent further investigation.

•
•

Management in children Refer to paediatrics urgently,
particularly if there is no evidence of local infection,
if ≥1 of:
Non-tender, firm/hard LN
LN >2cm diameter
Progressively enlarging LNs
LNs associated with other signs of ill health (e.g. fever, weight loss)
Enlarged axillary nodes in the absence of local infection or dermatitis
Supraclavicular node involvement

Investigate with FBC and blood film if generalized lymphadenopathy

Pyrexia/fever Oral temperature raised above 37.5°C. Normal range
varies according to where measured—see Table 18.2. Common causes:
Infection By far, the most common cause in general practice:
• Sinusitis
• Viral infection (e.g. HIV, • Chest infection
• Cholecystitis
EBV, URTI, influenza) • Tonsillitis
• Cellulitis
• OM
• UTI

0 Do not forget tropical diseases, e.g. malaria in patients returning from
abroad. Think of TB and SBE—especially in high-risk patients.
Cancer Lymphoma; leukaemia; solid tumours (e.g. hypernephroma).
Immunogenic causes Connective tissue disease and autoimmune disease
(e.g. RA, SLE, PAN, polymyalgia rheumatica); sarcoidosis.
Thrombosis DVT; PE
Drugs e.g. antibiotics

Fever in children under the age of 5 b p. 874
Rigors Shaking episodes (sometimes violent) associated with sudden rise

in fever.

Night sweats Consider TB, lymphoma, leukaemia, solid tumour (e.g. renal
carcinoma), menopause, anxiety states, drug causes, e.g. opioids, SSRIs.

Pyrexia of unknown origin Defined as a fever (either intermittent

or continuous) which has lasted for >3wk and for which no cause has
been found. Recheck history. Re-examine carefully. Check FBC; EBV
screen (depending on age of the patient); ESR; CRP; LFTs; amylase, urine
(M,C&S); viral titres (including HIV); blood cultures; and CXR. If cause
does not become obvious refer urgently for further investigation.

Notifiable diseasesND Notification of certain diseases is required

under the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 and Health
Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010. Notification is made to the
‘proper officer of the local authority’ on forms available from the HPA

Illness in returning travellers
• In all returned travellers who present unwell, consider imported disease
in addition to the usual differential diagnosis. Tropical medicine is a specialized field. If unsure, seek expert advice by telephone or admit the patient.

History Ask about:
• Duration of travel
• Symptoms
• Sexual contacts whilst abroad
• Malaria prophylaxis
• Immunizations prior to travel
• Areas travelled to (including
• Medical treatment abroad
brief stopovers)
• Health of members of the travel party
Examination Full examination. Particularly check for fever, jaundice,
abdominal tenderness, chest signs, rashes, lymphadenopathy.
Investigations Depend on symptoms and examination findings. Consider:
FBC, malaria testing (consult local protocols), LFTs, viral serology, blood
culture, stool culture (ensure it is fresh), MSU.
MalariaND 2,000 cases/y are notified in the UK. Easy to miss.
• Symptoms Malaria is a great mimic and can present with virtually
any symptoms. Usually consists of a prodrome of headache, malaise,
myalgia, and anorexia followed by recurring high fevers, rigors, and
drenching sweats lasting 8–12h at a time
• Examination May be normal—look for anaemia, jaundice ±
hepatosplenomegaly
• Investigation In all cases of fever in patients who have returned from a
malarial endemic area—even if the plane just landed in a malarial area en
route. Send a blood test for malaria daily for 3d. Tests include thick and
thin film, dipstick or nucleic acid testing depending on local arrangements.
• Management Admit for further investigation and treatment if:
• Malaria test +ve
• Very unwell
• Persistent fever despite –ve
• Unable to check a malaria
malaria test
test (e.g. presentation at a
weekend or out of hours)
Falciparum malaria Caused by Plasmodium falciparum. Accounts for
~½ UK cases—it may not present for up to 3mo after return from a
malarial area. Can be fatal in <24h—especially if it occurs in pregnant
women or small children (<3y). Complications: cerebral malaria (80%
deaths); hypoglycaemia; renal failure; pulmonary oedema; splenic rupture;
disseminated intravascular coagulation; death.
Benign malaria Caused by P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae. May cause
illness up to 18mo after return. All have very low mortality. Relapse may
occur at intervals after initial infection as parasites lie dormant in the liver
(P. vivax and P. ovale) or blood (P. malariae).

TyphoidND and paratyphoidND Caused by Salmonella typhi and
Salmonella paratyphi; 7200 cases/y are notified in the UK.
• Spread By the faecal–oral route.

Illness in returning travellers

• Incubation 3d–3wk
• Symptoms Usually malaise, fever, headache, cough, constipation (or
diarrhoea), nosebleeds, bruising, and/or abdominal pain
• Examination Pyrexia; relative bradycardia; rose-coloured spots on the
trunk (40%); splenomegaly; CNS signs (coma, delirium, meningism)
• Management Admit for further investigation and antibiotics
• Prognosis 10% die if untreated—<0.1% if treated; 1% become chronic
carriers after infection

Dengue fever Viral infection endemic in tropical and subtropical
regions. 7150 cases/y are notified in the UK.
• Spread By the day-biting Aedes mosquito
• Incubation 4–7d
• Symptoms/examination Usually presents with a flu-like illness, sudden
high fever ± red, maculopapular rash (appears 2–5d after the fever).
Other symptoms—fatigue, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, nausea and
vomiting, lymphadenopathy, skin hypersensitivity
• Dengue haemorrhagic fever Rare, severe form of dengue fever with
poor prognosis. Purpuric rash appears 2–3d after onset of symptoms;
minor injuries may cause bleeding; shock l death. Risk factors—
previous dengue infection, age <12y, 5, Caucasian
• Management Admit; treatment is supportive
Travellers’ diarrhoea 50% travellers experience some diarrhoea.
Most cases last 4–5d; 1–2% last >1mo. In all cases send a fresh stool
sample for M,C&S at first presentation, noting on the form areas visited.
Consider all the usual causes for diarrhoea (b p. 377) and gastroenteritis
(b p. 410). In addition consider:
CholeraND Caused by Gram –ve bacterium Vibrio cholerae.
• Spread By faecal–oral route
• Incubation Few hours–5d
• Presentation Profuse watery stool, fever, vomiting, dehydration
• Management Admit. Treatment is with rehydration ± antibiotics
Giardiasis 73,800 cases/y are notified in the UK. Flagellate protozoan.
Infection is suggested by an incubation period ≥2wk; watery stool with
flatus ++ (explosive diarrhoea); no fever. Stool microscopy may be –ve. If
suspected treat with metronidazole. Rapid response is diagnostic.
Amoebic dysenteryND 7100 cases/y are notified in the UK. May begin years
after infection. Diarrhoea begins slowly becoming profuse and bloody ±
fever ± malaise. Diagnosis is confirmed by microscopy of fresh stool. Take
specialist advice on management.

Infectious disease

Infections in immunocompromised
patients
Infections in patients whose host defence mechanisms are compromised
range from minor to fatal. They are often caused by organisms that normally reside on body surfaces.

Opportunistic infections Infections from endogenous microflora that
are non-pathogenic or from ordinarily harmless organisms. Occur if host
defence mechanisms have been altered by:
• Metabolic disorders • Immunosuppressive
• Age
or cytotoxic drugs
• Irradiation
• Infection
• Diagnostic or thera­
• Foreign bodies
• Burns
peutic instrumentation
• Corticosteroids
• Neoplasms
The precise character of the host’s altered defenses determines which
organisms are likely to be involved. These organisms are often resistant
to multiple antibiotics.

Organisms commonly involved
•
•
•
•

E. coli
CMV
Pneumocystis
Candida

• Herpes viruses
• Toxoplasmosis
• Mycobacteria

• Non-pathogenic
streptococci
• Cryptococcal
infection

Management Expert care is always required—refer promptly to the
consultant responsible for the patient.
Prophylaxis
Antibiotics Used for prevention of:
• TB and meningitis in exposed patients
• Recurrent UTIs
• Streptococcal infection in asplenic/hyposplenic patients
• Bacterial infections in granulocytopenic patients
• Pneumocystis in AIDS patients
• Watch for signs of superinfection with resistant organisms.
Active immunization See Table 18.3.
Passive immunization Can prevent or ameliorate herpes zoster (VZ-Ig),
hepatitis A and B, measles, and cytomegalovirus infection in selected
immunosuppressed patients. If a patient is in contact with any of these
diseases seek advice from the consultant looking after the patient or a
consultant in communicable disease control.
Immunoglobulin
administration
Effective for patients
hypogammaglobulinaemia. Given on a regular basis by IV infusion.

with

Asplenic patients All asplenic patients (or functionally asplenic patients,
e.g. patients with sickle cell disease) are at i risk of bacterial infection. Warn

Childhood viral infections

Management For infections listed in Table 18.4, management is

supportive with paracetamol, fluids ± antibiotics for s infection. Teething
gels may soothe mouth lesions in hand, foot, and mouth disease. Admit if
any serious complications develop.

Prevention of measles, mumps, and rubella Measles, mumps, and
rubella (MMR) vaccination consists of live attenuated measles, mumps, and
rubella viruses. Vaccine viruses are not transmitted.
• Offer MMR to all children after their first birthday and again pre-school.
Re-immunization is needed if given to children of <1y. Children with
chronic illness, e.g. CF, are at particular risk from measles and should
be immunized. Malaise, fever, and rash are common ~1wk after
immunizations and last 2–3d. Advise on fever management. There is no
link between MMR and autism or inflammatory bowel disease
• Offer children aged >18mo who have not been vaccinated (or whose
vaccination status is unclear) 2 doses of MMR vaccine ≥1mo apart; if
the child has received 1 dose of MMR, give a booster dose
• Offer MMR to women of childbearing age who are not immune to
rubella (i.e. have not had 2 doses of MMR or are seronegative)

0 There is no evidence that vaccination in pregnancy is harmful, but do
not give to women known to be pregnant and advise women who are
vaccinated to avoid pregnancy for 1mo afterwards.

Prevention of chickenpox
• Offer chickenpox (varicella) immunization (2 doses 4–8wk apart) to
non-immune healthcare workers who have direct patient contact
and susceptible close contacts of immunocompromised patients
where continuing contact is unavoidable. Consider those with a
definite history of varicella infection, immune—antibody-test others.
Vaccination is contraindicated if pregnant or immunocompromised
• Non-immune immunosuppressed patients, pregnant women, or
neonates (b p. 808) with significant exposure to chickenpox/shingles
should receive zoster immunoglobulin (VZ-Ig) <3d after contact.
Check antibody levels if immune status is unknown

Shingles Reactivation of latent chickenpox virus. Shingles cannot be
acquired by exposure to chickenpox but contacts of patients with shingles
can develop chickenpox. Infectious until all lesions have scabbed.
• Incidence 1 in 25. Any age—more common if immunocompromised
• Presentation Unilateral pain precedes a vesicular rash by 2–3 d. Crops
of vesicles appear over 3–5d and are in the distribution of ≥1 adjacent
dermatomes. The affected area is usually hyperaesthetic—pain may be
severe. Lesions scab over and fall off in <14d
• Management Treat as for chickenpox. Oral antivirals (e.g. aciclovir
800mg 5x/d) are only effective if initiated <48h after onset of the rash.
If immunocompromised admit for IV antivirals
• Prevention There is a routine shingles vaccination programme for
adults aged 70y (and 79y if not previously vaccinated) in the UK
Complications Post-herpetic neuralgia; dissemination to other areas
(immunosuppressed patients—admit for IV antivirals); eye involvement—
refer for same day assessment to ophthalmology; Ramsay Hunt syndrome
(b p. 538).

Infectious disease

Streptococcal and staphylococcal
infections
Streptococcal infection Several groups are pathogenic to man—A, B,
C, G, D, and viridans streptococci. Presentation is varied:
• Pneumonia
• Pharyngitis
• Rheumatic fever
• Tonsillitis
• Glomerulonephritis
• Wound/skin infections
• Neonatal sepsis
• Septicaemia
• Postpartum sepsis
• Scarlet fever

•
•
•
•
•

Endocarditis
Septic arthritis
Pneumonia
UTI
Dental caries

Investigation Diagnosis is usually clinical. Evidence of infection can be
gained by measuring changing antibody response (ASO titres). ASO titres
are i in ~80% infections. Swabs are +ve if infection is on the skin or in the
throat or vagina.
Treatment Most streptococci are sensitive to penicillin (e.g. penicillin V
250–500mg qds for 7–10d) although resistance is increasingly common.

Pneumococcal infection There are >85 types of S. pneumoniae.
Pneumococci are carried in the noses and throats of half the population.
In most people they are harmless. Spread is by droplet infection.

Presentations
• Meningitis
• Septic arthritis (rare)
• Pneumonia
• Endocarditis
• Peritonitis (rare)
• Acute otitis media
• Sinusitis
Treatment Amoxicillin 250–500mg tds for 7d (clarithromycin in allergic
individuals). Resistance to penicillin in the community is still low.
Childhood vaccination Routine vaccination is offered as part of the child­
hood immunization programme (b p. 645) using 13-valent pneumococcal
conjugate vaccine (PCV) given at 2mo, 4mo, and 12–13mo of age.
Vaccination of high-risk groups A single dose of pneumococcal
polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) is indicated for high-risk patients (see
Box 18.1) who have not previously been vaccinated. Special rules apply
to patients who are immunosuppressed or have deficient spleens (see
Table 18.4, b p. 651). Booster doses are not needed except for patients
with asplenia or nephrotic syndrome—when give a booster after 5–10y.

Box 18.1 High-risk patients for pneumococcal infection
Those:
• ≥65y of age
• With coeliac disease
• With a cochlear implant
• With asplenia/functional asplenia, e.g. splenectomy, sickle cell
• With immune deficiency due to disease (e.g. lymphoma, Hodgkin’s
disease, multiple myeloma, HIV) or treatment (e.g. chemotherapy,
prolonged systemic steroids)
• With chronic heart disease, lung disease (e.g. asthma, COPD), renal
disease (or nephritic syndrome), or liver disease
• With DM requiring insulin or oral hypoglycaemic drugs, and/or
• With CSF shunt/other conditions where leakage of CSF fluid can occur

Streptococcal and staphylococcal infections

Scarlet fever Group A haemolytic streptococcal infection. Incubation:
2–4d. Presents with fever, malaise, headache, tonsillitis, rash (fine punctate
erythema sparing face, ‘scarlet’ facial flushing), and strawberry tongue
(initially white turning red by third/fourth day). Treat with penicillin V 250–
500mg qds for 10d (or clarithromycin if allergic). Complications include
rheumatic fever (b p. 276) and acute glomerulonephritis.
Staphylococcal infection Usually Staph. aureus—occasionally
Staph. epidermidis. Carried in the nose of 730% of healthy adults.
Antibiotic-resistant strains are common.
Presentation
• Endocarditis
• Breast abscess/mastitis
• Wound infection
• Abscesses/furuncles/carbuncles
• Osteomyelitis/septic arthritis
• Septicaemia
• Pneumonia—especially patients with COPD, influenza, or those
receiving corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy
• Neonatal infections—usually appear <6wk after birth—pustular or
bullous skin lesions on neck, axilla, or groin
Management Antibiotics (usually flucloxacillin 250–500mg qds or
clarithromycin 250–500mg bd for 7–10d), abscess drainage where
appropriate and general supportive measures. Where possible obtain
specimens for culture before instituting or altering antibiotic regimens.
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome b p. 903
Methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA)N MRSA acts in the
same way as any other Staph. aureus—it is carried harmlessly in most but
occasionally causes a range of infections. It is only different because of its
multiple resistance to antibiotics. Often contracted in hospital.
• d tendency for multiple resistance by prudent use of antibiotics
• Wash hands thoroughly with an appropriate antibacterial preparation if
they appear soiled
• If hands appear clean, wash with an alcoholic rub between each and
every patient contact
• Follow local policies for management of patients who are known to be
infected with or carry MRSA

Toxic shock syndrome Caused by staphylococcal exotoxin.

• Risk factors Tampon use; postpartum; staphylococcal wound infection;
influenza; osteomyelitis; cellulitis
• Presentation Sudden onset of high fever, vomiting, diarrhoea,
confusion, and skin rash. May progress to shock ± death
• Management Admit as a medical emergency—mortality 8–15%

Infectious disease

Other bacterial infections
Haemophilus influenzae
Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) Vaccination against Hib is routinely
offered to all children (b p. 645) and immunocompromised patients
(b p. 651). Prior to routine vaccination, Hib infection accounted for 60% of
meningitis in children aged <5y. It was also a common cause of epiglottitis,
septicaemia, and septic arthritis/osteomyelitis. Infection is now rare.
Other types Non-encapsulated Haemophilus influenzae (ncHi) usually
causes non-invasive respiratory tract infections, e.g. OM, sinusitis. It
can cause invasive disease in neonates (<1mo of age) and those with
co-morbidities e.g. malignancy, immunosuppression, DM, chronic renal/
liver/lung disease. Other H. influenzae serotypes (Hia, Hic, Hid, Hie, Hif)
only rarely cause invasive disease.
Management Organisms are often penicillin-resistant. Use an alternative
antibiotic e.g. clarithromycin or doxycycline. If severe infection, admit.

Clostridium infections Anaerobic, spore-forming bacilli found in dust,
soil, vegetation, and GI tracts of humans and animals. 25–30 species cause
disease in humans. Presentations:
• Food poisoning—C. perfringens
• Pseudomembranous colitis—overgrowth of C. difficile following
antibiotic therapy—presents with bloody diarrhoea. Treated with
vancomycin or metronidazole if toxin is isolated from stool
• Botulism—caused by a toxin released by C. botulinum which is ingested
in contaminated food—presents with neurological symptoms and
warrants immediate admission for antitoxin
• Wound infections—C. perfringens causes cellulitis which may l gas
gangrene, septicaemia ± death—admit for IV antibiotics
• Tetanus
Tetanus (lockjaw)ND 76 cases and 1 death every year in the UK. Incubation:

2–50d. C. tetani infects contaminated wounds that may be trivial, the uterus
postpartum (maternal tetanus), or newborn umbilicus (tetanus neonatorum).
Tetanus toxin l generalized or localized tonic spasticity ± tonic convulsions.
Suspect in any patient who has not been immunized who develops muscle
stiffness/spasm several days after suffering a skin wound or burn.
Management If suspected admit for specialist care. Treatment is with
antitoxin, wound debridement, and general support. Effects may last
several weeks. Mortality—40%.
• Tetanus-prone injuries Any burn/wound sustained >6h before surgical treatment of that wound or any burn or wound that:
• Has a significant amount of dead tissue within it
• Is a puncture-type wound
• Has had contact with soil/manure likely to harbour tetanus organisms
• Is clinically infected

Other bacterial infections

Prevention Tetanus vaccine:
• Primary immunization 3 doses of vaccine each 1mo apart. If the
schedule is disrupted the course should be resumed from where it was
stopped as soon as possible
• Booster doses in children One dose >3y after the 1o course of
immunization (pre-school) and another 10y later
• Booster doses in adults 10y after the primary course and again 10y
later. Probably gives life-long protection. If an adult has received >5
doses in total further routine boosters are not recommended
• Open wounds b p. 1107

DiphtheriaND Caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. Rare in the UK
since routine immunization. Spread by droplet infection or contact with
articles soiled by an infected person. Incubation: 2–5d.
Presentation In countries where hygiene is poor cutaneous diphtheria
is the predominant form. Elsewhere, characterized by an inflammatory
exudate which forms a greyish membrane in the respiratory tract (may
cause respiratory obstruction). C. diphtheriae secretes a toxin which
affects myocardium, nervous and adrenal tissues.
Management Admit for antitoxin and IV antibiotics. Patients may be
infectious for up to 4wk but carriers shed C. diphtheriae for longer.
Prevention Vaccination—given routinely in childhood in the UK (b p. 645).
In addition give booster dose to people in contact with a patient with
diphtheria or carrier, or before travel to epidemic or endemic areas.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa Common. Treatment is difficult due to
multiple antibiotic resistance—if suspected, send specimen for M,C&S.
• In immunocompetent patients may cause UTI, wound infections
(particularly leg ulcers—gives a characteristic greenish colouring),
osteomyelitis, and skin infections (e.g. otitis externa)
• In immunocompromised patients and patients with CF, it is a common
cause of pneumonia and septicaemia

Enterobacteria Examples include:

• Morganella
• Klebsiella
• Salmonella
• Providencia
• Enterobacter
• Shigella
•	Yersinia
• Proteus
• Escherichia
Some are normal gut commensals. Others are pathogenic causing:
• Diarrhoea and intra-abdominal infections e.g. peritonitis, hepatobiliary
• UTI—often E. coli; Proteus species are associated with bladder stones
• Septicaemia and/or meningitis—E. coli is the most common cause of
meningitis in neonates
• Chest infection—Klebsiella may cause a severe form of pneumonia
• Endocarditis—rare
Organisms are usually sensitive to trimethoprim. Severe infection requires
admission to hospital for IV antibiotics.

Haematology and immunology

Full blood count and ESR
The most commonly requested blood test is the full blood count (FBC).
It gives information on:
• Red blood cells Haemoglobin, mean cell volume (MCV), and packed
cell volume (haematocrit)
• White blood cells White cell count and proportion of each component—
neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils
• Platelets Number of platelets
0 Reference ranges are a guide only; normal values are affected by ethnicity, age, and pregnancy. For mild abnormalities in well individuals, take
laboratory advice to avoid over-investigation/referral.

Red blood cells
Mean cell volume (MCV)
• d MCV (microcytic; <80fL). Iron deficiency anaemia. Confirm by
showing that serum ferritin is d. Rarer causes: thalassaemia (suspect
if MCV is ‘too low’ for the level of anaemia); congenital sideroblastic
anaemia (very rare)
• i MCV (macrocytic; >100fL). Vitamin B12/folate deficiency; alcohol;
liver disease; drugs (e.g. azathioprine, chemotherapy); haemolysis;
pregnancy; hypothyroidism; marrow infiltration; myelodysplasia

Anaemia: diagnosis and initial
investigation
Anaemia Anaemia is a lack of sufficient red blood cells and thus haemoglobin (4: Hb <13g/dL; 5: Hb <12g/dL or <11g/dL first trimester and
<10.5g/dL second/third trimester of pregnancy). It results if there is:
• d red cell production Defective precursor proliferation/maturation
• i loss or rate of destruction Bleeding or haemolysis
• d tissue requirement for oxygen In practice—hypothyroidism
Presentation Patients who become anaemic slowly may remain
asymptomatic for a long time. As anaemia progresses pallor, exertional
dyspnoea, tachycardia, palpitations, angina (especially if past history of
coronary artery disease), night cramps, and cardiac bruits appear. Ultimately
with severe anaemia high-output cardiac failure may develop.
0 Pallor may indicate anaemia but is a very non-specific sign which may
also be racial, familial, or cosmetic. Other causes of pallor: shock, Stokes–
Adams attack, vasovagal faint, myxoedema, hypopituitarism, albinism.
Initial investigation of anaemia See Table 19.2.
Management Treat the cause—if no cause for anaemia is found, refer
for specialist investigation.

Anaemia: diagnosis and initial investigation

Vitamin B12 deficiency Vitamin B12 is found in liver, kidney,

fish, chicken, meats, and dairy products. Absorption takes place by active
and passive mechanisms—the latter being dependent on intrinsic factor, a
protein produced by gastric parietal cells.
Presentation Incidental finding of macrocytosis; symptoms/signs of
anaemia; sore mouth (glossitis, mouth ulcers); neuropsychiatric problems
(peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, optic atrophy, memory loss, subacute
combined degeneration of the cord, rarely psychosis).
0 B12 levels may correlate poorly with deficiency, especially in pregnancy.
Causes of deficiency
• Inadequate dietary intake—e.g. vegans
• Malabsorption—GI disease/surgery: gastric (e.g. pernicious anaemia;
gastrectomy), pancreatic (e.g. chronic pancreatitis), or ileal (e.g. coeliac
disease—b p. 412; ileal resection)
• Drugs—metformin; drugs causing achlorhydria, e.g. PPIs, H2 antagonists
Pernicious anaemia Autoimmune condition associated with gastric
atrophy and intrinsic factor (50%)/gastric parietal cell (85%) antibodies.
Risk factors: FH, other autoimmune disease (e.g. vitiligo, hypothyroidism),
premature greying, blood groups A and HLA3. Patients have i risk of
stomach cancer, particularly within the first 2y of diagnosis.
Management Treat with vitamin B12 parenterally (hydroxocobalamin
IM—initially 1mg 3x/wk for 2wk then every 2–3mo). Consider oral B12
supplements if dietary deficiency is the cause. Confirm response by
repeating FBC after 8wk. Consider referral to exclude underlying GI cause.
Folate deficiency Folate is found in highest concentrations in liver and
yeast but is also in spinach, other green vegetables, and nuts.
Presentation Incidental finding of macrocytosis or presents with
symptoms and signs of anaemia ± polyneuropathy or dementia. Always
check serum B12 as deficiencies may coexist.
Causes of deficiency
• Inadequate dietary intake Common—e.g. old age, poor social
conditions, malignancy, anorexia, excess alcohol (particularly spirits)
• Malabsorption Coeliac disease, Crohn’s disease, partial gastrectomy,
tropical sprue, lymphoma, diabetic enteropathy
• Excess use Pregnancy, lactation, prematurity, i cell turnover (e.g.
malignancy, haemolysis)
• Drugs Anticonvulsants, trimethoprim
Management In all cases, treat the cause. Supplement folate with folic
acid 5mg od for 4mo. If malabsorption, may need i dose to 15mg od.
Treat any B12 deficiency. For prophylaxis in chronic haemolytic states or
for renal dialysis, up to 5mg od long-term is used (take specialist advice).

• Folate supplements in pregnancy Advise women to take supplements from planning pregnancy to 12wk gestation to prevent neural
tube defect. Dose: to prevent first occurrence—400 micrograms od;
advise 5mg od to prevent recurrence, if maternal/paternal history or
family history of neural tube defect, or if the mother has coeliac disease,
DM, BMI >30, or is taking anticonvulsants.

are microcytic (d MCV) and hypochromic. Low serum ferritin and/or low
transferrin saturation confirms iron deficiency. Exclude haemoglobino­
pathy (b p. 668) in those from at-risk ethnic groups or with FH.

Causes 0 More than one cause may be present.
• GI blood loss Aspirin/NSAID use (10–15%); colonic carcinoma
(5–10%); gastric carcinoma (5%); benign gastric ulceration (5%);
angiodysplasia (5%); oesophagitis (5%); oesophageal carcinoma (1–2%)
• Malabsorption Coeliac disease (4–6%)—may be the presenting
feature; post-gastrectomy; H. pylori colonization; gut resection
• Non-GI blood loss Menstruation (20–30%); blood donation (5%);
haematuria (1%); epistaxis
• Other Pregnancy; lactation; premature infants; deficient diet

Management

• Investigate as shown in Figure 19.1; treat the underlying cause where
possible
• Give oral iron supplements, e.g. ferrous sulfate 200mg bd—iron may
cause constipation and turn stools black. If not tolerated, try a lower
dose or alternative preparation, e.g. ferrous fumarate. Ascorbic acid
(250–500mg bd with the iron) may enhance iron absorption
• Hb should i by 1g/dL/wk—confirm response to treatment 2–3wk
after starting. Continue treatment for 3mo after correction of the iron
deficiency to allow replenishment of the iron stores
• Asymptomatic colonic and gastric carcinoma may present with iron
deficiency anaemia—seeking and excluding these conditions is a priority.
• Refer urgently for gastroscopy/specialist opinion if dyspepsia and iron
deficiency anaemiaN
• Refer urgently for suspected lower GI cancer if Hb <11g/dL in a man
or <10g/dL in non-menstruating womanN
Failure to respond to iron supplements Consider H. pylori (test/
treat), coeliac disease (oral iron not absorbed), continuing bleeding,
non-compliance with iron, or that diagnosis is incorrect or anaemia mixed.
Follow-up Once normal, monitor Hb, MCH, and MCV every 3mo for 1y,
and then annually. Give further iron supplements if Hb, MCH, or MCV fall
below normal levels. Investigate further if unable to maintain Hb.
Iron deficiency without anaemia Low serum ferritin (hypoferriti­n­
aemia) is 3x as common as iron deficiency anaemia but there is a very low
prevalence of GI malignancy in this group (<1% of post-menopausal women
and men). Investigate as shown in Figure 19.1. Give iron supplements to
replenish iron stores.

Other anaemias
Anaemia of chronic disease (anaemia of inflammation)

Inflammatory cytokines suppress bone marrow erythropoiesis. Usually
normocytic anaemia but can be microcytic if severe. Consider:
• Leg ulcers
• Old age
• DM
• Cancer
• Multi-co-morbidities.
• Low eGFR contributes via low erythropoietin
Management
• Aim to exclude significant disorders, e.g. haematological malignancy.
Suitable tests include iron (d), transferrin (d), ferritin (normal or i),
LDH, serum electrophoresis, eGFR, glucose, LFTs
• Optimize management of co-morbidities
0 Ageing is pro-inflammatory process—50% of anaemia of the elderly is
unexplained after investigation.

Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Common clonal,
pre-leukaemia disorder affecting 1:500 >65y. Very variable
severity from mild anaemia for many years to severe
pancytopenia progressing to acute leukaemia within
months. 0 Isolated macrocytosis can precede anaemia for
many years.
Causes Previous chemotherapy, chemical exposure, age.
Presentation Anaemia (usually macrocytic), neutropenia, thrombocy­
topenia, monocytosis, pancytopenia, infection, and/or bleeding. No
splenomegaly or lymphadenopathy except in chronic myelomonocytic
leukaemia (CMML).
Management Principally supportive—blood transfusion, erythropoietin,
treat infections. Chemotherapy, e.g. azacitidine, is approved for high-risk
MDS. Bone marrow transplant can be curative in young fit patients;
most patients are elderly.
Prognosis Depends on cytopenias, bone marrow cytogenetics, and
bone marrow blast count.
B12 and folate deficiency b p. 663
Haemoglobinopathy b p. 668
Haemolysis Normal red cells survive 120d before being removed from

the circulation—mainly by the spleen. In haemolytic anaemia red cells are
destroyed faster than they are produced and anaemia develops.
Presentation May have FH. Anaemia often accompanied by jaundice
due to bilirubin released when the red cells are destroyed. FBC: d Hb;
i reticulocytes. Film shows polychromasia ± abnormal-shaped cells
(e.g. spherocytes) or other clues as to the cause of the haemolysis (e.g.
fragmented cells suggest mechanical damage). Can be exacerbated by
intercurrent illness, e.g. aplastic crisis with parvovirus.

Other anaemias

Causes See Table 19.3.
Management Refer to haematology for advice on management or if the
cause is unclear. Folate supplements are usually recommended. Rarely
splenectomy is needed.
Aplastic anaemiaG Bone marrow failure characterized by pancyto­
penia. Rare affecting 1–2/million population. No cause is found in 70–80%.
Identified causes include: genetic; drugs (inform Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency—b p. 146); toxins; infection.
Presentation Anaemia, thrombocytopenia (b p. 670), and neutropenia
(recurrent infection). FBC reveals pancytopenia and lack of reticulocytes.
Management Refer urgently to haematology. Treatment is:
• Supportive Transfusions and antibiotics, or
• Definitive Aims to restore a healthy, working bone marrow. Bone
marrow transplant is curative. Immunosuppressive therapy is an
alternative when transplant is not an option

Haemoglobinopathy
Screening
• Pre-conceptual screening Consider in at risk-groups and when
investigating or treating infertility
• Antenatal haemoglobinopathy screening (b p. 800) Offered to all
pregnant women in the UK, ideally at <10wk gestation. If the mother is
a carrier, the father is offered testing ± the fetus
• Neonatal blood spot screening (b p. 851) for sickle cell disease;
offered to all babies in England, Scotland, and Northern Ireland
0 Screening results in people knowing their carrier status. Ensure results
are clearly recorded in patient notes. Issue haemoglobinopathy cards to
those with haemoglobinopathy and who are confirmed carriers.

Thalassaemia Autosomal recessive inherited disorder of production
of α (α-thalassaemia) or β (β-thalassaemia) globin chains of haemo­globin.
Many varieties are recognized, but they can classified into 2 main types:
• α° and β° thalassaemia: no gene product is produced
• α+ and β+ thalassaemia: α and β chains present but produced at d rate
β-thalassaemia Common in populations from the Mediterranean; Middle
East; Central, South, and South East Asia. Defective β chain production
results in iα chain synthesis. Excess α chains precipitate in red cell
precursors causing their destruction in bone marrow and spleen. This
causes proliferation of marrow, bony deformity (mongoloid facies, bossing
of skull, thinning of long bones), and progressive splenomegaly.
Homozygotes develop profound anaemia from 3mo of age and without
repeated transfusions would die in <1y. If suspected refer urgently to paediatrics. 0 Most infants with β° thalassaemia (β-thalassaemia major) are
detected at neonatal blood-spot screening.
Specialist ongoing care is essential. Offer family members referral for
genetic counselling. Children who receive transfusions grow and develop
normally, but iron accumulates; chelation i survival, but iron overload
may cause premature death. Bone marrow transplant is curative.
α-thalassaemia Common in populations from South East Asia, Africa,
and India.
• The homozygous state for α° thalassaemia is associated with fetal
death at 738wk (Barts hydrops)
• Haemoglobin H results from inheritance of α° from one parent and α+
from the other; patients are moderately anaemic with splenomegaly
and have haemoglobin H (4 β chains combined with a haem molecule)
in their red cells. Specialist management is needed
Asymptomatic patients Heterozygotes for α- or β-thalassaemia
(thalassaemia trait) and homozygotes for α+ thalassaemia are often
asymptomatic. They may have mild anaemia with hypochromic/microcytic
red cells. 0 Can be confused with iron deficiency—suspect if MCV is
disproportionately low; ferritin is normal; no response to iron.

Haemoglobinopathy

The sickling disorders Inherited disorder most common amongst

people originating from malarial areas—Africans (1–2% newborns) and
certain Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian populations. Varieties:
• Heterozygous state for haemoglobin S (sickle cell trait—AS)
• Homozygous state (sickle cell anaemia/disease—SS)
• Heterozygous states for haemoglobin S and haemoglobins C, D, E, or
other structural variants
• Combination of haemoglobin S with any form of thalassaemia
Mechanism Haemoglobin S undergoes liquid crystal formation, as it
becomes deoxygenated, causing sickling of affected blood cells. The effect
of sickling is to shorten survival of red cells l haemolytic anaemia, and
cause aggregation of the sickled cells, which, in turn, leads to:
• Tissue infarction—resulting in pain and/or tissue damage, e.g. stroke
(10% children with sickle cell anaemia have a stroke; 5% have recurrent
strokes), and/or
• Sequestration in the liver, spleen, or lungs—producing sudden and
profound anaemia
Diagnosis FBC and film—chronic anaemia with sickling on film. Confirm
diagnosis with haemoglobin electrophoresis.
Sickle cell trait Patients with <40% haemoglobin S have no symptoms,
unless they are subjected to anoxia, e.g. anaesthesia.
Sickle cell anaemia Low Hb level (typically 8–9g/dL) with high reticulocyte
count—although generally patients compensate well. Illness results from
complications arising from acute exacerbations or ‘crises’ and the effects
of recurrent tissue damage due to microinfarction over a long period of
time. Prognosis is variable. In Africa, children usually die in <1y. In the UK,
patients survive into adulthood (average survival 50y). The most common
cause of death is infection.
Patients should be managed by specialist centres, aiming to prevent crises
and treat complications early. There is no medication to prevent sickling.
GPs should:
• Treat patients as if hyposplenic—give Hib, meningitis C, pneumococcal
+ annual influenza vaccination ± prophylactic antibiotics (b p. 650)
• Advise patients to avoid cold and maintain adequate hydration; warn
about the dangers of anaesthetics (a Medic Alert bracelet is helpful)
• Treat infection early—be alert for aplastic crisis following parvovirus
• Give analgesia for painful crises (including opioids if needed, but avoid
pethidine as may cause cerebral irritation/fits)—admit if severe
• Admit if significant crisis of any sort (e.g. stroke, dyspnoea, acute
abdomen, aplastic anaemia)
• Refer for early management of long-term complications (e.g. renal
failure, epilepsy)

Bleeding and clotting disorders
Coagulation tests (sodium citrate tube; false results if under-filled)
• Prothrombin time (PT) Prolonged by: coumarins (e.g. warfarin);
vitamin K deficiency; liver disease
• Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) i in heparin
treatment, haemophilia, antiphospholipid syndrome, or DIC
• INR Ratio of the time the sample takes to clot compared to a control
The pupuras
Vascular purpuras Result from damage to the vessel wall. Due to:
• Ageing (senile purpura)
• Infection (e.g. meningococcal
• Local stasis or i venous pressure
septicaemia, EBV)
(e.g. varicose veins)
• Immune dysfunction (e.g.
• Drug reaction (e.g.
Henoch–Schönlein purpura)
steroid-induced purpura)
• Vitamin C deficiency
Thrombocytopenic purpura Purpura is related to the level of the platelet
count. Bleeding is inevitable if platelet count d to <5–10 x 109/L.
• Non-immune thrombocytopenic purpura Results from conditions
that damage the bone marrow, e.g. drugs (chemotherapy), aplastic
anaemia (b p. 667), leukaemia (b p. 676), myeloproliferative
disorders (b p. 678), CLL (b p. 678), multiple myeloma (b p. 674)
• Immune thrombocytopenic purpura Usually primary immune (ITP) but
may be secondary to SLE, transfusions, or drug reactions (e.g. heparin)
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
• In children Self-limiting. The child is purpuric often after a viral illness;
platelet count is generally <10 x 109/L, but severe bleeding is rare. Refer
to paediatrics as an emergency. Usually no specific treatment is needed
• In adults Presentation is variable—may be acutely symptomatic (sometimes
recurrent), or chronic and insidious. Presents with haemorrhage and
bruising. Platelet count is d. Ask about drug history (particularly thiazides,
quinine, or digoxin). Look for evidence of SLE or lymphoma. Examine for
presence of an enlarged spleen. Refer to haematology
Impaired platelet function May occur with myeloproliferative disorder/
myelodysplasia and very high paraproteins. Causes bleeding—even if
platelet count is normal.

Haemophilia 2 common forms—haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency)
and B (factor IX deficiency—Christmas disease). Sex-linked recessive
disorders but 1 in 3 result from a new mutation. 4 >> 5. Prevalence: 1/10,000
(haemophilia A); 1/50,000 (haemophilia B). Classification:
• Carrier: 5 heterozygotes; >25% clotting factor activity
• Mild: 5–25% clotting factor activity
• Moderate: 1–5% clotting factor activity
• Severe: 50% haemophiliacs; ≤1% clotting factor activity
Features Bleeding into joints or muscles is often delayed following
trauma. If untreated, can cause permanent damage. Pressure effects
occur if bleeding takes place into a confined space, e.g. intracranial bleed.
Severity of bleeding is related to levels of clotting factors.

Bleeding and clotting disorders

Management Follow-up should be via a specialist haemophilia centre.
Pre-natal/antenatal screening is available—refer to genetics.
• On-demand treatment Transfusion of factor VIII or IX preparation
as soon as possible after bleeding has started—most administer it to
themselves; symptomatic treatment of bleeds, e.g. rest, analgesia ±
physiotherapy for bleeds into muscles/joints
• Prophylaxis Prevents bleeds and their consequences. Agents used:
• Tranexamic acid—prevents bleeding after minor surgical procedures
for patients with mild haemophilia/carriers with symptoms
• Desmopressin—stimulates production of factor VIII (not factor IX).
Prevents/treats bleeding in mild/moderate haemophilia A
• Factor VIII 3x/wk or factor IX 2x/wk. Given to prevent joint damage
in children with severe haemophilia
Problems with treatment
• Inhibitors 25% of patients have antibodies to factor VIII or IX
products. Treated with intravenous factor VIIa or, in children, through
an immune tolerization programme
• Infection from blood products Not a risk with modern ‘recombinant’
products—historically blood products have resulted in HIV, hepatitis B
and C transmission. All patients should have hepatitis B vaccination

von Willebrand’s disease Autosomal dominant deficiency of vW

factor. 4 = 5. Prevalence: 1% population. Most are mildly affected with
easy bruising, nose bleeds, and/or menorrhagia. In severe cases bleeding
may occur into joints. FBC—normal platelets; clotting screen—i bleeding
time. Refer to haematology. Mild cases are managed with tranexamic acid,
desmopressin, and/or OCP/Mirena® (for menorrhagia). In severe cases
may need treatment with vW factor. E.A. von Willebrand (1870–1939)—
Finnish physician.

ThrombophiliaG i tendency to clot. May be acquired or inherited.
Acquired s to obesity, immobility, pregnancy, OCP, cancer, surgery
(<6wk), smoking, antiphospholipid syndrome (0 Patients <40y with
unprovoked proximal DVT/PE or <50y with ischaemic stroke should
be tested for antiphospholipid antibodies). Treat the cause if possible;
otherwise discuss thromboprophylaxis with the relevant specialist.
Inherited Defects in natural anticoagulants (e.g. protein S) and clotting
factors (e.g. factor V Leiden). Screening in high-risk individuals (e.g. after
DVT, asymptomatic relatives) does not predict thromboembolism. Refer/
discuss management with haematology if:
• Strong FH of unprovoked
• Neonate/child with purpura
venous thrombosis (or, for 5,
fulminans (urgent testing)
oestrogen-provoked thrombosis)
• FH of ‘high-risk thrombophilia’
• Adults that develop skin necrosis
(protein C or S deficiency;
on vitamin K antagonists
antithrombin deficiency)

Anticoagulation
Indications for anticoagulation
Long term
• Prevention of recurrent VTE (including antiphospholipid syndrome and
some patients with thrombophilia)
• Prevention of arterial thromboembolism in patients with cardiac
disease, e.g. non-valvular AF and medium/high stroke risk; mechanical
prosthetic valves; dilated cardiomyopathy
Short term
• VTE: ≥6wk after below-knee DVT; ≥3mo after proximal DVT/PE
• High-risk situations, e.g. mural thrombosis after MI; after surgery
Heparin Enhances antithrombin III activity. Sc low molecular weight
heparin (LMWH) is used in the community, as it does not require daily
monitoring. Indications:
• Initial treatment of VTE (whilst awaiting diagnostic testing and/or until
oral anticoagulation is established)
• VTE management for cancer patients and pregnant women at high risk
• When warfarin is stopped prior to surgery
• High-risk patients on oral anticoagulants if INR is < desired range

Warfarin Antagonizes vitamin K to d clotting tendency. Its effects can
be reversed with vitamin K/prothrombin complex. Target INR:
• Most indications: 2.5 (range 2–3)
• Thromboembolism on anticoagulant treatment: 3.5 (range 3–4)
• Prosthetic heart valves: take specialist advice
Initiation of warfarin If no urgency for initiation (e.g. chronic AF), warfarin
can be started in primary care (see Table 19.4). Check baseline FBC,
clotting screen, renal and liver function. Complete a DH anticoagulant
booklet for the patient to carry. Take the patient/carer through the
educational points in the booklet. Ensure they understand the local
monitoring system. Advise to take warfarin every evening.
Warfarin + antiplatelet therapy Except <12mo after stenting/ACS,
antiplatelet agents are usually stopped if initiating warfarin. Avoid combining
except on specialist advice (i risk of bleeding—clopidogrel > aspirin).
Monitoring See Table 19.5. After starting a new drug that may interact
with warfarin, recheck INR after 5–7d.
Bleeding on warfarin
• Major bleeding—admit
• Head injury—if laceration, bruising, LOC, amnesia, persistent
headache, or d GCS—refer to A&E for CT scan
• Bleeding at therapeutic INR (e.g. haematuria, rectal bleeding)—
investigate cause
New oral anticoagulants (e.g. dabigatran, rivaroxaban) are licensed to
prevent VTE after orthopaedic surgery and for stroke prevention in patients
with non-valvular AF. They have the advantage of having a fixed dose and
do not require regular monitoring. However, they are not readily reversible
in the community leading to concerns about bleeding.

Haematology and immunology

Haematological malignancy
• Suspected haematological malignancy May present with
non-specific symptoms/signs. Have a high level of suspicion.
Immediate admission/ same-day referral
• FBC/blood film reported as acute leukaemia
• Suspected spinal cord compression
• Suspected renal failure due to myeloma
Urgent referral to a team specializing in blood cancers Persistent,
unexplained splenomegaly.
Investigations Combinations of any of the following symptoms/signs warrant
examination and further investigation with FBC, blood film, and ESR (or CRP/
plasma viscosity) ± referral to a team specializing in haematological malignancy:
• Drenching night sweats and/or fever
• Weight loss
• Generalized itching—in addition check U&E, Cr, eGFR, TFTs
• Breathlessness—in addition check CXR
•	Unexplained bleeding/bruising/purpura, and/or symptoms suggesting
anaemia
• Recurrent infections
• Persistent bone pain—in addition check X-ray, U&E, Cr and eGFR,
liver profile, bone profile, and PSA (in men)
• Alcohol-induced pain
• Abdominal pain
• Splenomegaly—refer if persistent
• Fatigue—repeat FBC, blood film, and ESR at least once if condition
remains unexplained and does not improve
• Lymphadenopathy—if present ≥6wk, LNs are increasing in size, LN
>2cm in size, widespread lymphadenopathy or associated weight d,
night sweats, and/or splenomegaly, consider further investigation,
discussion with specialist, and/or referral

Multiple myeloma Age usually >60y. 4,800 new cases/y in the UK and
2,600 deaths. A mutant plasma cell clone is present. The proliferating
cells grow mainly in the bone marrow where they cause infiltration,
localized tumours, and bone erosion. Main sites of myeloma involvement
are: skull, spinal column, thoracic cage, pelvis, and proximal long bones.
Presentation
• Infection, e.g. chest infection
• Anaemia and/or bleeding
• Bone pain ± tenderness—
particularly ribs, back, pelvis
• Pathological fracture
• Hypercalcaemia

• Renal failure
• Hyperviscosity syndrome (CNS
features, e.g. blurred vision,
altered consciousness, confusion)
• Amyloidosis (heart, tongue,
carpal tunnel)

Investigation
• FBC Anaemia; blood film—rouleaux formation
• ESRii

• X-ray Erosive lesions in skull, ribs, pelvis. Fractures and vertebral
collapse are common
Management Refer urgently to haematology. Specialist management
depends on symptoms and whether there is tissue/organ damage.
• Asymptomatic disease Patients are usually monitored closely and
treatment starts if symptoms or tissue/organ damage develop
• Symptomatic disease Treatment options include chemotherapy, steroids,
biological agents (bortezomib), and/or novel agents (thalidomide,
lenalidomide). Symptomatic treatment includes: thromboprophylaxis;
bisphosphonates for prevention and treatment of hypercalcaemia and
bone pain (bone pain may also respond to radiotherapy); dialysis for renal
failure; and plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity. Intensive chemotherapy
+ bone marrow/stem cell transplant is offered to younger patients.
Maintenance therapy is under evaluation
• Relapsed disease Patients who have gone into remission almost always
relapse at some point. Novel/biological agents are frequently used in
the treatment of relapse
Prognosis Survival is improving and ranges from weeks to many years;
overall 5y survival is 37% but if <70y and fit enough to undergo intensive
treatment, 5y survival is >50%.

Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance
(MGUS) Presence of monoclonal paraprotein band (M protein) in isola-

tion, with no other features of myeloma or other lymphoproliferative disease.
Present in 1% >50y and 5% if >80y. Usually found incidentally. Most remain
stable but 71%/y progress to myeloma or other haematological malignancy.
Management
• Exclude myeloma, other lymphoproliferative disorders, and amyloidosis;
refer urgently if haematological malignancy/amyloidosis is suspected
• Refer to haematology if IgD or IgE M-protein, >15g/L IgG M-protein,
or >10g/L ImA or IgM M-protein
• Monitor clinical symptoms, and check M-protein (i >25% should
prompt re-referral), immunoglobulins, FBC, ESR, U&E, Cr, and eGFR
every 3–4mo for the first year then every 6–12mo; re-refer if any
significant, sustained change
• Advise patients to re-attend promptly if new symptoms (e.g. back pain,
fatigue, weight d) develop

Haematology and immunology

Acute leukaemia
Clonal malignant disorders (from a single cell) affecting all age groups.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) Abnormal proliferation in
the lymphoid progenitor cells (see Figure 19.2). Incidence is 1–4/100,000
population/y. 4 > 5. Usual age range: 2–10y, with a peak at 3–4y. Accounts
for 85% of childhood leukaemia. Incidence then falls with increasing age
apart from a secondary peak at ~40y.

Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) Abnormal proliferation of
a myeloid progenitor cell (see Figure 19.2). There are at least seven
different subtypes. Most common leukaemia of adulthood with incidence
of 71.5/100,000 population/y. Incidence i with age. Median age at
presentation 760y. 4 = 5. Risk factors include smoking (1:5 cases); previous
chemotherapy or radiotherapy and exposure to radiation. Children with
Down’s syndrome are more likely to develop AML.
Presentation Short history (weeks). Symptoms/signs arise from:
Bone marrow failure Anaemia—pallor, lethargy, dyspnoea; neutropenia—
infections of the mouth, throat, skin, fever; thrombocytopenia—spontaneous
bruising, menorrhagia, bleeding from wounds, bleeding of gums or nosebleeds.
Organ infiltration Superficial lymphadenopathy (>50%); hepatospleno­
megaly (70%); bone pain (ALL only); skin infiltration (AML only);
testicular enlargement; respiratory symptoms s to mediastinal LNs; gum
hypertrophy; unexplained irritability/behaviour change/d performance.

Differential diagnosis Infections, e.g. EBV; other blood conditions, e.g.
aplastic anaemia, ITP, myelodysplasia; other malignancies, e.g. lymphoma,
neuroblastoma, metastatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis.
Investigation
•
•
•
•

FBC Normal or d Hb and platelets; WCC <1 x 109/L to >200 x 109/L
Blood film Abnormal with presence of blast cells
Renal function Renal impairment if leucocyte count is very high
CXR May show mediastinal mass and/or lytic bone lesions

Initial management Refer for same-day specialist opinion if:
• Abnormal blood count reported as needing urgent investigation
• Petechiae/purpura/spontaneous bleeding
• Fatigue in a previously healthy individual if accompanied by generalized
lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly*
• Any other suspicious symptoms/signs
* Children with an abdominal mass should always be referred for sameday assessment.

Specialist management Once diagnosis is confirmed, treatment is
co-ordinated in specialized centres and involves intensive supportive care,
together with systemic chemotherapy and radiotherapy ± bone marrow
transplant. For patients with ALL, treatment includes maintenance therapy for
2y to help maintain remission. Prognosis—see Table 19.6.

Short-term side effects of treatment
• Treatment side effects Most chemotherapeutic agents have
pronounced side effects, e.g. nausea, vomiting, hair loss, neuropathy
• Immunosuppression Any fever in a neutropenic child or adult must be
taken seriously and referred immediately back to the unit in charge of
care. Likewise any chickenpox contact must be referred immediately
for consideration of administration of VZ-Ig, or measles contact for
administration of measles Ig
Long-term side effects of treatment Heart—cardiomyopathy, arrhythmias;
lung—fibrosis; endocrine system—growth delay, hypothyroidism,
infertility; kidney—d eGFR ; secondary malignancies—may appear after
many years; psychological effects.

Haematology and immunology

Chronic leukaemia and myeloproliferation
Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) Occurs in the elderly,
accounting for 40% leukaemias in that age group. Closely related to
small lymphocytic lymphoma (b p. 681). 70–80% all diagnoses follow
FBC done for another reason. Otherwise, presents with widespread
painless lymphadenopathy, often noted over a period of months/years.
Examination: check for lymphadenopathy, spleno- ± hepatomegaly.
Investigation i lymphocyte count (>5 x 109/L). Blood film—small
lymphocytes, many of which are disrupted to form ‘smear’ cells.
Management Refer to haematology or discuss with a haematologist
depending on age and clinical state of the patient. Once diagnosis has
been confirmed, well patients with low levels of lymphocytosis are often
managed in primary care with regular FBC and clinical review (at least
every 6mo). Treat infections promptly. Refer for treatment if:
• Symptomatic disease (fevers, sweats, weight d)
• Lymphadenopathy and/or hepatosplenomegaly
• Rising lymphocyte count (i >50% in 2mo or doubling time of <6mo)
• Anaemia or thrombocytopenia
Specialist treatment Chemotherapy/radiotherapy. Splenectomy is indica­
ted if massive symptomatic splenomegaly and refractory cytopenia.
0 The term ‘leukaemia’ provokes fear in many. Explain the diagnosis of
CLL, its benign nature in many and that prognosis can be >10y.

Chronic myeloid (granulocytic) leukaemia (CML) Peak age:

30–60y. Chance finding in 20%. Otherwise presents with:
• Non-specific symptoms, e.g. weight d, lassitude, gout, anaemia
• Splenomegaly (common)—abdominal pain, digestive symptoms, or
pleuritic pain due to splenic infarction
• Bleeding (rare)—due to abnormal platelet function
Investigation FBC: i WCC (usually >50 x 109/L) ± anaemia. Blood film:
bone marrow precursors of myeloid cells (blasts). Cytogenetics: Philadelphia
chromosome.
Management Refer urgently to haematology. Treatment is determined
by phase of the disease:
• Chronic (90% at diagnosis)—<10% of cells in the bone marrow
are immature blasts. Treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g.
imatinib) has dramatically improved prognosis in recent years
• Accelerated 10–30% of cells in the bone marrow are immature blasts.
Treatment is with chemotherapy ± bone marrrow/stem cell transplant,
or second generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors
• Blast (also called acute phase, blast crisis) >30% of cells in the bone
marrow are immature blasts—treated with chemotherapy

Myeloproliferative disorders Proliferation of ≥1 of the haemo­
poietic components of the bone marrow. Includes:
• CML
• Essential thrombocythaemia
• Polycythaemia vera
• Myelofibrosis

Chronic leukaemia and myeloproliferation

Erythrocytosis i in the number of circulating red cells. If haematocrit

is persistently i for >2mo (>0.52 4; >0.48 5), investigate the cause. May
be s (polycythaemia vera) or s. 0 Hb may also appear i if dehydrated
(concentration effect). Secondary polycythaemia may be:
• Appropriate High altitude, chronic lung disease (e.g. COPD),
cardiovascular disease with a right l left shunt, heavy smoking, sleep
apnoea, i affinity for haemoglobin (familial polycythaemia), or
• Inappropriate Caused by excess erythropoietin, e.g. s to hepatocellular
or renal tumour, or massive uterine fibroid. May need venesection

Polycythaemia vera Also known as primary proliferative
polycythaemia (PPP). Haematological malignancy resulting in
overproduction of red cells. Age range: most >50y.
Presentation Non-specific symptoms/signs:
• Headaches, dizziness, vertigo,
• Night sweats
• Dusky, cyanotic hue with red face and/or tinnitus
• Itching (especially provoked by • Gout—s to i red cell
turnover
water, e.g. after a bath)
• Peptic ulceration (5–10%)
• Splenomegaly (70%) ±
hepatomegaly
• Thrombosis/haemorrhage—abnormal platelet function/hyperviscosity
Investigation Often diagnosed incidentally following FBC done for other
reasons—persistently i Hb + haematocrit; neutrophils and platelets may
also be i. JAK2 mutation is +ve in >95%.
Management Refer urgently to haematology. Hb level is d by regular
venesection ± cytotoxics. Aspirin d risk of thrombosis. Slowly progressive
and survival for 10–20y is not unusual; a minority eventually transform to
acute myeloid leukaemia or myelofibrosis.

Essential thrombocythaemia Patients have i risk of thrombosis, but

may haemorrhage due to abnormal platelet function. FBC—persistently i
platelet count >450 x 109/L when reactive and other myeloproliferative
causes have been excluded. Refer urgently to haematology. Treatment is
with aspirin, treatment of CVD risk factors ± cytotoxics. May eventually
transform to AML.

Myelofibrosis (myelosclerosis) Progressive accumulation of fibrous

tissue in the bone marrow cavity, replacing normal marrow. Haemopoietic
function is taken over by the spleen/liver. Patients are usually elderly and
present with symptoms of anaemia, malaise, fever ± gout. The spleen
is massively enlarged FBC—d Hb; blood film—immature erythroid cells
(normoblasts) and myeloid cells (metamyelocytes/myelocytes). Red cells are
teardrop-shaped. Refer urgently to haematology. Median survival is 2–3y—
but many live much longer. 5–10% transform to AML.

Haematology and immunology

Lymphoma
Cancer of the lymphatic system. Two main types.
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) Derived from malignant
transformation of lymphocytes—85% B cells. Usually develops in LNs but
can arise in any tissue. Incidence: 12,300 cases/y in the UK (4% cancers),
causing 4,500 deaths/y. 4 = 5. 69% occur in patients >60y.
Presentation May be detected incidentally on CXR (mediastinal mass) or
present with painless peripheral lymphadenopathy; abdominal mass (nodal
or spleen); weight d; night sweats/unexplained fevers. Other symptoms
are dependent on site, e.g. neurological symptoms if CNS involvement;
pleural effusion; skin lesions.
Investigation FBC—may be normal if no bone marrow involvement;
monospot—perform in all patients <30y with persistent lymphadenopathy
to exclude EBV; ESR—usually i; LFTs—abnormal if liver involvement.
Initial management Depending on local referral pathways, consider
urgent referral to oncology, haematology, or for LN biopsy if:
• Lymphadenopathy present ≥6wk
• LNs are increasing in size or LN >2cm in size
• Widespread lymphadenopathy
• Lymphadenopathy + weight d, night sweats, and/or splenomegaly
• Any other suspicious symptoms/signs
Specialist treatment Based on histology and stage. Treatment options
include a wait-and-see approach for low-grade lymphomas; radiotherapy;
chemotherapy; bone marrow transplant; monoclonal antibody therapy
(rituximab); and/or immunotherapy.
Prognosis Varies widely between different types of NHL (Table 19.7)
and the age of the patient. Younger, fitter patients with less widespread
disease do better. Overall 51% survive 10y.

Hodgkin’s lymphoma 1,900 cases/y in the UK. Peak age ranges:
15–35y (>50% occur <40y) and 50–70y. Derived from B lymphocytes.
Two types of Hodgkin’s lymphoma are recognized:
• Classical (95%) Reed Sternberg cells are present
• Nodular lymphocyte predominant (5%) ‘Popcorn’ cells are present
Presentation Painless lymphadenopathy (70–95% have affected cervical
LNs at diagnosis), weight d, night sweats/unexplained fevers, pruritus. The
spleen is involved in 30% l splenomegaly.
Investigation and management As for NHL.
Prognosis
• Early stage disease (Ann Arbor stage 1/2—affected lymph tissue is
confined to 1 side of the diaphragm)—80% 10y survival
• Late stage disease (Ann Arbor stage 3/4—affected lymph tissue both
sides of diaphragm and/or extralymphatic tissue involvement)—60% 5y
survival.

Haematology and immunology

Immune deficiency syndromes
A group of diverse conditions caused by immune system defects and characterized clinically by i susceptibility to infections.
• Consider an immunodeficiency disorder in anyone with infections that
are unusually frequent, severe, resistant, or due to unusual organisms.

History In addition to history of infection, ask about:
• Family history: immune deficiency, early death, similar disease,
autoimmune illness, early malignancy
• Late separation of umbilical cord (>4wk) or shedding of primary teeth
• Failure to thrive
• Adverse reaction to immunization or viral infection
• Difficult-to-treat asthma or eczema
• Splenectomy, tonsillectomy, or adenoidectomy
• Prior prophylactic antibiotic or immunoglobulin therapy
Primary immunodeficiency As many p immunodeficiencies are
hereditary or congenital, they appear initially in infants and children; 780%
of those affected are <20y old and, owing to X-linked inheritance 4 >> 5.
Genetic screening is available for some conditions. Refer all suspected
cases to paediatrics/immunology.
Classification >70 primary immunodeficiencies have been described.
They are classified into 4 groups depending on which component of the
immune system is deficient:
• B cells
• Phagocytic cells
• T cells
• Complement
Prevalence Selective IgA deficiency (usually asymptomatic) occurs in
1:400 people. All other primary immune deficiencies are rare. Excluding
IgA deficiency, 50% of affected patients have B-cell deficiency; 30% T-cell
deficiency; 18% phagocytic deficiencies; and 2% complement deficiency.
Presentation Table 19.8 lists some of the more common immune
deficiencies. All immune deficiencies present with increased tendency to
infections. Type of infection varies according to the component of the
immune system involved. If suspected, refer for specialist review.

Secondary immunodeficiency Impairment of the immune system
resulting from illness (including drug therapy, e.g. with cytotoxics or
steroids) or removal of the spleen in a previously normal person.
Often reversible if the underlying condition or illness resolves. s
immunodeficiencies are common; most prolonged serious illness
interferes with the immune system to some degree. Treat the cause.

Haematology and immunology

Allergies
‘One man’s meat is another man’s poison.’
Allergic diseases result from an exaggerated response of the immune system to external substances. Affects 1:6 of the British population—and is
increasing. Allergic problems include:
•	Urticaria—b p. 614
• Asthma—b p. 308
• Occupational asthma—b p. 336 • Rhinitis—b p. 942
• Conjunctivitis—b p. 966
• Eczema—b pp. 606–9
• Food intolerance—b p. 685
• Anaphylaxis—b p. 1072

Assessment
• Age
• Symptoms—past and present, main problem, frequency and severity,
seasonal/perennial, provoking factors
• Impact on lifestyle—time off work/school, sleep
• Occupation/hobbies
• Treatment—past and present
• Home environment—pets, damp, dust, smoking
• Allergies in the past
• Family history of allergic illness
• Examination will depend on main symptoms

Investigation
IgE skin prick and serum testing Identifies IgE sensitivity to common
allergens, allowing diagnosis or exclusion of atopy. Uses skin prick testing
or measurement of serum IgE levels. In most places this is a s care
procedure although it is feasible in general practice. Patients should avoid
using antihistamines before skin prick testing.
Patch testing Specialist test. Identifies substances causing contact allergy.
A battery of allergens on discs are applied to the skin—usually on the
back—and stuck in place with tape. Skin response is then monitored.

Management
Allergen avoidance For patients with anaphylaxis, may be lifesaving:
• Pets Exclude the offending animal
• Pollens Keep windows shut (including car windows); wear glasses/
sunglasses; avoid grassy spaces; fit a pollen filter on the car
• Foods/drugs Avoid the food/drug; avoid hidden exposure (check
labels carefully); inform any school/clubs a child attends; take food with
you wherever possible; record drug allergies in medical notes
House dust mite Evidence that anti-house dust mite measures are
effective in the relief of asthma and eczema is weak. Measures focus on
the bedroom. Advise the room should be ventilated regularly; encase
mattresses, pillows, and duvets in mite-proof covers (leave in place 6mo);
wash bed clothes at 60°C every 1–2wk; use a vacuum cleaner with an
adequate filter; remove bedroom carpet; d soft toys to a minimum and
wash frequently/put in the freezer to kill house dust mites.
Medication See individual conditions.

Allergies

Referral to specialist allergy clinic
• Anaphylaxis
• Occupational allergy
• Food allergy
• If allergy diagnosis is in doubt
•	Urticaria in which allergic aetiology is suspected
• For consideration of immunotherapy
Bee/wasp sting allergy Accounts for 74 deaths/y in the UK. Stings
may result in a local or generalized reaction of varying severity. Treat
local or mild generalized reactions with antihistamine. Supply patients
with more severe reactions with an adrenaline autoinjector pen and teach
them, and close contacts, to use it. If severe reaction, refer to an allergy
clinic for consideration of desensitization.

Food allergy Affects 1.4% of the adult population and 5–7% of children.
Types of adverse reaction to foods include:
• IgE mediated food allergy Acute reaction (e.g. acute peanut allergy).
Symptoms include: itching, erythema, urticaria, angio-oedema, GI (e.g.
vomiting, abdominal pain), sneezing, wheeze, anaphylaxis
• Non-IgE mediated food allergy Delayed reaction (e.g. cow’s milk
causing eczema). Symptoms include: erythema, itching, eczema,
persistent GI symptoms (e.g. reflux, pain, loose stools, constipation)
• Non-allergic food intolerance May be pharmacological, e.g. tyramine
in red wine/cheese, causing migraine; metabolic, e.g. lactase deficiency;
or toxic, e.g. reaction to preservative rather than food
• Food aversion Symptoms are non-specific and unconfirmed by blinded
food challenge
A limited number of foods are responsible for the majority of true food
allergies: nuts (especially peanuts), wheat, eggs, fish, shellfish, cow’s milk.
Management
• IgE mediated reaction Request skin prick testing or send blood for
specific IgE testing. Advise allergen avoidance and supply an adrenaline
autoinjector pen (and teach to use) if anaphylactic reaction
• Otherwise Try eliminating the suspected food for 2–6wk and then
reintroduce. Dietician advice may be helpful
Referral Consider referral to allergy clinic or paediatrics if:
• Severe acute allergic reaction, e.g. anaphylaxis or angio-oedema
• Severe delayed reaction (e.g. severe eczema related to food)
• Confirmed IgE allergy and asthma • Strong suspicion of allergy
despite negative tests
• Suspected multiple allergies
• Poor growth with GI symptoms • No response to food avoidance
• Parental concern

Breast awareness Breast awareness means knowing what your
breasts look and feel like normally. Evidence suggests that there is no need
to follow a specific or detailed routine such as breast self-examination,
but you should be aware of any changes in your breasts.
The breast awareness 5-point code
1. Know what is normal for you
2. Know what changes to look and feel for
3. Look and feel
4. Report any changes to your GP without delay
5. Attend for routine breast screening if you are aged 50 or over
Changes to be aware of
• Size If one breast becomes larger or lower
• Nipples If a nipple becomes inverted (pulled in) or changes position
or shape
• Rashes On or around the nipple
• Discharge From one or both nipples
• Skin changes Puckering or dimpling
• Swelling Under the armpit or around the collarbone (where the
lymph nodes are)
• Pain Continuous, in one part of the breast or armpit
• Lump or thickening Different to the rest of the breast tissue
What should I do if I notice a change? If you do notice a change in your
breasts, see your GP as soon as you can. Your GP may ask you to come
back at a different time in your menstrual cycle or send you to a breast
clinic for a more detailed examination.
0 Remember that most breast changes are not cancer, even if they
need follow-up treatment or further investigation.

Breast disease

Breast symptoms
Urgent referral of patients with breast diseaseN (to be seen in
<2wk) is always required for:

Lump
• Any age with a discrete, hard lump with fixation ± skin tethering
• Any age with a past history of breast cancer presenting with a
further lump or other suspicious symptoms
• Asymmetrical nodularity that persists after next period (if applicable)
• Aged ≥30y with a discrete lump that persists after the next period or
presents after menopause
• Aged <30y:
• With a lump that enlarges or is fixed/hard
• In whom there are other reasons for concern such as family history
Nipple changes
• Unilateral eczematous skin or nipple change that does not respond
to topical treatment
• Nipple distortion of recent onset
• Spontaneous unilateral bloody nipple discharge

Consider a non-urgent referral if
•	The woman is aged <30y and has a lump which has no suspicious
features and is not enlarging
• Breast pain and no palpable abnormality, when initial treatment fails,
and/or symptoms persist (use of mammography is not recommended)
• In patients presenting with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of
breast cancer, investigation prior to referral is not recommended.

Breast lump
History Age (malignancy is rare <30y); how and when noticed; relationship
to menstrual cycle; changes in shape or size since noticed; pain; nipple
discharge; skin changes; pregnancy and breastfeeding; family history;
current medication (in particular contraceptive pill or HRT).
Examination With the woman seated, with arms at her sides, above her
head and pressing on her hips, look at the size and shape of the breasts,
skin contour, skin and nipple changes. Seat the woman at 45o supported
on a couch. Ask her to place the hand on the side being examined behind
her head. Ask the woman to point to or find the lump. Palpate each
quadrant of the breast with a flat hand. Check the tail of the breast in the
axilla. Examine both breasts. If a lump is found assess shape, size, surface,
edge, consistency, mobility, and attachments. Check local LNs in axilla and
supraclavicular region and for hepatomegaly.
Differential diagnosis

Management
• No lump Reassure. Educate the woman about breast awareness
(b p. 686). Consider reviewing in 6wk
• Discrete lump Refer
• Asymmetrical nodularity
• <30y with FH of breast cancer or ≥30y—non-urgent referral
• <30y and no family history—review in 6wk. If the nodularity has
gone reassure, otherwise refer
0 Any patient being referred with a breast lump will be concerned about
the possibility of breast cancer even though most will not have cancer.

Discharge from the nipple 90% of pre-menopausal women can

express milky, multiple-duct discharge. Ask about colour, quantity, and
whether the discharge is unilateral/bilateral. Examine to check for lumps.
Note colour/quantity of discharge and whether the discharge is coming
from multiple or a single duct and is spontaneous or expressed.
Differential diagnosis
• Physiological (e.g. pregnancy)
• Duct ectasia—b p. 693

• Breast cancer—b p. 696
• Intraductal papilloma—b p. 693

Management
• Refer urgently if unilateral, spontaneous bloody discharge
• Refer if >50y or features suggesting pathological cause (see Table 20.1)

Breast pain or mastalgia Most common in women aged 30–50y. Use
a pain chart for >2mo to distinguish cyclical from non-cyclical pain.
Cyclical breast pain Common. Two-thirds of women >35y have
cyclical mastalgia which causes distress or interferes with lifestyle.
Symptoms are often long-standing. Features:
• Usually bilateral though may not be the same intensity in both breasts
• Pain is generally felt over the lateral side of the breast, increases from
mid-cycle onwards, and is relieved by menstruation
Examination may reveal tenderness ± areas of nodularity/lumpiness.

Management of mild/moderate cyclical pain 85% patients. Reassure
that breast pain is a very unusual symptom of breast cancer. Explain the
hormonal basis of symptoms. Consider:
• Diet Reducing saturated fats and caffeine may help
• Support Advise to wear a soft, support bra at night
• OTC medication—Try simple analgesia (e.g. paracetamol) and/or
NSAID. Some women also find oil of evening primrose (gamolenic
acid) is effective but it may take 4mo to work
• Changing/stopping hormonal contraceptives or HRT
Management of severe cyclical pain Defined as pain for >7d/mo for
>6mo which interferes with lifestyle. Affects 15% patients. Try measures
for management of mild/moderate cyclical pain first. If they fail, consider
referral for specialist assessment.
Specialist treatments include: danazol, bromocriptine, tamoxifen, and
LHRH analogues. Drug treatment helps 780% of women. Treatment should
be reviewed after 3–6mo and only continued if necessary. After stopping
treatment, symptoms recur in about half, but are often less severe.

Non-cyclical breast pain Pain which is either continuous or

intermittent but with no relationship to the menstrual cycle. Ask if the
pain is localized or diffuse:
• Well-localized/point-specific Consider ill-fitting bras (especially
underwired), breast cyst, breast abscess, mastitis, breast cancer (rarely
presents with pain), chest wall causes, e.g. costochondritis
• More generalized Usually referred pain. Consider nerve root pain,
post-herpetic neuralgia, lung disease
Management Treat the cause. If no cause can be found, refer for specialist
assessment.

Eczema of the nipple Suspect underlying breast cancer. Refer for
specialist assessment if no response to topical treatment—b p. 606.

Breast disease

Benign breast disease
Most breast complaints are benign and have a physiological basis. Despite
this, women with breast complaints tend to ‘assume the worst’ when a
new problem is discovered. In most cases reassurance that there is nothing sinister underlying their symptoms is all that is required.

Mastalgia b p. 690
Fibroadenoma An aberration of normal lobular development. Peak age

16–24y. 3 types: common, giant (>5cm diameter), and juvenile (adolescent
girls). Present with a discrete, firm, non-tender, and highly mobile lump
(‘breast mouse’). Account for 13% of breast lumps.
Management Refer for confirmation of diagnosis—urgently if ≥30y, any
personal/family history of breast cancer, or any sinister features (b p. 688).
Diagnosis is confirmed with a combination of USS, mammography,
and fine needle aspirate/core biopsy. If the lump is large (>4cm), the
fibroadenoma is excised. In other groups, reassurance is usually all that is
needed. 95% fibroadenomas do not enlarge after diagnosis and 25% d in
size or disappear with time.
0 Fibroadenomas may calcify in older women and give a characteristic
appearance in mammograms.

Sclerosing adenosis Benign condition resulting from over-proliferation

of the terminal duct lobules. It can cause recurring pain and/or result
in a small, firm lump in the breast. Often detected incidentally on
mammography as a calcified, ‘stellate’ abnormality. Always refer urgently
for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment is symptomatic.

Phyllodes tumour Peak age 40–50y. 3 types—benign (most common);
borderline malignant (uncommon); and malignant (rare).
Presentation and management Presents with a breast lump. Refer
urgently for confirmation of diagnosis through a combination of USS,
mammography, and fine needle aspirate/core biopsy. Treatment is always
surgical with wide excision of the lump. Recurrence may occur.

Fat necrosis Usually history of injury ± bruising. As bruising settles,
scarring results in a firm lump in the breast ± puckering of the skin.
Most common in women with large breasts. Always refer urgently to a
breast surgeon for triple assessment (USS, mammography + fine needle
aspiration/core biopsy). Once diagnosis is confirmed, no treatment is
needed. The lump often disappears spontaneously.

Breast cyst Benign and fluid-filled. Cysts may be of any size, single or
multiple. Most common >35y. Usually pre-menopausal women but may
occur in post-menopausal women taking HRT. Presents as a firm, rounded
lump which is not fixed and not associated with skin changes/skin tethering.
First breast cyst Refer for exclusion of malignancy—urgently if ≥30y, FH
of breast cancer, or other suspicious features. Diagnosis is confirmed with
aspiration and/or USS and/or mammography.

Benign breast disease

Past history of breast cysts 30% of patients who have had a breast cyst
develop another at a later date. If the lump is accessible, it is reasonable to
attempt aspiration. There is no need to send aspirated fluid for cytology if
the fluid is not bloodstained and lump completely resolves. Refer if the fluid
aspirated is bloodstained; the lump does not disappear completely; the
cyst refills; aspiration fails; or cytology reveals malignant or suspicious cells.
• Do not attempt aspiration if you have not been trained to do so as
there is a small but significant risk of pneumothorax.

Galactocoele Milk-containing cyst which arises during pregnancy.
Refer any new lump arising in pregnancy to a breast surgeon. Repeated
aspiration may be needed. Resolves spontaneously.

Duct ectasia Occurs around the menopause. Ducts become blocked
and secretions behind stagnate. Presents as discharge from ≥1 duct which
may be bloodstained ± breast lump ± nipple retraction (‘transverse slit’
appearance) ± breast pain.
Management Refer for confirmation of diagnosis—urgently if lump
and/or bloodstained nipple discharge and/or nipple retraction. Usually
no treatment is needed although surgery may be required to confirm
diagnosis, if discharge is troublesome, or to evert the nipple.

Periductal mastitis Infected subareolar ducts. Affects younger women

than duct ectasia with peak age 32y. Presents with breast tenderness
± inflammation in areolar area. May also have nipple discharge and/or
retraction and/or an associated inflammatory mass/abscess.
Management Treat with antibiotics, e.g. co-amoxiclav 500/125 tds. Advise
smokers that smoking can slow the healing process. If an abscess is present,
refer for drainage. Refer if any residual inflammation or masses following
treatment to exclude cancer. If recurrent infection, refer for consideration
of surgery to remove the blocked duct.
Mastitis in lactating women b p. 838

Intraductal papilloma Benign, wart-like lump that forms within a
duct, just behind the areola. Perimenopausal women are more likely to
have a single intraductal papilloma; younger women often have >1. May
be bilateral. Presents with nipple discharge which may be bloodstained ±
a subareolar lump/nodule (30%). Refer for confirmation of diagnosis—
urgently if lump and/or bloodstained discharge. Usually excised.
Breast abscess Usually occurs in a lactating breast following mastitis;
occasionally in a non-lactating breast in association with indrawn nipple,
mammary duct ectasia, or local skin infection. Presents with gradual onset
of pain in one breast segment with hot, tender swelling of the affected area.
Management Refer for surgical assessment. May be treated with repeated
aspiration under ultrasound guidance or surgical incision and drainage.

Mamary duct fistula Fistula between a mammary duct and the skin.
Usually a complication of a breast abscess. Refer for surgical excision.

Breast cancer screening
In the UK there has been a national screening programme for breast cancer since 1988. The aim of the programme is to detect breast cancer at
an early stage in order to i survival chances (stage I tumours—5y survival
84%; stage IV tumours—5y survival 18%).

Breast awareness Trials of self-examination have not d mortality.
Instead less formal ‘Breast Awareness’ is advocated—b p. 686.

Screening test
Women >50y Two-view mammographic screening is currently available
to women aged 50–70y every 3y. This will be extended to women aged
47–73y throughout the UK by 2016. Older women can also request
screening every 3y. Screening detects 85% of cancers in women aged >50y
(60% of which are impalpable) and ~70–80% screening-detected cancers
have good prognosis. Screening more frequently does not d mortalityR.
Organization of breast cancer screening in the UK—see Figure 20.2.
High-risk women <50y Women with family history of breast cancer may
be at i risk of breast cancer themselves (see Figure 20.3, b p. 697) and
may benefit from earlier screening and/or genetic screening:
• All raised/high-risk women aged 40–49y—should be offered annual
two-view mammography
• Women known to have a genetic mutation should be offered annual
MRI surveillance—from 20y if TP53 mutation, and from 30y if BRCA1/2
mutation
•	MRI surveillance should also be offered to women aged 30–39y with
10y risk >8%; women aged 40 –49y with 10y risk >20%; and at-risk
women aged 40–49y with a dense breast pattern on mammography

Interval cancers Cancer occurring in the interval between screens.
Can occur through failure to detect a cancer at screening or as a result
of a new event after screening took place. In the first year after screening
20% breast cancers are interval cancers. This i to 760% in the third year.
Acceptability of screening 81% women find mammography
uncomfortable, but 90% return for subsequent screens. GPs have an
important role in promoting National Cancer Screening Programmes to
their patients; GP endorsement i uptake ratesR.

Anxiety from screening False-positive results cause anxiety as well
as prompting further invasive investigations. Anxiety levels in women
recalled and then found to be disease-free are higher a year after the recall
appointment than in women who receive negative results at screening.

Breast disease

Breast cancer
Breast cancer is now the most common cancer in the UK with >48,000
new diagnoses every year (including 340 new cases/y affecting men).
Women have a 1 in 8 lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Virtually all
breast cancers are adenocarcinoma (85% ductal; 15% lobular).

Risk factors
Geography More common in the developed world—migrants assume the
risk of the host country within two generations.
Personal characteristics
• Age i with age—781% of breast cancers occur in women >50y
• Socio-economic Higher incidence in more affluent social classes
• Physical characteristics Taller women have i risk; women with
denser breasts have 2–6x i risk
Lifestyle factors
• Obesity i risk post menopause
• Physical activity 30% d risk if taking regular physical activity
• High-fat diet Probably associated with i risk
• Alcoholi risk by 7%/unit consumed/d
Reproductive history
• Early menarche or late menopause i risk
• Pregnancy i parity results in d risk (32% d risk in women reporting
three births compared to women reporting one); late age when first
child is born i risk
• Breastfeeding d relative risk by 4.3% for each year of breastfeeding
• Combined hormonal contraception Slight i risk (relative risk 1.24 for
current users)—excess risk disappears within 10y of stopping
• HRT Risk i by 6 cases/1,000 after 5y combined HRT use and
19 cases/1,000 after 10y use. Risk for combined oestrogen and
progestogen preparations is greater than oestrogen-only preparations.
HRT also d sensitivity of mammography
Other past medical history
• Past history of breast disease Ductal or lobular carcinoma in situ,
florid hyperplasia, and papilloma with fibrovascular core all i risk
• Ionizing radiation Exposure i risk
Family history Referral algorithm—see Figure 20.3.
• One first-degree relative with breast cancer (mother/sister) Risk i
2x—but 95% of women with breast cancer have no family history
• Several family members with early onset breast cancer Refer for
genetic screening—BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes account for 2–5% of all
breast cancers
0 Family relationships:
• First-degree relative—mother, father, sister, brother, daughter, son
• Second-degree relative—grandparents, grandchildren, aunt, uncle,
niece, nephew, half-sister, half-brother

Breast disease

Prevention Consider referral to secondary/tertiary care if family history
of breast cancer (b p. 697).
• Lifestyle measures—d alcohol intake; d weight; i exercise; avoid
exogenous sex hormones (e.g. HRT); breastfeed
• Chemoprophylaxis—tamoxifen d risk of breast cancer by 40% in
high-risk women but use is limited by side effects (thromboembolism
and endometrial carcinoma); other drug trials are in progress
• Prophylactic surgery—d risk by 90% in very high-risk women

Presentation Often found at breast screening (b p. 694). Clinical
presentations include:
• Breast lump (90%)
• Breast pain (21% present with painful lump; pain alone <1%)
• Nipple skin change (10%). Any red, scaly lesion or eczema around
the nipple suggests Paget’s disease of the breast—intraepidermal,
intraductal cancer
• Family history (6%)
• Skin contour change (5%)
• Nipple discharge (3%)
• Rarely presents with distant metastases, e.g. bone pain
• In the elderly, may present with extensive local lesions
Management Refer for urgent assessment (<2wk) to a breast surgeon.
Specialist investigation includes mammography, USS ± fine needle aspiration
or core biopsy. If diagnosis is confirmed further investigations include tumour
markers and/or CT/MRI, liver USS, and/or bone scan to evaluate spread.
Treatment Includes surgery (lumpectomy ± axillary clearance,
mastectomy), endocrine therapy, radiotherapy, and/or chemotherapy.
Adjuvant endocrine therapy Oestrogen has an important role in the
progression of breast cancer. Oestrogen and progesterone receptors
determine the response to endocrine therapy.
• Tamoxifen i survival of patients with oestrogen receptor +ve tumours
(60% tumours) of any age but rarely causes endometrial cancer—warn
patients to report any untoward vaginal bleeding. Continue tamoxifen
for ≥5y— take advice from a specialist prior to stopping
• Aromatase inhibitors, e.g. anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane.
Block synthesis of oestrogen. Superior efficacy when compared to
tamoxifen for postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive early,
breast cancer, and first choice for postmenopausal women with
advanced breast cancer. Continue for ≥5y—take advice from a specialist
prior to stopping
• Trastuzumab Monoclonal antibody directed against HER2, a receptor
found in 1:5 breast cancers. Affects division and growth of breast
cancer cells. Treatment option for women with early HER2 +ve
cancer at high risk of recurrence and women with advanced
HER2 +ve breast cancer. Administered IV every 3wk for 1y
0 Optimum treatment regimes for breast cancer change regularly and
there are regional variations. Many women will be asked to participate
in clinical trials to answer important questions about best treatments.

Prognosis 73% of women diagnosed now will live 10y; 64% live ≥20y.

Breast cancer

• Recurrence is most likely <2y after treatment—late recurrences do
occur but the longer since diagnosis, the less the chance of recurrence
• Prognosis for an individual depends on age (best prognosis if 50–69y),
stage of disease (see Table 20.3), grade of tumour, and oestrogen
receptor status (oestrogen receptor –ve tumours have poorer prognosis)
• Women living in affluent areas have better survival rates than those in
deprived areas

Psychological impact of breast cancer Depression, anxiety, marital
and sexual problems are common. Be sensitive. Discuss possibilities of
reconstructive surgery or breast prostheses as appropriate. Refer to the
specialist breast care nurse for support and advice.

at them under the microscope. Axillary node clearance can result in
lymphoedema and d arm function. Sentinel node biopsy is the removal
of the key or sentinel LN in patients undergoing surgery for early breast
cancer to accurately predict the state of nodal disease in the remaining
axillary LNs. Radical axillary surgery to clear the axillary nodes can then
be reserved for the 20–40% with a +ve sentinel LN biopsy.

Gynaecology

The menstrual cycle
A good working knowledge of the menstrual cycle is essential to understand its endocrine disorders and their management. One menstrual cycle
lasts from the start of one period until the day before the start of the next.
The average length of a cycle is 28d, but anything from 24–35d is common.
The menstrual cycle is split into four (see Figure 21.1).

Follicular or proliferative phase
Hormone changes Levels of oestrogen and progesterone are low. There
is d negative feedback on the pituitary as a result so follicle-stimulating
hormone (FSH) levels i. FSH stimulates follicle development in the ovary.
The developing follicles then produce oestrogen.
Changes within the reproductive organs
• Ovaries Follicles develop. One follicle becomes dominant
• Uterus Lining thickens (proliferates)
• Vagina Tends to be drier with thicker mucus

Ovulation Occurs halfway through a cycle (714d before the next
period). The dominant follicle ruptures and an egg is released into the
Fallopian tube. The follicle fills with blood after rupturing and there may
be brief pain—mittelschmerz (reassure—no treatment needed). The egg
travels along the Fallopian tube into the uterus and may be fertilized if the
woman is sexually active and not using contraception.
Secretory or luteal phase
Hormone changes After ovulation, the ruptured follicle forms the corpus
luteum (yellow body) and secretes progesterone and oestrogen.
Changes within the reproductive organs
• Ovaries Corpus luteum forms. If pregnancy does not occur the corpus
luteum begins to degenerate 74d prior to menstruation
• Uterus Progesterone causes the lining of the uterus to alter so that it is
ready to receive a fertilized egg. The endometrium becomes oedematous,
more vascular, and the glandular component becomes coiled and tortuous
• Vagina Mucus becomes thinner, more watery, and slippery. It becomes
thicker again towards the next period as progesterone d
• Other changes Progesterone may cause ‘water retention’, breast
tenderness, and mood changes

Periods (menstruation) With regression of the corpus luteum,

oestrogen and progesterone levels d. This causes necrosis, bleeding,
and sloughing of the endometrium, resulting in a period or menstruation.
Periods begin aged 11–16y and continue until the menopause (usually
45–55y). Bleeding can last from 1–8d (average 5d) and is generally heaviest
in the first 2d. Blood loss in each period is 720–60mL (>80mL is abnormal
and may lead to anaemia). Some period pain is common and normal.

Prolonged menstruation Bleeding for >5–6d/cycle. Most loss
occurs in the first 3d. Long periods do not equate to i menstrual loss so
prolonged menstruation per se does not need investigation. Frequently
goes with menorrhagia—b p. 708.

Anovulatory cycles Common around menarche, in the perimenopause,
and in women with PCOS. In the absence of ovulation, there is no luteal
phase of the cycle leading to variable and erratic cycle length.
Postponing menstruation

• Combined oral contraceptive (COC) pill Started ≥1mo before and
continued throughout the time the withdrawal bleed should have
occurred (2 packets back-to-back without a break). The withdrawal
bleed will occur after the second packet is finished
• Combined contraceptive patch Can be used for 6wk without a
patch-free break to postpone a period
• Norethisterone 5mg tds starting 3d before the anticipated onset
of menstruation. Menstruation will occur 2–3d after stopping the
norethisterone

Odd colour/smell of menstrual blood No known associations.
Post-coital and intermenstrual bleeding
• Post-coital bleeding (PCB) Non-menstrual bleeding occurring during
or after sexual intercourse. Consider cervical cancer (b p. 726).
Other possible causes include infections of the lower genital tract,
cervical ectropion and polyps, trauma, and vaginal and vulval lesions
• Intermenstrual bleeding (IMB) Vaginal bleeding at any time during
the menstrual cycle other than menstruation. May be physiological
or related to use of CHC. Other causes include: endometrial polyps,
uterine fibroids, endometrial hyperplasia or cancer, endometritis, and
cervical, vulval or vaginal cancer
• Always perform a full pelvic examination. If suggestive of cervical cancer,
refer urgently (<2wk) for gynaecology opinion. Do not use cervical smears
as a diagnostic test. Consider urgent referral if intermenstrual bleeding
even if the cervix looks normal.

Gynaecology

Premenstrual syndrome
Most women of reproductive age notice symptoms/bodily changes in the
days/weeks leading up to their periods. These changes resolve or d significantly during the period and are termed premenstrual tension (PMT),
or premenstrual syndrome (PMS) if they occur on a regular basis and are
severe enough to interfere with quality of life. >95% women have some
symptoms but <20% seek help. Debilitating symptoms occur in 5%.

Cause Underlying mechanism is not fully understood but is thought
to be due to the hormonal changes that occur after ovulation affecting
neurotransmitters in the brain.
Symptoms >100 symptoms described. The most common are:
• Psychological—mood swings, nervous tension and/or irritability (when
severe, termed premenstrual dysphoric disorder—PMDD)
• Physical—abdominal bloating, i weight, breast tenderness, headache
• Behavioural—d visuospatial and cognitive ability, i in accidents
Management Aims to alleviate symptoms. Usually symptoms return
when treatment is stopped.
• Take a history of symptoms and ask the woman to keep a diary to
establish cyclical nature over >2mo
• If mild/moderate symptoms—try lifestyle/dietary modification first:
• Make allowances on days when symptoms are likely to be worst
• Wear loose clothes if feeling bloated
• Ensure adequate sleep and take regular exercise
• Eat regularly—some find small, frequent meals help; avoid sweet
snacks between meals; make sure diet is low in fat/salt, caffeine,
and alcohol, and contains plenty of fruit/vegetables and complex
carbohydrate (e.g. bread, pasta, rice, potatoes)
• d fluid intake or eat diuretic foods (e.g. strawberries, watermelon,
aubergines, prunes, figs, parsley) to ease fluid retention
• OTC remedies may help (see Table 21.1)
• Consider drug therapy or CBT (see Table 21.1) if symptoms are severe
or do not respond to diet/lifestyle measures. Base choice on symptoms
• For all treatments try a 3–6mo trial. Ask women to keep a symptom
diary. Be sure to follow up—as the first treatment may not work
• If symptoms are severe or primary care management is ineffective,
refer to gynaecology/mental health services for specialist management
0 Because of side effects, oestrogen patches and gonadotrophin-releasing
hormone analogues are usually only used by specialists for severe or
resistant PMS/PMDD.

Amenorrhoea
Oligomenorrhoea Infrequent periods (>35d between periods).
Manage as for amenorrhoea.
Primary amenorrhoea No menstruation by age 16y when growth
and sexual development is normal. Refer for specialist treatment. Causes:
• Outflow abnormalities Müllerian agenesis; transverse vaginal septum;
androgen insensitivity (b p. 895), imperforate hymen
• Ovarian disorders PCOS; gonadal dysgenesis, e.g. Turner’s
syndrome—0 gonads may have malignant potential
• Pitutary disorders Prolactinoma (b p. 370)
• Hypothalamic disorders Kallman’s syndrome (congenital GnRH
deficiency associated with anosmia)
Secondary amenorrhoea Absence of menses for ≥3mo in a
previously menstruating woman. Causes: see Figure 21.2.

History Always consider the possibility of pregnancy.
• Symptoms
• Galactorrhoea—30% prolactinomas
• Weight change—weight d may cause amenorrhoea
• Hirsutism—may suggest PCOS or androgen-secreting tumour
• Life crisis or upset—e.g. exams, bereavement
• Level of exercise—high-intensity athletes, e.g. gymnasts are
frequently amenorrhoeic
• Sweats and/or flushes (suggests menopause)
• Cyclical pain—may suggest outflow obstruction
• Family history Of premature menopause or late menarche
• Drug history Particularly contraceptives, e.g. injectable progestogens.
Other drugs include: heroin, methadone, metoclopramide
• Past history Of chemo- or radiotherapy or gynaecological surgery
Examination
• Weight and height—common if BMI <19kg/m2
• External genitalia—structural abnormality, virilism
• Vaginal examination—including cervical smear if overdue
• Pelvic examination—ovarian masses, uterine size
• General examination—2º sexual characteristics, hirsutism, systemic
disease (including visual fields/retinal examination, ? prolactinoma)
0 For young girls, replace vaginal/pelvic examination with per-abdominal
pelvic USS.
Investigation
• Blood— Serum prolactin; TFTs; FSH/LH ; karyotype if phenotypical
abnormality; serum testosterone if LH high, hirsutism or virilism
• USS pelvis If structural abnormality or to confirm PCOS

Management of secondary amenorrhoea Treat the cause:
Contraception
• Injectable progestogens—stop; periods usually return within a year
• Other hormonal methods—stop; look for another cause of
amenorrhoea if periods do not return in ≤3mo

Amenorrhoea

If underweight Investigate and treat reasons for weight loss (e.g. anorexia).
Encourage weight i. If no response refer to gynaecology/eating disorders
clinic.
Physical exercise Explain the reason for amenorrhoea—many women refuse
to cut their activity levels; consider HRT/CHC to protect bone density.
Stress Reassure. Treat any psychiatric problems—periods should return
spontaneously. Set a limit for return (e.g. another 3–4mo). If periods do
not return consider referral as there may be another cause.
Endocrine
• Thyroid dysfunction—treat hyper- or hypothyroidism
• Hypothalamic causes—refer to endocrinology. After 6mo amenorrhoea,
there is i risk of coronary heart disease and osteoporosis. Consider use
of HRT or CHC
• Hyperprolactinaemia—refer to endocrinology

Gynaecology

Menorrhagia
Menorrhagia (heavy periods) is defined as menstrual loss ≥80mL/mo. 10%
meet this criterion but 1 in 3 feel their loss is excessive. Ask about number
of tampons or pads used/d, use of double protection to prevent leaks,
flooding and clots to gauge bleeding. Ask how periods affect life and activities. A menstrual diary may help. Assessment: see Figure 21.3.

Differential diagnosis Physiological bleeding or dysfunctional uterine
bleeding (50%). Exclude pregnancy. Other causes:
• Endometrial/cervical polyps
• Fibroids
• Congenital uterine abnormality, • Presence of IUCD
• Endometrial carcinoma
e.g. bicornuate uterus
• Bleeding tendency
• Pelvic infection
• Hormone-producing tumours
• Endometriosis

0 Hyper- or hypothyroidism, DM, prolactin disorders, adrenal, kidney or
liver disease, and some medications can also cause menstrual disturbance.

• Resuscitate as necessary—admit if shocked; IV tranexamic acid or
D&C in the acute situation can d haemorrhage by 75–80%.
• Reduce/stop bleeding with progestogen, e.g. norethisterone 5mg tds,
for 10d. Effective in 24–48h. A lighter bleed follows on stopping. Alternatively
consider tranexamic acid (1g tds for 4d) to d bleeding.
• Correct anaemia and refer for gynaecology assessment.

Gynaecology

The menopause
From the Greek meno (month) and pausis (halt). Menopause occurs when
menstruation stops. Average age in the UK 751y. Smoking brings it forwards by 72y. Impact on a woman’s life varies and depends on cultural,
health, and social factors.

Diagnosis >12mo amenorrhoea with no other cause.
Period changes
• Changes in menstrual pattern Common in the years before the
menopause—typically cycle shortens after 40y by up to 7–10d. Cycle
then lengthens—periods may occur at 2–3mo intervals until stopping
• Dysfunctional uterine bleeding Common leading up to the
menopause but investigate if very heavy, painful, irregular,
intermenstrual, or post-coital bleeding
• Late menstruation (>54y) Investigate as i risk of malignancy

Psychological symptoms Controversial. Some studies report
depression/anxiety are more common, others find no association.
Depression is multifactorial—consider social, physical, and cultural factors
before resorting to HRT as a solution. Regular sustained aerobic exercise
(e.g. swimming or running) d psychological symptoms and insomnia.
Flushes and sweats 80% have flushes during the menopause—20%
seek help. Often associated with palpitations.
Lifestyle changes Low-intensity exercise (e.g. yoga, deep breathing); cool
ambient temperature; wearing natural fibres, e.g. cotton; stress d; avoiding
trigger foods/drinks (e.g. spicy foods, caffeine, alcohol).
Drug treatments
• Hormone therapy (b p. 712)—effective in 80–90% of women
• Megestrol acetate (40mg od—unlicensed)—effective but carries many
of the same risks as HRT—may cause vaginal bleeding on withdrawal
• SSRIs/SNRIs (e.g. venlafaxine 37.5mg bd—unlicensed)—moderately
effective and may also improve mood
• Gabapentin (300mg tds—unlicensed)—d flushes by 45%
• Clonidine—commonly used but little evidence of effectiveness; may
cause hypotension
Complementary therapies
• Black cohosh eases hot flushes—long-term effects are unknown
• Red clover may help—studies have mixed results; avoid with warfarin
• Foods containing phyto-oestrogens (e.g. soy foods) may be helpful and
are unlikely to be harmful
•	Natural progesterone from yams—topical preparations are ineffective
• Dong quai, evening primrose oil, vitamin E, and ginseng are no better
than placebo. Avoid kava—it is linked to cases of serious liver damage

Sexual dysfunction Vaginal dryness and atrophy are common. Manage
with vaginal lubricants or topical oestrogen (unless other reasons for
systemic HRT). Loss of libido (especially after surgical removal of the
ovaries) responds to administration of androgen (e.g. testosterone) with
HRT, until libido is re-established.

The menopause

Urinary problems Common—incontinence, nocturia, and urgency.
Stress incontinence does not respond to HRT but topical oestrogen may
improve outcome of surgery. Recurrent UTIs and incontinence in older
women d with use of topical vaginal oestrogen.

Ischaemic heart disease Risk is i x2 after the menopause but there is
no evidence to support use of HRT for p or s prevention of IHD.

Osteoporosis Consider HRT to prevent osteoporosis in premature

menopause (b p. 511). In older women, HRT is not recommended as
first-line treatment of osteoporosis unless there are other reasons for
prescribing HRT.

Could the symptoms be due to another cause? Exclude:
• Physical illness, e.g. thyroid disease, anaemia, DM, chronic renal disease
• Side effects of medication, e.g. Ca2+ antagonists cause flushing
• Social problems or psychiatric illness—depression screening
questionnaires can be helpful
Is the diagnosis in doubt? FSH >30iu/L on 2 occasions >1mo apart

suggests the woman is postmenopausal. Check FSH:
• Following hysterectomy with conservation of ovaries
• If amenorrhoea age <45y, or
• If having regular bleeds due to cyclical HRT/CHC—check at the beginning
of a packet (oestrogen phase) or end of the CHC-free week, respectively.
CHC/HRT can d FSH—to make a more accurate assessment, stop the
preparation and check FSH levels 6 and 12wk after stopping
0 It is unnecessary to check FSH in other groups >45y with amenorrhoea. FSH levels may be normal in the perimenopause.

Premature menopause Menopause in a woman <40y old. Associated
with i all-cause mortality and i risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular
disease. Causes:
•	Radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy
• Idiopathic
• Infection—TB, mumps
• FSH receptor abnormalities
• Surgery—bilateral oophorectomy l instant menopause; hysterectomy
without oophorectomy can also induce premature ovarian failure
• Chromosome abnormalities—particularly the X chromosome
• Autoimmune endocrine disease, e.g. DM, hypothyroidism, Addison’s
• Disruption of oestrogen synthesis
Management Usually HRT is recommended until the average age of
menopause, i.e. 51y.

Gynaecology

Hormone replacement therapy
Short-term use of HRT is used for relief of symptoms related to oestrogen
deficiency peri- and postmenopausally, e.g. flushes/sweats. Carefully balance risks against benefits for each individual.

Contraindications History of hormone-dependent cancer; thrombo­
embolic disease (including AF); liver disease where LFTs have failed to
return to normal. If past history of liver disease, gallstones, or taking
liver-enzyme-inducing drugs, consider transdermal therapy.
Particular indications
• Early menopause—consider alternatives if prescribing for osteoporosis
prevention alone; continue until age 51y.
• Hysterectomy before menopause even if ovaries are conserved; ~1 in
4 have early menopause.
• Second-line treatment of osteoporosis—b p. 511

Choice of preparation (BNF 6.4.1.1.) Start with a low dose and provide
a 3mo supply. Tablets, patches, gels, and implants are available:
• For women without a uterus—Give oestrogen alone, unless past
history of endometriosis (endometrial foci may remain despite
hysterectomy, so consider addition of a progestogen)
• For women with an intact uterus—Progestogen is needed for the
last 12–14d of the cycle or IUS to prevent endometrial proliferation.
Alternatively, use a continuous oestrogen/progestogen preparation
(although not in the perimenopause or <12mo after last menstrual period)
Tibolone Oestrogenic, progestogenic, and weak androgenic action. Use in
the same way as continuous combined HRT.
Topical vaginal preparations Oestrogen pessaries, creams, or rings.
For vaginal dryness/atrophic vaginitis. Licence limits use 3–6mo if uterus
is present although commonly used for longer. Consider prescribing
a progestogen if given for longer periods or higher doses are used.
Investigate abnormal bleeding.

Things to do before starting HRT
History Why does the woman want to start HRT? What are her expectations of treatment? Has she had a hysterectomy? If not, ask about bleeding
pattern. Investigate abnormal bleeding prior to starting HRT.
Other points to cover
• Risk factors for osteoporosis, DVT, and CVD; FH of breast cancer
• Contraceptive requirement—HRT does not provide contraception.
If <50y, CHC (b p. 752) may provide contraception and alleviate
menopausal symptoms
• Drug history—previous experience of HRT; levothyroxine (may need
to i dose of levothyroxine when start HRT—check TFTs); steroids
(HRT d effectiveness of steroids); anti-epileptics (i elimination of
oestrogen)
Examination Check BP; weight; breasts (check no lumps; demonstrate
breast self-examination techniques); smear is up to date; consider
examination for prolapse/vaginal abnormalities if symptoms.

Hormone replacement therapy

Starting HRT Explain the pros and cons of HRT (see Table 21.2). Support
with health promotion information, e.g. about smoking cessation, breast
cancer screening programme. Review after 3mo. Check BP and weight.
i dose if symptoms are not controlled. Common side effects:
• Oestrogen-related—Fluid retention, breast enlargement and
tenderness, nausea, headaches
• Progestogen-related—Headache, i weight, bloating, and depression
(d by changing to a preparation with a less androgenic progestogen,
e.g. dydrogesterone or medroxyprogesterone)
Bleeding Bleeding may be erratic for the first 2–3mo in patients taking

cyclical HRT but should occur after the progestogen supplement in
subsequent cycles. Continuous combined preparations may cause spotting
for 4–6mo; if bleeding continues >6mo, investigate to exclude endometrial
abnormality and consider changing to a cyclical preparation.

Once established on HRT Review every 6–12mo and if any problems.

Check BP, weight, breasts, symptoms, and bleeding pattern. Reassess risks
and benefits. HRT is needed for <5y for vasomotor symptoms. When
stopping, withdrawal flushes may be distressing—stop in cold weather and
half the dose for 1mo first. Reasons to stop immediately:
• Serious neurological effects, e.g. • Hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement
• BP >160mmHg systolic and/or
severe headache, first fit
>95mmHg diastolic
• Severe chest pain
• Detection of a risk factor, e.g.
• Sudden breathlessness/cough
DVT, stroke
with bloodstained sputum
• Unexplained severe pain in calf • Prolonged immobility after
surgery or leg injury
• Severe stomach pain

Gynaecology

Pelvic pain
Pelvic pain may be acute or chronic (pain for ≥6mo). Causes: see Table 21.3.

History Allow the woman to tell her story. Ask about:
• Pain—site; severity; onset (? pregnant); character/timing/pattern (e.g.
relationship to menstrual cycle or sexual intercourse, exacerbating/
relieving factors, effects of movement/posture); other associated
features. Decide whether the cause is gynaecological—patients usually
have dyspareunia and pain may be cyclical
• Bowel (nausea and vomiting)/bladder/psychological symptoms
• Past history—ectopic pregnancy, pelvic infection/surgery, other
factors (be sensitive to possible history of sexual abuse or rape)
Examination Abdominal, pelvic, and vaginal examination—including
rectal examination if indicated and cervical smear if overdue. Normal
pelvic and vaginal examination makes a gynaecological cause unlikely.
Investigation Consider: urine—pregnancy test, M,C&S, dipstick for
protein, RBCs, nitrites, and leucocyte esterase; blood—FBC, CRP, CA125;
radiology—pelvic USS if gynaecological cause is suspected. 0 Offer
screening for STIs to all sexually active women with chronic pelvic pain.
Management of acute pelvic pain Admit if severe or if ectopic
pregnancy cannot be excluded. Otherwise provide analgesia and treat the
cause.

Management of chronic pelvic pain Affects 1 in 6 women in the
UK. There is often >1 cause—aim to identify and address contributory
factors instead of assigning a single cause.
Dyspareunia Pain on intercourse. 10% women admit sexual intercourse
usually causes discomfort. It may be superficial (felt around the introitus)
or deep (felt deep inside). There is a psychological element in most cases
(a vicious cycle of pain leading to fear of intercourse which exacerbates
symptoms). Address both physical and psychological aspects.
Superficial dyspareunia Examine if possible but do not insist. Treat cause.
If no specific treatment, try lidocaine gel. Causes:
• Vulval Vulvitis—atrophic, infective (candida, HSV); dystrophy;
neoplasm; lichen sclerosus; lichen planus; vulvodynia
• Vaginal Vaginismus; lack of lubrication; vaginitis—atrophic, infective;
congenital—imperforate hymen, atresia; surgery, e.g. painful
episiotomy scar; contracture—atrophy or after surgery/radiotherapy
• Urethral Urethritis; urethral caruncle; urethral diverticulum
Deep dyspareunia Causes: endometriosis; pelvic inflammatory disease;
retroverted uterus; ovarian mass (rarely ovarian cancer); non-gynaecological
causes. Examine, treat any cause found else refer for further investigation.
If no cause is found or cause is untreatable, pain can be d by limiting
penetration. Often becomes a chronic problem.
Dysmenorrhoea (painful periods) >50% premenopausal women
have some pelvic discomfort around their period; 1 in 10 find period pain
significantly interferes with lifestyle.

Pelvic pain

Primary dysmenorrhoea No underlying pelvic pathology. Tends to start
6–12mo after menarche when ovulatory cycles are established. Presents
with lower abdominal cramps ± backache which occur in the first
1–2d of each period. May be associated GI disturbance, e.g. diarrhoea/
vomiting. Young women (<20y) with no other symptoms do not require
examination unless pathology is suspected. Perform a full abdominal and
pelvic examination if older woman or atypical features. Treatment is with:
• NSAID (e.g. mefenamic acid 500mg tds, ibuprofen 200–400mg tds)—
effective in 80–90%; start when bleeding starts
• CHC—effective in 80–90%
0 10–20% do not respond—consider a missed cause.
Secondary dysmenorrhea Suggests underlying pathology. Causes:
• Submucous fibroid
• Endometriosis/adenomyosis
• History of pelvic/abdominal surgery
• Chronic pelvic infection
• Intrauterine adhesions
• IUCD/IUS
(Asherman’s syndrome)
• Endometrial polyps
• Psychosexual problems
• Cervical stenosis
Starts later than teenage years, or may present as a change in pattern,
type, or intensity of usual pain. Pain can start just before the period and
last throughout. Often associated with deep dyspareunia ± other symptoms, e.g. abnormal bleeding, vaginal discharge.
Assessment and management of s dysmenorrhoea Do an abdominal,
vaginal speculum, and bimanual pelvic examination. Look for tethered/
fixed uterus, uterine tenderness, masses, thickening in the posterior fornix
(associated with dyspareunia and endometriosis) and/or endocervical
polyps. Do a cervical smear if overdue and offer STI screen if sexually
active; consider referral for pelvic USS. Treat any underlying cause, else
refer for further investigation (e.g. laparoscopy, hysteroscopy).

Gynaecology

Endometriosis and adenomyosis
Endometriosis Presence of tissue histologically similar to endometrium
outside the uterine cavity and myometrium. Most commonly found in the
pelvis but can occur anywhere. Affects 10–15% of women presenting with
gynaecological symptoms. Ovarian deposits may result in chocolate cysts or
endometriomas.
Risk factors Heavy periods; frequent cycles. 0 Oral contraceptives and
pregnancy are protective.
Theories of pathogenesis
• Reflux and implantation Menstrual loss flows backwards through
Fallopian tubes into the pelvis where it implants into the peritoneum
and continues to grow under the influence of oestrogen
• Transformation/induction Peritoneal tissue transforms into
endometrium under the influence of ovarian steroids or as a result of
factors released when menstrual loss refluxes into the peritoneum
• Mechanical transplantation Endometrium transplanted from one
location to another (e.g. during surgery) will grow at that new site
• Vascular ± lymphatic spread Thought to explain distant deposits, e.g.
lungs, brain
History
• 3 cardinal symptoms: dysmenorrhoea; dyspareunia; pelvic pain
(typically, varies markedly across the menstrual cycle)
• Infertility
• Bowel/bladder symptoms
• Menorrhagia
Examination Abdominal, speculum, and bimanual pelvic examination
looking for pelvic tenderness, pelvic mass, and/or fixation of the uterus.
Occasionally tender nodules can be felt on the utero-sacral ligaments.
Investigation Offer sexually active women a STI screen. Refer for transvaginal
pelvic USS (useful to identify ovarian endometriomas but not peritoneal
disease) ± to gynaecology for laparoscopy (0 30–50% of diagnostic
laparoscopies are –ve and, if found, extent of endometriosis often does not
correlate with severity of symptoms). MRI may also be useful.
Management of infertility Refer for specialist opinion—b p. 772
• If tubal damage—options are reconstructive surgery or IVF
• If no tubal damage—laparoscopic ablation may improve fertility
Management of pain and bleeding
• Cyclical pain and/or heavy periods—NSAID, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds
prn from first day of period
• IUS d endometriosis pain with symptom control maintained >3y;
depo-medroxyprogesterone acetate injection is an alternative
• If a woman is not trying to conceive and there is no evidence of a
pelvic mass, try a progestogen (e.g. norethisterone 10–15mg/d for
≥4–6mo—starting on day 5 of each cycle—if spotting occurs i dose
to 20–25mg/d and stop once bleeding has ceased) or continuous CHC
(3 or 4 packets without a break then 7d break)
• If symptoms are not controlled—refer

Endometriosis and adenomyosis

Specialist treatments
• Medical options Include gestrinone and GnRH agonists (e.g. goserelin)
± HRT (d side effects and bone demineralization). Side effects can be
troublesome
• Surgical options Include laparoscopy or laparotomy with ablation of
lesions and division of dense adhesions; tubal surgery; hysterectomy.
Laparoscopic ablation of mild endometriosis may i fertility
0 For all forms of specialist treatment there is a 15–20% recurrence rate.
If relapse in <6mo, treatment has failed and an alternative form of treatment should be tried. If relapse in >6mo, consider the condition to have
relapsed and repeat treatment.
Psychological support Many women will have had pain for years. Often
there is delay in diagnosis of the cause—and, frequently, they have
been told it is psychosomatic. Be sympathetic and supportive and use a
cooperative strategy for management.

Adenomyosis Usually affects multiparous premenopausal women
aged >35y. Caused by extension of endometrial tissue and stroma into
the uterine myometrium. May coexist with endometriosis (15%) but a
separate entity.
Presentation May be asymptomatic, or present with dysmenorrhoea
(pain often peaks towards the end of menstruation), dyspareunia, and
menorrhagia. On examination, the uterus may be symmetrically enlarged
and tender.
Management No treatment needed if asymptomatic. Refer for further
investigation of symptoms. MRI may confirm diagnosis but diagnosis is
often only confirmed on histology after hysterectomy. Treatment is usually
surgical with hysterectomy ± bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Medical
treatment with GnRH analogues is a short-term option but symptoms
return once withdrawn unless the woman has reached the menopause
in the interim.

 Pelvic venous congestion Chronic pelvic pain due to dilation

and congestion of pelvic veins. Remains a controversial diagnosis. There is
no diagnostic test; refer to exclude PID and endometriosis. Treatment is
with progestogens, e.g. medroxyprogesterone 30mg od for 6mo, or GnRH
analogues, e.g. goserelin 3.6mg monthly for 6mo. Symptoms often recur
following treatment.

Gynaecology

Prolapse
Prolapse Pelvic organs herniate into the vagina due to poor pelvic muscle
tone and weakness of pelvic ligaments. Affects 12–30% of multiparous and
2% of nulliparous women. Good obstetric practice d risk. Risk is i by:
• Childbirth
• Coughing and straining
• Menopause
• Congenital connective tissue disorders
Terminology Named according to the organs involved:
• Cystocoele—bladder bulges into the vagina
• Urethrocoele—urethra bulges into the vagina
• Rectocoele—rectum bulges into the vagina
• Enterocoele—loops of intestine bulge into the vagina
• Uterine—uterus descends into the vagina
Uterine prolapse is further classified by degree. The most dependent portion of the prolapse is assessed whilst straining:
• 1st degree prolapse–the cervix remains in the vagina
• 2nd degree prolapse–the cervix protrudes from vagina on coughing/
straining
• 3rd degree prolapse (procidentia)–the uterus lies outside the vagina
and may ulcerate
Presentation Dragging sensation, feeling of ‘something coming down’,
or a ‘lump’. Symptoms are worse when upright, i.e. whilst awake, and
exacerbated by standing for a long time, coughing, or straining.
Associated symptoms Depending on structures involved—stress
incontinence (b p. 450), difficulty defecating, recurrent cystitis, and/or
frequency of micturition. In severe cases renal failure may occur due to
ureteric kinking.
Examination/investigation Check abdominal examination to exclude
pelvic masses. Then in left lateral position with Sims speculum, ask the
patient to bear down and watch the vaginal walls. Exclude pelvic mass by
bimanual examination. Dipstick urine ± send for M,C&S.
Management Choice of treatment depends on patient preference,
general health, degree of prolapse, severity of symptoms, and wish to
preserve fertility and sexual activity. Options include:
• Lifestyle measures Weight d; smoking cessation
• General measures Treatment of coexisting conditions exacerbating
prolapsed, e.g. chronic cough due to COPD or asthma, constipation,
menopause/atrophic vaginitis
• Physiotherapy Pelvic floor exercises (b p. 841). Refer to specialist
physiotherapy if simple self-help techniques fail
• Ring pessary Useful for those too frail for surgery, women who have
symptoms but do not want surgery or as a temporary measure whilst
awaiting surgery. Change pessary every 3–6mo. Shelf pessaries may be
useful for women who cannot retain a ring pessary—consider referral
• Surgery Refer to gynaecology if the woman is fit for surgery and
symptoms are of sufficient severity to warrant operation and/or
she has incontinence and/or recurrent UTI. Surgical options include
repair operations (anterior or posterior colporrhaphy), colpo-vaginal
suspension, and hysterectomy (vaginal or abdominal)

Prolapse

Fitting a ring pessary
• Measure the approximate size required manually—the distance
between posterior fornix and pubic bone can be measured roughly
against the index finger
• Soften the ring in hot water and lubricate it well
• Insert the ring into the posterior fornix and tuck it above
pubic bone
• Change the pessary every 3–6mo. Inspect the vagina for damage (e.g.
ulceration) before inserting the new ring
Potential problems
• Discomfort Ring may be too big (try smaller size) or atrophic
vaginitis (try topical oestrogen)
• Infection Remove, clear infection then try again
• Ulceration Remove, allow to heal, consider alternatives or reinsert
when fully healed
• Expulsion Ring may be too small, pelvic musculature indequate, or
retropubic rim unsuitable

Gynaecology

Uterine problems
Postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) Perform a pelvic examination,
including speculum examination of the cervix.
Refer urgently (to be seen in <2wk by a team specializing in
gynaecological cancer):
• All women with PMB
• Endometrial thickness >4mm on USS done for another reason
Differential diagnosis Atrophic change (most common); endometrial
hyperplasia; endometrial polyps; endometritis; endometrial malignancy
(10% referred); cervical malignancy; fibroids; uterine sarcoma;
non-genital causes (bladder and bowel).
Pelvic or abdominal mass Refer urgently for USS if abdominal/pelvic
mass that is not clearly uterine fibroids and not of GI/urological origin. If
USS is suggestive of cancer or urgent USS is not available, refer urgently.
Congenital abnormalities of the female genital tract
• Duplication Of the cervix and/or uterus; vaginal septum; bicornuate
uterus (of varying degrees). Usually found incidentally. May cause
problems in pregnancy/with IUD. Refer if needed
• Imperforate hymen May cause cryptomenorrhoea which presents as
p amenorrhoea (b p. 706). Refer for surgical release if suspected
• Ambiguous genitalia b p. 895
• Cervical incompetence b p. 816

Uterine retroversion 20% have a retroverted, retroflexed uterus.
May be difficult to palpate bimanually—push on the cervix to antevert.
Fibroids (uterine leiomyoma) Benign tumours of the smooth

muscle of the myometrium affecting 1 in 5 women. Often multiple.
Oestrogen-dependent so regress post-menopause. Named by location:
• Subserosal (bulge into peritoneum)
• Pedunculated
• Submucosal (bulge into endometrium)
• Intramural (centrally in
• Separate from uterus, especially in broad
myometrium)
ligament from embryonal remnants
• Cervical
Risk factors Nulliparity; obesity; FH of fibroids; African origin.
Presentation Usually asymptomatic. May cause:
• Pelvic pressure/discomfort and/or backache
• Menorrhagia—usually submucous fibroids distorting endometrial cavity
• Pain: torsion (pedunculated fibroid); degeneration. Red degeneration
may occur in pregnancy (pain, fever, and local tenderness)
• Urinary symptoms—may press on the bladder li frequency or a
feeling of incomplete emptying or difficulty passing urine
• Infertility—may act as a ‘natural IUCD’
• Problems in pregnancy—abnormal lie and i risk of post-partum
haemorrhage. Risk of miscarriage is not i
• Bulky uterus ± pelvic mass felt abdominally
Pelvic USS is diagnostic. Check FBC if menorrhagia. 0 Calcified fibroids
may be an incidental finding on X-ray.

Uterine problems

Management If asymptomatic/mild symptoms—no treatment needed.
Otherwise, management depends on presence of symptoms, number and
location of fibroids, fertility plans, and patient’s preferences:
• Medical—CHC or IUS d menstrual loss; GnRH analogues (maximum
use 6mo due to risk of osteopenia) and selective progesterone
receptor modulators (e.g. asoprisnil) cause fibroid shrinkage
• Surgical—Uterine artery embolization; myomectomy (removal of
fibroids only); hysteroscopic resection; hysterectomy

Endometrial proliferation Oestrogen causes endometrial prolife­
ration; progesterone causes endometrial maturation; shedding follows
withdrawal of oestrogen and progesterone. If oestrogen is given alone,
the endometrium proliferates uncontrolled, resulting in irregular and
heavy bleeding, polyps, and i risk of endometrial carcinoma. Caused by
anovulatory cycles or administration of unopposed oestrogen.
Endometrial cancer In the UK, ~7,700 women each year are diagnosed
with endometrial cancer (5% of all 5 cancers). It is predominantly a disease
of postmenopausal women with 93% of cases diagnosed in women >50y
(peak age 70–74y). Risk factors:
• Drugs—unopposed oestrogen, tamoxifen
• Age
• Granulosa cell ovarian tumour
• Obesity
• FH—of breast, ovary, or colon cancer
•	Nulliparity
• Previous pelvic irradiation
• Late menopause
• Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer
• DM
Risk is d with current or past use of the COC pill and/or progestogens.
Presentation 15% are asymptomatic. Most present with PMB (75–80%)—
any woman presenting with PMB has endometrial carcinoma until proven
otherwise. Premenopausally tends to occur in overweight women and
present with continual bleeding. Rarely detected on cervical smear.
Management Refer any woman with PMB to gynaecology for further
investigation. Assessment comprises transvaginal USS to look at endometrial
thickness ± endometrial sampling with pipelle or hysteroscopy.
Treatment TAH and BSO ± radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy
depending on the likelihood of recurrence. Survival depends on the age
of the patient and stage/grade of the tumour. Stage I disease—85% 5y
survival; stage IV—25% 5y survival.
Endometritis Acute infection of the endometrium. Uncommon
amongst premenopausal women. Usually occurs after surgery (including
IUCD insertion) or childbirth. Presents with fever, lower abdominal pain,
uterine tenderness, and/or purulent discharge (may be blood stained).
Take high vaginal/endocervical swabs for M,C&S (including chlamydia).
Management Treat with antibiotics, e.g. doxycycline 100mg bd for 14d +
metronidazole 400mg bd for 1wk or azithromycin 1g stat for chlamydia.
Pyometra is a complication (uterine cavity fills with pus)—suspect if endometritis fails to clear and refer to gynaecology urgently.

Gynaecology

Ovarian disease
Refer urgently to gynaecology (to be seen in <2wk) if ascites
or suspected ovarian mass on abdominal/pelvic examination.N
Check CA125N (0 particularly if >50y) if a woman reportsN
•	New IBS >50y
• Unexplained weight d, fatigue, or change in bowel habit
• Any of the following >12x/mo:
• Feeling full (‘early satiety’) and/
• Persistent abdominal
or loss of appetite
distension (‘bloating’)
• i urinary frequency/urgency
• Pelvic/abdominal pain
If CA125 is ≥35iu/mL refer for USS. If suspected ovarian cancer on USS
refer urgently to gynaecology (to be seen in <2wk).
If CA125 <35iu/mL consider investigating other causes of symptoms.
Causes of i CA125
• 1% of healthy individuals
• Cancer—ovarian cancer (i in 85% with epithelial ovarian cancer);
other intra-abdominal cancers
•	Non-malignant conditions, e.g. endometriosis, PID, menstruation, DM,
CCF, pleural effusion, liver disease, diverticulitis, appendicitis, ascites

Ovarian tumours May be solid or cystic. In 5 of reproductive age, >80%
are benign. In postmenopausal women, the proportion of malignant ovarian
tumours is 50%. Classified according to tissue of origin:
• Tumours of surface epithelium—60%—see Table 21.4
• Germ cell tumours—15–25%
• Gonadal stromal tumours—5–10%
• Metastatic (from breast, stomach, colon, or genital tract)—5–10%
0 Early tumours are often asymptomatic and may be an incidental finding
on abdominal/pelvic examination or USS done for another reason.
Simple, physiological, or functional cysts Common and often
incidental finding on USS in premenopausal women. May cause pain due to
tension within the cyst, rupture, torsion, or bleeding into the cyst.
• Follicular cyst An ovarian follicle fails to rupture. Unilocular and can
reach a diameter of 10cm. Usually regress during the subsequent cycle.
More common in women using progesterone-only contraception
• Luteal cyst Forms if there is excessive bleeding into the corpus
luteum. May be tender, cause abdominal pain (sometimes acute
abdomen), and delay the next period
Management
• Premenopausal—check CA125 and refer to gynaecology if
multilocular/solid elements; >8cm diameter; or <8cm diameter but
fails to regress in <6wk. Urgent referral if CA125 ≥35iu/mL
• If postmenopausal—refer to gyanecology (urgent if CA125 ≥35iu/mL
or any sinister features on USS)

Gynaecology

Ovarian cancer and polycystic ovaries
Refer urgently to gynaecology (to be seen in <2wk)N if ascites
or ovarian mass on abdominal/pelvic examinationN.

Check CA125 (0 particularly if >50y) if a woman reportsN
•	New IBS >50y
• Unexplained weight d, fatigue, or change in bowel habit
• Any of the following >12x/mo:
• Feeling full (‘early satiety’) and/
• Persistent abdominal
or loss of appetite
distension (‘bloating’)
• i urinary frequency/urgency
• Pelvic/abdominal pain
If CA125 is ≥35iu/mL Refer for USS. If suspected ovarian cancer on USS,
refer urgently to gynaecology (to be seen in <2wk).
If CA125 <35iu/mL Consider investigating other causes of symptoms.

Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) 90% of ovarian cancers. 7,000
cases are diagnosed each year in the UK (2.5% of all cancers) and ovarian
cancer accounts for 6% of 5 deaths. In the UK, 780% of patients with ovarian cancer have had symptoms for <4wk before seeing their GP.
Risk factors
• Age Peak age 50–70y; 85% ovarian cancers occur in 5 >50y
• Family history 10% of cancers occur in women with FH. 3–4x i risk if
one first-degree relative with ovarian cancer—but only 40% of familial
cancer is explained by known gene mutations (e.g. BRCA1/2)
• Reproductive factors Greater exposure to ovulation i risk (e.g.
infertility, nulliparity, low parity)
• Lifestyle i risk with obesity and smoking (mucinous tumours only)
• Other medical problems Breast cancer aged <40y (4x i risk); cervical
cancer (if radiotherapy); endometriosis; benign ovarian cysts
• Other factors Height >1.7m; long-term perineal use of talcum powder
(); asbestos exposure
Protective factors Pregnancy—the more pregnancies, the lower the risk;
COC pill—d risk by 60%—protective effect is maintained >20y after the
COC pill has been discontinued; breastfeeding—may d risk by 20%; tubal
ligation—d risk by 30–70%; hysterectomy—d risk by 50%.
Prevention Ovarian cancer fulfils some criteria for population screening.
Trials are currently underway in the UK. Meanwhile, high-risk women
(with ≥2 same-side family members with breast/ovarian cancer aged <50y)
may be referred for specialist gynaecology and/or genetic advice ± for
laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.
Treatment Specialist management is with laparotomy ± adjuvant treatment
with chemotherapy. Prognosis: stage I—92% 5y survival; stage IV (distant
metastases—40% new diagnoses)—6% 5y survival.
Sex-cord stromal tumours, e.g. thecomas, fibromas, Sertoli/Leydig cell
or granulosa cell tumours. Usually present early with symptoms of hormone
production, e.g. precocious puberty, PMB, or virilism. Granulosa cell tumours
are linked with endometrial hyperplasia/carcinoma.

Ovarian cancer and polycystic ovaries

Germ-cell tumours, e.g. mature teratoma (ovarian dermoid cyst),
immature teratoma, dysgerminoma, endodermal sinus tumour (yolk sac
tumour), mixed germ-cell tumour. Peak incidence in early 20s. Most are
unilateral. Associated with i AFP and i β-HCG (both are used as tumour
markers). Prognosis is good with the majority cured.
Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) or Stein–Leventhal syndrome. Up to 1 in 3 premenopausal women have polycystic ovaries on
USS—1 in 3 of those women have PCOS. Cause is unknown—often there
is a family history. Diagnosis requires presence of ≥2 of:
• Oligomenorrhoea and/or anovulation
• Hyperandrogenism—clinical and/or biochemical
• Polycystic ovaries—defined as the presence of ≥12 follicles in each
ovary measuring 2–9mm in diameter and/or ovarian volume >10cm3
Symptoms and signs May be asymptomatic or have ≥1 of:
• Menstrual irregularity—oligomenorrhoea/amenorrhoea (affects 67%—
more common if BMI ≥30kg/m2), dysfunctional uterine bleeding
• Anovulatory infertility
• Acne
• Male pattern
• Central obesity
• Hirsutism
baldness
Investigations
• USS ovaries >12 cysts of 2–9mm in diameter (string of pearls sign)
• Blood i testosterone (>2.5nmol/L—if >4.8 nmol/L, exclude other
causes of androgen hypersecretion, e.g. tumour, Cushing’s syndrome),
d sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)
Complications Insulin resistance—2x i incidence of DM; i CVD risk—
central body fat distribution, obesity, i BP, i triglycerides, d HDL; 3x i
risk of stroke/TIA; i endometrial cancer risk; obstructive sleep apnoea.
Management In all cases, encourage weight d and exercise.
• If oligomenorrhoeic consider progestogens to induce a withdrawal
bleed every 2–3mo to d risk of endometrial hyperplasia
• Consider the COC pill to regulate menstruation; COC pills with
anti-androgen (e.g. co-cyprindiol) may d acne/hirsutism
• Consider offering annual HbA1c/FBG check—particularly if obese (BMI
>30), FH of DM, or aged >40y. Screen pregnant women with PCOS
for gestational DM with a GTT at <20wk gestation (b p. 828)
• Clomifene can be used to induce ovulation—b p. 772
• Metformin (unlicensed) may be helpful for insulin sensitivity and
menstrual disturbance. Also used for infertility if clomifene has failed
• Hirsutism—b p. 342

Gynaecology

Conditions of the cervix
Refer urgently (to be seen in <2wk) To gynaecology:
• If clinical features of cervical cancer. Do not perform a cervical
smear before referral or delay referral due to previous –ve smear
• If ascites or pelvic mass of abdominal/pelvic examination
• All patients with postmenopausal bleeding who are not taking HRT
• Patients on HRT with persistent or unexplained postmenopausal
bleeding after cessation of HRT for 6wk
• All patients taking tamoxifen with postmenopausal bleeding
Consider urgent referral If persistent intermenstrual bleeding and
negative pelvic examination.
Perform a full pelvic examination including speculum examination
of the cervix, for patients with:
• Postmenopausal bleeding
• Alterations in menstrual cycle
• Vaginal discharge
• Intermenstrual bleeding
• Post-coital bleeding
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) Pre-malignant change of the

cervical epithelium. The majority of these changes are found in asymptomatic
women <45y (peak incidence 25–29y). CIN is a histological diagnosis resulting
from biopsy—usually following an abnormal smear.
• CIN 1 Mild/moderate dysplasia—nuclear atypia confined to basal third
of the epithelium. 0 CIN 1 may revert to normality
• CIN 2 Nuclear atypia in basal two-thirds of the epithelium
• CIN 3—Severe dysplasia/carcinoma in situ—full thickness epithelial
nuclear abnormalities
Treatment Depends on grade of histological abnormality. For women
with high-grade lesions (CIN 2/3) treatment options include ablation,
excision (large loop excision of the transformation zone or LLETZ, knife
cone biopsy), or hysterectomy.
Cervical cancer In the UK, 3,378 women each year are diagnosed
with cervical cancer (2% of all 5 cancers). Almost exclusively occurs in
women who are/have been sexually active. 2 peaks of incidence—women
in their late 30s and 70s/80s. 80% are squamous cell cancer—the remainder adeno­carcinoma. Incidence is dropping probably due to the cervical
cancer screening programme and changes in sexual practices.
Risk factors
• Low social class
•
• Smoking
•
• Early age of 1st intercourse
• Early age of 1st pregnancy
• Multiple sexual partners
•
• HPV infection (types 16, 18, 31, and 33)

History of dyskaryosis
Method of contraception
(d with barrier methods; i if
>5y COC use)
Immunosuppression, HIV

Presentation May be found on routine cervical screening. Symptoms
include post-coital, intermenstrual, postmenopausal bleeding, and/or
offensive vaginal discharge. Speculum examination may reveal cervical
ulceration/mass or a cervix that bleeds easily.

Conditions of the cervix

Management Refer urgently to gynaecology. Treatment is with surgery ±
radiotherapy depending on the stage of the disease:
• Stage 1 Microinvasive cancer (A) or cancer confined in the cervix (B).
65% women present at stage 1. 5y survival 780–99%
• Stage 2 Invasion into the upper third of the vagina (A) or parametria
(B) but not to the pelvic side wall. 5y survival 760–90%
• Stage 3 Extension to the lower third of the vagina (A) or pelvic side
wall (B). 5y survival 830–50%.
• Stage 4 Tumour involving bladder/rectum (A) or extrapelvic spread
(B). 5y survival 720%
Prevention of cervical cancer A vaccination programme targeting
girls aged 12–13y is currently underway in the UK to protect them against
the strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer b p. 749.

Cervical screening b p. 728
Cervical erosion/ectropion Physiological. An erosion or ectropion

is the area of columnar epithelium visible within the vagina when the
squamo-columnar junction moves down the cervix at times of high
oestrogen exposure (e.g. pregnancy, CHC, puberty). Only treat if:
• Abnormal cervical smear, or
• Symptoms are causing problems, e.g. post-coital or intermenstrual
bleeding, or excess discharge—refer to gynaecologist for cautery. If
using the CHC, consider switching to an alternative

Nabothian cysts Cervical mucus retention cysts. Usually asympto­
matic—no treatment needed. Refer for cautery if troublesome discharge.
Cervicitis Presents with vaginal discharge, intermenstrual/post-coital
bleeding, and/or pain. Speculum examination shows mucopurulent discharge
and inflamed, friable cervix. Causes: Chlamydia (50%), gonococcus, and HSV.
Investigate with swabs for M,C&S, and treat the cause.
Cervical polyps Develop from the endocervix and protrude into the

vagina through the external os. Usually asymptomatic although there may
be i vaginal discharge and the lowest part of the polyp may ulcerate
and bleed causing intermenstrual, postmenopausal, and/or post-coital
bleeding. The vast majority are benign.
Treatment Avulsion (send for histology). Cauterize base with silver nitrate
stick if possible. Frequently recur. If postmenopausal, intermenstrual, or
post-coital bleeding, refer to gynaecology to exclude other pathology.

Cervical cancer screening
Screening prevents 71,000–4,000 deaths/y in the UK from squamous cell
cancer of the cervix.
Taking a smear Ensure adequate training—poor smear-taking misses
20% abnormalities. Courses are available—update skills every 3y. Give
all women information about the test, condition being sought, possible
results of screening, and their implications.
Liquid-based cytology (LBC) Cells are collected from the cervix with
a brush; the head of the brush is either broken off or rinsed into a vial
containing preservative fluid before going to the laboratory for examination.
LBC d the number of inadequate smears taken as cervical cells can be
examined even if the sample is contaminated with blood, pus, or mucus.

Timing Avoid menstruation if possible (note on the request form if
unavoidable). Ideal time is mid-cycle. Routine bimanual examination is
unnecessary—only do if clinically indicated (e.g. painful/heavy periods).
Screening interval See Table 21.5.
Organization of the cervical screening programme Practices
undertaking cervical screening must:
• Provide information to eligible women to allow them to make an
informed decision about taking part in the programme
• Perform the cervical screening test (and ensure staff are properly
trained and equipped to perform the test)
• Arrange for women to be informed about the results of their tests
(see Tables 21.6 and 21.7)
• Ensure that results are followed up appropriately, and
• Maintain records of tests carried out, results, and follow-up
HPV testing Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) 16, 18, 31,
and 33 is associated with CIN/cervical cancer. 99.7% of cervical cancers
contain HPV DNA and women with HPV infection are 70x more likely to
develop high-grade cervical abnormalities. HPV triage tests cells from LBC
samples with borderline or low-grade abnormalities for high-risk HPV.
Those that test –ve are returned to normal recall; those that test +ve are
referred for colposcopy. HPV testing is also used as a test-of-cure after
treatment for CIN.

Gynaecology

Vaginal and vulval problems
Refer urgently (to be seen in <2wk) to gynaecology If
un­explained vulval lump or vulval bleeding due to ulceration.

Vulval pruritus/pain It is reasonable to treat in primary care. Follow-up

until symptoms resolve or diagnosis is confirmed. If symptoms persist,
refer—urgency depends on symptoms/concern about cancer.

Symptoms/signs
• Vaginal discharge/infection—b p. 736
• Vulval ulceration—genital ulcers (b p. 735)
Vulval itching (pruritus vulvae) Treat the cause: infection (e.g. candida,
HSV, warts, threadworms, pubic lice, scabies); atrophic vulvitis; vulval
dystrophy; vulval carcinoma; poor hygiene; skin conditions (e.g. eczema).
0 Always exclude iron deficiency as a cause of itching.
Vulval lumps Common and usually benign.
• General causes Sebaceous cyst; varicose veins; haematoma; benign
skin tumour (lipoma, papilloma, etc.); malignant skin tumour (1º or 2º)
• Specific causes Bartholin’s gland cyst/abscess; urethral caruncle;
endometriosis; carcinoma of the vulva; inguinal hernia
0 Remember skin conditions (e.g. eczema, psoriasis) as a cause of vulval
skin abnormalities.
Atrophic vaginitis Vaginal soreness, dyspareunia, and occasional spotting.
The vagina looks pale and dry. Treat with topical oestrogens (usually nightly
for 2wk, then 2x/wk for ≥3mo) or consider other HRT. 0 Refer women
with postmenopausal bleeding for assessment—b p. 721.
Vaginal cysts May arise from remnants of the mesonephric ducts
(anterolaterally) or following surgery or episiotomy (posterior, lower
third). Usually no treatment is needed. If symptomatic or large, refer to
gynaecology for assessment ± removal.
Benign vaginal tumours Benign leiomyomas or fibromyomas are
common. Refer for surgical removal.
Vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia (VAIN) Multifocal. Occurs in
the upper third of the vagina—usually in association with CIN (b p. 726).
May be asymptomatic or present with post-coital bleeding or abnormal
vaginal discharge. Treatment is by local ablation.
Vaginal cancer Rare—most common >70y; 90% are squamous cell—
the rest clear cell (associated with in utero stilboestrol), s tumour, or
sarcoma. Presents with postmenopausal bleeding. Refer to gynaecology to
be seen in <2wk. Treated with surgery (early stages) and/or radiotherapy.
Bartholin’s gland swellings Painless vulval swelling due to obstruction
of a Bartholin’s gland duct l cyst formation. If infected, an abscess forms
causing a painful, tender, red vulval lump. Cysts resolve spontaneously.
Abscesses may resolve with antibiotics (if early) or discharge themselves.
If not, admit for surgery (marsupialization).
Urethral caruncle Postmenopausal prolapse of the posterior urethral
wall. Reddened area involving the posterior margin of the urethral opening.
Usually asymptomatic—rarely bleeds or causes dyspareunia. Treat with
topical oestrogen. Refer for surgery if symptoms persist.

Vaginal and vulval problems

Vulvodynia Chronic vulval pain without obvious cause. Common (4%
of 5) and may be generalized or localized. Treatment:
• Topical Avoid irritants e.g. bubblebath—use soap substitute (e.g.
aqueous cream) and topical moisturizer. Lidocaine gel/cream 5% may
control pain during intercourse (apply 10min before)
• Oral Amitriptyline (10–75mg)—start with low dose and titrate i
slowly; if ineffective or side effects, consider adding/substituting with
pregabalin—b p. 218
• Refer If causing significant distress and not responding to treatment
Vulval dystrophy Associated with small risk of malignant change
(<5%). Presents with vulval itching and/or soreness. Changes do not
extend into the vagina. Classification:
• Hypoplastic (lichen sclerosus) Peak age 45–60y. Most common vulval
dystrophy. 25% have a family/personal history of autoimmune disease,
e.g. vitiligo, thyroid disease. Vulval skin looks atrophic ± white plaques
(leukoplakia). 20% have white patches elsewhere on the body, but
often these are asymptomatic
• Hyperplasic Usually affects postmenopausal women. There are
multiple, symmetrical, thickened, hyperkeratotic lesions on the vulva
Management Treat with topical steroids—e.g. clobetasol propionate
ointment od for 1mo, then alternate days for 1mo, then 2x/wk for 1mo.
Refer to gynaecology/dermatology for biopsy if uncertain of diagnosis, no
improvement with steroid treatment after 1mo, residual symptoms after
3mo or other lesions develop (e.g. vulval lump, other skin changes or
ulceration). Symptoms may recur after treatment has stopped; retreat.
Vulval intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN) Some overlap with vulval
dystrophy and may be associated with other genital tract neoplasia (e.g.
CIN—b p. 726). Presents with abnormal vulval skin (pinky white +
altered texture) ± white patches ± itch. Diagnosis is histological following
skin biopsy and graded from VIN 1 (thickened epidermis—epithelial atypia
in basal third only) to VIN 3 (carcinoma in situ/Bowen’s disease with full
thickness nuclear atypia). Refer patients with abnormal vulval skin (without
candidal infection or other obvious cause) to gynaecology for skin biopsy.
Treatment depends on site, histology, and extent.
Vulval carcinomaG Rare—most common >70y. Most are squamous
cell carcinoma; others—melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, Bartholin’s
gland carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. The majority occur on the labia
and spread to local LNs. Present early with chronic pruritus vulvae,
vulval lump, or ulcer. Refer for confirmation of diagnosis. Treatment is
surgical—5y survival rate ~95%.

Sexual health and contraception

Assessment of sexual health
Good communication skills are particularly important for clinicians when
discussing sexual health problems and may improve health outcomes.
Ensure a comfortable, private, and confidential environment.

General assessment Objectives are to:
• Establish a constructive relationship with the patient to enable patient
and doctor to communicate effectively and serve as the basis for any
subsequent therapeutic relationship
• Determine whether the patient has a sexual health problem and, if so,
what that is
• Find out (where possible) what caused that problem
• Assess the patient’s emotions and attitudes towards the problem. Be
aware of signs of anxiety/distress. Recognize non-verbal cues
• Establish how it might be treated

History Use open questions at the start becoming directive when necessary—clarify, reflect, facilitate, listen. Ask about:
Presenting complaint Chronological account and concerns. If appropriate,
ask about:
• Vaginal or urethral discharge
• Dysuria/other urinary symptoms
• Dyspareunia—pain on intercourse (b p. 714)
• Erectile dysfunction—b p. 776
• Genital skin problems—soreness, itching, ulceration, warts
• Perianal/anal symptoms
• Other symptoms, e.g. pelvic/abdominal/groin pain, deformity of the
penis, haematospermia (blood in the ejaculate), retrograde ejaculation
Past medical history
• Similar symptoms—for suspected sexually transmitted infections
(STIs), ask about previous STI, date of diagnosis, and treatment
• Obstetric history for women
• Urological problems and treatments or pelvic surgery
• Chronic medical problems—endocrine; cardiovascular; DM
• Medical treatment abroad—in certain countries, may be associated
with i HIV/hepatitis risk
• HIV testing/hepatitis B vaccination history
Drugs
• Prescription drugs, e.g. drugs associated with erectile dysfunction
• Illicit drugs—may be associated with erectile dysfunction, and history
of injecting drug misuse is associated with i hepatitis/HIV risk
• Allergies
Sexual history Current sexual partner (person with whom the patient had
last sexual intercourse) and other recent sexual partners—if appropriate,
ask about:
• Nature of relationship with partner—long-term partner; casual partner
who could/could not be traced; paid-for partner
• Gender of partner

Assessment of sexual health

• Nature of intercourse—oral, vaginal, anal
• Contraception? Method used. Does the patient use a condom (male
or female) regularly and consistently? Did it remain in place and intact?
• For women, establish date of LMP, cycle length, and regularity
• Symptoms in partner?
0 For suspected STI, ask about all partners within the previous 3mo or
incubation period of the suspected infection (if longer). If no partners are
reported, note the last time the patient had sexual intercourse.
Social history
• Smoker?
• Alcohol consumption
• Travel abroad—if suspected STI, ask whether the patient had sexual
intercourse abroad other than with their travelling partner, and
with whom
Attitudes and beliefs
• How does the patient see the problem?
• What does he/she think is wrong?
• How does he/she think his/her partner views the situation?
• What does the patient want you to do about it?

Examination Examine the external genitalia and perianal area. Check

groins for lymphadenopathy if STI is suspected. For women, perform pelvic and vaginal speculum examination. Consider digital rectal examination
if indicated.
• Explain the need for, and offer a suitably medically qualified chaperone
for the examination of all patients. Record if a chaperone is declined.

Action
• Summarize the history back to the patient and give an opportunity for
the patient to fill in any gaps
• Check that the patient has no other concerns
• Draw up a problem list and outline a management plan. Further
investigations and interventions are guided by the findings on history
and examination—so a good history and examination is essential
• Set a review date

Genital ulcers Causes: genital herpes; primary syphilis; Behçet’s syn-

drome. If history of foreign travel, partner from abroad, or doubt about
diagnosis refer to GUM clinic.

Sexual health and contraception

Vaginal discharge
All women have some vaginal discharge. Physiological discharge varies
considerably and is affected by the menstrual cycle.
• Before ovulation—mucus is clearer, wetter, stretchy, and slippery
• After ovulation—mucus is thicker and stickier
Causes of ‘abnormal’ discharge 5 causes account for 95% cases:
• Cervicitis (gonococcal,
• Excessive normal secretions
chlamydial, or herpetic)
• Bacterial vaginosis (BV)
• Trichomonas vaginalis (TV)
• Candida albicans
Rarer causes Cervical ectropion/polyp; IUCD/IUS; chemical vaginitis
(avoid perfumed or disinfectant bath additives and vaginal douches);
foreign body (e.g. retained tampon—remove and treat with metronidazole
400mg tds for 7d); genital tract tumour; fistula.

History Ask about:
• Symptoms Vaginal discharge (itchy, offensive, colour, duration), vulval
soreness and irritation, lower abdominal pain, dyspareunia, heavy
periods, intermenstrual bleeding, fever, vulval pain
• Sexual history Recent sexual contact with new partner, multiple
partners, presence of symptoms in partner, worries about STIs
• Medical history Pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, recent antibiotics
• Attempts at self-medication
Examination Always offer examination if:
• High risk for STI—age <25y; new sexual partner or >1 sexual partner
in the past year; diagnosis of STI in the past 12mo
• Upper reproductive tract symptoms—abnormal bleeding (heavy,
post-coital ± intermenstrual); pelvic/abdominal pain; deep
dyspareunia; fever
• Pregnant, postpartum, or after miscarriage/termination
• After instrumentation (e.g. insertion of IUS/IUCD, after colposcopy)
• Recurrent infection or failed treatment
• Requesting examination/STI testing
Do an abdominal, bimanual pelvic, and vaginal speculum examination.
Look for tenderness on lower abdominal or bimanual palpation, cervical
erosion/contact bleeding, discharge, foreign bodies, warts, or ulcers.
Investigation Check pH of secretions with narrow-range pH paper. If
>4.5, BV or TV is likely; pH is �4.5 with physiological discharge and candida infection. Other investigations to consider:
• High vaginal swab for M,C&S—only if symptoms/signs and/or pH
consistent with specific diagnosis; the patient is pregnant, postpartum,
or after miscarriage/termination; after instrumentation; or if there is
recurrent infection/treatment has failed
• Endocervical swabs for gonorrhoea and chlamydia
• Viral swab if herpes is suspected (if not available, refer to GUM)
• Opportunistic cervical smear if indicated (b p. 728)
• Self-taken vulvovaginal swab if examination is declined
Management Treat the cause. If unclear refer to GUM or gynaecology.

Vaginal discharge

Sexually transmitted infections b p. 738
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) Vaginal flora is changed from Lactobacillus

species to anaerobes. Not sexually transmitted. Affects 10–40% of
premenopausal women—about half are asymptomatic. Associated with:
• i risk of preterm delivery (and d risk if treated)
• Development of PID and endometritis following abortion or birth
• Infection post-hysterectomy
Presentation Grey/white, thin, fishy-smelling, offensive discharge with no
vulval soreness. On examination, the cervix looks normal; pH of secretions
is >4.5. HVS for M,C&S may confirm diagnosis but treat without swab if
no examination is carried out, or pH is >4.5 and typical clinical picture.

ManagementG Without treatment, 50% remit spontaneously. Cure rate
with all methods is 785%. There is no benefit from treating the woman’s
partner. Treatment:
• Metronidazole 400mg bd for 5–7d or 2g single dose
• Clindamycin 2% cream 5g nocte pv for 1wk
• Recurrent infection—X suppressive therapy using metronidazole
400mg bd for 6d to cover each period, metronidazole 0.75% gel 2x/
wk pv for 4–6mo, lactic acid gel alternate nights for >1mo, and pv
probiotics are all but robust evidence of effectiveness is lacking

Candidiasis (thrush) Fungal infection—~20% of patients are asymptomatic. Predisposing factors include:
• Cushing’s or Addison’s disease • Immunosuppression • DM
• Pregnancy
• Steroid treatment
• Broad-spectrum antibiotics
• Vaginal trauma
• Radiotherapy/chemotherapy
Presentation Well, pruritus vulvae, superficial dyspareunia, and/or thick,
creamy, non-offensive discharge. Examination: discharge (cottage cheese)
and sore vulva which may be cracked/fissured. Investigation is usually
unnecessary. Confirm diagnosis if infection persists or recurs by sending a
swab from the anterior fornix for M,C&S.
ManagementG Only treat if symptomatic. Sexual transmission is minimal;
there is no benefit from treating the partner unless overt infection:
• Try clotrimazole pessaries—cure rate ~90%
• Alternative is oral fluconazole 150mg stat, repeated after 3d if severe
infection. Contraindicated in pregnancy or lactation—83% cure rate
Recurrent infectionG Advise loose, cotton underwear and avoidance of
soaps, perfumes, or disinfectants in the bath. Consider vulval emollients
to treat associated dermatitis. If �4 documented episodes (�2 confirmed
with microbiology) in a year, treat with fluconazole 150mg every 3d x3,
then 150mg weekly for 6mo.

chapter 22

Sexual health and contraception

Sexually transmitted infection
GPs are frequently presented with symptoms/signs either presented directly
or found incidentally (e.g. when doing a cervical smear) that may indicate sexually transmitted infection (STI). The easiest (and often best) option is to refer
suspected cases to a genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic. Sometimes the
patient is reluctant to go and 40% referrals never attend, so it is still necessary
for GPs to know how to prevent, diagnose, and treat STI themselves.

Contact tracing Best done by GUM clinics. If a patient refuses to go,

then provide him/her with a letter to give to contacts stating the disease
he/she has been in contact with, treatment given, and suggesting contacts
visit their local GUM clinic promptly.

Use of GUM clinics In general, refer patients:
•
•
•
•
•

Who require contact tracing
If counselling is needed, e.g. first attack of HSV, HIV
If diagnosis is still unclear after investigation
For confirmation of diagnosis, e.g. HSV
If specialist treatment is required, e.g. treatment of genital warts
Prevention of STIs NICE recommends:
• Identification of high-risk patients opportunistically in general practice,
e.g. at new patient checks, when attending for travel advice
• One-to-one discussions with those at i risk of STIs lasting 15–20min,
structured on the basis of behaviour change theories to d risk-taking
High-risk groups Include patients with STIs; men who have had sex
with other men; people who have come from/visited areas of high HIV
prevalence; substance/alcohol misuse; early onset of sexual activity;
unprotected sex; and frequent change of/multiple partners.
Young people from vulnerable groups (e.g. from disadvantaged
backgrounds; in/leaving local authority care; low educational attainment).
Should be offered one-to-one sessions aimed at educating them about
sexual health and contraception.
Chlamydia screening A screening programme for the under 25s is
currently in operation in the UK (b p. 740).
Vaccination A vaccine targeting the most common forms of HPV causing
cervical cancer is now available in the UK. The target population is
girls aged 12–14y before they become sexually active (b p. 749), but
potentially any sexually active woman could benefit.
Prevention of HIV b p. 744
Vaginal discharge b p. 736
Acute pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) May be asymptomatic.
Peak age 15–25y. >10% develop tubal infertility after 1 episode; 50% after
3 episodes. Risk of ectopic pregnancy i x10 after a single episode. Only
70% of those with acute PID clinically have diagnosis confirmed on laparoscopy. Most cases of PID are associated with STI—usually chlamydia
(50%) or gonorrhoea. In 20% no cause is found.

Sexually transmitted infection

History
• Abnormal vaginal bleeding—
• Fever >38oC and malaise
heavier periods, intermenstrual
• Acute pelvic pain (usually
and/or post-coital bleeding
bilateral) and deep dyspareunia
• Purulent vaginal discharge
• Dysuria
Examination Pyrexia, bilateral lower abdominal tenderness, vaginal
discharge, cervical excitation, and adnexal tenderness.
Investigations Consider swabs (HVS and endocervical swab for M,C&S
and chlamydia/gonorrhoea screen) and blood tests (FBC—may show
leucocytosis; i ESR/CRP).
ManagementG Admit if very unwell, pregnant, or if ectopic pregnancy or
other acute surgical emergency cannot be excluded. Otherwise:
• Advise rest and sexual abstinence; provide analgesia
• Treat with ofloxacin 400mg bd and metronidazole 400mg bd for 14d;
alternative is ceftriaxone 500mg IM as a single dose, followed by oral
doxycycline 100mg bd and oral metronidazole 400mg bd for 14d
• If the patient has an IUCD consider removal, but only if symptoms are
severe. If removed advise re alternative contraception and emergency
contraception if sexual intercourse <7d ago
• Arrange contact tracing via GUM clinic
• If no improvement after 48h, admit; if slow recovery, consider referral
for laparoscopy to exclude abscess formation
Chronic PID Caused by inadequately treated acute PID. Presents
with pelvic pain, dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia (1 in 5) ± menorrhagia.
Examination: lower abdominal/pelvic tenderness, cervical excitation ±
adnexal mass. Screen for chlamydia and gonorrhoea. A –ve result does
not exclude diagnosis. If chronic pelvic pain with no obvious cause, refer
to gynaecology. Once diagnosis is confirmed treatment options include
long-term antibiotics or surgery.
Urethritis Inflammation of the male urethra. Multifactorial condition
primarily sexually acquired. Mucopurulent cervicitis is the female equivalent. Characterized by discharge and/or dysuria although may be asymptomatic (found when a swab is taken following contact tracing). Treat the
cause. Classified by the organisms grown:
Gonococcal urethritis N. gonorrhoeae is identified on urethral swab. Treat
as for gonorrhoea (b p. 740).
Non-gonococcal urethritis Most common organisms identified
are: chlamydia (30–50%); Ureaplasma (10%); Mycoplasma genitalium
(10%); Trichomonas vaginalis (1–17%). In 20–30% no organism is isolated.
First-line treatment is with azithromycin 1g stat. If persistent/recurrent
symptoms, treat with azithromycin 500mg stat, then 250mg od for 4d and
metronidazole 400mg bd for 5d.

Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomonas
• A single individual may have >1 STI simultaneously.

Chlamydia Major cause of pelvic pain and infertility in women.
Screening Chlamydia is a preventable cause of infertility, ectopic pregnancy,
and pelvic inflammatory disease. Screening using urine testing or self-taken
swabs d prevalence and incidence of pelvic inflammatory diseaseS. Screening
programmes aimed at young people <25y are in operation throughout the UK.
Self-test kits are available through GP surgeries, sexual health/contraception
clinics, and community venues (e.g. schools).
Presentation in men Usually asymptomatic. May have urethritis. Send
urethral swab or first-catch urine sample for nucleic acid amplification
testing (NAAT) to confirm diagnosis.
Presentation in women
• History >70% are asymptomatic. Symptoms: vaginal discharge (30%);
post-coital or intermenstrual bleeding; pelvic inflammatory disease
(10–30%—b p. 738); dysuria
• Examination Mucopurulent cervicitis; hyperaemia and oedema of the
cervix ± contact bleeding; tender adnexae; cervical excitation
• Investigation Send endocervical (if symptoms) or self-taken
vulvovaginal swab (if asymptomatic) for NAAT to confirm diagnosis
0 If 4 or 5 and exposed to potential infection <2wk previously, repeat
test >2wk after exposure.
Management
• Doxycycline 100mg bd for 1wk or erythromycin 500mg qds for 14d;
azithromycin 1g stat po is an alternative which ensures compliance
• During pregnancy/breastfeeding use erythromycin 500mg qds for 2wk
• Consider supplying home-testing kits to patients at high risk of STIs
Presentation in neonates Conjunctivitis, pneumonia, otitis
media, pharyngitis—1 in 3 affected mothers have affected
babies. Seek specialist advice if suspected.

Gonorrhoea Transmission: 4—1 in 5 exposures; 5—1 in 2 exposures.
Presentation in men Depends on site of infection:
• Urethral infection (<10% are asymptomatic). Urethral discharge
(80%); dysuria (50%) 2–5d after exposure; prostatitis; urethral stricture
• Rectal infection (usually asymptomatic). Anal discharge (12%); anal/
perianal pain or discomfort (7%)
• Pharyngeal infection (>90% asymptomatic)
If asymptomatic—send first-catch urine sample for NAAT; if symptomatic
send urethral ± rectal ± pharyngeal swabs (as appropriate) for NAAT and
M,C&S to confirm diagnosis.
Presentation in women Infection may be asymptomatic (50%) or cause
vaginal discharge (50%), lower abdominal pain; dysuria but not frequency
(25%); abnormal vaginal bleeding; pelvic inflammatory disease; abscess of

Chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and trichomonas

Bartholin’s gland; miscarriage; or preterm labour. Rectal and pharyngeal
infections are usually asymptomatic.
• If asymptomatic—send self-taken vulvovaginal swab for NAAT
• If symptomatic—send endocervical swab ± rectal ± pharyngeal swab
(as appropriate) for NAAT and M,C&S to confirm diagnosis
ManagementG
• Ceftriaxone 500mg IM as a single dose + azithromycin 1g stat po
• Refer to GUM for contact tracing
• If persisting symptoms/signs after treatment, test for cure with swabs
sent for M,C&S >72h after completion of therapy
• If asymptomatic following treatment, test for cure 2wk after treatment
completion with NAAT, followed by culture if NAAT-positive
• If persistent infection, seek specialist advice

Trichomonas vaginalis (TV)
Presentation in neonates Ophthalmia neonatorum. Purulent discharge from the eyes of an infant <21d old. Send swabs for NAAT
and M,C&S. If confirmed, seek immediate specialist advice.
Presentation in men 15–50% are asymptomatic. Symptoms: dysuria, urethral discharge. Take urethral swab and first-void urine for culture.
Presentation in women 10–50% are asymptomatic. Symptoms:
• Vaginal discharge (25%)—mucopurulent yellow-white, smelly
discharge; may be frothy
• Vulvovaginal soreness/itching
• Abdominal pain
• Dysuria
Examination shows typical discharge, vaginal inflammation, and strawberry
cervix. Check pH of secretions with narrow-range pH paper. If pH >4.5,
TV is a possibility; send HVS from the posterior fornix at the time of speculum examination for M,C&S. Sensitivity of HVS is low for TV, so if HVS
is –ve, consider GUM referral for wet microscopy ± culture and contact
tracing. 0 TV may rarely be detected on cervical smear.
ManagementG
• Advise patients to avoid sexual intercounse until they and their
partner(s) have completed treatment and follow-up
• Metronidazole po (400mg bd for 5–7d or 2g stat)—tinidazole 2g stat is
an alternative
• Consider referral to GUM clinic for contact tracing
• Resistant TV—try higher dose metronidazole: 400mg tds po + 1g od
pr for 7d, or metronidazole 2g od for 3–5d. High-dose tinidazole 2g bd
for 2wk ± topical vaginal tinidazole is an alternative

Hepatitis B and C
Hepatitis B (HBV) Common. Endemic in much of Asia and the Far
East. The virus has 3 major structural antigens: surface antigen (HBsAg),
core antigen (HBcAg), and e antigen (HBeAg). Spread is via infected blood,
sexual intercourse, from mother to newborn baby, or via human bites.
Incubation period is 6–23wk (average 17wk).
High-risk groups Patients who are/have:
• Injecting drug users
• At risk due to occupation e.g.
• Many sexual partners
healthcare workers
• Adopted children from high/
• Staff/residents of residential
accommodation for individuals
intermediate-risk countries
• Foster parents
with mental handicap
• Close family contacts of a case/
• Travelling to high/intermediatecarrier
risk areas
• Receiving regular blood/blood
• Babies born to mothers who are
chronic carriers of hepatitis B
products and their carers
• Chronic renal/liver disease
or have had acute hepatitis B in
• Prison inmates
pregnancy
Presentation May be asymptomatic or present with fever, malaise, fatigue,
arthralgia, urticaria, pale stools, dark urine, and/or jaundice.
Investigation LFTs (hepatic jaundice—i bilirubin, i ALT/AST, i alkaline
phosphatase), hepatitis serology (see Figure 22.1).
• HBsAg Present from 1–6mo post-exposure. If present >6mo after the
acute episode defines carrier status
• HBeAg Present from 6wk–3mo after acute illness. Indicates high infectivity
• Anti-HBs Antibodies appear >10mo after infection; imply immunity
Management In all cases advise patients to avoid alcohol. Refer for
specialist advice. Treatment is supportive for acute illness. Chronic
hepatitis is treated with interferon and lamivudine with varying success.
Prognosis 785% recover fully; 10% develop carrier status; 5–10% develop
chronic hepatitis—may lead to cirrhosis and/or liver carcinoma. Fulminant
hepatitis and death are rare (<1%).
Prevention Advise patients re ‘safe sex’. Immunize high-risk groups.
Give passive immunization with human immunoglobulin to non-immune,
high-risk contacts of infected patients.
0 Hepatitis immunization of injecting drug misusers If not already
infected/immune or close contact of someone already infected, use a rapid
regime—immunization at 0, 7, and 21d and booster after 12mo.

Hepatitis C (HCV) Common. Spread is usually via contact with
infected blood (causing post-transfusion hepatitis) but can pass from
mother to baby. Not easily spread through sexual contact. In 10% no
source of infection is found. Incubation is 2–25wk (mean 8wk).
Risk factors Blood transfusion; healthcare work; IV drug abuse;
haemodialysis; infant of infected mother (5% risk); multiple sexual partners.

Hepatitis B and C

Presentation and management As for HBV. Anti-HCV antibody is
detectable 3–4mo post-infection. Refer for expert advice. Avoid alcohol.
50% develop chronic infection; 5% cirrhosis; and 15% of those hepatoma.

HIV infection: prevention and testing
Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a retrovirus infecting T-helper
cells bearing the CD4 receptor. Worldwide, the HIV epidemic continues, but prophylaxis and treatment are improving prognosis in developed
countries where treatment is available. It is estimated that 71 in 3 of those
infected in the UK are unaware of their diagnosis.
Transmission ~1 in 1,000 exposures. Mode of transmission may be:
• Sexual (60–70%)—heterosexual intercourse in 54%
• Infected blood products
• IV drug abuse (2%)
• Accidental (e.g. needle stick injuries)
• Mother l child (1.5%)
0 HIV antibodies can take 3mo to develop after HIV infection, so HIV
tests may miss those infected in the early stages of their disease. Consider
repeating if infection may have occurred <3mo prior to testing. If in doubt,
arrange a second test 3mo after the first.

Prevention of HIV infection

• Promotion of safe sex and d IV drug abuse and needle sharing
• Refer to GUM for post-exposure prophylaxis if sexual contact <72h
previously with an HIV-infected individual (or high-risk individual)
• Screening blood donors
• Prevention of transmission from mother to child—risk can be d to
<1% with antiretroviral treatment (given to the mother antenatally,
during delivery, and to the neonate for first 6wk), elective Caesarean
section, and advising against breastfeeding
• Trials of HIV vaccines are in advanced stages
Accidental exposure (e.g. needle stick injury). Significant exposure if:
• The source is HIV +ve
• The material is blood/another infectious body fluid (semen, amniotic
fluid, genital secretions, CSF), and
• Exposure is caused by inoculation (risk of transmission 1 in 300) or by
a splash onto a mucus membrane (risk of transmission 1 in 3,000)
• Immediate action Irrigate the site of exposure with running water; establish history of HIV infection and (if possible) obtain a blood sample from
the source and victim. Refer to A&E immediately for HIV post-exposure
prophylaxis. Treatment is with 3 antiretroviral drugs for 4wk.

Who should be offered a test?

Universal HIV testing (offered to everyone)
• Everyone attending GUM/sexual health clinics
• Women registering for antenatal care
• Women attending for termination of pregnancy
• Everyone diagnosed with TB, hepatitis B/C, or lymphoma
• If prevalence of HIV in the local population is >2/1,000, all those
registering in general practice, and all general medical admissions
High-risk patients
• If HIV is part of the differential diagnosis of the presenting condition
• If diagnosed with another STI
• Sexual partners of those known to be HIV +ve
• Men who have sex with other men and any female sexual partners

HIV infection: prevention and testing

• History of injecting drug misuse
• People originating from or current/former sexual partner from a
country with high HIV prevalence (>1%, e.g. sub-Saharan Africa, India)
Offer repeat testing if:
• HIV –ve, but possible exposure has occurred within the 3mo window
period or since testing
• Men who have sex with men or injecting drug user—offer >1x/y
• Women who refuse an HIV test at antenatal booking—offer testing
again, then a third time at 36wk
Index conditions In which HIV is part of the differential diagnosis:
• Respiratory TB, pneumocystis, aspergillosis, bacterial pneumonia, lung
cancer
• Neurology cerebral toxoplasmosis; cerebral lymphoma; cryptococcal
meningitis; progressive multifocal or other leucoencephalopathy;
aseptic meningitis/encephalitis; cerebral abscess; SOL; Guillain–Barré
syndrome; transverse myelitis; peripheral neuropathy; dementia
• Dermatology Kaposi’s sarcoma; severe/recalcitrant seborrhoeic
dermatitis or psoriasis; multidermatomal/recurrent herpes zoster
• GI Persistent cryptosporidiosis; chronic diarrhoea; hepatitis B/C; Salmonella,
Shigella, or Campylobacter infection; oral candidiasis/hairy leukoplakia
• Sexual health STI; cervical cancer; CIN 2/3; VIN; seminoma
• Haematology Unexplained blood dyscrasia, e.g. thrombocytopenia,
neutropenia, lymphopenia; unexplained lymphadenopathy; lymphoma
(Hodgkin’s or non-Hodgkin’s); anal cancer (or intraepithelial dysplasia)
• Ophthalmology CMV retinitis/other infective retinal disease;
unexplained retinopathy
• Other PUO; weight d; chronic parotitis/parotid cysts; head/neck
cancer; mononucleosis-like syndrome (primary HIV)

Giving the result

If the result is negative Consider whether the patient needs a follow-up
test in 3mo. Provide health promotion information about minimizing risk
of HIV infection in future.
If the result is positive Give the result early in the consultation.
• Explain the result and its implications for the patient and their partner
• Emphasize the positive aspects of knowing the diagnosis
• Try to arrange specialist referral before the patient attends so that the
patient can be given a time and date for specialist follow-up
• Give the patient time to talk through feelings and fears
• Talk about support available, e.g. friends/family; support organizations
• Provide literature about HIV and patient support organizations
• Arrange follow-up to maintain the link with primary care

Sexual health and contraception

HIV infection: clinical disease
Primary HIV Half have no symptoms. Possible symptoms:
• Mononucleosis-like picture of fever, fatigue, myalgia/arthralgia ±
lymphadenopathy. Consider as a differential diagnosis of
glandular fever
• Blotchy rash affecting the trunk, and orogenital/perianal ulceration
• Rarely acute neurological symptoms (aseptic meningitis, transverse
myelitis, encephalitis) or diarrhoea
• FBC may show atypical lymphocytes
• Rarely, CD4 count drops acutely and conditions associated with
immunosuppression, e.g. oral candidiasis or shingles, may occur
• If you think a patient has primary HIV infection, seek urgent advice from
a specialist. HIV tests can be negative <3mo after infection.
Progression Duration/severity of HIV infection is reflected by the CD4
count which d as infection progresses. If CD4 count is <200 cells/mm3,
patients have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) and are at risk
from opportunistic infection (e.g. pneumococcal, TB, CMV, Pneumocystis,
toxoplasmosis, cryptosporidial diarrhoea) and AIDS-associated malignancies (e.g. Kaposi’s sarcoma, lymphoma)—see Table 22.1.
Kaposi’s sarcoma Purple papules or plaques on skin or mucosa of any
organ. Metastasizes to lymph nodes. If suspected refer for expert help:
• Endemic—occurs in central Africa. Peripheral lesions, good response
to chemotherapy
• Associated with AIDS or transplant—commonly skin or pulmonary
lesions; lymphatic obstruction predisposes to cellulitis
M.K. Kaposi (1837–1902)—Hungarian dermatologist.
Management Specialist management is always needed.
Antiretroviral drugs 5 main groups:
• Entry inhibitors			
• Integrase inhibitors
• Nucleoside/nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs)
• Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs)
• Protease inhibitors
Choice of drugs is a specialist decision. A combination is usual (highly
active antiretrovirus therapy or HAART regime). Adherence to therapy
is essential to avoid resistance. The aim is to d viral load to an undetectable level in <6mo. Response to treatment is measured with viral load,
CD4 count, and CD4 percentage. Treatment failure requires switching or
increasing therapy. 0 Do not stop or change the dose of antiretroviral
drugs without taking specialist advice.
Drug interactions are common. Record antiretrovirals on GP system
medication charts (even though prescriptions are usually issued by specialist
centres). Check drug interactions at: M www.hiv-druginteractions.org
Prophylaxis against opportunistic infections Prophylactic antibiotics are
used to prevent Pneumocystis, toxoplasmosis, and Mycobacterium avium
for patients with low CD4 counts.

HIV infection: clinical disease

Psychological support Due to the stigma attached to HIV infection,
patients and carers often lack the support offered by the community for
most other serious illness.

Immunizations

• Inactivated vaccines—can be used safely; offer annual influenza
vaccination, pneumococcal vaccination, hepatitis B testing and
vaccination if seronegative, and hepatitis A vaccine if at risk
• Live vaccines (e.g oral typhoid, BCG) are generally contraindicated
but give varicella (for all) and MMR (if 5 of child-bearing age) if
seronegative and CD4 count >200mm3
CVD prevention HIV is associated with i risk of CVD. Check risk
before, then 3–6mo after starting antiretrovirals and annually thereafter
(every 5y from 40y if not taking antiretrovirals). Provide lifestyle advice
(b p. 242), and treat hyperlipidaemia if 10y CVD risk >20%.
Sexual health Advise to use condoms with water-based lubricant for
all vaginal/anal sex and condoms/dams for oral sex—even if both partners
are HIV +ve (as prevents transmission of drug-resistant strains).
Contraception Efficacy of hormonal contraception is d by antiretrovirals.
Consider Depo-Provera® or IUS/IUCD. Advise condoms in addition to
contraception. If emergency contraception is needed, first-line is an IUD;
if using levonorgestrel, provide a double (3mg) dose.
Cervical screening Women with HIV have i risk of HPV and cervical
cancer. Annual cervical screening is recommended.
Pregnancy b p. 811        Palliative care b p. 1028
Death If HIV has contributed to death, this must be recorded on the
death certificate.

Sexual health and contraception

Other sexually transmitted infections
Genital herpes HSV is transmitted by direct contact with lesions.
Lesions may appear anywhere on the skin or mucosa but are most frequent around the mouth, on the lips, conjunctiva, cornea, and genitalia.
Presentation of primary infection May be asymptomatic. If symptomatic,
history and examination are diagnostic in 90% cases. Presents with multiple
painful genital ulcers on a red background ± inguinal lymph nodes <1wk
after sexual contact. Lesions crust over then heal. Untreated lasts 3–4wk.
Complications: urinary retention, aseptic meningitis.
Management
• Refer to GUM if diagnosis is uncertain and for contact tracing
• Treat with aciclovir if presents within the first 5d of symptoms starting
and while new lesions are still forming (d duration, symptoms, and
complications)
• Analgesia, ice packs, and salt baths may help. 5% lidocaine ointment
gives symptom relief but use with caution as may cause sensitization
• Advice—barrier methods of contraception (risk of transmission in
monogamous relationships is 10%/y)
• If pregnant obtain specialist advice
Recurrent infection Reactivation of latent virus. Less severe than primary
infection. Neonatal transmission rates are low (<3%)—elective Caesarean
section for those with active recurrences at term is controversial. Consider
suppressive therapy if �6 attacks/y, e.g. aciclovir 400mg bd. If breakthrough
occurs, i dose of antiviral, e.g. aciclovir 400mg tds.
Neonatal infection Presents at age 5–21d with vesicular
lesions around the presenting part or rarely systemic infection. Usually babies of women with no history of genital HSV.
Refer as a paediatric emergency.

Genital warts Caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Usually sexually
transmitted, and >25% have concomitant STIs. Disease may be clinical (found
on examination) or subclinical (changes associated with infection detected on
smear). In women CIN (b p. 726) is related to infection with HPV types 16
and 18, but 90% of genital warts are caused by HPV types 6 or 11.
Presentation in women Often asymptomatic but may be associated
with itching or vaginal discharge. Warts are usually seen on the vulva or
introitus. Warts enlarge during pregnancy.
Presentation in men Warts are usually found on the penis or perianally.
Management of clinical warts Treatment does not eradicate the virus but
removes lesions. Barrier contraception is needed for at least 3mo after the
warts are gone. Treatment options in primary care:
• Podophyllotoxin Suitable for home treatment of unkeratinized genital
warts and licensed for a 4wk course. Avoid in pregnancy. Apply 2x/d
for 3d, followed by a 4d rest. This cycle is repeated 4–5x. Side effects:
soreness/ulceration of the genital skin—advise to discontinue treatment

Other sexually transmitted infections

• Imiquimod Can be used at home for keratinized or non-keratinized
warts. Avoid in pregnancy. Apply 3x/wk. On each occasion wash off
6–10h later. Continue for up to 16wk. Avoid unprotected intercourse
after application. Can weaken latex condoms
Alternatives (usually in specialist settings)–trichloroacetic acid, excision,
cryotherapy, electrosurgery.
Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination HPV vaccines are
aimed at preventing infection with strains causing cervical cancer.
Currently vaccines target strains 6, 11, 16, and 18, which account
for 770% of HPV-related cancer cases and 90% of genital warts.
Vaccination in the UK is targeted at girls aged 12–14y. Cervical screening
in adulthood is still necessary as the vaccine does not protect against all
strains causing cervical cancer.

Pubic lice Pubic (or crab) lice are similar to head lice and may be sexu-

ally transmitted. All hairy areas (including eyelashes, eyebrows, pubic and
axillary hair) can be affected. Treatment options are:
• Malathion 0.5%—apply to dry hair; wash out after 12h
• Permethrin 1% cream rinse—apply to damp hair; wash out after 10min
• Phenothrin 0.2%—apply to dry hair; wash out after 2h
• Carbaryl 0.5–1% (unlicensed)—apply to dry hair; wash out after 12h
Repeat treatment after 3–7d
Scabies b p. 639
Syphilis Caused by Treponema pallidum. Rare in the UK but incidence
is increasing. Incubation: 9–90d. If suspected, send blood for VDRL, TPHA
or treponemal antibody absorption depending on local policy. In all confirmed cases refer for specialist care. Contact tracing is essential.
4 stages
• Primary syphilis Chancre at the site of contact
• Secondary syphilis 4–8wk after chancre—systemic symptoms: fever,
malaise, generalized lymphadenopathy, anal papules (conylomata lata),
rash (trunk, palms, soles), buccal snail track ulcers, alopecia
• Tertiary syphilis 2–20y after initial infection—gummas (granulomas) in
connective tissue e.g. testicular gumma
• Quarternary syphilis Cardiovascular or neurological complications.

Sexual health and contraception

Summary of contraceptive methods
80% women receive contraceptive advice and treatment through their GP.
A sexually active woman has an 85% chance of becoming pregnant in <1y
without contraception, and 71 in 3 pregnancies are unplanned.
Contraceptive services Provided as an Additional Service; opting
out results in a 2.4% d in global sum. IUDs may be fitted as a National
Enhanced Service; payment is available for fitting and annual review.

Choice of method See Table 22.2. Consider: a woman’s personal preference; age; lifestyle/cultural aspects; medical history; and risk of STI. 0
Prescriptions for contraceptives are free of charge for all women in the UK).
Before providing contraception Provide information to enable the
woman to choose a method and use it effectively. Exclude pregnancy.
A woman is probably not pregnant if she:
• Has been using a reliable method of contraception correctly
• Has not had unprotected sexual intercourse (UPSI) since her last
period, or
• Is <7d after the start of a normal period; <4wk postpartum,
<7d post-termination or miscarriage; or is fully breastfeeding,
amenorrhoeic, and <6mo postpartum
0 If in doubt, do a pregnancy test ≥3wk after the last UPSI

Emergency contraception
Copper IUCD Can be inserted �120h (5d) after UPSI. >99% effective.
Progestogen-containing IUCDs are not suitable for this purpose.
Levonorgestrel 1.5mg po stat. Licensed �72h (3d) after UPSI but effective for 96h (4d). Can be used more than once if >1 episode of UPSI in
a single cycle. Available OTC and on prescription. There is no evidence
that treatment with levonorgestrel harms the fetus if pregnant.
Progesterone receptor modulator (ulipristal acetate 30mg stat) Can be
used �120h (5d) after UPSI. Only use 1x/cycle.
Possible pitfalls
• Vomiting <3h after taking oral emergency contraception—give a
replacement dose or offer a copper IUCD
• Enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anti-epileptics, St John’s wort) Efficacy
of oral emergency contraception may be d. Consider a copper IUCD
or i dose of levonorgestrel to 3mg (unlicensed)
All women Provide advice about ongoing contraception and prevention
of STI. Advise to return if abdominal pain, next period is overdue or
abnormally light/heavy, or if needs further contraceptive advice.

Sexually transmitted infections Discuss prevention of STIs with all
women when providing contraception. Advise high-risk groups to use barrier methods in addition to hormonal methods of contraception.

Sexual health and contraception

Combined hormonal contraception
Contraceptives containing an oestrogen and progestogen are available as:
• Combined oral contraceptive pills (COC)
• Contraceptive patches (Evra®), and
• Vaginal contraceptive rings (NuvaRing®)
COC pill Most COC come in packets of 21 pills. The woman takes the
entire packet starting on the first day of her cycle and then has a 7d ‘pillfree’ break before starting the next packet. Pills vary by:
Oestrogen type Most COCs contain ethinylestradiol; alternatives are
estradiol valerate (Qlaira®) or mestranol (Norinyl-1®).
Oestrogen content
• Low-strength preparations (20 microgram ethinylestradiol). Use if risk
factors for circulatory disease or if oestrogenic side effects
• Standard-strength preparations (30–35 microgram ethinylestradiol or
50 microgram mestranol). Use for most women
• Phased preparations Dose of oestrogen/progestogen varies
through the cycle. Try for women who have bleeding problems with
monophasic products
• Everyday (ED) preparations Taken continuously. Can help women
who find it difficult to remember to start a new packet
Progestogen type COC pills containing:
• Levonorgestrel and norethisterone Suitable for most women.
Choose for first-time COC pill users
• Desogestrel, norgestimate, dienogest, drosperidone, and gestodene
Consider if side effects, e.g. acne, headache, depression, weight i,
breast symptoms, breakthrough bleeding. 0 Desogestrel/gestodene
may be associated with i clotting risk
• Cyproterone acetate (co-cyprindiol)—Licensed for treatment of acne,
not for contraception, but does provide contraception. Use for 3–4mo
after resolution of symptoms. Associated with 4x i risk of venous
thromboembolism compared to COC containing levonorgestrel
Contraceptive patch (Evra®) 20 microgram ethinylestradiol and
norelgestromin in a transdermal patch. Alternative if compliance with daily
pill-taking is problematic. Apply patch on day 1 of the cycle; change patch
on days 8 and 15; remove third patch on day 22 and then apply new patch
after a 7d ‘patch-free’ interval to start the subsequent cycle.

Contraceptive vaginal ring 15 micrograms/24h ethinylestradiol and

etonogestrel. Alternative low-dose preparation. Insert ring into vagina on
day 1 of cycle and leave in for 3wk; remove ring on day 22; subsequent
courses repeated after 7d ring-free interval.

Sexual health and contraception

Before starting combined contraception
• Take a history—medical, sexual health, medications, and lifestyle
• Consider asking for specialist haematology advice about thrombophilia
screening if FH of DVT/PE in a first-degree relative aged <45y or multiple
family members, and/or check cholesterol/triglycerides if FH of arterial
disease in a first-degree relative <45y, or multiple family members
• Check BP
• Education—discuss side effects/risks of combined contraception (see
Table 22.3), STIs, cervical smears, smoking, control of weight. Give
both verbal and written directions on use
Starting combined contraception Contraceptive effect starts
immediately if started:
• Day 1–5 of the cycle (day 1 only for estradiol valerate/dienogest pill)
• At the end of the third week postpartum
• <5d after miscarriage/TOP at <20wk gestation (day 1 only for estradiol
valerate/dienogest pill)
• Changing COC pill variety or to patch or ring—start the new pill/
patch/ring omitting the 7d break (or ‘inactive’ tablets if taking ED
preparation)
• Changing from contraceptive implant, injectable progestogen, or
desogestrel-only POP—start at any time until repeat injection due,
implant due for removal, or last desogestrel pill taken
0 In all other cases and at all other times use additional contraception for
the first 7d (9d if using estradiol valerate/dienogest pill).
Extended dosingG Continuous dosing is an alternative approach to
combined hormonal contraceptive administration that does not d contraceptive efficacy. Several (unlicensed) regimes are in common use:
• Short pill-free interval Replacement of 7d break with 4d break
• Tricycling 3 cycles taken continuously back-to-back followed by a 7d
break, i.e. 3× 21 monophasic COC, 3× rings, or 9× patches
• Extended use Continuous use of monophasic COC, ring, or patch
until breakthrough bleeding for 3–4d, followed by a 4d or 7d break
Follow-up 3mo after starting or changing a combined contraceptive—
earlier if complications. Once established, review every 6–12mo. At followup, assess risk factors and side effects; give health education, e.g. smoking
cessation advice, benefits of long-acting reversible contraception, information about STIs; check BP.
Table 22.3 Risks and benefits of combined hormonal
contraception use
Risks
Venous thromboembolism (risk i x2
but absolute risk is still very low)

Combined hormonal contraception

Missed doses COC pills (except Qlaira®)—see Figure 22.2; Qlaira® and
contraceptive patches or rings—see BNF 7.3.1 and/or product literature.

• Reasons to stop CHC immediately (pending investigation if
needed):
• Sudden severe chest pain (even if not radiating to left arm)
• Sudden breathlessness (or cough with bloodstained sputum)
• Unexplained swelling or severe pain in calf of one leg
• Acute abdominal pain
• Serious neurological effects including:
• Unusual severe, prolonged headache especially if first time or
getting progressively worse
• Sudden dysphasia, partial or complete loss of vision, disturbance
of hearing, or other perceptual disorders
• Bad fainting attack or unexplained collapse
• First unexplained epileptic seizure
• Weakness, motor disturbances, or numbness affecting one side
or one part of body
• Hepatitis, jaundice, liver enlargement
• BP >160/95mmHg
• Prolonged immobility after surgery or leg injury
• Detection of a risk factor/contraindication (b p. 753)
If 1 pill is missed (i.e.
taken >24h late anywhere in the pack)

Take the missed pill as
soon as possible even
if that means taking 2
pills in one day. Continue
taking the rest of the
pack as usual. No
additional contraception
is needed. Take the 7d
break as normal

Emergency contraception
If unprotected sex in the previous
7d, and ≥2 pills are missed in
the first week of a pack,
emergency contraception may
be needed

If ≥2 pills are missed (i.e. pills are >48h
late at any 1 time, anywhere in the
pack)

Take the most recent missed pill as
soon as possible even if that means taking
2 pills in 1 day. Leave any earlier
missed pills. Continue taking the rest of
the pack as usual. Use extra contraceptive
precautions or abstain from sexual
intercourse for the next 7d

Starting the next pack
If ≥2 pills are missed in the last
week of the pack (i.e. if there are
<7 active pills left), finish the
current pack and start the next
pack without a break. Otherwise
have the usual 7d break

Sexual health and contraception

Short-term side effects Usually resolve within 2–3 cycles.
Relative oestrogen excess Breast tenderness (3.6%); nausea (1.5%);
dizziness; cyclical weight i; bloating; vaginal discharge without infection.
Use a more progestogen-dominant pill.
Relative progestogen excess Mood swings (3.9%); PMT; dry vagina; sustained
weight i; d libido; lassitude; acne. Use a more oestrogen-dominant pill.
Headache Affects 2.9% of women taking the combined contraceptive. Ask
women to report i in headache frequency or onset of focal symptoms
when taking any combined contraceptive. If new focal symptoms, discontinue
immediately and, if not typical of migraine aura and lasts >1h, admit. If headaches
continue consider switching brand/alternative method of contraception.
Breakthrough bleeding Most common in the first few months of combined
contraceptive use—after 6 cycles affects 1.1% women (spotting affects
3.3% women). If no vomiting/diarrhoea and no missed pills, breakthrough
bleeding does not indicate d efficacy. If symptoms suggest other pathology
(e.g. abdominal or pelvic pain, post-coital bleeding) or breakthrough
bleeding persists >3mo:
• Check compliance—any missed pills? Breakthrough bleeding may start
2–3d after a missed pill; any diarrhoea/vomiting
• Check for gynaecological causes—exclude STI (especially chlamydia);
examine cervix; check smear is up to date and take smear if overdue;
exclude pregnancy; consider referral for ultrasound, hysteroscopy +
endometrial sampling if >45y or other risk factors for endometrial cancer
i oestrogen content of COC pill if on low-dose preparation. If problem persists, change progestogen. If still persists i progestogen and/or try
phased preparation.
Long-term risks/benefits See Table 22.3, b p. 754
Acne and CHC In general acne improves when using CHC. If it fails to
improve, consider switching to a brand containing a less androgenic progestogen (e.g. desogestrel, drosperidone) or one with a higher oestrogen
content. Co-pyrindiol use is associated with higher risk of thromboembolism; if using for contraception as well as acne control, switch to an alternative CHC 3–4mo after symptoms have resolved.

Hepatic-enzyme-inducing drugs Combined contraceptives may
interact with hepatic-enzyme-inducing drugs leading to d efficacy, e.g.:
• Anti-infective agents—rifamycins (rifampicin, rifabutin), griseofulvin,
antivirals (e.g. nelfinavir, nevirapine, ritonavir)
• St John’s wort
• Anticonvulsants—phenytoin, carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine,
phenobarbital, primidone, topiramate, modafinil

Short course (<7d) of enzyme-inducing drug Advise additional barrier
contraception whilst taking the enzyme-inducing drug and for 4wk after
stopping it. Omit pill/patch-free week or inactive tablets if using an ‘ED’
preparation.

Combined hormonal contraception

Longer course of enzyme-inducing drug For rifampicin or rifabutin,
advise alternative method of contraception, e.g. intrauterine device. For
other enzyme-inducing drugs, consider i the dose to ≥50 micrograms
ethinylestradiol (maximum 70 micrograms) and shorten pill/patch/
ring-free interval to 4d; alternatively advise another unaffected method of
contraception, e.g. intrauterine device.
0 There is no evidence that broad-spectrum antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin)
d efficacy of combined contraceptives. Additional contraceptive precautions are no longer recommended.

Anticonvulsants that do not affect pill efficacy
• Sodium valproate
•	Lamotrigine—but seizure frequency may i when combined
contraception and lamotrigine are used together and side effects of
lamotrigine may be i when combined contraception is stopped

Interaction with ulipristal acetate (UPA) UPA blocks the action
of progesterone and so d effectiveness of combined contraceptives.
Advise additional contraception for 14d after using UPA when taking combined contraceptives (16d if taking estradiol valerate/dienogest pills).
Diarrhoea and vomiting Does not affect the contraceptive patch or
ring. If a woman vomits <2h after taking a COC pill or has very severe
diarrhoea, assume the COC pill has not been absorbed and treat as a
missed pill (b p. 755).
Surgery Combined contraceptives should be discontinued and alterna-

tive contraceptive arrangements made (e.g. depo-injection, barrier methods) 4wk before major elective surgery, all surgery to the legs or surgery
which involves prolonged immobilization of a lower limb. Restart the combined contraceptive on the first day of the next period occurring ≥2wk
after full mobilization.

Long journeys and DVT Women taking combined contraceptives

are at i risk of DVT during travel involving long periods of immobility
(>3h). Advise women:
• To drink plenty of non-alcoholic fluids
• To keep their legs moving whilst sitting, or walk up and down
the aisle
Graduated compression hosiery is available for purchase OTC and does
d risk of DVT.

Sexual health and contraception

Progestogen-only contraceptives
Progestogen-only contraceptives thicken cervical mucus, d endometrial
receptivity, and inhibit ovulation. They d risk of pelvic infection and can be
used when oestrogen is contraindicated.

Reasons not to prescribe progestogen-only contraception
• Current breast cancer—may be used with specialist advice if
disease-free for >5y and no other suitable method of contraception
• Trophoblastic disease—seek specialist advice if unsure
•	Liver disease—active viral hepatitis; severe decompensated cirrhosis,
or liver tumour (benign or malignant)
• If new symptoms/diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, stroke/TIA, or
migraine with aura when taking progestogen-only contraception
• Avoid if SLE with antiphospholipid antibodies (or if unknown)
0 Investigate any undiagnosed vaginal bleeding before starting
progestogen-only contraception.

Progestogen-releasing intrauterine system (Mirena®) b p. 762
Progestogen-only pill (POP or ‘mini-pill’) (BNF 7.3.2.1.) Oral

POPs are a suitable alternative for women for whom oestrogen-containing
pills are contraindicated:
• Older women      • Heavy smokers
• Women with past history/predisposition to venous thromboembolism
• Patients with hypertension, valvular heart disease, DM, or migraine
• Breast-feeding women <6mo postpartum 0 Delay until ≥3wk
postpartum to avoid risk of heavy bleeding
Choice of POP 5 brands are currently available in the UK:
• Etynodiol 500 micrograms—Femulen®
• Norethisterone 350 micrograms—Micronor® or Noriday®
•	Levonorgestrel 30 micrograms—Norgeston®
• Desogestrel 75 micrograms—Cerazette® or Nacrez®—use if
compliance problems (12h window before ‘missed pill’), history of
ectopic pregnancy or ovarian cysts (desogestrol POPs have a stronger
ovarian suppressive effect than other POPs), and/or weight >70kg
Side effects
• Higher failure rate than COC pills
• Menstrual irregularities—oligomenorrhoea, menorrhagia, amenorrhoea—
examine to exclude a pathological cause ± do a pregnancy test. Menstrual
irregularities tend to resolve with long-term use. If necessary, consider
changing progestogen or i to 2 pills/d (unlicensed)
• i risk of ectopic pregnancy. If a patient presents with abdominal pain
treat as an ectopic pregnancy (b p. 816) until proven otherwise
• Others—nausea and vomiting; headache; dizziness; breast discomfort;
depression; skin disorders; disturbance of appetite; weight changes;
changes in libido
• Long-term—small i risk breast cancer; risk reverts to normal <10y
after stopping the POP

Progestogen-only contraceptives

Starting the POP
• No previous hormonal contraception Start on day 1–5 of the cycle—
no additional contraception needed; if starting any other time, use
additional contraception/abstain from sexual intercourse for 2d (9d if
started after emergency contraception using ulipristal acetate)
• Changing from COC Start the day following completion of COC
without a break (omitting ‘inactive’ pills if ED preparation)—no
additional contraception needed
• Changing from IUD If POP started �2d before removal of copper
IUD or at the time of IUS removal—no additional contraception; if
started at the time of copper IUD removal, advise abstinence/barrier
contraception for 7d prior to removal and for 2d afterwards
• After childbirth Start any time >3wk postpartum (i risk of bleeding
earlier). Does not affect lactation. No additional contraception needed
Directions for taking the POP Take 1 tablet every day with no pill-free
breaks. Take each tablet at the same time each day—if delayed >3h (>12h
for desogestrel POP) treat as missed pill.
Missed pills If a pill is missed or delayed >3h (>12h for desogestrel POP),
continue taking the POP at the usual time and use additional barrier
methods for 2d.
• Give emergency contraception if ≥1 POPs have been missed or taken
>3h late (>12h late for desogestrel POP) and unprotected sexual intercourse has occurred in the 2d following this.
Diarrhoea/vomiting Continue taking the POP but use an additional
barrier method during the episode and for 2d afterwards.
Interactions with other drugs Efficacy of POPs is not affected by
antibacterials that do not induce liver enzymes. Efficacy is d by
enzyme-inducing drugs (b p. 756)—advise women to use an additional
barrier method or alternative contraceptive method during treatment and
for >4wk afterwards. Advise an alternative method of contraception if
taking long-term hepatic-enzyme-inducing drugs.
Follow-up Review 3mo after starting the POP or changing from CHC—
earlier if complications. Once established, review every 6–12mo—assess
risk factors and side effects; give health education, e.g. smoking cessation
advice, information about STIs, information about long-acting reversible
contraception; check BP.

Injectable progestogens (BNF 7.3.2.2) Useful if oestrogen-containing

preparations are contraindicated or compliance is a problem. Failure rate
is <4/1,000 women over 2y.
Advantages
• Can be used to age 50y if no other risk factors for osteoporosis
• d ectopic pregnancy, functional ovarian cysts, and sickle cell crises
• d risk of endometrial cancer. Provides endometrial protection as part
of HRT regime (unlicensed)
• May alleviate premenstrual syndrome and d menorrhagia

Disadvantages
• Relatively contraindicated if DM with complications or multiple risk
factors for CVD
• May d bone density in first 2–3y of use. Consider DEXA scan in older
women if result would influence choice
• Can mask natural menopause
• May be a delay in return of fertility of up to 1y on stopping
• Can cause menstrual disturbance—if troublesome give next injection
early (8–11wk after the previous injection for Depo) or add oestrogen
if no contraindications
• Other side effects, e.g. weight i (up to 2–3kg), mood swings, acne
Depo-Provera® Medroxyprogesterone acetate 150mg/mL.
• Give 1× 1mL by deep IM injection into the buttock/lateral thigh or
deltoid up to day 5 of the cycle. Do not rub the injection site afterwards
• If given for first time after day 5, check the woman is not pregnant and
provide and advise an additional method for 7d
• Postpartum: delay until >6wk after childbirth—if not breastfeeding, first
dose can be given <5d after childbirth but may cause heavy bleeding
• Repeat every 12wk. If interval is >12wk and 5d—see Table 22.4
• CSM advice about Depo-Provera®
• In all women, weigh benefits of use for >2y against risks
• In women with risk factors for osteoporosis, consider a method of
contraception other than Depo-Provera®
• In adolescents, Depo-Provera® should only be used only when other
methods of contraception are inappropriate
Noristerat® Norethisterone enantate 200mg/mL. Warm first then give 1×
1mL by deep IM injection into the gluteal muscle before day 6 of the cycle
or immediately after childbirth (avoid breastfeeding if baby has jaundice
requiring treatment). Do not rub the injection site afterwards.
May be repeated once only after 8wk. Unlicensed if repeated further.
Interactions Effectiveness is not d by antibacterials that do not induce
liver enzymes. Effectiveness of Noristerat® (but not Depo-Provera®) is d
by enzyme-inducing drugs—advise additional contraception whilst taking
these drugs and for 4wk after stopping or alternative method.

Progestogen implant (see BNF 7.3.2.2) Nexplanon® is the only implant
currently available in the UK. It is a radio-opaque flexible rod (40mm ×
2mm) containing 68mg of etonogestrel that is inserted subdermally into the
lower surface of the upper arm on day 1–5 of the cycle. If inserted after day
5, check not pregnant and use an additional method for 7d.
Advantages Lasts 3y and, once inserted, no compliance required; can be
used for women at risk of ectopic pregnancy; no effect on bone density;
once removed, fertility returns immediately to normal.
Disadvantages A minor operation is needed for insertion/removal.
Special training is needed, and complications of minor surgery can occur
(e.g. infection, scarring). d efficacy with liver enzyme-inducing drugs—
advise additional method for duration of treatment and 4wk afterwards
or alternative contraception if enzyme-inducing drugs are being used

Sexual health and contraception

Intrauterine devices
Intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) (BNF 7.3.4) Plastic

carrier wound with copper wire/fitted with copper bands. Suitable for:
• Older parous women
• As second-line contraception in young nulliparous women, or
• For emergency contraception
Acts by inhibiting fertilization, sperm penetration of the cervical mucus,
and implantation. Pregnancy rate with IUCDs containing 380mm2 copper
is <20/1,000 over 5y.

Intrauterine system (IUS) (BNF 7.3.2.3) The progestogen-only
intrauterine system (Mirena®) releases levonorgestrel 20 microgram/24h
directly into the uterine cavity. It acts by preventing endometrial proliferation, thickening of cervical mucus, and suppression of ovulation (some
women and some cycles). Licensed uses include:
• Contraception—particularly suitable for women with heavy periods
• Primary menorrhagia—menstrual bleeding is d significantly in 3–6mo
• Prevention of endometrial hyperplasia during oestrogen therapy
Emergency contraception b p. 750
Choice of devices See Table 22.5
Contraindications
IUCD only Allergy to copper; Wilson’s disease; heavy/painful periods.
IUCD and IUS
• Pregnancy or <4wk postpartum
• Current or high risk of STI or pelvic inflammatory disease (includes
severe immunosuppression)—a woman should not have an IUCD/IUS
fitted <3mo after treatment of a pelvic infection. Following treatment
of STI suitability depends on ongoing risk
• Undiagnosed uterine bleeding
• Distorted uterine cavity
• Endometrial, ovarian or cervical cancer, or trophoblastic disease
• Anticoagulation—caution—use another method if possible

Advantages
IUCD only No systemic side effects; does not mask the menopause;
if fitted in a woman of >40y can remain in the uterus until menopause
(unlicensed).
IUS only
• d menorrhagia/dysmenorrhoea
• d risk of pelvic inflammatory disease—particularly younger age groups
• d risk of ectopic pregnancy compared to the IUCD
• If 45y and amenorrhoeic, can be left in situ for 7y for contraception
(unlicensed)—change after 4y if using IUS for endometrial protection
IUCD and IUS
•	Long-lasting and can be used until the menopause
• Once fitted, no compliance is needed

Intrauterine devices

• Easily and immediately reversible by removal
• Can be used for women who are breastfeeding, obese, or have
concurrent illness—migraine, venous thromboembolism, DM,
cardiovascular disease (or i risk of cardiovascular disease), or women
taking long-term hepatic-enzyme-inducing drugs (e.g. anticonvulsants,
antivirals)
• Can be used for HIV +ve women—but screen for STIs first and advise
condom use

Disadvantages and problems
IUCD only
• Ectopic pregnancy Risk (0.02/100 women years) is higher than if using
a hormonal contraceptive method. If pregnancy occurs, there is a 1 in
20 risk of ectopic pregnancy—consider in any woman who has IUCD
and develops abdominal pain
• i dysmenorrhoea/menorrhagia Most common reason for
discontinuation. Exclude infection and malposition. Exclude other
gynaecological causes. Treat with NSAID or tranexamic acid or
consider changing to the IUS
IUS only Progestogenic side effects:
• Changes in pattern/duration of menstrual bleeding (spotting/prolonged
bleeding) are common—warn women prior to insertion. Bleeding
usually becomes light/absent within 3–6mo of insertion
• Mastalgia, mood changes, change in libido—usually resolve in <6mo
• Ovarian cysts—usually resolve spontaneously; monitor with USS
• Cannot be used for emergency contraception

Sexual health and contraception

IUCD and IUS
• Fitting and removal Requires specialist training and can be
uncomfortable for the woman
• Expulsion/malposition—Risk of expulsion is ~1 in 20. Usually occurs
<3mo after insertion—teach women to feel for threads after each
period. If threads cannot be felt advise other contraception until
checked by a health professional (see Figure 22.3)
• Perforation of the uterus Risk <1 in 1,000
• Pelvic inflammatory disease i risk of infection <21d after
insertion. Related to existing carriage of STIs. It is good practice to
screen for STIs (especially chlamydia) and treat infection prior to
insertion
• Actinomyces-like organisms (ALOs) on cervical smear Assess to
exclude pelvic infection. If no signs of pelvic infection, offer choice
to leave device in situ or change it. If symptomatic discuss antibiotic
treatment with microbiology and refer to GUM/gynaecology for
further management
• Intrauterine pregnancy Confirm intrauterine pregnancy with USS.
Remove device at <12wk gestation whether or not the woman intends
to continue the pregnancy. If pregnancy is >12wk or no threads are
visible, refer to obstetrics/gynaecology

Insertion Special training is required. The Faculty of Sexual and
Reproductive Healthcare runs a training scheme (F 020 7724 5669
M www.fsrh.org). Accreditation must be updated every 5y. IUS/IUCDs
may be inserted:
• <7d after onset of menstruation—tail end of a period is the optimum
time; heaviest days of a period are best avoided
• At any other time in the cycle—if replacement of IUS/IUCD. If first
device, and not in the first 7d of the cycle, ensure not pregnant and
advise additional method for 7d
• Immediately after TOP/miscarriage or >4wk postpartum (unlicensed
<6wk postpartum), irrespective of the mode of deliveryN
• Always consider pre-screening for STI (especially chlamydia) ±
antibiotic prophylaxis, e.g. azithromycin 1g stat, prior to insertion.
Advise women to contact a doctor if any sustained pain is experienced
in the first 3wk after insertion
• Cervical shock Rare complication of IUD insertion. Presents with pallor, sweating, and bradycardia. Immediately tip the woman head down
with legs raised. If symptoms/bradycardia persist, give 0.6mg atropine IV.
• Women with epilepsy i risk of seizure at the time of cervical dilation—ensure emergency drugs are available.

Follow-up Review after first period then annually. Ask about periods,
pelvic pain, vaginal discharge, and discomfort to partner. Perform pelvic
examination to check threads.

Intrauterine devices

Teach all women with an IUD in situ to check for the IUD threads
after each period

Threads not found

Removal
• If pregnancy is desired—remove at any time
• If pregnancy is not desired—remove after establishing a hormonal
method or use barrier methods/abstinence for ≥7d prior to removal.
If urgent removal is necessary, provide emergency contraception if mid
cycle and intercourse has occurred in the previous 7d (b p. 750)
• Menopause—remove after 1y amenorrhoea if aged >50y or after 2y
amenorrhoea if aged <50y. If there is difficulty removing the device, try
again after a 5d course of oestrogen (e.g. Premarin® 1.25mg od po)

Other contraceptive methods
Sterilization There are no absolute contraindications to sterilization of
men or women, provided that:
• They make the request themselves
• They are of sound mind, and
• They are not acting under external duress
• If there is any question of a person not having the mental capacity to
consent to a procedure that will permanently remove their fertility, seek
advice from your medical defence organization.
Method
• Women Laparoscopic tubal occlusion with clips or rings (usually done
under GA as a day case) or hysteroscopic sterilization with intratubal
implants (usually done under LA or sedation as a day case)
• Men Vasectomy. Usually done under LA as a day case
Pre-referral counselling
• Alternative long-term contraceptive methods (include sterilization of
partner as an alternative)
• Reversibility—sterilization is intended to be permanent; reversal is
only 50–60% successful
• Failure rate—1 in 200 for 5; 1 in 2,000 for 4
• i risk of ectopic pregnancy after tubal occlusion
• Risk of operative complications
• Effect on long-term health—no proven long-term risks
• Need for contraception before and after operation
• Women: other contraception until first post-procedure period
• Men: other contraception until 2 consecutive semen analyses,
2–4wk apart and �8wk after the procedure shows azoospermia
0 All counselling should be supported by impartial written information.
• Take additional care when counselling:
• People of <30y
• People without children
• People taking decisions during pregnancy
• People taking decisions in reaction to a loss of relationship
• People at risk of coercion by their partner, family, or health or social
welfare professionals

Coitus interruptus Penis is withdrawn prior to ejaculation.
Avoidance of intercourse during times of fertility 3 methods of
estimating time of ovulation are used:
• Urine testing—a commercial kit (Persona®) is available to buy
• Temperature—taken orally in the morning before drinking/getting
up (thermometer is available on NHS prescription). i 0.2–0.4oC
indicates progesterone release from the corpus luteum. Unprotected
intercourse can take place from day 3 of the i until the next period
• Mucus texture (Billing’s method). Texture of vaginal secretions is
felt between finger and thumb daily. Prior to ovulation the mucus

Other contraceptive methods

becomes profuse and slippery, then abruptly changes to being thicker
and more tacky. No unprotected intercourse from the day the mucus
becomes more profuse until 3d after it becomes tacky. Patients with
cycles > or <28d must vary timings
Vaginal diaphragms (BNF 7.3.4) Latex or silicone and flat metal spring,
coiled metal rim, or arcing spring diaphragms are available. Motivation is
crucial. Fitting must be performed by a doctor or nurse trained to fit
diaphragms. After fitting, a woman should practise inserting, wearing,
checking the diaphragm is over the cervix, and removing the diaphragm
for >1wk using another form of contraception. Some vegetable/mineral
oil-based lubricants (e.g. petroleum jelly (Vaseline®), baby oil) can damage
caps. Water-based lubricants are safe (e.g. KY Jelly®).
0 Spermicides (2 x 2cm strips applied to the upper surface) must always
be used in combination with diaphragms and reapplied without removal if
in situ >3h before sex takes place. The diaphragm must be left in situ for
≥6h (maximum 30h) after intercourse.
Follow-up Check fit and comfort after ~1wk, and discuss again the routine
for use, especially the importance of spermicide. See after 3mo and then
annually, but more frequently if there are difficulties, if there is a weight
change of >4kg, if the woman has a baby, or after pelvic surgery. Prescribe
a new diaphragm yearly.
Cervical caps (BNF 7.3.4) Silicone. Attach by suction. Otherwise used
in the same way as a diaphragm. The inside of the cap should be filled onethird full of spermicide. Useful for women with poor muscle tone, absent
retropubic ledge, or recurrent cystitis when using a diaphragm.
Spermicides to use in combination with caps or condoms (BNF
7.3.3) Nonoxinol ‘9’ 2% gel (Gygel®) is the only preparation currently available in the UK.
Condoms Give protection against STIs. Male and female versions.
• A new condom should be applied for each episode of sexual
intercourse (or if applied incorrectly) and only one should be used at a
time; male and female condoms should not be used simultaneously
• Advise about emergency contraception in the event of an accident
• Some lubricants/topical vaginal preparations d effectiveness, e.g.
petroleum jelly (Vaseline®), baby oil, and oil-based vaginal/rectal
preparations; water-based lubricants are safe (e.g. KY Jelly®)
Dams Are not a contraceptive but protect against STIs. Thin film that
provides a barrier between the mouth/cervico-vaginal secretions or
between the mouth and anus.

Sexual health and contraception

Teenagers and women over 40
Contraception for the under 16s
Sexual health problems One in three have sexual intercourse under the
age of 16y. Those who have intercourse early are at i risk of early pregnancy and STI. Worries about sexuality can add to the pressure for some.
Sensitive support, clear guidance, and accurate information about contraception, sexuality, and STI are helpful. Remember to offer chlamydia
screening (b p. 740) to the under 25s.
Safeguarding (b p. 924) • Sexual intercourse with a child under the age
of 13y is rape and must be reported to the authorities.
Providing contraception to the under 16s In the UK, a doctor is allowed
to give contraceptive advice and treatment to a girl aged <16y without
parental consent if it is in her best interest that contraceptive advice/
treatment is given and she:
• Is sufficiently mature to understand the moral, social, and emotional
implications of treatment
• Cannot be persuaded to inform her parents
• Is likely to begin/continue, intercourse with or without contraception
• Is likely to suffer if no contraceptive advice or treatment is given
Confidentiality and consent b p. 50 and p. 52
Choice of contraceptive method
• Condoms Most commonly used contraception for adolescents.
Relatively high failure rate—suggest their use in addition to another
form of contraception to help prevent STIs
• Long-acting reversible contraception (LARC) Offer IUCD,
progestogen implant, injectables, or intrauterine system to all
teenagers. Provides high levels of protection against pregnancy with no
need for ongoing compliance once fitted/administered. 0 The CSM
advises that medroxyprogesterone acetate (Depo-Provera®) should
only be used when other methods of contraception are inappropriate
as it may i osteoporosis risk (use alternative if other risk factors and
try not to use >2y), menstrual irregularity, and i weight
• Combined hormonal contraception (pill, patch, or vaginal ring)
Suitable method of contraception for the under 16s. Poor compliance
can be a problem and leads to a relatively high failure rate
• Progestogen-only pill (POP) Suitable for teenagers but has the same
compliance problems as combined hormonal contraception and is
associated with menstrual irregularity. Useful if the teenager does not
want long-acting contraception and CHC is contraindicated
• ‘Morning after pill’ (levonorgestrel 1.5mg <72h or ulipristal acetate
30mg <120h after unprotected intercourse). Not suitable as regular
contraception, but valuable in preventing unwanted pregnancy. Provide
information on availability and make it easy for teenagers to get urgent
same-day appointments to obtain a prescription
Do’s and don’ts
• Don’t insist on vaginal examination unless it is necessary
• Do discuss the merits of delaying sexual intercourse until older
• Do stress the need for protection against sexually transmitted infection

Teenagers and women over 40

• If prescribing combined hormonal contraception for acne,
dysmenorrhoea or cycle control, do explain its use for
contraception too
• Do consider ‘quick-starting’ contraception when the young person is
seen rather than waiting for the next cycle

Contraception for women >40y
Choice of contraceptive method
• Combined hormonal contraception Non-smokers with no risk factors
for CVD or breast cancer can use combined hormonal contraception
until 50y. Consider a lower oestrogen preparation (20 micrograms
ethinylestradiol). Improves menstrual and menopausal symptoms and
protects bone density. Women experiencing menopausal symptoms
may wish to try an extended regime (b p. 754)
• Progestogen-only pill Can be continued to 55y and can be used as the
progestogen component of HRT, but three POPs daily are needed for
endometrial protection (unlicensed and no data for desogestrel). Does
not interfere with FSH levels
• Injectable progestogen Can be used up to 50y in women not
at risk of osteoporosis (CSM advises benefits of using injectable
medroxyprogesterone acetate for >2y should be evaluated against
risks of d bone density). May cause menstrual irregularity
• Progestogen implant Cannot be used as part of HRT regime
• IUS (Mirena®) Improves menorrhagia. Licensed for endometrial
protection (can be used as part of an HRT regime). If 45y and
amenorrhoeic, can be left in situ for 7y for contraception (unlicensed);
change after 4y if using IUS for endometrial protection
• IUCD Copper intrauterine devices fitted in women >40y may remain
in the uterus until post-menopause
Stopping contraception after the menopause
• Non-hormonal methods After 2y amenorrhoea if <50y; after 1y
amenorrhoea if �50y
• Combined hormonal or injectable progestogen Use to 50y, then
switch to alternative method of contraception
• Implant, POP, or IUS Continue to 50y; if �50y and amenorrhoeic,
continue to 55y or check FSH—if FSH >30iu/L, repeat after 6wk and
if second FSH >30iu/L stop contraception after 1y of amenorrhoea; if
�50y and not amenorrhoeic, consider investigating abnormal bleeding
and continue >55y until amenorrhoeic for 1y

Sexual health and contraception

Termination of pregnancy
The role of the GP
• The earlier in pregnancy a termination of pregnancy is performed,
the lower the risk of complications. General practice is often the
first stage of the referral procedure—have arrangements which
minimize delay
• Termination of pregnancy (TOP), especially for ‘social’ reasons,
is a difficult ethical area for many GPs. Whatever your views, be
sympathetic and if not prepared to refer yourself, arrange for the
patient to see someone who will do so as soon as possible
• Confirm pregnancy if unsure. Assess dates by bimanual palpation or
arrange dating USS
• Counselling—unbiased counselling to allow a woman to reach a
decision she feels is right for her—this is an important decision she
will have to live with for the rest of her life. Why does she want a
termination? Has she considered alternatives? Does her partner/do
her parents know? What are their views?
• Ideally the woman should be given some time once she has all the
information to make her decision (e.g. follow-up in a few days). Offer a
let-out clause—she can always change her mind right up until the time of
the procedure, and you will support her whatever decision she makes
• Consider signing form HSA1 (remember to include your
qualifications)
• Discuss contraception after TOP (ideally do this before TOP so it
can be started immediately after)
• Arrange follow-up after the procedure

Legal constraints The 1967 and 1990 Human Fertilization/Embryology
Acts govern termination of pregnancy in the UK. Termination is allowed at
<24wk gestation if termination:
• d risk to the woman’s life
• d risk to the mother’s physical/mental health (90% TOPs are carried
out under this clause)
• d risk to the physical/mental health of the mother’s existing children
• The baby is at serious risk of being physically or mentally handicapped
There is no upper time limit if there is:
• Real risk to the mother’s life
• Risk of grave, permanent injury to the mother’s physical or mental
health, or
• The baby would be born seriously physically or mentally handicapped
Terminations of pregnancy (TOPs) >24wk can only be carried out in NHS
hospitals. 99% TOPs take place <20wk. Those taking place >20wk are usually performed when fetal abnormality is found on USS (or amniocentesis)
or if pregnancy is concealed in the very young.
0 Seek medicolegal advice from your medical indemnity organization if
the patient is <16y or has a cognitive deficit that might impair ability to
consent to referral and/or treatment.

Termination of pregnancy

Procedure
• Medical Oral mifepristone followed by oral and/or vaginal
prostaglandin (usually misoprostol)
• Surgical Suction termination <15wk; dilatation and evacuation >15wk

Complications
• Infection
• Haemorrhage
• Uterine perforation

• Cervical trauma
• Failed procedure and ongoing pregnancy
• Psychological sequelae

0 There is no association between TOP and subsequent infertility or
miscarriage/preterm delivery.

Follow-up In many areas post-procedure follow-up is undertaken by

the GP. Worrying symptoms are: excessive blood loss, pain, and/or high
temperature. Assess, consider the possibility of infection and treat if reasonably well; admit if the patient is unwell.
0 Check anti-D has been given if needed (b p. 820) and chosen method
of contraception has been started.

Contraception post-termination or miscarriage <24wk
• Combined pill/patch/ring, POP, progestogen injection/implant
Start on the day of surgical or second part of medical termination.
No additional method required. If started >5d after termination (day 1
only for estradiol valerate/dienogest pill) an additional method is
required for 2d (POP), 7d (combined pill/patch/ring or progestogen
injection/implant) or 9d (estradiol valerate/dienogest pill)
• IUCD or IUS Insert at time of surgical or second part of a medical
abortion. No additional method required. Otherwise delay insertion to
4wk post-abortion—use another method in the interim
Teenage pregnancy The UK has the highest teenage pregnancy rate
in western Europe. Not all are unplanned. Pregnant teenagers need information and non-judgemental support to help them to reach a decision
whether or not to continue with the pregnancy.

Infertility
Failure to conceive after 1y of regular unprotected sexual intercourse in
the absence of known reproductive pathology. Affects 71 in 5 couples.
Pregnancy rates The normal rate of pregnancy in the first year is
20–25% per cycle. 84% of couples conceive after 1y of unprotected intercourse (17 in every 20 couples); 92% conceive after 2y (19 of every 20
couples); after 3y, the pregnancy rate is still 725%/y.

Causes of infertility
• Ovulatory dysfunction 730%
• Male factor 720%
• Pelvic disease 720%
• Unknown 730%
Initial approach Most couples tend to present at about 1y. Where
possible, see the couple together. This shows mutual commitment and
initiates ongoing, couple-centred management.
Couple Ask about:
• Length of time trying to conceive
• Frequency of and/or difficulties with sexual intercourse, e.g.
psychosexual problems, physical disability—includes excessive travelling
which may limit optimal coital timing and indirectly affect fertility
Women Ask about:
• Previous pregnancies—children, miscarriages, same/different partner?
• Menstrual cycle—length of cycle (normal cycle is 21–35d duration),
changes in cervical mucus through the cycle, ovulatory discomfort?
• Past gynaecological history—cervical smears, previous pelvic surgery,
STI/pelvic inflammatory disease, PCOS
• Past medical history—systemic or debilitating disease, e.g. thyroid
dysfunction, DM, inflammatory bowel disease, anorexia nervosa
• Drug history—chemotherapy, phenothiazines, cannabis, NSAIDs
• Lifestyle—occupation (exposure to pesticides?), smoking, alcohol,
excessive exercise, stress
Men Ask about:
• Previous children, same/different partner?
• PMH—mumps, other testicular disease, STI
• Any systemic or debilitating diseases?
• Drug history—sulfasalazine, nitrofurantoin, tetracycline, cimetidine,
ketoconazole, colchicine, allopurinol, α-blockers, tricyclic
antidepressants, MAOI, phenothiazines, propranolol, chemotherapy,
anabolic steroids, cannabis, cocaine
• Social history—occupation (exposure to pesticides, X-rays, solvents,
paints, chemicals from smelting or welding), smoking, alcohol, excess
exercise, stress, social or occupational factors which might cause
testicular hyperthermia
Adverse factors Age (5 only—fertility d significantly from mid-30s), BMI
<19 (5 only) or >29 (4 and 5), smoking (d fertility by about one-third),
excess alcohol (4 only), excess caffeine (>2 cups of coffee/d—5 only).

Examination Consider pelvic/genital examination.

Infertility

GP investigations Perform investigations if no pregnancy after a year
of trying to conceive—sooner if aged >35y.
Female
• Rubella status
• Chlamydia serology—indicator of possible tubal disease
• Mid-luteal progesterone—check on day 21 of the menstrual cycle for
a woman with a 28d cycle; adjust timing if longer/shorter cycle. Can
only be accurately interpreted after the next period as aims to ‘catch’
the progesterone peak 7d before the next period. Normal value
(>30nmol/L) signifies ovulation
• FSH/LH—check on day 1–5 of the menstrual cycle
• Consider TFTs if symptoms/signs of thyroid disease, or prolactin if
galactorrhoea or any suggestion of pituitary tumour
Male Sperm problems affect 71 in 5 couples. Semen analysis is important
even if the man already has children. If the first test is abnormal, advise
loose trousers and underwear and repeat after 3mo—or as soon as
possible if grossly abnormal. 0 Abnormal sperm do not fertilize ova.
Instructions for producing a semen sample for analysis No sex for 2d
beforehand and �7d since last sex (may affect motility). Masturbate into
labelled sterile pot without use of condoms/gels. Keep the sample warm
(e.g. inside pocket), and deliver to the laboratory within 2h. Handover
directly to a member of laboratory staff if possible.
Referral Local protocols vary and exclusions may apply. Generally refer
after 18mo of failure to conceive despite regular intercourse. Refer sooner
if abnormal history, examination, or investigations, e.g.:
• Female age >35y; amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea; PCOS; previous
pelvic inflammatory disease or STI
• Male Previous genital pathology or urogenital surgery; varicocele;
significant systemic illness; persistent abnormality on semen analysis

Possible treatments GPs may need to continue to prescribe
• Clomifene—ovarian stimulation, treatment for oligospermia
• Tamoxifen—may be prescribed to women intolerant of clomifene
• Metformin—used as an adjunct to clomifene in overweight ladies with
polycystic ovarian syndrome who fail to respond to clomifene alone
• Others, e.g. gonadotrophins, dopamine agonists (e.g. bromocriptine)
Counselling Consider early referral for specialist counselling. Access
is through national support groups and at local specialist fertility centres.

Sexual health and contraception

Sexual problems
Sexual problems may have a physical or psychological basis but all
develop a psychological aspect in time. Both partners have a problem in
730% cases. Be supportive—your response will determine whether the
patient receives appropriate help.

Assessment
• History of the problem What is the problem? If new, when did it
start? Why consult now? What outcome does the patient want? Is the
patient complaining or is his/her partner?
• Sexual history Details of sex education; attitude towards sex; past
history of sexual problems (or lack of problems)
• Medical history Chronic disease; psychiatric problems; current
medication
• Social history and recent life events
• Examination Genitalia for abnormalities or tenderness—helpful but do
not insist as it may scare the patient away
0 Always consider psychological aspects Poor self-image; anger or
resentment—relationship/financial difficulties, children, parents, work
stress; ignorance or misunderstanding; shame, embarrassment, or guilt—
view that sexuality is ‘bad’, sexual abuse; anxiety/fear about sex—fear of
closeness, vulnerability, letting go, and failure.
Lack of sexual interest Usually needs specialist help. Often there are
underlying psychological difficulties which may relate specifically to sex,
e.g. previous child abuse, or a general psychological disorder. Women
frequently lose interest around the menopause or after operations (especially mastectomy or hysterectomy) or if their partner’s performance
repeatedly leads to frustration (e.g. impotence). Both sexes lose interest if
depressed or after traumatic events.

Vaginismus Usually apparent at vaginal examination—severe spasm of
the vaginal muscles and adduction of thighs. May be detected incidentally
when undertaking routine procedures, e.g. cervical smear. Try to find the
root cause. Common causes:
• Fear of the unknown
•	Local pain
• Past history of rape, abuse, or severe emotional trauma
• Defence mechanism against growing up
Management Treat any underlying medical disorder causing pain.
Desensitize by encouraging the woman to examine herself, and also
encourage the partner to be confident enough to insert a finger into the
vagina. If no success, refer.

Orgasmic problems in women Consider:
Physical reasons
• Drugs—major tranquillizers, antidepressants
• Neurological disease
• Pelvic surgery—recognized complication of hysterectomy

Sexual problems

Psychological reasons
• Women who have never achieved an orgasm May have psychological
reasons. Give ‘permission’ for the woman to investigate her body’s
own responses further by masturbation or vibrator. When she
has learned how to relax, encourage her to tell her partner and
incorporate caressing into their usual lovemaking
• Women who have lost the ability to achieve orgasm May need
specialist help, especially about current relationship or loss of
self-image
Dyspareunia b p. 714    Erectile dysfunction b p. 776

Premature ejaculation Ejaculation sooner than either partner wishes.
With practice men can learn to delay ejaculation. The stop/start technique
may be effective: when during caressing or intercourse, a man feels he is
close to climax he should stop being stimulated and relax for 30 seconds;
stimulation can then recommence until he is close to climax again, when
the relaxation is repeated. If this fails, the woman should squeeze the
penis at the base of the glans between finger and thumb during relaxation
phases. Consider referral for sex therapy if no improvement.
Delayed ejaculation May be a sign of long-standing sexual inhibition.
Often patients can ejaculate by masturbation but not intravaginally. Explore
anxiety and guilt feelings. Use a strategy like that for psychogenic erectile
dysfunction (b p. 778). If that fails, refer for psychosexual counselling.
Retrograde ejaculation Semen passes into the bladder rather than
the urethra—complication of TURP or bladder neck incision. May also
occur as a result of spinal injury or DM. The patient can usually achieve an
orgasm but there is no ejaculate or the volume of the ejaculate is d. Urine
may be cloudy after having sex. Confirm diagnosis with urine microscopy
(excess sperm in urine). Unless infertility is a problem, no treatment is
required.
Haematospermia Blood in the ejaculate. Common causes include
urogenital infection and minor urethral trauma, but often no cause is
found. If persistent, underlying pathology is more likely. Ask about other
symptoms, e.g. discharge, pain, dysuria. Examine the external genitalia and
perform DRE to assess the prostate. Check MSU and semen analysis ±
urethral swab (including chlamydia) if any urethral discharge/high risk of
STI. Check PSA and urine cytology if patient is aged >40y. If persists and
no cause is found, refer to urology.

Erectile dysfunction
50% men aged 40–70y experience inability to obtain/maintain sufficient
rigidity of the penis to allow satisfactory sexual performance; 90% are too
embarrassed to seek help—always ask. Incidence i with age.
Organic causes (80%)
• Cardiovascular CHD i incidence x4—more likely to have multi-vessel
than single-vessel coronary artery disease; peripheral vascular disease;
hypertension—incidence i x2
• DM incidence i ×3. >35% of diabetic men have erectile dysfunction.
May be the presenting feature of DM
• Neurological, e.g. pelvic surgery, spinal injury, multiple sclerosis
• Side effects of prescription drugs Consider changing medication
if onset of erectile dysfunction is within 2–4wk of initiation of drug
therapy e.g. thiazides
• Smoking (incidence i x2), alcohol, or drug abuse
• Peyronie’s disease (b p. 464)
• Testosterone deficiency or hyperprolactinaemia

Psychogenic causes
• Performance anxiety
• Depression or stress

• Relationship failure
• Fear of intimacy

Drugs causing erectile dysfunction

• Antihypertensives
• Major tranquillizers
• Antidepressants (e.g. SSRIs) • Anti-androgens

• Finasteride
• Cimetidine

History Ensure the presenting problem is erectile dysfunction and not
other sexual difficulties; identify risk factors and distinguish psychogenic
from organic causes (see Table 22.6). 0 Many with organic erectile dysfunction develop a psychogenic component which perpetuates symptoms.
Examination and investigation
• CVD and DM—check BP, peripheral pulses, and blood for fasting lipid
profile and glucose
• Psychological distress—consider depression/anxiety screening
• Testosterone insufficiency—genitals (small/absent), breasts i, d beard
(d frequency of shaving). If suspected, check serum testosterone, sex
hormone binding globulin, free androgen index, FSH/LH ± prolactin

withdrawn mechanically sucking blood into the penis.
Erection is maintained by placing a constriction band
around the base of the penis

Penile prosthesis

Last resort. Inflatable or rigid. Major complication is
infection

Others
Androgen
supplements

Ineffective unless documented hypogonadism. Only
use with specialist advice. Exclude prostatic cancer and
significant CVD first, and check PSA and haematocrit at
3,6 and 12mo after initiation of treatment, then annually
thereafter

Psychotherapy

Effective for some. Time-consuming and expensive but may
avert the need for drugs and give permanent resolution

X Andropause/male menopause
From 730y, testosterone levels d by 710% every decade. At the same
time, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) level i, which d the amount
of bioavailable testosterone further. Andropause is associated with
low bioavailable testosterone levels; 730% of men in their 50s develop
symptoms.
Presentation d sex drive, emotional, psychological, and behavioural
changes, d muscle mass and muscle strength, i upper and central body
fat, osteoporosis and back pain, i cardiovascular risk.
Management If suspected, check total testosterone and SHBG ± FSH/
LH and prolactin. If hypogonadism is confirmed, refer for specialist
management with testosterone replacement.

Sexual health and contraception

GP management Counsel the couple about the problem, its possible
causes and management (see Table 22.7, b p. 777, and Figure 22.4).
• Advice on lifestyle—d smoking and alcohol. Weight loss and
i exercise for obese, underactive patients improves both sexual
function and cardiovascular health
• Discuss pros and cons of available drug treatment. Phosphodiesterase
type 5 inhibitors (PDE5s) are the mainstays of treatment—titrate dose
to effect (most people with DM need the maximum dose); warn the
patient he may need 8 attempts before a satisfactory erection occurs;
side effects include headache, flushing, and acid reflux
• Review progress—adjust dosage, consider other treatment options
(intraurethral/intracavernosal alprostadil, vacuum devices) or
treatment for psychosexual problems, and/or referral
Referral Options:
• Urologist If the patient has never had an erection, has a severe
vascular problem, lack of success with treatment in general practice, or
severe psychological distress due to erectile dysfunction
• Endocrinologist Hormone abnormalities (e.g. d androgen,
i prolactin)—treatment does not always restore potency
• Psychiatrist/psychosexual counsellor Age <40y and no evidence of
organic cause; psychosexual problem
Psychogenic erectile dysfunction Treatment in general practice is
appropriate for couples who do not wish to be referred.
• See the couple together
• Recommend a manual, e.g. ‘Treat Yourself to Sex’ (P. Brown and
C. Faulder, Penguin, 1989. ISBN: 0140110186)
• Forbid sexual intercourse
• Explain that stroking should progress slowly from non-genital to
genital—if anxiety occurs, go back one step
• Progress until erection is achieved
• Give permission for intercourse (if not already achieved)
• If unsuccessful, refer to a psychosexual counsellor
• All men >25y with erectile dysfunction should be screened for DM,
cardiac risk factors, and signs/symptoms of vascular disease.
0 NHS prescriptions for erectile dysfunction are available only for men:
• Treated for prostate cancer; with kidney failure, spinal cord injury,
DM, MS, spina bifida, Parkinson’s disease, polio, severe pelvic injury,
or who have had radical pelvic surgery or a prostatectomy
• Already receiving drug treatment for impotence on 14.9.98
• Through specialist services for men suffering severe distress due to
erectile dysfunction
Endorse NHS prescriptions with the letters ‘SLS’. A consultation is currently underway to lift NHS prescribing restrictions.

Pregnancy

Pre-conception and early pregnancy
counselling
The aim of pre-pregnancy care is to give a woman enough information for
her pregnancy to occur under the optimal possible circumstances. Areas
to cover are:
Smoking d ovulation, d sperm count, d sperm motility.
Once the woman is pregnant Smoking:
• i miscarriage rate (x2) and risk of ectopic pregnancy
• i risk of placenta praevia and placental abruption
• i risk of premature rupture of membranes and preterm delivery
• i risk of cleft deformities
• i perinatal mortality and d birth weight (by an average of ~200g)
Once the baby has delivered Smoking is associated with:
• i rate of cot death
• i chest infections and otitis media in children
27% of pregnant women are smoking at the time of delivery. Explain risks
and advise on ways to stop—b p. 182.
Alcohol Fetal alcohol syndrome (growth restriction, CNS involvement,
and facial deformity) is rare and tends to occur in babies of heavy drinkers—
especially those who binge drink. Effects of smaller quantities of alcohol are
less clear. Miscarriage rates are i in moderate drinkers. Current advice
is to avoid alcohol in pregnancy especially for the first 3mo. If a woman
continues to drink, advise her to limit consumption to 1–2u/d.
Illicit drugs Cannabis (used by 5% mothers) is possibly associated
with poorer motor skills in children and strongly linked with cigarette
smoking—discourage. If taking other illicit drugs, refer for specialist care.
Diet See Box 23.1.
Folate supplementation d risk of neural tube defect (open spina
bifida, anencephaly, encephalocele) by 72%. For most women, recommend
0.4mg daily from when pregnancy is being planned until 13wk gestation.
Recommend 5mg daily if:
• Previous child had neural tube defect
• Maternal/paternal history or family history of neural tube defect
•	The mother has coeliac disease, DM, BMI >30kg/m2, or is taking
anticonvulsants
Only 71 in 3 women take folic acid prior to conception. Effect of starting in early pregnancy is unevaluated. Supplements can be prescribed,
are available via the Healthy Start Programme (together with vitamin C
and D supplements) or are available OTC from chemists/supermarkets.
Introduction of folic acid fortified flour has recently been approved.

Other supplements
• Vitamin D The DH recommends 10 microgram (400iu)/d but limited
evidence for general use. Consider for women with poor diet or limited
exposure to sunlight, those of South Asian, African, Caribbean, or Middle
Eastern family origin, and those with pre-pregnancy BMI ≥30kg/m2
• Iron Do not routinely offer—for most, side effects outweigh benefits
(b p. 822)

Pre-conception and early pregnancy counselling

Box 23.1 Healthy eating tips for women
Eat a variety of foods including:
• Plenty of fruit and vegetables—at least five portions per day
• Plenty of starchy foods, e.g. bread, pasta, rice, or potatoes
• Protein-rich foods, e.g. lean meat, chicken, fish, eggs, beans, lentils
• Fibre, e.g. wholegrain bread, pasta or rice, fruit, and vegetables
• Dairy foods containing calcium, e.g. milk, cheese, and yoghurt
Folic acid (folate) Reduces risk of conditions, such as spina bifida.
Take folic acid supplements (400 microgram) every day from stopping
contraception until you are 13wk pregnant. Eat foods containing folate,
e.g. green vegetables, brown rice, fortified bread, and cereals.
Iron Eat iron-rich foods, e.g. red meat, beans, lentils, green vegetables,
and fortified cereals. Fruit, fruit juice, and vegetables help with iron
absorption.

Food to avoid
Pâté and some unpasteurized dairy products All pâtés (including
vegetable), Camembert, Brie, other ripened soft cheeses, and blue
cheese—may contain Listeria which causes miscarriage, stillbirth, and
infections in newborn babies.
Raw/undercooked meat, eggs, and ready meals Risk of food poisoning.
• Wash your hands after handling raw meat
• Keep raw meat separate from foods ready to eat
• Only eat well-cooked meat—hot right through, with no pink bits left
• Only eat eggs cooked until white and yolk are solid. Shop
mayonnaise and mousses are safe but avoid home-made dishes
containing raw egg
•	Ensure ready meals are piping hot all the way through
Liver products and vitamin A supplements Too much vitamin A can
harm a baby’s development. Avoid eating liver (and liver products, e.g.
pâté) and supplements containing vitamin A or fish liver oils.
Some types of fish Eat ≥2 portions of fish per week (including one of
oily fish—mackerel, sardines, fresh (not canned) tuna, or trout) but:
• Avoid shark, swordfish, or marlin, and limit tuna to two steaks or four
cans weekly. Mercury in these fish can harm a baby’s nervous system
• Only eat 1–2 portions of oily fish per week
• Avoid raw shellfish, as they can cause food poisoning
Alcohol and caffeine Avoid alcohol. High caffeine levels can cause
miscarriage or low birth weight. There is caffeine in coffee, tea,
chocolate, cola, and some ‘high-energy’ drinks. You can drink four cups
of coffee, six cups of tea, or eight cans of cola daily.
Gardening and changing cat litter Toxoplasmosis can harm an
unborn baby’s nervous system and/or cause blindness. The parasite
that causes it is found in meat, cat faeces, and soil. Wear gloves when
gardening or changing cat litter and wash your hands afterwards.

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Sexual intercourse and contraception Sexual intercourse is not
known to be harmful during pregnancy. Often women contemplating
pregnancy are still using contraception. Discussion about how to stop/
what to expect may be helpful (e.g. injectables, IUCD).
Exercise b p. 792
Chronic disease Review of pre-existing medical conditions with
referral for expert a pre-conceptual advice where necessary.
• Diabetes mellitus—refer for specialist diabetic review and change
women taking sulfonylureas to metformin or insulin (b p. 828)
•	Epilepsy—refer for specialist review of medication (b p. 829)
• Heart disease—refer for specialist advice if situation is not clear
•	Genito-urinary disease (e.g. HIV, genital warts, bacterial vaginosis)—
treat or refer for treatment/advice on mode of delivery if necessary
(b p. 810)
Review of medication Drug handling by the body is altered during
pregnancy, and drugs can cause damage to the developing fetus:
• Discontinue known teratogens prior to conception
• Advise to avoid OTC medication unless safety checked with doctor/
midwife
• Avoid prescribed medication as much as possible—few medicines have
proven safety in pregnancy. If prescribing use well-known and tested
drugs at the smallest possible doses, and only when benefit > risk
Problems in previous pregnancies
• Recurrent miscarriage and/or cervical incompetence (b p. 815)
• Congenital abnormalities/inherited disorders—pre-pregnancy
counselling and detailed advice on genetic screening for high-risk
pregnancies is available via regional genetics services
Rubella status Rubella in early pregnancy carries a high chance
(40–70%) of deafness, blindness, cardiac abnormalities, or multiple fetal
abnormalities (b p. 806). If rubella status is unknown, suggest it is
checked. If not immune, suggest MMR immunization; avoid pregnancy for
3mo afterwards (live vaccine) and recheck immunity after 3mo.
Flu vaccination Pregnancy i risk of complications and death from
seasonal influenza. Offer annual flu vaccination to all pregnant women.
Work/benefits Discussion of benefits available during pregnancy (see
Table 23.1) and employment law (b p. 792) is necessary so that women
may avoid possible hazards at work, attend for antenatal care, and plan
their maternity leave from early in pregnancy.

Discussion of antenatal care and screening available
• Brief discussion of antenatal screening (b p. 796) and antenatal care
procedures (b p. 786) allows women to investigate their choices in
pregnancy at their leisure
• Brief discussion about miscarriage and possibility of infertility allows
women to be more confident about asking for help if problems with
conception/early pregnancy occur

Pregnancy

Antenatal care
Objectives of good obstetric care
•	To provide a safe outcome for the mother and baby with the
minimum of avoidable complications
•	To make the birth experience as satisfying as possible
•	To make optimal use of available resources
Pregnancy is a risky business for both mother and baby. Every year women
die as a result of pregnancy—the most common causes being eclampsia,
haemorrhage, pulmonary embolism, and infection.
Maternity Services Are provided by practices as an Additional
Service, i.e. most practices are expected to provide routine antenatal care
and postnatal care to mothers and babies from birth (or discharge from
secondary care) until the 14th day after delivery, with the exception of
intrapartum care and the neonatal check. Payment is included in the global
sum. If a practice ‘opts out’ global sum is d by 2.1%.
Intrapartum care Intrapartum care and neonatal checks can be provided
to women by GPs at home or in GP maternity units as a National Enhanced
Service. One payment is made for each woman who receives intrapartum
care and a further payment for each neonatal check.

Definitions
• Gravidity—number of pregnancies a woman has had (at any stage)
• Parity—number of pregnancies resulting in delivery >24wk gestation
(or live births <24 wk)
• Primipara, multipara—woman who has been delivered of a child for
the first time (primipara) or second or subsequent time (multipara)
Pregnancy tests Detect urinary β-HCG. +ve from 1st day of missed
period until ~20wk gestation. Remain positive for ~5d after miscarriage/
termination or fetal death.
Antenatal care The first antenatal appointment should be offered as
early into pregnancy as possible. Further appointments for healthy women
should be offered at 16, 28, 34, 36, 38, and, if not already delivered,
at 41wk. Additionally healthy nulliparous women should be offered
appointments at 25, 31, and 40wk. Provide additional appointments as
needed for high-risk women. See Figure 23.3 b p. 791.
First antenatal visit The primary function of this visit is to identify
those women needing additional care. As there is so much information to
be collected/discussed, consider two appointments.
History
•	This pregnancy—LMP, usual cycle, fertility problems, contraception,
desirability of pregnancy, any problems so far
•	Estimated date of delivery (EDD)—see Figure 23.1
• Past pregnancies—outcome and complications of previous pregnancies
• Past/current medical history—illness (including psychiatric illness),
drugs, allergies, varicose veins, abdominal/pelvic surgery (including
female genital mutilation)

Health promotion for pregnant women
Work For most women, work in pregnancy is safe. By law:

•	Employers must assess risks to the health/safety of the pregnant
woman and adjust for risks accordingly
• Women are entitled to time off work for antenatal care
•	Employed women cannot work >33wk into pregnancy unless the
woman’s GP informs her employer that she may continue
•	Employers may not require/allow return to work <2wk after childbirth
• Women who work for an employer qualify for 52wk of maternity
leave. Employment rights continue throughout this period. Women
can apply for flexible/part-time working hours on return to work
Further information
• Health and Safety Executive M www.hse.gov.uk/mothers
• Citizens Advice Bureau M www.adviceguide.org.uk
Exercise Moderate exercise is safe and healthy. Advise pelvic floor
exercises (b p. 841). Avoid:
• Contact sports, high-impact sports, and vigorous racquet sports
• Scuba diving—possible link with fetal birth defects and may cause fetal
decompression disease
Drugs Advise women to avoid unnecessary medicines (including OTC)
and illicit drugs. Drugs that can be started/continued in pregnancy, if
clinically necessary and benefits outweigh risks, include:
• Low-dose aspirin (75mg)
• Analgesics—paracetamol,
codeine-based preparations • Antiemetics—cyclizine, domperidone,
prochlorperazine, metoclopramide
• Antacids and ranitidine
• Antihistamines—chlorphenamine
• Antibiotics—except
• Antihypertensives—methyldopa,
tetracyclines; avoid
nifedipine, labetalol, doxazosin
trimethoprim in first
• β-agonists—salbutamol, terbutaline
trimester and at term
• Hormones—thyroxine, insulin • Ipratropium
• Inhaled steroids
• Laxatives
Drugs to discontinue or change in pregnancy
• NSAIDs—except low-dose aspirin
• Warfarin—liaise with obstetrician as may need to change to low
molecular weight heparin
• Antibiotics—tetracycline, doxycycline
• Antihypertensives—ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers
• Retinoids, e.g. isotretinoin
Further information on drugs in pregnancy

Complementary therapies Use as little as possible.
• Avoid—oil of evening primrose (possible i in PROM)
• No benefit—raspberry leaf tea (but probably no risk either)
• Possibly beneficial—ginger, P6 acupressure and acupuncture
for nausea and vomiting; moxibustion for breech presentation;
acupuncture for backache/pelvic pain; acupuncture for insomnia
• No/limited evidence—St John’s wort, hypnosis, aromatherapy

Travel
• Car Seat belt should go above and below—not across—the bump
• Air Check specific requirements of carrier. Most airlines will not
accept pregnant women >32wk (rarely, 36wk with a doctor’s letter)
• Travel involving long periods of immobility (>3h) is associated with
i risk of venous thromboembolism. Advise women to drink plenty of
non-alcoholic fluids; keep their legs moving whilst sitting or walk up
and down the aisle; and purchase graduated compression hosiery OTC.
Travel abroad Best time to travel is in the second trimester. Travel to
high-risk areas is best postponed/cancelled. Avoid travel to places at altitudes >2,500m (i risk of IUGR/ pre-eclampsia).
Vaccines Assess risk/benefit ratio on an individual basis.
• Avoid live vaccines BCG, cholera, measles, mumps, rubella, varicella,
smallpox, Japanese encephalitis. 0 Inadvertent administration has not
been shown to cause harm
• Inactivated vaccines Give if needed— pertussis, hepatitis A and B,
meningococcal (only if significant risk of infection), inactivated polio
(normally avoid), rabies, tetanus/diphtheria, yellow fever (avoid unless
high risk)
0 Pregnancy i risk of complications and death from seasonal influenza.
Offer annual flu vaccination to all pregnant women.
Malaria Travel to malaria areas is best avoided. If unavoidable, take
precautions to avoid mosquito bites (b p. 172). Chloroquine and
proguanil can be used in usual doses in pregnancy. Give folic acid 5mg od
with proguanil. Consider mefloquine for travel to chloroquine-resistant
areas. Avoid Malarone® and doxycycline.
Contaminated food/water Risk of listeriosis, toxoplasmosis, and hepatitis E.
Avoid travel to hepatitis E areas—720% death rate in the third trimester.
Severe diarrhoea may be harmful to the fetus.
Insurance for travel Ensure adequate cover. Most companies insure
pregnant women to 28wk, some to 32wk. In Europe, the European Health
Insurance Card (EHIC) (b p. 45) provides free emergency medical care.
It does not cover costs of transport or repatriation.
The UK has reciprocal agreements with some other countries for urgently
needed medical treatment. Countries and services available are listed on
the DH travel advice website (M www.dh.gov.uk). Proof of British nationality or UK residence is needed.

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Who should deliver where?
All those offering maternity care must give women choices about type of
care, place of care and birth and the information to make those choices
avoiding personal bias or preference. Who delivers where ultimately
depends on the choice that the woman makes (see Table 23.2). Options:
• Consultant unit
• Midwife or GP/midwife unit integral with/attached to a consultant unit
• ‘Isolated unit’—distant from a specialist unit and manned by midwives
or midwives and GPs
• Home (~1% deliveries in the UK)
Legal position of GPs GPs are often fearful of litigation if women
opt for delivery outside a specialist unit. Even women with no risk factors
can run into problems—rapid intervention to save life is needed in ~5%
deliveries. With midwives taking on increasing responsibility for antenatal
care in the community, GP-attended home deliveries are very uncommon,
and GPs perceive they lack expertise. This compounds their worry.
The legal position is that
•	GPs are responsible only for their own acts or omissions
• Midwives are accountable for their own actions and decisions
•	The GP only becomes responsible for a woman’s care in labour when
the midwife attending seeks his/her advice. The GP is then bound
by terms and conditions of service to offer advice (either over the
telephone or by attending), whether or not the woman had been
accepted for maternity care
• If an accident occurs, the GP would be judged against standards of a
colleague of similar skills and training, not a specialist obstetrician

Duties of the GP
• Provision of impartial advice about available services locally
• Discussion of the available options in a way to enable the woman to
make an informed choice
•	To make arrangements for provision of care
Specialist unit vs community-based care In the UK the
perinatal and maternal death rates have fallen as the proportion of
hospital births has risen. But this is largely due to improvements in
housing, nutrition, and antenatal care rather than having babies in
hospital per se. Evidence from countries where home birth is the norm
suggests that birth outside the hospital setting is safe for healthy women
with low-risk pregnancies.
• If a woman decides to deliver away from a specialist unit, she should
be informed about:
•	The facilities and levels of skill and expertise available where she has
chosen to deliver, and
•	The facilities and specialist services that are available in a specialist
unit but not where she has chosen to deliver
Record the discussion in her notes.

Pregnancy

Screening in pregnancy
Most women undergo some form of screening before/during pregnancy
aiming to identify, prevent, and treat actual or potential problems (see
Figure 23.2, b p. 789). Offer women and their partners unbiased information verbally and in writing regarding screening and diagnostic tests, the
meaning and consequences of both, what to expect in terms of results,
and further options for management. The right to accept or decline should
be made clear—and the decision recorded in the antenatal notes.
GPs need to be aware of techniques of prenatal diagnosis to:
• Identify all women who might benefit from genetic counselling and/or
early assessment by the obstetrician, and
• Counsel patients about the accuracy and risk of prenatal diagnosis
Pre-pregnancy genetic screening There are many inherited
diseases. Warn couples that most tests give no absolute ‘yes’ or ‘no’
but are a risk assessment. Refer couples for genetic screening before
pregnancy if they want referral and have factors which put them at high
risk of having a baby with a genetic disorder.
Personal or family history of genetic abnormality, e.g.:
• Duchenne and
• Haemophilia
• Cystic fibrosis
other muscular
• Fragile X syndrome
• Down’s syndrome
dystrophies
• Polycystic kidneys
• Sickle cell disease
• Huntington’s chorea
• β-thalassaemia
High risk ethnic groups, e.g.:
• Afro-Caribbean origin—sickle cell anaemia
• Indian subcontinent, Far East, southern Europe—thalassaemia
• Ashkenazi Jew—Tay–Sachs disease
0 The Family Origin Questionnaire (available from M http://sct.screening.nhs.uk) identifies those at risk of carrying a haemoglobinopathy.
A blood test establishes carrier status and risk to the baby.
Older women i risk of Down’s syndrome (b p. 798).
Consanguinous couples First-degree cousins who have a baby together
have an i risk of congenital malformations in their offspring.

Routine antenatal screening is NOT recommended for
Vaginal/genital infections
• Bacterial vaginosis
• Chlamydia (unless <25y
b p. 740)
•	Group B streptococcus
•	Genital herpes

Other infections
• Cytomegalovirus
• Hepatitis C
•	Toxoplasmosis

Genetic conditions—refer for
screening only if a family member
is affected:
• Cystic fibrosis
• Fragile X
• Familial dysautonomia

Others
•	Thrombophilia
•	Thrombocytopenia
• Preterm labour
• Domestic violence

Screening in pregnancy

Basic screening tests Blood and urine tests—many women are not
aware these tests have been done let alone their purpose or results.
Ensure women are given information about the reasons for, significance
of and results of routine tests and record in the notes that permission has
been given to do them. Usual tests are:
• Blood group
• Hb estimation (b p. 822)
•	Urine dipstick for proteinuria
• Antibody screen (b p. 820)
(pre-eclampsia screen b p. 800)
• Combined screen (b p. 798)
• HIV status (b p. 799)
• Haemoglobinopathy screen
• Syphilis status (b p. 812)
(b p. 800)
• Rubella susceptibility
• MSU for M,C&S (b p. 812)
• Hepatitis B status (b p. 797)
0 Rubella immune status is not strictly a screening test for this pregnancy
but does identify susceptible women (72.5%) so that postpartum vaccin­
ation may protect future pregnancies.
Ultrasound scan (USS)
• Early USS Offer to all pregnant women at 10wk–13wk 6d for accurate
gestational age assessment
• High-resolution ‘anomaly’ scan Offer at 18 wk–20wk 6d to detect
fetal structural abnormalities (see Table 23.3). Detection rates vary
according to the abnormality, e.g. subtle heart anomalies are less likely
to be detected than gross CNS anomalies
Placenta praevia Because most low-lying placenta detected at the
routine 18–20wk anomaly scan will resolve by the time the baby is born,
only women with placenta praevia extending over the internal cervical
os are offered another transabdominal scan at 32wk. If this is unclear, a
transvaginal scan should be offered.

Pregnancy

Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Used to detect genetic/metabolic
abnormality in high-risk pregnancies. Performed from 11wk–13wk 6d
gestation. The developing placenta is sampled per abdomen with USS
guidance.
• Advantages Undertaken earlier than amniocentesis to allow
termination of affected pregnancies at an earlier stage
• Risks 72–4% miscarry; limb defects (X)
Further information
RCOG Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (2010)
M www.rcog.org.uk
Amniocentesis Sampling of amniotic fluid via transabdominal needle
under USS guidance >15wk gestation. Carries a 1.9% pregnancy loss risk.
Amniocentesis is offered:
• If a high-risk result is obtained following first/second trimester
screening for Down’s syndrome
• If the woman has had a previous pregnancy affected by fetal anomaly
• If there is a strong family history of an inherited disorder
Further information
RCOG Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (2010)
M www.rcog.org.uk
Fetoscopy Fibreoptic visualization of the fetus. Carried out from
~18wk. Enables detection of external abnormalities, fetal blood sampling
and organ biopsy. Fetal loss rate ~4%.
Down’s syndrome Most common single cause of learning difficulty in
children of school age. Incidence: 1.2/1,000 live births. Incidence i with age
of the mother (see Table 23.4). Screening should detect >75% of Down’s
syndrome pregnancies, with a screen positive rate of <3%.
Combined screening test Performed from 10wk–14wk 1d gestation.
Screening test of choice, as aids early diagnosis and can be completed in
one stage without the need for re-attendance. Produces a single estimate
of the woman’s risk of having a child with Down’s syndrome using:
• Maternal blood tests For human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and
pregnancy-associated paraprotein A (PAPP-A), and
• Nuchal translucency (NT) USS measurement of the translucency of the
nuchal fold in the neck of the fetus done from 11wk 2d–14wk 1d gestation
Quadruple screening test Performed from 14wk 2d–20wk; used for
women who book later in pregnancy (715%). Maternal blood is tested for
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), HCG, unconjugated estriol (uE3), and inhibin A.
Test results Are expressed as a risk assessment (e.g. 1 in 300 at term) or
as a +ve or –ve result. A +ve result implies a risk >1 in 150 at term. Ensure
all women with +ve results are referred promptly for counselling about
further investigation (CVS/amniocentesis) and pregnancy options.

has recommended
all pregnant women,
irrespective of age, should
be offered screening for
Down’s syndrome

Tay–Sachs disease Genetic condition carried by 1 in 25 Ashkenazi
Jews. Offer genetic screening whether or not there is a family history.
Offer screening for other diseases commonly carried in this population
(e.g. Gaucher’s disease, familial dysautonomia, cystic fibrosis, Canavan’s
disease) only if there is a family history.
Antenatal HIV testing HIV testing is now offered at the booking
appointment as a routine part of antenatal screening in the UK. If the
woman screens negative but is at continued high risk of acquiring HIV, a
repeat test may be offered later in pregnancy.
0 If a woman screens +ve for HIV, her partner and any other children in
the family should also be offered screening.
Benefits of screening Without intervention, ~25–30% babies born to
mothers infected with HIV will become infected with HIV themselves.
Avoidance of breastfeeding, antiretroviral therapy, and appropriate management of delivery d risk of transmission to <1%.
If the screening test is declined Document refusal in the woman’s notes,
explore the reasons for refusal and offer screening again at 28wk.
Screening for other infections Pregnant women who are HIV +ve should be
offered screening for genital infection—chlamydia, gonorrhoea, and bacterial vaginosis—done as early as possible in pregnancy and at around 28wk, as
co-infection is common in certain subgroups of these women and can i rate
of mother-to-child transmission, as well as adversely affecting the pregnancy
itself. Also check hepatitis B and C serology unless already done.

Haemoglobinopathy Screening

for sickle cell diseases and
thalassaemias should be offered to all women as early as possible in
pregnancy (ideally <10wk). In both cases, women identified as being a
carrier (having a trait) or having the disorder should be referred promptly
for specialist counselling. Their partners should be offered screening.
Thalassaemia All women are offered FBC early in pregnancy. One of the
routine FBC indices, mean cell haemoglobin (MCH) is used as a screening
test for thalassaemia. If MCH is ≤27pg, a more diagnostic test using HbA2
(Hb alpha 2) chromatographic analysis is required.
Sickle cell disorders Screening policy depends on prevalence:
• High-prevalence areas (>1.5/10,000 pregnancies) All women are
offered screening for sickle cell and other haemoglobin variants
• Low-prevalence areas The Family Origins Questionnaire (available
from M http://sct.screening.nhs.uk) is used to assess the risk of either
the woman or her partner being a carrier for sickle cell and other
haemoglobin variants. Those in identified high-risk groups are offered
laboratory testing

• Previous macrosomic baby (≥4.5kg) • BMI >30kg/m2
• DM in a first-degree relative
• Previous gestational DM
• Family origin associated with high prevalence of DM: South Asian
(especially India, Pakistan, or Bangladesh); black Caribbean; Middle
Eastern (especially Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Iraq, Jordan,
Syria, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, Lebanon, or Egypt)
Screening test Offer women with ≥1 risk factor screening:
• If a woman has had previous gestational DM, screen with early
self-monitoring of blood glucose or offer a 2 hour 75g oral glucose
tolerance test (OGTT) at 16–18wk, followed by a repeat OGTT at
28wk if the first test is normal
• For other risk factors, offer an OGTT at 24–28wk
Pre-eclampsia Check BP and urinalysis for proteinuria at each
antenatal appointment to screen for pre-eclampsia (b p. 826).
First contact At first contact, assess the pregnant woman’s level of risk for
pre-eclampsia. Risk factors for developing pre-eclampsia are:
• Age ≥40y
• Nulliparity or pregnancy interval of >10y
• Multiple pregnancy
• BMI ≥30kg/m2 at first contact
• Family (e.g. mother, sister) or past history of pre-eclampsia
• Pre-existing vascular (e.g. hypertension, DM) or renal disease

Screening in pregnancy

Consider i frequency of BP/proteinuria monitoring in pregnancy for these
women—although optimum frequency of BP checks is unclear.
• Warn all pregnant women of the symptoms of advanced pre-eclampsia:
• Headache
• Problems with vision, e.g. blurring or flashing before the eyes
• Bad pain just below the ribs
• Vomiting
• Sudden swelling of face, hands, or feet
If a pregnant woman experiences any of these symptoms in pregnancy
she should seek advice from a doctor or midwife as soon as possible.

Psychiatric illness At first contact, ask about:

• History of mental health problems, e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder,
severe depression
• Previous treatment from a specialist mental health team (including
in-patient care)
• Family history of perinatal mental illness
0 Ensure that information about any relevant history of mental illness is
included in your referral letter for antenatal care.
At booking Ask:
• During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling
down, depressed, or hopeless?
• During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little
interest or pleasure in doing things?
• If the woman answers ‘yes’ to either question, ask: is this something
you feel that you need help with?
If a mental health problem is detected, further assessment (e.g. with
PHQ-9—b p. 1001) is indicated.

Common symptoms in pregnancy
Abdominal pain b p. 1102
Backache Affects 60% of pregnant women—usually from the 2nd

trimester onwards and worse in the evenings—may interfere with
sleep/activities. Encourage light exercise (unless contraindicated, e.g.
pre-eclampsia)—special land and water-based classes are run for pregnant
women. Treat with simple analgesia, physiotherapy 9 massage.
Bleeding b p. 818
Breast soreness Most common early in pregnancy. Good support bras
are essential (can be purchased from specialist clothing stores). Nipples
enlarge and darken at ~12wk.
Carpal tunnel syndrome Affects 728% pregnant women—b p. 486.
Reassure usually resolves after pregnancy. Night splints may help. If severe
consider steroid injection. Diuretics do not help. If does not resolve after
pregnancy, refer for orthopaedic assessment.
Constipation Affects up to 40% of pregnant women. i fluid and fibre
intake. If necessary use a bulk-forming laxative, e.g. ispaghula husk. Avoid
bowel stimulants as they i uterine activity.
Cramp Leg cramp affects 1 in 3 in late pregnancy. Worse at night.
Raising the foot of the bed by 20cm (e.g. 1–2 bricks) can help.

Fatigue
• Early pregnancy Almost universal symptom. Reaches peak at
12–15wk. Advise rest and adjustment of lifestyle. Reassure
• Late pregnancy Due to i physical effort needed to do everyday tasks
and sleep deprivation. Check not anaemic else reassure
Haemorrhoids Affect 8% of women in the third trimester. May be
associated with itching, pain, and bleeding. Advise i fibre intake. Treat
prolapse with ice packs and replacement. Topical haemorrhoid applications are commonly used but lack evidence of safety or efficacy.
Headache Usually tension headache. Check BP and urine for protein to
exclude pre-eclampsia (b p. 826). Treat with rest and analgesia. Migraine
may i or d in pregnancy.
Heartburn Affects 70% of women in the third trimester. Reassure not
harmful. Advise low-fat, bland food, small portions and frequent meals.
Avoid eating late at night if worse at night, and consider raising the head
of the bed (1–2 bricks under the bed). Avoid gastric irritants, e.g. caffeine.
Antacid preparations, e.g. magnesium trisilicate, are helpful if lifestyle
modifications are ineffective but may worsen constipation.
• Pre-eclampsia can present with epigastric pain—check BP and urine
for protein if epigastric/right upper quadrant pain unresponsive to simple
antacids, refer for same-day assessment even if BP is normal and no/trace
proteinuria (b p. 827).
Hypotension Common symptom of early pregnancy. Check no
bleeding. Advise to avoid standing suddenly and avoid hot baths.

Common symptoms in pregnancy

Insomnia Avoid drug treatment. Reassure. Relaxation techniques and
mild physical exercise prior to sleep can help.
Itching/pruritus b p. 805
Nausea and vomiting >80% from 4–6wk—~½ vomit. Occurs at
any time of day (‘morning’ sickness in <20%) and made worse by odours
associated with preparation/sight of food. If severe exclude multiple
pregnancy, trophoblastic disease, and UTI. Symptoms usually improve by
14–16wk although persist in some.
Management Reassure—normal part of pregnancy. Adjust lifestyle, e.g.
ask partner to do the shopping. Advise frequent small meals—avoid
greasy/spicy foods, eat foods you can face (varies). Maintain fluid intake—
small amounts frequently. Self-help measures include gingerCE and P6
acupressureCE. If severe/disabling consider antiemeticsCE, e.g. cyclizine
50mg tds. Suppositories are an effective method of administration if po
route is not tolerated. If dehydrated or >2–5kg weight loss (hyperemesis
gravidarum—1%, pregnancies) admit for rehydration.
Peripheral paraesthesia Abnormalities of sensation (e.g. tingling,
pins and needles) of hands/feet are common. Reassure. Symptoms usually
resolve after delivery. Carpal tunnel syndrome—b p. 486.
Skin changes Pigmentation (e.g. linea nigra); spider naevi; abdominal
striae; chloasma/merasma; palmar erythema. Skin rashes b p. 805.
Sweating and feeling hot Common. Check apyrexial. If apyrexial,
reassure normal in pregnancy. If pyrexial, look for a source of infection.
Swelling Fluid retention affects 80%—ankles, hands/fingers, face. If
severe/sudden i in oedema, exclude pre-eclampsia (check BP, dipstick
urine for protein).
Symphysis pubis dysfunction 3%. Symphysis separates causing
discomfort/pain in lower abdomen/pelvic area radiating to lower back,
upper thighs, and perineum. Pain is constant and worse on movement
and resolves on rest. Treat with simple analgesia. Consider referral to
physiotherapy for pelvic support belt or elbow crutches. Advise rest in a
semi-recumbent position when in pain. Generally resolves after delivery
but if persists refer to orthopaedics.
Urinary frequency Check MSU—UTI is common in pregnancy and
associated with premature delivery—b p. 812.
Vaginal discharge Usually i in pregnancy. Investigate if smelly, itchy,
sore, or associated with dysuria.
Varicose veins Cause aching legs, fatigue, itch, and ankle/foot swelling.
If ankles are swollen, exclude pre-eclampsia (check BP, dipstick urine
for proteinuria). Elevate legs when sitting, provide support stockings,
and encourage walking/discourage standing still. Complications include
thrombophlebitis—treat with ice packs, elevation, support stockings, and
analgesia—and DVT (b p. 824).

Pruritus and rashes in pregnancy

Presentation with itching If a woman presents with itching, look for
a rash. If there is no rash consider:

Hepatic causes Pruritus gravidarum or recurrent cholestasis of pregnancy
affects 2–20 in every 100 pregnancies and sometimes runs in families.
Usually begins in the third trimester reaching a peak in the last 1mo.
• Frank jaundice Rare—refer urgently to an obstetrician
• No jaundice Check LFTs. Refer to obstetrics if abnormal. Otherwise,
treat with moisturizers (e.g. Diprobase) 9 oily calamine. Antihistamines
do not help
Pruritus gravidarum disappears after delivery but recurs in subsequent
pregnancies (40–50%) and may recur with CHC.
Other causes
• Endocrine DM, thyrotoxicosis, hypothyroidism—consider checking
fasting blood glucose and TFTs
• Renal Chronic renal failure—check U&E and Cr
• Haematological Iron deficiency—check FBC and ferritin
• Drug allergies
• Psychological Obsessive states, schizophrenia
0 If no cause is found and the problem persists, refer to obstetrics.

Presentation with a rash Consider:

• Common skin diseases, e.g. eczema, psoriasis, urticaria
• Skin changes specific to pregnancy
• Infectious causes:
• EBV
• Streptococcal infection
• Rubella
• Meningococcal infection • CMV
• Parvovirus B19
• Syphilis
• Enterovirus infection
• Chickenpox/shingles
• Measles
Itchy rashes specific to pregnancy
• Abdominal striae May itch
• Pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy (PUPPP) 1 in
240 pregnancies. Occurs in first/multiple pregnancies or if excessive
weight i in pregnancy. Intensely itchy rash usually confined to lower
abdomen/buttocks. Appears at >35wk gestation. Treat with calamine
and/or topical steroids. Clears spontaneously <6wk (often days) after
delivery. Recurrence in subsequent pregnancies is rare
• Pemphigoid gestationis Rare. Starts in mid-pregnancy and appears as a
generalized, intensely itchy rash. Refer for specialist management. May
recur in subsequent pregnancies/with CHC
• Impetigo herpetiformis Rare. Starts in the third trimester. Mild itch.
Systemically unwell. Refer. Remits after delivery but may recur in later
pregnancies

Pregnancy

Rubella and parvovirus in pregnancy
Rubella Presents with fever, LNs (including suboccipital nodes), and a
pink maculopapular rash which lasts 3d. 50% of mothers infected with
rubella are asymptomatic. Incubation is 14–21d and once infected, patients
are infectious from 7d before the rash appears until 7d after. Asymptomatic
reinfection of women who have received vaccination can also occur, so
serology is essential in all pregnant rubella contacts.

Risk to the baby Abnormalities that can occur include: cataract, deafness,
cerebral palsy, mental retardation, microcephaly, microphthalmia. If the
mother is infected with rubella at >20wk gestation, infection does not
affect the baby.
Transmission risk to the baby
• <11wk gestation 90% have adverse outcome
• 11–16wk gestation 20% have adverse outcome
• >16wk gestation minimal risk of deafness only
Transmission risk is much lower with reinfection (<5%). There is no treatment to prevent transmission.
Management
• Contact with a non-vesicular rash or rubella— see Figure 23.4,
b p. 804
• Presentation with a non-specific, non-vesicular rash or suspected
rubella infection—send blood for serology for rubella and parvovirus
B19 (see Figure 23.6). Refer if proven infection. After further
investigation and discussion of risks, women infected with rubella at
<20wk may be offered termination of pregnancy
Vaccination after pregnancy Give postnatal MMR vaccination routinely to
all women found not to be rubella-immune in pregnancy.
Parvovirus B19 infection Febrile illness often accompanied by
tenderness of the joints/arthritis affecting hands, wrists, and knees—usually
lasts 1–2wk. There may be a fine rash over the trunk and extremities.
Infectious from 10d before rash appears. Incubation period 13–18d.
Parvovirus B19 in pregnancy 750% of young women in the UK are not
immune. Risk of infection in pregnancy ~1 in 400. Risk of a non-immune
mother contracting the infection from a child who has Fifth disease
(slapped cheek) is ~50%.
Risk to the baby If infection is at <20wk gestation, there is a 9% i mis­
carriage rate. 3% (14–56 babies/y in the UK) develop hydrops fetalis >3wk
after infection due to anaemia—½ of those babies die. There are no
long-term effects from an infection which does not cause miscarriage or
hydrops.
Transmission rate to the baby Depends on gestation at the time of
infection. There is no treatment to prevent transmission.
• <4wk gestation there is no transmission
• From 5–16wk gestation transmission rate ~15%
• >16wk gestation 25–70% transmission rate (i with gestation)

Rubella and parvovirus in pregnancy

Management
• Contact with a non-vesicular rash or parvovirus—see Figure 23.4,
b p. 804
• Presentation with a non-specific, non-vesicular rash or suspected
parvovirus infection—send blood for serology for rubella and parvovirus
B19 (see Figure 23.5). Refer if proven infection. USS surveillance is
started 4wk after onset of illness or seroconversion and then every
1–2 wk until 30wk. If there are any signs of hydrops fetalis on USS, the
mother is referred to a regional centre for consideration of intrauterine
transfusion. Early transfusion i chances of the baby’s survival

Pregnancy

Other rash illnesses in pregnancy
Cytomegalovirus (CMV) More frequent cause of birth defect than

rubella in the UK—5 in 1,000 live births—10% develop handicap. The fetus
is most vulnerable when infection occurs in early pregnancy. Maternal disease may be asymptomatic or a mild flu-like illness. Occasionally there is a
rash. No effective prevention strategy.
Measles Rare in the UK since introduction of routine MMR vaccination
for children. Presents with coryza, lymphadenopathy, conjunctivitis,
and disseminated maculopapular rash which becomes confluent.
Complications include pneumonia, otitis media, and encephalitis. Infection
in pregnancy can lead to intrauterine death and preterm delivery. There
are no associations with congenital infection or abnormalities.
Exposure to possible measles infection See Figure 23.4, b p. 804
Treatment of neonates Human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) is given
to neonates born to mothers with a measles rash that appears from 6d
before to 6d after birth.
Vaccination after pregnancy Give postnatal MMR vaccination routinely to
all women found not to be measles-immune in pregnancy.
Chickenpox Contact with chickenpox in pregnancy is common. People
with chickenpox are infectious from 2d before the rash appears until the
rash has finished cropping and crusted over. Incubation period is 14–21d.
Pre-conceptual prevention An effective chickenpox vaccine is available in
the UK. There is no UK policy to screen women for immunity to varicella
infection, however it is possible to check immune status and vaccinate
non-immune women prior to pregnancy. Pregnancy should be avoided for
3mo after immunization.
Exposure in pregnancy If the mother has definitely had chickenpox there
is no risk to herself or the baby. If she does not recall having chickenpox, check her immunity—80% have antibodies from silent infection (see
Figure 23.4, b p. 804).
In cases of ‘at risk’ exposure Arrange for VZ-Ig to be given to mother
and/or baby. This can be lifesaving and significantly d disease severity if
given ≤10d after exposure. Babies are at risk if:
•	The mother develops chickenpox from 7d before to 7d after delivery
•	The mother is not immune and the baby is exposed to chickenpox
<7d after birth
•	The baby has been exposed to chickenpox and has potentially
inadequate transfer of maternal antibodies (e.g. preterm babies
<28wk, babies weighing <1,000g at birth, babies who have had blood
transfusions).VZ-Ig can be given without antibody testing to these
babies, but where possible, test
• Duration of protection from VZ-Ig is limited. Give a second dose if still
at risk and further exposure occurs and ≥3wk since first dose. Check
antibody status again before giving second dose
X Some advocate use of prophylactic aciclovir for women with significant
additional risk factors, e.g. immunosuppression, smokers, women who did
not receive early VZ-Ig, or those in the second half of pregnancy.

Other rash illnesses in pregnancy

Risk to the mother Chickenpox infection complicates 2–3 in 1,000 pregnancies. Chickenpox pneumonia is more common (10%) and can be
severe (1 in 1,000 mortality).
Risk to the baby Rates of transmission are higher later in pregnancy (750%
>36wk; 5–10% <28wk). Infection:
• <20wk Causes miscarriage. Fetal varicella syndrome affects 1–2%—
segmental skin defects/scarring, limb hypoplasia 9 paresis, low birth
weight, microcephaly, neurological abnormalities (e.g. hypotonia, eye
defects). May occur up to 28wk gestation
• 20–37wk Intrauterine infection or death, shingles in childhood
• 1wk before–1wk after delivery All babies should be given VZ-Ig.
Onset 4d before delivery–2d after delivery carries a 20% risk of
overwhelming neonatal infection—these babies should be given
aciclovir in addition to VZ-Ig. Seek specialist advice
Management If clinical doubt, confirm infection by detection of varicella
virus, antigen, or DNA in vesicle fluid (see Figure 23.5, b p. 807). Treat
with aciclovir 800mg 5x/d po for 1wk if presents <24h after the rash appears
and the mother is >20wk gestation. Monitor daily. If <28wk gestation, refer
for detailed USS 5wk after infection to exclude fetal varicella syndrome.
Admit if
• Chest symptoms
• Haemorrhagic rash or bleeding
• Neurological symptoms other than headache
• Severe disease—dense rash/numerous mucosal lesions
• Significant immunosuppression, e.g. HIV +ve
Consider admission if
• Pregnancy approaching term
• Smoker
• Bad obstetric history
• Chronic lung disease
• Poor social circumstances
•	Unable to monitor the woman closely, e.g homeless, traveller
Refer for urgent hospital assessment if no deterioration but:
• Fever persists, or
• Cropping of the rash continues >6d
0 Warn pregnant women with chickenpox to avoid contact with anyone
potentially at risk of developing severe chickenpox, especially other pregnant women or neonates.

Rash infections that cause no harm to the fetus
•	Epstein–Barr virus (EBV)
•	Enteroviruses—Coxsackie virus A/B; echovirus; enterovirus 68–71—
cause disease, such as hand, foot, and mouth. Some enteroviruses can
cause severe neonatal infection, and prophylactic immunoglobulin may
be necessary—seek specialist advice

Pregnancy

Other infections in pregnancy
Bacterial vaginosis Present in ~10% of pregnant women—asymptomatic in half. Associated with i preterm birth (x 2). There is no screening
policy in the UK, but, if detected:
•	Treat with metronidazole po—400mg bd for 7d or 2g stat
• An alternative is clindamycin 2% cream 5g nocte PV for 1wk
0 Treatment may not lower the risk to the pregnancy.

Chickenpox b p. 808
Chlamydia 71 in 20 pregnant women has chlamydia infection. During
pregnancy, chlamydia infection is associated with IUGR, preterm birth,
and low birthweight. It can also pass to the baby during delivery, causing
eye and/or chest infections. Postpartum, chlamydia can cause womb
infection. Treat if detected (b p. 740)—follow-up with swabs to confirm
eradication. Refer any affected neonates for expert advice.
Screening As part of the National Chlamydia Screening Programme,
women <25y can ask for chlamydia self-test kits at a variety of healthcare and community settings. Otherwise there is no evidence of
cost-effectiveness of routine antenatal screening for STIs apart from HIV
and hepatitis B.

Coughs, colds, and ‘flu Little threat to the pregnancy itself. Advise:
fluids, paracetamol, and rest. Inhaled decongestants are safe, but avoid
cough linctus and OTC composite preparations. Treat any secondary
infections as needed.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) b p. 808 Enteroviruses b p. 809
Genital herpesG Affects ~10% of the UK population (diagnosis made

in 1 in 3). Risk is greatest if the primary attack occurs at >34wk gestation.
Secondary attacks are much less of a problem. Risks include:
• Passing the infection to the baby at the time of delivery
•	Early labour
• IUGR (primary infection only)
0 Elective Caesarean section is advised at term if a primary attack occurs
during pregnancy at >28wk gestation. It is controversial if Caesarean section is preferable if there is an active secondary attack at the time of
labour.
Gonorrhoea <1 in 1,000 pregnancies. Can pass to the baby during
delivery, causing eye infections. Treat if detected—b p. 741. Refer
affected infants urgently for expert advice. Follow-up with swabs to
confirm eradication.
Group B streptococcus (GBS)G Bacterium carried in the vagina
by >1 in 4 pregnant women (20% of non-pregnant women). Usually
harmless but if transmitted to the baby during delivery can cause neonatal
septicaemia, pneumonia, or meningitis.

Other infections in pregnancy

Prevention of neonatal infection There is currently no UK screening programme to detect women carrying group B streptococcal infection during pregnancy. Treatment with IV antibiotics during labour is advised in
‘high-risk’ scenarios only:
•	Early labour <37wk
• Prolonged (>18h) or early (<37wk) rupture of the membranes
•	Group B streptococcus detected in urine in pregnancy
• If the woman has a temperature >37.8oC during labour
• If a previous baby has been affected with the condition (10x i risk)
0 If found incidentally during pregnancy (e.g. detected on a swab done
for another reason), there is no evidence that treatment is effective.
However antibiotics are given during labour.
Hepatitis B Prevalence of HBsAg in pregnancy is up to 1% (depending
on geographical area). Women are routinely offered screening for
hepatitis B infection in pregnancy. Transmission to the baby occurs during
labour (up to 30% of infants of women seropositive for HBsAg and 90%
of infants of women seropositive for both HBsAg and HBeAg). Infants
infected are at high risk (~90%) of becoming chronic carriers and of
developing chronic liver disease 9 premature death.
Postnatally Refer infected women for hepatology assessment. Infected
mothers should not donate their milk.
Immunization Give hepatitis B vaccine as soon as possible after birth
to babies born to carrier mothers with the addition of immunoglobulin
(HBIG) if the mother carries the hepatitis B e-antigen or had acute HBV
infection during pregnancy. 85–95% effective in preventing neonatal hepatitis B infection. Further doses of vaccine are required at 1 and 2mo of age,
and a booster dose at 1y at the same time as follow-up testing.
Hepatitis C Prevalence in pregnant women is 0.14–0.8%. Except when
initial infection of the mother occurs during pregnancy (when transfer rate
is much higher), transmission rate to the fetus is 5%. To date there is
no evidence that HCV can be transferred to the child by breastfeeding.
Infants at risk can be screened for HCV infection at 12mo (RNA screen)
or 18–24mo (HCV antibody test). The majority of infants that acquire
HCV infection via their mothers develop chronic hepatitis. Treatment is
with interferon and achieves viral clearance rates of 40%.
HIV Prevalence of HIV among pregnant women in the UK varies from
0.04% to 0.4% depending on geographical area. Up to 50% of infants of HIV
seropositive mothers are pre- or perinatally infected with HIV, accounting
for 90% of HIV infections in childhood. Avoidance of breastfeeding,
antiretroviral therapy, and appropriate management of delivery d risk
of transmission to <1%. A detailed fetal anomaly scan is important if
there is first trimester exposure to antiviral treatment (including folate
antagonists) as possible i risk of congenital abnormality.
0 There is a theoretical concern of mother-to-child transmission with
invasive prenatal diagnosis. Take specialist advice.

Pregnancy

Fetal abnormalities include Wide set eyes, short nose, patulous lips, ‘box’
forehead, and growth failure. However diagnosis is usually made between
6mo and 2y of age when the child presents with lymphadenopathy, recurrent or opportunistic infections, failure to thrive, or progressive encephalopathy. Expert advice is needed throughout pregnancy and for neonatal
follow-up.

Listeriosis Rare. May occur in epidemics. Infection of the mother is

usually via infected food, e.g. pâté, soft cheese, milk. Detection is with
blood cultures. Suspect if unexplained fever >48h, and refer for expert
advice.
Maternal symptoms Fever, shivering, myalgia, headache, sore throat,
cough, vomiting, diarrhoea, vaginitis.
Consequences Miscarriage (may be recurrent), stillbirth, premature
labour, transmission to the fetus (in 2nd/3rd trimester). Infection in the
newborn infant manifests in pneumonia 9 meningitis.
Prevention See Box 23.2.

Malaria Serious complications are more common in pregnancy (cerebral

malaria has 50% mortality). Suspect in any pregnant woman who has a
fever and has recently visited an infected area. Seek immediate expert
advice.

Measles b p. 808      Parvovirus B19 b p. 806
Rubella b p. 806
Syphilis Prevalence 0.07%. 770–100% of pregnant mothers with primary,

untreated syphilis transmit the disease to the fetus (1 in 3 die in utero). In
the early latent phase, risk of transmission is 740% and 710–15% in the late
latent phase. Neurological abnormalities as a result of congenital syphilis
include encephalopathy and sensorineural deafness. Treatment d risk of
transmission by >98%. Refer for specialist assessment if +ve result on
routine antenatal VDRL testing. 0 +ve result is NOT specific to syphilis.

Thrush More common in pregnancy. Not harmful to the fetus. Requires
treatment only if causes troublesome itching, soreness, or discharge.
Treatment: imidazole pessaries for 1wk.

Toxoplasmosis Caused by a parasite found in raw meat and cat faeces.

Up to 90% of women have not had toxoplasmosis before pregnancy and
~2 in 1,000 will catch it during pregnancy. 30–40% pass it to their fetus.
Infection may result in miscarriage, stillbirth, growth problems, blindness,
hydrocephalus, brain damage, epilepsy, or deafness. Risk of transmission
to the fetus is related to gestation at the time of infection—third trimester
~70%; first trimester ~15%. If infection is suspected refer for specialist
advice. Prevention—see Box 23.2.

Urinary tract infections 1 in 25 women develops UTI in pregnancy.
If suspected, send MSU to confirm diagnosis and start antibiotics (e.g.
cefalexin 250mg tds) immediately. Recurrent UTIs in pregnancy should be
investigated—consider renal ultrasound >12wk after delivery.

Other infections in pregnancy

Screening for UTI Routine screening with MSU for UTI is offered at booking. 2–5% of pregnant women have asymptomatic bacteriuria, defined as
pure growth of >105 organisms/mL—1 in 3 will develop symptomatic
infection (acute cystitis, pyelonephritis) if left untreated. Both untreated
bacteriuria and frank UTI are associated with preterm delivery and IUGR.
Treat for at least 1wk with suitable antibiotic (avoid trimethoprim). Check
MSU following treatment to ensure infection has cleared.

Whooping cough New born babies are at particular risk of severe
whooping cough infection. Pregnant women are advised to have whooping
cough vaccination from 28–38wk (ideally 28–32wk) gestation to provide
passive immunity for their babies.
Box 23.2 Advice for pregnant women on prevention of
toxoplasmosis and listeriosis
• Only eat well-cooked meat
• Wash hands, cooking utensils, and food surfaces after preparing
raw meat
• Keep raw meat and cooked foods on separate plates
• Wash all soil from fruit and vegetables before eating
• If possible get someone else to clean cat litter or use gloves and
wash hands afterwards
•	Use gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards

Pregnancy

Bleeding in early pregnancy
Bleeding up to 14wk into pregnancy Bleeding in early pregnancy
occurs in 1 in 4 pregnancies. Causes:
• Bleeding in normal pregnancy—largest group
• Miscarriage
•	Ectopic pregnancy
•	Trophoblastic disease
• Non-obstetric conditions, e.g. friable cervix, polyp, cervical neoplasia

• Any sexually active woman presenting with abdominal pain and vaginal bleeding after an interval of amenorrhoea has an ectopic pregnancy
until proven otherwise.
Assessment
•	Take a history of pain and bleeding—pain preceding bleeding suggests
ectopic pregnancy is more likely. Have any products of conception
been passed? 0 Clots/products can be difficult to distinguish
• Check LMP and pregnancy test result (do a test if needed)
• Check pulse (>100bpm suggests shock), BP, and temperature (? toxic)
• Abdominal examination—guarding, peritonism, and/or unilateral
tenderness suggest ectopic pregnancy
• Pelvic examination—with the advent of early pregnancy assessment
units (EPAU), the necessity of pelvic examination is debatable. If
performed, assess uterine size, cervix—is the cervix open? (A closed
cervix admits only one fingertip in a multiparous woman). Is there any
other cause for the bleeding?
Initial management If severe bleeding and/or pain, shocked, or toxic,
admit to gynaecology as an emergency. If shocked, give 1mL Syntometrine®
IM, if available, and try to gain IV access. Otherwise, refer to the EPAU to
check site and viability of pregnancy with USS:
• At 5wk gestation, sac 9 yolk sac is seen on scan
• At 6–7wk a fetal pole and fetal heart beat is usually seen
Blood group and rhesus status is also checked at the EPAU (b p. 820).
Complications of bleeding Significant sub-chorionic haematoma is
associated with i risk of premature rupture of membranes and IUGR—
refer early for specialist antenatal care.
• Rhesus-negative women 0 If there is clinical doubt, give anti-D
Bleeding <12wk gestation Anti-D is not required for:
•	Threatened miscarriage unless heavy or repeated bleeding and/or
abdominal pain, or
• Complete miscarriage where no medical or surgical uterine evacuation
Bleeding >12wk gestation, ectopic pregnancy, and/or medical/surgical
evacuation of the uterus at any gestation Give anti-D immunoglobulin
(250iu IM if gestation <20wk) within 72h of bleeding— whether or not the
pregnancy is lost—b p. 820.

Bleeding in early pregnancy

Bleeding in early normal pregnancy Often termed threatened

miscarriage. If fetal heart is seen on USS then there is 797% chance of
the pregnancy continuing to progress. There is no evidence that rest or
abstinence from sex improves outcome.
Miscarriage Also termed spontaneous abortion. Occurs in 1 in 5
pregnancies—80% at <12wk gestation. Risk factors:
• Maternal age ≥35y or paternal age ≥40y    • Smoking
• BMI >29kg/m2—if >32kg/m2, risk is i by 30%   • Excess alcohol
Causes
• Fetal abnormality (50%)
• Multiple pregnancy
•	Uterine abnormality—fibroids, polyps; congenital abnormality; cervical
incompetence (b p. 816—late second trimester miscarriages)
• Systemic disease—renal, autoimmune, or connective tissue disease—
particularly SLE, PCOS, DM, systemic infection
• Drugs—cytotoxics, diethylstilbestrol
• Placental vascular abnormalities
Classification
• Complete miscarriage History of bleeding. No products of
conception in the uterus. Provide psychological support
• Incomplete miscarriage Bleeding. Products of conception remain in
the uterus but there is no fetal heart. Usually admitted for evacuation
of retained products of conception (ERPC). Some women prefer a
‘watch and wait’ approach—at 3d 86% will be complete
• Missed (or delayed) miscarriage No bleeding. Usually discovered
when no heart beat is seen on routine antenatal scan. Treatment is
with ERPC. A ‘watch and wait’ approach is possible, but at 4wk only
66% are complete, and associated with longer bleeding

Medical management with prostaglandin analogues 9 antiprogesterone
priming is an alternative to ERPC and offered in some units.
0 There is no evidence that abstinence from pregnancy for a time after
miscarriage is helpful—fertility may i immediately after miscarriage.
Complications
• Early Perforation of the uterus, retained products of conception,
infection. Treat with antibiotics if infection is suspected (e.g.
doxycycline 100mg od). Re-refer/readmit if shock, pain, heavy bleeding,
or bleeding is not settling
• Later Uterine synechiae (Asherman’s syndrome), cervical
incompetence, psychological sequelae
Recurrent miscarriageG ≥3 miscarriages (1–2% couples). Check:
• Age—incidence of recurrent miscarriage i with age (4 and 5)
• How many miscarriages—confirmed pregnancies (not just late,
heavy periods)? All with the same partner? What gestation? The more
miscarriages, the lower the chance of successful pregnancy
• Infertility treatment? 25–30% of women who miscarry
• Past medical history—gynaecological problems (cervical
instrumentation, PCOS); systemic disease
• Family history—recurrent miscarriage, thrombosis/thrombophilia

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Management of recurrent miscarriage Refer for further investigation;
consider checking antiphospholipid antibodies prior to referral. No cause
is found in half of those referred. They have a 70% chance of successful
pregnancy. Other treatable causes include:
• Antiphospholipid antibodies (15%). Low-dose aspirin + low molecular
weight heparin from 6–34wk improves outcome
• Inherited thrombophilia (factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation
or protein S deficiency). If recurrent miscarriage >10wk, treatment
with low molecular weight heparin i live birth rate
• Cervical incompetence Diagnosis is usually made on the basis of history
of suggestive symptoms in past pregnancies—≥1 late second trimester
or early third trimester miscarriage (usually painless leaking of liquor or
gradual painless dilatation of the cervix). Refer all women with past history
for early obstetric review. Treatment is with cervical USS monitoring with
cerclage if cervical length is <25mm (a stitch is placed high up around the
cervix to keep it closed, e.g. Shirodkar suture. The stitch is removed at
~37wk and labour ensues rapidly if the diagnosis was correct)
• Chromosomal abnormality in one parent (3–5%) Refer for specialist
genetics advice
Ectopic pregnancyG Egg implants outside the uterine cavity—95% in a
Fallopian tube. Incidence ~1 in 1,000 pregnancies. Risk factors:
• Pelvic inflammatory disease (single episode i risk x7)
•	Tubal surgery • Multiple partners
• Previous ectopic (11%)
• Age >35y
• IUD (14%)
• Smoking
• Infertility (15%)
History
• Abdominal pain (97%). Unilateral or bilateral, may start before
bleeding; radiates to shoulder tip; i on passing urine/opening bowels
• Amenorrhoea (75%). Peak incidence after 7wk amenorrhoea
• Irregular vaginal bleeding (79%). Described as ‘prune juice’ but may
be fresh blood; usually not heavy. May pass decidual cast
Examination Shock in 15–20%; abdominal tenderness 9 rebound or guarding
(71%); pelvis—enlarged uterus, adnexal mass, and/or cervical excitation.
Management Admit immediately for further investigation. Resuscitate
before admission as needed. Hospital management may be expectant
(watch and pregnancy resolves spontaneously), medical (methotrexate),
or surgical (laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery). Offer early USS in future
pregnancies to confirm pregnancy is intrauterine.
Complications Death if undetected, infertility (pregnancy rate post-ectopic
pregnancy is 66% with 10% having a further ectopic pregnancy).

Trophoblastic diseaseG
Hydatidiform mole Trophoblastic tumour containing 46 chromosomes
(usually of paternal origin) and no fetal material. 8–20% become invasive
and penetrate the uterus and/or metastasize to the lungs. Presents with:
• Bleeding in early pregnancy 9 exaggerated symptoms of pregnancy
•	Uterus is usually large for dates, and no fetal heart can be heard

Bleeding in early pregnancy

•	USS has a typical appearance; blood—ii serum β-HCG
• Rarely symptoms of metastatic spread—haemoptysis, pleurisy
Refer urgently to gynaecology. If mole is confirmed, women are followed up by specialist centres. Invasive disease requires chemotherapy.
Combined hormonal contraception is contraindicated until normal HCG
values are obtained. Pregnancy is not advised until completion of the surveillance period—investigate with early USS and β-HCG as incidence of
further molar pregnancy is ~1 in 80.
Partial mole Tumour of trophoblast containing 69 chromosomes, 1
maternal and 2 paternal sets, with some fetal tissue. A fetal heart may
be seen on early USS but is absent by 8–9wk. Treat as for mole. Rarely
becomes malignant (0.5%).
Choriocarcinoma Malignant trophoblastic tumour following molar (rarely
normal) pregnancy. Presents with vaginal bleeding and/or metastases
(shadows on CXR, dyspnoea, haemoptysis). Excellent prognosis after
treatment with chemotherapy. No contraceptive restrictions after
completion of therapy; pregnancy is possible >1y after treatment.
Placental site trophoblastic tumour (PSTT) Rare. Follows 3–4y after normal pregnancy. Presents with abnormal bleeding or amenorrhoea. Can
present with distant metastases similarly to choriocarcinoma. Treatment
is with hysterectomy 9 chemotherapy. Prognosis is good.
Psychological effects of early loss of pregnancy Broach the
subject with all women who have suffered early loss of pregnancy. Include
the woman’s partner if possible.
• Legitimize grief and acknowledge it—not all women grieve—adjust
your approach accordingly; discuss worries/concerns
• Provide information about the condition which caused the loss; risk
to future pregnancies (if <3 miscarriages, risk of further miscarriage is
not significantly i; risk of further ectopic pregnancy is ~1 in 10); and
self-help/support organizations, e.g. Miscarriage Association
• Warn of the anniversary phenomenon (sadness at the baby’s due date
or anniversary of the pregnancy loss) or sadness/jealousy on the birth
of another’s baby—provide ongoing support as needed
• If the woman already has young children, inform the health visitor

Pregnancy

Ante- and postpartum haemorrhage
Antepartum haemorrhage Any bleeding in pregnancy >24wk gestation (or the point of fetal viability) is an antepartum haemorrhage (APH).
Bleeding <14wk gestation—b p. 814.
Causes
Uterine
Lower genital tract
• Cervical—polyp; erosion; carcinoma;
• Abruption (b p. 1103)
cervicitis
• Placenta praevia
• Vaginitis
• Vasa praevia
• Vulval varicosities
• Circumvallate placenta
• Placental sinuses
• Action
• ALWAYS admit to a specialist obstetric unit. If bleeding is severe,
admit via an emergency ambulance, and whilst awaiting transport,
raise legs; give O2 via face mask; if possible, gain IV access, take blood
for FBC and cross-matching, and start IV infusion
• NEVER do a vaginal examination—placenta praevia bleeds +++

Placenta praeviaG Occurs when the placenta lies within the lower
uterine segment. Incidence: 1 in 4 routine anomaly scans done at 19wk
gestation show a low-lying placenta—5% stay low at 32wk <2% at term.
Associations
•	Twins
• i with parity
• Preterm delivery
• Age >35y
• Previous Caesarean section
• Smoking
•	Endometrial damage (e.g. history of dilatation and curettage, TOP)
• Placental pathology (marginal/vellamentous cord insertions,
succenturiate lobes, bipartite placenta)
• Previous placenta praevia (recurrence rate 4–8%)
Management If the placenta covers or overlaps the cervical os at routine
USS at 18–20wk, follow-up USS at 32wk reveals whether the placenta
is moving out of the lower segment. When the placenta remains low,
management depends on whether the placenta covers the internal os
(major placenta praevia) or not (minor placenta praevia). Major placenta
praevia always requires delivery by Caesarean section. Normal delivery
in a specialist unit may be attempted with minor placenta praevia if the
placental edge is >2cm from the internal os.
0 Women who have anterior placenta praevia on routine anomaly scanning
and who have had a previous Caesarean section may have placenta accreta.
Maternal complications
• APH—typically painless bleeding >20wk with a peak incidence at 34wk
• Malpresentation—35% breech presentation or transverse lie
• Placental problems—placenta accreta and percreta especially with a
history of previous Caesarean section; abruption
• Postpartum haemorrhage
Fetal complications IUGR (15%); premature delivery; death.

Ante- and postpartum haemorrhage

Primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) Loss of >500mL
blood within 24h of delivery. Affects 1 in 100 deliveries. May occur in the
community after home delivery, delivery in a community obstetric unit, or
after rapid discharge from a consultant-led unit.
Causes The four Ts:
•	Tone—uterine atony (90%)
•	Trauma—of the genital tract
•	Tissue—retained products of
•	Thrombin—clotting disorders
conception
Risk factors
• Low placenta
• Age >40y
• Abruption—known or suspected
• Obesity (BMI >35kg/m2)
• Asian ethnicity
• Prolonged labour (>12h)
• Anaemia (Hb <9g/dL)
• Pyrexia in labour
• Pre-eclampsia or gestational
• Caesarean section delivery
hypertension
(emergency or elective)
• Past history of PPH
• Operative vaginal delivery and/or
• Large placental site (e.g. multiple
mediolateral episiotomy
pregnancy or baby >4kg)
• Retained placenta (b p. 819)
• Action

• Call emergency ambulance for immediate transfer to hospital
•	Gain IV access, take blood for FBC and cross-matching, and start IV
infusion if possible
•	Give ergometrine 0.5mg slowly IV if available
•	Give high flow O2 via face mask as soon as possible
• If the placenta has not been delivered attempt to deliver it by
controlled cord traction
• Check for trauma and apply pressure to any visible bleeding point/
repair any visible bleeding point. Bimanual pressure on the uterus
(rubbing up the fundus) may decrease immediate loss
• Some community units keep carboprost 250 micrograms for emergency
use. Use if available—1mL by deep IM injection—repeat after 15min
0 Contraindicated in women with asthma

Secondary PPH Excessive blood loss PV >24h after delivery. Peak

incidence: 5–12d after delivery.
Cause Postpartum infection—sometimes associated with retained placental tissue or clot.
• Action
• If the woman is unwell (shocked or toxic) admit to an obstetric
unit for further investigation, intravenous antibiotics 9 evacuation of
retained products of conception
• If bleeding is slight, manage conservatively. Take a vaginal swab and
start oral antibiotics—amoxicillin 500mg tds and metronidazole 400mg
tds. Consider referral for USS and/or obstetric review if not settling

Pregnancy

Haemolytic disease and rhesus
isoimmunization
15% of women are RhD –ve. Development of anti-D antibodies results
from fetomaternal haemorrhage (FMH) in RhD –ve women carrying a
RhD +ve fetus. In later pregnancies, these antibodies cross the placenta
causing rhesus haemolytic disease of the fetus which gets successively
worse with each pregnancy.
All RhD –ve mothers are tested for D antibodies at booking, at 28wk,
and 2-weekly thereafter. Testing is not performed once women are given
anti-D prophylaxis. Anti-D titres <4u/mL (<1 in 16) are unlikely to cause
serious disease. If >10u/mL, refer for specialist advice.

Effects on the fetus
• Hydrops fetalis (oedematous fetus)

• Intrauterine death

Effects on neonate
• Jaundice
• Heart failure (oedema, ascites)
• Anaemia

•	Yellow vernix
• Hepatosplenomegaly
• CNS signs

0 All neonates with haemolytic disease should be managed by specialist paediatricians. Treatment usually involves UV light for jaundice 9
exchange transfusion.
Immunoprophylaxis Immunoprophylaxis for RhD –ve mothers using
anti-D immunoglobulin (anti-D Ig) is given IM into the deltoid muscle as
soon as possible after the sensitizing event—preferably within 72h though
there is evidence of benefit up to 9d. Women already sensitized should
not be given anti-D Ig.
Test for the size of fetomaternal haemorrhage In the UK, blood
is taken from the mother (anticoagulated sample) as soon as possible
(preferably <2h) after the sensitizing event if >20wk gestation. A Kleihauer
acid elution test detects fetal haemoglobin (HbF) and identifies women
with large fetomaternal haemorrhage who need additional anti-D Ig.
Other causes Anti-D antibodies are the most common cause of rhesus
disease. Other causes include: Rh C, E, c, e, Kell, Kidd, and Duffy. Anti-Du
antibodies are relatively common but usually harmless. Follow advice of
local transfusion service about follow-up.
0 Anti-D Ig rarely causes allergic reactions. If the woman is worried
about use of blood products, an alternative approach is to check rhesus
status of the father—if he is Rh –ve, then the baby is Rh –ve as well, so
anti-D prophylaxis is not required.

Further information

Haemolytic disease and rhesus isoimmunization

When should anti-D be administered?
Following spontaneous miscarriage
• ≥20wk—500iu + test the size of the fetomaternal haemorrhage
• 12–20wk gestation—250iu
• <12wk—only give anti-D if there has been an intervention (e.g.
ERPC) to evacuate the uterus
Following termination of pregnancy/ectopic pregnancy All non-sensitized
RhD –ve women.
If threatened miscarriage
• All non-sensitized RhD –ve women >12wk gestation
• If bleeding continues intermittently after 12wk, give anti-D Ig 6-weekly
• <12wk gestation—only administer if bleeding is heavy, repeated, or
there is associated abdominal pain (particularly if close to 12wk)
Following sensitizing events before delivery All non-sensitized RhD –ve
women after:
• Invasive prenatal diagnosis (amniocentesis, CVS, fetal blood sampling)
or other intrauterine procedures
• Antepartum haemorrhage
•	External cephalic version of the fetus
• Closed abdominal injury (e.g. RTA)
• Intrauterine death
<20wk—250iu; >20wk—500iu + test size of fetomaternal haemorrhage.
Routine antenatal prophylaxis
• 1–1.5% of RhD –ve women develop anti-D antibodies during
pregnancy due to fetomaternal haemorrhage which is usually small
and silent—most commonly in the third trimester
• Routine antenatal prophylaxis d sensitization to <0.2% and should
now be routine practice in the UK. Give irrespective of whether a
woman has had prior anti-D prophylaxis earlier in the pregnancy
• Administration of 500iu anti-D Ig at 28wk (after blood has been
taken for routine antibody screening) and 34wk gestation—or single
dose of 1500iu at 28wk—d incidence of immunization after birth
• Women who have been given antenatal prophylaxis may still be
sensitized by a large fetomaternal haemorrhage so, following any
potentially sensitizing event, additional anti-D Ig should be given and
a Kleihauer test performed
• Screening for anti-D antibodies after prophylaxis is uninterpretable
Postnatal prophylaxis
• 500IU—1,500iu (500iu in the UK) is given to every non-sensitized
RhD –ve woman <72h after delivery of a RhD +ve infant
• >99% women have a fetomaternal haemorrhage of <4mL at
delivery—a test to detect fetomaternal haemorrhage >4mL must be
done so additional anti-D Ig can be given as needed
• Risk factors for high fetomaternal haemorrhage include: traumatic
delivery, Caesarean section, manual removal of placenta, stillbirth
and intrauterine death, abdominal trauma during the third trimester,
twin pregnancy (at delivery), unexplained hydrops fetalis

Pregnancy

A–Z of medical conditions
in pregnancy
Anaemia Defined as Hb <11g/dL early in pregnancy, or <10.5g/dL after
28wk. Common in pregnancy (20%). Some d in Hb is physiological due to i
in plasma volume, however, iron requirements i x2–3 and folate i x10–20
during pregnancy. Anaemia is usually due to iron deficiency. Complications
include excessive fatigue and poorer fetal outcome. Risk factors:
• Starting pregnancy anaemic
• Multiple pregnancy
• Poor diet
• Frequent pregnancies
• Haemoglobinopathy
Screening Hb is routinely screened at booking and again at 28wk.
Management Routine use of oral iron for all pregnant women is of no
proven benefit and may cause harm. Women in high risk-groups (e.g. multiple pregnancy) may routinely be given prophylaxis—follow local policies.
If Hb is <11g/dL at booking or <10.5g/dL at 28wk, start iron (e.g. ferrous
sulfate 200mg tds) and folate (5mg od). Repeat Hb in 2wk. If there is no
response to oral iron, exclude occult infection (e.g. UTI); check haematinics; consider referral for parenteral iron.
Antiphospholipid syndrome May be primary (occurs alone)
or secondary to another connective tissue disease (usually SLE).
Antiphospholipid antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin
antibodies), are present together with a history of:
• Arterial or venous thrombosis, and/or
• Recurrent pregnancy loss (typically second trimester—b p. 815)
Specialist referral is essential. Treated with low-dose aspirin + low molecular weight heparin from 6–34wk.
Asthma Affects ~5% of pregnant women.
•	Generally improves with pregnancy, especially into the third trimester
• In most cases, treat asthma as usual—most drugs commonly used for
treatment of asthma are safe in pregnancy 0 Leukotriene receptor
antagonists have limited safety data—seek specialist advice
• Women with poorly controlled asthma are at risk of early labour and
IUGR; patients on oral steroids may need IV steroids to cover labour
• Avoid syntometrine for third stage of labour as it contains ergometrine
which can cause a severe attack
•	There is a tendency to worsening of asthma after delivery
Cardiac disease Risk of death is highest where pulmonary blood flow
cannot be i, e.g. Eisenmenger’s syndrome (maternal mortality 30–50%);
primary pulmonary hypertension (mortality 40–50%).
Management Specialist obstetric care is needed for all patients with a
pre-existing cardiac condition. Where possible refer before conception to
a cardiologist for discussion of risks. Antibiotic prophylaxis for delivery may
be needed for women with structural cardiac disease—seek specialist advice.
Murmurs in pregnancy Check heart sounds. Murmurs are common.
Consider any heart murmurs detected during pregnancy significant and
refer for further evaluation—90% will be physiological.

A–Z of medical conditions in pregnancy

Depression A significant cause of maternal death.
Pre-existing depression Consider referral for pre-conceptual psychiatric
advice. When antidepressants are being used, weigh up the pros and cons
of discontinuing treatment during pregnancy.
Screening for depression Antenatal b p. 801; postnatal b p. 839
Depression in pregnancy For women with mild/moderate depression
consider self-help strategies and talking therapies (e.g. counselling) first.
Monitor regularly using depression questionnaires (e.g. PHQ-9—b
p. 1001). Weigh up risks of antidepressant medication against benefits.
Involve specialist mental health services early.
Postnatal depression b p. 839
Diabetes b p. 828 Eclampsia b p. 1102
Epilepsy b p. 829
HIV b p. 811
Hypertension b p. 826 Infection b p. 810
Jaundice Any cause of jaundice may occur in pregnancy. Investigate and

treat according to cause. Common causes are: viral hepatitis; gallstones;
Gilbert’s or Dubin Johnson syndrome.
Jaundice peculiar to pregnancy
• Cholestasis of pregnancy/pruritus gravidarum—b p. 805
• Acute fatty degeneration of the liver Rare. Usually >30wk gestation.
The mother develops abdominal pain, jaundice, headache and vomiting.
Admit for specialist care. Prognosis: ~15–20% maternal mortality;
~20% fetal mortality
• Pre-eclampsia—b p. 826
• Severe hyperemesis Jaundice is a complication—b p. 803
Pre-eclampsia b p. 826
Renal disease Refer all women for specialist obstetric care.
Pre-eclampsia is more common—monitor carefully and refer early.
Renal failure If mild renal failure and no i BP 96% have successful pregnancies without adverse effect. Outcomes are less good the more severe
the renal failure with complications including worsening hypertension,
pregnancy-related d in renal function, IUGR, and preterm delivery.
Women on dialysis Conception is uncommon. High rate of miscarriage and
intrauterine death. 740–50% live birth rate. Mothers are prone to volume
overload, polyhydramnios, and severe exacerbations of i BP 9 pre-eclampsia.
Women need a 50% i in duration/frequency of dialysis during pregnancy.
Renal transplant Risk of first trimester miscarriage is i, but pregnancies that survive are >90% successful. Immunosuppressant drugs must be
continued—they are not harmful to the fetus. Pregnancy does not affect
long-term survival of the transplanted kidney. Pelvic position of the transplant does not compromise vaginal delivery.

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) Symptoms often improve during preg-

nancy and worsen in the puerperium. Do not use NSAIDs for joint pain
>24wk gestation as can result in closure of the fetal ductus arteriosus.
Paracetamol or paracetamol + codeine combinations are safe.

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Disease-modifying drugs
• Sulfasalazine—folic acid supplementation is recommended
• Azathioprine—associated with IUGR
• Penicillamine—may weaken fetal collagen
• Methotrexate is contraindicated
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) Exacerbations are common
in pregnancy.
• Effects on fetus IUGR; neonatal lupus (from passively acquired
maternal antibodies—usually self-limiting skin rash)
• Effects on mother Renal complications may worsen and be associated
with i BP 9 pre-eclampsia; oligohydramnios; premature delivery
Management If planning pregnancy refer for review of drugs. Once pregnant refer for specialist obstetric care. Pain control—as for RA.
Immunosuppressive drugs
• Azathioprine—may cause IUGR
• Hydroxychloroquine—risk of deposits in fetal eye/ear
• Cyclophosphamide and methotrexate are contraindicated
Thyroid disease Refer for specialist obstetric advice.
Hyperthyroidism Usually Graves’ disease. Severity d through pregnancy.
May be associated with neonatal goitre, hyper- or hypothyroidism.
Continue treatment with carbimazole aiming to keep plasma T4 at the top
of the normal range. Propylthiouracil is preferred postpartum if breastfeeding, as less concentrated in breast milk.
Hypothyroidism If untreated associated with infertility, i rate of miscarriage, stillbirth, and fetal abnormality. Levothyroxine dose usually needs to
i in pregnancy—the fetus is not affected by maternal thyroxine. Check
TFTs in each trimester.
ThromboembolismG Most common direct cause of maternal death
in the UK. Pregnancy i risk of thromboembolism x10—even in very early
pregnancy. Incidence: ~1 in 100 pregnancies (20–50% antenatal).
• Suspect DVT and/or PE in any woman who is pregnant or in the
puerperium who has:
• Leg pain and/or swelling
• Mild unexplained fever
• Chest pain and/or breathlessness
Management If suspected, refer as an emergency for confirmation of
diagnosis and initiation of treatment. D-dimer tests are unreliable in pregnancy and should not be used.
If DVT/PE is confirmed, the woman is anticoagulated during the remainder of pregnancy and for ≥6wk postpartum (minimum 3mo total). Avoid
warfarin during pregnancy—use low molecular weight heparin (LMWH)
instead. Warfarin is safe postpartum and during breastfeeding.
Haematology review is usual before stopping anticoagulation. Advise
women to wear graduated compression hosiery for ≥2y after DVT.

A–Z of medical conditions in pregnancy

Antenatal prevention Assess risk of thrombosis:

Pregnancy

Hypertension in pregnancy
Chronic hypertension Hypertension present <20wk into pregnancy

(or woman taking antihypertensive medication prior to pregnancy). More
common in older mothers. May worsen in later pregnancy.

Management Consider changing medication (especially if taking ACE
inhibitor, ARB, or chlorthiazide) to antihypertensive drugs known to be
safe in pregnancy (e.g methyldopa, nifedipine, or A-blocker). Monitor BP
carefully aiming to keep BP <150/100 (<140/90 if target organ damage).
Pre-eclampsia is i x5.
Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) i BP appearing >20wk
into pregnancy and resolving <3mo after delivery. Affects 10% of pregnancies and risk of pre-eclampsia is i. Treatment is the same as for chronic
hypertension. i risk of developing hypertension later in life.
Pre-eclampsia (PET)N Affects 5–7% of primigravida and 2–3% of all
pregnancies. Multisystem disease of unknown cause, developing ≥20wk
into pregnancy and resolving <10d after the birth. Untreated, may progress to eclampsia—b p. 1102.
Risk factors for pre-eclampsia Evaluate at booking:
Moderate risk
High risk
• Hypertensive disease during previous
• First pregnancy
pregnancy
• Age ≥40y
• Chronic kidney disease
• Pregnancy interval >10y
• BMI ≥35kg/m2 at first visit • Autoimmune disease, e.g. SLE or
antiphospholipid syndrome
• Family history of
• Type 1 or type 2 DM
pre-eclampsia
• Chronic hypertension
• Multiple pregnancy
If ≥1 high risk factor or ≥2 moderate risk factors, advise aspirin 75mg from
12wk to birth and refer <20wk for specialist obstetric care.
Criteria for diagnosis
• BP >140/90 or >+30/+15 from booking The earlier in pregnancy the
BP rises, the more likely the pre-eclampsia will be severe
• Proteinuria �0.3g/24h Urine dipstick is a useful screening tool—if ≥1+
protein then probably significant—but 725% false +ve rate
Interval for routine BP checks Pre-eclampsia is asymptomatic until its terminal phase, and onset may be rapid. Frequent BP screening is essential.
Whenever you check BP, always check urine for protein.
• If no risk factors for pre-eclampsia—routine antenatal care
• If 1 moderate risk factor for pre-eclampsia, recheck BP at least every
3wk from 24–32wk gestation and at least every 2wk >32wk gestation
• If ≥1 high risk factor or ≥2 moderate risk factors, monitor as directed
by the specialist
Thresholds for further action See Table 23.5
Risk of recurrence In subsequent pregnancy with the same partner—10–15% (usually less severe). Greater risk of i BP later in life.

Pregnancy

Diabetes and epilepsy in pregnancy
Pre-existing DM Affects 2–3 in 1,000 pregnancies. 95% have IDDM.
Effects on the fetus
• In utero Large for dates or IUGR; fetal hyperinsulinaemia; i congenital
abnormalities (cardiac, renal, and neural tube defects); hypoxia and
intrauterine death (especially >36wk)
• Postnatally Hypoglycaemia; transient tachypnoea of the newborn or
respiratory distress syndrome; neonatal jaundice
Effects on the mother Problems are more common if poor control.
• In pregnancy First trimester miscarriage; premature labour;
pre-eclampsia; pyelonephritis; polyhydramnios; i retinopathy
• In labour Fetal distress; obstruction (especially shoulder dystocia)
Management pre-pregnancy Suggest counselling via a diabetic specialist.
Pay careful attention to diabetic control (aim BM 4–6mmol/L pre-meals).
Advise folate supplements 5mg od until 13wk. Stop drugs contraindicated
in pregnancy, e.g. ACE inhibitors, sulfonylureas.
Management during pregnancy Refer to an obstetrician early. Most
women with insulin-dependent DM continue to use their pre-pregnancy
insulin regime but requirements i 2–3x in pregnancy. Metformin is safe
in pregnancy for women with non-insulin dependent DM. USS is used
to monitor fetal growth and exclude structural abnormalities. Delivery
should always take place in a specialist unit with neonatal care facilities.
Retinal screening Retinopathy can worse in pregnancy. Retinal screening
is important:
• At booking for all women with pre-existing DM
• At 16–20wk if any retinopathy at booking
• At 28wk for all women with pre-existing DM (not gestational DM)
Management postnatally d insulin to pre-pregnancy levels (if breastfeeding may need less). Take specialist advice regarding oral hypoglycaemics
and breastfeeding.
Gestational diabetes DM with onset/first recognition in pregnancy.
Affects 2% of pregnancies and usually develops in the second trimester.
Lower risk of congenital malformation than if pre-existing DM. Intensive
management can achieve almost normal rates of macrosomia and neonatal
hypoglycaemia, but there is debate whether that is necessary.
Risk factors
• Previous macrosomic baby (≥4.5kg) • BMI >30kg/m2
• DM in a first-degree relative
• Previous gestational DM
• Family origin associated with high prevalence of DM: South Asian
(especially Indian subcontinent); black Caribbean; Middle Eastern
Screening b p. 800
Management Initially diet; some may require metformin (unlicensed)
and up to 30% require insulin. Insulin is stopped immediately postpartum.
Check a 6wk postpartum oral glucose tolerance test. Gestational DM usually recurs in future pregnancies; >30% develop DM in <10y.

Diabetes and epilepsy in pregnancy

Glycosuria in pregnancy Routine screening for glycosuria in
pregnancy is not advised. Pregnant women have d renal threshold and a
physiologically i plasma glucose level, so dipstick testing gives a high false
+ve rate. If glycosuria is detected repeat the urine test—if still +ve arrange
an oral glucose tolerance test.
Epilepsy in pregnancy 90% have normal pregnancies/healthy babies.
Antenatal effects on the fetus Anti-epileptic drugs including phenytoin,
primidone, phenobarbital, lamotrigine, and carbamazepine, are teratogenic—especially if taken in the first trimester and if taking ≥2 drugs.
Valproate is associated with the highest risk of congenital malformation
and developmental delay. Topiramate is also associated with i risk of cleft
palate if taken in the first trimester.
Peri/postnatal effects on the fetus Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn
is associated with anti-epileptic drugs—all babies should have IM vitamin K
at birth; the child has i risk of epilepsy.
Effects on the mother
• In pregnancy 10% have i fit frequency. The fetus is at slightly i risk of
harm during a generalized tonic-clonic fit but absolute risk of harm is
low. There is no evidence simple partial, complex partial, absence, or
myoclonic seizures harm pregnancy in any way, unless the patient falls.
Status epilepticus is associated with high infant and maternal mortality
• In labour/puerperium 1–4% have fit during labour and a further 1–2%
<48h after delivery
Management pre-pregnancy Discuss risks of epilepsy/anti-epileptic medication and pregnancy with all women who have epilepsy and are of childbearing age—whether or not contemplating pregnancy. Suggest referral
to a neurologist for optimization of anti-epileptic drug regimes prior to
pregnancy; avoid sodium valproate. Advise folic acid 5mg od from the time
pregnancy is being planned until 13wk after conception.
Management during pregnancy Refer for specialist obstetric care—joint
management by an obstetrician and neurologist is ideal. Anti-epileptic drug
dose adjustments may be needed depending on clinical symptoms 9 drug
levels. Delivery should occur in a specialist centre where any fits can be
managed. Encourage women to notify their pregnancy to the UK Epilepsy
and Pregnancy Register (M www.epilepsyandpregnancy.co.uk).
Management postnatally Breastfeeding is not contraindicated if taking monotherapy, but infants should be monitored for side effects of
anti-epileptic medication. If drug dose is i in pregnancy, it may need to d
after delivery. All babies should have IM vitamin K due to i risk of haemorrhage. Risk of injury to the child from maternal seizure is low. Discuss child
care and minimizing risks to the child from the mother’s epilepsy.

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Intrauterine growth and malpresentation
Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)G Babies may be small
because they are premature, small for their gestation, or a combination
of the two. Babies weighing <10th centile weight for their gestational age
(IUGR) have different problems to premature babies.
Predisposing factors The major antenatal indicator for IUGR is low maternal weight at booking (<51kg). Others include:
• Severe maternal anaemia
• Multiple pregnancy
• Maternal heart or renal disease
• Malformation
• Previous history of small baby
• Infection
• Low weekly maternal weight i
• Maternal smoking
(<0.2kg)
• Maternal DM
• Pre-eclampsia
Antenatal detection Difficult to detect; about half are not detected until
after birth. Most GPs will encounter IUGR when they do a routine antenatal check and find the symphysis-fundal height (SFH) is less than would
be expected for the gestation. Other suspicious signs are oligohydramnios
and poor fetal movements. Confirm suspicions with USS then seek specialist obstetric advice. Where the head circumference is relatively spared
suspect placental insufficiency.
Consequences
• Labour More susceptible to hypoxia in labour, so require monitoring
in a specialist unit where Caesarean section facilities are available and
there is paediatric back-up
• Postnatal problems Susceptible to neonatal hypoglycaemia and
jaundice. Babies <2kg may have problems with temperature regulation
and require incubator facilities
• Long-term effects More prone in later life to cardiovascular disease
and type 2 DM
Oligohydramnios Liquor volume <500mL. Rare. Associated with:
• Fetal abnormality (renal agenesis,
• Prolonged pregnancy
urethral aplasia)
• PROM (b p. 832)
• Placental insufficiency
Confirm diagnosis with USS then refer for specialist obstetric assessment.

Large for dates Consider:

• Multiple pregnancy
• Fetal abnormality
• Molar pregnancy
• Maternal DM
• Polyhydramnios
• Large baby (>90th centile)—may have past history of large babies
Refer for USS to confirm diagnosis and exclude fetal abnormality or multiple pregnancy. Check maternal oral glucose tolerance test.
Polyhydramnios Liquor volume >2L; affects 0.15% pregnancies. Causes
• Fetal abnormality, e.g. hydrops fetalis; anencephaly (no swallowing
reflex); spina bifida; oesophageal or duodenal atresia; umbilical hernia;
ectopia vesicae
• Maternal, e.g. DM, multiple pregnancy
• No cause found (30–50%)

Intrauterine growth and malpresentation

Risks Premature labour; malpresentation; cord prolapse; placental
abruption; PPH.
Management Refer for USS to confirm diagnosis. Check maternal oral
glucose tolerance test and refer for specialist obstetric advice.

Multiple pregnancy Detected on early antenatal USS. Incidence:
twins—1 in 105 (1 in 3 identical); triplets—1 in 10,000. Predisposing factors:
• Previous twins
• Family history of non-identical twins
• Race: most common amongst African blacks; least common in Japanese
• i with maternal age
• Infertility treatment—induced ovulation (e.g. clomifene); IVF and other
assisted reproduction techniques
Management Refer for specialist obstetric care. Monochorionic twins are
significantly higher risk than dichorionic twins. Complications:
• In pregnancy Hyperemesis; anaemia; polyhydramnios; pre-eclampsia
(i x3); APH; placenta praevia; placental abruption
• In labour Malpresentation; cord prolapse; fetal distress (i Caesarean
section rate); PPH
• Fetus i perinatal mortality (x 5); prematurity; IUGR; malformations
(i x2–4); twin-twin transfusion may result in 1 twin being plethoric
(and jaundiced later) and the other anaemic
Breech babiesG 3–4% babies at term. Higher incidence <37wk.
Associated with i risk of cerebral palsy as breech presentation is more
common in premature infants and those with congenital malformation.
Risk factors: bicornuate uterus; fibroids; placenta praevia; oligohydramnios.
Management Many turn spontaneously—especially if <36wk gestation. If
a baby is found to be breech at ≥36wk gestation, confirm breech position and position of the placenta on USS and refer for specialist obstetric
advice. Specialist options: external cephalic version (ECV); vaginal breech
delivery; elective Caesarean section.
• 10–15% of breech babies are discovered for the first time late in
labour. If delivering at home or in a community unit, arrange transfer to
a specialist unit immediately.
Follow up Congenital hip problems are more common in breech babies—
refer all breech babies routinely for hip USS even if examination in the first
24h is normal.

Pregnancy

Labour
47% of deliveries are ‘normal’ i.e. occur without surgical intervention, use
of instruments, induction, epidural or general anaesthetic. Intrapartum
care can be provided by GPs in the UK as a National Enhanced Service.

Braxton Hicks contractions Irregular tightenings of the uterus. Start

≥30wk gestation (common after 36wk). May be uncomfortable but not
painful.
Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) Rupture of
membranes before labour starts. Usually presents with a gush of clear fluid
(9 an audible pop) followed by uncontrolled leakage. If chorioamnionitis is
present the woman may have abdominal pain and feel unwell. Difficult to
distinguish clinically from profuse vaginal discharge or incontinence of urine.
Check temperature, pulse, and BP and do a routine obstetric examination
(including fetal heart). 0 Do not perform a vaginal examination as
repeated examinations can introduce infection.
Management
• Evidence of infection—admit for specialist obstetric care
• <37wk gestation and suspected PROM—admit to specialist obstetric
unit for further assessment
• ≥37wk gestation—if no signs of spontaneous labour admit for
specialist obstetric assessment within 24h
Premature labour Any labour <37wk gestation. Prevalence: 6%—1 in
4 elective due to maternal/fetal problems. Largest contributor to neonatal
morbidity/mortality in industrialized countries.
Causes of spontaneous premature labour Unknown (40%)
• Pyelonephritis or other sexually
• Cervical incompetence
transmitted or urinary infection
• Multiple pregnancy
• Polyhydramnios
•	Uterine abnormality
• APH
• DM
Presentation Premature rupture of membranes or contractions. If suspected admit immediately to obstetrics for further assessment.
Prolonged pregnancy/post-maturity The due date is traditionally
based on pregnancy lasting 40 wk or 280d from the date of the LMP. Now
most women have an early dating USS to confirm their due date. However,
it is normal to deliver any time from 37–42wk. At 40wk gestation, 65% will
spontaneously go into labour in the next week but 15% of women have not
gone into labour by 42wk. Perinatal mortality rate is i x2 from 42–43wk and
x3 >43wk, so induction of labour is indicated if a pregnancy lasts >42wk.
Initial management Membrane sweep. If that is ineffective, refer for formal induction of labour (b p. 834). If referral is declined, i antenatal
monitoring to 2x weekly cardiotocography and USS (to measure maximum amniotic pool depth) as markers of fetal well-being.
Normal labour Occurs ≥37wk gestation and results in vaginal delivery
of a baby in <24h. Often heralded by a ‘show’ consisting of mucus 9 blood
and/or spontaneous rupture of membranes (‘waters going’).

Labour

• 1st stage of labour Time from the onset of regular contractions until
the cervix is fully dilated
• 2nd stage of labour Time from complete cervical dilatation until the
baby is born. The mother has a desire to push
• 3rd stage of labour Delivery of the placenta

Pain relief for labour Most women experience pain in labour.

Strategies for pain relief include:
• Self-help—keep fit in pregnancy, relaxation techniques, breathing
exercises, warm bath/birthing pool
• TENS—machines are available to hire from most obstetric units and
some retail outlets
• Entonox®—takes 30–45s to have effect—advise women to start
inhaling it as soon as the contraction starts
• Injected opioids (e.g. pethidine)
• Epidural
• Pudendal block—used for instrumental delivery
Advise women to discuss options with their midwife. Antenatal classes
dealing with pain relief significantly i a woman’s confidence in managing
her labour pains.

Epidural Effective method of analgesia available in most hospital units.
Initiated once in established labour (cervix >3cm dilated). Regular BP,
pulse, and fetal heart monitoring is required. Particular indications:
• Forceps delivery
• Occipito-posterior position
• Maternal medical conditions,
• Breech
e.g. cardiac
• Multiple pregnancy
• Pre-eclampsia
Epidural complications during labour
• Postural hypotension
•	Urinary retention
• i need for instrumental delivery due to pelvic floor muscle paralysis
Epidural complications post-delivery Urinary retention, headache (especially if dural puncture).

Meconium-stained liquor Passage of fresh meconium (dark green,
sticky, and lumpy) during labour may be a sign of fetal distress. Transfer
immediately to a consultant unit for further evaluation.
Management Paediatrician should be present at delivery. Do not perform
oropharyngeal suction if there is no evidence of fetal hypoxia.

Dystocia Difficulty in labour. May be due to problems relating to the
baby, birth passage, or action of the uterus. Neonatal mortality and
maternal morbidity both i with duration of labour. Possible causes:
•	Uterine dysfunction
• Pelvic abnormality
• Cervical dystocia
• Shoulder dystocia (b p. 1104)
• Cephalo-pelvic disproportion
• Abnormal presentation

833

834

chapter 23

Pregnancy

Management If a patient in labour at home or in a community unit fails to
progress as expected, admit immediately to a specialist unit for consideration of intervention to speed the labour or Caesarean section. Shoulder
dystocia is an obstetric emergency—b p. 1104.
Induction of labourN Performed when it is felt the baby is better off
out than in (~20% of deliveries). Only undertaken in units with facilities for
continuous fetal monitoring and emergency Caesarean section.
Procedure involves Assessment of the cervix; vaginal prostaglandins;
‘sweeping’ of the membranes; artificial rupture of the membranes and/or
IV oxytocin to maintain contractions.
Reasons for induction of labour include
• Post-maturity (most common)—offered from 41–42wk
• Premature rupture of membranes
• Intrauterine death
Assisted deliveryG (See Table 23.5). Forceps and ventouse are used in
~11% of deliveries in the UK (range 4–25% between hospitals). Assisted
delivery should only be performed with adequate analgesia (usually
epidural or pudendal block) and by experienced practitioners.
Caesarean section (LSCS)N (See Table 23.6). Rate in England and
Wales is 24.8% (range 10–65% between different hospitals). 10% are
elective and usually performed at >39wk to minimize risk of respiratory
complications; the other 11–12% occur after labour has started. Regional
anaesthesia for LSCS is safer for mother and child than a GA.
Reasons for emergency LSCS Failure to progress (25%); presumed fetal
compromise (28%); breech (14%).
Planned LSCS is indicated for
• Breech (where external cephalic version has failed)
• Multiple pregnancies where the first twin is not cephalic
• Placenta praevia or placenta accreta
• Some HIV positive women and those with primary HSV in the third
trimester to d virus transmission
0 Maternal request may be an indication for LSCS; GPs should discuss
risks and benefits if a request is made, and if the patient still requests a
LSCS, refer for a consultant opinion.

Pregnancy

Maternal postnatal care
Postnatal care, from hospital discharge until 14d after delivery, excluding
the neonatal check, is provided as an Additional Service (maternity services) and payment is included in the global sum. ‘Opting out’ results in a
2.1% d in global sum.
The puerperium is the 6wk period after delivery. Most women in the UK
spend ≥6h after delivery in hospital. After discharge home, the midwife
continues to visit for 2wk after the birth and then the health visitor takes
over. GPs usually see the mother and baby soon after discharge and again
for the 6wk postnatal check. Arrange additional reviews as needed.

The postnatal visit Discuss problems during pregnancy/delivery and
postnatal contraception (see Table 23.7). Check:
• Rhesus status If the mother is RhD –ve and the baby RhD +ve, ensure
anti-D is given <72h after delivery—b p. 820
• Hb on day 5 After delivery (after the postpartum diuresis). If Hb is
<10g/dL, continue iron supplements for 3mo
• Rubella status If non-immune, immunize as soon as possible, and
ensure effective contraception for 3mo afterwards. Reassure it is safe
to breastfeed after immunization
• Temperature, pulse, and BP iBP is associated with pre-eclampsia. It
usually resolves <48h after delivery
• Fundus Day 1 = 24wk gestation size (up to umbilicus); day 5 = 16wk
gestation size; by day 10, the uterus should not be palpable per
abdomen. Persistent bulkiness suggests retained products of
conception—refer for USS
• Pain Breast, abdominal, perineal, legs
• Vaginal loss Red, then brown, then yellowish over the first week, then
serous for 3–6wk. Any fresh, red bleeding is abnormal
• Moving about Women should try to get mobile as soon as possible
after delivery to d the risk of DVT
• Feeding b p. 870
• Mental state Screen for depression 4–6wk and 3–4mo postnatally
(b p. 839)
Mother’s 6wk postnatal check Discuss any problems in pregnancy
or delivery. Discuss any current problems the mother has and specifically
enquire about persistent vaginal loss, bladder/bowel control, and any
sex-related problems. Discuss any problems with the baby—including
worries about hearing/vision. Discuss feeding and contraception.
Examination/investigation
• BP and weight—if overweight discuss weight control—b p. 178
• Abdominal examination—uterus should not be palpable per abdomen
• Vaginal examination—only if any problems with tears/episiotomy,
persistent vaginal bleeding, pain, or to perform overdue cervical smear
• Screen for depression—b p. 839
• Check Hb if anaemic postnatally
• Check rubella immunization has been given if not immune antenatally—
if not arrange for vaccination. Check immunity 3mo after vaccination

If not breastfeeding*:

If breastfeeding**:

COC pill/
combined
patch

Start ≥3wk after delivery (patch states
>28d) as i risk of thromboembolism
(0 can be started immediately after
miscarriage/termination)
If starting on d21 (or d28 for patch)
postpartum, immediate protection is
provided. If starting after that time,
use an additional method for 7d
If PET in pregnancy—start CHC
only when BP and biochemical
abnormalities have returned to normal

Contraindicated <6wk
postpartum, as it may
inhibit lactation and
enters breast milk in
small quantities.
>6wk and <6mo—use
only if no other suitable
method

POP

Delay until ≥3wk postpartum to avoid i risk of heavy bleeding
If started >3wk after delivery, start on 1st day of period
for immediate protection or, if cycle is not established, use
alternative protection for 1st 2d. For breastfeeding mothers, i
quantity of breast milk

Injectables/
implants

Preferably delay until ≥6wk postpartum to avoid risk of heavy/
irregular bleeding. If >3wk (>4wk for implant) postpartum
administer early in period or, if cycle is not re-established, check
pregnancy test before administration and use additional method
for 7d. If breastfeeding, delay giving injectable until ≥6wk
postpartum where possible

IUCD/IUS

Insert <48h post-delivery (but i risk of expulsion) or delay until
>4wk postpartum (Mirena® licence states 6wk)—take care with
insertion, as the uterus may be soft and perforate easily. Use an
additional method for 7d if inserted >4wk postpartum

Cap

Refit any time from 5–6wk postpartum (even after LSCS)
0 May require a different size postpartum

Condoms

Useful until other methods are established and to prevent
transfer of sexually transmitted diseases

Sterilization

i operative and failure rate when performed at abortion or in
the postpartum period
Best delayed for a few months

* Ovulation can occur within 10d of abortion and 28d of delivery.
** Advise women <6mo postpartum who are amenorrhoeic and fully breastfeeding, there is
only a low chance of pregnancy (~2/1,000 women) without contraception. If any supplementary
bottle feeding, baby is weaned or any vaginal bleeding (except occasional spotting) then assume
the woman is fertile.

Pregnancy

Common postnatal problems
Abdominal pain Cramping, ‘period like’ for the first 1–2wk after delivery, especially when breastfeeding. These are due to the uterus contracting down or involuting. Suspect infection if offensive lochia, fever, the
uterus stops getting smaller day by day or is still palpable per abdomen
10d after delivery.
Breast soreness The breasts become engorged (‘the milk comes in’)
3–5d after the birth and may be quite painful. Support with a well-fitting
maternity bra day and night. Express milk if still painful—a warm bath may
help. Other problems:
Sore/cracked nipples Try topical remedies, e.g. Kamillosan®, and/or nipple
shields. Consider advice from a breastfeeding advisor—may be a ‘positioning problem’.
Skin infection Localized soreness, pain around the areola 9 nipple, or in
the breast after a feed—usually due to candida infection. Treat mother
and baby with miconazole oral gel.
0 Severe knife-like pain in breast during and for up to 1h after feeding suggests deeper infection—treat mother additionally with fluconazole
150mg stat and then 50mg bd for 10d (unlicensed use). Symptoms usually
resolve in <3d.
Blocked duct Hard, tender lump in the breast. Advise the mother to massage that area of the breast while feeding or expressing milk.
Mastitis Tender, hot, reddened area of breast 9 fever. Treat with flucloxacillin 500mg qds and NSAID, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds prn. Continue
breastfeeding or express the milk to prevent milk stagnation if too painful
for feeding.
Breast abscess Admit for incision and drainage.

Dyspareunia following perineal trauma. Almost always settles without

need for surgery.
Hair loss Hair becomes thicker in pregnancy and these hairs are all shed
at about the same time 75–6mo postpartum. Reassure. Hair loss reverts
to normal levels within 2–3mo. If severe, persistent, or accompanied by
tiredness, consider hypothyroidism (b p. 840)—check TFTs.
Haemorrhoids Common and painful. Try:
• Local ice packs (frozen fingers of rubber gloves are the right shape)
•	Topical preparations, e.g. Proctosedyl®
• Resting lying on one side
• Keeping stools soft using a stool softener
• Advising women to wash the haemorrhoids with cool water after
opening bowels and gently push them through the anus (if possible)
Perineal bruising Can be very painful. Advise regular analgesia, e.g.
paracetamol 1g qds 9 ibuprofen 400mg tds, ice packs. Ultrasound can
help—consider referral to physiotherapy.

Common postnatal problems

Persistent lochia Bleeding (lochia) >6wk postpartum. Causes:
• Side effects of contraception
• Infection
(e.g. POP, depot injection)
• Retained products of conception
•	Unhealed tears—cervical, vaginal • Other cervical or uterine
pathology
or perineal
• Resumption of normal cycle
Management
•	Examine uterus per abdomen and do a bimanual vaginal examination
to check involution. Perform a speculum examination and send a
vaginal swab for M,C&S
• If offensive loss or systemic symptoms/signs of infection, treat with
antibiotics as for endometritis (b p. 840). Otherwise, arrange USS
• If not settling and no cause is found, refer to gynaecology
Baby blues Very common—women become tearful and low within the
1st 10d of delivery. Be supportive. Usually resolves.
Postnatal depression Common (10–15% mothers) reaching a peak
~12wk after delivery—although symptoms are almost always present
at 6wk. Often mothers do not report symptoms. NICE recommends
screening all mothers for depression 4–6wk and 3–4mo postnatally by
asking:
• During the past month, have you often been bothered by feeling
down, depressed, or hopeless?
• During the past month, have you often been bothered by having little
interest or pleasure in doing things?
If the woman answers ‘yes’ to either of the initial questions, ask: ‘Is this
something you feel you need or want help with?’
Risk factors
• Depression during pregnancy
• A bad birth experience
• Social problems (e.g. poor social
support, financial problems)

• Past medical history or family
history of depression or
postnatal depression
• Alcohol or drug abuse

Management
•	Talk through the problems. Refer to health visitor for support
•	Give information, e.g. self-help groups, mother-and-baby groups
• Consider checking TFTs—especially if presenting with tiredness
• Consider referral for psychological therapies such as CBT
• Consider antidepressant medication. Of the SSRIs, sertraline 50mg
od is the safest. In all cases, monitor the baby for unwanted side
effects (e.g. drowsiness, respiratory depression). If not breastfeeding,
fluoxetine 20mg od is the most effective antidepressant in trials
• Monitor progress using depression questionnaires, e.g. Edinburgh
postnatal depression scale
• Refer to the mental health team immediately if any risk of self-harm,
suicide, or harm to the baby.
X There is evidence that oestrogen (but not progesterone) may help
some women with postnatal depressionC.

Pregnancy

Puerperal psychosis Much rarer than postnatal depression (1 in 500
births). Suspect if severe depression; high suicidal drive; mania; psychotic
symptoms. In all cases seek expert help from a psychiatrist. Consider
admission—under a Section if necessary. Risk of recurrence is 20%—but
50% will never be mentally ill again.
Poor abdominal and pelvic muscle tone Classes for postnatal
exercise to re-tone the body are available both on dry land and in the
swimming pool at most leisure centres. Pelvic floor exercises can be
started <1d after delivery (see Box 23.3). Good leaflets explaining these
are available from physiotherapists, local maternity units, and the NCT.
Puerperal pyrexia Temperature >38*C within 14d of delivery or
miscarriage. 90% infections are in the urinary or genital tracts. Ask about:
• Breast symptoms
•	Urinary symptoms
• Any other symptoms (e.g. cough,
• Colour and smell of lochia
sore throat)
• Abdominal pain
Examine fully including bimanual VE and send MSU and vaginal swabs for
M,C&S. Potential obstetric causes:
Superficial perineal infection Complicates tear or episiotomy—treat with
flucloxacillin 500mg—1g qds.
Endometritis Presents with offensive lochia, lower abdominal pain, and a
tender uterus. Treat with amoxicillin 500mg tds and metronidazole 400mg
tds or co-amoxiclav 375mg tds. If not settling in <48h or very unwell,
admit for IV antibiotics.
Mastitis See breast soreness—b p. 838
DVT or PE Can present with pyrexia. Refer to exclude if any leg pain/
chest pain/breathlessness.
Superficial thrombophlebitis Affects 1% women. Presents with
a tender (usually varicose) vein. Exclude DVT. Recovery usually occurs
within a few days. Meanwhile advise the woman not to stand still and,
when sitting, to elevate the leg above waist height. Support the leg, e.g.
with an elasticated stocking, and try applying an ice pack to the affected
area. NSAIDs, e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds prn, may help.
Tiredness Very common in the first few months after delivery but
it may be the presenting feature of postnatal depression, anaemia, or
hypothyroidism. Check FBC and TFTs.
Transient autoimmune thyroiditis Up to 10% women 1–3mo after
delivery. Usually presents with fatigue and lethargy.
Hypothyroidism Treat with levothyroxine for 6mo then stop for 6wk and
repeat TFTs. Follow-up with annual TFTs—1 in 5 go on to develop permanent hypothyroidism.
Hyperthyroidism Refer to an endocrinologist—antithyroid treatment is
not normally required but symptom control may be necessary.

Common postnatal problems

Box 23.3 Pelvic floor exercises—basic techniques
• Exercise 1 Advise the woman to pull up her pelvic muscles as if
stopping herself from passing urine and hold that position for a
count of 10
• Exercise 2 Advise the woman to pull up her pelvic muscles as in
­exercise 1, but then relax and contract them rapidly 4 times
These exercises should be repeated as many times daily as possible
long-term

Pregnancy

Stillbirth and neonatal death
Stillbirth is a term applied to those babies born dead after 24wk gestation.
Affects 1 in 200 pregnancies. Death may occur in utero or during labour.
Usually presents with a lack of fetal movements and on examination no
fetal heart can be detected. If suspected refer as an emergency to the
nearest obstetric unit for confirmation of intrauterine death by USS.
Management In hospital mothers of babies who have died in utero are
usually induced. Samples are routinely taken from mother and baby to try
to determine cause of death.
Common causes Pre-eclampsia; IUGR; renal disease; DM; infection;
malformation; post-maturity; abruption; knots in the cord. No cause is
found for 1 in 5 stillbirths.
After discharge Make contact with the parents as soon as possible.
Lactation suppression Offer cabergoline 1mg as a single dose.
Registration of stillbirth A certificate of stillbirth is issued by the obstetrician which must be taken to the Registrar of deaths within 42d of the
stillbirth. Parents are issued with a certificate of burial or cremation and a
certificate of registration to keep. The child’s name may be entered on the
certificate of registration.
Funeral Parents have the option of a free hospital funeral. Burial is usually
in an unmarked multiple occupancy grave. Parents may pay for a single
occupancy grave or cremation. Alternatively parents may pay for a private
funeral.
Benefits In the UK all maternity benefits are still payable after stillbirth—
b p. 785
Follow-up Is routinely arranged by the specialist obstetrician to discuss
reasons for the stillbirth and implications for future pregnancies. Primary
care follow-up is essential. Stillbirth is a huge burden to come to terms
with. Parents do not have the regular contact with medical staff a baby
brings. Ensure regular follow-up by a member of the primary care team.
Broach the issues brought up by the baby’s death directly. Offer an open
door. Give information about support organizations, e.g. SANDS. Advise
waiting 6mo–1y before embarking on another pregnancy.
Neonatal death Death of an infant <28d old. Rare in the community. In
the UK, all deaths of children <18y are subject to review by the local child
death review panel (b p. 927) and should be notified to it immediately.
If the death is expected, the GP will be allowed to issue a special death
certificate. If unexpected the case will be referred to the police/Coroner.
Offer lactation suppression with cabergoline 250 micrograms bd for 2d,
and follow-up as for stillbirth.

Child health

Child health promotion
‘Children are one third of our population and all our future.’
US Select Panel for Promotion of Child Health (1981)
Patients �15y comprise 19% of the average practice list; under 5s see
their GP more often (average 6–7x/y) and have more home visits than any
other age group, except the elderly.

National Service Framework (NSF) for children Emphasizes
child health promotion. It moves from rigid developmental screening to a
more flexible assessment of the child within the family context. It includes:
• Immunization—b p. 644
• Childhood screening
•	Health and development reviews—to monitor the child’s
development, the strengths/weaknesses of the family, and to discuss
the parents’ hopes and concerns, followed by early intervention as
required
•	Health promotion beginning antenatally and continuing to teenage
years covering the full range of child health issues, e.g. diet, safety,
substance abuse (drugs, smoking, and alcohol), teenage sexual health
Although most child health promotion is still carried out by the health
visitor and other members of the primary healthcare team, the need for
partnership with parents and involvement of other care providers (eg.
schools and nurseries, social care services) is stressed.
Childhood screening The aim of screening is to discover physi-

cal, developmental, or behavioural problems as early as possible so that
appropriate management can commence preventing secondary complications. There has been a move away from set times for developmental
screening but the neonatal (b p. 848) and 6–8wk check (with emphasis on
checking the eyes, heart, and hips as well as developmental milestones—
b p. 852) are still carried out, as is a comprehensive assessment (usually
by the health visitor) by 1y and again between 2–2½y.
Beyond that assessments are performed according to need. Any consul­tation
can opportunistically be used to check immunization status, monitor development, and for health promotion. Expected developmental milestones are
summarized in Table 24.2 (b p. 852). Liaise with the health visitor if:
• Immunizations are not up to date
• You have any worries regarding parenting abilities
• A child does not attend a primary or secondary care appointment
• You have concerns about neglect or abuse (but also see b p. 924)
Neonatal bloodspot screening b p. 850

Health education for new parents
Reducing the risk of cot death
• Cut smoking in pregnancy
• Do not let anyone smoke in the same room as your baby
• Place your baby on his/her back to sleep
• Do not let your baby get too hot
• Do not suddenly stop using a dummy before your baby is 6mo old if
your baby is used to having one
• Keep your baby’s head uncovered—place your baby with his/her feet
to the foot of the cot to prevent wriggling down under the covers
• It is safest for your baby to sleep in a cot in your bedroom for the
first 6mo
• It is dangerous to share a bed with your baby if either parent:
• Is a smoker—no matter where or when he/she smokes
• Has been drinking alcohol
• Takes medication or drugs that might make him/her drowsy
• Feels very tired
• It is dangerous to sleep with your baby on a sofa, armchair, or settee
• If your baby is unwell, seek medical advice promptly
Protecting your baby from accidents and infections
• Keep small objects out of your baby’s reach
• Stay with your baby when he/she is eating or drinking
• Make sure your baby’s cot and mattress are in good condition and
that the mattress fits the cot properly
• Install at least one smoke alarm
• Plan a way to escape a fire with your baby
• Never leave your baby alone in a bath or near water
• Immunize your baby
• Make sure your baby cannot reach hot drinks or the kettle or iron flex
• Only use toys suitable for your baby’s age
• Never shake your baby—ask for help if crying gets too much
• Use a properly fitted baby car seat that is the right size for your baby
• Do not use a baby walker
• Wash your hands before feeding your baby and make sure your
baby’s bottle and teats are properly sterilized

Benefits for parents and children
• Child benefits Available to anyone responsible for the upbringing of a
child aged <16y (those who claim and are on higher income incur an
income tax charge). Claim forms are in packs given to new mothers.
F 0300 200 3100 M www.hmrc.gov.uk
• Low income benefits b p. 104
• All children <16y (18y if in full time education) and mothers <1y

Child health

The neonatal check
It is essential that a full neonatal check is carried out <72h after delivery. Most
neonatal checks are carried out by paediatricians in maternity units before
discharge. Neonatal checks can then be provided by GMS GPs as a National
Enhanced Service or by PMS GPs as part of their negotiated services if:
• The baby is discharged <24h after delivery
• The birth occurs at home or in a GP unit, or
• There is rapid discharge from obstetric unit to a peripheral unit

Parental concerns
• Discuss any worries the parent(s) might have about the child
•	Review FH, pregnancy, and birth
• Arrange hepatitis B vaccination if mother is hepatitis B +ve (b p. 811)
or BCG vaccination if in a high-risk group (b p. 327)

History
• Has the baby passed urine? For boys, is the stream good? If no
urine in the 1st 24h suspect renal abnormality and admit for further
investigation. If poor stream suspect posterior urethral valves,
phimosis, or hypospadias
• Has the baby passed meconium? If no meconium in the first 24h,
suspect meconium ileus and admit for further investigation
Physical examination Check the baby systematically—see Table 24.1.
Moro reflex Elicit if concerned. Support head and shoulders about 15cm
from the examination couch. Suddenly allow the baby’s head to drop back
slightly. The response—extension of the arms followed by adduction towards
the chest should be brisk and symmetrical. This reflex disappears by 6mo.

Discuss neonatal bloodspot screening b p. 850
Check vitamin K has been given
• Discuss any concerns with the parent(s)
• Deficiency of vitamin K can l haemorrhagic disease of the newborn with
potentially serious effects, including death
• All parents should be offered IM vitamin K for their baby; if IM vitamin
K is declined, they should be offered oral vitamin K. 0 One dose of
oral vitamin K does not confer full protection. Formula feeds contain
vitamin K supplements but breastfed babies require further doses—
ensure that they get them
• Babies at high risk of bleeding (premature, low birthweight, unwell
babies, and those who have undergone instrumental deliveries)—
should always have IM vitamin K

Health education b p. 847. Discuss:
• Sibling management
• Feeding and nutrition
• Crying and sleep problems
• Sleeping position
• Transport in a car
• Baby care

Child health

Neonatal bloodspot screening
Neonatal bloodspot screening involves taking a blood sample obtained by
pricking a baby’s heel. The blood is placed on special filter paper and sent
for analysis. The test is usually carried out by the midwife when the baby
is 5–8d old and the result is available by 6wk.
• If screening is declined, it is important to flag in the child’s notes that
the child has not been screened in case the child becomes ill later on.

What conditions does bloodspot testing detect? Throughout
the UK babies are screened for:
• Phenylketonuria (PKU)
• Cystic fibrosis (CF)
• Congenital hypothyroidism
• Sickle cell disease
• Medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)

A pilot of screening for 5 further rare inherited metabolic disorders (maple
syrup urine disease, homocystinuria, glutaric acidaemia type 1, isovaleric
acidaemia, and long chain fatty acidaemia) is under evaluation.

Phenylketonuria (PKU)
• In the UK 1 in 10,000 babies has PKU (autosomal recessive trait—
higher incidence in Ireland). If there is a FH, check at 48–72h of age
• Children are unable to break down phenylalanine, an amino acid
present in many foods. The baby appears normal at birth but develops
severe developmental delay, learning difficulty, and seizures in infancy
• The bloodspot test detects high levels of blood phenylalanine
• Treatment is with life-long dietary restriction of phenylalanine. With
treatment, growth and development are normal

Congenital hypothyroidism
• In the UK, 1 in 4,000 babies is born with congenital hypothyroidism
(5 > 4)
• Untreated, children with abnormally low levels of thyroid hormone fail
to grow properly and have mild to severe mental disability
• The bloodspot is used to detect low levels of blood thyroxine
• Treatment with thyroxine replacement results in normal growth and
development. Usually thyroxine replacement is needed lifelong

Cystic fibrosis (CF)
• In the UK, 1 in 2,500 babies is born with CF (b p. 330). Early treatment
improves outcome and prolongs both quality and quantity of life
• Screening detects immunoreactive trypsin (IRT) which is i in children
with CF. If IRT is i, the blood is then DNA-tested for the most
common gene alterations
• If a child tests +ve, it is important that parents and siblings receive
genetic counselling and are offered genetic testing for the condition. If
both parents are carriers of a CF gene, there is a 1 in 4 chance of any
subsequent children they have together being affected
• Screening will also detect healthy carriers. This has implications not
only for the child but also parents and other siblings. Ensure parents
have a full explanation of results and understand their meaning

Neonatal bloodspot screening

0 Not all gene mutations are tested for. Some babies with CF will be
missed by newborn screening. Continue to watch for later presentations.

Sickle cell disease

• In the UK, 1 in 2,000 babies is born with a sickle cell disorder
(b p. 669). Infants with sickle cell disease are at risk of severe
overwhelming infections and splenic sequestration crises. Early
diagnosis allows prophylaxis with penicillin and vaccines, and parent
training to identify children with complications and present early for
treatment. This d complications and deaths in young infants
• Abnormal haemoglobin is screened for using either high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) or isoelectric focussing (IEF). If
detected, a confirmatory test is performed on the original spot using a
different technique from the initial screening test
• If a child tests positive, it is important that parents and siblings receive
genetic counselling and are offered genetic testing for the condition
• As well as babies with sickle cell disease, this test detects babies with
sickle cell trait, other heterozygous states, and other haemoglobin
abnormalities (e.g. haemoglobin E, thalassaemia). Even if these have no
clinical consequences for the child the current policy is to inform parents
of the results. It is important that parents understand the meaning and
significance of results both for the child and other family members

Medium chain acyl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD)
• In the UK, 1 in 10,000 babies is born with MCADD (autosomal
recessive trait). Infants are unable to metabolize fats effectively. If they
are stressed by fasting or infection, toxic levels of fatty acids build up,
causing metabolic crises, brain damage, coma, and death
• The bloodspot test detects high levels of C8 carnitine (a fatty acid of
medium length). Rarely other metabolic disorders are also detected
• If a child tests +ve, parents should be offered testing for any unscreened
siblings. Any subsequent babies need early screening (at 24–48h) and
specialist management including regular feeding until the result is known
• Parents and siblings should be offered genetic counselling
• Treatment prevents long-term consequences, is required life-long, and
involves ensuring the child does not go without food for >4–6h (longer
after adolescence); has a low-fat, high-carbohydrate diet, takes L-carnitine
supplements, and parents seek medical attention early if the child is unwell

Child health

Screening for hip dysplasia
Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) was previously known as congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH). It ranges from dysplasia with dislocation or subluxation, through instability, to mild acetabular dysplasia with
a stable hip joint. Incidence is estimated at 1–3% of newborns when all
grades of severity are included, although fewer have dislocation (3 in 2,000
live births); 5:485:1. Associated with breech presentation. Often there is
a family history. 20% of cases are bilateral.

Presentation
•	High-risk babies (breech presentation at 36wk even if turns prior to
delivery and/or family history) are routinely screened with USS in the
first 6–8 weeks of life
• Otherwise, usually detected by clinical examination as part of routine
screening. Screening should take place <72h after birth and at the
6wk check. Screening tests should be taught in vivo by someone
experienced in the technique
• Despite screening some cases slip though the net. They present as
toddlers with limp/waddling gait; frequent falls; asymmetric thigh
creases or limited hip abduction. Be alert for physical signs and take
parental concerns seriously
• Some (particularly mild cases) go unnoticed until adulthood when
they present with pain (from damage to the acetabular labrum) or
premature osteoarthritis

Screening a child <3mo of age
• Screening tests should be performed in a warm room with the baby
undressed and lying on a firm surface
• Flex hips and knees to 90° using one hand for each leg with thumbs on
the inner side of the baby’s knee and ring and little fingers behind the
greater trochanters (see Figure 24.1)
•	Each hip is tested separately. The examiner’s hand on the opposite
side from the hip being tested is used to stabilize the pelvis. Hold the
thumb over the symphysis pubis and fingers under the sacrum
• Only test once as repeated testing can damage the hips
Ortolani manoeuvre Each hip is gently abducted whilst lifting the greater
trochanter forward. As a dislocated hip is abducted a clunk or jumping
sensation is felt. It is difficult to tell the difference between a click of a
normal hip and a clunk of an abnormal one—so refer any clicky or clunky
hips for further investigation (usually USS or orthopaedic review). Hip
abduction of <60° in 90° of flexion is also a sensitive sign.
Barlow manoeuvre This establishes whether the hips are dislocatable.
Holding the legs as described above, gently apply pressure along the line
of the femur pushing it backwards out of the acetabulum. The judder of
the femoral head slipping in and out of the acetabulum can be felt if the
hip is dislocatable.

Screening for hip dysplasia

Figure 24.1 Screening for congenital dislocation of the hip (Ortolani test)

Examination of a child of >3mo of age
• >3mo of age, limited abduction is the most common finding in children
with CDH. If the infant lies on his/her back with hips flexed at 90°, any
hip which cannot abduct >75° should be viewed with suspicion
• Ortolani and Barlow tests are difficult to perform in older babies;
X-ray is more useful than USS once a baby is >4.5mo old
Other signs
• Limb shortening on the affected side—compare knee levels with the
child lying on his/her back and hips and knees flexed to 90°
• Asymmetry of the thighs—skin creases may asymmetric (but
asymmetric in 25% of normal babies)
• Flattening of the buttock—in a prone position, the affected side may
look flatter

Management Refer to an orthopaedic surgeon specializing in paediatric
problems. Treatment depends on when the condition is diagnosed:
• Young babies Splinting in a pelvic harness to reduce and hold the
hip—the hips are held in partial abduction using slings under each thigh
attached to a body harness, e.g. von Rosen splint. Usually babies wear
a splint for 73mo
• Older babies, toddlers, and adults Surgery is required

Child health

Vision and hearing screening tests
Operational senses are essential for normal development. Conditions
which interfere with the senses, even if correctable, may lead to permanent impairment if not detected and treated early.
Vision screening Is carried out at the neonatal and 6wk check:
• Ask about parental worries about the child’s vision
• Is there a FH of visual disorders (particularly retinoblastoma or
congenital cataracts)?
• Inspect the external eye—are there any abnormalities?
• Check the red reflex in each eye (urgent referral if absent)
• Observe if the child has a fixing and following response to a bright light
A further check may be carried out by an orthoptist-led service at 74y.
Refer children for further assessment at any age where there is concern
about vision on assessment or any parental concern.

• Warning signs for visual problems

• The child does not fix on the mother’s face whilst feeding by 6wk
• In a child >6wk old, the child’s eye wanders about from one side of
the eye socket to the other while the child is awake and happy
• A white spot is seen in the pupil at any age—could be cataract
• A child holds objects close to the face whilst trying to look at them
• A child >6mo old has a squint in one or both eyes

Tests for squint

• Sit the child on the parent’s lap; stand in front of the child and shine a
bright light (e.g. pen torch) at arm’s length from the child
• Fix the child’s head in the midline and look for the reflection of the
light on the child’s corneas; the reflection should be symmetrical and
near the centre of the pupil (usually slightly towards the nose)
• Turn the child’s head to one side keeping the eyes fixed on the light—
the reflection should stay symmetrical; repeat, turning to the other side
• If reflections are not symmetrical perform a cover test
Cover test
• Sit the child comfortably on a parent’s lap and shine a bright light or a
place a small bright object at arm’s length from the child
• Cover one eye with a card—watch for any movement of the uncovered
eye to fix on the object. Then remove the card and watch the covered
eye to see if it moves to fix on the object. Repeat with the other eye
• If either or both eyes move a squint is present—refer
Hearing tests All newborn babies in the UK are offered hearing tests
through the neonatal hearing screening programme (NHSP):
• Automated oto-acoustic emission (AOAE) testing Measures
integrity of the inner ear and is offered to all neonates. An earpiece
is placed in the ear and quiet clicking sounds are played. In a hearing
ear, the cochlea produces sounds in response to the clicks that can
be analysed. Screening takes a few minutes and can be done at the
bedside when the baby is asleep but responses are sometimes unclear
especially if the baby is <24h old

Vision and hearing screening tests

• Automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) testing Assesses
the entire auditory pathway and is offered to any baby not passing
the AOAE test or to any baby that has a stay of >48h in a special care
baby unit (in addition to AOAE testing). Sensors are placed on the
head/neck and quiet clicking sounds are played through head-phones.
Responses to sounds around the brain stem are analysed

• Warning signs for hearing problems
•
•
•
•
•

No startle response to loud noises at 6wk
The child does not respond to his/her name by 8mo
Absence of babbling or cooing by 1y
Inability to understand simple commands by 18mo
Inability to speak in short sentences by 2½y

When are further hearing tests necessary? Ensure referral to
audiology for further assessment:
• If the newborn hearing test indicates a problem
• At any age If there is parental/professional concern; after temporal
bone fracture; after bacterial meningitis/septicaemia (test hearing
4wk after discharge from hospital); after treatment with high doses of
ototoxic drugs, e.g. aminoglycosides
• At 8mo of age If the child has FH of childhood sensorineural deafness;
missed newborn hearing screen or follow-up; congenital infection
(e.g. cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella); neurodegenerative/
neurodevelopmental disorder; syndrome associated with hearing loss
(e.g. Down’s, Turner’s); craniofacial abnormality (e.g. cleft palate); or
history of severe neonatal jaundice at exchange transfusion level
Delayed speech development May be due to global or specific
learning disability, deafness, or neurological problems. Parents often
compare their children’s development to others leading to unnecessary
anxiety. The range of normal for speech development is wide:
• First words 11–20mo
• A 2y old may use anything from a few words to 2,000 words
• Children start using prepositions at any time from 3–4½y
Management If a child’s speech is delayed, check other developmental
milestones; examine for any neurological deficit and check hearing.
Consider autism (b p. 918) particularly if regression of speech. If delayed
speech is the main issue, refer to speech therapy.

Birth trauma
Head trauma
Caput succedaneum Swelling, bruising, and oedema of the presenting
portion—usually scalp. Unsightly but resolves spontaneously.
Cephalhaematoma Uncommon. Haemorrhage beneath the periosteum.
Unilateral and usually parietal. Presents as a lump—the size of an
egg—on the baby’s head. Treatment is not required, but anaemia or
hyperbilirubinaemia may follow.
Depressed skull fracture Rare. Most result from forceps pressure;
rarely caused by the head resting on a bony prominence in utero. May
be associated with subdural bleeding, subarachnoid haemorrhage, or
contusion/laceration of the brain itself. Seen and felt as a depression in the
skull. X-ray confirms diagnosis; may need neurosurgical elevation.
Intracranial haemorrhage Rare. Suggested by lack of responsiveness, fits,
respiratory distress ± shock. Admit as an emergency.

Nerve injuries
Cranial nerve trauma The facial nerve is injured most often, causing facial
asymmetry especially during crying. Usually resolves spontaneously by
2–3mo of age.
Brachial plexus injury Follows stretching caused by shoulder dystocia,
breech extraction, or hyperabduction of the neck in cephalic presentations.
Often associated with other traumatic injuries, e.g. fractured clavicle or
humerus, subluxations of the shoulder or cervical spine.
• Partial injuries of the brachial plexus Most recover but site and type
of nerve root injury determine prognosis. If persists, refer to paediatric
neurology for further investigation
• Injuries of the upper brachial plexus (C5–6) affect muscles around
the shoulder and elbow—Erb’s palsy. W.H. Erb (1840–1921)—
German neurologist
• Injuries of the lower plexus (C7–8 and T1) affect primarily muscles
of the forearm and hand—Klumpke’s palsy. A.M. Dejerine-Klumpke
(1859–1927)—French neurologist
• Injuries of the entire brachial plexus No movement of the arm +
sensory loss. Refer immediately for neurological opinion. Prognosis for
recovery is poor

Fractures
Mid-clavicular fracture Most common fracture during birth. Usually
occurs due to shoulder dystocia. Most clavicular fractures are greenstick
fractures and heal rapidly and uneventfully. A large callus forms at the
fracture site in <1wk and remodelling is completed in <1mo. Can be
associated with brachial plexus injury and/or pneumothorax.
Long bone fractures The humerus and femur may be fractured during
difficult deliveries. Usually long bones heal rapidly without any residual
deformity.

Birth trauma

Cerebral palsy The term cerebral palsy identifies children with
non-progressive spasticity, ataxia, or involuntary movements. It affects
0.2% of children (71% of premature babies/babies small for dates).
Causes
• Prematurity
• In utero disorders
• Neonatal jaundice

• Severe systemic disease
• Birth trauma
• Perinatal asphyxia during early childhood
(e.g. meningitis, sepsis)
• CNS trauma

Associated disorders
• Fits (25%)
• Short attention
• Deafness
• Squint and other • Learning disability—though
span
visual problems
intelligence is often normal •	Hyperactivity
Spastic syndromes 70%. Upper motor neurone involvement.
• Affects motor function and may l hemiplegia, paraplegia, quadriplegia,
or diplegia
• Affected limbs are underdeveloped and have i tone, weakness, and a
tendency toward contractures
• A scissor’s gait and toe walking are characteristic
• In mildly affected children, impairment may occur only during certain
activities (e.g. running)
• With quadriplegia dysarthria is common
Athetoid/dyskinetic syndromes 20%. Basal ganglia involvement.
• Characterized by slow, writhing, involuntary movements affecting the
extremities (athetoid) or proximal parts of the limbs/trunk (dystonic)
• Abrupt, jerky, distal movements (choreiform) may also occur
• Movements i with emotional tension and stop during sleep
• Dysarthria is often severe
Ataxic syndromes 10%. Involvement of the cerebellum. Weakness,
incoordination, and intention tremor produce unsteadiness, wide-based
gait, and difficulty with rapid and fine movements.
0 Mixed types are common.
Diagnosis Diagnosis is rarely made in infancy with certainty though often
abnormalities in tone, reflexes, and posture are noted during routine
developmental screening. Refer for paediatric assessment if suspected.
Formal diagnosis is usually made by 2y.
Management The goal is for children to develop maximal independence
within the limits of their handicap. A multidisciplinary, coordinated team
approach, involving physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech
therapists, social workers, teachers, community paediatricians, and the
primary healthcare team in liaison with the child and his/her parents is
essential. As with all chronically disabled children, the child and parents need
assistance in understanding the disability, setting realistic goals, and relieving
their own feelings (b p. 859).

Genetic problems
• Some genetic syndromes are associated with cancer (e.g. Down’s syndrome and leukaemia; neurofibromatosis and CNS tumours). Be alert
to the potential significance of unexplained symptoms in this groupN.
There are 46 chromosomes—22 matching pairs with matching genes
(autosomes) and one pair of sex chromosomes which may match (XX—
5) or differ (XY—4). Genetic abnormalities are the most common cause
of developmental delay. There are a huge number of genetic syndromes—
many of them extremely rare. Categorize by the nature of the defect.

Chromosome number
• Alteration in number of chromosomes Example: Down’s syndrome
(extra chromosome 21)
• Sex chromosome abnormalities A sex chromosome is duplicated or
deleted. Examples: Turner’s syndrome (XO); Klinefelter’s syndrome
(XXY or XXYY)

Gross structural changes in chromosomes
• Translocation Part of one chromosome is transposed or translocated
onto another. If no genetic information is lost there is no clinical effect
(balanced translocation) although offspring often have problems. 6% of
children with Down’s syndrome have a translocation
• Deletion Loss of a portion of chromosome. Example: cri-du-chat
syndrome (deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5)

Single gene abnormalities
Autosomal dominant inheritance >1,000 diseases all individually rare.
Heterozygotes demonstrate the disease and 1 in 2 pregnancies of an affected
individual are affected—usually 4 = 5. Expression of the gene may vary.
Examples: tuberous sclerosis (b p. 862); Marfan’s syndrome (b p. 283);
myotonic dystrophy (b p. 578); neurofibromatosis (b p. 580).
Autosomal recessive inheritance >700 diseases that only manifest in
the homozygote. Heterozygotes may be asymptomatic or show milder
abnormalities. To develop severe disease, the affected gene must be
inherited from both parents. The risk of an affected pregnancy is 1 in
4—usually 4 = 5. Affected individuals have unaffected children unless
their partner is a heterozygote. Examples: glycogen storage diseases
(b p. 862); PKU (b p. 850); sickle cell disease (b p. 669); thalassaemia
(b p. 668); cystic fibrosis (b p. 330); MCADD (b p. 851).
Sex-linked disorders 7100 are recognized. Most are recessively inherited
from the mother and affect only 4 offspring. A 4 child of a heterozygote
mother has a 1 in 2 chance of developing the disease; a 5 child has a 1 in
2 chance of carrying the disease. A 5 child can only be fully affected by the
disease if the father has the disease and the mother is a carrier when she has a
1 in 2 chance of being affected and, if not affected, will be a carrier. Examples:
fragile X syndrome (b p. 863); haemophilia (b p. 670), red-green colour
blindness (b p. 970), Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy (b p. 578).

Child health

Polygenic inheritance Familial trends of disease are often seen but

there is no simple inheritance pattern. Usually due to polygenic inheritance, i.e. the combination of genes inherited. Examples: neural tube
defects, cleft palate; ischaemic and congential heart disease; DDH, club
foot; type 1 DM; pyloric stenosis; schizophrenia.

Management of genetic disorders Depends on the specific

problems of each child. A multidisciplinary approach is essential. Support
the child and family. Ensure receipt of all available benefits. Tell carers
about local facilities, voluntary and self-help organizations. Review
regularly.

Tuberous sclerosis Incidence: 6/100,000. Autosomal dominant
condition caused by mutations of TSC1 or TSC2 genes on chromosome
9—but two-thirds arise from new mutations. Characterized by
hamartomatous lesions in the skin, nervous system, and internal organs.
Usual presentation is with:
• Adenoma sebaceum (angiofibromas of the skin—seen as red-brown
papules on the face—appear aged 5–10y)
•	Epilepsy and developmental delay
Other features include coarsened skin over the sacrum (shagreen patch);
nail fold fibromas; hypopigmented oval patches (ash leaf spots); cardiac,
renal, lung, and eye abnormalities. Treatment is supportive.

Tay–Sachs disease Autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder
caused by a mutation of the HEXA gene on chromosome 15. Incidence: 1
in 25 in Ashkenazi Jewish populations. 3 forms:
• Infantile Most common. Symptoms appear at 76mo with relentless
deterioration in neurological function until death at <4y
• Juvenile Symptoms appear aged 2–10y; death occurs <15y
• Adult- or late-onset Rare. Symptoms develop in adolescence/
adulthood, e.g. unsteadiness of gait, swallowing/speech difficulty,
cognitive decline, and/or psychosis. Often results in long-term disability
Antenatal screening is available (b p. 799)—refer if from high-risk population. Otherwise, treatment is supportive.

Glycogen storage diseases Incidence: 71/25,000. Lack of �1 enzyme

involved in glycogen synthesis or breakdown. Characterized by deposition
of abnormal amounts or types of glycogen in tissues. Inheritance is
autosomal recessive for all forms except type VI, which follows an X-linked
inheritance. Symptoms and age of onset vary considerably:
• Predominantly liver involvement (types I, III, IV, VI) l hepatomegaly,
hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis
• Predominantly muscle involvement (types V, VII) l weakness, lethargy,
poor feeding, heart failure
Treatment involves frequent small carbohydrate meals; allopurinol (to
prevent renal urate stone formation and/or gout) ± limiting anaerobic
exercise. A high-protein diet is also helpful for some patients.

Neural tube defects Most neural tube defects are detected ante­
natally by routine antenatal USS. Inheritance is polygenic. Management is
supportive. Types of defect:

Genetic problems

Anencephaly Absent cerebral cortex and skull vault. Usually detected on
antenatal screening. Incompatible with life—those infants born alive die
within hours of birth.
Cranium defects Vary in severity from meningocele (meninges protrude
through the defect) to inoperable encephalocele (brain tissue protrudes
through the skull).
Spina bifida The vertebral arch is incomplete.
• Occulta Covered with skin and fascia. Common and usually asymptomatic
though may be associated with mild gait or bladder problems
• Cystica Herniation of the meninges (meningocele). Uncommon but
treatable usually with minor residual deficit
• Whole cord herniation (myelomeningocele) Is more common and
often results in neurological deficit. It is associated with hydrocephalus,
learning and psychological problems

• Folate supplementation d risk of neural tube defect by 72%.

Supplements are available through the Healthy Start Programme, can be
prescribed or bought OTC from chemists/super­markets. Advise 0.4mg
(400 microgram) od from when pregnancy is being planned to 13wk unless
either parent or an existing child has a neural tube defect, or the mother
has coeliac disease, DM, BMI >30kg/m2, or is taking anticonvulsants—
when advise 5mg od.

Fragile X syndrome Affects 1/1,250 4 births and 1/2,500 5 births.
Genetic abnormality carried on the X-chromosome comprising:
• Associations with
• Large jaw
• Low IQ (20–70)
ADHD, anxiety,
• Long ears
• Large testes
and OCD
• Facial asymmetry
•	High forehead

50% of carrier females have a normal IQ and 50% have a degree of learning
disability. Consider fragile X syndrome in any child with developmental
delay of unknown cause. There is some evidence that folic acid supplements d hyperactive and disruptive behaviour in children with fragile X.
Antenatal testing is possible for future pregnancies.

Management

Red-stained
nappy

Common in the first few
days of life. Usually due
to urinary urates but may
be due to blood from the
cord or vagina (oestrogen
withdrawal bleed)

Reassure

Umbilicus

After birth, the umbilicus
dries, becomes black, and
separates at about 1wk
of age

The umbilical stump can become
infected—offensive odour, pus,
periumbilical flare, malaise—requiring
antibiotics
If a granuloma forms at the site of
separation, exclude a patent urachus
(refer if present) and treat with silver
nitrate cautery

Failure to regain
birth weight by
2wk of age

Usually due to a feeding
problem or minor
intercurrent illness

Monitor weight carefully. Refer to
paediatrics if no cause is apparent, or
if despite treatment of the underlying
cause the baby is not gaining weight

Possetting

Common
The baby effortlessly
brings back 5–10mL of
each feed during the feed
or soon after

Only of concern if the baby is otherwise
unwell or failing to thrive—see
gastro-oesophageal reflux
If thriving, advise parents to feed the
child propped up and slow down the
speed at which feeds are given

Gastrooesophageal
reflux
0 Cow’s milk
protein allergy
(b p. 889) can
present in a
similar way

Similar to possetting, but
an i proportion or all of
each feed is brought back
May cause failure to
thrive, distress ± crying
More common in
premature babies and
those with cerebral palsy
Rare complications are
oesophageal stricture
due to acid reflux or
aspiration pneumonia

Advise parents to feed the child
propped up
Thickening agents (e.g. Carobel®,
Nestargel®) or ready thickened feeds
(e.g. SMA Staydown®) may be helpful as
may Gaviscon® Infant ± ranitidine
Most grow out of the condition by
12–18mo. Refer to paediatrics if failing
to thrive despite simple measures,
chestiness, or anaemia

Colic

Very common in
newborns up to 73mo
Repeated bouts of intense,
unstoppable crying
The baby’s body becomes
tense and rigid, face goes
red, and knees draw
up. Often attributed to
abdominal pain (although
there is no objective
evidence)
Usually occurs in early
evening
Examination is normal

Cause is unknown, and symptoms
resolve spontaneously with time
Advise parents to try colic drops or
gripe water
There is no evidence that changing
from cow’s milk to soya-based formula
is helpful

Child health

Problems of prematurity
Any baby born at <37wk gestation is considered premature. Worldwide,
11% of babies are born prematurely (7.8% in the UK). Prematurity affects
all systems of the body and in general the problems are worse the more
premature the baby:
• 32–36wk gestation—premature. Generally do well—many needing
only tube feeding and warmth
• 28–32wk gestation (1–2% of births)—very preterm. In the UK, 790% survive
• <28wk gestation (0.4% of births)—extremely preterm. Some babies as
premature as 23–24wk gestation survive but there is a high incidence
of disability

Nutrition Preterm babies <34wk suck and swallow poorly so
commonly need nasogastric tube feeding. They are also at particular
risk of hypoglycaemia so need frequent feeds. Breast milk—either the
mother’s or donated milk—is preferred, sometimes with calorie and
mineral supplements. If this is not available, special low birthweight
formula is used. Vitamin and iron supplements are routine until >6mo of
age. Gastro-oesophageal reflux is common.
Thermoregulation Poor in preterm infants, as they have a high
surface area-to-body weight ratio and little subcutaneous fat. A controlled
temperature and adequate insulation with clothes and blankets, where
appropriate, is important.
Respiration
• Preterm infants >32wk gestation May have transient tachypnoea
at birth due to inability to express fluid from their lungs. Some need
oxygen by headbox
• Preterm infants <32wk gestation There may be insufficient surfactant
produced causing respiratory distress syndrome and requiring
surfactant replacement and mechanical ventilation. Incidence and
severity is d by antenatal corticosteroids
• Extremely premature babies May develop chronic lung disease—
defined as being ventilator- or oxygen-dependent at 36wk
post-conception—due to bronchopulmonary dysplasia. These babies
may be sent home on oxygen via nasal cannulae. They are at higher risk
from respiratory infections particularly RSV. Episodes of bradycardia
and apnoea are common. Have a low threshold for readmission
0 All babies born prematurely are at i risk of wheezing, asthma, and
chest infections—the more premature, the greater the risk.
Prevention of RSV infection
• Take precautions to prevent exposure, e.g. avoiding busy waiting
rooms in winter
• Palivizumab is a monoclonal antibody indicated for the prevention of
RSV infection in infants at high risk of infection. Prescribe only under
specialist supervision. Give the first dose before the start of the RSV
season and then give monthly throughout the RSV season

Problems of prematurity

Jaundice The immature liver is less able to process bilirubin so
premature babies are at greater risk of developing neonatal jaundice. They
are also more likely to develop kernicterus so have a lower threshold to
refer for phototherapy.
Infection The immune system is poorly developed, so there is greater
risk of infection. Furthermore these babies exhibit few signs, so have a low
threshold to refer to paediatrics for a septic screen and antibiotics.
Anaemia Low iron stores, d red cell survival, low levels of erythropoietin

and repeated venepuncture lead to anaemia in premature babies. Some
very premature babies may need repeated transfusion. Iron supplements
are routinely given to most premature babies and should be continued
until >6mo old.

Neurology Periventricular haemorrhages are common in very preterm
babies. Small haemorrhages may have few consequences but more
significant bleeds can lead to cystic leucomalacia, hydrocephalus, and
neurodevelopmental problems—in particular cerebral palsy. Hypoxia and
severe illness in the neonatal period can also lead to cerebral damage and
learning disability.
Vision Retinopathy of prematurity (abnormal vascularization) may
occur in very premature babies and may result in visual impairment—
even blindness. All babies born at <32wk gestation or <1,501g birthweight
should have ophthalmological examination prior to discharge from
hospital but may need follow-up and/or laser treatment once home.
Hearing Babies requiring neonatal intensive or special care have i risk
of hearing problems (10–20x i prevalence of significant bilateral hearing
loss). They should have neonatal screening prior to discharge from
hospital and appropriate follow-up.
Bonding Separation of mother and premature baby is often necessary.

Poor bonding is common—and the problem is added to by fear of losing
the baby. In many special care units, periods of ‘kangaroo mother care’ are
used to improve bonding—the baby is nursed skin-to-skin attached to the
mother/father’s chest. Parents may be (quite understandably) very anxious
when their babies first come home after a long period in special care and
need more support and reassurance than other new parents.

Cot death Premature babies have i risk of cot death:

Child health

Neonatal jaundice
Neonatal jaundiceN In the first few days of life, most babies have i

serum bilirubin levels as the liver takes over the excretion of bilirubin from
the placenta. Mild jaundice from age 2–6d is physiological and harmless.
However, very high levels of unconjugated bilirubin are toxic, crossing the
blood–brain barrier and causing encephalopathy (kernicterus).
High-risk babies Who require an extra visual check for jaundice in the
first 48h of life include:
• Babies born at <38wk gestation
• Babies who have siblings who required phototherapy
• Babies whose mothers intend to breastfeed exclusively
Jaundice <24h after birth Any jaundice in the first 24h needs immediate
referral back to hospital to exclude pathological causes (usually haemolysis
or infection) and for monitoring and possible treatment.
Significant jaundice <2wk after birth May be difficult to assess (particularly
in a dark-skinned baby)—examine the baby naked in natural light, check the
sclera of the eyes, gums, and blanched skin. Arrange bilirubin estimation
with a transcutaneous bilirubinometer (usually via midwife or paediatrics).
If the bilirubin level is >250micromol/L or a reading cannot be obtained,
check serum bilirubin. Refer as in Table 24.5.

Neonatal jaundice

Jaundice persisting >2wk (>3wk in preterm babies) Although 10% of
breastfed babies are still jaundiced at 1mo of age, it is important to refer
to paediatrics to exclude pathological causes, including:
•	Hypothyroidism (b p. 850)
•	Haemolysis
• Infection—particularly UTI (b p. 878)
• Liver disease—neonatal hepatitis or biliary atresia
Jaundice at any time If the baby is unwell, has persistently pale, chalky
stools and/or dark yellow urine which stains the nappy (baby urine should
be almost colourless), then refer. If conjugated bilirubin is >25micromol/L
expert advice is essential.

Neonatal hepatitis Presents with persistent neonatal jaundice. Always
requires specialist investigation and management. Possible causes:
• Cystic fibrosis
• Congenital infection, e.g. HBV
• Glycogen storage diseases
• Galactosaemia
• α1-antitrypsin deficiency

Galactosaemia Inborn error of metabolism characterized by i plasma
galactose. Clinical manifestations depend on enzyme defect:
• Galactokinase deficiency Autosomal recessive inheritance. Incidence:
1/40,000. Presents in childhood with cataracts. Treatment involves a
galactose-free diet
• Classic galactosaemia Autosomal recessive inheritance. Incidence:
1/44,000. The child appears normal at birth but becomes anorexic
and jaundiced within a few days or weeks of consuming breast milk
or lactose-containing formula. Vomiting, poor growth, hepatomegaly,
and septicaemia are common and can be rapidly fatal. Treatment
involves eliminating all sources of galactose in the diet. Long-term
complications —poor growth, learning difficulty, infertility, speech and
neurological abnormalities—are common
Biliary atresia Incidence: 1/15,000. End-stage of a sclerosing process in

an initially patent biliary tree. Cause is unclear. Presents with jaundice in
neonates. Prognosis has improved with laparotomy and porto-enterostomy
which relieves the problem in 750–70% of babies.
0 Early diagnosis is particularly important so that surgery can be carried
out <2mo after birth before the liver is irreversibly damaged.

Persistent physiological/breast milk jaundice Diagnosed when
other causes of prolonged jaundice have been excluded. Reassure parents.
Offer breastfeeding support if needed. Monitor to ensure subsides.

Feeding babies
Breastfeeding Preferred way to feed infants from birth until fully

weaned or longer. However, 71 in 3 mothers who start breastfeeding have
stopped by 6wk. Most wish to continue, but problems with painful breasts/
nipples, concern regarding amount of milk the baby is getting and lack
of support are common reasons for stopping. Breastfeeding is something
some find natural and others find difficult. Teaching mother and baby to
breastfeed takes time and patience. Be supportive; ask a midwife, health
visitor, or local breastfeeding advisor to help if needed.
Advantages of breast feeding
•	Encourages a strong bond between mother and baby
• More convenient than bottle-feeding—the milk is ready warmed and
there is no need for sterilized bottles
• d postpartum bleeding
• Cheaper than bottle-feeding
• Protects the baby from infection • d childhood obesity
• d childhood atopy
• d risk of sudden infant death
• Possible d risk of DM for baby and mother in later life
•	Helps the mother d weight after pregnancy
• Protects the mother against breast and ovarian cancer
Common problems with breastfeeding See Table 24.6.

Bottle-feeding

Cow’s milk formula feeds Cow’s milk altered to simulate the composition
of human milk, with added iron and vitamins. Advise parents to choose a
formula suitable for their baby and make it up exactly as the manufacturer
directs. Advise parents to wash feeding bottles/teats well and sterilize
them until >6mo of age. Use a cup rather than bottle >6mo.
Follow-on formula Contains more iron and casein. Not essential unless a
child is not taking solids and is >6mo old. Baby milk suitable from birth can
be used until a switch is made to normal cow’s milk.
Unmodified cow’s milk Not recommended until the baby is >1y old as
less digestible and contains little iron.
Hydrolysed protein and amino acid infant formulae (e.g. Nutramigen®,
Neocate®, Aptamil® pepti) are available on prescription for children with
proven cow’s milk protein allergy, lactose intolerance, or galactosaemia.
Soya protein-based formula Not recommended for babies <6mo of age
because of concerns regarding phyto-oestrogen content. Prescribe only
on consultant advice.

Healthy Start Vouchers that can be used to obtain infant formula milk,
fruit, vegetables, and free vitamins are available for mothers of babies <1y
and for children aged 6mo–4y from low-income households.

a period of time can express milk for someone else to feed
to the baby in a bottle whilst they are gone. Advise mothers
not to attempt this before breastfeeding is well established as
the baby might find the two techniques confusing
Two methods are commonly used:
• Using a commercially available breast pump, or
• By hand into a sterile bowl
Breast milk can be frozen (special bags are available) and
defrosted when required. Bottles should be sterilized and
the milk warmed in the same way as for bottle-feeding
Disease can be
transferred in breast
milk

In general breast milk protects the baby from disease
Some diseases can be transferred in breast milk, e.g.
hepatitis B or HIV. Bottle-feeding is recommended where
uncontaminated water is available

Drugs taken by

Mothers should take medical advice before taking any
drugs (including herbal remedies). For most conditions
drugs safe for use whilst breastfeeding are available
Rarely breastfeeding is contraindicated, e.g. for women

Child health

Weaning, feeding problems, and
failure to thrive
Weaning Current guidelines recommend solids should be introduced
at 76mo, although they stress individual needs of infants and choices of
parents should be considered and supported. Earlier introduction of
solids is linked with i rates of infection and i incidence of allergy and
intolerance to certain foods, e.g. gluten or eggs.
Advice for parents on weaning
• Introduce solids at 76mo of age (never <17wk)—babies are ready
when they can sit up; mouth objects; are interested in food and
chewing; and can reach and grab accurately
• If starting solids when the baby is <6mo old, sterilize feeding bowls/
cutlery before use, and avoid egg, gluten, and fish until baby is >6mo
• Start with a few teaspoons of mashed fruit, vegetable, or cereal, and
progress to home-made purées or mashed up family food without
added salt/sugar. It is usual for stool to change consistency on weaning
• Babies take time to learn how to feed from a spoon and it may be
messy. Wait for the baby to open his/her mouth, and allow babies to
touch the food. Initially babies may only take 2–3 teaspoons/meal
• Gradually offer a wide variety of different foods and textures. Do not
give raw eggs or honey to babies <1y
•	Encourage ‘finger foods’ as soon as the baby can feed him/herself—try
pieces of soft fruit, vegetable, or toast
• Continue giving the baby breast or formula milk—this is the main
source of food until 1y

Feeding problems Parents commonly complain their child is not eating enough or eating the wrong foods. Look for underlying problems if the
child is not growing or developing as normal.
Normal growth/development Reassure the parents that it is normal for
the amount of food eaten to vary from day to day. Consider referral to
the health visitor for advice/support. Advise parents to:
• Sit down for family meals wherever possible
•	Restrict snacks and sugary drinks between meals
• Show little emotion when putting food in front of the child at meal
times and remove the food after 15–20min without comment about
what is or is not eaten; praise children when they have eaten well

Failure to thrive (faltering growth) Failure to gain weight in
infancy as expected is a common problem. Usually head circumference is
preserved relative to length and length relative to weight. Use UK-WHO
growth charts for breastfed babies. Defined as:
• Weight consistently <3rd centile for age, or
• Progressive d in weight over �2 major centile lines
Non-organic causes
• Lack of food due to neglect, lack of education, poverty, or famine
•	Emotional problems e.g. emotional neglect, unhappy family, or other
difficulties at home—this is the most common cause

Weaning, feeding problems, and failure to thrive

Organic causes
• Chronic infection
•	Heart disease
• Gastrointestinal disease, e.g. coeliac disease, chronic diarrhoea
• Metabolic disease, e.g. DM
•	Respiratory disease, e.g. chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis
• Physical feeding problems, e.g. cleft palate, pyloric stenosis
Assessment
• Ask how the child is fed—quantities, times of the day. Check formula
feeds are being made up correctly
• Ask about feeding problems, e.g. regurgitation of food, vomiting
• Ask about other physical problems, e.g. breathlessness, diarrhoea
•	Examine the child carefully from top to toe looking for any physical
abnormalities or signs of developmental delay
• Watch the way the child interacts with you and the parent; look for
evidence of neglect or maltreatment
• Look at the size of the parents—small parents have small children
Management Treat any reversible causes. Continue to measure weight,
length, and head circumference regularly. Try to use the same scales on
each occasion. Refer to paediatrics:
• If no cause for failure to thrive is found or if, despite treatment of a
reversible cause, the child continues to lose or fails to gain weight
• If an abnormality requiring paediatric care is found—urgency depends
on the nature of the abnormality and degree of failure to thrive

Pyloric stenosis Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis usually develops in the first 3–6wk of life (rare >12wk). Failure of the pyloric sphincter
to relax results in hypertrophy of the adjacent pyloric muscle. Typically
affects firstborn, male infants. Pyloric stenosis runs in families and is associated with Turner’s syndrome, PKU, and oesophageal atresia.
Presentation
• Projectile vomiting Milk—no bile. The child is still hungry after
vomiting and immediately feeds again. Rarely there is haematemesis
• Failure to thrive
• Dehydration and constipation (‘rabbit pellet stools’)
• Pyloric mass (feels like an olive) is palpable in the right upper
abdomen (95%)—especially if the child has just vomited
• Visible peristalsis In the epigastrium after a test feed
Differential diagnosis
• Possetting/reflux • Milk allergy
• Infection—especially UTI
• Overfeeding
• i intracranial pressure
• Gastroenteritis
• Other causes of intestinal obstruction

• Uraemia
• Adrenal
insufficiency

Management Admit or refer urgently to paediatric surgery. After
rehydration and investigation to confirm diagnosis, treatment is surgical
with a Ramstedt’s pyloroplasty. There are usually no long-term effects.

Child health

Fever and acute illness in the under 5s
Assessing sick children can be difficult. Infants <6mo old can be particularly difficult to assess and may deteriorate rapidly over a short period of
time. Take parents concerns seriously. Physical signs are often absent or
deceptive. One approach is to exclude ‘alarm’ symptoms and signs that
might point to serious illness. In general, the younger the baby, the lower
your threshold should be for seeking a paediatrician’s opinion.

Remote assessmentN Ask about the features listed in Table 24.7.

• If symptoms/signs suggesting life-threatening disease (e.g. compromised
airway, breathing or circulation, or d level of consciousness)—arrange
for immediate hospital transfer as an emergency
• Children with any Red features are at high risk of serious illness. If
there are no features of an immediately life-threatening illness, arrange
for review by a doctor in a face-to-face setting in <2h
• Amber features indicate intermediate risk of serious illness. Arrange
for assessment by a doctor in a face-to-face setting the same day
• Children with all Green features and no Amber or Red features are at
low risk of serious illness and often can be managed with advice

Face-to-face assessmentN Take a history and perform a full physical examination, including temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and
capillary return. Assess for features of serious disease (see Table 24.7).
Remember to check under clothing and nappies for rashes. Localizing signs
may be absent (e.g. tonsillitis may cause vomiting in small children).
Further management
• If any Red symptoms or signs are present, refer to a paediatrician for
immediate or same-day review, depending on clinical state of the child
• If any Amber symptoms or signs are present, and a cause is found, treat
the cause. If no diagnosis is made, decide on further action based on
knowledge of the family and the clinical state of the child. 3 options:
• Advise the child’s parents to call you if there is any deterioration
(give advice about symptoms/signs they should watch for) or if the
child fails to improve within a defined period of time
• Arrange to review the child again within a few hours, or
• Refer for paediatric review
• If all the Green features and no Amber or Red features are present,
give advice about management at home and symptoms/signs that
should prompt carers to seek further advice
0 Do not prescribe antibiotics for fever of unknown cause.

Common causes of pyrexia Childhood infections are the most
common cause of fever amongst children in general practice (b p. 876).
Consider UTI if no localizing symptoms/signs. Think of TB and endo­
carditis—especially in high-risk patients. Do not forget tropical diseases,
e.g. malaria in children returning from abroad.
Other causes of pyrexia (may present as prolonged fever) Include:
malignancy (e.g. lymphoma, leukaemia), immunological causes (e.g. Still’s
or Kawasaki disease); drugs (e.g. antibiotics); and liver or renal disease.

Acute illness in non-febrile children Sick children do not have to
have a fever. The following are indications for referral for immediate or
same-day paediatric review:
• Any symptoms or signs in the Red column of Table 24.7
• Persistent vomiting—more than half of the previous 3 feeds or bile stained
• Frank blood in the stools or urine
•	History suggestive of apnoeic episodes

Viral upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) Very common.
Children have >5 URTIs each year. Presents with coryza, runny eyes,
and malaise. The child may also have a mild pyrexia and/or a non-specific
maculopapular rash.
Management Examine to exclude tonsillitis and otitis media. If pyrexia
but no other symptoms/signs, check urine to exclude UTI. Most viral
URTIs settle within a few days.

Childhood pneumonia May be viral, bacterial (pneumococcal, Hib, or
staphylococcal), or atypical (e.g. mycoplasma). Presents with �1 of:
• Fever—recurrent or persistent >38.5°C
• Cough
• Chest and/or abdominal pain
• Tachypnoea, recession or other signs of respiratory difficulty
• Crepitations, d breath sounds ± bronchial breathing
Management
• Severe If oxygen saturation <92%, cyanosis, tachypnoea (>70 breaths/
min aged <1y; >50 breaths/min aged >1y), or difficulty breathing/
grunting; dehydrated (or not feeding if <1y); not responding to
antibiotics or the family are unable to manage—admit

Childhood infection

• Less severe Manage in the community. Provide advice about management
of fever and hydration. Prescribe antibiotics—amoxicillin is first-line;
consider a macrolide if penicillin-allergic, mycoplasma or chlamydia is
suspected as the cause of the infection or in addition to amoxicillin if
first-line treatment is ineffective. Co-amoxiclav is the antibiotic of choice if
pneumonia is associated with influenza. Advise parents to bring the child
back for review if no better in 48h or worse in the interim
0 Children <2y with mild symptoms of LRTI do not usually have pneumonia and may not need antibiotics. Reassess if symptoms persist.
Prevention Pneumococcal vaccination is now part of the routine childhood
vaccination programme and is given at 2, 4, and 13mo.
Recurrent chest infection Consider further investigation and/or referral
to look for an underlying cause if a child has a history of �2 probable chest
infections. Possible underlying causes include:
• Sickle cell anaemia
• Asthma
• Foreign body
• Post-infective bronchiectasis
• TB
• Oropharyngeal aspiration, e.g.
• Cystic fibrosis
due to reflux
• Congenital heart/lung defects
• Immune disorders, e.g. HIV, hypogammaglobulinaemia, leukaemia
• X Right middle lobe syndrome

Bronchiolitis Occurs in epidemics—usually in the winter months. Most
episodes are due to respiratory syncitial virus (RSV) infection. Usually
infects infants <1y old and presents with coryza ± fever progressing to
irritable cough, rapid breathing ± feeding difficulty.
Examination Tachypnoea, tachycardia, widespread crepitations over the
lung fields ± high-pitched wheeze.
Management Depends on severity of the symptoms.
• Mild Feeding well, no/mild recession, oxygen saturation >95%—advise
paracetamol suspension as required and fluids. Warn carers about
symptoms/signs of worsening illness
• More severe Lethargy, taking <½ usual feeds, dehydrated, intercostal
recession ± nasal flaring, grunting, respiratory rate >70, cyanosis, oxygen
saturation <95% or apnoeic episodes—admit as a paediatric emergency
High-risk infants Include:
• Premature babies
• Babies <6wk old
• Children with underlying lung disease, congenital heart disease, or
immunosuppression
Have a low threshold for admission. Palivizumab, a monoclonal antibody,
may be used as prophylaxis (b p. 866).
Prognosis Most recover fully in 10–14d. Up to half wheeze with
subsequent viral URTIs.

Child health

Urinary tract infection in childhood
10% girls and 3.5% boys have a urinary tract infection (UTI) in childhood—
the majority in the first year of life. Amongst neonates, boys have more
infections than girls. In all other age groups, 5:48 10:1. 80% infections are
due to E. coli.

Risk factors

• Poor urine flow
•	History suggesting/confirmed past UTI
•	Recurrent fever of unknown origin
• Antenatally diagnosed renal abnormality
• Family history of vesicoureteric reflux
(VUR) or renal disease
• Constipation

• Dysfunctional voiding
•	Enlarged bladder
• Abdominal mass
• Spinal lesion
• Poor growth
•	High blood pressure

Consequences 5–15% develop renal scarring <2y after first infection.
Infections causing renal scarring are associated with adult pyelonephritis,
i BP, impaired renal function, and renal failure. Prognosis is worst for
children with recurrent infection, VUR, and scarring at first presentation.
Clinical presentation Depends on age and site of infection:
• Infants and toddlers Usually non-specific with vomiting, irritability,
fever, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, and prolonged jaundice
• Older children Dysuria, i frequency, abdominal pain, haematuria,
enuresis
• Site Fever >38°C and/or loin pain/tenderness suggests upper UTI/
acute pyelonephritis
ManagementN
Presentation with fever Suspect UTI in any child with fever >38°C with no
obvious cause. Use the traffic light system (b p. 875) to guide management. If any Red features, admit/refer for emergency assessment.
Urine testing Check sample if signs/symptoms of UTI, unexplained fever,
or if a child fails to recover from a fever presumed due to another cause.
A clean catch specimen is best. Otherwise collect using a special bag/pad.
• If >3y—dipstick urine. Send a sample for M,C&S if nitrite or leucocyte
+ve, strong clinical suspicion of UTI, PMH of UTI, or other risk factors
• If <3y—dipstick urine if acutely unwell and urgent microscopy is not
available. Else (and additionally) send a urine for M,C&S
Treatment of children <3y
• With symptoms/signs of UTI—check M,C&S and start antibiotics
• Well with non-specific symptoms—check M,C&S. Act on result
• Unwell with non-specific symptoms—check M,C&S. If urgent
microscopy is not available, check urine dipstick—see Table 24.9
Treatment of children >3y Perform a urine dipstick and act on the
results—see Table 24.9.
Antibiotics Trimethoprim bd for 3d for lower UTI and 7–10d for upper
UTI. Review after 24–48h if not improving and send urine for M,C&S if a
sample has not already been sent.

Send urine for M,C&S if:
• Clinical features of UTI despite dipstick results
• The child appears unwell with no
apparent cause
• The child is <3y of age
• The child has a past history of urine infection

Follow-up Do not check M,C&S to confirm eradication. Only start
prophylactic antibiotics (trimethoprim 1–2mg/kg nocte) if >1 UTI. Treat
any constipation. Advise to drink plenty of fluids.

Further investigation
Children <6mo responding to antibiotics in <48h Arrange USS ±
micturating cystourethrogram (MCUG) depending on USS findings.
Children of any age with atypical infection (defined as: child very unwell,
response to antibiotics took >48h, poor urine flow, abdominal/bladder
mass, i Cr, and/or non-E. coli infection). Arrange:
• Urgent USS
• DMSA scan if <3y of age, and
• MCUG if <6mo, or if <3y and dilation on USS, poor urine flow,
non-E. coli infection, or FH of VUR
Children of any age with recurrent infection (defined as: �2 upper UTI;
1 upper UTI + �1 lower UTI or �3 lower UTI). Arrange:
• USS (urgent if <6mo old) and DMSA scan, and
• MCUG if <6mo
Balanitis b p. 464
Epididymo-orchitis b p. 466
Horseshoe kidney, ectopic kidney, double ureter Common
malformations of the urinary tract. Usually do not affect kidney function
per se but predispose to UTI. Recurrent infections may eventually cause
renal damage.

Child health

Congenital heart disease
Common affecting 76 in 1,000 live births. Congenital heart disease is the
major cause of heart disease in children.

Detection
Antenatal screening 750% of severe congenital heart disease is detected
in utero by USS. If detected during the routine 10–13wk or 18wk anomaly
scan, amniocentesis is routinely offered to screen for Down’s syndrome
(71 in 20 have heart disease—especially PDA, ASD, and/or VSD) and
other chromosomal abnormalities.
Clinical examination Neonatal examination detects <50% of cardiac
malformations not detected antenatally. The rest are detected if a murmur
is found incidentally when examining the child for another reason or when
the child becomes symptomatic.

Presentation
Murmur on routine examination
• Ventriculoseptal defect (VSD) Harsh pansystolic murmur with
splitting of the 2nd heart sound
• Atrioseptal defect (ASD) Systolic murmur in the pulmonary area with
fixed splitting of the 2nd heart sound
• Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) Loud, continual ‘machinery’ murmur
• Aortic stenosis Ejection systolic murmur at the apex and left sternal
edge with a soft and delayed 2nd heart sound. Slow rising pulse, d BP.
Rarely dizziness, faintness, or loss of consciousness on exertion
• Pulmonary stenosis Ejection systolic murmur with ejection click
• Coarctation of the aorta Ejection systolic murmur over the left side
and back; absent/delayed femoral pulses and i BP in upper limbs
Innocent murmurs Murmurs are a common finding in childhood
particularly when examining a febrile child. The majority are not associated
with heart disease—so-called ‘innocent murmurs’. Features:
• Asymptomatic
• Soft, systolic murmur—may vary with position and does not radiate
• Normal 2nd heart sound
• No other associated signs of heart disease (normal pulses, no thrill)
Once a murmur has is known to be ‘innocent’, explain what that means
to the parents—otherwise there may be unnecessary ongoing anxiety.
• Unless the child is febrile when the murmur is heard and it disappears
once afebrile, refer all children with murmurs for echo or paediatric
evaluation—whether the murmur is detected at routine screening, incidentally when examining the chest for another reason, or when examined because symptomatic.
Cyanosis
• <48h old Likely to be due to transposition of the great arteries or
severe pulmonary stenosis
• Later presentation Mostly due to Tetralogy of Fallot (see Table 24.10)

Heart failure
• Breathlessness particularly when

• Failure to thrive
• Sweating

• Fast respiratory and pulse rates
•	Heart enlargement
• Liver enlargement
• Weight i due to fluid retention

Causes of heart failure in the first week of life include:
• Left outflow obstruction
• Coarctation of the aorta
• Severe aortic stenosis
•	Hypoplastic left heart
Later causes:
• Large VSD

• PDA

• Ostium primum ASD

Management In all cases, if new congenital heart disease is suspected,

refer for specialist paediatric or cardiology opinion. Specialist treatment
of valve lesions depends on the gradient measured across the valve. Most
other congenital cardiac lesions (except some VSDs and ASDs) require
surgery—staged for complex lesions.

Child health

Diagnosis of asthma in children
Childhood asthma affects 75% of children in the UK. Peak age of onset is
5y. 40 children/y in the UK still die from asthma.

Diagnosis Is clinical—based on recognizing a characteristic pattern of
episodic symptoms in the absence of an alternative explanation. Asthma is
likely if the child has >1 of the following symptoms:
• Wheeze • Cough
• Difficulty breathing
• Chest tightness
Particularly if these symptoms:
• Are frequent and recurrent
• Occur apart from URTIs
• Are worse at night/in the early morning
• Occur in response to, or are worse after, exercise, other triggers
(e.g. pets, cold/damp air) or with emotions/laughter
Other factors that i the likelihood of asthma include
• Personal history of atopic disorder—probability of asthma in a child
with wheeze is i if: +ve skin tests, blood eosinophilia �4%, and/or
i specific IgE to cat, dog, or mite
• Family history of atopic disorder and/or asthma—the strongest
association is with maternal atopy
• Widespread wheeze heard on auscultation
•	History of improvement in symptoms or lung function in response to
asthma therapy
Clinical features that d the likelihood of asthma include
• Symptoms with colds only, with no interval symptoms—
virus-associated wheeze affects up to 20% of children at some point
• Isolated cough in the absence of wheeze or difficulty breathing
•	History of moist cough
• Prominent dizziness, light-headedness, peripheral tingling
•	Repeatedly normal physical examination of chest when symptomatic
• Normal PEFR or spirometry when symptomatic
• No response to a trial of asthma therapy
• Clinical features pointing to an alternative diagnosis

Further action Based on history and examination, decide how likely
the probability of asthma is:

High probability Start a trial of treatment (b p. 884). Review and assess
response. Reserve further testing for those with a poor response.
Intermediate probability In some children (particularly if <5y) there are
not enough features to make a firm diagnosis of asthma, but no features
suggesting an alternative diagnosis. There are three possible approaches
to reaching a diagnosis:
• Watchful waiting with review If mild, intermittent wheeze and/or
symptoms that occur only with viral URTIs
• Trial of treatment with review Bronchodilators and/or corticosteroids.
Choice depends on frequency and severity of symptoms.
• If a treatment is beneficial, a diagnosis of asthma is probable. Find
the minimum effective dose of therapy. At a later point consider a
trial of reduction/withdrawal of therapy

Diagnosis of asthma in children

• If it is unclear if a child has improved, try withdrawing the treatment.
If treatment is not beneficial, consider further testing and/or referral
• Spirometry Possible >5y. 0 Normal spirometry/PEFR testing, if
performed when the child is asymptomatic, does not exclude asthma.
• If evidence of airway obstruction, assess change in FEV1 in response
to bronchodilator and/or reponse to treatment. i in FEV1 of >12%
from baseline and/or beneficial treatment trial supports a diagnosis
of asthma. Otherwise consider further testing and/or referral
• If no evidence of airways obstruction—consider testing for atopic
status, bronchodilator reversibility when symptomatic (using
home PEFR) and/or bronchial hyper-responsiveness (e.g. exercise
challenge in those with symptoms brought on by exercise).
Consider specialist referral
If low probability of asthma Consider more detailed investigation and/or
specialist referral.
0 Do a CXR if severe disease or clinical suggestion of another condition.

Reasons for referral E = Emergency; U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine
• Severe exacerbation of asthma or severe URTI—E
• Unexpected clinical findings, e.g. focal signs, abnormal voice or cry,
dysphagia, inspiratory stridor—E/U
• Persistent wet or productive cough—U/S
• Failure to thrive—U/S
• Diagnosis unclear or in doubt—U/S/R
• Failure to respond to conventional treatment (particularly inhaled
corticosteroids >400 micrograms/d or frequent use of steroid tablets)—S
•	Excessive vomiting or possetting—S/R
• Symptoms present from birth or perinatal lung problem—S/R
• Family history of unusual chest disease—R
• Nasal polyps—R
• Parental anxiety or need for reassurance—R

0 This is only a rough guide; urgency of referral will depend on the clinical state of the child.

Differential diagnosis See Table 24.11, b p. 886
Prognostic factors
• The earlier the onset of wheeze, the better the prognosis—most
children presenting at <2y become asymptomatic by mid-childhood
• Male gender—risk factor for asthma in pre-pubertal children—but
boys are more likely to ‘grow out’ of asthma during adolescence
• Coexistent atopy—risk factor for persistence of wheeze
• Frequent/severe episodes of wheezing in childhood—associated with
recurrent wheeze that persists into adolescence

Management of an acute asthma attack b p. 1095

Aims of treatment
• To minimize symptoms and impact on lifestyle (e.g. absence from
school; limitations to physical ability)
• To minimize the need for reliever medication
• To prevent severe attacks/exacerbations
GP services and self-management b p. 310. For children ensure
that the following are checked and recorded at least annually:
• Symptom score, e.g. Children’s Asthma Control Test (from 4–11y),
Asthma Control Questionnaire (>5y)
•	Exacerbations, oral steroid use, and time off school/nursery due to
asthma since last check
• Inhaler technique and medication adherence (prescription frequency)
• Personalized asthma self-management action plan
•	Exposure to tobacco smoke (e.g. parental smoking)
• Growth—height and weight centile

Drug therapy Use a stepwise approach (see Figure 24.2 and Figure 24.3,
b p. 887). Start at a step appropriate to the initial severity of symptoms.
Aim to achieve control of the condition and then d by stepping down.
Exacerbations Treat exacerbations early. A rescue course of prednisolone
(30–40mg/d if aged >5y or 20mg/d if aged 2–5y) for 3–14d may be needed
at any step and any time. Alternatively, leukotriene antagonists can be
used for children with episodic asthma—start at the onset of asthma/
coryzal symptoms and continue for 7d.
Short-acting β2 agonists (b p. 306) (e.g. salbutamol). Work
more quickly and/or with fewer side effects than alternatives. Use prn
unless shown to benefit from regular dosing. Using �2 canisters/mo or
>10–12 puffs/d is a marker of poorly controlled asthma.

Management of asthma in children

Step 4: Persistent poor control
Refer to respiratory paediatrician
Step 3: Add-on therapy
In children aged 2–5y, consider trial of leukotriene receptor
antagonist
In those children taking a leukotriene receptor antagonist alone,
reconsider addition of an inhaled steroid 200–400 microgram/d*
In children <2y, consider proceeding to step 4
Step 2: Regular preventer therapy
Add inhaled steroid 200–400 microgram/d*♣
Or leukotriene receptor antagonist if inhaled steroid cannot be used
Start at dose of steroid appropriate to severity of disease
Step 1: Mild intermittent asthma
Inhaled short-acting β2-agonist as needed

* Beclometasone dipropionate or equivalent.
♣
Higher nominal doses may be required if drug delivery is difficult.

Figure 24.2 Summary of stepwise management in children aged <5y
Reproduced in modified format with permission from the British Thoracic Society and SIGN.

Inhaled corticosteroids (b p. 306) Most effective preventer. May be

beneficial even for children with mild asthma. Consider if:
•	Exacerbations of asthma needing oral corticosteroids in the last 2y
• Using inhaled β2-agonists �3x/wk
• Symptomatic �3x/wk or �1 night/wk

Oral steroids b p. 306
Add-on therapy Before initiating a new drug, check compliance,

inhaler technique, and eliminate trigger factors.
• Inhaled long-acting β2 agonists (b p. 306) (e.g. salmeterol). Are
first-choice add-on therapy for children aged >5y to improve lung
function and symptoms. Do not use without inhaled steroid—use of
combination inhalers is recommended. Stop if of no benefit
• Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g. montelukast). May d
symptoms and exacerbations and i lung function. First-choice add-on
therapy for children <5y
• Theophylline or β2-agonist slow-release tablets May d symptoms
and i lung function but side effects are common

Stepping down Review and consider stepping down at intervals �3mo.

Maintain on the lowest dose of inhaled steroid controlling symptoms. When
reducing steroids, cut dose by 25–50% each time. Children with milder asthma
and a clear seasonal pattern can step down more quickly in their good season.

Child health

Selection of inhaler device If possible use a metred-dose inhaler.

Inadequate technique may be mistaken for drug failure. Emphasize
patients must inhale slowly and hold their breath for 10s after inhalation.
Demonstrate inhaler technique before prescribing and check at follow-ups.
Spacers or breath-activated devices are useful for children who find
activation difficult and essential for children <5y. Dry powder inhalers are
an alternative for older children.
Expected PEFR in children b p. 304
Allergen avoidance b p. 311
Complementary therapy b p. 312
Asthma in adolescents Common but may be under-diagnosed due
to under-reporting of symptoms, so specifically ask about symptoms:
• Breathlessness/wheezing with exercise is common; if due to asthma, it
should respond to pre-treatment with a β2-agonist
• Depression/anxiety may make asthma symptoms more prominent
• Advice about risks of smoking/passive smoking is very important
• Inhaler preference is important in ensuring good treatment adherence
• Complementary or alternative medicine use is common and may be
linked with adherence to prescribed medication
• Discuss career choice and highlight occupations that may i symptoms

Constipation and malabsorption
ConstipationN Frequent complaint amongst all age groups of children.
Take a careful history—diagnose constipation if �2 of:
• Abnormal stool pattern:
• <3 stool per wk (except breastfed babies >6wk)
• Hard, large or rabbit-dropping stool
• Overflow soiling (children >1y)
• Symptoms associated with defaecation:
• Distress on stooling or anal pain
• Bleeding associated with hard stool
• Straining
• Poor appetite or abdominal pain that improves after stool passed
• Posture indicating retaining stool (straight legs, back arch, tiptoe)
•	History of previous constipation or anal fissure
Serious underlying causes
•	Hirschsprung’s disease
• Coeliac disease
•	Hypothyroidism

• Anorectal abnormalities
• Neurological conditions
• Abdominal tumours

Management Refer for specialist assessment if any red flag symptoms/
signs suggesting a serious underlying cause:
• Delay in passing meconium or constipation since birth
• Abnormal appearance, position or patency of the anus
•	Ribbon-like stool
• New leg weakness, deformity (e.g talipes), or neuromuscular signs
• Asymmetrical gluteal muscles, sacral naevus, sinus or pit, or scoliosis
• Abdominal distension with vomiting or gross distension
If there is faltering growth, check coeliac serology and TFTs.
Treatment of idiopathic constipation Diagnose if serious underlying
causes have been excluded. Use a macrogol as first-line laxative adjusting
dose according to response. Add a stimulant laxative if ineffective. If
macrogols are not tolerated use a stimulant ± alternative softener.
Continue medication for several weeks after regular bowel habit has been
established. In addition to medication, advise about balanced diet and
adequate fluid intake. Refer for specialist assessment if not responding to
treatment in �3mo (�1mo if <1y old).

Diarrhoea and vomiting b p. 376
Malabsorption In all cases refer for investigation and treatment of the
cause. Usually presents with:
• Chronic diarrhoea
• Steatorrhoea, and/or
• Failure to thrive or weight d
• Iron or other nutrient deficiency
Causes in children
• Common Cow’s milk intolerance (cow’s milk protein allergy, or
lactose intolerance); coeliac disease
• Rarer Cystic fibrosis; chronic infection (e.g. giardiasis); inflammatory
bowel disease

Constipation and malabsorption

Cow’s milk protein allergy Affects 73% of children. Mainly occurs
in bottle-fed infants <6mo old but affects 0.5% of purely breastfed babies
as cow’s milk protein from the mother’s diet is secreted in breast milk.
Presentation May be family history. Often affects >1 body system:
• Gastrointestinal symptoms (50–60%). Diarrhoea (occasionally with
blood); colic; less commonly constipation
• Skin symptoms (50–70%). Urticaria; eczema
• Respiratory and other symptoms (20–30%). Wheeze; rhinitis;
conjunctivitis
Diagnosis Often clinical—try withdrawing cow’s milk. If this resolves
symptoms and they return with reintroduction then cow’s milk protein
allergy is likely. Skin prick/RAST tests have high false +ve and –ve results.
Treatment
•	Eliminate cow’s milk—usually by replacing cow’s milk formula with
hydrolysed protein milk formula (e.g. Nutramigen®)
• 10% of babies are also intolerant to hydrolysed protein formula and
require amino acid formula (e.g. Neocate®)
• Advise parents that solids should be dairy-free
• Most children grow out of cow’s milk protein intolerance and can be
challenged with foods containing milk from 12mo

Lactose intolerance Rare in infancy; more common in childhood.
Presentation in infancy Severe symptoms of abdominal distension,
diarrhoea (explosive and watery) ± vomiting and failure to thrive. Stools
test +ve for reducing sugars. Treatment is with a lactose-free diet.
Presentation in later childhood (>2y) Due to lactase deficiency.
• Common—incidence is very variable depending on place of origin—
but for people of European origin 710–15% (higher if of Asian origin)
• Symptoms tend to be milder with abdominal pain and/or distension
± diarrhoea and/or vomiting appearing at any time from 2y of age to
adulthood. Symptoms improve when milk products are removed from
the diet. Tolerance of milk products is variable—cheese and yoghurt
are better tolerated as lactose is hydrolysed by bacteria
0 Soya milk does not contain lactose. Milk from other animals (e.g. goat’s
milk) does contain lactose. Soya milk contains phyto-oestrogens and has
high glucose content, do not use if <6mo of age or long-term except with
specialist advice.

Cow’s milk intolerance following gastroenteritis Temporary
cow’s milk intolerance is common after a bout of gastroenteritis in
children and can result in continuing diarhhoea (>2wk). Try excluding
cow’s milk from the diet. If symptoms improve, wait until all symptoms
have gone and then reintroduce cow’s milk. If symptoms do not improve,
refer for further investigation.

Child health

Gut atresia, hernias, and intussusception
Oesophageal atresia b p. 385
Duodenal atresia Usually associated with other abnormalities—

particularly Down’s syndrome. If not detected on antenatal USS, presents
postnatally with bile-stained vomiting. AXR reveals a ‘double bubble’ with
air in stomach and first part of duodenum but none beyond. Requires
surgical correction.

Anorectal atresia (imperforate anus) 1 in 4,000 live births. Usually
the baby fails to pass meconium and no anus is visible. There is often a
fistula to the urethra (boys) or vagina (girls). Treatment is surgical. In the
period after surgery, anal dilation is vital to prevent stricture and starts
2wk post-op. It requires use of graded dilators by the baby’s parents for
several months. Faecal incontinence may be a problem but can usually be
managed using a combination of dietary manipulation, enemas, and drug
treatment.
Umbilical hernia Common. Due to a defect in the umbilical ring
when the cord separates. More common in people of black ethnic origin
and associated with certain syndromes (e.g. trisomy 13 and 18). Usually
resolves spontaneously. Strangulation is rare. Refer for surgery if an
umbilical hernia persists until >2y of age.
Inguinal hernia
• Non-acute History of intermittent groin ± scrotal swelling—the
spermatic cord may be thickened on the affected side. Refer to
paediatric surgery for repair (herniotomy)
• Acute Sudden appearance of an irreducible groin or scrotal swelling—
necessitates emergency admission for reduction and repair

Diaphragmatic hernia Incidence: 1 in 2,500 live births. A defect in
one hemidiaphragm allows the bowel to herniate into the chest cavity l
pulmonary hypoplasia in utero or lung compression postnatally. Detected
antenatally on USS or postnatally when the child develops respiratory
distress soon after birth—CXR confirms diagnosis. Corrective surgery
is associated with high mortality but once successfully repaired the child
usually has no further difficulties.
Exomphalos and gastroschisis
• Exomphalos Complete return of the gut into the abdominal cavity
fails to occur during intrauterine life. At birth there is a swelling at the
umbilicus, consisting of gut covered by a membrane
• Gastroschisis There is a defect in the abdominal wall through which
exposed gut prolapses
Exomphalos and gastroschisis are usually detected antenatally at routine
USS. Delivery then takes place at a specialist centre where surgical repair
can be undertaken soon after birth. Once repaired prognosis is good.

Gut atresia, hernias, and intussusception

Intussusception The invagination of one part of the bowel into the

lumen of the immediately adjoining bowel. It is the most common cause
of intestinal obstruction in young children and usually occurs in previously healthy children. Incidence: 2 in 1,000 live births. Peak age: 5–18mo
4:5 82:1.
Associations
• Seasonal variation suggests an underlying viral cause—rota- and
adenoviruses have both been implicated
• Intestinal polyps
• Meckel’s diverticulum
•	Henoch–Schönlein purpura
Types
• Ileo-ileal Ileum invaginates into adjacent ileum
• Ileo-colic Most common type—an ileo-ileal intussusception extends
through the ileo-caecal valve
• Ileo-caecal The apex of the intussusception is the ileo-caecal valve
• Colo-colic Colon invaginates into adjacent colon—may be secondary
to bowel tumour
Presentation Very variable. Always have a high index of suspicion.
• Abdominal colic—paroxysms of pain during which the child draws up
his/her legs—the child often screams with the pain and becomes pale.
Episodes usually are 10–15min apart and last 2–3min but become more
frequent with time
• Vomiting—early symptom
•	Rectal bleeding—passage of blood (‘redcurrant jelly stool’) or slime
per rectum is a late sign
• Sausage-shaped mass in the abdomen—usually in the right upper
quadrant—though not always present
• The child becomes rapidly worse if not treated early, becoming toxic
and developing an obstructive picture with distended abdomen ± faec­
ulent vomiting.

Differential diagnosis Other causes of bowel obstruction; gastroenteritis;
constipation; haemolytic uraemic syndrome.
Management Admit as an acute surgical emergency. Untreated
intussusception is usually fatal. Treatment is with reduction by air or
barium enema, or surgery.

Child health

Growth disorders
Take every opportunity to weigh and measure every child. Plot height,
weight (and head circumference if <1y) on centile charts. Always correct
the age of the child for prematurity at birth.

Failure to thrive b p. 872

Obesity b p. 178

Calculating expected height Small parents have small children and

tall parents have tall children—always calculate expected height of the
child before deciding the child has short stature or excessive height.
Expected height = (mother’s height + father’s height) ÷ 2
Then: add 6cm for a boy or subtract 6cm for a girl.

0 3% of ‘normal’ children fall under the 3rd and 3% above the 97th centile.

Short stature Height <3rd centile. Mainly healthy children (80%) but
may indicate physical or emotional problems—especially if both parents
have heights >3rd centile or serial measurements show growth has fallen
below that expected from the centile chart. Causes:
• Genetic Achondroplastic dwarfism; familial short stature; Turner’s
syndrome; familial growth delay (children have delayed pubertal
growth spurt but eventually reach normal height)
• Physical Low birthweight conditions; endocrine causes, e.g. growth
hormone deficiency, hypopituitarism, hypothyroidism, DM; chronic
illness, e.g. severe asthma, heart disease, chronic infection
• Non-organic Poor nutrition; emotional neglect; eating disorders
Assessment
• Ask how the child eats and about problems with feeding the child—
appetite, food fads, special diets, quantities/times, snacks, etc.
• Ask about other physical problems, e.g. breathlessness, diarrhoea
•	Examine the child carefully from top to toe looking for any physical
abnormalities or signs of developmental delay
• Watch the way the child interacts with you and the parent. Look for
evidence of neglect or maltreatment
• Look to see how large the parents are—2 small parents will probably
have a small child
Management Treat reversible causes. Continue to measure height and
weight regularly. Refer to paediatrics if no cause for short stature, or an
abnormality requiring specialist care, is found, or if, despite treatment of a
reversible cause, the child fails to grow along his/her growth curve.

Pituitary dwarfism d function of the anterior pituitary gland, causing
short stature or failure to thrive. Skeletal maturation, assessed by bone
age, is usually >2y behind chronologic age. Causes:
• Idiopathic
• Midline defect, e.g. cleft palate
• Genetic
• Pituitary tumour, e.g. craniopharyngioma
Management Specialist management is essential. Treatment is with growth
hormone ± cortisol, thyroid hormone, and/or gonadal sex steroids.
0 Growth hormone treatment i risk of slipped femoral epiphysis.

Growth disorders

Excessive height Most children with height >97th centile come from

tall families. Pathological causes of excess height are rare and include
pituitary adenoma (gigantism), thyrotoxicosis, precocious puberty,
Marfan’s syndrome, and homocystinuria. Refer if a child is much taller than
predicted height or deviates from his/her growth curve.

Head growth At birth, head circumference is 32–37cm (term infant); the
anterior fontanelle measures 2.5 x 2.5cm, becoming smaller until it closes
any time from 6mo–18mo. Most head growth occurs in infancy. Consider
referring children with head circumference <3rd or >97th centile.
• Microcephaly 1 in 1,000 births. Small head out of proportion with the
size of the body. Associated with developmental delay. Causes: genetic,
intrauterine infection (e.g. rubella, CMV), chromosome abnormality,
fetal alcohol syndrome, hypoxia
• Macrocephaly Large head circumference. Causes:
• Hydrocephalus —suspect if head circumference deviates from the
normal curve or if there are signs of i intracranial pressure—refer
• Megalencephaly —usually benign and familial—rarely associated
developmental delay
• Asymmetrical skull Causes: postural effects, e.g. children who
always sleep on one side (reassure–usually resolves with time);
craniosynostosis (premature fusion of skull sutures—if suspected refer
for prompt neurosurgical opinion)
Disorders of puberty
Delayed puberty Affects 72%. No pubertal changes by 13y in girls or
14y in boys, or no progression of puberty over 2y. May be constitutional
(>50% boys) or pathological (80% girls). In all cases, refer to a paediatrician
for further assessment. Pathological causes:
• Failure of the ovaries/testes (p or hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism)
• Failure of stimulation of normal gonads to produce sex hormones (s
or hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism)
Precocious puberty Puberty before the normal age for the population (in
the UK: <8y for girls; <9y for boys). Affects 4–5% girls. 5:48 5:1. In all
cases, refer for further investigation. Types:
• Central or true precocious puberty (80%). Premature activation of
the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis. No pathological cause is
found in 50–60% 4 and 90% 5. There may be a family history
• Pseudo-precocious puberty (20%). i level of sex hormones in the
absence of excess FSH or LH. There is usually a pathological cause
Other problems of puberty
• Asymmetric breast growth in girls Almost universal. Reassure that
usually evens out by the time of full maturation
• Gynaecomastia in boys 750% during puberty. Small, firm lump under
one/both nipples. Reassure. Usually resolves without treatment
• Primary amenorrhoea (without delayed puberty) b p. 706
• Premature pubarche (or adrenarche) Early appearance of pubic
± axillary hair and body odour, without other signs of precocious
puberty. If no other abnormalities of androgen excess, reassure

Other childhood endocrine problems
Diabetes mellitus b p. 344
Addison’s disease b p. 368
Congenital goitre Enlarged thyroid gland present at birth ± hypo- or

hyperthyroidism. Hypothyroid babies are treated with thyroxine; if there
is tracheal compression or hyperthyroidism treatment is surgical.

Hypothyroidism
Neonatal (congenital) hypothyroidism b p. 850
Juvenile (acquired) hypothyroidism Usually due to autoimmune thyroiditis
(Hashimoto’s thyroiditis). Often insidious onset with i weight, constipation,
dry or coarse hair, and sallow, cool, or mottled coarse skin. In children
there may also be growth retardation, delayed skeletal maturation ±
delayed puberty. TFTs confirm diagnosis. Refer to paediatrics for specialist
management. Treatment is with thyroxine replacement.

Hyperthyroidism
Neonatal hyperthyroidism Rare but potentially life-threatening. Occurs in
infants of mothers with current or prior Graves’ disease due to passage of
autoantibodies across the placenta. Presentation:
• Failure to thrive
•	Exophthalmos
• Feeding problems
• Vomiting
• Goitre
• i BP
• Diarrhoea
• Frontal bossing
• Irritability
• Microcephaly
• Tachycardia
Refer for specialist management. Affected infants generally recover in
<4mo. Long-term consequences include premature fusion of the cranial
sutures (craniosynostosis) and developmental delay.
Juvenile hyperthyroidism Usually Graves’ disease (b p. 364).
Features due to hyperthyroidism 	     Eye features
• Double vision
• Weight d
•	Eye discomfort ± protrusion
• Tremor
(exophthalmos and proptosis)
• Palpitations (may have AF)
• Lid lag
•	Hyperactivity
• Ophthalmoplegia
• Diffuse goitre ± thyroid bruit
TFTs confirm diagnosis. Refer for specialist management. Treatment is
with antithyroid medication. Spontaneous resolution in <2y is the norm.
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) Also known as adrenogenital
syndrome or adrenal virilism. Autosomal recessive trait due to absence or
deficiency of any of the enzymes needed for synthesis of cortisol. Each
enzyme block causes a characteristic deficiency. 2 patterns:
• Androgens accumulate causing virilization of an affected female fetus
• Androgen synthesis is impaired causing inadequate virilization of an
affected male fetus (much rarer)
Presentation and management Ambiguity of the external genitalia. Less
severe forms may go unnoticed until puberty. There may be a family
history of CAH, ambiguous genitalia, or neonatal death. Rarely presents
with Addisonian crisis. Refer for specialist management. Treatment is
usually with glucocorticoid ± mineralocorticoid replacement.

Other childhood endocrine problems

Male hypogonadism d function of the testes. 3 types:

• Primary Damage to the Leydig cells impairs androgen (testosterone)
secretion, e.g. Klinefelter’s syndrome, anorchia (absent testes)
• Secondary (hypogonadotrophic) Disorders of the hypothalamus
or pituitary impair gonadotrophin secretion which may result in
impotency and/or infertility. e.g. panhypopituitarism
• Resistance to androgen action Presentation depends on age of onset:
• In utero —ambiguity of genitalia or female appearance, small penis,
incomplete testicular descent
• In childhood —delayed or impaired puberty, impaired development
of male sexual characteristics ± gynaecomastia
• In adulthood —d libido, impotence, loss of muscle power, testicular
atrophy, fine wrinkling of the skin around eyes and lips, sparse body
hair, osteopeonia, gynaecomastia

Management Refer for specialist investigation. Treatment depends on
the nature of the deficiency.

Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) X-linked genetic disorder

affecting 1 in 62,000 male births. Abnormalities within androgen receptors
result in the individual being genotypically male (46XY) but phenotypically
female. External genitalia are female in complete AIS (CAIS), but are often
ambiguous in partial AIS (PAIS). The testes fail to descend and are usually
found in the groin—rarely within the abdomen. At puberty, breast development occurs and female contours form, but there is little or no pubic or
axillary hair. Patients often present with primary amenorrhoea.
Management As diagnosis is often made in teenage years, young people
with CAIS have usually been treated as female since birth. Specialist
support is always required. Testes are usually removed as they have
malignant potential, and oestrogens given to complete secondary sexual
development.

Dealing with sexual ambiguity detected at the neonatal
or 6-week check
• Be honest—do not guess the gender of the child
•	Explain that there are rare conditions where girls may be virilized or
boys undermasculinized, causing girls to look like boys and vice versa
• Arrange paediatric assessment as soon as possible for further
investigations, gender assignment, and ongoing management

Child health

Funny turns and febrile convulsions
Funny turns Small children are often brought to the GP by their
parents because they have had a funny turn. The major questions are: was
the episode a fit? If so, what caused it? If not, then is there another serious
underlying cause, e.g. heart disease?
History A good history from a witness is essential. Ask:
• When did the attack happen and where?
• Were there any precipitating events or warning signs, e.g. viral illness;
fever; strong emotions (was the child angry or upset?); head injury?
• What happened? Did the child lose consciousness? Jerk his limbs? If
so, was the jerking generalized or restricted to one area of the body?
What did the child look like during the attack, e.g. colour, floppiness?
Did anything else happen during the attack, e.g. tongue biting?
•	How long did the attack last?
• What happened after the attack? Was the child conscious straight
away? Was there disorientation or drowsiness?
Also check
• General history—is the child well? Does the child have any ongoing
medical problems? Past medical history—serious illness, neurological
and/or developmental problems, heart problems.
• Birth history—problems in pregnancy, birth trauma
• Family history—epilepsy
Examination Full general/neurological examination; developmental
milestones. Plot head circumference/weight on centile chart.
Differential diagnosis Epileptic attacks—febrile convulsion or childhood
epilepsy (b p. 898); non-epileptic attacks.

Non-epileptic attacks Usually self-limiting and harmless. Frightening

for parents/carers, so education about likely duration and cause of attacks
and reassurance the child will come to no harm are important.
Simple blue breath-holding attacks Onset usually >6mo of age. Common.
Provoked by frustration or upset. Signs: +ve Valsalva manoeuvre, cyanosis,
stiffening, and coma. No treatment needed—spontaneous recovery. Most
children ‘grow out’ of the attacks by 3y.
White reflex asystolic (anoxic) attacks Most common from 6mo—2y.
Usually triggered by minor injury or anxiety. Signs: vagal asystole, pallor,
rapid coma, stiffening, upward eye movement ± urinary incontinence. No
treatment needed—spontaneous recovery.
Reflex syncope or vasovagal attacks (‘faints’) b p. 551
Others causes are rare in children but include
• Cardiac arrhythmias—refer if recurrent loss of consciousness or
collapse on exertion for paediatric cardiology assessment
• Sleep phenomena
•	Hyperventilation
•	Hypoglycaemia
• Benign monoclonus of infancy
• Fictitious or induced illness
• Benign paroxysmal vertigo

Funny turns and febrile convulsions

Febrile convulsions Epileptic seizures provoked by fever in otherwise normal children. Prevalence: 3–5% of children aged 6mo–5y (peak
age 18mo). There is often a family history. Seizures are usually brief
(<5min) and generalized. Causes (in order of decreasing frequency): viral
infections; otitis media; tonsillitis; UTI; gastroenteritis; LRTI; meningitis;
post-immunization.
Management of the fitting child b p. 1070
Further management Most children do not require admission. Check
temperature, assess respiratory/heart rate, capillary return, and level of
consciousness. Examine for a source of infection. If there is no obvious
cause and not being admitted, check an MSU.
• Complex convulsions are more likely to be provoked by a serious
condition. Suspect serious pathology if a child has:
•	Had a prolonged (>10min) or focal febrile convulsion, or
• Not recovered within an hour of a febrile convulsion
Admit if
• Complex seizure, the child was drowsy before the seizure, is irritable,
systemically unwell or ‘toxic’, and/or the cause of the fever is unclear
• Symptoms/signs of meningitis (b p. 1078); petechial rash; recent
or current treatment with antibiotics (may mask symptoms/signs of
meningitis); or aged <18mo (meningitis may have non-specific signs)
• The cause of the fever requires hospital management in its own right
•	Early review by a doctor is not possible, inadequate home
circumstances, or the carer is anxious or unable to cope
For children not being admitted Reassure parents/carers that febrile
convulsions do not harm the child. Antipyretics (e.g. paracetamol) do not
prevent convulsions but are useful for symptom control. Advise parents
to seek urgent medical help if the child deteriorates in any way, develops
a non-blanching rash, fits again, or they are worried. Arrange early review
(in <24h). Recommend that immunization schedules are completed.
Consider outpatient referral if
• Diagnosis of febrile convulsion is in doubt
• Febrile convulsions have been frequent, severe, and/or complex, and
prophylactic treatment (with buccal midazolam, rectal diazepam or
continuous anticonvulsants) might be indicated
• The child is at i risk of epilepsy, e.g. coexistent neurological or
developmental conditions; history of epilepsy in a first-degree relative
• Parents/carers are anxious despite reassurance or request referral
Prognosis Febrile convulsions recur in subsequent febrile illness in 730%
of children. 1% of children having a febrile convulsion go on to develop
epilepsy (compared to 0.4% of children who do not).

Child health

Childhood epilepsy
Childhood epilepsy is a susceptibility to continuing seizures. Prevalence i
with age from 74 in 1,000 children at 7y to 75 in 1,000 children at 16y. 60%
of adult epilepsy starts in childhood.

Risk factors Neurological abnormalities or developmental delay; family
history; past history of febrile convulsions—1% develop epilepsy.
Diagnosis Seizures, faints, and funny turns can be difficult to distinguish
and diagnose (b p. 896). A reliable eye witness account is the key.
• Refer to a specialist paediatrician with training and expertise in epilepsy for diagnosis. All children who have had a first non-febrile seizure
should be seen in <2wkN.

Management of the fitting patient b p. 1070
Long-term management of epilepsy b p. 576
Epileptic syndromes In children, epilepsy is considered in terms of

the ‘epileptic syndrome’. Identifying a syndrome enables predictions about
cause, severity, and prognosis. Epileptic syndromes are characterized by a
set pattern of seizure type(s) ± other features: physical appearance; age at
onset; family history; associated learning disability and/or developmental
delay; associated neurological findings; and EEG (should be undertaken in
any child with a history of �2 epileptic seizures).
0 It is not possible to identify a syndrome in 30%—and symptoms/signs
may take months to evolve until diagnosis can be made in others.

Benign rolandic epilepsy Also known as childhood epilepsy with
centrotemporal spikes. 15–20% of childhood epilepsy. Starts in children
aged 2–12y (peak age 7–10y)—usually stops by 13y. Frequently, there
is a family history. Clonic, partial sensorimotor attacks affect the face,
tongue, pharynx, hand, and arm. Most common on falling asleep (>½ have
seizures only during sleep) or soon after waking. Secondary generalization
to tonic-clonic seizures may occur. EEG is characteristic. Use of drug
treatment depends on frequency and severity of seizures.
Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME) 4–12% of childhood epilepsy.

Age of onset 5–24y (peak age 10–16y). 50% have FH of epilepsy. Presents
with sudden, brief, bilaterally symmetrical and synchronous involuntary
muscle contractions. Upper body > lower body. May cause the patient
to throw objects or fall. Consciousness is often maintained. Frequently
occurs soon after waking. Triggers may include light (50%), tiredness, or
emotion. Generalized tonic-clonic seizures—often starting with a series of
myoclonic jerks—appear <4y after onset of myoclonic seizures in 790%.
Absence seizures also occur in 15–30%. EEG is characteristic.
Management and prognosis Usually treated with sodium valproate—
fits may not be well controlled with medication. JME does not remit
spontaneously. Lifelong medication is needed—relapse rate is 790% on
withdrawal of anti-epileptic medication.

Childhood epilepsy

Absence seizures (petit mal) 10–12% of childhood epilepsy. Age

of onset 4–10y (peak age 5–7y); 5 > 4; 715% have a family history. The
child stops what he is doing and may stare into middle space for a period
of seconds (mean 4–20s). Can occur 50–100x/d. Deterioration in school
performance may be the first sign. Separating absence attacks from daydreaming can be difficult. EEG is characteristic.
Management and prognosis 80% become seizure-free with sodium
valproate. 715% go on to develop JME. 710% (without other adverse
factors) have absence or tonic-clonic seizures in adult life.
Localization-related epilepsies Up to 30% of childhood epilepsy.
Focal (partial) seizures that may be symptomatic (known underlying
cause) or cryptogenic (cause not found). Clinical features, disabilities, and
prognosis depend on cause and location of the brain abnormality.
Infantile spasms (West’s syndrome) Starts in the first year of life
(peak age: 4mo). Runs of tonic spasms—usually flexion spasms (‘salaam’
spasms)—occur every 5–10s. Characteristic EEG. Associated with loss of
vision and social interaction. Treatment is with steroids and anti-epileptics
(usually vigabatrin). Poor prognosis—30–50% have cerebral palsy; 85%
have a cognitive disability; 20% death rate.
Sturge–Weber syndrome Unilateral capillary naevus (port wine
stain)—usually over the forehead/eyelid; epilepsy (90%); developmental
delay (50%); hemiparesis and/or homonymous hemianopia (30%) and
glaucoma in the affected eye. Treatment is supportive.
Lennox–Gastaut syndrome Severe, early onset form of epilepsy
(starts aged 2–6y) with multiple seizure types and typical EEG. Often
resistant to treatment.

Particular problems to look for in children with epilepsy
• Developmental problems—25% have special educational needs; >20%
have moderate/severe learning disability. Specific cognitive disability
(e.g. with reading or arithmetic) may have a serious impact on a child’s
education if not recognized
• Social stigmatization (perceived or experienced) is common. Children
may have problems making friends because they are not allowed
to do everything other children do or have funny turns and are
considered ‘odd’. Psychosocial problems include lack of confidence,
poor self-esteem, behavioural problems (e.g. conduct disorder, school
refusal), dependence on others, anxiety, and depression
• Adverse effects of anti-epileptic drugs—for girls discuss the risk to
unborn child and interactions with contraception
• Physical trauma—may occur as a result of having a seizure

Arthritis in children
Joint and limb pains are common in children. Arthritis is rare.

Presentation of arthritis in children
Older children Usually present with well-localized joint pains ± hot,
tender, swollen joints.
Babies and young children May present with immobility of a joint or a
limp, but the diagnosis can be extremely difficult.

Differential diagnosis of joint pains in children

• Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA—incidence 1 in 10,000)
• Infections, e.g. TB, rubella, Lyme disease
•	Rheumatic fever
•	Henoch–Schönlein purpura
• Traumatic arthritis
•	Hypermobility syndrome
• Leukaemia, lymphoma, or bone malignancy
• Sickle cell disease
• SLE and connective tissue disorders
• Transient synovitis of the hip (irritable hip)
• Septic arthritis
• Perthes’ disease
• Slipped femoral epiphysis

Septic arthritis b p. 521
Types of childhood arthritis See Table 24.12.
Management of children with arthritis
• If suspected, refer urgently to paediatrics for confirmation of diagnosis
• Once confirmed, ensure the child is referred to a specialist paediatric
rheumatology unit to avoid long-term disability. These units have
multidisciplinary facilities for rehabilitation, education, and surgical
intervention (if necessary) and support both the family and the child
• NSAIDs and paracetamol help pain and stiffness, but corticosteroids
and immunosuppressants (e.g. methotrexate) are often required for
systemic disease. Monoclonal antibody therapy may be used if first-line
disease-modifying agents are ineffective
•	Ensure families apply for any benefits that might be available to them
• Tell families about self-help and support groups
• Support families in any applications made to adapt the home or school
environment for the child’s condition

Child health

Paediatric dermatology
Birthmarks
Strawberry naevus (capillary haemangioma)
• Not usually present at birth
• Occurs anywhere on the skin surface
• Starts as a small, red patch, then grows rapidly over a few months into
a bright red vascular lump
• After initial growth, the naevus stays the same size for 6–12mo, then
involutes and disappears by 5–7y
• No treatment is needed. Parents may need considerable reassurance
• If interfering with feeding, breathing, or vision—refer for treatment
with intralesional steroids or laser
Port wine stain (naevus flammeus)
• Present at birth
• Irregular red/purple macule which often affects one side of the face
• Permanent—may become darker and lumpy in middle age
• May be associated with other abnormalities, e.g. intracranial vascular
malformation (Sturge–Weber syndrome—b p. 899)
Salmon patch (stork mark)
• The most common vascular naevus (750% neonates)
• Small, telangiectatic lesion forming a pink macule—most commonly at
the nape of the neck or on the upper face
• Facial lesions resolve spontaneously—those on the neck may persist.
No treatment is needed
Mongolian blue spot
• Bluish discoloration of the skin, usually over buttocks and lower back
in dark-skinned babies
• Of no clinical significance but may occasionally be mistaken for bruising
and non-accidental injury
• Usually disappears by 1y

Congenital melanocytic naevi 71.5% of neonates.
•
•
•
•

Noted at birth as raised nodules or plaques of black or brown
May be hairy, irregular, and single or multiple
Classified by size: <1.5cm—small; 1.5–20cm—medium; >20cm—large
There is a risk of malignant change to melanoma—the larger the
naevus the greater the risk
• Laser therapy can improve cosmetic appearance

Nappy rash Most common type of nappy eruption. Usually seen in
young infants—rare >12mo. An irritant dermatitis due to skin contact
with urine or faeces.
Presentation Glazed erythema in the napkin area, sparing skinfolds.
Secondary bacterial or fungal infection is common.
Differential diagnosis
• Seborrhoeic eczema

• Candidiasis

• Napkin psoriasis

Paediatric dermatology

Management
• Advise parents to keep the nappy area dry
• Give baby as much time as possible with the nappy off
• Apply moisturiser as soap substitute
• Apply a barrier cream between nappy changes—although this may
interfere with the action of some modern nappies
• Topical treatment with an antifungal combined with hydrocortisone is
effective if the nappy rash is not clearing

Infantile seborrhoeic eczema
• Starts in the first few weeks of life
• Affects body folds—axilla, groins, behind ears, neck ± face and scalp
(‘cradle cap’). Flexural lesions present as moist, shiny, well-demarcated
scaly erythema. On the scalp, neck, and behind the ears, a yellowish
crust is usual
• Treat flexural lesions with emollients and 1% hydrocortisone ointment,
or with clotrimazole and hydrocortisone cream
• Scalp lesions respond to OTC cradle cap creams

Candidiasis Often complicates nappy rash or infantile seborrhoeic eczema.
Erythema, scaling, and pustules involve the flexures. There may be associated
satellite lesions. Treatment is with a topical antifungal, e.g. clotrimazole.
Juvenile plantar dermatosis Presents with red, dry, fissured and
glazed skin principally over the forefeet. Sometimes involves the whole
sole. Usually starts in primary school years and resolves spontaneously
in mid-teens. Due to wearing socks and/or shoes made from synthetic
materials. Emollients help but topical steroids are ineffective. Advise
cotton socks and leather shoes.
Accessory nipples Commonly seen on the milk line in both male and
female infants. Usually small and inconspicuous. No treatment is required.
Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome Rare but serious skin

infection seen in infants/young children. Caused by staphylococcal infection releasing epidermolytic toxin causing widespread erythema/blistering. The epidermis shears off giving the appearance of scalded skin.
Admit as a paediatric emergency for IV antibiotics and supportive treatment. 0 Can also affect immunosuppressed adults.

Child health

Diagnosis of cancer in children
Every year in the UK, 1,550 children are diagnosed with and 260 children
die from cancer. The most common type of childhood cancer is acute
leukaemia (1 in 3) followed by brain tumour (1 in 4). Risk of developing
cancer for an individual child is 71:500. 5y survival is 78%; of those that
survive 5y, 10% die as a result of tumour recurrence or treatment effects.
Diagnosis of childhood malignancy is a particular challenge in primary care.
GPs rarely see children with cancer, and the cancers that children get are
often unfamiliar to them. Always have a high index of suspicion and if in
doubt refer for a specialist opinion. Referrals should be made to a paediatrician or specialist in children’s cancer.
0 Some congenital/genetic syndromes may be associated with i risk of
childhood cancer (e.g. Down’s syndrome—leukaemia; neurofibromatosis
and tuberous sclerosis—CNS tumours).

Abdominal distensionN If persistent or progressive, examine the
abdomen:
• If a mass is found, refer immediately
• If the child is uncooperative and abdominal examination is not possible,
or if examination is difficult, consider referral for urgent abdominal USS

Unexplained or persistent back painN Examine the child and check
FBC and blood film. Consider X-ray and/or discussion with a paediatrician.
If no cause is found, refer urgently.
Admission or referral to be seen the same dayN Any child with:
•	Hepatosplenomegaly
• Unexplained petechiae
• Unexplained urinary retention
• d conscious level
•	Headache and vomiting that cause early morning waking or occur on
waking, as these are classic signs of i intracranial pressure 0 <1% of
patients presenting with headache have a brain tumour
• Children <2y with new-onset seizures (excluding febrile convulsion);
bulging fontanelle; extensor attacks; and/or persistent vomiting
• FBC suggesting malignancy
• Mediastinal, hilar, or thoracic mass on CXR

Referral to be seen the same day or within 2wkN Any child with:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

New-onset seizures
Cranial nerve abnormalities
Visual disturbances
Leg weakness—refer immediately if gait abnormalities or motor or
sensory signs
Other motor/sensory signs
Abdominal mass
Skin nodules in a baby that could be metastatic neuroblastoma
Proptosis
Shortness of breath—particularly if not responding to bronchodilators

Diagnosis of cancer in children

Urgent referral to be seen in <2wkN Refer:

• When a child presents several times (�3x) with the same problem, but
with no clear diagnosis
• If white papillary reflex (leukocoria)
• If aged �2y with persistent headache where you cannot carry out an
adequate neurological examination in primary care
• If aged <2y with:
• Abnormal i in head size
• Arrest/regression of motor development and/or altered behaviour
• Abnormal eye movements and/or lack of visual following
• Poor feeding/failure to thrive
• New squint/change in visual acuity
• If unexplained mass at any site that has �1 of the following features—
the mass is:
• Deep to the fascia
• Non-tender
• Progressively enlarging
• Associated with a regional lymph node that is enlarging
• >2cm in diameter
• If lymphadenopathy with �1 of the following features (particularly if
no evidence of local infection and/or associated with general ill health,
fever or weight loss):
• Non-tender, firm, or hard lymph nodes
• Lymph nodes >2cm in size
• Lymph nodes progressively enlarging
• Any axillary nodes (in the absence of local infection or dermatitis)
• Any supraclavicular nodes
• If unexplained haematuria
• If persistent localized bone pain/swelling and X-ray suggesting cancer
• If unexplained deteriorating school performance or developmental
milestones, or unexplained behavioural and/or mood changes
• If rest pain or unexplained limp—consider X-ray and/or discussion
with a paediatrician before, or as well as, referral
• If family history of retinoblastoma and/or visual problems
InvestigationsN Check FBC and blood film if:
• Pallor and/or fatigue
• Unexplained irritability
• Unexplained fever
• Persistent or recurrent URTIs
• Generalized lymphadenopathy
• Persistent or unexplained bone pain (additionally, consider X-ray)
• Unexplained bruising
0 If the FBC and blood film indicate leukaemia, admit or make a referral
for the child to be assessed by a paediatrician the same day.
Consider referralN When there is persistent parental anxiety, even
when a benign cause is considered most likely.

Neuroblastoma Tumour derived from neural crest tissue. 90

cases/y are reported in Great Britain—6% of all paediatric tumours.
Neuroblastoma tends to affect children <4y old (50% <2y; 90% <9y). Sites:
adrenal medulla—50%; abdominal sympathetic ganglia—25%; chest—20%;
pelvis—5%; neck—5%.

Presentation Variable and often non-specific—depends on site of the
tumour and extent of metastases. 7½ present with metastatic disease.
• General effects Pallor, fever, anorexia and weight d, failure to thrive,
diarrhoea, irritability, flushing, ataxia
• Local effects of tumour Abdominal mass (or thoracic mass on CXR);
local spread may cause paraplegia or cauda equina syndrome. Infants
<6mo may have rapidly progressive intra-abdominal disease
• Effects of metastases Lymphatic and haematogenous spread,
particularly to liver, lungs, and bone, is common. Associated symptoms:
• Bone pain ± pathological fracture
• Breathlessness
• Periorbital bruising (looks like a black eye), proptosis, or Horner’s
syndrome
• Firm skin nodules (usually babies—‘blueberry muffin appearance’)
Investigate with a FBC If persistent or unexplained bone pain (X-ray is
also needed); pallor or fatigue; unexplained irritability; unexplained fever;
persistent or recurrent URTI; generalized lymphadenopathy; and/or
unexplained bruising.
If neuroblastoma is suspected Carry out an abdominal examination (and/or
urgent USS), and consider CXR and FBC. If any mass is found, refer urgently.
Specialist management Treatment is with surgery, chemotherapy, and/or
radiotherapy. Early stage disease has a 95% 5y survival; late stage disease
has 20% 5y survival. Children with extra-abdominal tumours and those
who are <1y at diagnosis have better prognosis.

Wilms’ nephroblastoma 80 cases/y in Great Britain. Kidney tumour

composed of primitive renal tissue; L > R; bilateral in 10%. Usually affects
children <5y old (peak age: 2–3y). 4 > 5. 10% occur in children with rare
syndromes, e.g. Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome, aniridia, or hemihypertrophy. A few cases are familial.
Presentation
• General effects Fever, anorexia and weight d, anaemia
• Local effects of tumour Unilateral abdominal mass ± pain ±
unexplained haematuria
• Effects of metastases 10% have metastases to liver, lungs, or bone
(rare) at presentation. May present with symptoms/signs of metastases

Specific childhood cancers

Management If a child presents with abdominal distension, examine
the abdomen. Refer if: intrabdominal mass (immediate) or unexplained
haematuria (urgent). Treatment is with surgery ± chemotherapy ±
radiotherapy. 5y survival is 85% (higher for early stage tumours).
Retinoblastoma Rare tumour of the eye. 40 cases/y in Great Britain.
40% are <1y old at diagnosis; 95% are <5y old. May be familial (10%—
dominant inheritance) when the tumour is usually bilateral; genetic testing
is available. May be detected as a white pupillary reflex seen at developmental screening. Alternatively may present with squint or inflammation
of the eye. Refer suspected cases to ophthalmology urgently.
Specialist treatment Depends on size and location of tumour, whether
unilateral or bilateral, and whether family history. Options include
thermotherapy, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, or surgery. 5y survival is 99%.
Ongoing care When a diagnosis of cancer is made, most children
embark on an intensive regime of treatment. They are referred to tertiary
paediatric oncology units that share care with local hospitals and have
direct access to advice/admission via those units. Outreach nurses provide
support in the community (e.g. administration of IV drugs via Hickman
lines) to maintain as normal a lifestyle as possible.
• Immunosuppression can be a major problem. Any febrile episode
in a neutropenic child requires immediate referral to a specialist unit.
Chickenpox can be particularly serious—seek specialist advice from the
treating unit if the patient is in contact with any other child with chickenpox.

The GP’s role Treatment for childhood cancer is increasingly successful
with cure rates of >80% for many forms of cancer. The role of the GP is
important even if it is peripheral. Keep in touch with the family and up to
date with what is going on. Provide support to the child and other family
members. Give advice on benefits or local services that might be useful.
Ensure prescriptions are supplied promptly.
Palliative care Sadly, despite treatment, some children progress to the
terminal stages of their cancer. General principles of palliative care apply
(b pp. 1028–47) but the emotional traumas are often much greater. If
possible engage specialist palliative care services early. Try to maintain
continuity of care with as few professionals involved as possible. Provide
ongoing support to family members after the child has died.

Child health

Behaviour problems
GPs are commonly asked to ‘sort out’ behaviour problems of children by
parents at their wits’ ends. 2–10% of all children are said to have behaviour
problems depending on how problems are defined and measured.
Differentiation between normal behaviour and behavioural problems can
be difficult—especially if you do not know the child or family well. A significant problem is more likely:
• When the behaviour is frequent and chronic
• When >1 problem behaviour occurs, and
• If behaviour interferes with social and cognitive functioning
There is no right or wrong way to deal with these problems and the
approach outlined in Figure 24.4 is just one way to tackle them.

Managing the problem For simple problems, parental education,

reassurance, and a few specific suggestions tailored to the situation are
often sufficient. Follow-up is important to ensure that the problem is
resolving. If simple measures are not succeeding within 3–4mo, consider
referral to other agencies, e.g. health visitor, school nurse, child and
adolescent mental health team. Specific behavioural techniques include:
Behaviour modification Behaviour modification is a learning process
requiring care givers to set consistent rules and limits. Parents should try
to minimize anger when enforcing rules and i +ve contact with the child.
Discipline Ineffective discipline may result in inappropriate behaviour.
Scolding or physical punishment may briefly control a child’s behaviour
if used sparingly but may d the child’s sense of security and self-esteem.
Threats to leave or send the child away are damaging. Options:
• +ve reinforcement for appropriate behaviour This is a powerful tool
for controlling a child’s behaviour with no adverse effects
• Time-out procedure The child must sit alone in a dull place for a
brief period. Time-outs are a learning process for the child and are
best used for controlling a single inappropriate behaviour or a few at
one time
Breaking vicious circle patterns The child’s behaviour (be it normal for
that developmental stage or abnormal) evokes a response in the parent
or carer which provokes the child to behave in that manner further—
thus generating another response from the parent. Try to identify vicious
circle patterns and suggest alternative parental responses which make the
behaviour futile.

Does the child have a physical
deformity?
Does the child have any learning
difficulty?
What is the child’s normal
temperament like?
Were there any problems in
pregnancy or the neonatal period?

and talk?
Does the child have any feeding
or sleeping difficulties?
Is the child clingy?
Does the child cry excessively?

Child health

Excessive crying Babies vary considerably in the amount they cry and
ease with which they are soothed. Likewise parents vary in their ability to
tolerate a crying baby. Babies cry for many reasons—discomfort, hunger,
loneliness, separation, boredom, etc. If a baby is crying excessively:
• Take a history from the parent—when does the baby cry, can he/she
be consoled, what do the parents do when the baby cries
•	Examine fully from head to toe to exclude causes of discomfort, e.g.
nappy rash, otitis media, eczema
• Check the baby is growing along his/her centile line
• Consider family stress (including postnatal depression—b p. 839) as a
reason why the parent cannot tolerate the crying
• Treat any underlying cause found and support the family. Information
about behavioural techniques used to manage babies that cry excessively
is available from Cry-sis F 08451 228 669 M www.cry-sis.org.uk
Feeding problems b p. 872
Rhythmic behaviour Head rocking or banging, thumb sucking,
self-stimulation, baby behaviour, and many other variants all occur during
normal development. They usually appear if the child is tired, uncertain, or
anxious. Reassure parents. Most resolve spontaneously.
Fears and phobias
Fears
• Fears of the dark, monsters, and spiders are common in 3–4y olds
• Fears of injury and death are more common in older children
• Statements made by the parents in anger or jest may be taken literally
by preschool children and can be disturbing
• Frightening stories, films, or TV programmes may be upsetting and
intensify fears
Phobias Phobias cause persistent, unrealistic, yet intense anxiety in
reaction to external situations or stimuli.
Management Normal developmental stage-related fears must be
differentiated from true phobias. If the phobia is intense and interferes with
the child’s activity, or if the child does not respond to simple reassurance,
refer to the child and adolescent mental health team.

School refusal and truancy
Children <10y Younger children may refuse to go to school or recurrently
complain of abdominal pain, nausea, or other symptoms that justify staying
home. Usually school refusal is a form of separation anxiety, although
occasionally it is due to a problem at school, e.g. problems interacting with
the teacher or friends or bullying. Advise parents to consult the school—a
star chart with a star from the teacher for each morning the child goes to
school without a fuss may help. Relapses can occur if the child is absent
or after holidays.
Older children School refusal is a more difficult problem. Speak to
parents and child together and separately. Try to ascertain if there is a
genuine reason why the child avoids school. Liaise with the school. If not
succeeding, refer to the child and adolescent mental health team.

Behaviour problems

Conduct disorders Poor behavior, e.g. aggression, destructive
tendencies, and antisocial behaviour are common complaints. Tolerance
varies from family to family. Try simple strategies such as rewarding good
behaviour and ignoring poor behaviour ± ‘time-out’ strategies (younger
children—b p. 911). If not succeeding, refer to the child and adolescent
mental health team.
Childhood depression b p. 921
Hyperactivity b p. 916
Tics Sudden, rapid, repetitive non-rhythmic motor movements of no
apparent purpose. Commonly involve facial grimacing, head movements or
shoulder movements. Average age of onset 85y. Tics are present at some
point in 74% of children. Often a family history is present. Tics come and go
and vary in intensity and frequency. They are often precipitated by stress.
Most disappear during adolescence but in 20% they persist into adulthood.
Gilles de la Tourette syndrome 4:5 83:1. Characterized by
multiple motor tics and irrepressible verbal outbursts—sometimes
obscene. There may also be repetitive blinking, nodding, gesturing, echoing
of speech, and/or stuttering. Usually begins in childhood. Associated with
obsessive–compulsive disorder and ADHD. Probable genetic aetiology.
Management Spontaneous remissions do occur. Clonidine or antipsychotic
medication may help if severely affected (usually specialist initiated). Treat any
associated obsessive–compulsive disorder (b p. 996) or ADHD (b p. 917).
G. Gilles de la Tourette (1857–1904)—French neurologist.

• Behavioural problems and maltreatmentN Consider maltreatment (b p. 924) if there is behavioural change inconsistent with
age/development that is not explained by a medical condition (e.g.
ADHD, autism) or stressful situation (e.g. parental separation). In particular, suspect maltreatment if:
• A child repeatedly scavenges, steals, hoards, or hides food, or
• There is precocious or coercive sexualized behaviour
Refugee children Many child refugees have traumatic backgrounds.
Approach children with sensitivity and consider involving specialist child
mental health and specialist refugee support services early.

chapter 24

Child health

Sleep problems
Sleeping patterns and habits of children vary considerably and should only
be regarded as problems when they are presented as such by the family.
First, take a careful history. Ask about:
• Medical problems, e.g. night cough related to asthma, itching from
eczema, obstructive sleep apnoea. Treat appropriately
• Physical problems, e.g. hunger or cold
• Night terrors
• The sleep pattern—usually �1 of:
• Difficulty settling
• Waking during the night
• Waking early in the morning
• The amount of daytime sleep

General advice In all cases it is helpful to recommend a regular calming
bedtime routine (e.g. bath, story, cuddle, bed) and minimal fuss when a
child does wake at night, e.g. try to settle back to sleep without taking out
of cot, not rewarding waking with games, snacks, etc.
Resistance to going to bed The baby/child who cries incessantly when
put to bed is a common problem with a peak age of 1–2y. The child cries
when left alone or climbs out of bed and seeks the parents. Causes include:
• Separation anxiety
• Increasing attempts by the child to control his/her environment
• Long naps late in the afternoon
•	Rough, overstimulating play before bedtime
• A disturbed parent–child relationship and/or tension in the home
Management Letting the child stay up, staying in the room and comforting
the child or punishing the child are all ineffective. Options include:
• Leaving the child to cry This often does work and the crying
diminishes after a few nights but it is very hard for parents to do and
can be impossible if they are in shared accommodation
• Controlled crying The child is left to cry for a set length of time, e.g.
2–10min, before the parent returns to settle him/her again with minimum
fuss and then leaves. Length of time before returning is gradually i. Easier
for parents than leaving the child to cry and still effective
• Staying with the child until he/she sleeps but gradually withdrawing
proximity, e.g. sit on bed with child, after a few nights sit next to bed,
then nearer door, etc. until the child learns to go to sleep alone; this
method is gentler than the above but may take longer

Waking during the night Occurs in half of all children aged 6–12mo

and is related to separation anxiety. In older children, episodes often follow a stressful event (e.g. moving home, illness).
Management Allowing the child to sleep with the parents, playing,
feeding, or punishing the child usually prolong the problem.
• Try the methods used for resistance to going to bed—but advise
parents to always check to see that the child is not ill/needing a clean
nappy, etc. before being left to cry

Sleep problems

• Scheduled waking where a child is woken 15–60min before the time
he/she usually wakes and then resettled has also been shown to
improve night waking
• If a child wakes early, another strategy is to make toys or books
accessible. The child may then amuse him-/herself for a period of time
without disturbing his/her parents. Some 2–3y olds wander around
without waking the parents—fitting a stair gate across the child’s
bedroom door prevents the child coming to any harm doing this
• Use of sedatives, e.g. promethazine (for children >2y), is often
discouraged but can be useful particularly when parents feel desperate.
Only use as a short-term measure

Nightmares Occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.

Nightmares can be caused by frightening experiences (e.g. scary stories,
television violence), particularly in 3–4y olds. The child usually becomes
fully awake and can vividly recall the details of the nightmare. An
occasional nightmare is normal, but persistent or frequent nightmares
warrant evaluation by an expert.

Sleepwalking (somnambulism) Involves walking clumsily, usually
avoiding objects. The child appears confused but not frightened. 15% of
children aged 5–12y have sleepwalked one or more times. It is most common
amongst school-aged boys and may be triggered by a stressful event.
• Advise parents/carers not to try to wake the child
• If the child is in danger, gently steer him/her away from any harm
• If the child sleepwalks frequently, consider taking action to prevent
the child coming to any harm whilst sleepwalking, e.g. stair gate across
bedroom door
• If the sleepwalks occur repeatedly at the same time, waking the child
715min before the predicted time can break the cycle
Night terror Sudden awakening with inconsolable panic and screaming.
Usually occurs in the first 1–3h of sleep. Episodes last seconds l minutes.
Features:
• Blank or confused stares
• Incomplete arousal with poor responsiveness to people
• Amnesia for the episode

Night terrors are most common in children aged 3–8y and require no
treatment apart from simple reassurance. Advise parents not to wake the
child as this i the disturbance. If frequent consider waking the child before
episodes occur and keeping the child awake for a few minutes to break
the cycle. If the terrors persist beyond 8y, consider a diagnosis of temporal
lobe epilepsy.

Child health

Toilet training
Most children can do without nappies by day from 2–3y and by night from
2–5y. How to approach toilet training will vary from child to child.

General rules
• Wait until the child is ready This usually means that the child can
indicate to the parent that he/she is going to the toilet and has shown
an interest in using the potty or toilet. It is helpful to have a potty or
child’s toilet seat to put on the normal toilet for the child to become
familiar with before starting toilet training
• Pick a good time When the child can have a few days at home
without nappies in an environment where accidents do not matter.
Make sure the child has plenty of spare clothes available
• Keep the potty handy or stay within easy reach of the toilet If a
child says he/she wishes to go, sit the child immediately on the toilet.
Reward any result with praise. Do not punish the child for accidents—
advise the parent to ask the child to help clear up any mess and
reinforce that it would be better to use the potty/toilet next time
• Until the child (and parent) are confident in the child’s ability to
use the toilet continue using nappies when out and at night. Take
the child to the toilet at night before bedtime. When dry nappies are
consistently noted in the mornings, try the child without nappies at
night—a plastic sheet on the mattress is a good idea. Even when a
child has been dry day and night for some time, accidents are common
if the child is tired, unwell, or unsettled (whether excited or unhappy)
0 If the child does not succeed within a few days, either try training pants
or revert to nappies and try again at a later date.

Nocturnal enuresisN Involuntary voiding of urine during sleep on >2

nights/wk. Affects 8% of children aged 4½y and 1.5% at 9y. 4 > 5. Tends
to run in families. Distressing for child and parents with effects on emotional and social well-being. Cause is not fully understood:
• 1–2% have an underlying physical abnormality—usually UTI,
constipation, or DM (rarely congenital anomalies, diabetes insipidus, or
pelvic mass). Exclude with history and examination—consider urinalysis
if recent onset, daytime symptoms, or symptoms/signs of ill health
• Occasionally caused by emotional distress or recent illness—consider
if the child has been dry for 6mo prior to onset. Explore possible
triggers that may need treating. Consider maltreatment, particularly
if parents blame/punish the child despite advice that it is not the
child’s fault
Management See Table 24.13. Often resolves with time.

Method

Features

Advice and
information

Reassure parents and children that enuresis is not the
child’s fault. In particular, advise:
• That punitive measures should not be taken
• On ways to limit the impact of bedwetting, e.g. bed
protection
• On regular toileting 4–7x/d and before bed
• On appropriate fluid intake (1–1.4L/d in a child aged 4–8y)
• To avoid caffeine
• About self-help organizations/sources of support,
e.g. ERIC

Reward systems

For example, star chart
Use for agreed behaviour (e.g. going to the toilet before
bed) rather than a dry night

Lifting and
waking

Useful short-term measure but will not promote
long-term dryness. However, young people who have
not responded to treatment may find self-waking with an
alarm clock useful

Enuresis alarms
Refer to school
nurse or paediatric
enuresis clinic

An alarm is triggered to wake the child when urine makes
contact with a sensor. With time the child wakes in
response to bladder contractions rather than the alarm
First-line treatment when advice/rewards fail. Usually
some effect in <4wk but may take months until the child is
completely dry at night. Continue until 2wk of dry nights—
restart if relapse

Desmopressin
Usually specialist
initiated

Synthetic version of antidiuretic hormone. Taken at night
Side effects include headache, nausea, nasal congestion,
nosebleed, sore throat, cough, flushing, and mild
abdominal cramps
0 There is a risk of water overload—advise only one
mug of fluid from 1h before desmopressin dose to 8h
afterwards
Used when alarm is unsuccessful or unsuitable or in
combination with an alarm. If effective continue for 3mo,
then withdraw to assess whether still needed

Anticholinergics/
imipramine

Specialist initiation only for children who have not
responded to other treatments

Encopresis Most children are continent of faeces by 2½–3y. Faecal soiling after this age usually occurs during the day. If:
• Bowel control, but the child passes stool in unacceptable places, the
cause is usually emotional. Expert help from child and adolescent mental
health services is needed—refer. Consider maltreatment (b p. 924)
• A firm stool is passed occasionally in the toilet but usually in the pants,
developmental delay (either mental or social) is likely. Try a firm,
consistent training programme
• Soft stool oozes out, causing constant soiling, consider overflow
incontinence secondary to constipation (b p. 888)

chapter 24

Child health

Poor progress at school
720% of school-aged children require special educational services at some
point in their schooling. 4: 5 85:1. Consider:
• Is a child’s physical illness affecting school work, e.g. asthma, eczema?
• Is medication affecting academic performance (e.g. anticonvulsants)?
• Is the family stable or is there family upset?
• Does another family member have a chronic/life-threatening illness?
• Is the child’s home environment conducive to doing school work?
• Is this school refusal?
• Is the child happy at school?
• Is there a problem with vision or hearing?
• Is the child of normal intelligence?
• Does the child interact socially with adults and other children?
•	Have developmental milestones been met?
• Does the child have specific difficulty with certain aspects of his school
work, e.g. mathematics, reading, writing?
Severe learning difficulty b p. 919

Specific learning disorders
Dyslexia and dyscalculia Difficulty in information learning/processing.
Intelligence is often normal/high and the child appears bright and alert.
There may be a family history.
• Dyslexia Difficulty with letters/words, resulting in problems with reading,
writing, and spelling. Affects up to 10% of the population. 4 > 5
• Dyscalculia The core problem is difficulty handling numbers and
mathematical concepts. Less common than dyslexia
There is considerable overlap between dyslexia, dyscalculia, and also dyspraxia. If suspected liaise with the child’s school. Formal testing by an educational psychologist can confirm the diagnosis. Specialized educational
assistance and support are helpful.
Dyspraxia (developmental coordination disorder) Difficulty affecting
movement/coordination. Affects 2–6% of the population; 4 > 5
Intelligence is often normal/high. Features are variable but include:
• Confusion about which
• Clumsiness
hand to use
• Poor posture
• Difficulties throwing/
• Awkward gait
catching balls
•	Reading and writing difficulties
• Difficulty holding a pen or pencil • Poor sense of direction
• Difficulty hopping, skipping, and/
properly
or riding a bike
• Poor short-term memory
• Slow to learn to dress and feed
• Poor body awareness
Diagnosis involves specialist community paediatric multidisciplinary assessment. Treatment is supportive.
Speech and language delay b p. 857
Hyperactivity Difficult to define as claims a child is hyperactive often
reflect the tolerance level of the person complaining. Active children with
shorter-than-average attention spans create management problems.

Poor progress at school

Hyperactivity may have an underlying cause (e.g. an emotional disorder,
CNS dysfunction, a genetic component) or may be an exaggeration of
normal temperament. Often it is stage-related—support until that stage
has passed. Simple behaviour management techniques help (b p. 908).

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)N
• Common neurodevelopmental disorder interfering with normal social
functioning, learning, and development
• Aetiology is probably multifactorial with overstimulation, family
environment, and genetic factors all contributing
• Affects up to 9% of the school age population in the UK; 4:58 6:1
• Other emotional, behavioural, and learning problems may coexist
• Long-term ADHD is associated with low academic achievement,
substance misuse, unemployment, and antisocial tendencies
Presentation 0 Many of these behaviours are seen in normal children.
• Inattention Poor attention to detail and organization of tasks; appears
not to listen; easily distracted; forgetful; lack of concentration
• Impulsivity Lack of social awareness; shouts out answers to questions;
difficulty waiting (unable to take turns or wait in a queue); excessive
talking—interrupts others; lack of social awareness
• Hyperactivity Fidgets; inappropriate running/climbing/leaving seat
Assess duration of symptoms, how much functioning is impaired, and
whether problems occur in different settings/areas of functioning—a
report from school can be useful. 0 Diagnosis of ADHD should only be
made by a specialist.
Differential diagnosis
• Psychological problems
• Learning disability • Autistic disorder
(depression, emotional
•	Hearing problems • Thyroid disease
trauma, e.g. divorce)
• Drug ingestion
•	Epilepsy
Management
• Mild/moderate impairment Watchful waiting to see if problems
persist, or refer for parent training/education
• Persistent problems/severe impairment Refer to community
paediatrics or the child and adolescent mental health team for formal
diagnosis. Specialist treatment includes behavioural therapy ± drug
therapy (e.g. methylphenidate)
• In all cases Self-help and local support groups can be helpful

Child health

Autism and severe learning difficulty
Autistic spectrum disordersN Impair social interaction and
communication and affect 71% of the population; 4 > 5 (84:1). Risk factors:
• Family history (including family history of psychosis)
• Premature birth (<35wk)
• Valproate in pregnancy
• CNS malfunction/dysfunction
• Intellectual disability
• Genetic disorders, e.g. Down’s syndrome, fragile X, tuberous sclerosis,
muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis
Features of autism Triad of features present in the first 3y of life and not
attributable to another disorder (e.g. language delay):
• Impaired reciprocal social interaction (A symptoms)
• Impaired imagination associated with abnormal verbal and non-verbal
communication (B symptoms)
•	Restricted repertoires of activities and interests (C symptoms)
Features of Asperger’s syndrome Impaired reciprocal interaction and
stereotyped behaviour but without delay in speech or cognitive development.
Better prognosis than autism.
Diagnosis Not apparent at birth; usually detected from 18mo–3y when
failure of social interaction and lack of speech becomes apparent.
Asperger’s syndrome may present later. GPs play a vital role in detection.
Consider the possibility of autistic spectrum disorder if concerns about
development/behaviour are raised—but be aware of other explanations.
Look for specific abnormalities of:
• Spoken language, e.g. d/absent, monotone, repetitive, only about own
interests, rude/inappropriate, one way rather than conversation
• Responding to others, e.g. d responsiveness, misunderstanding of
others’ intentions, –ve response to requests of others
• Interacting with others, e.g. d awareness or d tolerance of others
entering personal space, plays alone, unaware of socially expected
behaviour, difficulty making friends, lack of enjoyment
• Eye contact/gestures, e.g. d eye contact, inappropriate/absent
gestures/facial expressions
• Ideas and imagination, e.g. lack of imagination/creativity, failure to
appreciate social niceties
• Unusual or restricted interests, e.g. dislike of change, over-reaction
to stimuli, lack of flexibility, overfocussed/unusual interests
• Rigid and repetitive behaviours, e.g. repetitive stereotyped
movements/play, strict adherence to rules
• Other features, e.g. unusual profile of skills/deficits, immature social/
emotional skills, lack of common sense, excessive trust
Refer to or discuss with the local autism or community paediatric team
if there are concerns. 0 Diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder should
only be made by a specialist.
Checklists (e.g. the Checklist for Autism in Toddlers or CHAT—M www.nas.
org.uk) may be useful to assess toddlers with problems with social interaction
or language delay but should not be used to make or exclude a diagnosis.

Autism and severe learning difficulty

Management Life-long conditions; often severely disabling requiring a lot
of support from community services. Most interventions are behavioural
and delivered in an educational setting. Medication may be used for
specific issues, e.g melatonin for sleep problems. Be approachable, willing
to listen, and an advocate for the family. Give information about self help
and signpost to support organizations and benefits (b p. 922).

Severe learning difficulty (mental handicap) May exist alone or

with other disabilities. Often noted by a parent first—take any concerns
seriously. Causes are varied—many are rare. Divide into:
• Congenital Genetic (e.g. Down’s syndrome, fragile X); metabolic
(e.g. congenital hypothyroidism); others (e.g. rubella in pregnancy)
• Acquired, e.g. trauma, meningitis, birth injury
Outlook
• IQ 50–70 80% of people with learning disability. Most lead an
independent life and require just special attention to their schooling
• IQ 35–49 Special schooling or extra support within mainstream
schooling, and supervision may be needed
• IQ <35—severe learning difficulty. Limited social activity and speech
may be impaired. Special schooling and medical services are needed
Management Refer to paediatrics/genetics to ensure no treatable cause
is missed. Then:
• Communicate with carers Explain referrals; test results and their
implications; the local system and who is responsible for what. Find
out about the condition (as far as possible) and tell the carers where
to get more information. Ensure carers receive information about
benefits and housing/schooling options available
• Refer to other community services, e.g. paediatrician; severe learning
disability service. Ensure follow-up happens and assist with assessment
of special needs for schooling, housing, and employment. Provide
ongoing prescriptions where appropriate
• Manage medical problems not related to disability
• Promote concordance With long-term therapy ± education or
rehabilitation programmes
• Reproduction Offer family planning, pre-conceptual counselling, and/
or antenatal diagnosis for parents and patients with severe learning
difficulty reaching reproductive age

Child health

Adolescence
Changes of adolescence start gradually—from 710y for girls and 712y for
boys—and are complete by the age of 717y. Adolescence is characterized
by rapid physical development and emotional change. Adjusting to these
changes causes problems:
• Concerns about appearance Some become very concerned about
their appearance. They need reassurance, especially if not growing or
maturing as quickly as their friends
• Clothes/style Are important to express solidarity with friends and
declare independence
• Hormonal changes Lead to body shape, voice, hair, and skin changes,
body hair growth, and menstruation. Adjustment can be difficult
• Acne May need treatment—especially if scarring
• Dieting and consumption of junk food Are common. Rarely, eating
disorders develop

Consent b p. 52

Confidentiality b p. 50

School problems
• School refusal b p. 910
• Truancy Usually children who are unhappy at home and frustrated at
school. They spend their days with others who feel the same
• Poor school work Emotional problems, e.g. worry about problems at
home, often affect school work and make it difficult to concentrate;
pressure to do well/pass exams may be counterproductive. Exams are
important, but advise parents not to let them dominate life or cause
unhappiness

Maltreatment b p. 924
Behaviour problems It is normal for teenagers and their parents to
complain about each other’s behaviour and disagree frequently. Parents
often feel they have lost control over their child. Adolescents resent
parental restrictions on their freedom—but still want parental guidance.
Advise parents to lay down sensible ground rules and stick to them.
Evidence suggests children are at greater risk of getting into trouble if
their parents do not know where they are—advise teenagers to let their
parents know where they are going and parents to ask.
Sexual problems and contraception b p. 768
Trouble with the law 4 > 5. Most young people do not break the
law—when they do, it usually only happens once. Repeated offending may
reflect family culture or may result from unhappiness—always ask about
emotional feelings when an adolescent is repeatedly getting into trouble.

Drugs, solvents, and alcohol Most teenagers never use drugs
or inhale solvents, and of those that do, most never get beyond the
experimenting stage. Alcohol is the most common drug causing problems
for adolescents but consider the possibility of any form of drug use
(b p. 188) when parents notice serious, sudden changes in behaviour.

Adolescence

Emotional problems Teenage unhappiness is common and does
not necessarily indicate depression (7½ 14y olds feel miserable; ¼ are
self-deprecatory; 8% have suicidal thoughts). However, emotional disorders
are often not recognized, even by family and friends. Over-eating, excessive
sleepiness, promiscuity, and a persistent over-concern with appearance may be
signs of emotional distress. More obviously, phobias and panic attacks appear.
Rarely, changes in behaviour and mood can mark the beginning of more
serious mental health disorders. Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as
well as more common disorders such as anxiety, may emerge during adolescent years. Refer for mental health assessment if concerned.
Distinguishing normal adolescent behaviour from mental illness Teenage
behavioural problems may be signs of mental illness if:
• They go on for more than a few weeks
• They do not vary, e.g. persistently low mood in all circumstances
• They are severe, e.g. self-harming behaviour, violence
• There is a significant impact on relationships, school performance, and/
or usual activities

Childhood depressionN Response to childhood stress. Distinguish
from depressive symptoms occurring as part of other emotional or conduct disorders. Most common in adolescence (5 > 4).
Diagnosis Difficult, especially among adolescents. Adolescents often do
not communicate well with their parents and have little contact with
health professionals—resulting in late diagnosis.
Presenting features
• Unhappiness and/or tearfulness, apathy, boredom, d ability to enjoy life
• Antisocial behaviour—4 > 5—especially after bereavement
• d school performance—may admit to poor concentration
• Separation anxiety reappearing in adolescence
• Frequent unexplained illness or undue worries about health
• Self-harm
• Bipolar depressive disorder is rare before puberty, and mania must be
present to make a diagnosis
Management Unless a mild episode related to a single precipitating
event and no other risk factors for depression, refer for specialist advice.
Specialist treatment includes counselling, family therapy, CBT, and drug
therapy (0 With the exception of fluoxetine, risks of treatment with
SSRIs outweigh benefits in children).

Child health

The chronically disabled child
Chronic disability due to a wide variety of causes affects 710% of children
in the UK.

Effects on the child Vary from child to child, depending on the nature
of the disability, personality of the child, and support the child has at home
and in the community. Common problems include:
• Physical discomfort—both due to the disability and to painful or
embarrassing treatments
• Alterations in the normal pattern of growth and development and/or
physical differences may lead to social isolation and d motivation
• Frequent hospitalizations and outpatient visits prevent the child
integrating into school or ongoing community activities
• Dependence—the disability may prevent the child reaching his/her
own goals and achieving his/her own independence. Many children also
realize the additional burden they cause their parents and carers
Effects on the family Vary from family to family depending on financial
and/or social support, relationship between parents and other siblings, and
many other factors. Stress may cause family break-up, especially when
other marital and intra-family problems exist. Common problems:
• Grieving for the loss of the ‘ideal child’—conditions that affect the
appearance of the child particularly affect attachment between parents
and child. The grief might take the form of shock, denial, anger,
sadness, depression, guilt, or anxiety and may occur any time in the
child’s development
• Neglected siblings
• Inconsistent discipline—due to demands placed on the family and
sympathy for the child—resulting in behaviour problems
• Marginalization of one parent—one parent tends to take on the bulk
of the caring activities. There is a danger the other parent starts to feel
inadequate and isolated with respect to the care of the child
• Major expense and time commitment—frequently one parent has to
give up work to look after a disabled child resulting not only in loss of
income, but loss of that parent’s independence and opportunities for
the future
• Social isolation
• Confusion over the health, benefits, and social services available
Care coordination Inconsistent policies and funding, inadequate
access to facilities (including physical barriers to access), and poor communication and coordination between the healthcare, educational, and
community support systems l misery for children with disability and their
families. Without coordination of services, care is crisis-oriented.
Care coordination requires knowledge about the child’s condition, the family, and the community in which they function. In all cases someone should
be designated responsible for coordinating care—the best person to do
that will vary according to circumstances. Regardless of who assists in coordination of services, the family and child must be partners in the process.

The chronically disabled child

Rehabilitation The general principles of rehabilitation for adult patients
apply to children too—b p. 204 and p. 282
Role of the GP
• The GP of any patient with a chronic illness in the community is a
team member and may be the key worker who coordinates care
• The GP provides continuity of care, particularly when the child is
under the care of several different secondary care teams, or during the
transition from child to adolescent or adult services
• Maintain an open door policy and encourage children and carers to
seek help for problems early
• Be flexible with appointments to avoid long waits and allow carers and
other family members to attend to their own health needs
• Try to become familiar with a child’s disease, even if it is rare. It is
impossible to plan care without knowledge of course and prognosis,
and an easy way to lose a child’s confidence if you appear ignorant of
their condition
• If progress is slower than expected or stalls, consider other medical
problems (e.g. anaemia, infection), behavioural problems, and
communication problems (e.g. poor vision/hearing)
•	Remember that children with disability are at i risk of maltreatment
and that symptoms/signs of maltreatment may be difficult to distinguish
from the effects of the child’s underlying problem
• Information alone can improve outcome

Child health

Safeguarding children
Children may be mistreated if harm is inflicted upon them or if a responsible person fails to prevent them from coming to harm. In the UK, there
are 750,500 children on child protection registers or the subject of child
protection plans. Classification—see Table 24.14.
Table 24.14 Classification of child abuse: >1 type may occur concurrently
PHYSICAL Hitting, shaking,
throwing, burning, suffocating,
poisoning, including fabricated or
induced illness

EMOTIONAL The child is made to feel
worthless, afraid, unloved, or inadequate.
Includes age-inappropriate expectations
and witnessing domestic violence

NEGLECT Failure to meet the
child’s basic needs (including
medical needs); allowing the child
to be exposed to danger

SEXUAL Forcing/enticing a child to
participate in sexual activities—physical
contact or production of pornographic
material

Circumcision of female children or forced marriage <16y
Both illegal in the UK. Children may be taken abroad to be circumcised/
married. If you suspect that this might be going to happen to any patient,
inform social services and/or the police immediately.

Risk factors 0 Any child may be a victim of maltreatment.
Parent/carer factors
• Mental illness/learning disability
• Substance/alcohol abuse
• Being abused themselves
• Ongoing physical illness
• Parental conflict/domestic
violence/divorce
• Unemployment/poor living
conditions

Child factors
•	History of sibling abuse
• Learning/behaviour/physical problems
• Unplanned pregnancy/
premature birth
• Poor attachment to parents/carers
•	Environment high in criticism
• ‘Looked after’ children (those under
the guardianship of the state, e.g.
those in local authority or foster care)

Presentation Always have a high index of suspicion.
Suspect maltreatment if
• The child discloses it
• Story is inconsistent with injuries (• bruising, bleeding, fractures, or
other injuries in children not independently mobile are suspicious)
• Characteristic injuries—marks consistent with cigarette burns; scalds
(especially if symmetrical or doughnut-shaped on buttocks); finger
mark or bite mark bruises; perineal bruising or anogenital injury; linear
marks consistent with whipping; buckle or belt marks
• Late presentation or lack of concern about injury/illness
• Behaviour of the child is suggestive, e.g. withdrawn, ‘frozen
watchfulness’, sexually precocious behaviour, abnormal interaction
between child and parents, unwilling to speak about the injury
• STI or pregnancy in any child <13y (consider if the child is older)
• The child is persistently smelly/dirty and/or inadequate home
environment (including food and hygiene)

Safeguarding children

Consider maltreatment within your differential diagnosis if
•	Encopresis, enuresis, or daytime incontinence of urine (b p. 914)
• Failure to thrive (b p. 872)
• Severe or persistent infestations (e.g. scabies, head lice), oral injuries,
or urinary/anogenital symptoms without adequate explanation
• Failure to attend healthcare appointments and/or poor concordance
with treatment plans for significant medical conditions
• Unusual/frequent presentation to healthcare professionals
• Injury as a result of inadequate supervision
• Behavioural problems (b p. 908)
• Inappropriate dress (e.g. underdressed in cold weather)

• Immediate actionN Do not ask leading questions.

• Listen and observe Record the history given, any report of
maltreatment, the child’s appearance and behaviour, any physical
signs, and interaction between the child and parent/carer
• Seek an explanation From the accompanying adult and (if possible)
the child. Record the explanations given. An inadequate explanation is
implausible, inadequate, inconsistent (over time or between the child
and parent/carer), or based on cultural practice (does not justify harm)
• Make a decision If child maltreatment is likely, a possibility or can be
excluded

Further action Welfare of the child is paramount.
Share your concerns and plans For further action with parents and child
unless you believe doing so will i risk to child. Record any discussions,
referrals, and actions taken.
If child maltreatment is a possibility Check the child’s/other family
members’ records for worrying features; consider asking other practice
members if they have concerns; and do �1 of the following:
• Seek further information from other agencies (e.g. school, social services) or
other health professionals (e.g. health visitor, specialists involved with care)
• Discuss concerns with a more experienced colleague, e.g. practice
safeguarding lead, locality named professional for safeguarding, or
senior paediatrician
• Arrange to review the child at a date appropriate to concern—
follow-up if the appointment is cancelled or is not kept
0 At any stage your level of concern may change and lead you to exclude
or suspect maltreatment.
If you suspect that child maltreatment is likely Refer to children’s social
care following local child protection procedures. Follow-up telephone
referrals in writing in <24h. Urgency of action taken depends on the
nature of the suspected maltreatment.
Responding to child protection enquiries Under Section 47 of
the Children Act (1989), GPs have a legal obligation to share relevant
information whether or not they have consent of the parents.

Child death
Sudden infant death syndrome (cot death) 71 in 2,000 babies/y
are found unexpectedly dead in the first year of life in the UK. These
deaths are most common in winter months and at night (midnight–9 a.m.).
An identifiable cause for the death can be found for 37%—the rest
remain unexplained (‘cot deaths’). Theories include cardiac arrhythmia and
apnoeic attacks. Peak age: 1–4mo; 4 > 5.
Risk factors for cot death
• Baby sleeping face down
• Smoking (mother and other
family members)
• Overheating
• Minor intercurrent illness

•
•
•
•

Twin or multiple pregnancy
Low birth weight
Social disadvantage
Young mother
Large numbers of siblings

Reducing the risk of cot death b p. 847
Management if you are the first person contacted
• Check an ambulance is on its way and go immediately to the scene.
Start resuscitation, unless clearly inappropriate. Continue until the
baby gets to hospital
• If it is clear the baby is dead and cannot be resuscitated, inform
the parents sympathetically. Contact the police/Coroner and the
designated paediatrician for unexpected death in childhood. Arrange
for the baby to be taken to A&E, not to a mortuary
• Take a brief history. Record the circumstances of death immediately (e.g.
position when found, bedding, vomit). Listen to the parents. Mention the
baby by name and do not be afraid to express your sorrow
• If the baby is a twin, the surviving twin is at i risk of cot death and
should be admitted to hospital for observation
Management if you learn that a baby has died
• Provide information as requested to the rapid response team, and
attend the initial case discussion if possible
• Consider taking part in the scene of death visit to support parents
Follow-up
•	Review within a few days. There may be some anger directed towards
you as often babies have been seen in general practice within a few
days or weeks of the death. Do not be defensive or become angry
• Discuss suppression of lactation if breastfeeding (b p. 842)
• Advise parents about likely grief reactions—guilt, anger, d appetite,
sleeplessness, hearing the baby cry. Do not forget siblings—they can
be deeply affected too. Continue regular review as long as needed and
wanted. Be sensitive to anniversaries. Watch for psychiatric illness
•	Ensure parents have received written information about cot death
including details of self-help organizations and helplines. Consider
referral for counselling—ideal timing for referral varies
•	Refer for specialist obstetric assessment early in the next pregnancy
and make sure parents are put in touch with the Care of Next Infant
(CONI) scheme. Discuss the use of apnoea alarms

Child death

Death of a child in other circumstances Death of a child is
always difficult. Accidents are the most common cause of death followed
by death from childhood cancer. Principles of management used for cot
death can be applied.
Child death review
• All deaths of children <18y (excluding stillbirths) are subject to review
by a local child death review panel and should be notified to it
• Unexpected deaths are investigated by a rapid response team,
involving police, a senior paediatrician, and other professionals as
appropriate
• This rapid response team notifies and gathers information from other
professionals involved with the child, including the GP, carries out an
initial case discussion, arranges a visit to the scene of death, and then
arranges post-mortem informed by the investigation
• Further case discussions take place following post-mortem. The GP
should be invited and sent a report. An appropriate professional is
identified to inform the parents of the findings
• The panel arranges support for the parents throughout this
procedure—regard this as additional to GP support

Apnoea alarms Commonly issued to or purchased by parents if they

are worried about the risk of cot death. An apnoea alarm cannot be useful
unless parents are taught basic life support to a proficient standard. An
alarm should not be supplied without this training. There is no evidence
that apnoea alarms prevent cot deaths.

Near-miss cot deaths Parents may rush a child to A&E or the GP

after an episode of pallor ± floppiness. Parents may have attempted
mouth-to-mouth resuscitation before the baby starts to respond to them,
or may have simply touched the baby or lifted the baby up and received a
response. Usually there are no residual symptoms or signs.
Management Difficult. Parents may have misinterpreted normal
irregularities in sleep or the child might be unwell and have a physical
cause for symptoms, e.g. early stages of a viral infection. Usually parents
are very anxious by the time you see the child. Take a careful history and
examine the child from top to toe. Treat any cause of symptoms found. Be
as reassuring as possible and play down anxieties.
• If the child has any risk factors for cot death, there is a clear history
of apnoea, the child comes from a difficult social background, or parents
are unable to cope following the episode—admit the child for observation and further assessment.

Ear, nose, and throat

The mouth
• Oral surgery referralN
Urgent referral To exclude malignancy, ALL:
• Mouth ulcers persisting for >3wk
• Lumps in the mouth persisting >3wk
•	Red or white patches in the mouth—including suspected lichen
planus—that are painful, swollen, or bleeding
0 For patients with persistent symptoms/signs related to the oral
­cavity, in whom a definitive diagnosis of a benign lesion cannot be
made, refer or follow up until the symptoms and signs disappear. If the
­symptoms/signs have not disappeared in ≤6wk, make an urgent referral.
Non-urgent referral Patients with unexplained red and/or white patches
of the oral mucosa that are not painful, swollen, or bleeding—including
suspected lichen planus.

Dry mouth Causes: anxiety, drugs or Sjögren’s syndrome. Look for
cause, and rectify if possible. Prescribe artificial saliva, e.g. Glandosane®.
Sore mouth Treat the cause. Consider:
• Hand, foot, and
• Side effects
• Oral thrush
mouth disease
of chemo- or
•	Aphthous ulcers
(child)
radiotherapy
• HSV
• Gingivitis
•	Anaemia
• Dry mouth
• Trauma (e.g. burn)
Mouth ulcers Treat the cause. Consider:
• Herpes zoster
•	Drugs, e.g.
•	Aphthous ulcers
• Vincent’s angina
steroids, gold
• Trauma, e.g. sharp
• Erythema multiforme
•	Reiter’s disease
tooth, false teeth
•	Self-inflicted,
•	Crohn’s disease/UC • Behçet’s disease
e.g. burns
• HSV
•	Coeliac disease
Leukoplakia Thick whitish, grey patch usually on the inside of the cheek,
the tongue, or gum. It is the mouth’s reaction to chronic irritation of the
mucous membranes. 4 > 5. Common in patients who smoke, patients
with ill-fitting dentures, and patients who habitually chew on their cheek.
Usually benign but may be an early sign of oral cancer. NICE recommends
referral to oral surgery to exclude malignancy in all casesN.
Erythroplakia Reddened area that results when the lining of the mouth
thins. The area appears red because the underlying capillaries are more
visible. Erythroplakia is a much more ominous predictor of oral cancer
than leukoplakia. NICE recommends referral to oral surgery to exclude
malignancy in all casesN.
Tongue problems
• Blue tongue Central cyanosis—b p. 232
• Dry and furred tongue Suggests dehydration
• Geographic tongue Irregular smoother redder patches that change
position over time on the dorsum of the tongue. Due to papillae loss.
Asymptomatic or causes soreness. Rarely due to vitamin B12 deficiency
• Large tongue Consider acromegaly, amyloidosis, myxoedema

The mouth

• Smooth tongue Iron, riboflavin, nicotinic acid, B12 or folate deficiency;
idiopathic—usually elderly; antibiotic use
• Sore tongue Glossitis of anaemia; Crohn’s disease; coeliac disease;
carcinoma of the tongue; psychogenic causes
• Strawberry tongue Yellowish white tongue coating with the dark red
papillae of the tongue projecting through. Associated with scarlet fever
although also present in Kawasaki’s disease
• Ulcer Assume any non-healing ulcer is due to carcinoma of the tongue
until proven otherwise. Refer for biopsy to an oral surgeon. Treatment
is with surgery or laser ablation ± radiotherapy
Halitosis Common after sleep. Short-term halitosis is associated with
acute illness, e.g. tonsillitis, appendicitis (foetor oris), gastroenteritis,
diabetic ketoacidosis.

Chronic halitosis Is usually caused by bacterial putrefaction of food
debris and dental plaque and is related to poor oral hygiene. Associated
with gingivitis 9 periodontitis. Smoking, alcohol, isosorbide dinitrate, and
disulfiram exacerbate the problem. Rarely caused by metabolic disorders,
e.g. trimethylaminuria (TMAU or fish odour syndrome).
Management Examine the mouth and recommend a dental check. Advise
oral hygiene, e.g. regular brushing of teeth/tongue, dental flossing; smoking
cessation; diet advice—avoid garlic, onions, curries; treat any local
infection, e.g. gingivitis; mouthwashes, e.g. 0.2% aqueous chlorhexidine
gluconate help d dental plaque. Refer if causing distress.
Aphthous ulcers Painful white ulcers. Common, affecting ~20%.
Usually idiopathic but may be associated with poor health, stress, Crohn’s,
coeliac, and Behçet’s disease. Most are short-lived. Large ulcers (up to 2cm
diameter) can take ~6wk to heal. Most resolve spontaneously. Topical
therapies are effective, e.g. hydrocortisone lozenges qds (dissolve in
contact with the ulcer). If ulcers are recurrent, check FBC, iron, and folate
levels. Refer any ulcer not significantly improving >3wk after presentation
to exclude malignancy, or if recurrent ulcers cause distress.
Oral cancer >6,200 new cases/y in the UK. Incidence is increasing.
Usually squamous cell carcinoma. 4 > 5. Major risk factors are smoking
and high alcohol consumption. Lip cancer has good prognosis (>90% 5y
survival), but overall survival is poor (51% 2y survival) mainly due to poor
public awareness/late presentation. Usually presents with leukoplakia
(white patch), erythroplakia (red patch), or non-healing ulcer (>3wk).
Management Refer suspicious lesions to oral surgery for biopsy.

Ear, nose, and throat

Dental and jaw problems
Gums
• Bleeding gums Consider periodontal disease (most common cause);
pregnancy; leukaemia, bleeding disorders; scurvy
• Hypertrophied gums Associated with phenytoin use
• Blue line Along the margin of the teeth—suggests lead poisoning
• Gum inflammation Gingivitis—consider immunodeficiency; vitamin C
deficiency; DM, leukaemia; drugs; e.g. phenytoin, nifedipine, ciclosporin
Vincent’s angina Pharyngeal infection with ulcerative gingivitis.
Management: penicillin V 250mg qds po + metronidazole 400mg tds po.
J.H. Vincent (1862–1950)—French bacteriologist.
Periodontal disease Disease of the periodontal ligament caused by
bacterial plaque and exacerbated by smoking and DM. Occurs in the
normal population >30y. Leads to gingivitis, dental abscesses, and tooth
loss. Encourage patients to register with a dentistN—regular dental care
helps prevent dental emergencies and periodontal disease. Patients
experiencing difficulty finding an NHS dentist should telephone their local
Primary Care Organization and ask to be found a dentist.
• Refer urgently to a dentist if unexplained tooth mobility for >3wkN.

Toothache Pain/excessive sensitivity to temperature may be a problem
with exposed dentine or pulp infection—advise to see a dentist.
Dental abscess Facial swelling and pain related to bacterial infection.
Refer to a dentist. Prescribe analgesia if there will be a delay.
Complications of tooth extraction
• Haemorrhage Apply pressure by placing wet gauze over socket and
get patient to bite hard for 15min—refer to dentist if not stopping
• Painful socket and bad taste in mouth Infection—refer to a dentist.
Give analgesia if delay is likely
Loss of tooth through trauma b p. 1108

Cleft lip and palate Incidence: 1:600 live births—half
have other abnormalities too (e.g. hypoplastic mandible).
Often—though not always—detected at routine antenatal
USS. The cleft may be unilateral or bilateral and involve lip
and/or palate. Cleft lips are usually repaired in the first few days of life;
cleft palates at 73mo depending on the weight of the baby.
Problems associated with cleft lip and/or palate
• Feeding difficulties with associated poor weight gain
•	Aspiration pneumonia
• Hearing problems—particularly glue ear. In some areas children
with cleft palate are routinely given grommets at 718mo. Treat otitis
media promptly. Audiology review is important
• Speech problems—refer for speech therapy
• Dental problems—universal with cleft palate. Orthodontic
treatment is always required

Dental and jaw problems

Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction Common disorder
affecting 770% of the population—only 5% seek treatment. Typically
presents in early adulthood. 4:5 8 1:4. Aetiology is complex—malocclusion
and trauma play a part and are exacerbated by psychogenic factors.
Assessment Take a careful history noting pain—duration, location, and
nature; precipitating/relieving factors; joint noises; restricted jaw function,
e.g. locking, poor bite; and non-specific symptoms, e.g. headache, earache,
and tinnitus. Examine the head and neck, including the TMJ and mandibular
movement. Exclude other disease. Do not X-ray as this yields little useful
information—CT/MRI may be ordered by specialists.
Patterns of disease There are 3 patterns of disease:
• Myofacial pain and dysfunction Due to clenching/teeth grinding. Pain
is usually worse in the morning. Stress, anxiety, and depression are key
features. Poor sleep is common. May have diffuse muscle tenderness
• Internal derangement The articular disc is in an abnormal position and
causes restriction of mandibular movement. Pain is usually continuous
and exacerbated by jaw movement
• Osteoarthrosis Degeneration of the joint seen on older patients.
Crepitus and sounds from the joint occur on jaw movement
Management Reassure and explain the benign nature of the disorder.
Suggest simple analgesia, e.g. paracetamol ± ibuprofen. Resting the jaw
and avoiding stress may help. Refer those with ongoing problems to oral
surgery.
Specialist treatment A bite appliance to wear at night helps 70%.
Physiotherapy, behavioural therapy, and exercises also help. Drug
treatments include NSAIDs, antidepressants, opioids, and muscle
relaxants. Surgery is occasionally necessary if medical treatment fails.

Ear, nose, and throat

Sore throat
Each GP sees ~120 patients with sore throat every year—mostly children
and young adults. 70% sore throats are viral in origin—the rest bacterial
(mostly Group A B-haemolytic streptococci).

Clinical picture Pain on swallowing; fever; headache; tonsillar exudates;

nausea and vomiting; and/or abdominal pain (especially in children due to
abdominal lymphadenopathy).
0 Viral and bacterial infections are indistinguishable clinically but association with coryza and cough may point to a viral aetiology.

Differential diagnosis Glandular fever especially in young adults, with

persistent sore throat.

Investigation Not usually undertaken.
• Throat swabs cannot distinguish commensal organisms from clinical
infection (40% carry Group A B-haemolytic streptococci), are
expensive and do not give instant results so are rarely used
•	Rapid antigen tests give immediate results but have low sensitivity
limiting usefulness

Management 90% recover in <1wk without treatment. Complications
are rare. Advise analgesia and antipyretics (e.g. paracetamol and/or
ibuprofen),i fluid intake, and salt water gargles.
Use of antibiotics Antibiotic prescription can probably be avoided in most
patients, but educating patients about the reasons for not prescribing is
vital to maintain a good doctor–patient relationship.
• Benefits Antibiotics give a modest benefit in symptom relief (8h less
symptoms) and may confer slight protection against some complications
(e.g. quinsy, otitis media). There is no evidence antibiotics protect
against rheumatic fever or acute glomerulonephritis
• Risks Possibility of side effects with antibiotic use; i in community
antibiotic resistance; ‘medicalizing’ a self-limiting condition—prescribing
i faith in antibiotics encouraging re-attendance with sore throat
Most patients should be given simple advice and/or a ‘delayed prescription’ (phenoxymethylpenicillin or erythromycin qds)—for patients to collect if no better in 2–3d (70% do not collect the script). Avoid amoxicillin
as this causes a rash in those with glandular fever.
Reasons to give antibiotics immediatelyN
•	Acute sore throat where ≥3 Centor criteria are present: tonsillar
exudate, tender anterior cervical lymphadenopathy/lymphadenitis,
history of fever, and absence of cough
•	Patient is systemically very unwell
• Symptoms and signs suggestive of serious illness and/or complications
(e.g. peritonsillar abscess, peritonsillar cellulitis)
• High risk of serious complications because of pre-existing co-morbidity,
e.g. significant heart, lung, renal, liver, or neuromuscular disease,
immunosuppression, cystic fibrosis, and young children born prematurely

Sore throat

Complications of sore throat All rare:
• Quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) Usually occurs in adults. Signs: unilateral
peritonsillar swelling, difficulty swallowing (even saliva), and trismus
(difficulty opening jaw). Refer for IV antibiotics 9 incision and drainage
• Retropharyngeal abscess Occurs in children. Signs: inability to
swallow, fever. Refer for IV antibiotics 9 incision and drainage
• Rheumatic fever b p. 276
• Glomerulonephritis b p. 442
Indications for referral to ENT
Urgent referral Any unexplained sore throat for >1moN.
Referral for tonsillectomyG
• Recurrent acute tonsillitis Young children have a lot of throat
infections, and most will ‘grow out’ of the problem without the need
for surgery. Tonsillectomy is only considered if children miss a lot of
school, e.g. >5 attacks/y for 2y causing school absence
• Airway obstruction Very large tonsils causing sleep apnoea
• Chronic tonsillitis >3mo + halitosis
• Recurrent quinsy
• Unilateral tonsillar enlargement To exclude malignancy.
• Tonsillectomy carries a small risk of severe haemorrhage. Readmit
any patient with bleeding post-operatively for observation.

Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) Consider in teenagers
or young adults presenting with sore throat lasting >1wk. Caused by Epstein–
Barr virus (EBV). Spread by droplet infection and direct contact (‘kissing
disease’) and has a 4–14d incubation period. Presents with sore throat,
malaise, fatigue, lymphadenopathy, enlarged spleen, palatal petechiae, and/
or rash (10–20%). Send blood for FBC (atypical lymphocytes) and glandular
fever antibodies (Monospot or Paul Bunnell).
Management Advise rest, fluids, and regular paracetamol, avoid alcohol.
Try salt water gargles or aspirin gargles (only if >16y). Consider a short
course of prednisolone for severe symptoms. Treat 2o infection with
antibiotics. Counsel re the possibility of prolonged symptoms (up to
several months). • Do not prescribe amoxicillin as it causes a rash.
Complications 2o infections; rash with amoxicillin; hepatitis; jaundice;
pneumonitis; neurological disturbances (rare).
Tonsillar tumour Most often elderly. Signs: unilateral tonsillar swelling,
dysphagia, sore throat, earache. Refer for excision biopsy.
• Refer any unexplained, sore throat present for >1mo for urgent ENT
assessmentN.

Ear, nose, and throat

Hoarseness and stridor
Hoarseness Change in quality of the voice affecting pitch, volume, or
resonance. Occurs when vocal cord function is affected by a change in the
cords, a neurological or muscular problem. Causes:
• Local causes URTI (most common); laryngitis; trauma (shouting,
coughing, vomiting, instrumentation); carcinoma; hypothyroidism;
acromegaly
• Neurological problems Laryngeal nerve palsy; motor neurone disease;
myasthenia gravis; multiple sclerosis
• Muscular problems Muscular dystrophy
• Functional problems
Assessment Weight d, dysphagia, or neck lumps add to suspicions of
malignancy. Check TFTs in those with weight gain. Indirect laryngoscopy
with a mirror can be difficult and give a poor view. ENT departments have
thin fibreoptic scopes for direct visualization in outpatients.
• Refer urgently for chest X-ray (CXR)N If hoarseness persisting
>3wk—particularly smokers >50y and heavy drinkers.
If there is a POSITIVE finding on CXR Refer urgently to a team specializing in the management of lung cancer.
If there is a NEGATIVE finding on CXR Refer urgently to a team
­specializing in the management of head and neck cancer.

Laryngitis Hoarseness, malaise 9 fever and/or pain on using voice.

Usually viral and self-limiting (1–2wk) but occasionally 2o bacterial
infection occurs.
Management Advise patients to rest voice, take OTC analgesia, e.g.
paracetamol and/or ibuprofen, try steam inhalations. Consider antibiotics
if bacterial infection is suspected (e.g. phenoxymethylpenicillin 250mg qds
for 1wk).

Vocal cord nodules Can cause hoarseness. Usually precipitated
by overuse of the voice—typically in singers. They can be visualized at
laryngoscopy. Initial treatment is resting the voice but sometimes nodules
have to be removed surgically.
Functional disorders Hysterical paralysis of the vocal cord adductors
due to psychological stress. Can cause the voice to d to a whisper or be
lost completely. More common amongst young women.
Management Refer for laryngoscopy to exclude organic cause. Speech
therapy and psychological support may help.

Laryngeal carcinoma 4 > 5. Smoking is the main risk factor. The first
sign is usually hoarseness, followed by stridor, dysphagia, and pain,
Management Refer urgently to ENT if suspected. Diagnosis is
confirmed with laryngoscopy and biopsy. Treatment is with surgery 9
radiotherapy. Early tumours confined to the vocal cord have 80–90%
5y survival.

Hoarseness and stridor

Post-laryngectomy problems After laryngectomy patients have a
permanent tracheostomy and require practical and psychological support.
Problems include:
• Excessive secretions    •	Recurrent pneumonia
• Stenosis of the tracheostomy site—refer to ENT/oral surgery if severe
•	Communication difficulties—ensure referred to speech therapy
• Maintenance of adequate diet—refer to dietician if not maintaining
weight and recurrence of tumour has been excluded
Stridor Noise created on inspiration due to narrowing of the larynx or
trachea—much more common in children than adults. Treat the cause.
• Signs of severe airway narrowing
• Use of accessory muscles and
• Distress
tracheal tug
• i respiratory rate
•	Pallor and cyanosis
Causes Congenital abnormalities of the larynx; epiglottis; croup
(laryngotracheobronchitis); inhaled foreign body; trauma; laryngeal paralysis.

Laryngomalacia (congenital laryngeal stridor)
Common among small babies. Due to floppy aryatic folds
and the small size of the airway. Stridor becomes more
noticeable during sleep, excitement, crying, and with concurrent URTIs. Normally resolves without treatment. Parental concern
may necessitate referral.
Croup Common viral infection occurring in epidemics in autumn and
spring. Starts with mild fever and runny nose. In younger children (<4y),
oedema and secretions in the larynx and trachea result in a barking
cough and inspiratory stridor. The cough typically starts at night and
is exacerbated by crying and parental anxiety. Some children have
recurrent attacks associated with viral URTI.
Management Steam helps. There is also evidence that steroids can be
helpful—give oral dexamethasone 0.15mg/kg or prednisolone 1–2mg/
kg. Admit as a paediatric emergency if there is intercostal recession,
cyanosis, or the child’s carers are unable to cope.
Acute epiglottitis in children Bacterial infection causing a swollen
epiglottis. Can potentially obstruct the airway. Much rarer since
introduction of routine Haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) immunization.
Consider if stridor, drooling, fever, and upright ‘leaning forward’ posture.
• If suspected do not examine the child’s throat as this can precipitate
complete obstruction.
Management Refer urgently but try to maintain a calm atmosphere to
avoid distressing the child. Examination will be undertaken in hospital with
full resuscitation facilities on hand. Treatment: IV antibiotics.

Adult epiglottitis Much less common than childhood epiglottitis and
less likely to cause complete airway obstruction. Refer for IV antibiotics.

Inhaled foreign body Refer to ENT for assessment.

chapter 25

Ear, nose, and throat

Neck lumps and salivary gland problems
Neck lumps are common and can be the first sign of serious underlying pathology. Accurate assessment is important to differentiate harmless
lumps from those needing further investigation and treatment. Ask about
local symptoms in the head/neck and systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, anorexia, weight d). Differential diagnosis—see Figure 25.1.

• Refer urgently to ENTN

•	Any unexplained lump in the neck of recent onset
•	Any previously undiagnosed lump that has changed over 3–6wk.

Lymphadenopathy Most enlarged LNs are reactive LNs—suggested
by a short history, soft tender mobile lump, and concurrent infection.
• Check FBC, blood film + ESR (or CRP/viscosity) And consider further
investigation, discussion with a specialist, and/or referral ifN:
• LN >2cm in size
• Lymphadenopathy
•	Widespread lymphadenopathy
present ≥6wk
• LNs are increasing in size
•	Associated weight d, night sweats, and/or splenomegaly
Causes of lymphadenopathy
• Benign infective Viral infection, e.g. EBV, CMV, adenovirus, HIV; bacterial
infection, e.g. streptococcal sore throat, TB; toxoplasmosis; syphilis
• Benign non-infective Sarcoid; connective tissue disease (e.g. RA); skin
disease (e.g. eczema, psoriasis); drugs (e.g. phenytoin)
• Malignant Lymphoma, CLL, ALL, metastases—head and neck cancer
may present with enlarged cervical LNs
Branchial cyst Arises from embryonic remnants of the second
branchial cleft in the neck. Most common in young adults. Presents as a
smooth swelling in front of the anterior border of the sternomastoid at
the junction of its upper and middle thirds—often during a viral URTI.
Position is characteristic. Examination: fluctuant lump that does not move
on swallowing. Treatment is by excision—refer to ENT.
Thyroglossal cyst The thyroid gland develops from the lower portion
of the thyroglossal duct. If a portion of this duct remains patent it can
form a thyroglossal cyst. Usually presents in young adults (peak age
15–30y) with either a painless, smooth, cystic midline swelling between
the isthmus of the thyroid gland and the hyoid cartilage or just above
the hyoid cartilage or, if the cyst is inflamed, a painful, tender lump with
localized swelling. Examination: the cyst rises as the patient sticks out his
tongue. Refer to ENT for excision.

Salivary gland strictures and stones
• Salivary stones 80% of calculi are seen in the submandibular duct
system. Less frequently they occur in the parotid duct system and
rarely in other salivary glands
• Strictures of the salivary gland duct occur as a complication of a
pre-existing calculus, due to mucus plugs or following trauma to the
duct wall (e.g. cheek biting)

Neck lumps and salivary gland problems

Lump in the neck

Consider:
• Sebaceous cyst
• Lipoma
• Carbuncle
• Neurofibroma

YES

Is the lump superficial to
the underlying muscle and fascia?
NO
Is the lump in the midline?

YES

NO
Consider:
• Lymph nodes
• Branchial cyst
• Cystic hygroma
• AV fistula
• Thyroid swellings (b p. 362)
• Carotid artery aneurysm (b p. 285)
• Spinal abscess
• Cervical rib (b p. 475)
• Carotid body, sternomastoid, or
salivary gland tumour

Consider:
• Dermoid cyst
• Thyroglossal cyst (moves on
sticking out tongue)
• Pharyngeal pouch (b p. 385)
• Laryngocele
• Subhyoid bursa
• Plunging ranula
• Carcinoma of the larynx,
trachea, or oesophagus

Figure 25.1 Differential diagnosis of neck lumps
Presentation Pain and swelling on eating due to obstruction of saliva
flow. The gland may appear normal or be tender and swollen. Sometimes
stones can be visualized at the salivary duct orifice or felt on bimanual
palpation. Both stones and strictures predispose to infection in the gland.
Management Refer to ENT/oral surgery for confirmation of diagnosis—
stones are seen on plain X-rays or sialography. Some stones pass
spontaneously but most require surgical removal—the whole gland may
be removed to prevent recurrent problems. Strictures can often be dilated.
Acute parotiditis Unilateral parotid swelling and pain caused by
bacterial infection. Predisposing factors include DM, immunosuppression/
compromise, local fibrosis following radiotherapy, and autoimmune
destruction (e.g. Sjögren’s). Precipitating factors include surgery, dehydration,
salivary stones/strictures, and poor oral hygiene. Treat with antibiotics (e.g.
amoxicillin 500mg tds for 1wk) and rehydration. If not settling consider
abscess formation—refer to ENT/oral surgery for drainage.

Mumps b p. 652
Salivary gland tumours Present with a lump/swelling in a salivary

gland—80% in the parotid gland. Treated with surgery ± radiotherapy.

• Refer urgently to ENT/oral surgery if unexplained swelling in the
parotid or submandibular gland for >1moN. Refer sooner if pain, rapid
growth, hard fixed mass, weight d, or facial nerve palsy.

Anosmia

Bilateral anosmia More common than unilateral. Causes:
• Local causes URTI, rhinitis, enlarged turbinates, nasal polyps
• Central causes CNS tumours, after head injury, meningitis,
hydrocephalus, Kallman’s syndrome
Unilateral anosmia One-sided loss of the sense of smell. Causes: head
injury, frontal lobe lesion.
Taste disturbance Taste of food is often dependent on smell. Any
cause of anosmia can also result in taste disturbance. Other causes of taste
disturbance include:
• Drugs—taste disturbance is a side effect of ACE inhibitors
• Glossopharyngeal nerve palsy—taste loss on posterior third of
the tongue
• Facial nerve palsy (b p. 537)
•	Chronic adrenal insufficiency—i sensitivity to taste
• Malignancy—taste sensations, e.g. metallic taste with pancreatic cancer

Nasal discharge
• Clear discharge May be physiological (e.g. due to cold air), due to
allergy (e.g. hay fever), or viral (e.g. URTI)
• Clear fluid after trauma Can indicate CSF leak
• Green discharge Indicates active bacterial infection
• Yellow discharge May indicate viral/bacterial infection or allergy
• Persistent blood stained discharge • Tumour of the nose or
post-nasal sinus until proven otherwise—refer urgently to ENT
0 The term rhinorrhoea is also used to mean nasal discharge. The term
coryza is usually applied to watery discharge from nasal mucus membranes
that occurs when a patient has a viral infection.
CSF rhinorrhoea Clear fluid dripping from the nose after trauma can
indicate a fracture of the roof of the ethmoid labyrinth and CSF leak. Fluid
tests +ve for glucose. It suggests significant trauma—consider referral for
head injury assessment. Spontaneous healing of the CSF leak is the norm but
if it persists refer to neurosurgery for dural closure.
Nasal obstruction Common symptom experienced occasionally by
many. Usually obstruction is bilateral. • Assume persistent unilateral
blockage is neoplastic until proven otherwise—refer urgently to ENT.
Causes of nasal obstruction
• Mucosal swelling Coryza, rhinitis (b p. 942), iatrogenic, nasal polyps
• Septal deviation Trauma, congenital, e.g. 2o to cleft lip
• Other Tumour, enlarged adenoids, foreign body (b p. 1108)

Deviated nasal septum Common in adults—usually s to injury. May

be associated with external deformity. Nasal blockage is unilateral. Treat
mucosal swelling due to rhinitis first as that may be sufficient to control
symptoms. If unsuccessful, refer for surgery (submucous resection).

Nasal problems

Septal haematoma May occur after injury and causes nasal blockage.

Presents as a bilateral soft bulging of the septum. Refer urgently to ENT
for evacuation to prevent cartilage destruction.
Septal perforation Can cause bleeding, crusting, and discomfort.
Causes: trauma, nose picking, cocaine use, post-operative, malignancy. Refer
if suspicion of malignancy, otherwise treat symptomatically (e.g. vaseline or
naseptin for crusting)—surgical closure is often not successful.
Post-nasal drip Draining of nasal secretions down the back of the
throat. Treat as for chronic sinusitis (b p. 942). Symptoms include:
• Feeling of mucus in the back of the throat
•	Chronic cough—usually worse in the morning and improves in the day
• Morning sore throat
• Nasty taste in the mouth/bad breath
Causes URTI, sinusitis, allergic and/or vasomotor rhinitis, nasal polyps,
deviated nasal septum.
Nasal polyps Most common in 4 aged >40y—associated with asthma,
allergic rhinitis, and chronic sinusitis. Consider CF in children <16y.
Symptoms: nasal blockage; watery discharge; post-nasal drip; change in
voice; loss of smell; taste disturbance.
Signs Polyps are smooth and pale, usually bilateral, and commonly arise
from the middle meatus and middle turbinates. They may completely
block the nasal passage. They can be confused with enlarged inferior
turbinates but are more mobile and lack sensation.
Management Try medical treatment—steroid nasal drops (e.g. fluticasone
nasal drops od) until polyps shrink (maximum 1mo), and then steroid
nasal spray to d recurrence. Swab and give antibiotics if purulent nasal
discharge. Refer for consideration of polypectomy if medical treatment
fails. 0 Polyps often recur after surgery.
• Refer unilateral polyps with an unusual or irregular appearance especially if ulcerating and/or bleeding, for exclusion of malignancy.

Nose bleed/epistaxis b p. 1074 Nasal foreign body b p. 1108
Snoring and sleep apnoea b p. 338
Fractured nose Undisplaced nasal fractures usually heal without

intervention. X-ray is unhelpful. Give adequate analgesia. Advise that
bruising may be extensive and the nose will feel blocked for 1–2wk.
Associated injuries Consider assessment for head injury (b p. 1112).
Always look for associated fractures of the zygoma/maxillary bones (‘step’
deformity in the orbit, dental malocclusion, difficulty opening the jaw,
diplopia). Refer urgently to the maxillofacial surgeons if present.
Assessment for permanent deformity Can be difficult at the time of the
injury due to soft tissue swelling—reassess 7–10d after injury. Refer promptly
any patient with significant deformity or if the patient is unhappy with the
appearance of the nose to ENT. Reduction should take place <3wk after
fracture. Deviation of the nasal septum may not be correctable at the time
of manipulation and, if symptomatic, will need a later submucous resection.

Ear, nose, and throat

Sinusitis and rhinitis
Acute sinusitis Infection of ≥ 1 paranasal sinus (maxillary, frontal,
ethmoid, or sphenoid). Usually follows URTI—10% are due to tooth infection. Presents with frontal headache/facial pain (may be difficult to distinguish from toothache)—typically worse on movement/bending 9 purulent
nasal discharge 9 fever.
ManagementN Most sinusitis resolves spontaneously in 7–10d. Advise
analgesia (paracetamol 9 ibuprofen) and fluids for all patients. Steam
inhalation may also help. Treatment options:
• Decongestants—little evidence of effectiveness
• Steroid nasal sprays (e.g. beclometasone 2 puffs to each nostril bd)
•	Antibiotics (e.g. amoxicillin 500mg tds)—reserve for patients with
frontal sinusitis, severe symptoms, symptoms persisting >2.5wk, or at
high risk of serious complications (e.g. CF, immunosuppression)
Chronic/recurrent sinusitis >3mo of symptoms or >3 episodes of
sinusitis in any year. Presents with post-nasal drip; frontal headache/facial
pain; and/or blocked nose. Associated with nasal polyps (b p. 941) and
vasomotor rhinitis. Treat as for acute sinusitis. Refer to ENT if symptoms
are interfering with life—surgery may help.
Rhinitis Inflammation of the nasal mucosa. Affects >1:5 people. May be
allergic (most children; 1:3 adults) or non-allergic (e.g. vasomotor—triggered by
physical/chemical agents such as cold air, tobacco, or perfumes; drug-induced).
If allergic cause is suspected, ask about potential allergens: pollen, animals,
fungi/moulds, occupational allergens (e.g. flour, latex).
Symptoms Nasal discharge, itching, sneezing ± nasal blockage/congestion.
Symptoms may be seasonal (only certain times of the year) or perennial
(all year); intermittent (<4d/wk or <4wk at a time) or persistent. Make
an assessment of severity. Patients have moderate/severe symptoms if ≥1
of: troublesome symptoms; abnormal sleep; impairment of daily activities/
sport/leisure; problems at work/school. If symptoms are intrusive and
difficult to control, refer for allergy testing.
Signs Swollen inferior turbinates; d nasal airway; pale or mauve mucosa;
nasal discharge; ‘allergic crease’ on bridge of nose from persistent rubbing
(young sufferers with allergic rhinitis).
Management of allergic rhinitis General measures include d in allergen
exposure; nasal douching with saline nose drops ± steam inhalation. Drug
treatment—see Table 25.2.
Desensitization 50—70% success rate. Risk of anaphylaxis is high so
provision is limited to specialist centres—refer via an allergy clinic.

Notes

Nasal steroids

Effective if applied properly and can be used safely long-term
Take several days to work—try for >2wk before abandoning. Often
started at high dose—when symptoms are controlled, dose is d to the
minimum that maintains symptom control
Choose preparations with minimal systemic absorption if using >1mo (e.g.
fluticasone, mometasone). If nasal irritation, sore throat, or nosebleeds
switch to a preparation without benzalkonium chloride preservative, e.g.
Flixonase Nasules® or Rhinocort®
Oral steroids
Only rarely needed. Consider for: severe nasal obstruction; short-term
rescue medication for uncontrolled symptoms; or control of symptoms
for important social/work events (e.g. examinations)
Use 20–30mg prednisolone po for 5–7d in combination with nasal
steroids. Injected preparations are not recommended
Oral antihistamines Choose a non-sedative antihistamine, e.g. loratadine 10mg od. May be
used alone or in combination with nasal steroids. Improve associated
symptoms (e.g. conjunctivitis) as well as nasal symptoms
Topical
e.g. Azelastine nasal drops—useful as a rescue therapy
antihistamines
Faster acting than oral antihistamines—onset of action is in <15min
e.g. Montelukast 10mg od
Leukotriene
receptor
As effective as antihistamines. Useful for patients with concurrent asthma.
antagonists
Combination with antihistamines does not i efficacy
Topical/oral
e.g. Ephedrine nasal drops tds/qds
decongestants
Effective (drops >> oral preparations) in reducing nasal congestion
Discourage use of nasal drops for >10d as vasoconstriction l mucosal
damage l worsening of nasal congestion—a vicious cycle termed rhinitis
medicamentosa. Not caused by oral preparations
Topical
e.g. Ipratropium bromide nasal spray tds—d rhinorrhoea but no effect on
anticholinergics
other nasal symptoms
Topical chromones e.g. Sodium cromoglicate or nedocromil sodium nasal spray—less
effective than nasal steroids but may be useful for children or pregnant
women wishing to avoid steroids

Non-allergic rhinitis Treat as for allergic rhinitis—treatment is often less
successful.

Hay fever Rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis and/or wheeze due to an

allergic reaction to pollen. Occurs at different times in the year depending
on which pollen is involved (see Table 25.1).
Management When the pollen count is high—keep windows shut
(including car windows—consider pollen filter for the car); wear glasses/
sunglasses; avoid grassy spaces. Treat as for allergic rhinitis. Topical
chromone eye drops (e.g. nedocromil) may help eye symptoms.

Ear, nose, and throat

Earache and external ear problems
Earache Ear pain is a common presenting symptom. Think of:
• Local causes Outer ear: otitis externa; furunculosis; impacted wax;
pinna pain (perichondritis); malignant disease of the ear. Middle ear:
otitis media; barotrauma; myringitis; mastoiditis
• Referred pain Trigeminal nerve (dental abscess/caries, impacted molar
teeth, TMJ dysfunction); facial nerve (HSV infection, Ramsay Hunt
syndrome); vagus nerve (tumours of the piriform fossa, larynx, or
post-cricoid area); glossopharyngeal nerve (tonsillitis/quinsy/post-op
tonsillectomy, tumour of the base of the tongue or tonsil, neuralgia);
cervical nerves C2/3 (cervical sponylosis)
• Refer urgently to ENT if unilateral unexplained pain in the head/neck
area for >4wk, associated with otalgia (earache) but normal otoscopyN.

Myringitis Inflammation of the tympanic membrane. Myringitis bullosa
describes painful vesicles on the tympanic membrane associated with
mycoplasma or viral URTIs. A similar picture occurs with Ramsay Hunt
syndrome (b p. 538).
Discharge from the ear Otorrhoea is discharge from the ear. Major
causes are: otitis externa; otitis media; and cholesteatoma.
0 Always exclude a perforated drum in discharging ears—beware of
cholesteatoma. If you cannot visualize the drum—review the patient.
Clear fluid leaking from an ear after head injury may suggest a CSF leak.
Fluid tests +ve for glucose. This implies a head injury with force—refer to
A&E for further assessment.
Otitis externa Inflammation ± infection of the external ear canal.
Common—affecting ~10% at some time. Adults > children. Associated
with eczema of the ear canal. Risk factors include: swimming, humid
environment, narrow ear canal, hearing aid use, and mechanical trauma
(e.g. cleaning ears out with cotton buds or after syringing).
Acute otitis externa <6wk duration. Presents with ear pain (often severe),
discharge (may be offensive), and hearing loss ± lymphadenopathy behind/
in front of the ear. If the ear canal is not obscured by debris/discharge,
it appears red, swollen, and inflamed. Moving the pinna may be painful.
0 Acute episodes have a tendency to recur.
• Diabetics and immunosuppressed patients can develop a severe
necrotizing form of otitis externa—refer to ENT early.
Chronic otitis externa (>3mo duration) Ongoing discharge from the ear 9
hearing loss. Causes canal stenosis and permanent hearing d.
Management Although very common, can be difficult to treat. Take a
swab if any discharge.
•	Advise analgesia, e.g. paracetamol 9 ibuprofen
•	Prescribe ear drops—options are: aluminium acetate drops (as effective as
antibiotics); and antibiotic and/or steroid drops (e.g. Locorten-Vioform®)
X If you cannot see the eardrum to ensure that it is intact, use of
potentially ototoxic gentamicin ear drops is controversial

Earache and external ear problems

•	Adding oral antibiotics (e.g. flucloxacillin/erythromycin qds) does not
improve outcomeCE—only use if treatment with drops alone has failed
or administration of ear drops may be ineffective, e.g. debris within the
canal, very swollen canal, uncooperative child
0 Skin of the pinna adjacent to the ear canal is often affected by eczema.
Treat with topical corticosteroid cream/ointment—avoid prolonged use.
If no response after 1wk, Try alternative ear drop, e.g. Otosporin®
(contains neomycin, hydrocortisone, and an antifungal—polymyxin B) 9
oral antibiotics. If swab result is available, prescribe based on the result.
Consider gentle syringing to remove infected material. Refer to ENT for
aural toilet/advice on further management if no response.
Furunculosis Boil in the ear canal. Presents with severe ear pain—may
be exacerbated by moving the tragus or opening the jaw. Exclude DM.
• If no surrounding cellulitis—advise OTC analgesia and application
of hot compresses; most will settle. If not settling, prescribe topical
antibiotics and steroid drops, e.g. Gentisone HC®, 3 drops qds for 1wk
• If surrounding cellulitis—prescribe flucloxacillin 250–500mg qds for 7d
•	Refer to ENT for incision and drainage if not settling
Foreign bodies in the ear b p. 1108
Ear wax Normal. Becomes a problem only if causes deafness, pain, or
other ear-related symptoms. Factors preventing normal extrusion of wax
from the ear (e.g. wearing a hearing aid, using cotton buds to clean ears)
i the chance of ear wax accumulating.
Ear syringing Indicated if impacted wax causes loss of hearing, discomfort,
or tinnitus. Avoid syringing if there is deafness in the other ear or a history
of perforation of the eardrum (including grommet), previous mastoid
operation, or chronic middle ear disease (e.g. chronic suppurative otitis
media, cholesteatoma). If ear syringing is contraindicated, refer to ENT for
removal under direct vision, e.g. with microsuction.
Perichondritis of the pinna Infection of the pinna due to ear piercing
or laceration. If not treated quickly can result in destruction of cartilage and
‘cauliflower ear’. Pseudomonas is a common infecting organism so treat with
oral ciprofloxacin 500–750mg bd. If not settling, refer as an emergency to A&E.
Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis (CNH) Caused by pressure
on the ear (e.g. against pillow at night, tight headwear). Tender lump often
with overlying scaling/ulceration on the outer helix of the pinna. Tender to
lie on and painful in the cold. Advise relief of pressure 9 topical steroid/
antibiotic cream. If this fails, cryotherapy or surgical excision is effective.
Differential diagnosis: SCC, BCC, gouty tophus.
Haematoma of the pinna b p. 1113

Accessory auricle Incidence: 1.5:100 live births. Small
skin lesion consisting of skin ± cartilage in front of the ear.
No treatment is necessary but accessory auricles are often
removed for cosmetic reasons.
Bat ears Common congenital abnormality. A fold of the pinna is absent.
The child is noted to have protruding ears. Runs in families. Referral for
surgery is indicated if the condition is causing psychosocial problems.

chapter 25

Ear, nose, and throat

Otitis media
Acute suppurative otitis media (OM) Common, acute inflammation
of the middle ear. Parental smoking i children’s risk of OM—encourage
parents to stop smoking. Caused by viral/bacterial infection.
Presentation Ear pain—usually unilateral ± fever/systemic upset. Ear
discharge may be associated with relief of pain if there is a spontaneous
perforation of the eardrum. Examination: red, bulging drum. If perforation
has occurred the external canal may be filled with pus obscuring the drum.
0 If you can’t see the drum, review the patient after treatment.
ManagementN
• In 80%, symptoms resolve in ≤4d without treatment. Advise fluids and
paracetamol and/or ibuprofen for analgesia and fever control. Symptoms
resolve 24h earlier with antibiotics but antibiotics carry the risk of side
effects and use i community antibiotic resistance. Consider using a
‘delayed’ approach—prescribing if symptoms are no better in 4d
•	Consider prescribing immediately (e.g. amoxicillin tds) for children
with bilateral OM or acute OM with otorrhoea
•	Prescribe immediately if very systemically unwell or at high risk
of serious complications because of pre-existing co-morbidity,
e.g. significant heart, lung, renal, liver, or neuromuscular disease,
immunosuppression, CF, young children born prematurely
• If recurrent attacks (>4 episodes in 6mo) or if acute perforation does
not heal in <1mo—refer to ENT
Chronic suppurative otitis media Persistent drainage (>1mo) from
the ear associated with tympanic membrane perforation and conductive
hearing loss. Not usually painful.
• Central perforation ‘Safe disease’. Treat as for otitis externa
(b p. 944). Refer to ENT if there is persistent discharge, deafness,
vertigo, or earache. Surgery to close the drum may help
• Attic or marginal perforation ‘Unsafe disease’. May indicate
cholesteatoma. Refer to ENT for further assessment
Serous/secretory otitis media (glue ear) Non-infected fluid
accumulates in the middle ear due to dysfunction/obstruction of the
Eustachian tube, e.g. s to throat or ear infection, or tonsillar hyperplasia.
Most common cause of hearing loss in childhood. More common in
children with Down’s syndrome or cleft lip/palate. Symptoms: deafness 9
earache, difficulties with speech/language, ± behavioural problems. Signs:
dull, concave drum with visible peripheral vessels ± fluid level and/or air
bubbles behind the drum.
Management in children Untreated, 75% have no symptoms
in <3mo; 5% have bilateral hearing loss persisting >12mo.
Glue ear resolves as the child grows older—treatment is
aimed at d impact of symptoms until natural resolution. If
not resolving, refer to community audiology/ENT depending on local
policy. Specialist treatment options include watchful waiting or grommet insertion.

Otitis media

Grommets Air-conducting tubes inserted through the eardrum to drain
the middle ear. Most are extruded spontaneously <9mo after insertion.
May need reinsertion if deafness recurs. Patients can swim/bathe but
should avoid diving. If discharge from the ear, treat with antibiotic/steroid
ear drops 9 aural toilet (see Otitis externa—b p. 944).
Management in adults Uncommon in adults—usually follows URTI and
spontaneously resolves in <6wk. If not resolving or no history of preceding
URTI, refer to ENT to exclude post-nasal space tumour.

Mastoiditis Rare complication of acute OM—infection spreads to the

mastoid. Symptoms: persistent, throbbing earache; creamy, profuse ear
discharge; increasing conductive deafness; fever and general malaise. Signs:
tenderness 9 swelling over the mastoid; ear may stick out; drum is red/
bulging or perforated—if the eardrum is normal, it is not mastoiditis. Refer
to ENT as an emergency. Treatment is with IV antibiotics.
Cholesteatoma Skin or stratified squamous epithelium growing in the
middle ear. Thought to result from formation of a retraction pocket in the
pars flaccida of the eardrum. Local expansion as the drum desquamates
can damage adjacent structures (e.g. facial nerve; semicircular canals—
resulting in vertigo). If infected there is an offensive discharge from the
ear. Signs: perforation of the pars flaccida of the drum with pearly white
discharge within it and conductive deafness. Refer to ENT. Treatment is
with suction to clear out the cholesteatoma and/or surgery. Following
surgery, the ear should be dry and trouble-free—if not, refer back to ENT.
Life-long follow-up is required as cholesteatoma recurs.
Tympanosclerosis Thickening and calcification of the tympanic
membrane as a result of scarring from recurrent ear infections or after
grommet insertion. Usually asymptomatic. No action is needed.
Barotrauma Due to changes in atmospheric pressure (e.g. air travel,
diving) in those with poor Eustachian tube function. Presents with a
sensation of pressure/pain in one/both ears, hearing loss 9 vertigo. There
is fluid behind the drum (or perforated drum), haemorrhagic areas in the
drum ± conductive hearing d. Usually resolves spontaneously in 2–3wk. If
perforation has not healed in <1mo refer to ENT.
Prevention Valsalva manoeuvre, yawning, or sucking boiled sweets during
flight—particularly during take-off/landing—encourages the Eustachian
tube to open to allow pressure to equalize. Decongestants may help, e.g.
pseudoephedrine 120mg 30min prior to flight. Patients with otitis media
should not fly.

Deafness
Congenital deafness Usually detected on neonatal
screening (b p. 856). Causes:
• Birth asphyxia
• Genetic (50%)
• Intrauterine infection, e.g. rubella • Meningitis
• Severe neonatal jaundice
• Drugs given in pregnancy, e.g.
streptomycin
Childhood-onset deafness Temporary deafness is common due
to middle ear infections but permanent deafness rare (1–2:1,000). d
hearing is often noticed by parents or teachers—take concerns seriously
and refer for assessment. Deafness causes long-term speech, language 9
behavioural problems and early intervention makes a difference.
Management History, examination, assess development (including
speech and language), consider referral for audiology or to ENT. Causes:
• If no earache Bilateral glue ear (b p. 946); impacted wax; hereditary
cause; sequel of meningitis, head injury, or birth complications
• If earache Acute otitis media (b p. 946); impacted wax
Adult-onset deafness Common and debilitating, leading to isolation

and depression. Presentation tends to be late. Causes: See Table 25.3.
Presentation Usually hearing loss develops insidiously with increasing
problems understanding others when there is background noise. Tinnitus
may be the presenting problem.
Useful screening questions
• Do other people mumble a lot?
• Do you find yourself frequently saying ‘pardon’?
• Does the family say the TV is too loud?
• Do you miss hearing the doorbell or ‘phone?
• Do you occasionally get the wrong end of the stick in a conversation?
Management Examine the drum; exclude wax; consider post-nasal space
tumour. If no self-limiting cause is found, refer for a hearing test to quantify
hearing loss and assess suitability for hearing aid.
• Refer to ENT if:
•	Conductive deafness of unknown cause
• Sudden deafness if no wax visible
•	Asymmetrical deafness—refer urgently to ENTN to exclude rare,
dangerous diagnoses, e.g. acoustic neuroma, cholesteatoma

Benefits for deaf people b p. 222
Presbyacusis Very common. Causes bilateral symmetrical sensorineu-

ral deafness in the over 50s. Deafness is gradual in onset. High frequencies are more severely affected, so speech discrimination—particularly
of high-pitched voices—is lost first. Examination is normal. Refer for an
audiogram to confirm diagnosis and then for a hearing aid if appropriate.
Otosclerosis Bilateral conductive deafness due to adherence of the
stapes footplate to the bone around the oval window. May be FH (50%).
If deteriorates in pregnancy, avoid prescribing combined contraceptives.
Refer to ENT for assessment to replace the stapes with an implant.

Ménière’s disease (b p. 951)
Drugs, e.g. aminoglycosides, furosemide
Acoustic neuroma
Noise-induced deafness

Noise-induced deafness Caused by exposure to noise >85dB. May
occur in work or non-work settings (e.g. firearm sports). Immediate
indications are ringing in the ears/muffling of hearing after exposure. Refer
to audiology. Avoid further excessive noise exposure. Hearing aids may
help. If employment-related, may be eligible for compensation (b p. 116;
war veterans—b p. 223). Employees should be protected from noise and
provided with ear protection if working in noisy environments.
Acoustic neuroma Slow-growing neurofibroma arising from the
acoustic nerve. Symptoms: unilateral sensorineural deafness, tinnitus ±
facial palsy. Management: refer to ENT. Treatment is surgical.
• Refer urgently to ENT to exclude acoustic neuroma if unilateral or
asymmetrical sensorineural deafnessN.

Hearing aids Can help anyone with reduced hearing, but they never
restore perfect hearing. Aids may be:
• Body-worn, behind-the-ear, or in-the-ear
• Analogue or digital Most traditional aids are analogue aids and amplify
all sounds, including background noise. Digital aids can be programmed
to filter out background noise and customized to the individual’s
pattern of hearing loss; whistle less; and can have different settings for
different sound environments, e.g. TV, crowded rooms
• Bone conduction aids For those with conductive hearing loss or if
unable to wear conventional aids due to surgery/malformation
• CROS/BiCROS aids For those with unilateral complete deafness.
CROS hearing aids pick up sound from the side with no hearing and
feed it to the better ear. BiCROS aids amplify sound from both sides
and feed it into the ear that has some hearing
Cochlear implants Benefit patients of any age with profound bilateral
sensorineural hearing loss. 2 components—one external (worn behind
the ear) and the other internal (surgically implanted). Intense speech
therapy is needed for several years to interpret signals from the implant.

Ear, nose, and throat

Tinnitus and vertigo
Dizziness and giddiness b p. 549
Tinnitus Ringing or buzzing heard in the ears or head. Occasional

tinnitus is common (15% of population) but 2% are severely affected.
Patients with tinnitus that interferes with daily life and sleep are prone to
depression. Cause: often unknown. May accompany hearing loss or be due
to noise exposure, head injury, Ménière’s, anaemia, i BP, or drugs (loop
diuretics, tricyclics, aminoglycosides, aspirin, NSAIDs).
Management Reassure patients that there is no sinister cause. Refer
to audiology for a hearing aid if there is deafness. Drugs are not helpful
but look for and treat associated depression. Psychological support is
important—consider referral to a hearing therapist and/or support group
(e.g. Tinnitus Association). Masking with background music/radio or an aid
that produces white noise (available via ENT) can help. Surgical sectioning
of the cochlear nerve is a last resort l deafness.
Indications for referral to ENT
• Objective tinnitus—noise can be heard by an observer; rare and may
be due to vascular malformations or TMJ problems
• Unilateral tinnitus—especially if associated with deafness; refer to
exclude acoustic neuroma
Vertigo An illusion that the surroundings are spinning. Ask about duration and frequency, associated nausea, deafness and tinnitus, and recent
viral symptoms. Causes:
• Episodic vertigo lasting a few seconds or minutes Commonly due to
benign positional vertigo
• Episodic vertigo lasting minutes to hours Consider Ménière’s disease
• Prolonged vertigo (>24h) Peripheral lesion, e.g. viral labyrinthitis or
trauma, or a central lesion (usually associated with other signs), e.g.
multiple sclerosis, stroke, tumour
Examination
• Look for neurological signs especially cerebellar signs, cranial nerve
lesions, and Romberg’s sign
•	Assess BP, nystagmus, eardrums, and hearing
• Hallpike manoeuvre:
• Move the patient quickly from a sitting position to a lying supine
position with head turned to one side and extended over the end
of the bed—look for nystagmus and ask about vertigo
• Repeat with the head turned to the other side
Nystagmus Involuntary, oscillatory eye movements—can be congenital
or due to labyrinthine or visual system problems. Refer all cases for assessment, unless associated with self-limiting labyrinthitis.
• Sudden attacks of vertigo can be dangerous. Consider risks of swimming, dangerous machinery, and ladders. Advise patients to stop driving
and inform the DVLA—if group 1 licence can resume once symptoms
are controlled; group 2 licences are restored if symptom-free >1y.

Tinnitus and vertigo

Benign positional vertigo Recurrent attacks of sudden-onset vertigo,
lasting only a few seconds or minutes. Occur with sudden changes in posture. Common after head injury or viral illness. Possibly caused by otoliths
in the labyrinth. Diagnosis is based on history and a +ve Hallpike test.
Normal tympanic membrane.
Management Usually self-limiting (few weeks)—although may continue
intermittently for years. Reassure. Labyrinthine sedatives are not helpful.
Teach the patient to minimize symptoms by sitting and lying in stages.
Habituation may occur by maintaining the trigger position until vertigo
settles. If not settling, perform or refer to ENT for Epley’s manoeuvreC
(rapid repositioning of head to move otoliths out of the labyrinth) and/or
refer to physiotherapy for exercises/vestibular rehabilitation.
Viral labyrnthitis Usually follows a viral URTI.
• Symptoms and signs Sudden onset of vertigo, prostration, nausea and
vomiting, no associated loss of hearing, normal tympanic membrane
• Treatment Labyrinthine sedatives, e.g. cyclizine or prochlorperazine
• Natural history Usually resolves in 2–3wk—if persists >6wk refer
Ménière’s syndrome Overdiagnosed in patients with recurrent vertigo and deafness. It is a complex of symptoms including clustering of
attacks of vertigo and nausea, tinnitus, a sense of fullness in the ear, and
sensorineural deafness which may be progressive. Aetiology: idiopathic dilation of endolymphatic spaces.
Management
•	Refer all suspected cases to ENT or neurology to confirm diagnosis
•	Provide information and advise about support organizations
• Treat acute attacks with labyrinthine sedatives, e.g. cyclizine or
prochlorperazine. Consider buccal/rectal routes of administration if
vomiting. Do not use long-term
• Encourage patients to mobilize after an acute attack
• Betahistine taken regularly may help in some patients, as may thiazide
diuretics, a low-salt diet, vestibular rehabilitation, tinnitus maskers, and/
or hearing aids
• There is some indication that stress may precipitate attacks
• Look out for and treat concurrent anxiety and depression

Vertebro-basilar insufficiency Common in older patients.
History of dizziness on extension and rotation of the neck.
Normal tympanic membranes. May have associated cervical
spondylosis and neck pain. Provide lifestyle advice. X Some
advocate use of a cervical collar.
Labyrinthectomy is a last resort and can help vertigo but results in deafness on that side. P. Ménière, (1799–1862)—French ENT surgeon.

Ophthalmology

Assessment of the eye
History Ask about pain, redness, watering, change in appearance of the
eye, altered vision, and if the problem is unilateral or bilateral. Distinguish
between blurred and double vision. Enquire about trauma, previous similar episodes, systemic illness, and eye disease in the family. If using medication, take a drug history (including eye drops).
Visual acuity Test and record the central (macular) vision of each eye
separately for near and distance vision with glasses on. Cover the non-test
eye carefully. On a full-size Snellen chart, line ‘6’ can be read by the normal
eye at 6m (see Figure 26.3—b p. 957). If unable to read the 6/9 line,
use a pinhole to improve refraction. Near vision can be checked using a
near-vision testing card (see Figure 26.2—b p. 956) or newspaper.

Examination
• The eyelids should be symmetrical. Check the skin around the lids, the
position, eyelashes of, and any inflammation, crusting, or swelling of
the lid or lid margin
• Use a bright light to examine the eye surface—it should be bright and
shiny. Use a fluorescein stain if any indication of corneal damage
• Note any redness—if most marked around the lid lining and periphery
of the eye conjunctivitis is likely, whereas a duskier redness around
the margin of the cornea (ciliary congestion) suggests disease of the
cornea, iris, or deeper parts of the eye (uvea)
Examining the ocular media Takes practice. Darken the room and
ensure you have good batteries in your ophthalmoscope.
• Check the red reflex (opacities within the eye appear as a shadow)
• Examine the disc—place your hand on the patient’s forehead and support
the lid with your thumb; use your right eye for the patient’s right eye and
vice versa, Look for the shape, colour and size of the cup
• Follow each of the 4 main vessels to the periphery
• Examine the macula by asking the patient to look directly at the light
• Examine the peripheral retina by asking the patient to look up, down
0 Dilating the pupils with a short-acting mydriatic (e.g. 0.5–1% tropicamide) makes examination much easier, but warn patients they may have
temporarily blurred vision and should not drive home.
Visual fields Test peripheral vision by sitting in front of the patient and
comparing their visual field to your own (1 eye at a time)—the most
basic test is to check the patient can see hand movement in each of the 4
quadrants. Refer for formal tests. Visual field defects— b p. 971.
Eye movements If the patient complains of double vision, move an
object to the nine positions of gaze (see Figure 26.1). Ask the patient to
tell you in which direction the double vision increases.
Pupils Should be round, central, of equal size, and respond equally to
light and accommodation Pupil abnormalities:
• Horner’s syndrome b p. 300
• Fixed dilated pupil Causes: trauma (e.g. blow to the iris), mydriatic
drops, acute glaucoma, third nerve palsy

Assessment of the eye

• Afferent pupillary defect Pupils are the same size but there is a d in
constriction response to light in the affected eye. Shine a bright light
in the better eye for 3s, then move it rapidly to the affected eye. If
the afferent pathway is d, the first pupil movement is dilation not
constriction. Causes: optic neuritis, retinal disease
• Argyll Robertson pupil Bilateral small irregular pupils with no light
response. Occurs in patients with DM or neurosyphilis. D. Argyll
Robertson (1837–1909)—Scottish ophthalmologist
• Holmes–Adie pupil Accommodation is partially paralysed, causing blurring
of near vision, slight pupil dilation, and a very slow pupil response to
light and accommodation (minutes). Occurs unilaterally in young adults
and is not associated with serious neurological disease. G.M. Holmes
(1876–1965)—Irish neurologist; W.J. Adie (1886–1935)—British neurologist

Eye trauma
In all cases
• Take a careful history; establish the nature of the trauma (i.e. what hit
the eye and with what force?)
•	Measure acuity and examine both eyes carefully recording your findings
• If the patient is unable to open the injured eye, try to instill local
anaesthetic drops and then examine—if unable to do so, refer to eye
casualty for assessment
• Encourage accident prevention, e.g. wearing protective goggles

Corneal abrasion
• Take a careful history to exclude high-speed particles, (e.g. from
strimmer) that could cause penetrating injury
• Abrasions may cause severe pain—if so apply a few drops of local
anaesthetic (e.g. proxymetacaine 0.5%) before examining
• Use fluorescein stain, with cobalt blue light illumination to detect
abrasion—stains green (see Figure 26.4)
• If the abrasion is vertical, ensure no foreign body is left in the eye by
everting the upper lid
• Abrasions normally heal in <48h; advise chloramphenicol 0.5% eye
drops qds until healing is complete
• Eye padding is not needed except to protect the eye after a local anaesthetic
Superficial foreign bodies Cause discomfort, a ‘foreign body
sensation’, and watering. They can be difficult to see so examine very
carefully (see Figure 26.5), including everting the eyelids. The foreign body
sensation may come from an abrasion.
Management
• If metal or a penetrating injury is suspected, refer to eye casualty
• Superficial foreign bodies can be removed with a corner of clean card
after instilling local anaesthetic. If that fails or if you are not confident,
refer to eye casualty
• After removal, treat with topical antibiotics, e.g. chloramphenicol 0.5%
drops 2-hourly for 3d, then qds for 4d
• If left >12h, a rust ring may form around a metal foreign body—refer
to eye casualty for removal
Arc eye Due to corneal epithelial damage as a result of exposure to UV light.
Seen in welders, sunbed users, skiers, mountaineers, and sailors who do not
use adequate eye protection. Symptoms include severe eye pain, watering,
and blepharospasm a few hours after exposure.
Management Pad the eye and give analgesics and cyclopentolate 1% eye
drops bd (causes pupil dilation). Recovery should occur in <24h—if not
refer. Advise on suitable protective wear for future exposure.
Blunt injury Caused by fists, squash balls, etc. The result may be anything
from a ‘black eye’ to globe rupture. Globe rupture is usually obvious with a
wound and severely d vision. More minor injuries include subconjunctival
haemorrhage (b p. 967) or corneal abrasion.

Eye trauma

Refer urgently if
• Visual acuity is affected • Double vision
• Hyphaema—blood in the anterior chamber
• Lacerated conjunctiva
• Unable to see posterior limit of a subconjunctival haemorrhage—may
indicate orbital fracture
• Persistent pupil dilation—usually recovers spontaneously but may
indicate a torn iris
• Any signs of retinal damage (oedema, choroidal rupture), or
•	You cannot assess the eye, e.g. if lid swelling/pain prevents examination
‘Blow out’ fracture of the orbit Uncommon fracture due to blunt trauma
to the eye (e.g. squash ball injury). Can present with blurred or double vision
and pain on moving the eye. Signs: enophthalmos (often masked by swelling),
infraorbital nerve loss, and inability to look upwards due to trapping of
inferior rectus muscle. Refer for X-ray and assessment of eye trauma via A&E.
Penetrating wounds Refer urgently to eye casualty if penetrating injury is a
possibility, i.e. history of flying object or working with hammers, drills, lathes,
or chisels where a metal fragment may fly off. X-ray/CT scan can confirm
diagnosis and help locate the foreign body. Symptoms/signs:
• Wound may be tiny
• Eye is painful and waters
• Vision may initially be normal, or may be very poor, depending on the
size of the foreign body
• Photophobia, hyphaema, and/or pupil distortion
• Do not remove large foreign bodies (dart or knife) Support
the object with padding whilst transferring the patient supine to eye
casualty or A&E. Cover the other eye to prevent damage from conjugate
movement.
Chemical burns Can cause great damage—particularly alkali injuries.
Use topical anaesthetic (e.g. proxymetacaine 0.5%) before examining.
Hold the lids open, brush out any powder, and irrigate with large amounts
(1–2L) of clean saline or water immediately. Do not try to neutralize the
acid or alkali. Refer urgently to eye casualty.

Ophthalmology

Eye pain, papilloedema, and
orbital disease
Eye pain Consider:
• Painful conditions Corneal foreign body, keratitis, iritis, scleritis, acute
glaucoma, ophthalmic shingles, arc eye
• Gritty eye discomfort Conjunctivitis, entropion, trichiasis, dry eye,
episcleritis
• Pain on moving the eye Optic neuritis
• Referred pain Tension type headache, migraine, refractive error,
trigeminal neuralgia, ophthalmic shingles, giant cell arteritis, ocular
muscle imbalance, i ICP
• Photophobia Painful vision in normal light. 1 of the 3 principal
features of meningism associated with meningitis; discomfort in the
light can also be due to eye disease, e.g. conjunctivitis, and migraine
Papilloedema (see Figure 26.6). Causes:
• Optic neurtitis
• Intracranial SOL
• Disc infiltration, e.g. leukaemia
• Encephalitis
• Ischaemic optic neuropathy
• SAH
• Retinal venous obstruction
• Benign intracranial
•	Metabolic causes, e.g.
hypertension
hypocalcaemia
•	Malignant hypertension
• Refer suspected papilloedema for same-day specialist medical opinion.
Swelling around the eyes Oedema around the eyes gives the face a
bloated appearance. Swollen eyelids may partially close the eyes. In severe
cases the whole face becomes oedematous. Associated with nephrotic
syndrome, allergic reactions (e.g. pollen, dust, or insect bites), angiooedema, and periorbital cellulitis.
Exophthalmos The eyes protrude from the orbit and thus have a
staring appearance. Stand at the same level as the patient and look at the
patient’s eyes. There should be no white of the sclera visible below the
iris. If the eye is pushed forward, as in exophthalmos, white sclera is seen
below the iris and the patient can look upwards without moving his/her
eye-brows (distinguishes from lid retraction).
• Bilateral Caused by Graves’ disease (b p. 364)
• Unilateral Caused by Graves’ disease (b p. 364), orbital disease
(e.g. tumours, cellulitis); vascular disease, e.g. cavernous sinus
thrombosis, carotid-cavernous fistula; sinus disease (e.g. tumour)
Microphthalmios 1:1,000 live births. Small eyes. Associated
with Down’s syndrome and other genetic abnormalities.

Orbital inflammation
Preseptal cellulitis Infections of the upper lid may cause significant
swelling and redness around the eye. Typically affects children following
mild trauma. The eye is unaffected—infection is localized to skin and

Eye pain, papilloedema, and orbital disease

superficial tissues. Treat as localized cellulitis with oral antibiotics (e.g.
flucloxacillin). Monitor carefully as can progress to orbital cellulitis.
Orbital cellulitis Typically due to spread of infection from the paranasal sinuses.
Usually presents with pain, double/blurred vision, and general malaise. Signs:
fever, eyelid swelling, proptosis, and inability to move the eye. Severe cases can
lead to septicaemia, meningitis, and cavernous sinus thromboses. If suspected,
refer immediately to ophthalmology for IV antibiotics/surgical drainage.
Orbital tumours The eye is in a confined space within the orbit. Any i
in mass pushes the eye forwards. Symptoms/signs:
• Unilateral proptosis is tumour until proven otherwise
• Orbital pain—especially in rapidly growing malignant tumours
• Lid swelling/distortion
• Limitation of eye movements ± diplopia
• d visual acuity if involvement of optic nerve, retina, or vascular supply
• If suspected—refer for urgent ophthalmology opinion.
Tumours may be
• Primary Benign or malignant—any orbital structure may be involved,
e.g. lacrimal gland (carcinoma or adenoma); retina (retinoblastoma
in children, melanoma); optic nerve (neurofibroma, astrocytoma,
meningioma); lymphoid tissue (lymphoma); connective tissue
(rhabdomyosarcoma—rapid growing, causing proptosis, ocular
inflammation, and poor vision due to optic nerve involvement)
• Due to spread from adjacent structures, e.g. post-nasal space tumour
• Due to blood-borne metastases, e.g. breast, leukaemia,
neuroblastoma, Ewing’s sarcoma

Ophthalmology

Lid disease
Ingrowing lashes (trichiasis) Causes an irritable foreign body feeling
in the eye ± recurrent infection. In severe cases, the ingrowing lashes may
damage the cornea. Refer to ophthalmology.
Loss of eyelashes (madarosis) Usually due to blepharitis (b p. 964), in
which case the condition is bilateral and associated with other symptoms/signs
of blepharitis. Other causes include plucking/rubbing (may be unilateral or
bilateral), alopecia areata, and discoid lupus (scarring madarosis). Sometimes
no cause is found. Treat the cause if possible.
Depigmentation of the eyelashes (poliosis) Vitiligo can affect
the eyelids. There is usually a family history. Associated with other
autoimmune disease (e.g. thyroid disease) and Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada
syndrome (a rare disorder of ocular depigmentation associated with
chorioretinal disease, anterior uveitis ± tinnitus and meningism).
Entropion In-turning of the eyelids due to degenerative changes or
secondary to scarring. Most commonly affects the lower lid. i with age
(rare <40y). The eyelashes rub on the cornea and irritate the eye. Taping
the lower lid to the cheek can give temporary relief. If left untreated,
can cause corneal vascularization, ulceration, and infection. Refer for rapid
surgical correction.
Ectropion Turning out of the lower eyelid. Causes eye irritation and
watering. Most common in the elderly or those with facial nerve palsy
(b p. 538). Refer for surgery.
Ptosis From the Greek meaning ‘to fall’, ptosis describes drooping of
the upper eyelid. When the normal eye is looking straight forwards, the
margin of the upper lid is situated ~2mm above the pupil. Ask the patient
to look downwards as far as possible and then upwards as far as possible.
The lid margin should move >8mm. The lid margin moves <4mm in
patients with severe ptosis. Treat the cause where possible. To determine
the cause, look at the pupil:
• Dilated pupil Oculomotor nerve palsy—refer urgently to neurology
• Constricted pupil Horner’s syndrome
• Normal pupil Old age, congenital, myasthenia gravis, muscular
dystrophy, myopathy, botulism
Congenital ptosis Unilateral/bilateral weakness of the levator muscle. Children may compensate by tilting their heads
upwards to see better. ~50% have associated superior rectus
muscle weakness. Refer for surgical correction if obstructing vision as
may cause amblyopia.
Neurological causes of ptosis
• Oculomotor (3rd nerve palsy) Often ptosis is complete if the pupil is
dilated. Refer urgently to neurology to exclude cerebral haemorrhage
or tumourN
• Horner’s syndrome b p. 300
• Tabes dorsalis s to syphilis

Lid disease

Muscular and mechanical causes of ptosis
• Senile Most common cause of ptosis—due to age-related changes in
the levator muscle. Refer if causing problems
• Myasthenia gravis b p. 963
• Muscular dystrophy, e.g. myotonic or oculopharyngeal dystrophy
• Myopathy, e.g. Graves’ disease
• Mechanical Swelling of the eyelid due to allergy or mass effect of tumour

Causes of localized eyelid swelling

•

Stye
• Chalazion
• Sebaceous cyst
Papilloma
• Xanthelasma
•	Marginal cyst of Zeis/Moll
Dermoid cyst—usually upper inner and outer angles of the orbit
BCC (rodent ulcer)—usually at the lid margin
Lacrimal gland and lacrimal sac disorders (b p. 965)

Stye Common eyelid infection. 2 forms:
External stye (hordeolum externum) Most common form of stye.
Infection of a lash follicle or associated gland of Moll (sweat gland) or Zeis
(sebum gland) usually by Staphylococcus aureus. Confined to the skin and
always points outwards. Treat with hot compresses and oral or topical
antibiotics (e.g. chloramphenicol ointment)
Internal stye (hordeolum internum) Abscess of a meibomian gland.
Often causes less swelling than external stye. May point inwards onto
the conjunctiva (seen as red patch with yellow centre before it bursts) or
outwards through the skin. Treat in the same way as external stye with hot
compresses and oral or topical antibiotics.
Marginal cyst of Zeis or Moll Non-infected swellings of the glands of Zeis/
Moll. No treatment needed unless troublesome when refer.
Chalazion/Meibomian cyst Following an internal stye, the Meibomian
gland may become blocked forming a cyst. Cysts may resolve spontaneously
but often become infected (treat with topical antibiotics) and/or chronic.
If recurrent infection or chronic cyst refer to ophthalmology for incision
and curettage. 0 Refer early if <7y as large cysts can affect refraction and
generate amblyopia.
Squamous cell papilloma Benign skin tumour—which may form a
horn-like lesion. Refer for excision/curettage.

Blepharitis and tear duct problems
Blepharitis Chronic, low-grade, inflammation of meibomian glands and
lid margins. Presents with long history of irritable, burning, dry, red eyes.
Eyelids have red margins ± scales on the eyelashes (see Figure 26.7). On
elevation of the upper lid, look for inflamed meibomian glands. Associated
with dry eyes, internal stye (b p. 963), and ingrowing eyelashes.
Differential diagnosis Lid papilloma and warts can become inflamed and
mimic blepharitis.
Management Prolonged treatment over 2–3mo with regular eye
care 3x/wk is needed. Warn patients to persevere as there may be no
improvement for up to 2wk:
1. Warmth Apply a facial sauna, microwaveable EyeBag® or hot, moist
flannel to the eyes for 5–10min. This is to open the skin pores and
meibomian glands. The face should be red after heating.
2. Massage Press on the eyelids with a cotton bud to release the
meibomian gland secretions—these are seen as thin curly lines.
Pressure should not be too light, nor firm enough to cause discomfort.
3. Clean With the eyes gently closed, use diluted tea-tree oil baby
shampoo (10 parts water to 1 part baby shampoo) on a cotton bud
to rub along the eyelashes for 15–20s, top and bottom. Clean any
remaining shampoo from the lids with a clean facecloth using clear,
warm water. Alternatives to baby shampoo include bicarbonate of
soda solution or sterile, impregnanted Lid-Care® wipes.
After an initial treatment period, it is often necessary to continue to use
warm compresses and lid scrubs from time to time to keep the lid scales
under control. Treat dry eye symptoms with preservative-free tear supplements, e.g. Liquifilm Tears®.
Exacerbations Treat with topical antibiotics (place a 1cm strip of fucithalmic or
chloramphenicol ointment onto a clean finger and rub it into the base of the
eyelashes). Oral antibiotics (e.g. doxycycline 50mg od) for 3mo may be useful
for patients not responding to lid care and topical antibiotics. Topical steroid
drops or ointment may sometimes be useful but use only on specialist advice.

Figure 26.7 Scaling on the eyelashes in blepharitis

Blepharitis and tear duct problems

Dry eye syndrome (keratoconjunctivitis sicca) Tear secretion d
with age. Dry eyes cause eye irritation and redness which is often worse
in centrally heated buildings. The eye feels gritty, vision is occasionally
blurred, and there is reflex watering of the eye in severe cases. Commonly
associated with blepharitis.
Causes d tear production (e.g. age, Sjögren’s syndrome); i evaporation
of tears (e.g. exposure keratitis).
Management
• Treat with artificial tears, e.g. Viscotears®, Hylo-Care® Liquifilm Tears® . If
one preparation does not work, try another. Always use preservative-free
drops—hypersensitivity can be a problem with prolonged use
• Treat any associated lid disease, e.g. blepharitis
• If simple medication fails try combined short- and long-acting drops,
e.g. Liquifilm Tears® tds and Celluvisc® tds
• Refer to ophthalmology if continuing symptoms despite treatment
0 Longer acting drops, (e.g. Celluvisc®, Viscotears®) blur vision for a
time. Short-acting drops (e.g. Liquifilm Tears®) only give relief for ~30min
and may need very frequent application.
Watering eyes (epiphoria) Due to overproduction of tears or outflow obstruction. Caused by corneal irritation (e.g. blepharitis, dry eyes,
corneal abrasion, foreign body, conjunctivitis, entropion), iritis, acute glaucoma, ectropion, blocked tear duct.
Acute dacryocystitis Acute infection of the tear sac, can spread to
surrounding tissues. Treat immediately with antibiotics, e.g. flucloxacillin.
Abscess can form—if it does surgical drainage is required so refer.
Chronic dacryocystitis Seen in the middle-aged and elderly. Presents
with a watery eye which discharges mucus regularly. The eye does not
look inflamed. Refer for syringing of the lacrimal system or surgery.
Infantile dacryocystitis (blocked tear duct) Delay in
canalization/obstruction of the lacrimal duct causing persistent
watering or sticky eyes in 20% babies. Vision is normal and there
is no conjunctival inflammation. If the lower lid conjunctiva is reddened,
swab to exclude chlamydia (b p. 740).
Management Advise parents to bathe the lids with cooled boiled water.
Avoid antibiotic eye drops unless there is clear infection. Spontaneous
resolution is the norm. 4% fail to clear by 1y—refer to a paediatric
ophthalmologist. Treatment is by probing the duct to clear it.

The red eye and conjunctivitis
• ‘Red flag’ signs of a potentially dangerous red eye
• d visual acuity
• Pain deep in the eye—not surface irritation as with conjunctivitis
• Absent or sluggish pupil response
• Corneal damage on fluorescein staining
•	History of trauma
Refer the patient to be seen by a specialist the same day.
Differential diagnosis Think systematically about the structures within
the eye to come to a differential diagnosis—see Table 26.2.
Conjunctivitis Inflammation of the conjunctiva is the most common eye
problem seen in general practice (see Figure 26.8)—1 in 8 children have an
episode of acute infective conjunctivitis every year. Presents with unlateral/
bilateral red eye with surface irritation; eye discharge (clear, mucoid, or
muco-purulent); sticking of the eyelids, especially on waking; no change
in visual acuity. Examination may reveal enlarged papillae under the upper
eyelid and/or pre-auricular lymph node enlargement.
Bacterial or viral conjunctivitis Clinically difficult to distinguish—doctors get
it right only ~50% of the time. Both present with acute red eye—usually
starting in one eye and often spreading to involve both, together with watery/
purulent discharge. The eyes are often crusted ± stuck together on waking.
Visual acuity is not impaired. Both may occur in association with viral URTI.
Management of acute infective conjunctivitis
• Usually self-limiting condition; 65% settle in 2–5d without treatment;
advise patients to bathe the affected eye(s) with boiled, cooled water
morning and night, avoid contact lens use, and use simple hygiene,
measures (e.g. hand washing and not using shared towels)
• If symptoms are not improving in 3–5d, review the diagnosis
and consider treatment with topical chloramphenicol qds for 5d
0 Chloramphenicol is available OTC.
• Advise patients to seek medical advice if: d visual acuity, eye becomes
painful rather than sore/gritty, significant photophobia, eyelid swelling,
or symptoms are not improving in 5d.
Allergic conjunctivitis Bilateral symptoms appear seasonally (e.g. hay fever)
or on contact with an allergen (e.g. animal fur). Presents with red, watery,
itchy eyes ± photophobia ± family/personal history of atopy. Signs: follicles
in the lower tarsal conjunctiva and ‘cobblestones’ under the upper lid.
Management of allergic conjunctivitis Treat with topical or systemic
antihistamines (e.g. sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil, or olopatadine eye
drops). Avoid topical steroids due to long-term complications (cataract,
glaucoma, fungal infection). Consider cold compress and washout with
cold water during acute exacerbations. Refer if symptoms are persistent
despite treatment, or if vision is affected.

Pterygium Common (see Figure 26.10). Found particularly in people
who work outdoors in hot, dusty climates. Creamy coloured raised
triangular plaque on the conjunctiva on either side of the cornea—nasal
side > temporal side. No need to treat unless encroaching over the
pupil and causing visual loss l refer for surgical excision—recurrence
is possible. 0 Differential diagnosis is carcinoma in situ—if any atypical
features, refer for excision biopsy.

Figure 26.10 Pterygium
Corneal vascularization Growth of blood vessels onto the cornea.
Occurs in patients with severe lid disease, rosacea, or due to excessive
contact lens wear. If a contact lens wearer, advise to remove contact
lenses for at least 2mo. Refer to ophthalmology for specialist management
to prevent long-term damage.

Keratitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and corneal ulceration
• Keratitis is inflammation of the cornea
• Keratoconjunctivitis is inflammation of the conjunctiva and cornea
Presentation Presents with a very painful eye, blurred vision, photophobia,
and profuse watering. On examination there is d visual acuity, circumcorneal
injection (blood vessel dilatation concentrated around the limbus),
conjunctivitis (particularly the quadrant most associated with the injury/
infection) ± a creamy white, disc-shaped lesion on the central or inferior
cornea. The pupil may be small due to reflex miosis. Corneal ulcers stain
green with fluorescein—use a bright light with a blue filter to see them.
Causes Bacterial—s to trauma, foreign body, dry eyes, entropion,
blepharitis; viral—herpes simplex, herpes zoster, or adenovirus; fungal;
protozoal—history of foreign travel/contact lens wear; non-infective, e.g.
s to autoimmune disease or trauma.
Management Treatment depends on cause. Delay in treatment may
result in loss of sight so refer for same-day ophthalmology assessment.
Herpes simplex infection and dendritic ulcer HSV keratitis is common and can be recurrent in the same eye with the virus lying dormant
within the trigeminal nerve between attacks. Presents with acute keratitis
or keratoconjunctivitis. Occasionally may present as an irritable eye with

Corneal, sclera, and uveal disease

little discomfort. Examination and fluorescein staining reveal a characteristic corneal ulcer with a delicate branching pattern (dendritic ulcer).
Refer for urgent (same-day) ophthalmology opinion. Treatment is with 3%
aciclovir ointment 5x/d continued for 3d after healing.
• There is a danger of massive amoebic ulceration and blindness if steroid eye drops are administered to patients with dendritic ulcer.
Ophthalmic shingles Zoster in the ophthalmic branch of the
oculomotor (3rd) nerve. Pain, tingling, or numbness around the eye
precedes a blistering rash and inflammation. In 50% the eye is affected
with conjunctivitis, scleritis, episcleritis, keratitis, iritis, visual loss, and/or
oculomotor nerve palsy. Nose tip involvement makes eye involvement
likely (nerve supply is the same as the globe). Prescribe oral aciclovir
(800mg 5x/d) and refer immediately. The cornea may become anaesthetic/
scarred and require grafting.
Episcleritis The episclera is the thin layer of vascular tissue overlying
the sclera. Episcleritis is unilateral in two-thirds of cases. It presents with
diffuse inflammation of the eye with minimal tenderness and no discharge.
Try treatment with an NSAID (e.g. ibuprofen 400mg tds or ketorolac
0.5% eye drops qds). If NSAID is ineffective, refer to ophthalmology for
consideration of treatment with steroids.
Scleritis Inflammation of the sclera. Can be unilateral or bilateral. 5 >
4. Peak age: 40–60y. Affects the anterior or posterior segment and may
be diffuse, nodular, or necrotizing. Presents with painful, red eye. Vision
may be blurred due to corneal, iris, or posterior segment involvement, and
visual acuity d. The eye is tender to touch and may have a deep purple
hue. Look for scleral nodules. There may be accompanying uveitis and
keratitis.
Associations In ~50%, associated with systemic illness, e.g. herpes zoster,
rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa,
Wegener’s granulomatosis, trauma, infection, or surgery.
Management Refer urgently to ophthalmology. Treated with steroids.
Complications include cataract, glaucoma, and retinal detachment.
Iritis (anterior uveitis) Most common in young/middle-aged adults.
Acute onset of pain, photo-phobia, blurred vision and d visual acuity,
watering, circumcorneal redness, small or irregular pupil ± keratitic
precipitates on the posterior surface of the cornea ± hypopyon (anterior
chamber pus, causing a white ‘fluid level’ line). Pain i as eyes converge
and pupils constrict. May be secondary to corneal graft rejection or eye
infections, e.g. toxoplasmosis, herpes virus keratitis. In 30% associated with
seronegative arthropathies, e.g. ankylosing spondylitis.
Management Refer urgently to ophthalmology. Complications include
posterior synechiae (irregular pupil shape), glaucoma, and cataract.
Relapses are common.

Ophthalmology

Visual field loss and blindness
Visual field loss Not all patients who have a visual field loss are aware
of it. 0 If you suspect visual field loss, refer to a community optometrist
or ophthalmology for formal field testing. Causes: see Figure 26.11.
Blindness Is defined as inability to perform any work for which eyesight
is essential (not the total absence of sight). In practice this means <3/60
vision (may be >3/60 if patient has severe visual field defect, e.g. glaucoma).
157,000 people are registered blind in England.
Partial sightedness Does not have a standard definition but usually
implies vision in the range 3/60—6/60; 155,000 people are registered
partially sighted in England.
Major causes of blindness in the UK
• Elderly Macular degeneration; glaucoma
• Younger patients Diabetic retinopathy; uveitis; inherited retinal
disease; retinovascular disease
0 Worldwide, cataract, glaucoma, and chlamydial infection causing trachoma are common causes.
Registration of blindness and partial sight Voluntary in England. Refer
patients for low vision assessment. Application is made by a consultant
ophthalmologist to social services.
Support Many patients benefit from links with national support
organizations that provide information, and active local organizations who
support the blind and partially sighted with drivers and guides.
Driving b p. 129

Colour blindness
Congenital colour blindness Inherited as a sex-linked characteristic. 4:5
≈20:1. The Ishihara test consists of series of cards with a number in
coloured dots against a contrasting background of more coloured dots.
Coloured dots are paired to detect different patterns of colour blindness.
Lack of red/green discrimination is most common. Colour blindness
prohibits certain types of employment (e.g. airline pilot).
Impaired colour recognition Occurs later in life. Red is the most common
colour affected. May be an early sign of an optic nerve disorder. Patients
complain of colour looking ‘washed out’ (desaturated) in one eye compared to the other—refer.

Description and causes

Bilateral
homonymous
hemianopia (1)

Normal eyes; normal pupillary responses; no conscious
vision (cortical blindness) Cause: bilateral damage to the
visual cortex—usually CVA

Homonymous
hemianopia (1)

Half the visual field is affected symmetrically in both eyes.
Macular fibres may be preserved (macular sparing) if the
posterior cerebral artery is functional. Cause: strokes
involving the middle cerebral artery

Quadrantanopia (2)

Loss of a homonymous (symmetrical) quadrant of vision
indicates temporal lobe disease with superior defect and
parietal lobe disease with inferior loss. Causes: vascular
events, tumours, trauma

Bitemporal
hemianopia (3)

The temporal side of the visual field is affected in both
eyes. If one nerve is completely affected, a junctional
scotoma results. Causes: compressive chiasmal lesions,
e.g. pituitary tumour, craniopharyngioma, or meningioma

Altitudinal defect (4)

Field defect respecting the horizontal. Cause: optic nerve
disease, e.g. optic neuropathy, optic neuritis

Enlarged blind
spot (4)

Blind spot is enlarged if the optic disc is enlarged. Causes:
papilloedema, disc inflammation, infiltration with lymphoma

Central scotoma (4)

Loss of central vision with normal visual field around it.
May be unilateral or bilateral
• Bilateral causes toxic (e.g. tobacco), B12 deficiency, MS,
age-related macular degeneration, inherited
• Unilateral causes glioma of optic nerve, vascular lesion

Tunnel vision

Loss of peripheral vision in all directions. Causes: glaucoma,
retinitis pigmentosa, retinal detachment, functional visual
loss (visual fields having no anatomical correspondence)

Loss of vision from
one eye

Due to lesions of the retina or optic nerve anterior to
the optic chiasm. Causes: retinal detachment, retinal vein
occlusion, optic neuropathy, infiltration of the nerve,
demyelination, compression of the nerve

Ophthalmology

Sudden loss of vision in one eye
• Always refer as an emergency to ophthalmology—unless you are
certain it is migraine or stroke.

Causes of sudden loss of vision covered elsewhere
• Acute glaucoma (b p. 977)
•	Migraine (b p. 554)
• Stroke/amaurosis fugax (b p. 562) • Temporal arteritis (b p. 524)
• Wet AMD (rapid rather than sudden loss of vision— b p. 974)
Retinal vein occlusion Incidence i with age. More common than
arterial occlusion. Presents with:
• Sudden loss of vision in one eye—typically on waking (branch retinal
vein occlusion causes partial visual loss) ± afferent pupil defect
• Fundus like ‘a stormy sunset’—scattered haemorrhages, engorged
veins, disc swelling ± cotton wool spots
• ~90d after retinal vein occlusion, the eye may become painful due to
neovascular glaucoma
Causes
• Glaucoma
• i BP
•	Hypercholesterolaemia
• Arteriosclerosis
• Polycythaemia • i homocysteine
Management Refer as an emergency to ophthalmology. Laser treatment
may prevent neovascular glaucoma and vitreous haemorrhage due to
retinal neovascularization. Macular oedema may be helped by intraocular
steroids or intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication
(e.g. bevacizumab or ranibizumab).
Retinal artery occlusion Usually due to thromboembolism. Sudden
visual loss in one eye (counting fingers or light perception) and afferent pupil
defect. The retina appears white ± cherry red spot at the macula. A retinal
embolus may be visible. Exclude temporal arteritis (b p. 524).
• If the patient presents <1h after onset Applying then releasing firm
eyeball pressure can sometimes dislodge an embolus into one of the
smaller branches and thus preserve some vision.
Management Refer as an emergency to ophthalmology. There is no
reliable treatment. Optic atrophy and blindness is the usual outcome. Treat
any risk factors for atherosclerosis or embolism, i.e. i BP, hyperlipidaemia,
smoking, DM, carotid/cardiac disease.
Vitreous haemorrhage Presents with sudden d in vision, loss of red
reflex, and difficulty visualizing the retina. Risk factors: DM with new vessel
formation, bleeding disorders, retinal tear/detachment, central retinal vein
occlusion, trauma, head injury, tumour. Refer urgently to ophthalmology.
Treatment is with vitrectomy and repair of retinal damage with laser- or
cryotherapy.
Retinal detachment Affects 1:7,000 people each year. Presents with:
• Painless loss of vision—‘like a curtain’ coming across the vision
• Rate of detachment can vary. Upper retinal detachments tend to occur
more quickly—causing loss of lower part of vision

Sudden loss of vision in one eye

• 50% have premonitory symptoms—flashing lights or floaters before
eyes due to abnormal retinal stimulation prior to the detachment
• If the macula is detached central vision is lost and may not completely
recover—even after retinal reattachment
• Examination reveals visual field loss (± central visual loss), afferent
pupil defect, and a grey retina which may balloon forwards
Causes
• After cataract surgery • Retinopathy of prematurity
• Idiopathic
•	Myopia
• Inherited eye disease
• Trauma
• DM
Management Refer urgently for treatment to secure the retina.
Floaters Small dark spots in the visual field usually caused by opacities
in the vitreous. Floaters continue to move when the eye comes to rest.
Risk factors: myopia, cataract operation, trauma. Usually harmless and may
settle with time but patients may benefit from vitrectomy if floaters are
interfering with vision (e.g. preventing reading).
• Sudden showers of floaters in one eye ± flashing lights can indicate
retinal detachment which may be difficult to see on examination. Floaters
associated with eye pain/inflammation may indicate posterior uveitis.
General rules for referral
• If long-standing floaters/flashes, then no need for referral
• If symptoms are of recent onset (<6wk) and no other symptoms, refer
urgently to ophthalmology outpatients
• If symptoms are of recent onset (<6wk) and associated with any
visual field loss, d acuity, or pain/inflammation of the eye, refer as an
ophthalmology emergency
Optic neuritis Disc swelling due to inflammation or demyelination.
Presents with rapid visual loss (hours to days) and d colour vision (red
desaturation); discomfort on eye movements; temporary worsening of
symptoms when hot; optic disc swelling. Refer urgently to ophthalmology
for confirmation of diagnosis. Steroids may help in severe cases. Visual loss
usually stabilizes after week 2 and recovers over 6wk.
Causes Multiple sclerosis (1:4 patients with MS present with optic
neuritis—b p. 568); DM; viral infections, e.g. influenza, measles,
chickenpox; familial, e.g. Leber’s disease.
Anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (ANION) Occurs when the
short ciliary arteries are damaged. 2 forms:
• Arteritic Due to arterial inflammation (e.g. temporal arteritis, SLE)
• Non-arteritic Results from arterial emboli
Presentation Central vision drops suddenly and irreversibly. Examination
reveals a complete or altitudinal visual field defect. The disc appears
swollen and pale ± haemorrhages. May be accompanied by symptoms of
the underlying condition (e.g. temporal arteritis—b p. 524).
Management Refer as an ophthalmology emergency. Treatment depends
on cause.

Ophthalmology

Gradual loss of vision
Causes of gradual loss of vision covered elsewhere
• Chronic glaucoma (b p. 976)
• Cataract (b p. 978)
• Diabetic retinopathy (b p. 352)
Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) Most common cause of
blindness in the UK—2% of people >65y old are blind in one or both
eyes due to AMD. Always a bilateral disease but one eye is usually more
severely affected than the other. Risk factors: i age, +ve family history,
smoking, i BP.
Presentation Difficult to detect in primary care. Signs are often minimal.
Symptoms:
• In all cases, there is deterioration/distortion of central vision—affects
reading/face recognition first—worse with changes in lighting
• A dark patch that rapidly fades may be noticed on waking—can be
interpreted as ‘seeing a shadowy figure’ and be very frightening
• With severe visual loss patients may see visual hallucinations—usually
of faces or stars. These can also be very frightening
Dry (geographic) AMD All patients start with this form of AMD. Caused
by atrophy of the neuroretina. The cells of the macula break down,
resulting in drusen formation (yellowish lipid deposits). As number/size of
drusen i, central vision d.
Wet AMD Accounts for 50% of blindness due to AMD. In some patients
with dry AMD, drusen lifts the retinal pigment epithelium away from its
blood supply. New blood vessels grow from the choroid and may bleed
forming scars l irreversible loss of central vision.
Management If progressive loss of vision, refer to ophthalmology for
confirmation of diagnosis—urgently if recent onset or rapid d in vision.
For those with dry AMD and loss of vision, treatment with AREDS2 food
supplement (containing omega-3 fatty acids, antioxidants, and zinc) d
progression by 25%R. Treatment of other coexisting conditions (e.g.
cataract and glaucoma) can also help. Provision of visual aids, registration
of blindness and social support are important.
Aflibercept Is a monoclonal antibody to the vascular growth factor that
stimulates new vessel growth. It is approved as an effective treatment
by NICE for the treatment of patients with active wet AMD and visual
symptoms. It is only administered in secondary care settings. Injections
are given into the eye 1x/mo for 3mo with further injections thereafter,
titrated against disease activation. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab are
alternatives.
Central serous retinopathy (CSR) Typically occurs in hypermetropic
middle-aged patients. Vision is blurred and distorted particularly for
reading. The cause is a serous leakage of fluid from abnormal choroidal
vessels. The condition is generally self-limiting but can be bilateral and
chronic. Refer to ophthalmology for photodynamic therapy.
Macular hole Typically 5 in mid-60s. Presents with gradual central visual
loss/distortion and colour loss. If it occurs in the non-dominant eye, the

Gradual loss of vision

patient may be relatively asymptomatic. Refer to ophthalmology. Vision
takes 4–12mo to recover following treatment.
Macular dystrophies Several inherited retinal diseases (e.g. Best’s
disease; Stargardt’s macular dystrophy; Bull’s eye maculopathy) present
with progressive loss of central vision either in early adulthood or aged
40–60y. Ask if there is a history of visual loss in a family.
Retinitis pigmentosa Familial disorder resulting in retinal degeneration.
Usually first noticed in adolescence and progresses to blindness. 2 forms
exist—the autosomal dominant form is more common than the autosomal
recessive form and milder.
• Symptoms Night blindness, loss of visual field, difficulty in light
adaptation, gradual loss of central vision
• Signs Black pigment flecks in the retina, optic atrophy, attenuated
blood vessels
Epiretinal membrane Presents with distortion and blurred central
vision, particularly for near vision. Associated with previous peripheral
vascular disease, retinal detachment/break, branch retinal vein occlusion,
uveitis, trauma, or tumour. Refer to ophthalmology for vitrectomy and
membrane peel.
Optic atrophy Signs: gradual visual loss; pale optic disc. Causes:
glaucoma, MS, ischaemia (e.g. retinal artery occlusion), retinal damage
(choroiditis, retinitis pigmentosa), toxic (tobacco amblyopia, methanol,
arsenic, quinine). Refer for confirmation of diagnosis to ophthalmology
or neurology.
Compressive lesions of the optic pathway (e.g. meningioma, glioma,
abscess, arteriovenous malformation). Can cause visual field defects—
type depends on the site of the lesion—b p. 971

Uveal and retinal tumours
Melanoma Most common tumour affecting the eye. Usually detected
during routine examination by an optometrist. Other presentations
include gradual central visual loss and/or retinal detachment. Can affect
the iris, ciliary body, or choroids. Refer for urgent ophthalmology opinion.
Secondaries Metastasis to the eye can occur from tumours of the breast,
lung, or kidney. Appear as pale elevations of the choroid. Symptoms are
variable but include visual loss and retinal detachment. Refer urgently for
confirmation of diagnosis.

Ophthalmology

Glaucoma
Chronic simple glaucoma (open-angle) (COAG) Common. Affects
~2% of all >40y olds. Accounts for ~1:4 ophthalmology outpatient
appointments and 10% of new blindness registrations.
Risk factors
• i intraocular pressure (IOP) >21mmHg—the major risk factor—but
30% of newly diagnosed glaucoma patients have ‘normal’ pressure
• Abnormal BP (i in elderly)
• Family history (i risk x10)
•	Myopia
• i age
• i plasma viscosity
• Black race
0 Steroid use (systemic or topical in or close to the eye) can cause i
intraocular pressure.
Presentation May be detected during routine optometrist examination
or through routine screening for diabetics or patients with family
history. Otherwise patients present late as glaucoma is asymptomatic
and visual acuity is preserved until visual fields are severely impaired.
Signs: optic nerve damage (glaucomatous disc cupping), visual field loss
(sausage-shaped blind spots), and i intraocular pressure.
Variants
• Ocular hypertension i intraocular pressure with no field loss
• Normal tension glaucoma Field loss, disc cupping but normal
intraocular pressure
Management Advise all patients >40y to have regular optometry
check-ups. Those with a family history of glaucoma should have biannual
checks of their intraocular pressures (tonometry) and annual visual field
checks at an optician from 40y of age. Refer patients with i pressures, or
in whom you notice (or are doubtful about) disc cupping to ophthalmology
for assessment. Patients with i intraocular pressure must be followed up
life-long. Aim is to d intraocular pressure to slow disease progression
(even with ‘normal’ pressures).
Medical treatment
• Topical prostaglandin analogue (e.g. latanoprost od in the evening)—
i outflow of aqueous
• Topical β-blocker (e.g. timolol 0.25% bd)—d aqueous secretion.
Caution in patients with asthma or heart failure. Often combined with
a topical prostaglandin analogue. Side effects: allergy and dry eyes
• Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (e.g. dorzolamide tds, or bd if
in combination with a β-blocker)—d aqueous secretion. Side effects:
blurred vision, tiredness, dyspepsia
• Topical α-agonist (e.g. brimonidine bd)—d aqueous secretion and
i outflow. Side effects: local reactions, headache, dry mouth, tiredness
Surgery Trabeculectomy is considered when the ‘target’ intraocular
pressure is not met with medical treatment (especially in patients <50y).
Side effects: failure, worsening cataract.

Glaucoma

Acute angle closure glaucoma (AACG) Uncommon. Affects 0.1% of
patients >40y—typically elderly, long-sighted women with early cataract.
Closed-angle glaucoma may present in one of 3 ways:
• Latent Usually picked up when screening the opposite eye after an
episode of acute/subacute glaucoma. The patient is asymptomatic and
IOP normal, but the anterior chamber is shallow with a narrow angle.
• Subacute Episodic haloes around bright lights, impaired vision ± frontal
headache/eye pain. Attacks are precipitated by the pupil dilating, e.g. at
night or entering a darkened room, and relieved by sleep or entering
a brighter environment. Examination between attacks is normal but
during an attack, the pupil is semi-dilated and cornea slightly clouded.
Patients with subacute glaucoma are at risk of an acute attack
• Acute Blockage of aqueous drainage from the anterior chamber causes
a sudden i in IOP from 15–20 to 60–70mmHg. There may be a history
of previous subacute attacks. The patient complains of eye pain with
acute loss of vision in 1 eye ± abdominal pain/nausea/vomiting
Examination Vision d; cornea looks hazy (due to oedema); pupil is fixed
and dilated (often slightly oval in shape with long axis vertical); circumcorneal
redness; eyeball feels hard (due to i pressure); poor fundal view ± cataract.
Management Refer acute or subacute glaucoma as an emergency to
ophthalmology. Specialist treatment is with miosis to open drainage
channels (e.g. pilocarpine 4% drops) and acetazolamide ± apraclonidine and/
or latanoprost drops to d aqueous production. Surgery or laser treatment
(peripheral iridotomy) to allow free aqueous circulation is undertaken once
intraocular pressure has been d. Patient may need prophylactic surgery
on the contralateral eye to prevent AACG in that eye too. AACG may
damage the trabecular meshwork and patients are at risk of developing
chronic glaucoma following an attack. Regular check-ups are necessary.
Neovascular or secondary glaucoma May occur in patients with
diabetic retinopathy, central or branch retinal vein obstruction, or ocular
ischaemia. Blood vessels grow across the iris and the iridiocorneal angle,
preventing fluid drainage. Pressures can be very high (40–70mmHg) and the
patient may suffer pain from corneal oedema. Treatment is surgical and, in
severe cases, if the eye is blind, it is removed.
Congenital glaucoma 1:10,000 live births. 4 > 5. Usually
bilateral. Presents with irritation of the eye (watering, rubbing),
photophobia, large eyes with large, fixed pupils ± cloudy cornea. Refer urgently for paediatric ophthalmic opinion. Surgery is needed
to prevent blindness.

takes 2–6wk depending on the technique used. 75–95% without other
ocular pathology have 6/12 vision or better 3mo post-op. Patients require
testing for new spectacles 6wk post-op to allow refractive changes to
settle.
Complications of cataract surgery
• Intraocular infection (endophthalmitis)—rare (0.1%); presents with
pain and blurred vision ± red eye ± tenderness. Refer back to the
operating surgeon urgently—antibiotics injected within 2–3h can
preserve vision. Delayed referral (>12h) will lead to blindness
• Posterior capsule rupture
• Broken or protruding sutures—cause sensation of a foreign body on
the cornea or pain—may need to be removed
• Vitreous haemorrhage
• Glaucoma
• Posterior capsule opacification (5–30% <5y post-op) symptoms are
similar to the original cataract; treatment is with laser therapy to
create a hole in the capsule
 
Management of childhood cataract Refer immediately to
ophthalmology.

Ophthalmology

Refractive errors and squint
Glasses check Look through the patient’s glasses:
• If image is magnified (prescription ‘+’)—the patient is long-sighted
• If image is reduced (prescription ‘–’)—the patient is short-sighted
Amblyopia (lazy eye) Poor vision in the absence of ocular or visual
pathway disorder. Squint, ptosis, cataract, unequal refractive errors, or
astigmatism can cause the image from one eye to be disregarded. If this
persists >7–8y of age, it becomes irreversible. Treatment is with glasses ±
patching, and squint surgery if necessary.

Refraction errors

Hypermetropia (long sight) Most common refractive error. Common
in infants and lessens with age. Distant objects focus behind the retina.
Ciliary muscle contraction (to make the lens more convex) is needed to
focus the image. This can lead to convergent squint, eye tiredness, and
headache. Convex lenses are used for correction.
Myopia (short sight) Distant objects focus in front of the retina. There is
often a +ve FH. Concave lenses are used to correct the defect. Contact
lenses may be necessary in high myopia (>–8 diopters). Myopia is unusual
<6y old and tends to worsen until the late teens. Regular (6-monthly)
eye checks are needed to ensure correct lenses are prescribed. In adults
increasing myopia can indicate developing cataracts. High myopia (8–20
diopters) predisposes to retinal detachment—these patients should have
an annual eye examination (more frequent if floaters).
Astigmatism Curvature across the cornea or lens differs in the vertical/
horizontal planes. Objects are distorted longitudinally or vertically. Lenses
can be used to correct this defect.
Presbyopia Age-related loss of accommodation. The lens becomes less
easy to deform from 45–65y. Focussing on close objects (accommodation)
is more difficult and glasses may be needed for near-work (e.g. reading).
Refractive procedures Increasingly being undertaken as an alternative
to spectacles. LASIK (Laser Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis) is a combination
of surgery and laser therapy. It can be used for higher degrees of refractive
error and astigmatism. Complications are rare.
Non-paralytic squint Abnormality of coordinated eye movement; 3% of
children have a congenital squint. Due to an imbalance in the muscles of the
eye; there is full range of eye movement in both eyes and no double vision.
Note the light reflexes from different parts of the cornea—they should be
symmetrical. If not, there is a squint. Squint may be convergent (esotropia)
or divergent (exotropia). Esotropia (see Figure 26.13) is most common and
often associated with long-sightedness.
Predisposing factors Family history of squint, high refractive errors, neurological
disease (e.g. cerebral palsy), cataract, Down’s syndrome, Turner’s syndrome,
retinoblastoma, optic atrophy, craniofacial anomalies, retinal disease.
Childhood screening for squint b p. 856

Refractive errors and squint

Figure 26.13 Esotropic squint
Management Refer to ophthalmology. Without treatment, children with
squint risk developing amblyopia, failure of binocular vision, and long-term visual
problems. Visual maturity occurs at 7–8y. Eye patching, correction of refractive
errors (spectacles), and realignment surgery can improve sight up to this age.
Paralytic squint Caused by damage to the extraocular muscles or the
nerves supplying them. Usually acquired and caused by cranial nerve palsy.
Results in diplopia—maximal when looking in the direction requiring the
action of the paralysed muscle. The image from the eye that is not moving
correctly is peripheral to the image from the normal eye. Refer for urgent
neurology/ophthalmology opinionN. Once sinister causes have been
excluded, management involves treatment of the underlying condition ±
patching and/or prism spectacles ± surgery.

Pseudosquint
• Wide epicanthic folds Give the appearance of a squint—corneal
reflections are symmetrical.
• Intermittent deviation of the eyes in neonates Common. Check red
reflex is present. Normally settles by 3mo—squint after this time is
significant. Refer.
Gaze palsy Inability to perform coordinated movements of the 2 eyes
together in the same direction. In all cases, refer to neurology—treatment
depends on cause (see Table 26.3).
•	Horizontal gaze palsy—loss of conjugate eye movements to one side
• Vertical gaze palsy—loss of conjugate eye movements upwards

Ophthalmology

Contact lenses and drugs for the eye
Contact lenses 20% are worn because they are more suitable for the
eye condition than spectacles, 80% for cosmetic/convenience reasons.
Some are worn just to change eye colour. Contact lenses are used in high
myopia or hypermetropia, presbyopia, and after cataract removal because
thick spectacle lenses cause visual field distortion. They are also useful
when the cornea has been damaged, e.g. after ulceration or trauma and in
keratoconus (a rare corneal degenerative disease).
Types of lens Hard, gas-permeable (larger hard lenses are designed to
allow air to reach the cornea), and soft lenses are available. Some soft lenses
are ‘daily disposable’ or ‘monthly disposable’. Hard and gas-permeable
lenses can correct for minor astigmatism; normal soft lenses cannot as
the lens is too flexible. A high astigmatism requires spectacles or a special
(toric) soft lens (delicate and needs careful cleaning). Patients with poor
tear secretion do not tolerate contact lenses well.
Care of lenses Careful cleaning of the lenses and contact lens container
is vital—particular solutions are used for each type of lens, and these
should not be interchanged. Contact lenses can be stained by fluorescein
or rifampicin—ask before prescribing.

Complications
• Eye infection
• Corneal abrasion or vascularization (painful, watery eye after lens
removal)
• Sensitization to cleaning agents (redness, stinging, swollen eyelids)
• Giant papillary conjunctivitis
• Losing the lens within the eye
• Keratitis
• Acanthamoeba infection
Drugs and the eye Many eye complaints can be treated with topical
medication.
• Ointments last longer in the eye than drops but can cause blurring of
vision—they are better used at night
• Antibiotics should generally be given as drops, enabling clearance
through the nasolacrimal system. In severe infections 2-hourly drops
should be used, reducing to qds after 48 h
• Antibiotic preparations (e.g. chloramphenicol, fusidic acid) can
potentially become contaminated with bacteria so should be changed
regularly
Mydriatics (e.g. tropicamide, cyclopentolate) dilate the pupil and cause
cycloplegia thus causing blurred vision. They are used to dilate the pupil
for examination and to prevent adhesions to the lens in iritis. They can
precipitate acute closed-angle glaucoma in susceptible patients.
Miotics (e.g. pilocarpine) constrict the pupil and i aqueous drainage. They
are used in glaucoma. They can cause systemic side effects, e.g. sweating,
i BP, pulmonary oedema.

Contact lenses and drugs for the eye

Local anaesthetic drops (e.g. oxybuprocaine, proxymetacaine) can help
examination of painful eyes and foreign body removal. Protect the eye
with an eye pad until the anaesthetic has worn off to prevent corneal
damage (corneal reflex is suppressed).
Steroid eye drops are used in scleritis, episcleritis, iritis. Prescribe only
after slit lamp examination and on the advice of an ophthalmologist. Can
cause severe eye damage if used when a dendritic ulcer is present. Longterm use may cause glaucoma, thinning of the cornea/sclera and may
facilitate fungal infection.

β-blocking drops (e.g. timolol, betaxolol) are used in glaucoma. Beware of
systemic side effects—bronchospasm, bradycardia.
α2 receptor agonists (e.g. brimonidine) are used in glaucoma. May cause
dry mouth, headache, fatigue.
Prostaglandin analogues (e.g. latanoprost, bimatoprost) used in glaucoma.
May cause lash growth and ocular inflammation.

Mental health

Mental health assessment
Assessing a patient with mental health problems in primary care can be
challenging. Aims (may need >1 appointment to achieve):
• Establish a constructive relationship to enable effective two-way
communication and serve as the basis for subsequent encounters
• Assess the patient’s emotions and attitudes
• Perform an assessment of the patient’s risk to self and/or others
• Determine if the patient has a mental disorder and, if so, which
• Find out (where possible) what caused the mental disorder
• Explore how best it might be treated

Psychiatric history
Informants GPs may be approached by concerned relatives/friends.
Talk to them (be careful to maintain confidentiality); establish concerns/
circumstances, relevant past history, and outline the patient’s pre-morbid
personality.
The consultation Try to review old notes before seeing the patient. Use
open questions at the start, becoming directive when necessary—clarify,
reflect, facilitate, listen. Be open and ready to ask about suicide, sex, drugs,
etc. Ask about:
• Presenting complaint—chronological account, past history of similar
symptoms. Ask directly about thoughts of suicide and self-harm
• Family history—psychiatric illness, recent loss or serious illness of a
family member, bereavement, depression, suicide or attempted suicide,
psychosis, alcoholism, drug use
• Personal history—abuse (as a child, domestic violence), substance
misuse, serious illness (including past psychiatric history and major
physical illness), recent significant events (e.g. childbirth, house move)
• Attitudes and beliefs—how does the patient see him/herself? What
does he/she think is wrong? How does he/she think other people view
the situation? What does the patient want you to do about it?
• Occupation—unemployed? Happy in job?
• Home situation—housing, relationships, social support, debt etc.

Mental state examination Check:
• Appearance and behaviour—signs of self-neglect or malnutrition, eye
contact, rapport, movements, agitation, or aggression
• Speech—spontaneity, volume, tone, rate, amount, continuity (flight of
ideas, loosening of associations)
• Mood—depressed or elevated. Consider screening for depression,
e.g. screening questions for patients with chronic disease (b p. 199),
screening questions for pregnant or post-natal women (b p. 839),
PHQ-9 (b p. 1001)
• Thinking—form, content, flow, possession
• Perception—illusions, hallucinations, pseudohallucinations
• Cognition—cognitive screen, e.g. 6CIT (b p. 1011)
• Insight—patient’s understanding of his/her illness, its effects, and
need for treatment

Mental health assessment

Action
• Summarize the history back to the patient and give an opportunity for
him/her to fill in any gaps or clarify any points
• Draw up a problem list and management plan with the patient
• Set a review date

High-risk groups for psychiatric illness
Women
• More vulnerable to depression and eating disorders
• During pregnancy and in the post-partum period
• When looking after children <5y old, especially lone parents who
also go out to work
• When subjected to domestic violence
• During the menopause
Men More at risk of suicide.
People with long-term physical health problems e.g.
• Diabetes
• Heart disease
• Chronic disabling lung disease
• Cancers
• Dementia
• Disabling neurological disorders: stroke, PD, MS, MND
Substance abusers Drug abuse; alcoholism.
People suffering adverse life events
• Bereavement
• Relationship break-up
• Unemployment
• Financial problems
Minority ethnic groups More likely to suffer mental health problems
due to social and economic deprivation, isolation from their usual
­culture, racism, and past exposure to war or torture (>50% of refugees
have mental disorders).
Carers All carers are at risk of depression (~40% of carers of stroke
victims are depressed). This starts early after the onset of care-giving. It
is good practice to:
• Identify all carers and mark their records
• Check carers’ mental and physical health annually
• Inform carers that they are entitled to a needs assessment
• Ask patients if you can share information with their carers
• Inform carers about support groups and carer centres
Residents of care homes and nursing homes 50% have depression.

Anxiety b p. 992
Depression b p. 1000
Abnormal beliefs Decide whether a belief is normal in the context of

the patient. If not, decide if the belief is a:
• Delusion, i.e. a belief that does not seem to have a rational basis and
which is not amenable to argument, or
• Overvalued idea, i.e. belief that is odd but understandable, given the
patient’s background

Compulsions Forced behaviours, repeated despite inappropriateness or
unreasonableness, and associated discomfort in response to an obsession.
Can be disabling, e.g. repeated hand washing hundreds of times a day.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder—b p. 996

Abnormal perceptions Consider:
• Illusion Misinterpretation of information, e.g. seeing a coat on a hanger
and interpreting it as a person. Can happen if d level of conscsiousness
or occasionally if visual impairment—particularly AMD
• Hallucination
• Pseudohallucination Vivid perception which is recognized as not being
real, e.g. delirium tremens
• Depersonalization Feeling of being unreal—like an actor playing
yourself. Associated with a wide range of mental illness, e.g.
depression, schizophrenia
• Derealization Feeling of everything around you being unreal—like in a
dream. Often linked to depersonalization
Hallucinations Sensory experiences in the absence of external stimuli.
May be visual, auditory, gustatory, olfactory, or tactile.
• Visual/tactile/auditory hallucinations Suggest mental illness
• Visual and tactile hallucinations suggest organic disorder, e.g.
dementia, acute delirium, metabolic encephalopathy, drug abuse
• Auditory hallucinations suggest psychosis
• Hallucinations experienced when the patient is falling asleep
(hypnagogic hallucination) or waking up (hypnapompic hallucination)
are features of narcolepsy
• Olfactory and gustatory hallucinations Often occur together. May be
suggestive of psychosis but also occur with temporal lobe epilepsy and
olfactory bulb tumours
Thought disorders Consider disorders of:
Content
• Ideas of reference Patients feel they are noticed by everyone around
them/stand out from the crowd; media content, e.g. television or
radio, refers to the patient; or that others are talking/thinking about
the patient. Becomes a delusion of reference when insight is lost.
Associated with schizophrenia, depressive states, and acute and
chronic cognitive impairment
• Delusions

Mental health symptoms and signs

Flow
• Flight of ideas Leaps from idea to idea. There is always some
association between ideas but may seem odd, e.g. rhymes. Associated
with manic illness
• Perseveration Persistence of a verbal or other behaviour beyond what
is apparently intended, expected, or needed. Associated with dementia
and brain damage, e.g. cerebral palsy, CVA
• Loosening of association Series of thoughts appear only distantly
(or loosely) related to one another or completely unrelated.
Associated with schizophrenia
• Thought block Abrupt and complete interruption in the stream of
thought leaving a blank mind. Associated with schizophrenia
Form
• Preoccupation The patient thinks about a topic frequently but can
terminate the thoughts voluntarily. Common symptom, e.g. in anxiety
states. Ask about preoccupation with suicide in depressed patients
• Obsession Thought or image repeated in spite of its inappropriateness
or intrusiveness and associated discomfort. The thought and efforts to
stop it i anxiety and can be disabling
Possession
• Thought insertion Thoughts do not belong to the patient but have
been planted there by someone else. One of the first-rank symptoms
of schizophrenia
• Thought withdrawal Opposite of thought insertion. The patient
perceives a thought is missing and has been removed by someone else.
A first-rank symptom of schizophrenia
• Thought broadcasting The patient believes his/her thoughts can be
heard by other people—either directly or via the newspapers, radio,
etc. Associated with schizophrenia

Delusions Beliefs held unshakably despite available counter-evidence
and which are unexpected in view of circumstances and background. The
belief is usually (but not always) false.
• Primary delusions Belief arrives in the head fully formed, e.g. thought
insertion; strongly suggestive of schizophrenia
• Secondary delusions Belief arises on the basis of experience, e.g.
someone who has lost their job several times through no fault of their
own may believe they are unemployable

Paranoid delusions Delusions (usually primary) which concern the relationship between the patient and other people. Associated with schizophrenia, depressive states, and acute and chronic cognitive impairment.
• Delusions of persecution Most common type of paranoid delusion.
Belief that a person or an organization is intentionally harassing or
inflicting harm upon the patient. Associated with schizophrenia,
depressive states, and acute and chronic cognitive impairment
• Delusions of grandeur Beliefs of possessing exaggerated power,
importance, knowledge, or ability. Associated with mania and
schizophrenia

Psychological therapies
In the UK, the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme in England and similar programmes in other areas of the UK have
dramatically i access to psychological therapies. These may be used alone
or in combination with drug therapies.

Who should be referred? Consider referral for patients with:
• Depression
Stress
• Phobias
Grief reactions
• Somatization
Eating disorders
• Obsessive–
Body dysmorphic
compulsive disorder
disorder
• Medically unexplained symptoms

Problem-solving therapy (PST) Can be an effective tool for use
in the GP surgeryM. Involves drawing up a list of problems and generating
and agreeing solutions, broken down into steps, for patients to work on as
homework between sessions—b p. 1003
Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT)
• Behavioural therapies Aim to change behaviour. Usually the therapist
uses a system of graded exposure (systematic desensitization),
combined with teaching a method of anxiety reduction
• Cognitive therapy Focusses on people’s thoughts and the reasoning
behind their assumptions on the basis that incorrect assumptions (that
are often unconscious) l abnormal reactions which then reinforce
these assumptions further (a vicious cycle)
The patient learns to recognize negative or unhelpful thinking patterns.
By enabling the patient to be more aware of this and teaching ways that
the patient can challenge cognitive errors, more helpful thinking styles can
result. Patients must then practice re-evaluating their thoughts and associated behaviours. At least as effective as drug treatmentM.

Individual non-facilitated self-help
Computerized CBT (CCBT) Particularly useful for patients with mild
symptoms or who do not wish to be referred to specialist psychological
therapy services.
• Free online interactive CCBT, e.g:
• Living Life to the Full M www.livinglifetothefull.com
• The Mood Gym and e-Couch M www.moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome
• Other computerized CBT, e.g. Beating the Blues. A fee is payable, but
some PCOs have purchased this program for use by patients free of
charge in GP surgeries M www.beatingtheblues.co.uk
Bibliotherapy For patients who are not computer-literate, self-help books
based on CBT techniques are an alternative, e.g.:
• Gilbert P (2000) Overcoming Depression. London: Constable &
Robinson. ISBN: 1841191256
• Burns D (2000) Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy. London: Harper
Collins. ISBN: 9780380810338

Psychological therapies

Guided self-help Based on a CBT approach and available through
psychological therapy services. Helpful for patients with mild symptoms.
Uses books/printed materials under the supervision of a trained facilitator
who introduces, monitors, then reviews the outcome of each treatment.
Usually there is minimal contact with the facilitator (<3h).
Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy Skills training programme
designed to enable patients to prevent the recurrence of depression; d
relapse by >50% in the first year after treatment. 8wk group programme
aimed at patients who have ≥3 depression relapses, with 4 further
follow-up sessions in the year following therapy.
Behavioural activation Therapist and patient work together, with
the aim of identifying effects that the patient’s behaviour might have on
symptoms, mood, and problems. Then they address any problematic
behaviours. Techniques may include reducing avoidance, activity scheduling, graded exposure, and initiating positively reinforced behaviours.
Interpersonal therapy (IPT) Individual or group therapy concentrating on the difficulties that arise in maintaining relationships with others. Focusses on current, not past, relationships and works on the premise
that if interpersonal conflicts are resolved, both relationships and mood
will improve. Useful for patients who can identify relationship difficulties.
Psychoeducational groups Group therapy can be used to explore
depression or chronic physical health conditions, e.g. diabetes. Run by
trained practitioners, they also involve the element of peer support.
Applied relaxation Group or individual therapy that teaches patients
to relax quickly in different situations. Establishes the cues that herald
feelings of anxiety and helps the patient to relax when those cues are felt.
Effective treatment for anxiety statesM.
Counselling Usually reflective listening to encourage patients to think
about and try to resolve their own difficulties. There is little evidence of
beneficial effects or cost-effectivenessN, but if there is a specific, identifiable cause for the patient’s symptoms, counselling directed at the cause
may be helpful, e.g.:
• Relationship breakdown—counselling is available through
organizations, such as RELATE (M www.relate.org.uk)
• Bereavement—counselling is available via organizations, such as
CRUSE (F 0870 167 1677; M www.cruse.org.uk)
• Debt—counselling is available from the Citizens Advice Bureau,
National Debtline (F 0808 808 4000), or the Consumer Credit
Counselling Service Debt Remedy website (M www.stepchange.org)

Anxiety
Anxiety is only considered abnormal when it occurs in the absence of a
stressful trigger, impairs physical, occupational, or social functioning, and/
or is excessively severe or prolonged. Features include:
Physical symptoms
Psychological symptoms
• Dry mouth • Paraesthesiae
• Fearful anticipation
• Tremor
• Tinnitus
• Irritability
• Dizziness   • Headache
• Sensitivity to noise
• Epigastric discomfort
• Restlessness
• Difficulty swallowing
• Poor concentration
• Frequent/loose motions/flatulence
• Worrying thoughts
• Chest discomfort/constriction
• Insomnia and/or nightmares
• Difficulty breathing/hyperventilation
• Depression
• Palpitations/awareness of missed beats
• Obsessions
• Frequency/urgency of micturition
• Depersonalization
• Sexual dysfunction
• Fear of losing control/dying
• Menstrual problems

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) Long-term condition, fluctuating in severity and nature, often beginning in adolescence. Lifetime prevalence
~5%. Key features are excessive, difficult-to-control worry about a number
of events/activities occurring on most days for ≥6mo. Consider if history of
anxiety/worry or if frequent attender with chronic physical health problem
or no physical health problem but needing reassurance about somatic symptoms or repeated worrying about a wide range of different issues.
Associations
• Anxiety is often accompanied by depression (b p. 1000) and may be a
feature of early schizophrenia
• Other conditions which can cause anxiety and/or mimic symptoms
of anxiety include drug/alcohol use or withdrawal, caffeine
abuse, thyrotoxicosis, hypoglycaemia, temporal lobe epilepsy,
phaeochromocytoma
Assessment Check TFTs. Use GAD-2 score (see Box 27.1) for screening:
• If score �3, consider anxiety disorder
• If score <3 but you suspect anxiety is a factor, ask ‘Do you find yourself
avoiding places or activities and does this cause you problems?’—if the
answer is yes, consider anxiety disorder.
Management
• Avoid caffeine, excess alcohol, and illicit drugs
• Use a stepped treatment approach (see Figure 27.1)N
• Provide information about self-help organizations/support groups
• Try to identify causes of anxiety
• Consider using an anxiety scale (e.g. Hamilton Anxiety Scale) to record
baseline morbidity and progress at follow-up
Psychological therapies b p. 990
• Low intensity—individual non-facilitated self-help; individual guided
self-help; psychoeducational groups
• High intensity—CBT or applied relaxation

• SSRIs (e.g. sertraline 50–150mg od)—warn patients medication may
take >1wk to work and of possible side effects (short-term i in
anxiety; GI symptoms). If >60y or other risk factors for GI bleeding,
consider co-prescribing a PPI
• Follow-up every 2–4wk in the first 3mo then every 3mo
• If drug treatment is effective, continue for >1y
• If no benefit, consider alternative SSRI/SNRI or adding a psychological
therapy; pregabalin is an option if unable to tolerate SSRI/SNRI. Do
not offer antipsychotic medication
• Avoid benzodiazepines except for acute crises; restrict use to <4wk
• Patients <30y may have i suicidal thoughts when they start an SSRI/
SNRI—warn about this risk and follow-up <1wk after starting medication
and then weekly for 1mo to monitor suicide/self-harm risk.
Refer to specialist mental health services if severe anxiety with marked
functional impairment plus:
• Risk of self-harm/suicide, or
• Significant co-morbidity (e.g. substance misuse, personality disorder or
complex physical health problems), or
• Self-neglect, or
• Inadequate response to step 3 interventions

Panic disorder Panic attacks are very common, but panic disorder is
uncommon: lifetime prevalence—1% of 4; 3% of 5.  	
• Panic attack Period of intense fear with characteristic symptoms. Can
be spontaneous or situational
• Panic disorder Chronic disorder; recurrent panic attacks associated
with persistent fear of having (or the consequences of) another attack
Symptoms Anxiety builds up quickly and unexpectedly without a recognizable trigger and patients often describe an intense feeling of apprehension or impending disaster. Common associated symptoms:
• Shortness of breath/smothering •	Nausea or abdominal pain
• Depersonalization/derealization
sensations
•	Numbness or tingling sensations
• Choking
• Flushes or chills
• Palpitations and i heart rate
• Trembling or shaking
• Chest discomfort or pain
• Fear of dying
• Sweating
• Dizziness, unsteady feelings, or • Fear of doing something crazy or
uncontrolled
faintness
Examination Obvious distress; sweating; tachycardia; hyperventilation.
i BP is common and usually settles. Otherwise examination is normal.
Associations Depression (56%); GAD; agoraphobia; substance misuse;
suicide (i risk).
Differential diagnosis Alcohol withdrawal; drug misuse/withdrawal, other
psychiatric disorders (e.g. psychosis); hyperthyroidism; temporal lobe
epilepsy; cardiac arrhythmia; labyrinthitis; hypoglycaemia; hyperparathyroidism; phaeochromocytoma (very rare).
Management of acute panic attack b p. 1120
Management of panic disorder Use a stepped treatment approach:
• Step 1 Recognition and diagnosis. Educate about the condition,
signpost to support in the community, and discuss treatment options.
Commence active monitoring. Avoid alcohol, illicit drugs, and caffeine
• Step 2 Treatment in primary care—offer (in order of effectiveness)
psychological therapy (CBT), drug treatment or self-help (bibliotherapy
or CCBT). Choice depends on severity of symptoms, co-morbidities
and patient preference
• Step 3 Consideration of alternative treatment—if one step 2
treatment is ineffective, change to or add another
• Step 4 Offer referral for specialist treatment if ≥2 primary care
treatments have failed
Drug treatment 0 Do not use benzodiazepines for treatment of patients
with panic disorder—associated with poorer long-term outcome.
• Offer SSRI, e.g. paroxetine, citalopram. Warn about possible transient i
in anxiety on starting treatment. Minimize initial side effects by starting
at low dose and i slowly. Review in <2wk and at 4, 6, and 12wk
• If SSRI is not suitable or ineffective, offer a TCA (e.g. imipramine,
clomipramine) or non-drug treatment
• If effective, continue for ≥6mo, reviewing every 8–12wk
• Minimize discontinuation symptoms by tapering dose over time

Anxiety

Phobias As GAD but limited to certain situations. 2 main features:

• Avoidance Of the circumstances that provoke anxiety
• Anticipatory anxiety If there is a prospect of meeting that situation
Simple phobia Inappropriate anxiety in the presence of ≥1 object/situation, e.g. flying, enclosed spaces, spiders. Common in early life; most adult
phobias are a continuation of childhood phobias. Lifetime prevalence: 4%
4; 13% 5.
Management Treatment is only needed if symptoms are frequent, intrusive, or prevent necessary activities. Exposure therapy is effective. Obtain
through psychological therapy services or through the private sector, e.g.
British Airways’ ‘fear of flying’ course.
Social phobia Intense/persistent fear of being scrutinized or negatively
evaluated by others leads to fear and avoidance of social situations (e.g.
using a telephone, speaking in front of a group). Significantly disabling; not
just shyness. May be generalized (person fears most social situations) or
specific (related to certain activities only).
Management
• Drug therapy SSRIs—continue ≥12mo or long-term if symptoms
remain unresolved, there is a co-morbid condition (e.g. depression,
GAD, panic attacks), a history of relapse, or early onset
• Psychological therapies CBT (cognitive restructuring) 9 exposure
Agoraphobia Onset is often aged 20–40y with an initial panic attack.
Subsequently, panic attacks, fear of fainting and/or loss of control are
experienced in crowds, away from home, or in situations from which
escape is difficult. Avoidance results in patients remaining within their
homes where they know symptoms will not occur. Other symptoms
include depression, depersonalization, and obsessional thoughts.
Management Difficult to manage in general practice. Diagnosis is often
delayed as patients will not come to the surgery and ongoing management
complicated by refusal to be referred to psychiatric services. Prognosis is
best when there is good marital/social support. Options:
• Behaviour therapy, e.g. exposure, coping with panic attacks. Home
visits may be required but should be resisted as part of therapy
• Drug treatment SSRIs (citalopram and paroxetine are licensed); MAOIs;
TCAs (imipramine and clomipramine are commonly used). Relapse rate
is high. Benzodiazepines can be used if frequent panic attacks, particularly
if initiating other treatment but beware of dependence

Other anxiety-type disorders
Stress b p. 998
Post-traumatic stress disorder b p. 998
Mixed anxiety and depression Combinations of anxiety and depres-

sion are common—particularly amongst women. Prevalence ~10%. When
anxiety and depression occur together symptoms are more severe; there
is i functional impairment; illness is more chronic/persistent; and there
is poorer response to treatment. Treat as for anxiety and/or depression,
depending on the predominating features. Refer for psychiatric assessment
if management strategies are not working.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) Recurrent obsessive
thoughts and compulsive acts. Lifetime prevalence ~2% although minor
obsessional symptoms are more common. 4:58 2:3. Tends to present in
young adults. Patients may have symptoms for years before seeking help as
they know that their thoughts/actions are irrational and are embarrassed
to tell anyone. Relatives may highlight the problem.
Features
• Obsessional thinking Recurrent persistent thoughts, impulses, and
images causing anxiety or distress
• Compulsive behaviour Repetitive behaviours, rituals, or mental acts
done to prevent or d anxiety
• Other features Indecisiveness and inability to take action, anxiety,
depression, and depersonalization
Screening questionsN
• Do you wash or clean a lot?
• Do you check things a lot?
• Is there any thought that keeps bothering you that you would like to
get rid of but can’t?
• Do your daily activities take a long time to finish?
• Are you concerned about orderliness or symmetry?
• Do these problems trouble you?
Management in adults
• Mild functional impairment Offer short CBT (<10h), including
exposure-response prevention (ERP) or group therapy
• Moderate functional impairment Offer more intensive CBT (>10h)
or drug therapy (SSRI, e.g. fluoxetine 20–40mg od)
• Severe functional impairment Offer psychological therapy + drug
treatment. If inadequate response at 12wk, offer a different SSRI or
clomipramine. Refer if symptoms persist
Management in children and young people
• Mild functional impairment Consider guided self-help.
Include support and help for family and carers
• Moderate/severe functional impairment Offer CBT
including ERP adapted to patient’s age in a group or individual setting.
Refer if symptoms do not improve. Drug therapy should only be
initiated in secondary care

Other anxiety-type disorders

Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) Preoccupation with an imagined

defect in appearance or markedly excessive concern over a slight physical
anomaly. Prevalence: 0.5–0.7%.
Features Time-consuming behaviours, e.g. mirror gazing, comparing self
to others, camouflage, reassurance seeking, and skin picking.

Screening questionsN
• Do you worry about the way you look and wish you could think about it less?
• What specific concerns do you have about your appearance?
• On a typical day, how many hours a day is it on your mind
(>1h excessive)?
• What effect does it have on your life?
• Does it make it hard to do your work or be with friends?
Management As for OCD, however all children/young people should be
offered CBT.

Somatization Physical symptoms in response to emotional distress.
Characterized by an excessive preoccupation with bodily sensations combined with a fear of physical illness. Common feature of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, and substance use.
Medically unexplained symptoms b p. 200
Somatization disorder Chronic condition. History of numerous unsubstantiated physical complaints. Starts at <30y and often persists many
years. 5:4 810:1; lifetime prevalence 0.1–0.2% though mild symptoms are
much more common. Presents with:
• >2y history of multiple symptoms with no physical explanation
• Refusal to be reassured that there is no explanation for the symptoms
• Impaired social/family functioning due to these symptoms and/or
associated behaviour
Management of somatization disorder
• Reattribution involves acknowledging/taking symptoms seriously, offering
necessary examination and investigations, asking about psychosocial
problems, and explaining the link between symptoms and stress
• Treat co-morbid psychiatric problems (e.g. depression, anxiety, panic)
• Beware of risks of drug interaction—self-medication with multiple
OTC (or even prescription) drugs is common
• Beware of side effects of medication—these patients do not tolerate
prescribed drugs well and have a heightened awareness of side effects
• Refer to the specialist mental health team if risk of suicide, marked
functional impairment, impulsive or antisocial behaviour

Mental health

Chronic stress
We all suffer from stress and, most of the time, the pressures of everyday
life are a motivating force. A problem only arises when those pressures
exceed the individual’s ability to cope with them.

Causes of stress Virtually anything we do can cause stress. The most
common causes of stress-related morbidity in the UK are:
• Work problems
• Financial problems
• Exam stress
• Family problems
•	Legal problems
The stress epidemic 10.8 million working days are lost each year
in the UK due to stress (11% of all sickness absence). The Health and
Safety Executive estimates ~0.4 million people in the UK are experien­
cing work-related stress at a level they believe is making them ill; up to
5 million people feel ‘very’ or ‘extremely’ stressed by their work; and
work-related stress costs society >£4 billion every year. Occupational
stress is most likely to affect those working in the health, social work, and
education sectors.
Presentation Most patients do not consult their GP with stress, unless

they feel it is affecting their health. Common symptoms include:
• Sleep disturbance
• Fatigue and/or
• Mood swings
• Headaches
lethargy
• Anxiety
•	Loss of libido
• Poor or i appetite
• Depression
• i smoking, alcohol, • Menstrual
•	Low self-esteem
abnormalities
and/or caffeine
• Poor concentration
• Dry mouth
consumption
and/or memory
• Other unexplained aches/pains, e.g. muscular pains, chest pains
• Worsening of pre-existing conditions, e.g. irritable bowel syndrome,
eczema, asthma, psoriasis, migraine
The GP’s role is to identify stress as a cause of presenting symptoms;
educate patients about stress and links between symptoms and stress;
identify sources of stress; provide support and self-management strategies
(see Box 27.2); treat medical problems arising out of stress e.g. depression;
and provide certification if stress is so great that unable to work.
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) May occur in 25–30% of
those who have experienced/witnessed traumatic events, e.g. major accident, fire, assault, military combat. It can affect people of all ages.
Symptoms Most develop symptoms immediately after the event but it
is common for sufferers not to present until months/years afterwards. In
~15%, onset of symptoms is delayed. 65% experience chronic symptoms:
• Intrusive recollections Thoughts; nightmares; flashbacks
• Avoidant behaviour Of people, places, situations, or circumstances
resembling/associated with the event; refusal to talk/think about the
event; excessive rumination about questions about the event (e.g. why
me? How could it have been prevented?)
• i arousal i anxiety/irritability, insomnia, d concentration, i vigilance
• Numbing of emotions Inability to experience feelings; feelings of
detachment; giving up previous activities; amnesia for parts of the event

Chronic stress

Associations Depression, anxiety; drug/alcohol abuse and dependence.
Management Treat any other associated psychiatric illness.
• Watchful waiting If mild symptoms have been present <4wk. Be
supportive and listen. Arrange follow up in <1mo
• Trauma-focussed psychological treatment CBT and/or eye
movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). Refer if severe
symptoms <4wk or ongoing intrusive symptoms >4wk after trauma
• Drug treatment (e.g. paroxetine, mirtazapine) Not first-line
treatment. Reserve for those refusing or with continuing symptoms
despite psychological therapy
0 Debriefing after traumatic events is unhelpful.
The stressed GP b p. 8

Box 27.2 Self-help stress management strategies
10 tips for chronic stress relief
• Ensure you get enough sleep and rest—avoid using sleeping tablets
to achieve this (see Insomnia—b p.194)
•	Look after yourself and your own health, e.g. don’t skip meals, sit
down to eat, take time out to spend time with family and friends,
make time for hobbies and relaxation, do not ignore health worries
• Avoid using nicotine, alcohol, or caffeine as a means of stress relief
• Work off stress with physical exercise—d levels of adrenaline
released and i release of natural endorphins which l a sense of
well-being and enhanced sleep
• Try relaxation techniques
• Avoid interpersonal conflicts—try to agree more and be more tolerant
•	Learn to accept what you can’t change
•	Learn to say ‘no’
• Manage your time better—prioritize and delegate; create time
buffers to deal with unexpected overruns and emergencies
• Try to sort out the cause of the stress, e.g. talk to line manager at
work, arrange marriage or debt counselling, arrange more childcare
Time management made easy This technique aims to transform an
overwhelming volume of work into a series of manageable tasks.
• Make a list of all the things you need to do
•	List them in order of genuine importance
•	Note whether you really need to do the task, what you need to do
personally, and what can be delegated to others
•	Note a timescale in which each task needs to be done, e.g.
immediately, within a day, within a week, within a month, etc.

Depression
2.3 million people suffer from depression in UK at any time. 4:5 81:2.
Recognition ~30–50% cases are not detected, although most are mild
cases, more likely to resolve spontaneously. Diagnosis of mental illness is
stigmatizing. This can lead to ‘collusion’ between patient and doctor during
consultation to avoid diagnosis, doing little to tackle the problem.
Screening questions for depressionN If +ve response to either
question, investigate further, e.g with PHQ-9 (Figure 27.2).
• During the last month, have you often been bothered by feeling down,
depressed, or hopeless?
• During the last month, have you often been bothered by having little
interest or pleasure in doing things?
Causes and co-morbidity Associated with:
• Psychiatric disorders, e.g. anxiety, alcohol abuse, substance abuse,
eating disorders
• Physical disorders, e.g. PD, MS, dementia, thyroid disorders, Addison’s
disease, hypercalcaemia, RA, SLE, cancer, HIV and other chronic
infections, cardio- and cerebrovascular disease, learning disability
• Drugs causing symptoms of depression β-blockers, anticonvulsants,
Ca2+ channel blockers, corticosteroids, oral contraceptives,
antipsychotic drugs, drugs used for PD (e.g. levodopa)

Biopsychosocial assessment (BPA) Discuss:

• Current symptoms (nature, onset,
duration, severity)
• PH of depression and/or mood
elevation (? bipolar disorder)
• FH of mental illness
• Quality of relationships
•	Living conditions—social support

•
•
•
•
•

Employment/financial worries
Alcohol/substance misuse
Suicidal ideation
Treatment options
Past experience of/response to
treatments

In addition consider discussing:
• Co-morbid mental/physical health • The patient’s views about the
cause of his/her symptoms
problems
•	Need for follow-up
• Awareness of sources of help
Symptoms Present >50% of the time in the past 2wk. Two key features:
• Depressed mood, and/or
• d interest or pleasure, which must be disabling to the patient
Other symptoms:
•	Low self-esteem
• Change in appetite/weight
• Psychomotor agitation/retardation
• Insomnia or hypersomnia
• Sense of worthlessness or guilt
• Fatigue or loss of energy
• Recurrent thoughts of death/suicide
• Poor concentration
• Feelings of hopelessness
• Poor appetite or overeating
• Poor concentration or difficulty
• Insomnia or hypersomnia
making decisions
•	Low energy or fatigue
0 Sleep disturbance and fatigue have high predictive value for depression
and should prompt enquiry about other symptoms.

Mental health

Examination
• General appearance Self-neglect, smell of alcohol, weight d
• Assessment of mood Looks depressed and/or tired, speech
monotone or monosyllabic, avoids eye contact, tearful, anxious or
jumpy/fidgety, feeling of distance, poor concentration, etc.
• Psychotic symptoms Hallucinations, delusions, etc. (b p. 1006)
Assessing severity of depression Can be done using a depression
symptom count or patient self-complete measure, such as the PHQ-9.
• Subthreshold depressive symptoms Fewer than 5 symptoms of
depression (PHQ-9 of <5)
• Mild depression ≥5 symptoms of depression that result in only mild
functional impairment (PHQ-9 of 5–9)
• Moderate depression Symptoms or functional impairment are
between ‘mild’ and ‘severe’ (PHQ-9 of 10–14 indicates moderate
depression; PHQ-9 of 15–19 indicates moderately severe depression)
• Severe depression Most symptoms and the symptoms markedly
interfere with functioning ± psychotic symptoms (PHQ-9 ≥20)

Assessment of suicidal intent 0 Always ask patients directly
about suicidal ideas and intent (b p. 1118). Risk factors for suicide:
• Past psychiatric history
• 4>5
• Recent admission to psychiatric
• Age 40–60y
hospital
•	Living alone
• Divorced > widowed > single > • History of suicide attempt/
self-harm
married
• Alcohol/drug misuse
• Unemployment
• Family history of suicide
• Chronic physical illness
Cultural considerations Some cultures have no terms for depression. Patients may present with physical symptoms (somatization) or use
less familiar ‘cultural-specific’ terms to describe depressive symptoms, e.g.
‘sorrow in my heart’.
Management of depressionN Use a stepped care approach starting
at the step most appropriate for the patient.
Step 1 All patients—assess severity. Provide education about depression and information about support available to both the patient and carers/family members as appropriate. Discuss treatment options.
If sleep is a problem Discuss sleep hygiene (b p. 194): establish regular
sleep/wake times; avoid excess eating, smoking, or alcohol before sleep;
create a proper environment for sleep; take regular exercise.
Subthreshold or mild depression Active monitoring—watchful waiting
for <2wk to see if spontaneous recovery occurs. Simple problem-solving
strategies may be useful in the GP surgery (see Figure 27.3).
Step 2 Persistent subthreshold or mild/moderate depression.
• Low-intensity psychosocial interventions (b p. 990) Individual
guided self-help; CCBT; structured group exercise programme
(e.g. exercise prescription)
• Group-based peer support For people with a shared chronic physical
health problem

depression that persists after other interventions
Step 3 Moderate/severe depression or mild/subthreshold depression
that has not responded to treatment.
• High-intensity psychological interventions (b p. 990) Individual
or group-based CBT, interpersonal therapy, behavioural activation,
behavioural couples therapy (if relationship difficulties)
• Drug treatment Usually SSRI
• Combined treatments Antidepressant medication + high-intensity
psychological intervention (CBT or interpersonal therapy)
• Collaborative care For people with physical health problems. Case
management supervised by a mental health professional providing
education + psychological/pharmacological treatments with follow-up
Step 4 Referral to psychiatry U = Urgent; S = Soon; R = Routine
• High suicide risk—U
• Severe self-neglect—U
• Depression complicated by psychotic symptoms—U
• Depression complicated by significant psychiatric co-morbidity or
psychosocial factors—R/S
• Inadequate response to multiple treatments—R
Safety-netting Follow-up if patients do not attend appointments. Give
patient ± family/carers clear advice on what to do if the patient’s mood
deteriorates and how to access urgent support, both in and out of hours.

Drugs for treating depression
(BNF 4.3)

When should antidepressants be started? Consider for:
• Patients with moderate/severe depression ± psychological therapy
• Dysthymia (subthreshold depressive symptoms lasting >2y)
• Mild depression if other treatment strategies have failed—b p. 998
What should I tell the patient? Giving patients information i compliance. When starting antidepressant drugs explain:
• The reasons for prescribing
• Timescale of action—unlikely to have any effect for 2wk; effects build
up to maximum effect at 4–6wk, and
•	Likely side effects including possible exacerbation of anxiety in the first
2wk of treatment
Which drugs are available? The major groups are:
Selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (e.g. fluoxetine 20mg od;
citalopram 20–40mg od; sertraline 50–150mg od). Usually first choice as
less likely to be discontinued due to side effects and safer in overdose.
Warn of possible short-term i in anxiety/agitation when starting medication and advise patients to stop if significant. GI side effects, including dyspepsia are common. Consider co-prescribing a PPI for stomach protection
if >60y or other risk factors for GI bleeding.
Only fluoxetine has been shown to be of benefit for the treatment of depression in children—b p. 921.
E lderly people—particularly those taking SSRIs—are prone to
hyponatraemia when taking antidepressants.
Serotonin and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (e.g. venlafaxine 37.5mg bd, duloxetine 60mg od). Avoid if uncontrolled hypertension.
Venlafaxine is also contraindicated if high risk of arrhythmia.
Tricyclic and related anti-depressants (TCAs) (e.g. lofepramine 70mg od/
bd/tds; trazodone 150–300mg daily). Titrate dose up from low dose until
the patient feels the drug is helping or until side effects intrudeS. Common
side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation,
urinary retention, and sweating. Use with caution for patients with CVD
because of risk of arrhythmia, patients with prostatic hypertrophy (i risk
of retention), and patients with raised intraocular pressures (i risk of
acute glaucoma).
Mirtazapine 15–45mg nocte. Presynaptic α2-adrenoreceptor antagonist.
i central noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission. Causes
sedation during initial treatment and may also cause weight i.
Reboxetine 4–6mg bd. Selective inhibitor of noradrenaline re-uptake. Not
recommended for elderly patients.

Drugs for treating depression

Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) (e.g. phenelzine 15mg tds).
Should only be initiated in a specialist setting. Do not start until:
• >1–2wk after a tricyclic has been stopped (3wk in the case of
clomipramine or imipramine)
• >1wk after an SSRI has been stopped (2wk in the case of sertraline;
5wk in the case of fluoxetine)
Patients taking MAOIs must be very careful with diet, eating only fresh
foods and avoiding game, alcohol, and foods containing tyramine, such as
mature cheese, pickled herring, broad bean pods, and meat, yeast, or soya
bean extracts. Failure to do so can result in rapid i in BP (often heralded
by a headache).
0 Do not start other antidepressants until 2wk after treatment with
MAOIs has been stopped (3wk if starting clomipramine/imipramine).

Follow-up
• Review patients every 1–2wk until stable assessing response,
compliance, side effects, and suicidal risk
• Continue for 4–6wk before judging a treatment as failed—and a
further 2–4wk if partial response
• Continue treatment for at least 6mo in total—12mo in the elderly and
those with generalized anxiety disorder. Advise patients with a history
of recurrent depression to continue for >2yN
Discontinuation reactions Occur once a drug has been used ≥ 8wk.
Usually become apparent <5d after stopping the drug. Most pronounced
with drugs that have a shorter half-life, e.g. paroxetine or venlafaxine.
d risk by tapering dose over ≥ 4wk (as long as 6mo for patients who have
been on long-term maintenance therapy). Warn about possible reactions:
• Withdrawal of SSRIs and SNRIs—GI disturbances, headache, nausea,
paraesthesiae, dizziness, anxiety, tinnitus, sleep disturbances, flu-like
symptoms, sweating
• Withdrawal of other antidepressants (especially MAOIs)—nausea,
vomiting, anorexia, headache, flu-like symptoms, insomnia,
paraesthesiae, anxiety/panic, and restlessness

St John’s wort May be effective in mild depression but formulations
vary widely in potency. Interacts with many drugs including antidepressants (especially SSRIs), warfarin, oral contraceptives, and theophylline.
• Use of antidepressants has been associated with suicidal thoughts/
behaviour. Those with a past history of self-harm and suicidal behaviour
and children/young people are most at risk. Monitor for suicide risk
especially at the start of treatment or after dose changes.

Psychosis
Characterized by a loss of the link between reason and the outside world.
Lifetime risk 3/100; 80% are aged <30y at diagnosis (5% <15y). Risk is i by
prolonged cannabis use and living in an inner city (3x i risk).
Psychosis is not a diagnosis but a class of illnesses characterized by 3 key
features:
• Hallucinations—b p. 988
• Delusions—b p. 989, and
• Thought disorder b p. 988
If ≥1 of these features is present diagnosis is very limited:
• Affective psychosis Psychotic depression, mania, and hypomania
• Delusional psychosis Schizophrenia/paranoid psychosis, or
• Organic psychosis Dementia; delirium
Schizophrenia b p. 1008
Mania and hypomania b p. 1009

Early intervention in psychosis Important to delay/prevent onset of

disabling illness and d complications (50% d suicide rate; i employment
from 22% to 50%; d social exclusion). Early intervention also d healthcare
costs by a third as a result of d admissions.
Early symptoms Psychosis is usually heralded by gradual d in intellectual/
social functioning. 0 Always take family concerns seriously.
• Poor sleep
• Social withdrawal/isolation • Undue suspicions/
• Panic
mistrust
•	Loss of job
• Mood changes • Broken relationships
• Perceptual changes
Seek evidence of psychotic thinking. Useful questions include:
• Do you think that you are different from other people?
• Do you think something strange is happening that you can’t explain?
• Do you see, hear, feel, or experience things that others don’t?
• Do you think others are watching you, talking about you, or having a
go at you for no good reason?
• Do you think that you are special or important in some way?

Management If early psychosis is suspected, exclude other physical causes
of symptoms (drug/alcohol abuse or withdrawal; metabolic abnormalities,
e.g. thyrotoxicosis; hypoglycaemia; neurological disease, e.g. tumour, epilepsy; infection), and refer promptly to the early psychosis clinic for specialist assessment, diagnosis, and ongoing management.
0 Alcohol/drug misuse is a common co-morbidity.
Physical health problems and psychosis People with psychotic illness die on average 16–25y early. Premature deaths result from:
• Suicide (33%)
• Physical disease (66%)—diabetes (2x i prevalence), respiratory (10x i
mortality), cardiovascular (7x i mortality), and infectious disease.
Reasons
•	Lifestyle—smoking (66% smoke); obesity (2–3x); poor diet, d exercise
• Medication—some antipsychotic medications cause weight i and
adversley affect lipid profile; sedation may d exercise

Psychosis

• Genetic—people with a diagnosis of psychosis are more likely to suffer
from DM and/or CVD even after exclusion of other risk factors
• Social exclusion—d attendance at chronic disease management clinics,
d participation in screening programmes

Annual reviews in primary care All patients with confirmed
non-organic psychotic illness require long-term follow-up in primary care.
• Regular reviews Case registers help ensure regular reviews take place.
Check a written care plan has been drawn up by the psychiatric service
involved. Follow-up if a patient does not attend for review
• Check mental health Assess symptoms; compliance with medication;
efficacy of treatment; medication side effects; risks of suicide
• Check physical health Annual screening and review of smoking,
exercise, BMI (and/or waist circumference), BP, FBG or HbA1c,
FBC, renal and liver function, lipids, prolactin (if taking anti-psychotic
medication), TFTs (if taking lithium)
• Education Involve family if possible—information about psychotic illness
and treatment (reinforce compliance), early signs of relapse, where
to access help, benefits of d smoking, exercise, healthy diet, weight
control, sensible drinking, and avoidance of illicit drugs, e.g. cannabis/
amphetamines, which exacerbate symptoms and i risk of relapse
• Help with lifestyle change, e.g. referral to smoking cessation clinic,
dietician or weight management programme; exercise prescription
• Social support Assistance may be needed with: carer support, finances,
housing, employment, structured daily activity, transport, social
network. Those who can help include: social services, community
mental health team, housing officer, disability support workers
Driving and psychotic illness Advise patients to inform the DVLA.
Driving should cease during the acute illness (all vehicles) and until stable
with insight for ≥3y (LGV/PCV drivers)—b p. 131
Emergency management of severe psychosis
• Severe crises that endanger the individual or others are difficult to
manage in primary care. Treatment in hospital may be required
• If unwilling to accept voluntary admission, use compulsory admission
under the Mental Health Act (b p. 1122)
• Sedation whilst awaiting admission may be required—try oral
medication first, e.g. lorazepam 1–2mg or chlorpromazine 50–100mg po;
if oral medication is refused and severe agitation, consider lorazepam
1–2mg IM or chlorpromazine 50mg IM (d dose for elderly patients and
avoid if the patient is epileptic, has been drinking, or taking barbiturates)

Schizophrenia and mania
Management of first presentation If psychotic illness is suspected,
ask yourself whether the patient is a risk to self/others
• If a risk, request emergency specialist assessment and/or acute
admission voluntarily or under the Mental Health Act (b p. 122)
• If no immediate risk refer through the local rapid-access early
intervention in psychosis service (b p. 1006)
Physical health problems of people with psychosis b p. 1006
Driving and psychosis b p. 131
Schizophrenia Is a frightening and disabling condition in which the sufferer is unable to distinguish his internal from the outside world. Lifetime
prevalence 81%. Peak age of onset—4 (15–25y); 5 (25–35y).
First rank symptoms Reliable markers in ~70% of patients. ≥1 symptom is
suggestive of schizophrenia:
• Thought withdrawal, insertion,
• Auditory hallucinations in the
and interruption
form of a commentary
• Hearing thoughts spoken aloud • Delusional perception
• Hearing voices referring to the • Feelings or actions experienced
as made or influenced by external
patient, made in the 3rd person
agents (passivity feelings)
• Somatic hallucinations
• Thought broadcasting
First presentation of schizophrenia Typically a young person <35y with
+ve symptoms (delusions, hallucinations, and/or thought disorder). The
patient may lack insight, so the initial approach may come from a relative/
friend. See the patient.
• Ask about physical and psychological symptoms—in particular
thoughts and perceptions
• Assess the patient’s behaviour and appearance. Look for evidence of
self-care, loss of affect, poverty of thought, and social withdrawal
• Try to elicit any history of drug abuse
• Ask friends, neighbours, or relatives present to tell you about the
patient’s behaviour
Differential diagnosis Illicit drugs, temporal lobe epilepsy, delirium,
dementia, affective disorder, personality disorder.
Chronic schizophrenia Characterized by thought disorder and –ve symptoms (poverty of thought, apathy, inactivity, lack of volition, social withdrawal, and loss of affect). Aim to treat the disease, prevent relapse, and
improve quality of life.
Antipsychotic medication Initiate only under specialist supervision. Safety
concerns include:
• Cardiovascular disease
• Weight i
• Prolonged Q-T syndrome
• Insulin resistance/diabetes
• Extrapyramidal syndrome
• Dyslipidaemia
0 All patients taking antipsychotic agents should have annual review of
BMI, BP, FBG/HbA1c, lipids, FBC, U&E and eGFR, LFTs, and prolactin.
Regular primary care review b p. 1007

Schizophrenia and mania

Mania and hypomania Most of us experience ups and downs in our
mood according to the circumstances we find ourselves in.
Mania Is characterized by a persistently high or euphoric mood out of
keeping with circumstances. Other signs include:
Hypomania Is a less severe form of mania.
• Over-assertiveness
• d desire/need
• i pressure
• Spending sprees
for sleep
of speech
• Disinhibition
• i energy and activity • d insight
• Grandiose delusions • Self-important ideas
• i appetite
• Poor concentration
• Hallucinations
• i sexual desire
•	Labile mood
• i pain threshold
Differential diagnosis Hypoglycaemia; alcohol or drug abuse; prescribed
drug side effects (e.g. steroids); temporal lobe epilepsy; frontal lobe dysfunction (e.g. due to tumour or stroke); thyrotoxicosis.
Regular primary care review b p. 1007
Drug treatment (BNF 4.2.3)
•	Lithium is the drug of choice—initiate only under specialist supervision
• Check levels weekly until the dose is constant for 4wk, then monthly
for 6mo. Then, as long as the dose is constant, check levels every 3mo
• If levels are slowly rising, suspect nephrotoxicity
• Check plasma creatinine, eGFR, and TFTs every 6mo
• Avoid changing proprietary brands as bioavailability varies
• Toxicity: blurred vision, diarrhoea/vomiting, d K+, drowsiness, ataxia,
coarse tremor, dysarthria, hyperextension, fits, psychosis, coma, shock
• Alternative drugs: sodium valproate; carbamazepine
Bipolar disorder or manic depression Consists of episodes when
the patient has mania (bipolar I) or hypomania (bipolar II) against a background of depression. Lifetime prevalence ~1%. 4:5 81:1. Peak incidence
is in late teens and early 20s—90% develop the disorder before 30y.
Management is as for mania.

Referral to the specialist mental health team U = Urgent;
S = Soon; R = Routine.

Mental health

Acute delirium
Common condition seen in general practice—particularly amongst elderly
patients. May occur de novo or be superimposed upon chronic confusion
of dementia (b p. 1012) causing sudden worsening of cognition.

Presentation
•
•
•
•
•

Global cognitive deficit with onset over hours/days
Fluctuating conscious level—typically worse at night/late afternoon
Impaired memory—on recovery amnesia of the events is usual
Disorientation in time and place
Odd behaviour—may be underactive, drowsy, and/or withdrawn or
hyperactive and agitated
• Disordered thinking—often slow and muddled 9 delusions (e.g. accuse
relatives of taking things)
• Disturbed perceptions—hallucinations (particularly visual) are common
• Mood swings
Examination Can be difficult. If possible, do a thorough general physical
examination to exclude treatable causes.

Possible causes
• Infection Particularly UTI, pneumonia; rarely, encephalitis/meningitis
• Drugs Opioids, sedatives, levodopa, anticonvulsants, recreational drugs
• Metabolic Hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, uraemia, liver failure,
hypercalcaemia, other electrolyte imbalance (rarer)
• Alcohol or drug withdrawal
• Hypoxia, e.g. pneumonia, exacerbation of COPD, cardiac failure
• Cardiovascular MI, stroke, TIA
• Intracranial lesion Space-occupying lesion, i ICP, head injury
(especially subdural haematoma)
• Thyroid disease
• Carcinomatosis
• Epilepsy Temporal lobe epilepsy, postictal state.
• Nutritional deficiency B12, thiamine, or nicotinic acid deficiency

Differential diagnosis
• Deafness—may appear confused
• Dementia—longer history and lack of fluctuations in conscious level; in
practice may be difficult to distinguish especially if you come across a
patient who is alone and can give no history
• Primary mental illness, e.g. schizophrenia (b p. 1008);
mania (b p. 1009); anxiety state (b p. 992)
Management Is aimed at treating all remediable causes.
Admit to hospital or refer to intermediate care if:
• The patient lives alone
• The patient will be left unsupervised for any duration of time
• If carers (or residential home) are unprepared/unable to continue
looking after the patient, and/or
• If history and examination have indicated a cause requiring acute
hospital treatment

Acute delirium

Possible investigations to consider in the community
• Cognitive function test, e.g. 6CIT (see Table 27.1)
• Urine—dipstick for glucose, ketones, blood, protein, nitrates, and
leucocyte esterase; send for M,C&S
• Check finger-prick capillary glucose to exclude hypoglycaemia
• Blood—FBC, ESR, U&E, eGFR, LFTs, Ca2+, TFTs
• ECG          •	 CXR
Management at home
• Acute confusion is frightening for carers—reassure and support them
• Treat the cause, e.g. antibiotics for UTI or chest infection
• Try to avoid sedation as this can make confusion worse. Where
unavoidable use lorazepam 0.5–1mg po/IM prn
• Involve district nursing services and/or intermediate care services, e.g.
to provide incontinence aids, nursing care, additional support
• If the cause does not become clear despite investigation or the patient
fails to improve with treatment admit for further investigation and
assessment

Mental health

Dementia
Generalized impairment of intellect, memory, and personality, with no
impairment of consciousness. Prevalence i with age (rare <60y; 5%
>65y; 20% >80y). Common causes: Alzheimer’s disease (60%); vascular
(multi-infarct) dementia; dementia with Lewy bodies.
Presentation Patients may be aware of ‘being a bit forgetful’ but usually relatives complain about their behaviour. Early symptoms are loss
of short-term memory and inability to perform normally simple tasks.
Alternatively patients present later with failure to cope at home or
self-neglect occasionally leading to crisis. To diagnose dementia there
must be a clear history of progressive impairment of memory and cognition 9 personality change. Always assess level of support in the home,
housing, and ability to cope (both patient and carers). Review medications
to identify any that might impair cognition.
Examination Check general appearance—look for self-neglect, malnutrition, abuse; screen for cognitive deficit, e.g. with 6CIT (b p. 1011).

Investigation Aimed at detecting treatable causes: check FBC, U&E,
eGFR, LFTs, Ca2+, TFTs, glucose, B12, folate. Consider: MSU, CXR, ECG.

Differential diagnosis
• Acute delirium—b p. 1010
• Depression—b p. 1000
• Communication difficulties—deafness, dysphasia, or language difficulties

PreventionN
• 2˚ prevention: review and treat vascular risk factors
• Offer referral to genetic counselling to those thought to have a genetic
cause for their dementia, and refer unaffected relatives

General management
• Refer All patients should be referred to the mental health services for
the elderly or a memory assessment clinic for formal diagnosis, exclusion
of treatable causes, ongoing specialist support and assessment, and care
planning. Refer to a social worker for community support
• Apply principles of rehabilitation (b p. 204; b p. 582)
• Support carers (b p. 220). Advise re benefits (b p. 222), self-help
groups, respite care. Warn that dementia is progressive and prepare
carers for a time when the patient does not recognize them
• Discuss whilst sufferer still has capacity Along with carers, the use of
advanced statements, lasting power of attorney (b p. 122), advanced
decisions to refuse treatment, and preferred place of care plans
• Treat concurrent problems (e.g. UTI, chest infection, anaemia,
pain) They make dementia worse. Consider possible side effects of
medication. 0 40% have concurrent depression
• Management of memory loss Notebook to record ‘tasks must do’;
electronic prompts on mobile phone; medication dispensers

Management of behavioural (non-cognitive) symptoms
• Maintain a constant environment if possible

Dementia

• Safety—arrange for door catches to prevent wandering, and take up
loose carpets to prevent falls; consider fire and electrical safety
• Avoid sedatives wherever possible as may worsen confusion—if
needed use very low dose and review regularly
• Antipsychotic drugs for patients with dementiaN Do not use anti­
psychotics for mild to moderate non-cognitive symptoms because of the
risk of severe adverse reaction, CVA (2x risk), and death. Consider in
severe agitation only if:
• Risks and benefits have been assessed and discussed
• Patient is carefully monitored for changes in cognition
• Co-morbid conditions, such as depression, have been considered
• Dose is started low and titrated upwards
• Treatment is time-limited and regularly reviewed

Driving and dementia Inform the DVLA. Licensing depends on clini-

cal condition.

Assessment of capacity to make decisions b p. 122
Alzheimer’s dementia Most common form of dementia. Cause:

unknown—defective genes found on chromosomes 14, 19, and 21. Risk
factors: FH, Down’s syndrome (onset at ~30y), late onset depression,
hypothyroidism, history of head injury. Presents with steady d in memory
and cognition. Onset: any age—normally >40y. 5:4 80.7.
Drug management of cognitive symptoms Specialist-initiated—refer.
Preferred drug varies according to severity of cognitive deficit:
• Mild/moderate Anticholinesterase inhibitors (e.g. donepezil,
galantamine, rivastigmine) d rate of decline.
• Moderate/severe Memantine d clinical/cognitive decline
Alois Alzheimer (1864–1915)—German neuropathologist/psychiatrist.
Vascular (multi-infarct) dementia Multiple lacunar infarcts or
larger strokes cause generalized intellectual impairment. Tends to occur
in a stepwise progression with each subsequent infarct. The final picture
is one of dementia, pseudobulbar palsy, and shuffling gait with small steps.
Treatment is as for secondary prevention of TIA/stroke—b p. 564
Lewy body dementia Fluctuating but persistent cognitive impairment, parkinsonism, and hallucinations. No specific treatment. Avoid
antipsychotics as they can be fatal. Use benzodiazepines if tranquillization
is necessary. Friedrich H. Lewy (1885–1950)—German neurologist.
Pick’s dementia Dementia characterized by personality change associated with frontal lobe signs such as gross tactlessness. Lack of restraint may
lead to stealing, practical jokes, and unusual sexual adventures. Treatment
is supportive. Arnold Pick (1851–1924)—Czech neurologist/psychiatrist.

Mental health

Eating disorders
Identification of and screening for eating disorders Target
groups for screening include:
•	Young women with low BMI compared with age norms
• Patients consulting with weight concerns who are not overweight
• Women with menstrual disturbances or amenorrhoea
• Patients with GI symptoms
• Patients with symptoms/signs of starvation—sensitivity to cold, delayed
gastric emptying, constipation, d BP, bradycardia, hypothermia
• Patients with physical signs of repeated vomiting—pitted teeth 9
dental caries, general weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, renal damage,
i risk of UTI, epileptic fits, d K+
• Children with poor growth
•	Young people with type 1 DM and poor treatment adherence
Screen target populations with simple screening questionsN
• Do you worry excessively about your weight?
• Do you think you have an eating problem?
• Patients who are pregnant or have DM are at particular risk of complications if they have eating disorders. Refer early for specialist support and
ensure everyone involved in care is aware of the eating disorder.

Anorexia nervosa Prevalence 0.02–0.04%. 5 >> 4. Usually begins in
adolescence. Peak prevalence at 16–17y. Features:
• Refusal to keep body weight >85% of that expected (BMI <17.5kg/m2)
• Intense fear of gaining weight, though underweight
• Disturbed experience of body weight or shape or undue influence of
shape on self-image
• Amenorrhoea in women for ≥3mo and d sexual interest

Patients tend to have a set daily calorific intake, e.g. 600–1,000 calories,
and may employ strategies, e.g. bingeing and vomiting, purging, or excessive exercise to try to lose weight. Depression and social withdrawal are
common as are symptoms s to starvation.
ManagementN
• Give ongoing support and information
• Check electrolytes
• Refer to a specialist eating disorders clinic (if available) or the mental
health team. Treatment involves family therapy for adolescents,
psychotherapy, and possible admission for refeeding
Follow-up Patients with enduring anorexia nervosa not under s care
follow-up should be offered an annual physical and mental health check.
• Many patients with anorexia nervosa have compromised cardiac
function. Avoid prescribing drugs which adversely affect cardiac function
(e.g. antipsychotics, TCAs, macrolide antibiotics, some antihistamines). If
prescribing is essential then follow up with ECG monitoring.

Eating disorders

Bulimia nervosa Prevalence 1–2%. Mainly 5 aged 16-–40y. Features:
• Recurrent episodes of binge eating, far beyond normally accepted
amounts of food
• Inappropriate compensatory behaviour to prevent weight i, e.g.
vomiting; use of laxatives, diuretics, and/or appetite suppressants.
Bulimics can be subdivided into those that purge and those that just
use fasting and exercise to control their weight
• Self-image unduly influenced by body shape (see Anorexia nervosa)
•	Normal menses and normal weight. If low BMI classified as anorexia

Management
• Give ongoing support and information
• Check electrolytes
• First-line treatment:
• Evidence-based self-help programme, e.g. Overcoming Bulimia—
available from M www.overcomingbulimiaonline.com
• Antidepressant medication—fluoxetine 60mg od is the drug
of choice
• If unsuccessful, refer to a specialist eating disorders clinic (if available)
or the mental health team. CBT may help
Advice for patients purging
• Vomiting Advise patients to avoid brushing their teeth after vomiting,
rinse with a non-acid mouthwash after vomiting, and d acid oral
environment (e.g. by limiting acid foods)
• Laxatives Where laxative abuse is present, advise patients to gradually
d laxative intake. Laxative abuse does not significantly d calorie
absorption

Binge eating disorder A pattern of consumption of large amounts
of food, even when a patient is not hungry. Common. Usually associated
with obsessive feelings about food and body image, feelings of guilt/disgust
about the amounts consumed, and/or a feeling of lack of control.
Management
• Give ongoing support and information
• Provide an evidence-based self-help programme as a first step and/or
antidepressant medication (SSRI is the drug group of choice)
• If unsuccessful refer for specialist help. CBT might be helpful
• In all cases, provide concurrent advice and support to tackle any
co-morbid obesity (b p. 178)

Mental health

Other psychological conditions
Seasonal affective disorder (SAD) ‘Winter blues’—recurrent disorder involving ‘seasonal’ episodes of depression, usually in the winter
months. Affects ~2% adults. 5:4 82:1. Peak incidence in third decade.

Symptoms Depression + i sleep, i food intake (with carbohydrate craving), and weight i. 30% experience elatory mood swings in summer.
Management SSRIs (particularly sertraline); phototherapy (30–90min/d in
the early morning—effects should be seen within 3wk). Light boxes can
be borrowed from psychiatry departments, hired, or bought (contact SAD
Association for more information M www.sada.org.uk).

Borderline personality disorder Patients may prefer ‘emotional
instability disorder’. Affects ~1% of the population. 5 > 4.Features:
• Pervasive and maladaptive patterns of behaviour, thinking, and control
of emotions
• Significant instability of personal relationships, self-image, and mood
• Impulsive behaviour
• Tendency towards suicidal thoughts/self-harm
• Possible transient psychotic symptoms

Recognition Consider if repeated self-harm, persistent risk-taking, or
marked emotional instability. If suspected, refer for specialist assessment.
Crisis managementN
• Assess current risk to self/others—if a risk, request emergency
specialist assessment and/or acute admission voluntarily or under the
Mental Health Act (b p. 1122)
• Ask about past episodes and management strategies that worked
• Help to identify manageable changes that might enable the patient to
deal with current problems
• Offer follow-up and contact the patient if the appointment is not kept
• Refer for specialist care if risk/distress continues to i
Specialist treatment of personality disorder
• Intensive structured psychological therapy, e.g. STEPPS programme
• Drugs—SSRIs are used for impulsive behaviour; low-dose
antipsychotics for paranoid ideas; mood stabilizers for emotional
instability. 0 Be careful taking over prescribing from specialist care—
there are no drugs licensed for use for borderline personality disorder
and evidence of efficacy is poor
• Risk of overdose is i amongst patients with personality disorder.

Factitious disorder (Munchausen syndrome) Intentional feigning
of physical/psychological symptoms to assume the sick role (9 hospital
admission). Can be difficult to detect. Differs from malingering as there is
no external reward (e.g. financial). Common presentations
• Physical Dermatitis artefacta, PUO, bruising disorders, brittle
DM, diarrhoea of unknown cause; neurological symptoms, e.g.
pseudoparalysis or pseudofits (neurologica diabolica); abdominal pain
(laparotomophilia migrans); chest pain (cardiopathia fantastica)

Other psychological conditions

• Psychological Feigned psychosis, fictitious bereavement, fictitious
overdose
Management Exclude any other basis for presenting pathology. Explain
findings to the patient exploring possible causes. Assess psychological and
social difficulties. Consider referral to specialist mental health services.
Baron H.K.F.F. von Munchausen (1720–1797)—German traveller/soldier.
Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy Caregiver—typically a mother
with child—seeks repeated medical investigations and needless treatment
for the person he/she is caring for. The child or person being cared for
may actually be harmed by the carer to achieve these aims. Commonly
reported symptoms include: neurological symptoms, bleeding, rashes.
Management Often difficult to detect and even harder to prove. A form
of abuse that must be taken seriously and handled with care (b p. 924).
Involve all relevant agencies early (e.g. social services, paediatrics).
Malingering Intentional production or feigning of physical or psychological symptoms to assume the sick role for a known external purpose. Malingering is not considered a mental illness or psychopathology,
although it can occur in the context of other mental illnesses. Forms:
• Pure malingering The individual falsifies all symptoms
• Partial malingering The individual has symptoms but exaggerates the
impact they have upon daily functioning
• Simulation The individual acts out symptoms of a specific disability
• False attribution The individual has valid symptoms but is dishonest as
to the source of the problems, e.g. attributing neck pain to an RTA to
obtain compensation
Differential diagnosis True medical or psychiatric illness yet to be diagnosed; factitious disorder; somatization disorder
Common motivating factors
• Avoidance of work and/or other • Obtaining narcotics
• Avoidance of/release from jail
responsibility
•	Need for attention
•	Litigation to obtain money
Management Difficult. As doctors, we tend to believe our patients.
• Exclude causes for symptoms through careful history/examination
• Avoid prescribing drugs and unnecessary referrals as these might
perpetuate symptoms
• Avoid certifying the patient as unfit to work or to perform activities—
if the patient is unhappy about this, suggest a second opinion
• Tactfully explain your findings and conclusions to the patient and
explore the reasons for the behaviour
• Provide support to find more appropriate ways to solve problems

Cancer and palliative care

Principles of cancer care
If cancer is suspected, comprehensive assessment of patient and disease is
needed before treatment decisions are made. Treatment can be:
• Radical Curative intent—surgery and/or drug/radiotherapy
• Adjuvant Given after surgery when micrometastatic disease is
suspected—decision to proceed is based on the likelihood of relapse
• Neoadjuvant Given prior to definitive treatment to make treatment
easier and more likely to succeed
• Palliative When cure is not possible and symptom management is the
priority—b p. 1028

Assessment of the tumour
• Histological nature of the tumour Tissue of origin; cancer type (e.g.
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell cancer); degree of differentiation; and
tumour grade. High-grade, poorly differentiated tumours tend to have
a poorer outcome than low-grade, well-differentiated tumours
• Biological behaviour of the tumour Tumour markers produced by
cancers may be a useful adjunct to histological classification and staging
and can be used to influence and monitor efficacy of treatment—see
Table 28.1. 0 Tumour markers can be i in non-malignant conditions
• Anatomical extent of the tumour Determined through clinical,
radiological, biochemical, and surgical assessment. Routine blood tests
(e.g. LFTs, bone profile) may also indicate the presence of metastases

Cancer staging Staging allows the plan of treatment to be made.
TMN classification Widely used classification of tumours. Exact criteria
for staging depend on the primary organ site:
• T Primary tumour—graded T1–T4 with increasing size of primary
• N Regional lymph nodes—advancing nodal disease is graded N0–N3
• M Presence (M1) or absence (M0) of metastases
Stage grouping
• Stage 1 Clinical examination reveals a tumour confined to the primary
organ. The lesion tends to be operable and completely resectable
• Stage 2 Clinical examination shows evidence of local spread into
surrounding tissue and first draining LNs. The lesion is operable and
resectable but there is a higher risk of further spread of disease
• Stage 3 Clinical examination reveals extensive primary tumour with
fixation to deeper structures and local invasion. The lesion may not be
operable and may require a combination of treatment modalities
• Stage 4 Evidence of distant metastases beyond the site of origin. The
primary site may be surgically inoperable

Other factors
• Patient’s performance status The Eastern Cooperative Oncology
Group (ECOG) Performance Status Scale is widely used (see Table
28.2). Patients with ECOG score >2 are usually deemed unsuitable for
most chemotherapy interventions
• Mortality, morbidity, and efficacy of the procedure
• Patient preferences

but the role of the GP is important at this time, even if mainly supportive.
• Keep in touch with the family and up to date with treatment—provide
support (e.g. advice on benefits/local services), preventive care (e.g. flu
vaccination for patients and/or carers), and general medical care
• Liaise with the secondary care teams involved, and provide
continuity if care is passed from one specialist team to another
• If the patient does not survive, provide ongoing support to the family

Cancer and palliative care

Surgery for cancer
Surgery has 3 main roles in cancer management:
Diagnosis and staging Advances in imaging and laparoscopic techniques have d the number of patients requiring open surgery to confirm a
cancer diagnosis. Surgical staging remains important in:
• Breast cancer—‘sentinel’ axillary node biopsy is needed to accurately
predict the state of nodal disease
• Ovarian cancer—tumour deposits on the peritoneal surface are poorly
visualized with conventional imaging. Direct visualization is required
using laparotomy or laparoscopy
• Certain abdominal malignancies—laparoscopic assessment of extent
and spread of tumour may be performed prior to resection

Curative surgery
Non-metastatic disease Surgery with curative intent is dependent on
complete resection of the tumour with a margin of normal tissue. Local
control of tumours with a propensity to spread to lymph nodes may
be improved with resection of the draining group of nodes, e.g. vulval
tumours. However, even if the tumour was completely resected, surgery
can still fail to cure either as a result of:
• Development of metastatic disease as a result of the presence of
micrometastatic deposits unidentifiable at the time of surgery
• Development of local relapse as a result of inadequate margins.
Surgical margins can be limited by patient-related factors (e.g. only a
partial lobectomy may be possible in patients with lung cancer because
of poor underlying respiratory function) or by tumour-related margins
(e.g. invasion of the tumour to a vital structure such as the aorta)
Metastatic disease Surgery may be curative in a limited number of
tumours with metastases. However, this is much less common, requires
careful patient selection, and is best performed by a specialist team.
Circumstances in which curative surgery may be offered include:
• Isolated metastases from breast cancer with a long disease-free
interval
• Liver metastases from colorectal cancer
• Pulmonary metastases from osteosarcoma or soft tissue sarcoma
Palliative surgery Surgery can be effective in achieving good symptom control in the palliative setting, but decision to proceed must
be carefully considered particularly as patients may have limited life
expectancy, poor performance status, and rapid tumour progression.
Ideally such decisions should be multidisciplinary and involve surgeons
specialized in oncology and experienced in palliative management (see
Table 28.3).

Comments

Cancers causing
obstructive symptoms

0 Most
malignancyassociated bowel
obstructions are
functional, not
anatomical

Surgery to relieve the obstruction may be warranted even
if the underlying disease is incurable with locally advanced
disease or distant metastases
Bowel obstruction this occurs most commonly in patients
with colonic or ovarian cancer
Oesophageal or bronchial obstruction laser therapy of an
intraluminal mass may restore the lumen
Obstructive hydronephrosis nephrostomy or ureteric
catheters may relieve the obstruction
Placement of a stent may help relieve the symptoms of
dysphagia, dyspnoea, jaundice, and large bowel obstruction

Fistulae

Fistulae, often arising as a result of pelvic tumours or
as a side effect of radiotherapy, can be associated with
distressing malodours and excessive discharge
Surgery may provide excellent palliation but may not be useful
in those with multiple sites of fistulae or rapidly advancing
intra-abdominal disease where life expectancy is limited

Jaundice

Radiological and/or endoscopic stent placement: can relieve
obstructive jaundice secondary to extrinsic pressure from
lymph nodes on the biliary system or intrinsic pressure from
cholangiocarcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma
Complications infection or blockage necessitate replacement
Surgical relief by choledochoenterostomy; avoids the
problems associated with stents and may be indicated in
a small minority with excellent performance status and
slowly growing disease

Spinal cord
compression and
brain tumours

Urgent referral for neurological assessment for
decompressive surgery or vertebroplasty is indicated for
confirmed spinal disease or operable brain tumours

Gastrointestinal
bleeding

A wide range of endoscopic techniques have been
developed to stop bleeding from benign and malignant
causes, including sclerotherapy with adrenaline, laser
coagulation, and radiological embolization
These techniques may avoid the need for major surgery in
patients who have a limited life expectancy

Bone metastases

Prophylactic fixation of a long bone may reduce either pain
and/or the risk of pathological fracture in patients with:
• Lesions in weight-bearing bones
• Destruction of >50% of the cortex
• Pain on weight-bearing
• Lytic lesions
In all cases fixation should be followed by radiotherapy to
control growth and promote healing

Pain

If the expected morbidity of the procedure is low, surgical
debulking of large, slowly growing tumours can reduce pain.
Neurosurgical approaches such as cordotomy are only
rarely considered

Chemotherapy
Chemotherapy is the use of chemical agents in the cure or palliation of
malignant disease.

Drug groups Include:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Antibiotics, e.g. bleomycin
Alkylating agents, e.g. busulfan
Antimetabolites, e.g. methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil
Alkaloids, e.g. vincristine
Platinum derivatives—DNA intercalating agents, e.g. cisplatin
Enzymes, e.g. asparaginase
Hormones, e.g. sex hormones, corticosteroids
Biological agents, e.g. interferon, monoclonal antibodies (e.g.
rituximab)
• Others, e.g. hydroxycarbamide, retinoids
These agents work in a variety of ways to inhibit tumour growth and/or
cause tumour cell damage. Normal cells may be damaged at the same
time as tumour cells, resulting in the high levels of toxicity experienced
by patients.

Choice of agent Depends on known activity of the agent, cost, and
patient factors. It is a specialist decision.

Types of tumour Response to chemotherapy depends on type and

grade of tumour being treated. Broadly tumours can be divided into:
• Those likely to respond Leukaemia, lymphoma (Hodgkin’s and
intermediate-/high-grade non-Hodgkin’s), testicular tumours, small cell
lung cancer, embryonal tumours, choriocarcinoma, ovarian cancer,
sarcoma, breast cancer, prostate cancer
• Those that may respond Low-grade non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, GI
cancer, brain/CNS tumours, melanoma, bladder and uterine cancer
• Those unlikely to respond Non-small cell lung, renal, pancreatic, head
and neck, cervical, and liver cancer

Combination chemotherapy Often different chemotherapeutic
agents are combined to i their chances of effect. Agents acting in different
ways may potentiate each others’ actions, and using combinations reduces
the risk of resistance (if one agent does not have any effect, another may).
Choosing agents with different side effect profiles reduces cumulative
toxic effects.
Intermittent chemotherapy Particularly useful for cytotoxic drugs.
Intermittent treatment exploits the difference in recovery rates between
normal and malignant tissues. Gaps between cycles of treatment allow normal tissue (particularly the immune system) to recover, but the malignant
tissue does not recover to such a large extent (see Figure 28.1). The population of malignant cells diminishes relative to the normal cells with each cycle.
Adjuvant chemotherapy Given to prevent relapse after primary

treatment of a non-metastatic tumour for which relapse rate is known to
be high. An example is adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

Neutropenic sepsis Neutropenic sepsis is defined as fever of ≥38.0ºC
for ≥2h when the neutrophil count is <1.0 × 109/L. Causes:
• Chemotherapy (most common cause)
• Radiotherapy—if large volumes of bone marrow are irradiated, e.g.
pelvic radiotherapy
• Malignant infiltration of the bone marrow, e.g. prostate/breast cancer
Risks of neutropenia Bacterial and fungal infection. Risk of infection i
sharply as neutrophil counts fall to <1.0 × 109/L, with greatest risk at
counts <0.1 × 109/L. Neutropenia for >5d is a further risk factor. Usually
patients are most at risk in the nadir period from 1wk after therapy.
Presentation and primary care management Symptoms/signs may be
minimal—have a high index of suspicion. Neutropenic, septic patients can
deteriorate rapidly and become hypotensive or moribund within hours.
Early referral for investigation and specialist management is critical.
• If a high-risk patient complains of chills, fever, rigors, sore throat, or
generalized aches, check an urgent FBC
• Mouth ulcers and i fatigue can be signs of neutropenia
• Development of fever in a patient with neutropenia is a medical
emergency caused by infection until proven otherwise.

Cancer and palliative care

Radiotherapy
Mechanism of action Ionizing radiation damages cells. Radiotherapy
aims to deliver a dose of irradiation to an area which allows normal tissues, but not the cancer, to recover from the damage.
Delivery of radiotherapy May be used alone or with chemotherapy.

Once maximum dose of radiotherapy has been received by any area, that
area cannot usually be irradiated again
• External beam External source of ionizing radiation (e.g. gamma rays)
is aimed at a target point in the body. Patients may be immobilized, e.g.
with boards/moulds, to ensure delivery of treatment to the correct
place. Can be single dose (e.g. for palliative reasons) or fractionated
into several doses spread over weeks. Fractionation i effect
• Brachytherapy Delivery of radiation by placing a radioactive source
within or close to the malignancy, e.g. caesium-137 in the uterus
Side effects Skin reactions—see Table 28.4; non-skin reactions—see

Table 28.5 Non-skin side effects of radiotherapy
Side effect

Description/action

Sore mouth/
throat

Associated with radiotherapy to the head/neck. Advise patients to
visit the dentist prior to treatment; avoid smoking, alcohol, and spicy
foods; rest voice when radiotherapy reaction becomes established
Consider treatment with: normal saline/bicarbonate mouthwashes;
antiseptic mouthwashes (e.g. chlorhexidine—though alcohol may
sting); soluble aspirin (can be gargled) or paracetamol; benzydamine
mouthwash; topical local anaesthetics; topical steroids; coating
agents (e.g. sucralfate). If insufficient fluid/food intake, consider
nutritional support via NG tube and/or referral for gastrostomy (if
weight loss >10%)

Dysphagia

May result from thoracic radiotherapy. Avoid smoking, spirits, and
spicy food. Consider treatment with: antacid; sucralfate; soluble
paracetamol or aspirin; NSAID po/PR

Nausea and
vomiting

Radiotherapy to the abdomen often causes nausea as a result of
serotonin release. Consider prophylactic antiemetic therapy with a
serotonin inhibitor, e.g. ondansetron

Diarrhoea

Frequently accompanies abdominal/pelvic radiotherapy
Management: dietary modification (e.g. d dietary fibre) may help.
Supply with loperamide—4mg initial dose then 2mg every 2h until
symptoms settle (4mg every 4h at night). Proctitis: may accompany
rectal/prostatic irradiation. Treat with rectal steroids

Pneumonitis

Acute pneumonitis can develop 1–3mo after treatment and is
associated with a fever, dry cough, and breathlessness. Differential
diagnosis: pneumonia. CXR—shows lung infiltration confined within
the treatment volume
Management: steroids—start with 40mg od prednisolone and reduce
over a period of weeks as improvement occurs
0 Pulmonary fibrosis may occur >12mo after treatment

Cerebral
oedema

Can occur after cranial irradiation. Steroid dose is d after
completion of radiotherapy. Consider i dose again

Memory loss

Depending on the parts of the cranium irradiated, both longand short-term memory problems can occur after cranial
irradiation.Treatment is supportive; some recovery may occur

Somnolence
syndrome

Occurs within a few weeks of brain irradiation. Presents with: nausea/
vomiting; anorexia; dysarthria; ataxia; profound lethargy
Treatment is supportive. Recovery may occur spontaneously

Cancer and palliative care

Palliative care in general practice
‘Any man’s death diminishes me because I am involved in mankind’
Devotions Meditation 17, John Donne (1572–1631)
• Death is the natural end to life—not a failure of medicine.
Palliative care starts when the emphasis changes from curing disease and
prolonging life to relieving symptoms and maintaining well-being or ‘quality of life’. On average, GPs have 1–2 patients with terminal disease at any
time and can get more personally involved with them than other patients.

End-of-life care (EOLC) 75% of deaths are ‘predictable’ and follow a
period of chronic illness where end-of-life care (for those likely to die in
<12mo) would be appropriate.
Problems arising are a complex mix of physical, psychological, social, cultural, and spiritual factors involving both patients and carers. To respond
adequately good lines of communication and close multidisciplinary
teamwork is needed. Local palliative care teams are invaluable sources
of advice and support and frequently produce booklets with advice on
aspects of palliative care for GPs.
Symptom control must be tailored to the needs of the individual. A few
basic rules apply:
• Carefully diagnose the cause of the symptom
• Explain the symptom to the patient
• Discuss treatment options
• Set realistic goals
• Anticipate likely problems
• Review regularly

Identification It may be difficult to identify when patients are nearing
end of life, particularly for non-cancer illness (see Figure 28.2). This can
lead to access to EOLC not being offered at all or being offered late.
Advanced care planning The 2008 National End-of-life Care Strategy
recommends assessment of people identified as approaching the end of
life and agreement with them about how to meet their preferences using
advanced care planning with regular review. This may include:
• Symptom control
• Discussion about preferences for care including ‘do not attempt to
resuscitate’ directives (b p. 1052)
• Advance directives to withhold treatment (b p. 123)
• Discussion about preferred place of death—60–67% of people would
prefer to die at home; currently 53% die in hospital but 40% have no
medical necessity to die there

Communication about EOLC People are more likely to talk about end
of life with their GP than any other professional, but only 33% of GPs are
confident to initiate a discussion with a patient about end-of-life issues.
Specific training i confidence.

Palliative care in general practice

Preferred priorities for care (PPC) The PPC document is a tool for discussion and recording of EOLC wishes. It is available to download from the
NHS EOLC website.

The Gold Standards Framework Aims to improve quality of
palliative care provided by the primary care team by improving the
practice-based organization of care of dying patients. The Framework
focusses on: optimizing continuity of care, teamwork, advanced planning
(including out-of-hours), symptom control, and patient, carer, and staff
support. Evaluation data show the framework i the proportion of patients
dying in their preferred place and improves quality of care as perceived by
the practitioners involved.
Liverpool Care Pathway Is a model of ‘best practice’ to improve
care of the dying in the last hours/days of life. It covers physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of care and widely used in the community, both in care homes and in private residences. Over recent years the
Liverpool Care Pathway has gained a controversial reputation as a ‘pathway to death’ but, if used correctly, with full consultation with all medical
staff and family members/carers involved, it still has a very important place
in managing the final days/hours of a patient’s life.

Pain and general debility
Pain control Pain control is the cornerstone of palliative care. Cancer
pain is multifactorial—be aware of physical and psychological factors.
Principles of pain control b p. 212
Pain-relieving drugs b p. 214
Management of specific types of pain Table 28.6

Weakness, fatigue, and drowsiness Almost a universal symptom.
Reversible causes
• Drugs—opioids, benzodiazepines, steroids (proximal muscle
weakness), diuretics (dehydration and biochemical abnormalities),
antihypertensives (postural hypotension)
• Emotional problems—depression, anxiety, fear, apathy
• Biochemical abnormalities—hypercalcaemia, DM, electrolyte
disturbance, uraemia, liver disease, thyroid dysfunction
• Anaemia		
• Infection
• Poor nutrition
• Prolonged bed rest
• Raised intracranial pressure (drowsiness only)
Management Treat reversible causes. Provide advice on modification
of lifestyle. If drowsiness/fatigue persist consider a trial of dexamethasone 4mg/d or antidepressant. Although steroids make muscle wasting
worse, in the short term they may improve general fatigue and well-being.
Provide psychological support to patients and carers. Consider referral to
physiotherapy; review aids and appliances; review home layout (possibly
with referral to OT); and/or review home care arrangements.

Hypercalcaemia Occurs with 10% malignant tumours—particularly
myeloma (>30%) and breast cancer (40%).
Presentation and differential diagnosis b p. 366
• Always suspect hypercalcaemia if someone is iller than expected for
no obvious reason. Untreated hypercalcaemia can be fatal.
Management Depending on the general state of the patient, make a decision whether to treat the hypercalcaemia or not. If a decision is made not
to treat, provide symptom control and do not check the serum calcium
again. If you decide to treat:
• Asymptomatic patient with corrected calcium <3mmol/L Monitor
• Symptomatic and/or corrected calcium >3mmol/L Arrange
treatment with IV fluids and bisphosphonates via oncologist/
palliative care team immediately. Check serum calcium 7–10d
post-treatment. 20% do not respond, and there is no benefit from
re-treating with the same bisphosphonate. Zoledronic acid, although
more expensive than pamidronate, works for 72x as long (6wk).
Consider maintenance with regular IV bisphosphonate. Many initially
responsive to bisphosphonates become unresponsive with time;
monthly sc denosumab is an option for those with persistent/relapsed
hypercalcaemia of malignancy

20–60mg/24h can also be given via syringe driver
• Liver capsule pain dexamethasone 4–8mg/d. Titrate dose to the
minimum that controls pain. Alternatively try NSAID + PPI cover
• Gastric distension may be helped by an antacid 9 an anti-foaming agent
(e.g. Asilone®). Alternatively a prokinetic may help, e.g. metoclopramide
or domperidone 10mg tds before meals
• Upper GI tumour often neuropathic element of pain; coeliac plexus
block may help; refer to the palliative care team
• Consider drug causes NSAIDs are a common iatrogenic cause
• Acute/subacute obstruction b p. 1033

Neuropathic pain
(pain associated
with altered
sensation)

• Often burning/shooting pain; usually only partially responsive to
opioids—titrate to the maximum tolerated dose of opioid
• If inadequate add a neuropathic agent, e.g. amitriptyline 10–25mg nocte,
increasing as needed every 2wk to 75–150mg. Alternatives include
gabapentin, pregabalin, duloxetine, and clonazepam
• If pain is due to nerve compression resulting from tumour,
dexamethasone 4–8mg od may help
• Other options: TENS; nerve block; topical lidocaine patches; specialist
treatment options, e.g. ketamine (seek expert advice)

Rectal pain

•

spasm

• Treat reversible causes. i fluids. Toilet regularly
• Try oxybutynin 5mg tds, tolterodine 2mg bd, propiverine 15mg od/
bd/tds, or trospium 20mg bd
• Amitriptyline 10—75mg nocte is often effective
• If catheterized—try instilling 20mL of intravesical bupivacaine 0.25%
for 15min tds or oxybutynin 5mL in 30mL od/bd/tds
• NSAIDs can also be useful
• Steroids, e.g. dexamethasone 4–8mg od may d tumour related
bladder inflammation
• In the terminal situation hyoscine butylbromide 60–120mg/24h or
glycopyrronium 0.4–0.8mg/24h sc can be helpful

Pain of short
duration

For example, dressing changes—try a short-acting opioid e.g. fentanyl
citrate 200 micrograms lozenge sucked for 15min prior to the procedure
or a breakthrough dose of oral morphine 20min prior to the procedure

Topical drugs, e.g. rectal steroids

• Painful mouth—benzydamine mouthwash 9 lidocaine spray
•	Ulcers or painful areas—hydrocortisone pellets topically qds after
eating and nocte
• Oral cancer pain—topical NSAIDs, e.g. soluble aspirin or diclofenac
• Chemotherapy-induced ulcers— sucralfate suspension
• Dry mouth—review medication that might be causing dry mouth,
e.g. antidepressants, opioids. Try salivary stimulants, e.g. iced water,
pineapple chunks, chewing gum, boiled sweets, or mints. Consider
saliva substitutes, e.g. Glandosane® spray
• Radiotherapy-induced dryness—pilocarpine
• Excessive salivation—amitriptyline 10–100mg nocte, hyoscine, or
glycopyrronium via syringe driver
Dysphagia May be due to physical obstruction (by tumour bulk) or
functional obstruction (neurological deficit).
• Treat the cause if possible, e.g. celestin tube for oesophageal tumour
• If the patient is hungry and wishes to be fed consider referral for a
percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)
• If the patient does not wish to have a PEG ask whether he/she would
like subcutaneous fluids and treat symptomatically with mouth care,
anxiolytics, analgesia, and sedation
Hiccup A distressing symptom. Treatment is often unsatisfactory.
• General measures Rebreathing with a paper bag; pharyngeal stimulation
by drinking cold water or taking a teaspoon of granulated sugar
• Peripheral hiccups Irritation of the phrenic nerve or diaphragm—try
metoclopramide (10mg tds), antacids containing simeticone (e.g.
Asilone®), dexamethasone (4–12mg/d), or ranitidine (150mg bd)
• Central hiccups Due to medullary stimulation, e.g. i ICP, uraemia—
try chlorpromazine (10–25mg tds/qds), dexamethasone (4–12mg/d),
nifedipine (10mg tds), or baclofen (5mg bd)
Ascites Free fluid in the peritoneal cavity. Common with ovarian cancer
(50% patients). Presents with abdominal distension. Signs: shifting dullness
to percussion 9 fluid thrill. Depending on clinical state consider referring
for radio- or chemotherapy if appropriate.
Symptom control
• Give analgesia for discomfort
• Refer for paracentesis and/or peritoneovenous shunt
• Try diuretics—furosemide 20–40mg od and/or spironolactone
100–400mg od. May take a week to produce maximal effect.
0 Monitor albumin level—if low, diuretics make ascites worse

Other GI problems

• Dexamethasone 2–4mg daily may help—discontinue if not effective
• ‘Squashed stomach syndrome’—try prokinetics, e.g. domperidone or
metoclopramide 10mg tds

Constipation Passage of hard stools less frequently than the patient’s
own normal pattern. It is a very common symptom. Occult presentations
are common in the very elderly and frail and include:
• Confusion
• Abdominal pain
• Loss of appetite
•	Urinary retention
• Overflow diarrhoea
• Nausea/vomiting
• Constipation can herald spinal cord compression (b p. 478). If suspected, do a full neurological examination.
Management Pre-empt constipation by putting everyone at risk (e.g.
patients on opioids) on regular aperients. Treat reversible causes, e.g. give
analgesia if pain on defecation, alter diet (e.g. add prunes), i fluid intake.
• Treat with regular stool softener (e.g. lactulose, macrogol) 9 regular
bowel stimulant (e.g. senna) or a combination drug (e.g. co-danthrusate).
Titrate dose against response
• If that is ineffective consider adding rectal measures. If soft stools and
lax rectum—try bisacodyl suppositories (0 must come into direct
contact with rectum); if hard stools—try glycerin suppositories; insert
into the faeces, and allow to dissolve
• If still not cleared refer to the district nurse for lubricant 9 stimulant
enema (usually acts in 720min). Once cleared leave on a regular
aperient, with instructions to i aperients if constipation recurs
Gut fistulae Connections from the gut to other organs—commonly
skin, bladder, or vagina. Bowel fistulae are characterized by air passing
through the fistula channel. If well enough for surgery, refer to a surgeon.
If not fit for surgery consider referring to palliative care for octreotide.
Diarrhoea Clarify what the patient/carer means by diarrhoea. Less
common than constipation but can be distressing for the patient and difficult for the carer—especially if incontinence results.
Management
• i fluid intake—small amounts of clear fluids frequently
• Screen for infection (including pseudomembranous colitis if diarrhoea
after a course of antibiotics) and treat if necessary
• Ensure no overflow diarrhoea s to constipation; no excessive/erratic
laxative use; and no other medication is causing diarrhoea
• Consider giving aspirin (300–600mg tds)—d intestinal electrolyte and
water secretion caused by prostaglandins. May particularly help with
radiation induced diarrhoea
• Consider ondansetron 4mg tds for radiotherapy-induced diarrhoea
• Consider giving pancreatic enzyme supplements, e.g. Creon® 25,000
tds prior to meals if fat malabsorption (e.g. s to pancreatic carcinoma)
• Otherwise treat symptomatically with codeine phosphate 30–60mg
qds or loperamide 2mg tds/qds
• Refer to palliative care if unable to control symptoms

Cancer and palliative care

Skin, neurological, and orthopaedic
problems
Bed sores Due to pressure necrosis of the skin. Immobile patients are
at high risk—especially if frail 9 incontinent. Likely sites of pressure damage—shoulder blades, elbows, spine, buttocks, knees, ankles, and heels.
Bed sores heal slowly in terminally ill patients and are a source of discomfort and stress for both patients and carers (who often feel guilty that a
pressure sore is a mark of poor care).
• If at risk refer to the DN or palliative care nursing team for advice
on prevention of bed sores—protective mattresses and cushions,
incontinence advice, advice on positioning and movement
• Warn carers to make contact with the DN or palliative care nursing team if
a red patch does not improve 24h after relieving the pressure on the area
• Treat any sores that develop aggressively and admit if not resolving
Wound care Large wounds can have major impact on quality of life.
Patients with advanced disease have major risk factors for development
and poor healing of wounds—immobility, poor nutrition, skin infiltration
± breakdown due to malignancy. Skin infiltration causing ulceration or
fungating wounds can be particularly distressing.
Management The primary aim is comfort. Healing is a secondary aim and
may be impossible. Always involve the DN and/or specialist palliative care
nursing team early. Many hospitals also have wound care specialist nurses
who are valuable sources of advice.
Specific management problems See Table 28.8.

Raised intracranial pressure Occurs with p or s brain tumours.

Characterized by
• Headache—worse
on lying
•	Vomiting

• Confusion
• Diplopia

• Convulsions
• Papilloedema

Management
•	Unless a terminal event, refer urgently to neurosurgery for assessment.
Options include insertion of a shunt or cranial radiotherapy
• If no further active treatment is appropriate start symptomatic
treatment—raise the head of the bed, start dexamethasone 16mg/d
(stop if no response in 1wk), analgesia

Spinal cord compression b p. 478
Bone fractures Common in advanced cancer due to osteoporosis,

trauma as a result of falls, or metastases. Have a low index of suspicion if
a new bony pain develops. Treat with analgesia. Unless in a very terminal
state, confirm the fracture on X-ray and refer to orthopaedics or radiotherapy urgently for consideration of fixation (long bones, wrist, neck of
femur) and/or radiotherapy (rib fractures, vertebral fractures).
In the elderly, fracture of a long bone can present as acute confusion.

Skin, neurological, and orthopaedic problems

Table 28.8 Common wound management problems
Problem

Management

Pain

Exclude infection; ensure the dressing is comfortable; limit
frequency of dressing changes
Ensure adequate background analgesia; consider additional
analgesia for dressing changes and/or topical opioids on
the dressing

Excessive
exudate

Use high absorbency dressings with further packing on top
± plastic pads to protect clothing
Change the top layer of the dressing as often as needed
but avoid frequent changes of the dressing placed directly
on the wound
Protect the surrounding skin with a barrier cream/spray

Necrotic tissue

Use desloughing agents
Referral for surgical debridement may be necessary

Bleeding

Prevent bleeding during dressing changes by:
• Avoiding frequent dressing changes
• Using non-adherent dressings or dressings which liquefy
and can be washed off (e.g. Sorbsan®) and
• Irrigating the wound with saline to remove dressings
If there is surface bleeding—put pressure on the wound; if
pressure is not working try:
• Kaltostat®
• Adrenaline—1mg/mL (or 1:1,000) on a gauze pad, or
• Sucralfate liquid—place on a non-adherent dressing and
apply firmly to the bleeding area
Consider referral for radiotherapy or palliative surgery
(e.g. cautery)

Odour

Treat with systemic and/or topical metronidazole
Charcoal dressings can be helpful
Seal the wound, e.g. with additional layer of cling film
dressing
Try disguising the smell with deodorizers (e.g. Nilodor®)
used sparingly on top of the dressing—short-term
measure. Long-term, the deodorant smell often becomes
associated with the smell of the wound for the patient

Infection

Usually chronic and localized
Irrigate the wound with warm saline or under running
water in the shower/bath
If the surrounding skin is inflamed—swab the wound
and send for M,C&S then start oral antibiotics, e.g.
flucloxacillin 250–500mg qds or erythromycin 250–500mg
qds. Alter antibiotics depending on sensitivities of the
organisms grown

Respiratory problems
Cough Troublesome symptom. Prolonged bouts of coughing are
exhausting and frightening—especially if associated with breathlessness
and/or haemoptysis.
Haemoptysis b p. 297
Breathlessness Affects 70% of terminally ill patients. It is usually multifactorial. Breathlessness always has a psychological element—being short
of breath is frightening. Causes—see Figure 28.4.
Management of cough and breathlessness
General non-drug measures
• Generally reassure. Explain reasons for breathlessness/cough and
adaptations to lifestyle that might help, e.g. sitting up straight
• Breathing exercises can help—refer to physiotherapy
• Exclude treatable causes (see Box 28.1 and Figure 28.4)
• Steam inhalations/nebulized saline can help with tenacious secretions
• Try a stream of air over the face if the patient is breathless, e.g. fan,
open window
General drug measures
• Try simple linctus 5–10mL prn for cough
• Oral or subcutaneous opioids to d the subjective sensation of
breathlessness—start with 2.5mg morphine sulfate solution 4-hourly
and titrate upwards. Opioids may also help with cough—try pholcodine
10mL tds or morphine sulfate solution as for breathlessness. If already
on opioids, i dose by 25%. Titrate dose until symptoms are controlled
or side effects
• Try benzodiazepines—2–5mg diazepam od/bd for associated anxiety
+ lorazepam 1–2mg s/ling prn in between. Diazepam acts as a central
cough suppressant—try 2–10mg tds for cough
• Oxygen has a variable effect and is worth a try, although a hand-held
battery fan or electric fan may be just as effective
• Hyoscine 400–600 micrograms 4–8-hourly (or 0.6–2.4mg/24h via syringe
driver) and/or ipratropium inhalers/nebulized ipratropium d secretions
Specific measures
• Chest infection Treat with nebulized saline to make secretions less
viscous 9 antibiotics (if not considered a terminal event)
• Post-nasal drip Steam inhalations, steroid nasal spray or drops 9
antibiotics
•	Laryngeal irritation Try inhaled steroids, e.g. Clenil® 100 micrograms/
actuation 2 puffs bd
•	Bronchospasm Try bronchodilators 9 inhaled or oral steroids.
0 Salbutamol may help cough even in the absence of wheeze
• Gastric reflux Try antacids containing simeticone (e.g. Asilone®)
•	Lung cancer Try inhaled sodium cromoglicate 10mg qds; local
anaesthesia using nebulized bupivacaine or lidocaine can be helpful—
refer for specialist advice (avoid eating/drinking for 1h afterwards to
avoid aspiration). Palliative radiotherapy or chemotherapy can also
relieve cough in patients with lung cancer—refer

Respiratory problems

Stridor Coarse wheezing sound that results from the obstruction of a
major airway, e.g. larynx.
Management
• Corticosteroids (e.g. dexamethasone 16mg/d) can give relief
• Consider referral for radiotherapy or endoscopic insertion of a stent
if appropriate
• If a terminal event—sedate with high doses of midazolam (10–40mg
repeated prn)

Cancer and palliative care

Haematological and vascular
problems
Bleeding/haemorrhage In all patients likely to bleed (e.g. in end-stage
leukaemia) pre-warn carers and give them a strategy.

Severe, life-threatening bleed Make a decision whether the cause of the
bleed is treatable or a terminal event. This is best done in advance but
bleeding cannot always be predicted.
• Severe bleed—active treatment—b p. 1075
• Severe bleed—no active treatment:
• Stay with the patient
• Give sedative medication, e.g. midazolam 20–40mg sc/IV or
lorazepam 1–2mg s/ling. If in pain, consider sc opioid
• Support carers, as big bleeds are extremely distressing
Non-life-threatening bleed: first aid measures
• In all cases: reassure; monitor frequently
• Surface bleeding—pressure on wound; if pressure is not working, try
Kaltostat® or adrenaline (1mg/mL or 1:1,000) on a gauze pad
• Nosebleeds—nasal packing or cautery
Non-life-threatening bleed: follow-up treatment Follow-up is directed at
cause if appropriate:
• Anticoagulants—check INR
• Treat infection that might exacerbate a bleed
• Consider d bleeding tendency with tranexamic acid 500mg qds
•	Upper GI bleeding—stop NSAIDs, start PPI in double standard dose
and consider referral for gastroscopy
• Lower GI bleeding—consider rectal steroids to d inflammation or oral
tranexamic acid 9 referral for colonoscopy
• Radiotherapy—consider referral if haemoptysis, cutaneous bleeding, or
haematuria
• Referral for chemotherapy or palliative surgery, e.g. cautery, are also
options

Anaemia Do not check for anaemia if no intention to transfuse.
• If Hb <10g/dL and symptomatic Treat any reversible cause (e.g. iron
deficiency, GI bleeding s to NSAIDs). Consider transfusion
• If transfused Record whether any benefit is derived (as if not, further
transfusions are futile) and the duration of benefit (if <3wk—repeat
transfusions are impractical). Monitor for return of symptoms; repeat
FBC and arrange repeat transfusion as needed
Superior vena cava (SVC) obstruction Due to infiltration of

the vessel wall, clot within the superior vena cava or extrinsic pressure.
75% are due to p lung cancer (3% of patients with lung cancer have SVC
obstruction). Lymphoma and clotting associated with long central lines are
the other major causes.
Presentation
• Shortness of breath/stridor
• Headache worse on stooping 9 visual disturbances 9 dizziness and collapse

Haematological and vascular problems

• Swelling of the face—particularly around the eyes, neck, hands and
arms, and/or injected cornea
• Examination: look for non-pulsatile distension of neck veins and dilated
collateral veins (seen as small dilated veins over the anterior chest wall
below the clavicles) in which blood courses downwards
Management
• Treat breathlessness (opioids—5mg morphine sulfate solution 4-hourly
9 benzodiazepine, depending on the level of anxiety)
• Start corticosteroid (dexamethasone 16mg/d)
• Refer urgently for oncology opinion. Palliative radiotherapy has a
response rate of 70%. Stenting 9 thrombolysis is also an option

Lymphoedema Due to obstruction of lymphatic drainage, resulting in
oedema with high protein content. Affects ≥1 limbs 9 adjacent trunk. If
left untreated, lymphoedema becomes increasingly resistant to treatment
due to chronic inflammation and subcutaneous fibrosis. Cellulitis causes
rapid i in swelling. Causes:
• Axillary, groin, or intrapelvic tumour
• Axillary or groin surgery (including biopsy)
• Post-operative infection/radiotherapy
Presentation
• Swollen limb 9 pitting
• Impaired limb mobility and function
• Discomfort/pain related to tissue swelling and/or shoulder strain
• Neuralgia pain—especially when axillary nodes are involved
• Psychological distress
Management See Table 28.9
Table 28.9 Management of lymphoedema
Avoid
injury to
limb

In at-risk patients (e.g. patients who have had breast cancer
with axillary clearance) or those with lymphoedema, injury
to the limb may precipitate or worsen lymphoedema. Do not
take blood from the limb or use it for IV access or vaccination

Skin
hygiene

Skin care with moisturizers e.g. Diprobase®, Emulsiderm®
Topical treatment of fungal infection
Systemic treatment of bacterial infection

External
support

Intensive—with compression bandages
Maintenance—with lymphoedema sleeve (contact breast care
specialist nurse for more information on obtaining sleeves)

Exercise

Gentle daily exercise of affected limb gradually increasing
range of movement
0 Must wear a sleeve/bandages when doing exercises

Massage

Very gentle fingertip massage in the line of drainage of
lymphatics

Diuretics

If the condition has developed or deteriorated since
prescription of corticosteroid or NSAID or if there venous
component, consider a trial of diuretics
Otherwise diuretics are of no benefit

Cancer and palliative care

Problems with mental well-being
Anxiety All patients with terminal disease are anxious at times for a
variety of reasons, including fear of uncontrolled symptoms and of being
left alone to die. When anxiety starts interfering with quality of life, intervention is justified.
Management: non-drug measures Often all that is needed:
• Acknowledgement of the patient’s anxiety
• Full explanation of questions + written information as needed
• Support—self-help groups, day care, patient groups, specialist home
nurses (e.g. Macmillan nurses)
• Relaxation training and training in breathing control
• Physical therapies, e.g. aromatherapy, art therapy, exercise
Management: drug measures
• Acute anxiety Try lorazepam 1–2mg s/ling prn or diazepam
2–10mg prn
• Chronic anxiety Try an antidepressant, e.g. fluoxetine 20mg od.
Alternatives include regular diazepam e.g. 5–10mg od/bd, haloperidol
1–3mg bd/tds, or β-blockers, e.g. propranolol 40mg od–tds—watch
for postural hypotension
If anxiety is not responding to simple measures, seek specialist help from
either the psychiatric or palliative care team.

Depression A terminal diagnosis commonly makes patients sad.

10–20% of terminally ill patients develop clinical depression but in practice
it is often difficult to decide whether a patient is depressed or just appropriately sad about his/her diagnosis and its implications. Many symptoms
of terminal disease (e.g. poor appetite) are also symptoms of depression
so screening questionnaires for depression are often unhelpful. If in doubt,
a trial of antidepressants can help.
Assessment of suicide risk Ask about suicidal ideas and plans in a sensitive
but probing way. It is a common misconception that asking about suicide
can plant the idea into a patient’s head and make suicide more likely.
Evidence is to the contrary.
Management: non-drug measures
• Support, e.g. day and/or respite care; carers group; specialist nurse
support (e.g. Macmillan nurse; CPN); i help in the home
• Relaxation—often i the patient’s feeling of control over the situation
• Explanation—of worries/problems/concerns about the future
• Physical activity—exercise; writing
Management: drug measures
• Consider starting an antidepressant—b p. 1004
• All antidepressants take ~2wk to work
• If immediate effect is required consider using flupentixol 1mg od
(beware as can cause psychomotor agitation)
If not responding or suicidal refer for psychiatric opinion.

Problems with mental well-being

Terminal anguish and spiritual distress Characterized by overwhelming distress. Often related to unresolved conflict, guilt, fears, or
loss of control.
Anxiety can be increased if
• Patients are unaware of the diagnosis but feel people are lying to them
• They have certain symptoms, such as breathlessness, haemorrhage, or
constant nausea or diarrhoea
• Weak religious conviction—convinced believers and convinced
non-believers have less anxiety
• There are young dependant children or other dependant relatives
• Patients have unfinished business to attend to, such as legal affairs
Action Listening can itself be therapeutic. Talk to the patient, if possible,
about dying and try to break down fears into component parts. Address
fears that can be dealt with. As a last resort, and after discussion with the
patient (where possible) and/or relatives, consider sedation.

Cancer and palliative care

The last 48 hours
It is notoriously difficult to predict when death will occur. Symptoms and
signs of death approaching include:
• Day-by-day deterioration
• Difficulty swallowing medicines
• Gaunt appearance
• d intake of food and fluids
• Profound weakness—needs assistance with all care; may be bed-bound
• Drowsy or d cognition—often unable to cooperate with carers

Goals of treatment in the last 48h
• Ensure patients are comfortable—physically, emotionally, and
spiritually. Consider using the Liverpool Care Pathway (b p. 1029)
• Make the end of life peaceful and dignified—what is dignified for one
patient may not be for another; ask
• Support patients and carers so that the experience of death for those
left behind is as positive as it can be
Patients’ wishes Dying is a unique and special event for each individual. Helping to explore a patient’s wishes about death and dying should
not be a discussion left to the last 24h.
Advance directives/lasting power of attorney b pp. 122–3
Out-of-hours providers Alert out-of-hours providers if a patient is
dying at home. This will ensure appropriate response to calls and avoid
unnecessary and unwanted admissions. Consider a ‘just-in-case’ box to
leave at the patient’s home containing drugs that might be needed should
the patient deteriorate outside normal working hours.
Different cultures Different religious and cultural groups have different approaches to the dying process. Be sensitive to cultural and religious
beliefs. Never assume; if in doubt ask a family member.
Assessment of patient needs Ask which problems are causing the
patient/carers most concern and address those concerns where possible.
Patients often under-report symptoms.
Physical examination Keep examination to a minimum to avoid unnecessary interference. Check sites of discomfort/pain suggested by history or
non-verbal cues; mouth; bladder and bowel.
Psychological assessment Find out what the patient wants to know.
Gently assessing how patients feel about their disease and situation can
shed light on their needs and distress.
Investigations Any investigation at the end of life should have a clear and
justifiable purpose (e.g. excluding a reversible condition where treatment
would make the patient more comfortable). The need for investigations in
the terminal stage of illness is minimal.
Review of medication Comfort is the priority. Stop all unnecessary
medication.
Symptom control Dying patients tolerate symptoms very poorly
because of their weakness. Nursing care is the mainstay of treatment, GPs
do have a role:
• Ensure new problems do not develop, e.g. use of appropriate
mattresses and measures to prevent bed sores
• Treat specific symptoms, e.g. dry mouth

The last 48 hours

• Think ahead—discuss treatment options that might be available later,
e.g. use of a syringe driver, buccal, PR, or transcutaneous preparations
to deliver medication when/if the oral route is no longer possible; use
of strong analgesia which may also have a sedative effect
• Ensure there is a clear management plan agreed between the medical
and nursing team and the patient/family members. Anticipate probable
needs of the patient so that immediate response can be made when
the time comes—define clearly what should be done in the event of
a symptom arising/worsening; ensure drugs or equipment that may be
needed are in the home; inform the out-of-hours service
Excessive respiratory secretion (death rattle) Noisy, moist
breathing. Can be distressing for relatives. Reassure that the patient is not
suffering or choking. Try repositioning and/or tipping the bed head down
(if possible) to d noise. Treat prophylactically—it is easier to prevent than
remove accumulated secretions. Suitable drugs:
• Glycopyrronium—non-sedative; give 200 micrograms sc stat and
review after 1h. If effective, give 200 micrograms every 4h sc or
0.6–1.2mg/24h via syringe driver
• Hyoscine hydrobromide—sedative in high doses; give 400 micrograms
sc stat and review response after 30min. If effective, give 400–600
micrograms 4–8 hourly or 0.6–2.4mg/24h via syringe driver. If the patient
is conscious and respiratory secretions are not too distressing, it may be
more appropriate to use a transdermal patch (Scopoderm® 1.5mg over
3d) or sublingual tablets (Kwells®). Dry mouth is a side effect.
Terminal breathlessness Distressing symptom for patients/carers.
Support carers in attendance and explain management:
• Diamorphine or morphine: dose depends on whether the patient is being
converted from oral morphine (or an alternative opioid). If no previous
opioid, start diamorphine 5mg/24h sc. If previously on oral morphine,
divide the total 24h dose by 3 to obtain the 24h sc dose of diamorphine
or by 2 to obtain the 24h sc dose of morphine. i dose slowly as needed
• Midazolam 5–10mg/24h sc
• If sticky secretions—try nebulized saline ± physiotherapy

Terminal restlessness Causes:
• Pain/discomfort Urinary retention, constipation, pain which the
patient cannot tell you about, excess secretions in throat
• Opioid toxicity Causes myoclonic jerking. The dose of morphine may
need to be d if a patient becomes uraemic
• Biochemical causes—i Ca2+, uraemia—0 if it has been decided not
to treat abnormalities do not check for them
• Psychological/spiritual distress.
Management Treat reversible causes, e.g. catheterization for retention,
hyoscine to dry up secretions. If still restless, treat with a sedative. This
does not shorten life but makes the patient/relatives more comfortable.
Suitable drugs: haloperidol 1–3mg tds po; chlorpromazine 25–50mg tds po;
diazepam 2–10mg tds po, midazolam (10–100mg/24h via syringe driver or 5mg
stat), or levomepromazine (50–150mg/24h via syringe driver or 6.25mg stat).

Syringe drivers
Syringe drivers are used to aid drug delivery when the oral route is no
longer feasible. Indications include:
• Intractable vomiting
• Severe dysphagia
• Patient too weak to swallow
• d conscious level
• Poor gut absorption (rare)
• Poor patient compliance
Types of syringe driver In recent years, many PCOs, hospitals, and
hospices have been changing their syringe drivers from the traditionally
used blue or green Graseby drivers, which are being phased out. Newer
devices with additional safety and monitoring features (e.g. McKinley
T34 or Alaris) are now in common use. It is important to find out which
devices are used in your locality and how they work.
• Incorrect use of syringe drivers is a common cause of drug errors.
Each PCO should use just one type of syringe driver to d risks of errors.

Drugs that can be used in syringe drivers See Table 28.10.
General principles Draw up the prescribed 24h medication. The diluent
of choice in most cases is water for injection but 0.9% sodium chloride
should be used if using levomepromazine, diclofenac, octreotide or ondansetron; cyclizine should not be diluted with saline. Then set the rate on
the syringe driver.
0 Local policies may differ. Hands-on training is essential.
Mixing drugs in syringe drivers Provided there is evidence of compatibility, drugs can be mixed in syringe drivers. Diamorphine or morphine
can be mixed with:
• Cyclizine
• Dexamethasone (<4mg/24h)
• Hyoscine hydrobromide
• Levomepromazine
• Hyoscine butylbromide
• Haloperidol
• Midazolam
• Metoclopramide
• Ondansetron
• Glycopyrronium
If combining 2 or 3 drugs in a syringe driver, a larger volume of diluent may
be needed (e.g. 20 or 30mL syringe). If >3 drugs are needed in 1 syringe
driver, reassess treatment aims.
Common problems with syringe drivers
• If the syringe driver runs too slowly Check it is switched on; check
the battery; check the cannula is not blocked
• If the syringe driver runs too quickly Check the rate setting
• Injection site reaction If there is pain or inflammation, change the
injection site

Emergencies in general practice

Emergency patient encounters
Emergency calls Nearly all requests for emergency care are made by
telephone. General rules:
• Train surgery staff to handle distressed callers, recognize serious
problems, and act appropriately when such calls are received
• Where possible use a single number for patients to access help If
using an answering machine, ensure the message is easily heard and
contains clear instructions. Worried patients find it difficult to cope
with complicated telephone referral systems or messages
• Appear helpful rather than defensive from the outset. Keep calm and
friendly—even in the event of provocation. Worried callers often
appear abrupt or demanding
• Record the time of the call, date, patient’s name, address and a
contact telephone number, brief details of the problem, and action
taken (even if calls are being recorded)
• Collect only information you need to decide what action is
necessary If the patient needs to be seen, collect enough information
to decide where and how quickly the patient should be seen, and
whether extra equipment or help is needed
• If giving advice make it simple and in language the patient can
understand. Repeat to make sure it has been understood. Consider
asking the patient/carer to repeat what you have told them. Always tell
callers to ring back if symptoms change or they have further worries
• If a visit is indicated ensure the address is right and ask for directions
if you are not sure where to go. Try to give a rough arrival time
• In some cases (e.g. major trauma, large GI bleeds, suspected MI,
burns, overdoses) call for an emergency ambulance at once
• If a call seems inappropriate consider the reason for it—e.g.
depression might provoke recurrent calls for minor ailments
• If in doubt—see the patient.

Emergency home visits
• Try to stick to the problem you have been called about
• Take a concise history and examine as appropriate
• Make a decision on management and explain it to the patient and any
carers in clear and concise terms that they can understand. Repeat
advice several times ± write it down
• Record history, examination, management suggested, and advice given
for the patient’s notes
• Always invite the patient and carers to ring you again should symptoms
change, the situation deteriorate, or further worries appear
• For inappropriate calls, take time to educate the patient and/or carers
about self-management and use of emergency GP visiting services
• Always consider hidden reasons for seemingly unnecessary visits

Being prepared
• Ensure that you have a reliable car with a full tank of fuel
• Have a good street map of the area ± Ordinance Survey map ± an
electronic in-car navigation system

Emergency patient encounters

•
•
•
•
•
•

Carry a large, strong torch in the car
Carry a mobile telephone to enable you to call for help as needed
Check your drug box is fully stocked and all items are in date
Check all equipment carried is operational, and carry spare batteries
Carry a list of emergency telephone numbers
Know which chemists have extended opening hours and/or carry the
chemist’s rota

Safety and security
• In all cases ensure someone else knows where you are going, when
to expect you back, and what to do if you do not return on time
• If going to a call you are worried about either take someone with
you to sit in the car or call the police to meet you there before
going in
• If you reach a call and find you are uncomfortable, make sure you
can get out. Note the layout of the property and make sure you
have a clear route to the door
• Set up your mobile phone to call the police or your base at a single
touch of a button. Consider carrying an attack alarm
• If possible have separate bags for drugs and consultation equipment;
leave the drug box locked out of sight in the boot of the car when
doing a visit

Referral letters Good communication is essential when referring
patients to other doctors and agencies, especially in emergency situations.
Ensure all referral letters include:
• Address of the referrer (including telephone number if possible)
• Name and address of registered GP if not the referrer
• Date of referral
• Name, address, and date of birth of the patient (and any other
identifiers available, e.g. hospital or NHS number)
• Name of the person to whom the patient is being referred (or
department if not a named individual)
• Presenting condition—history, examination, investigations already
performed with results, treatments already tried with outcomes
• Relevant past medical history and family history
• Current medication and any intolerances/allergies known
• Reason for referral (what you want the recipient of the letter to do)
e.g. to investigate symptoms, to reassure parents
• Any other relevant information, e.g. social circumstances
• Signature (and name in legible format) of referrer
0 Consider using carbonized paper to keep copies of emergency referral letters.

Emergencies in general practice

Managing a resuscitation attempt
outside hospital
• Ventricular fibrillation complicating acute MI is the most common

cause of cardiac arrest that members of the primary healthcare team
will encounter. Success is greatest when the event is witnessed and
attempted defibrillation is performed with the minimum of delay.

Resuscitation equipment See Table 29.1.
• Resuscitation equipment is used relatively infrequently. Staff must know
where to find equipment at the time it is needed and should be trained to
use the equipment to a level appropriate to the individual’s expected role
• Each practice should have a named individual with responsibility for
checking the state of readiness of all resuscitation drugs and equipment
on a regular basis, ideally once a week. In common with drugs,
disposable items like the adhesive electrodes have a finite shelf life and
will require replacement from time to time if unused
Training Training and practice are necessary to acquire skills in resuscita­
tion techniques. Resuscitation skills decline rapidly and updates and retrain­
ing using manikins are necessary every 6–12mo to maintain adequate skill
levels. Level of resuscitation skill needed by different members of the
primary healthcare team differs according to the individual’s role:
• All those in direct contact with patients should be trained in basic life
support and related resuscitation skills such as the recovery position
• Doctors, nurses, and other paramedical workers such as
physiotherapists should also be able to use an automatic external
defibrillator (AED) effectively. Other personnel (e.g. receptionists)
may also be trained to use an AED
• It is unacceptable for patients who sustain a cardiopulmonary arrest

to await the arrival of the ambulance service before basic resuscitation
is performed and a defibrillator is available.

Performance management Accurate records of all resuscitation
attempts and electronic data stored by most AEDs during a resuscitation
attempt should be kept for audit, training, and medicolegal reasons. The
responsibility for this rests with the most senior member of the practice
team involved. Process and outcome of all resuscitation attempts should
be audited—both at practice and PCO level—to allow deficiencies to be
addressed and examples of good practice to be shared.
Ethical issues
• It is essential to identify individuals in whom cardiopulmonary arrest is
a terminal event and where resuscitation is inappropriate
• Overall responsibility for a ‘Do not attempt to resuscitate (DNAR)’
decision rests with the clinician in charge of the patient’s care
• Seek opinions of other members of the medical and nursing team, the
patient, and any relatives in reaching a DNAR decision

Managing a resuscitation attempt outside hospital

• Record the DNAR decision in the patient notes, the reasons for that
decision, and what the relatives have been told; provide a copy of the
DNAR form for the patient/carers to keep in the home
• Ensure that all members of the team involved with the patient’s care
are aware of the decision and have it recorded in their notes too.
0 Remember to send a notification to the local ambulance service
and OOH provider
• Review the decision not to attempt resuscitation regularly in the light
of the patient’s condition

An automated external defibrillator should be available
wherever and whenever sick patients are seen
Regular maintenance is needed even if the machine is not used
After the machine is used the manufacturer’s instructions should be
followed to return it to a state of readiness with minimum delay

Pocket mask with All personnel should be trained to use one
one-way valve
Oro-pharyngeal
airway

Suitable for use by those appropriately trained. Keep a
range of sizes available

Oxygen and
mask with

Should be available wherever possible.Oxygen cylinders need
regular maintenance-follow national safety standards

Suction

Simple, mechanical, portable, handheld suction devices are
recommended

Drugs

Epinephrine/adrenaline—1mg IV.
Amiodarone—300mg IV—for VF resistant to defibrillation
Naloxone—for suspected cases of respiratory arrest due
to opioid overdose

• There is no evidence for the use of alkalizing agents,
atropine, buffers, or calcium salts before hospitalization

Drugs should be given by the intravenous route, preferably
through a catheter placed in a large vein, for example in the
antecubital fossa, and flushed in with a bolus of IV fluid
If IV access cannot be obtained, give drugs via the intraosseous
route (IO). In a child, if IV/IO access is not available and cannot
easily be obtained, but a tracheal tube is in place, consider
giving adrenaline (100 microgram/kg) via the tracheal tube

Emergencies in general practice

Adult basic life support
Basic paediatric life support b p. 1060
Adult basic adult life support (ABLS) Is a holding operation—
sustaining life until help arrives. BLS should be started as soon as the arrest
is detected—outcome is less good the longer the delay (see Figure 29.1).
1. Danger Ensure safety of rescuer and patient
2. Response Check the patient for any response
• Is he Alert? Yes/No
• Does he respond to Vocal stimuli? Yes/No
• Does he respond to a Painful stimulus (pinching the lower part of the
nasal septum)? Yes/No
• Is the patient Unconscious? Yes/No
If he responds by answering or moving Do not move the patient unless in
danger. Get help. Reassess regularly.
If he does not respond Shout for help; turn the patient onto his back.
3. Airway Open the airway—place one hand on the patient’s forehead
and tilt his head back. With fingertips under the point of the patient’s
chin, lift the chin to open the airway.

• Try to avoid head tilt if trauma to the neck is suspected
4. Breathing With airway open, look, listen, and feel for breathing for no
more than 10s—look for chest movement, listen at the victim’s mouth
for breath sounds, feel for air on your cheek.
If breathing normally Turn the patient into the recovery position
(b p. 1071), get help, and check for continued breathing.
If not breathing or only making occasional gasps/weak attempts at
breathing: get help then start chest compressions.
0 In the first few minutes after cardiac arrest, a victim may be barely
breathing or taking infrequent, noisy, gasps. Do not confuse this with normal breathing. If you have any doubt whether breathing is normal, act as
if it is not normal.
5. Circulation Start chest compressions if not breathing:
• Kneel by the side of the victim and place the heel of one hand in the
centre of the victim’s chest. Place the heel of your other hand on top
of the first hand. Interlock the fingers of your hands and ensure that
pressure is not applied over the victim’s ribs. Do not apply any pressure
over the upper abdomen or the bottom end of the bony sternum
• Position yourself vertically above the victim’s chest and, with arms
straight, press down on the sternum 5–6cm
• After each compression, release all the pressure on the chest without
losing contact between your hands and the sternum. Compression and
release should take an equal amount of time
• Repeat at a rate of 7100–120x/min

6. Combine chest compression with rescue breaths
• After 30 compressions open the airway using head tilt and chin lift
• Pinch the soft part of the victim’s nose closed, using the index finger
and thumb of your hand on his forehead. Allow the victim’s mouth to
open, but maintain chin lift
• Give a rescue breath—take a normal breath and place your lips
around the victim’s mouth (mouth-to-nose technique is an alternative)
making sure that you have a good seal. Blow steadily into his mouth
for 71s whilst watching for the chest to rise
• Maintaining head tilt and chin lift; take your mouth away from the
victim and watch for the chest to fall as air comes out
• Take another normal breath and blow into the victim’s mouth again
to give a total of 2 effective rescue breaths. Then return your hands
without delay to the correct position on the sternum and give a
further 30 chest compressions
• Continue chest compressions and rescue breaths in a ratio of 30:2
If rescue breaths do not make the chest rise
• Check the victim’s mouth, and remove any visible obstruction
• Recheck that there is adequate head tilt and chin lift
• Don’t attempt >2 breaths each time before returning to chest compressions
0 Chest-compression-only CPR If you are unable or unwilling to give rescue
breaths, give continuous chest compressions only at a rate of 100–120/min.

• Only stop to recheck the victim if the patient shows signs of regaining

consciousness (e.g. coughs, opens eyes, moves purposefully) AND starts
to breath normally; otherwise resuscitation should not be interrupted.

Use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in adults

Programme AEDs to deliver a single shock followed by a pause of 2min for
the immediate resumption of CPR.

If a patient arrests Unless an AED is immediately available, start CPR
according to the guidelines for basic life support.
As soon as the AED arrives. See Figure 29.2.
• Switch on the AED and attach the electrode pads. If >1 rescuer is
present, continue CPR whilst this is done. (Some AEDs automatically
switch on when the AED lid is opened)
• Place one AED pad to the right of the sternum below the clavicle
• Place the other pad in the mid-axillary line with its long axis vertical
• Follow the voice/visual prompts. Ensure nobody touches the victim
whilst the AED is analysing the rhythm
If a shock is indicated Ensure that nobody touches the victim. Push the shock
button as directed (fully automatic AEDs deliver the shock automatically).
Immediately resume CPR and continue to follow the prompts.
If no shock is indicated Immediately resume CPR and continue to follow
the prompts.
Use of AEDs in children b p. 1062

Adult basic life support

When to go for assistance It is vital for rescuers to get assistance
as quickly as possible. If you are the only rescuer, go for assistance
before starting CPR.
When >1 rescuer is available
• One should start resuscitation while another rescuer goes for
assistance
• Another should take over CPR every 2min to prevent fatigue. Ensure
minimum of delay during changeover of rescuers

Duration of resuscitation Continue resuscitation until:
• Further qualified help arrives from the emergency medical services
• The victim starts breathing normally, and/or
•	You become exhausted
Pad position for external defibrillators Place 1 pad to the
right of the sternum below the clavicle. Place the other pad vertically
in the mid-axillary line approximately level with the V6 ECG electrode
position or female breast (although clear of any breast tissue).
Advising about CPR over the telephone If you receive a phone

call for advice about an adult who has collapsed and is not breathing, call
for emergency ambulance support. Advise the person with the patient
to perform compression-only CPR. This is easier to describe, more
acceptable to the general public, and more effective than traditional
compression/ventilation CPR. 0 Children need compressions and
ventilation.

Management after successful treatment of cardiac arrest
• Turn into the recovery position (b p. 1071)
• Give oxygen aiming to keep oxygen saturation at 94–98%
• Transfer to hospital as soon as possible by emergency ambulance

Emergencies in general practice

Adult advanced life support
See Figure 29.3. Advanced life support has 3 basic stages:
• Revive the patient using basic life support (b p. 1054). Basic
life support should be started if there is any delay in obtaining a
defibrillator but must not delay shock delivery
• Restore spontaneous cardiac output, using an automated external
defibrillator (b p. 1056) or manual defibrillator
• Review possible causes for cardiac arrest and take action as needed
Precordial thump Appropriate only if the arrest is witnessed and a
defibrillator is not to hand—may dislodge a pulmonary embolus or ‘jerk’
the heart back into sinus rhythm. Use the ulnar edge of a tightly clenched
fist, and deliver a sharp impact to the lower half of the sternum from a
height of 720cm then immediately retract the fist.

VF/VT arrest
• Attempt defibrillation (1 shock 150–200J biphasic or 360J monophasic)
• Immediately resume chest compressions (30:2) without reassessing
rhythm or feeling for the pulse. Continue CPR for 2min then pause
briefly to check the monitor
• If VT/VF persists give a 2nd shock (150–360J biphasic or 360J monophasic);
continue CPR for 2min then pause briefly to check the monitor
• If VT/VF persists give a 3rd shock (150–360J biphasic or 360J
monophasic), then continue CPR for 2min
• After the 3rd shock (and whilst continuing CPR) administer adrenaline
(epinephrine) 1mg IV and amiodarone 300mg IV (lidocaine 1mg/kg is
an alternative if amiodarone is not available). Give drugs IO if IV access
cannot be obtained
• Repeat 2min CPR, rhythm check, defibrillation sequence while VT/VF
persists
• Give adrenaline (epinephrine) 1mg IV immediately before alternate
shocks (i.e. approximately every 3–5min)

Non-VT/VF arrest
• Start CPR 30:2. Without stopping CPR, check that the leads are
attached correctly
• Give adrenaline (epinephrine) 1mg IV as soon as IV access is achieved
• Continue CPR 30:2 until the airway is secured, then continue chest
compression without pausing during ventilation
• Recheck the rhythm after 2min and proceed accordingly—if VT/VF
change to VF/VT arrest (shockable rhythm) algorithm
• Give adrenaline (epinephrine) 1mg IV every 3–5min (alternate loops)
Fine VF Fine VF difficult to distinguish from asystole is very unlikely to
be shocked successfully into a perfusing rhythm. Continuing good-quality
CPR may improve the amplitude and frequency of the VF and improve the
chance of successful defibrillation to a perfusing rhythm.
Organized electrical activity If organized electrical activity is seen
during the brief pause in compressions, check for a pulse.
• If a pulse is present, start post-resuscitation care (b p. 1057)
• If no pulse, continue CPR and follow the non-shockable algorithm

Emergencies in general practice

Paediatric basic life support
Basic paediatric life support (see Figure 29.4) is a holding operation until
help arrives.
1. Danger Ensure safety of rescuer and patient
2. Response Check the child for any response
• Is he Alert?
• Does he respond to Vocal stimuli?
• Does he respond to Painful stimuli (pinch lower part of nasal septum)?
• Is he Unconscious?
If he responds by answering or moving Do not move the child unless in
danger. Get help. Reassess regularly.
If he does not respond Shout for help. Assess airway.
3. Airway Open the airway. Do not move the child from the position in
which you found him unless you have to:
• Gently tilt the head back—with your hand on the child’s forehead
• Lift the chin—with your fingertips under the point of the child’s chin
If unsuccessful
• Try jaw thrust—place the first 2 fingers of each hand behind each side
of the child’s jaw bone, and push the jaw forward
• Try lifting the chin or jaw thrust after carefully turning the child onto
his back

• Avoid head tilt as much as possible if trauma to the neck is suspected
4. Breathing Look, listen, and feel for breathing (maximum 10s)
If breathing normally Turn the child carefully into the recovery position
(b p. 1071) if unconscious, and check for continued breathing.
If not breathing or not breathing normally:
• Carefully turn the child onto his back and remove any obvious airway
obstruction
• Give 5 initial rescue breaths—note any gag or cough response
Technique for rescue breaths
• Ensure head tilt (neutral position for children <1y) and chin lift
• If age ≥1y, pinch the soft part of the child’s nose closed with the index
finger and thumb of the hand which is on his forehead. Open the
child’s mouth a little, but maintain the chin upwards
• Take a breath and place your lips around the child’s mouth (mouth
and nose if <1y*), ensuring you have a good seal. Blow steadily into the
child’s airway over 71–1.5s, watching for the chest to rise
• Maintaining head tilt and chin lift, take your mouth away and watch for
the chest to fall as air comes out
• Take another breath and repeat this sequence 5 times
0 If you have difficulty achieving an effective breath, consider airway
obstruction—b p. 1086.
*
If the nose and mouth cannot both be covered, place your lips around the mouth alone as for an
older child, or nose alone (close the child’s lips to prevent air escape).

Emergencies in general practice

5. Circulation (signs of life) Check (maximum 10s) for:
• Any movement, coughing, or normal breathing (not agonal gasps)
• Pulse—child ≥1y carotid pulse; child <1y brachial pulse
If circulation is present Continue rescue breathing until the child starts
breathing effectively on his own. Turn the child into the recovery position
(b p. 1071) if unconscious, and reassess frequently.
If circulation is absent Or slow pulse (<60bpm) with poor perfusion or
you are not sure:
• Give 15 chest compressions. Then give 2 rescue breaths, followed by
15 further chest compressions
• Continue the cycle of 2 breaths followed by 15 chest compressions
0 Lone rescuers may use a ratio of 30 compressions:2 rescue breaths.
Technique for chest compressions Compress the sternum 1 finger’s
breadth above the xiphisternum by at least a third of the depth of the chest.
Release the pressure then repeat at a rate of 7100–120 compressions/min.
• Children <1y with a lone rescuer Use the tips of 2 fingers
• Children <1y with ≥2 rescuers Place both thumbs flat on the lower
third of the sternum with tips pointing towards the child’s head and
encircle the lower part of the child’s ribcage with the tips of the fingers
supporting the infant’s back. Press down with both thumbs
• Children >1y Place the heel of 1 hand over the lower half of the
sternum. Lift the fingers. Position yourself vertically above the chest
with arm straight, and push downwards. For larger children use both
hands with fingers interlocked to achieve satisfactory compressions

• Stop to recheck for signs of a circulation only if the child moves or
takes a spontaneous breath—otherwise continue uninterrupted.

Use of automated external defibrillators (AEDs) in children

• Children >8y Use the standard adult AED (see Figure 29.5)
• Children <8y Paediatric pads or a paediatric mode should be used if
available—if not, use the adult AED as it is. 0 Shockable rhythm is
rare in children <1y, but if present benefits of AED use outweigh risks
If a patient arrests Start CPR according to the guidelines for PBLS.
As soon as the AED arrives follow Figure 29.5
• Switch on the AED and attach the electrode pads. If >1 rescuer is
present, continue CPR whilst this is done. (Some AEDs automatically
switch on when the AED lid is opened)
• Place one AED pad to the right of the sternum below the clavicle.
• Place the other pad in the mid-axillary line with its long axis vertical
• Follow the voice/visual prompts. Ensure nobody touches the victim
whilst the AED is analysing the rhythm
If a shock is indicated Ensure nobody touches the victim. Push the shock
button as directed (fully automatic AEDs deliver the shock automatically).
Immediately resume CPR and continue to follow the prompts.

Paediatric basic life support

If no shock is indicated Immediately resume CPR and continue to follow
the prompts.

When to go for assistance It is vital for rescuers to get assistance
as quickly as possible when a child collapses.
When >1 rescuer is available One should start resuscitation while
another rescuer goes for assistance.
Lone rescuer Perform resuscitation for 1 minute before going for
assistance (and consider taking a young child/infant with you to minimize
interruption in CPR). The only exception to this is a witnessed sudden
collapse—as in this case cardiac arrest is likely to be due to arrhythmia
and the child may need defibrillation so seek help immediately

Duration of resuscitation Continue resuscitation until:
• Child shows signs of life (spontaneous respiration, pulse, movement)
• Further qualified help arrives from emergency medical services
•	You become exhausted
Cervical spine injury

• If spinal cord injury is suspected (e.g. if the victim has sustained a
fall, been struck on the head or neck, or has been rescued after
diving into shallow water) take particular care during handling and
resuscitation to maintain alignment of the head, neck, and chest in
the neutral position
• A spinal board and/or cervical collar should be used if available

call for advice about a child who has collapsed and is not breathing, call
for emergency ambulance support. Advise the person with the patient
to perform compression and ventilation CPR. 0 For adults advise
compression-only CPR.

Management after successful treatment of cardiac arrest

• Turn into the recovery position (b p. 1071)
• Give oxygen, aiming to keep oxygen saturation at 94–98%
• Transfer to hospital as soon as possible by emergency ambulance

Emergencies in general practice

Paediatric advanced life support
See Figure 29.6. Cardiac arrest in children is rare. Except where there is
underlying heart disease, it is usually a consequence of respiratory arrest
which results in asystole or pulseless electrical activity and has poor prognosis. Good airway management and providing high-flow oxygen for very
sick children is therefore important in preventing cardiac arrest.
Basic paediatric life support Follow the algorithm in Figure 29.4.
Unable to ventilate? Consider foreign body in the airway and initiate
airway obstruction sequence—b p. 1086

Checking the pulse
• Child Feel the carotid pulse in the neck
• Infant Feel the brachial pulse on the inner aspect of the upper arm
Once the airway is protected By tracheal intubation, continue chest
compression without pausing for ventilation. Provide ventilation at a rate of
10–12/min and compression at 100–120/min. When circulation is restored,
ventilate the child at a rate of 12–20 breaths/min.

Adrenaline (epinephrine) dose
• IV or intraosseous (IO) access—10 micrograms/kg adrenaline (0.1mL/kg
of 1:10,000 solution). Give as soon as possible if non-shockable rhythm
• If circulatory access is not present and cannot be quickly obtained, but
the child has a tracheal tube in place, consider giving adrenaline
100 micrograms/kg via the tracheal tube (1mL/kg of 1:10,000 or 0.1mL/kg
of 1:1,000 solution). This is the least satisfactory route of administration

• Do not give 1:1,000 adrenaline IV or IO.
VF/pulseless VT Less common in paediatric life support.

• Defibrillation:
• Give 1 shock of 4J/kg, or
• If using an AED for a child of <8y, deliver a paediatric attenuated
adult shock energy
• If using an AED for a child >8y, use the adult shock energy
• For VF/pulseless VT persisting after the 3rd shock, resume chest comp­
ressions and give adrenaline 10 micrograms/kg and amiodarone 5mg/kg
• Continue 2min cycles of CPR and shocks. Give adrenaline in alternate
cycles and amiodarone one further time after the fifth shock
Magnesium Magnesium treatment is indicated in children with
documented hypomagnesaemia or with polymorphic VT (‘torsade de
pointes’), regardless of cause. Give IV magnesium sulfate over several
minutes at a dose of 25–50mg/kg (to a maximum of 2g).
Intravenous fluids In situations where the cardiac arrest has resulted
from circulatory failure, a standard (20mL/kg) bolus of crystalloid fluid
should be given if there is no response to the initial dose of adrenaline.

Resuscitation of the newborn
Follow the algorithm in Figure 29.7.

Rapid assessment of the infant at birth Start the clock. Assess
colour, tone, breathing, heart rate.
A healthy baby
• Born blue
• Good heart rate (120–150bpm)
• Good tone
• Rapidly becomes pink during the first 90s
• Cries seconds after delivery
An ill baby
• Slow/very slow heart rate (<100bpm)
• Born pale
• Poor tone/floppy • Not breathing/inadequate breathing by 90–120s
Clamping the cord 1min after delivery for newborns not requiring
resuscitation. If resuscitation is needed, delay until the baby is breathing.
Heart rate and pulse oximetry Heart rate is best judged by listening
with a stethoscope—in many cases it can also be felt by palpating the
umbilical cord. If available and the infant needs resuscitation, use pulse
oximetry to measure pre-ductal oxygen saturation and heart rate. Place
sensor on the right hand/wrist. In healthy term babies, oxygen saturation i
from 60% soon after birth to 90% at 10min.
Airway Open the airway by placing the head in a neutral position (neck
neither extended nor flexed). If the occiput is prominent and the neck tends to
flex, place a support under the shoulders—but do not overextend the neck. If
the baby is floppy, apply jaw thrust or chin lift as needed.
Breathing Inflation breaths are breaths with pressures of 730cm of
water for 2–3s. Use air rather than oxygen.
If heart rate i You have successfully inflated the chest. If the baby does
not start breathing alone, continue to provide regular breaths at a rate of
730–40 breaths/min until the baby starts to breathe alone.
If heart rate does not i Either you have not inflated the chest or the baby
needs more help. If the chest does not move, consider:
• Is the baby’s head in the neutral position? Do you need jaw thrust?
• Do you need a longer inflation time?
• Do you need a second person’s help with the airway?
• Is there obstruction, e.g. meconium (laryngoscope and suction)?
• What about an oropharyngeal (Guedel) airway?
Chest compressions Only commence after inflation of the lungs.
• Grip the chest in both hands so that the thumbs of both hands can
press on the sternum at a point just below an imaginary line joining the
nipples and with the fingers over the spine at the back
• Compress the chest quickly—d the AP diameter of the chest by at least
a third with each compression. Ratio of compressions to inflations is 3:1
Drug support For a few babies inflation of the lungs and effective chest
compression are not sufficient to produce effective circulation. IV or intraosseous drugs may be helpful.

Emergencies in general practice

Coma
Patients in coma/pre-coma nearly always require emergency admission.

When you receive the call for assistance
• Advise the attendant (unless history of possible spinal injury) to turn
the patient onto his/her side
• Call an ambulance to meet you at the scene

On reaching the patient
• Assess the need for basic life support:
• Airway patent?
• Breathing satisfactory?
• Circulation adequate?
• Turn into the recovery position (b p. 1071) if no contraindications,
e.g. spinal injury
• Call for ambulance support if you have not already done so
• Ensure the patient is warm
• Try to establish a diagnosis (see Figure 29.8)

As soon as possible
•
•
•
•

Insert an airway
Give oxygen
Establish IV access
Transfer to hospital—unless the condition has resolved, e.g.
hypoglycaemia, fit

Possible causes
• Drugs Sedatives or hypnotics, opioids, alcohol, solvents, carbon
monoxide poisoning
• Vascular Stroke, low cardiac output, e.g. post-MI, ruptured AAA
• CNS Fit or post-ictal state; hydrocephalus (e.g. blocked shunt);
cerebral oedema (e.g. meningitis, SAH, head injury); concussion;
extradural or subdural haematoma
• Metabolic Hypo- or hyperglycaemia; hypothermia; hypopituitarism

recovery position to keep the airway clear if unconscious but has circulation
and is breathing (b p.1071)
B Breathing—is the patient breathing? What is the respiratory rate? What is
the oxygen saturation (if pulse oximeter available)? Consider giving oxygen
(if peripheral oxygen saturation is ≤94%)
C Circulation—BP and pulse rate; haemorrhage control if bleeding
D Disability—level of consciousness (e.g. Glasgow Coma Scale)
E Exposure—look for clues to underlying cause e.g. signs of injury, smell of
alcohol, rashes, pinpoint pupils/needle marks on limbs, temperature

Ask any attendants about
• Onset of symptoms /collapse
• Previous medical history
• Current medication
• Injury
• Social circumstances
Look for clues at the scene
e.g. suicide notes, repeat prescription

Figure 29.9 The recovery position. When a patient is unconscious but
has circulation and is breathing, it is important to:
• Maintain a good airway
• Ensure the tongue does not cause obstruction
• Minimize the risk of inhalation of gastric contents
For this reason the victim should be placed in the recovery position. This
allows the tongue to fall forward, keeping the airway clear.
Putting a patient into the recovery
A
position
• Remove the patient’s glasses
• Kneel beside the patient and make
sure that both legs are straight (A)
• Place the arm nearest to you out at
right angles to the body, elbow bent
B
with the hand palm uppermost (A)
• Bring the far arm across the chest,
and hold the back of the hand against
the patient’s cheek nearest to you (B)
• With your other hand, grasp the far
leg just above the knee and pull it up,
keeping the foot on the ground (B) C
• Keeping the patient’s hand pressed
against his cheek, pull on the leg to
roll the patient towards you onto his
side (C)
• Adjust the upper leg so that both
the hip and knee are bent at right
D
angles (D)
• Tilt the head back to make sure the
airway remains open (D)
• Adjust the hand under the cheek, if
necessary, to keep the head tilted
• Check breathing regularly

• Monitor the peripheral circulation of the lower arm. If the patient has
to be kept in the recovery position for >30min, turn the patient onto
the opposite side.

The unconscious child The child should be in as near a true lateral

position as possible with his mouth dependent to allow free drainage of
fluid. The position should be stable. In an infant this may require the support of a small pillow or rolled-up blanket placed behind the infant’s back
to maintain the position.
Cervical spine injury If spinal cord injury is suspected (for example,
if the victim has sustained a fall, been struck on the head or neck, or has
been rescued after diving into shallow water) take particular care during
handling and resuscitation to maintain alignment of the head, neck, and
chest in the neutral position. A spinal board and/or cervical collar should
be used if available.

Anaphylaxis
Severe systemic allergic reaction that is life-threatening. Common causes:
• Foods Nuts, milk, fruit, fish and shellfish, eggs, pulses (beans, peas)
• Drugs Antibiotics, aspirin and other NSAIDs, opioids
• Insect stings Wasp or bee
•	 Latex
Features Often history of anaphylaxis/severe allergic reaction.
Anaphylaxis is likely when all of the following are met:
• Sudden onset/rapid progression Of symptoms over minutes
• Life-threatening:
• Airway problems—difficulty breathing/swallowing; feeling that
throat is closing; hoarseness; stridor, and/or
• Breathing problems—i respiratory rate; wheeze; shortness of
breath; oxygen saturation <92%; cyanosis (late sign); confusion due
to anoxia; respiratory arrest, and/or
• Circulation problems—shock (pallor, clammy, tachycardia—
bradycardia is a late feature); d BP; faintness/dizziness; collapse;
agitation/confusion; loss of consciousness. May cause myocardial
ischaemia and ECG changes even if normal coronary arteries
• Skin and/or mucosal changes Flushing, erythema, urticaria, and/
or angioedema, rhinitis and/or conjunctivitis—subtle/absent in 1 in 5
0 Skin or mucosal changes alone are not a sign of an anaphylactic
reaction, although they may develop into one.
Other symptoms Abdominal symptoms, e.g. abdominal pain, vomiting or
incontinence; anxiety ± sense of impending doom.

Differential diagnosis
• Life-threatening Severe asthma; septic shock
• Non-life-threatening Simple faint; hyperventilation/panic attack;
breath-holding attacks in small children; lone urticaria/angio-oedema

Action If suspected when the initial call comes in, request an emergency ambulance immediately. Ask if the patient has had a similar event
before. If so, does he/she have an adrenaline auto-injector device? If yes,
advise immediate use. Then visit—on attendance, follow the algorithm in
Figure 29.10. Patients with airway/breathing problems may prefer to sit up;
if low blood pressure, lie flat (on left side if pregnant) with legs elevated;
if unconscious and breathing, place in the recovery position (b p. 1071).
Follow-up Warn patients or parents of the possibility of recurrence. Advise
sufferers to wear a device (e.g. Medic-Alert bracelet) that will inform bystanders or medical staff should a future attack occur. Refer all patients after their
first anaphylactic attack to a specialist allergy clinic. Consider supplying sufferers (or parents) with an adrenaline auto-injector device (e.g. EpiPen®) which
can be used to administer IM adrenaline (epinephrine) immediately should
symptoms recur. If you supply an auto-injector device, teach anyone likely to
need to use it how to operate the device. IM adrenaline is very safe.

Shock
Shock is due to inadequate blood flow to the peripheral circulation. It
results in d BP (± tachycardia), peripheral cyanosis, and d urinary output.
Anaphylactic shock b p. 1072
Septic shock b p. 1078
Cardiogenic shock (e.g. due to MI, arrhythmia, tamponade). Signs:
• Hypotension—systolic BP <80–90mmHg
• Pulse rate may be normal, i, or d
• Severe breathlessness ± cyanosis
Action
• Sit the patient up if possible. Call for ambulance assistance
• Gain IV access. Treat underlying cause, e.g. atropine for bradycardia;
diamorphine, furosemide, and GTN spray (if tolerated) for acute LVF
• If available give 100% oxygen—unless COPD when 24%

Hypovolaemic shock Usually due to haemorrhage. Signs:
• Initially Tachycardia (pulse >100bpm), pallor, sweating ± restlessness
• Later Decompensation—sudden fall in pulse rate and BP. Young
people may decompensate very rapidly—if tachycardic treat as a
medical emergency—speed could be lifesaving
Gastrointestinal bleeding b p. 1076
Lacerations b p. 1074
Very heavy menstrual bleeding b p. 709
Ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) In the community, death rate
from ruptured AAA is ~90% (80% before reaching hospital and 10% during
surgery). Consider ruptured AAA in any patient with d BP and atypical
abdominal symptoms (especially if pulsatile abdominal mass).
• In a patient with a known AAA, abdominal pain represents a ruptured AAA unless proven otherwise.

Dissecting thoracic aneurysm
• Typically presents with sudden tearing chest pain radiating to the back
• Consider if d BP and chest pain (especially if pain radiates to the back)
• As dissection progresses, branches of the aorta are sequentially occluded
causing: hemiplegia (carotid artery); unequal pulses and BP in the 2 arms
(subclavian artery); paraplegia (spinal arteries); acute renal failure (renal
arteries); aortic incompetence (proximal extension) and MI (cardiac arteries)
Action for ruptured AAA or dissecting thoracic aneurysm
• Lie the patient down flat, and raise legs above waist height
• Call for emergency ambulance assistance
• Gain IV access and (if possible) take blood for FBC and
cross-matching—try to insert 2 large-bore cannulae
• If available, start IV fluids. Give rapidly over 10–15min
• If available, give 100% oxygen—unless COPD when give 24%
Nosebleed/epistaxis Usually due to ruptured blood vessels on the nasal
septum. Causes:

Shock

• Young Nose picking, coryza, allergic rhinitis, blood dyscrasias
• Elderly Degenerative arterial disease, i BP, nose picking, coryza,
allergic rhinitis, medication (anticoagulants or aspirin), blood dyscrasias,
telangiectasia, tumour. Often no cause is found
Manage as in Figure 29.11. Recurrent minor nosebleeds—refer to ENT.
Nosebleed
Check if the patient is on anticoagulants, aspirin, or
NSAIDs and enquire about bleeding problems
Check BP—often high at the time of the bleed so
review prior to considering treatment. Watch for signs of
shock and airway problems
Most bleeds can be stopped by:
• Pinching the soft tip of nose for ≥10min (tell patients not
to keep looking to check if the bleeding has stopped—
time the 10min and do not let go during that time)
• If available, applying an ice pack to the bridge of the nose
• Sitting the patient up (d pressure within the bleeding blood
vessels) and leaning the patient forward to prevent blood
entering the post-nasal space

Bleeding in terminally ill patients Bleeding can be a terminal event in
patients with cancer. Where possible, make a decision in advance about
whether to treat severe bleeding and prepare carers.
• If a decision is made to treat Treat as for hypovolaemic shock, and
admit to hospital as an emergency. 0 If bleeding from a lung tumour,
protect the airway and lie the patient on the side of the tumour
• If a decision is made not to treat Stay with the patient, and give
sedative medication (e.g. midazolam 20–40mg sc or IV or diazepam
10–20mg PR ± analgesia). Support the carers

Other rarer causes of shock Admit as medical emergencies:

• Neurogenic Due to cerebral trauma or haemorrhage, e.g. head injury,
subarachnoid haemorrhage
• Poisoning
• Liver failure

Emergencies in general practice

Gastrointestinal bleeding
Take all gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds seriously; 7% of patients admitted to
hospital with acute GI bleeding die.

Causes of GI bleeding
Upper GI bleed
• Peptic ulcer
• Gastritits
• Mallory–Weiss tear
• Oesophagitis
• Oesophageal or gastric cancer
• Oesophageal varices
• Drugs—steroids,
anticoagulants, NSAIDs
• Angiodysplasia
• Haemangioma
• Bleeding disorders
• Swallowed blood from
nosebleed

Lower GI bleed
• Diverticulitis
• Colitis—infectious or
inflammatory
• Large bowel tumour or polyp
• Haemorrhoids
• Anal fissure
• Angiodysplasia (A-V
malformations are common)
• Haemangioma
• Bleeding disorders
• Blood from upper GI bleed

Risk factors
Lower GI bleed
Upper GI bleed
• Change in bowel habit
• History of alcohol abuse
• History of diverticulitis
• History of chronic liver disease
• History of UC
• History of NSAID use
• History of oral steroid use
All GI bleeds
• Anticoagulant use
• Serious medical conditions (e.g. cardiovascular/respiratory/renal disease)
• Recent tiredness (? due to anaemia)

Presentation
Upper GI bleeding Typical presentation:
• Haematemesis—vomiting of blood
• Melaena—passage of black, offensive, tarry stool, consisting of digested
blood per rectum. Always indicates a significant bleed. 0 Iron tablets
may cause black stools
Lower GI bleeding Passage of fresh blood per rectum. Brisk bleeding
is a medical emergency but often patients complain of small amounts
of bleeding related to passage of stool. Mixed blood and stool implies
bleeding proximal to the sigmoid colon; blood around the stool implies a
more distal bleed; blood on the toilet paper or in the pan not mixed with
stool is often from anal bleeding due to haemorrhoids or an anal fissure.
0 Very heavy upper GI bleeds can present with fresh red bleeding PR.
Other features That may be present and indicate a significant bleed (may
precede bleeding):
• Faintness or dizziness, especially on standing
• Patient feels cold or clammy
• Collapse ± cardiac arrest

Gastrointestinal bleeding

Examination
• Colour—pallor, peripheral cyanosis
• BP, pulse, and JVP—tachycardia, d BP/JVP, and/or postural drop
• Depending on clinical state, perform abdominal ± rectal examination
• If history is suggestive of haemorrhoids/anal fissure, check anus
• Examine any vomitus/stool

Action
• When a call for help is received—arrange immediate emergency transfer
of the patient to hospital if a significant acute GI bleed is suspected
• Arrange to see the patient if diagnosis from history or severity of
bleed is unclear
• Regard as an emergency until proved otherwise
On assessment Briefly assess the severity of the bleed from history and
examination. If a significant GI bleed is suspected:
• Lie the patient flat and lift legs higher than body (e.g. feet on a pillow)
• Insert a large-bore IV cannula—the opportunity may be lost by the
time the ambulance crew arrives. If possible take a sample for FBC
and cross-match on insertion
• If available, give oxygen
• If available, start IV fluids
• Transfer as rapidly as possible to hospital
Follow up for patients with less severe bleeds Except for patients with
haemorrhoids/anal fissure, all patients presenting with GI bleeding, even
if the bleeding does not cause any circulatory compromise, require further investigation to establish the cause of the bleeding. Refer urgently
to a lower GI team if:
• ≥60y with rectal bleeding persisting ≥6wk without anal symptoms—
even without change in bowel habit
• ≥40y with a combination of rectal bleeding persisting ≥6wk, combined
with a change in bowel habit towards looser stools/i stool frequency

Coffee-ground vomit Vomiting of altered blood—looks like coffee
granules. Implies upper GI bleeding—although less severe than fresh red
blood. History and examination is as for acute GI bleed. Always admit to
hospital for further assessment.
Management in terminally ill patients If a terminally ill patient has
a severe, life-threatening bleed, make a decision whether the cause of the
bleed is treatable or a terminal event. This is best done in advance, but
bleeding cannot always be predicted.
If active treatment is indicated Treat as for acute GI bleeding.
If no active treatment is indicated
• Stay with the patient
• Give sedative medication, e.g. midazolam 20–40mg sc or IV or
diazepam 10–20mg PR ± analgesia
• Support carers, as big bleeds are extremely distressing
0 Unless a patient is very near to death, admit all palliative patients with
non-life-threatening GI bleeds related to their underlying condition. Palliative
treatment options include laser treatment and arterial embolization—both
can be performed on frail patients.

Emergencies in general practice

Meningitis and encephalitisND
Meningitis and encephalitis present in similar fashion. Usually rapid onset
(<48h). Typical symptoms may be preceded with a prodrome of fever,
vomiting, malaise, poor feeding, and lethargy which is often indistinguishable from a viral infection. Particularly significant early signs include:
• Severe leg pain—so bad that the child cannot stand/walk
• Cold hands or feet when the child is running a fever
• Pale skin ± blueness around the lips

Typical symptoms/signs
Meningism
• Headache
• Photophobia
• Stiff neck—cannot put chin on chest
• Kernig’s sign +ve—with hips fully flexed, resists passive knee extension
i intracranial pressure
• d pulse rate
• Irritability
• Drowsiness
• i BP
• Fits
• d consciousness
• Bulging fontanelle (baby)
• Vomiting
• Abnormal tone/
posturing
• Focal neurological signs
Septicaemia/septic shock
• Peripheral shutdown—cool peripheries, mottled
•	 Fever
skin, cyanosis, capillary refill time >2s
• Arthritis
• Peripheral oxygen saturation of ≤95%
• Hypotension
• ± rash—petechiae suggest meningococcus
• Tachycardia
• Tachypnoea

• Small children or immunocompromised patients may not present with
typical signs. Go on gut feeling.

• Action

• Call an emergency ambulance and get the patient to hospital as soon
as possible
• If shocked, lie the patient flat and raise legs above waist height
• If symptoms/signs of meningococcal disease, give IV/IM
benzylpenicillin immediately while awaiting transport. Dose:
• Adult or Child ≥10y—1.2g • Child 1–9y—600mg
• Infant <1y—300mg
• DO NOT delay transfer to hospital to give antibiotics
• Withhold penicillin ONLY if there is a clear history of anaphylaxis
in response to a previous dose (a rash following penicillin is not a
contraindication). Cefotaxime is an alternative (adult or child >12y—
1g; child <12y—50mg/kg)
• For meningitis without signs of meningococcal disease, only give
penicillin if urgent transfer to hospital is not possible
• If possible gain IV access whilst awaiting the ambulance and take
blood for cultures. Consider starting IV fluids/plasma expander. Give
10mL/kg rapidly over 10–15min
• If available give 100% oxygen

Meningitis and encephalitis

Contact tracing/prophylaxis for meningococcal disease
• Meningitis and acute encephalitis are notifiable diseases
• Contact tracing is undertaken by the local public health department
• For a single case, only close contacts (‘kissing contacts’), e.g. people living
in the same household, require prophylactic antibiotics and vaccination
Prophylactic antibiotics
• Ciprofloxacin 500mg as a single dose (age 5–12y—250mg;
<5y—30mg/kg—maximum 125mg), or
• Rifampicin 600mg bd for 2d (child 10mg/kg bd for 2d unless <1y when
dose is 5mg/kg bd for 2d). Rifampicin colours urine red
Vaccination Offer close contacts vaccination appropriate to the serotype
of the confirmed case.

Late-onset effects Be alert for:

• Hearing loss (formal audiology testing should be organized by the
treating hospital)
• Ongoing neurological problems, e.g fits, hemiparesis
• Orthopaedic problems, e.g bone and joint damage, leading to poor
limb growth
• Psychosocial effects, e.g learning disability, behavioural difficulties

Meningitis vaccination
• Group C strains responsible for 40% of meningococcal disease
• Group B strains responsible for most of the rest
• Group A strains common in other parts of the world; rare in the UK
Meningitis B vaccination (Bexsero) In the UK, currently only available
privately but not through the NHS. Protects against 88% of meningitis
B strains. A booster dose is needed after >1mo (>2mo if aged >2y but
<11y); children <2y require 3 doses >1mo apart.
Meningococcal A&C vaccine No protection against group B strain.
Immunize individuals travelling abroad to high-risk areas with the
Meningococcal A&C vaccine, even if they have received the Meningitis C
conjugate vaccine beforehand.
Meningitis C conjugate vaccine
• For infants, doses are given at 3mo and 12–13mo as part of the routine
childhood vaccination programme
• A booster dose is given at 13–14y (or before starting higher education
if no booster at 13–14y)
• Vaccine may be given to HIV +ve patients
• A gap of 6mo is recommended between a dose of the Meningococcal A&C
vaccine, usually given for travel purposes, and Meningitis C conjugate vaccine
• Do not use Meningitis C conjugate vaccine for travel purposes as the
greatest risk is from group A infection

Emergencies in general practice

Chest pain and palpitations
Chest pain Common symptom.
• Always think—could this be an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), PE,
dissecting aneurysm, or pericariditis?
On receiving the call for assistance Ask:
• Nature and location of the pain
• Duration of the pain
• Other associated symptoms—sweating, nausea, shortness of breath,
palpitations
• Past medical history (particularly heart disease, high cholesterol)
• Family history (particularly heart disease)
• Smoker?
Action
• Consider differential diagnosis (see Table 29.3)
• If ACS is suspected call for ambulance assistance before (or instead
of) visiting
• Otherwise visit (or arrange surgery appointment), assess, and treat
according to cause

History Ask about:
• Site and nature of pain. Any history of trauma?
• Duration
• Associated symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, nausea)
• Provoking and relieving factors
• PMH, FH (e.g. heart disease), drug history, smoking history
Examination
• Check BP in both arms
• General appearance—distress, sweating, pallor
• JVP and carotid pulse
• Respiratory rate
• Apex beat
• Heart sounds
• Lung fields
• Local tenderness
• Pain on movement of chest
• Skin rashes
• Swelling or tenderness of legs (? DVT)
Investigations ECG and CXR may be helpful.

Palpitations The uncomfortable awareness of heart beat. Can be
physiological (e.g. after exercise, at times of stress) or signify arrhythmia.
Can cause a feeling of faintness or even collapse (e.g. Stokes–Adams attack,
due to AV block). Ask the patient to tap out the rhythm.
• Bradycardia b p. 272
• Occasional missed beat Suggests ventricular ectopics—b p. 268
• Tachycardia b p. 268

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Acute coronary syndrome
The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) covers:
• Myocardial infarction Both ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) and
non-ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI), and
• Unstable angina
Initial primary care management is the same for STEMI, NSTEMI, and
unstable angina.

Presentation May be new onset or a rapid deterioration in stable
angina. Presenting features include:
• Sustained central chest pain (>15min)—typically described as central
crushing/pressure, band-like pain
• Pain radiating to the arms, jaw, back, or upper abdomen (may be the
only symptom)
• Symptoms resulting from sympathetic autonomic stimulation, e.g.
nausea, vomiting, sweating
• Symptoms relating to shock, e.g. breathlessness, hypotension, collapse
Other factors to consider
• Does the patient have risk factors for cardiac disease?
• Has the patient had previous investigations for chest pain? If so, what
investigations were done, when, and what were the results?
• Does the patient have a history of ischaemic heart disease? If so, what
is the current treatment and what has been tried in the past?

• Diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is sometimes difficult
(e.g. patients with DM may have silent MI): have a high index of suspicion.

Examination Pulse, BP, JVP, heart sounds, chest (? pulmonary oedema).
ECG Do not do an ECG if it delays transfer of the patient to hospital.

Normal ECG does not exclude ACS. If an ECG is done, fax it to the
receiving hospital. ECG changes—see Table 29.4.

Action
When the call for assistance is made If ACS is suspected, arrange
immediate transfer to hospital. For reperfusion interventions (thrombolysis
or percutaneous coronary intervention) to be effective, they must be
carried out as soon as possible after the onset of pain. Seeing the patient
before arranging transfer introduces unnecessary delays.
If possible attend the patient once the ambulance has been called:
• Give pain relief with either sublingual GTN or IV/IM opioid (e.g.
morphine 5–10mg—half dose if elderly/frail) or both
• Give aspirin 300mg po (unless contraindicated)
• Consider giving IV/IM antiemetic (e.g. metoclopramide 10mg)
• Measure oxygen saturation with pulse oximeter—only give oxygen
if saturations are <94%. Aim for saturations of 94–98% (88–92% if
known COPD and at risk of CO2 retention)
• If bradycardia, consider giving atropine 500 micrograms IV and
further doses of 500 micrograms if needed to a maximum of 3mg

Acute coronary syndrome

0 To avoid inadvertent replication of medication when the patient
reaches hospital, record all drugs that have been given (name of the drug,
dose and route of administration, time administered). Send this information to hospital with the patient.

are needed.
Late calls If the patient is seen pain-free after an acute episode.
Admit as an emergency if the patient
• Has signs of complications that require emergency admission (e.g.
pulmonary oedema)
• Is seen <12h after the acute episode and the ECG is abnormal or ECG
is unavailable
Arrange same day specialist assessment if the patient
• Is seen <12h after the acute episode, is well and ECG is normal
• Is seen 12–72h after the acute episode and there are no reasons for
immediate emergency admission
If the patient is seen >72h after an acute episode and is well Assess
clinically, perform ECG, and arrange blood test for troponin. Refer to
cardiology for routine follow-up/more urgently, depending on the clinical
situation. For patients with new-onset chest pain, most areas run rapid
access chest pain clinics.
In the interim, start regular aspirin; supply with GTN spray, and warn to
call for assistance (by calling ambulance and/or emergency GP) if chest
pain lasts >15min despite GTN spray.

Emergencies in general practice

The choking adult
• If blockage of the airway is only partial, the victim will usually be
able to dislodge the foreign body by coughing. If obstruction is complete,
urgent intervention is required to prevent asphyxia (see Figure 29.12).
Is foreign body airways obstruction (FBAO) likely?
• Sudden onset of respiratory distress whilst eating?
• Is the victim clutching his neck?

Is the patient coughing effectively?
Signs of an effective cough include
• In response to the question ‘Are you choking?’ the victim answers and
says ‘Yes’
• Fully responsive—able to speak, cough, and breathe
3 Encourage the victim to cough, and monitor.
Signs of an ineffective cough include
• In response to the question ‘Are you choking?’ the victim either
responds by nodding or is unable to respond
• Breathing sounds wheezy
•	Unable to breathe
• Attempts at coughing are silent
•	Unconscious
3 Call for assistance (e.g. dial 999) and assess conscious level.

If victim IS conscious but has absent/ineffective coughing

• Give up to 5 back blows as needed
• If back blows do not relieve the obstruction, give up to 5 abdominal
thrusts as needed
Following back blows or abdominal thrusts Reassess:
• If the object has not been expelled and the victim is still conscious
Continue the sequence of back blows and abdominal thrusts
• If the object is expelled successfully Assess clinical condition
(including abdominal examination if abdominal thrusts used). If there is
any suspicion part of the object is still in the respiratory tract or there
are any intra-abdominal injuries as a result of abdominal thrusts, refer
to A&E for assessment

If the victim becomes UNCONSCIOUS
• Support the victim carefully to the ground
• Immediately call an ambulance
• Begin CPR (b p. 1054), with 30 chest compressions at a rate of
100–120/min—even if carotid pulse is present
Foreign body in the throat Occurs after eating—fish bone or food
bolus are most common. Can cause severe discomfort, distress, and inability to swallow saliva.
Management Refer immediately to A&E or ENT for investigation
(lateral neck X-ray ± laryngoscopy). Most fish bones have passed and
the discomfort comes from mucosal trauma. Food boluses often pass
spontaneously (especially if the patient is given a smooth muscle relaxant)
but occasionally need removal under GA.

Back blows for adults
• Stand to the side and slightly behind the victim
• Support the chest with 1 hand and lean the victim well forwards
so that when the obstructing object is dislodged it comes out of
the mouth
• Give up to 5 sharp blows between the shoulder blades with the heel
of the other hand

Abdominal thrusts for adults
• Stand behind the victim and put both arms around the upper part of
the abdomen
• Lean the victim forwards
• Clench your fist and place it between the umbilicus and bottom end
of the sternum
• Grasp this hand with your other hand and pull sharply inwards and
upwards. Repeat up to 5 times as needed

Emergencies in general practice

The choking child
• If the child is breathing spontaneously, encourage his own efforts to
clear the obstruction. ONLY intervene if ineffective (see Figure 29.13).

Is foreign body airways obstruction (FBAO) likely? Look for:
• Sudden onset of respiratory distress in a previously well child—often
witnessed by the child’s carer
• Respiratory distress associated with coughing, gagging, or stridor
• Recent history of playing with or eating small objects

Is the child coughing effectively?
Signs of an effective cough include
• Fully responsive—crying or verbal response to questions
• Loud cough and able to take a breath before coughing
3 Encourage the child to cough and monitor.
Signs of an ineffective cough include
•	Unable to vocalize
• Quiet or silent cough
•	Unable to breathe ± cyanosis
• Decreasing level of consciousness
3 Call for assistance (e.g. dial 999), and assess conscious level.

If the child IS conscious but has absent/ineffective coughing Give

up to 5 back blows as needed. If back blows do not relieve the obstruction,
give up to 5 chest thrusts (infants <1y) or up to 5 abdominal thrusts
(children ≥1y) as needed. Then reassess:
• If the object has not been expelled and the victim is still conscious
Continue the sequence of back blows and chest (for infant) or
abdominal (for children) thrusts. 0 Do not leave the child
• If the object is expelled successfully Assess clinical condition (including
abdominal examination if abdominal thrusts used). If there is any
suspicion part of the object is still in the respiratory tract or there are any
intra-abdominal injuries as a result of abdominal thrusts, refer to A&E
If the child is UNCONSCIOUS 0 Do not leave the child.
• Place on a firm, flat surface—call out/send for help if not arrived
• Open the mouth and look for any obvious object. If one is seen, make
an attempt to remove it with a single finger sweep
• Open the airway and attempt 5 rescue breaths. Assess effectiveness of
each breath—if a breath does not make the chest rise, reposition the
head before making the next attempt
• If there is no response to the rescue breaths, proceed immediately
to chest compression—regardless of whether the breaths were
successful. Follow the PBLS sequence (b p. 1060) for 1min before
summoning help if not already there
If it appears the obstruction has been relieved Open and check the
airway. Deliver rescue breaths if the child is not breathing. If the child
regains consciousness and is breathing effectively, place him in a safe
side-lying (recovery) position, and monitor breathing and conscious level
whilst awaiting the arrival of the emergency services.

Back blows for small children/infants
• Place the child in a head-downwards, prone position (e.g. across
your lap). Support the head if needed by holding the jaw
• Deliver a smart blow with the heel of one hand to the middle of the
back between the shoulder blades. Repeat up to 5 times as needed

Back blows for older children
• Support the child in a forward-leaning position
• Deliver a smart blow with the heel of one hand to the middle of
the back between the shoulder blades from behind. Repeat up to 5
times as needed

Chest thrusts for infants <1y
• Turn the child into a supine position with head down (e.g. by holding
the child’s occiput and laying the child along your arm, supported on
your thigh)
• Deliver 5 sharp chest thrusts (like chest compressions but slower rate
720/min) to a point 1 finger’s breadth above the xiphisternum

Abdominal thrusts for children �1y
• Stand behind the child (kneel if small child). Place your arms under
the child’s arms and encircle his torso
• Clench your fist and place it between the umbilicus and xiphisternum
• Grasp your clenched hand with your other hand and pull sharply
inwards and upwards. Repeat up to 5 times as needed
0 Ensure that pressure is not applied to the xiphoid process or the
lower rib cage as this may cause abdominal trauma.

Emergencies in general practice

Acute breathlessness in adults
Attend as soon as possible after receiving the call for help. If there is likely
to be any delay, call for emergency ambulance assistance.

On arrival
• Be calm and reassuring—breathlessness is frightening and panic only
adds to the sensation of being breathless
• Direct history and examination to finding the cause as quickly as
possible—treat according to the cause
• If no cause can be found—do not delay—admit to hospital as an acute
medical emergency

Causes See Table 29.5.
Acute left ventricular failure (acute LVF) Severe acute breathlessness due to pulmonary oedema. Urgent action is needed to save life.
Presenting features
• Sudden acute breathlessness
• Fatigue
• Cough ± haemoptysis (usually pink and frothy)
• Tends to occur at night
• Some relief gained from sitting/standing
Signs
• Dyspnoea
• Tachycardia—gallop rhythm may be present
• Coarse wet-sounding crackles at both bases
• Ankle/sacral oedema if right heart failure also present
• ± hypotension

Action
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

If severe call for emergency ambulance support
Sit the patient up
Be reassuring—it is very frightening to be very short of breath
Give oxygen if available—aim for peripheral oxygen saturations of
94–98% (if history of COPD give 24% oxygen and aim for saturations
of 88–92%)
Give IV furosemide 20–50mg slowly (or bumetanide 1–2mg)
Give IV morphine 5–10mg or diamorphine 2.5–5mg over 5min
Give metoclopramide 10mg IV (can be mixed with morphine/
diamorphine)
Give GTN spray 2 puffs sublingually

Admission Depends on severity and cause of attack, response to
treatment, and social support. Always admit if:
• Alone at home
• Inadequate social support
• Suspected cause of acute LVF warrants admission (e.g. acute MI)
• Very breathless and no improvement over 30min with treatment at home
• Hypotension or arrhythmia

Emergencies in general practice

Pulmonary embolism and
pneumothorax
Pulmonary embolism Venous thrombi—usually from a deep vein

thrombosis in the leg—pass into the pulmonary circulation and block
blood flow to the lungs. Without treatment 20% with proximal deep vein
thrombosis develop pulmonary embolus (PE). PE is listed as a cause of death
on 12,000–13,000 death certificates every year in the UK.
Risk factors
• Immobility—long flight or bus journey, post-op, plaster cast
• Smoking
• Combined hormonal contraception
• Pregnancy or puerperium
• Malignancy
• Past history or family history of DVT, PE, or clotting tendency
Symptoms Acute dyspnoea, pleuritic chest pain, haemoptysis, syncope.
Large clots can be rapidly fatal.
Signs
• Hypotension
• Cyanosis
• Tachypnoea
• Tachycardia
• i JVP
• Pleural rub
Look for a source of emboli—although DVT may not be clinically obvious.

• Have a high level of suspicion. Patients may have minimal symptoms/

signs apart from some pleuritic pain and dyspnoea. PE in the community
can be linked with surgical procedures done 2–3wk previously.

Differential diagnosis
• Pneumonia and pleurisy
• Acute coronary syndrome
• Other causes of acute breathlessness—acute LVF, asthma,
exacerbation of COPD, pneumothorax, shock (e.g. due to
anaphylaxis), arrhythmia, hyperventilation
• Other causes of acute chest pain—aortic dissection, rib fracture,
musculoskeletal chest pain, pericarditis, oesophageal spasm, shingles
Immediate action If suspected, give oxygen as soon as possible (aim to
keep SpO2 at 94–98%) and admit as an acute medical emergency.
Further management In all cases of proven PE, anticoagulation is started in
hospital or by a hospital-at-home service before discharge to general practice.
Warfarin should be continued for ≥3mo. Aim to keep the INR 72.5 (range 2–3).
Spontaneous pneumothorax Risk factors:
• Previous pneumothorax
• Smoking
• Ascent in an aeroplane
• Diving

Pulmonary embolism and pneumothorax

Cause
• In patients <40y Usually due to rupture of a pleural bleb. The typical
patient is tall, thin, and male (4:5 8 6:1)
• Patients >40y Usually due to COPD (70–80%)
• Rarer causes Asthma, pneumonia, TB, lung cancer, pulmonary fibrosis
Presentation Sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain or i breathlessness ±
pallor and tachycardia. Look for resonant percussion note, d or absent
breath sounds—signs may be absent if the pneumothorax is small.
Management
• Refer for same-day CXR
• If pneumothorax is confirmed, seek specialist advice about further
management
• Small pneumothoraces usually resolve spontaneously (50% collapse
takes ~40d to resorb)—monitor until completely resolved
• Larger pneumothoraces may require admission for aspiration or a
chest drain
• Smoking cessation d risk of recurrence
Traumatic pneumothorax Trauma may not initially be obvious—
ask about injections around the chest area, e.g. acupuncture (to neck and
shoulders as well as chest); aspiration of breast lump, etc. Presentation
and management is as for spontaneous pneumothorax.

Tension pneumothorax Complication of traumatic pneumothorax;

rare after spontaneous pneumothorax. A valvular mechanism develops—air is sucked into the pleural space during inspiration but cannot be
expelled during expiration. The pressure within the pleural space i and
the lung deflates further; the mediastinum shifts to the opposite side of the
chest, and venous return d. Can be rapidly fatal.
Clinical features
• Agitated and distressed patient, often with a history of chest trauma
• Tachycardia
• Sweating
• Signs of a large pneumothorax—d breath sounds and d chest
movement on the affected side
• Mediastinal shift—trachea deviated away from the side of the
pneumothorax
Action If tension pneumothorax is suspected:
• Sit the patient upright if possible
• Insert a large-bore cannula through the 2nd intercostal space of the
chest wall in the mid-clavicular line on the side of the pneumothorax
to relieve the pressure in the pleural space
• Transfer as an emergency to hospital

Emergencies in general practice

Acute asthma in adults
Many deaths from asthma are preventable. Delay can be fatal. Factors
leading to poor outcome include:
• Doctors failing to assess severity by objective measurement
• Patients or relatives failing to appreciate severity
•	Underuse of corticosteroids

• Regard each emergency asthma consultation as acute severe asthma
until proven otherwise.

Risk factors for developing fatal or near-fatal asthma
A combination of severe asthma recognized by ≥1 of
• Previous near-fatal asthma
• Previous admission for asthma—especially if within 1y
• Requiring ≥3 classes of asthma medication
• Heavy use of B2-agonist
• Repeated attendances at A&E for asthma care—especially if within 1y
• Brittle asthma
and adverse behavioural or psychosocial features recognized by ≥1 of
• Non-compliance with treatment or monitoring
• Failure to attend appointments
• Self-discharge from hospital
• Psychosis, depression, other psychiatric illness, or deliberate self-harm
• Current or recent major tranquillizer use
• Employment/income problems
• Denial
• Social isolation
• Alcohol or drug misuse
• Childhood abuse
• Obesity
• Severe marital/legal/domestic stress
• Learning difficulties

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Endocrine emergencies
Hypoglycaemia Known diabetic on oral/insulin therapy. Short history.
May present with coma, fits or odd/violent behaviour, tachycardia ±i BP.
There may or may not have been warning signs/symptoms—sweating,
hunger, tremor. 0 Younger children may present atypically with behavioural changes or headache.
Investigation Blood sugar (on blood testing strip) <2.5mmol/L.
• Action

• If conscious give simple carbohydrate, e.g. 3 glucose tablets, 100mL
of milk or a sugar-containing soft drink, e.g. Lucozade®, 5 sweets (e.g.
Jelly Babies®), or GlucoGel®
• If unable to take oral carbohydrate—give IM glucagon 1mg (children
<25kg—0.5mg)—takes ≤5min to act—may have poor effect if the
patient is starved or drunk—or IV glucose (adult: 50–250mL of 10%
solution in 50mL aliquots; child: 2–5mL/kg of 10% solution)
• Once the patient has regained consciousness supplement with simple
carbohydrate as for the conscious patient and, as symptoms improve
give complex carbohydrate, e.g. biscuits
• Repeat glucose testing in <15min then monitor hourly blood sugars
over the next 4 hours and 4-hourly for the following 24h
• Maintain a high glucose intake for several hours if the patient has a
severe episode of hypoglycaemia due to a sulfonylurea
• Review reasons for the hypoglycaemia

Hyperglycaemic ketoacidotic coma Usually occurs in patients with

type 1 DM but may rarely occur in patients with type 2 DM. May be the way
in which DM presents (i.e. can occur in young patients not known to be diabetic). Presents with a 2–3d history of deterioration often precipitated by infection. Typically the patient is dehydrated with Kussmaul breathing (deep sighing
breaths), ketotic (fruity) smelling breath, shock (d BP and postural drop, tachycardia) ± coma. • Can present with vomiting and abdominal pain mimicking
acute abdomen—always check for ketotic breath and Kussmaul breathing.
Investigation BM is usually >20mmol/L and urine (if available) tests +ve
for ketones.

• Action Arrange to admit as an emergency to hospital. If shocked/
coma—lie flat, elevate feet, and resuscitate:
• Airway—check airway is clear
• Breathing—give O2 if available to maintain SpO2 at 94–98%
• Circulation—gain IV access if possible and give 1L (child: 10mL/kg)
0.9% saline rapidly. Repeat up to 3x as needed
Hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic state Also known as hyperglycaemic
hyperosmolar non-ketotic coma (HONK). Predominantly occurs in patients
with type 2 DM (very rarely type 1 DM). Presents with <1wk history of
deterioration, d level of consciousness, dehydration ++, d BP with postural
drop. Often precipitated by other illness, e.g. infection, MI. May be a presenting feature of type 2 DM. Blood sugar (on blood testing strip) is >35mmol/L.

• Action Admit immediately to hospital.

Endocrine emergencies

Myxoedema coma
Typical presentation
• Hyporeflexia
• >65y old
• Heart failure
• History of thyroid surgery/
• Cyanosis
radioactive iodine
• Bradycardia
• May be precipitated by MI,
• Coma
stroke, infection, or trauma
• Seizures
• Looks hypothyroid
• Hypothermia
Investigation Finger prick blood glucose may be d.
• Action
• Keep warm
• Treat heart failure with diuretics ± opioids and nitrates—b p. 1088
• Admit as an emergency to hospital

Hyperthyroid crisis (thyrotoxic storm)
Risk factors
• Recent thyroid surgery/history of radioactive iodine
• Infection
•	 Trauma
•	 MI
Presentation
• Fever
• Agitation and/or confusion
• Coma
• Tachycardia/AF

• Diarrhoea and vomiting
• Acute abdomen
• May have goitre ± thyroid bruit

• Action Admit as an emergency to hospital.
Hypoadrenal (Addisonian) crisis May occur in patients on

long-term steroids (treatment or replacement) if the steroids are stopped
suddenly or not i during intercurrent illness or may be a presenting feature of congenital adrenal hyperplasia or Addison’s disease. Presents with
vomiting, hypotension, and shock.
Management Give IM or IV hydrocortisone:
• Adults and children >12y: 100mg
• Children 1mo–12y: 2–4mg/kg
Admit to hospital for further management.
Prevention of Addisonian crises
• Warn all patients taking long-term steroids not to stop their steroids
abruptly and to tell any doctor treating them about their condition
• Advise patients to carry a steroid card or Addison’s disease self-help
group emergency card, and wear a Medic-Alert bracelet or similar in
case of emergency
• Double dose of steroid prior to dental treatment or if intercurrent
illness (e.g. URTI)
• If vomiting, replace oral steroid with IM hydrocortisone

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Obstetric emergencies
Resuscitation of the newborn b p. 1066
Eclampsia Occurs when a pregnant woman has a fit as a result of

pre-eclampsia. Usually BP is very high and, if the baby is not yet born,
it becomes distressed. There is a serious risk of stroke in the mother.
Women with pre-eclampsia have a 2% chance of eclamptic seizure. 44%
occur after the baby is born—usually <24h after delivery. Give buccal
midazolam (10mg) or PR diazepam (10–20mg) or IV lorazepam (4mg) and
admit as an acute ‘blue light’ emergency.
HELLP syndrome Occurs in pregnancy or <48h after delivery.
Associated with severe pre-eclampsia.
• Haemolysis
• Elevated Liver enzymes
• Low Platelets
Signs Hypertension (80%); right upper quadrant pain (90%); nausea and
vomiting (50%); oedema.
Management Admit for obstetric assessment.
Obstetric shock Causes:
• Haemorrhage—APH (b p. 818); placental abruption (remember—
bleeding may be internal and not seen per vaginum); PPH (b p. 819)
• Amniotic fluid embolism
• Ruptured uterus
• Broad ligament haematoma
• Inverted uterus
• Septicaemia
• Pulmonary embolus
• Anaphylaxis (usually drugs)

• Action

• Call for help
• Arrange immediate admission to the nearest specialist obstetric unit
(or A&E, if necessary)
• Gain IV access and start IV fluids; give O2 via face mask (if available)
• Treat the cause if apparent

Fetal distress Signifies hypoxia. Signs:
• Passage of meconium during labour
• Fetal tachycardia (>160bpm at term)
• Fetal bradycardia (<100bpm, seek urgent obstetric assistance)
• Action

• Give the mother oxygen via a face mask and turn her onto her side
• Transfer immediately to a specialist obstetric unit for further
assessment ± delivery

Acute abdominal pain in pregnancy Non-obstetric causes of
abdominal pain may be forgotten or signs may be less well localized than
in the non-pregnant patient (b p. 1098).
Appendicitis Mortality is higher in pregnancy and perforation more
common (15–20%). Fetal mortality is 5–10% for simple appendicitis
but rises to 30% when there is perforation. Due to the pregnancy, the

Obstetric emergencies

appendix is displaced and pain is often felt in the paraumbilical region or
subcostally. Admit immediately if suspected.
Cholecystitis Pregnancy encourages gallstone formation. Symptoms include
RUQ pain, nausea, and vomiting. Diagnosis can be confirmed on USS. Treatment
is the same as outside pregnancy aiming for interval cholecystectomy after birth.
Fibroids Torsion or red degeneration. Fibroids i in size in pregnancy.
They may twist if pedunculated. Red degeneration occurs usually after
20wk and may occur until the puerperium. It presents as abdominal pain
± localized tenderness ± vomiting and low-grade fever. Confirm diagnosis
with USS. Treatment is with rest and analgesia. Pain resolves within 1wk.
Ovarian cysts Torsion or rupture of a cyst may both cause abdominal
pain as may bleeding into a cyst. USS can confirm the presence of a cyst.
Management depends on the nature of the cyst and the severity of the
pain. Admit for assessment.
If <20wk gestation, also consider
• Miscarriage b p. 815

• Ectopic pregnancy b p. 816

If >20wk gestation, also consider
• Labour b p. 832
• Pubic symphysis dehiscence b p. 803
• Placental abruption
• Uterine rupture
• Haematoma of the rectus abdominis Rarely bleeding into the
rectus sheath and haematoma formation occurs spontaneously or
after coughing in late pregnancy. May cause swelling and abdominal
tenderness. USS can be helpful. If unsure of diagnosis admit to exclude
acute surgical or obstetric cause of pain

Uterine rupture Rare in the UK. Associated with maternal mortality
of 5% and fetal mortality of 30%. 70% are due to dehiscence of Caesarean
section scars. Rupture occurs most commonly during labour but occasionally in the 3rd trimester or after an otherwise normal delivery.
Presentation Pain is variable but usually severe, bursting, constant lower
abdominal pain ± heavy vaginal bleeding. Generally associated with
profound shock in the mother and fetal distress. If in labour, the presenting
part may disappear from the pelvis ± contractions stop.

• Action Admit as an acute emergency to a specialist obstetric unit.
Placental abruption (abruptio placentae) Part of the placenta

becomes detached from the uterus. Consequences depend on the degree
of separation and the amount of blood loss.
Presentation
• Typically constant pain—may be felt in the back if posterior placenta
• Woody hard, tender uterus
• Shock ± PV bleeding
• Fetal heart absent or signs of fetal distress (fetal tachycardia or bradycardia)

• Action If suspected admit as an acute emergency to the nearest specialist obstetric unit.

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Shoulder dystocia Affects <1% deliveries but is a life-threatening
emergency. Occurs when the anterior shoulder impacts upon the symphysis pubis after the head has delivered and prevents the rest of the baby
following. Most cases of shoulder dystocia are unanticipated.
Clues
• Prolonged 1st or 2nd stage of labour
• ‘Head bobbing’—the head consistently descends then returns to its
original position during a contraction or pushing in the 2nd stage
0 If shoulder dystocia occurs in the community there is usually not time
to transfer a woman to a specialist unit.

• Action Call for help. Consider episiotomy. Then try any of these
procedures (no particular order):
• Roll the mother onto hands and knees and try delivering posterior
shoulder first
• Flex and abduct the mother’s legs up to her abdomen (upside down
squatting position)—try delivery again
• Deliver the posterior arm—put a hand in the vagina in front of the
baby—ensure the posterior elbow is flexed in front of the body and
pull to deliver the forearm. The anterior shoulder usually follows
• External pressure—ask an assistant to apply suprapubic pressure
with the heel of the hand—a rocking movement can help
• Adduction of the most accessible (preferably anterior) shoulder.
Simultaneously put pressure on the posterior clavicle to turn the baby.
If unsuccessful continue rotation through 180 degrees and try again
Cord prolapse The cord passes through the os in front of the presenting
part of the baby. If the presenting part squashes the cord, umbilical blood
flow is restricted causing fetal hypoxia and distress (fetal mortality 10–17%).
Risk factors
• Malpresentation—breech/
transverse/oblique
• Cephalo-pelvic disproportion
• Multiple pregnancy

• Preterm rupture of membranes
• Polyhydramnios
• Pelvic tumours

• Action
• Minimize handling of the cord to prevent spasm
• Try to keep the cord within the vagina
• Call for help
Aim to prevent presenting part from occluding the cord. Try:
• Displacing the presenting part upwards with the examining hand
• Get patient into knee/elbow position—head down
• If possible, drop the head end of the bed
• Fill the bladder with 500–750mL normal saline via a catheter and
clamp the catheter
Admit as an emergency to the nearest specialist obstetric unit—usually
treated with emergency Caesarean section.

Obstetric emergencies

Retained placenta The 3rd stage of labour is complete in <10min in
97% of labours. If the placenta has not been delivered in <30min (to allow
for cervical spasm), it will probably not deliver spontaneously.
• Action
• Avoid excessive cord traction
• Check the placenta is not in the vagina—remove if it is
• Check the uterus
If the uterus is well contracted Cervical spasm is probably trapping
an otherwise separated placenta—wait for cervix to relax to enable
removal of the placenta.
If the uterus is bulky The placenta may have failed to separate. Try:
• Rubbing up a contraction
• Putting the baby to the breast (stimulates uterine contraction)
• Giving a further dose of syntometrine
• If the placenta will still not deliver, admit as emergency for manual
removal

Uterine inversion Rare.
• Action Do not remove the placenta if attached until the uterus is
replaced. If noted early, try to replace the uterus. Otherwise admit as
an emergency. The mother may become profoundly shocked so set up
an IV infusion before transfer if possible, and give O2 via a face mask.
Broad ligament haematoma Presents in a recently delivered
woman as obstetric shock without excessive PV bleeding. Examination
reveals pain and tenderness on the affected side. The uterus is deviated
from that side.
• Action Admit as an acute emergency to the nearest specialist
obstetric unit.
Amniotic fluid embolism Very rare. Mortality 780%. Presents with
shock, cyanosis, and dyspnoea. May occur at the height of a contraction.
• If suspected

• Call for help
• Resuscitate—Airway; Breathing; Circulation
• Transfer as an emergency to the nearest A&E or obstetric unit

Emergencies in general practice

Accidents and injuries
Road accidents Doctors are not legally obliged to attend an accident
they happen to pass—but most feel morally obliged to do so.

Immediate action
• Assess the scene
• Ensure that emergency services have been called
• Take steps to ensure your own safety and that of others, e.g. park
your vehicle defensively; wear a reflective jacket if available; turn on
hazard lights; use warning triangles
• Ensure all vehicle ignitions are turned off
• Triage casualties into priority groups—decide who to attend first
• Forbid smoking
Immediate treatment
• Check the need for basic resuscitation:
• Airway patent?
• Breathing adequate?
• Circulation intact?
• Resuscitate as necessary (b p. 1054 or inside back cover)
• Control any haemorrhage with elevation and pressure
• DO NOT attempt to move anyone who potentially could have a back
or neck injury until skilled personnel and equipment are available
• Do not give anything by mouth
•	Use coats and rugs to keep victims warm
• If available give analgesia (e.g. opioids—but not if significant head
injury or risk of intraperitoneal injury; Entonox®—from ambulance)
• If shocked set up IV fluids if available
• Take directions from the paramedics—they are almost certainly
more experienced than you in these situations
Medicolegal issues
• Ensure your medico-legal insurance covers emergency treatments
• Keep full records of events, action taken, drugs administered, origin of
drugs, batch numbers, and expiry dates
• A GP can charge a fee to the victims for any assistance given
Road safety Road accidents are responsible for 30–40% of all fatal
accidents. Prevention:
• Wear seat belts and appropriate protective clothing (e.g. helmet if
riding a pedal or motorcycle)
• Avoid alcohol/other drugs that hamper performance when driving
• Supervise children close to roads; teach them the Green Cross code
• Keep speed down
• Do not drive if tired or ill
• Keep vehicles well maintained
• Ensure that children are
• When cycling, use cycle tracks if available

Figure 29.18 Who should have tetanus vaccination?

Haematoma Subungual—b p. 487; pinna—b p. 1113
Wounds Most patients with significant lacerations present directly to

A&E. If a patient presents to general practice, perform immediate care
(elevate bleeding limb and apply pressure to arrest bleeding). Advise nil
by mouth and transfer to A&E.
Minor lacerations
• Ensure no foreign body is in the wound—if in doubt refer for X-ray/
surgical exploration (especially important if injury was with glass)
• Wash wound and clean away debris and any necrotic material
• Check there is no damage to underlying nerves, tendons, bone, or
blood supply before dressing or closing a wound
• Aim to oppose the skin edges without tension to allow healing
• Do not attempt to close a wound if you are not confident that you
can achieve an adequate result
• Always refer cuts through the lip margin to A&E; consider referral to
A&E for any facial wounds and wounds in children
• Check tetanus status (see Figure 29.18)
• In assault cases take particular care to document all injuries carefully,
e.g. with photographs, drawings, and measurements of wounds
• Consider non-accidental injury in children—b p. 924

1107

1108

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Closing the wound Options:
• Skin closure strips Use for small cuts in non-hairy skin not under
tension or in addition to sutures for larger wounds
• Skin ‘glue’ (e.g. Histoacryl®) Quick (takes 30s to set) and can be used
on hairy skin such as the scalp
• Suturing Undertake training before attempting suturing.
• Infiltrate wound edges with 1% lidocaine (maximum 2mg/kg)
• Addition of adrenaline (epinephrine) can help haemostasis but must
not be used on digits or extremities, as necrosis can occur
• Take care to oppose edges accurately—start interrupted sutures in
the middle of the wound
• Use appropriate suture (e.g. adult face 5–0 monofilament nylon
remove after 5d; limbs or trunk 3–0 nylon—remove after 1–2wk)

Pretibial lacerations The shin has poor blood supply espe-

cially in the elderly. Flap wounds are common, may heal poorly ±
break down to form ulcers. Management: wash wound. Carefully
realign the flap; secure with skin closure strips without tension, and
bandage. Advise elevation of the leg. Review regularly to check healing.

Airgun pellets Common. Refer for X-ray. Can be difficult to remove—
leave in place if not in a harmful position. If in a joint, refer for removal.
Fish hooks Infiltrate with lidocaine. Push the hook forwards through
the skin until the barb is exposed. Cut the barb off and then ease the hook
back through the skin the same way it entered.
Knocked-out teeth Ask the patient to suck tooth clean, reinsert, or
store in milk or saliva and send to a dentist.
Coin and other foreign body ingestion Most coins will pass
through the gut without any problems. If asymptomatic, they can be left to
take their course (advise checking stools to ensure passed). If symptomatic
refer for X-ray and consideration for endoscopic removal. If there is any
indication of aspiration refer urgently.
Foreign bodies in the ear Most common in children. Try to remove
under direct vision with forceps but avoid pushing objects deeper into
the canal and causing damage. Do not poke around with forceps in an
uncooperative child. Removal under GA may be needed. Insects can be
drowned in oil and syringed out.
Foreign bodies in the nose Common in young children. Any child

with smelly discharge from one nostril has a foreign body in the nose until
proven otherwise—refer for exploration under GA. Do not try to remove
yourself unless the object is very superficial and the child cooperative. You
might push the object further in and cause trauma.

Removal of ticks Use a commercially available tick remover when
possible. If a tick remover is not available, grip the tick as close as possible
to the skin with a pair of tweezers, and firmly pull the tick out of the skin.
Animal bites ~200,000 people are bitten by dogs each year in the UK.
Animal bites are contaminated and wound infection is common. Clean

Accidents and injuries

with soap and water. Check tetanus status. Do not suture unless cosmetically essential and there is minimal tissue damage—refer if in doubt. Give
prophylaxis against infection (e.g. co-amoxiclav or erythromycin).
Human bites Are especially prone to infection. Also consider risk of
hepatitis B and HIV. If HIV prophylaxis is indicated, it needs to be started
immediately—refer urgently to A&E for local policy implementation.
Snake bites The adder is the only poisonous snake in the UK. Bites are
only rarely lethal. Attempt to identify the snake and refer the patient
urgently to hospital. Do not apply a tourniquet or cut/suck the wound.

Rabies risk Consider post-exposure prophylaxis for rabies (vaccination
± immunoglobulin) if:
• Any exposure to bat secretions or bat bites in the UK or elsewhere
(people who work with bats should be vaccinated prior to exposure)
• Animal bite or exposure to animal secretions elsewhere in the
world—risk depends on the location
Further information HPA M www.hpa.org.uk

Insect stings Response depends on the insect involved and the individual’s response. Ranges from blisters through papules to urticarial wheals—
s infection is common.
Anaphylaxis Follow algorithm in Figure 29.10, b p. 1073 and admit to
hospital as a blue light emergency.
Immediately after the sting Remove any sting present in the wound; often
no further treatment is needed.
• If severe local reaction occurs Apply an ice pack; give oral
antihistamine (e.g. chlorphenamine 4mg stat); continue antihistamine
4–6 hourly as needed
• If 2° bacterial infection Treat with oral or topical antibiotics
Remove sources of insects, e.g. remove fleas from carpets with household
flea spray (multiple bites on ankles and lower legs).
Weaver fish sting Common on sandy beaches. The fish lurks under
the sand so usually trodden on—presents with severe pain in the foot.
Immerse the affected area in uncomfortably hot (but not scalding) water.
Give analgesia. Pain resolves after 2–3d.
Jellyfish sting
• Remove the patient from the sea as soon as possible
• Scrape or wash adherent tentacles off
• Alcoholic solutions including suntan lotions should not be applied
because they may cause further discharge of stinging hairs
• Ice packs d pain and a slurry of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), but
not vinegar, may be useful for treating stings from UK species
Home safety Every year >4,000 people die due to accidents in the
home and nearly 3 million seek treatment in A&E departments. Spot the
dangers; offer safety advice (e.g. from HV if young children in the house);
fit smoke alarms and safety devices (e.g. stair gates for toddlers); ensure
adequate supervision of children or elderly confused people; maintain
equipment correctly.

Emergencies in general practice

Fractures
• Symptoms Pain—worse on movement, d function
• Signs Swelling; bruising; deformity; local tenderness; impaired function;
crepitus; abnormal mobility
• Action
• Immobilize the affected part and give analgesia
• If available and the patient is shocked, start an IV infusion
• Refer to A&E for assessment, X-ray, and treatment

Ottawa rules for ankle or foot injury Foot and ankle injuries are

common. It can be difficult to distinguish between a sprain and a fracture.
The Ottawa rules d need for X-ray by a quarter:
Ankle injury Refer for an ankle X-ray if there is pain in the malleolar area AND:
• Bone tenderness at the posterior tip of the lateral malleolus, or
• Bone tenderness at the posterior tip of the medial malleolus, or
•	Unable to weight bear at the time of the injury and when seen
Foot injury Refer for a foot X-ray if there is pain in the mid-foot AND:
• Bone tenderness at the 5th metatarsal base, or
• Bone tenderness at the navicular, or
•	Unable to weight bear at the time of injury and when seen

Otherwise diagnose a sprain Treat sprains with rest, ice, compression,
elevation, and analgesia (paracetamol ± NSAIDs). If severe (or the patient
is an athlete), refer to physiotherapy.
Fractures See Table 29.7.
Always consider assessment and treatment for osteoporosis in
all men and women >50y who have had a Colles’ fracture, hip
fracture, and/or vertebral collapse.

Head and facial injury b p. 1112
Fracture complications Often occur after the patient has been dis-

charged from hospital and may present as a primary care emergency.
Refer back to the fracture clinic or A&E if:
• Persistent pain
• Limb swelling that is not settling
• Offensive odour or discharge
• Wound infection that is not settling with oral antibiotics
• External pins/wires become infected
• External pins/wires are catching on clothing or other parts of the body
• Cast edges are abrading the skin
• Cast has deteriorated in structural strength, e.g. from getting wet
Compartment syndrome Crush injury, fracture, prolonged immobility, or tight splints, dressings, or casts can result in i pressure within
muscle compartments and eventually vascular occlusion. Presents with
swelling, severe pain—i on passive stretch of muscles, distal numbness,
redness, mottling, blisters. 0 Pulses may be present distally. Loosen any
restricting bandage/cast. Refer as an emergency to orthopaedics—fasciotomy may be needed to relieve the pressure.

Fractures

Table 29.7 Common fractures seen in primary care
Fracture

Features and management

Clavicle

Common injury (5% all fractures). Usually results from a fall onto
an outstretched arm. 80% fractures are in the middle third; 15% the
lateral third; and 5% the medial third
Refer to A&E for confirmation of diagnosis and fracture clinic
follow-up. Treatment is with sling support and analgesia. Most
heal well
Complications Pneumothorax, malunion, and nerve/vessel damage

Colles’

Most commonly due to a fall onto an outstretched hand in an elderly
lady. Pain and swelling of the wrist (‘dinner fork’ deformity)
Refer any suspected fracture for X-ray and reduction
Complications Include rupture of the extensor pollicis longus tendon,
carpal tunnel syndrome, and reflex sympathetic dystrophy

Scaphoid

Caused by falling onto an outstretched hand. Pain, swelling, and
tenderness in the anatomical snuffbox
Symptoms may be mild and fracture is easily missed—refer suspected
cases for scaphoid view X-rays. If X-ray is inconclusive and pain
continues, repeat 2wk later-bone scan or MRI can help if still –ve
Non-union and avascular necrosis of the proximal fragment is a
potential complication, which can lead to long-term problems of
arthritis and pain

Fingers

Common injuries. Often associated with sport. Refer all suspected
fractures for X-ray + reduction

Hip

Common amongst the elderly and carries high morbidity and
mortality (~25%). 5>4. Usually occurs through the neck of the
femur
Risk factors Maternal hip fracture, osteoporosis; unsteadiness;
sedative medication, poor eyesight, and polypharmacy
There may be a history of a fall but not always. Suspect in any patient
who is elderly or has risk factors for osteoporosis who is ‘off legs’.
Occasionally, patients can still weight bear with difficulty
Signs External rotation, shortening, and adduction of leg
Refer urgently to A&E for X-ray

Ankle

History is of a fall over an obstacle or trip down a step. The ankle
rapidly becomes swollen and tender—often bilaterally
Decide whether an X-ray is needed. If so, refer to A&E

Metatarsals

The most common fracture is of the base of the 5th metatarsal in
an ‘ankle twisting’ injury. March or stress fractures occur in people
who do a lot of walking or running and affect the neck/shaft of the
2nd metatarsal
Decide whether an X-ray is needed. If so, refer to A&E. Undisplaced
fractures are usually treated with analgesia and support

Toes

Caused by stubbing the toe or dropping a heavy object on it
Undisplaced suspected fractures Do not X-ray unless diagnosis is in
doubt. Support the injured toe by ‘buddy’ strapping it to the adjacent
toe. Give analgesia
Fracture displacement and/or dislocation Refer for X-ray and
reduction

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Head and facial injury
Severe head injury
• Perform basic life support (b p. 1054)
• Protect the cervical spine (see b p. 1071)
• Transfer to A&E by ambulance

Less severe head injuries
History If possible take the history from a witness as well as the patient.
Ask about circumstances of injury, loss of consciousness (LOC), seizures,
current symptoms, and behaviour.
Examination Check scalp, head for injury, neurological examination
(including fundi), other injuries—accompanying neck injuries are common.

• Refer to A&E ifN
• Glasgow Coma Scale <15 at any time since injury—b p. 1068
• Loss of consciousness
• Focal neurological deficit since injury—problems speaking,
understanding, reading, writing, d sensation, loss of balance,
weakness, visual changes, abnormal reflexes, problems walking,
irritability, or altered behaviour especially in young children
• Any suspicion of skull fracture; penetrating head injury; blood or CSF
in the nose, ear, or wound; serious scalp laceration or haematoma
• Amnesia for events before or after injury
• Persistent headache
• Vomiting
• Seizure
• Any previous cranial neurosurgical interventions
• High-energy head injury (e.g. pedestrian hit by motor vehicle, fall
>1m or >5 stairs)
• History bleeding or clotting disorder or on anticoagulant therapy
• Difficulty in assessing the patient (e.g. very young, elderly, intoxicated
or epileptic) or concern about diagnosis
• Suspicion of non-accidental injury
• Inadequate supervision at home
0 If Glasgow Coma Scale is <15, neck pain/tenderness, focal neurological deficit, paraesthesiae in the extremities or any other clinical suspicion
of cervical spine injury, immobilize the neck and refer to A&E.
If examination is normal
• Warn the patient (+ carer) that he/she may suffer mild headaches,
tiredness, dizziness, tinnitus, poor concentration, and poor memory for
the next few days
• Advise rest and paracetamol (but not codeine-based analgesics) for the
headache
•	Young children can be difficult to assess—sleepiness is common and
not a worrying sign as long as the child is rousable
• Give written head injury information regarding warning signs to trigger
reconsultation—drowsiness, severe headache, persistent vomiting,
visual disturbance, and/or unusual behaviour

Head and facial injury

Injury to the face Mostly due to RTAs and violent incidents. Carefully
document injuries as your notes may be required for legal proceedings.
Look for other injuries, e.g. airway problems, head injury, neck injury.
Palpate the face for signs of a fracture—if present refer to maxillofacial
surgeons for assessment. Check tetanus status. Post-traumatic stress disorder (b p. 998) is common after facial injury.
Specific injuries
• Facial lacerations Best sutured by an experienced surgeon. Refer
to A&E
• Fractured mandible A blow to the jaw can cause unilateral or
bilateral fractures. Presents with pain (worse on moving jaw), bruising
± bleeding inside the mouth ± discontinuity of the teeth (displaced
fracture) ± numbness of the lower lip (if the inferior dental nerve has
been damaged). Refer for X-ray
• Dislocated jaw Presents with pain and the mouth is stuck open—refer
for X-ray and reduction
• Fractured zygoma/malar complex A blow on the cheek may fracture
the zygomatic arch in isolation or more usually cause a ‘tripod’
fracture. Signs: bony tenderness, flattening of the malar process—
best seen from above (may be masked by swelling), epistaxis,
subconjunctival haemorrhage extending posteriorly, and infraorbital
numbness ± jaw locked. Refer for X-ray. Advise not to blow nose
• Middle third facial fractures (Le Fort) Usually bilateral. Signs:
epistaxis, CSF rhinorrhoea, crepitus on palpation, swelling, open bite,
and risk of airway compromise. Refer for X-ray
• Haematoma of the pinna Usually after trauma (e.g. rugby). Must be
evacuated urgently (aspirated via large-bore needle or surgically) to
prevent necrosis of the cartilage and ‘cauliflower’ ear—refer
• Nasal fracture and other nasal injuries b p. 941
• ‘Blow out’ fracture of orbit b p. 959
• Whiplash b p. 475
• Avulsed tooth b p. 1108
• Dog bite b p. 1108

Post-concussion syndrome Seen following even quite minor head

injury. Due to neuronal damage. Features include all, or some, of:
• Fatigue
• Headache
• Depression
• Dizziness
• Memory problems
• Poor concentration
Treatment is supportive and symptoms usually resolve with time
(although can take months or even years).

Emergencies in general practice

Scalds and burns
Assess

• Cause, size, and thickness of the burn
•	Use the ‘rule of nines’ to estimate the extent of the burn (see Box 29.1)
• Partial thickness burns are red, painful, and blistered; full thickness
burns are painless and white or grey
• Always consider non-accidental injury in children—b p. 924
• Action
• Remove clothing from the affected area and place under cold
running water for >10min or until pain is relieved
• Do not burst blisters
• Prescribe/give analgesia
• Refer all but the smallest (<5%) partial thickness burns for
assessment in A&E
• Refer all electrical burns for assessment in A&E
• Refer all chemical burns for assessment in A&E unless burn area is
minimal and pain-free
• Consider referral to A&E for smoke inhalation
If managing the burn in the community
• Check tetanus immunity, and give immunization ± prophylaxis as
necessary—b p. 1107
• Apply silver sulfadiazine cream (Flamazine®) or paraffin-impregnated
gauze and non-adherent dressings and review for healing and
infection every 1–2d
• Cover burns on hands in Flamazine® and place in a plastic bag—
elevate the hand in a sling and encourage finger movement
• Refer if burns are not healed in 10–12d

Prevention of scalds and burns
• Prevention through public education is important
• Children often sustain burns by pulling on the flex of boiling kettles or
irons, pulling on saucepan handles, or climbing onto hot cookers
• Refer any children who have sustained accidental burns to the health
visitor for follow-up

Smoke inhalation
• Refer all patients who have potentially inhaled smoke for
assessment—a seemingly well patient can deteriorate later
• Smoke can cause thermal injury, carbon monoxide poisoning, and
cyanide poisoning
• Airway problems occur due to thermal and chemical damage to the
airways causing oedema—suspect if singed nasal hairs, a sore throat,
or a hoarse voice
• Carbon monoxide poisoning may result in the classic cherry-red
mucosa—but this may be absent
• Cyanide poisoning is commonly due to smouldering plastics and causes
dizziness, headaches, and seizures

The ‘rule of nines’ is inaccurate for children <10y. For children and for small burns, estimate the extent of the burn by
comparison with the area of the patient’s hand. The area of
the fingers and palm ~1% total body surface area burn.

Sunburn Susceptibility depends on skin type.
• Tingling is followed 2–12h later by erythema. Redness is maximal at
24h and fades over 2–3d. Desquamation and pigmentation follow
• Severe sunburn may cause blistering, pain, and systemic upset.
Treatment is symptomatic with calamine lotion prn (some advocate
application of vinegar) and paracetamol for pain
• Rarely, dressings are required for blisters or, in severe cases, hospital
admission for fluid management
• Predisposes to skin cancer and photoageing
The sun safety code Take care not to burn in the sun
• Cover up with loose cool clothing, a hat, and sunglasses
• If swimming outdoors or on the beach, dress in a UV protective
sunsuit. When out of the water, add a T-shirt, sunglasses, and sun hat
• Seek shade during the hottest part of the day
• Apply sunscreen (≥SPF 25) on sun-exposed parts of the body

Burns in special situations
Chemical burns
•	Usually caused by strong acids or alkalis
• Wear gloves to remove contaminated clothing
• Irrigate with cold running water for ≥20min
• Do not attempt to neutralize the chemical—this can exacerbate
injury by producing heat
• Refer all burns to A&E, unless the burn area is minimal and pain-free
Electric shock
• Causes thermal tissue injury and direct injury due to the electric
current passing through the tissue
• Skin burns may be seen at the entry and exit site of the current
• Muscle damage can be severe with minimal skin injury
• Cardiac damage may occur and rhabdomyolysis can l renal failure
• Refer all patients for specialist management

1116

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Poisoning or overdose
On receiving the call for assistance
• Try to establish what has happened—substances involved, ongoing
dangers, state of the patient
• Advise the caller to stay with the patient until you arrive
• If the patient is unconscious, immediately arrange for an ambulance to
attend, then visit
• Arrange for the patient to be removed from any source of danger,
e.g. contaminated clothing or inhaled gases. DO NOT put yourself or
anyone else in danger attempting to do this. If necessary call the fire
brigade, who have protective clothing and equipment, to help remove
a patient from a dangerous environment

Assessment of the unconscious patient
Assess the need for basic life support
• Airway patent?
• Breathing satisfactory?
• Circulation adequate?
Resuscitation (b p. 1116) takes priority over everything else.
Additionally
• If breathing is depressed and opioid overdose is a possibility, give
naloxone 0.4–2mg IV every 2–3min to a maximum of 10mg (child—10
micrograms/kg and then, if no response, 100 micrograms/kg)
• Check BM—if low, give 50–250mL 10% glucose IV in 50mL aliquots
General examination
• BP
• Pulse
• Temperature
• Level of coma (b p. 1068)

• Pupil responses
• Evidence of IV drug abuse
• Obvious injury

0 The coma may not be due to poisoning/overdose.
If unconscious, turn into the recovery position b p. 1071. Check no
contraindications first, e.g. spinal injury.
Note down any information about the exposure
• Product name As much detail as possible—if unidentified tablets, see
if any are left and send them to the hospital in their own container (if
there is one) with the patient
• Time of the incident
• Duration of exposure/amount ingested
• Route of exposure Swallowed, inhaled, injected, etc.
• Whether intentional or accidental
• Take a general history from any attendant Medical history, current
medication, substance abuse, alcohol, social circumstances

Assessment of the conscious patient
• Note down any information about the exposure as for the
unconscious patient
• Record symptoms the patient is experiencing as a result of exposure

Poisoning or overdose

• Examine—pulse, BP, temperature (if necessary), level of consciousness
or confusion, evidence of IV drug abuse, any injuries
• If non-accidental exposure assess suicidal intent (b p. 1119)
• Take a general history from the patient and/or any attendant—medical
history, current medication, substance abuse, alcohol, social circumstances
Consider admission if
• The patient’s clinical condition warrants it: unconsciousness,
respiratory depression, etc.
• The exposure warrants admission for treatment or observation:
• Symptomatic poisoning Admit to hospital
• Agents with delayed action Aspirin, iron, paracetamol, tricyclic
antidepressants, co-phenotrope, paraquat, and modified-release
preparations. Admit to hospital even if the patient seems well
• Other agents Consult poisons information
•	You judge there is serious suicidal intent (b p. 1119) or the
patient has another mental health condition which warrants acute
admission
• There is a lack of social support

Overdose and poisoning in children Peak incidence of

accidental poisoning is at 2y—mainly household substances, prescribed or OTC drugs, or plants. Teenagers may take deliberate
overdoses—especially of OTC medication, e.g. paracetamol.
• Poisoning can be a form of non-accidental injury (b p. 924).

Deliberate self-harm (DSH) Deliberate non-fatal act committed in the knowledge that it was potentially harmful and, in the case of
drug overdose, that the amount taken was excessive. 90% DSH is due
to self-poisoning and it accounts for 20% of admissions to general medical wards—the most frequent reason for admission for young 5 patients.
Paracetamol or aspirin are the most common drugs used. Self-harm is
often aimed at changing a situation (e.g. to get a boyfriend back), communication of distress (‘cry for help’), a sign of emotional distress, or may
be a failed genuine suicide attempt.
Management b p. 1118
0 People who have self-harmed should be treated with the same care
respect and privacy as any other patient.

threatening suicide or if relatives are worried about suicide risk are common primary care emergencies.
• Assessment See Figure 29.20
• Management See Figure 29.19

Compulsory admission b p. 1122
Suicide prevention In the UK, 1 in 5,600 4 and 1 in 18,000 5 commits
suicide. Suicide risk can be d by:
• Early recognition, assessment, and treatment of those likely to attempt
suicide—many visit their GP just weeks before suicide
• Planning follow-up care for those discharged from psychiatric hospitals
• d availability and lethality of suicide methods, e.g. avoid TCAs and
carefully monitor antidepressant repeat prescriptions
Assess suicide risk
(see Figure 29.20)
High risk of suicide
• Direct statement of intent
• Severe mood change
• Hopelessness
• Alcohol or drug dependence
• Abnormal personality
• Living alone
Admit as a psychiatric emergency
using the Mental Health Act for
compulsory admission (b p. 1122)
if voluntary admission is declined.

Lower risk of suicide

Arrange for someone to stay with the
patient until follow-up. Remove all
potentially harmful drugs. Liaise with
the mental health services according to
the individual patient about mental
health follow-up.

1 Mothers of young children who deliberately self-harm/attempt suicide have
i risk of child abuse. Assess risks, offer support, arrange for health visitor, or
social services to visit.

Suicide and attempted suicide

If any self-harm Assess the situation and admit to A&E as needed
Ask about suicidal ideas and plans in a sensitive but probing way. It is a common
misconception that asking about suicide can plant the idea into a patient’s head
and make suicide more likely. Evidence is to the contrary
Ask about present circumstances
What problems are making the patient feel this way?
Does he/she still feel like this?
Would the act of suicide be aimed to hurt someone in particular?
What kind of support does the patient have from friends, relatives, and formal
services (e.g. community mental health services)?
Assess suicidal risk Ask patient and any relatives/friends present. Risk factors:
• Peak age 35–49y
•4>5
• History of deliberate self-harm (100x i risk)
• Social isolation
• Alcohol or substance abuse
• Depression
• Schizophrenia
• Personality disorder
• Contact with the criminal justice system
• Serious illness (e.g. cancer)
• Divorced > widowed > never married > married
• Certain professions: vets, pharmacists, farmers, doctors
• Admission or recent discharge from psychiatric hospital
Assess mental health Features associated with i suicide risk are:
• Depression
• Agitation
• Presence of suicidal ideation
• Hopelessness—good predictor of subsequent and immediate risk
• Early schizophrenia with retained insight—especially young patients who
see their ambitions restricted
• Presence of delusions of control, poverty, and/or guilt
Useful questions for assessing suicidal ideas and plans
• Do you feel you have a future?
• Do you feel that life’s not worth living?
• Do you ever feel completely hopeless?
• Do you ever feel you’d be better off dead and away from it all?
• Have you ever made any plans to end your life (if drug overdose—have you
handled the tablets)?
• Have you ever made an attempt to take your own life? If so, was there a
final act, e.g suicide note?
• What prevents you doing it?
• Have you made any arrangements for your affairs after your death?

Emergencies in general practice

Disturbed behaviour
• Look after your own safety

• If the patient is known to be violent, get back-up from the police
before entering the situation
• Tell someone you are going in and when to expect an ‘exit’ call.
Advise them to call for help if that call is not made
• Do not put yourself in a vulnerable situation—sit where there is a
clear, unimpeded exit route
• Do not make the patient feel trapped
• Do not try to restrain the patient

Acute hyperventilation/panic attack
Features Fear, terror, and feeling of impending doom accompanied by
some or all of the following:
• Sweating
• Dizziness
• Palpitations
• Carpopedal
• Paraesthesiae
• Shortness of breath
spasm
• Chest pain/discomfort
• Choking sensation
Differential diagnosis
• Dysrhythmia
• Asthma
• Anaphylaxis

• Thyrotoxicosis
• Temporal lobe
epilepsy

• Hypoglycaemia
• Phaeochromocytoma
(very rare)

Action
• Talking down Explain the nature of the symptoms to the patient:
• Racing of the heart is due to adrenaline produced by the panic
• Paraesthesiae/feelings of dizziness are secondary to overbreathing
due to panic
• Count breaths in and out gently slowing breathing rate
• Rebreathing techniques
• Place a paper bag over the patient’s mouth, and ask him/her to
breathe in and out through the mouth
• A connected but not switched on O2 mask or nebulizer mask is
an alternative in the surgery
• This raises the partial pressure of CO2 in the blood and symptoms
due to low CO2 (e.g. tetany, paraesthesiae, dizziness) resolve and
also demonstrates the link between hyperventilation and symptoms
• Propranolol 10–20mg stat may be helpful—DO NOT USE for
asthmatics or patients with heart failure or on verapamil
Recurrent panic attacks b p. 994

Violent or agitated behaviour When a patient becomes very agitated or violent or starts to behave oddly, the GP is usually called—by the
patient, relatives or friends, or police attending the disturbance.
Causes of disturbed behaviour
• Physical illness causing acute delirium Infection (e.g. UTI, chest
infection); hypoglycaemia; hypoxia; head injury; epilepsy—b p. 1010

Disturbed behaviour

• Drugs Alcohol (or alcohol withdrawal); prescribed drugs (e.g. steroid
psychosis); illicit drugs (e.g. amphetamines)
• Mental health problems Schizophrenia; mania; anxiety/depression;
dementia; personality disorder (e.g. attention-seeking; uncontrolled
anger)
Assessment
• Before seeing the patient gather as much information as possible
from notes, relatives—even neighbours
• Ask the patient and family for any history of drugs or alcohol excess
• Listen to the patient and talk calmly—choose your words carefully
• Try to look for organic causes—this can be difficult in the heat of
the moment—physical examination except from a distance may be
impossible. Do not put yourself at risk
• Suspect an organic cause where there are visual hallucinations
• Discuss and explain your suggested management with the patient
and any attendants
• If the patient is an immediate danger to himself or others, admission
is warranted
• If the cause of the behaviour is unclear, admission for investigation is
needed
• Instigate management of treatable causes identified, e.g. admit if
acute coronary syndrome or stroke is suspected; treat UTI or chest
infection
• Consider sedation to cover the period before admission or to
alleviate symptoms if admission is inappropriate
Acute management After assessing the problem, decide if hospitalization is
required and whether this can be done on a voluntary or involuntary basis.
Suitable drugs to use for sedation
• Oral Diazepam 5–10mg po or lorazepam 1mg po/sublingually;
chlorpromazine 25mg po (lower dose if elderly)
• Intramuscular Lorazepam 1.5–2.5mg; chlorpromazine 25mg;
haloperidol 1–3mg

• Avoid sedating patients with COPD, epilepsy, or if the patient has been
taking illicit drugs, barbiturates, or alcohol.

Compulsory admission under the Mental health Act b p. 1122

• Acute dystonia Can occur soon after giving phenothiazines or

butyophenones. Signs:
• Torticollis
• Grimacing
• Tongue protrusion
• Opisthotonus
Dystonia can be relieved with IM procyclidine 5–10mg (repeated prn
after 20min to a maximum dose of 20mg).

Emergencies in general practice

Compulsory admission and treatment
of patients with mental illness
Most requiring inpatient care for mental disorder agree to hospital admission and become ‘informal’ patients. A minority (75%) require compulsory
admission and detention under the Mental Health Act of 2007* and are
termed ‘sectioned’—in reference to the Section of the Mental Health Act
under which they are detained (see Figure 29.21).

Procedure for ‘sectioning’ a patient
Applications can be made for
• Admission for assessment under Section 2 (b p. 1125)
• Admission for treatment under Section 3 (b p. 1125)
• Emergency admission under Section 4 (b p. 1125)
• Guardianship under Section 7 (b p. 1125)
Applications can be made by
• An approved mental health professional (AMHP)
• The nearest relative of the person concerned. Nearest relative is
defined in the Act as the 1st surviving person out of:
• Spouse (or cohabitee for >6mo)
• Oldest child (if >18y)
• Parent
• Oldest sibling (if >18y)
• Grandparent
• Grandchild (>18y)
• Uncle or aunt (>18y)
• Nephew or niece (>18y)
• Non-relative living with patient for ≥5y
The applicant (AMHP or nearest relative) must have seen the patient
<2wk (<24h in the case of Section 4) before the date of the application.
0 The AMHP should be chosen rather than the nearest relative wherever possible, to avoid affecting family relationships.
Applications must be based on
• Two medical recommendations (except Section 4 which only needs
one). Clinicians may examine the patient together or separately, but
there must be <6d between examinations. Recommendations must be
signed on or before the date of application
• Where two medical recommendations are required, the clinicians
should not be from the same hospital or practice and one of the
clinicians must be ‘approved’ under the Mental Health Act
• One clinician, if practicable, must have prior knowledge of the patient
(ideally a GP—but GPs are not obliged to attend outside the practice
area). If neither clinician has prior knowledge of the patient, the
applicant must state on the application why this was so
• Medical recommendation(s) and application must concur on at least
one form of mental disorder
*
Applies in England and Wales only. In Northern Ireland, similar provisions apply under the Mental
Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. Scotland—see b p. 1124.

* Personality disorder characterized by inability to make loving relationships,

In practice ‘sectioning’ means calling in the duty social worker (or other
social services approved mental health professional) and duty psychiatrist. It can be a time-consuming and frustrating business. Always try to
obtain voluntary admission—it is better for you and the patient.
Keep a supply of forms you might need for sectioning—Forms 3, 7, and
10 (GP recommendation for Section 2, 4, and 3, respectively) and Form
5 (application for Section 4 for a ‘nearest relative’).
Deputizing doctors should always try to contact the patient’s own GP.
Figure 29.21 Deciding whether a ‘section’ is needed
0 The Mental Health Act only allows for compulsory assessment and
treatment of a patient’s mental health problems—the patient may refuse
consent for investigation and/or treatment of other health problems
whilst ‘sectioned’.

chapter 29

Emergencies in general practice

Sections of the Mental Health Act relevant to GPs See
Table 29.8.

Section 115 Allows an approved mental health professional to enter

and inspect any premises (except hospital) in which a person with a mental
disorder is living if he/she has reasonable cause to believe that person is
not under proper care. Application through a magistrate is needed.

Section 135 Gives right of entry of a police officer who believes

a person with a mental disorder is being ill-treated or suffering from
self-neglect to enter premises and remove that person to a place of safety.
The police officer who attends must be accompanied by an approved
mental health professional and approved clinician unless the person is
already ‘sectioned’ and absent without leave. Requires application to a
magistrate.

Mental Health Community Act (1995) This Act aims to ‘provide

a system of supervision of care in the community of certain patients who
have been detained in hospital’. In England and Wales, the responsible
medical officer applies for ‘after care under supervision’ (ACUS) to the
responsible health authority 6-monthly for the first year then yearly.
Application can only be made in respect of a patient (≥16y old) currently
liable to be detained in hospital due to a mental disorder where:
• There could be serious risk of harm to the patient or others if the
patient were not to receive further care services, and
• Supervision would help to ensure receipt of further care services
If patients refuse treatment, they cannot be treated against their will but
can be conveyed to a day centre or hospital.

Scotland The Mental Health Act (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) 2003

provides for compulsory admission under Part 5 for 72h. The application
is made by a fully registered medical practitioner in consultation with a
mental health officer, unless this is impracticable. In hospital Part 6 (lasting
28d) can be applied and then, if necessary, Part 7 (Compulsory Treatment
Order) for 6mo.

Emergencies in general practice

Miscellaneous emergencies
Acute limb ischaemia
Causes
• Acute thrombotic occlusion of pre-existing stenotic segment (60%)
• Embolus (30%)
• Trauma, e.g. compartment syndrome or traumatic vessel damage
Presentation
• Pain
• Pallor
• Paraesthesiae

• Pulselessness
• Paralysis
• Perishing cold

Action Admit acutely under the care of a vascular surgeon. Treatment
can be surgical (e.g. embolectomy) or medical (e.g. thrombolysis).

Drowning Most common in drunk adults and children poorly supervised around water. Children can drown in a few centimetres of water.
Action
• Call for help
• Start basic life support (Airway, Breathing, Circulation)—b p. 1054
(adults); b p. 1060 (children)

• Attempted resuscitation of a seemingly dead child is worthwhile as cooling d metabolic rate and recovery can occur after prolonged immersion.
Prevention Drowning is the third most common cause of accidental death
among the under 16s. More than half of those who drown can swim. Most people
drown in rivers (25%) or the sea (17%) but for children <4y garden ponds are
the most common place of drowning. For adults, alcohol is a contributory factor
in 25–50% cases. The best way to d drowning is prevention—spot the dangers;
take safety advice; do not go near water alone; learn how to help others.

Hypothermia Defined as a core temperature of <35°C.
Causes
• Not feeling the cold, e.g. neuropathy, confusion, dementia
• Inadequate heat in the home, e.g. poor housing, poverty, and fear of
high fuel bill
• Immobility
•	 DM
• Hypothyroidism
• Alcohol
• i heat loss, e.g. psoriasis, erythroderma
• Inadequate protection from the cold, e.g. unsuitable clothing whilst
doing outdoor sports
• Drugs—antipsychotics, antidepressants, barbiturates, tranquillizers—
may lower the level of consciousness and d ability to shiver
• Falls—may remain still and cold on the floor until discovered
•	Unconsciousness, e.g. overdose, stroke

Miscellaneous emergencies

Presentation Skin pale and cold to touch; puffy face; listlessness,
drowsiness, and/or confusion.
When severe d breathing—slow and shallow; d pulse volume—faint and
irregular; stiff muscles; loss of consciousness.
Investigation
• Rectal temperature on low-reading thermometer <35°C
• ECG—‘J’ wave on the end of the QRS complex
Action
• Remove from the cold environment
• Wrap in blankets—including head
• Do not use direct heat (e.g. hot water bottles), as this can cause rapid
fluid shifts and potentially fatal pulmonary oedema
• Transfer to hospital
• Consider the cause of the incident; liaise with the hospital, primary
healthcare team, and social services to prevent recurrence

Heat stroke and heat exhaustion Exercising in excessive heat leads
to dehydration, salt depletion, and metabolite accumulation.
Signs Headache, nausea, confusion, incoordination, cramps, weakness,
dizziness, malaise.
Treatment Rest, fluid and salt replacement. Admit for IV fluids and
supportive measures in severe cases.

Sunburn b p. 1115
Acute altitude sickness Altitude sickness is a potentially fatal compli-

cation of rapidly climbing to altitudes >2,500m (8,000 feet). 2 main forms:
pulmonary oedema and cerebral oedema. Presents with fatigue, headache,
dizziness, nausea/loss of appetite, breathlessness, palpitations, and/or insomnia. Treatment is with oxygen therapy and descent to a lower altitude.
Prevent by gradual ascent. Use of prophylactic acetazolamide is controversial.

Wound dehiscence Breakdown of a surgical wound—usually abdominal. May be partial or complete.
• Partial breakdown Skin remains intact but muscle layers break
down l incisional hernia. Typically the patient feels something
‘give’ ± sudden i in pain and pink fluid discharge. Refer for urgent
reassessment by the operating surgeon
• Complete dehiscence Wound breaks down entirely. The patient becomes
shocked and distressed. Lie flat; give strong opioid analgesia; cover the
wound with a sterile pack soaked in saline; admit as a ‘999’ emergency
Risk factors
• Malnutrition
• Obesity
• i intra-abdominal pressure, e.g.
from coughing

• Wound infection
• Haematoma formation
• Ascites draining through
a wound

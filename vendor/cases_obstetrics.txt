PREFACE
Learning in medicine has gradually moved away from an apprentice system to a more
structured course format. Advances have been made with the use of simulated cases,
problem-based learning and electronic learning resources; however, this has led to a
separation of the learning environment from the clinical art of real medicine.
This book aims to redress the balance with entirely clinical cases, highlighting the history
and examination features with salient investigations. This allows the reader to place
themselves in the position of the practising doctor encountering these scenarios in the
everyday clinical setting.
Obstetrics and gynaecology involves the same clinical reasoning as other specialties
covered in this series, but several points should be highlighted. First most patients seen in
obstetrics and gynaecology are generally fit and healthy. As such they will withstand
cardiovascular insults such as haemorrhage very effectively by increasing cardiac output.
Signs of tachycardia and hypovolaemia may be late and signify severe compromise.
Second, there are many physiological changes in pregnancy and normal ranges therefore
alter. Where indicated, normal values for pregnant and non-pregnant women have been
included. Finally, many abnormalities in obstetrics and gynaecology are picked up during
‘routine’ care. This book therefore differs from those of Clinical Medicine and Surgery in
that women do not always ‘present’ with a problem, but one may be detected through,
for example, routine antenatal care or during a cervical smear investigation.
The cases are grouped into broad categories with random ordering of cases within each
category to mimic the way cases present in clinical practice.
We have written this book with both clinicians and medical students in mind, with cases
varying in complexity, to reinforce common or important subject areas. We hope they will
stimulate and challenge as well as build confidence for those working in or learning
obstetrics and gynaecology.

GENERAL GYNAECOLOGY
CASE 1:

INTERMENSTRUAL BLEEDING

History
A 48-year-old woman presents with intermenstrual bleeding for 2 months. Episodes of
bleeding occur any time in the cycle. This is usually fresh red blood and much lighter than
a normal period. It can last for 1–6 days. There is no associated pain. She has no hot
flushes or night sweats. She is sexually active and has not noticed vaginal dryness.
She has three children and has used the progesterone only pill for contraception for 5 years.
Her last smear test was 2 years ago and all smears have been normal. She takes no medication and has no other relevant medical history.

Examination
The abdomen is unremarkable. Speculum examination shows a slightly atrophic-looking
vagina and cervix but there are no apparent cervical lesions and there is no current bleeding.
On bimanual examination the uterus is non-tender and of normal size, axial and mobile.
There are no adnexal masses.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 1
The diagnosis is of an endometrial polyp, as shown by the hydrosonography image (Fig.
1.1). These can occur in women of any age although they are more common in older
women and may be asymptomatic or cause irregular bleeding or discharge. The aetiology
is uncertain and the vast majority are benign. In this specific case all the differential diagnoses are effectively excluded by the history and examination.

Management
Any woman should be investigated if bleeding occurs between periods. In women over the
age of 40 years, serious pathology, in particular endometrial carcinoma, should be excluded.
The polyp needs to be removed for two reasons:
1 to eliminate the cause of the bleeding
2 to obtain a histological report to ensure that it is not malignant.
Management involves outpatient or day case hysteroscopy, and resection of the polyp
under direct vision using a diathermy loop or other resection technique (Fig. 1.2). This
allows certainty that the polyp had been completely excised and also allows full inspection of the rest of the cavity to check for any other lesions or suspicious areas. In some
settings, where hysteroscopic facilities are not available, a dilatation and curettage may
be carried out with blind avulsion of the polyp with polyp forceps. This was the standard
management in the past but is not the gold standard now, for the reasons explained.

KEY POINTS

• Any woman over the age of 40 years should be investigated if bleeding occurs between
the periods, to exclude serious pathology, in particular endometrial carcinoma.

• Hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage is rarely indicated for women under the age
of 40 years.

CASE 2:

INFERTILITY

History
A 31-year-old woman has been trying to conceive for nearly 3 years without success. Her
last period started 7 months ago and she has been having periods sporadically for about
5 years. She bleeds for 2–7 days and the periods occur with an interval of 2–9 months.
There is no dysmenorrhoea but occasionally the bleeding is heavy.
She was pregnant once before at the age of 19 years and had a termination of pregnancy.
She had a laparoscopy several years ago for pelvic pain, which showed a normal pelvis.
Cervical smears have always been normal and there is no history of sexually transmitted
infection.
The woman was diagnosed with irritable bowel syndrome when she was 25, after thorough investigation for other bowel conditions. She currently uses metoclopramide to
increase gut motility, and antispasmodics.
Her partner is fit and well, and has two children by a previous relationship. Neither partner drinks alcohol or smokes.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 2
The infertility is secondary to anovulation as shown by the day 21 progesterone
(⬎30 nmol/L suggests ovulation has occurred). Normal testosterone and gonadotrophins
and high prolactin suggest the likely case of anovulation is hyperprolactinaemia.
Hyperprolactinaemia may be physiological in breast-feeding, pregnancy and stress. The
commonest causes of pathological hyperprolactinaemia are tumours and idiopathic
hypersecretion, but it may also be due to drugs, hypothyroidism, ectopic prolactin secretion
or chronic renal failure. In this case the metoclopramide is the cause, as it is a dopamine
antagonist (dopamine usually acts via the hypothalamus to cause inhibition of prolactin
secretion, and if this is interrupted, prolactin is excreted to excess). Galactorrhoea is not a
common symptom of hyperprolactinaemia, occurring in less than half of affected women.

Metoclopramide
Phenothiazines (e.g. chlorpromazine, prochlorperazine, thioridazine)
Reserpine
Methyldopa
Omeprazole, ranitidine, bendrofluazide (rare associations)

The metoclopramide should be stopped and the woman reviewed after 4–6 weeks to
ensure that the periods have restarted and that the prolactin level has returned to normal.
If this does not occur, then further investigation is needed to exclude other causes of
hyperprolactinaemia such as a pituitary micro- or macro-adenoma. It would be advisable
to repeat the day 21 progesterone level to confirm ovulatory cycles. The woman should
have her rubella immunity checked and should be advised to take preconceptual folic acid
until 12 weeks of pregnancy.
If the woman fails to conceive then a full fertility investigation should be planned with
semen analysis and tubal patency testing (hysterosalpingogram or laparoscopy and dye
test).
KEY POINTS

• A full drug history should be elicited in women with amenorrhoea or infertility.
• Galactorrhoea occurs in less than half of women with hyperprolactinaemia.
• Day 21 progesterone over 30 nmol/L is suggestive of ovulation.

CASE 3:

AMENORRHOEA

History
A 32-year-old woman complains that she has not had a period for 3 months. Four home
pregnancy tests have all been negative. She started her periods at the age of 15 years and
until 30 years she had a normal 27-day cycle. She had one daughter by normal delivery
2 years ago, following which she breast-fed for 6 months. After that she had normal
cycles again for several months and then her periods stopped abruptly. She was using the
progesterone only pill for contraception while she was breast-feeding and stopped 6
months ago as she is keen to have another child. She reports symptoms of dryness during
intercourse and has experienced sweating episodes at night as well as episodes of feeling
extremely hot at any time of day. There is no relevant gynaecological history. The only
medical history of note is that she has been hypothyroid for 10 years and takes thyroxine
100 μg per day. She does not take any alcohol, smoke or use recreational drugs.

Questions

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 3
This woman has symptoms of amenorrhoea as well as hypo-oestrogenic vasomotor symptoms and vaginal dryness. The diagnosis is of premature menopause, confirmed by the
very high gonadotrophin levels. High levels occur because the ovary is resistant to the
effects of gonadotrophins, and negative feedback to the hypothalamus and pituitary
causes increasing secretion to try and stimulate the ovary. Sheehan’s syndrome (pituitary
necrosis after postpartum haemorrhage) would also cause amenorrhoea but would have
inhibited breast-feeding and all menstruation since delivery.
Premature menopause (before the age of 40 years) occurs in 1 per cent of women and has
significant physical and psychological consequences. It may be idiopathic but a familial
tendency is common. In some cases it is an autoimmune condition (associated with
hypothyroidism in this case). Disorders of the X chromosome can also be associated.

!

Effects of premature menopause

• Hypo-oestrogenic effects:
• vaginal dryness
• vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes, night sweats)
• osteoporosis
• increased cardiovascular risk
• Psychological and social effects:
• infertility
• feeling of inadequacy as a woman
• feelings of premature ageing and need to take hormone-replacement therapy (HRT)
• impact on relationships
Further investigations
Repeat gonadotrophin level is required to confirm the result and exclude a midcycle
gonadotrophin surge or fluctuating gonadotrophins. Bone scan is necessary for baseline bone
density and to help in monitoring the effects of hormone replacement. Chromosomal analysis identifies the rare cases of premature menopause due to fragile X syndrome or Turner’s
syndrome mosaicism.
Management
Osteoporosis may be prevented with oestrogen replacement, with progesterone protection
of the uterus. Traditional HRT preparations or the combined oral contraceptive pill are
effective, the latter making women feel more ‘normal’, with a monthly withdrawal bleed
and a ‘young person’s’ medication.
Her options are adoption, accepting childlessness and in vitro fertilization (IVF) with
donor oocytes.
Occasionally premature menopause is a fluctuating condition (resistant ovary syndrome)
whereby the ovaries may function intermittently. Contraception should therefore be used
if it would be undesirable to become pregnant.
Patient support organizations are a good source for women experiencing such an unexpected and stigmatizing diagnosis.
KEY POINTS

• Premature menopause (⬍40 years) occurs in 1 per cent of women.
• Oestrogen replacement is essential for bone and cardiovascular protection.
• It may be possible to conceive with IVF using donor oocytes.

CASE 4:

INFERTILITY

History
A 29-year-old woman and her partner are seen in the gynaecology outpatient clinic with
primary infertility. They stopped using condoms 2 years ago and have had regular intercourse since then. The partner has no previous medical history of note. He drinks approximately 8 units of alcohol per week and does not smoke. He works as a manager in a hotel.
The woman also has no specific previous medical history except for an appendectomy
aged 12 years. Her periods occur every 31 to 46 days and can be heavy at times but not
painful. There is no intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding. She has always had normal
smears and has never had any sexually transmitted infections. She takes no medications,
drinks approximately 6 units of alcohol per week and does not smoke.

Examination
On examination her body mass index (BMI) is 29 kg/m2. She has slight acne on her face
and her chest.
There are no abdominal scars and the abdomen is non-tender with no masses palpable.
Speculum and bimanual examination are normal.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this woman?
7

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 4
The diagnosis is of anovulatory infertility due to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS).
Anovulation is shown by the progesterone level below 30 nmol/L, and PCOS is suggested
by several features including increased BMI, acne, oligomenorrhoea, polycystic ovaries on
transvaginal ultrasound examination, increased androgen levels and increased LH.
‘Polycystic ovaries’ (a morphological description of enlarged ovaries with an increased
number of follicles and dense stroma) is present in up to 25 per cent of normal women.
The diagnosis of PCOS is made on any combination of characteristic clinical, biochemical
and ultrasound features.
PCOS is one of the commonest causes of infertility. However, up to 30 per cent of subfertile couples have a multifactorial cause for their problem. Hence complete investigation
of both partners is essential prior to treating the PCOS. This includes:
• semen analysis
• tubal patency test (hysterosalpingogram is usually sufficient)
• laparoscopy and dye test if pelvic inflammatory disease, adhesions or endometriosis
are suggested from the history.
Testing for rubella is also necessary, as is a recommendation to take folic acid if this is not
already taken. Other general advice includes minimizing alcohol intake, avoiding smoking and ensuring regular intercourse (preferably 2–3 times per week). The woman should
aim to reduce weight as this commonly induces ovulation in high-BMI women with PCOS.

Treatment of anovulation
Clomifene citrate is the main treatment to induce ovulation. The woman should be given
50 mg to take on day 2–6 of the menstrual cycle, with day 21 progesterone checked to
confirm ovulation. If ovulation occurs, then the clomifene is continued for up to six cycles
unless pregnancy occurs. If ovulation is not confirmed then the dose is increased to
100 mg.
It is not recommended to take clomifene for more than 6 months, due to a theoretical
increased risk of ovarian carcinoma. If clomifene fails, then further ovulation induction
agents and IVF need to be considered.
KEY POINTS

• Irregular periods are commonly due to polycystic ovarian syndrome.
• The syndrome is diagnosed on a combination of clinical, biochemical and ultrasound
features.

• Many cases of subfertility are multifactorial or involve both partners, so full investigation
of both is important prior to treatment.

CASE 5:

INFERTILITY

History
A 37-year-old woman is seen in the clinic because of infertility. She is gravida 3 para 1
having had a daughter 13 years ago and a miscarriage 2 years later. She separated from
her former husband and has now married again and is keen to conceive, especially as her
new partner has no children.
Her last period started 45 days ago. She says that her periods are sometimes regular but at
other times she has missed a period for up to 3 months. The bleeding is moderate and lasts
up to 4 days. There is no history of pelvic pain or dyspareunia, and no irregular bleeding
or discharge. Alcohol intake is minimal and she does not smoke or take other drugs. There
is no medical history of note and she takes no regular medication.
Her partner is 34 years old and is also fit and healthy with no significant history of
ill-health or medications.

Examination
There are no abnormal features on examination of either partner.

morphology, volume and mobility. No follicles are noted.

Questions
• What is the cause of the infertility?
• What are the further investigation and management options?

9

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 5
Women with irregular periods often do not ovulate. Anovulation in this case is confirmed
by the low day 21 progesterone level. The commonest cause of anovulation is polycystic
ovaries, but in this case the ovaries show normal morphology and the androgen levels are
normal.
The noticeable abnormality is the high FSH level and the fact that no follicles are visualized at ultrasound scan. This is suggestive of anovulation from premature failure of ovarian function. The woman is not menopausal because she still has periods although
irregular, and the FSH is only marginally raised. However it is known that FSH levels
above 10 IU/L are associated with a poor prognosis for conception using the woman’s
own ova.

Further investigation.
The FSH should be repeated, as it is possible that this could be a sporadic result or poorly
timed sample, and therefore confirmation is needed before continuing on to treatment.
Management
As there is such a poor prognosis for conception either naturally or with in vitro fertilization using the woman’s own ova, she should be counselled about assisted conception
using donor eggs. Donated oocytes are fertilized with the partner’s sperm and then
implanted into the uterus. The woman needs appropriate luteal phase support, most commonly with progesterone pessaries.

!

Counselling issues for this couple

• Psychological:
• the woman may feel that her ovaries are ‘ageing’ prematurely and this may have
an affect on her self-esteem and sexuality

• the stress associated with assisted conception is significant and many couples
find that this in itself puts a large burden on their relationship.

• Funding: public funding may not be available as the woman already has one child.
• Consideration of alternative options: adoption, surrogacy and accepting
childlessness should be explored with the couple.

KEY POINTS

• FSH above 10 IU/L is associated with poor prognosis for fertility.
• Infertile couples should be encouraged to explore all options, including accepting
childlessness and adoption as well as assisted conception techniques.

CASE 6:

SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 72-year-old woman has been admitted with shortness of breath. On further questioning
she says she has been unwell for about 8 weeks. She has decreased appetite and nausea
when she eats. She has lost weight but her abdomen feels swollen. She has generalized
dull abdominal pain and constipation, which is unusual for her. There are no urinary
symptoms.
She has always been healthy with no previous hospital admissions. She is a widow and
did not have any children. Her periods stopped at 52 years and she has had no postmenopausal bleeding. She has never taken hormone-replacement therapy.

Examination
She appears pale and breathless on talking. Chest expansion is reduced on the right side,
with dullness to percussion and decreased air entry at the right base. The abdomen is generally distended with shifting dullness. There is a mass arising from the pelvis. Speculum
examination is normal, but on bimanual palpation there is a fixed left iliac fossa mass of
about 10 cm diameter.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How should this woman be further investigated?
• If the diagnosis is confirmed how should she be managed?

13

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 6
The history and examination are suggestive of a right pleural effusion and ascites. The
presence of a pelvic mass would suggest that this is due to an ovarian or bowel problem.
The chest X-ray confirms the effusion, and the CT shows a left-sided pelvic tumour and
ascites. There are also solid areas in the anterior abdominal wall that represent omental
infiltration by the tumour.
CA-125 is a non-specific marker for ovarian carcinoma. The diagnosis is therefore likely
to be that of ovarian cancer which commonly presents with systemic symptoms when
metastatic disease is already evident.

Confirmation of the diagnosis and management
The surgical aphorism ‘there is no diagnosis without a surgical diagnosis’ means that tissue needs to be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. Laparotomy should be performed with
three objectives:
1 obtaining tissue for diagnosis
2 staging the disease according to the extent of tissue involvement
3 primary debulking – to perform a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy and to reduce all abdominal tumour deposits to a volume of less than
2 cm. This allows optimal effect of chemotherapy following surgery. Lymph node dissection and omental resection are usually part of the procedure.
Prior to any treatment this woman also needs drainage of her pleural effusion for symptomatic relief and optimization for anaesthetic.
The prognosis for ovarian cancer is poor, as most women present at stage 3 or 4.

KEY POINTS

• CA-125 is a non-specific marker for ovarian cancer.
• Ovarian cancer commonly presents late (stage 3/4) and prognosis is poor.
• Staging and primary treatment is by laparotomy, total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral
salpingoophorectomy and debulking.

• Chemotherapy is often effective adjuvant therapy.

CASE 7:

ABDOMINAL SWELLING

History
A 36-year-old African-Caribbean woman has noticed abdominal swelling for 10 months.
She has to wear larger clothes and people have asked her if she is pregnant, which she
finds distressing having been trying to conceive. She has no abdominal pain and her
bowel habit is normal. She feels nauseated when she eats large amounts. She has urinary
frequency but no dysuria or haematuria.
Her periods are regular, every 27 days, and have always been heavy, with clots and flooding on the second and third days. She has never received any treatment for her heavy
periods.
She has been with her partner for 7 years and despite not using contraception she has
never been pregnant.

Examination
The woman has a very distended abdomen. A smooth firm mass is palpable extending
from the symphysis pubis to midway between the umbilicus and the xiphisternum (equivalent to a 32-week size pregnancy). It is non-tender and mobile. It is not fluctuant and it is
not possible to palpate beneath the mass. On speculum examination it is not possible to
visualize the cervix. Bimanual examination reveals a non-tender firm mass occupying the
pelvis.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 7
The woman has a large uterine fibroid (leiomyoma). This is causing menorrhagia and
hence the microcytic anaemia from iron deficiency. It is also likely that the fibroid is
accounting for her infertility history, although this warrants investigation as a separate
problem.
Fibroids are benign tumours of the myometrium which may be extrinsic (subserous) as in
this case. Alternatively they may be intramural or submucosal (projecting into the endometrial cavity).

!

Typical presentations of fibroids

•
•
•
•

Menorrhagia
Abdominal mass
Pressure effect from pressure on the bladder, stomach or bowel
Infertility

Fibroids are not typically painful unless they undergo degeneration, usually in pregnancy.
African-Caribbean women tend to develop fibroids more commonly than other ethnic
groups.

Further investigation
Ferritin and folate levels should be checked to confirm the iron-deficiency status. It is also
advisable to arrange renal function tests and a renal tract ultrasound, as very large
fibroids can cause ureteric obstruction and hydronephrosis, which would need urgent
treatment.
Management
The woman should be treated for her anaemia with ferrous sulphate. The menorrhagia can
be reduced with tranexamic acid during menstruation. Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
analogues temporarily shrink fibroids and cause amenorrhoea to allow correction of iron
deficiency. Definitive treatment for fibroids is traditionally by hysterectomy or myomectomy. Myomectomy is favourable for this woman who is keen to have a family, so conservation of the uterus is essential. Uterine artery embolization also causes fibroid
degeneration by interruption of the blood supply. However research into long-term safety
and potential effects on uterine function during pregnancy are not clear, and this option
is currently advised in the context of a research setting only.
KEY POINTS

• Fibroids may be small and incidental or occupy most of the abdomen.
• Anaemia should be suspected in any women with menorrhagia.
• Treatment of fibroids depends on the presence of symptoms and the necessity to
preserve fertility.

• The optimal operative approach depends on the size and location of the fibroids.

CASE 8:

ABNORMAL CERVICAL SMEAR

History
A 28-year-old woman attends the colposcopy clinic after an abnormal smear test. She is
very anxious as she thinks that she might have cervical cancer. The smear is reported as
‘severe dyskaryosis’. She had a previous normal result at age 25 years. She has not had any
postcoital or intermenstrual bleeding.
Her first sexual relationship started at the age of 14 years and she has had several partners since then. She lives with her current partner who she has been with for 3 years. She
was diagnosed with genital herpes several years ago but has not had any attacks for
at least 3 years. She smokes 15–20 cigarettes per day and drinks only at the weekends.
She has an intrauterine contraceptive device in situ.

Examination
The cervix is macroscopically normal. At colposcopy, acetic acid is applied and an irregular white area is apparent to the left of the os. Lugol’s iodine is applied and the same area
stains pale while the rest of the cervix stains dark brown. A biopsy is taken
INVESTIGATIONS
Cervical biopsy report: the sample received measures 4 mm ⫻ 2 mm and contains
enlarged cells with irregular nuclei consistent with CIN3.

Questions
• How should this patient be managed?

19

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 8
The colposcopy findings show an abnormal area on the left of the cervix. The abnormal
tissue stains white with acetic acid because abnormal cells have high-density nuclei which
take up the acetic acid more than normal cells. In contrast, abnormal cells have lower
glycogen content than normal cells and stain less well, remaining pale when iodine is
applied.
The diagnosis is of CIN3 (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia). This is a tissue diagnosis as
opposed to dyskaryosis which is an observation of cells from a smear. The degree of
dyskaryosis and CIN often correlate, but a dyskaryosis report is not a diagnosis.

Management
CIN needs to be treated to prevent progression over several years to cervical carcinoma.
The commonest treatment is large-loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ) –
removal of abnormal cervical tissue with a diathermy loop. Most women tolerate this
under local anaesthetic. The LLETZ sample needs to be examined histologically both to
confirm removal of all the abnormal tissue, and to ensure that there is not a focus of carcinoma within the sample.
Follow-up smear should be performed in 6 months, and thereafter yearly smears for
10 years.

!

Advice after LLETZ procedure

• The patient may have light bleeding for several days.
• If heavy bleeding occurs she should return as secondary infection may occur and
need treatment.

• She should avoid sexual intercourse and tampon use for 4 weeks, to allow healing
of the cervix.

• Fertility is generally unaffected by the procedure, though cervical stenosis leading
to infertility has been reported, and mid-trimester loss from cervical weakness
is rare.

KEY POINTS

• Dyskariosis refers to abnormality from a smear.
• Dysplasia or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia are histological terms from a biopsy
sample.

• CIN should be treated to prevent long-term progression to cervical carcinoma.
• LLETZ is the usual treatment for CIN, with yearly follow-up for 10 years.

ANAEMIA

History
A 39-year-old woman is referred from the haematologist, with anaemia. She had been
complaining of increasing tiredness and shortness of breath for 3 months, with frequent
headaches.
Her periods occur every 24 days and the first day is generally moderate but the second to
fourth days are very heavy. She uses tampons and sanitary towels together. She has no
pain. Her last smear test was normal 2 years ago. She had no previous gynaecological
problems and takes no medication.

• How would you manage this woman?

21

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 9
The blood count shows anaemia with reduced mean cell corpuscular volume and low
mean cell haemoglobin suggestive of a microcytic anaemia. Iron deficiency is the commonest cause for this picture and is confirmed by the low ferritin and iron, with raised
iron-binding capacity. The anaemia accounts for the breathlessness, tiredness and
headaches.
Menorrhagia is the commonest cause of anaemia in women, and in this case is supported
by the history of excessive bleeding. The woman herself may not recognize that her
periods are particularly heavy if she has always experienced heavy periods or if she thinks
it is normal for periods to become heavier as she gets older.
As no other cause of heavy bleeding is apparent from the history and the ultrasound is
normal, then the underlying diagnosis is one of exclusion referred to as dysfunctional
uterine bleeding (DUB).

!

Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
Excessive heavy, prolonged or frequent bleeding that is not due to pregnancy or any
recognizable pelvic or systemic disease

Management
The anaemia should be treated with ferrous sulphate 200 mg twice daily until haemoglobin
and ferritin are normal. It may take 3–6 months for iron stores to be fully replenished.
Tranexamic acid (an antifibrinolytic) should be given during menstruation to reduce the
amount of bleeding. It is contraindicated with a history of thromboembolic disease.
The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is used for its action on the endometrium
to reduce menorrhagia, often causing amenorrhoea, though it is commonly associated
with irregular bleeding for the first 3 months. The combined oral contraceptive pill is
effective for menorrhagia in young women (below 35 years).
If these first-line management options are ineffective then endometrial ablation should be
considered, which destroys the endometrium down to the basal layer. It is successful in
80–85 per cent of women and they should have completed their family and use effective
contraception.
Hysterectomy is considered a ‘last resort’ for DUB, due to the associated morbidity.
KEY POINTS

• A woman’s perception of bleeding is not always proportionate to the actual volume lost,
so haemoglobin should be checked in any woman suspected of menorrhagia.

• DUB is a diagnosis of exclusion.
• A hierarchy of first-, second- and third-line treatment should be used in management.

CASE 10:

ABSENT PERIODS

History
A 24-year-old woman presents with the absence of periods for 9 months. She started her
periods at the age of 13 years and had a regular 28-day cycle until 18 months ago. The
periods then became irregular, occurring every 2–3 months until they stopped completely.
She has also had headaches for the last few months and is not sure if this is related. She
has a regular sexual partner and uses condoms for contraception. She has never been
pregnant. There is no previous medical history of note.
She works as a primary school teacher and drinks approximately 4 units of alcohol per
week. She does not smoke or use recreational drugs. She jogs and swims in her spare time.

Examination
The woman is of average build. The blood pressure and general observations are normal.

Questions

23

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 10
The investigations show a high-prolactin and a space-occupying lesion in the pituitary
fossa in the region of the anterior pituitary as detailed in Figure 10.2. This is consistent
with a pituitary adenoma (prolactinoma).

Figure 10.2 Arrow shows a small
asymmetrical enlargement of pituitary gland,
representative of a small pituitary adenoma
(prolactinoma).

Prolactin should always be measured in a woman with amenorrhoea. Care should be
taken in interpreting the results, as levels up to 1000 mu/L can be found as a result of
stress (even due to venepuncture), breast examination or in association with polycystic
ovarian syndrome). Above 1000 mu/L the usual cause is a pituitary adenoma (micro- or
macroscopic).

!

• Hypothalamic:
• chronic illness

• hypothyroidism
• breast-feeding
• Ovarian:
• polycystic ovarian syndrome
• premature ovarian failure
• iatrogenic (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, oophorectomy)
• long-acting progesterone contraception
• Uterine:
• pregnancy
• Asherman’s syndrome
• cervical stenosis
24

General gynaecology

Further investigation
Visual fields should be checked, as visual field defects may be present with a large tumour.
The other important investigation in any woman with amenorrhoea is a pregnancy test,
although with this history this would be very unlikely. (Prolactin is also raised in
pregnancy.)
Management
Most prolactinomas respond to medical treatment with bromocriptine or cabergoline.
Maintaining the prolactin level below 1000 mu/L causes menstruation (and ovulation) to
return in most women. This can be continued indefinitely or until pregnancy is achieved
if the presenting complaint is of infertility.

KEY POINTS

• Hyperprolactinaemia is a common cause of secondary amenorrhoea.
• Prolactin levels up to 1000 u/L may be due to non-pathological causes such as stress.
• Prolactinomas can usually be treated with medical suppression, and surgery is only
indicated rarely.

CASE 11:

POSTMENOPAUSAL BLEEDING

History
A 59-year-old woman awoke with blood on her nightdress, which was bright red but not
heavy. There were no clots of blood and there was no associated pain. The bleeding has
recurred twice since in similar amounts.
Her last period was at the age of 49 years and she has had no other intervening bleeding
episodes. She suffered hot flushes and night sweats around the time of her menopause,
which have now stopped. She is sexually active but has noticed vaginal dryness on intercourse recently.
She has always had normal cervical smears, the last one being 7 months ago. She had
two children by spontaneous vaginal delivery and had a laparoscopic sterilization aged
34 years. She has never used hormone-replacement therapy (HRT). She takes atenolol for
hypertension and omeprazole for epigastric pain.

Examination
She is slightly overweight. Abdominal examination is normal. The vulva and vagina
appear thin and atrophic and the cervix is normal. The uterus is small and anteverted and
with no palpable adnexal masses.
An outpatient endometrial biopsy is taken at the time of examination and sent for histological examination.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound scan is shown in Fig. 11.1.
Endometrial biopsy report: the specimen shows atrophic endometrium with no evidence of
inflammation, hyperplasia or malignancy.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

27

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 11
Postmenopausal bleeding is considered to be caused by endometrial cancer until proven
otherwise. However, only 10 per cent of women with postmenopausal bleeding are diagnosed with endometrial cancer.

!

Causes of postmenopausal bleeding

•
•
•
•
•
•

Endometrial cancer
Endometrial/endocervical polyp
Endometrial hyperplasia
Atrophic vaginitis
Iatrogenic (anticoagulants, intrauterine device, hormone-replacement therapy)
Infective (vaginal candidiasis)

In this case the endometrium is ⬍5 mm on ultrasound, which effectively excludes an endometrial malignancy or polyp. The normal endometrial biopsy report confirms the absence of
endometrial pathology. The smear history is normal, and the cervix appears normal,
excluding cervical cancer. She is not taking any medication that may predispose to abnormal bleeding.
The diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis can therefore be made by exclusion of serious causes,
and is backed up by the history of vaginal dryness at sexual intercourse and the atrophic
vulva and vagina noted on examination.

Management
Treatment is hormonal with a course of topical oestrogen given daily for 3 weeks and then
twice weekly for maintenance, for an initial period of 2-3 months. An alternative solution
is to give a combined form of systemic HRT to protect the endometrium.
Some women are reluctant to use HRT because of the associated risks, and therefore
advice should be given about vaginal lubricants which decrease discomfort but have no
reparative value. If bleeding recurs after treatment or the diagnosis is in doubt, then further investigation with hysteroscopy and dilatation and curettage is needed.

KEY POINTS

• Women with postmenopausal bleeding (PMB) should be considered to have
endometrial cancer until proven otherwise.

• Endometrial thickness, endometrial biopsy and hysteroscopy are used to investigate
PMB.

• Atrophic vaginitis can be treated with courses of topical oestrogens

CASE 12:

PAINFUL PERIODS

History
A 43-year-old woman is referred from her general practitioner (GP) with painful periods.
She says that her periods have always been quite heavy and painful but that in the last
2–3 years they have become almost unbearable. She bleeds every 24 days and the period
lasts for 7–9 days with very heavy flow from day 2 to day 6. The pain starts approximately
36 h before the onset of the bleeding and lasts until about day 5. The pain is constant, dull
and severe, such that she cannot do any housework or any social activities during this
time. Her GP has prescribed paracetamol and mefenamic acid in combination, which she
says ‘takes the edge off ’ but does not fully relieve the symptoms.
She has had four normal deliveries and her husband had a vasectomy several years ago.
There is no history of intermenstrual or postcoital discharge and she has no abnormal discharge. Her smear history is normal, the most recent being 18 months ago. She takes
citalopram for depression but currently reports her mood as fine. She does not drink alcohol or smoke.

Examination
The abdomen is soft and there is vague tenderness in the suprapubic area. The cervix
appears normal. On bimanual palpation the uterus is approximately 10 weeks size, soft
and bulky. She is tender on palpation but there is no cervical excitation, adnexal tenderness or adnexal masses.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound scan is shown in Fig. 12.1
Transvaginal ultrasound report: there is asymmetrical uterine enlargement, with a
thickened posterior uterine wall. There are ill-defined cystic spaces within the posterior
myometrial wall. There is an indistinct myometrial–endometrial border. Both ovaries
appear normal in size and morphology.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this woman?
29

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 12
The symptoms of dysmenorrhoea and menorrhagia and the ultrasound report suggest a diagnosis of adenomyosis. This is a benign condition whereby functioning endometrial glands
and stroma are found within the myometrium. With each period bleeding occurs from the
endometrial tissue into the smooth muscle, with associated pain. It tends to occur in
women over 35 years and risk factors include increased parity, termination and previous
Caesarean section. The condition may commonly be found in association with
endometriosis. Classically the diagnosis may only be made histologically after hysterectomy for dysmenorrhoea. More recently however the diagnosis can be suspected by ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

!

Causes of dysmenorrhoea

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Idiopathic
Premenstrual syndrome
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Endometriosis
Adenomyosis
Submucosal pedunculated fibroids
Iatrogenic (e.g. intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) or cervical stenosis after
large-loop excision of the transformation zone (LLETZ))

Further investigation
If the diagnosis is in doubt then an MRI scan may be requested. Hysterectomy to obtain
histological diagnosis would be inappropriate.
Management
The initial management involves analgesia such as mefenamic acid and codydramol.
Tranexamic acid reduces the amount of bleeding and this may secondarily reduce the
amount of pain. Suppression of menstruation with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone
analogues is a short-term measure. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device is
another option to locally suppress the endometrial tissue, and may resolve the pain.
As a last resort hysterectomy should be performed.
KEY POINTS

• The prevalence of adenomyosis is unknown, as diagnosis is only confirmed by
hysterectomy.

• It is a cause of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhoea in older women.
• Hysterectomy may be avoided by use of analgesia or hormonal suppression.

CASE 13:

POSTCOITAL BLEEDING

History
An 18-year-old woman is referred with postcoital bleeding. It has occurred on approximately seven occasions over the preceding 6 weeks. Generally it has been a small amount
of bright red blood noticed a few hours after intercourse and lasting up to 2 days. There
is no associated pain.
Her last menstrual period started 3 weeks ago and she bleeds for 4 days every 28 days. Her
periods were previously quite heavy but are now lighter since she started the combined
oral contraceptive pill (COCP) 6 months ago. There is no history of an abnormal discharge
or offensive odour and she has no dyspareunia.
She has had three sexual partners and has been with her current partner for 10 months.
She has never been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infection and has never had
a smear test. She had an appendectomy at the age of 7 years and was diagnosed with
epilepsy in childhood but has been off all medication for 8 years.

Examination
The abdomen is soft and non-tender. Speculum examination reveals a florid reddened
area symmetrically surrounding the external cervical os with contact bleeding. The uterus
is normal sized, anteverted and non-tender. There is no cervical excitation and the
adnexae are unremarkable.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• What further investigations would you perform for this woman?
• If your investigations are negative what is the likely diagnosis and how would you
manage the woman?

31

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 13
Postcoital bleeding in a young woman is common and normally benign. In this specific
case the examination findings are consistent only with cervical ectropion, malignancy or
infection.

!

Differential diagnoses of postcoital bleeding in a young woman

•
•
•
•
•

Cervical ectropion
Chlamydia or other sexually transmitted infection (STI)
Cervical malignancy
Complication of the COCP
Endocervical polyp

Investigations
An STI screen should be performed:
• endocervical swab for chlamydia
• endocervical swab for gonorrhoea
• high vaginal swab for trichomonas (and candida, not a STI, but possibly a cause of
irregular bleeding from vaginitis).
A cervical smear should also be taken to exclude cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or
malignancy prior to treatment.

Management
Assuming the swabs and smear are negative then the diagnosis is of cervical ectropion.
This is particularly common around the time of puberty, in women using the COCP, and
in pregnancy. It is not of clinical significance and is generally an incidental finding but
warrants treatment if it causes embarrassing and troublesome bleeding (or discharge in
some cases).
There are three options for treatment:
1 stop the COCP and use alternative contraception
2 cold coagulation of the cervix
3 diathermy ablation of the ectocervix.
KEY POINTS

• Cervical ectropion is very common and usually incidental and asymptomatic.
• It occurs particularly in pregnancy and with use of the COCP.
• Postcoital bleeding should always be investigated to exclude significant pathology.

RECURRENT MISCARRIAGE

History
A 34-year-old woman is referred from the emergency room with vaginal bleeding at
6 weeks and 5 days’ gestation. Bleeding started 2 days ago and was initially spotting but
has now increased so that she needs to change a sanitary towel regularly. There is a mild
dull lower abdominal pain.
She normally has regular 28-day cycle. In the past she has used the combined oral contraceptive pill but stopped 3 years ago when she and her partner decided to start a family.
She is gravida 3 para 0. Her first pregnancy ended in a complete miscarriage 2 years ago.
Five months ago she had a missed miscarriage at 9 weeks and required ERPC (evacuation
of retained products of conception).
There is no gynaecological history of note. Medically she is fit and healthy, except for
mild asthma for which she takes inhalers.
The woman’s mother died from a pulmonary embolism after her last child. Her brother
also had a deep venous thrombosis at the age of 29 years. Her sister has two children, both
born preterm because of severe pre-eclampsia.

Examination
The abdomen is non-distended but tender suprapubically. The cervical os is open and
products of conception are removed from the os and sent for histological examination.
The bleeding subsequently settles.

33

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 14
Raised anticardiolipin antibodies and lupus anticoagulant are suggestive of antiphospholipid syndrome.

!

Diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome

• The presence of one of the clinical features:
• three or more consecutive miscarriages
• mid-trimester fetal loss
• severe early-onset pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction or abruption
• arterial or venous thrombosis
• And haematological features:
• anticardiolipin antibody or lupus anticoagulant detected on two occasions at least
6 weeks apart

Thus in this case the diagnosis must be confirmed by a second positive anticardiolipin test
after at least 6 weeks. She should also be tested for antinuclear and anti-double-stranded
DNA antibodies as antiphospholipid syndrome is often secondary to systemic lupus
erythematosus (SLE).

Management
Oral low-dose aspirin and low-molecular-weight subcutaneous heparin from the time of a
positive pregnancy test should be given in subsequent pregnancies to improve the likelihood of a successful live birth.
Psychological support should be given with regular reassurance ultrasound scans in the
first trimester. There is evidence that shows repeated ultrasound scans for reassurance alone
improve the outcome after recurrent miscarriage.

!

Causes of recurrent miscarriage

• Parental chromosome abnormality (3–5 per cent, e.g. balanced chromosomal

abnormality)
Antiphospholipid syndrome
Other thrombophilia (e.g. activated protein C resistance)
Uterine abnormality (intracavity fibroids, uterine septum)
Uncontrolled diabetes or hypothyroidism
Bacterial vaginosis (usually associated with second-trimester loss)
Cervical weakness (‘incompetence’, second-trimester loss only)

KEY POINTS

• Only a minority of women with recurrent miscarriage will have a cause identified.
• Aspirin and heparin are effective in women with antiphospholipid syndrome.
• Reassurance ultrasound scans and support improve outcome for women with
recurrent loss.

intercourse. She does not use any contraception, as they are keen to start a family. She has
never been pregnant in the past.

Examination
There is generalized lower-abdominal tenderness, particularly in the suprapubic area but
no masses are palpable. Speculum examination is unremarkable. On bimanual palpation
the uterus is axial and fixed with cervical excitation. The pouch of Douglas is very tender
and contains a mass. The adnexae are both tender but no adnexal masses are palpable.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 15
The history of dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia are classic for endometriosis, and the
ultrasound examination and laparoscopy images show bilateral endometriomas (‘chocolate cysts’), a complication of this disease.
Endometriosis is a common condition where active endometrial glands and stroma are
located outside the endometrial cavity. Endometriomas develop as ectopic endometrial
tissue on the ovary produces blood, which builds up into an encapsulated cyst with each
consecutive menstrual cycle.
Endometriosis is benign but carries a high physical and psychological morbidity due to
the clinical features:
•
•
•
•

pelvic pain
dysmenorrhoea
dyspareunia
infertility.

Examination findings include tenderness or a pelvic mass, and may include palpable nodules in the rectovaginal septum and a fixed retroverted uterus secondary to adhesions (the
frozen pelvis).
Diagnosis is made at laparoscopy, although ultrasound features such as these ovarian
cysts containing ‘ground-glass’ echoes can be suggestive.

Management
The mainstay of management for endometriosis is surgical, with ablation or excision of
endometriotic deposits by laparoscopy. In this case there are bilateral endometriotic cysts
that need to be removed laparoscopically by incision and drainage with excision of the
cyst capsules. Surgical treatment should relieve the dyspareunia and dysmenorrhoea and
may improve fertility in more severe disease.
Medical suppression of endometriosis is possible with the contraceptive pill or
gonadotrophin-releasing hormone analogues, which inhibit ovulation and hence stimulation of endometrial deposits by oestrogen. However these are ineffective for endometriomas. The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device has also been used to suppress
endometriosis and reduce symptoms.
KEY POINTS

• Endometriosis classically presents with dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia and infertility.
• Endometriosis is often diagnosed years after symptoms start.
• Surgical excision is the mainstay of treatment.

CASE 16:

INFERTILITY

History
A 31-year-old woman and her 34-year-old partner are referred by the general practitioner
because of primary infertility. They have been trying to conceive for over 2 years. The
woman has regular menstrual periods bleeding for 4 days every 28–30 days. Her periods
are not heavy and have never been painful. There is no intermenstrual bleeding or discharge and no postcoital bleeding. She has never been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections.
The last smear was normal 1 year ago. She is a non-smoker and drinks alcohol very
occasionally.
The partner’s only previous medical history was an appendectomy and a course of antihelicobacter therapy after he developed epigastric pain and was diagnosed with the infection. He previously smoked 20 cigarettes per day and drank up to 28 units of alcohol per
week but has now stopped smoking and significantly reduced his alcohol intake. He works
as buyer for a retail company.
The couple have intercourse 1–4 times per week and there is no reported sexual dysfunction or pain on intercourse. They both deny recreational drug use.

Examination
On examination the woman has a body mass index of 23 kg/m2. There is no hirsutism or
acne. There are no signs of thyroid disease. The abdomen is soft and non-tender.
Speculum and bimanual palpation are unremarkable. Genital examination of the partner
is also normal.

Questions

• Are any further investigations necessary?
• How would you manage this couple?

41

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 16
Day 21 progesterone above 30 nmol/L confirms ovulation, and this is supported by normal follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) and prolactin. Normal
testosterone suggests that polycystic ovaries is an unlikely diagnosis.
The semen analysis is normal, and therefore any male factor aetiology is unlikely. Rubella
immunity should always be confirmed.
The hysterosalpingogram shows fill of contrast medium into both uterine tubes but no
spill, suggesting tubal obstruction as the cause of the fertility problem.

Further investigations
Tubal blockage on hysterosalpinogram can sometimes be due to tubal spasm, and therefore a laparoscopy and dye is needed to confirm the pathology and also to determine a
cause such as adhesions from previous infection or possibly endometriosis (although the
history does not support this diagnosis).
Management
If the tubes are found at dye test to be patent, then this would suggest that it is feasible to
attempt pregnancy with in utero insemination. However if blocked tubes are confirmed
then in vitro fertilization (IVF) is indicated. Abnormal tubes are usually removed prior
to IVF, as success rates for pregnancy are better and ectopic pregnancy rate reduced after
bilateral salpingectomy.
General advice should be given to take folic acid 400 μg daily to reduce the risk of neural
tube defects, and to the partner to minimize his alcohol intake.
In this case the laparoscopy showed bilateral hydrosalpinges and adhesions as well as perihepatic ‘violin-string’ adhesions. These findings are consistent with previous infection
with chlamydia (or more rarely gonorrhoea). It is not unusual to find such severe pelvic
adhesions even when there has never been a clear clinical history of pelvic infection or
sexually transmitted infection. Although the infection may be long ago, it is sensible to
treat both the woman and her partner with a course of antibiotics for pelvic inflammatory
disease.

KEY POINTS

• Infertility may be due to anovulation, tubal or endometrial/uterine pathology as well as
male factors.

• Up to 30 per cent of infertile couples have more than one factor causing infertility.
• Tubal obstruction on hysterosalpingogram is not always confirmed at laparoscopy.

CASE 17:

HEAVY PERIODS

History
A 39-year-old woman complains of increasingly long and heavy periods over the last
5 years. Previously she bled for 4 days but now bleeding lasts up to 10 days. The periods
still occur every 28 days. She experiences intermenstrual bleeding between most periods
but no postcoital bleeding.
The periods were never painful previously but in recent months have become extremely
painful with intermittent cramps. She has had four normal deliveries and had a laparoscopic sterilization after her last child. Her smear tests have always been normal, the most
recent being 4 months ago. She has never had any previous irregular bleeding or any
other gynaecological problems.

Examination
The abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable masses. Speculum examination
shows a normal cervix. On bimanual palpation the uterus is bulky (approximately 8 week
size), mobile and anteverted. There are no adnexal masses.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient and counsel her about the management and its
potential risks?

43

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 17
The ultrasound scan shows a submucosal fibroid and this is confirmed by the hysteroscopy
image. At hysteroscopy, a fibroid is a solid smooth immobile structure, whereas a polyp
appears pink and fleshy and mobile. Submucosal fibroids are a common cause of menorrhagia and can cause, as in this case, intermenstrual bleeding. The cramp-like pain occurs as
the uterus tries to expel the fibroid. In some cases this eventually occurs with the fibroid
becoming pedunculated and extending through to the vagina on a pedicle.

Management
The management is by hysteroscopic (transcervical) resection of the fibroid (TCRF). This
can be performed as a day case under general anaesthetic (or even local anaesthetic if the
fibroid is small). The important points in counselling the patient are as follows.
• Description of the procedure: the procedure involves stretching (dilatation) of the
cervix and insertion of an endoscope into the uterus (hysteroscopy) to view the fibroid.
The fibroid is ‘shaved’ away with a hot wire loop (diathermy). Fluid is circulated
through the uterine cavity to enhance the view and allow cooling.
• What are the risks?
• bleeding: it is rare to bleed heavily but in the extreme situation blood transfusion
could be required, or even a hysterectomy to control the loss
• infection
• fluid overload: during the procedure, irrigation fluid is absorbed into the circulation. Excessive absorption can cause breathing difficulties (pulmonary oedema) and
the need for hospital admission
• uterine perforation: rarely the hysteroscope perforates the wall of the uterus and if
this occurs or is suspected then laparoscopy is needed immediately to confirm it,
secure any bleeding and check for damage to surrounding bowel or bladder.
• What to expect afterwards: most women experience bleeding, discharge and passing
of ‘debris’ for up to 2 weeks after the procedure.

KEY POINTS

• Ultrasound is critical in the diagnosis of menorrhagia.
• Submucosal fibroids are more likely to cause menorrhagia than those that are intramural
or subserous.

• Transcervical resection of fibroids is a relatively simple procedure but is associated with
important risks.

CASE 18:

URINARY INCONTINENCE

History
A 61-year-old woman complains of involuntary loss of urine. She has noticed it gradually
over the last 10 years and has finally decided to see her general practitioner about it after
hearing a programme on the radio about treatment for incontinence. The leaking is generally small amounts and she wears a pad all the time. It tends to occur when she cannot
get to the toilet in time. She never leaks on coughing or sneezing. She suffers urgency,
particularly when she comes home after being out and is about to come into the house.
She also has frequency, passing urine every hour during the day and getting up two or
three times each night.
Due to the incontinence she tries not to drink much and usually has two cups of tea first
thing in the morning, coffee mid-morning and a further cup of tea mid-afternoon. Other
than that she drinks one glass of squash per day and has one glass of wine at night.
She is a non-smoker. She has had two uncomplicated vaginal deliveries. Her periods
stopped at the age of 54 years. There is no other gynaecological or medical history of note.

Examination
Abdominal examination is normal. On vaginal examination there is minimal uterovaginal
descent and no anterior or posterior vaginal wall prolapse.
INVESTIGATIONS
Midstream urinalysis: protein negative, blood negative, leucocytes negative, nitrites
negative
Urodynamics: the first urge to void was reported at 150 mL bladder filling. Involuntary
detrusor contractions were noted while the patient was attempting to inhibit micturition.
There was no loss of urine with coughing.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you advise and manage this patient?

45

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 18
The diagnosis is of overactive bladder syndrome (OAB). This was formerly referred to as
detrusor instability. In this condition the bladder contracts involuntarily without the normal trigger to void caused by bladder filling. This results in involuntary loss of urine that
is embarrassing and often impacts enormously on women’s lives, as they are constantly
aware of needing to void and where the nearest toilet might be.
Urodynamic investigation with filling and voiding cystometry is helpful (as in this case)
in confirming the diagnosis by showing spontaneous detrusor contractions during bladder filling.
It is important to exclude other causes of such symptoms (such as urinary tract infection
or a bladder tumour) with urine microscopy.

Management
• Conservative:
• the woman should be advised that both caffeine and alcohol are bladder stimulants
and are likely to worsen symptoms so should be minimized. She should take a normal fluid intake per day but avoid drinks after about 7 pm to limit nocturia
• bladder retraining for 6 weeks, involving a ‘drill’ restricting voiding to increasing
intervals should be taught.
• Medical treatment: if lifestyle advice and bladder retraining fail then anticholinergic
medication such as oxybutynin or tolterodine should be commenced. The associated
side-effects include dry mouth, dry eyes and constipation.
KEY POINTS

• Overactive bladder syndrome is associated with urgency, frequency and urge
incontinence.

• Conservative measures are bladder retraining and caffeine avoidance.
• Medical treatment is with anticholinergics.

CASE 19:

ABSENT PERIODS

History
An 18-year-old woman presents with an absence of periods for 6 months. This has
occurred twice before in the past but on both occasions menstruation returned so she was
not too concerned. Her periods started at the age of 12 years and were initially regular.
She has no medical history of note and denies any medication. She is currently in her first
year at university. She runs most days and reports a ‘healthy’ diet avoiding carbohydrate
foods and meat. She is the oldest of three siblings and her parents separated when she was
12 years. She has minimal contact with her father and lives mainly with her mother who
she says she gets on well with. She has had a boyfriend in the past but has veered away
from any sexual relationships.
Examination
The woman is tall and thin with a body mass index (BMI) of 15.5 kg/m2. There is evidence
of fine downy hair growth on her arms. Heart rate is 86/min and blood pressure
100/65 mmHg. Abdominal examination reveals no scars or masses, and genital examination is not performed.

Questions

• How would you further investigate and manage this woman?

47

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 19
The woman has evidence of hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism – she has low oestradiol
levels associated with low gonadotrophin stimulation from the anterior pituitary. This
may be due to various pituitary or hypothalamic causes, but in this case clearly relates to
anorexia nervosa and possibly excessive exercise. The raised prolactin is consistent with
stress and does not need to be investigated further. At a BMI below 18 kg/m2, menstruation tends to cease, returning once the BMI increases again.
The previous episodes of amenorrhoea probably occurred when her dietary intake was
very low and it may be that starting at university may have increased her stress levels
with the consequence of worsening her anorexia.

Further investigation
• Full blood count, liver and renal function should all be monitored as these are
affected in severe disease.
• A bone scan should be arranged to check for bone density – hypo-oestrogenism as a
result of anorexia is likely to induce early-onset osteoporosis and fractures.
• Pyschological assessment is also important to guide appropriate treatment.
Management
Encouraging the woman to eat a more normal diet and to avoid exercising is the ideal
management, but anorexia is a chronic disease that is often refractory to treatment.
Explanation that her periods will return if she increases her BMI may possibly encourage
her to put on weight.
The combined oral contraceptive pill should be prescribed in the meantime, which will
prevent osteoporosis and bring on periods, albeit pharmacologically induced.
Referral to a specialist eating disorders unit is vital in addressing the long-term problem
for this woman. Commonly, eating disorders arise out of childhood difficulties and family
or group therapy should be considered.
If the investigations suggest renal or hepatic impairment then inpatient management is
likely to be necessary.
KEY POINTS

• Menstruation usually ceases when BMI is less than 18 kg/m2.
• Amenorrhoiec anorexic women need oestrogen replacement to protect them from
osteoporosis.

• Anorexia is often refractory to treatment.

CASE 20:

ABDOMINAL AND BACK PAIN

History
An 83-year-old woman complains of a dragging sensation in the lower abdomen and
lower back pain when standing or walking. It has been present for some years but she can
now only stand for a short time before feeling uncomfortable. It is not noticeable at night.
She has had four vaginal deliveries. She had her menopause at 52 years and took
hormone-replacement therapy for several years for vasomotor symptoms. She has not had
any postmenopausal bleeding and has not had a smear for several years.
She is generally constipated and sometimes finds she can only defecate by placing her fingers into the vagina and compressing a ‘bulge’ she can feel. She has mild frequency and
gets up twice most nights to pass urine. There is no dysuria or haematuria. Occasionally
she does not get to the toilet in time and leaks a small amount of urine, but this does not
worry her unduly.
Medically she is very well and does not take any medications regularly. She lives alone
and does her own shopping and housework.

Examination
On examination she appears well. Blood pressure and heart rate are normal. She is of
average build. The abdomen is soft and non-tender. There is a loss of vulval anatomy consistent with atrophic changes. On examination in the supine position there is a mild prolapse. On standing, the cervix is felt at the level of the introitus. There is a large posterior
wall prolapse and a minimal anterior wall prolapse.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis for her discomfort and pain?
• How would you manage this patient?

49

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 20
The diagnosis is of second-degree uterovaginal prolapse with rectocoele. Prolapse is traditionally categorized according to the level of descent of the cervix in relation to the
introitus:
•
•
•
•

first degree: descent within the vagina
second degree: descent to the introitus
third degree: descent of the cervix outside the vagina
procidentia: complete eversion of the vagina outside the introitus.

More complex grading systems are used by some specialists that involve specific measurements using the hymen as a reference point.
Common presenting symptoms are of ‘something coming down’, a ‘lump’ or a dragging
sensation. Symptoms are always worse on standing or walking because of the effect of
gravity. Prolapse is more common in women who are parous, have had long or traumatic
deliveries, have a chronic cough or constipation. However it may occur in any woman, even
if she is nulliparous, as it relates to collagen strength.

Management
Initial management involves treating the constipation with dietary manipulation and
laxatives. This may relieve some of the symptoms and is also important to prevent recurrence if surgery is to be performed.
Pelvic floor exercises are helpful for mild prolapse and to preserve the integrity of repair
postoperatively, though in this case they are unlikely to make any significant difference
to the presenting symptoms. If surgery is not wanted then she can try a ring pessary to
hold up the prolapse, which can work extremely well and only needs replacing every
6 months.
Although she is 83 this woman has no medical problems and should be offered definitive
prolapse surgery which for her involves vaginal hysterectomy and posterior vaginal wall
repair (colporrhaphy). As there is no abdominal incision involved, recovery is quick and
she would expect to be in hospital for around 3 days.
KEY POINTS

• Prolapse incidence increases with age, parity, constipation and chronic cough.
• Conservative management with a ring pessary, or surgical prolapse repair may be
appropriate.

• Relief of exacerbating factors is important to prevent symptoms worsening or to
maintain the integrity of the repair.

CASE 21:

POSTOPERATIVE CONFUSION

History
You are on call and are asked to see a woman in the day surgery unit who is confused
postoperatively. She is 42 years old and underwent transcervical resection of multiple
submucosal fibroids in the early afternoon after presenting with menorrhagia. Four
fibroids were resected and the estimated blood loss was 150 mL.
Examination
The woman knows her name but is disorientated, scoring only 5/10 on a mini mental state
examination. She seems slightly drowsy.
The heart rate is 100/min and the blood pressure is 105/70 mmHg. Oxygen saturation is
94 per cent on air. She is apyrexial. Chest examination reveals dullness at both bases with
fine inspiratory crackles. The abdomen is not distended but there is generalized lower
abdominal tenderness. No masses are palpable and there are no signs of peritonism. You
can see that there is small amount of blood from the vagina, but the loss is not excessive.
You are told that she passed urine an hour ago without difficulty.
The operation note is reviewed and you find that the procedure was essentially uncomplicated but was halted before all the fibroids could be fully resected because of the fluid
imbalance. The fluid deficit is recorded as 1010 mL. However you review the actual fluid
chart and it is as follows:
Fluid input (glycine, via operating hysteroscope input channel):
1000 mL

Questions

53

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 21
The chest examination and X-ray suggest pulmonary oedema. Investigations show
hyponatraemia and this is a recognized cause of a confusional state. There is also
hypokalaemia which puts her at risk of dysrhythmia or cardiac arrest.
There has been an error in calculating the fluid deficit such that the deficit is in fact
2010 mL rather than 1010 mL. The hyponatraemia is therefore caused by fluid overload,
a recognized complication of transcervical resection procedures. The normal upper limit
for the procedure is 1000 mL and in this case twice that volume has been absorbed.

Management
The mainstay of management is supportive with monitoring of electrolytes and fluid
restriction. Potassium supplementation should be given and electrocardiogram (ECG)
monitoring employed until the potassium is normal.
The woman should be transferred to a high-dependency bed and given oxygen. Arterial
blood gas should be monitored, and if the pulmonary oedema worsens then diuretics will
be needed.
The hyponatraemia usually corrects itself with time and fluid restriction, and the acute
confusional state would be expected to resolve as the electrolytes normalize.
The fibroids were not completely resected and a repeat ultrasound or outpatient hysteroscopy
may be considered after a few weeks to check whether further surgery is needed – sometimes
degeneration may occur as a result of thermal damage or inflammation from the initial procedure. Alternatively any fibroid remnants may be expelled spontaneously through the cervix
and vagina.
KEY POINTS

• Fluid overload and consequent hyponatraemia is a recognized complication of
transcervical resection procedures.

• Accurate input/output monitoring is vital during this procedure.
• Treatment is supportive until electrolytes return to normal.

CASE 22:

POSTMENOPAUSAL BLEEDING

History
A 58-year-old woman reports postmenopausal bleeding for 6 months. Initially she did not
pay much attention to it but she has had several episodes and it now occurs most days. It
is generally light but for a few days recently it was almost like a period. There is no associated pain. The woman has never married or been sexually active. She has no previous
gynaecological history and has never had a smear test. She was diagnosed with type 2
diabetes 4 years ago for which she takes oral hypoglycaemics. However she is not very
compliant with diet modification, and her blood glucose is not well controlled such that
starting insulin is being considered.
Examination
The woman is obese with a body mass index of 32 kg/m2. Her blood pressure is
150/80 mmHg. The abdomen is non-tender, but due to her adiposity it is not possible to
feel abdominal masses.
External genital examination is unremarkable. Speculum and bimanual examination are
not performed as she has never been sexually active.
Transvaginal ultrasound was not possible and a transabdominal ultrasound examination
was therefore performed with a full bladder.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transabdominal ultrasound report: the uterus is normal size and anteverted. The
endometrium could not be clearly visualized. Both ovaries appear normal. Ultrasound view
was restricted by patient adiposity.
Examination under anaesthetic and hysteroscopy: the vagina and cervix appear normal.
Hysteroscopy showed an irregular vascular mass arising from the uterine wall with contact
bleeding. Curettage was performed and products sent for histological examination.
The findings at hysteroscopy are shown in Fig. 22.1.

Figure 22.1 Hysteroscopy findings. See
Plate 4 for colour image.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• If this is confirmed how would you manage this patient?
55

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 22
Postmenopausal bleeding should be considered to be due to endometrial carcinoma until
proven otherwise. In many cases the diagnosis turns out to be benign. However, in this
case early suspicion is raised by the risk factors for endometrial carcinoma:
• type 2 diabetes
• obesity
• nulliparity.
There is also a long history of significant bleeding suggesting a more significant pathology. In women who can tolerate the examination, the diagnosis may be made by outpatient endometrial sampling. In this case however, the inability to examine properly meant
it was appropriate to investigate the uterine cavity and the rest of the lower genital tract
under anaesthetic. The diagnosis of endometrial cancer was confirmed on histology report
from the curettage specimen.

Management
Management of endometrial carcinoma is simple total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingoophorectomy, as 90 per cent of women present with early-stage disease.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan prior to the procedure may be carried out to
check for possible lymph node involvement, in which case lymph node biopsy should be
performed at the time of surgery. Cases of stage 2 or greater disease are less common and
need adjuvant radiotherapy.
Histology is needed to stage endometrial cancer:
• stage 1: confined to the body of the uterus
• 1a limited to the endometrium
• 1b invasion only of the inner half of the myometrium
• 1c invasion to the outer half the of the myometrium
• stage 2: involving the uterus and cervix only
• stage 3: extending beyond the uterus but not beyond the true pelvis
• stage 4: extending beyond the true pelvis or into the bladder or rectum.
The woman should be advised that the prognosis is generally good with over 70 per cent
survival at 5 years for stage 1 disease, though it is only 10 per cent for stage 4 disease.
KEY POINTS

• Postmenopausal bleeding is due to endometrial cancer until proven otherwise.
• Women with prolonged or heavy bleeding are more likely to have pathology.
• Endometrial cancer is staged histologically.

CASE 23:

PELVIC PAIN

History
A 24-year-old woman presents with pelvic pain and painful sexual intercourse for 2 years
and is worried that she may have an ovarian cyst or other gynaecological problem. The
pain occurs at any time of the menstrual cycle but is worse during menstruation. It can
also be worse when she passes urine or opens her bowels. There is no relation to exercise.
She has been with her current sexual partner for 6 months and the pain occurs nearly
every time she has intercourse unless penetration is very gentle. She has never been diagnosed with any sexually transmitted infections. She has been pregnant once at the age of
19 years but this ended in a spontaneous complete miscarriage.
She opens her bowels regularly and denies any bloating, constipation, diarrhoea or mucus
in the stool. She had an episode of cystitis a few years ago which responded to antibiotics.
There is no other medical history of note and she takes no regular medications.

Examination
The abdomen is not distended and there is no organomegaly. No masses are palpable but
there is suprapubic tenderness. Speculum examination shows a normal smooth grey/white
coloured discharge and swabs are taken. The uterus is anteverted but has limited mobility
and is tender on movement. There are no adnexal masses but the adnexae are tender.

INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis: protein negative; blood negative; leucocytes negative; nitrites negative
Endocervical swab: negative
Chlamydial swab: negative
High vaginal swab: negative
Transvaginal ultrasound report: the uterus is normal sized and axial. The endometrium

The laparoscopy image shows in Fig. 23.1 pelvic adhesions suggestive of previous infection. The ‘violin-string’ perihepatic adhesions in Fig. 23.2 are classical of Fitz-Hugh–Curtis
syndrome, generally seen with previous chlamydial infection though also described with
gonorrhoea. These findings can develop in the absence of a clinically recognized infective
episode.
The woman therefore has chronic pain from pelvic inflammatory disease. Negative swabs
would suggest that she may no longer be infected with chlamydia.

Management
The pain may be helped with laparoscopic adhesiolysis. The perihepatic adhesions should
be ignored as they are not causing symptoms. Otherwise pain-management options are
analgesics or possible uterosacral nerve ablation.
Even though there is no evidence of current active infection, the tests have limited sensitivity so it is worthwhile treating the woman and her partner with a course of antibiotics
for pelvic inflammatory disease.

!

Long-term complications of pelvic inflammatory disease

• Chronic pain
• Infertility: tubal infertility is likely in this woman and if she fails to conceive
•

spontaneously then hysterosalpingogram should be performed with referral for
assisted conception if obstruction is confirmed
Ectopic pregnancy: spontaneous and in vitro fertilization pregnancies are at
increased risk of implanting in the damaged tubes, and an early transvaginal scan
should be advised if she becomes pregnant

The woman should also be advised that despite the likely subfertility, spontaneous
pregnancy may still occur so she should use effective contraception if she does not
want to conceive.

KEY POINTS

• Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome is the presence of perihepatic adhesions in association with
previous chlamydial or gonococcal infection.

• Treatment of both partners is appropriate.
• Chronic pain, ectopic pregnancy and tubal infertility are long-term consequences of
pelvic inflammatory disease.

CASE 24:

AMENORRHOEA

History
A 14-year-old girl is seen by her general practitioner because her mother is worried that
her periods have not started. Her older sister started at 13 years and her younger sister has
just started her periods at 12 years, and she is now embarrassed at school as her friends
are always discussing their periods and she has not told them that she has not had one.
Her mother is also concerned because she has not developed pubic and axillary hair or
breast enlargement.
She was born at 38 weeks by spontaneous vaginal delivery and has never had any particular medical problems. She reached all her developmental milestones as a child although
has not started a teenage growth spurt and is the second shortest girl in her class.
She eats normally with her family and denies any eating disorder. She takes part in school
sport but does not exercise to excess.
She is sociable with her friends but has never had a boyfriend.
Her school academic performance is about average, although she does not do as well as
her siblings who are all in the top streams of their years.

Examination
On examination she is 120 cm and weighs 59 kg. She has no abnormal facial features but
has a wide carrying angle (cubitus valgus) and a wide neck. There is no apparent breast
development and the nipples appear widely spaced. No axillary hair growth is apparent.
Abdominal examination is unremarkable. The external genitalia are normal though no
pubic hair is visible. Internal examination is not performed.

• What are the principles of management for this girl?

61

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 24
The clinical features are typical of those of Turner’s syndrome. This genetic condition is
associated with the absence of one X chromosome (XO karyotype), occurring in approximately 1 in 2500 live female births. It is confirmed on chromosomal analysis.
In rare cases it may occurs as a mosaic form (XX/XO), in which case the features are
milder and the woman may start menstruating but then experience premature ovarian
failure and secondary amenorrhoea.

!

Common clinical features of Turner’s syndrome

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Webbed neck
Broad chest with widely spaced nipples (‘shield chest’)
Wide carrying angle (cubitus valgus)
Short stature (maximum 150 cm without treatment)
Short fourth metacarpal
Low-set ears
Low hairline
Hypoplastic nails
Hypertension
Congenital heart disease (e.g. coarctation of the aorta)

Management
Management of Turner’s syndrome should be carried out in a specialist referral centre.
• Psychological: the implications of Turner’s syndrome diagnosis are devastating for
the child and for the family. The absence of periods may be stigmatizing and the
long-term lack of fertility is a very serious concept that may be difficult for a young
girl to comprehend.
• Medical:
• the short stature should be treated to enable the girl to reach her full height potential. Human growth hormone is given to achieve this.
• oestrogen therapy initially with ethinyl estradiol enables secondary sexual characteristics of breast development and pubic and axillary hair to develop. Cyclical
progestogens are added later to induce a withdrawal bleed (‘period’) for social reasons and to protect the endometrium from hyperplasia or malignancy in the long
term. Some form of oestrogen therapy then needs to be continued until the time of
natural menopause (ideally 50 years) to prevent early-onset osteoporosis in this girl.
• Fertility: fertility options are available with ovum donation and hormonal support.
KEY POINTS

• Turner’s syndrome is a cause of primary amenorrhoea.
• Most girls will be diagnosed in early childhood because of small stature or other
physical features, but some will only be diagnosed when menarche fails to occur.

• Treatment, usually hormonal, to protect bone density is essential.

CASE 25:

POSTCOITAL AND INTERMENSTRUAL BLEEDING

History
A 28-year-old woman presents with intermenstrual and postcoital bleeding. She has been
taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for 4 years and has had regular light
periods throughout that time. She has been with the same partner since she was 20 years
and has had no previous episodes of bleeding. The bleeding is light and fresh, occurring
immediately after intercourse. At other times it occurs spontaneously at unpredictable
times. It varies in intensity but is never heavy. There is no associated pain.
She had a normal smear test at the age of 25 years. She has never had any sexually transmitted infections, has never been pregnant and there is no relevant previous gynaecological history.
Medically she is well and takes no medication.

Examination
The abdomen is non-tender with no palpable masses. The external genitalia appear normal. On speculum examination the vagina appears normal as does the cervix. However,
protruding through the external cervical os is a pink fleshy tumour which is freely mobile
when touched with a cotton swab.
Questions
• What are the usual differential diagnoses for irregular bleeding in women taking the
COCP who have normal examination findings?
• What is the likely diagnosis in this case?
• How would you further manage this patient?

63

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 25

!

Differential diagnosis of irregular bleeding with the COCP, if examination is normal

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Poor compliance
Concurrent antibiotics (impair COCP absorption)
Diarrhoea or vomiting (impair absorption)
Infection (chlamydia, gonorrhoea or candida)
Cervical ectropion
Bleeding diathesis
Drug interactions (e.g. antiepileptics)

In this case the examination shows an endocervical polyp. This is generally a benign
lesion that extends through the cervical canal from the endometrial cavity, on a long thin
pedicle. It may be asymptomatic and found incidentally at the time of a routine smear test.
Alternatively it may give rise to symptoms of intermenstrual or postcoital bleeding as in
this woman.

Management
The management is simple by avulsion in the outpatient clinic under speculum examination. The polyp is grasped with polyp forceps and twisted repeatedly until it detaches from
its base. It does not matter if the whole stalk does not detach with the polyp, as any remnant generally necroses and disappears. The polyp should always be sent for histological
examination although malignancy is extremely rare.
In older women or those in whom the history suggests another possible pathology, then
ultrasound should be arranged to assess the endometrial cavity more thoroughly. This is
not necessary in this case.
KEY POINTS

• Women with irregular bleeding on the COCP should have a thorough history and
examination with swabs taken for infection.

• Endocervical polyps are common and generally benign.
• Avulsion of endocervical polyps is simple in the outpatient setting.

CASE 26:

LABILE MOOD AND ABDOMINAL PAIN

History
A 37-year-old mother presents to her general practitioner with cyclical labile mood
swings. She says that she has always suffered with ‘PMS’ (premenstrual syndrome) and
that it is in the family as her mother had to have a hysterectomy for the same problem.
She reports her periods as always having been painful and that she has always been irritable leading up to a period. However now she feels that she is not herself for at least
2 weeks before her period and that the pain has worsened. She also notices headaches,
swelling and breast tenderness.
Her periods are generally with regular bleeding for up to 6 days every 27–31 days. She has
had three children all by normal vaginal delivery and the youngest is now 5 years old. She
has no other medical history of note.
She has been married for 14 years and she says she often feels aggressive towards her husband or alternatively is tearful and low. Prior to having children she worked in a bank and
is not sure whether to return as she feels she might be unable to cope.

Examination
No abnormality is found on abdominal or neurological examination.
Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you further determine the cause of the symptoms and manage this patient?

65

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 26
The woman clearly feels that this is a gynaecological problem and that she has PMS. The
diagnosis should be confirmed with evidence of symptoms occurring in the luteal phase
and resolving within a day or two of menstruation starting. The differential diagnosis is
depression which can manifest in a similar way to PMS.
A symptom diary is needed for recording symptoms for each day, over a 3-month period.
The woman should annotate a chart with the severity of each symptom and when
menstruation occurs. PMS should start after midcycle, symptoms should resolve with the
period, and there should be a number of symptom-free days each month.
An example of a symptom diary is shown in Fig. 26.1.

Figure 26.1 Premenstrual syndrome symptom diary.

Management
If confirmed then the diagnosis should be discussed with the woman, offering appropriate
understanding and support but explaining that management is variable in the success for
each woman and that ‘one size does not fit all’. Vitamins and oil of evening primrose are
not proven in trials but may have a placebo effect.
Interruption of ovulation with the oral contraceptive pill is often successful in women
under the age of 35 years.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have a good success rate in randomized trials, and
the woman should be advised that they have a specific effect with PMS rather than just a
general antidepressant effect.
Hysterectomy would not be helpful unless the ovaries were also removed, and this would
involve risk of significant morbidity with the need for hormone-replacement therapy
afterwards which may have its own side-effects or complications.
66

KEY POINTS

• Premenstrual syndrome is diagnosed with a symptom diary.
• No single treatment is effective for all women.
• Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are effective in many women with premenstrual
syndrome.

CASE 27:

CERVICAL CANCER

History
A 28-year-old woman was referred to the colposcopy clinic because of intermenstrual and
postcoital bleeding. On examination a macroscopically visible lesion was present and on
colposcopy features of malignancy were seen. Subsequent biopsy showed invasive squamous carcinoma of the cervix.
The woman was informed of the diagnosis and as a result went on to undergo an examination under anaesthetic, cystoscopy and proctoscopy for staging. The mass was found to
be 3 cm in size and there was no palpable extension into the uterus, vagina or parametrial
tissues. The cystoscopy and proctoscopy were both normal.

Question
• What are the possible treatment options and their potential complications?

69

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 27
Cervical cancer may be treated surgically or by radiotherapy. Staging is performed clinically at examination under anaesthetic as described.

!

Cervical cancer staging

• Stage 1: carcinoma confined to the cervix
• 1a: microscopic carcinoma

•
•
•

– 1a1: stromal invasion less than 3 mm depth and 7 mm width
– 1a2: stromal invasion up to 5 mm diameter and less than 7 mm width
• 1b: macroscopic carcinoma
– 1b1: up to 4 cm lesion
– 1b2: greater than 4 cm lesion
Stage 2: carcinoma extending beyond the cervix to the upper two-thirds of the
vagina or parametrium
Stage 3: carcinoma extending to the lower third of the vagina or the pelvic side wall
Stage 4: carcinoma involves the bladder, rectum or beyond the pelvis

Radical hysterectomy
Up to stage 1b women may be treated with radical hysterectomy (also known as
Wertheim’s hysterectomy). This involves removal of the uterus, cervix, pelvic lymph nodes
and parametrial tissue as well as the upper third of the vagina. Complications involve
bleeding and infection. Ureteric damage may occur and blood vessel injury is not uncommon. Postoperative complications include infections of the chest, wound or urinary tract
as well as venous thromboembolism and later-onset lymphoedema from interruption of
lymphatic drainage from the lower limbs.
The advantage of this treatment is that it preserves ovarian function, important for wellbeing and prevention of osteoporosis. It also avoids the complications of radiotherapy
outlined below.

Trachelectomy
This involves removal of the cervix, lymph nodes and parametrial tissue with conservation of the ovaries and uterine body with insertion of a suture (cerclage) at the base of the
uterus. It is used selectively for women with early stage disease who wish to preserve their
fertility.
Radiotherapy
Disease beyond stage 1b, and postmenopausal women should be treated with radiotherapy
which is effective but is associated with long-term effects of bowel stenosis, cystitis and
vaginal stenosis. It also generally renders women menopausal due to radiation to the
ovaries.
KEY POINTS

• Cervical carcinoma should be considered in any woman with intermenstrual or
postcoital bleeding.

• Disease staging is clinical, under anaesthetic.
• Cervical carcinoma may be treated surgically or by radiotherapy, depending on the stage
of disease.

CASE 28:

URINARY INCONTINENCE

History
A 49-year-old woman presents with leaking of urine. This started after the birth of her
third child 10 years ago and has gradually worsened. She has not felt comfortable talking
to her general practitioner about it until now. The leakage occurs on coughing and laughing. However she has recently started to play badminton to lose weight and the symptoms
are much worse, but she has discovered though that the symptoms are much better if she
wears a tampon while playing. There is no dysuria, nocturia, frequency or urgency. She is
mildly constipated.
All her children were born by induction of labour post-term. They weighed 3.6 kg. 3.8 kg
and 4.1 kg respectively and she needed a forceps delivery for the third child after failure
to progress in the third stage. She has a regular menstrual cycle and has had a laparoscopic sterilization. There is no other relevant medical history and she takes no medications. She smokes 15 cigarettes per day and does not drink alcohol.

Examination
Body mass index is 29 kg/m2. There are no significant findings on abdominal or vaginal
examination.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis: protein negative; blood negative; leucocytes negative; nitrites negative
Urodynamics report: the first urge to void was felt at 300 mL. The maximum bladder
capacity was 450 mL. Involuntary loss of urine was noted with coughing during bladder
filling, in the absence of detrusor activity.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you advise and manage this woman?

71

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 28
This woman is suffering from stress incontinence. Stress incontinence can be diagnosed
from the history – involuntary loss of urine when the intraabdominal pressure increases
(such as with exercise or coughing). Urodynamic stress incontinence (formerly referred to
as genuine stress incontinence) is the involuntary loss of urine when the intravesical pressure exceeds the maximum urethral pressure in the absence of a detrusor contraction and
can only be diagnosed after urodynamic testing.

Management
Conservative management
• Lifestyle
• The woman should be advised to control factors that exacerbate symptoms:
• reduce weight
• stop smoking to relieve chronic cough symptoms
• alter diet and consider laxatives to avoid constipation
• Pelvic floor exercises: properly taught pelvic floor muscle training is a very effective
treatment and can cause improvement in symptoms or cure in up to 85 per cent of
women.
Surgical management
The two main surgical techniques used currently are:
• transvaginal or transobturator vaginal tape
• colposuspension.
Both are effective but the former technique is minimally invasive and recovery is therefore more rapid. Alternative techniques such as periurethral bulking injections can be
used in refractory cases or where the woman is unsuitable for surgery.
KEY POINTS

• Stress incontinence is a clinical diagnosis.
• First-line treatment is avoidance of exacerbating factors and pelvic muscle exercises.
• Urodynamic stress incontinence should be confirmed prior to surgery.

CASE 29:

PELVIC PAIN

History
A 21-year-old student presents with left iliac fossa and lower abdominal pain. The pain is
present intermittently and there is no pattern to it except that it is generally worse on
exercise and so she has stopped running to keep fit. The pain started about 6 months
before and has gradually become more common and severe. It is no worse with her
periods and she is not currently sexually active so cannot report any dyspareunia. Her
periods are regular and not particularly heavy or painful. She has not had any previous
gynaecological problems. She has had one sexual partner who she was with for 4 years.
She denies any sexually transmitted infections.
Medically she is fit and well, and has only been admitted to hospital for wisdom teeth
removal and for tonsillectomy as a child. She takes no medications.

Examination
The woman is slim and the abdomen is soft with a palpable mass in the left iliac fossa.
This is firm and feels mobile. It is moderately tender.
Speculum examination is normal. Bimanual examination confirms an 8 cm mass in the
left adnexa. The uterus is palpable separately and is mobile and anteverted. The right
adnexa is normal.

INVESTIGATIONS

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this woman?

75

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 29
The woman has a left ovarian cyst. The ultrasound appearance shows an ovarian cyst. The
appearance is of mixed echogenicity with ‘acoustic shadowing’ and this appearance is
typical for a dermoid cyst (also known as a benign teratoma). The X-ray shows the presence of teeth in the left iliac fossa region.
These cysts are common. Typically sebaceous fluid is present, often in association with
strands of hair or sometimes teeth. If active thyroid tissue develops the woman may present with features of hyperthyroidism and the cyst is referred to as a struma ovarii.
The management is surgical with ovarian cystectomy, due to the size of the cyst and the
symptoms. Ideally this can be performed laparoscopically. In asymptomatic cysts there is
a possibility of expectant management (‘watch and wait’). However the risks of leaving
the cyst are:
• malignancy occurs in up to 2 per cent of dermoid cysts
• ovarian torsion is thought to be relatively common in women with dermoid cysts
and if this occurs it is a medical emergency, which may involve oophorectomy.
The woman should be advised that the cysts are common and there is very little chance
that it is malignant or that removing it will affect her fertility. However, recurrence
may occur in either ovary and she should seek further consultation if she develops recurrent pain.
KEY POINTS

• Dermoid cysts (mature cystic teratoma) are a common cause of ovarian cysts in young
women.

• They commonly display a classic appearance on X-ray or ultrasound scan.
• Surgery is usually recommended because of a small risk of torsion or malignant
transformation.

CASE 30:

EARLY MENARCHE

History
An 8-year-old girl is referred by the general practitioner because her periods have started.
She was born at term by spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy. She
has had the normal childhood illnesses but there is no significant serious medical history
of note. She takes no medication. Her physical development has been unremarkable until
a year ago when she changed from being average height to the second tallest in her class.
Educationally she is achieving at a similar level to her peers. She has many friends and no
behavioural problems. She is the first of three children and her mother reports her own
periods starting at 11 years.

Examination
General examination is normal. The girl has significant breast bud development and some
fine pubic hair. Further genital examination is not performed.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis and what are the problems associated with it?
• How would you investigate and manage this girl?

77

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 30
The average age of menarche is 13 years, and the start of periods before the age of 9 years,
as in this case, is classified as precocious puberty.
In normal puberty, girls tend to start breast bud development from 9–13 years, start pubic
hair growth from 10–14 years and menarche starts at 11–15 years. An increased rate of
growth starts at 11–12 years and growth finishes at around 15 years. When these changes
occur early but in the normal sequence, the precocious puberty is usually of no significant
consequence and termed constitutional early development. This is often familial. However,
if it occurs very early or in an abnormal sequence, a pathological cause is more likely

!

Causes of precocious puberty

•
•
•
•
•
•

Constitutional (⬎90 per cent)
Hypothyroidism
CNS lesions (hydrocephaly, neurofibromatosis)
Ovarian tumour
Adrenal tumour
Exogenous oestrogens

Problems of precocious puberty
• Growth: although the growth spurt starts early in precocious puberty, growth also
stops prematurely (premature epiphyseal closure) and therefore girls with precocious
puberty are at risk of having a reduced final stature if untreated.
• Embarrassment: early secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of periods can
be very difficult for a girl to deal with at a young age.
• Social interaction: difficulties can occur when people who do not know the child’s
chronological age assume a level of intellectual and emotional maturity according to
the child’s physical maturity (apparent age).
Investigation
Gonadotrophins, prolactin and thyroid hormones should be checked to confirm that they
correlate with normal pubertal levels. Computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary for visualization of the pituitary stalk.
Abdominopelvic ultrasound will rule out an ovarian or adrenal tumour. Bone scan will
determine biological bone age to ascertain whether pituitary suppression is indicated.
Management
As the changes in this girl seem to be in a normal sequence and she is within two years of
the normal age of menarche she can be managed expectantly. However, if the changes had
started at a younger age, pituitary suppression should be started with gonadotrophinreleasing hormone analogues, to delay the growth spurt and thus maintain full final height.
KEY POINTS

• Over 90 per cent of girls with precocious puberty have constitutional (idiopathic)
•

78

precocious puberty with no pathological cause, but an abnormal sequence of pubertal
development or very early puberty should trigger further investigation.
The major problems of precocious puberty are short final stature and social
embarassment.

CASE 31:

EXCESSIVE HAIR GROWTH

History
A 19-year-old woman was referred by her general practitioner (GP) with increased hair
growth.
She first noticed the problem when she was about 16 years old and it has progressively
worsened such that she now feels very self-conscious and will never wear a bikini or go
swimming. It also affects her forming relationships. The hair growth is noticed mainly on
her arms, thighs and abdomen. Hair has developed on the upper lip more recently. She has
tried shaving but this seems to make the problem worse. She feels depilation creams are
ineffective. Waxing is helpful but very expensive and she has bleached her upper-lip hair.
Her GP has not prescribed any medication in the past.
There is no significant previous medical history of note. Her periods started at the age of
13 years and she bleeds every 30–35 days. The periods are not painful or heavy and there
is no intermenstrual bleeding or discharge. She has never been sexually active.

Examination
On examination she has an increased body mass index (BMI) of 29 kg/m2. The blood pressure is 118/70 mmHg. There is excessive hair growth on the lower arms, legs and thighs and
in the midline of the abdomen below the umbilicus. There is a small amount of growth on
the upper lip too. The abdomen is soft and no masses are palpable. Pelvic examination is
not indicated as she is a virgin.

ANSWER 31
The likely diagnosis is of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This is supported by the
clinical features of hirsutism, acne, increased BMI and slight menstrual irregularity. The
biochemical results show the typical moderately raised androgen and raised LH to FSH
ratio.
If the testosterone level was higher, androgen-secreting tumours should be considered
(androgen-secreting ovarian, pituitary or adrenal tumours).
Other causes of hyperandrogenism include iatrogenic (glucocorticoids, danazol, testosterone), idiopathic or familial.

Further investigation
A transabdominal ultrasound scan should be arranged to confirm the ultrasound features
of polycystic ovaries, although this is not in fact an essential feature for the diagnosis of
the syndrome.
Treatment
Various treatments are used for hirsutism once serious causes of hyperandrogenism have
been excluded. One of the commonest is to commence the cyproterone acetate-containing
combined oral contraceptive pill (co-cyprindiol). Cyproterone acetate is an anti-androgen
with progestogenic activity. It takes several months for an improvement to be seen in the
hair growth and she will continue to need to use the cosmetic treatments in the meantime.
If this is ineffective then cyproterone acetate at a higher dose can be used either alone, or
in addition to co-cyprindiol.
General advice should include weight loss, as this counteracts the metabolic imbalance
associated with PCOS and is favourable in the long term in terms of the known cardiovascular risks associated with hyperandrogenism.
KEY POINTS

• Most women with hirsutism have PCOS or a familial tendency.
• Androgen-secreting tumours should be excluded in women with testosterone level
above 5 nmol/L.

• Hirsutism has significant psychosocial consequences.

EMERGENCY GYNAECOLOGY
CASE 32: PAIN AND THE INTRAUTERINE SYSTEM
History
A 30-year-old woman had a levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) inserted by
her general practitioner (GP) 3 weeks ago. Ten days ago she presented to the emergency
department with abdominal pain, and on examination the threads were not visible and
ultrasound scan suggested the IUS was misplaced in the right uterine cornu. An appointment was made for hysteroscopic resection but she has presented again in the interim with
further pain.
Examination
The abdomen is not distended and is soft. There is generalized lower abdominal tenderness. The threads cannot be visualized on speculum examination.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound report: the uterus is anteverted and of normal size. The endometrium
is regular and measures 11 mm. An IUS is not visible. Both ovaries appear normal in size
and morphology.
Abdominal X-ray is shown in Fig. 32.1.

Questions
• How would you explain the symptoms and investigation findings?
• How would you further investigate and manage this patient?

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 32
The Plain X-ray shows the IUS in the pelvis but it is lying at a transverse angle in the right
pelvis. It is clearly not within the uterus. The current ultrasound result confirms that the
uterus is empty. However, the previous report suggested the device was at the uterine
cornu. It can be concluded therefore that the device was inserted into the uterus but it has
subsequently migrated through the myometrium into the peritoneal cavity. We have no
evidence to determine whether or not it was originally placed in the correct position at the
fundus.

!

Complications of intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)/intrauterine device insertion

•
•
•
•

Uterine perforation
Device migration through to peritoneal cavity
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Expulsion of device (commonly with the next period)

Investigation
The only important investigation is a pregnancy test, as the woman is potentially pregnant since the IUS may not have been effective if it was never in the correct location.
Management
The IUS needs to be retrieved. While it was in the uterus this could have been performed
with outpatient hysteroscopic retrieval. However, now a laparoscopy is indicated.
In this case the laparoscopy revealed blood-stained free fluid in the pouch of Douglas,
with scarring on the right fundal area of the uterus. The IUS was found covered with
omentum in the right lower abdomen. It was easily removed laparoscopically.
As the woman had wanted the IUS for contraception as well as treatment of her menorrhagia, and as the uterus appeared to have healed, a new IUS was inserted under laparoscopic guidance at the time. Antibiotics were given to prevent infection.
Once an IUS or IUCD has been inserted, women should be advised to have their GP check
the threads are still visible after the first period. Thereafter, most women are willing and
able to check the threads themselves.

KEY POINTS

• The differential diagnosis of lost IUS threads is perforation and migration of the device,
expulsion or misplacement of the device within the uterine cavity.

• Appropriate location at the fundus is essential for full contraceptive efficacy.
• Women with a ‘lost IUCD’ should use alternative contraception.

CASE 33: BLEEDING IN PREGNANCYHistory
History
A 19-year-old woman presents at 13 weeks’ gestation with vaginal bleeding and a smelly
watery discharge. She feels generally unwell and has had fevers for the last 48 h. She initially thought she had gastroenteritis as she had reduced appetite, abdominal pain, vomited and had loose stools.
All her booking bloods were normal and the 11 week ‘nuchal’ scan was reassuring. She
had a previous normal vaginal delivery at 38 weeks’ gestation. She has no significant
gynaecological or general medical history.

Examination
On examination the temperature is 38.1°C, pulse 96/min and blood pressure 110/68 mmHg.
She looks flushed and her peripheries are warm. Chest and cardiac examin-ation are normal.
She is tender over the uterus, which feels approximately 14 weeks’ size. There is no guarding
or rebound. On speculum examination the cervical os is closed but an offensive blood-stained
discharge is seen. Bimanual examination reveals a very tender and hot uterus that also feels
‘boggy’. No adnexal masses are palpable but bilateral adnexal tenderness is evident.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 33
The woman is pregnant with a dead fetus and signs of sepsis. This is referred to as a septic miscarriage. This used to be a common diagnosis due to the high incidence of illegal
terminations performed by unqualified people without appropriate sterile technique,
instruments or anaesthesia. Since the 1967 Abortion Act, morbidity and mortality from
septic miscarriage has fallen dramatically but it remains a cause of maternal mortality,
often because it is not recognized early enough. It should therefore be recognized
promptly and treated aggressively.
Further investigations necessary are: blood cultures; liver function tests; coagulation
screen, group and save; high vaginal and endocervical swabs.

!

Complications of septic miscarriage

•
•
•
•
•

Massive haemorrhage
Hysterectomy
Disseminated intravascular coagulopathy
Multisystem failure (secondary to haemorrhage or sepsis)
Death

Management
• The woman should be admitted and commenced on broad-spectrum intravenous
antibiotics pending culture and sensitivity.
• Aggressive intravenous fluids should be given as she has intravascular depletion due to
sepsis (vasodilatation) and vomiting.
• Evacuation of retained products of conception should be arranged urgently, once the
first dose of antibiotics has been given.
• A senior gynaecologist should be involved as the risks of uterine perforation or of massive haemorrhage are significant in the presence of sepsis.
• A urinary catheter should be inserted to monitor renal function.
• The woman may need transfer to the intensive care unit depending on her cardiovascular, respiratory and haematological state.
KEY POINTS

• Septic miscarriage is rare since the legalization of termination of pregnancy.
• It should be recognized and treated aggressively due to the risk of rapid deterioration
and mortality.

• Evacuation of retained products of conception is essential to eliminate the focus of
infection.

CASE 34: PELVIC PAIN
History
A 27-year-old woman complains of left iliac fossa pain. The pain started while she was
asleep the night before last and she says it woke her suddenly. Initially the pain was constant and severe and she was unable to get out of bed for a few hours. She felt nauseated
and did not eat anything all day yesterday. There was no associated bleeding or discharge
and there are no bowel or urinary symptoms. Today the pain is still present but much
improved and she has been able to have breakfast.
She has had similar episodes twice in the past but they were not as severe or long-lasting. She
had never been pregnant and uses the progesterone only pill (POP) for contraception. She
has been with her partner for 3 years and has not had any previous sexually transmitted
infections. There is no other medical history of note.

Examination
The temperature is 37.1°C, heart rate 76/min and blood pressure 122/70 mmHg. The
abdomen is slightly distended and tender in the suprapubic and left iliac fossa regions
with some rebound tenderness but no guarding. No masses are palpable. Speculum examination is normal and she is tender in the left adnexa on bimanual examination, but no
cervical excitation or masses are evident.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

85

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 34
The sudden onset of left iliac pain suggests rupture, haemorrhage or torsion of an ovarian
cyst. In cases of torsion of the ovary this would normally result in vomiting and systemic
upset, whereas this woman’s condition has in fact improved. In addition, an adnexal mass
would be visible on ultrasound. Haemorrhage into a cyst would be seen on transvaginal
ultrasound scan as an echogenic ovarian enlargement.
If a cyst ruptures then it is common for the ovary to appear ultrasonographically normal
afterwards but the finding of free fluid in the pouch of Douglas suggests the former
pathology.
Thus the diagnosis is likely to be a ruptured ovarian cyst. Alternative diagnoses may
include irritable bowel syndrome or possibly renal colic, though urinalysis does not show
haematuria.

Management
The patient is already improving and the free fluid which is causing the peritoneal irritation (and the rebound tenderness) is expected to resolve spontaneously. Therefore immediate management is supportive with analgesia.
In the longer term, the woman should be advised to use a different contraceptive as the
POP is known to be associated with an increased incidence of ovarian cysts and it seems
from the history that this is the third episode for this woman.

KEY POINTS

• The only ultrasound evidence of ovarian cyst rupture may be the presence of free
peritoneal fluid.

• Ovarian cyst rupture should be managed expectantly.
• An increased incidence of ovarian cysts is found in women using the progesterone only
pill, whereas the combined oral contraceptive pill reduces cyst occurrence by inhibiting
ovulation.

CASE 35: VULVAL SWELLING
History
A 17-year-old girl presents with a vulval swelling. She noticed a lump a few weeks earlier
and in the last 2 days it has enlarged and become painful. She cannot walk normally and
has not been able to wear her normal jeans because of the discomfort. She feels well in herself however.
She has been sexually active since the age of 14 years and uses the depot progesterone
injection for contraception and therefore does not have periods. She has been with her
boyfriend for 8 months and on direct questioning reports unprotected intercourse with
two other boys in that time. She had a sexual health screen in a genitourinary clinic 1 year
ago and the result was normal. There is no other medical history of note and she takes no
medication.

Examination
The temperature is 37.7°C, heart rate 68/min and blood pressure normal. Abdominal
examination is normal. There is a left-sided posterior labial swelling extending anteriorly
from the level of the introitus, measuring 6 ⫻ 4 ⫻ 4 cm. It appears red, fluctuant, tense
and is exquisitely tender to touch. Bilateral tender inguinal lymph nodes are noted.
Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you manage this patient?

87

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 35
The diagnosis is of a Bartholin’s abscess. The Bartholin’s glands are located in the posterior vulva and the gland ducts open into the lower vagina to maintain a moist vaginal
surface, important during intercourse. Obstruction to a duct by inflammation (from friction during intercourse) or infection causes a cyst to develop, which commonly becomes
infected. Usually mixed flora is found but in 20 per cent of cases gonorrhoea is isolated.
The diagnosis is clinical and it is important to differentiate a Bartholin’s cyst from the differential diagnosis of a sebaceous cyst, vaginal wall cyst or perianal abscess.

Management
The abscess must be drained, traditionally by formal incision and drainage, with the edges
of the cyst capsule sutured to the skin to prevent reclosure of the duct (marsupialization).
Alternatively a Word catheter can be inserted for 4 weeks, which acts to allow continued
abscess drainage and encourage epithelialization of the tract to provide a long-term
drainage route for the gland. In most cases antibiotics are not needed after drainage,
unless there is surrounding erythema or systemic signs of sepsis are present.
In this case the girl has had several recent partners and a general sexually transmitted
infection screen should be arranged after drainage of the cyst, with general sexual health
advice. She should also be advised that Bartholin’s abscesses may recur, even after
marsupialization.

KEY POINTS

• Bartholin’s abscesses are relatively common and cause acute painful unilateral vulval
swelling.

• Drainage of the abscess and marsupialization of the skin edges are the mainstay of
treatment but recurrence is still common.

• Pus should always be sent for culture as gonorrhoea is isolated from up to 20 per cent of
Bartholin’s abscesses.

CASE 36: ABDOMINAL PAIN
History
A 26-year-old woman presents with abdominal pain. It started suddenly 2 h ago and was
initially in the lower abdomen but is now generalized. She feels nauseated and dizzy,
especially when she sits up. She also feels as if she has bruised her shoulder. She has not
noticed any vaginal bleeding or discharge, and there are no bowel or urinary symptoms.
She does not keep a record of her period dates but thinks the last one was about a month
ago. She has a regular partner and says that they often forget to use a condom.
She had a termination 3 years ago. She was diagnosed with chlamydia when she was
admitted to hospital at the age of 19 years with a pelvic infection.
There is no other medical history of note.

Examination
On examination she is pale and looks unwell. She is intermittently drowsy. She is lying
flat and still on the bed. The temperature is 35.9°C, pulse 120/min and blood pressure
95/50 mmHg. Peripherally she is cool and the hands are clammy. She is generally slim but
the abdomen is symmetrically distended. There is generalized tenderness on light palpation, with rebound tenderness and guarding. There are no obviously palpable masses and
vaginal examination has not been carried out.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 36
Any woman who is unwell with abdominal pain should be assumed to have a ruptured
ectopic pregnancy. In this case there are risk factors and the symptoms of dizziness, nausea, severe abdominal pain and shoulder pain are classical of haemoperitoneum. The
examination findings of cool and clammy peripheries, a distended abdomen, tachycardia
and hypotension also suggest the clinical diagnosis and a positive pregnancy test confirms
this.
Young women tend to compensate for hypovolaemia, and the fact that this woman is now
cool and clammy with hypotension suggests that she is gravely unwell and should be
transferred for definitive management without delay.
Although the haemoglobin does not seem dramatically reduced, it is likely that on repeat
testing it may now be extremely low.

Management
The anaesthetist, theatre staff and senior gynaecologist should be alerted immediately and
the woman transferred to theatre for surgery. An ultrasound is not necessary and would
increase the threat to this woman by increasing the delay in reaching theatre.

!

Key initial management for suspected ruptured ectopic pregnancy

•
•
•
•
•
•

Facial oxygen
Lie flat with head down
Two large-bore cannulae with 2 L of intravenous fluids given immediately
Crossmatch 4 units (and alert haematologist to the haemorrhage)
Consent for laparotomy and salpingectomy
Transfer to theatre for salpingectomy

Ruptured ectopic pregnancy is still the leading cause of maternal death in early pregnancy, and doctors must be alert to the occasional presentation with life-threatening
haemorrhage, as in this case.

KEY POINTS

• Ectopic pregnancy is still a significant cause of early-pregnancy maternal death.
• Any woman of reproductive age who is unwell with abdominal pain and a positive
pregnancy test should be assumed to have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

• Preoperative ultrasound is not indicated if ectopic rupture is suspected.

CASE 37: URINARY RETENTION
History
A 29-year-old woman presents to the emergency department having been unable to pass
urine for 8 h. For the last 3 days she has been feeling unwell with a fever, shivering and a
reduced appetite. She has pain in her groins specifically but says that her whole body
aches. Yesterday she began to feel pain on passing urine, and today this has became very
severe such that now she cannot micturate at all. She has never experienced any episodes
like this before. She has no previous medical or gynaecology history and has regular menstrual cycles. She recently ended a long-term relationship and has been with a new partner
for a few months, with whom she uses condoms.
Examination
The woman is obviously in significant discomfort. Her temperature is 37.4°C, heart rate
102/min and blood pressure 118/80 mmHg. Bilateral tender inguinal lymphadenopathy is
noted and axillary lymph nodes are also palpable. The bladder is palpable midway to the
umbilicus. The vulva is generally reddened and there is a cluster of ulcerated lesions of
approximately 2–5 mm on the left side of the labia minora. Speculum examination shows
the cervix is inflamed with a profuse exudate.

91

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 37
The woman is demonstrating a classic presentation of primary herpes simplex virus infection. Prodromal ‘flu type symptoms and generalized lymphadenopathy usually occur most
significantly with primary infection, and any subsequent attacks are more likely to present with vulval soreness as the only noticeable feature.

!

Herpes simplex features

• Primary infection:
• general malaise
• fever
• anorexia
• lymphadenopathy
• genital blisters
• urinary retention
• Recurrent (secondary) infection:
• genital blisters
• often occurs at times of stress or tiredness
The woman probably acquired the infection from her new partner – condoms do not effectively prevent spread as the organism can spread from the perineum. In this case there is
also evidence of herpes cervicitis from spread of virus particles into the vagina.

Further investigation
Vulval viral swab should be sent to confirm the diagnosis. This requires firm rubbing of
the swab onto an ulcer and is very painful, but as the diagnosis has such profound social
implications, confirmation of the diagnosis is imperative.
Management
• Immediate management:
• the woman should have an indwelling (preferably suprapubic) urinary catheter
inserted immediately and be given analgesia and paracetamol
• local anaesthetic gel often relieves the pain and can be used until symptoms settle
• oral aciclovir started within 24 h of an attack reduces the severity and duration of
the episode.
• Further management:
• referral to a health counsellor should be made to discuss the diagnosis and its
implications
• some women have many recurrent attacks, whereas others never experience a further episode. For recurrent attacks aciclovir may be given again if commenced
within 24 h of becoming unwell.
KEY POINTS

• Genital herpes simplex infection has a major psychosexual and social impact on
sufferers.

• The first attack is generally severe and associated with primarily systemic features.
• Recurrent episodes may be hardly noticed; transmission may occur prior to the
•

92

appearance of blisters and condoms do not prevent spread of disease and so it is
difficult to limit.
Aciclovir does not cure the disease but is effective at reducing the duration and severity
of an episode.

CASE 38: ABDOMINAL PAIN
History
A 14-year-old girl presents with lower abdominal pain which developed suddenly a day
ago. The pain is over the whole lower abdomen but worse on the right. It was intermittent
at first but is now constant and very severe. She feels unwell in herself with no appetite
and vomiting. She now feels sweaty as well.
She says her bowels opened normally the day before and they are normally regular.
She has never had any previous episode of pain like this. Her last menstrual period started
2 weeks ago and she has a slightly irregular cycle. She has never had any gynaecological
or other medical problems in the past.

Examination
On examination she looks in pain and seems to find it difficult to get comfortable. Her temperature is 37.9°C, pulse 112/min and blood pressure 116/74 mmHg. She feels warm and
well perfused. The abdomen is distended symmetrically with generalized tenderness, maximal in the right iliac fossa region. There is rebound and guarding in the right iliac fossa.

93

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 38
The differential diagnosis of right iliac fossa pain in this case is:
• gynaecological:
• adnexal/ovarian cyst torsion
• ovarian cyst rupture
• ovarian cyst haemorrhage
• ectopic pregnancy
• surgical:
• appendicitis
• urinary:
• urinary tract infection
• renal colic
The girl is acutely systemically unwell with an acute abdomen which would favour the
diagnosis of torsion or possibly ruptured appendix. Cyst rupture and haemorrhage are not
commonly associated with such systemic disturbance, though this is an important differential diagnosis.
Further investigation would include a pregnancy test to exclude pregnancy, and urinalysis to exclude urinary tract infection or renal colic. An ultrasound should be arranged
(transabdominal) to assess for an ovarian cyst or for an inflamed appendix. If an adnexal
mass is confirmed, laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed as soon as possible
since adnexal torsion is associated with loss of the ovarian function if ischaemia is prolonged and necrosis occurs. Ovarian torsion can often be managed by detorsion, though
oophorectomy sometimes may be necessary.
If the diagnosis is not clear between appendicitis and ovarian torsion then joint laparotomy or laparoscopy with the surgical team is an appropriate approach.
KEY POINTS

• Suspected ovarian torsion is a gynaecological emergency.
• Torsion is relatively common in young girls and teenagers.
• Ultrasound is useful in detection of an adnexal mass but torsion is a clinically suspected
diagnosis and necessitates urgent laparoscopy or laparotomy.

CASE 39: ABDOMINAL PAIN
History
A 24-year-old student is referred to the gynaecologist on call from the emergency department with sudden-onset of left iliac fossa pain which woke her at 2 am. She fell asleep
again but since 8 am the pain has been constant and is not relieved by ibuprofen or codydramol.
Her last period started 2 weeks ago and she reports no irregular bleeding or discharge.
She has no significant gynaecological history except for a termination of pregnancy age
17 years. She has been with her current boyfriend for 2 years and has used the combined
oral contraceptive pill (COCP) throughout that time. She says she has not had intercourse
for the last 4 months because her boyfriend has been travelling, but says that intercourse
has never been painful.
On direct questioning she has felt nauseated but has not vomited. She has had no urinary
symptoms but has opened her bowels several times each day for the last 3 days, which is
unusual for her.

Examination
On examination she is apyrexial, her observations are normal and her abdomen is soft
with vague left iliac fossa tenderness but no signs of peritonism. Bimanual examination
reveals a normal-sized uterus with no adnexal tenderness or cervical excitation and no
obvious adnexal masses.

Questions
• What is the first investigation you would like to perform?
• What is your differential diagnosis if this test is negative, and how would you rule out
some of these diagnoses?

95

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 39
Any woman of reproductive age with abdominal pain should always have a urinary pregnancy test, regardless of the date of her last menstrual period. In this case the test is
negative.
The remaining differential diagnoses include:

•
•
•
•

ovarian cyst
pelvic inflammatory disease
urinary tract infection or stone
bowel-related cause.

There are no specific gynaecological symptoms or adnexal tenderness, which implies that
the pain is not gynaecological in origin. However, during speculum examination it is prudent to send swabs for chlamydial and gonorrhoeal infection opportunistically, in view of
the high background prevalence of sexually transmitted infection, especially in the
18–25-year-old age group.
Ovulation pain (mittelschmirtz) or a corpus luteal cyst are very unlikely as the COCP
inhibits the ovulatory cycle. However, a transvaginal ultrasound scan will rule out an
ovarian cyst for certain.
Urine should be dipped for blood to rule out a renal stone, and for leucocytes and nitrites
to rule out infection.
Bowel habit is altered and the raised C-reactive protein suggests an inflammatory condition. As the onset is acute and not severe, the diagnosis is likely to be gastroenteritis. This
should be managed expectantly, with fluids, rest and simple analgesia. A stool culture
should be sent if the symptoms fail to resolve. Other inflammatory bowel conditions such
as Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are rare causes to consider if the symptoms are
persistent or recurrent.
Irritable bowel syndrome is not associated with raised inflammatory markers, and is therefore not a differential diagnosis in this case.

KEY POINTS

• Gynaecological, urinary and bowel-related pathology can all be associated with lower
abdominal pain.

• A thorough and focused history is always important in making a correct diagnosis.

CASE 40: ABDOMINAL PAIN AND VAGINAL DISCHARGE
History
A 46-year-old Indian woman presents with a month-long history of increasing abdominal pain and a green/yellow vaginal discharge. For the last few days she had been feeling feverish and unwell. The pain is across the lower abdomen but worse on the left. She
has no urinary symptoms and has been opening her bowels normally. She has a reduced
appetite and mild nausea but has not vomited.
She has had two vaginal deliveries in the past and no other pregnancies. She had a laparotomy about 4 years ago for drainage of a pelvic abscess. Recently she has been under the
care of a gynaecologist for heavy and prolonged periods, for which she is taking cyclical
norethisterone. There is no other medical or surgical history of note.

Examination
The temperature is 37.8°C, pulse 95/min and blood pressure is 136/76 mmHg. The
abdomen appears slightly distended and a mass is palpated arising from the pelvis on the

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 40
The woman is acutely unwell with pyrexia, tachycardia, raised inflammatory markers,
neutrophilia and reactive thrombocythaemia. This suggests an infective process and the
left iliac fossa mass detected on ultrasound would appear to be the cause. The likely diagnosis is a tubo-ovarian mass, probably an abscess.
Alternatively this could potentially be a diverticular abscess or, if it were on the right, an
appendix abscess. Ovarian malignancy or another cause of a complex adnexal mass
would be unlikely to present with this acute inflammatory episode.
Anaemia in this woman could be due to chronic menorrhagia or anaemia of chronic disease. The increased mean cell volume suggests the latter, but ferritin and folate levels
would be useful to see whether there is in fact a degree of iron deficiency too.

Further investigations
Blood cultures and vaginal and endocervical swabs should be taken. Ferritin and folate
should be checked.
Management
The woman should be admitted for intravenous antibiotics. Broad-spectrum cover should
be given including agents against anaerobes and chlamydia. In cases of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) there is commonly a mixed growth of anaerobes on top of a previous
chlamydial infection. If improvement does not occur within 24–48 h, or the diagnosis is
unclear, then laparoscopy or laparotomy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis
and drain the abscess surgically.

!

Advice to patients with pelvic inflammatory disease

• The diagnosis (of PID) suggests the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection
either acutely or in the past.

• The partner needs to be screened and treated.
• The couple should avoid intercourse (or use condoms) until both have completed
treatment.

KEY POINTS

• It is common for no organism to be cultured in women with PID.
• A woman with a pelvic abscess due to PID may be given a trial of conservative
treatment prior to surgical drainage.

• Contact tracing is an important part of the management of PID to prevent reinfection
and further spread of infection.

EARLY PREGNANCY
CASE 41: BLEEDING AND PAIN IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 27-year-old woman attends the emergency department with irregular vaginal bleeding
and abdominal discomfort.
She noticed the bleeding 2 days previously and it is dark red, sufficient for her to need to
wear a sanitary towel, but not heavy. The abdominal discomfort is suprapubic and
crampy, slightly more on the right-hand side. She is systemically well with no fever,
change in appetite, nausea or vomiting. She says that her bowel and urinary habits are
normal. Her last menstrual period commenced 45 days previously and she usually has a
slightly irregular cycle, bleeding for 3–5 days every 28–35 days. She has never been pregnant. She has been with her regular sexual partner for 2 years and they generally use condoms but there are some occasions where they do not. She had a sexual health screen 6
months ago at the genitourinary clinic where she was told all her swabs were negative.
She has no previous gynaecological history and no significant previous medical problems.

Examination
The blood pressure is 128/72 mmHg and heart rate is 82/min. The abdomen is soft and nondistended. There is tenderness on deep palpation in the suprapubic and right iliac fossa
regions, but no rebound tenderness or guarding. Bimanual examination is not performed.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinary pregnancy test: positive
Transvaginal ultrasound scan is shown in Fig. 41.1.
The woman is taken for laparoscopy after the ultrasound scan and Fig. 41.2 shows the
findings.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What are the management options in this case?
• How would you counsel the woman postoperatively?
99

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 41
The diagnosis is an ectopic pregnancy. This can be seen from the positive pregnancy test,
ultrasound confirming a pregnancy in the adnexa (with fetal heart beat present in this
case), and laparoscopic confirmation of a distended right uterine tube, showing the typical
bluish bulge. There is no evidence of blood in the pouch of Douglas (haemoperitoneum) to
suggest rupture of the ectopic pregnancy.
Classic symptoms of ectopic pregnancy are amenorrhoea, iliac fossa pain and dark
vaginal bleeding. Ectopic pregnancies are, however, often diagnosed in women with any
combination of symptoms from heavy vaginal bleeding with clots to period-type pain, to
no symptoms at all. Ectopic pregnancies occur in 1–2 per cent of pregnancies and the
majority are diagnosed before rupture but occasionally women still present with collapse
and this is a medical emergency – a woman with collapse and a positive pregnancy test
should be initially assumed to have a ruptured ectopic pregnancy.

Management options
General ectopic pregnancy management options are:
• surgical (salpingectomy or salpingotomy)
• medical (methotrexate injection)
• expectant (wait and see).
In this case, the only option is surgical in view of the fact that a fetal heart beat is present, rendering conservative options both dangerous (because of risk of rupture) and
unlikely to be successful. The ectopic pregnancy should be removed laparoscopically if
possible to minimize hospital stay and postoperative pain and to reduce postoperative
complications including adhesions. If the contralateral tube is healthy, then the tube may
be removed (salpingectomy). If the other is damaged then salpingotomy (incision into the
tube to remove the pregnancy) should be attempted.

!

Postoperative counselling points after ectopic pregnancy

• Explanation of diagnosis and operation
• Appropriate counselling that the woman may grieve (this is the loss of a pregnancy)
with advice about further support

• Avoid the progesterone only contraceptive pill (POP) and intrauterine
•
•
•

contraceptive device (IUCD) (both are associated with a slightly higher risk of
ectopic pregnancy)
Approximately 65–70 per cent of women who have had an ectopic pregnancy go on
to have a live birth following this, but there is a 10–15 per cent chance of a further
ectopic pregnancy
Early transvaginal scan is indicated at around 5 weeks’ gestation to confirm the
location of any future pregnancy
Effective contraception should be used if she does not wish to become pregnant
again at the moment
KEY POINTS

• The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy are highly variable, from no symptoms to pain
and bleeding, to sudden life-threatening collapse.

• Ectopic pregnancy can only be ruled out after positive visualization of an intrauterine
gestation sac.

• ‘Viable’ ectopic pregnancies (where the fetal heart beat is visualized) should always be
treated surgically.

CASE 42: PAIN IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 22-year-old woman attends the emergency department complaining of abdominal pain.
She is 7 weeks 4 days pregnant by certain menstrual dates. She had a normal vaginal
delivery at term 18 months ago. Her periods are usually regular every 27 days, with bleeding for 3–5 days. She has no previous gynaecological history. Her medical history
involves mild asthma and two episodes of cystitis.
The pain started suddenly two nights ago and is localized to the right iliac fossa with some
radiation down the right thigh. It is constant though worse on movement, so she has
tended to lie still. She has not taken any analgesia as she is uncertain whether this is safe
for the baby. She is always constipated and this is worse since she became pregnant. She
has urinary frequency but no dysuria or haematuria. She has a slightly reduced appetite
but does not feel feverish or sweaty.

Examination
Her temperature is 36.4°C, heart rate 90/min and blood pressure 96/58 mmHg. There are
no signs of anaemia and she feels warm and well perfused. She is slim and the abdomen
is not distended. There is focal tenderness on palpation of the right iliac fossa, with slight
rebound tenderness but no guarding. Rovsing’s sign is not present. Speculum examination
is unremarkable. The uterus is bulky and retroverted with no cervical excitation. The right
adnexa is tender with a suggestion of ‘fullness’.

ANSWER 42
The ultrasound shows a single viable intrauterine pregnancy and haemorrhage into a
corpus luteal cyst.

!

Differential diagnosis for pain in early pregnancy

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Corpus luteum
Ectopic pregnancy
Miscarriage
Ovarian cyst
Urinary tract infection
Renal tract calculus
Constipation
Appendicitis
Unexplained pain

Urinary tract infection or calculi are excluded by the urinalysis result. Constipation is more
likely to cause left-sided pain and the sudden onset of pain would perhaps be unusual.
Appendicitis should be considered but the lack of systemic features, the normal temperature, white count and C-reactive protein are suggestive of this not being the diagnosis.
The corpus luteum is the cystic area that develops on the ovary at the ovulation site. It
may be solid, cystic or haemorrhagic and may vary in size. On colour Doppler ultrasound
it has a typical ‘ring of fire’ appearance, distinguishing it from other types of ovarian cyst.
In this case the ‘spider web’ or reticulated pattern of echoes within the cyst suggests that
it is haemorrhagic.

Management
Management is supportive with analgesia (paracetamol in the first instance followed by
codeine derivatives if necessary) and reassurance. There is no evidence that bleeding into
the corpus luteum adversely affects the pregnancy outcome. As the cyst is so large, it may
be sensible to repeat an ultrasound scan in 2–4 weeks to confirm resolution.

KEY POINTS

• A large or haemorrhagic corpus luteum is a common cause of early-pregnancy pain.
• Most women have no cause found for early pregnancy pain.
• Ectopic pregnancy must be excluded and non-gynaecological aetiology considered
(constipation or urinary tract infection) in women with pain in early pregnancy.

CASE 43: EARLY PREGNANCY ULTRASOUND
History
A 25-year-old woman is referred by the general practitioner (GP) for early pregnancy dating ultrasound scan. She is gravida 4 para 2. Her first positive pregnancy test was 4 days
ago and she went to her GP to arrange a termination of pregnancy as she feels that she
cannot cope with another child. She has been taking the combined oral contraceptive pill
(COCP), so pregnancy could not be dated clinically. She has no significant gynaecological
history of note except for an episode of chlamydia aged 18 years, for which she and her
partner were fully treated. As a child she had a ruptured appendix and needed a midline
laparotomy. She has no other relevant past medical history.
She has had no pain though did note some moderate vaginal bleeding 2 weeks before for
3 days, which settled spontaneously.

Examination
She looks well with normal heart rate and blood pressure and a soft non-tender abdomen.
Speculum examination shows a closed cervix with a normal discharge and no blood. The
uterus feels normal size and is anteverted and mobile. There is no cervical excitation.
There is slight tenderness in the left adnexa but no masses are palpable.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound findings are shown in Fig. 43.1.

Figure 43.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan.

Questions
• How would you interpret this ultrasound scan result?
Serial serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) and progesterone is requested and
the results are as follows:
Day 1: serum HCG 703 IU/L, progesterone 30 nmol/L
Day 3: serum HCG 905 IU/L, progesterone 24 nmol/L
• What is the likely diagnosis and the differential diagnosis, and how would you further
investigate and manage this woman?
105

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 43
The transvaginal ultrasound scan shows an empty uterus and no adnexal masses. This is
therefore termed a pregnancy of unknown location (PUL).

!

Definition of a pregnancy of unknown location

• No signs of either intra- or extrauterine pregnancy or retained products of
conception in a woman with a positive pregnancy test

PUL occurs in up to 20 per cent of women in early pregnancy units and the possible
underlying diagnoses are:
• early intrauterine pregnancy: too early to be visualized on ultrasound
• failed pregnancy: a complete miscarriage where the pregnancy has been completely
expelled but where no previous scan is available to confirm that an intrauterine
pregnancy had been present
• ectopic pregnancy: the pregnancy is located outside the uterine cavity but has not
been visualized at initial ultrasound examination.
Only 10 per cent of PULs are subsequently diagnosed as ectopic pregnancies, but all must
be investigated with serial serum HCG to determine which of the above three diagnoses is
likely.

Serum HCG results and management
The HCG at which an intrauterine pregnancy would normally be visualized is
1000–1500 IU/L (in most but not all cases). A normal early pregnancy would generally
show an increase in HCG of over 66 per cent in each 48 h. The progesterone level is
usually high (⬎60 nmol/L) in an ongoing pregnancy and low (⬍25 nmol/L) in a failing
pregnancy.
In this case the suboptimal HCG rise and mid-range progesterone are typical (but not
diagnostic) of an ectopic pregnancy, and the woman should have a repeat ultrasound
within a few days. If an ectopic pregnancy is visualized then medical or surgical management should depend on signs and symptoms. If a pregnancy is still not visualized and she
becomes symptomatic then laparoscopy is indicated to establish the diagnosis. If HCG
continues to rise with no apparent pregnancy visible, then methotrexate for persistent
PUL may be considered.

KEY POINTS

• Pregnancy of unknown location may represent an early intrauterine pregnancy,
complete miscarriage or an ectopic pregnancy.

• Follow-up HCG and ultrasound must be arranged for these women.
• If pain develops before a diagnosis is confirmed, laparoscopy should be carried out to
exclude an ectopic pregnancy.

CASE 44: PREGNANCY DATING
History
A woman is referred from the general practitioner for pregnancy dating. She had a positive pregnancy test 3 days ago after she realized that she had missed a period. In the past
she had had regular cycles bleeding for 5 days every 28 days. However she had been taking the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for the last 6 years and stopped only
10 weeks ago. She had a withdrawal bleed at the end of the last packet, followed by an
apparently normal period 5 weeks later. She has had no other irregular bleeding or any
abdominal pain. She has had regular intercourse throughout the time since she stopped
her COCP and is pleased now to be pregnant.

INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound findings are shown in Fig. 44.1.

Figure 44.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan.

Questions
• How can pregnancies be dated and what is the approximate gestational age for this
pregnancy?
• What further investigations would you like to do to confirm this?
• Why is correct early pregnancy dating important?

107

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 44
Pregnancy dating methods
• Dating by crown–rump length: from 6 weeks and 2 days an estimate of gestational
age can be made by crown–rump length of the fetus according to published reference
values.
• Dating by last menstrual period:
• in women with certain last menstrual period dates (LMP) and a regular cycle,
Naegle’s rule may be applied, whereby the estimated delivery date is calculated by
(LMP date – 3 months) ⫹ 7 days ⫹ 1 year
• Naegle’s rule cannot be applied where the cycle is not regular or there has been a
pregnancy or hormonal contraception within the last 3 months.
• Dating by bimanual examination: pregnancy dating by bimanual examination is very
rarely performed as it is unnecessarily invasive and inaccurate.

!

Transvaginal markers in early pregnancy

• 4–5 weeks: appearance of gestation sac (anechoic area asymmetrically located
within the endometrium towards the fundus of the uterus)

• 5 weeks: appearance of yolk sac (a small round structure within the gestation sac
supporting the fetus until the placenta develops, then disappears by 11 weeks)

• 6 weeks: appearance of a fetal pole with a visible fetal heart pulsation within the
gestation sac, separate from the yolk sac

• 7–8 weeks: appearance of the amniotic sac, which later fuses to the chorionic
membrane to become invisible on scan by 12 weeks

• 8 weeks: appearance of fetal limb buds and fetal movements

The ultrasound shows an intrauterine gestation sac and a yolk sac, so in this case the pregnancy is approximately 5 weeks’ gestation. This should be confirmed by re-scan (after at
least 2 weeks) when a fetal pole will be visible and crown–rump length can be measured.
The importance of accurate dating is:
• timing of Down’s syndrome screening
• accurate gestational age estimation for cases of delivery at the borderline of viability
(e.g. preterm delivery at 22–24 weeks)
• timing of induction of labour for post-term pregnancy.

KEY POINTS

• Women with uncertain LMP should be offered early first-trimester ultrasound
examination to estimate gestational age.

• Standardized dating charts exist incorporating crown–rump length measurement until
14 weeks and head, femur and abdominal measurements thereafter.

• Re-scan for viability and measurement of crown–rump length is needed if the
gestational sac is small and no fetus is present.

108

Early pregnancy

CASE 45: PAIN AND BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 30-year-old woman is referred from her general practitioner. She is 11 weeks and 2 days
gestation and has noticed dark spotting and mild period-like pains for the last 4 days. Her
last period was 4 months ago but she has a history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and
has an irregular cycle bleeding for 4–7 days every 5–6 weeks. She had a positive home
pregnancy test because she noticed breast tenderness, and came for a dating ultrasound
scan 4 weeks ago that confirmed a viable single intrauterine pregnancy. Since then she
has had a booking visit with the midwife and all routine blood tests are normal. She is
gravida 2 para 0. Her last pregnancy 9 months ago ended in a complete miscarriage at
7 weeks. There is no other medical or gynaecological history of significance.
Examination
She is apyrexial with normal heart rate and blood pressure. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Speculum examination shows a small cervical ectropion but this is not bleeding.
The cervix is closed and no blood or abnormal discharge is seen. Bimanual examination
reveals an 8–10-week-sized anteverted mobile uterus with no cervical excitation, adnexal
masses or tenderness.
INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound scan report (Fig. 45.1): the uterus contains a gestational sac
measuring 49 ⫻ 48 ⫻ 36 mm. A single fetus of crown–rump length 47 mm is visible.
Fetal heart beat is absent. The uterus is anteverted. Both ovaries appear normal with no
adnexal masses visible.

Figure 45.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you investigate and manage this patient?

109

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 45
The diagnosis is of a missed miscarriage. The alternative terminology for this condition is
delayed miscarriage, silent miscarriage or early fetal demise.
The diagnosis can be made for two reasons. First the fetal heart beat has been seen previously
and is no longer visible. Second, where the crown–rump length exceeds 6 mm, a fetal
heart beat should be visible on transvaginal ultrasound in all cases of a viable pregnancy.
Thus the diagnosis could have been made even if the previous scan result was not known.
The term ‘empty sac’ (blighted ovum or anembyonic pregnancy) is used where the pregnancy
has failed at a much earlier stage, such that the embryo did not become large enough to
be visualized, but a sac is still seen. The diagnosis of an empty gestational sac can be made
when the mean sac diameter exceeds 20 mm with no visible fetal pole (fetus). This is illustrated in Fig. 45.2. The management of missed miscarriage and empty sac is the same.

Figure 45.2 Transvaginal ultrasound
image demonstrating an empty
gestational sac with mean sac diameter
greater than 20 mm, confirming the
diagnosis of miscarriage.

Management
The woman needs to discuss how to proceed now and also what has happened and what
she might expect for future pregnancies. The management of miscarriage is expectant,
medical or surgical. The choice should be given with the potential advantages and disadvantages of each:
• expectant (‘wait and see’ approach):
• avoids medical intervention and can be managed completely at home
• may involve significant pain and bleeding
• unpredictable time frame – miscarriage may even take several weeks
• more successful for incomplete miscarriage than for missed miscarriage
• medical (oral mifepristone followed 48h later by misoprostol intravaginal tablets):
• avoids surgical intervention and general anaesthetic
• the woman may retain some feeling of being in control
• equivalent infection and bleeding rate as for surgical management (2–3 per cent)
• surgical evacuation may be indicated if medical management fails
• surgical (evacuation of retained products of conception):
• can be arranged within a few days and avoids prolonged follow-up
• very low rate of failure (retained products of conception)
• small risk of uterine perforation or anaesthetic complication.
110

Early pregnancy

Success rates for missed miscarriage are generally greater for medical or surgical management, whereas expectant management is very successful for incomplete miscarriage.

!

Important counselling points after miscarriage

• Express sympathy – this is a very significant event for the couple and they may
perceive the pregnancy loss as strongly as they would the loss of a full-term baby.

• Offer further counselling if needed and give written advice sheets/leaflets.
• Reassure that the miscarriage would not have been a result of anything she has

•
•

done, such as lifting heavy objects, having a glass of alcohol or having sexual
intercourse (all common reasons for women to feel they are responsible for the
loss).
Explain that over 60 per cent of fetal losses are due to sporadic chromosomal
abnormalities such as trisomies.
Explain that although she has had two consecutive fetal losses there is still a high
chance (⬎70 per cent) that she will have a normal pregnancy in the future.

Further investigation into recurrent miscarriage is usually reserved for those with three or
more consecutive losses, because miscarriage is extremely common and those couples with
two miscarriages are extremely unlikely to have any underlying cause of miscarriage.

KEY POINTS

• Most miscarriages are due to sporadic fetal chromosomal abnormalities.
• A ‘missed’ miscarriage may be managed expectantly, medically or surgically.
• Never forget that a miscarriage may be a significant life event for a woman/couple,
regardless of whether or not the pregnancy was planned.

Early pregnancy

CASE 46: BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 36-year-old woman presents with vaginal bleeding at 8 weeks 3 days’ gestation. She
has never been pregnant before. Bright red ‘spotting’ commenced 7 days ago, which she
thought was normal in early pregnancy. However since then the bleeding is now almost
as heavy as a period. There are no clots. She has no abdominal pain. Systemically she has
felt nausea for 3 weeks and has vomited occasionally. She had large-loop excision of the
transformation zone (LLETZ) treatment after an abnormal smear 6 years ago. Since then
all smears have been normal. There is no other significant gynaecological history. She has
regular periods bleeding for 5 days every 28 days, and has never had any known sexually
transmitted infections. In the past she used condoms for contraception.
Examination
The heart rate is 68/min and blood pressure is 108/70 mmHg. The abdomen is soft and
non-tender. Speculum reveals a normal closed cervix with a small amount of fresh blood
coming from the cervical canal. Bimanually the uterus feels bulky and soft, approximately
10 weeks in size. There is no cervical excitation or adnexal tenderness.

INVESTIGATIONS
Urinary pregnancy test: positive
Figure 46.1 shows the transvaginal ultrasound findings.

Figure 46.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan of the uterus.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis?
• What would one expect to see at scan in this woman if the pregnancy was normal?
• How would you manage the patient?

113

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 46
The ultrasound scan shows a mixed echogenicity appearance in the uterus, typical of a
complete hydatidiform mole (molar pregnancy, part of the spectrum of gestational trophoblastic disease). There is no recognizable gestational sac or fetus.
This appearance may also be seen occasionally in pregnancies where early fetal demise
has occurred but the sac has not been expelled (delayed miscarriage) resulting in cystic
degeneration of the placenta.
The incidence of hydatidiform mole (also known as gestational trophoblastic disease)
is approximately 1 in 714. It generally presents with painless vaginal bleeding though it
may be diagnosed as an incidental finding when ultrasound is performed for another
indication. The classical associations with hyperemesis, thyrotoxicosis or pre-eclampsia
are rarely seen in the developed world where diagnosis is generally made in the first
trimester.

Normal findings at 8 weeks
The normal findings at 8 weeks would be a fetus of approximately 18 mm, with a positive
fetal heart beat. The yolk sac would still be visible and the amniotic sac would also be
seen. The fetus would be beginning to develop visible arm and limb buds and fetal movement may be seen.
Figure 46.2 shows a transvaginal image of a normal 8-week gestation sac and fetus.

Figure 46.2 Transvaginal image of a
normal 8-week gestation sac and fetus
(yolk sac not visible in this view).

Further management
The management for suspected molar pregnancy is always evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC), with urgent histological examination of the tissue.
Once diagnosis is confirmed by histology, any woman with a confirmed partial or complete mole should be referred to a specialist gestational trophoblastic disease centre (in the
UK in Sheffield, Dundee and Charing Cross Hospital) for follow-up of human chorionic
gonadotrophin (HCG) levels. Women with persistently raised HCG levels are offered
chemotherapy to destroy the persistent trophoblastic tissue and minimize the chance of
development of choriocarcinoma.
114

Early pregnancy

Most women however do not require chemotherapy as the HCG becomes negative within
a short period of time. These women should be advised:
• not to become pregnant again until 6 months after the HCG is normal
• there is a 1 in 84 chance of a further molar pregnancy
• they should have HCG monitoring after any subsequent pregnancy (whether live birth,
fetal loss or termination)
• the combined oral contraceptive pill may safely be used once HCG has returned to
normal (previous advice was to wait for 6 months).

KEY POINTS

• Molar pregnancy may be suspected on ultrasound examination but the diagnosis must
be confirmed with histological examination of products of conception after ERPC.

• Molar pregnancies must be followed up at a specialist gestational trophoblastic disease
centre.

• Development of choriocarcinoma after molar pregnancy is rare, but persistent
trophoblastic disease requiring chemotherapy is more common.

CASE 47: BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 31-year-old woman presents with vaginal bleeding at 5 weeks 6 days’ gestation. She
has had a previous left uterine tubal ectopic pregnancy managed with laparoscopic salpingectomy. She is certain of her last menstrual period date and has regular cycles. Her last
smear test was normal and she has not used contraception since her last pregnancy
3 years ago.
When she was 21 years she had an episode of pelvic inflammatory disease treated with
intravenous antibiotics. She is otherwise not aware of having had any sexually transmitted infections. She has been with her partner for 7 years. She smokes 10 cigarettes per day
and does not drink alcohol. The bleeding is described as very light and she has not been
aware of any pain. She has not felt dizzy or lightheaded and has no shoulder-tip pain.
Examination
She is warm and well perfused. The blood pressure is 136/78 mmHg and heart rate 75/min.
The abdomen is not distended and no tenderness is elicited on palpation. The cervix is
closed. The uterus feels normal size, anteverted and mobile, and there is no cervical excitation. Gentle adnexal examination shows no significant tenderness.

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 47
The ultrasound scan shows an empty uterus and an adnexal mass adjacent to the right
ovary. The mass represents an ectopic pregnancy. No gestation sac or fetal pole is visible
and the pregnancy is therefore not considered ‘viable’. However there is still a possibility
of rupture if not treated.

!

Risk factors for ectopic pregnancy

•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Smoking
Previous pelvic inflammatory disease or chlamydial infection
History of infertility
In vitro fertilization
Previous tubal surgery
Previous ectopic pregnancy
Intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) or progesterone only pill

Management
Three options might be appropriate to this woman:
• surgical: laparoscopic excision of the tube (salpingectomy) or salpingotomy to incise
the tube and flush out the ectopic pregnancy
• medical: intramuscular methotrexate to destroy the rapidly dividing trophoblast tissue,
with regular HCG follow-up to confirm resolution
• expectant: ‘wait and see’ approach, suitable if the HCG at 48 h is decreasing
spontaneously and the woman remains asymptomatic.
In this case the woman has previously had a uterine tube removed and surgery might
compromise the remaining tube, so methotrexate treatment is preferred. However if the
tube is damaged but preserved, she may be at high risk of further ectopic pregnancy.
Prerequisites for methotrexate are normal full blood count, renal and liver function before
treatment, compliance with the intense follow-up, and understanding the need not to
become pregnant again for at least 3 months due to the potential teratogenic effects.
Potential side-effects are abdominal pain (sometimes difficult to distinguish from pain
suggestive of tubal rupture), nausea, diarrhoea and, rarely, conjunctivitis and stomatitis.

KEY POINTS

• Ectopic pregnancies are commonly asymptomatic or associated with atypical symptoms.
• Surgical, medical or expectant management of ectopic pregnancy depend on the
symptoms, signs and HCG result.

• Methotrexate is effective but follow-up is intensive and sometimes prolonged.

CASE 48: BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 41-year-old woman is seen in the early pregnancy unit because of vaginal bleeding.
She is gravida 4 para 2 having had two previous normal vaginal deliveries followed by a
miscarriage. She has a regular 28-day menstrual cycle and her last period started 9 weeks
ago. She had slight vaginal bleeding two weeks ago and on ultrasound scan an early
intrauterine pregnancy had been visualized with gestational sac of 18 ⫻ 12 ⫻ 22 mm
diameter and a yolk sac visualized of 4 ⫻ 5 ⫻ 5 mm. No fetus was visualized. She was
given an appointment for a repeat ultrasound.
Four days ago her bleeding became very heavy and she passed large clots which she
described as ‘like liver’. She developed severe abdominal pain which lasted for about 4 h,
and since then the bleeding has become very light and she is now pain free.
She has normal appetite and no nausea or vomiting. She has no urinary or bowel symptoms.

Examination
She appears well and is apyrexial. There are no signs of anaemia. The heart rate is 82/min
and blood pressure is 132/78 mmHg. The abdomen is soft and mildly tender suprapubically. Speculum shows the cervix is closed with a small amount of old blood in the vagina.
There is slight uterine tenderness on bimanual palpation and the uterus feels normal size,
anteverted and mobile, with no adnexal tenderness or cervical excitation.

INVESTIGATIONS
A transvaginal ultrasound scan is shown in Fig. 48.1.

scan.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What further management is indicated?

119

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 48
The ultrasound image shows a longitudinal view of the uterus with a thin homogenous
endometrium and no evidence of a gestation sac or retained products of conception. As
we know from the previous report that there was previously an intrauterine pregnancy, we
can conclude that this is a complete miscarriage. If a previous ultrasound had not been
available we would need to treat the case as a pregnancy of unknown location and monitor serial serum HCG.
No further management is needed as the miscarriage is complete and there are no signs of
retained products of conception, or any suggestion of sepsis. Anti-D is not needed even if
the woman is Rhesus negative as the pregnancy is less than 12 weeks’ gestation.
Counselling is the most important part of this consultation, as explained in case 45.
There is no clear evidence that a longer interpregnancy interval improves the outcome in
future pregnancies, and the couple should be informed that they may try and conceive
whenever they choose. However, it may be advisable to wait until after the next menstrual
period (usually 4–6 weeks after a miscarriage) in order to date the pregnancy.
Reassurance scans are helpful in future pregnancies and may improve outcome. In view
of the two consecutive losses, reassurance ultrasound at 7 weeks and then at intervals
until the 11–14-week scan would be ideal.

KEY POINTS

• Clinical suspicion alone is not sufficient to make a diagnosis of miscarriage.
• If the uterus is empty and an intrauterine gestation has not been previously confirmed
•

120

then a case should be treated as a pregnancy of unknown location, with serial HCG
follow-up.
Appropriate counselling is vital in the management of couples with early pregnancy
loss.

Early pregnancy

CASE 49: PAIN IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 39-year-old woman presents with left iliac fossa pain in pregnancy. The pain is intermittent and cramping. She has had difficulty sleeping because of the pain, but has not
taken any analgesia, as she is afraid that this may affect the baby. There is no vaginal
bleeding.
The woman has a long history of secondary infertility. She had a spontaneous vaginal
delivery at term 9 years ago, and started trying to conceive again soon after. She was
investigated a year ago and found to have polycystic ovarian syndrome and was therefore
commenced on clomifene citrate. This was her third cycle, her last menstrual period
started 45 days ago and she had a positive pregnancy test 4 days ago.

Examination
The woman is apyrexial with normal blood pressure and heart rate. She is overweight
(body mass index 32 kg/m2) and therefore examination is limited but there is some tenderness on deep palpation in the left adnexa. On bimanual examination the uterus is normal size and anteverted. There is some left adnexal tenderness but no obvious masses are
palpable.

INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound findings are shown in Fig. 49.1.

Figure 49.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan.

Questions
• What can you infer about the pregnancy from this ultrasound?
• What are the differential diagnoses for the pain?
• How would you further investigate and manage this patient?

121

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 49
Two distinct echolucent areas are visible within the endometrium. Each has a bright trophoblastic ring around confirming that these are gestation sacs. Neither sac demonstrates
a definite yolk sac or fetal pole. The findings suggest a twin pregnancy with gestational
age of 4–5 weeks, and this is consistent with the woman’s last menstrual period date. The
sacs are distinct and therefore the pregnancy will definitely be dichorionic diamniotic.
Zygosity cannot be determined by this ultrasound as both dizygotic pregnancy and a
monozygotic embryo that split prior to implantation would give this appearance.
Differential diagnosis of pain in this woman is:
• gynaecological:
• corpus luteal cyst
• other non-pregnancy-related incidental ovarian cyst
• ovarian hyperstimulation (a rare complication of clomifene treatment)
• non-gynaecological:
• constipation
• gastroenteritis
• urinary tract infection
• renal tract calculus.
Ectopic pregnancy is ruled out as the ultrasound confirms an intrauterine pregnancy.
Pelvic inflammatory disease is extremely uncommon in pregnancy as is irritable bowel
syndrome.

Further investigation
The woman should be asked about constipation or loose stools, urinary frequency, dysuria
or loin pain. Urinalysis for blood (suggestive of calculus) or nitrates/leucocytes (suggestive of infection) should be performed with midstream urine sent for microscopy, culture
and sensitivity if positive.
The adnexae should normally be examined during the ultrasound examination. A corpus
luteum is a very common cause of pain in early pregnancy and shows a typical peripheral
blood flow pattern resembling a ‘ring of fire’ on colour Doppler examination. Corpora
lutea resolve spontaneously by 12 weeks’ gestation.
Other ovarian cysts would also be easily seen on ultrasound – most can be safely managed expectantly in pregnancy unless there is a suspicion of malignancy, torsion or symptoms are severe. Ovarian hyperstimulation is also easily recognized on ultrasound scan.
If the urinalysis is negative, there is no suggestive history of a bowel problem and the
adnexae appear normal, then reassurance should be given and the patient discharged.

KEY POINTS

• Gynaecological and non-gynaecological problems are common causes of pain in early
pregnancy and should be investigated once an ectopic pregnancy has been ruled out.

• Corpus luteal cyst is probably the commonest gynaecological cause of early-pregnancy
pain and is managed conservatively with analgesia and reassurance.

CASE 50: VOMITING IN PREGNANCY
History
A 28-year-old Asian woman is referred by her general practitioner (GP) with persistent
vomiting at 7 weeks’ gestation. She is in her second pregnancy having had a normal vaginal delivery 3 years ago. She is now vomiting up to 10 times in 24 h, and has not managed to tolerate any food for 3 days. She can only drink small amounts of water.
She saw her GP a week ago who prescribed prochlorperazine suppositories but these only
helped for a few days. She feels very weak in herself and is unable to care for her son now.
On direct questioning she has upper abdominal pain that is constant, sharp and burning.
She has not opened her bowels for 5 days. She is passing small amounts of dark urine
infrequently but there is no dysuria or haematuria. There has been no vaginal bleeding.
There is no other medical or gynaecological history of note except that she suffered persistent vomiting in her first pregnancy requiring two overnight admissions.

Examination
She is apyrexial. Lying blood pressure is 115/68 mmHg and standing blood pressure
98/55 mmHg. Heart rate is 96/min. The mucus membranes appear dry. Abdominal examination reveals tenderness in the epigastrium but no lower abdominal tenderness. The
uterus is not palpable abdominally.

123

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 50
The woman is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum. This affects only less than 2 per cent
of pregnancies, although more than 50 per cent of women report some nausea or vomiting when pregnant.

!

Definition of hyperemesis gravidarum
Severe or protracted vomiting appearing for the first time before the 20th week of
pregnancy that is not associated with other coincidental conditions and is of such
severity as to require the patient’s admission to hospital.

!

Differential diagnosis of vomiting in early pregnancy

•
•
•
•

Urinary tract infection
Gastroenteritis
Thyrotoxicosis
Hepatitis

The diagnosis in this case can be made because the urinalysis is negative apart from the
ketones, so urinary tract infection is very unlikely. She has not opened her bowels but this
is likely to be secondary to poor dietary intake and dehydration. Liver function is normal,
so liver disease causing vomiting is unlikely (though abnormal liver function may occur
as a result of hyperemesis itself). Thyroid function is normal, so an alternative diagnosis
of hyperthyroidism causing the vomiting is unlikely.

!

Complications of hyperemesis gravidarum

•
•
•
•

Wernicke’s encephalopathy (from vitamin B deficiency)
Korsakoff’s syndrome (from vitamin B, deficiency)
Haematemesis (from Mallory–Weiss tear)
Psychological – resentment towards the pregnancy and expression of desire to
terminate the pregnancy

The fetus is not at risk from hyperemesis and the nutritional deficiency in the mother does
not seem to affect development. The risk of miscarriage is lower in women with hyperemesis. The risk of twins and molar pregnancy has traditionally been thought to be greater
in women with hyperemesis, but this is refuted in more recent research.

Further investigation and management
Hyperemesis is a self-limiting disease and the aim of treatments is supportive, with
discharge of the woman once she is tolerating food and drink and is no longer ketotic on
urinalysis.
• Fluids: 3–4L of normal saline should be infused per day. Dextrose solutions are
contraindicated as they may precipitate Wernicke’s encephaolopathy and also because
the woman is hyponatraemic and needs normal saline.
124

Early pregnancy

• Potassium: excessive vomiting generally leads to hypokalaemia, and potassium
chloride should be administered with the normal saline according to the serum
electrolyte results.
• Anti-emetics: first-line antiemetics include cyclizine (antihistamine), metoclopramide
(dopamine anatagonist) or prochlorperazine (phenothiazine). In severe cases,
ondansetron or domperidone may be effective. There is no evidence of teratogenicity
in humans from any of these regimes.
• Thiamine and folic acid: vitamin B1 (thiamine) can prevent Wernicke’s encephalopathy
or the irreversible Korsakoff’s syndrome (amnesia, confabulation, impaired learning
ability).
• Antacids: for epigastric pain
• Total parenteral nutrition (TPN): TPN is rarely indicated but may be life saving where
all other management strategies have failed.
• Thromboembolic stockings (TEDS) and heparin: women with hyperemesis are at risk of
thrombosis from pregnancy, immobility and dehydration, and should be considered for
low-molecular-weight heparin regime as well as TEDS.

Monitoring
Daily monitoring should be carried out, with weight measurement and urinalysis for
ketones and renal and liver function.

KEY POINTS

•
•
•
•

Hyperemesis gravidarum is a diagnosis of exclusion.
There is no adverse effect on the fetus.
Treatment is supportive.
Thiamine replacement prevents Wernicke’s encephalopathy and Korsakoff’s syndrome.

CASE 51: BLEEDING IN EARLY PREGNANCY
History
A 23-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner with vaginal bleeding. She
noticed that there was blood on the toilet paper 2 days ago, and following this she has had
bright red spotting intermittently. She has no pain and there are no urinary or bowel
symptoms.
Her last menstrual period started 9 weeks and 6 days ago and she has a regular 31-day
cycle. She had a positive home urine pregnancy test 3 weeks ago after she realized she had
missed a period and was feeling very tired. This is her first pregnancy. She had been using
condoms but with poor compliance, so the pregnancy was unplanned but she is now
happy about it.
She is generally well, only having been admitted to hospital once in the past for an appendectomy at the age of 17 years. She takes no medication, does not smoke and drinks minimal alcohol. She denies any use of recreational drugs.

Examination
The woman is apyrexial. The blood pressure is 120/65 mmHg and heart rate 78/min. The
abdomen is soft and non-tender with no palpable uterus or other masses.

INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound is shown in Fig. 51.1. The crown–rump length is 25 mm
(equivalent to around 9 weeks’ gestation) and the fetal heart beat is seen.

Figure 51.1 Transvaginal ultrasound
scan.

Questions
• How would you interpret the ultrasound result?
• What further examination, investigations or management would you like to perform or
request?

127

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 51
The ultrasound scan shows a viable single intrauterine pregnancy. The crown–rump
length is compatible with the gestational age by menstrual dates, especially as the woman
reports a long menstrual cycle (3 days longer than normal, therefore gestational age
would be 3 days less than the ‘normal’). Where there is a significant discrepancy with
menstrual and ultrasound gestational age estimation (e.g. more than 7 days), one should
consider the possibility of inaccurate reporting of the last menstrual period date, irregular
cycles leading to inaccurate estimated ovulation date, or of a possible growth-retarded
fetus which may possibly be destined to miscarry.
In this case, as the ultrasound is reassuring the diagnosis would be of a ‘threatened
miscarriage’.
Figure 51.2 shows a three-dimensional image of the fetus, demonstrating the developing
limbs and the physiological midgut herniation which occur at this developmental stage.

Figure 51.2 3D transvaginal
ultrasound scan.

Further management
A speculum examination should be performed. The possible findings may be:
•
•
•
•
•
•

normal appearance
cervical ectropion (often associated with postcoital bleeding)
cervicitis (common with chlamydia)
cervical polyp
cervical malignancy (rare but should not be missed)
open cervix possibly with products or clots in the os.

No further investigations are necessary at this stage – the amount of bleeding is unlikely
to have caused anaemia. Rhesus status is irrelevant as anti-D immunoglobulin is only
recommended with bleeding after 12 weeks’ gestation, where the uterus is instrumented
or where an ectopic pregnancy is treated surgically.
Management in this case is simple reassurance. Available evidence suggests that the pregnancy is at less than 5 per cent risk of miscarriage if the fetal heartbeat is normal and the
128

Early pregnancy

bleeding resolves. There is no evidence for progesterone, bedrest or avoidance of sexual
intercourse with threatened miscarriage. Further assessment should be offered if the
bleeding becomes heavier or recurs. Otherwise the woman’s next appointments are likely
to be the antenatal midwife-booking visit and the 11–14-week ultrasound scan.
KEY POINTS

• Vaginal bleeding in pregnancy is associated with miscarriage in up to 50 per cent of
cases, but the risk is lower if the bleeding is light.

• After a fetal heartbeat has been visualized, the chance of subsequent first-trimester
miscarriage is around 5 per cent.

• Threatened miscarriage is managed by simple reassurance – there is no evidence to
support the use of progesterone support, bedrest or avoidance of sexual intercourse.

GENERAL OBSTETRICS
CASE 52: PAIN IN PREGNANCY
History
A 33-year-old Asian woman complains of worsening abdominal pain for 4 days. She is
16 weeks pregnant in her third pregnancy. She has a 10-year-old son, by normal delivery,
and had a miscarriage 8 years ago. Her pregnancy has been uneventful until now with an
unremarkable first-trimester scan.
The pain is in the left lower abdomen and is constant and sharp. She has taken paracetamol
with little effect and she is unable to sleep due to the pain.
She has had no vaginal bleeding and reports urinary frequency since the beginning of the
pregnancy. She is mildly constipated and has no nausea and vomiting. There is no history
of trauma. She has not felt the baby moving yet.

Examination
The woman is apyrexial and pulse rate is 125/min, with blood pressure 110/68 mmHg.
The uterus is palpable just above the umbilicus. There is significant tenderness over the
left uterine fundal region, where it also feels firm. The abdomen is otherwise soft and
non-tender. There is voluntary guarding but no rebound tenderness. Bowel sounds are
normal. Speculum examination shows a normal, closed cervix and no blood. The fetal heartbeat is heard with hand-held fetal Doppler.

131

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 52
The diagnosis is of fibroid degeneration. The uterine size larger than dates and the localized uterine tenderness are the important features in making this diagnosis. Fibroids affect
20–30 per cent of the female population, commonly developing between 30 and 50 years.
They are particularly common in African-Caribbean women.
Fibroids are oestrogen sensitive and therefore grow in pregnancy in response to the hyperoestrogenic state. When they outgrow their blood supply they undergo ‘red degeneration’, with
necrosis within the fibroid causing the intense localized pain. The diagnosis of fibroids is confirmed by ultrasound visualization of an encapsulated mass in the uterus. The degeneration
is confirmed by the ultrasound appearance of cystic spaces within the fibroid mass.
Degeneration pain usually starts gradually, and some women manage at home with simple paracetamol and rest until the pain subsides. However, it is common for the pain to be
severe enough for admission to hospital for opiate analgesia. Opiates are safe in pregnancy provided use is not prolonged. Intravenous fluids may be required if the woman is
not drinking, or is vomiting due to the pain.
Most women remain well systemically, although a full blood count and C-reactive protein
should be taken to check haemoglobin and to assess the white blood count and inflammatory markers. In this case the woman has a mild microcytic anaemia of pregnancy and
should be given ferrous sulphate.
The pregnancy itself is not usually compromised by degenerating fibroids except in the
rare cases where sepsis develops, in which case miscarriage may occur.
Fibroids are managed expectantly in pregnancy but may cause malpresentation at term,
or obstructed labour if there is a pelvic fibroid. In either of these circumstances, Caesarean
section should be performed. Most fibroids shrink during the puerperium, so consideration
of surgery should be deferred for at least 3 months after delivery.
KEY POINTS

• Fibroids are common and may cause pain as they outgrow their blood supply and
undergo ‘red degeneration’.

• The pain is self-limiting and treatment is pain management.

CASE 53: ILLEGAL DRUG USE IN PREGNANCY
History
A 19-year-old woman is referred to the antenatal clinic by her general practitioner (GP).
She is currently 22 weeks’ gestation in her second pregnancy. She had a son by normal
vaginal delivery 18 months ago, who was taken into social services care initially and
now lives with his grandparents (the father’s parents). Since then, the woman has been
having very infrequent periods and only discovered she was pregnant when she attended
the emergency department with a presumed urinary tract infection 2 weeks ago. At that
stage abdominal palpation revealed a mass, and ultrasound scan confirmed the singleton
gestation.
The GP letter informs that the woman has been a user of crack cocaine and heroin
in the past but that she has been on a methadone replacement programme for the last
8 weeks. The current prescribed regime is 60 mL methadone, which she collects daily from
the pharmacist.
The woman reports that she still injects street heroin several times per week but has not
used crack cocaine for several months. She says that she drinks minimal alcohol but she
smokes 20–25 cigarettes per day.
There is no other medical history of note.
She lives in a council flat with her partner who is also taking prescribed methadone. She
denies any domestic violence within the relationship.

Examination
The woman appears thin and anxious. The blood pressure is 107/65 mmHg and pulse
90/min. The abdomen is distended with the fundus palpable at the umbilicus. The fetal
heartbeat is heard with a hand-held Doppler device.
INVESTIGATIONS
Rubella: immune
Syphilis: negative
Hepatitis B surface antigen: positive
HIV1/2: negative
Haemoglobin: 11.4 g/dL

Questions
• What other investigations should be arranged?
• What are the risks associated with drug use in pregnancy?
• How would you manage this woman during the pregnancy?

133

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 53
The woman has been found to be hepatitis B surface antigen positive. This needs further
investigation with e antigenicity to determine risk of transmission, and liver function
tests. Assuming the hepatitis B is related to needle sharing, she is also at significant risk
of hepatitis C and this should also be tested for at this stage.
A urine toxicology screen should be performed with the woman’s consent, to confirm the
drug history she has given and what the risks to the fetus may be.

!

Illegal drug use risks

• Crack cocaine: crack cocaine use is associated with placental abruption and hence
increased risk of perinatal death or prematurity. It is also known to cause
intrauterine growth restriction by way of arterial vasoconstriction.
• Heroin: opiates are not teratogenic but are associated with intrauterine growth
restriction and premature delivery.
• Cannabis: cannabis is not known to have specific risks in pregnancy, but the
tobacco use associated and the possibility of other associated drug use makes it
an important risk factor.
• Tobacco: tobacco use is associated with fetal growth restriction and low birth
weight. There is also the risk of respiratory disease in the infant from passive
smoking.

Management of the pregnancy
Multidisciplinary team
Most units have a specialist team for management of drug-using women in pregnancy.
This should include specialists in substance misuse, a social worker, a specialist midwife
and an interested obstetrician.
Opiate replacement
The woman needs to be encouraged to engage more fully with the methadone replacement
programme. This may well mean increasing the methadone regime to allow her to stop the
street heroin. Once this has been achieved then she can gradually reduce the dose needed,
with appropriate support. It is better to be still taking a maintenance dose of methadone
through the pregnancy than to try and stop too quickly, resulting in unquantifiable
amounts of illegal drugs being taken during the pregnancy.
Fetal monitoring
The fetus should be assessed for growth during the pregnancy in view of the increased risk
of intrauterine growth restriction.
Delivery
Labour should be managed as for any non-drug-using woman. The difference may be that
the usual doses of opiates needed for analgesia (epidural or systemic) may be insufficient
and need to be titrated up to ensure adequate pain control.
Fetal blood sampling should be avoided in labour due to the risk of vertical transmission
of hepatitis B antigen.

Postpartum
The baby should be administered hepatitis B immunoglobulin at delivery and be given the
accelerated hepatitis B immunization course.
134

General obstetrics

Babies of opiate-using mothers may have initial respiratory depression as a result of the
opiates but then develop withdrawal symptoms. They need immediate transfer to the
neonatal unit for management of the symptoms, with reducing doses of opiates.
Issues of care for the baby should be established between the social services, medical team
and the parents, prior to delivery.
KEY POINTS

• Women who use illegal drugs have high-risk pregnancies.
• A team approach that encourages trust and engagement from the woman is likely to be
most effective.

• Fetal growth should be monitored and the fetus transferred to the neonatal unit at
delivery for management of respiratory depression and withdrawal.

CASE 54: ANTENATAL SCREENING
History
A woman aged 23 years is referred by her general practitioner to the antenatal clinic at
14 weeks in her first pregnancy. She has booked late having only just discovered she is
pregnant. Although the pregnancy was unplanned she is now happy about it. She separated from her partner of 2 years a few weeks ago but is supported by her family and
friends. She has no significant medical history and is one of four siblings. On direct questioning her mother apparently had a stillbirth attributed to some form of congenital
abnormality 28 years ago. Otherwise the pregnancy is assessed to be low risk.
As she is too late for a nuchal translucency test she is offered serum screening for Down’s
syndrome, which she agrees to. This is performed at 17 weeks.
INVESTIGATIONS
Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP): 3.36 multiples of the median (MoM)
Oestriol: 1.08 MoM
Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG): 0.89 MoM

Questions
• How should she be counselled and what further options are available?
• If the pregnancy is not affected with a fetal abnormality, how else could this test result
be explained?

137

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 54
AFP, oestriol and β-HCG are used in combination in the ‘triple test’, one of the serumscreening tests available to detect Down’s syndrome. The results are expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) and in this case the AFP is significantly raised.
Down’s syndrome is associated with decreased AFP, increased oestriol and increased
β-HCG.
Increased AFP is associated with an increased risk of fetal abnormality, the commonest
being:

• neural tube defects
• anterior abdominal wall defects
• Patau’s syndrome (trisomy 13).
The woman should be counselled that the risk of Down’s syndrome is low but that the
blood test suggests a possible increased risk of the other abnormalities described.
She should be referred to a specialist fetal medicine centre for a detailed ultrasound scan to
exclude any significant neural tube or abdominal wall defects. Depending on the ultrasound
result, she may wish to terminate the pregnancy if a serious abnormality is detected, or to
continue but with appropriate geneticist and paediatric input antenatally to prepare for the
delivery.
One of the problems with serum screening is that other pregnancy complications may lead
to a higher level of AFP. These include:

• multiple pregnancy
• fetal intrauterine growth restriction
• oligohydramnios.
AFP is also affected by ethnic background, maternal diabetes and maternal liver disease.
Finally the normal range is dependent on gestation, and unless the gestational age has
been confirmed, the AFP may be high because the pregnancy is more advanced than
presumed.

KEY POINTS

• Maternal AFP is raised in the presence of neural tube defects and other fetal genetic and
structural abnormalities. In contrast it is reduced in cases of Down’s syndrome.

• Women with raised AFP should have their gestation confirmed by ultrasound and be
referred for specialist fetal medicine ultrasound assessment for abnormalities.

CASE 55: EPILEPSY IN PREGNANCY
History
A 24-year-old woman attends for pre-pregnancy counselling. Her general practitioner
(GP) referral letter is shown.
Dear Doctor
Please could you see and advise this young woman who wishes to start a family in
the near future?
She was diagnosed with grand mal epilepsy when she was 12 and has been on
medication since then. She was initially under a paediatric neurologist but for the
last 6 years has been under my care at the practice. Her current treatment regime
includes sodium valproate, phenytoin and lamotrigine. She last had a fit around
1 month ago.
She recently married and is keen to start a family as soon as possible. I would be
grateful if you could see her to discuss the management of any pregnancy. She has
never been pregnant before.
Yours sincerely

Questions
• What specific risks are there in pregnancy for this woman?
• How should she be managed?

139

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 55
The incidence of epilepsy in women of child-bearing age is approximately 1 in 150.
The risks of epilepsy in pregnancy can be divided into risks to the mother and to the fetus.

Risks to the mother
Increased plasma volume causes reduced drug levels and a possible increase in fits. Other
causes of increased fit frequency include excessive tiredness and hyperemesis. Some
women also decide to stop their medication because of fears of adverse effects on the
baby, although this may actually increase the risk to the baby as a result of a higher likelihood of prolonged fits.
Risks to the fetus
There is an increased risk of congenital abnormality due to antiepileptic drugs (7 per cent
risk for one drug, with risk increasing with multiple drugs). The risk probably applies similarly to all antiepileptic medications used.
There is also an intrinsic increased risk of epilepsy in the offspring of an epileptic mother,
and during the pregnancy the fetus is also at risk of fetal hypoxia from uncontrolled
maternal epilepsy.

Management principles
Pre-pregnancy
• Refer for neurology opinion and minimize the number of drugs, aiming for a single
drug regime.
• If no fits have occurred for at least 2 years consider stopping all medication.
• Advise the woman to continue her medication during pregnancy, as having an
increased number of fits is likely to increase the risk of fetal hypoxia.
• Prescribe preconceptual folic acid (5 mg daily rather than 400 μg) to minimize the risk of
neural tube defects and prevent folate deficiency seen with antiepileptic regimes.
Antenatal
• Plan for joint medical and obstetric care.
• Monitor plasma levels of anticonvulsant regime (levels are likely to diminish due to
increased plasma volume).
• Advise the woman to take showers instead of baths to minimize the risk of drowning
if a fit occurs in the bath.
• Arrange detailed anomaly scan and a fetal echocardiography at around 18–20 weeks
for cardiac abnormalities.
• Start vitamin K from 36 weeks’ gestation, to correct any potential clotting deficiency
from the inhibition of clotting factor production by anticonvulsants and thus reduce
the chance of fetal bleeding (e.g. intraventricular haemorrhage). The baby should also
receive intramuscular (rather than oral) vitamin K at birth.
• There are no specific differences in labour management from non-epileptic women.
Postnatal
• Anticonvulsant therapy is not a contraindication to breast-feeding.
• Decrease medication doses as maternal physiology returns to normal.
• Adequate social support is vital and plans need to be made for safe care of the infant
(due to the risk of fits in the mother).
140

General obstetrics
KEY POINTS

• Pre-pregnancy fits should be well controlled, aiming for a single drug regime.
• Epileptic medication is associated with an increased risk of congenital abnormality but
•

the risk to the mother and baby of stopping medication usually takes priority over the
risk of fetal abnormality.
Drug compliance during pregnancy must be emphasized.

CASE 56: BLEEDING IN PREGNANCY
History
A woman presents at 20 weeks’ gestation reporting vaginal bleeding. The bleeding occurred 2 h ago and was bright red. She reported no abdominal pain with the bleeding and she
had not had any previous episodes. She had had intercourse the previous evening.
Her last cervical smear was normal 2 years ago.
This is her first pregnancy and her current obstetric history is unremarkable with normal
first-trimester scan and Down’s syndrome screening. She reports that her booking blood
tests had been normal.
She is extremely anxious when seen, concerned that she is going to have a miscarriage.

Examination
The blood pressure is 105/65 mmHg and pulse 86/min. Abdominal examination confirms
that the uterus reaches to 1 cm below the umbilicus. The uterus is soft and non-tender. The
fetal heart is heard with the hand-held fetal Doppler ultrasound probe. Speculum examination reveals a reddened area around the external cervical os, with an inflammatory
appearance and a small amount of contact bleeding. The os itself is closed.
Questions
• What is the most likely cause of the bleeding?
• How would you manage this woman?

143

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 56
One of the commonest causes of bleeding in pregnancy is a cervical ectropion, and this is
suggested in this case by the examination findings. An ectropion can often look florid and
inflamed even in the absence of infection.
An ectropion may occur at any time in a woman’s reproductive life but tends to be
prevalent:

• in pregnancy
• after puberty
• with the combined oral contraceptive pill.
Postcoital bleeding often suggests an ectropion or other cervicitis. However, caution
should be exerted as an ectropion is very common in pregnancy and could be an incidental finding when there is in fact a uterine source of bleeding. Thus the findings in this case
are very suggestive of bleeding secondary to an ectropion but do not fully rule out a uterine source of the blood loss.
The woman should generally be reassured about the likely cause of the loss. She should be
given anti-D if Rhesus negative, as a fetomaternal haemorrhage could potentially have
occurred if this was uterine bleeding.
Swabs should be taken during the speculum examination to rule out chlamydia, as well as
microscopy, culture and sensitivity for organisms including group B streptococcus and
candida.
Above the gestational age of fetal viability (23–24 weeks), a woman would normally be
admitted for observation for possible further bleeding and risk of premature delivery.
However at 20 weeks with no possibility of fetal viability, there is no advantage to admission to hospital with light bleeding.
Bedrest has not been shown to be of benefit in cases of vaginal bleeding in pregnancy.
She should be advised that the ectropion is not harmful to the pregnancy but may result
in further bleeding episodes, in which case she should be seen again in the obstetric
department.
KEY POINTS

• Women with bleeding in pregnancy must have a speculum examination.
• Swabs should be taken at the time of speculum examination.
• After 23 weeks the woman should be admitted if bleeding continues, due to the risk of
premature delivery.

CASE 57: GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST
History
A woman attends the antenatal day assessment unit to discuss the result of her glucose
tolerance test. She is 42 years old and this is her sixth pregnancy. She has previously had
three Caesarean sections, one early miscarriage and a termination of pregnancy. All booking tests were normal as were her 11–14-week and anomaly ultrasound scans.
The woman is of Indian ethnic origin but was born and has always lived in the UK. She is
now 26 weeks’ gestation and her midwife arranged a glucose tolerance test because of a
family history of type 2 diabetes (her father and paternal aunt).

Examination
The body mass index (BMI) is 31 kg/m2. Blood pressure is 146/87 mmHg. The symphysiofundal height is 29 cm and the fetal heart rate is normal on auscultation.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis: 1⫹ glycosuria
Glucose tolerance test (75 g glucose drink):
pretest fasting blood glucose: 6.4 mmol/L;
2 h blood glucose following 75 g oral glucose load: 11.3 mmol/L.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis and on what criteria can this be made?
• What are the principles of management for this patient?

145

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 57
The diagnosis is of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is based on the 2 h glucose
concentration exceeding 11.1 mmol/L (World Health Organization (WHO) criteria). The
diagnosis may also be made if the fasting blood glucose exceeds 7.8 mmol/L, in which
case a formal glucose tolerance test would not have been necessary. Transient glycosuria
is common in pregnancy and may occur after a glucose-rich drink or snack. Therefore the
urinalysis alone is unhelpful in the assessment of this woman.
GDM occurs in up to 3 per cent of the pregnant population depending on the ethnic diversity of the specific population. In some cases it may be the first presentation of previously
undiagnosed diabetes.

!

Risk factors for GDM

• Pre-existing:

•
•
•
•
•

obesity
previous GDM
family history of diabetes
women with previously large babies or stillbirth
increasing maternal age
• Occurring in this pregnancy:
• glycosuria
• large for dates baby
• polyhydramnios

The importance of the diagnosis relates to the effect on the mother and fetus.

• Effects on the fetus:
• fetal macrosomia
• polyhydramnios
• neonatal hypoglycaemia
• neonatal respiratory distress syndrome
• increased stillbirth rate
• Effects on the mother:
• increased risk of traumatic delivery (e.g. shoulder dystocia)
• increased Caesarean section risk
• increased risk of developing GDM in subsequent pregnancies
• 50 per cent increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes within 15 years
Management principles
• Optimal control of maternal blood glucose minimizes the chance of fetal complications. This needs the multidisciplinary input of a diabetologist, specialist diabetes
nurse, dietitian, specialist midwife and obstetrician.
• Dietary advice and counselling are the initial interventions (reduced fat and carbohydrate intake with weight control).
• Blood glucose monitoring at home should be initiated with pre- and post-prandial levels
at each meal.
• Oral hypoglycaemics are contraindicated in pregnancy.
• If blood glucose measurements are repeatedly high, insulin should be commenced.

General obstetrics

• The fetus should be monitored with regular ultrasound scans for growth and liquor

•

volume (polyhydramnios being a sign of fetal polyuria secondary to excessive glucose
level).
Delivery should be planned by 40 weeks, but Caesarean section should be performed
for obstetric indications only.
Sliding-scale insulin should be initiated in labour for women on insulin.
The insulin can be stopped immediately postpartum as normal glucose homeostasis
returns rapidly after delivery.
The fetus should be carefully monitored for neonatal hypoglycaemia.
The mother should have a repeat glucose tolerance test 6 weeks postpartum to rule out
pre-existing diabetes.
KEY POINTS

• Gestational diabetes should initially be treated with dietary and weight advice. Insulin
may be needed if blood glucose levels remain high.

• One-third of women with impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy will go on to
develop diabetes mellitus in the next 25 years.

CASE 58: ANTENATAL SCREENING
History
A woman aged 34 years is 9 weeks’ gestation in her third pregnancy. Her first pregnancy
ended in a first-trimester suction termination at 18 years of age and she had a miscarriage
8 months ago requiring evacuation of retained products of conception (ERPC). She is generally well except for mild asthma.
She has no family history of congenital abnormalities. She is a non-smoker and currently
drinks approximately 3 units of alcohol per week. Her only medication is folic acid 400 μg
daily.
Her partner is 31 years old and was adopted. He has no known medical problems.
The routine booking blood and urine tests are normal. The couple opt for Down’s syndrome
screening and a first-trimester ultrasound appointment is booked for 12 weeks.
INVESTIGATIONS
The first-trimester ultrasound findings are shown in Fig. 58.1.
Ultrasound report:
Single fetus. Fetal heart action normal
Crown–rump length 62.4 mm (corresponds to 12 ⫹ 3 weeks’ gestation)
Nuchal translucency (NT) 3.2 mm
Risk of trisomy by maternal age (34 years) 1:276
Adjusted risk of trisomy after NT 1:30

Figure 58.1 First trimester ultrasound scan.

Questions
• How would you explain the report to the couple?
• What are the options available to the couple now and what are their relative advantages and disadvantages?
• The couple chose to have a further test and the results are normal, what further diagnoses should be considered?

149

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 58
Explanation of the report
Down’s syndrome screening can be difficult to explain, and any discussion should start
with checking that the couple understand what Down’s syndrome is:

• a chromosomal ‘genetic’ problem that usually occurs sporadically (‘by chance’)
• associated with physical abnormalities which may be relatively minor, such as short
stature, abnormal facial appearance, or major, such as severe cardiac abnormality

• always associated with learning disability, though the extent is variable
• life expectancy is generally up to 40 or 50 years.
The ‘nuchal translucency’ test is a screening test and does not give a definite answer as to
whether the pregnancy is affected or not. The risk in this case based on the mother’s age
alone is 1 in 276, but the high NT measurement combined with the maternal age suggests
that the risk for this particular baby is 1 in 30. Most women even with a high risk result
actually have a normal fetus (a false-positive result).

Available options
Any risk above 1 in 250 to 300 is considered ‘high risk’ and such women are offered
diagnostic testing to give a definite diagnosis. Samples are obtained by chorionic villous
sampling (CVS) at 11–14 weeks or by amniocentesis from 15 weeks. Both involve an ultrasound-guided needle inserted through the abdominal wall under local anaesthetic. Both
are associated with approximately 1 in 100 risk of procedure-related miscarriage. CVS can
be performed earlier, which allows for earlier termination if that is chosen, but has a risk
of not giving a true result (mosaicism). Amniocentesis is performed from 15 weeks and
has no risk of placental mosaicism.
A couple may alternatively choose to avoid invasive testing and have a detailed anomaly
scan at 20 weeks to assess for ‘soft markers’ of Down’s syndrome (such as skull abnormalities, ventriculomegaly, atrial septal defect, duodenal atresia, echogenic bowel, hydronephrosis
and short limbs).
This couple opts for amniocentesis at 16 weeks’ gestation and the result is:

• Chromosomal analysis: 46XY normal karyotype.
Further investigation
Fetuses with a high-risk NT but normal karyotype have an increased likelihood of other
structural defects such as congenital heart disease, exomphalos, diaphragmatic hernia and
skeletal defects. This couple should therefore have a detailed anomaly scan and fetal cardiac echo at around 20 weeks’ gestation.
KEY POINTS

• Nuchal translucency (NT) is a screening test not a diagnostic test.
• The NT result may increase their risk but most women with increased NT have a normal
fetus (false positive). However women who have a high-risk NT and normal karyotype
are at risk of other structural defects, so a detailed anomaly scan should be performed at
around 20 weeks.

CASE 59: ANTENATAL CARE
History
A woman attends a routine antenatal appointment at 31 weeks’ gestation. She is 26 years
old and this is her fourth pregnancy. She has three children, all spontaneous vaginal deliveries at term. Her third child is 18 months old and the delivery was complicated by a postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) requiring a 4 unit blood transfusion. This pregnancy has been
uncomplicated to date, with normal booking blood tests, normal 11–14-week ultrasound
and normal anomaly ultrasound scan.
She feels generally tired and attributes this to caring for her three young children. She
reports good fetal movements (more than 10 per day).

151

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 59
The haemoglobin is significantly low even for pregnancy, and is associated with a low mean
cell volume. This is usually due to iron-deficiency anaemia. Iron deficiency anaemia usually
occurs when the woman enters pregnancy with depleted iron stores, although she may not
at that stage have low haemoglobin or any signs or symptoms suggestive of anaemia.

!

Implications of anaemia in pregnancy

• Baby (possible):
• low birth weight
• neonatal anaemia
• cognitive impairment
• Mother:
• antenatal

•

– fatigue
– fainting
– dizziness
peripartum
– increased risk of haemodynamic compromise
– increased likelihood of transfusion

At delivery, blood loss is inevitable. This woman has additional risk factors of having her
fourth delivery and having a history of PPH. As she is already very anaemic, she may
decompensate easily if blood loss occurs, increasing her likelihood of hypovolaemic shock
and need for emergency blood transfusion.

Further investigations
Although the likely cause of these indices is iron deficiency, differential diagnoses include
a mixed folate and iron deficiency, thalassaemia, chronic bleeding, or anaemia of chronic
disease (e.g. renal disease). A full history should therefore be taken to exclude chronic diseases and to elicit any family history of thalassaemia.
Iron deficiency should be demonstrated with findings of low mean cell haemoglobin (MCH)
and low serum ferritin. Ferritin below 12 μg/L confirms the diagnosis. Serum and red cell folate
should also be checked and the woman should be screened for haemoglobinopathies.
If chronic disease is suspected, then further investigations may be indicated such as renal
and liver function tests for chronic disease, or gastrointestinal tract endoscopy for causes
of chronic bleeding.

Further management
Correction of anaemia
• The woman should be prescribed ferrous sulphate 200 mg twice daily, increasing to
three times if tolerated. If iron tablets are not tolerated then alternatives include iron
suspension or parenteral (intramuscular) iron injections. These are painful and do not
increase the serum haemoglobin more than the maximum expected from oral iron
(1 g/dL per week).
• In extreme cases, where it is not possible to increase the haemoglobin level by iron
supplementation, blood transfusion should be considered.
• An iron-rich diet should be encouraged.
152

General obstetrics

Delivery
• At delivery, she should be considered at high risk of PPH and have an intravenous
cannula inserted in labour, with full blood count and group and save.
• Active management of the third stage is essential (syntometrine, controlled cord
traction) and an oxytocin infusion considered if bleeding is excessive or the uterus is
suspected to be atonic.
• Following delivery, the woman should continue iron supplementation until iron stores
(ferritin) are restored, even if haemoglobin is normal.
KEY POINTS

• Anaemia (not physiological) must be investigated in pregnancy.
• If untreated, anaemia will worsen during pregnancy and blood loss at delivery may be
catastrophic.

• Women with previous PPH must have active management of the third stage.

CASE 60: PREVIOUS CAESAREAN SECTION
History
A woman is referred to the obstetric antenatal clinic by the community midwife after the
booking appointment revealed that she had had a previous emergency Caesarean. You are
the foundation year 2 doctor seeing her and you elicit the history and examine her.
She is 25 years old and pregnant with her second child. Her daughter was born 3 years
ago by emergency Caesarean section for failure to progress in labour due to an occipitoposterior position. The pregnancy had been uncomplicated and she had gone into spontaneous labour at 40 weeks 5 days. She had contractions for 24 h, and during this time she
underwent artificial rupture of membranes and was given a syntocinon infusion for 8 h. The
cervix dilated to 8 cm but she did not progress further despite regular strong contractions.
Following the emergency Caesarean the baby was well, but the woman was readmitted to
hospital after 7 days because of an infected wound haematoma for which she required
intravenous antibiotics.
The antibiotics altered the taste of the breast milk and the baby subsequently had to have
formula milk.
She now feels anxious that she might have to go through the same experiences again and
is wondering whether she can request an elective Caesarean section to avoid having
another long labour and emergency procedure, with its associated complications.
She has had no other pregnancies and is generally fit and healthy. She is currently 16
weeks’ gestation and has had a normal nuchal scan. Booking blood tests are normal.

Examination
The abdomen is distended, compatible with pregnancy. The low transverse scar is visible
and is non-tender. The uterus is palpable to midway between the symphysis pubis and the
umbilicus. The fetal heartbeat is heard with a hand-held Doppler machine.
Question
• How should you advise and manage her?

155

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 60
The current average Caesarean section rate in the UK is approximately 24 per cent. This
means that many women are returning in subsequent pregnancies having had a previous
Caesarean section. In this case the woman has an otherwise low-risk pregnancy and the
only factor to be considered at this stage is the planned mode of delivery.
She should be able to make an informed choice after appropriate information regarding
vaginal birth after Caesarean section versus planned Caesarean section.
The important points for this woman to be informed about and to consider are
summarized:

• vaginal birth after Caesarean (VBAC):
• successful in 70 per cent of cases
• emergency Caesarean section rate is approximately 30 per cent
• 1 in 200 risk of uterine rupture (scar dehiscence)
• close cardiotocograph monitoring is needed, with intravenous access, fasting and
full blood count and group and save serum available

• normal progress is expected and augmentation of labour is not usually recommended in women with a uterine scar

• induction of labour may be appropriate in selected women with previous Caesarean
section

• planned Caesarean section:
• operative delivery is associated with higher risks of haemorrhage, infection, visceral
damage and thrombosis

• mobility and ability to care for child and baby is more impaired by Caesarean section than vaginal delivery

• planned Caesarean does avoid the possibility of an emergency procedure
• after two Caesarean sections a further Caesarean would be the only option in any
subsequent pregnancy
The woman should be offered a further appointment towards the end of the third trimester
to confirm her decision regarding mode of delivery and to check for any complications
that might contraindicate vaginal delivery such as breech presentation, a large baby, scar
tenderness or pre-eclampsia. One of the most important points in the consultation is to listen to her concerns about the previous delivery and what her fears might be. An empathetic approach will help her to feel confident about any decision she makes this time.
KEY POINTS

• Although low, the maternal morbidity and mortality are higher for Caesarean section
than for vaginal delivery.

• The chances of a successful vaginal delivery after a previous Caesarean section are ⬎70
per cent

• A woman’s experiences of previous deliveries are very important in counselling for any
subsequent pregnancy and delivery.

CASE 61: GROUP B STREPTOCOCCUS
History
You are asked to see a woman in the antenatal assessment unit. She is gravida 4, para 1,
having had a normal vaginal delivery 3 years ago, a first-trimester miscarriage and two
first-trimester terminations.
She is currently 26 weeks’ gestation. One week ago she was seen because she experienced
vaginal bleeding. At the time a small cervical ectropion had been noticed and as the bleed
had occurred postcoitally, it was assumed likely to be secondary to the ectropion.
However, as per protocol, she had vaginal and endocervical swabs sent and a full blood
count and group and save sample requested.

Questions

157

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 61
The key results are

• mild anaemia
• group B streptococcus carrier
• candida.
The anaemia is mild for pregnancy and as the mean cell volume is low, suggesting iron
deficiency, it may be treated with ferrous sulphate 200 mg twice daily, with repeat haemoglobin after 4 weeks. She should also be advised about an appropriate iron-rich diet
(e.g. meat, lentils, spinach).
Candida organisms are present very commonly in the vagina, particularly in pregnancy.
This should be treated (with vaginal clotrimoxazole) only if the woman is symptomatic
(itching or lumpy discharge).

Group B streptococcus (GBS)
GBS (Streptococcus agalactiae) colonization occurs in 25 per cent of women at some stage
during their pregnancy. In this case the finding of GBS may relate to the presenting symptom of bleeding, but is most likely to be an incidental finding. This is the most important
result as there is a risk of GBS to the baby with an incidence of 1 in 2000 neonates being
infected, with 6 per cent mortality.

Preterm delivery
Prolonged rupture of membranes
Pyrexia in labour

In the UK, universal screening for GBS has not been shown to be effective in reducing
neonatal death.

Management
Antenatal treatment does not seem to reduce the neonatal risk (perhaps because of recolonization). However measures are taken to reduce transmission to the baby at the time of delivery:

• intravenous penicillin (or clindamycin or erythromycin if allergic) should always be
given to the mother in labour

• neonatal care depends on the clinical scenario but may include:
• observation of the baby for up to 5 days postpartum for signs of sepsis
• consideration of culture of the baby for evidence of infection (ear, nose, axilla)
• intravenous antibiotics until culture results confirm no evidence of infection.
KEY POINTS

• GBS is the most common cause of serious bacterial infection in UK infants, with a
mortality of 10 per cent.

• Antenatal treatment is not effective but treatment instead at the time of delivery reduces
perinatal morbidity and mortality.

CASE 62: TWIN PREGNANCY
History
A 37-year-old woman attends the antenatal clinic at 18 weeks’ gestation. She is gravida
2 para 1, having had a spontaneous vaginal delivery at term 8 years ago. This current
pregnancy was achieved through in vitro fertilization after four attempts (cycles). Two
embryos were implanted. The first-trimester scan confirmed a twin gestation and noted a
lambda sign between the gestations sacs. The anomaly scan is due in 2 weeks.
So far the woman has been feeling nauseated and tired but well.

Examination
The blood pressure is 120/78 mmHg. The fundus is palpable 2 cm above the umbilicus.

• How would you monitor and manage this pregnancy?

159

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 62
The ultrasound confirms a twin pregnancy with a lambda sign (projection of placental tissue between the dividing membranes). This is suggestive of a dichorionic pregnancy. The
woman is anaemic with a low mean cell volume suggestive of iron-deficiency anaemia.
The only other investigation of note is that the woman has sickle trait.

Zygosity
Although the pregnancy appears dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA), this does not inform us
about zygosity. A monozygotic pregnancy may be DCDA if the embryo has split at an early
stage. One third of monozygotic pregnancies are DCDA, two-thirds monochorionic diamniotic and around 1 per cent are monochorionic monoamniotic. Confirmation of zygosity is
with placental histology, or by observing that the fetuses are of different genders.
Monitoring
Twin pregnancies are associated with increased maternal risks of hyperemesis, anaemia,
preterm labour, antepartum haemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes, thrombosis
and Caesarean delivery.
The fetuses are at risk of intrauterine growth restriction, prematurity, stillbirth or neonatal
death, congenital anomalies and operative delivery.

!

Monitoring in twin pregnancies

•
•
•
•

Regular full blood count
Close blood pressure and urinalysis monitoring
Fetal growth surveillance from 28 weeks
Screening for gestational diabetes

Management
In addition to routine antenatal care this woman needs:

•
•
•
•

information regarding the increased maternal and fetal risks with twin pregnancy
regular hospital antenatal assessment from the late second trimester
ferrous sulphate and folic acid supplementation
discussion of mode of delivery (depending on growth and presentation of twins at
around 36 weeks)
• hospital delivery by 40 weeks
• introduction to multiple pregnancy support groups.
The woman has sickle trait and her partner should also be tested. If he is also sickle trait
positive then prenatal testing of the babies should be offered to determine whether they
are homozygous and therefore going to be affected by sickle cell disease.
KEY POINTS

• Chorionicity and amnionicity can be determined with high accuracy by ultrasound in
•
•

160

the first trimester but, unless the fetuses are seen to be of different sexes, the zygosity of
dichorionic diamniotic twins can only be confirmed with genetic or histological testing.
Multiple pregnancies are high risk for both mother and babies, and close monitoring is
essential for the early detection of problems.
A woman with sickle cell trait whose partner is also sickle cell trait positive should be
offered prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis or cordocentesis.

CASE 63: POSTPARTUM PYREXIA
History
A 29-year-old woman presents with a fever. She had a Caesarean section 3 weeks ago and
was recovering well until 2 days ago when she became very cold and shivery at night. She
has been unable to keep herself warm despite several blankets and has reduced appetite,
nausea, vomiting and lethargy. She is breast-feeding and has had very sore nipples since
the birth but feels this is normal and has been using camomile ointment to soothe them.
In the last 24 h she has noticed the left breast has become sore and red.
She has mild lower abdominal pain at the site of the Caesarean section wound. She no
longer has vaginal bleeding but has a moderate brown discharge with an odour which she
says is improving. Bowel habit is normal and she has no urinary symptoms.

Examination
On examination the woman is wearing a jersey and jacket, with a blanket over her. Her
temperature is 38.6°C. Blood pressure is 120/64 mmHg and heart rate 106/min. The chest
is clear and heart sounds are normal. The right breast is normal but there is a welldemarcated area of redness over the superiolateral aspect of the left breast, which is tender and hot to touch.
The uterus is firm and is non-tender, just palpable above the symphysis pubis. There is no
leg swelling.

Questions

• How would you investigate and manage this woman?

161

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 63
The blood and protein on urinalysis are likely to be due to contamination from persisting
vaginal discharge (lochia), but there is no evidence of urinary tract infection (no leucocytes or nitrites).
The haemoglobin is slightly low, which can occur with sepsis but is also common after
pregnancy and delivery. The leucocytosis with neutrophilia and raised C-reactive protein
suggests a significant bacterial septic process. Urea is raised while creatinine and potassium are normal, suggesting dehydration secondary to sepsis, pyrexia and vomiting.

Diagnosis
The diagnosis is mastitis (a localized infection within the breast tissue). This occurs in
5 per cent of lactating women. The pathophysiology probably involves colonization of the
breast ducts by bacteria through the cracked nipples, causing localized inflammation and
obstruction of the duct with subsequent retention of milk, and infection. The commonest
organism is staphylococcus from the skin. The differential diagnosis is of a breast abscess
which would be palpated as a fluctuant mass in the breast.
Investigation
Blood cultures and a swab from the breast milk or nipple are necessary. In cases of diagnostic doubt, an ultrasound scan can differentiate mastitis from an abscess.
Management
The woman should be admitted for intravenous antibiotics and fluids, regular paracetamol, analgesia and anti-emetics as necessary. Until cultures are available, flucloxacillin
should be commenced with consultation with a microbiologist if some improvement is not
seen within 24 h.
She should be encouraged to continue breast-feeding. If this is too painful she should
express milk in order to try to unblock the duct. If an abscess is diagnosed then needle aspiration under local anaesthetic is preferred to formal incision and drainage in most cases.

KEY POINTS

• Mastitis is a common cause of puerperal pyrexia.
• As well as antibiotics, management includes continued breast-feeding from both breasts
or expressing milk to unblock the duct.

CASE 64: BLEEDING IN PREGNANCY
History
You are asked to review a nulliparous woman who has presented with vaginal bleeding at
39 weeks ⫹ 5 days’ gestation. Booking blood pressure was 123/72 mmHg. Her last midwife
visit was 10 days ago when blood pressure was 130/76 mmHg.
This evening she noticed a small ‘gush’ of blood and discovered a bright red stain in her
underclothes. She denies actual abdominal pain but reports some intermittent lower
abdominal discomfort. The baby has been moving normally during the day.

Examination
She is warm and well perfused. Her blood pressure is 158/87 mmHg and heart rate 84/min.
The symphysiofundal height is 36 cm and the fetus is cephalic with 3/5 palpable abdominally. Moderate uterine tenderness is noted. The uterus is soft but during the palpation two
moderate uterine tightenings are noted. On speculum examination the cervical os is closed
and there is a moderate amount of vaginal blood.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How should this woman be managed?

163

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 64
The diagnosis is of placental abruption in view of the bleeding, uterine tenderness and
irritability. CTG is reassuring at present with baseline 130 beats/min, normal variability,
several accelerations and no decelerations. Regular uterine activity is demonstrated on the
tocograph.

!

Common causes of antepartum haemorrhage (APH) at term

• Maternal blood:

•
•
•
•
•

blood-stained show
bleeding placenta praevia
placental abruption
cervical ectropion
infection (e.g. candida)
• Fetal blood:
• vasa praevia

A ‘show’ can be ruled out, as the blood is fresh rather than mucus-like and dark. Placenta
praevia would have been detected at the anomaly scan, and bleeding placenta praevia is
typically painless. She has no features suggesting infection, and vasa praevia bleeding
would normally occur with rupture of membranes. Placental abruption is supported by
the history of fresh bleeding and uterine irritability and the associated high blood pressure and proteinuria (pre-eclampsia is a cause of abruption).
Placental abruption may be major with catastrophic haemorrhage or, as in this case, be
less dramatic. However, caution should be maintained for two reasons: first, a small bleed
may herald a larger bleed. Second, although some bleeding is revealed, there may be a
more significant concealed bleed. Pregnant women may not show any signs of hypovolaemic shock until a large amount of blood has been lost.

Management
Women with APH should always be admitted for observation. Initial management for this
woman includes intravenous access, group and save, full blood count and clotting profile.
Urea, electrolytes and urate should be sent, looking for abnormalities associated with preeclampsia; 24-h urine collection for proteinuria is not indicated in this case as induction
of labour is already indicated on clinical grounds. Blood pressure should be repeated at
regular intervals and antihypertensives commenced if indicated.
Induction of labour may increase the chance of operative intervention, but the risk of
expectant management is that sudden and catastrophic further haemorrhage may occur. As
the woman is over 37 weeks, there is little risk to the fetus of prematurity from induction.
KEY POINTS

• Placental abruption is a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms and examination.
• Blood loss caused by placental abruption may be concealed or revealed.
• A woman may not show signs of hypovolaemia until she had lost a large proportion of
her blood volume.

CASE 65: BREECH PRESENTATION
History
You are asked to see a woman in the antenatal clinic. She is 37 years old and pregnant
with her third child. Her previous children were both born by vaginal delivery after induction of labour for post dates.
First-trimester ultrasound confirmed her menstrual dates and she is now 37 weeks. At her
last appointment at 36 weeks’ gestation, the midwife suspected that the baby was in a
breech presentation. An appointment has been made for an ultrasound assessment and to
discuss the situation.

Examination
Blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg and abdominal examination suggests a breech presentation with the sacrum not engaged.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis: negative
Ultrasound report:
Indication for scan: suspected breech presentation
Gestational age: 37 weeks 3 days
Frank breech presentation (hips flexed, knees straight)
Estimated fetal weight 3.2 kg
Placenta: high anterior
Liquor volume: normal (amniotic fluid index 18 cm).

Questions
• What are the options available to the woman?
• What management would you recommend in this case?

165

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 65
At 30 weeks the incidence of breech presentation is around 14 per cent, but is only
2–4 per cent by term.

!

Causes and associations for breech presentation

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Grand multiparity (lax uterus)
Uterine abnormality (bicornuate, septate, fibroids)
Placenta praevia
Polyhydramnios
Oligohydramnios
Multiple pregnancy
Congenital fetal abnormality
Prematurity

The three options available are:
1 external cephalic version
2 elective Caesarean section
3 vaginal breech delivery.
All three options should be discussed with the woman and her partner with important
counselling points.

• Vaginal breech delivery:
• found to be less safe for singleton term fetuses than planned Caesarean section
• carries a high chance of necessitating an emergency Caesarean section
• needs involvement of an experienced obstetrician with continuous fetal heart monitoring and ideally an epidural

• should only be allowed if the labour progresses spontaneously – augmentation of
breech labour is generally not recommended

• contraindicated with placenta praevia, large baby, footling breech or maternal condition such as pre-eclampsia

• External cephalic version:
• involves using external manipulation of the fetus, encouraging the baby to turn to
the cephalic presentation by way of pressure on the maternal abdomen

• is often performed after giving a uterine relaxant such as salbutamol
• carries a very small chance of abnormal fetal heart rate during or after the procedure which could necessitate an emergency Caesarean section

• has approximately 50 per cent success rate overall
• some fetuses revert to breech position even after successful external cephalic
version

• contraindicated with previous Caesarean section, other uterine surgery, pre-eclampsia,
intrauterine growth retardation, oligohydramnios

• can be painful
• Elective Caesarean section:
• is safer than vaginal breech delivery
• is suitable where contraindications exist to external cephalic version
• can be planned for in advance, which women may find more convenient
• does not necessarily mean a woman would need a Caesarean section for any future
pregnancy.
166

General obstetrics

In this case the woman should be recommended external cephalic version as soon as possible, with options for an elective Caesarean section or possible trial of breech delivery if
this is unsuccessful.
Postnatal paediatric review should focus on the baby’s hips, with a neonatal ultrasound
arranged within 6 weeks to rule out congenital hip dislocation (10–15 times more common in breech presentation).
KEY POINTS

• Breech presentation is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality.
• If a woman has a frank breech at 37 weeks she should normally be offered external
cephalic version, and if unsuccessful an elective Caesarean section or possibly a vaginal
breech delivery.

CASE 66: ANTENATAL SCREENING
History
A 31-year-old pregnant Russian woman came to the UK 6 weeks ago with her English
husband. As a result she booked late with the midwife at 31 weeks’ gestation. This is her
first ongoing pregnancy, having had two uncomplicated surgical terminations approximately 10 years ago. She reports a history of genital herpes diagnosed by her general
practitioner several weeks ago. There is no relevant previous general medical history or
family history.
She had an apparently normal first-trimester scan in Russia before arriving in the UK and
has had a normal anomaly scan in this hospital at 30 weeks’ gestation.

Questions

169

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 66
Screening for syphilis is recommended for all pregnant women and T. pallidum EIA is a
specific test for syphilis infection. The prevalence of infection is up to 0.3/1000 pregnant
women in the UK. EIA tests that detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG and IgM, T. pallidum haemagglutination test and the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorbed test
(FTA-abs) are used generally for screening in pregnancy, as they are 98 per cent sensitive
and over 99 per cent specific.
In cases with a positive screening test a second treponemal-specific confirmatory test
should be sent to confirm the diagnosis. Caution is needed as treponemal-specific tests
cannot differentiate syphilis from other treponemal disease (yaws, pinta and bejel).
The diagnosis in this woman is syphilis infection. She should be referred to a genitourinary medicine clinic for urgent assessment and treatment. She may have a genital ulcer
(possibly misdiagnosed as herpes simplex by her doctor) or features of secondary syphilis,
but many women diagnosed are asymptomatic (latent syphilis).

Management
Treatment is with intramuscular penicillin daily for 10 days (doxycycline or erythromycin
if penicillin allergic). Follow-up with a quantitative test (such as venereal disease research
laboratory [VDRL] should be used to confirm effective treatment and to monitor for
reinfection. The woman’s partner should be referred to the genitourinary medicine clinic
for testing (45–60 per cent of partners will be infected).
The paediatricians should be informed at delivery to assess for signs of early congenital
syphilis (usually developing in the first few weeks of life) and to arrange serological testing.
Untreated, 70–100 per cent of babies of mothers with syphilis infection will develop congenital syphilis, with a 30 per cent stillbirth rate.

!

Features of congenital syphilis

• Early congenital syphilis due to transplacental transfer of organisms (⬍2 years):

•
•
•
•
•

condylomata lata rash
snuffles
lymphadenopathy
hepatosplenomegaly
ocular, renal and haematological involvement
• Late congenital syphilis due to early structural damage (>2 years)
• interstitial keratitis
• Hutchinson’s incisors
• Clutton’s joints
• saddle nose deformity
• frontal bossing
• deafness.

KEY POINTS

• T. pallidum EIA is an enzyme immunoassay for syphilis.
• If untreated, pregnant women with syphilis will have a 30 per cent chance of a stillbirth
and 70–100 per cent chance that the baby will have been infected with syphilis.

CASE 67: PAIN IN PREGNANCY
History
A 40-year-old woman presents with a fever and abdominal pain. She is 18 weeks pregnant in her third pregnancy. The pregnancy has been unremarkable so far and she has no
significant gynaecological or medical history.
She has felt unwell for 10 days but has become worse in the last 48 h. She is nauseated
and has vomited several times. She is intermittently hot and cold. Her abdominal pain is
generalized and constant with some right-sided loin pain.
She denies any dysuria and says that she has frequency which has been present throughout the pregnancy. She has had no recent change in bowel habit. There has been no
vaginal bleeding and she has a mild thin vaginal discharge.

Examination
She appears flushed and unwell. Her temperature is 38.2°C, blood pressure 115/68 mmHg
and pulse 112/min. Cardiac and chest examination is normal. The fundal height is approximately 2 cm below the umbilicus, and the uterus is soft and non-tender. The rest of the
abdomen is tender on deep palpation, maximally in the right lower quadrant. There is
right renal angle tenderness. The fetal heart is heard at 160/min with hand-held Doppler.

Questions

171

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 67
The diagnosis is of pyelonephritis, which occurs in 1–2 per cent of pregnancies. Women
can be very unwell with non-specific symptoms. In this case specific factors are evident
(loin pain and positive urinalysis).
Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in pregnancy due to progesterone causing
stasis of urine and pressure of the gravid uterus causing ureteric obstruction.

Further investigation
The diagnosis should be confirmed with urine microscopy, culture and sensitivity, and
blood cultures should be sent prior to commencing antibiotics. Renal tract ultrasound
scan is necessary to rule out any congenital abnormality (such as duplex ureters) that may
predispose to renal tract infection, and to rule out an infected obstructed kidney which
could need urgent drainage by nephrostomy. Renal tract ultrasound, however, can be difficult to interpret in pregnancy as physiological dilatation of the ureters occurs from pressure from the uterus.
Management
Intravenous antibiotics should be started, usually cephalosporins, until culture and sensitivities are available, with regular paracetamol to control the temperature and pain. It may
take several days for the temperature to settle and for the woman’s pain and symptoms to
resolve, but improvement should be monitored with daily white blood count, C-reactive
protein and urea and electrolytes. Intravenous rehydration is needed as the woman is
vomiting and pyrexial with raised urea, suggesting dehydration.
After completion of treatment (total 2 weeks) a repeat urine culture is needed to confirm
cure. Some women with recurrent infection need a daily prophylactic antibiotic regime.

Effect on the pregnancy
Maternal sepsis is a risk for miscarriage and preterm labour, so treatment should not be
delayed. In addition, recurrent UTI, even asymptomatic bacteriuria, is associated with
intrauterine growth retardation and preterm labour.
KEY POINTS

• Urinary tract infections are common in pregnancy.
• Pyelonephritis must be treated aggressively with intravenous antibiotics to avoid
miscarriage or preterm delivery.

CASE 68: POSTPARTUM CHEST PAIN
History
A 32-year-old Sri Lankan woman presents complaining of chest pain, neck tightness and
shortness of breath 3 weeks after delivery. The symptoms have come on gradually over the last
2 days and are now severe. She feels as if she cannot breathe and thinks she is going to die.
The pain is heavy and stabbing and is constant though worse when she lies down and tries
to sleep. The pain is not pleuritic and she says it radiates up into her neck. She does not
have a cough or haemoptysis.
The neck tightness is all over the neck but especially anteriorly, and is related to the
difficulty breathing. There is no photophobia or fever.
The breathing difficulty occurs predominantly when she is trying to sleep or is sleeping –
it has woken her several times during the night. She is now terrified of going to sleep and
is actively stopping herself from doing so as she is certain that she will die if she does.
Prior to this she has always been fit and well with no previous medical history reported.
The pregnancy was uneventful and she was admitted in spontaneous labour at 40 weeks.
Cervical dilatation was slow and contractions were therefore augmented with syntocinon.
Once fully dilated she had pushed for 90 min and subsequently underwent ventouse delivery of a healthy female infant.
She had some difficulty establishing breast-feeding and bonding with the baby and was
finally discharged home on day four following delivery. Since going home she has
stopped breast-feeding but is finding it difficult to sleep even when the baby is sleeping.
She has lived in the UK for 18 months but her husband has been here for 6 years.
Currently her mother is also staying with them to help with the baby. Both the woman and
her mother speak very little English and the husband is interpreting.
Examination
She is thin and quiet, with little eye contact. When talking about the baby she is nonresponsive and she does not look at or touch the baby during the consultation. Her blood
pressure is 108/62 mmHg and heart rate 90/min. She is apyrexial. There are no signs of
anaemia, cyanosis or oedema. Chest and cardiac examination are normal and the uterus
is just palpable in the lower abdomen.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What further questions would you wish to ask and what are the principles of
management?
173

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 68
The symptoms initially sound possibly cardiac or respiratory in origin. However, the story
does not fit with any specific disease and the examination and investigations are all normal.
The absolute fear of sleeping is an important piece of information as is the reported affect.
This woman is suffering from postnatal psychosis. This occurs in 1 in 500 women with
onset in the first 6 weeks post delivery. The commonest symptoms are delusions (e.g. the
thought that she is going to die) and hallucinations.
The condition should be distinguished from the two other main psychological/psychiatric
postnatal conditions.

• Post-partum blues:
• tearfulness
• fatigue
• anxiety over their own or the baby’s health
• feelings of inability to cope
This is very common (probably affecting approximately half of mothers) usually after the
third postnatal day, and resolves spontaneously over a few days.

• Post-partum depression:
• low mood
• crying
• anxiety over the baby’s health
• feelings of guilt towards the baby
• panic attacks
• excessive tiredness
• poor appetite
This occurs in 10 per cent of women, any time up to 6 months following delivery. It should
be treated seriously with suicide risk assessment and antidepressant medication as well as
social and practical support.

Further questioning
A trained interpreter should be sought rather than the husband who is involved in this
case and may find it difficult to translate or address sensitive issues.
The woman should be asked for any previous personal or family history of mental illness
or psychiatric treatment. She should then be asked more probing questions. How is her
mood and appetite? Does she feel depressed? Does she have fears of harming herself?
Her relationship and attitudes to the baby are important – how does she feel about the
baby? Is she finding the baby easy? Does she feel that the baby is healthy? Does she have
any negative thoughts toward the baby such that it is bad or evil? Does she feel she might
harm the baby?
Suicide is now the commonest cause of indirect maternal death, and non-English-speaking
immigrants are particularly at risk as well as those aged over 30 years, with previous
psychotic history, poor social support or traumatic delivery. This woman has three such
risk factors.
The diagnosis should always be considered when symptoms do not appear to be backed
up by the examination or investigations. Sometimes delusional symptoms or hallucinations are not elicited because the doctor fails to take a thorough history.
174

General obstetrics

Management
Disease progression can be acute and this woman needs immediate referral to a mother
and baby psychiatric unit for assessment and treatment. Depending on her feelings of harm
towards herself or others, this may need to be under the Mental Health Act. Antidepressants,
antipsychotics and possibly sedation may be needed. The baby may be at risk from
neglect or harm secondary to the psychosis, so close supervision and support is essential.
Recovery is expected within 2 months but repeat pregnancy and non-pregnancy-related
episodes are common.

KEY POINTS

• Postpartum psychosis is generally diagnosed in the community after discharge from
hospital after delivery.

• Women with postpartum psychosis must be admitted to a mother and baby psychiatric
unit, if need be under the Mental Health Act.

CASE 69: ANTI-D
History
A couple attends the obstetric clinic at 20 weeks’ gestation. This is the woman’s fourth
pregnancy and second child. She is 27 years old. She had a spontaneous vaginal delivery
4 years ago and this was followed by two miscarriages, the first at 8 weeks and the second at 14 weeks, for which no cause was identified.
In this pregnancy she has been generally well except for severe hyperemesis which has
now resolved. Her 11–14-week scan confirmed her menstrual dates and she was given a
risk of Down’s syndrome from her nuchal test of 1 in 2543. Her anomaly scan has just
been performed and shows no fetal abnormalities, and normal fetal growth and liquor
volume.

177

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 69
The diagnosis is Rhesus sensitization as the serum anti-D titre is increasing, suggesting
that sometime exposure to Rhesus positive cells has sensitized her, causing her to produce
an immune response (anti-D). This may have occurred if she was not given anti-D at the
time of a previous pregnancy.

Consequences
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-D antibodies cross the placenta and attack fetal Rhesuspositive red cells. This causes fetal haemolysis (haemolytic disease of the newborn or the
fetus) manifesting as fetal anaemia, with subsequent fetal hydrops (excessive accumulation of extravascular fluid e.g. peritoneal, pleural, pericardial). Intrauterine death may
occur if the anaemia is not treated. In milder cases, the baby may be severely jaundiced at
delivery, which may result in neurological impairment. For the mother there is a potential
difficulty crossmatching blood should she have a haemorrhagic complication and need
transfusion, due to the presence of the antibodies.
Management
The maternal antibody level should be monitored two weekly. If the titre exceeds
15 IU/mL, fetal ultrasound should be performed to assess for growth retardation, signs of
hydrops and liquor volume. Cordocentesis (sampling fetal blood by ultrasound-guided
aspiration from the umbilical cord) is needed to determine haemoglobin and to facilitate
fetal blood transfusion. If the antibody titre does not increase further then ultrasound
observation is likely to be sufficient.
In this case, the antibody titre was 15 IU/mL 2 weeks later and the fetus required three in
utero transfusions during the pregnancy, with delivery by Caesarean section at 36 weeks.
Fifteen per cent of women are Rhesus negative, but due to anti-D prophylaxis, the incidence of Rhesus disease is now very low.

!

Potential sensitizing events for rhesus disease

•
•
•
•
•

Miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, termination
Abdominal trauma, invasive tests (e.g. amniocentesis) or external cephalic version
Placental abruption
Delivery
Rhesus-positive blood transfusion to a Rhesus-negative woman

Anti-D previously was given after any potentially sensitizing event, but is now routinely given at 28 and 34 weeks’ gestation. Anti-D should not be given to a woman who
has already developed anti-D antibodies.

KEY POINTS

• Rhesus disease is now rare due to anti-D prophylaxis; however, we must be vigilant to
events that may sensitize a woman.

179

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 70
The diagnosis is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. HIV screening in pregnancy
is recommended for all women in the UK and the latest reported incidence was approximately 0.5 per cent in inner London and less than 0.1 per cent for the rest of the UK. It is
particularly prevalent in women from Africa (1.91 per cent compared with ⬍0.5 per cent
from all other areas). The vast majority of paediatric HIV cases in the UK result from
mother-to-child transmission.
The low CD4 count suggests that this woman needs to commence treatment, but there are
no AIDS-defining illnesses in the history.

Immediate management
The woman needs to be informed of the diagnosis and a second different diagnostic test
performed to confirm the diagnosis. Most women choose to continue with their pregnancies, but she may still wish to consider the option of termination, as she is only 11 weeks’
gestation. She needs urgent referral to the genitourinary medicine specialist for further
examination and investigation for any HIV complications. She will need to start Pneumocystis
carinii prophylaxis in view of the low CD4 count, and she will also need antiretroviral
treatment in view of the significant viral load.
Psychological counselling in relation to the diagnosis, the implications for her, her partner and her offspring (the fetus and her 12-year-old daughter) is very important.

Management of the pregnancy
Pregnancy does not adversely affect the HIV disease process. The important consideration
is therefore the prevention of transmission from mother to child. Untreated, approximately 25 per cent of infants of mothers with HIV will become infected. With appropriate
measures, this is reduced to less than 5 per cent:

•
•
•
•

elective Caesarean section
avoidance of breast-feeding
intravenous zidovudine to the mother prior to delivery (ideally for 4 h)
oral zidovudine to the neonate for 6 weeks postnatally.

More recently, vaginal delivery has been shown to have no effect on infant infection if the
viral load is undetectable at the time of delivery.
Confidentiality is of paramount importance for women diagnosed antenatally with HIV,
and coding systems in the hand-held obstetric notes can be helpful in alerting other
medical staff to the diagnosis.

KEY POINTS

• The incidence of HIV in pregnancy is increasing.
• To decrease vertical transmission the mother should have an elective Caesarean section,
avoid breast-feeding, have intravenous zidovudine prior to delivery and the neonate
should be given zidovudine for 6 weeks.

CASE 71: ITCHING IN PREGNANCY
History
A 36-year-old woman is complaining of itching. She is currently 34 weeks’ gestation in
her first ongoing pregnancy, having had two previous early miscarriages. The itching
started 2 weeks ago and she had been using emollient cream to try and relieve it. Initially
it was mainly over her soles and palms, although it is now more generalized. She is not
aware of having changed her washing powder or soap recently and no one else in her
family has been affected.
She has not experienced any abdominal pain although she does have Braxton Hicks contractions. There is no vaginal discharge or bleeding. She has noticed the baby move more
than 10 times in the last 12 h.

Examination
She looks well. Her blood pressure is 118/76 mmHg and pulse 82/min.
No rash is visible on the face, trunk, limbs, hands or feet except for a few excoriation
marks.
The symphysiofundal height is 34.5 cm and the uterus is soft and non-tender. The fetus
is cephalic with 4/5 palpable abdominally.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this woman?
• How will this diagnosis affect the pregnancy?

181

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 71
The woman is suffering from obstetric cholestasis (OC). This is a pregnancy-specific condition in which there is intrahepatic reduction of bile excretion from the liver, causing a
build-up of serum bile acids. It usually develops in the third trimester. The effect on the
mother is of itching, which may be very distressing. In more severe cases the liver function
or coagulation become deranged and if they do then other diagnoses such as HELLP
syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets – a severe form of
pre-eclampsia) or hepatitis should be considered. An ultrasound should be performed to
exclude other causes of obstruction such as gallstones.
There is no long-term harm to the mother. The effect on the baby however is potentially
much more serious with an association between OC and stillbirth.

Investigations
Liver ultrasound should be performed to exclude other causes of hepatic obstruction.
Fetal ultrasound may be performed for maternal reassurance.
Management
Symptomatic relief is obtained from chlorpheniramine (antihistamine). Ursodeoxycholic
acid can be given to relieve itching in more severe cases, as it reduces serum bile acids.
Vitamin K (needed for clotting factors) should be given orally to the mother to reduce the
risk of fetal or maternal haemorrhage caused by impaired absorption.

Postnatal advice
Maternal liver function returns to normal after delivery, but the mother should be warned
that recurrence may occur in a subsequent pregnancy (50 per cent) or with use of the combined oral contraceptive pill.
KEY POINTS

• Itching in pregnancy may be due to obstetric cholestasis.
• In severe cases maternal liver and coagulation function can become deranged, but
usually the major risk is to the fetus.

• There is a high risk (50 per cent) of recurrence in future pregnancies.

CASE 72: TIREDNESS IN PREGNANCY
History
A 27-year-old woman attends the antenatal clinic at 19 weeks’ gestation in her first ongoing
pregnancy, having had a termination aged 22 years. She is now happy to be pregnant.
She booked with the midwife at 8 weeks and has had normal booking bloods, blood pressure
and ultrasound scan.
She experienced nausea and vomiting until 14 weeks’ gestation. This has now settled but
she remains very tired and feels that she is gaining excessive weight in the pregnancy. She
also feels cold for much of the time, which surprises her as she understood that pregnant
women tend to feel hot.

Examination
The woman appears lethargic and of low mood. Her blood pressure is 115/68 mmHg and
heart rate 58/min. Abdominal examination is unremarkable, with the fundus palpable at
the umbilicus.

• How should the condition be managed?

183

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 72
The full blood count shows mild anaemia, with relatively low mean cell volume. This is
not significant enough to account for the symptoms described.
The thyroid function tests confirm the clinical diagnosis of hypothyroidism. There is no
history of radioactive iodine or surgical treatment, and Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is unlikely
as there has been no history of a hyperthyroid episode. This case therefore probably
represents idiopathic myxoedema.
The symptoms of tiredness, cold intolerance and weight gain may all relate to the hypothyroidism. In addition she may report dry skin, coarse hair, depression or constipation.
Examination may reveal relative bradycardia, blunted deep tendon reflexes or goitre.

Implications for the pregnancy and management
Hypothyroidism occurs in approximately 1 in 100 pregnancies, but this case is unusual to
be diagnosed in pregnancy.
Myxoedematous coma is a very rare consequence of hypothyroidism, associated with a
high mortality rate. It is a medical emergency managed by supportive care and thyroxine
supplementation. In the absence of a coma, thyroxine replacement is still needed and
should be titrated to the TSH and T4 results.
In pregnancy, the thyroxine requirement may increase, and the TSH and T4 should be
checked every trimester once a maintenance regime has been established. The aim should
be to keep the TSH less than 5 mu/L.
(Although the thyroid-binding globulin increases in pregnancy, there is a compensatory
rise in tri-iodothyronine (T3) and T4 production such that the levels of free T3 and free T4
remain similar to non-pregnant values.)

The fetus
Untreated hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of infertility, miscarriage,
stillbirth and pre-eclampsia. The fetal and neonatal outcome is generally good in women
diagnosed and treated appropriately. Anti-TSH antibodies may very rarely cross the placenta and cause neonatal hypothyroidism, and this should be suspected if there are signs
of neonatal goitre.

KEY POINTS

• Untreated hypothyroidism is associated with infertility, miscarriage, low birth weight,
fetal loss, pre-eclampsia and anaemia.

• Women established on thyroxine should have thyroid function monitored once in each
trimester of pregnancy.

CASE 73: DIABETES IN PREGNANCY
History
A 20-year-old woman is pregnant for the first time. The pregnancy is unplanned and the
partner has left but she is supported by her mother and has decided to continue.
She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes aged 15 years. She has been taking long-acting
and short-acting insulin under the care of her general practitioner (GP), but the referral
letter suggests that she has not always been compliant.
She had a positive pregnancy test 2 weeks ago and her GP has referred her urgently to the
antenatal clinic for review in view of the diabetes. By her dates she is now 7 weeks and 5
days’ gestation. She has no other significant gynaecological or medical history.

Examination
The woman has a body mass index of 29 kg/m2. Blood pressure is 131/68 mmHg and pulse
is 81/min.

Questions
• What further investigations need to be arranged?
• Outline the principles of management of the pregnancy.

185

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 73
The investigations can be divided into those for maternal and for fetal wellbeing:

• maternal wellbeing:
• baseline urea and electrolytes
• pre- and post-prandial capillary blood glucose measurements
• fetal wellbeing:
• viability scan (increased risk of miscarriage in diabetic women)
• fetal echocardiography (increased risk of all fetal abnormalities in diabetic offspring)
• detailed anomaly ultrasound examination at 20 weeks.
Diabetic (type 1) pregnancies may be affected by an increase in a range of complications
as well as fetal abnormalities. However optimal control of blood sugar is thought to
reduce the complication risk to near that of a non-diabetic pregnancy, so a large proportion of management is aimed at maintaining very tight blood glucose control. In this particular case, the history, HbA1c and presence of glycosuria suggest that the woman has
generally poor control, providing a particular challenge to management of this pregnancy.

!

Management principles in maternal insulin-dependent diabetes

• Antenatal:

• immediate change to an increased insulin-dosing regime using more frequent
doses to adapt to the increasing demand in pregnancy

• multidisciplinary care with endocrinologist/diabetologist, dietitian, specialist
diabetic nurse, obstetrician and midwife with special interest in diabetic
pregnancies
• full hospital care with regular review, usually every 2 weeks, or more frequently
if control remains poor
• increase in insulin requirements expected throughout the pregnancy
• regular ultrasound assessment from 28 weeks for fetal growth and liquor
volume, in view of the risk of macrosomia and polyhydramnios, secondary to
fetal hyperinsulinaemia
• consideration of induction of labour at 38 weeks to reduce the risk of sudden
stillbirth
• In labour:
• sliding-scale insulin regime in labour (or during Caesarean section)
• aim for vaginal delivery unless contraindicated by obstetric factors
• Postnatal:
• early blood glucose checks and feeding of the baby in view of its
hyperinsulinaemic state
• reduction of maternal insulin regime to the pre-pregnancy regime immediately
after delivery

KEY POINTS

• Type 1 diabetes pregnancies are high risk for mother and fetus and need specialist
•

186

diabetes and obstetric input. Very close blood glucose control should reduce the
complication rate to near that of a non-diabetic mother.
Fetal complications include miscarriage, congenital abnormality, macrosomia, stillbirth
and shoulder dystocia.

PERIPARTUM CARE AND OBSTETRIC
EMERGENCIES
CASE 74: ABSENT FETAL MOVEMENTS
History
A 34-year-old woman at 32 weeks and 4 days’ gestation in her first pregnancy complains
of reduced fetal movements. She normally feels the baby move more than 10 times each
day but yesterday there were only two movements and today there have been none. She
has no significant medical, obstetric or gynaecological history. In this pregnancy she
booked at 10 weeks’ gestation and all her booking blood tests were normal except that
she was discovered not to be immune to rubella and postnatal vaccination was planned.
Her 11–14-week scan, nuchal translucency test and anomaly scan were all normal.
Examination
The blood pressure is 137/73 mmHg and pulse 93/min. She is apyrexial. The symphysiofundal height of the uterus is 31 cm and the fetus is breech on examination. The fetal heart
is auscultated with hand-held Doppler and no heartbeat is heard. An ultrasound scan is
therefore arranged immediately, which confirms the diagnosis of intrauterine fetal death.
Questions
• How should this case be managed?
• Are there any factors in the history or examination to indicate the cause of fetal death
and what investigations should be performed to establish a possible cause?

187

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 74
Immediate management
The baby needs delivery to avoid the possibility of sepsis or disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy developing. This is normally achieved by induction of labour with mifepristone (an antiprogestogen) followed 48 h later by misoprostol (a prostaglandin analogue)
to induce contractions. The woman can go home temporarily after the mifepristone to
avoid the added stress from being on an antenatal or postnatal ward.
In labour, adequate analgesia is essential and patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) is useful.
Rarely there are contraindications to vaginal delivery, such as previous Caesarean sections, in which case operative delivery may be necessary.
The couple should be seen as soon as possible by a bereavement midwife to discuss the
loss, funeral or cremation plans.

Cause of intrauterine death
In this history the only potentially significant factor is the lack of rubella immunity. This
is unlikely to be significant, but rubella immunoglobulin (IgG) should be checked to
exclude recent infection.
The examination is normal except for the tachycardia, which may relate to anxiety and
should be rechecked.

!

Possible causes of intrauterine death

• Maternal:
• diabetes
• infection (e.g. parvovirus, listeria)
• thrombophilia (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome)
• Fetal:
• chromosomal abnormality (e.g. trisomy)
• other genetic abnormality (e.g. Gaucher’s disease)
• haemolytic disease
• cord incident (eg ‘knot’ in cord)
• Placental:
• placental abruption
• uteroplacental insufficiency (e.g. secondary to pre-eclampsia)
• postmaturity
• Unexplained

Investigations
• Maternal:
• full blood count and coagulation screen (to exclude disseminated intravascular
coagulopathy/thrombocytopenia secondary to fetal death)
• random blood glucose and haemoglobin (Hb)A1c
• Kleihauer test (for fetal cells in the maternal circulation, implying significant
fetomaternal haemorrhage)
• anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant (for antiphospholipid syndrome)

188

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

• Fetal:
• swabs for microscopy, culture and sensitivity from the fetus and placenta
• skin biopsy for karyotype
• post mortem (if agreed by parents)

KEY POINTS

• Intrauterine death is commonly unexpected and unexplained.
• Induction of labour should be arranged as soon as possible as there is a risk of the
development of sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulopathy.

CASE 75: LABOUR
History
You are on the labour ward and called to see a 33-year-old woman in labour as the midwife is concerned about the cardiotocograph (CTG).
She is 41 ⫹ 2 weeks’ gestation and this is her first baby. The pregnancy was uncomplicated until 2 days ago when she developed mild hypertension, without proteinuria. In
view of the gestational age a decision was made for induction of labour yesterday. She
had 2 mg prostaglandin gel administered into the vagina at 18.00 last night and again at
06.00 this morning. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred at 10.00 today after
which contractions commenced.

Examination
Blood pressure is 135/68 mmHg, heart rate 90/min and temperature is 37.1°C.
On abdominal palpation the fetus is cephalic, 1/5 palpable, and strong contractions are
felt. Vaginally the cervix is fully effaced and 6 cm dilated. The fetus is cephalic at ischial
spines with mild caput but no moulding. Grade 1 meconium is noted.
INVESTIGATIONS
The CTG is shown in Fig. 75.1.
A decision is made for fetal blood sampling and the result is as follows:

Questions
• How would you interpret the CTG and fetal blood sample result?
• How would you manage the patient?

191

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 75
The CTG shows a baseline of 155 beats/min with reduced variability (5–10 beats/min) and
late decelerations. No accelerations are seen. The CTG is therefore classified as abnormal.
Contractions are 5 in 10.

!

Definition of a late deceleration
A reduction in fetal heart rate from baseline of at least 15 beats for at least 15s

The fetal pH should normally be between 7.25 and 7.35. This fetal blood sample suggests
an acidotic baby (low pH and high negative base excess).
In cases of an abnormal CTG, the fetus may not be compromised, and it is therefore
important to assess the fetal wellbeing with a fetal blood sample before progressing to
operative intervention (unless fetal blood sampling is contraindicated or in cases of persistent fetal bradycardia). In this case the fetal blood sample confirmed that the fetus was
significantly compromised.
The meconium-stained liquor may be a sign of fetal compromise, but at 41 weeks’ gestation meconium may be an incidental finding and is therefore difficult to interpret.

Management
If the cervix were fully dilated and the head below the ischial spines then instrumental
delivery, by ventouse or forceps, would be appropriate. As this is not the case, then immediate delivery by Caesarean section is essential. The important points for an emergency
Caesarean section are:
• the midwife in charge, theatre staff, obstetric consultant, specialist registrar, anaesthetist
and paediatrician should be informed
• the reasons for the proposed procedure should be explained to the woman and
informed consent obtained
• metoclopramide and ranitidine should be given in case of the need for general
anaesthetic
• intravenous access is needed with full blood count and group and save sent
• a urethral catheter should be inserted
• the baby should be delivered within a maximum 30 min after the decision.

KEY POINTS

• Late decelerations in labour are abnormal.
• A fetal blood sample should be taken to confirm fetal status before proceeding to an
operative delivery.

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 76: PERIPARTUM COLLAPSE
History
A woman aged 28 years is in labour when she suddenly collapses. This is her fourth pregnancy and she has had three previous spontaneous vaginal deliveries at term. This pregnancy has been uncomplicated and she has been admitted with contractions at 37 weeks
and 6 days.
On arrival on the labour ward the fetus was palpated to be normal size, cephalic and 3/5
palpable abdominally. The cervix was 3 cm dilated and the membranes were intact. Blood
pressure and urinalysis were normal. Initial auscultation of the fetus was reassuring and
the heart rate has continued to be normal (around 140/min) on intermittent auscultation.
Five minutes ago spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred during a contraction, with
a large gush of clear fluid from the vagina. The woman reported an urge to push at that
stage and then became confused and disorientated saying that she could not breathe and
was going to die. Immediately following this she collapsed.

Examination
The woman is unconscious and unrouseable to painful stimuli. The blood pressure is
98/40 mmHg and heart rate 120/min. The oxygen saturation is 86 per cent on air and
respiratory rate 20/min. The heart sounds are normal but on chest examination there are
inspiratory crackles throughout the chest.
The abdomen is soft with intermittent contractions continuing, and in fact the fetal head
is now visible at the perineum. There is no vaginal bleeding.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis and differential diagnosis?
• How would you manage this woman?

193

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 76
The diagnosis is likely to be an amniotic fluid embolism.
Differential diagnoses include:
• pulmonary embolism
• myocardial infarction
• vasovagal attack.
The factors leading to the diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism rather than one of the differentials are the history of sudden collapse without preceding chest pain, and the fact
that this occurred around the time of rupture of membranes. Amniotic fluid embolism
is also often preceded by premonitory symptoms, restlessness, confusion or cyanosis.
A vasovagal attack is very unlikely as this is usually associated with bradycardia and
would not account for the chest signs or decreased oxygen saturation.
Amniotic fluid embolism occurs when amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation. This
is usually during labour but can occur with maternal trauma or very occasionally after
delivery. It is rare (five cases in the last Confidential Enquiry into Maternal and Child
Health 2000–2002), unpredictable, sudden and commonly fatal. Women who die tend to
do so within an hour or so of becoming unwell, having developed acute hypoxia, coagulopathy and cardiac arrest.

Management
The baby should be delivered immediately as this will facilitate more effective resuscitation of the mother. In this case a simple forceps delivery should be performed. If the baby
was not deliverable vaginally then immediate Caesarean section should be performed.
Massive postpartum haemorrhage is very likely and syntocinon infusion should be commenced with further postpartum haemorrhage strategies such as ergometrine, carboprost,
embolization or hysterectomy anticipated.

!

Resuscitation of the mother after suspected amniotic fluid embolism

• Insertion of two large-bore intravenous cannulae
• Request for full blood count, urea and electrolytes, clotting profile, fibrindegradation products

• Crossmatch 6 units blood and have platelets and fresh-frozen plasma available
• 100 per cent oxygen by bag and mask initially with intubation by the anaesthetist as
soon as possible

• Volume expansion with colloid fluids
• Transfer to intensive care unit as soon as possible

KEY POINTS

• Sudden collapse in labour is an obstetric emergency.
• The diagnosis of amniotic fluid embolism is usually made postmortem.

CASE 77: POSTPARTUM BLEEDING
History
A 32-year-old woman is brought into the delivery suite by ambulance 6 days following a
vaginal delivery at 39 weeks’ gestation. The pregnancy and labour had been unremarkable and the placenta was delivered by controlled cord traction.
Following delivery the woman had been discharged home after 6 h. She reported that the
lochia had been heavy for the first 2 days but that it had then settled to less than a period.
However today she had suddenly felt crampy abdominal pain and felt a gush of fluid, followed by very heavy bleeding. The blood has soaked through clothes and she had passed
large clots, which she describes as the size of her fist. She feels dizzy when she stands up
and is nauseated.

Examination
She is pale with cool and clammy extremities. She is also drowsy. Her blood pressure is
105/50 mmHg and heart rate is 112/min. On abdominal palpation there is minimal tenderness but the uterus is palpable approximately 6 cm above the symphysis pubis.
Speculum examination reveals large clots of blood in the vagina. When these are
removed, the cervix is seen to be open.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What is your immediate and subsequent management?
• Should an ultrasound scan be requested?

195

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 77
The diagnosis is secondary postpartum haemorrhage.

!

Postpartum haemorrhage
Postpartum haemorrhage is defined as the loss of more than 500 mL of blood vaginally
following delivery. Primary postpartum haemorrhage is within 24 h. Secondary
postpartum haemorrhage occurs between 24 h and 6 weeks following delivery.

!

Common causes of postpartum haemorrhage

•
•
•
•
•

Retained placental tissue
Vaginal trauma
Endometrial infection
Coagulopathy (e.g. following placental abruption)
Uterine atony

Immediate management
This woman is in hypovolaemic shock and needs immediate resuscitation. Two wide-bore
cannulae should be inserted and blood sent for full blood count, urea and electrolytes,
clotting and crossmatch of 4 units, with further red cells, platelets or fresh-frozen plasma
requested depending on further evaluation and blood results.
Immediate intravenous fluid should be administered, usually colloid as volume expansion
to maintain cardiac output.
The uterus should be rubbed suprapubically, and if this fails then bimanually, pending
administration of 500 μg ergometrine and commencing a syntocinon infusion. These measures stem the blood loss and aid immediate resuscitation while the diagnosis is investigated.
A urinary catheter should be inserted to allow close fluid balance monitoring and renal
function.
The anaesthetist and senior obstetrician should be called urgently.

Subsequent management
The fact that the cervix is open is pathognomonic of retained tissue, and evacuation of
retained products of conception should be arranged once the woman has been resuscitated
and blood is available.
In view of the haemodynamic instability, general anaesthetic is preferred.
Intravenous antibiotics should be given.
The woman should be monitored initially in a high-dependency setting until clinically
and haematologically stable.
Although she is likely to have had a coagulopathy at admission, she is still at high risk of venous
thromboembolism as she is probably septic, postpartum and has undergone anaesthetic.
Thromboembolic stockings and heparin should therefore be administered postoperatively.
196

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

Ultrasound scan
Ultrasound scan would not be indicated in this scenario. First, an open cervix implies
retained products and it would therefore be superfluous. Second, an examination under
anaesthetic is warranted anyway to establish any other cause of bleeding, such as vaginal
or perineal trauma. Third, retained products may be confused with blood clot on postpartum ultrasound.

KEY POINTS

• Postpartum women with retained products of conception become very ill very quickly.
Once the diagnosis is made they need intravenous antibiotics and urgent evacuation of
the uterus.

CASE 78: LABOUR
History
A 31-year-old woman is admitted with contractions at 40 weeks’ gestation. This is her
fourth pregnancy, having had two terminations approximately 10 years ago and an elective Caesarean section for breech presentation 3 years ago.
During this pregnancy she has had an amniocentesis because of a high estimated risk for
Down’s syndrome at 11–14-week scan. However a normal karyotype was found and subsequent fetal echocardiography was normal. In view of her previous Caesarean section she was
seen by the obstetric consultant in the antenatal clinic at 28 weeks to discuss mode of delivery. After counselling, a plan was agreed for a vaginal delivery.
She was admitted with spontaneous rupture of membranes after which she had begun to
contract irregularly. The contractions became stronger and more regular over the next 2 h
after admission and she requested an epidural. Vaginal examination was performed and the
cervix was found to be 4cm dilated. The head was in the occipito transverse position, 1 cm
above the level of the ischial spines. There was a small amount of caput and moulding.
An epidural was sited and an indwelling urinary catheter inserted. Three hours later the
woman reported more severe pain which did not disappear between contractions. At that
time approximately 200mL of fresh blood was seen coming from the vagina.

Examination
The heart rate is 105/min and blood pressure 105/58 mmHg. The woman feels warm and well
perfused. The abdomen is soft and the uterus is also soft but very tender, with easy palpation
of fetal parts. On vaginal examination the cervix is 6 cm dilated and the fetal head feels high
in the pelvis and poorly applied to the cervix. The catheter contains blood-stained urine.
INVESTIGATIONS
The cardiotocograph (CTG) is described below and shown in Fig. 78.1.

The CTG shows that the contractions have stopped. This can be due to the pressure transducer losing contact with the patient, but in this case the combination of other factors and
the fact that the uterus is soft on palpation suggests that the contractions really have suddenly stopped.
The diagnosis is of uterine rupture. The constant pain, vaginal bleeding, sudden loss of
contractions, change in CTG, easy palpation of fetal parts and haematuria are all classic
features. Uterine rupture is thought to occur in up to 1 in 200 labours following Caesarean
section. It is more common when labour is induced with prostaglandins or augmented
with oxytocin infusion, but may occur even in an apparently ‘normal’ labour such as this.
Uterine rupture may very rarely occur in women without previous Caesarean section,
either because of previous surgery such as myomectomy, with trauma, or spontaneously.
The major risk factor for uterine rupture is previous Caesarean section.
General resuscitation measures should be commenced immediately:
•
•
•
•

large-bore intravenous access
full blood count, coagulation test
6 unit crossmatch requested
intravenous fluids.

The emergency theatre team, senior obstetrician and paediatrician should be summoned
and the woman transferred to theatre immediately for laparotomy, which may need to be
under general anaesthetic as the epidural is unlikely to be adequate for laparotomy within
a few minutes.
At laparotomy, the fetus should be delivered from the abdomen and the placenta removed.
It may be possible to repair the uterine defect. However, if bleeding is substantial then
other measures may need to be employed such as a B-Lynch haemostatic suture or even
hysterectomy.
If the uterus is preserved, then any future pregnancies should be very closely monitored
with elective delivery by Caesarean section at 37 weeks’ gestation.

!

Complications of uterine rupture

• Fetal:

• death
• cerebral palsy from hypoxic brain injury
• Maternal:

• postpartum haemorrhage
• hysterectomy
• coagulopathy

KEY POINTS

• Dehiscence of a previous Caesarean section scar can range from a dramatic to subtle
presentation.

• Change in CTG pattern, persistent abdominal pain cessation of contractions, maternal
tachycardia or haematuria should alert the clinician to the possibility of rupture.

CASE 79: LABOUR
History
A midwife is concerned about a cardiotocograph (CTG) on the labour ward. The woman is
42 years old and had an elective Caesarean section 3 years ago for twins. After counselling,
she decided to opt for a vaginal delivery in this pregnancy. She is now 38 weeks 1 day’s
gestation and presented to the labour ward an hour ago. She was found to have contractions, three in 10 min lasting 50 s each. There was no reported rupture of membranes.
At the time of arrival, examination revealed a symphysiofundal height of 39 cm, cephalic
presentation and 3/5 palpable abdominally. Vaginal examination revealed intact membranes with the head 1 cm above the ischial spines, occipitoanterior position and the
cervix 5 cm dilated.
She was commenced on continuous CTG monitoring (because of the previous Caesarean
section), which showed an initial baseline rate of 135/min, good variability, accelerations
and no decelerations.
Twenty minutes ago spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred with clear liquor leaking.

Questions
• Describe and classify the CTG.
• What are the possible causes for this CTG pattern?
• What should be your subsequent management?

201

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 79
The CTG shows a baseline rate of 130/min and variability of 15/min. There are variable
decelerations to approximately 70/min lasting 30–90 s. Although there are no normal
accelerations there is ‘shouldering’ before and after the decelerations, a sign of the fetus
increasing its heart rate in response to the increased blood flow after the deceleration.
This CTG is unsatisfactory because the tocometer is not registering contractions.

!

Definition of variable decelerations
Decelerations that vary in shape, size and timing

The presence of variable decelerations with no other suspicious features leads to the classification of this CTG as non-reassuring.

Management
In this situation, the recent history of spontaneous rupture of membranes indicates immediate vaginal assessment to rule out cord prolapse as the cause of the suddenly abnormal
CTG. This would be a classic presentation for cord prolapse, though the condition itself is
very rare.
Much more commonly variable decelerations are caused by cord compression (by the
uterine wall or, for example, by the fetal hand)
If, as is normally the case, the cord is not palpable and the baby is not easily deliverable by
instrumental delivery, then further assessment of fetal wellbeing is required as the abnormality of the CTG has already lasted 20 min. This should be by fetal blood sampling (FBS).
In this case FBS gave the following result:
pH: 7.23
Base excess: ⫺4.0 mmol/L
With a pH between 7.20 and 7.25, it is reasonable to manage the woman expectantly and
repeat the FBS in 30 min. This was done and the second result was:
pH: 7.22
Base excess: ⫺5.1 mmol/L
At this stage the woman was fully dilated and pushing involuntarily, and the baby was
delivered spontaneously soon after the sample was taken.
In this case the fetal blood pH was relatively reassuring despite the dramatic appearance
of the CTG. It is possible to avoid Caesarean section in such cases with appropriate use of
FBS. It should be remembered that FBS is contraindicated in certain conditions such as
maternal HIV, hepatitis or potential fetal-bleeding disorders.

KEY POINTS

• CTGs are classified according to national guidelines (as shown in Tables 79.1 and 79.2).
• FBS can often confirm fetal wellbeing despite a non-reassuring or abnormal CTG, and
thus avoid an unnecessary operative delivery.

CASE 80: LABOUR
History
A 22-year-old woman in her second pregnancy has arrived on the labour ward at 38
weeks 3 days. She had a normal delivery 18 months ago. This pregnancy has been complicated by persistent vomiting until 20 weeks, and more recently by anaemia. She reports
contractions commencing approximately 4 h ago. She took paracetamol at home and tried
to relieve the pain with a bath, but now feels she cannot cope with the pain.
She had a show 2 days ago but has had no bleeding since then and has not noticed any
vaginal leak. She has felt the baby moving normally all day.

Examination
The blood pressure is 110/58 mmHg and heart rate is 98/min. The presentation is cephalic
with 2/5 palpable abdominally. Uterine contractions are palpable and the uterus is nonirritable. On vaginal examination the cervix is 5 cm dilated and the head is 1 cm above the
ischial spines. The fetus is right occipitotransverse with mild caput and moulding. The
membranes are intact but rupture spontaneously during examination, with clear liquor
draining.
The woman requests an epidural for pain relief and is therefore commenced on continuous cardiotocograph monitoring. After 20 min you are called in to review the situation.

Questions
• Describe the CTG.
• What are the possible causes of this CTG?
• What management would be appropriate now?

205

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 80
CTG interpretation
The initial 15 min of CTG shows a baseline of 145/min with normal variability (12/min)
and no visible acceleration or decelerations. Following this there is a drop in fetal heart
rate to 70/min for 7 min before gradual recovery to 125/min. Contractions are 2 in 10 until
the tocograph becomes unreadable.
This is a previously low-risk pregnancy and this CTG shows a fetal bradycardia (reduction
in baseline heart rate to below 100/min). In many cases no cause is identified.

!

Causes of fetal bradycardia

•
•
•
•

Placental abruption
Uterine rupture
Maternal hypotension (e.g. after epidural insertion)
Bleeding vasa praevia

Management
If a bradycardia continues for more than 5 min, plans should be made to deliver immediately by ‘crash’ Caesarean section under general anaesthetic. The labour ward theatre
team should be called (including anaesthetist, obstetric registrar, paediatrician, midwife in
charge, theatre staff) and the woman transferred to the operating theatre. On occasion the
bradycardia recovers as preparation is underway for the Caesarean, in which case the plan
may be reviewed. Otherwise the baby should be delivered immediately.
In this case the bradycardia did not recover and the baby was delivered within 12 min of
the decision being made. No cause was found for the bradycardia at Caesarean section.

INVESTIGATIONS
The umbilical artery cord blood analysis at delivery was:
Artery
pH
7.06
pCO2
8.20 mmHg
Base excess
–6.4 mmol/L

Vein
7.23
6.30 mmHg
–5.2 mmol/L

The baby initially made poor respiratory effort and had a heart rate less than 100/min, but
recovered quickly with drying and warming. The Apgar score for the baby was 5 at 1 min
and 9 at 5 min.
KEY POINTS

• Fetal bradycardia persisting for more than 5 min necessitates immediate delivery.
• There is no place for a fetal blood sample in the management of fetal bradycardia.
• A cause is not always found for an abnormal CTG.

CASE 81: PAIN AND FEVER IN PREGNANCY
History
A woman aged 26 years is referred by her general practitioner. She is 36 weeks’ gestation
in her fourth pregnancy, having had one miscarriage and two term vaginal deliveries.
In this pregnancy she has been seen twice in the day assessment unit, the first time at 31
weeks for an episode of vaginal bleeding for which no cause was attributed. The second
time was at 35 weeks after she awoke with damp bed sheets. No liquor had been detected
on speculum examination at the time and she was discharged. For the last 2 days she has
been feeling generally unwell with a fever, decreased appetite and a headache as well as
abdominal discomfort. She reports the baby moving less than normal for the last few days,
with approximately 8–10 movements per day.
She has not noticed any vaginal bleeding but her discharge has been more than normal
and there is an offensive odour to it.

Examination
Her temperature is 37.8°C, blood pressure 106/68 mmHg and heart rate 109/min. On
abdominal palpation symphysiofundal height is 34 cm and the fetus is cephalic with 3/5
palpable. There is generalized uterine tenderness and irritability. On speculum examination the cervix is closed and a green/grey discharge is seen within the vagina.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• How should this woman be managed?
207

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 81
The diagnosis is of chorioamnionitis secondary to prolonged preterm rupture of membranes. Although spontaneous rupture of membranes was not confirmed at the previous
attendance at 35 weeks, it seems probable that in fact this did occur at that time.
Ascending organisms have thus colonized the uterus and resulted in infection. The result
is a maternal systemic reaction causing her symptoms: tachycardia, tenderness, leucocytosis, and raised C-reactive protein.
The fetus is also affected as shown by the fetal tachycardia.
Chorioamnionitis is a significant cause of both fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality, and should be treated as an obstetric emergency.
Management should be instigated immediately. Initial microbial specimens should be
obtained from high vaginal swab and maternal blood cultures.
Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotic should be commenced to cover both anaerobic and
aerobic organisms. Intravenous fluids should be commenced to counter the effects of
vasodilatation and pyrexia, and because the woman is unable to drink adequately.
Paracetamol should be given regularly for the pyrexia and abdominal discomfort.
The baby needs delivery by induction of labour – women with chorioamnionitis often
labour rapidly. Risks of Caesarean section in the presence of infection are significant in
terms of bleeding, uterine atony and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. However
continuous CTG should be employed and immediate Caesarean section performed if it
deteriorates.
Steroids (to prevent potential respiratory distress syndrome) are contraindicated in this
woman as they may increase the severity of infection.
After delivery, the baby will need to be reviewed by the paediatrician and given a septic
screen and course of intravenous antibiotics.

KEY POINTS

• Chorioamnionitis is a significant cause of fetal and maternal morbidity and must be
managed aggressively with antibiotics and induction of labour.

• An uncomplicated fetal tachycardia should be managed with fluids and paracetamol to
the mother, with antibiotics if infection is suspected.

• Delivery should be expedited if any more suspicious CTG features develop.

CASE 82: HEADACHE IN PREGNANCY
History
A 32-year-old woman who is 34 weeks’ gestation has felt generally unwell for 24 h. She
has a headache and has noticed odd visual symptoms such as ‘wobbling’ of objects. She
initially felt that she had a viral infection but the symptoms are worsening and she thought
she should get ‘checked out’.
She has epigastric discomfort and nausea. Her legs have been swollen for some weeks but
now her hands and face are puffy. The baby has been moving normally and there is no
lower abdominal pain and no bleeding or abnormal discharge.
She booked in the pregnancy at 10 weeks with a blood pressure of 107/60 mmHg. Booking
blood tests and 12- and 20-week ultrasound scans were normal.

Examination
Her blood pressure is 140/85 mmHg and pulse rate 98/min. There is moderate oedema to
the knees and she also appears digitally and facially oedematous. The fundi are normal.
On abdominal palpation there is mild right upper quadrant and epigastric tenderness. The
uterus is not tender and symphysiofundal height measures 33 cm. The fetus is cephalic
and free, with fetal parts easily felt on palpation. Patellar reflexes are normal.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this patient?

209

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 82
The diagnosis is HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets).
HELLP syndrome is part of the spectrum of pre-eclampsia, and is a serious condition with
a relatively high maternal mortality (1 per cent) and perinatal mortality (up to 60 per
cent). Maternal complications include placental abruption, renal failure, liver failure and
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). Fetal complications arise from prematurity, abruption and uteroplacental insufficiency.
The diagnosis is made on the blood test results showing the relevant features of HELLP. In
this case there is also pregnancy-induced hypertension and proteinuria. However these
clinical features do not need to be present to make the diagnosis of HELLP syndrome.
HELLP may present antenatally or in the first few days postpartum.
The symptom of epigastric or right upper quadrant pain should always raise suspicion in a
pregnant woman, as it is a sign of liver capsule stretching and may precede liver rupture.

Investigation and management
The woman needs urgent delivery. This may be vaginal, with regular monitoring of the
blood test results and proteinuria every 6 h. Hourly blood pressure should be recorded.
A clotting screen is helpful to indicate any severe risk of bleeding at delivery. If the cervix
is unfavourable and the woman is nulliparous then Caesarean section may be considered,
but the increased risk of associated bleeding should be borne in mind.
Fetal wellbeing should be checked with cardiotocography and possibly ultrasound for
growth, liquor volume and umbilical artery Doppler. The fetal parts being easily palpable
may be suggestive of oligohydramnios from uteroplacental insufficiency.
Steroids should be administered to reduce the chance of respiratory distress syndrome,
though there may be insufficient time before delivery for them to the effective.
Postnatally the woman should be monitored in hospital for up to 5 days as the condition
may deteriorate before recovery. Once recovery occurs it is usually complete, but there
is an increased risk of pre-eclampsia (and possibly HELLP syndrome) in subsequent
pregnancies.
KEY POINTS

• HELLP syndrome is a very serious condition and requires urgent delivery.

CASE 83: PROLONGED PREGNANCY
History
A 23-year-old primigravid woman is seen by the midwife in the antenatal clinic at
41 weeks’ gestation. She had an ultrasound scan at 12 weeks that was consistent with her
menstrual dates. At 28 weeks she developed pelvic pain and a diagnosis of symphysiopelvic dysfunction (SPD) was made. She has had regular physiotherapy and needs to use
a stick to walk on most days. She has been otherwise well in the pregnancy and all blood
tests have been within the normal range. She reports normal fetal movements. There is no
reported vaginal loss.
Examination
Her blood pressure is 126/72 mmHg. The symphysiofundal height is 40 cm and the presentation is cephalic, 2/5 palpable. Subjectively the liquor volume feels normal.
You note that she appears unhappy, and on questioning she says that she is just very
uncomfortable as a result of the SPD.
INVESTIGATIONS
Urinalysis: negative

Question
• Explain the appropriate management for this woman from now.

211

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 83
The estimated due date is only a guide and women are expected to deliver between 3 weeks
before and 2 weeks after this date. Twenty-five per cent of women will not have delivered
by 41 weeks (18 per cent by 42 weeks). As this woman is 41 weeks, plans should be made
for induction of labour if spontaneous labour does not occur in the next few days.

Cervical sweep
A cervical sweep involves a vaginal examination to assess the cervix, and insertion of the
finger through the cervical os if possible and then sweeping it around the inside of the
lower uterus, trying to separate the membranes from the cervix. Such membrane sweeping decreases the rate of prolonged pregnancy (⬎42 weeks).
Induction of labour
Admission should be planned for induction of labour between 41 and 42 weeks, assuming
spontaneous labour has not occurred. This gestation is used because stillbirth increases
with gestational age above 37 weeks. There is a similar increase in neonatal mortality.

!

Stillbirth rate according to gestation

• 1 per 3000 births at 37 weeks
• 2 per 3000 births at 42 weeks
• 3 per 3000 births at 43 weeks
Although the woman is in some discomfort, early induction should be avoided as far as
possible, as success of induction increases with gestation.

Method of induction of labour
Prostaglandins should be used for induction of labour with insertion of prostaglandin gel
(or pessary) into the posterior fornix of the vagina. The fetus should be monitored by
cardiotocograph for 20 min before and after as prostaglandins may cause uterine hyperstimulation and fetal distress.
If spontaneous contractions have not started or membranes ruptured after 6 h, then the
prostaglandin should be repeated. If contractions have commenced (regardless of whether
membranes are intact) then vaginal examination should be repeated every 4 h.
If membrane rupture has occurred but contractions have not started after 2–4 h, then
an oxytocin infusion would normally be commenced. Subsequent management is as for
normal labour.

Expectant management beyond 42 weeks
If the woman declines induction of labour by 42 weeks, fetal wellbeing should be assessed
with ultrasound for fetal growth and liquor volume. Fetal movements should be monitored, with induction regularly reconsidered.
KEY POINTS

• Perinatal mortality and morbidity increase with advancing gestational age, and
induction of labour is therefore recommended between 41 and 42 weeks’ gestation.

• Prostaglandins are the main drugs used for induction, and repeated administrations may
be necessary.

CASE 84: PAIN IN PREGNANCY
History
A 28-year-old woman nulliparous woman is admitted to the labour ward at 31 weeks and
6 days’ gestation, with abdominal pain.
In this pregnancy she has had chronic low back pain for which she has been under the
physiotherapist. She has also been treated for confirmed urinary tract infections on two
occasions. She underwent two large-loop excisions of the transformation zone (LLETZ)
procedures some years ago. Since then her smears have been normal, the most recent
being 10 months ago.
Yesterday she noticed an increase in her discharge with some dark vaginal bleeding and
abdominal discomfort. She thought the symptoms may have related to something she had
eaten but she now feels intermittent abdominal pain every few minutes, with no pain in
between episodes. Fetal movements are normal.
There is no history of leaking of liquor. She has urinary frequency, though this has not
worsened recently. She is always constipated.

Examination
The woman is apyrexial with blood pressure 109/60 mmHg and heart rate 96/min.
Symphysiofundal height is 30 cm and moderate contractions are palpated lasting approximately 35 s. The fetus is breech on palpation and the presenting part feels engaged.
No liquor is visible on speculum examination. On vaginal examination the cervix is
effaced and 3 cm dilated, with the breech felt –2 cm above the ischial spines and membranes intact.
INVESTIGATIONS
Cardiotocograph (CTG):
Baseline rate 145/min, variability normal (15/min)
Accelerations present
No decelerations observed
Uterine activity recorded 3 in 10

Questions
• What is the diagnosis?
• What factors predispose to this?
• How would you manage this woman?

213

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 84
The woman is in premature labour – she has regular painful contractions (as confirmed by
the history, palpation and uterine activity demonstrated on CTG) and the cervix is effaced
and dilated.
In this history the possible risk factors are the LLETZ procedures and urinary tract infections, raising the possibility that she could be in premature labour due to a further
untreated urinary tract infection. However, many women in premature labour have no
obvious risk factors.

!

Risk factors for premature labour

• Maternal:

•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

history of premature delivery
young maternal age
illegal drug use and smoking
chorioamnionitis
pre-eclampsia
polyhydramnios
sepsis
previous cervical surgery/cervical incompetence
• Fetal:
• intrauterine growth retardation
• congenital abnormality
• multiple pregnancy

Management
• Prevention of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS):
• antenatal corticosteroids (usually betamethasone intramuscular) prior to delivery
reduce the incidence of RDS in premature infants, and ideally two doses should be
administered 12 h apart prior to delivery.
• tocolysis (with atosiban, a beta-agonist or nifedipine) should be started immediately to try and delay labour in order for the steroids to be maximally effective
(24 h), and then discontinued. The other indication for tocolysis is to settle contractions long enough for in utero transfer of the mother to a unit with facilities to care
for a 31-week baby. In other situations tocolysis does not seem to improve fetal
outcome, even though it may prolong time to delivery.
• Mode of delivery: although there is evidence that full-term singleton breech babies
should be delivered by Caesarean section (rather than vaginally), there is no clear
evidence that this applies to preterm infants, and as premature delivery is generally
reasonably quick, vaginal delivery should be considered. The contraindications to
this would be signs of fetal compromise on CTG, or maternal objection.
• Postnatal care: the paediatric team should be informed of any woman in actual or
threatened preterm labour, in order that appropriate arrangements are made for care
of the infant after delivery.
KEY POINTS

• Premature delivery is the major cause of perinatal mortality.
• If a woman goes into premature labour one must consider prevention of RDS and mode
of delivery.

CASE 85: DELIVERY
History
You are urgently called to the delivery room of a 26-year-old woman to help deliver the
baby. The mother is 41 weeks into her second pregnancy, having had a normal term delivery of a 3.97 kg female infant 2 years ago.
Nuchal and anomaly scans were normal and antenatal care was unremarkable. The baby
was moving normally prior to labour.
When she arrived on labour ward contracting, the symphysiofundal height was noted to
be 41 cm.
At first assessment the cervix was 3 cm dilated and she was advised to continue mobilizing. Spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred and she was examined again after 4 h
and the cervix was still 3 cm. A syntocinon infusion was commenced to augment labour
and an epidural sited, with cardiotocograph monitoring also commenced. After 4 h, the
cervix was 7 cm and then 10 cm after a further 4 h. The woman was encouraged to start
active pushing and 35 min later the head had crowned in a direct occipitoanterior position.
The midwife noticed that the head did not extend normally on the perineum and that the
chin appeared to be wedged against the perineum. She had attempted delivery of the
shoulders with the next two contractions but this had not been achieved.

ANSWER 85
This condition, where the fetal shoulders and trunk fail to deliver after the head, is shoulder dystocia. Complications include perinatal mortality, hypoxic encephalopathy, brachial
plexus injury (e.g. Erb’s palsy), as well as maternal postpartum haemorrhage and third- or
fourth-degree tear.
Shoulder dystocia occurs in 1 in 200 deliveries and is associated with various risk factors
(though in many cases it cannot be predicted). In this case the woman had a relatively
large previous baby, this baby had persistently been large on examination, she is post
dates and progress was a little slow.

Management
This is an obstetric emergency and the emergency bell should be activated with help summoned from the senior midwife, other available midwives, anaesthetist and paediatrician,
as well as the most senior obstetrician available.
A series of manoeuvres are practiced by labour ward staff at ‘skills and drills’ sessions
in preparation for such an event. These are incorporated into the mnemonic HELPERR,
which is taken from the Advanced Life Support in Obstetrics (ALSO®) programme. The
programme and its copyright are owned by the American Academy of Family Physicians
(www.aafp.org/also).
1 Call for H elp.
2 Consider Episiotomy: this will not allow the shoulders to deliver but will allow manipulation of the baby to achieve delivery.
3 Elevate the L egs (McRoberts Manoeuvre): the procedure involves flexing the maternal
hips, thus positioning the thighs up onto the abdomen. This simulates the squatting
position, with the advantage of increasing the inlet diameter.
4 Suprapubic Pressure: external manual suprapubic pressure is applied to the fetus’ anterior
shoulder, in such a way that the shoulder will adduct or collapse anteriorly and encourage
the baby’s shoulder to pass under the symphysis pubis. Pressure is at first constant for 60 s,
and then in a rocking fashion for a further 60 s.
5 The operator’s fingers should E nter the pelvis: the index and middle fingers should be
inserted past the fetal head and behind the anterior shoulder, then pressure exerted on
the back of that shoulder to attempt to rotate the baby (Rubin’s manoeuvre). This can
also be tried with the posterior shoulder from the front of the fetus, rotating the shoulder toward the symphysis in the same direction as with the Rubin II manoeuvre (Wood
screw manoeuvre).
6 Removal of the posterior arm: the clinician must insert his or her hand far into the vagina
and locate the posterior arm. Once the arm is located, the elbow should be flexed so that the
forearm may be delivered in a sweeping motion over the anterior chest wall of the fetus.
7 Roll onto all fours position: If the above manoeuvres fail, the woman should be Rolled
onto the all fours position which increases the true obstetrical conjucate by as much as
10 mm and the sagittal measurement of the pelvic outlet up to 20 mm.
216

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

Delivery usually occurs by stage 5. If it fails then last resort measures are the procedure of
replacing the fetal head into the pelvis and performing emergency Caesarean section or
performing symphysiotomy (if caesarean delivery is not an option) to enlarge the pelvic
diameters.

KEY POINTS

• Shoulder dystocia is an obstetric emergency and requires immediate action.
• All health professionals delivering babies must be well rehearsed with the appropriate
manoeuvres.

CASE 86: HEADACHE IN PREGNANCY
History
A 17-year-old girl is admitted to the labour ward by ambulance because of a severe
headache and reduced fetal movements. This is her first pregnancy. She did not discover
she was pregnant until very late and was uncertain of her last menstrual period date so
was dated by ultrasound scan at 23 weeks. According to that scan she is now 37 weeks.
When she was first booked in the antenatal clinic her blood pressure was 120/68 mmHg
and urinalysis negative. The blood pressure was last checked 1 week ago and was
132/74 mmHg and urine was negative again. Booking blood tests were all normal.
This morning she woke with a frontal headache which has persisted despite paracetamol.
She says that her vision is a bit blurred but she cannot be more specific about this. She
also reports nausea and epigastric discomfort, but has not vomited. She denies leg or finger swelling.

Examination
The blood pressure is 164/106 mmHg. This is repeated twice at 15 min intervals and is
found to be 160/110 mmHg and 164/112 mmHg. She is apyrexial and her heart rate is
83/min. Her face is minimally swollen and fundoscopy is normal. Cardiac and respiratory
examinations are normal. Abdominally she is tender in the epigastrium and beneath the
right costal margin, but the uterus is soft and non-tender. The fetus is cephalic and 3/5
palpable.
The legs and fingers are mildly oedematous and lower limb reflexes are very brisk, with
clonus.

219

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 86
The woman has pre-eclampsia with rapid onset and severity of symptoms and signs suggesting severe or ‘fulminant’ disease. She is at high risk of developing eclampsia.
The headache and visual disturbance are typical features of cerebral oedema; the right
upper quadrant pain of subcapsular liver swelling and the proteinuria occurs from renal
involvement.
The blood tests show typical features of severe pre-eclampsia:
• elevated liver transaminases
• elevated urate
• elevated creatinine.
The platelet count is at the lower end of the normal range for pregnancy and if reduced
further, with raised bilirubin would suggest development of HELLP syndrome (haemolysis, elevated liver enzymes and low platelets).

Management
This is an obstetric emergency and the senior midwife, anaesthetist and senior obstetrician
should be informed immediately. The only definitive treatment for pre-eclampsia is delivery of the baby, but the maternal status must be stabilized first. In this case she should be
admitted and have an intravenous cannula inserted. Blood should be sent for coagulation
and for group and save. A urinary catheter should be inserted and fluid input and output
carefully monitored for oliguria as a sign of impending renal failure.
In pre-eclampsia although the extracellular fluid is increased (third space), the intravascular volume is generally depleted, so fluid input should be managed carefully with the
help of an anaesthetist, balancing adequate renal perfusion with the risk of overload and
pulmonary oedema. Where the urine output is decreased, a central venous line may be
needed for more accurate assessment of volume status.
The woman should be given an antihypertensive to reduce her blood pressure (thus reducing the risk of cerebral haemorrhage). If initial oral antihypertensives are not effective, a
titrated intravenous infusion should be used.
Magnesium sulphate infusion reduces the risk of an eclamptic fit in women with severe
pre-eclampsia and should be commenced.
The CTG shows reduced variability and occasional variable decelerations. This suggests
that the reduced fetal movements may be due to fetal distress, probably from uteroplacental insufficiency. Caesarean section would therefore be the mode of delivery of choice, but
only when the maternal blood pressure is under control and the coagulation screen result
is available.
Postnatally the condition may not improve for 48 h or more, and the woman should be
nursed in a high-dependency setting until the blood pressure is under control, renal output is normal, symptoms have settled and blood results are returning to normal.
KEY POINTS

• Pre-eclampsia causes widespread endothelial dysfunction, with effects on all the body
•

systems. Death can occur from cerebral haemorrhage, eclampsia, pulmonary oedema,
renal failure or hepatic rupture.
Immediate stabilization of the mother should precede delivery of the baby.

CASE 87: LABOUR
History
A 36-year-old nulliparous woman at term started having uterine tightenings yesterday
morning. These were intermittent initially and she managed to cope with a hot bath and
paracetamol, but they have now become increasingly painful and frequent. This morning
she came in because she had ruptured membranes at home an hour and a half ago. She
has continued to notice normal fetal movements.
Since arrival the blood pressure, temperature and heart rate have been within the normal
range and the liquor has remained clear. She has been examined several times and the
findings of each examination are shown in Table 87.1. After the examination at 14.15 a
syntocinon infusion was commenced.

Questions
• How do you interpret the examination and CTG findings?
• What factors are associated with this pattern of labour?
• How would you manage this woman?
221

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 87
The examination findings show failure to progress in the first stage in labour. Once labour
has been established, the cervix is expected to dilate at approximately 1 cm/h. In this case,
despite attempted augmentation with an oxytocic (syntocinon), there has only been 3 cm
dilatation in almost 12 h.
This situation is most common in nulliparous women and is termed primary dysfunctional
labour. Other associations are malposition (commonly the occipitoposterior position) and
increased fetal size (cephalopelvic disproportion).

Management
Maximum contractions have been achieved (4 in 10 min) with the oxytocic for several
hours, and there are increasing signs of obstruction (caput and moulding of the fetal
head). In view of this the only management option available is to perform an emergency
Caesarean section.
The CTG is normal, but without intervention, the likely scenario is for fetal compromise to
occur. Therefore once the decision has been made to proceed with Caesarean section, oxytocin should be discontinued to reduce the effect of the prolonged contractions on the
baby. Delivery should be arranged within 30 min of the decision being made.
The important points in arranging delivery by emergency Caesarean section in this
case are:
•
•
•
•

informed consent, after appropriate explanation, by the mother
informing the anaesthetist and assistant
informing the theatre staff and paediatrician
ranitidine and metoclopramide to the mother (usually intravenous) to minimize gastric
aspiration should general anaesthetic be needed
• insertion of an indwelling urinary catheter
• transfer of the woman to theatre, with continuous CTG until delivery.

KEY POINTS

• In a primigravid woman the rate of cervical dilatation in normal labour is 1 cm/h.
• Inefficient uterine action must be corrected with syntocinon augmentation before a
diagnosis of ‘failure to progress’ is made.

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 88: POSTPARTUM BLEEDING
History
A 39-year-old woman in her first pregnancy delivered twin sons 2 h ago. There were no
significant antenatal complications. She had been prescribed ferrous sulphate and folic
acid during the pregnancy as anaemia prophylaxis, and her last haemoglobin was
10.9 g/dL at 38 weeks.
The fetuses were within normal range for growth and liquor volume on serial scan estimations. A vaginal delivery was planned and she went into spontaneous labour at
38 weeks and 4 days. Due to decelerations in the cardiotocograph (CTG) for the first twin,
both babies were delivered by ventouse after 30 min active pushing in the second stage.
The midwife recorded both placentae as appearing complete.
As this was a twin pregnancy, an intravenous cannula had been inserted when labour was
established and an epidural had been sited. The lochia has been heavy since delivery but
the woman is now bleeding very heavily and passing large clots of blood.
On arrival in the room you find that the sheets are soaked with blood and there is also
approximately 500 mL of blood clot in a kidney dish on the bed.

Examination
The woman is conscious but drowsy and pale. The temperature is 35.9°C, blood pressure
120/70 mmHg and heart rate 112/min. The peripheries feel cool. The uterus is palpable to
the umbilicus and feels soft. The abdomen is otherwise soft and non-tender. On vaginal
inspection there is a second-degree tear which has been sutured but you are unable to
assess further due to the presence of profuse bleeding.
The midwife sent blood tests 30 min ago because she was concerned about the blood loss
at the time.

Questions
• What is the diagnosis and what are the likely causes?

223

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 88
The diagnosis is primary postpartum haemorrhage (PPH), defined as the loss of more than
500 mL of blood in the first 24 h following delivery. This classification applies even if the
blood is lost at Caesarean section or while awaiting placental delivery.

!

Causes of and risk factors for postpartum haemorrhage

• Uterine atony (multiple pregnancy, grand multiparity, polyhydramnios, prolonged

labour)
Antepartum haemorrhage
Uterine sepsis (chorioamnionitis)
Retained placenta
Lower genital tract trauma (perineal or cervical tears)
Coagulopathy (heparin treatment, inherited bleeding disorders)
Previous PPH

This woman’s major risk factor is multiple pregnancy and with the high uterus, the cause
is likely to be uterine atony (inability of the uterus to contract adequately). Blood loss is
often underestimated, the ‘high’ uterus may contain a large volume of concealed blood,
and the blood pressure in young fit women remains relatively normal until decompensation occurs. Therefore this woman is in fact extremely sick and at risk of cardiac arrest if
immediate management is not employed.
The sequence of management strategies is:
• rub up a contraction by placing the dominant hand over the uterus and rubbing and
squeezing firmly until the uterus becomes firm
• ensure two large-bore cannulae are inserted with cross-matched blood requested
• recheck full blood count and coagulation
• commence intravenous fluids for volume expansion
• give 500 μg ergometrine intramuscularly or intravenously to enhance uterine contraction
• start a syntocinon infusion to maintain uterine contraction
• consider other uterotonics such as misoprostol or carboprost
• transfer to theatre for examination under anaesthetic to assess for vaginal trauma, cervical laceration or retained placental tissue
• the doctor or midwife should continue bimanual compression until the clinical situation is under control
• if the bleeding does not settle with the above measures then further options are uterine
artery embolization or laparotomy with B-Lynch haemostatic suture, uterine artery ligation or hysterectomy.
KEY POINTS

• Uterine compression from the abdomen or bimanually is the first and immediate
•

224

management strategy for postpartum haemorrhage and should be continued until the
clinical situation has settled.
Clinicians usually underestimate blood loss and in assessing haemodynamic status may
forget to take account of concealed loss (into the uterus) and the ability of healthy
women to compensate.

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 89: LABOUR
History
A 32-year-old woman presents to the labour ward with abdominal pain. This is her
first baby after two miscarriages. She was trying to conceive for 18 months prior to this
pregnancy.
Her estimated delivery date was corrected after her 11–14-week scan to make her now
40 weeks and 6 days. All pregnancy blood tests and ultrasound scans have been normal.
The baby was breech at 34 weeks but cephalic at 37 weeks.
This morning she had a mucus-like dark-red discharge followed by the onset of irregular
period-type pains. Two hours ago she felt a gush of clear fluid from the vagina and since
then pains have become much more severe now occurring every 4 min, lasting for 45 s.
The baby has moved normally during the day.
She had a bath at home and took paracetamol but is now distressed and has come to
hospital for assessment. Her partner and sister who are both very anxious accompany her.

Examination
On examination she is comfortable between pains. Her blood pressure is 129/76 mmHg
and pulse 101/min. Symphysiofundal height is 37 cm and the fetus is cephalic with 2/5
palpable.
Speculum examination shows clear fluid pooled in the posterior vaginal fornix.
Vaginal examination reveals the cervix to be fully effaced and 4 cm dilated. The position
is right occipitoposterior and the head is 2 cm above the ischial spines. There is no fetal
caput or moulding.

225

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 89
This woman is in normal labour.

!

Definition of labour
The onset of regular painful contractions with progressive dilatation of the cervix and
descent of the presenting part.

Spontaneous rupture of membranes has occurred but is not necessary for the diagnosis of
labour.
The woman’s observations and examination findings are normal for labour:
• the dark mucus discharge is a ‘show’ and is not a cause for concern unless the
bleeding is fresh or ongoing
• the pulse is almost certainly raised secondarily to the pain
• the haematuria and proteinuria are secondary to contamination by the show and liquor
• the symphysiofundal height is low because the head has descended into the pelvis and
because the liquor has been released from the uterus.

Management
The pregnancy and labour are low risk in that there is no evidence of any fetal or maternal disorder that requires doctor-led care. The woman should therefore remain under
midwife-led care and does not need continuous electronic fetal monitoring (cardiotocograph, CTG). The fetus does need assessment for wellbeing with intermittent auscultation
for a full minute after a contraction at least every 15 min in the first stage of labour and
for a full minute after a contraction every 5 min in the second stage of labour.

!

Monitoring in low-risk labour

•
•
•
•

Hourly blood pressure
Hourly heart rate
Four-hourly examinations for cervical dilatation
Assessment for meconium

Once labour is established, expected dilatation is approximately 1 cm/h. If this does not
occur or if signs suggest that fetal or maternal wellbeing might be compromised, then
medical assessment and possible intervention may be indicated.
KEY POINTS

• Normal labour is the onset of regular painful contractions with progressive dilatation of
the cervix and descent of the presenting part.

• Continuous CTG is not required for low-risk women in normal labour, but intermittent
auscultation is essential.

CASE 90: PAIN IN PREGNANCY
History
A 35-year-old woman arrives on the labour ward complaining of abdominal pain and
vaginal bleeding at 36 weeks 2 days’ gestation. The pain started 2 h earlier while she was
in a café. She describes constant pain all over her abdomen with exacerbations every few
minutes. It is not relieved by lying still or by walking around. The vaginal bleeding is
bright red and was initially noticed on the toilet paper and now has stained her underclothes and trousers. There are no urinary or bowel symptoms.
The baby has been moving normally until today, but the woman has not paid any attention
to the movements since the pain started.
This is her first pregnancy and until now progress has been uneventful with shared care
between the general practitioner and midwife. Both the 11–14-week and the anomaly scan
at 20 weeks were reassuring. Booking and subsequent blood tests were normal. The booking blood pressure was 112/68 mmHg and the most recent blood pressure 2 days ago was
128/80 mmHg.

Examination
She is obviously in significant pain and feels clammy. She is apyrexial, her heart rate is
115/min and blood pressure 110/62 mmHg. The symphysiofundal height is 38 cm and the
uterus feels hard and is very tender. It is not possible to feel the presentation of the fetus
due to the uterine tightening. On speculum examination there is a trickle of blood through
the cervix and the cervix appears closed. Vaginal examination reveals that the cervix is
soft and almost full effaced but closed. No fetal heart sounds are heard on auscultation
with the hand-held fetal Doppler. Ultrasound scan confirms that the fetus has died.

227

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 90
The pain and bleeding are due to placental abruption. In this case the presence of vaginal
blood classifies it as a ‘revealed abruption’ but the other signs of hardened ‘couvelaire’ uterus,
raised symphysiofundal height, tachycardia and low haemoglobin all suggest that the major
part of the blood is still concealed. This is an extremely important point as the amount of
visualized blood can be misleading when there may be 1–2 L of blood within the uterus.
The blood pressure appears normal, but this is because the woman is relatively young and
fit – she is able to compensate by increasing heart rate and cardiac output for some time.
By the time her blood pressure falls she has decompensated and is critically unwell, so
normal blood pressure in young people should always be interpreted carefully. If her blood
pressure were checked lying and standing, there would be a significant difference, which
would reveal the extent of her hypovolaemia.
The increase in INR, decreased platelets and positive D-dimer test (a reflection of raised
fibrin-degradation products) confirm that the woman has developed disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy (DIC) as a result of the abruption.
The fetus has died (intrauterine fetal death) because the placenta has separated from the
uterus and the uteroplacental circulation has therefore been interrupted.

Management
This is an obstetric emergency as the woman is hypovolaemic and has developed a coagulopathy. The management centres on correction of the clotting and volume replacement
as well as delivery of the baby. The anaesthetist and senior obstetrician should liaise
closely in management.

!

Resuscitation of the mother (initial basic procedures)

•
•
•
•
•

Insertion of two large-bore venous cannulae
Crossmatch of 6 units of blood
Request for fresh-frozen plasma and platelets
Initial fluid resuscitation with intravenous fluids, probably volume expanders
Insertion of a urinary catheter to monitor urine output

As the baby has died there is no indication for Caesarean section, which would put her at
risk of further bleeding. Therefore vaginal induction of labour should be initiated. Labour
is often rapid after an abruption, and as the cervix is fully effaced and soft it may be sufficient to perform artificial rupture of membranes (ARM) to initiate the process of delivery. At ARM, a large amount of blood is likely to be apparent.
A syntocinon infusion should be commenced immediately after delivery as uterine atony
and postpartum haemorrhage are common after significant abruption.
KEY POINTS

• Placental abruption is an obstetric emergency and must be aggressively managed as DIC
can develop rapidly.

• Placental abruption is commonly associated with the development of pre-eclampsia.
• Labour is usually rapid after abruption, and vaginal delivery poses less risk to the mother
than Caesarean section.

• Caesarean section should be reserved for delivering a live but potentially compromised baby.
228

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 91: PERINEAL TEAR
History
A woman has just delivered her second baby on the labour ward. She is 37 years old and
had a previous premature delivery at 34 weeks. In this pregnancy she went into spontaneous labour at 38 weeks after an uncomplicated pregnancy.
The symphysiofundal height was consistent with dates until 37 weeks when the midwife
measured it as 41 cm. However, before an ultrasound scan for growth and liquor volume
could be arranged the woman went into spontaneous labour.
At the time of admission she was 5 cm dilated and spontaneous rupture of membranes
occurred soon after. The baby was delivered 30 min later in the direct occipitoanterior
position.
The placenta was delivered by controlled cord traction, after which the midwife noticed a
perineal tear. The tear extended from the introitus in the midline and she could see torn
muscle fibres suggestive of the torn ends of the external anal sphincter. She has called you
to review the patient.

Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis?
• What factors predispose to this condition?
• How would you manage this patient?

229

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 91
The history suggests a third-degree tear.

!

Classification of perineal tears

• First degree: injury to the perineum involving the epithelium or skin but not the
perineal muscles

• Second degree: injury to the perineum involving perineal muscles but not involving
the anal sphincter

• Third degree: injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (external
anal sphincter (EAS) and internal anal sphincter (IAS)):
• 3a: less than 50 per cent of EAS thickness torn
• 3b: more than 50 per cent of EAS thickness torn
• 3c: IAS torn
• Fourth degree: injury to the perineum involving the anal sphincter complex (EAS
and IAS) and rectal mucosa

Risk factors
Third-degree tears occur in 2–4 per cent of women with the following conditions:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

birthweight over 4 kg
persistent occipitoposterior position
nulliparity
induction of labour
epidural
second stage of labour lasting more than 1 h
episiotomy
forceps delivery.

Third-degree tear diagnosis depends on the vigilance of the person inspecting a tear and
may easily be missed. This has far-reaching consequences, as failure to perform adequate
primary repair may increase the chance of longer-term faecal incontinence.

Management
• The woman should be transferred to theatre for repair. This enables adequate analgesia
(spinal or epidural), good exposure, good lighting and availability of appropriate
instruments.
• The tear should be repaired in layers:
• rectal mucosa (if involved)
• internal anal sphincter (if involved)
• external anal sphincter
• perineal muscle
• vaginal epithelium
• perineal skin.
• Broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered to prevent infection from possible
contamination by bowel organisms.
• Laxatives should be administered to prevent constipation that might compromise the
repair.
• Adequate postoperative analgesia is needed.
• The woman should not generally be discharged until she has opened her bowels.
230

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

• A follow-up appointment should be made after approximately 6 weeks to ensure that
the woman has no significant bowel symptoms and to refer on to a colorectal specialist
if she has.
• Elective Caesarean section should be discussed as a possibility for any subsequent
deliveries.

KEY POINTS

• Following delivery any vaginal tear must be inspected carefully to ensure that the anal
sphincter is not disrupted.

• Any third-degree tears should be repaired in theatre by an experienced operator to avoid
future problems with faecal incontinence.

CASE 92: FIT IN PREGNANCY
History
An obviously pregnant woman is brought to the emergency department having suffered a
seizure in the park 20 min ago. She had been alone at the time but the seizure was witnessed by another woman who said that she had stood up from a bench and then suddenly
dropped to the ground. She thought she may have hit her head on the side of the bench
with the fall. Her arms and legs had been shaking and then were ‘stiff and trembling’ for
about 40 s. The woman’s face had gone dusky and there was some frothing at the mouth.
She noticed that the woman’s trousers were wet afterwards.
When the fit stopped the woman had appeared unconscious for a few minutes and then
showed some response to being talked to but seemed confused and drowsy.

Examination
She appears to be about 30 years old and in the third trimester of pregnancy. She is now
conscious but still drowsy and her Glasgow Coma Scale is 9/15.
Her blood pressure is 140/98 mmHg and heart rate 104/min. Examination shows no obvious cardiac or chest abnormality, and on abdominal palpation there is no apparent tenderness. The uterus feels approximately 30-week size (midway between umbilicus and
xiphisternum), and a fetus can be palpated, cephalic with 4/5 palpable. Reflexes are brisk
and plantar reflexes are upgoing.

INVESTIGATIONS
No investigation results are yet available for this patient when you see her.

Questions
• What is your provisional diagnosis and how would you manage this woman in the first
instance?
• The woman’s husband arrives shortly and explains that she is a known epileptic who
has grand mal seizures every few days, despite drug treatment. How should your management alter now?

233

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 92
Any woman with a fit in the second half of pregnancy should be assumed to have eclampsia until proven otherwise. The risks of maternal or perinatal mortality are so great that it
is better to treat the woman for eclampsia and prevent a further seizure than to spend time
investigating and making a certain diagnosis while risking further fits. This case is therefore an obstetric emergency (despite the fact that the fit resolved spontaneously), and help
should be summoned from the anaesthetist, senior midwife, senior obstetrician and
paediatrician.
Magnesium sulphate should be given as an intravenous bolus of 4 g, followed by an infusion in normal saline of 1 g/h (increased if further fits occur).
Once this has been commenced, a urine sample should be acquired (with insertion of a
Foley catheter to monitor urine output) for proteinuria. Fluid input should be restricted
initially to 85 mL/h. Blood should be sent for full blood count, urea and electrolytes, urate,
liver function tests, coagulation screen and group and save. She should be transferred to
a high-dependency area of the labour ward with continuous electrocardiogram and cardiotocograph monitoring.
Once stable and further investigations have been made into her previous history, a decision can be made regarding delivery.

Epilepsy diagnosis
The fact that the woman has epilepsy strongly suggests that this fit is caused by the
epilepsy. However, the initial management was still correct as you will not be sure that the
fit was due to this until the urinalysis has been confirmed to be normal and the blood
pressure, initially high, has normalized, the reflexes returned to normal and the blood tests
results are found to be normal.
Reflexes are commonly brisk, with upgoing plantar responses in the post-ictal phase.
This woman regained full consciousness after half an hour and the blood pressure was
normal with negative urinalysis and normal blood results. The magnesium was thus discontinued and she was discharged with her husband, for neurological review within the
next few days to discuss compliance and drug regime.

KEY POINTS

• A woman who presents in the third trimester of pregnancy with a grand mal seizure
should be treated as eclamptic until proven otherwise.

CASE 93: BREATHLESSNESS IN PREGNANCY
History
A 42-year-old woman is referred by her general practitioner with breathlessness for the past
3 days. She is 34 weeks pregnant in her third pregnancy. Prior to this she has had an emergency Caesarean section for abnormal cardiotocograph in labour, followed by a 7-week
miscarriage.
In this pregnancy she was seen by the obstetric consultant to discuss plans for delivery,
and is hoping for a vaginal delivery. Ultrasound scans and blood tests have been normal.
Her booking blood pressure was 138/80 mmHg and has remained stable during the
pregnancy.
She describes her shortness of breath starting while she was at work and slightly worsening since. She felt particularly breathless when she ran to catch a bus on her way home
yesterday. She has some left-sided chest pain on breathing in. There is no cough or
haemoptysis. She has had no previous episodes. She has not noticed any calf pain but has
left leg swelling and some back pain.

Examination
The body mass index is 28 kg/m2. The woman does not look obviously unwell. Blood pressure is 127/78 mmHg and heart rate 98/min. Oxygen saturation is 96 per cent on air. On
examination of the chest there is a systolic murmur and no added sounds. Chest expansion is normal but the woman reports pain on taking a deep breath. The chest is resonant
to percussion and chest sounds are normal except for a pleural rub on the left. The left leg
is generally swollen but no redness or tenderness is apparent.

Questions

• What further imaging is required?
• How would you manage this woman in the immediate term, during delivery and
postnatally?

237

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 93
The diagnosis is of pulmonary embolism (PE). The shortness and breath and pleuritic chest
pain are classic features, and the ECG and blood gas analysis support the diagnosis.
D-dimer is commonly raised in pregnancy but also supports the diagnosis. The CTPA
demonstrates a large filling defect within the right pulmonary artery and a smaller filling
defect in the left segmental pulmonary artery, consistent with blood clots (pulmonary
embolism). These findings are illustrated by the arrows in Fig. 93.2.

Figure 93.2 CT pulmonary angiogram
demonstrating a large filling defect in
the right main pulmonary artery (large
arrow) and smaller defect in a
segmental branch of the left
pulmonary artery (smaller arrow).

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the leading cause of direct deaths in the Confidential
Enquiry into Maternal and Child Health, accounting for death in 1.2 per 100 000 maternities. Non-fatal VTE occurs in approximately 60 in 10 000 pregnancies, and there may be
many more unrecognized cases. Pregnancy itself is a risk factor because of the hyperoestrogenic state, the altered blood viscosity and obstruction to venous blood flow by the
gravid uterus.

Further imaging
There is no clinical evidence of calf ileofemoral deep vein thrombosis, but generalized leg
swelling and back pain are suspicious of an ileofemoral thrombosis. If this is confirmed,
which may require Doppler ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging (or if she develops
recurrent PE despite anticoagulation), then liaison with a vascular team should be considered regarding the possibility of insertion of a vena caval filter.
Management
As with non-pregnant patients, anticoagulation is the mainstay of treatment. Warfarin is
contraindicated in the first trimester of pregnancy but may safely be given from 12 to 36
weeks. However it can cause difficulties with excessive bleeding if it is not stopped early
enough before delivery and it can be difficult to achieve stable international normalized
ratio levels. Therefore low-molecular-weight heparin has become the treatment of choice
in pregnancy as it is simple to administer, relatively easy to reverse in the emergency situation, does not require monitoring, and is safe.
At delivery the heparin should ideally be discontinued 12 h before delivery and recommenced immediately following delivery. Similarly an epidural or spinal anaesthetic should
not be administered immediately after a heparin dose.
238

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

Postnatally some women change to warfarin, which is now known to be safe with breastfeeding, while others continue low-molecular-weight heparin.
A large proportion of VTE occurs postnatally, so anticoagulation should be continued for
6 weeks to 3 months in the puerperium.
Graduated elastic compression stocking should be worn from the time of diagnosis until
at least 6 weeks following delivery, to reduce the risk of the post-thrombotic syndrome
(chronic leg pain, swelling and ulceration).
Postnatal investigation for inherited (e.g. protein C or S deficiency) or acquired (e.g. antiphospholipid syndrome) thrombophilia is appropriate, as is anticoagulation throughout
any subsequent pregnancy.

KEY POINTS

• Thromboembolic disease is common in pregnancy and one should have a high index of
suspicion in making the diagnosis clinically.

• Anticoagulation should be given while waiting for confirmation of the diagnosis.

CASE 94: BLOOD PRESSURE AND PREGNANCY
History
A woman was admitted from the antenatal clinic two days ago at 38 weeks’ gestation. She
is 42 years old and this is her second pregnancy. Her first child was born by spontaneous
vaginal delivery 13 years ago. She has subsequently remarried. Her booking blood pressure
was 138/70 mmHg at 13 weeks. Her booking blood tests were unremarkable. At her 36 week
midwife appointment 2 weeks ago, her blood pressure was 140/85 mmHg and the urinalysis was normal. The blood pressure was repeated 2 days later and was 140/82 mmHg.
Two days ago she saw her midwife for a further appointment and her blood pressure was
148/101 mmHg. Urinalysis showed protein ⫹.
She feels well in herself except for swollen legs. She denies any headache or blurring of
vision.

Examination
She has oedema to the mid calves and her fingers are swollen such that she cannot remove
her rings. Abdominal palpation is non-tender and the symphysiofundal height is 39 cm.
Reflexes are normal.

Questions
• How would you interpret the investigations?
• What further investigations are needed and how should she be managed?

241

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 94
Results interpretation
The haemoglobin and packed cell volume suggest mild haemoconcentration. The platelet
count is normal for pregnancy, though low for a non-pregnant person. Electrolytes are
within the normal range but the creatinine is higher than normal for pregnancy. Alkaline
phosphatase is always raised in pregnancy due to its production by the placenta. However
the alanine transaminase is abnormal.
A normal urate value correlates with gestational age (the urate level should not be more
than the number of weeks gestation) and therefore the level of 43 mmol/L is high. Finally,
the 24-h urinary protein measurement, performed to quantify the degree of proteinuria,
has shown a significantly raised result.
This woman thus has pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) with proteinuria, abnormal
liver function and raised serum creatinine and urate. This is known as pre-eclampsia. The
condition commonly occurs in asymptomatic women and the severity of symptoms often
does not correlate with the disease severity.
No further maternal investigations are needed but fetal wellbeing needs to be assessed by
cardiotocograph and ultrasound assessment for fetal growth and liquor volume in view of
the association between pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction.
Induction of labour as soon as possible is indicated, as the fetus is beyond 37 weeks and
delay might increase the likelihood of fulminating pre-eclampsia in the mother or fetal
compromise, including placental abruption. There is no indication for Caesarean section
unless induction is unsuccessful or fetal compromise occurs before or during labour. Close
monitoring of blood pressure is imperative during and after labour, as many eclamptic fits
occur postnatally.
In this case the woman agreed to induction of labour and started contracting after the first
dose of intravaginal prostaglandin gel. The labour progressed rapidly with subsequent
normal delivery. However the blood pressure increased in labour to 155/110 mmHg. An
epidural was sited to help reduce the blood pressure. Blood pressure increased further and
a hydralazine infusion was required.
She remained in hospital for 5 days postpartum for blood pressure monitoring, during
which time her blood results returned to normal. Postnatally she was converted to oral
labetalol for 6 weeks, after which blood pressure was normal, and treatment discontinued.

KEY POINTS

• Pre-eclampsia is common and is associated with significant maternal morbidity and
mortality.

• Proteinuria should be quantified with analysis of a 24-h urine collection.

242

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 95: LABOUR
History
A 22-year-old woman is admitted to the labour ward for induction of labour at 39 weeks’
gestation. This is her first ongoing pregnancy, having had a first-trimester miscarriage
13 months previously. She booked at 9 weeks and had normal booking blood tests,
and 11–14-week scan and 21-week anomaly scan did not show any obvious fetal abnormality. Blood pressure and urinalysis have always been normal.
At her 32 week midwife appointment she reported feeling very uncomfortable abdominally, and the midwife measured the symphysiofundal height to be 36 cm. A further ultrasound scan was therefore requested whish showed normal fetal growth but increased
liquor volume. She had been reviewed in the antenatal clinic and was tested for gestational diabetes with glucose tolerance test but this was normal. Subsequent examinations
had again confirmed an increased symphysiofundal height, and further ultrasound scan at
36 weeks again showed normal growth, no fetal abnormality and markedly increased
liquor volume. The fetal movements had always been normal.
A decision had been made for induction of labour at 40 weeks because the woman had
become so uncomfortable and breathless.
On palpation the fetus was cephalic with the head 4/5 palpable abdominally. Cardiotocograph (CTG) was reassuring; 2 mg of prostaglandin gel had been inserted into the
posterior fornix of the vagina and CTG monitoring continued for a further 20 min.
The woman then mobilized and contractions started within an hour. She requested an
epidural for analgesia and while this was being prepared CTG monitoring was commenced. At this stage, spontaneous rupture of membranes occurred with a very large volume of clear liquor soaking the bed sheets.

Questions
• Describe the CTG

• How would you confirm the diagnosis and manage this situation?
243

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 95
The CTG shows deep variable decelerations. The sudden CTG deterioration after rupture of
membranes in a woman with polyhydramnios suggests the likelihood of prolapse of the
cord. Other possible diagnoses are placental abruption or fetal head compression from
precipitate labour. The diagnosis is easily confirmed with vaginal examination. A loop of
umbilical cord will be palpated in the vagina and will be pulsatile.

Polyhydramnios
Preterm delivery
Malpresentation
Unstable presentation
Multiple pregnancy

This is an obstetric emergency and the emergency bell should be activated with the
senior midwife, theatre team, senior obstetrician, paediatrician and anaesthetist summoned immediately.
The important management steps are:
• the examiner should not remove their fingers from the vagina and should attempt to
elevate the fetal head above the cord and minimize contact with the cord to prevent
spasm
• the woman should be rotated into the ‘all-fours position’ (head lower than buttocks),
which will facilitate relieving the weight of the baby and abdomen from the
prolapsed cord
• she should be transferred to theatre immediately for Caesarean section
• intravenous access should be obtained, and a general anaesthetic administered, using
a rapid sequence induction with cricoid pressure
• the examiner should only remove their fingers from the presenting part in the vagina
when the uterus has been opened and the baby is being delivered.

KEY POINTS

• Cord prolapse should be suspected in cases of fetal heart abnormality occurring after
rupture of membranes.

• It is an obstetric emergency and necessitates immediate Caesarean section.
• Attempts should be made to minimize pressure on the cord pending delivery.

Peripartum care and obstetric emergencies

CASE 96: NEONATAL CARE
History
A 19-year-old woman is in spontaneous labour at 37 weeks 2 days’ gestation. At 4 cm cervical dilatation there is thick meconium liquor and a fetal heart deceleration to 70/min is
heard lasting for 2 min. The woman is immediately placed on the continuous cardiotogograph (CTG), which confirms regular deep late decelerations.
A decision is made to deliver the baby by immediate Caesarean section under general
anaesthetic. The baby is delivered within 20 min.

INVESTIGATIONS
Apgar score at 1 min:
Heart rate: ⬍100/min: 1
Respiratory effort: absent: 0
Muscle tone: some flexion: 1
Reflex grimace: 1
Colour pale/blue: 0
Total Apgar score: 3
Umbilical cord blood samples:
Arterial blood gas: pH 7.01; base excess –12.8 mmol/L
Venous blood gas: pH 7.12; base excess –11.5 mmol/L

Questions
• How do you interpret the Apgar and cord blood results?
• What action would you take in these circumstances?

245

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 96
The Apgar score is a simple scoring system to record the initial assessment of neonates in
the first few minutes after delivery. For each variable a score of 0, 1 or 2 may be allocated
(see Table 96.1).
Table 96.1 Apgar scores

In this case the baby is clearly showing no respiratory effort and is bradycardic at birth.
The arterial cord blood shows an acidosis.

Management
Most babies, even with low Apgar scores respond to initial resuscitation measures:
•
•
•
•

immediately dry the baby with warm towels, replacing any wet towels with dry ones
warm by wrapping in a warm dry towel and placing under the heated rescuscitaire
stimulate by rubbing (during drying)
if no immediate respiratory effort is made then proceed to 5 inflationary breaths with
oxygen via a self-limiting pressure bag and appropriately sized face mask (most babies
will respond and immediately increase their heart rate and begin to make some respiratory effort)
• recheck the respiration and heart rate. If they have not recovered, clear the airway with
gentle suction (this baby has been exposed to thick meconium which may have been
inhaled and be causing a mechanical obstruction)
• if the heart rate is above 60/min, continue ventilation with bag and mask until heart
rate increases to above 100/min
• if the heart rate is below 60/min begin chest compressions, continue bag and mask ventilation and check that the neonatal resuscitation team has been called.
This baby recovered its heart rate and respiratory effort with the first three measures but
continued to display ‘grunting’ respiratory effort, and 3 h later deteriorated and needed
ventilation. A diagnosis of meconium aspiration and pneumonitis was made and antibiotics and supportive measures were initiated with final extubation after 7 days and discharge home 5 days later.
KEY POINTS

• All health professionals delivering babies must be able to perform basic neonatal
resuscitation.

• The majority of babies with low Apgar score at delivery respond to initial drying and
warming.

CASE 97: UNPROTECTED INTERCOURSE
History
A 21-year-old woman presents because she has had unprotected intercourse and is
worried about pregnancy. She has been on holiday and met a man with whom she had
unprotected intercourse 36 h ago, and also 4 days before that.
Her last menstrual period started 13 days ago and she bleeds for 4 days every 27 days. She
has had no other episodes of intercourse since her last period. She is generally healthy but
has a history of epilepsy for which she takes carbamazepine. She has no other significant
medical history.

INVESTIGATIONS
Urinary pregnancy test: negative

Questions
• What options are available to this woman and how should she be managed?

247

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 97
Two forms of emergency contraception are generally available:
• emergency intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD)
• hormonal emergency contraception (levonorgestrel).
Hormonal emergency contraception involves 1.5 mg levonorgestrel, taken as soon as possible after intercourse (preferably within 12 h). It is effective up to 72 h and can be given
safely up to 5 days (unlicensed), but the earlier it is taken, the more effective it is. In this
case the woman has had intercourse more than 72 h ago and therefore this method should
be assumed to be ineffective. She is also taking an enzyme-inducing drug and should
therefore be advised, if she were suitable to use this method, to take a higher dose of
levonorgestrel (3 mg).

!

Advice after emergency hormonal contraception

• Nausea is a common side-effect and women can be given prophylactic
•
•
•

domperidone. If vomiting occurs, domperidone and a second levonorgestrel dose
should be given as soon as possible.
A barrier method of contraception needs to be used until the next period.
The next period may be early or late, but if it is very late or very unusual she should
take a pregnancy test.
She needs to return promptly if lower abdominal pain occurs, to rule out an
ectopic pregnancy.

Emergency intrauterine contraceptive device
This woman should be advised to have an emergency IUCD inserted, and although she has
never been pregnant this is unlikely to be a problem as IUCDs can generally be inserted
under local anaesthetic, even in nulliparous women.
It can be inserted up to 120 h (5 days) after unprotected intercourse. If intercourse has
occurred more than 5 days previously, the intrauterine device can still be inserted up to
5 days after the earliest likely calculated ovulation. In this case the earliest likely ovulation is today (taking account of her 27-day cycle).
The IUCD is also more effective than the hormonal emergency contraception whenever
used. Insertion needs to be covered by antibacterial prophylaxis to prevent pelvic inflammatory disease.
A pregnancy test should always be taken before any emergency contraception, whatever
the menstrual history. Women should also be advised to consider sexually transmitted
infection testing after unprotected intercourse with a new partner, and should be encouraged to use a reliable regular method of contraception.
KEY POINTS

• The emergency IUCD is more effective than emergency hormonal contraception and
can be used up to 5 days after the earliest calculated ovulation date, even if this is more
than 5 days after unprotected intercourse.

CASE 98: VAGINAL DISCHARGE
History
A 19-year-old woman presents with a vaginal discharge. She is currently 9 weeks pregnant in her first pregnancy. The discharge started about 3 weeks ago and is non-itchy and
creamy in colour. It is not profuse but she feels it has a strong odour and is embarrassed
about it. There is no bleeding or abdominal pain. She has had two or three previous similar episodes before the pregnancy that resolved spontaneously.
She has been with her partner for 3 years and neither of them have had any other sexual
partners. They have always used condoms until 3 months ago. She has never had a cervical smear test.

Examination
The external genitalia appear normal. On speculum examination a small amount of
smooth grey discharge is seen coating the vagina walls. There is a small cervical ectropion
that is not bleeding.
Questions
• What is the likely diagnosis and the differential diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this patient?
• If your diagnosis is confirmed, what are the implications for the pregnancy?

249

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 98
The history suggests that the woman is not at risk of a sexually transmitted infection as a
cause for her discharge (although this can never be ruled out entirely as the reported sexual history can be inaccurate). She has an ectropion, which can cause a clear discharge.
A non-offensive, non-itchy discharge is normal in pregnancy.
The salient feature in this case is that the discharge has an offensive odour. Offensive
odour is usually due to either trichomonas or bacterial vaginosis (BV). Trichomonas
causes a profuse, sometimes frothy discharge with cervicitis, whereas BV causes a smooth,
mild discharge, if any discharge at all.

!

Differential diagnosis of vaginal discharge

• Infective
• sexually transmitted

•
•

– trichomonas
– chlamydia
– gonorrhoea
• non-sexually transmitted
– candida
– bacterial vaginosis
Physiological
• pregnancy
• ovulation
Cervical ectropion

Further investigation
The woman should have swabs taken for sexually transmitted infection as well as BV and
candida.
A diagnosis of BV can be made, finding a typical thin grey discharge with a fishy odour
and a vaginal pH of 6–7. More formal criteria for diagnosis are the Amsel (discharge, clue
cells on microscopy, high pH and fishy odour with potassium hydroxide) or Hay/Ison criteria (relative lactobacilli to anaerobe proportions on Gram-stained vaginal smear).
Microbiological culture is not helpful as many of the anaerobes associated with BV are
also found as commensals.

Management
Spontaneous onset and remission is typical with BV, and 50 per cent of women are
asymptomatic. General advice should be given for avoiding BV including avoidance of
vaginal douching, shower gel, and antiseptic agents or shampoo in the bath, as these
interfere with the normal flora (lactobacilli) and allow an increase in BV organisms.
Specific treatment is with metronidazole for 5–7 days.

BV and pregnancy
Late miscarriage, preterm birth, preterm premature rupture of membranes, and postpartum
endometritis have all been associated with BV, and so any pregnant woman with BV
should be treated with metronidazole. In contrast, non-pregnant women only require
treatment if symptomatic.
250

Family planning and sexual health
KEY POINTS

• BV is a common cause of discharge and is the most likely diagnosis in a woman
•

complaining of an offensive or ‘fishy’ odour, but a full sexually transmitted infection
screen is usually indicated to rule out other co-existing infection.
Treatment with metronidazole is indicated in all affected pregnant women, but in nonpregnant women it is only indicated for those with symptoms.

CASE 99: TEENAGE CONTRACEPTION
History
A 14-year-old girl attends a family planning clinic wanting to start ‘the pill’. She has been
with her boyfriend for 8 months. They both agreed that they wanted to start a sexual relationship and have already had intercourse on two occasions where they did not use contraception. She had never been sexually active before. Her periods started 3 years ago and
were initially irregular but she now reports a regular 27-day cycle. She has never had any
gynaecological or other medical problems.
She reports that she is happy at school and she is one of three children, with a brother of
21 and sister of 19 years. She lives with her parents in a house locally. She has attended
the clinic with a female school friend.

Examination
There are no examination or investigations findings.
Questions
• What issues are important in determining how this situation should be managed?
• How would you further investigate, advise and manage this girl?

253

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 99
Prescribing of contraception to girls under the legal age of consent (16 years) is guided by
the Fraser Rules, which arose from the case of Gillick seeking to stop a doctor from providing contraceptive advice to her daughter without consulting the parents.
The law allows contraception to be provided as long as the following criteria are met:
• the girl should be encouraged to discuss her sexual activity with a parent or another
responsible adult
• she should consent to intercourse
• she should understand the implications of having sexual intercourse and the
contraceptive method chosen
• it is anticipated that she will have sex whether or not contraception is provided and is
therefore at potentially higher physical and psychological harm from an inadvertent
pregnancy.
In this case it is clear that the girl will continue to have sex with or without contraception
as she has already done so, and therefore it is in her best interests to prevent pregnancy.
She should be encouraged to discuss the issue with a parent, or failing this perhaps her
older sister or brother.
The age of her boyfriend should be explored – if he is of a similar age then consent is
probably valid. However if there is a significant age discrepancy, for example he was over
20 years, then issues of child protection should be considered and the case should be discussed in the first instance with a social worker.

Investigation and advice
A urinary pregnancy test should be performed prior to any hormonal contraception, as
she has already had unprotected intercourse.
She should be advised about the different methods of contraception, particularly how to
use them and the importance of compliance. The availability of emergency contraception
should be explained.
She is at risk of sexually transmitted infections, and barrier contraception should be
advised even if she is using the contraceptive pill as her main pregnancy-prevention strategy.
Whichever option is chosen, the girl should be supported such that she is happy to come
back for further review and to check correct usage of the preferred method. Explanation
of confidentiality rules will also aid her confidence in your advice.

KEY POINTS

• Contraception may be provided to girls under the age of 16 years without parental
consent subject to the guidance in the Fraser rules.

• Sexually transmitted infections and education about emergency contraception are an
integral part of such consultations.

CASE 100: INTERMENSTRUAL BLEEDING
History
A 21-year-old student presents with vaginal bleeding between her periods. It first
occurred 2 months ago and she has had several recurrences. It is usually light and generally lasts from 1 to 3 days.
She has been on the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP) for 18 months and has regular periods, lasting for 3 days every 28 days. The periods are not heavy or painful. She has
not noticed any other discharge. She has not had any bowel or urinary symptoms.
She first had sexual intercourse at the age of 17 years and has been with her current
boyfriend for 4 months. There is no pain on intercourse and no postcoital bleeding.
She was seen once before in the gynaecology clinic for pelvic pain and was noted to have
a simple ovarian cyst, which subsequently resolved spontaneously. She has no other significant medical history of note. The general practitioner had arranged an ultrasound
assessment prior to referral.

Examination
She is slim and looks well. The abdomen is not distended and is non-tender. The external
genitalia are normal and on speculum examination a slight blood-stained discharge is
noted coming from the cervical os. There is a cervical ectropion which is not bleeding.
Bimanual examination reveals an aneteverted normal size mobile uterus. There is no
cervical excitation or adnexal tenderness.

INVESTIGATIONS
Transvaginal ultrasound examination:
The uterus is normal size and anteverted. The endometrium measures 7 mm in
anteroposterior diameter and is regular along its entire length.
Both ovaries appear of normal size and morphology.
There is no free peritoneal fluid.
Urinary pregnancy test: negative.

Questions
• What is the differential diagnosis?
• How would you further investigate and manage this woman?

100 Cases in Obstetrics and Gynaecology

ANSWER 100
The symptom of bleeding between the pill-free interval in a woman taking the combined
oral contraceptive pill is known as breakthrough bleeding. It can have many causes and
a good history should include, in addition to the history given:
• has she been missing any pills?
• has she taken any other medication which might interefere with the COCP (e.g.
antibiotics, enzyme inducers)?
• has she had any intercurrent illnesses causing diarrhoea or vomiting?
• has she ever had any sexually transmitted infections, or been investigated for this?
• how many sexual partners has she had in the last 3 months?
• has she recently changed the COCP that she uses?
The differential diagnosis in a woman with breakthrough bleeding is
• COCP-related causes
• poor compliance
• intercurrent infection causing poor pill absorption
• drug interactions, reducing the COCP efficacy
• inadequate oestrogen component for that woman
• pregnancy
• unrelated causes
• cervical ectropion
• sexually transmitted infection – chlamydia, gonorrhoea, trichomonas
• candidal vaginitis
• cervical or endometrial polyp
• bleeding disorder (rare).
The woman should have the following swabs taken:
• endocervical – for chlamydia
• high vaginal – for trichomonas or candida
• endocervical – for gonorrhoea.
(Bacterial vaginosis is another vaginal infection but does not cause bleeding.)
Chlamydia is an increasingly common infection, especially in women aged 18–24 years.
It is commonly asymptomatic or may present with minimal symptoms as in this case.
It should be tested for with endocervical swab, though urine testing and low vaginal swab
testing are also possible. If confirmed, the woman should be treated with doxyxcline
or azithromycin and advised that her partner(s) should also be tested and treated at a
genitourinary medicine clinic before they resume intercourse.
If the swabs are negative and no other cause can be identified for the breakthrough bleeding,
then the woman should be changed to an alternative contraceptive pill. There is no clear
solution to suit all women, but possibilities are a phasic pill, an alternative progestogen
(such as a ‘third-generation’ progestogen) or a pill containing a higher dose of oestrogen
(50 μg rather than 30 μg).

256

Family planning and sexual health
KEY POINTS

• Breakthrough bleeding with the combined oral contraceptive pill can have many causes.
• Chlamydia infection is often asymptomatic or presents with vague symptoms such as
irregular bleeding.

• Compliance with medication, contact tracing and avoidance of sexual intercourse until
completion of treatment by both partners is essential in the management of chlamydia
infection.

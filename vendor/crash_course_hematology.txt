Series editor foreword
The Crash Course series first published in 1997 and now, 15 years on, we are still
going strong. Medicine never stands still, and the work of keeping this series
relevant for today’s students is an ongoing process. These fourth editions build on
the success of the previous titles and incorporate new and revised material, to keep
the series up-to-date with current guidelines for best practice, and recent
developments in medical research and pharmacology.
We always listen to feedback from our readers, through focus groups and student
reviews of the Crash Course titles. For the fourth editions we have completely
re-written our self-assessment material to keep up with today’s ‘single-best answer’
and ‘extended matching question’ formats. The artwork and layout of the titles has
also been largely re-worked to make it easier on the eye during long sessions of
revision.
Despite fully revising the books with each edition, we hold fast to the principles
on which we first developed the series. Crash Course will always bring you all the
information you need to revise in compact, manageable volumes that integrate
basic medical science and clinical practice. The books still maintain the balance
between clarity and conciseness, and provide sufficient depth for those aiming at
distinction. The authors are medical students and junior doctors who have recent
experience of the exams you are now facing, and the accuracy of the material is
checked by a team of faculty advisors from across the UK.
I wish you all the best for your future careers!

Author
Haematology and immunology are two words that are sure to strike fear into most
medical students. They both have the reputation of being complex, lab-based
specialities that lose their importance once we reach the ‘real world’. In reality,
knowledge of both haematology and immunology are immensely important for the
practice of all specialities, both clinical and lab-based. This includes topics ranging
from anaemia, which is encountered by all clinicians; to non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, which are prescribed by junior doctors throughout
the world.
In Crash Course: Haematology and Immunology we have made every effort to
demonstrate the sound physiological priniciples that underpin the new
developments in both specialities. Thus, providing the reader with the foundations
needed to grasp the treatments that will emerge after the publication of this book.
We have also incorporated clinical scenarios to reinforce the knowledge and
understanding of the basic scientific priniciples. We hope you enjoy haematology
and immunology.

Yousef Gargani

Faculty advisors
Immunology and haematology are two of the most rapidly moving disciplines in
modern medicine. In these two disciplines molecular discoveries are rapidly
translated into diagnostic tests and treatments. In this Crash Course you’ll read
about exciting stuff such as designer drugs for leukaemia and gene therapy for
immunodeficiency.
The flip side of all this progress is that these two subjects are not always taught in an
up-to-date fashion and some of the newer facts get missed out. It’s been a pleasure
to work with Yousef on this edition of the book. His charm, intelligence and energy
will take him a long way.

Principles of haematology

1

Objectives
You should be able to:
• List the different components that make up blood
• Describe where and how blood cells are generated
• Outline the regulatory factors involved in haemopoiesis
• Relate the structure and function of bone marrow and the spleen
• Discuss disorders involving the spleen.

HINTS AND TIPS
Haematology is the branch of medicine dealing with
blood, blood-forming organs and diseases of the blood.

The first part of this book covers haematology and is organized around the various cell types. The production of
blood cells, bone marrow and the function of the spleen
are discussed in this chapter.

OVERVIEW OF HAEMATOLOGY—
THE CELL LINES
All blood cells are derived from a pluripotent stem cell,
through a process known as haemopoiesis. These stem
cells have two important properties: self-renewal accompanied by proliferation, and differentiation into
progenitor cells committed to a specific cell line. Each
of the cells produced has an important role which is
summarized as follows:
Red blood cells
• Erythrocytes: utilize haemoglobin to transport oxygen and carbon dioxide between the lungs and the
rest of the body (see Chapter 2).
White blood cells (for immune functions see Chapter 8;
for cytological appearance, see Chapter 4)
• Neutrophils: phagocytose foreign material or dead/
damaged cells at sites of inflammation, activate bactericidal mechanisms and produce mediators of
chemotaxis.
• Eosinophils: have all the functions of a neutrophil
and are important in the host defence against parasites (coated in antibody). They also regulate immediate hypersensitivity reactions.

• Basophils: represent the source of most histamine in
the human body and can become coated in IgE and
release histamine; they mediate type I hypersensitivity reactions. Mast cells in tissues are similar to basophils in blood.
• Monocytes: enter tissues to become macrophages.
Monocyte-derived cells are found throughout the
body as part of the reticuloendothelial system. They
phagocytose pathogens and cellular debris and
produce various cytokines. They also process and
present antigen to lymphocytes as part of the
adaptive immune response. Highly specialized
mononuclear cells, called dendritic cells, excel in
presenting antigen to T cells.
• B lymphocytes: as plasma cells they are responsible
for immunoglobulin production. They can also
become memory B cells.
• T lymphocytes: cytotoxic CD8 T cells kill cells
infected by intracellular organisms. CD4 T helper
cells produce cytokines to activate B cells or
macrophages
• Natural killer (NK) cells: kill cells they detect as foreign either directly or via antibody-dependent cellmediated cytotoxicity
• Platelets: megakaryocyte fragments involved in
the haemostatic response to vascular injury by
adhering to subendothelial connective tissue (see
Chapter 6).

HINTS AND TIPS
Neutrophils, eosinophils and basophils all have granules
in their cytoplasm giving rise to the collective name,
granulocytes. Clinicians may use the term granulocyte
when only referring to neutrophils, which can cause
confusion.

• Conception to 6 weeks’ gestation: fetal yolk sac
• 6 weeks to 6 months’ gestation: fetal liver and spleen
• 6 months’ gestation onwards into childhood: bone
marrow of nearly all bones
• Adult : axial (central) skeleton and proximal parts of
long bones.

HAEMOPOIESIS AND
ITS REGULATION
Haemopoiesis is the formation and development of
blood cells. The haemopoietic system is composed of
the bone marrow, spleen, liver, lymph nodes and thymus. This process depends upon stem cells, which divide to leave both a reserve population and cells
committed to differentiating into the various blood cell
lines (Fig. 1.1). Differentiation occurs along one of two
lineages:

Progenitor cells
In vitro, haemopoietic progenitors are detected via assays that identify cells capable of producing colonies
(a colony-forming unit, or CFU). Granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes are produced
from a precursor known as CFU-GEMM (also called
multipotent myeloid stem cell). This divides into an erythroid progenitor (BFU-E), a megakaryocyte precursor
(CFU-Meg), an eosinophil precursor (CFU-Eos), a basophil precusor (CFU-Baso) and a granulocyte/monocyte
precursor (CFU-GM). Lymphoid precursors become B
cells or NK cells in the bone marrow or travel to the
thymus where they develop into T cells.

1. Lymphoid ! B and T lymphocytes and NK cells
2. Non-lymphoid (myeloid) ! erythrocytes, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, monocytes and
megakaryocytes.

Regulation of haemopoiesis
Growth factors regulate the balance between haemopoiesis and apoptosis (regulated cell death of old or dysfunctional cells). They also react to external stresses,
including infection or blood loss, to maintain or increase the necessary cell types (Fig. 1.2). Growth factors
are glycoproteins produced in the bone marrow, liver
and kidneys. Binding of the growth factor to surface receptors triggers replication, differentiation or functional
activation. In the absence of stimulation

Growth factors
Growth factors produced using recombinant DNA
techniques can be used clinically. For example, the
growth factor erythropoietin (EPO) is mainly secreted by
peritubular interstitial cells in the kidney, and can be given
to treat anaemia caused by kidney failure. Patients who
have undertaken chemotherapy regimens can benefit
from administration of CSFs, as their treatment can
reduce their neutrophil count to dangerous levels.
Synthetic G-CSF can be used to treat neutropenic sepsis.
There are also two new factors related to thrombopoietin
that can be used to stimulate platelet production:
eltrombopag stimulates the thrombopoietin receptor and
romiplostim is a protein analogue of thrombopoietin.

1

by growth factors, cells undergo apoptosis. Following
stimulation by interleukin-1 (IL-1) or tumour necrosis
factor (TNF), stromal cells in the bone marrow produce
many growth factors. Several growth factors, known as
colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), have been identified.

BONE MARROW
Bone marrow is the major haemopoietic organ in the
adult human, and is divided into red and yellow bone
marrow. The red marrow is where haemopoiesis takes
place and is restricted to the axial skeleton (sternum, vertebrae, ribs, hip bones, clavicles and lower skull) and the
proximal ends of long bones. Although the yellow marrow is essentially a fat store, acting as an energy reserve, in
situations where the rate of haemopoiesis needs to increase dramatically, yellow marrow can convert back to
red. In a similar manner, should the need arise, the liver
and spleen can also resume their fetal haemopoietic role.
This can be seen in severe chronic anaemias.

Structure
The red marrow provides a suitable microenvironment
for stem cell growth and development. It has two main
components:
1. Specialized fibroblasts, known as adventitial reticular cells, which secrete a framework of reticulin fibres (fine collagen fibres), forming a meshwork
that is essential to support developing blood cells
2. A network of blood sinusoids, lined by a single layer
of endothelial cells, which interconnect via tight
junctions. These vascular sinuses support the haemopoietic cells. They drain into a large central sinus
that channels the blood into the systemic venous circulation. The endothelium of the sinusoids exhibits
transient cytoplasmic pores, which allow passage of
newly formed cells into the circulation.
Haemopoiesis takes place in haemopoietic cords or
islands located between the vascular sinuses (Fig. 1.3).
Macrophages found within the haemopoietic cords at
the centre of each focal group contain stored iron in the
form of ferritin and haemosiderin. They have three main
functions:
1. Transfer of iron to developing erythroblasts for haemoglobin synthesis
2. Phagocytosis of the cellular debris of haemopoiesis
3. Contributing to the cellular regulation of haemopoietic cell differentiation and maturation.

Generation of differentiated
lymphocytes
Bone marrow is considered to be a primary lymphoid
organ, i.e. it generates lymphocytes. B-cell development
is dependent on stromal cells in the bone marrow. The

stroma forms specific adhesion contacts with pro-B cells.
As B cells develop, they migrate towards the central axis
of the marrow cavity and become less dependent on
stromal contact. Immature B cells that bind to self cellsurface antigen are removed from the repertoire at this
stage. B cells move to the spleen or lymph nodes for final
maturation. T lymphocyte precursors leave the bone marrow early in development and are transferred to the thymus for maturation. NK cells accumulate in secondary
lymphoid tissue (tonsils, lymph nodes and spleen) prior
to activation.

colic flexure
• Medially: the left kidney
• Posteriorly: the diaphragm, and ribs 9–11.

Structure
The spleen is surrounded by a dense, irregular, fibroelastic connective tissue capsule that projects fibres,
known as trabeculae, into the organ. The two main types
of tissue found within the spleen are red pulp and white
pulp. These are separated by a marginal zone (Fig. 1.4).

Red pulp

THE SPLEEN
The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ. It is the site
of B and T cell proliferation and of antibody formation,
and an important component of the reticuloendothelial
system. It is specialized to filter blood, much as the
lymph nodes filter lymph, and is a major site of immune
response to blood-borne antigens. Blood supply to the
spleen is via the splenic artery. Blood is drained via the
splenic veins, which join the superior mesenteric vein to
form the portal vein.
The spleen is an intraperitoneal organ, normally
measuring between 6 and 13 cm; its relations are:

The red pulp is made up of venous sinuses and splenic
cords. The splenic cords are composed of reticular
fibres. This region predominantly contains erythrocytes
but has a large number of macrophages and dendritic
cells. The red pulp removes old or defective erythrocytes, white blood cells and platelets from the
circulation.

White pulp and marginal zone
The central arteriole is surrounded by a periarteriolar
lymphoid sheath (PALS) which predominantly contains T cells. These branch between B cell follicles that

could be primary (unstimulated) but will be secondary
(stimulated) in most patients. The PALS and follicles
constitute the white pulp. The white pulp is surrounded
by a marginal zone containing plasma cells, T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. The marginal
zone is supplied by venous sinuses that have gaps as wide
as 2–3 mm between the endothelial cells. The following
functions occur in the marginal zone:
• Antigen-presenting cells sample blood for antigens
• Lymphocytes exit the circulation and migrate to their
respective domains
• Monocytes enter the spleen and become macrophages.
Here they can attack blood-borne microorganisms
• Lymphocytes and dendritic cells come into contact,
allowing initiation of an immune response (see
Chapter 10).
The spleen also acts as a reservoir for platelets (20–40%
of total pool), erythrocytes (< 5%) and granulocytes
(30–50%). If the spleen enlarges for whatever reason
it filters more cells, either pooling them or destroying

them, thus reducing the amount that are circulating
(see Hypersplenism below).

Embryology
The spleen begins as a mesodermal proliferation in the
primitive gut during the fifth week of fetal development.
It is connected to the body wall by the lienorenal ligament and to the stomach by the gastrolienal ligament.

Disorders of the spleen
HINTS AND TIPS
The spleen must increase significantly in size in
order for it to be palpated below the costal margins;
thus a palpable splenic edge always indicates
splenomegaly.

Principles of haematology

Splenomegaly
Enlargement of the spleen—splenomegaly—is a frequent clinical finding that can occur in a number of different disorders (Fig. 1.5). The causes of splenomegaly
are subject to geographical variation; leukaemia and
lymphomas, glandular fever, haemolytic disorders
and portal hypertension predominate in the UK,
whereas parasitic causes are more common in tropical
countries. Clinically splenomegaly can be mild, moderate or severe; although for a more accurate assessment
of size imaging is required. Causes of massive

splenomegaly in the UK include chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelofibrosis, worldwide causes include
malaria and leishmoniasis (kala-azar syndrome).
Hypersplenism
Hypersplenism is the term used to describe the
inappropriate removal of erythrocytes, granulocytes or
platelets from the blood. Patients with hypersplenism
characteristically have:
• Splenomegaly
• Destruction or pooling of one or more cell line by the
spleen, resulting in the release of immature cells into
the peripheral blood
• Normal bone marrow.
Hypersplenism requires prompt recognition.
Management of the underlying cause will improve the
blood counts without the need for splenectomy.

Splenic infarction
Splenic infarction is relatively common and is caused by
the occlusion of the splenic artery or its major branches.
Emboli are the most common cause but local thrombi
caused by sickle-cell disease and myeloproliferative disorders also occur. Infarcts might be single or multiple. Splenic
atrophy can also occur in association with coeliac disease
and dermatitis herpetiformis. If the infarction is complete
(sometimes referred to as autosplenectomy), patients are
rendered functionally asplenic and require the same precautions as other asplenic patients (discussed below).

Congenital abnormalities
Congenital asplenia (absence of the spleen) is relatively
rare and usually occurs in conjunction with other congenital abnormalities. Approximately 10% of the population have accessory spleens, i.e. additional small areas
of splenic tissue.

Rupture of the spleen
Causes include:
• Haemopoietic disorders, e.g. myelofibrosis
• Abdominal trauma, e.g. road traffic accidents
• Infections, e.g. infectious mononucleosis (rare).
HINTS AND TIPS
Glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis) causes mild
splenomegaly for up to 6–8 weeks after infection. To
prevent rupture, patients are advised to avoid contact
sports for 8 weeks.

Splenectomy

Lymphadenopathy

Indications for splenectomy (removal of the spleen)
include:

The lymph nodes can become enlarged during any infective or inflammatory disease, but can be an important indicator of haematological disease. Acute presentation of
rapidly expanding painful nodes is likely to be a sign of
infection. Slow growth of painless nodes is often haematological in origin. If lymphadenopathy is localized, the
cause is more likely to be localized. Common causes of
lymphadenopathy are shown in Figure 1.6.

• Severe splenic trauma
• Treatment of hypersplenism, – although this is now
rare due to the advent of more modern therapies
• Splenic cysts
• Tumours of the spleen and adjacent organs.
Following splenectomy, the patient should be encouraged to mobilize as soon as possible because they
are at high risk of thrombosis (see Chapter 6 for thromboprophylaxis). There is a lifelong increased risk of infection for all individuals without a functioning spleen,
particularly with encapsulated organisms (e.g. Neisseria
meningitides, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
influenzae), as the spleen usually removes them. Management should thus include the following:
• Pneumococcal vaccine should be given (preferably
more than 2 weeks before surgery), with boosters every 5–10 years
• Hib and meningococcal vaccine should also be given
if the patient has not already been immunized
• Lifelong prophylactic antibiotics are recommended
(with penicillin V or erythromycin)
• Standby antibiotics should be kept by the patient, to
start if any symptoms of infection develop
• Patients should be warned that tropical infections
(e.g. malaria) are more likely to be severe
• Urgent hospital admission if infection develops.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Explain the structure and function of red blood cells
• Outline the process of erythropoiesis, including the functions of erythropoietin
• Discuss iron uptake, transport and excretion

• Understand and be able to interpret the full blood count and peripheral blood film.

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
OF ERYTHROCYTES

Erythrocyte structure
Erythrocytes are mature red cells with an average lifespan
of 120 days (Fig. 2.1). The normal concentration of erythrocytes in the blood is 3.9–6.5  1012/L. Erythrocytes:
• Are not nucleated and contain no organelles
• Contain millions of molecules of haemoglobin, an
oxygen-carrying pigment that gives blood its red
colour
• Have a characteristic biconcave discoid shape on
blood smears. This gives a 20–30% larger surface
area than a sphere of the same volume
• Have an average diameter of 7.2 mm
• Are highly flexible and deform readily, allowing passage through vessels of the microvasculature only
3 mm in diameter.

Erythrocyte function
The primary function of erythrocytes is the carriage of oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the lungs
and tissues. The large surface area facilitates this function.
They also play an important role in pH buffering.

Gas exchange and transport
The body’s resting requirement for O2 is 250 mL/min.
About 200 mL of oxygen is transported in each
litre of blood. Multiplied by resting cardiac output
(5 L/min), this means that 1000 mL of O2 is transported each minute. A small amount of O2 is dissolved
in the blood but the majority is transported by haemoglobin. The oxygen content of the blood depends on three
factors:

1. The concentration of haemoglobin
2. The affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen (see p. 17)
3. The solubility of oxygen in the blood (small effect).
CO2 is carried in the blood in three forms (Fig. 2.2):
1.  90% as bicarbonate
2.  5% in the form of carbamino compounds (CO2
combines with the amino groups of plasma proteins
and haemoglobin)
3.  5% in physical solution (CO2 is over 20 times
more soluble in blood than is O2).
The large bicarbonate stores of CO2 are an important
pH buffer within the blood. CO2 levels are tightly
regulated by changes in ventilation.

Electrolyte balance
Chloride, potassium and hydrogen ions are transported
across the red-cell membrane. One consequence of this
is that, in blood stored for transfusion, the extracellular
potassium level is quite high due to disruption of active
transport. In large transfusions there is potential for
hyperkalaemia in some cases.

ERYTHROPOIESIS
Erythropoiesis (Fig. 2.3) is the production of red blood
cells from the BFU-GEMM (granulocyte, erythrocyte,
monocyte, megakaryocyte) progenitor.

Sequence of erythropoiesis
Erythropoiesis occurs in erythroblastic islands within
the bone marrow. These contain macrophages, which
supply iron to the surrounding erythroid progenitor
cells. The entire sequence (from stem cell to erythrocyte)

to maintain electroneutrality, a process known as the ‘chloride shift’. (6) Hþ, produced as a result of the dissociation of H2CO3 and
carbamino compounds, is not able to leave the cell. Imidazole groups on the haemoglobin molecule buffer the protons.

Erythropoiesis

Pronormoblast

The earliest erythroid cell in the bone marrow:
• is large
• has a small amount of basophilic (blue) cytoplasm
• has a large nucleus with finely dispersed
nuclear chromatin
• contains lots of organelles
• does not contain haemoglobin

Early, intermediate,
and late normoblasts

These cells display progressive changes in
cell appearance:
• decrease in cell size
• decrease in nuclear size
• increased condensation of chromatin
• increase in cytoplasmic volume:nuclear volume ratio
• decrease in blue-staining ribosomal RNA
• increase in haemoglobin (stains pink) synthesis

Reticulocyte

Reticulocytes:
• are anucleate (nucleus is extruded)
• contain some organelles, including ribosomes
• synthesize 20–30% of total haemoglobin
• are released from the bone marrow
• mature after 1–2 days in peripheral blood
• account for 1–2% of the red cell count
• are distinguished from mature erythrocytes by brilliant
cresyl blue staining (precipitated RNA appears blue)

Erythrocyte

The mature erythrocyte appears pink and contains
no organelles

by the following stages:

The production of new blood cells balances the removal of mature cells by the spleen. Following severe
erythrocyte depletion, e.g. due to haemolysis, the rate
of erythropoiesis in the bone marrow increases. Nucleated precursors and an increased number of reticulocytes
will also appear in the peripheral blood.
HINTS AND TIPS
During their maturation, the red cells use their organelles
to produce approximately 280 million molecules of
haemoglobin. Once they have lost their nucleus and all
organelles they become fully matured erythrocytes.

Ineffective erythropoiesis
Each pronormoblast can potentially give rise to 16 erythrocytes, but some normoblasts fail to develop and are
phagocytosed by bone marrow macrophages. In a healthy
individual, the amount of this ‘ineffective erythropoiesis’
is small.

2

Fig. 2.3 Red cell precursors and the
sequence of erythropoiesis. The
appearance is that seen with the
routine Romanowsky stain, unless
otherwise specified.

Regulation of erythropoiesis
The principal factor regulating erythropoiesis is a hormone called erythropoietin.

Erythropoietin (EPO)
EPO is a heavily glycosylated polypeptide. It is 165
amino acids in length and weighs 30,400 kDa. It is
secreted by:
• Endothelial cells of the peritubular capillaries in the
renal cortex (90%)
• Kupffer cells and hepatocytes in the liver (10%).

Control of erythropoietin drive
The major stimulus for secretion is hypoxia. This can be
caused by any factor that gives rise to decreased oxygen
transport to tissues relative to tissue demand (Fig. 2.4).
Chronic renal disease (decrease in, or a complete loss
of, renal mass) or bilateral nephrectomy will lead to decreased production of EPO, resulting in anaemia. Renal
cell carcinomas can produce excess EPO, resulting in an
erythrocytosis.
Recombinant EPO, produced in animal cells, may
currently be used for:
• Anaemia due to renal failure
• Autologous blood transfusions—to enhance red cell
production prior to taking the blood sample

HINTS AND TIPS
Athletes often train at higher altitudes, with lower
partial pressures of oxygen, to stimulate erythropoietin
(EPO) production and therefore erythropoiesis. This
improves their oxygen carrying capacity and,
therefore, endurance. Athletes have also been known
to use synthetic EPO (illegally) for the same effect.

Ferric iron is poorly absorbed compared to haem, thus
putting vegetarians and vegans at an increased risk of iron
deficiency. Consumption of vitamin C with a source of
ferric iron aids its absorption, as vitamin C forms complexes with and reduces the ferric iron to ferrous.
Normal uptake and excretion of iron is illustrated in
Figure 2.5. The total iron store of the body is around 4 g,
mainly as haemoglobin (Fig. 2.6). The daily requirement
is normally around 1 mg. Absorption is controlled by
proteins in the gut. The rate of iron transfer from
epithelial cells to plasma responds to iron requirements,
e.g. it is high when stores are low or the rate of erythropoiesis is high.

Iron transport and storage proteins

IRON AND HAEM METABOLISM

Iron metabolism
Uptake and excretion of iron
Iron is found in green vegetables and meats in ferric–
protein and haem–protein complexes, respectively. Fortified breakfast cereals are also an important source of iron.

12

Free iron is toxic and is, therefore, incorporated into
haem or bound to protein within the body. Haem consists of an iron atom at the centre of a protoporphyrin
ring. Transferrin transports up to two molecules of iron
to tissues that have transferrin receptors, e.g. bone marrow. Both ferritin and haemosiderin store iron in its
ferric form. Ferritin is a water-soluble compound, consisting of protein and iron. Haemosiderin is insoluble
and consists of aggregates of ferritin that have partially
lost their protein component.

Fig. 2.5 Uptake and excretion of
iron. Iron is converted in the stomach
from Fe3þ, the ferric form to Fe2þ , the
ferrous form. This process is promoted
by ascorbic acid and other reducing
agents and inhibited by phytates,
tannic acid and tetracycline. Fe2þ is
actively absorbed in the duodenum
and jejunum. Within intestinal
mucosal cells, some iron binds
apoferritin to form ferritin, a storage
compound. The rest is transported, by
transferrin in the blood, to storage
compartments and the bone marrow.
A total of 1 mg of iron is absorbed into
the bloodstream each day. Total daily
iron turnover is 25 mg. Iron in shed
mucosal cells or not absorbed from
the diet is excreted in the faeces,
although a small amount is lost from
shed skin cells and excreted in the
urine. Extra iron is lost during
menstruation (1.5 mg per day
compared with 1 mg normally).
Hepcidin (HEC) is found
predominantly in hepatocytes,
although it is also present in plasma. It
has a central role in the regulation of
iron metabolism and absorption. HEC
inhibits absorption as well as the
release of iron from macrophages.

There is no mechanism for the excretion of excess iron.
Consequently, iron overload can occur as a result of:
• Increased absorption
• Parenteral administration.
Excess iron can result in organ damage if it is deposited in the tissues. The heart, liver and endocrine organs
are particularly at risk.

Increased absorption
This can be either primary or secondary, and results
from the following:
~ 70% incorporated

• Primary/hereditary haemochromatosis—an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by excessive
intestinal absorption of iron
• Massive ineffective erythropoiesis as seen in thalassaemia syndromes or congenital dyserythropoietic
anaemia
• Dietary excess—rare in the developed world but
sometimes seen in sub Saharan Africa.

13

Red blood cells and haemoglobin
Iatrogenic causes of increased iron uptake
• Multiple blood transfusions (1 unit of blood contains
 250 mg of iron)
• Inappropriate oral therapy
• Inappropriate parenteral iron therapy.

Haem metabolism

Treatment
It is important to start therapy as soon as possible to
prevent irreversible organ damage. Options include:
• Dietary advice (decrease intake of iron, increase
intake of natural chelators)
• Venesection
• Chelation therapy—desferrioxamine is an ironchelating agent that is administered subcutaneously
or intravenously. Two oral chelating agents, deferipone and deferasirox, are now also licensed for use.
Haemochromatosis
This condition is autosomal recessive. The affected
gene, HFE, is located on Chromosome 6. Expression of
HFE is required for hepcidin synthesis. Both of the
common mutations, C282Y (80%) and H63D (20%)
result in decreased levels of hepcidin and increased iron
absorption.
Clinical features of presentation after the age of 40
include fatigue, hepatomegaly (which may progress to
cirrhosis), bronze skin pigmentation, chondrocalcinosis,
pseudogout, diabetes mellitus, hypopituitarism,
hypogonadism, cardiac arrhythmias and
cardiomyopathy. However there is marked
heterogeneity and only about 5% of homozygotes
present with symptoms. Men present more commonly
than women. Alcohol may promote disease
presentation.

Fig. 2.7 Haem biosynthesis
within the immature red cell.
Glycine and succinyl coenzyme A
(CoA) combine to form
d-aminolaevulinic acid (d-ALA),
a reaction controlled by d-ALA
synthase and the coenzyme
vitamin B6. d-ALA is converted to
protoporphyrin, which combines
with ferrous iron to form haem.
The haem molecule combines
with a globin chain.
Haemoglobin is formed by a
tetramer of these haem–globin
complexes.

Management includes screening first degree
relatives, venesection, chelation with desferrioxamine
and liver transplant.

Haem belongs to a family of compounds known as the
porphyrins, which are characterized by the presence of a
tetrapyrrole ring. Haem is an iron-containing derivative,
the iron ion (Fe2þ) being located at the centre of the
tetrapyrrole ring of protoporphyrin IX. The haem group
is responsible for the oxygen-binding properties of
haemoglobin.

Haem biosynthesis
Haem synthesis occurs in the mitochondria of immature
red cells in the bone marrow by a process outlined
in Figure 2.7.

Haem breakdown
Degradation occurs in the macrophages of the spleen,
bone marrow and liver (Fig. 2.8).

HINTS AND TIPS
Bilirubin is a yellow pigment. If haem is broken down
faster than the liver can conjugate it, e.g. when
haemoglobin is released in haemolytic anaemias, levels
of unconjugated bilirubin rise. This bilirubin is then
deposited in the dermis resulting in a (pre-hepatic)
jaundice.

HAEMOGLOBIN

Structure of haemoglobin
Haemoglobin is composed of four globin chains held
together by non-covalent interactions (Fig. 2.9). Each
globin chain has a hydrophobic crevice, or haem pocket,
which contains the haem molecule. Each haemoglobin
can, therefore, carry 4 molecules of oxygen. The haem
pocket allows O2 binding, while protecting the iron
atom from oxidation.
Different types of haemoglobin are present at different stages of development (Fig. 2.10). Adult haemoglobin (HbA) contains two a- and two b-chains, which
are arranged as two dimers, written 2(ab). The globin

chains interact with each other in an allosteric fashion,
i.e. they bind with each other away from their active
sites. The other major haem-containing protein in
humans is myoglobin, which consists of a single chain
associated with a haem group. It is found principally
in muscle, where it provides an oxygen reserve. The
four haemoglobin subunits are structurally similar to
myoglobin.

The genetics of haemoglobin
The genes encoding the E-, g-, d- and b-chains are found
on chromosome 11. The z- and two copies of the
a-chain genes are found on chromosome 16. Each globin gene has three exons separated by two introns. The

different globin chains are synthesized separately and
then come together to form a functional Hb molecule.

HINTS AND TIPS
Haem consists of an Fe2þ ion at the centre of a
protoporphyrin ring. Haemoglobin consists of a haem
molecule with four globin chains. Normal adult
haemoglobin contains two a- and two b-chains.

Hb is oxygenated the globin chains are able to move
against each other, which will allow O2 release. This is
known as relaxed (R-) Hb. When O2 is unloaded, the metabolite 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) enters the
centre of the deoxyhaemoglobin molecule, reducing its
affinity for O2. Deoxyhaemoglobin is characterized by
a relatively large number of ionic and hydrogen bonds
between the ab dimers, which restrict the movement of
the globin chains. This is known as taut (T-) Hb.
Binding of one O2 molecule increases the affinity for
oxygen at the remaining haem groups. It is this property
of Hb which causes the characteristic sigmoidal (S-shaped)
dissociation curve.
The oxygen dissociation curve is a plot of partial pressure of oxygen (x axis) against oxygen saturation (y axis)
(Fig. 2.11).
Changes in CO2, Hþ, 2,3-DPG and temperature shift
the position of the haemoglobin curve but do not generally alter its shape. Hþ and 2,3-DPG bind to and stabilize
deoxyhaemoglobin, favouring the unloading of oxygen.
Oxygen binding to myoglobin is not altered by these factors. Haemoglobin variants also have an effect on the
oxygen dissociation curve, e.g. sickle-cell haemoglobin
shifts the curve to the right. This shift to the right enables
the patient to have a normal exercise tolerance in spite of
a low Hb count.
Oxygen is transferred from adult to fetal haemoglobin (HbF) because 2,3-DPG binds to HbF less effectively
than to adult Hb (HbA), giving HbF a higher O2 affinity
than HbA. This process is important for maternal HbA
to offload oxygen to HbF in the placenta.
HINTS AND TIPS

Physiological properties
of haemoglobin
Each haemoglobin molecule (Hb) can bind four molecules of oxygen, one at each haem site. In terms of oxygenation, Hb can exist in two configurations. When

The shift of the oxygen dissociation curve to the right in
the presence of increased Hþ concentration is called the
Bohr effect. This facilitates increased O2 release in the
tissues, but increased O2 uptake in the lungs.

Conversely, unloading of O2 at one haem group facilitates

• The glycolytic pathway (Embden–Meyerhof pathway)
• The hexose monophosphate shunt.

This is the glycolytic pathway common to all cells of the

Defects of glycolytic enzymes are rare. Approximately
95% are associated with pyruvate kinase and are restricted to red blood cells. Insufficient ATP is produced
to maintain the structural integrity of the red cell, leading to premature cell death and a haemolytic anaemia
(see p. 27).

is produced.

This is also known as the pentose phosphate pathway.

pathway of metabolism, the hexose monophosphate
(HMP) shunt. There is no net ATP yield, but two
NADPH molecules are produced per molecule of glucose-6-phosphate entering the shunt. The majority of

Full blood count and reticulocyte count
the cell’s NADPH is produced in this way. NADPH is
important in erythrocytes because it reduces oxidized
glutathione (GSSG). Reduced glutathione (GSH) is required to maintain sulphydryl groups in their reduced
state, which maintains the integrity of haemoglobin
and the cytoskeleton.
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency is an
X-linked disorder characterized by a lack of the enzyme
or by a dysfunctional enzyme (see p. 28). Patients are
usually asymptomatic, but oxidant stress can induce
acute episodes of haemolysis.

Prevention of haem oxidation
When haemoglobin is oxidized (Fe2þ ! Fe3þ) it is
known as methaemoglobin (metHb). Excess metHb is
caused by:
• Toxic substances
• Abnormal haemoglobins resistant to enzymatic
reduction (M haemoglobins)
• NADH methaemoglobin reductase deficiency
(rare).
The reduced haemoglobin can bind to albumin and
has a reduced oxygen-carrying capability. NADH from
the Embden-Meyerhof pathway and NADH methaemoglobin reductase are important in ensuring that iron remains in its reduced form.

HINTS AND TIPS
Normal ranges can vary with each laboratory. It is,
therefore, important to check the normal ranges of the
laboratory from which you are receiving the blood results.
The normal range is usually printed close to the result.

FULL BLOOD COUNT
AND RETICULOCYTE COUNT
Blood samples are added to ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA), an anticoagulant. The samples are tested
by an automated analyser, which provides the following
information:
• Hb concentration, haematocrit, red-cell count, mean
cell volume (MCV), mean cell haemoglobin (MCH)
and mean cell haemoglobin concentration (MCHC)
• White-cell count with differential
• Platelet count: some laboratories produce additional
parameters
• RDW (red cell distribution width) : a measure of the
range of red blood cell size in a sample.
Red-cell parameters and the diagnostic inferences of
abnormalities of the full blood count are shown in
Figure 2.14. When interpretting results it is important

Packed cell volume, otherwise known as the haematocrit, is equal to the red-cell count multiplied by the mean cell volume. Mean cell
haemoglobin is the haemoglobin divided by the red-cell count, while the mean cell haemoglobin concentration is the haemoglobin divided by
the haematocrit. Automated analysers are increasingly able to carry out reticulocyte counts, although they are also carried out on peripheral
blood films stained with new methylene blue. The normal range represents values for 95% of the population (mean  2 standard deviations).

PERIPHERAL BLOOD FILM
Examination of a peripheral blood film is a simple haematological investigation, which can provide a significant
amount of information. Blood is evenly spread into a film
on a glass slide, which is then dried and stained, most
often with a Romanowsky stain. The peripheral blood

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Demonstrate a good understanding of the different types of anaemia
• Distinguish iron deficiency from anaemia of chronic disease
• Understand the physiology of haemolysis
• Understand the aetiology of sickle cell anaemia and thalassaemia
• Discuss the different forms of polycythaemia.

HINTS AND TIPS
Anaemia is a low level of haemoglobin in the blood.
Haemoglobin values of less than 13 g/dL for men and
12 g/dL for women indicate anaemia, although this
does not indicate the need for a blood transfusion.

Anaemia is a common problem worldwide, affecting as
much as one-third of the world‘s population. It can be
caused by decreased production or increased destruction of erythrocytes, or by blood loss. The causes of
anaemia worldwide will reflect local patterns of disease.
In the UK the most common cause of anaemia is iron
deficiency. In hospitals, however, anaemias secondary
to chronic disease predominate. In some developing
countries, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis (TB), hookworm and malaria are the most
important causes.
The physiological response to anaemia is an attempt
to maintain adequate oxygenation of the body. The
level of 2,3-DPG rises to ensure that oxygen is unloaded
at the tissues. The cardiac output increases and the circulation becomes hyperdynamic. This can be detected
by a rapid pulse and the appearance of heart murmurs.
Anaemic patients are often pale. Symptoms vary
depending on the cause. They are listed in Figure 3.1,
and include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Fatigue
Dyspnoea
Palpitations
Headache
Tinnitus
Anorexia and bowel disturbance.

Anaemias may be classified either morphologically or
by cause. Anaemias are micro-, normo- or macrocytic,

depending on the mean cell volume (MCV). The mean
amount of haemoglobin in each erythrocyte (MCH) is
also measured. If the MCH is low, the anaemia is hypochromic. All of this information is usually given in a full
blood count result.

ANAEMIA CAUSED BY
HAEMATINIC DEFICIENCY

Iron-deficiency anaemia
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anaemia
worldwide. It occurs most frequently in women of reproductive age. If iron utilization outweighs intake,
stores eventually become depleted resulting in anaemia.
Causes of iron-deficiency anaemia include:
• Decreased iron intake, e.g. due to poor diet
• Increased iron requirement, e.g. during growth,
pregnancy and lactation
• Chronic blood loss, e.g. heavy menstrual bleeding or
gastrointestinal (GI) blood loss
• Decreased iron absorption, e.g. after gastrectomy.
HINTS AND TIPS
Iron deficiency in premenopausal women is most
commonly caused by menstrual losses. Iron deficiency
anaemia in a postmenopausal woman or a man should
raise suspicion of a gastrointestinal (GI) bleed, such as a
peptic ulcer or an occult GI cancer.

The signs and symptoms of iron-deficiency anaemia
(Fig. 3.1) are often only apparent when the haemoglobin level drops below 8 g/dL.

and ice)

An atrophic gastritis can also be seen with iron deficiency. In
Plummer–Vinson or Paterson–Kelly syndrome, dysphagia and
pharyngeal or oesophageal webs accompany the iron-deficiency
anaemia.

The haematological findings are:
• A microcytic, hypochromic anaemia (Fig. 3.2)
• Reduced serum iron and ferritin (to distinguish from
thalassaemia traits, see p. 31)
• Increased serum transferrin and total iron-binding
capacity (TIBC) (to distinguish from anaemia of
chronic disease)
• Reduced plasma transferrin saturation
• Absence of iron stores demonstrated on bonemarrow smear.

Fig. 3.2 Iron-deficiency anaemia. Red blood cells
are typically hypochromic and microcytic.

24

Clinical management involves identifying and treating the underlying cause of the iron deficiency, as well as
supplementation. Oral administration of iron is in the
form of ferrous sulphate tablets. This must be continued
for 4–6 months to replenish iron stores. Common side
effects of oral iron supplementation include constipation, diarrhoea and dark faeces. Parenteral iron is used
if the patient has malabsorption or cannot tolerate oral
preparations.

ANAEMIA OF CHRONIC DISEASE
This is the most common type of anaemia seen in hospital inpatients and in the elderly (and, therefore, it is
important to be able to understand and differentiate).
It is associated with chronic conditions such as infections, diabetes, obesity, neoplasms and disorders of
the immune system. The mechanism behind anaemia
of chronic disease is complex but is thought to relate
to activation of cellular immunity and the production
of proinflammatory cytokines.
Activated macrophages are erythrophagocytic and secrete cytokines, such as TNF, resulting in decreased
erythropoiesis and red cell lifespan. The anaemia is usually normocytic and normochromic, although a microcytic hypochromic anaemia occurs in approximately
one-third of cases.
The anaemia responds poorly to iron therapy and is
correctable only by treatment of the underlying cause.
Erythropoietin (EPO) can help to increase erythrocyte
production (but it is rarely used).

3

Anaemia of chronic disease
Making the diagnosis of anaemia of chronic disease

• Lead poisoning, which inhibits both haem and globin
synthesis and can also cause abdominal pain and
neuropathies.

or iron-deficiency anaemia
If the MCV is exceptionally low (< 70 fL), iron
deficiency is the most likely cause.
The important concept to understand is that in
anaemia of chronic disease there is no deficiency of
iron, only a deficiency in the ability to utilize iron stores.
Therefore, serum iron is low in both conditions.
• Assessment of iron status in iron deficiency:
– Serum iron: low
– Ferritin: low
– Serum transferrin: increased or normal
– Serum transferrin receptors: increased
• Assessment of iron status in chronic disease:
– Serum iron: low
– Ferritin: increased or normal
– Serum transferrin: decreased or normal
– Serum transferrin receptors: decreased or normal.

A summary of the causes of microcytic anaemias is
shown in Figure 3.3.

HINTS AND TIPS
Chronic renal failure is almost always associated with
anaemia. A decreased renal mass results in reduced
production of erythropoietin (EPO). The anaemia is
usually normochromic normocytic.

Megaloblastic anaemias
Other important causes of microcytic anaemia are
thalassaemia traits. These haemoglobin defects are detailed on page 31.
Other causes of microcytic anaemia that should be
considered are:
• Sideroblastic anaemia (which can be hereditary or
acquired) is a refractory anaemia characterized by
increased bone marrow iron and the presence of
ringed sideroblasts (red-cell precursors containing
iron granules surrounding the nucleus). Cells in the
peripheral blood are hypochromic. Some respond to
vitamin B6, particularly those with the hereditary
type. Vitamin B6 is a cofactor for haem synthesis, and
deficiency prevents iron incorporation.

In megaloblastic anaemias, impaired DNA synthesis results in the appearance of megaloblasts (abnormal red
cell precursors) in the marrow. Megaloblasts are large
cells which contain relatively large abnormal nuclei
with finely dispersed chromatin. Anaemia occurs
because megaloblasts are removed by bone marrow
phagocytes (ineffective erythropoiesis). Megaloblastic
anaemia is usually due to deficiency of vitamin B12
and/or folate. Both act as coenzymes in the pathway
of DNA synthesis. Haematological findings include:
• Macrocytic anaemia (leucopenia and thrombocytopenia in severe megaloblastic anaemia)
• Hypersegmentation of neutrophil nuclei (right shift)
• Megaloblasts seen on bone marrow smear
• Low serum vitamin B12 levels or reduced red cell
folate content.

Red blood cell disorders

Vitamin B12 deficiency
Vitamin B12 consists of cobalamin bound to a methyl or
adenosyl group. It is found mainly in foods of animal
origin (particularly seafood, meat and dairy products)
and is not affected by cooking. Intrinsic factor (IF) secreted from gastric parietal cells binds to vitamin B12,
protecting it from degradation by stomach acid. Absorption occurs in the terminal ileum. Transport within
the body is with the plasma-binding protein transcobalamin II.
Vitamin B12 is stored in the liver. Body stores are
large ( 2–3 mg), and the daily rate of loss in urine
and faeces is small relative to daily requirements
(1–2 mg); therefore, it takes more than 2 years after
the onset of the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency for anaemia to develop.
Causes of B12 deficiency include:
• Dietary, e.g. due to veganism (rare)
• Intrinsic factor deficiency, e.g. due to pernicious
anaemia, postgastrectomy or congenital
• Intestinal malabsorption, e.g. due to diseases of the
terminal ileum, such as Crohn‘s disease
• Blind loop or diverticulae in the small bowel, which
breed bacteria that utilize vitamin B12.

Pernicious anaemia
Pernicious anaemia is an autoimmune chronic atrophic
gastritis and is the most common cause of vitamin B12
deficiency in adults. Autoantibodies directed against
both the gastric parietal cells and IF are detectable in
the serum and gastric juice of most patients. Damage
to the parietal cells results in failure of IF secretion
and vitamin B12 absorption. Achlorhydria is an accompanying feature (parietal cells are also responsible for
secreting Hþ). Pernicious anaemia is associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and patients are at increased
risk of gastric carcinoma. Presenting patients often have
a positive family history of pernicious anaemia and/or
thyroid disease.
Clinical features of vitamin B12 deficiency include:
• A lemon-yellow colour to the skin (if severe), due to
a combination of pallor and jaundice
• Glossitis
• Gastrointestinal disturbances
• Weight loss
• Neurological abnormalities (peripheral neuropathy,
subacute combined degeneration of the cord (SCDC)
involving the posterior and lateral columns)
• Psychiatric disturbances.
Traditionally the Schilling test was used to diagnose
the cause of vitamin B12 deficiency, the steps of which
are as follows:
1. Oral, radioactively labelled vitamin B12 and intramuscular, non-radioactive vitamin B12 are

26

administered simultaneously. The intramuscular
B12 saturates the B12-binding proteins in the plasma
and liver, promoting urinary excretion of any
absorbed radioactive B12.
2. The urine is collected for 24 hours after B12 administration. If less than 10% of the orally administered
B12 is excreted, absorption of B12 is considered
impaired.
3. The test is repeated, but this time both oral IF and
oral B12 are given. If impaired absorption is due to
lack of IF (as in pernicious anaemia), B12 absorption
will be increased. B12 absorption will not be increased if the cause of deficiency is malabsorption.
There are now practical issues involving the handling
of radioactive materials that make the Schilling test difficult to carry out. Diagnosis is now made from B12
levels as well as the presence of autoantibodies to intrinsic factor and parietal cells. Treatment of vitamin B12 deficiency is by correction of the underlying cause, if
possible, and intramuscular injections of vitamin B12
approximately every 3 months.

Folate deficiency
Folates are derived from folic (pteroyl glutamic) acid.
They are found in foods, mainly green vegetables and
liver, and are destroyed by cooking. Absorption takes
place in the duodenum and jejunum. Folate is stored
in the liver. Unlike vitamin B12, folate stores are small
(10–15 mg) and daily losses are larger relative to daily
requirement (100–200 mg), therefore a megaloblastic
anaemia develops a few months after the onset of folate
deficiency.
Causes of folate deficiency are:
• Decreased intake, e.g. due to poor diet
• Decreased absorption, e.g. due to coeliac disease
• Increased requirement due to rapid cell multiplication, e.g. caused by pregnancy, prematurity, malignancy or haemolytic anaemia
• Increased loss, e.g. due to dialysis
• Drugs, e.g. ethanol, methotrexate (by inhibition
of dihydrofolate reductase), trimethoprim and
anticonvulsants.
HINTS AND TIPS
Alcohol abuse can cause folate deficiency as a result of
malabsorption, malnutrition and increased utilization.

Clinical features of folate deficiency are similar
to those of vitamin B12 deficiency, without the neurological and psychiatric abnormalities. Treatment of
folate deficiency is by correction of any underlying
cause and oral supplements of folic acid. Once a

Anaemia due to increased red-cell destruction (haemolytic anaemias)
megaloblastic anaemia has been diagnosed (i.e. low Hb,
high MCV) it is important to refrain from treating folate
deficiency without being sure that there is no concurrent
vitamin B12 deficiency. If there is a possibility of vitamin
B12 deficiency, supplements should be given at the same
time as folic acid to prevent the irreversible and debilitating neurological complications.

HINTS AND TIPS
Red cell folate is low in both vitamin B12 and folate
deficiency. A serum folate should be used to
differentiate between the two.

ANAEMIA DUE TO INCREASED
RED-CELL DESTRUCTION
(HAEMOLYTIC ANAEMIAS)
In haemolytic anaemias, red cells have a shortened lifespan because they are destroyed at an accelerated rate.
This increased red-cell destruction leads to anaemia,
which stimulates increased EPO production, leading to
compensatory erythropoiesis. The clinical features of
haemolytic anaemias result from the increased redcell destruction and the compensatory increase in red-cell
production (Fig. 3.4).

3

Erythropoiesis can be increased from the normal
base-line up to seven-fold, therefore haemolysis may
be compensated and not cause anaemia. Increased
erythropoiesis results in more reticulocytes being released into the circulation which raises the MCV.
Reduced red cell lifespan can be caused by erythrocyte defects or extracorpuscular defects, as shown in
Figure 3.5.
Haemolysis can occur within the circulation or be
extravascular:
• Extravascular haemolysis: is the route by which red
cells are normally broken down and occurs in the
macrophages of the spleen, bone marrow and liver.
• Intravascular haemolysis: is the destruction of red
cells within the circulation. It is characterized by
all of the features of extravascular haemolysis
(Fig. 3.4), as well as by the following:
– Haemoglobinaemia: Hb is released into the
bloodstream
– Absence of plasma haptoglobins: normally, free Hb
binds haptoglobin to form a complex that is removed by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial
system. Thus, intravascular haemolysis normally
results in the removal of more haptoglobins
– Haemoglobinuria: the Hb concentration exceeds
the tubular reabsorptive capacity and Hb is therefore excreted in the urine
– Haemosiderinuria: free Hb is absorbed by proximal
tubule cells of the kidney resulting in intracellular
deposits of haemosiderin; these are shed in the urine
– Methaemalbuminaemia: some of the Hb is oxidized and binds to albumin.

Hereditary red-cell defects
The defect is usually intrinsic to the red cell, and morphological abnormalities can often be detected on inspection of a peripheral blood smear.

Cytoskeleton defects
Hereditary spherocytosis
Hereditary spherocytosis is a common autosomal dominant disorder of variable penetrance (prevalence of 1
in 2000 in people of Northern European descent). A defective cytoskeletal protein, most commonly spectrin,
causes loss of the membrane. This defect results in progressive spherocytosis and reduced deformability of red
cells, leading to extravascular haemolysis (see Fig. 3.6).
Haematological findings include:
• Spherocytes on the peripheral blood smear (Fig. 3.7)
• Increased osmotic fragility: when suspended in saline
solutions of varying concentrations, spherocytes lyse
in less hypotonic solutions than do normal red cells.

This autosomal dominant disorder is also due to abnormalities of the cytoskeletal proteins and is most commonly caused by failure of spectrin dimers to form

The person can be asymptomatic or haemolysis can
be present at birth with significant jaundice and anaemia. The usual course after infancy is a low-grade anaemia with intermittent ‘crises’. Splenectomy can be used
to prevent crises and will result in a rise in the Hb level.

28

Pyruvate kinase deficiency
This is a rare autosomal recessive condition affecting the
glycolytic pathway, which results in a lack of ATP production. Erythrocytes become rigid and are destroyed.
The blood film shows a poikilocytosis and distorted
‘prickle’ cells (known as acanthocytes, also seen postsplenectomy). Splenectomy might improve, but not
cure, severe anaemias. Like sickle-cell anaemia, patients
with pyruvate kinase deficiency can tolerate very low Hb
levels due to their oxygen dissociation curve shifting to
the right.

Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency
Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is an X-linked disorder affecting the hexose
monophosphate shunt (Fig. 3.8). There are over 400
variants of G6PD, two of which account for the vast majority of cases: the African and Mediterranean types. Of
these two, the Mediterranean type is clinically more severe, because of a much greater reduction in enzyme
function. Patients are generally asymptomatic until haemolysis is precipitated by oxidizing factors such as:
•
•
•
•

Infection
Acidosis, e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis
Drugs, e.g. primaquine, sulphonamides
Fava beans (‘favism’—only in the Mediterranean
type).

Haemolysis is primarily intravascular. During a haemolytic crisis, Heinz bodies (precipitates of oxidized,
denatured Hb) are generated within red blood cells.
Cells that have had Heinz bodies removed upon passing
through the spleen, termed ‘bite’ or ‘blister’ cells, are
seen on the peripheral blood film. Heinz bodies will
be seen in patients following splenectomy.

In an asymptomatic patient, the peripheral blood
film might be normal. However, G6PD levels are decreased in affected males and carrier females. Assay
can be unreliable during or immediately after a haemolytic crisis because reticulocytes (increased in number
during a crisis) have higher enzyme levels than mature
red cells. In an acute crisis, the precipitating factor
should be eliminated and the circulation supported;
however, there is no specific treatment.

Other enzyme defects
Several other defects have been identified in enzymes
involved in erythrocyte metabolism. They are rare and
include hexokinase and glutathione synthetase.

Acquired defects of the red cell
Paroxysmal nocturnal
haemoglobinuria (PNH)
This is a rare, acquired red-cell membrane defect. A mutation in the gene coding for phosphatidylinositol glycan protein A (PIG-A) leads to a lack of glycosyl
phosphatidylinositol (GPI). GPI anchors certain proteins to the cell membrane. These proteins usually prevent lysis of blood cells by complement (a component
of the innate immune system, p. 88) and their absence
leads to chronic intravascular haemolysis. PNH is a stem
cell disorder, so patients may have leucopenia and
thrombocytopenia in addition to anaemia.

Antibody-mediated red-cell
destruction
Autoimmune haemolytic anaemias
In the autoimmune haemolytic anaemias (AIHAs), redcell autoantibodies cause haemolysis. A positive direct

29

Red blood cell disorders
Coombs test can be demonstrated. There are three types
of AIHA:
1. Warm AIHA (occurs at body temperature)
2. Cold AIHA (usually occurs below room temperature)
3. Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria.
Warm AIHA can be idiopathic or secondary to autoimmune disease (especially systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)), leukaemias (especially chronic lymphocytic
leukaemia), lymphomas and drugs (e.g. mefenamic
acid). The clinical features are as follows:
• Anaemia
• Jaundice
• Splenomegaly (almost always, although often very
mild)
• Evans’ syndrome, which is the combination of warm
AIHA and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
(ITP) (very rare).
Identified causes should be eliminated. Patients generally respond well to steroids but other immunosuppressive therapies (e.g. azothiaprine), the monoclonal
anti-B-cell antibody rituximab or splenectomy might
also be required.
Cold AIHA can be idiopathic or secondary to lymphoma, leukaemia or infection (e.g. mycoplasma pneumonia, Epstein–Barr virus). The clinical features are as
follows:
• Symptoms worse in cold weather
• Acrocyanosis (purplish discolouration of the skin) due
to vascular sludging arising from red-cell agglutination
• Raynaud‘s phenomenon.
Treatment involves the elimination of any cause and
keeping the patient warm. The monoclonal antibody
rituximab (anti-CD20) has been shown to be effective
in idiopathic cold AIHA and cold AIHA associated with
B-lymphoproliferative diseases.

Paroxysmal cold haemoglobinuria is a subset of cold
AIHA in which haemolysis occurs at higher temperatures but antibody binding occurs at cold temperatures.
This usually presents in children after a viral infection.
The laboratory features of warm and cold AIHAs are
compared in Figure 3.9.

Alloimmune haemolytic anaemias
Alloimmune haemolytic anaemias are caused by a reaction between antibodies and blood cells from different
people. This occurs following:
• Transfusion of ABO-incompatible blood
• Transfer of maternal antibodies across the placenta
in haemolytic disease of the newborn
• Allogeneic transplantation.

Drug-induced immune haemolytic anaemias
Certain drugs (e.g. penicillin, cephalosporins and fludarabine) can precipitate haemolysis via a variety of
immune mechanisms.

Other causes of haemolysis
• Mechanical trauma:
– Classically with mechanical heart valves
– Microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia occurs
when fibrin is deposited in small vessels. This is
seen in haemolytic uraemic syndrome, thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura, disseminated carcinoma, malignant hypertension and Gramnegative septicaemia. It is characterized by red cell
fragments (schistocytes) in the blood film

Severity of disease depends on which abnormal genes
have been inherited and whether the individual is heterozygous or homozygous.
a-Thalassaemia is most common in South-East Asia
and West Africa. There is a deletion of one, two, three
or all four a-globin chain genes. The number of
deleted genes relates to the severity of disease, although
deletion of all four a-globin chains is incompatible
with life.
Deficiency of one globin chain results in the compensatory production of the other to form the Hb
molecule. An excess of a-chains (in b-thalassaemia) or
b-chains (in a-thalassaemia) results in abnormal aggregation within red-cell precursors, predisposing them
to phagocytosis by bone marrow macrophages. Any
abnormal red cells that reach the circulation have a
shortened lifespan. A number of clinical syndromes
are recognized, based on the severity of the anaemia
(Fig. 3.10).

HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES

Thalassaemias
HINTS AND TIPS
In thalassaemias, the inheritance of defective genes
encoding for the a- or b-globin chains results in their
reduced production.

b-Thalassaemia major
In b-thalassaemia major, homozygosity for defective
genes causes b-chain production to be severely reduced.
Investigation reveals:

b-Thalassaemia occurs most commonly in Mediterranean countries, South-East Asia and Africa. There is a
partial or complete failure of b-globin chain production.
The abnormal b-chain genes are denoted bþ and
0
b for partial or complete deficiency, respectively.

Red blood cell disorders
Sickle-cell syndromes

Fig. 3.11 Skull radiograph of a child with b-thalassaemia
major. The ‘hair-on-end’ appearance is pathognomonic. It is
caused by extramedullary haemopoiesis.

• Basophilic stippling (the presence of small dots, seen
in the periphery of erythrocytes on the blood film),
target cells and normoblasts on peripheral blood
film
• Absence of HbA on electrophoresis
• A ‘hair-on-end’ appearance on skull X-ray
(Fig. 3.11). Bony changes are caused by expansion
of haemopoietic bone marrow from its normal sites.
Treatment is by regular blood transfusions (about
one a month), splenectomy and/or bone marrow transplantation. Chelation therapy is given to prevent iron
overload.

b-Thalassaemia minor
This is often known as b-thalassaemia trait. It affects
those who are heterozygous. Patients are often asymptomatic, but will usually have microcytic red blood
cells and a mild anaemia. Recognition of this syndrome is important as it has implications for genetic
counselling and can also mimic iron-deficiency anaemia, for which inappropriate iron therapy might
be given.

HINTS AND TIPS
Whereas thalassaemias are characterized by a
deficiency of either a- or b-globin chains, sickle-cell
syndromes result in a deformed form of the b-globin
chain.

32

The sickle Hb (HbS) gene is prevalent in tropical Africa
and parts of the Mediterranean, Middle East and India.
Up to 40% of the population can be heterogenous in
some areas. Sickle-cell trait is thought to afford some
protection against Plasmodium falciparum malaria and
therefore HbS genes are positively selected in areas
where malaria is endemic.
In HbS, a single base-pair substitution in codon 6 of
the b-chain replaces glutamic acid with valine. Deoxygenated HbS is 50 times less soluble than deoxygenated
HbA and it aggregates and polymerizes to form long intracellular fibres called tactoids. This causes elongation
of the red cell into a rigid sickle shape (Fig. 3.12). Reoxygenation can initially reverse the sickling process
but, after repeated episodes, the red cells become
irreversibly sickled.
HbS polymerizes best with other HbS molecules. The
presence of other types of Hb (e.g. HbF or HbA) reduces
sickling. Therefore, sickle-cell anaemia is not apparent
until approximately 6 months of age, when HbF levels
fall. Individuals with sickle-cell trait are usually asymptomatic and those who are double heterozygotes for
sickle-cell and haemoglobin C disease usually have clinically milder forms of the disease. There are four important syndromes associated with HbS:
1. Sickle-cell anaemia
2. Sickle-cell trait
3. Sickle-cell haemoglobin C disease
4. Sickle-cell b-thalassaemia.
Sickle-cell anaemia (homozygous for HbS, denoted
bsbs) is the most serious of these. Features of sickle-cell
anaemia are listed in Figure 3.13. Management strategies include:
• Pneumococcal, meningococcal and Hib vaccines
• Penicillin prophylaxis
• Folic acid supplements
• Avoidance of factors precipitating infarctive crises
• Prompt treatment of infection
• Management of infarctive crises with fluids, analgesia (including opiates), warmth and antibiotics if
necessary
• Blood transfusions and exchange transfusions when
necessary
• Prevention of iron overload (rare).
Sickle-cell trait (heterozygous, HbSA, bsb) individuals are generally asymptomatic. Sickling occurs at very
low partial pressures of oxygen that are rarely reached in
vivo. Both HbA and HbS bands are detectable on electrophoresis but sickled cells are not usually seen. Haemoglobin solubility test is positive.
Sickle-cell haemoglobin C disease (HbS/HbC, bsbc)
arises from carriage of two different abnormal b genes.
HbC (bc) also results from a single base-pair substitution at codon 6; however, in this case lysine is the

Chronic haemolytic
anaemia

Non-deformable sickled cells are trapped in the splenic microcirculation, leading to
premature cell death and the development of pigment gallstones

Infarctive or painful crises

Sickle cells lodge in small and medium sized blood vessels
Precipitated by hypoxia, infection, acidosis, dehydration and cold
Infected metacarpals and metatarsals cause dactylitis (hand–foot syndrome) in children
Chronic tissue and organ damage ensues (bones, lungs, kidneys, liver and brain)

Haemolytic crises

Usually accompany infarctive crises

Aplastic crises

Due to parvovirus infection and to folate deficiency

Spleen

Enlarged in children due to trapped red cells but infarction leads to hyposplenism
by  6 years of age. Before the spleen is destroyed the patient is susceptible to potentially
fatal splenic sequestration

Infections

Risk of overwhelming sepsis in early childhood—in asplenic state, more susceptible to
infection with encapsulated organisms, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae—prone to
Salmonella osteomyelitis

sickle-cell anaemia. Patients are more susceptible to
thrombosis and pulmonary embolism and are more
likely to develop proliferative retinopathy.
Sickle-cell b-thalassaemia (bsb0 or bsbþ) shares its
clinical features with sickle-cell anaemia, but its severity
is variable and depends on the amount of normal
b-chain synthesis.

INVESTIGATION OF
HAEMOGLOBINOPATHIES

Electrophoresis
Electrophoresis is a method used to separate out
biological molecules of similar size. An electric current
is passed through a medium containing the mixture, in

33

Red blood cell disorders
Fig. 3.14 Haemoglobin
electrophoresis is used to detect
different forms of haemoglobin (Hb). It
can detect HbS (sickle haemoglobin),
HbC, HbF (fetal haemoglobin), HbA
(adult haemoglobin) and HbH
(b tetramer, sometimes represented
as b4).

which each of the molecules travels at a different rate,
depending on its electrical charge and size. In terms
of haemoglobinopathies, the different types of haemoglobin have different structures and, therefore, different
weights/charges, so the pattern of bands produced by
electrophoresis is different (Fig. 3.14).

ANAEMIA DUE TO BLOOD LOSS

Acute blood loss
Causes of acute blood loss include trauma, surgery,
peripartum haemorrhage, haematemesis and haemoptysis. Plasma volume is replaced within 1–3 days of the
acute blood loss but it can take several weeks for the
red cell mass, and, therefore, haemoglobin, to be
replenished. Haematological findings in acute blood
loss include:
• A normocytic, normochromic anaemia
• A reticulocytosis that peaks 1–2 weeks after the
haemorrhage
• An increase in the number of platelets and neutrophils
• Neutrophil precursors in the peripheral blood.
Red-cell parameters might be normal before compensation for the loss of intravascular volume as both
plasma and red cells have been lost in their normal
proportions.

Chronic blood loss
The most common causes of chronic blood loss are
gastrointestinal lesions and menorrhagia. The consequences are those of iron-deficiency anaemia (see p. 23).

34

MARROW DEFECTS

Aplastic anaemia
Aplastic anaemia is characterized by pancytopenia and
aplasia (hypocellularity) of the bone marrow. There is a
reduction in the number of bone-marrow stem cells and
those that remain are defective and cannot repopulate
the marrow. Causes of aplastic anaemia are listed in
Figure 3.15. Treatment is supportive with removal of
any causative factors. Specific treatment is with antithymocyte globulin, ciclosporin, haemopoietic growth
factors, androgens or stem cell transplantation.

Pure red-cell aplasia
This is a rare condition in which only the red-cell precursors in the bone marrow are defective. Parvovirus B19
causes transient red-cell aplasia.

Other forms of marrow failure
Space-occupying lesions can cause anaemia, e.g. metastatic carcinoma in the bone marrow, which destroys
the bone marrow architecture.
Myelodysplasia (see p. 47) may initially present as a
macrocytic anaemia.

POLYCYTHAEMIA
(ERYTHROCYTOSIS)
Polycythaemia may be primary or secondary. Primary
polycythaemia has no physiological benefit and arises
from an abnormal clone of cells (p. 46). Secondary
polycythaemia occurs as a result of a physiological adaptation to hypoxia, with the erythrocytosis increasing
the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood. A summary of
the causes of polycythaemia is shown in Figure 3.16.
Apparent polycythaemia can occur as a result of a
reduction in the total plasma volume. Investigation to
exclude this involves measuring total red cell volume
(using 51Cr) and total plasma volume (using 123Ialbumin).

HINTS AND TIPS
Venesection, as treatment for secondary polycythaemia,
should not aim to drastically reduce the packed cell
volume (PCV) as this negates the adaptive advantage of
the compensatory erythropoiesis. Treatment should be
to a level which reduces the symptoms caused by
hyperviscosity (PCV approximately 0.55).

White blood cells
Objectives

You should be able to:
• Explain the structure of the different classes of white blood cells, and how each is related to their
specialized functions
• Discuss the mechanisms involved in leucocytosis
• Describe the causes and features of leucopenia.

STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
OF THE WHITE BLOOD CELLS
See Chapter 9 for a discussion of the immunological
functions of white blood cells.

Lymphocytes
Appearance and structure
Lymphocytes (Figs 4.1 and 4.2) are the smallest white
cells, measuring 6–15 mm in diameter. In blood they
are round but they can change shape outside the circulation. They have round, densely staining, acentric nuclei.
The sparse cytoplasm may contain a few lysosome-like
granules. Once activated, the amount of cytoplasm increases. B cells and natural killer (NK) cells tend to be
larger than T cells. The cells are differentiated by the presence of differing surface markers.

Location

connected by thin chromatin threads. In females, the nucleus has a ’drumstick’ appendage that contains the inactivated X chromosome. Neutrophils have few mitochondria
and large stores of glycogen, as well as different granules.

Location
Neutrophils circulate in blood for up to 10 hours. In response to chemotactic agents they migrate into tissues,
where they survive for 1–3 days.

Function
Neutrophils are the first cells to reach sites of inflammation and, once defunct, they are the major constituent of
pus. They destroy microorganisms by phagocytosis and
release of hydrolytic enzymes.
6–15 µm

Lymphocytes circulate between tissue, lymphatics and
the blood. The lifespan of lymphocytes varies depending on their interaction with antigens. Memory cells
can survive for decades.

Function

Azurophilic

Lymphocytes in the blood are simply in transit between
the bone marrow and lymphoid tissues, which is where
they function. They produce antibodies and kill foreign
or virally altered cells.

Neutrophils
Appearance and structure
Neutrophils (Figs 4.3 and 4.4), also known as polymorphonuclear leucocytes, measure 9–15 mm in diameter.
They have distinctive nuclei containing 2–5 lobes

Fig. 4.3 Neutrophil structure.

Monocytes
Appearance and structure
Monocytes (Figs 4.5 and 4.6) tend to be the largest
circulating blood cell, measuring up to 25 mm in diameter. They have a large, kidney-shaped nucleus. Nucleoli
are often present, giving the nucleus a ’moth-eaten’
appearance. The cytoplasm contains many lysosomes
and vacuole-like spaces producing a ’ground-glass’
appearance. Microtubules, microfilaments, pinocytotic

38

Location
Monocytes spend only a few days in the blood before
migrating into the tissues, where they differentiate to become macrophages. Macrophages survive for several
months to years in connective tissue.

Function
Monocytes form the reticuloendothelial system, which is
primarily involved in phagocytosis. They destroy dead or
defunct cells and ingest foreign material. Antigens are processed and can be presented to lymphocytes to initiate an
adaptive immune response. Macrophages also have a proinflammatory function, releasing a variety of cytokines.

Differentiation of white cells

4

Location
They are primarily found in the tissues, spending less
than 1 hour in blood.

Function
Their primary function is to combat parasitic infection.
Eosinophils are seen in allergic and certain malignant
disease processes. They also phagocytose antigen–
antibody complexes.

Basophils
Appearance and structure

Fig. 4.6 Normal monocytes are large. The nucleus tends to
be folded, not lobed, and the cytoplasm contains very fine
granules.

Eosinophils
Appearance and structure
Eosinophils (Figs 4.7 and 4.8) are similar to neutrophils
but are larger and measure 12–17 mm in diameter. Their
nucleus is sausage-shaped and usually bilobed. They have
a small, central Golgi apparatus and limited rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. Eosinophils
contain large, ovoid, specific granules and azurophilic
granules. The specific granules (1–1.5 mm long) have a
crystalloid centre containing major basic protein, eosinophilic cationic protein and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.
The outside of the granule contains several enzymes,
including histaminase, peroxidase and cathepsin.

Basophils (Figs 4.8 and 4.9) are 14–16 mm in diameter
with a bilobed, ’S-shaped’ nucleus. They are named
after their highly basophilic cytoplasmic specific granules,
but also contain azurophilic granules. Specific granules
(0.5 mm in diameter) are large, membrane-bound, round
or oval structures. They push into the plasma membrane
causing a ’roughened perimeter’. The granules contain
heparin, histamine, chemotactic factors and peroxidase.

Location
Basophils undergo maturation in the bone marrow over
2–7 days. They are found in the peripheral blood, and
last for up to 2 weeks.

Function
Basophils are functionally very similar to mast cells, although they are of two different lineages. Unlike basophils, mast cells are located in the tissues. Through
interactions with immunoglobulin E (IgE) basophils
cause local inflammatory responses. Basophils are not very
well understood and the extent to which they participate
in immune reactions in vivo is unclear. They are thought
to mediate immediate (type I) hypersensitivity reactions
such as asthma and anaphylaxis (see Chapter 12), along
with mast cells. Recent studies in mice show that basophils
are important in a new pathway of anaphylaxis involving
IgG and platelet-activating factor (PAF).

DIFFERENTIATION OF WHITE
CELLS
Granulocytes and monocytes are formed in the bone
marrow from a common precursor cell (CFU-GM).
Their differentiation pathways are shown in Figure 4.10.
Neutrophils usually develop within bone marrow, but
with increased demand, e.g. severe infection, band cells
may be seen in blood. Using a neutrophil with a threelobed nucleus as a marker for normal granulocyte maturation, a shift of development to either the right or left can be
seen. Left shift is indicated by the presence of immature

DIFFERENTIAL WHITE COUNT
The differential white count breaks down the white-cell
count to identify the level of each of the five peripheral
white cell lines: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils and basophils. This is automated and uses stains,
cell size and light scatter to differentiate between the different cells. The parameters for white cells and platelets, and
the diagnostic inferences made from their abnormalities,
are given in Figure 4.12. As with all normal ranges, they
vary in different populations and in different laboratories.

Leucocytosis is an increase in the total white cell
count (> 11  109/L). One leucocyte type, most commonly neutrophils, tends to predominate, with small
increases in other types. Diseases associated with
increases in white-cell count are listed in Figure 4.14.
HINTS AND TIPS

Causes of neutropenia
and agranulocytosis

A general increase in white blood cells is called a
leucocytosis and in lymphocytes is called a lymphocytosis;
a specific increase in granulocyte counts is known as a
granulocytosis. If neutrophils, eosinophils or basophils are
selectively raised, then the terms neutrophilia, eosinophilia
or basophilia are used, respectively.

• Inadequate granulopoiesis
• Accelerated removal of granulocytes
• Drug-induced neutropenia.

Inadequate granulopoiesis

LEUCOPENIA

Reduced or ineffective production of neutrophils in the
bone marrow results in neutropenia. This can be generalized bone marrow failure such as:

• Leucopenia: reduction in white blood cells
(<4  109/L), most commonly neutrophils

• Aplastic anaemia (see p. 34): a group of disorders
characterized by anaemia, thrombocytopenia and
neutropenia

Examples

Lymphomas, myelodysplastic syndromes

Leucopenia
• Invasion of the bone marrow in leukaemias and
lymphomas. Neutropenia is accompanied by anaemia and thrombocytopenia
• Megaloblastic anaemia due to vitamin B12 or folate
deficiency (see p. 25): this leads to impaired
DNA synthesis, resulting in abnormal granulocyte
precursors that are more susceptible to destruction.
• Chemotherapy
• Myelodysplasia.
Or a specific failure of neutrophil production:
• Congenital (Kostmann’s syndrome)
• Exposure to certain drugs (Fig. 4.15)
• Cyclical.

Accelerated removal of granulocytes
• Immune-mediated destruction:
– Idiopathic

– Due to drug therapy, e.g. chlorpromazine
– Hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis
• Hypersplenism causing splenic sequestration of
neutrophils
• Severe infection (e.g. typhoid, miliary tuberculosis)
resulting in increased peripheral utilization.

Drug-induced neutropenia
Drug-induced neutropenia is increasing in frequency.
Two mechanisms operate:
1. Direct toxicity: interference with protein synthesis
or cell replication of pluripotent stem cells causes
a dose-dependent, generalized bone marrow
depression.
2. Immune-mediated destruction of neutrophils: this
is not related to drug dose and usually occurs early
in the course of the therapy.

Causes of lymphopenia
Lymphopenia is most commonly secondary to minor,
community-acquired viral infections. Other causes of
lymphopenia are:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy
Trauma or surgery
Cushing’s syndrome
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
Hodgkin’s lymphoma
HIV infection and AIDS.

Mild lymphopenia has little in the way of clinical
consequences and it is only in situations of prolonged
severe lymphopenia, such as that seen in HIV-positive
patients, where significantly clinical sequelae are
evident.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the processes involved in neoplastic proliferation of white blood cells
• Compare the differences between myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms
• Outline the aetiology of Hodgkin’s and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
• Explain the different forms of myeloma.

INTRODUCTION TO
HAEMATOLOGICAL
MALIGNANCIES
Haematological malignancies may affect the bone marrow, lymph nodes and blood. Like other malignancies,
they begin with the formation of an aberrant cell due to
somatic (genetic) mutation. These mutations occur as a
result of genetic and environmental factors which are often specific to the tumour involved and result in increased proliferation, reduced apoptosis and reduced
differentiation. All subsequent proliferating cells are
identical (clones) to the original aberrant cell. A neoplastic clone can arise at any stage in development, from
the myeloid stem cell and in either one of the three lineages, or from a lymphoid clone.
Haematological malignancies are complicated and
are classified differently by different individuals and organizations. They are broken down into separate categories according to the current perception of the cell of
origin, the tissue in which they usually arise, the molecular basis of the clonal proliferation and any specific
characteristics. We have attempted to classify them as
simply as possible:
• Myeloproliferative disorders—bone marrow disorders resulting in excess of one or more type of myeloid cell (i.e. a proliferation of blood cells)
• Myelodysplastic syndromes—diverse group of bone
marrow disorders that result in the clonal production of abnormal (dysplastic) myeloid cells. These
cells fail to mature properly, resulting in blast (immature) cells
• Leukaemias—a collection of diseases that result in a
clonal proliferation of white blood cells
• Lymphomas—clonal proliferations of lymphoid
cells, mainly from lymph nodes and extranodal
tissue
• Myeloma—malignant proliferation of plasma cells.

Managing haematological malignancies is difficult
and is almost always performed by specialists. Often
chemotherapeutic drugs and immunosuppressants are
used. More targeted treatments have emerged because
of developments in molecular and cell biology, as well
as cytogenetics. Examples of newer therapies include:
• Monoclonal anti-B cell antibodies (rituximab)
• Anti-angiogenic
therapy
(thalidomide
and
lenalidomide)
• Purine analogues (fludarabine)
• Proteosome inhibitors (bortezomib)
• ATRA (all trans-retinoic acid) targets the cytogenetic
translocation in acute promyelocytic leukaemia
• Specific treatment to target the mutation of acute
myeloid leukaemia (imatinib).
This does not mean that more standard therapies
have been abandoned, but that newer treatments are
improving the remission rates and the time to relapse
in many haematological malignancies.
We discuss some important haematological investigations at the end of this chapter.

Myeloproliferative neoplasms
These disorders arise as a result of the neoplastic clonal
proliferation of multipotent myeloid stem cells, which
are capable of following one or more differentiation
pathways (Fig. 5.1).
Myeloproliferative disorders encompass:
• Primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia rubra vera)
• Myelofibrosis
• Primary thrombocythaemia (essential thrombocythaemia)
• Chronic myeloid leukaemia—this disorder is discussed later. See p. 49.
Myeloproliferative disorders are not malignant neoplasms but can sometimes evolve into acute myeloid
leukaemia.

thrombocythaemia

Primary thrombocythaemia (essential
thrombocythaemia)
This is a disorder involving clonal proliferation of the
megakaryocyte cell line, although it is, in reality, a stem
cell disorder. A sustained raised platelet count
(> 450  109/L) is the dominant feature. It usually presents after the age of 50 but can occur at any age. About
half of affected individuals are asymptomatic at diagnosis, thus it is often an incidental finding on a routine
blood test.
The disorder is characterized clinically by thrombosis
or bleeding. Haemorrhage is more common with higher
platelet counts, e.g. > 1000  109/L. Some patients develop acquired von Willebrand’s disease because the
high level of platelets affects the von Willebrand protein
(see p. 66). There are raised levels of abnormal megakaryocytes in the bone marrow. Splenic atrophy, as a result
of microinfarcts, may occur but is rarely clinically
relevant.
Treatment involves the reduction of platelet levels by
hydroxycarbamide, a-interferon or anagrelide (secondline therapy). Aspirin is commonly used to reduce
thrombotic risk.

Primary polycythaemia (polycythaemia
rubra vera)
A proliferative abnormality of stem cells gives rise to increased numbers of red cells, often with an increase in
the numbers of neutrophils and platelets. The red-cell

46

precursors are inappropriately sensitive to insulin-like
growth factor þ/– interleukin-3 and therefore do not
require erythropoietin (EPO) to avoid apoptosis. The
majority of patients with primary polycythaemia have
a gain-of-function mutation of the Janus kinase (JAK)
2 gene. This mutation is also present in a high proportion of patients with primary thrombocythaemia and
idiopathic myelofibrosis.
Polycythaemia rubra vera presents insidiously after
the age of 40, with symptoms attributable to hyperviscosity and vascular occlusion. These symptoms include
headache, dizziness and stroke. Thrombosis is the most
common serious complication. Clinical signs include
plethora, splenomegaly and hepatomegaly.
Haematological findings include:
• Raised packed cell volume, red-cell mass, haemoglobin and red-cell count
• Raised white-cell count (neutrophils)
• Raised neutrophil alkaline phosphatase
• Raised platelet count
• Hyperplasia of erythroid, granulocytic and megakaryocytic cells in bone marrow
• Decreased serum EPO
• Increased plasma urate.
Treatment is by venesection reducing the packed cell
volume to within normal limits. Aspirin offers a slight
reduction in thrombotic risk. Other therapies, reserved
for patients with higher thrombotic risk, include cytotoxic drugs (hydroxycarbamide is the drug of choice)
and irradiation of the bone marrow using 32P. However,
32
P can cause more malignant transformation. Some

5

Introduction to haematological malignancies
patients develop acute leukaemia or myelofibrosis. The
main causes of death are thromboses and acute leukaemia. However, if the red cell count is kept low, the prognosis is good. Modern therapy extends 50% survival
beyond 10 years compared to historical figures of less
than 2 years.

Myelofibrosis
Also known as primary myelosclerosis, idiopathic myelofibrosis is characterized by clonal proliferation of
pluripotent stem cells. Idiopathic myelofibrosis can be
preceded by other myeloproliferative conditions; 25%
of cases are preceded by polycythaemia rubra vera. Bone
marrow is replaced by fibrous tissue produced by fibroblasts in conjunction with proliferation of dysplastic
megakaryocytes. Extramedullary metaplasia is also a
feature, with the spleen being the primary site, resulting
in massive splenomegaly. The same process may also
result in hepatomegaly. The disease affects individuals
from middle-age onwards. Clinical features include
constitutional symptoms of weight loss, night sweats
and fever, or those relating to anaemia (fatigue, shortness of breath and palpitations) or splenomegaly (abdominal pain due to the mass effect). Laboratory
features at presentation include anaemia, leucocytosis
and thrombocytosis. The blood film is often diagnostic,
revealing:
• Granulocyte precursor cells
• Nucleated red blood cell precursors
• Tear-drop
poikilocytosis
(tear-drop-shaped
erythrocytes).
Supportive care (including transfusions of red cells
and platelets) can be useful, and splenectomy or splenic

irradiation is sometimes beneficial. Chemotherapy with
hydroxycarbamide or a-interferon 2b can slow or reverse fibrosis. Median survival is 5 years. Approximately
10% of cases transform into acute myeloblastic leukaemia (AML).

Myelodysplastic syndromes
Myelodysplasias are acquired neoplastic disorders of
bone marrow, with replacement of normal cells by a
clone of abnormal (dysplastic) cells. These cells are unable to mature normally, usually affecting at least two
cell lines (erythrocytes, granulocytes, monocytes or
platelets) and as a result blast cells may accumulate.
The dysmorphic cells are easily recognizable on microscopy with an increasing blast cell count indicating a
poorer prognosis. Common features of myelodysplasias
include the following:
• Occurs most commonly in the elderly and in males
• Slowly progressive disease, often with anaemia, easy
bruising or bleeding and infections
• May follow chemo- and/or radiotherapy for another
condition
• Normal or increased bone marrow cellularity
• Cytopenias
• Progression to AML.
The traditional classification was the FrenchAmerican-British (FAB) classification, but this was revised by the World Health Organization (WHO) in
2008 (Fig. 5.2). Prognosis is calculated using the International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) based on the
percentage of bone marrow blast cells. Generally speaking, the greater number of blasts and the presence of
cytopenias indicate a worse prognosis.

Haematological malignancies
As well as the morphological appearance, cytogenetic
changes will influence prognosis and treatment. Thus
cytogenetic analysis should be undertaken at presentation. Treatment, until recently, has been mainly supportive with blood and platelet transfusions, as well
as antibiotics if needed. There is evidence that the use
of biological therapy such as EPO and G-CSF will improve survival in some patients. Younger patients with
more advanced disease will be treated with intensive
chemotherapy and possibly bone marrow transplantation. There may also be a role for thalidomide and its
derivatives.

These blast cells can be seen on peripheral blood films.
The majority of cases have no known cause, although
they can progress from both the myeloproliferative
and myelodysplastic disorders. The incidence increases
with age (median 70 years) with an average of 4 per
100,000 per year. The 5-year survival rate is over 50%
in children and about 30–50% in adults who are treated. Elderly patients have a poorer prognosis. AML is associated with:

Leukaemia
Features common to leukaemias
Leukaemias are a group of disorders characterized by accumulation of clonal white blood cells in bone marrow.
The leukaemic ‘blast’ cells are non-functional and replace normal bone marrow, encroaching on normal
haemopoietic cell development. This leads to anaemia,
neutropenia and thrombocytopenia.
HINTS AND TIPS
Many symptoms of leukaemia are due to organ
infiltration by leukaemic cells. Organs that are
commonly involved include:
• Bones
• Lymph nodes
• Liver and spleen
• Skin
• Central nervous system.

Radiation exposure
Toxins: benzene, alkylating agents
Hereditary abnormalities, e.g. Down syndrome
Pre-existing haematological disease: chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML), myelodysplastic syndromes.

Usually, however, there is no obvious cause.
Patients are often acutely unwell at presentation and
can present with:
•
•
•
•
•

Anaemia, malaise, sweats, weight loss
Infections (chest, mouth, skin)
Bleeding
Skin infiltration (gums M4/5)
Leucostasis.
HINTS AND TIPS
Leucostatic symptoms occur when excess white blood
cells increase the viscosity of the blood. This causes
occlusions in the heart, lungs and brain. Symptoms
include reduced consciousness, retinal haemorrhages
and pulmonary infiltrates.

Acute leukaemias are myeloblastic (AML) or lymphoblastic (ALL).
The management of patients with leukaemia is done
by haematologists in the hospital setting.

AML also has both a FAB and a WHO classification.
The FAB classification divides AML into eight subtypes
based on morphology and cytochemistry M0–M7. The
WHO classification includes more recently identified
molecular abnormalities which have prognostic significance. Chromosome rearrangements have prognostic
value with t(15;17), t(8;21) and inversion of 16 having
better outcomes than monosomy 7. t(15;17) is the
specific mutation associated with acute promyelocytic
leukaemia. It is the only form of AML which responds
to all trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)
Like other leukaemias, AML is treated by specialists
and often as part of a clinical trial. It is treated in two
phases:

Acute myeloid leukaemia

• Induction—to achieve remission
• Consolidation (intensification).

AML (sometimes called acute myeloblastic leukaemia)
is the most common leukaemia found in adults, although it can occur at any age. It is a clonal disorder
of myeloid origin, producing primitive blast cells that
invade bone marrow, suppressing all normal cell lines.

To achieve remission anthracycline-based chemotherapy regimens are used. Provided patients remain in
remission at the end of consolidation, autologous or
allogenic stem cell transplantation is then an option
for some patients. Survival is best in younger patients.

Classification of leukaemia is based on:
• Cell lineage (lymphoid or myeloid)
• Developmental stage of leukaemic cells: acute leukaemia involves proliferation of immature cells
(blasts) and, untreated, is usually rapidly fatal;
chronic leukaemia involves more mature cells, and
a more prolonged course is characteristic.

48

Introduction to haematological malignancies
The haematological consequences of AML are treated to
improve symptoms and outcome. This includes transfusions of red cells/platelets, leukopheresis to reduce blood
viscosity and the prevention/treatment of infection.
AML
Patients usually present with a short history of recurrent
sore throats or easy bruising. A blood count reveals
anaemia and thrombocytopenia. The white-cell blood
count (WBC) may be low or high but there will be blast
cells in the bone marrow which may also be seen in the
blood. These patients require immediate admission to
hospital. If they are not treated with intensive
chemotherapy they will rapidly die of sepsis or
bleeding.
Stem cell transplantation (SCT) involves using highdose chemotherapy (and or radiotherapy) to destroy all
cancerous cells in the bone marrow, and they are then
replaced with (disease-free) haemopoietic stem cells.
The new stem cells can be sourced from the bone
marrow, hence the name bone marrow transplant, or
can be a peripheral blood stem cell transplant (PBSCT).
These cells can come from the patient’s own body
(autologous SCT) or from another person (allogenic
SCT). This other person is usually a human leucocyte
antigen (HLA)-matched relative, in order to prevent
host immune rejection, which is known as graft-versushost disease (GVHD). Immunosuppressive drugs such
as cyclosporin and methotrexate are used to reduce the
incidence of GVHD.
Other complications of SCT include graft failure,
opportunistic infections, and interstitial pneumonitis.

HINTS AND TIPS
The term ‘remission’ refers to the disappearance of the
signs and symptoms of the disease. This can be
permanent or a patient may suffer from a relapse.
Sometimes ‘complete remission’ is used to describe a
clinical disappearance as well as a biochemical or
histological return to normality.

Chronic myeloid leukaemia
CML, also known as chronic granulocytic leukaemia, is
a progressive accumulation of mature myeloid cells in
blood and bone marrow. At presentation the white-cell
count is usually in the range 20–200 x 109/L (normal
range 4–11  109/L), but can be much higher. These

5

are mainly myelocytes and neutrophils but blasts are detectable in the early, chronic phase. An increase in basophils is characteristic. It accounts for 15% of all
leukaemias. The average incidence is 1 in 100,000, peaking between 40 and 60 years of age. It is rare in children
and there is a slight male preponderance. Clinically, it
runs a predictable course, with three identifiable phases
of the disease:
1. Chronic
2. Accelerated
3. Blast crisis (AML/ALL).
People normally present in the chronic phase following an incidental finding on a full blood count or with
constitutional (malaise, weight loss, sweats) or leucostatic symptoms. Many patients will quickly transform
to an accelerated or blast crisis stage, if untreated.
The Philadelphia chromosome is a pathognomonic
translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, written
as t(9:22), associated with CML. This translocation,
found in granulocytic, erythrocytic and megakaryocytic
precursor cells, fuses parts of two genes (BCR–ABL) to
create an abnormal tyrosine kinase, which plays a pivotal role in the genesis of chronic phase CML. Tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKI) are now the cornerstone of CML
treatment, as opposed to chemotherapeutic agents,
which were popular in the past. A TKI, imatinib (traded
as Glivec), is now first line for the chronic phase of CML,
and provides good remission rates. Bone marrow transplantation is potentially curative, especially in young
patients; however, the benefits of treatment must be
weighed against the risks of transplantation.
Median survival before the introduction of imatinib
was 5½ years. Short term (at 5 years) observational
studies show that imatinib produces better complete cytogenetic remission than other therapies, but long-term
(> 10 years) studies are ongoing. 65% of patients
started on imatinib remain well at 10 years. Good prognostic factors include:
• Youth
• Small spleen at presentation
• Low white-cell count at presentation.

Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
ALL accounts for 80% of all childhood leukaemias and
60% of cases present before 20 years of age. It is the most
common cancer in children. The peak incidence occurs
between 2 and 10 years of age. Presentation outside of
this range confers a poorer prognosis. The most common presenting symptoms are fatigue, bruising, bleeding, infections and hepatosplenomegaly. ALL may be
associated with:
• Radiation
• Chemicals
• Down syndrome.

49

Haematological malignancies
However, usually there is no obvious cause.
In 80% of cases, the blast cells are of B cell origin. ALL
is more responsive to combination chemotherapy than
AML and long-term remission rates of around 80% in
children are attained. The overall survival rate in adults
is 35%. Cure rates are highest in girls over 2 and under
10 years of age. The Philadelphia chromosome is seen in
10–20% of cases and is associated with a poor outcome.

Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia
CLL occurs most frequently in people over the age of 60
years (median age 65) and accounts for 25% of all leukaemias. It is twice as common in men as in women,
with a total incidence of 3–4 per 10,000. CLL arises
from a proliferation of neoplastic lymphoid cells (B
cells), which infiltrate the marrow, lymph nodes, spleen
and liver. It is a slowly progressing, low-grade disorder.
Patients commonly present with painless lymphadenopathy and anaemia. Because of diminished immunity they may present with a chest infection. On a
blood film, leukaemic cells resemble mature lymphocytes, although typical ‘smear cells’ are also seen. The
combination of a typical peripheral blood film and
characteristic immunophenotype of the leukaemic cells
is enough to make the diagnosis. Disease transformation into prolymphocytic leukaemia occurs rarely and
usually after several years. Median survival is 5–8 years
and treatment (chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation) is usually aimed at limiting rather than curing the
disease. The introduction of combination chemotherapy which includes rituximab has improved the remission rate. Many elderly patients will die of an unrelated
condition because of the slowly progressive nature of
the disease.

Malignant lymphomas
Lymphomas are a group of neoplastic disorders characterized by the proliferation of a primitive cell which produces clonal expansion of lymphoid cells. They
primarily involve the lymph nodes and extranodal lymphoid tissue, e.g. mucosal-associated lymphoid tissue
(MALT) and spleen. Malignant lymphomas are divided
into two categories:
1. Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
2. Hodgkin’s disease (Hodgkin’s lymphoma).
HINTS AND TIPS
Although it is easy to think of leukaemias as disease of
the bone marrow and lymphomas as disease of the
lymph nodes, remember that leukaemic cells are found
in the blood and that lymphoma cells commonly spread
to the bone marrow and blood.

50

Hodgkin’s disease
Hodgkin’s disease (HD) characteristically affects young
people in the third and fourth decades of life and is
more common in men. Environmental factors associated with increased risk of HD include Epstein-Barr
virus (EBV) and immunosuppression.
Diagnosis requires a lymph node biopsy showing the
presence of pathognomonic Reed–Sternberg (RS) cells
or derivatives, typically mixed with a variable inflammatory infiltrate. Disease severity is directly proportional to
the number of RS cells found in the lesions and indirectly linked to the number of lymphocytes in the lesions. The RS cells are neoplastic derivatives of B cells
with a dysfunctional immunoglobulin gene. RS cells
are bi- or multinucleated, with prominent eosinophilic
nucleoli, giving an ‘owl’s-eye’ appearance.
The clinical features of HD are shown in Figure 5.3.
Ninety-five per cent of HD is termed classical
HD, as opposed to nodular lymphocyte-predominant
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NLPHL). Classical HD has
been classified into four histological subtypes:
• Nodular sclerosing—most common subtype of HD.
Unlike other types it is more common in women.
Collagen bands divide lymph nodes into nodules
• Lymphocyte-rich—larger number of lymphocytes,
conferring a better prognosis
• Mixed cellularity—fewer lymphocytes and more RS
cells than lymphocyte-rich form
• Lymphocyte-depleted—RS cells are present in large
number, with relatively few lymphocytes. This subtype has the poorest prognosis of all subtypes of HD.
Although histological composition is an important
prognostic factor, clinical staging (Ann Arbor staging)
is the most accurate indicator of long-term prognosis
in HD (Fig. 5.4).
Treatment depends on stage. Many patients require
treatment with both combination chemotherapy and
radiotherapy. Although this results in remission for
many there are risks (Fig. 5.5). Modern treatment aims
to try and reduce dual therapy as much as possible but

some patients will continue to require this. In addition,
patients with all lymphomas should receive the polyvalent pneumococcal and influenza vaccines.
Both chemotherapy and radiotherapy are associated
serious complications, some of which are shown in
Figure 5.5.
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
This is a serious metabolic complication of
chemotherapy in cancers treatment, especially in
relation to acute leukaemias and poorly differentiated
lymphomas. As the cancerous cells are destroyed they
release their intracellular components into the
circulation resulting in hyperkalaemia, hyperuricaemia
and hyperphosphataemia. High levels of phosphate
bind to plasma calcium resulting in hypocalcaemia.
These electrolyte abnormalities can result in renal
failure, arrhythmias and sudden death. High urate
levels can precipitate acute attacks of gout. In order
to prevent TLS all patients should receive allopurinol
(a xanthine oxidase inhibitor, which reduces
production of urate), in addition to IV hydration.

5

Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas (NHL) are a group of malignant diseases involving lymphoid cells, and five times
more common than HD. Around 85% of NHL are of Bcell origin. Incidence of NHL rises with age and is more
common in men than in women. There are several
aetiological factors associated with NHL, including:
• Infections, e.g. EBV and human T cell lymphotrophic
virus 1
• Immunodeficiency, e.g. immunosuppressive therapy, solid organ or stem cell transplants, HIV
• Autoimmune disorders
• Irradiation and carcinogens
• Inherited disorders, e.g. ataxia telangiectasia.
The incidence of NHL has increased since the 1970s,
probably because of increases in the number of immunodeficient people.
NHL tends to have more extranodal involvement
than HD. The features of NHL are outlined in Figure 5.6.
Initially, the 30 or so NHLs were classified under the
Revised European American Lymphoma (REAL) classification, however this has been superseded by a WHO
classification.
Clinically there are two categories of NHL:
• Low-grade: more indolent and less aggressive. Longer median survival (approximately 10 years), but
cannot usually be cured
• High-grade: more aggressive and rapidly growing.
Chemotherapies can target these rapidly growing
cells, thus a significant proportion can be cured.
HINTS AND TIPS
Traditional chemotherapeutic agents prevent cell
division and therefore affect all dividing cells. This
action is of benefit when used against the rapidly
dividing cancer cells, but it also damages normal cells.
A new generation of pharmacological agents are aimed
specifically at affected cells. A monoclonal antibody
against CD20 þ ve B-cells, known as rituximab, is now
used extensively in all cancers of B-cell origin.

Haematological malignancies
Management depends on the specific type of NHL.
NHLs tend to be managed, much like HD, using chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy. High-grade NHLs
are normally treated more aggressively.
Some specific NHLs include:

1

High-grade
• Diffuse large B-cell NHL—between one-third and
one-half of all NHL. These tend to respond well to
treatment. Currently rituximab is recommended,
in combination with the CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone)
chemotherapeutic regimen. Together, they are referred to as R-CHOP
• Mantle cell lymphoma—approximately 5% of NHL.
Can be very aggressive, with most patients suffering
from advanced disease by the time they present. Often responds to the R-CHOP regime
• Burkitt’s lymphoma—this highly aggressive B-cell
NHL mostly affects children, and is prevalent in Central Africa. There is a strong association with EBV. Interestingly, the endemic form of Burkitt’s lymphoma
commonly affects the jaw, as well as abdominal organs. Treatment is with combination chemotherapy
and rituximab.

Low-grade
• Follicular lymphoma—accounts for approximately
one-quarter of all NHL, and is the most common
low-grade NHL. Stages I–II disease can be managed
with radiotherapy. Stages III–IV require treatment
with rituximab and combination chemotherapy.

Fig. 5.7 Serum electrophoresis. Electrophoresis uses an electric
field to separate proteins or nucleic acids on the basis of size,
electric charge and other physical properties. An electric current
is passed across a support matrix (e.g. cellulose acetate,
polyacrylamide gel) or a solution. As particles travel at different
rates (because of their different electrical charge and size), they
gradually separate to form bands, which can be visualized by
staining. Lane 1, normal sample; lane 2, patient with antibody
deficiency; lane 3, patient with infection and polyclonal raised
immunoglobulins; lane 4, patient with myeloma and
monoclonal immunoglobulin.

Myeloma
Multiple myeloma
Multiple myeloma is a malignant proliferation of plasma
cells in bone marrow, which produce a monoclonal paraprotein and/or light chain. The monoclonal immunoglobulin is found in serum, whereas the light chain or
Bence Jones protein is found in urine. These monoclonal
proteins form a discrete band on the electrophoretic strip
(Fig. 5.7). IgG is the most common type of myeloma.
The incidence of multiple myeloma is 4–6/100,000 a
year. It is a disease of late middle age and the elderly. The
aetiology is unknown, apart from an increased incidence
related to exposure to ionizing radiation. The International Staging System (ISS) categorizes myeloma into
Stage I, II and III, according to age, laboratory and cytogenetic results.

Clinical features
• Bone destruction such as diffuse osteoporosis and
pathological fractures are a common feature. These
are described as lytic lesions. They are thought to
arise as a result of bone resorption induced by the
production of osteoclast-activating factor (OAF) by

the myeloma cells. The axial skeleton is most commonly affected (see Fig. 5.8 for the radiographic
appearance of multiple myeloma)
Neurological symptoms due to the compression of
the spinal cord or roots by collapsed vertebrae
Normochromic normocytic anaemia results from
marrow infiltration
Rouleaux formation is seen on blood film due to excess high-molecular-weight proteins in the serum
(see Fig. 5.9)
Repeated infections can occur due to hypogammaglobulinaemia and neutropenia
Hypercalcaemia occurs in 10% of cases. This is due
to increased resorption of bone and is indicative of
advanced disease
Chronic renal failure occurs in 20–30% of patients.
Factors that can contribute to renal failure in multiple myeloma are:
– Increased blood viscosity
– Hypercalcaemia
– Renal tubular obstruction by proteinaceous casts
– Toxic effect of Bence Jones protein on proximal renal tubules
– Infection

Introduction to haematological malignancies

• An increased number of (clonal) plasma cells in the
bone marrow
• Related organ or tissue damage (including osteolytic
bone lesions on skeletal survey).
Complete remission is only possible if a solitary lesion is successfully excised, or a SCT eradicates the diseased cells. Other than this, treatment is not curative.
Combination chemotherapy with an alkylating agent,
an immune modulator or possibly a proteasome inhibitor is often used. There is a strong role for steroids in
first-line treatment. Stem cell transplantation is a possible treatment for a small number of younger patients
who respond to first-line treatment. All patients should
have their pain addressed adequately, along with sufficient hydration. Patients are routinely given bisphosphonates to inhibit bone resorption.

myeloma showing many osteolytic bone lesions. Some call this
appearance a ‘pepper pot skull’ (courtesy of Dr M Makris).

– Dehydration
– Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
– Light-chain deposition in glomeruli
• Amyloidosis (see below) can lead to nephrotic
syndrome
• An abnormal bleeding tendency occurs owing to the
adverse effect of paraprotein on platelets and coagulation factors.
If myeloma is suspected a bone marrow sample is
needed, along with a skeletal survey and both serum
protein electrophoresis and immunofixation of urine.
A skeletal survey consists of X-rays of the skull, thorax,
pelvis and proximal long bones. Diagnosis requires
evidence of the following:
• Monoclonal paraprotein in serum and/or urine

Solitary myeloma (plasmacytoma)
A plasmacytoma is a solitary tumour found either in the
bone or soft tissues, especially the upper respiratory
tract. Osseous plasmacytomas usually progress to multiple myeloma. Extraosseous plasmacytomas do not disseminate and, after excision and radiotherapy,
prognosis is excellent.

Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia
Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia is a neoplastic
monoclonal proliferation of cells derived from the
B-cell lineage. It is seen as a low-grade NHL. A monoclonal
IgM paraprotein (macroglobulin) is produced, increasing
blood viscosity markedly. Tumour cells are found in
blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. The
incidence is 3–6/100,000 a year and is higher in males
than in females. Most patients present between the
fifth and seventh decade. Survival averages 2–5 years.
Bone pain and osteolytic lesions are rare but hyperviscosity syndrome is common but may not always cause
Fig. 5.9 Red cell rouleaux (stacked cells) are seen
due to the excess high-molecular-weight proteins in
the blood. This is seen in multiple myeloma, as well
as inflammatory conditions, connective tissue
conditions and diabetes.

53

Haematological malignancies
symptoms. Where it does, then hyperviscosity syndrome is treated with plasmaphoresis. Macroglobulin
interferes with platelet function and coagulation factors, resulting in a tendency to bleed. Management is
mainly supportive, but symptomatic patients may
require chemotherapy.

Monoclonal gammopathy
of undetermined significance
Around 3% of people aged over 65 years have low levels
of paraprotein without any symptoms of disease. This
condition is termed monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance (MGUS). There are < 10% plasma cells
in the marrow, no bone lesions, no anaemia and no renal
failure; 10% will progress to myeloma within 10 years.

Amyloidosis
Amyloid is a heterogeneous group of proteins that have
a fibrillar ultrastructure resulting in the formation of bpleated sheets. Examples of amyloid proteins include:
• AA: serum amyloid A (SAA), an acute phase protein
• AL: immunoglobulin light chain or fragments.
In amyloidosis, amyloid is deposited in tissues. This
can be localized or systemic, with renal impairment being
an important problem. Amyloidosis can occur in plasma
cell disorders as well as other unrelated disorders, including chronic inflammatory conditions. Treatment may include chemotherapy and is usually done in collaboration
with the UK National Amyloidosis Centre.

INVESTIGATIONS OF
HAEMATOLOGICAL
MALIGNANCIES

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
and plasma viscosity
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is the rate of fall
of a column of red cells in plasma over 1 hour. The normal range in men is 1–5 mm/hour and in women it is
5–15 mm/hour. ESR is raised with increased plasma
viscosity, which is a more easily automated test. The concentration of proteins (fibrinogen and globulins) in the
plasma is the major determinant of viscosity. ESR and
plasma viscosity are used as indicators of the acute phase
response. ESR is raised in inflammation (including response to infection), malignancy (including myeloma)
and anaemia. It is important to remember that a normal
increase in ESR occurs with age and during pregnancy.

54

Bone marrow investigation
Bone marrow smear
Bone marrow smears allow examination of the stages
of haemopoiesis. Bone marrow smears are usually
stained with Romanowsky dyes, but Perls’ Prussian blue
may be used to detect iron in macrophages and
erythroblasts.

Collection of bone marrow
• Aspiration of bone marrow involves the insertion of
a hollow needle into the iliac crest or more rarely the
sternum. Individual cell detail can be assessed from
aspirates
• Trephine biopsy involves insertion of a large-bore
needle into the iliac crest. A core of bone and marrow is obtained, which is examined as a histological
specimen. These specimens are useful for assessing
marrow architecture and cellularity.

HINTS AND TIPS
Sometimes bone marrow aspiration fails to produce
marrow cells, this is known as a ‘dry tap’. This is not
normally due to poor technique, but is indicative of
certain pathologies in the marrow. These include
chronic myeloid leukaemia, myelofibrosis and
metastatic cancer.

The bone marrow findings in some disorders are
listed in Fig. 5.10.

Lymph node biopsy
Lymph nodes are biopsied for histological examination
when malignancy is suspected.

Cytogenetic analysis
Cytogenetic analysis is the study of structure and function of chromosomes. Certain cytogenetic abnormalities are strongly associated with specific conditions.
Important examples in haematology are:
• t(9;22): this is found mainly in chronic myeloid leukaemia, but also in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia
(the altered chromosome 22 is called the Philadelphia chromosome)
• t(14;18): this is associated with follicular lymphoma
• t(8;14): this is associated with Burkitt’s lymphoma.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the structure and function of platelets, and how they are formed
• Explain different disorders affecting platelets
• Outline the different pathways and substances involved in the coagulation cascade
• Relate the function and disorders of clotting factors
• Discuss different forms of thrombosis and how they arise
• Describe the importance of thromboprophylaxis and methods used to prevent thrombotic disease
• Know how anticoagulants work, including the mechanisms of warfarin and heparin.

Haemostatis is complicated but is based on very simple
principles. Humans have evolved a circulatory system
that transports vital nutrients around the body at high
pressures. If a blood vessel is damaged blood will follow
the pressure gradient and leave the vessel, reducing the
circulating volume and compromising organ perfusion.
We have, therefore, evolved a system, the haemostatic
system, which will attempt to arrest any bleeding as
quickly as possible.
HINTS AND TIPS
A blood clot located where it was formed is called a
thrombus. If it is dislodged and attaches to other vessel
it becomes known as a thromboembolism. The
presence or formation of a thrombus is referred to as
thrombosis.

Three local mechanisms are employed to try to avoid
blood loss:
1. Local neurohumoral factors, such as endothelin released by cells adjacent to the injury, induce transient vasoconstriction. Reducing the flow of blood
minimizes blood loss as well as maximizing interactions between platelets, clotting factors and the vessel wall.
2. Primary haemostasis utilizes circulating platelets to
form an adhesive plug to slow bleeding.
3. Secondary haemostasis (the coagulation cascade)
involves circulating plasma proteins. They produce
a fibrin network that stabilizes the platelets and
traps both red and white blood cells. This stable plug
remains until cellular processes repair the damage.

HINTS AND TIPS
Haemostatic response: the arrest of bleeding, involving
the physiological processes of the contraction of
damaged blood vessels, platelet activation and
adhesion, and coagulation.

PLATELETS AND BLOOD
COAGULATION
Platelets are disc-shaped, non-nucleated, granulecontaining cell fragments with a mean diameter of
2–3 mm (Fig. 6.1). They are formed in the bone marrow
from megakaryocyte cytoplasm. The normal lifespan of
platelets is 7–10 days and at any time up to one-third
are sequestered in the spleen.

Platelet structure and production
The normal discoid circulating shape is maintained by a
band of 10–15 parallel microtubules located around the
circumference. Platelets have two tubular systems: the
dense tubular system and the surface-opening canalicular
system. Platelets contain two types of granule, a and d,
which contain molecules involved in platelet aggregation.
Haemopoietic stem cells differentiate to form megakaryoblasts. Megakaryoblasts mature by endomitosis,
expanding cytoplasmic volume and increasing the number of nuclear lobes without dividing. This forms a polyploid megakaryocyte, which can produce 2000–7000
platelets. Cytoplasmic processes protrude into sinusoids
where they fragment into proplatelets, which then disperse as individual platelets, with the megakaryocyte

glycoprotein binding and platelet activation. Platelet
membrane glycoproteins are essential in mediating platelet interactions with other platelets or subendothelial
connective tissue (Fig. 6.2).
Examples of glycoprotein (GP) binding are as
follows:
• GPIa: binds collagen
• GPIb: exists in complexes with GPV and GPIX and
binds von Willebrand’s factor (vWF). vWF, synthesized by endothelial cells and megakaryocytes, and
also binds exposed subendothelial collagen
• GPIIb/IIIa: binds either vWF or fibrinogen.

staying in the bone marrow. Maturation normally takes
10 days to occur. Platelet production is controlled by:
• Negative feedback: the hormone thrombopoietin
(TPO) increases platelet numbers. It is internalized
by circulating platelets, so the fewer the platelets,
the less internalization and more free TPO.
• Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)—in combination, these stimulate CFU-megakaryocytes (CFU-MK).

Platelet functions
The main functions of platelets are adhesion, release reaction, aggregation, procoagulation and tissue repair.

Adhesion
Normally, endothelial cells of the vessel wall have antiplatelet, anticoagulant and fibrinolytic activity, this is to
minimize clot (thrombus) formation in healthy, undamaged vessels. The antiplatelet activity is mediated by
the production of prostacyclin (PGI2) and nitric oxide
(NO) which both interfere with platelet aggregation
(Fig. 6.2). However, as blood oozes through defective
vessel walls, platelets become exposed to the extracellular
matrix of subendothelial vessel structures. This allows

58

Release reaction
Within 1–2 seconds of adhesion, a monolayer of platelets forms. Platelets change from discs to spheres with
numerous cytoplasmic projections, promoting platelet–platelet interactions. An influx of calcium ions
(Ca2þ) results in the release of the granule contents
through the canalicular system.

Platelet aggregation
Granule contents promote further platelet adhesion and
aggregation:
1. ADP, released from d (dense) granules, alters the
surface configuration of locally circulating platelets,
which promotes aggregation.
2. Subendothelial collagen and thrombin promote ADP
release and thromboxane A2 (TxA2) production,
which potentiate platelet adhesion and aggregation.
3. GPIIb/IIIa, exposed on aggregated platelets, binds
plasma fibrinogen and promotes aggregation with
platelets bound to the subendothelium, vWF and
collagen.
4. These interactions set up a cycle of further platelet
aggregation and release of ADP and TxA2, resulting
in the formation of a platelet plug. This is then
strengthened by the products of the coagulation cascade (below).
Prostacyclin (PGI2), from endothelial cells, inhibits
platelet aggregation and interactions with normal endothelium (Fig. 6.3).
Aggregation is made irreversible by:
• High levels of ADP
• Platelet-release products
• Platelet contractile proteins.
HINTS AND TIPS
As well as potentiating platelet aggregation,
thromboxane A2 is a potent vasoconstrictor.

Procoagulant function
Platelet aggregation rearranges membrane phospholipid,

Tissue repair
Platelets stimulate wound healing through plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), which is mitogenic for
vascular smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts.

HINTS AND TIPS
The bleeding is the time it takes for a small cut to stop
bleeding, representing the formation of a platelet plug.
It is a method of assessing platelet function, and is
increased in patients with platelet disorders. It is rarely
used, and there is controversy regarding its clinical
utility.

ANTIPLATELET DRUGS
Given the important role of platelets in thrombosis,
platelets are the target of certain pharmacological interventions to reduce risk of thrombotic diseases such as
myocardial infarctions and strokes. The mechanisms
of action of some antiplatelet drugs is shown in
Figure 6.4.
Aspirin is a non-specific, irreversible COX (cyclooxygenase) inhibitor. COX enzymes are required to
form TxA2. The effect of aspirin lasts for the life
of that platelet. Aspirin is used for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and has been shown
to be effective in reducing risk. The dose is normally 75 mg. In acute ischaemic events (myocardial
infarction, MI or ischaemic stroke) 300 mg of chewable or dispersible aspirin should be taken as soon as
possible.
Clopidogrel is an ADP receptor antagonist and is
used to prevent further ischaemic events in those who
have suffered vascular events in the past. It is also used
with aspirin in the management of acute coronary

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate
(cAMP) levels in platelets regulate free
intracellular Ca2þ concentrations.
Higher levels of cAMP reduce the
amount of Ca2þ and, therefore, inhibit
adhesion and aggregation. Prostacyclin,
which is derived from arachidonic acid
(AA), is produced by endothelial cells
and potentiates the action of adenylate
cyclase, thus producing more cAMP.
Thromboxane A2 is also derived from
AA and inhibits adenylate cyclase, thus
reducing cAMP levels and encouraging
aggregation. cAMP is broken down by

syndromes. Prasugrel is a new drug that comes from the
same family and appears to achieve greater platelet inhibition. An increased risk of bleeding means that it is reserved for specific situations, such as in patients
undergoing percutaneous transluminal coronary intervention (PTCI).
Dipyridamole is a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It inhibits the breakdown of cAMP to AMP, keeping cAMP
levels high and Ca2þ low. Dipyridamole is often used
in combination with aspirin for treatment following a
stroke or a transient ischaemic attack (TIA).
GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors include the monoclonal antibody abciximab, as well as eptifibatide and tirofiban.
Abciximab is used in high-risk patients undergoing
PTCI. Eptifibatide and tirofiban are used with unfractionated heparin and aspirin to treat early MI. GPIIb/IIIa
inhibitors should only be used by a specialist, as the risk
of severe bleeding is high.

PLATELET DISORDERS
The normal concentration of platelets in blood is 150–
400  109/L. A reduced platelet count (thrombocytopenia) or defects of platelet function can cause bleeding
(Fig. 6.5).

60

Reduced platelet count
(thrombocytopenia)
Decreased platelet production
This is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia.
The causes are listed in Figure 6.6.

Generalized disease of the bone marrow
Decreased megakaryocyte production, and therefore
platelet production, can be part of a wider clinical
picture. Aplastic anaemia is associated with generalized
bone marrow failure. Bone marrow infiltration, e.g. due
to metastatic carcinoma, also reduces the number of
marrow megakaryocytes.

Specific impairment of platelet production
Drugs (thiazide diuretics, ethanol and cytotoxics) can
cause thrombocytopenia by several mechanisms:
• Depressing the whole bone marrow
• Specifically impairing megakaryocyte development
or proliferation.
Viruses can impair platelet production by invading
the megakaryocyte, e.g. measles. HIV precipitates the development of antiplatelet antibodies and suppresses
megakaryocytes, causing thrombocytopenia in 50% of
patients.

Fig. 6.4 The mechanisms of action of
antiplatelet drugs. Platelets are
activated by a number of stimuli
including collagen, thrombin,
thromboxane A2 (TxA2) and adenosine
diphosphate (ADP). Activation of a
platelet stimulates aggregation of
other platelets in three ways. ADP from
d granules is secreted, TxA2 is produced
from arachidonic acid (AA) and GPIIb/
IIIa receptors are expressed. GPIIb/IIIa
is then free to bind fibrinogen,
permitting aggregation with other
platelets. These positive feedback
mechanisms ensure platelets aggregate
to form a platelet plug. Prostacyclin,
derived from vascular endothelial cells,
is the natural inhibitor of platelet
aggregation. It mediates its actions
through increasing cyclic adenosine
monophosphate (cAMP) levels.
Aspirin irreversibly inhibits the
enzyme cyclo-oxygenase (COX)
reducing the production of TxA2.
Clopidogrel is an ADP receptor blocker.
Dipyridamole inhibits the enzyme
phosphodiesterase, which normally
breaks down cAMP. GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors
prevent the platelet from interacting
with fibrinogen and therefore from
aggregating with other platelets.

an infection results in circulation of antibody–viral
antigen complexes. The complexes bind to platelets,
which are then removed by the reticuloendothelial
system. Over 80% of children recover without treatment, but in 5–10% of cases a chronic form of the
disease develops (chronic ITP).
ITP in adults occurs predominantly between the ages
of 15 and 50 years. The incidence is greater in women
than in men. Patients present with petechiae, ecchymoses, epistaxis and menorrhagia. The platelet count can
be very low (< 20  109/L). The onset is usually insidious, with no history of a recent viral infection. Platelets
are bound by IgG autoantibodies to platelet glycoproteins. The IgG–platelet complexes are removed by
splenic macrophages. If complement also binds, destruction mainly occurs in the liver. Adult onset ITP resolves spontaneously less commonly than in children
and is characteristically relapsing and remitting. It can
be seen in conjunction with disorders causing aberrant
immune responses, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Management of ITP is based on suppressing the
immune response to platelets, and includes steroids,
intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) and anti-D
immunoglobulin.
Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is associated
with the transfer of antiplatelet antibodies across the

62

placenta, from the mother to the fetus. The commonest
cause is when the platelets of the fetus express PLA1 (a human platelet antigen) and the mother’s platelets do not.
Post-transfusion purpura occurs if donor platelets,
but not recipient platelets, express the antigen PLA1. Antibodies and thrombocytopenia develop 5–10 days after
a transfusion, although the reason for the destruction of
the recipient’s platelets is unclear.
Drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia occurs via
a variety of mechanisms. The platelet count is often less
than 10  109/L and patients present with acute purpura. Drugs known to induce immune thrombocytopenia, e.g. quinine, should be stopped if the patient
becomes thrombocytopenic.

Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(TTP) and haemolytic-uraemic
syndrome (HUS)
TTP is a rare but serious disorder that most commonly,
affects young adults. It is marked by fever, haemolysis,
transient neurological defects and renal failure. Microthrombi (platelets and fibrin) are deposited in arterioles
and capillaries, causing thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia (erythrocytes fragment as they circulate through the partially occluded
vessels). The aetiology of TTP is usually related to antibodies against the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease ADAMTS-13.
Haemolytic–uraemic syndrome (HUS) is a disorder
similar to TTP that affects infants and young children. However, in HUS the platelet–fibrin microthrombi are limited to the kidneys. In many patients,
the disease follows recent infections with Escherichia coli
(specifically the O157:H7 strain) or other enteric
pathogens.

Dilutional thrombocytopenia
See massive transfusion p. 76

Splenic sequestration
This is seen in hypersplenism (see p.6).

Defects of platelet function
These can be congenital or acquired. Congenital causes
are very rare. The most common cause of acquired
defective platelet function is antiplatelet drug therapy. Aspirin is the most commonly used antiplatelet drug. Uraemia is also associated with reduced platelet function.

The coagulation cascade

THE COAGULATION CASCADE
HINTS AND TIPS
Clotting factors are usually referred to by Roman
numerals. However, some are referred to by other
names, e.g. factor II is called (pro) thrombin. Activated
factors have the suffix ’a’.

The coagulation pathways
Once a platelet plug has been formed (primary haemostasis) the plug is strengthened by the products of
the coagulation pathway (secondary haemostasis).
This pathway involves a cascade of protein activation
leading to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. The
proteins involved are known as clotting or coagulation
factors. Coagulation can be initiated from within the
circulation (intrinsic) or outside the circulation
(extrinsic). An overview of the coagulation pathway is
shown in Figure 6.8.
The coagulation cascade is an amplification system
that generates thrombin. Thrombin converts fibrinogen
into fibrin and therefore stabilizes the clot. The factors
required for coagulation are normally found in the
circulation as proenzymes or cofactors.

6

The enzymes, except factor (F) XIII, are serine
proteases that hydrolyse peptide bonds, amplifying the
response. The coagulation factors adhere to activated
platelets, e.g. the primary platelet plug. The platelet surface functions as a catalytic membrane for complexes
of coagulation factors and is essential for the speed and
magnitude of the secondary coagulation response.

The extrinsic pathway
The secondary haemostatic response is initiated by tissue
factor (TF), a glycoprotein expressed on the subendothelium of damaged vessels and the surface of non-vascular
cells, such as monocytes, after tissue injury or inflammation. The activation of the coagulation cascade by TF is
known as the ’extrinsic’ pathway because the circulation
is not normally exposed to TF. TF activates, and then
forms a complex with FVIIa (as well as calcium ions),
to produce a complex that activates both FX and FIX.
In the presence of the cofactor FVa and calcium ions,
FXa forms the ’prothrombinase’ complex which activates
prothrombin (FII), converting it to thrombin (FIIa).
Thrombin has many functions, including:
•

Haemostasis

Prothrombin time (PT) is used to test the extrinsic
pathway. Tissue thromboplastin and calcium are added
to citrated plasma. A normal PT is 10–14 seconds.
When monitoring warfarin therapy the value is
normally given as an international normalized ratio
(INR) which is the PT ratio, corrected for the variability
between laboratories. Activated partial thromboplastin
time (APPT) measures the intrinsic pathway.
Phospholipid, a surface activator, and calcium are
added to citrated plasma. A normal value is 30–40
seconds.

FXa

The ’intrinsic’ pathway begins entirely within the circulation. It starts when FXII comes into contact with a negatively charged surface, such as a negatively charged
platelet, and is then activated. FXIIa activates FXI. FXIa
converts FIX to FIXa, which in turn cleaves FVIII into
FVIIIa. Some downstream products such as FXa and FIIa
amplify this process. The result of the instrinsic pathway
is the production the trimolecular complex of FIXa,
FVIIIa and calcium ions. This complex is a very potent
activator of FX, and is known as ’tenase’. The common
pathway then follows, resulting in fibrin formation.

Prothrombin

The final step of the secondary coagulation process is
the degradation of the plasma protein fibrinogen into
small fibrin monomers. These fibrin monomers polymerize spontaneously, by hydrogen bonds, to form
long fibres and subsequent complex networks around
the primary platelet plug. FXIIIa further stabilizes the
clot by forming covalent cross-links between the fibrin
polymers.

and FX. The activated platelet membrane then provides
the catalysts for the efficient conversion of prothrombin
to thrombin by FXa on its own. If the trigger is sufficient
and enough thrombin is formed it converts FV, FVIII,
and FXI to their active forms, By this time very little
thrombin has been produced.
The reactions associated with the propagation step
occur on the surfaces of activated platelets. FIXa binds
to the newly formed FVIIIa forming the tenase complex
(FIXa-FVIIIa-Ca2þ). This complex is a much more potent activator of FX than the TF-FVIIa complex. This
new FXa can then form the prothrombinase complex
(FXa-FVa-Ca2þ) which is 300,000 times more potent
at converting prothrombin to thrombin than FXa
alone.

Initiation and propagation
The cascades, as explained above, have been the accepted interpretations of the clotting system for decades. However, as can be appreciated from these
theories, certain clotting factors are important for their
own production; the most obvious one being thrombin. Thrombin acts in reactions that are above itself
in the cascade, making the cascade approach seem redundant. The more recent interpretation of coagulation sees the two ’separate’ cascades as being closely
linked in two phases:
• Initiation
• Propagation.
Initiation begins with TF binding to activated FVIIa
(see Fig. 6.9). The FVIIa-TF complex activates both FIX

64

Regulatory pathways
A complex regulatory system limits the positive feedback mechanisms and prevents extension of coagulation outside the site of injury. During the initiation
step tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) can bind
FXa preventing the initial production of thrombin.
The TFPI-FXa complex then inhibits TF-FVIIa complex
bringing the initiation step to a halt.

Proteins C and S
During the propagation step the activated protein C
pathway is the main form of natural anticoagulation.
Protein C is a serine protease that destroys the

activated cofactors Va and VIIIa. It also enhances fibrinolysis by inhibiting tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI). Protein C is activated when thrombin
binds to thrombomodulin on the surface of endothelial
cells. Protein S is a cofactor for protein C (Fig. 6.10).
Both proteins C and S are dependent on vitamin K
(see Fig. 6.11).

Antithrombin
Antithrombin (sometimes still called its former name,
antithrombin III) is a potent inhibitor of thrombin,
FIXa, FXa and FXIIa. AT binds to the serine residue in
the active site of these factors. The inhibitory effect of
AT is potentiated by heparin.

Role of vitamin K
Factors II, VII, IX and X undergo post-translational
g-carboxylation of glutamic acid residues. The modification of these factors allows them to bind calcium ions
and platelet phospholipid membranes. The process,
outlined in Figure 6.11, requires vitamin K as a cofactor.
Vitamin K is fat soluble and deficiency is often a result of
malabsorption. A large proportion of our vitamin K is
liberated from our foods by commensal bacteria in

Adequate levels of calcium are needed to allow clotting,
by activating the vitamin-K-dependent factors. Reducing calcium within the test tube can prevent coagulation
of blood samples. This is done by:
• Citrate ! deionizes calcium
• Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) ! precipitates calcium.

Fibrinolysis
In blood, the fibrinolytic system breaks down excessive
thrombus formation in the lumen of the vessels, thus preventing luminal occlusion. Plasminogen is activated, by
cleaving an arginine–valine bond, to form plasmin. Activation can be intrinsic or extrinsic, by non-human agents,
e.g. tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and by urokinase.
Thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor, plasminogen
activator inhibitor, a2-antiplasmin, closely regulate
fibrinolysis.

Tissue plasminogen activator
tPA is released from activated endothelial cells and is the
most important activator of fibrinolysis. It binds to and
activates fibrin-bound plasminogen. This ensures that
plasmin production is localized to the thrombus.

Plasmin
Plasmin cleaves peptide bonds in fibrin to produce degradation products of various sizes. Small fragments, termed
’D’ fragments, are produced following thrombin

Haemostasis
generation and activation of FXIII. They are present in
large quantities in conditions such as disseminated intravascular coagulation. D-dimers can be detected in the
plasma or urine. A D-dimer assay is used as a test of exclusion when investigating ’low-risk’ venous thromboembolism (VTE).

CLOTTING TESTS
Prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT) and thrombin time are tests of the function of the coagulation cascade. A summary of their
normal range and the causes of abnormal results are
shown in Figure 6.12.
The thrombin time is sometimes used. It is affected
by heparin therapy and disseminated intravascular
coagulation (DIC). The normal range is 10–12 seconds.
Specific factor assays can be used to identify deficiencies of single coagulation factors. This is of relevance to
haemophilia when an assay can indicate the level of factor in the blood and, therefore, the severity of disease.
Fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) are used to
identify clots, e.g. post-deep vein thrombosis (DVT)/
disseminated intravascular coagulation. Most laboratories nowadays report these as D-dimers which is one
way of measuring FDPs.

Prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APPT)
with a normal prothrombin time (PT) is found in:
• Lupus anticoagulant
• Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII.
Prolonged PT with a normal APPT is found in:
• Factor VI deficiency
• Liver disease
• Warfarin (at therapeutic dose).

Overview of haemostasis
The role of platelets, the clotting cascade and fibrinolysis in haemostasis are outlined in Fig 6.13.
HINTS AND TIPS
Bleeding disorders that result from a clotting defect or
thrombocytopenia can be distinguished by their clinical
features. Patients with haemophilia present with bleeding
deep in tissues (e.g. bleeding into muscles and joints)
whereas patients with thrombocytopenia present with
superficial bleeding into the skin or mucous membranes.

Hereditary factor abnormalities
von Willebrand’s disease
von Willebrand’s disease, a deficiency or defect in von
Willebrand’s factor (vWF), is the most common hereditary bleeding disorder, affecting perhaps as many as
1% of the population. vWF is the carrier protein for FVIII
in plasma, and stabilizes it, prolonging its survival in the
circulation. It also promotes platelet interactions with the
endothelium. There are three main types of the disease.
Type 1 is the most common form of the disease. Impaired release of normally synthesized vWF multimers
from endothelial cells leads to a deficiency of vWF. This
can be partially corrected by an infusion of arginine
vasopressin (DDAVP).
Types 2 and 3 cause more severe disease and are managed in specialist centres. The first line treatment for
types 2 and 3 is FVIII-vWF concentrate.

Haemophilia A
Haemophilia A is caused by a deficiency of FVIII. The
prevalence of haemophilia A in males is 1 in 5000
and is not affected by geographic, ethnic or religious

association, or by social class. Haemophilia A is an
X-linked recessive condition, therefore overwhelmingly
affecting males. In 33% of all haemophilia A cases, patients have no family history of the disease and such
cases are thought to arise from spontaneous mutation
of the FVIII gene. The frequency and severity of bleeding
correlates with the plasma level of FVIII. Haemophilia A
can be classified as severe, moderate or mild (Fig. 6.14)
with severe disease accounting for  70% of haemophilic patients.

The most common clinical feature of haemophilia is
bleeding into joints (haemarthrosis); muscular bleeding is
the next most common and together they make up 95%
of how patients with severe haemophilia present. Other
possible presenting symptoms include nose bleeds, GI
bleeding, haematuria and prolonged bleeding following
surgery or dental extraction.
Some of the most serious consequences of bleeds
include:
• Chronic damage: fixed flexion deformities of the
limbs with muscle atrophy, neurological damage,
degenerative joint disease
• Acute problems: compartment syndrome,
compression of the respiratory tract, massive loss of
circulating volume and intracranial haemorrhage.

Factor replacement therapy
Factor VIII can be replaced with:
– Recombinant FVIII (preferred)
– Plasma-derived FVIII concentrates (no longer
recommended in the UK)
– Cryoprecipitate (used where FVIII concentrates are
not available).
During acute bleeding episodes patients should administer their own FVIII and be transferred to hospital,
if necessary. FVIII activity should be corrected to
100% for ’severe’ bleeds. ’Minor’ bleeds, such as

67

Haemostasis
haemarthroses, oral mucosal and muscular, should be
corrected to 30–50%. Desmopressin and aminocaproic
acid can be used to enhance FVIII activity. Prophylactic
treatment with FVIII is currently recommended in children with severe haemophilia.
There is a risk of iatrogenic infections from all
blood products. Haemophiliacs, prior to the availability
of recombinant products, were exposed to blood
products from many donors (pooled plasma is used
to concentrate FVIII) on numerous occasions each year
(average 31 bleeding episodes per year). Over 50% of
haemophiliacs in the USA and Europe contracted HIV
from infected blood products before screening for HIV
was introduced. Even more contracted hepatitis C. AIDS
has been a common cause of death in haemophiliacs,
with many also developing chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. In the UK the recombinant product is recommended.

Other deficiencies
Hereditary deficiencies of the other coagulation factors
are rare. In specific areas, the prevalence of a certain coagulation factor deficiency can be much higher than average. Examples of this are a high prevalence of FVII
deficiency in Northern Italy and a high prevalence of
FXI deficiency among Ashkenazi Jews.
Figure 6.15 shows a summary of hereditary factor
deficiencies.

Acquired factor abnormalities
Vitamin K deficiency
Vitamin K deficiency can occur as a result of malabsorption and broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

Liver disease

Haemophilia B
Haemophilia B (Christmas disease), caused by a deficiency of FIX, is also X-linked. Haemophilia A and B
can be differentiated only by specific coagulation factor
assays. Haemophilia B has an identical pattern of clinical
features to haemophilia A, but is five times less common.
Treatment is similar to that for haemophilia A, but with
FIX replacement rather than FVIII. FIX has a longer halflife than FVIII and therefore fewer infusions are required.
HINTS AND TIPS
A normal prothrombin time (PT) with an abnormal
activated partial thromboplastin times (APPT) is
suggestive of haemophilia in a patient presenting with
bleeding.

The liver produces all the clotting factors except for vWF;
liver disease is, therefore, associated with clotting factor
deficiency. In addition, biliary obstruction can lead to
malabsorption and deficiency of fat-soluble vitamin K.
This leads to decreased synthesis of the vitamin-Kdependent factors. Portal hypertension can lead to splenomegaly, resulting in increased splenic sequestration of
platelets. In severe liver disease, levels of FV and fibrinogen
are reduced, and increased levels of plasminogen activator
are present. An acquired dysfibrinogenaemia (functional
abnormality of fibrinogen) is also seen in many patients.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation
DIC is a dangerous condition that arises from excessive
activation of the coagulation cascade, followed by activation of the fibrinolytic system. Thus, patients can

Thrombosis
suffer from thromboses and bleeding simultaneously.
Coagulation is activated in two ways:
1. Release of tissue factor from damaged tissues,
monocytes or red blood cells
2. Activation of factors XI and XII by endothelial cell
dysfunction.
There is generalized fibrin deposition on vascular endothelium, with extensive consumption of platelets and
coagulation factors. Small vessels are obstructed, leading to tissue damage and multiple organ dysfunction.
Fibrin deposition activates the fibrinolytic pathway
and results in the formation of fibrin degradation products (FDPs). FDPs inhibit fibrin polymerization and, consequently, impair coagulation. The net result is a bleeding
disorder due to a lack of platelets and clotting factors, and
inhibition of fibrin polymerization by FDPs. In DIC, PT,
APTT and thrombin clotting times can all be prolonged,
while platelet counts and fibrinogen levels are low.
Causes of DIC include:
• Acute: obstetric complications, septicaemia, trauma,
massive blood loss
• Chronic: liver disease, malignancy.
The management of DIC involves treatment of the
underlying disorder and supportive care with transfusion of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelets.
Heparin, activated protein C and antifibrinolytics, such
as aminocaproic acid, may also have a role. DIC is immensely dangerous and requires specialist intervention.

THROMBOSIS
HINTS AND TIPS
Virchow’s triad outlines the factors that predispose to
thrombus formation:
• Changes in blood flow
• Changes in blood constituents
• Changes within the walls of blood vessels.

Thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot
(thrombus) in the circulation; an embolism is the
occlusion of a vessel by foreign material or a blood clot
(thromboembolism) which has moved from its
starting position.
Thrombosis can occur in the arterial or venous circulation. Both may be serious, and even fatal, if the clot
embolizes to important organs. Arterial thromboembolism (ATE) is the leading cause of death in developed
nations, as it is the most common aetiological factor behind both myocardial infarctions (MI) and cerebrovascular accidents (CVA). Venous thromboemolism (VTE)
can occur throughout the venous circulation, but most

6

commonly occurs in the lower limbs, for example a DVT
in the deep veins of the leg. Axillary vein thrombosis is
rare, and tends to affect young, active men. The most
serious complication of venous clots is embolization
to the pulmonary vasculature, creating a pulmonary
embolism (PE).
Virchow’s triad provides a framework to think about
the risk factors for VTE formation.

Changes in blood flow
Normally blood flow is smooth (laminar). If the blood
flow becomes turbulent or if there is any stasis of blood
there is a risk that the clotting system will be activated,
and clots formed. Atrial fibrillation and mechanical
heart valves carry an increased risk of ATE and so patients with either of these are usually anticoagulated.
The calf muscles of the leg normally act as a second
heart, pumping venous blood against gravity back to
the heart. During periods of immobility this pumping
action is lost and stasis of blood occurs, increasing the
risk of VTE.

Changes within the walls
of blood vessels
Factors such as smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, hypertension, infection and immune-mediated damage contribute to endothelial injury and subsequent thrombus
formation.

Changes in blood constituents
(hypercoagulability)
Alterations to the normal blood constituents can result
in a propensity to form clots.
Thrombophilias are disorders of haemostasis that
increase the tendency of blood to clot. These may be
inherited or acquired.

Primary (hereditary) thrombophilia
Activated protein C resistance due to factor V Leiden
A missense mutation of the FV gene (arginine is replaced
by glutamine) renders FV ten times less sensitive to inactivation by activated protein C. This disorder has an
incidence in Caucasians in the UK of 5% and might account for the majority of cases of inherited thrombophilia. This mutation acts as a cofactor in the following
hypercoagulable states:
• Oral contraceptive pill and pregnancy
• Surgery and immobility
• Other thrombophilia disorders.

69

Haemostasis
Antithrombin deficiency
AT deficiency is an autosomal dominant condition
affecting 1 in 2000 people. The deficiency is either:
• Type I (decreased quantity), or
• Type II (reduced biological activity).
Heterozygotes have 40–50% of normal plasma AT
levels; homozygosity is lethal. Most patients with AT
deficiency experience a thrombotic episode before
the age of 50 years. Thrombosis might be severe and
recurrent and these patients might have to have their
blood anticoagulated with warfarin long term (see
also p. 71).

Deficiencies of proteins C and S
Inheritance for both protein C and protein S deficiencies is autosomal dominant. Protein S deficiency is clinically indistinguishable from protein C deficiency. As
with AT deficiency, they can be type I (decreased quantity) or type II (reduced biological activity). Heterozygotes have 50% of normal levels of protein C or S.
Clinical features are similar to AT deficiency, but the
thrombotic risk is four times lower. Homozygous protein C deficiency has been described where individuals
have less than 1% of normal levels of protein C and
have very severe disease, often presenting with problems
at birth.

Defective fibrinolysis
Abnormal plasminogen and fibrinogen have been associated with reduced fibrinolytic activity and a tendency
of blood to clot.

Prothrombin allele G20210A
Between 2% and 3% of the population have this prothrombin variant, which increases prothrombin levels
and the thrombotic risk.

Hyperhomocysteinaemia
High levels of plasma homocysteine increase the risk of
venous and arterial thrombosis.

Secondary (acquired) thrombophilia
The following conditions are associated with an increased incidence of thrombosis:
• Prolonged immobilization of the patient (venous
stasis)
• Disseminated cancer (secretion of tumour substances that activate FX)
• Oestrogen therapy (increased plasma levels of factors
II, VII, IX and X, and reduced levels of AT and tPA)
• Myeloproliferative disorders
• Sickle-cell anaemia
• The antiphospholipid antibody syndrome (lupus anticoagulant syndrome). This disorder is characterized

70

by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies in association with a clinical event. The main features of
this syndrome are arterial or venous thrombosis or
complications in pregnancy such as recurrent miscarriage. The disease can be idiopathic or secondary to
other autoimmune disorders such as SLE.
Venous thromboembolism (VTE)
Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurs most commonly in
the lower limbs. Symptoms and signs include:
• Swelling (usually asymmetrical)
• Pain (especially on dorsiflexion)
• Erythema.
If part of a DVT dislodges to form an embolus, this
can lodge in the vasculature of the lung, a so-called
pulmonary embolism (PE). PE can present most
severely as collapse but symptoms often include:
• Dyspnoea
• Tachypnoea
• Pleuritic chest pain.
Well’s criteria are used to evaluate the probability of
VTE. A normal D-dimer level is useful to exclude VTE
but may be raised in many conditions. Doppler
ultrasound is used to diagnose thrombosis and a V/Q
scan or spiral CT for PE.

Anticoagulation
The main use of anticoagulants is to prevent unwanted
thrombus formation or extension. They act on the clotting cascade to prevent fibrin formation. Anticoagulants
do not prevent platelet plug formation, nor do they
break down those which are already formed.
There are two commonly used anticoagulants: heparin and warfarin. A summary of the attributes of heparin
and warfarin is given in Figure 6.16.
The type of anticoagulant and the duration of its use
will depend on the indication for treatment. Indications
for anticoagulation therapy include:
• Prophylaxis: mechanical prosthetic heart valves,
atrial fibrillation, following surgery, unstable angina
• Post-thromboembolic event: DVT, PE, acute peripheral arterial occlusion, management of MI
• During therapeutic procedures: cardiopulmonary
bypass, haemodialysis.
The danger of using anticoagulants is the risk of haemorrhage. Patients already at risk of bleeding, e.g. those
with peptic ulcers, oesophageal varices or severe hypertension, are contraindicated for anticoagulation. People
given anticoagulants should be monitored closely to ensure the correct dose is being administered.

HINTS AND TIPS

Warfarin is a vitamin K antagonist and will, therefore,
reduce the activity of vitamin-K-dependent factors. It affects the factors in the order VII, IX, X and II due to their
half-lives. Proteins C and S are also inactivated by warfarin. This occurs before thrombin inactivation causing
a relative deficiency in proteins C and S, which can lead
to skin necrosis due to extensive thrombosis of the microvasculature within the subcutaneous fat. Because
warfarin acts primarily on the extrinsic pathway, the
prothrombin time is used to monitor the effect on clotting (given as INR). The target INR for different indications is given in Figure 6.17.

Fig. 6.17 Target international normalized ratio (INR) for
different indications of warfarin therapy

The international normalized ratio (INR) is the patient’s
prothrombin time (PT) divided by the normal PT, with a
correction factor for reagent and instrument variability.
The normal range for the INR is between 0.8 and 1.2.
A high INR signifies a longer PT, and therefore greater
bleeding risk.

Care must be taken when using warfarin. It is teratogenic and, therefore, should not be used in early pregnancy (heparin does not cross the placenta and so can
be used in pregnancy). Warfarin interacts with many
drugs. Common interactions are shown in Figure 6.18.
Warfarin is potentiated in liver disease. Because warfarin has a half-life of 40 hours, the effects of changes in
dose can take 4–5 days to become evident. If there is a
warfarin overdose, i.e. the INR exceeds 4.5, warfarin
should be stopped for 1 or 2 days and recommenced

at a lower dose. The specific antidote to warfarin is
vitamin K, which can be administered orally or
intravenously. If the overdose has resulted in severe
bleeding, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC)
should be used.

Heparin
Heparin is a glycosaminoglycan that potentiates the actions of AT. Standard (unfractionated) heparin contains
molecules ranging in weight from 5000 to 30,000 kDa.
The different chain lengths affect both activity and clearance, with the larger molecules being cleared more
quickly. The activated partial thromboplastin time
(APTT) is used to monitor unfractionated heparin therapy. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has a
mean molecular weight of 5000 kDa. LMWH is monitored only in renal failure and pregnancy. Monitoring
is with an anti-Xa assay. LMWH differs from standard
heparin because:

and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which
is a rare but serious problem. The risk of complications
is less for LMWH than for unfractionated heparin.

Thromboprophylaxis
Hospital inpatients and patients undergoing surgery
(especially obstetric and orthopaedic) are at a higher
risk of VTE. Hospitals now require a VTE assessment
of all inpatients, taking into account mobility and
comorbidities. Strategies to prevent VTEs include good
hydration, early mobilization, compression stockings
and LMWH.

Therapeutic fibrinolysis

• It has greater activity against FXa than thrombin
• It has reduced protein binding and clearance
• Interactions with platelets are reduced.

If a clot does occur fibrinolytic agents can be used. Fibrinolytics are used in a life-threatening VTE, PE, MI and
CVA. They attempt to restore blood supply to an area
of the circulation that has been occluded by a fibrin clot.
There are different fibrinolytic agents available:

LMWHs are commonly used, as subcutaneous injection, in the acute management of DVT and PE. Warfarin
therapy is often started within 2 days and heparin
stopped when the INR is > 2.0. LMWH is the anticoagulant of choice for prophylaxis against venous thrombosis following surgery and is increasingly used as a
prophylactic against DVT in non-surgical patients.
Long-term unfractionated heparin therapy can result
in osteoporosis. Other complications include bleeding

• Streptokinase: derived from group A b-haemolytic
streptococci. It binds to plasminogen to form a complex that can activate other plasminogen molecules.
It is highly antigenic
• Urokinase: derived from human kidney cells. It is a
tPA originally isolated in urine
• Recombinant tPA: synthesized from human cells. It
is highly specific for plasminogen and has a short
half-life of 2–6 minutes.

• Describe what a blood transfusion is, and how and when different blood products are used
• Discuss the principles of ABO and rhesus antigens
• Explain the process of cross-matching and its importance
• Understand the dangers involved in blood transfusion.

INTRODUCTION IN BLOOD
PRODUCTS
In the UK, donated blood comes from healthy volunteers between the ages of 17 and 65 (for the first donation). All donors must fill out a health questionnaire to
reduce the transmission of infections. The health questionnaire includes questions about their medical history, previous blood transfusions, travel history and
past behaviour associated with serious sexually transmitted infections. If a patient is deemed fit to donate,
they normally have 470 mL of whole blood taken from
a large vein in the antecubital fossa of the arm. The
whole process normally takes less than 30 minutes. Donors have to wait 16 weeks before donating blood again.
Whole blood is very rarely given to patients. It is reserved for complex cases, and is only available if it is prearranged with the local transfusion centre. Instead,
blood products are used. These include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Packed red cells
Platelets
Fresh frozen plasma
Individual clotting factors
Cryoprecipitate
Albumin.

The term blood transfusion almost always indicates a
transfusion of red cells.

HINTS AND TIPS
Red cells are separated from plasma and platelets and
‘packed’ with saline-adenine-glucose-mannitol
(SAGM) solution. These packed red cells have a shelflife of around 35 days.

Some individuals do not wish to receive another person’s blood, either as a result of religious beliefs or because they wish to avoid the risks associated with blood
transfusion. The alternatives to blood transfusion
include:
• Volume expanders: used in the acute setting to avoid
the onset of shock
• Growth factors (EPO): are not used in the acute situation; they work by stimulating the bone marrow
to produce more red blood cells (RBCs)
• Intraoperative blood salvage: blood lost during surgery is collected and reinfused into the patient
• Autologous blood donation: an individual donates
their own blood that can be saved and infused back
into the individual should they need it. This has
been used for fit patients having planned surgery.
Cheating athletes sometimes use this to aid their performance, a process called blood doping, as it is hard
to test for
• Synthetic blood substitutes: have not yet been fully
achieved; haemoglobin-based oxygen carriers and
perfluorochemical compounds can perform some
red cell function, but nothing has been developed
yet to fully replace blood.
The main concern when administering a blood transfusion is the avoidance of an adverse immunological

73

Blood transfusion
reaction as a result of an incompatibility between donor
and recipient blood. Adverse immunological reactions
occur because there are a variety of antigens on the surface of red cells. Thus, when an individual is exposed to
red blood cells with different antigens (to which they are
therefore not self-tolerant), they are attacked by the
immune system. The resultant reactions can be severe
and life-threatening.

RED-CELL ANTIGENS
The surfaces of red cells are covered with antigenic molecules. Over 400 different groups of antigens have been
identified, although only some of these are clinically
important in blood transfusion.

ABO antigens
The ABO system consists of three allelic genes, A, B and
O, which code for sugar-residue transferase enzymes.
The ABO antigen, known as the H antigen, is a glycoprotein or glycolipid with a terminal L-fructose:
• The O gene is amorphous, i.e. it has no effect on
antigenic structure and leaves antigen H unchanged
• The group A gene product adds N-acetyl galactosamine to the H antigen
• The group B gene product adds the sugar D-galactose.
The ABO gene has three alleles, corresponding to the
three antigens. Genes coding for A and B antigens are
both co-dominant. Inheritance of the three ABO alleles
can lead to six different genotypes and four possible
phenotypes (Fig. 7.1).
By 6 months of age, the immune system will have
been exposed to A- and B-like antigens in intestinal bacteria and food substances. IgM antibodies develop
against A and/or B antigens, unless these antigens are present on red cells (self-tolerance). Therefore, individuals
with neither A or B red-cell antigens (group O) will have
both anti-A and anti-B antibodies. Those with both A and
B red-cell antigens (group AB) will have neither antibody.

Transfused blood must be ABO-compatible with the
recipient’s blood, otherwise recipient antibody will
cause agglutination and haemolysis of the transfused
cells. For example, if group A red cells are given to a
group O recipient, anti-A antibodies in the recipient’s
serum will destroy the donor cells.
Ideally, ABO-identical blood is used; however, if this
is not possible, compatible blood can be used. Blood
cells of group O are not affected by anti-A or anti-B antibodies and can, therefore, be given to patients of any
blood group. Consequently, blood group O is referred
to as the universal donor, although it should be borne
in mind that the serum of individuals with group O
blood will contain anti-A and anti-B antibodies. It is
always more desirable to use group-specific red cells
for transfusion. Conversely, AB individuals are universal
recipients because they do not possess anti-ABO antibodies and can receive blood of any ABO type.

Rhesus antigens
Rhesus (Rh) antigens are stronger immunogens and the
antibodies generated are clinically important.
They are known as C, D and E, but the D antigen is the
most important clinically; it is the D antigen that is referred
to when describing someone as ‘rhesus positive’ or ‘rhesus
negative’. D antigen is the strongest immunogen.
The D antigen is coded for by the RhD gene. The presence of just one RhD allele (written as ‘D’) results in the
D antigen being present. The lack of a RhD gene is written as ‘d’. Thus, Rh positive individuals are DD or Dd,
Rh negative individuals are dd. Approximately 85% of
Caucasians are Rh positive and 15% are Rh negative. Interestingly, only 1% of individuals from Asia, and even
fewer people of African origin, are Rh negative.
Anti-D antibodies are only generated when a Rh
negative individual is exposed to Rh positive red cells
following transfusion or pregnancy. All anti-D antibodies are IgG. Approximately 70% of Rh negative individuals produce anti-D antibodies after receiving Rh
positive blood and they will develop transfusion reactions when re-transfused with Rh positive blood. As well
as D positive individuals, those with C, c and E antigens
may have a haemolytic reaction after transfusion, which
is usually delayed rather than immediate.

RhD haemolytic disease of the newborn
If blood from a Rh positive fetus enters the circulation of
an Rh negative mother, alloimmunization can occur.
Small amounts of fetal blood are transferred during
the third trimester and at birth. Mothers develop antiD IgG antibodies, which cross the placenta into the fetal
circulation during the course of the second pregnancy. If
the second fetus is Rh positive, the IgG antibodies

Cross-matching and blood transfusion
induce immune haemolysis of fetal red cells, which can
result in hydrops fetalis.

Prevention of RhD haemolytic disease
of the newborn
Passive immunization is used to prevent maternal antiD antibody production. Therefore, all Rh negative pregnant women are given an intramuscular injection of
anti-D IgG at 28 weeks’ gestation (and sometimes 34
weeks depending on the preparation). If a Rh negative
mother gives birth to a Rh positive child she should
recieve another dose within 72 hours of the birth. The
injected antibody coats Rh positive fetal red blood cells,
which are removed by the reticuloendothelial system
(RES) before the mother produces her own anti-D antibodies. Anti-D antibody should also be given to Rh negative mothers after all ‘sensitising events’, including
abortions, ectopic pregnancies and amniocentesis.
HINTS AND TIPS
Red-cell antigens other than rhesus D, such as C, Kell
and ABO incompatibility, can also cause haemolytic
disease of the newborn. ABO incompatibility may lead
to anaemia and jaundice in the newborn. It is usually
short-lived and rarely requires therapy.

Other red-cell antigens

•

CROSS-MATCHING AND BLOOD
TRANSFUSION

Cross-matching blood
It is important to correctly identify the patient and to
label samples accurately before blood transfusions
to prevent potentially fatal transfusion reactions.
Cross-matching has three stages:
1. Blood grouping (ABO and Rh) of the recipient
2. Screening for abnormal recipient antibodies
– Indirect antiglobulin test: the recipient’s serum is
tested against a standard pool of red cells to detect

7

antibodies to blood group antigens other than
those of the ABO and Rh systems
– Screening cells and cell panels (to identify the antigen against which the antibody is reacting)
3. Each unit of donor blood to be transfused is then
tested against the patient’s serum to identify atypical
antibodies in the patient. This then makes that unit
of donor blood unusable by other patients.
Cross-matching normally takes under an hour but
can take longer if antibodies are present. Most hospitals
will only hold cross-matched blood for 24 hours.
Another pre-transfusion test is called ‘group and
save’. This is used when blood is not needed immediately but may be needed in the near future. It involves
testing the patient’s sample and storing it for 7 days.
If, in that period, the patient needs a transfusion compatible blood can be provided within 15 minutes.

Emergency transfusions
During emergency situations patients often have not
had a cross-match sample taken. If a patient needs
blood immediately a cross-match sample should be
taken and O negative blood given. There are exceptionally rare circumstances, including the management of
neonatal emergencies, where whole blood is preferable.

Filtering and warming at transfusion
Blood giving sets with filters are no longer an absolute
requirement for leucodepletion as donor blood is leucodepleted at the transfusion centre; however, filters are
still used to help avoid contamination. Blood is warmed
when it is rapidly transfused to prevent vasoconstriction, which would reduce the rate of transfusion.

Dangers in the use
of blood products
Transfusion reaction
Transfusion reactions occur when incompatible blood
is transfused. A summary of the complications of blood
transfusions is given in Figure 7.2.
HINTS AND TIPS
The most common reason for severe complications is
clerical error. Therefore, the utmost care must be taken
when checking the details of the patient and the blood
product. At least two healthcare professionals should
check the details at the bedside.

Haemolytic transfusion reactions
The most severe transfusion reaction, acute haemolysis,
is caused by the destruction of donor red blood cells by
antibodies (IgG or IgM) present in the recipient’s serum.
Haemolysis caused by IgM occurs immediately, reactions caused by IgG are delayed:
• Extravascular haemolysis results from incompatibilities of blood groups that produce IgG antibodies,
e.g. Rh, Kell, Duffy and Kidd. Antibody-coated red
blood cells are then removed by the RES
• ABO incompatibility (usually due to a clerical error)
causes intravascular haemolysis when IgM antibodies fix complement. Activation of complement
generates C3a and C5a, which cause vasodilatation,
increased vascular permeability and neutrophil
chemotaxis.
Haemolytic transfusion reaction
Haemolytic transfusion reactions are the most serious
complication of blood transfusion and usually occur as
a result of ABO incompatibility. Intravascular
haemolysis occurs through the activation of
complement with IgM, causing symptoms of:
• Dyspnoea
• Rigors
• Lumbar pain
• Flushing
• Urticaria
• Headache.
If blood is noticed in the urine, kidney failure is of
immediate concern.

76

Release of vasoactive substances causes
profound hypotension and shock, and renal tubular
necrosis can cause acute renal failure. Release of
tissue thromboplastin from lysed red cells can
lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC). Death occurs in 15% of cases of ABO
incompatibility and usually results from severe DIC
or renal failure.
Extravascular haemolysis, mediated by IgG, occurs
more slowly and is less severe.

Blood products and infection risk
Infections have been transmitted in blood products. To
minimize infection risk, donor blood is screened for
several infective agents including syphilis, hepatitis B
and C, and HIV.
Detection techniques are not foolproof. For example,
HIV is detected by the presence of antibodies in donor
blood. HIV has been transmitted in blood products
from donors who had not seroconverted at the time
of donation. Blood is taken aseptically and is then leucodepleted to reduce the risk of transmission.
There is concern about the transmission of variant
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (vCJD), with reported cases
of presumed transmission of vCJD in blood products.
For this reason British plasma is no longer used in the
treatment of congenital bleeding disorders.

Iron overload
The levels of iron in the body are usually controlled by
the regulation of absorption. There are no physiological
mechanisms to eliminate iron from the body. When
people receive multiple blood transfusions, the excess
iron is deposited in, and causes damage to, the heart,
liver and endocrine organs. Iron-chelating agents, such
as desferrioxamine and deferiprone, facilitate iron
excretion.
HINTS AND TIPS
Massive transfusions are not firmly defined but one
common definition is:
• Transfusing more than a patient’s entire blood
volume (or more than 10 units of red cells) in 24
hours.
As packed red cells are deficient in platelets and
clotting factors V and VIII, massive transfusions can
result in coagulopathies. These patients need platelets
and fresh frozen plasma. Massive transfusions can also
result in acidosis and hypothermia.

Cross-matching and blood transfusion

Other blood products
Platelets
Platelets are stored at room temperature (on an oscillating tray to prevent clumping) and have a half-life of 4–5
days. They can be obtained from a pool of 6–10 blood
donors or from a single donor via apheresis. Indications
for platelet transfusion include:
• Patients who are bleeding and who have a platelet
count < 50  109/L
• Following massive transfusion resulting in dilutional thrombocytopenia
• Patients with platelet dysfunction who are bleeding
• Prophylactically in patients with thrombocytopenia
who are undergoing surgery or who have bone marrow failure.
Apheresis
Apheresis allows the removal of one specific component
of blood such as platelets. Blood withdrawn is separated
and the selected component taken out. The rest of the
blood is then returned to the donor. The time this takes
depends on the blood component required and is usually
in the region of 1–2 hours.
Importantly, since most of the blood taken is
returned, a large amount of the select component can
be taken. This means that the recipient is exposed to
products from fewer donors, and thus the chance of
adverse reactions and infections is reduced.

Fresh-frozen plasma
Fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) contains albumin, immunoglobulins and all the clotting factors. Indications for FFP
transfusion include:

7

• Multiple clotting factor deficiencies, e.g. severe liver
disease, warfarin overdose, massive transfusion and
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura where it is
used in plasma exchange
• Specific coagulation factor replacement where no
concentrate is available
• Plasma loss (albumin solution is used in many cases,
e.g. burns).

HINTS AND TIPS
Compatibility of plasma is the opposite of red cells, e.g.
O plasma contains anti-A and anti-B antibodies so it
should only be given to O recipients.

Cryoprecipitate
Cryoprecipitate is the insoluble precipitate formed
when FFP is thawed at 4 C. It contains factors VIII,
vWF, factor XIII and fibrinogen, and is given to control
bleeding associated with defects thereof. Cryoprecipitate can also be of use in chronic renal failure, advanced
liver failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation and
following massive blood transfusion.

Clotting factor concentrates
Specific clotting factor concentrates can be given to patients with clotting factor deficiencies (see Chapter 6).

White cells
Granulocyte concentrates can be given to infected neutropenic patients not responding to antibiotic therapy,
but this is rare because of the risk of cytomegalovirus
(CMV) transmission.

AN OVERVIEW OF IMMUNOLOGY
Learning immunology is challenging, and one of those
subjects that begins to make sense after the very last lecture in the module. This is because the information received in the last lecture helps you understand the first
and subsequent lectures. To help with this phenomenon
we start with an overview, with the purpose of providing
an understanding of immunology as a whole and building a framework in which information learned later can
be stored.
The function of the immune system is to protect the
body from infection and promote tissue repair following a lesion. The invaders (pathogens) range from large
parasitic worms living in body cavities to small viruses
that can only survive inside their host cells, with bacteria, fungi and protozoans lying somewhere in between
these two extremes of size.
These pathogens and their hosts have evolved side by
side, with pathogens’ increasing sophistication resulting
in greater evolutionary pressure for more complex
immune responses.

Overview of the innate
immune system
The first way the immune system protects against pathogens is to deny them entry through various physical
barriers. These are the skin and mucous membranes that
line the respiratory, gastrointestinal and reproductive
tracts.
Once a pathogen has penetrated the body’s physical
defences, it is confronted by the human immune system. This system is divided into two forces, both of
which get to work straight away: one responds quickly
in a non-specific manner and the other occurs slowly
and is specific to infecting organisms. These are the innate and adaptive immune systems, respectively. These
two systems are heavily dependent on each other.

The innate immune system is composed of both
cellular and soluble protein components, the most
important cellular component being the phagocyte.
Phagocytes are cells that engulf foreign cells and debris
(phage coming from the Greek ‘to eat’).
Phagocytes have receptors, known as pattern recognition molecules (PRM), on their surface which sense
and bind to specific molecules found on foreign cells.
One important family of PRM is the toll-like receptor
(TLR) family. PRMs bind to families of molecules, or
ligands, which can range from carbohydrates to
flagellae. For example TLR4 binds lipo-polysaccharide
(endotoxin) which is a molecule found in the cell
membrane of many different bacteria. Phagocytes also
recognise pathogens that have been flagged by other
parts of the immune system, such as complement
and antibody.
There are two types of phagocyte: the macrophage and
the neutrophil. The macrophage is long lived and
stationed within tissues, patrolling for the presence of
trespassers. Upon contact with a pathogen (e.g. a bacterium), the macrophage engulfs it, a process known as
phagocytosis. The bacterium is contained inside the macrophage, within a ‘phagosome’ which then fuses with a
lysosome that contains enzymes and chemicals that
destroy the bacterium.
Macrophages secrete proteins called cytokines, the
functions of which include attracting other cells
(including short-lived neutrophils), increasing the
permeability of the vascular endothelium and even
increasing the production of neutrophils in the bone
marrow.
Neutrophils act as reinforcements for the sentinel
macrophages, following the trail of cytokines to
the site of infection, a process called chemotaxis.
Neutrophils are professional phagocytes extremely effective at killing pathogens; however, they are short
lived (a failsafe to avoid excessive destruction of
normal tissue) and, if the infection persists, continued
secretion of cytokines will result in further mobilization of neutrophils.

79

Principles of immunology
HINTS AND TIPS
Neutrophils can be recognized histologically as they
have multilobed nuclei and cytoplasmic granules.

Other important cells in the innate immune response include natural killer (NK) cells (a form of lymphocyte) and degranulating cells, such as eosinophils
and mast cells.
The humoral (soluble) section of the innate immune
system is complement. Complement comprises approximately 20 proteins that are activated through various
pathways and can destroy pathogens directly through
the formation of the membrane attack complex
(MAC) or prepare (opsonize) them for destruction by
other parts of the immune system.
The combination of phagocytes and complement
systems is sufficient for dealing with most bacteria
and fungi. However, certain pathogens have evolved
to hide inside a host’s cells where phagocytes and complement cannot reach them. Another problem with this
early immune system is that a host can be infected with
the same pathogen over and over again and the response has to start afresh each time.
HINTS AND TIPS
Pathogens are detected by the innate immune system
in many ways, including through pattern recognition
molecules (PRMs), complement opsonization and
antibody binding.

Overview of the adaptive
immune system
The adaptive immune system, which evolved at about
the same time as the vertebrates, has developed to combat both these flaws of the innate system. This development has led to the adaptive immune system having
many more receptors for pathogenic molecules, since
such receptors are not fixed, but are formed through genetic recombination. This genetic recombination is the
basis of the specificity of the adaptive immune system.
These receptors are expressed on specialized lymphocytes called T and B cells.
T cells are able to recognize intracellular infections.
This is possible as our cells evolved a method whereby
the complete range of proteins within the cell is
expressed as short peptides on its surface. The molecules
that bind the small peptides to be expressed on the cell
surface are called the major histocompatibility complex
(MHC), also known as human leucocyte antigen (HLA).

80

Some cells are particularly good at presenting antigen
to T cells. These cells are known as antigen-presenting
cells (APCs), and examples are macrophages and dendritic cells. These cells are seen as the link between
the innate and adaptive immune systems, in that by presenting antigen to T cells they activate an adaptive
response.
One subset of T lymphocytes are called T helper (Th)
cells. These cells usually express a glycoprotein called
CD4, and are therefore known as CD4þ T cells. These
cells are crucial in determining the type of immune response deployed. Another subset of T lymphocytes are
called cytotoxic T cells. They are effector cells and can
destroy infected host cells. These cells usually express
CD8 and are thus referred to as CD8þ T cells. Activated
B cells, known as plasma cells, can release their receptors
into blood and bodily secretions. These free receptors
are called antibodies or immunoglobulin (Ig). The function of antibody is to flag up foreign antigens for destruction by other parts of the immune system. There
are five different classes of antibodies known as IgA,
IgD, IgE, IgG and IgM. They all have different properties
and roles.
The adaptive immune system has the capacity to ‘remember’ previously encountered pathogens. This memory is dependent on long-lived memory B and T cells.
They enable the innate immune system to recognize
and confront the pathogen if exposure is repeated. It
mounts a rapid and specific response, preventing
infection.
HINTS AND TIPS
The adaptive immune system is triggered through
antigen-presenting cells (APCs). T cells coordinate the
adaptive immune response, as well as eradicating some
pathogens. B cells create antibody, enabling the innate
immune system to recognize the pathogen, as well as
be responsible for immunological memory.

Essential differences between the innate and adaptive
immune systems are outlined in Figure 8.1.
Both the innate and adaptive immune systems comprise cellular and humoral components (Figure 8.2).
An overview of the body’s defences against infection
is shown in Figure 8.3.

Cytokines
Cytokines are small, secreted proteins and are the messengers of the immune system, allowing cells to communicate. They act locally, via specific cell-surface
receptors, as part of both the innate and adaptive

The adaptive immune system

Fig. 8.3 A simple schematic of the immune system. For a
pathogen to colonize human tissues, it must invade the body’s
barriers to infection and then evade the innate and adaptive
immune systems. Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) act as the
bridge between the two systems.

Important cytokines include members of the interluekin (IL) family, interferon (IFN) family and tumour
necrosis factor (TNF) family. A group of cytokines are
responsible for chemotaxis, a process in which leukocytes are guided to sites of infection. These cytokines
are called chemokines. IL-8 is an important member
of this family. These proteins are important because
drugs have been designed to block their effects.
Some important cytokines and their main actions are
shown in Figure 8.4.

Innate defences can be classified into three main groups:
1. Barriers to infection
2. Cells
3. Serum proteins and the complement system.

• Competing with pathogenic bacteria for nutrients
and attachment sites
• Production of antibacterial substances.
The use of antibiotics can disrupt the normal flora,
making pathogenic organisms more likely to cause
disease.

BARRIERS TO INFECTION

Physical and mechanical
Skin and mucosal membranes act as physical barriers to
the entry of pathogens. Tight junctions between cells
prevent the majority of pathogens from entering the
body. The flushing actions of tears, saliva and urine protect epithelial surfaces from colonization. High oxygen
tension in the lungs, and body temperature, can also
inhibit microbial growth.
In the respiratory tract, mucus is secreted to trap
microorganisms. They are then mechanically expelled by:

CELLS OF INNATE IMMUNITY
The cells of the innate immune system consist of:
• Phagocytes
• Degranulating cells
• Natural killer cells.

Phagocytes

• Beating cilia (mucociliary escalator)
• Coughing
• Sneezing.

Phagocytes (macrophages and neutrophils) engulf and
then destroy pathogens. Macrophages are long-lived
sentinel cells stationed at likely sites of infection; upon
infection they release cytokines that recruit the shorterlived but more actively phagocytic neutrophils.

Chemical

Neutrophils (for structure, see p. 37;
for production, see p. 2)

The growth of microorganisms is inhibited at acidic pH
(e.g. in the stomach and vagina). Lactic acid and fatty
acids in sebum (produced by sebaceous glands) maintain the skin pH between 3 and 5. Enzymes such as
lysozyme (found in saliva, sweat and tears) and pepsin
(present in the gut) destroy microorganisms.

Biological (normal flora)
A person’s normal flora is formed when non-pathogenic
bacteria colonize epithelial surfaces. Normal flora protects the host by:

Neutrophils comprise 50–70% of circulating white
cells. Neutrophils arrive quickly at the site of inflammation and in the act of killing pathogens they die; in fact,
dead neutrophils are the major constituent of pus. In response to tissue damage, chemicals released by macrophages and complement proteins, neutrophils migrate
from the bloodstream to the site of the insult (see
Chapter 11). They are phagocytes and have an important role in engulfing and killing extracellular pathogens. The process of phagocytosis and the mechanisms
of killing are shown on page 85. During inflammation,
neutrophil production is stimulated by the cytokine

83

The innate immune system
G-CSF. A high neutrophil count is part of the acute
phase response (see below). Neutrophils can be activated and recruited either by IL-8 and TNF secreted by
macrophages, or by IL-17 secreted by T cells of the adaptive immune system.

HINTS AND TIPS
Neutropenic individuals are at an increased risk of
serious bacterial infections. These patients should be
treated early and aggressively to reduce the chance of
sepsis.

Mononuclear phagocyte system
Monocytes and macrophages comprise the other major
group of phagocytic cells. Monocytes account for
5–10% of the white cell count and circulate in the blood
for approximately 8 hours before migrating into the tissues, where they differentiate into macrophages; these
macrophages can live for decades. Some macrophages
become adapted for specific functions in particular tissues, e.g. Kupffer cells in the liver and glial cells in the
brain. Monocytes also differentiate into osteoclasts
and microglial cells.
In comparison to monocytes, macrophages:
• Are larger and longer-lived
• Have greater phagocytic ability
• Have a larger repertoire of lytic enzymes and secretory products.

• MHC and B7 molecules (to activate the adaptive
immune response).
Macrophages can be activated by:
• Cytokines such as IFN-g
• Contact with complement or products of blood
coagulation
• Direct contact with the target through PRM
stimulation.
Following activation, macrophages become more
efficient phagocytes and have increased secretory and
microbicidal activity. They also stimulate the adaptive
immune system by expressing higher levels of MHC
class II molecules and secreting cytokines.
In comparison to neutrophils, macrophages:
• Are longer-lived (they do not die after dealing with
pathogens)
• Are larger (diameter 25–50 mm), enabling phagocytosis of larger targets
• Move and phagocytose more slowly
• Retain Golgi apparatus and rough endoplasmic reticulum and can therefore synthesize new proteins, including lysosomal enzymes and secretory products
• Can act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

Killing by phagocytes
The process of phagocytosis allows cells to engulf matter
that needs to be destroyed. The cell can then digest the
material in a controlled fashion before releasing the contents. The process of phagocytosis is shown in Figure 9.1.

Macrophages phagocytose and destroy their targets
using similar mechanisms to neutrophils. The rate of
phagocytosis can be greatly increased by opsonins such
as IgG and the complement protein C3b (neutrophils
and macrophages have receptors for these molecules,
which may be bound to the antigenic surface). Intracellular pathogens, e.g. Mycobacterium, can prove difficult
for macrophages to kill. They are either resistant to destruction inside the phagosome or can enter the macrophage cytoplasm. For the immune system to act against
these pathogens, T cell help is required.
In addition to phagocytosis, macrophages can secrete
a number of compounds into the extracellular space,
including cytokines (TNF, IL-8 and IL-1) and hydrolytic
enzymes. Macrophages are also able to process and present antigen in association with class II MHC molecules.
Macrophages express a wide array of surface molecules including:

Natural killer (NK) cells

• Fc-gRI–III (receptors for the Fc portion of IgG, types
I–III) and complement receptors
• Pattern recognition molecules (PRMs)
• Cytokine receptors, e.g. TNF-a and interferon-g
(IFN-g)

NK cells can also destroy antibody-coated target cells
irrespective of the presence of MHC molecules, a process
known as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. This occurs because killing is initiated by crosslinking of receptors for the Fc portion of IgG1 and IgG3.

84

NK cells utilize cell-surface receptors to identify virally
modified or cancerous cells. NK cells do not require
T cell help to kill pathogens, although they are more
effective when T helper cells secrete IFN-g. One set of
receptors activates NK cells, initiating killing; others
inhibit the cells:
• Activating receptors include calcium-binding
C-lectins, which recognize certain cell-surface carbohydrates. Because these carbohydrates are present on
the surface of normal host cells, a system of inhibitory receptors acts to prevent killing
• Killer inhibitor receptors (KIRs), members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily, are specific for
class I MHC molecules. Human NK cells also express
an inhibitory receptor (a heterodimer CD94:NKG2)
that detects non-classical class I MHC molecules.

Pseudopodia extend from the surface of the cell to surround the
pathogen (1). The pseudopodia fuse around the organism,
producing a vesicle known as a phagosome (2). Lysosomes fuse
with the phagosome to form phagolysosomes (3). Chemicals
within the lysosome, and other granules that fuse with the
phagolysosome, lead to degradation of the organism. The
microbial products are then released.

NK cells are not clonally restricted, have no memory
and are not very specific in their action. They induce apoptosis in target cells (Fig. 9.2) by:
• Ligation of FAS or TNF receptors on the target cells
(NK cells produce TNF and exhibit FASL). This initiates a sequence of caspase recruitment and activation, resulting in apoptosis
• Degranulation by NK cells, which releases perforins
and granzymes. Perforin molecules insert into and
polymerize within the target cell membrane. This
forms a pore through which granzymes can pass.
Granzyme B then initiates apoptosis from within
the target cell cytoplasm.

Mast cells and basophils
(for structure, see p. 40)
Mast cells and basophils have similar functions but are
found in different locations; basophils comprise < 1%
of circulating white cells, whereas mast cells are resident
in the tissues.
High concentrations of mast cells are found close to
blood vessels in connective tissue, skin and mucosal
membranes. The two types of mast cell—mucosal and
connective tissue—differ in their tissue distribution,
protease content and secretory profiles.
Mast cells function by discharging their granule contents. Degranulation is triggered by cross-linking of
high-affinity receptors for the Fc portion of IgE
(Fig. 9.3). Cross-linkage results in an influx of calcium
ions into the cell, which induces release of pharmacologically active mediators from granules (Fig. 9.4). Mast
cell activation releases leukotrienes, which attract eosinophils to the site of worm infection. This plays an important role in the development of an episode of a
type I hypersensitivity, with the mast cells and basophils
providing the early phase response and the eosinophils
mediating the late phase response. This is important in
allergic responses (type I hypersensitivity reactions, see
p. 117).
HINTS AND TIPS
During severe allergy (anaphylaxis, see p. 121) mast
cell tryptase levels increase for a few hours. This is a
useful diagnostic test for anaphylaxis.

Eosinophils (for structure,
see p. 38)
Eosinophils comprise 1–3% of circulating white cells
and are found principally in tissues. They are derived
from the colony-forming unit for granulocytes, erythrocytes, monocytes and megakaryocytes (CFU-GEMM)
haematopoietic precursor and their maturation is similar to that of the neutrophil (see p. 2). They are important
in the defence against parasites and cause damage by extracellular degranulation. Their granules contain major
basic protein, cationic protein, peroxidase and perforinlike molecules. The peroxidase generates hypochlorous
acid, major basic protein damages the parasite’s outer

SOLUBLE PROTEINS
The soluble proteins that contribute to innate immunity
(Fig. 9.5) can be divided into antimicrobial serum
agents and proteins produced by cells of the immune
system.

86

The acute phase response is a systemic reaction to
infection or tissue injury, where macrophages release
cytokines IL-1, IL-6 and TNF; these cytokines reach
the liver through the circulation. The liver responds
by increasing its production of certain plasma proteins.
These so-named acute phase proteins (APPs) are:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

C-reactive protein
Serum amyloid A
Complement components
Fibrinogen
a1-Antitrypsin
Caeruloplasmin
Haptoglobulin.

The change in plasma concentration is accompanied
by fever, leucocytosis, thrombocytosis, catabolism of
muscle proteins and fat deposits. Synthesis of APPs is
enhanced by cytokines secreted by macrophages and
endothelial cells. The two main APPs are C-reactive
protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA).
The extent of the rise in the plasma concentration of
different APPs varies:
• Increased 50% above normal levels: caeruloplasmin
• Increased several fold above normal levels: a1glycoprotein, a1-proteinase inhibitor, haptoglobulin, fibrinogen
• 100–1000-fold increase: CRP, SAA.
The concentration of other plasma proteins, most
notably albumin and transferrin, falls.

elevation can be slight (e.g. cerebrovascular accident),
moderate (e.g. myocardial infarction) or marked (e.g.
bacterial infections).

HINTS AND TIPS
TNF-a, IL-1 and IL-6 released by macrophages
stimulate the liver to produce the acute phase
proteins.

87

The innate immune system

Serum amyloid A
SAA levels rise within hours of tissue injury or infection.
SAA induces the migration of inflammatory cells to sites
of inflammation and functions as an opsonin, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Persistent elevation of SAA can lead to its deposition in tissues in
amyloidosis (see p. 54).

Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is an index of
the acute phase response. It is especially representative
of the concentration of fibrinogen and a-globulins. Elevated fibrinogen levels cause red cells to form stacks
(rouleaux), which sediment more rapidly than individual blood cells.
HINTS AND TIPS
In chronic inflammation, high C-reactive protein (CRP)
and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) persist. The
resulting catabolism of muscle and fat may lead to
severe weight loss.

The acute phase response
The acute phase response provides us with chemical
markers of inflammation that can be measured. In a
child presenting with abdominal pain a C-reactive
protein (CRP) can aid the clinician in their diagnosis.
A normal CRP can allow more conservative
management whereas a raised CRP would indicate an
inflammatory response and necessitate urgent
treatment, such as surgery in differentiating the
abdominal pain in constipation from that of appendicitis.
The neutrophil count and erythrocyte sedimentation
rate (ESR) take more time than CRP to become elevated.
They are a useful marker measured in chronic
inflammatory diseases. Some hospitals now measure
plasma viscosity instead of ESR. However, ESR levels are
still crucial for the diagnosis of giant cell (temporal) arteritis.

The complement system
The complement system (so-called because its actions
are complementary to the function of antibody) is, in fact,
much older in evolutionary terms than antibody and is
equally important.
Complement is a collection of over 20 serum proteins
that are always at high levels in the blood of the healthy
individual. The complement system may seem complex
with all the alphanumerical naming and active and

88

inactive components. Thinking about it simply, it is a system that has three methods of activating a common pathway, which in turn has three results or effectors. The reason
for the large number of proteins is to allow amplification;
many of the components of complement are proenzymes
that, when cleaved, activate more complement.
The three pathways that activate the complement system are the classical, the alternative and the lectin. All
pathways result in the activation of the complement
component C3 to C3 convertase. An overview of the
complement system is given in Figure 9.6.

The classical pathway
The classical pathway was discovered first and involves
the activation of complement by the Fc portion of antibody. IgM is particularly good at activating complement
as it is a pentamer (has five Fc portions):
• Fc activates C1
• C1 activates C2 and C4
• C2 and C4 activate C3 (C3 convertase).

The alternative pathway
C3 is an unstable molecule and without inhibition spontaneously breaks down to the very reactive C3b; C3b reacts to two common chemical functional groups, the
amino and hydroxyl groups. C3b is therefore neutralized
quickly by water. However, with many pathogens made
up of proteins and carbohydrates that contain these functional groups, C3b attaches to the pathogen and is not
broken down. C3b then reacts with more complement
components to form C3bBb; this is C3 convertase.

The lectin pathway
Mannan-binding lectin (MBL), which is normally
found in serum, binds to MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP). This complex bears structural homology
to the C1 complex. When MBL binds to carbohydrate
on the surface of bacteria, MASP is activated. MASP then
acts on C4 and C2 to generate the C3 convertase of the
classical pathway.

C3 convertase
With the production of C3 convertase, all three pathways converge. C3 convertase has enzymatic effects
against C3 and enables the production of large quantities of C3b, thus producing a major amplification step
in the complement pathway.

Effectors of complement
C5 is cleaved into C5a and C5b. C5b then triggers the
activation of C6–C9. These form the membrane attack
complex (MAC). The MAC attacks pathogens by inserting a hole in their cell membrane; the pathogen then

dies via osmotic lysis. The MAC appears to be the only
way the immune system has of killing one family of bacteria, the Neisseria (a family that includes meningococcus and gonococcus).
The cleaved fragments C3a and C5a are anaphylotoxins which are chemoattractant for other immune cells
which follow the concentration gradient to the infection. Complement also opsonizes bacteria as macrophages have receptors for C3b.
These functions are summarized in Figure 9.7.

Inhibitors of complement
As we have seen, complement can activate spontaneously through the alternative pathway. Complement
is regulated by inhibitory molecules which are necessary
to prevent complement-mediated damage of healthy
cells. There are nine complement inhibitors which act
at various levels throughout the pathway:
• Membrane cofactor protein, complement receptor
type 1, C4b-binding protein and factor H: these prevent assembly of C3 convertase

• Decay accelerating factor: this accelerates decay of
C3 convertase
• C1 inhibitor: inhibits C1
• Factor I and membrane cofactor protein: cleave C3b
and C4b
• CD59 (protectin): prevents the formation of the
membrane attack complex (MAC).
Hereditary angioedema
Deficiency in even one of these inhibitory components
can result in significant disease. For example, deficiency in
C1 inhibitor results in hereditary angioedema (HAE; see
Fig. 9.8) types I and II, conditions where there is activation
of the classical pathway with minimal stimulation. This is
of particular significance if the stimulation is in the larynx
as it can lead to uncontrolled swelling. This laryngeal
oedema can obstruct the airway and without infusion of
C1 inhibitor can prove fatal. The clinical picture resembles
anaphylaxis (see Chapter 12) and patients are often
treated with adrenaline, which has no effect.

We have already come across the recognition molecules
MBL and C1q in the complement system. These are
found in solution in the serum and are classified as collectins, being composed of collagen-like and lectin
portions. Lectins are any protein that binds sugar molecules, usually on the surface of bacteria, e.g. MBL binds
to the sugar mannose.
NOD is a pattern recognition molecule with some special characteristics. It recognizes bacterial cell wall components and stimulates an immune response. The NOD
gene is mutated in some individuals with Crohn’s disease.
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are a family of about a
dozen pattern recognition molecules. When they bind
their lectin, they send a signal to innate immune system
cells which then secrete cytokines. They have a few important clinical roles. In endotoxic shock (septic shock)
TLR-4 is stimulated by vast amounts of LPS released during septicaemia. This causes release of TNF, which in
turn activates nitrous oxide synthase causing a fall in
blood pressure.
Drugs designed to bind and stimulate TLRs are being
used in situations where it is helpful to stimulate a more
powerful immune response, for example in some
vaccines and cancer treatments.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Understand the structure and function of the major histocompatibility complex MHC
• Understand the principle of genetic recombination, and how this leads to receptor diversity
• Explain the functions of the differing classes of immunoglobulins
• Draw the structure and understand the functions of immunoglobulins and T cell receptors
• Understand the differences in the types of T helper cells and the immune responses they evoke.

THE IMMUNOGLOBULIN
DOMAIN
B and T cell surface receptors are members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. Genes in this family code
for proteins composed of motifs called immunoglobulin
(Ig) domains. All molecules in the immunoglobulin
superfamily extend from the surface of cells. They are
flexible and include specialist domains; the antigen
receptor site on B cell receptors is an example.
Members of this gene family include:
•
•
•
•
•

Immunoglobulin (B cell receptor)
T cell receptor
MHC molecules
T cell accessory molecules such as CD4
Certain adhesion molecules, e.g. ICAM-1, ICAM-2
and VCAM-1.

Each domain is approximately 110 amino acids in
length. The polypeptide chain in each domain is folded
into seven or eight antiparallel beta strands. The strands
are arranged to form two opposing sheets, linked by a
disulphide bond and hydrophobic interactions. This
compact structure is called the immunoglobulin fold.

Structure of B and T cell surface
antigen receptors
Structure of immunoglobulin
The B cell surface receptor is a membrane-bound
immunoglobulin (mIg) molecule. mIg recognizes the
conformational structure (shape) of antigenic epitopes. Ig is composed of two light and two heavy
chains. In the B cell receptor (Fig. 10.1), mIg associates
with two Ig-a/Ig-b dimers (members of the immunoglobulin gene superfamily). Signal transduction

through the mIg is thought to be mediated by the
Ig-a/Ig-b heterodimers.
Ig is also secreted by plasma cells (see p. 98). The extracellular portion of mIg is identical in structure to secretory Ig. mIg differs from secreted Ig (sIg) because it has
transmembrane and cytoplasmic portions that anchor
it to the membrane. Different Ig classes can be expressed
on the same B cell and may indicate the stage of development of the B cell, e.g. a mature, but antigenically
unchallenged B cell expresses both mIgM and mIgD.
The antigenic specificity of all of the mIg molecules
expressed on any given B cell is the same.
Antigen recognition by T cells differs from antigen
recognition by B cells:
• T cells recognize peptide fragments of an antigen in
association with MHC molecules; these fragments
of antigen are processed by APCs before they are
presented to the T cell
• T cells recognize antigen only when it is associated
with a molecule of the MHC.
The T cell surface antigen receptor consists of the T cell
receptor (TCR) associated with CD3. The TCR is a
heterodimer, comprising a- and b-chains, or g-and
d-chains. Approximately 95% of T cells express abreceptors. The TCR is structurally similar to the immunoglobulin Fab region (see p. 97). Each chain comprises
two immunoglobulin domains, one variable and one
constant, linked by a disulphide bond. As in the variable
domains of immunoglobulin, three variable regions on
each chain combine to form the antigen-binding site.
CD3 is made up of three polypeptide dimers, consisting of four or five different peptide chains. The dimers are
gE, dE and zz (found in 90% of CD3 molecules) or zZ. The
g-, d- and E-chains are members of the Ig gene superfamily.
The TCR recognizes and binds antigen, and CD3,
functionally analogous to the Ig-a/Ig-b heterodimer in
B cells, is involved in signal transduction (Fig. 10.2).

A complete set of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) alleles inherited from one parent is referred to

Plasma

MHC genes exhibit a high degree of polymorphism,
i.e. they exhibit considerable diversity (there are more
than 100 identified alleles for human leucocyte antigen
B (HLA-B)). This means that most individuals will be heterozygous at most MHC loci and that any two randomly
selected individuals are very unlikely to have identical
HLA alleles. Diversity of the MHC increases the chance
that a person will be able to mount an adaptive response
against a pathogen. The genetic loci are tightly linked, so
that one set is inherited from each parent. The genes are
divided into three regions, each region encoding one of
the three classes of the MHC: class I, class II and class III
(Fig. 10.3). The MHC alleles exhibit codominance, which
means that both alleles are expressed.

Membrane-bound immunoglobulin is non-signalling.
It associates with two Ig-a/Ig-b heterodimers (members of
the immunoglobulin gene superfamily), which have long
cytoplasmic domains capable of transducing a signal.

The major histocompatibility
complex (MHC)

Structure and function of the MHC
Class I and class II MHC molecules are glycoproteins
expressed on the cell surface and consist of cytoplasmic,
transmembrane and extracellular portions (Fig. 10.4).
Both class I and class II molecules exhibit broad
specificity in their binding of peptide. The polymorphism of the MHC is largely concentrated in the peptide
binding cleft.

HINTS AND TIPS
Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a generic
term for a group of molecules produced by higher
vertebrate species. The human leucocyte antigen
(HLA) system is the human MHC.

molecule is also shown as seen from above.

MHC restriction
T cells are only able to recognize antigen in the context
of self-MHC molecules (self-MHC restriction). CD8þ
T cells recognize antigen only in association with class
I MHC molecules (class I MHC restricted). CD4þ cells
recognize antigen only in association with class II
MHC molecules (class II MHC restricted).

Antigen processing
and presentation
MHC molecules do not present whole antigen, the
antigen being degraded into peptide fragments before
binding can occur. There are different pathways of
antigen processing for class I and class II MHC;
these pathways are summarized in Figure 10.5. Class I

molecules are found on nearly all nucleated cells. Class
I MHC molecules present endogenous antigens, such as
those found in cells infected by viruses or intracellular
bacteria. Thus CD8þ T cells recognize virally altered cells
and destroy them (see p. 112). Class II MHC molecules
present exogenous antigens that may have been phagoor endocytosed into intracellular vesicles.
Professional antigen-processing cells process and present antigen to CD4þ T cells in association with class II
molecules. These cells express high levels of class II
MHC molecules. Professional APCs include:
• Dendritic cells, including Langerhans’ cells
• Macrophages
• B cells.
A summary of the differences between class I and
class II MHC molecules is shown in Figure 10.6.

transported from the rough ER to the

Structure and function
of CD4 and CD8
CD4 and CD8 are ‘accessory’ molecules that play an
important role in the T cell–antigen interaction. CD4
and CD8 have two important functions:
• They bind MHC class II and class I molecules, respectively, thereby strengthening the T cell–antigen
interaction
• They function as signal transducers.

94

The role of CD4 and CD8 in antigen–receptor binding is
shown in Figure 10.7.

GENERATION OF ANTIGEN
RECEPTOR DIVERSITY
There are approximately 208 possible antigens, each
requiring a corresponding receptor. The human genome contains only 30,000 genes and so each receptor

closely associated with the TCR
complex. They bind MHC in a
restricted fashion (CD8 to class I only,
CD4 to class II only). Binding is
antigen independent and strengthens
the bond between TCR and a
complementary peptide-MHC
complex. Molecules associated with
CD4 or CD8 are then able to

cannot be coded by a single gene. Instead this diversity
is achieved by genetic recombination, a process where
segments of information are cut and pasted from
the gene.
T cell receptor and immunoglobulin are the only
genes to undergo genetic recombination.
HINTS AND TIPS
Rearrangement of gene segments allows antibodies
with an immense variety of specificity to be produced
from a relatively small amount of DNA.

Genetic rearrangements
Before genetic recombination occurs, we say the gene
segments are in germline configuration. Rearrangement
only occurs in the variable domain (those that code for
the active site) as the other segments of the receptor remain constant. Each variable domain is encoded by a
random combination of one of each of the V, D (heavy
chain only) and J exons (nucleic acid sequences). Following genetic rearrangement, one exon remains which
codes for a variable domain. The C exons encode the
constant regions. Heavy-chain C gene segments are clusters of exons, each of which encodes either a domain or
a hinge region of the constant region.
Following rearrangement, the clonal progeny of
each B cell will produce Ig of a single specificity.

Rearrangement is completed and functional Ig chains
are produced before the B cell encounters antigen
(Fig. 10.8).
The presence of multiple V, D (heavy chain only) and
J gene segments, and the apparently random selection of
these segments, generates considerable diversity, which
can be calculated (Fig. 10.9).
A similar process occurs in T cells: a- and g-chain variable domains have V and J segments; b- and d-chains
have V, D and J segments.

Junctional diversity
The formation of junctions between the various gene
segments produces an opportunity for increased diversity, where nucleotides are added or subtracted at
random to form the joining segments.

Junctional flexibility and N-nucleotide addition
When exons are spliced, there are slight variations in
the position of segmental joining. In addition, up to
15 nucleotides can be added to the D–J and the V–DJ
joints. This occurs only in heavy chains and is catalysed
by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT).
Both junctional flexibility and N-nucleotide addition
can disrupt the reading frame, leading to non-functional
rearrangements. However, formation of productive rearrangements increases antibody diversity. The V–J, V–DJ
and VD–J joints fall within the antigen-binding region
of the variable domain. Therefore, diversity generated
at these joints will impact on the antigen specificity of
the Ig molecule.

Fig. 10.8 Rearrangement of the heavy chain is similar to that of the light chain, although the join between D and J segments occurs
first. In an unstimulated B cell, the heavy-chain mRNA that is transcribed contains both the Cm and Cd segments. The mRNA can
be differentially spliced such that both IgM and IgD will be produced. They will both exhibit the same antigen binding specificity.

Given the fact that light chain can associate with any heavy chain, and from the number of gene segments present in germline DNA, it is possible
to calculate the number of different molecules that can be produced. The extent of the contribution of junctional flexibility, N-nucleotide
addition and somatic hypermutation is not known but will be significant.

Somatic hypermutation
Somatic hypermutation is a process that increases the affinity of antibody for its antigen and is also called affinity maturation. B cells that are dividing by mitosis to
increase in number in order to combat infection are
allowed to undergo mutation in their variable domain
(the only cells in the body permitted to do so). Some

96

mutations decrease the antibody’s specificity for the antigen and apoptosis is stimulated in these cells; others
result in antibody of increased specificity—these are
positively selected for. Antibodies produced later in
the primary immune response, and in the secondary immune response, will therefore have an increased affinity
for antigen.

Humoral immunity
The TCR does not exhibit somatic hypermutation.
Diversity is generated only in developing T cells, which
can be deleted if they are either self-reactive or nonfunctional.

Class switching
This is the process whereby a single B cell can produce
different classes of Ig that have the same specificity. The
mechanism is not well understood but involves ‘switch
sites’—DNA sequences located upstream from each
heavy chain C gene segment (except Cd). Possible
mechanisms include:
• Differential splicing of the primary transcript (see
Fig. 10.8)
• A looping out and deletion of intervening heavy
chain C gene segments (and introns)
• Exchange of C gene segments between
chromosomes.
This process underlies the class switch from IgM in
the primary response to IgG, IgA or IgE in the secondary
response. Cytokines are important in controlling the
switch.
Recognition molecules and their diversity are important for the generation of a specific, adaptive immune
response. The adaptive immune response can be
humoral or cell-mediated.

HUMORAL IMMUNITY

B cells and antibody production
The humoral immune response is brought about by
antibodies, which are particularly efficient at eliminating extracellular pathogens. Antigen can be cleared
from the host by a variety of effector mechanisms,
which are dependent on antibody class or isotype
(see p. 99):
• Activation of complement, leading to lysis or opsonization of the microorganism
• Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC)
• Neutralization of bacterial toxins and viruses
• Mucosal immunity (IgA-mediated)
• Degranulation of mast cells – (IgE and IgG
mediated).
Activated and differentiated B cells, known as plasma
cells, produce antibodies. An overview of B cell activation
is given in Figure 10.10.
B cells are activated within follicles found in secondary lymphoid structures, e.g. lymph nodes and
spleen, only if they encounter specific antigen. During

10

proliferation, variable regions of the immunoglobulin
genes undergo somatic hypermutation. This process
occurs in the germinal centre of the follicle. Follicular
dendritic cells present antigen, to which the B cells
with the highest affinity will bind. This causes the expression of bcl-2, which prevents B cells undergoing
apoptosis. Therefore, the highest-affinity clones are
positively selected. In order for B cells to produce antibody, they require help from T cells. Activated T
helper cells provide the help needed by producing cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6). This acts as a further
method of regulation within the immune system, as
both B cells and T cells need exposure to the offending
antigen in order for a response to be evoked. An overview of clonal selection of B cells is given in
Figure 10.11.

Structure and function of antibody
The structure of immunoglobulin is shown in
Figure 10.12.
Immunoglobulin molecules (using IgG as an example) are composed of two identical heavy and two
identical light chains, linked by disulphide bridges. The
light chains consist of one variable and one constant
domain, while the heavy chain contains one variable
and three constant domains. Digestion of IgG with
papain (papaya protinase 1, an enzyme derived from
papayas) produces two types of fragment:
1. Two Fab fragments (bind antigen) consisting of the
light chain and two domains of the heavy chain
(denoted VH and CH1)
2. One Fc fragment (binds complement) consisting of
the remainder of the heavy chain (CH2 and CH3).

The light chain
The light chain is comprised of a variable, amino (N)
terminal domain and a constant domain at the carboxy
(C) terminal.
The constant region can be k or l, but both light
chains within an Ig molecule will be the same; 60%
of human light chains are k.

The heavy chain
The heavy chain has a variable domain attached to several constant domains. There are five classes of immunoglobulin (Ig) in humans: IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE and
IgD. The heavy chain determines the immunoglobulin
class. The heavy chain can be g (IgG), a (IgA), m (IgM),
E (IgE) or d (IgD). IgG, IgA and IgD have three constant
domains with a hinge region; IgM and IgE have four
constant domains but no hinge region.

The adaptive immune system
Fig. 10.10 Overview of the humoral
immune response. Activated and
differentiated B cells, known as
plasma cells, produce antibody. B cells
are activated by antigen in a T-cellindependent or dependent fashion.
T helper cells are primed by
antigen-presenting cells (APCs),
which present antigen in conjunction
with MHC class II molecules. B cells
are stimulated by antigen interacting
with B cell receptors. Primed T helper
cells interact with B cells that also
express antigen–MHC complexes.
This interaction induces a sequence of
surface receptor binding and cytokine
production that results in B-cell
activation, proliferation and
differentiation. (1) Binding of the T
cell receptor (TCR) to MHC induces
the T cell to produce CD40L, which
binds to CD40 on the B cell, producing
a major stimulatory signal. (2) CD28
on the T cell then interacts with B7 on
the B cell (costimulatory signal).
Cytokines are also involved; their
actions are shown in the diagram.

The variable domain
Each variable domain exhibits three regions that are
hypervariable. The hypervariable regions on both light
and heavy chains are closely aligned in the immunoglobulin molecule. Together, they form the antigen-binding
site and therefore determine the molecule’s specificity.

The hinge region
The hinge allows movement and therefore greater
interaction with epitopes. The hinge region is also the
site of the interchain disulphide bonds.

Memory B cell

Plasma cell

and IgD are monomeric, secreted IgA (sIgA) is usually
present as a dimer, and secreted IgM as a pentamer.
The sIgA molecule is made up of two IgA monomers:
a J chain and a secretory piece. The IgA dimer (J
chain) is produced by submucosal plasma cells and
enters the mucosal epithelial cell via receptormediated endocytosis, binding to the poly-Ig receptor.
Having passed from the basal to the luminal surface
of the epithelial cell, the IgA dimer is secreted across
the mucosa, with part of the poly-Ig receptor (the secretory piece) still attached.

Lymphatic drainage
and lymph nodes
Lymph nodes are secondary lymphoid organs. They
provide a site for lymphocytes to interact with antigen
and other cells of the immune system.
At the arterial end of capillaries, water and lowmolecular-weight solutes are forced out into tissue
spaces due to high hydrostatic pressure, creating interstitial fluid. Most interstitial fluid returns to the venous
circulation at the venous end of capillaries (due to osmotic pressure gradients). The remainder leaves the interstitial space via the lymphatic system. Once interstitial
fluid has entered a lymphatic vessel it is known as lymph.
Lymphatic vessels are present in almost all tissues and
organs of the body.

Lymphatic circulation
The lymphatic system acts as a passive drainage system
to return interstitial fluid to the systemic circulation;
lymph is not pumped around the body. Lymph vessels

therefore contain numerous valves to prevent backflow
of lymph. Afferent lymph vessels carry lymph into
lymph nodes. They empty into the subcapsular sinus
and lymph percolates through the node. Each node is
drained by only one efferent vessel.
Lymph returns to the circulation at lymphovenous
junctions. These are located at the junction of the right
subclavian vein and right internal jugular vein (which
empties the right lymphatic duct) and at the junction
of the left subclavian vein and left internal jugular vein
(which empties the thoracic duct).

Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes act as filters, ‘sampling’ lymphatic fluid
for bacteria, viruses and foreign particles. APCs, loaded
with antigen, also migrate through lymph nodes. They
are present throughout the lymphatic system, often occurring at junctions of the lymphatic vessels. Lymph
nodes frequently form chains, and may drain a specific
organ or area of the body.

migrate back to the skin following transport in the

This recirculation is governed by the expression of
molecules on both the lymphocyte and surface endothelium. These molecules, called integrins, confer specificity to lymphocyte recirculation. This fine tuning of
lymphocyte recirculation is known as lymphocyte homing. Areas of endothelium through which lymphocytes
migrate are known as high endothelial venules (HEVs).

The chains are divided into domains, each of which is an

antigen-binding site. Digestion of the immunoglobulin
molecule with papain produces an Fc portion (which binds
complement) and two Fab portions (which bind antigen).

Lymph nodes act as sites for initiation of the adaptive
immune response. Antigen is sampled, processed and
presented by several professional APCs (macrophages
and dendritic cells).

Lymphocyte recirculation
Lymphocytes move continuously between blood and
lymph. Efferent lymph contains more lymphocytes than
afferent lymph because:

Lymph nodes can become enlarged (lymphadenopathy) for several reasons, including infection. Causes of
lymphadenopathy are outlined on page 7.

HINTS AND TIPS
Lymphadenopathy can be a sign of infection.
Understanding the drainage of lymph can lead you to
the source of infection.

Mucosal-associated lymphoid
tissue (MALT)
MALT consists of unencapsulated subepithelial lymphoid tissue found in the gastrointestinal, respiratory
and urogenital tracts (Fig. 10.16).
It can be subdivided into:
• Organized lymphoid tissue, e.g. tonsils, appendix,
Peyer’s patches
• Diffuse lymphoid tissue located in the lamina
propria of intestinal villi and lungs.

• Antigenic challenge results in stimulation and proliferation of lymphocytes
• Lymphocytes enter the lymph node directly from
blood.

Organized lymphoid tissue

Lymphocyte recirculation is essential for a normal
immune response (Fig. 10.15). Approximately 1–2%
of the lymphocytic pool recirculates each hour. This
increases the chances of an antigenically committed
lymphocyte encountering complementary antigen.
Lymphocytes tend to recirculate to similar tissues.
For example, an activated lymphocyte that has migrated
from the skin to a local lymph node is most likely to

• Lingual, palatine and nasopharyngeal tonsils
• Adenoids
• Bronchial nodules.

Respiratory tract
MALT in the nose and bronchi includes the:

The respiratory system is exposed to a large number
of organisms every day, most of which are cleared by the
mucociliary escalator. Microorganisms that are not removed are presented by dendritic cells in the bronchi
and stimulate germinating centres.

• Intracellular pathogens and infected cells (mainly
viruses, mycobacteria and fungi)

The thymus plays an important role in cell-mediated
immunity because it is the site of T cell maturation.

The thymus gland
The thymus is important for the production of T lymphocytes, selection of those which will recognize
self-MHC and deletion of those that recognize selfantigen. T lymphocyte differentiation begins in the
bone marrow (see p. 2) before early precursor cells migrate to the thymus. In the thymus, immature T lymphocytes undergo random recombination of their T
cell receptor genes. Some of the resulting T cell receptors
will be specific for pathogens and others for normal selfantigens. The role of the thymus is to select for cells that

recognize self-MHC, and negatively select those T cells
that recognize self-antigen with self-MHC.
The thymus is a gland with two lobes, located in the
anterior part of the superior mediastinum, posterior to
the sternum and anterior to the great vessels and upper
part of the heart. It can extend superiorly into the root of
the neck and inferiorly into the anterior mediastinum. It
receives its blood supply from the inferior thyroid and
internal thoracic arteries. Each lobe is surrounded by
a capsule and is divided into multiple lobules by fibrous
septa known as trabeculae. Each lobule is divided into
two regions (Fig. 10.18):
• An outer cortex
• An inner medulla.
Immature thymocytes (T cell progenitors) enter the
thymus gland via the cortex, where they rapidly proliferate and rearrange their T cell receptor genes. They then

migrate towards the medulla where they encounter specialized epithelial cells. These cells express MHC class I
and class II molecules. T cells that are able to bind selfMHC to some extent will proliferate, resulting in positive selection. The thymic epithelial cells have a unique
mechanism for expressing many of the body’s proteins
(e.g. insulin) and peptides from these proteins are displayed on MHC class I and class II molecules. T cells
which recognize this self-antigen can be forced to undergo apoptosis—so-called negative selection. A much
smaller and more mature group of thymocytes survives
to enter the medulla. Thymocytes continue to mature in
the medulla and eventually leave the thymus, via postcapillary venules, as mature, antigen-specific, immunocompetent T cells. In total, only 1–5% of thymocytes in
the thymus reach maturity, the remainder undergoing
programmed cell death (apoptosis). The T cells which

and are phagocytosed by
macrophages.

T lymphocytes

Embryological origin of the thymus

Functions of different T cell phenotypes

The human embryonic thymus develops from the third
pharyngeal pouch during week 4 or 5 of gestation
(Fig. 10.19).
The thymus gland is formed by week 8, and is fully
differentiated and producing viable lymphocytes by
week 17. The third pharyngeal pouch also gives rise to
the parathyroid glands. Lymphoid stem cells are produced by the fetal liver and spleen, and by bone marrow
from 6 months’ gestation.

The different types of T cell can be differentiated by
cell-surface molecules and function. There are two different types of T cell receptor (TCR), which have different functions. T cells expressing ab-TCRs account for at
least 95% of circulatory T cells. They become cytotoxic,
helper or suppressor cells and, unless specified otherwise, account for all the T cells mentioned in this
book. T cells expressing a gd-TCR are present at mucosal surfaces and their specificity is biased towards certain bacterial and viral antigens. Some gd-T cells can
recognize antigen independently of an APC. These
T cells are usually cytotoxic in their actions. They differ
from NK cells because they detect antigen rather than
the presence or absence of MHC class I molecules.
They are part of the adaptive system, because their action is specific and shows evidence of immunological
memory.

Thymic hypoplasia
Although it continues to grow until puberty, the relative
size of the thymus gland decreases over this period.
After puberty there is a real reduction in size and, by
adulthood, it is composed largely of adipose tissue
and produces far fewer T lymphocytes. This means it
is harder for adults to recover from immunological
damage caused by, for example, HIV or immunosuppressive drugs.
DiGeorge syndrome is an autosomal dominant condition,
caused by a deletion on chromosome 22 (22q11.2).
Defects in the third and fourth pharyngeal pouch can
result in thymic aplasia, heart defects,
hypoparathyroidism and cleft palate, among other
anomalies. Thymic aplasia leads to an absence of
circulating T cells and a reduction in cell-mediated
immunity. The mother provides no passiveT cell immunity
after birth and infants present early with infections.

104

T helper cells
T helper (Th) cells play a key role in the development of
the immune response:
• They determine the epitopes that are targeted by the
immune system via their interactions with antigen
in conjunction with class II MHC molecules on
APCs
• They determine the nature of the immune response
directed against target antigens, e.g. cytotoxic T cell
response or antibody response
• They are required for normal B cell function (see
p. 97).

Th0 cells arise as a result of initial short-term stimulation of naı̈ve T cells; they are capable of secreting a broad
spectrum of cytokines. Prolonged stimulation results in
the emergence of Th1 and Th2 subsets. The cytokines released by the Th1 and Th2 subsets modulate one another’s secretion. The different cytokine profiles of the
Th1, Th2 and Th17 subsets reflect their different immunological functions (Fig. 10.20).
Most immune responses involve more than one
subset of T cells. For example staphylococcus (an extracellular bacterium) stimulates both Th2 and Th17
responses. On the other hand, some responses
become very polarized. For example, the immune
system relies almost exclusively on Th1 cells to respond to mycobacterium tuberculosis, an intracellular
pathogen.
The fifth type of helper T cell has two main regulatory
roles. The first is to dampen down the immune response
once an infection has been brought under control. The
second is to regulate self-reactive T cells which have
managed to escape negative selection in the thymus.
Their action is via cytokines, including transforming
growth factor-b (TGF-b) and IL-10.

Development of T cells
T cell precursors are produced in the bone marrow and
are transported to the thymus for development and maturation. The aim of T cell development and maturation
is to select T cells with receptors that can recognize
foreign antigens in conjunction with self-MHC. Cells
with non-functioning receptors or that are strongly
self-reactive are destroyed (Fig. 10.21).

Positive selection
Positive selection occurs in the thymic cortex. T cells
that are capable of binding self-MHC are allowed to
live, i.e. they are positively selected for, and T cells that
do not recognize self-MHC die. Furthermore, T cells
that interact with MHC class I lose their CD4 (they
are now CD8 T cells) and T cells that interact with
MHC class II lose their CD8 (becoming CD4 T cells);
this is MHC restriction. T cells that do not interact with
the MHC molecules undergo apoptosis, as they do not
receive a protective signal as a result of the TCR–MHC
interaction.

Negative selection
T cells that are positively selected, but have high affinity
for MHC molecules and self-antigen, undergo negative
selection. Because thymic epithelial cells express many
different proteins from around the body, this mechanism destroys most self-reactive T cells.

T cell activation
þ

Most cytotoxic T (Tc) lymphocytes are CD8 and recognize antigen in conjunction with class I MHC molecules
(endogenous antigen). They lyse target cells via the
same mechanisms as NK cells (see p. 84).

T cells are activated by interactions between the TCR and
peptide bound to MHC. Activation also requires a
‘second message’ from the antigen-presenting cell. This
process is shown in Figure 10.22.

the genes encoding the TCR will produce three cell lines: (1)
CD4þ ab-TCR; (2) CD8þ ab-TCR; and (3) CD4–CD8– gd-TCR.
The b- or g-chain genes rearrange first. If a functional b-chain is
formed, both CD4 and CD8 are upregulated and the a-chain
gene rearranges. The resultant T cells are positively selected if
their TCR is functional, but negatively selected if they react too
strongly. The majority of thymocytes will undergo apoptosis due
to positive or negative selection. MHC, major histocompatibility
complex.

Once T cells are activated they produce a wide range
of molecules with several functions. These are primarily
cytokines, which may be pro- or anti-inflammatory
(see Fig. 10.20) or involved in activation of other
immune cells.

Superantigens
T cells can be activated in a non-specific fashion by
superantigens. Superantigens cross-link between the
V-b domain of the TCR and a class II MHC molecule

Cell-mediated immunity
on an antigen-presenting cell. Cross-linking is independent of the peptide binding cleft but depends on the
framework region of the V-b domain. This means that
one superantigen is able to activate about 5% of T cells,
far more than normal antigen. An example of a T cell
superantigen is staphylococcal enterotoxin.
Superantigens result in polyclonal activation effectively ‘crowding-out’ the specific, protective immune response. A consequence of polyclonal activation can be
autoimmune disease. Superantigen can also result in
the deletion of a large number of T cells by inducing
negative selection in the thymus.

10

Toxic shock syndrome (TSS)
Toxins produced by staphylococci and streptococci can
act as superantigens, producing the clinical picture of
‘toxic shock syndrome’, where a seemingly innocuous
stimulus such as a graze can lead to fever, a diffuse
macular rash, hypotension and shock. There is an
association between tampon use and Staph. aureus TSS,
with many known deaths as a result. Management of TSS
involves transfer to hospital, aggressive fluid resuscitation,
as well as ventilatory and renal support. Antibiotic therapy
should cover Staph. aureus and Staph. pyogenes.

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Outline the response of tissue to infection or injury
• Understand the molecular and physiological features of acute and chronic inflammation
• Explain the immune response to viruses, bacteria and protozoa.

RESPONSE TO TISSUE DAMAGE
Inflammation is a non-specific response evoked by tissue injury. The aims of the process are:
• Removal of the causative agent, e.g. microbes or toxins
• Removal of dead tissue
• Replacement of dead tissue with normal tissue, or
scar formation.

HINTS AND TIPS
Inflammation is defined clinically by four cardinal signs:
rubor, dolor, calor and tumor (redness, pain, heat and
swelling). Histologically inflammation is defined by the
presence of oedema and white cells in a tissue.

Acute inflammation
Acute inflammation is the immediate response to cell
injury. It is of short duration (a few hours to a few days)
and is triggered by a range of insults, including chemical
or thermal damage and infection. Infection is sensed by
resident macrophages, through Toll-like receptors,
which then release cytokines, attracting neutrophils to
the site of infection. In other instances, inflammation
is initiated by resident mast cells, which tend to attract
eosinophils. Once inflammation is initiated, several
changes occur in vascular endothelium to allow attachment and extravasation of leucocytes—primarily neutrophils but also monocytes and lymphocytes.
Attachment and extravasation require the presence of
surface molecules on both the endothelium and leucocytes. The acute inflammation process is mediated by
many different chemicals.

Vascular changes
Tissue injury results in the release of chemical mediators
(cytokines, chemokines and histamine) that act on local
blood vessels. The main changes that occur are:
• Vasodilatation: causing increased blood flow and
therefore redness and heat
• Slowing of the circulation and increased vascular
permeability: formation of an inflammatory exudate
results in swelling
• Entry of inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils,
into the tissues.

Leucocyte extravasation
Neutrophils adhere to the vessel wall and then pass between the endothelial cells into the tissues. This is a
multistep process involving:
• Margination: adherence of neutrophils to the vessel
wall. There are two phases to margination. The first
is ‘tethering and rolling’ and the second is ‘activation
and strengthening’. Neutrophils adhere to vessel
walls via cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). CAMs
can be members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, the selectin family or the integrin family
• Diapedesis (extravasation): neutrophils move between endothelial cells into the tissue
• Chemotaxis: due to the release of several chemotactic agents (Fig. 11.1).
Integrin molecules allow immune cells to target specific sites (a process known as homing). To interact successfully with the extracellular matrix, neutrophils must
express b1-integrins, a set of adhesion molecules that
can bind to collagen and laminin.
Once neutrophils reach a site of inflammation, they
phagocytose foreign particles and release enzymes (see
Chapter 9). Leucocytes can release proteases and metabolites during chemotaxis and phagocytosis, which are

109

The functioning immune system
Fig. 11.1 Overview of the mediators of acute inflammation

The coagulation system
The coagulation system is activated at sites of vascular
injury (see p. 63). Fibrinopeptides produced during coagulation are chemotactic for neutrophils and increase
vascular permeability. Thrombin also promotes fibroblast proliferation and leucocyte adhesion.

potentially harmful to the host. Neutrophils die during
this process, creating pus.

Molecular mediators of inflammation
A variety of chemical mediators are produced during an
inflammatory response. They usually have short halflives and are rapidly inactivated by a variety of systems.
A summary of their actions is given in Figure 11.1.

Cell membrane phospholipid metabolites
Prostaglandins (PGs) and leukotrienes (LTs) are derived
from the metabolism of arachidonic acid. Plateletactivating factor (PAF) is also an important mediator.

Cytokines
Cytokines such as IL-8 and IL-1, and tumour necrosis
factor-a (TNF-a) act to:
• Induce expression of CAMs on the endothelium,
thus enhancing leucocyte adhesion
• Attract neutrophils to the area of injury
• Induce prostacyclin (PGI2) production
• Induce PAF synthesis
• Mediate the development of the acute-phase
response
• Stimulate fibroblast proliferation and increase collagen synthesis.

The complement system
This is discussed in Chapter 9.

The kinin system
Bradykinin is released following activation of the kinin
system by clotting factor XII. Bradykinin increases vascular permeability and mediates pain.

110

The fibrinolytic system

There are several possible outcomes resulting from acute
inflammation. These include:
•
•
•
•

Regrowth and resolution
Healing by collagenous scar formation
Abscess formation
Chronic inflammation.

Chronic inflammation
Chronic inflammation arises:
• When the causative agent cannot be eliminated and
antigenic persistence occurs. This may be due to deficiencies in the host response or certain microorganisms, e.g. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which have
evolved to evade the immune response
• As a result of persistent autoimmune reactions, e.g.
systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. The body is, of course, incapable of
clearing autoantigens.
The key cells of chronic inflammation are macrophages,
lymphocytes and plasma cells. This is in marked contrast
to acute inflammation, which is characterized primarily
by a neutrophilic inflammation. Ongoing inflammation
is associated with tissue destruction, but also healing.
In chronic inflammation, macrophage numbers are
increased because they are recruited by chemotactic factors (e.g. platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and
C5a) and are prevented from leaving by migration inhibition factor. Macrophage secretory products mediate
characteristic features of chronic inflammation:
• TNF probably has a key role in maintaining chronic
inflammation at a local level. When it is secreted at
high levels it has systemic effects, including weight
loss (through fat catabolism and appetite inhibition) and fatigue
• Tissue damage via proteases and oxygen radicals
• Revascularization via angiogenic factors
• Fibroblast migration and proliferation via growth
factors (e.g. PDGF) and cytokines (IL-2, TNF-a)

Response to tissue damage

inflammation. Macrophages can be
activated by T cells or by nonimmune
mechanisms. Activated macrophages
persist at sites of chronic inflammation
because of persistent stimulation.
They release a number of molecules,
which produce the characteristic
features of chronic inflammation.
Macrophages act as antigenpresenting cells to T cells, which can
then activate further macrophages.

Lymphocytes and plasma cells are also present at the
site of inflammation. In the case of chronic infections,
both macrophages and T cells are required to control infection. An overview of chronic inflammation is given in
Figure 11.2.

Inflammation in disease
Inflammation is intended to protect the host but can,
under certain circumstances, prove destructive. Antigenic persistence results in the continued activation
and accumulation of macrophages. This leads to the formation of epithelioid cells (slightly modified macrophages) and granuloma formation (Fig. 11.3).

TNF-a is needed for granuloma formation and maintenance. Interferon-g (IFN-g), released by activated T
cells, causes macrophage transformation into epithelioid
and multinucleate giant cells (which arise from the fusion
of several macrophages). The granuloma is surrounded
by a cuff of lymphocytes and the migration of fibroblasts
results in increased collagen synthesis. Caseous necrotic
areas (dry, ‘cheese-like’ white mass of degenerated tissue)
might be present in the centre of a granuloma.
The nature of the damaging stimulus determines the
type of granuloma formed. Inert particles (e.g. silica in
the lungs) are predominantly surrounded by macrophages. Microorganisms such as M. tuberculosis (which
causes tuberculosis) induce a persistent, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response, resulting in granuloma
formation in the lung and possibly leading to cavitation.
The granuloma formed is characterized by focal accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages. Phagocytosis of
mycobacteria is not usually effective because the

Responses directed against free virus are considered
to be the most important in vivo, and antibodies are,
therefore, important early in the course of infection to
prevent spread of virus between cells.

Interferon
Interferons (IFNs) are produced by virally infected cells.
IFN-a and IFN-b act on neighbouring uninfected cells
by inhibiting transcription and translation of viral proteins. IFN-g activates macrophages and natural killer
(NK) cells and enhances the adaptive immune response
by upregulating expression of major histocompatibility
complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules.

microorganism can survive and multiply within macrophages. The granulomatous response, although preventing spread of infection, is harmful to the host.

IMMUNE RESPONSE
TO PATHOGENS

Immune response to viral infection
Viruses do not always kill host cells but budding and release of new viral particles often causes the cells to lyse.
The immune system can act to prevent infection or the
spread of infection, or to eliminate an intracellular target once infection has occurred.

Humoral immunity to viruses
The humoral response is involved in preventing entry
to, and viral replication within, cells.

Antibody
Antibodies can bind to free virus and prevent its attachment and entry to a cell; this is referred to as neutralization of virus particles (e.g. IgG neutralizes the hepatitis B
virus on entering the blood stream and IgA neutralizes
the influenza virus entering the nasal mucosa). Antibodies can also bind to viral proteins expressed on
the surface of infected cells. Antibody bound to cells
can initiate antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and complement activation, and acts as an
opsonin for phagocytes.

112

Cell-mediated mechanisms are important for eliminating a virus once infection is established. The cells involved include:
• NK cells: these are cytotoxic for virus-infected cells
and participate in ADCC
• Cytotoxic CD8þ T cells: viral peptides are presented on
the cell surface in association with class I MHC molecules. CD8þ T cells can destroy these infected cells
• CD4þ T cells: T helper cells are required for the generation of antibody and cytotoxic T cell responses,
and the recruitment and activation of macrophages
(Th1 help).
An overview of the immune response to viruses is
given in Figure 11.4.

Examples of viral infection and strategies
to avoid immunity
Viral infections are common and most are self-limiting.
Some, particularly those that can evade the immune response, can be chronic and are potentially fatal (e.g. HIV
[see p. 129] and hepatitis B). Different viruses use different strategies to evade the host’s immune response:
• Antigenic shift and drift: these are mechanisms of
antigenic variation, e.g. influenza
• Polymorphism: e.g. adenovirus, rhinovirus
• Latent virus: e.g. herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella
zoster
• Modulation of major histocompatibility complex
(MHC) expression: cytomegalovirus (CMV), adenovirus, Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), HSV, HIV
• Infection of lymphocytes, e.g. HIV, measles, CMV,
EBV.
Antigenic variation, either by mutation or polymorphism, circumvents immunological memory because
the virus expresses different immunological targets over
time. By becoming latent, a virus ‘hides’ from the immune system. A latent virus often reactivates when the
immune system is compromised, suggesting that there
must be some interaction between the immune system

virally infected cells either by detecting the absence of MHC class I molecules or by antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity
(ADCC). Macrophages phagocytose opsonized free virus and cell fragments, and produce further interferon. CD8þ (cytotoxic)

and the virus even when it is latent. Mechanisms that
prevent normal effector functions from being carried
out primarily involve down regulation of MHC class I
expression. However, viruses can also interfere with
IFN or produce inhibitory cytokines. Infection of lymphocytes, and their death, reduces the ability of the immune system to combat viral infection.

extracellular or intracellular.

Extracellular bacteria

Bacteria are prokaryotic organisms. Their cell membrane is surrounded by a peptidoglycan cell wall. Many
bacteria also have a capsule of large, branched polysaccharides. Bacteria attach to cells via surface pili, but only

Bacteria activate complement via the lectin or alternative pathways. Activated complement products play a
role in the elimination of bacteria, especially C3b (an
opsonin), C3a and C5a (anaphylatoxins that recruit leucocytes), and the membrane attack complex (MAC),
which can perforate the outer lipid bilayer of Gramnegative bacteria.

Humoral immunity to intracellular bacteria
The humoral mechanisms that are employed against extracellular bacteria will be used to try to prevent bacteria

• sIgA binds to bacteria and prevents their binding to
epithelial cells; if this response is sufficient, sIgA can
prevent the pathogen from entering the body
• Antibody neutralizes bacterial toxins
• Antibody activates complement
• Antibody acts as an opsonin.

Cell-mediated immunity to intracellular
bacteria

CD4þ T cell help is required for the generation of the
antibody response (Th2 help).

• Macrophages attempt to phagocytose the bacteria. If
the organisms persist, chronic inflammation will ensue. This can lead to delayed (type IV) hypersensitivity (see p. 119)
• Cells infected with bacteria can activate NK cells,
which cause cytotoxicity and can activate macrophages
• CD4þ T cells release cytokines that activate macrophages (Th1 help)
• CD8þ T cells recognize antigens presented in conjunction with class I MHC molecules on the surface
of infected cells and lyse these cells.

Cell-mediated immunity to extracellular
bacteria
Phagocytic, particularly neutrophils, cells kill most bacteria; C3b and antibody enhance phagocytosis. Bacterial
antigens are processed and presented in conjunction
with class II MHC to CD4þ T cells. Th17 T cells recruit
and activate neutrophils to the site of an extracellular
bacterial infection.

Examples of infection and bacterial
strategies to avoid immunity
Bacterial strategies to avoid the immune response must
allow one of the following:

Lysis
Lysosome

Cell-mediated immunity is very important in the defence against intracellular bacterial infections, such as
those caused by M. tuberculosis:

• Prevent phagocytosis. This is achieved in a number of
ways. Some bacteria have capsules that inhibit phagocytosis, e.g. Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus
spp. Others kill phagocytes with toxins or neutralize
IgG, preventing opsonization, e.g. Staphylococcus spp.
• Allow survival within phagocytes, e.g. M. tuberculosis,
Mycobacterium leprae, Toxoplasma spp.
• Prevent complement activation e.g. Staphylococcus
spp., Streptococcus spp., Haemophilus spp., Pseudomonas spp.
• Avoid recognition by the immune system. This can
be done through polymorphism, e.g. Streptococcus
pneumoniae, Salmonella typhi.
Like viruses, bacteria can be highly polymorphic.
Bacteria of the same species can appear to be entirely different to the immune system.

Immune response to protozoal
infection
Protozoa are microscopic, single-celled organisms.
Fewer than 20 types of protozoa infect humans, although malaria, trypanosomes and Leishmania cause
significant morbidity and mortality. Protozoa cause intracellular infection, have marked antigenic variation

Immune response to pathogens
and are often immunosuppressive. They have complex
lifecycles, with several different stages, and, therefore,
present the immune system with a variety of challenges.
Protozoal infection is often chronic, as the immune system is not very efficient at dealing with these organisms.
Most of the pathology of protozoal disease is caused by
the immune response.

Humoral immunity against protozoa
Complement and antibody are important during the
extracellular stage of infection. This opsonizes the protozoa and can cause lysis or prevent infection.

Cell-mediated immunity against protozoa
• Phagocytosis by macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils is an important part of the immune response against protozoa
• CD4þ T cells are activated in response to protozoal
infection. T helper 1 cytokines, e.g. IL-2, IFN-g,
TNF-b, are considered protective
• Cytotoxic CD8þ T cells are important in destroying protozoa that replicate within cells, e.g. the sporozoite
stage of Plasmodium falciparum (which causes malaria)
• NK cells and mast cells are often activated in protozoal
infection.

Examples of protozoal infection and
evasion of the immune response
Protozoa have good mechanisms to prevent the initiation of an immune response. Strategies include:
• Escape into the cytoplasm following phagocytosis,
e.g. Trypanosoma cruzi
• Prevention of complement actions, e.g. Leishmania
spp.
• Gene switching to create antigen variation, e.g.
trypanosomes
• Immunosuppression, e.g. trypanosomes.

11

Immune response to worms
Multicellular parasites and worms pose a different problem to the immune system, as they are too large to be
phagocytosed by macrophages and neutrophils. These
worms tend to live on mucosal surfaces, and the immune
system tries to dispose of these parasites by facilitating
their expulsion. The immune system does this by secreting toxic chemicals onto mucosal surfaces, stimulating an
increase in mucus secretion and smooth muscle contraction, which together result in expulsion of the worm.
Mast cells are stationed in tissues and have a similar
sentinel purpose, with respect to worm infection, as that
performed by macrophages for other types of infection.
Mast cells contain preformed granules and, when they
recognize parasitic infection through cross-linkage of
IgE or possibly Toll-like receptors, they degranulate, releasing their preformed granules and other rapidly synthesized chemicals onto the parasite. They also release
proinflammatory cytokines that recruit eosinophils
and basophils.
Mast cell preformed granules contain:
• Histamine: causes smooth muscle in the walls of the
gut to contract (expel the worm) and smooth muscle
of blood vessels to relax
• Proteolytic enzymes: activate the complement system including anaphylatoxins.
The rapidly synthesized chemicals include prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both of which cause vasodilatation and contraction of smooth muscle in gut and
bronchial walls.
Eosinophils secrete chemicals similar to those secreted by mast cells, excluding histamine. In addition
they secrete:
• Peroxidase that generates hypochlorous acid
• A cationic protein which damages the worm’s outer
layers and paralyses its nervous system
• A basic protein that also attacks the outer layers of
the worm.
Mast cells can be activated by IgE and, although this
probably evolved to deal with worm infections, it mediates allergy (type I hypersensitivity).

Objectives
You should be able to:
• Describe which processes lead to each form of hypersensitivity
• Outline the process of autoimmunity and how this leads to disease
• Explain the causes and features of immune deficiency
• Describe the immunological investigations of hypersensitivity, autoimmunity and immune deficiency.

HYPERSENSITIVITY

Concepts of hypersensitivity
Hypersensitivity is where there is an excessive and,
therefore, inappropriate inflammatory response to any
antigen. This inflammatory response results in tissue
damage.
Hypersensitivity can occur in response to:
• An infection that cannot be cleared, e.g. tuberculosis
• A normally harmless exogenous substance, e.g.
pollen
• An autoantigen, e.g. DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
Hypersensitivity reactions have been classified, by
Gell and Coombs, into four types: I, II, III and IV. Types
I, II and III are antibody-mediated; type IV is cellmediated. In this system, the different types of hypersensitivity are classified by their time of onset after
exposure to antigen.

Type I hypersensitivity (immediate
hypersensitivity, allergy)
Type I hypersensitivity is mediated by IgE, with resultant
and immediate degranulation of mast cells and
basophils.
Overproduction of IgE in response to an innocuous
environmental antigen occurs in allergy (see p. 120). Individuals with a greater inherited tendency towards type
I hypersensitivity reactions are said to be atopic.
Type I hypersensitivity reactions require an initial antigen exposure in order to sensitize the immune system.
When atopic individuals are exposed to an allergen they
produce lots of IgE specific for that antigen. Mast cells
have membrane receptors specific for the Fc portion
of IgE, so that mast cells become coated in IgE. The
immune system in now said to be sensitized to the

allergen. Subsequent exposure to the same antigen,
cross-linking mast cell surface IgE, results in release of
preformed mediators of inflammation (degranulation).
Short-lived basophils with IgE receptors are recruited
and also degranulate in response to the antigen.
Mast cells and basophils release their contents within
minutes of exposure to an allergen; this is the early
phase response. The late phase response, mediated by
eosinophils, responds to the same stimulus. This delay
occurs as eosinophils have to be mobilized from the
bone marrow. Clinically this can manifest itself as a further deterioration in symptoms several hours after initial exposure.
The immune mechanisms of type I reactions are
illustrated in Fig. 12.1. Examples of type I reactions
include:
• Allergic rhinitis (hay fever): pollens
• Allergic asthma: house-dust mite
• Systemic anaphylaxis: penicillin, peanuts or insect
venom.
HINTS AND TIPS
Atopy is a genetic predisposition to produce IgE in
response to many common, naturally occurring
allergens. It has a prevalence of 10–30%. Atopic
patients can suffer from multiple allergies. Atopy
tends to run in families, however the genetic basis
of atopy is not known.

When diagnosing type I hypersensitivity, the most
important source of information is the history and
the timing of events as the effects of allergy occur
rapidly—within minutes. Allergy can result in a wide
spectrum of symptoms, the most severe being anaphylaxis. This occurs as a consequence of increased vascular
permeability and dilatation, causing large amounts of

fluid to move out of the circulation and into tissues,
leading to a rapid fall in blood pressure. Allergy most
often produces symptoms local to the site of allergen
entry:
• Skin: results in an urticarial rash or eczema
• Nasal mucosa: results in rhinitis, e.g. hay fever
• Lungs: can result in asthma.
For an allergic reaction to occur, IgE against that specific allergen needs to be present. This can be tested for
using skin prick testing (this is not advisable for severe
allergy) where a small amount of the suspected allergen
is inoculated into the skin together with a positive and a
negative control. A positive reaction will result in an
itchy red lesion with a weal at the centre; the reaction
is strongest after 15–20 minutes, indicating that the patient produces IgE to the tested allergen. Serum IgE can
also be directly measured using a blood test.

of type II hypersensitivity reactions.
Antibody bound to cells (either
antibody to foreign cells or
autoantibody) results in cell death via
(1) complement, (2) phagocytes or

antibody-dependent cell-mediated
cytotoxicity.

A skin prick test is a useful way of assessing whether a
person has IgE to different allergens (see Fig. 12.2). The
response should always be compared to a histamine
control.

Type II hypersensitivity
Type II (or antibody-mediated) hypersensitivity occurs
when antibody specific for cell surface antigens is produced. Cell destruction can then result via:
• Complement activation
• Antibody-dependent cell-mediated
(ADCC)
• Phagocytosis.

The immune mechanisms of type II hypersensitivity
reactions are summarized in Fig. 12.3.

Hypersensitivity
Examples of type II reactions in which complement is
activated and cells destroyed are:
• Incompatible blood transfusions
• Haemolytic disease of the newborn
• Autoimmune haemolytic anaemias.
Some foreign antigens are too small to stimulate an
immune response themselves, but need to bind to a
host protein first. These antigens are called haptens.
An example of a hapten involved in type II hypersensitivity is penicillin-induced haemolysis. Penicillin is too
small to induce antibodies alone, but binds to the surface of red cells. It now acts as a hapten, inducing IgG
production. The IgG then binds to the red cells, which
leads to their destruction in the spleen.
Several diseases are caused by antibody directed
against cell surface receptors, which can stimulate or
block the receptor. In Graves’ disease, stimulating antibodies are directed against the receptor for thyroid stimulating hormone. In myasthenia gravis, antibodies are
directed against the acetylcholine receptor. They can destroy the receptor or cause lysis due to complement
activation.

Type III hypersensitivity (immune
complex)
Antibodies react to soluble (free) antigen by forming
lattices of antibody and antigen, called an immune
complex. This is a physiological response and is useful,
for example, in the removal of bacterial exotoxin. The
immune complexes are broken up by complement and
transported to the spleen by red blood cells (RBCs)
where they are phagocytosed. If there is a rapid influx
in antigen that overwhelms these coping strategies,
then a type III hypersensitivity reaction occurs
(Fig. 12.4).

Deposited antigen–antibody
(immune) complex

HINTS AND TIPS
Type II hypersensitivity is based on antibodies (IgG)
binding to cell-surface antigens, resulting in cell
destruction. However, type III hypersensitivity occurs
when antibodies bind free antigen. They form immune
complexes that can cause tissue damage if present in
excessive amounts.

Type III hypersensitivity can occur locally or systemically. Examples of local type III hypersensitivity
include:
• Arthus reaction: intradermal or subcutaneous injection of antigen into a recipient with high levels of appropriate circulating antibody produces localized
immune complexes that activate complement and
generate acute inflammation
• Farmer’s lung: inhalation of mould spores
• Pigeon fancier’s disease: repeated inhalation of dried
pigeon faeces.
Systemic type III hypersensitivity reactions occur
when there is a large amount of antibody present
throughout the body; this can occur when antigens such
as antibiotics are injected into the circulation, or if the
antigen is a self-antigen (an autoimmune reaction) such
as occurs in SLE. Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis
is another important, systemic type III hypersensivity reaction. Antigen produced by b-haemolytic streptococcus,
often after causing a sore throat, forms antigen-antibody
complexes. These complexes produce inflammation in
the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis).
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
In immune complex disease in general, and SLE in
particular, immune complexes precipitate out in the
glomeruli, skin and joints, leading to characteristic
clinical signs.

phagocytes are deposited in blood vessels or the tissues resulting

Upon first contact with antigen, a subset of CD4þ T
helper (Th) cells is activated and clonally expanded (this
takes 1–2 weeks). Upon subsequent encounter with the
same antigen, sensitized Th cells secrete cytokines.
These attract and activate macrophages, which account
for more than 95% of the cells involved. Activated macrophages have increased phagocytic ability and can destroy pathogens more effectively. The type IV reaction
peaks at 48–72 hours after contact with the antigen
(time taken for the recruitment and activation of the
macrophages) and is therefore known as delayed-type

The tuberculin skin test can be used to determine

An intradermal injection of purified protein derivative
(PPD) is given to the individual. Previous exposure to
M. tuberculosis or bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccination results in a positive response. This is apparent as
a firm, red (due to the intense infiltration of macrophages) lesion at the injection site 48–72 hours after
the injection. The skin lesions in both contact dermatitis
and tuberculin testing are composed of macrophages
and T cells.
A summary of the four types of hypersensitivity is
shown in Fig. 12.6.

hypersensitivity. An overview of the immune mechanisms involved is given in Fig. 12.5.
Type IV reactions are important for the clearance of
intracellular pathogens. However, if antigen persists,
the response can be detrimental to the individual, as
the lytic products of the activated macrophages can
damage healthy tissues. Examples of antigens that
induce a type IV response are:
• Contact dermatitis to antigens such as nickel
• Intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis.
As with type I reactions skin testing is used to detect
type IV reactions. Instead of a skin prick, however, patch
testing is used to diagnose antigens causing delayed hypersensitivity in contact dermatitis. A selection of sensitizing antigens are normally tested at the same time.
They are usually placed in a grid pattern on the upper
back and then dressed. Patients are then seen, sometimes more than once, over the next 48–72 hours to assess the response. The response varies from no response
to an extreme reaction.

ALLERGY
Allergy is due to immediate hypersensitivity reactions to
exogenous antigens (known as allergens), mediated by
IgE. Allergic symptoms usually result from degranulation of mast cells, mediated by the cross-linking of
IgE by allergen. Allergic conditions are therefore type I
hypersensitivity reactions. The symptoms of different
allergies affect different tissues and can be local or
generalized.

Asthma
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the
airways, characterized by reversible airflow obstruction. The airways become hyper-responsive and exaggerated bronchoconstriction follows a wide variety
of non-immunological stimuli, e.g. exercise or cold
air. The symptoms of asthma are cough, wheeze,
chest tightness and shortness of breath. Asthma is a
common disease and is diagnosed in 5–10% of
children. The incidence has risen over the last few decades, particularly in more economically developed
countries.

Asthma is diagnosed by a reversal in airway obstruction (measured by peak expiratory flow rate, or ‘peak
flow’) of  15%, either spontaneously or following
the administration of an inhaled short-acting b2adrenoreceptor agonist (such as salbutamol). Advice
including avoidance of triggers and how to manage an
attack should be given. Short-acting b2-adrenoreceptor
agonists are used as the treatment for short-term improvement of symptoms, although inhaled steroids and other
immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory drugs are used
prophylactically to prevent asthma attacks. This is as
per the British Thoracic Society’s step-wise approach.

Allergic rhinitis
Nasal congestion, watery nasal discharge and sneezing
occur after exposure to allergen. The most common allergens are grass, flower, weed or tree pollens, which
cause a seasonal rhinitis (hay fever), and house-dust
mite faeces, which can cause a more perennial rhinitis.
Allergic attacks usually last for a few hours and are often
accompanied by itching and watering of the eyes. Skin
prick tests can identify the allergen.
The most important treatment is topical (nasal) steroids; alternatives or adjuncts include antihistamines or
mast cell stabilizers such as sodium cromoglicate.
Avoidance of allergens is advised but is often difficult.

Atopic/allergic eczema
Eczema or dermatitis can be caused by an allergic response. Dermatitis means skin inflammation. There are
several types of dermatitis, including allergic (atopic)
eczema (type I hypersensitivity reaction) and contact dermatitis (a type IV hypersensitivity reaction). Contact
dermatitis can be diagnosed by patch testing and treatment is primarily by avoidance of the antigen (e.g. nickel).
Atopic eczema is most commonly the result of exposure to pollen or house-dust mite faeces. Common allergens are shown in Fig. 12.7. About 10% of children are
diagnosed with eczema. Eczema commonly affects the
flexural creases and the fronts of the wrist and ankles.
In infancy and adulthood the face and trunk are often
involved. The skin lesions are itchy, red, sometimes vesicular and might be dry. Because of itching, the skin is
often excoriated, which can lead to lichenification

(thickening of the skin). Eczema is often complicated
by superinfection with bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus.
Recently, mutations in a gene encoding for Filaggrin
(a protein that binds to keratin fibres in epithelial cells)
has been associated with atopic eczema.
The diagnosis of atopic eczema is usually clinical. Total serum IgE, RAST for specific IgE and skin prick testing
with common allergens are occasionally performed to
confirm the diagnosis of atopic eczema. Treatment of
eczema is mainly topical, except in more severe cases,
when systemic steroids and immunosuppressants are
used. Therapies include:
•
•
•
•
•

Emollients: moisturizes dry skin and reduces itching
Topical steroids: anti-inflammatory
Topical antibiotics or antiseptics: in infected eczema
Oral antihistamine: reduces itching
Ciclosporin: resistant cases might require immunosuppression.

Anaphylaxis
Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency and can be fatal.
However, it is rapidly reversible if treated properly.
A systemic response to an allergen that is either

121

Immune dysfunction
intravenous or rapidly absorbed can cause laryngeal occlusion and shock. Many allergens can cause anaphylaxis, but more common environmental causes
include bee stings and peanuts. Many cases of anaphylaxis take place in hospital where they can be triggered
by antibiotics or latex. The signs of anaphylaxis are principally those of shock. Signs include:
•
•
•
•

Hypotension with tachycardia
Warm peripheral temperature
Signs of airway obstruction
Laryngeal and facial oedema and urticaria (often
seen).

The management of anaphylaxis, as per the Resuscitation Council (UK) guidelines, should be known
by all medical professionals. The initial management
of anaphylaxis is resuscitation, i.e. attend to lifethreatening airway, breathing and/or circulatory problems. Allergens should be removed if possible, e.g. stop
drug infusion. Adrenaline (epinephrine) should be
given as soon as possible, intramuscularly (IM). The
dose for adults is 0.5 mL of 1:1000, and should be repeated after 5 minutes if there is no improvement.
Adrenaline should be given intravenously only by a
specialist and in environments where monitoring is
possible, and at a lower dose. An intravenous (IV) fluid
challenge of between 500 and 1000 mL should be
given next, to correct hypotension. Chloramphenamine (an anti-histamine) and hydrocortisone are also
given later in the management.

HINTS AND TIPS
Any patient that suffers from a proven or suspected
anaphylactic reaction should be seen in an allergy
clinic by a specialist. They should receive advice
regarding future attacks, as well as training on how to
administer intramuscular adrenaline. They should
carry a preloaded adrenaline syringe for such
occasions.

AUTOIMMUNITY

Prevention of autoimmunity
Autoimmunity is a state in which the body exhibits immunological reactivity to itself. ‘Self-tolerance’ is the generic term given to the mechanisms by which T and B
cells are prevented from responding to self. Because T
and B cells randomly recombine the genes for their receptors, there is a risk of producing receptors that will
react with self-antigen. These cells must be eliminated
to make the host tolerant to itself.

122

Central tolerance
Central tolerance is by negative selection—early clonal
deletion. T cells (in the thymus) and B cells (in the bone
marrow) are eliminated if they are self-reactive. Central
tolerance is not complete. Only the most self-reactive
lymphocytes are deleted, ensuring that a wide lymphocyte repertoire is maintained.

Peripheral tolerance
In the periphery, self-antigens do not generally elicit
an immune response. Several mechanisms prevent
self-reactive T cells from causing autoimmune disease,
including:
• Lack of the co-stimulatory molecules required for
T cell activation, e.g. CD40 or CD28 or low level
MHC expression
• Sequestration of the antigen behind a physical barrier, e.g. the testis
• T cells entering immune privileged sites undergo apoptosis (via Fas, transforming growth factor (TGF)-b
or IL-10). Immune privileged sites include the brain,
testis and the anterior chamber of the eye
• There is also a specialist population of regulatory
T cells (Tregs) which are able to suppress immune
responses to self.

Causes of autoimmunity—
breakdown of tolerance
If tolerance breaks down, autoimmunity can develop.
Tolerance can break down in the thymus (usually for
genetic reasons) or in the periphery (usually as a result
of environmental factors such as infection). Autoimmunity is multifactorial; a defect in at least one of
the regulatory mechanisms is required before disease
develops.

Role of human leucocyte antigen (HLA)—
genetic predisposition
Many autoimmune diseases have a familial component. The HLA haplotype is the main identified genetic factor. If an individual has inherited an HLA
allele that does not bind self-antigen with high affinity, reactive T cells are not deleted in the thymus. Certain HLA alleles are linked to specific autoimmune
processes, e.g. HLA-DR4 in rheumatoid arthritis, and
HLA-DQ8 in coeliac disease. However, a certain
HLA haplotype does not automatically result in the
development of an autoimmune disease; 95% of patients with ankylosing spondylitis have HLA-B27,
but only 5% of the population with HLA-B27 have
ankylosing spondylitis.

12

Autoimmunity

Role of infection—polyclonal activation
Many infections are able to activate T and B cells
in a non-specific fashion. This results in the proliferation of several T and B cell clones, which can produce
autoreactive autoantibody or mediate autoimmunity.

Role of infection—inappropriate MHC
expression
Infection stimulates antigen-presenting cells (APC), and
the upregulation of MHC class II molecules. This can
result in activation of autoreactive T cells.

Mechanisms of autoimmunity
Autoimmune diseases are hypersensitivity reactions in
which an exaggerated response is triggered by selfantigen. Autoimmune diseases can therefore be classified in the same way as hypersensitivity (excluding type
I hypersensitivity).

Antibody-mediated (type II
hypersensitivity reactions)
Antibodies that are specific for self-antigen bind to tissues or cells. Autoimmunity can result from a variety
of mechanisms, including:
• Opsonization: e.g. in autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, IgG binds to red blood cells, which are phagocytosed by macrophages in the spleen
• Complement activation: e.g. in severe autoimmune
haemolytic anaemia, IgM antibodies bound to red
blood cells activate complement, resulting in lysis
within the circulation.

Cell-mediated (type IV hypersensitivity
reactions)
These comprise autoimmune T cell responses, usually
by T helper and T cytotoxic cells. Examples include rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetes mellitus.
Clinically autoimmunity is divided into systemic
(connective tissue diseases and vasculitis) and organspecific conditions.

Systemic autoimmune diseases
Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)
Patients with SLE often have autoantibodies directed
against DNA, histone proteins, red blood cells, platelets, leucocytes and clotting factors. However, some
of these autoantibodies are also seen in other autoimmune conditions. The most specific for SLE is
anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA). Diagnosis
is by antinuclear antibody testing. It is most commonly diagnosed in women in the second or third
decade of life.
The aetiology is unknown but the vast array of autoantibodies present suggests a breakdown of self-tolerance. Genetic factors predispose to the disease. There
is an association with HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3, and with
deficiencies of complement proteins, especially C2 or
C4 (reduced complement levels result in a decreased
ability to clear immune complexes). Other relevant
aetiological factors include drugs such as hydralazine,
exposure to ultraviolet light and oestrogens.
Deposition of immune complexes leads to the various clinical features of SLE, including:
• Arthritis (deposition in joints)
• Rashes in sun-exposed areas
• Glomerulonephritis.

Neutralization and ADCC can also occur in response
to self-antigen.

SLE is treated with immunosuppression, steroids,
NSAIDs or other anti-inflammatory drugs.

Immune-complex-mediated
(type III hypersensitivity
reactions)

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Immune complexes are lattices of antigen and antibody.
They are usually cleared rapidly from the circulation,
but complexes that are not cleared trigger inflammation, particularly in blood vessels. An example of a type
III autoimmune disease is SLE. A consequence of the
presence of circulating immune complexes can be the
development of glomerulonephritis. Immune complexes deposit in the capillaries of the glomerular tufts
in the kidneys, resulting in renal failure. Immune complexes are also deposited at other sites, e.g. joints, skin
and brain.

HINTS AND TIPS
A typical feature of rheumatoid arthritis is joint pain and
stiffness on waking that lasts at least 30 minutes.

RA is a chronic systemic disease that primarily
involves the joints, resulting in inflammation of the
synovium and destruction of the articular cartilage
(Fig. 12.8). Initially, the disease affects the small joints
of the hands and feet symmetrically, later spreading to
the larger joints. RA affects approximately 1–2% of the

world’s population and is most common between the
ages of 30 and 55 years. The female:male ratio is 3:1.
Approximately 70% of RA patients carry either the
HLA-DR4 or HLA-DR1 haplotype. The immunopathogenesis of RA is outlined in Fig. 12.9.
A key event in RA is secretion of TNF by T cells and
macrophages, which causes joint inflammation and
erosion of bone. Once RA is suspected clinically,
prompt referral is essential to minimize morbidity associated with this chronic condition. Management is
based on early use of steroids and non-steroidal antiinflammatories (NSAIDs). Specific anti-rheumatic
drugs that modulate the immune response, known as
disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
are also used. These DMARDs usually target TNF (e.g.
infliximab and etanercept). The anti-B cell monoclonal
antibody rituximab is also used.
Rheumatoid arthritis – investigations
The blood tests in RA reflect its inflammatory nature;
CRP and ESR are raised, indicating an acute phase
response. Rheumatoid nodules are present when the
patient has made IgM anti-IgG autoantibodies
(rheumatoid factor) and indicate a poorer prognosis
than those who are rheumatoid factor negative. RF is
positive in approximately 80% of RA patients.

HINTS AND TIPS
Other autoantibodies associated with specific diseases
include:
• Anti-smooth muscle antibody—chronic autoimmune

• Anti-mitochondrial antibody (AMA)—primary biliary
cirrhosis.

Wegener’s granulomatosis
Wegener’s granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis (results from blood vessel inflammation) that affects the
nose, lungs and kidneys. The pathogenesis of Wegener’s
is linked to antibodies directed against proteinase-3,
an enzyme present in the cytoplasm of neutrophils
(c-ANCA). It causes neutrophils to become trapped in
vessel walls where they release proinflammatory cytokines and cause damage. The most severe complication

Organ- or cell-type-specific
autoimmune diseases
A summary of organ- or cell-type-specific diseases is
given in Fig. 12.13.

Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is the most common cause of
goitrous hypothyroidism (although there is also an
atrophic form). Antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells attack
the thyroid gland, leading to progressive destruction of
the epithelium. Marked lymphocytic infiltration
(mainly by B cells and CD4þ T cells) of the thyroid
gland is accompanied by migration of large numbers
of macrophages and plasma cells, resulting in the
formation of lymphoid follicles and germinal centres
within the thyroid. Due to unregulated T-helper
cell interaction with B cells, autoantibodies are
produced against thyroid antigens such as thyroid
peroxidase.
Middle-aged females are most commonly affected
(female:male ratio as high as 20:1). The disease is associated with the HLA-DR5 haplotype.

Graves’ disease
Graves’ disease is the commonest cause of hyperthyroidism. This arises as a result of IgG autoantibody production against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor
that actively stimulates the receptor, resulting in increased thyroxine production.

Immune deficiency

Although the cause of the deficiency can be primary
or secondary, the part of the immune system that is deficient will determine the sort of infection to which the
individual is predisposed. Antibody deficits result in extracellular bacterial infection. T cell deficiencies can result in viral, fungal and intracellular bacterial infections.

Primary immune deficiencies

Fig. 12.14 The eye signs associated with Graves’ disease: lid
retraction and exophthalmos.

Primary immunodeficiencies are intrinsic, usually
inherited, defects of the immune system. Different components of the immune system can be affected,
including:

Graves’ disease affects 1–2% of females. The female:
male ratio is 5:1. There is a strong association with HLADR3 in Caucasian people.

Insulin-dependent (type I) diabetes
mellitus
This disorder occurs due to destruction of the insulinproducing b cells of the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. One in 300 people in Europe and the USA is
affected. An autoimmune aetiology is suspected. Over
90% of patients with the disease carry either HLADR3 or HLA-DR4 or both. Viral infection is believed
to trigger T cells to invade the islets and attack b cells,
which are rapidly destroyed.
HINTS AND TIPS
Antibodies against islet antigens are transiently
produced and act as a marker for the process.
Antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase
(anti-GAD) are also used for diagnosis.

IMMUNE DEFICIENCY
Immune deficiency predisposes individuals to infections from opportunistic pathogens (those that do not
normally cause disease) as well as normal pathogens.

Pyogenic infections are common due to infections with
encapsulated bacteria such as streptococci and staphylococci (not
selective IgA deficiency).

Severe combined
immunodeficiency
disease (SCID)

Lymphocyte deficiency and failure of thymic development due to inherited abnormalities:
X-linked SCID is due to defects in the g-chain of the IL-2 receptor. The g-chain forms
part of several cytokine receptors including IL-7, which is needed for T cell maturation
• Autosomal recessive SCID is caused by defects in adenosine deaminase (ADA) or
purine nucleoside phosphorylase in more than 50% of cases. Both are involved in
purine degradation and deficiency results in accumulation of toxic metabolites and
inhibition of DNA synthesis. Recombinase defects also lead to SCID
In both types of SCID, treatment should be by bone marrow transplant, usually before the
age of 2 years. Trials using gene therapy to treat X-linked SCID were stopped due to an
increased risk of leukaemia

HINTS AND TIPS
Any patient presenting with a Serious, Persistent,
Unusual or Recurrent infection should SPUR a clinician
to think about immunodeficiency.

It is important to recognize primary immunodeficiencies. Patients with an antibody deficiency will develop irreversible lung infections (bronchiectasis)

128

unless given immunoglobulin. Children with T cell defects can be killed by opportunistic infections or from
live vaccines such as BCG.
Neonates do not possess a fully developed immune
system at birth. In the neonatal period, infants are
normally protected by maternal IgG that crossed the
placenta in utero, but this is metabolized during the
first months of life. Infants normally begin production of their own IgG by 3 months (Fig. 12.19). In
some individuals, IgG production might not start
for up to 9–12 months, possibly due to lack of help
from T cells.

HINTS AND TIPS
Mutations in the the gene for one of the pattern
recognition molecules, nucleotide-binding
oligomerization domain containing 2 (NOD2) gene are
important in some cases of inflammatory bowel disease
(IBD), and especially Crohn’s disease. For many years,
Crohn’s disease was thought to be autoimmune. Now
it appears that some cases are caused by defects in the
innate immune system.

AIDS is caused by infection with HIV. HIV is a retrovirus, containing a small amount of RNA that codes three
important viral genes: the envelope, reverse transcriptase and protease (Fig. 12.20).
The envelope is composed of gp120 which binds to
CD4 receptors and chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5). A conformational change causes gp41 to be expressed, which
penetrates the host cell. This process allows HIV to infect:
• CD4 T cells
• Monocytes and macrophages
• Dendritic cells.
Reverse transcriptase is an enzyme that catalyses the
production of HIV DNA from viral RNA, using host cellular machinery.
Protease is an enzyme that cleaves proteins into their
component peptides, and is important for viral assembly and activity.

Transmission of HIV
Sexual transmission is the most important route for
spread; HIV infects mucosal macrophages and dendritic
cells via CD4 and CC5. These professional APCs then
aid in the evolution of the HIV infection by transporting

Malignancy
Secondary immunodeficiency is particularly common
with tumours that arise from the immune system, such
as myeloma, lymphoma and leukaemia (see Chapter 5).
Many other tumours are immunosuppressive. This
is likely to provide the tumour cells with a selective advantage, because they evade destruction by cytotoxic cells.

Steroids, other drugs and radiation
Iatrogenic causes of immunosuppression are common.
Immunosuppressive drugs can be given to suppress
inflammatory or autoimmune disease, or to prevent rejection of transplanted material (see p. 137). Radiation

Immune dysfunction
it to the lymph nodes where HIV can gain easy access to
CD4 T helper cells.
Transmission can also occur through infected blood:
blood transfusions, intravenous drug abusers and needlestick injury (0.3% risk from a single exposure). These
routes do not require HIV to gain access through mucous membranes and hence CC5 receptors. Vertical
transmission is especially important in developing
countries, occurring transplacentally during labour (approximately 25% of cases) or through breast milk.

Immune response to HIV
Most individuals exposed to HIV sexually become
chronically infected. Infected individuals produce antibody, but this is largely ineffective against intracellular
virus. T cells inhibit HIV (by interferon secretion) or kill
infected cells.
The primary infection is often asymptomatic but may be
marked by a flu-like illness (fever, macular rash, mouth ulcers, splenomegaly and diarrhoea) in 15% of individuals.
HIV seroconversion illness
Individuals infected with HIV develop symptoms as
their body starts to produce antibody to HIV. This is
called HIV seroconversion illness. The patient
experiences fever, rash, malaise, sore throat, diarrhoea
and arthralgia; lymphadenopathy may also be present.
Not all patients experience seroconversion illness, and it
is often diagnosed retrospectively.

How does HIV progress to AIDS?
1. Mutations: reverse transcriptase makes an error for
roughly 1 in every 10,000 bases. Some of these mutations provide a selective advantage to the HIV, e.g. cells
of the immune system may no longer recognize them,
and another immune response has to start afresh.
2. Even if the immune system manages to clear the entire free virus, HIV can hide in host DNA and remain
dormant for many years—the latent phase. Reactivation of the host cell then results in production of
HIV RNA, and thus the infection continues.
3. HIV infects and destroys the cells that are responsible for the immune response. As the CD4 count declines, the cytotoxic T lymphocytes become less
effective as they are receiving less support from T
helper cells.

Diagnosis and monitoring of an HIV infection
Screening for HIV infection is performed using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) to detect antiHIV antibodies. If the ELISA is positive, confirmatory
tests must be carried out, e.g. a Western blot, which detects antibodies against specific HIV proteins. As seroconversion (production of antibodies) might not take
place until 3 months after infection, there is a window
period when ELISA will be negative. This is a potential
problem in blood transfusion.
In infants, anti-HIV IgG can be maternally derived
and persist for up to 18 months, making diagnosis of
HIV by ELISA unreliable. Detection of HIV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is used to confirm HIV infection in neonates.
HINTS AND TIPS
False positives may occur with the HIV enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in those with recent
influenza vaccination, hepatic disease or a recent viral
infection.

Determinations of CD4 T cell counts and measurement of the viral load (serum HIV RNA) are useful in
assessing response to treatment and the prognosis.
CD4 counts provide a guide of the current immunological status of the patient (Fig. 12.21), whereas HIV
RNA levels predict what will happen to the patient over
the next few months and years.
During the latent phase of the infection T cells are constantly battling with the HIV, and gradually the CD4
count falls. With the falling CD4 count, individuals become susceptible to more and more organisms. Initially
these include virulent organisms such as Candida albicans
and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, as the CD4
count continues to fall the individual is more susceptible
to opportunistic infections (Figure 12.22). When the
CD4 count drops to < 200 cells/mL or the individual begins to suffer from an infection indicative of AIDS (an
‘AIDS-defining condition’), they are said to be suffering
from AIDS (as opposed to just being HIV þ ve).
HINTS AND TIPS
Individuals with HIV should have their CD4 and viral
load levels checked every 3–6 months.

HINTS AND TIPS
Each infected individual contains many hundreds of
slightly different strains following infection with a
single virus.

to combat the virus are termed antiretrovirals (ARVs)
and include classes of drug that work on the three main
elements of the virus (Fig. 12.23):
• Fusion inhibitors prevent attachment to the envelope
• Reverse transcriptase inhibitors (RTIs) inhibit the
production of DNA. There are both nucleotide analogue RTIs (NARTIs) and non-nucleotide RTI
(NNRTIs)
• Protease inhibitors prevent the production of viral
peptides.
When treating HIV it is important to remember its
ability to mutate and that antiretrovirals could provide

a selective advantage for a more resistant strain to
develop. For this reason a combination of a least two
classes of drug are used and they are not started until
there is evidence of CD4 T cell decline. This combination of more than one drug is known as highly active
antiretroviral therapy (HAART).
Antibiotic prophylaxis against infections such as
Pneumocystis carinii and Toxoplasma gondii is effective
and usually given when the CD4 count is < 200/mL. It
has been shown that antibiotic prophylaxis can be safely
stopped following immune restoration using treatment
with antiretroviral therapy.
Vertical transmission can be vastly reduced by:
• Delivering by Caesarean section
• Early antiretroviral use
• No breast feeding.

In an ELISA an enzyme is attached to the antigen under study, and catalyses the conversion of a colourless
substrate to a coloured product. The amount of
coloured end-product is proportional to the amount
of antigen and can be measured using a spectrometer.
ELISAs are commonly used to measure specific antibody in a patient’s serum so we will use this as a working
example:
• A plate containing the antigen for the antibody being
tested is exposed to the patient’s serum; any of the
appropriate antibody present in the serum will bind
the antigen on the plate.
• The enzyme used to catalyse the production of the
coloured product (which is covalently attached to an
antibody that is specific for the Fc portion of the antibody in the patient’s serum) is added (see Fig. 12.24).
• The enzyme substrate is then added and the colour
conversion occurs.

Immunoassays

Each of these steps is incubated for a consistent period of time with any excess being washed before the
next substance is added.
In addition to the ELISA test we can detect antibody
by agglutination, for example:

This is a technique that uses antibody to identify antigen
or biological molecules.

• Coombs test
• Rheumatoid factor.

producing a very fine stream of cells in suspension, where
only one cell at a time passes through a beam of laser
light. Sensors detect when a cell blocks the beam of light
and the amount of light scatter identifies the size and
granularity of the cell. Various surface antigens on the cell
can be bound by monoclonal antibodies (specific for one

12

antigen). The monoclonal antibodies are labelled with
dyes that fluoresce under laser light (immunofluorescence). Different types of dye allow the detection of specific antigens (most machines use red and green
fluorescence, but up to five colours are used by some machines); CD4 counts (T cell counts) are done in this way.

• Explain the mechanisms of drugs used to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.

IMMUNIZATION

Concepts of immunization
HINTS AND TIPS
It is important to be able to explain the difference
between active and passive immunity. Active immunity
is an immune response (conferring immunological
memory) produced by the body in response to antigen
(either infection or vaccination). Passive immunity,
however, is the temporary immunity that occurs when
preformed antibodies are passed to an individual.

Immunity can be achieved by passive or active immunization (Fig. 13.1).

Passive immunization
This is a temporary immunity that results from the transfer
of exogenous antibody and thus occurs without prior exposure to the specific antigens. Passive immunity is seen in
the fetus when maternal IgG crosses the placenta and in
breast-fed babies due to the IgA content of breast milk.
Passive immunity can be conferred to individuals exposed
to a pathogen to which they are not immune by the injection of immunoglobulins to the antigen. These are taken
from blood donors immune to the pathogen, e.g. a nonimmunized patient exposed to hepatitis B would benefit
from this kind of post-infection prophylaxis.
HINTS AND TIPS
Examples where passive immunity is used:
• Prevent hepatitis A and B infection
• Prevent varicella zoster
• Treat snake bites (anti-venom).

Active immunization
Active immunization results from contact with antigens,
either through natural infection or by vaccination. Individuals exhibit a primary immune response, with clonal
expansion of B and T cells and formation of memory
cells. Subsequent exposure to the same antigen will induce a secondary immune response (see Chapter 10).

Vaccination
Vaccination is a form of active immunization that induces specific immunity to a particular pathogen. The
aim is to produce a rapid, protective immune response
on re-exposure to that pathogen. An ideal vaccine is:
• Safe, with minimal side-effects and free from contaminating substances
• Immunogenic, activating the required branches of
the immune system, inducing long-lasting local
and systemic immunity
• Heat stable, because there are difficulties with refrigeration, particularly in tropical countries
• Inexpensive, an important consideration, especially
in developing countries.

Types of vaccine
The types of vaccine in current use are listed in
Figure 13.2. Vaccines are live attenuated (weakened) organisms, killed organisms or subunit; the features of
each are compared in Figure 13.3. The routine immunization schedule used in the UK is shown in Figure 13.4.

HINTS AND TIPS
A healthy immune system can cope with live
attenuated vaccines. However, they should never be
given to immunocompromised patients as they can
cause severe infection.

Vaccines are not 100% efficacious. A small proportion of individuals receiving vaccination will not respond adequately. However, by immunizing the
majority of the population, non-responders are unlikely
to come into contact with the virus because the viral reservoir is reduced (herd immunity).

Vaccination against toxins such as tetanus does not
provide immunity against the toxin-producing
bacterium (Clostridium tetani). Its benefits come from
preventing the sequelae associated with the tetanus
toxin, i.e. tetanus of the masseter muscles (lock jaw).

You will notice that a number of vaccinations are
given simultaneously; this is not just for convenience.
Given alone some of the subunit vaccines would not

13

evoke a sufficient immune response in order for immunity to develop. For example, the DTaP vaccination relies strongly on the danger signal produced in response
to the killed pertussis organism to develop immunity to
the diphtheria and tetanus toxoids.
HINTS AND TIPS
It is possible to enhance the immune response to
vaccines by using adjuvants. Adjuvants, e.g. aluminium
salts and Bordetella pertussis, are non-specific
stimulators of the pattern recognition molecules of the
innate immune system. When these are present, the
innate immune system transmits a ‘danger signal’ to
the adaptive immune system to promote a good
response.

TRANSPLANTATION

Mechanisms of solid organ
transplant rejection
Autologous grafts are grafts moved from one part of
the body to another, e.g. skin grafts.
Syngeneic grafts are between genetically identical
individuals, e.g. monozygotic twins.
Allogeneic grafts are between individuals of the same
species.
Xenogeneic grafts are between different species.

Unless the donor and recipient are immunologically
identical, the recipient will mount a rejection response
against ‘foreign’ antigens expressed by the graft. The
most important graft antigens responsible for an immune response in the recipient are the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (see p. 92).
However, even when the donor and recipient are genetically identical at the MHC loci, graft rejection can occur
due to differences at other loci, which encode minor histocompatibility antigens. A rejection response can lead
to loss of a graft. There are three types of graft rejection
(Fig. 13.5):
1. Hyperacute: occurs within hours as a result of preformed antibodies, type II hypersensitivity reaction
2. Acute: takes several days to develop, type IV hypersensitivity reaction
3. Chronic: occurs months to years after transplantation; can be caused by a variety of mechanisms. It
cannot be treated.

Strategies for preventing rejection
Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing and
antibody cross-matching
The ideal match is that between monozygotic twins. In
all other situations there will be some genetic disparity
between donor and recipient. The aim of matching is to
minimize genetic differences between donor and recipient. Both the donor and recipient will be HLA typed.

Antirejection therapy
Immunosuppressive drugs can be used to prevent rejection by suppressing antibody and T cell responses. Examples of drugs used include:
• Steroids: these are anti-inflammatory (see below)
• Azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil and methotrexate: antiproliferative drugs
• Tacrolimus, ciclosporin and rapamycin: inhibit signalling in T cells.
The disadvantage of such non-specific therapy is that
the recipient is at increased risk of opportunistic infections (e.g. cytomegalovirus) and certain malignancies.
Most transplant patients will stay on these drugs for
life as rejection can still take place many years after
transplantation.
Newer, more selective agents are being developed, including anti-CD3 and anti-IL-2 receptor monoclonal
antibodies. IL-2 receptor monoclonal antibodies block
the growth factor needed by all types of lymphocyte.
Thus, they are very potent immunosuppressants and
are only used to treat rejection rather than prevent it.
Common types of transplantation performed today
are summarized in Fig. 13.6.

MHC, major histocompatibility complex.

Stem cell transplant
Stem cell transplants are used in the treatment of some
cancers and primary immunodeficiencies. Stem cells are
obtained from bone marrow or blood. Imperfectly
matched stem cells can be rejected by the recipient. In
addition, stem cells give rise to lymphocytes, which
can attack the host, causing acute or chronic graftversus-host disease.

ANTI-INFLAMMATORY DRUGS
Anti-inflammatory drugs are used commonly for the
treatment of a variety of hypersensitivity reactions. Different types of anti-inflammatory drug are available,
including:
• Corticosteroids
• Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
• Other anti-inflammatory agents.

Corticosteroids
The adrenal cortex releases several steroid hormones
into the circulation. Glucocorticoids not only affect
carbohydrate and protein metabolism, but also have

13

Anti-inflammatory drugs
effects on the immune system, acting as immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory agents. Several glucocorticoids are available therapeutically, including:
• Hydrocortisone: can be given intravenously in status
asthmaticus or topically for inflammatory skin
conditions
• Prednisolone: oral preparations are given in many
inflammatory or allergic conditions
• Beclometasone: used as an aerosol in asthma or topically for eczema.
Conditions commonly treated with steroids include:
•
•
•
•

Inflammatory bowel disease
Allergic conditions, e.g. asthma
Severe inflammatory skin conditions
Severe inflammatory rheumatological conditions.

Corticosteroids work primarily on phagocytes. They
inhibit the production of mediators of inflammation
(prostaglandins, cytokines) and prevent antigen presentation. At high doses they have direct effects on
lymphocytes.

Adverse effects and contraindications
Glucocorticoids cause many adverse effects at the high
doses required to produce an anti-inflammatory effect.
Glucocorticoids can cause hundreds of adverse effects,
and many patients find them too much to put up with.
The clinical features are similar to those seen in Cushing’s
syndrome and some important adverse effects are shown
in Figure 13.7.
Fig. 13.7 Some adverse effects of glucocorticoids
and their prevention or treatment

Adverse effect

Prevention or treatment

Diabetes

Regular blood sugar
measurements

Osteoporosis

Bone density should be
regularly monitored during
steroid treatment. Patients,
especially the elderly, may need
bisphosphonates and calcium
supplements

Peptic ulcer

Proton pump inhibitors may be
required

Thin skin, easy
bruising and poor
wound healing

No treatment, but early and
intensive intervention of
wounds is necessary to prevent
chronic morbidity

Adrenal insufficiency

Prevent sudden decreases in
dose, increase dose when ill and
carry a steroid card. Treatment
is with resuscitation and steroid
replacement

Steroids are contraindicated if there is evidence of
systemic infection. Long-term high-dose steroid therapy
is usually avoided. When they are used long term, there
should be regular checks on blood pressure, blood sugar
and bone density. Care should be taken when reducing
a dose of steroids. The adrenal cortex requires time to
recover so sharp reductions in dose can result in an adrenal (Adisonian) crisis.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs)
NSAIDs include a large number of drugs that can be
bought over the counter, e.g. aspirin, ibuprofen, diclofenac. They are chemically diverse but all act to inhibit
cyclo-oxygenase (Fig. 13.8). This attenuates, but does
not abolish, inflammation. As well as their antiinflammatory effects, NSAIDs have analgesic and antipyretic actions. They are used primarily in conditions
where pain is accompanied by inflammation, such as
rheumatoid arthritis.
Cyclo-oxygenase (COX) mainly occurs as two isoenzymes: COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is responsible for the
physiological prostaglandins that protect the gastric
mucosa, prevent platelet aggregation and protect renal
function. COX-2 is important for the formation of
proinflammatory prostaglandins. Thus the important
side-effects of NSAIDs, including peptic ulcers and renal
failure, occur mainly as a result of COX-1 inhibition.
Most NSAIDs block both COX isoenzymes, but some
are more active against one or the other. Selective
COX-2 inhibitors (e.g. celecoxib) were released in the
hope of having anti-inflammatory effects without gastric and renal side-effects; however, they were withdrawn from the market due to an increased incidence
of cardio- and cerebrovascular events.

Aspirin
Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) is anti-inflammatory but
causes a lot of adverse effects. As a consequence of
this, newer NSAIDs (e.g. ibuprofen) are usually preferred for treatment of inflammatory conditions, because they exhibit fewer side-effects. Aspirin is far
more efficient at inhibiting COX-1 (hence the sideeffects) and is used prophylactically in low doses in
people who have had strokes or have ischaemic heart
disease because of its ability to inhibit platelet function
(see p. 59).

Paracetamol
Paracetamol has good analgesic and antipyretic properties but little effect on inflammation. Thus it is not
strictly an NSAID but is usually grouped with them
for ease.

Adverse effects and contraindications
Adverse effects with NSAIDs are common. They often
cause damage to the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract
because they remove the cytoprotective effects of prostaglandins in the gut; the mucosa becomes ulcerated because of the damaging effects of stomach acid. Many
NSAID preparations, e.g. enteric-coating, are designed
to reduce ulceration. NSAIDs can also be nephrotoxic
and cause bronchospasm. Side-effects of aspirin include
nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and tinnitus.

Other anti-inflammatory drugs
Other anti-inflammatory drugs reduce inflammation
via different mechanisms. These include:

140

• Immunosuppressive drugs, such as ciclosporin and
azathioprine (main effects on T cells)
• Methotrexate (main effects on macrophages).
Such drugs are often used in chronic inflammatory conditions, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, to reduce the need
for steroids. Each drug has specific adverse effects and
contraindications. Newer approaches use biological
agents to block the effects of proinflammatory cytokines. For example, the effects of TNF can be blocked
by infliximab (monoclonal anti-TNF) or etanercept
(soluble TNF receptor). Both drugs are very effective in
the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease. However, they can increase the risk of infections,
such as tuberculosis, in which TNF normally has a protective role.

MCQ Answers
1. b. Liver and spleen. Refer to sites of haemopoiesis
(p. 2) to answer this question.
2. c. Thymus.
3. a. G-CSF. G-CSF acts on the granulocyte precursors
helping boost the neutrophil count. Erythropoietin
(EPO) stimulates erythrocyte production, while
eltrombopag and romiplostim are new therapeutic
agents that encourage platelet production. Stem
cell factor acts on pluripotent stem cells
encouraging their renewal; however, it is not used
clinically outside of clinical trials.
4. c. It is encapsulated. All of the above options are true
of Strep. pneumoniae. However, the spleen is
involved in removing encapsulated organisms such
as N. meningitides, Strep. pneumoniae and
H. influenzae. Thus, post-splenectomy the patient
is more prone to these infections.
5. d. Red marrow is normally restricted to the axial
skeleton and the proximal ends of long bones. Red
marrow is also where haemopoiesis occurs. Yellow
marrow is mainly fat but can become red marrow if
the body’s haemopoietic demands increase.
Haemopoiesis normally occurs in the bone marrow
but should the need arise the spleen and the liver
can also resume their fetal haemopoietic role.
Macrophages are found in the bone marrow and
store iron in the form of ferritin and haemosiderin.
Red and white pulps are found in the spleen, not
the bone marrow.
6. c. They transport CO2. Erythrocytes are responsible
for transporting O2 and CO2. They have no
nucleus or organelles. Erythrocytes are derived
from CFU-GEMM and have an average lifespan of
120 days. They usually have a biconcave discoid
shape.
7. d. Primary haemochromatosis is caused by excessive
absorption. Primary haemochromatosis is an
autosomal recessive condition characterized by
excessive absorption of iron. Iron is actively
absorbed in the duodenum and jejunum. There is
no mechanism to excrete excess iron. Iron is
transported in the blood bound to transferrin, it is
stored as ferritin when bound to apoferritin. Total
body stores are  4 g4g, and normal daily
requirement is 1 mg.
8. b. Each haemoglobin can carry 4 molecules of
oxygen. Adult haemoglobin (HbA) is normally
made up of two a-chains and two b-chains.
Oxygen binding to haemoglobin follows a sigmoid
curve. However, the oxygen dissociation curve of
myoglobin is hyperbolic. 2,3-diphosphoglycerate
levels rise in hypoxia to allow the release of oxygen
to the tissues. The Bohr effect shifts the curve to

the right due to an increase in Hþ concentration
(a lower pH).
It may be raised in b-thalassaemia syndromes. This
is to compensate for the deficiency in b-chains and
therefore defective HbA. Fetal haemoglobin (HbF)
is composed of two a and two g-globin chains, and
has a higher affinity of oxygen than HbA. HbF is
the primary haemoglobin in the later two-thirds of
fetal gestation and up to around 3 months of age.
After that levels of HbF should be very low and in
adults there is normally < 1% HbF. 2% of
haemoglobin in an adult is HbA2.
Unconjugated bilirubin is water insoluble. Haem is
produced in the mitochondria of immature red
cells, and is broken down by macrophages in the
bone marrow, liver and spleen. Haem consists of
one Fe2þ ion at the centre of a protoporphyrin ring.
Bilirubin is conjugated in the liver, making it water
soluble. It is then secreted in bile.
Blood levels of erythropoietin (EPO) are raised at
higher altitudes. The major stimulus for EPO
secretion is hypoxia, thus at higher altitudes where
partial pressures of oxygen are lower EPO levels
are raised. Although some EPO originates in the
liver the majority ( 90%) comes from the
endothelial cells of the peritubular capillaries in the
renal cortex. Androgens can increase EPO
production but this is not the major stimulus for
secretion. Bilateral nephrectomy, rather than
splenectomy, decreases EPO production and can
cause anaemia.
Total gastrectomy reduces absorption. Vitamin B12
binds to intrinsic factor (which is produced by the
parietal cells of the stomach) and is absorbed in the
terminal ileum. It is stored in the liver. Vitamin D3 is
synthesized in the skin.
It is utilized in the metabolism of alcohol.
Pernicious anaemia results in deficiency of vitamin
B12. Vitamin B12 is found exclusively in foods
derived from animals (e.g. meat, eggs, milk, fish),
whereas folic acid is found mainly in green
vegetables, as well as fortified breakfast cereals.
Renal failure. Normochromic, normocytic
anaemias are often caused by chronic disease.
Renal failure results in lower levels of the hormone
erythropoietin (EPO) and thus, anaemia. Iron
deficiency and thalassaemia are most commonly
associated with microcytic anaemias. Pernicious
anaemia and hereditary spherocytosis are most
commonly associated with megaloblastic
anaemias.
Raised serum transferrin. Iron deficiency anaemia
can cause brittle nails (koilonychias) rather than

leuconychia, which refers to white nails seen in
hypoalbuminaemia. Iron deficiency classically
results in microcytic, hypochromic red cells. Ferritin
is normally reduced while transferrin (and the total
iron-binding capacity) is increased. Subacute
combined degeneration of the cord is a serious
neurological complication associated with vitamin
B12 deficiency.
Low total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). The TIBC is
normally raised in iron deficiency anaemia. Both
anaemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency
anaemia can cause a low haemoglobin, low serum
iron and a negative direct Coombs test. The direct
Coombs test is normally positive in autoimmune
haemolytic anaemias. Although anaemia of
chronic disease is normally normocytic, it can also
have a microcytic picture, like iron deficiency.
Jaundice. Haem breakdown results in excess
unconjugated bilirubin, and therefore jaundice.
Excess bilirubin also results in pigment gall stones,
rather than cholesterol gallstones. Glossitis is a
feature of iron deficiency, as well as folic acid and
vitamin B12 deficiency. Haptoglobin is normally
decreased in haemolysis, as it binds the free
haemoglobin.
Constipation. Angina can be a symptom of severe
anaemia, due to cardiac muscle hypoxia.
Peripheral neuropathy is a feature of severe
vitamin B12 deficiency. Koilonychia is a feature of
iron deficiency anaemia. Mouth ulcers are
associated with iron and B vitamin deficiencies.
Endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract. The blood
results suggest iron deficiency anaemia. Iron
deficiency anaemia in a man, or a woman past the
menopause should prompt investigation for a
gastrointestinal (GI) bleed (peptic ulcer or occult GI
cancer). Iron deficiency in a woman of childbearing
age is most commonly due to menstrual losses.
Diabetes mellitus is a common complication. In
haemochromatosis, iron is deposited in many
organs, including the pancreas which leads to
diabetes. The skin is often pigmented giving rise to
the expression ‘bronzed diabetes’.
Haemochromatosis occurs after autosomal
recessive inheritance of the HFE mutation. There is
an excess of iron, rather than a deficiency. Clinical
features normally present after the age of 40.
Low serum folate. This patient appears to have
alcohol problems. Alcohol causes folate deficiency
because of malabsorption, malnutrition and
increased utilization. Iron deficiency anaemia is the
most common anaemia in the community, but a
macrocytic anaemia makes this unlikely. Vitamin
B12 also causes a megaloblastic anaemia, however
there are large stores in the liver and deficiency is
normally caused by pernicious anaemia or
intestinal malabsorption. This patient doesn’t
appear to have either.

result in the devastating neurological complication
subacute combined degeneration of the cord
(SCDC). Thus concurrent folate deficiency must be
ruled out. Overdoses of vitamin B12 are very rare,
and mostly harmless, thus initial B12 levels are not
important. Vitamin B12 is safe in pregnancy; in fact
increased demand in pregnancy can be the trigger
for vitamin B12 deficiency, and it responds well to
treatment. Vitamin B12 is normally given as
intramuscular injections and so swallowing
difficulties are of no importance.
Every 3 months.
Hereditary spherocytosis. This is an autosomal
dominant condition which is relatively common in
people of Northern European descent. Haemolysis
results in a megaloblastic anaemia. Splenectomy is
sometimes used to prevent recurrent crises. The
cells that appear smaller and thicker in his
peripheral blood film are spherocytes.
The presence of HbA on electrophoresis. Both
b-thalassaemia major and minor result in a
microcytic, hypochromic anaemia. However,
b-thalassaemia minor results in a mild anaemia
depending on the mutation. Onset before 9
months of age, skull X-ray changes and
splenomegaly are features of b-thalassaemia
major. In b-thalassaemia major there is no
production of HbA.
B cells and natural killer (NK) cells tend to be bigger
than T cells. Lymphocytes are the smallest white
blood cell, with a very large nucleus and few
granules. When in the blood, they are only in
transit between the bone marrow and lymphoid
organs. They are derived from lymphoid stem cells.
Immature ‘band’ forms may appear in severe
sepsis. This is also known as left shift.
Hypersegmented nuclei are seen in right shift,
which occurs in non-infectious inflammatory
processes. Neutrophils are normally very high in
bacterial infections. Neutrophils tend to have a
multilobed nucleus, with lots of granules around it.
They are normally the most abundant white cell
(40–80%).

Inheritance is X-linked and it is unrelated to social
class. Haemophilia A is caused by factor VIII
deficiency. Factor IX deficiency is haemophilia
B. Epistaxis is a common feature of platelet
disorders, as opposed to joint and muscle bleeds
which are more common in haemophilias.
38. b. The coagulation cascade culminates in thrombin
cleaving fibrinogen into fibrin. The FIXa-FVIIIaCa2þ is the tenase complex which is a potent
activator of FX. Prothrombin is cleaved by the
prothrombinase complex (FXa-FVa-Ca2þ). The
APTT measure the intrinsic pathway, while the
prothrombin time (PT) assesses the extrinsic
pathway. The surface of platelets is integral to the
propagation step of haemostasis. Protein S is a
cofactor in the inactivation of FVa and FVIIIa.
39. e. Warfarin therapy. Warfarin affects the vitamin
K-dependent clotting factors (II,VII, IX and X) and
mainly affects the extrinsic pathway. The extrinsic
pathway is measured with the prothrombin time
(PT). Warfarin therapy is monitored using the
international normalised ratio (INR) which comes
from the PT. Haemophilias A and B (deficiency of
factors VIII and IX respectively) effect the intrinsic
pathway and therefore have prolonged activated
partial thromboplastin times (APTT). von
Willebrand’s disease affects platelets and therefore
would most likely affect the bleeding time, rather
than the clotting times (although it may cause
a mild prolongation of the APTT). Protein
C deficiency would decrease the PT rather than
prolong it.

anticoagulation during pregnancy should be in the
form of heparin, which doesn’t cross the placenta.

anti-Xa assay.
A couple who are both blood group O will only
have group O children. The blood group O gene is
recessive to both A and B genes. The most
common blood group is O. People who are
blood group AB will be self-tolerant to both A and
B red cell antigens and so will have no A or B
antibodies. Anti-A and anti-B antibodies are
normally IgM. Group O plasma contains anti-A
and anti-B antibodies, and so can only be given to
patients with blood group O.
All anti-D antibodies are IgG.  85% of Caucasians
are Rh D positive. Anti-D antibodies are acquired
after sensitization (alloimmunization) e.g. transfusion
of Rh D positive blood. The D antigen is the strongest
immunogen of all the Rh antigens. Rh D positive
individuals have one or two D alleles (i.e. their
genotype is Dd or DD). If both parents have a Dd
genotype there is a one in four chance that their child
will not inherit a D allele. Their genotype would
therefore be dd, making them Rh D negative.
Anti-D antibody should be given to all rhesus D
negative mothers during pregnancy. HDN is most
commonly caused by rhesus D incompatibility, but
not exclusively. Other forms of incompatibility
(e.g. ABO) can occur. Rhesus negative mothers
require a sensitizing experience to create their own
anti-D antibodies. Thus it normally happens with
pregnancies after carrying a rhesus positive child.
Rhesus D antibodies are always IgG. HDN is very
serious and often results in hydrops fetalis.

and activation of macrophages. This process
takes 24–72 hours to peak, hence the name
delayed-type hypersensitivity.
IM adrenaline (0.5 mL of 1:1000). This dose is one
that should be known by all medical professionals.
a. b. and c. are all used but later on in the
management. C1 inhibitor is used in hereditary
angioedema.
Myasthenia gravis. This disease is characterized by
muscle weakness and fatigability.
Coeliac disease. The anti-tissue transglutaminase
test is very sensitive and specific for coeliac disease
but confirmation is needed with a duodenal
biopsy.
Rheumatoid arthritis. Type IV autoimmune
diseases are characterized by autoimmune T cells
responses. Contact dermatitis is a form of type IV
hypersensitivity, but is not autoimmune in nature.
Tumour necrosis factor alpha. TNF-a is important
for the infiltration of mononuclear cells and is the
target of newer disease modifying anti-rheumatic
drugs.
IgM anti-IgG antibodies. Rheumatoid factor is
positive in approximately 75% of patients.
Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. The rest
are forms of primary immunodeficiency.
A single-stranded RNA retrovirus. HIV possesses
reverse transcriptase with allows it to manufacture
double-stranded DNA which is incorporated into
host cells genetic material.
gp120. Once gp120 binds to the CD4 and CCR5
receptor a conformational change results in the
expression of gp 41, which allows the virus to enter
the cell.
Bacille Calmette-Guérin. This vaccine immunizes
against tuberculosis. Live attenuated vaccines are
alive but with a reduced virulence. They should
never be given to immunocompromised patients.

96. d. Live attenuated vaccines produce a good
cell-mediated response. Vaccines should be
immunogenic if they are going to stimulate a host
response. The MMR vaccines are live attenuated
vaccines. Live attenuated vaccines are more
expensive than killed vaccines, and can rarely
induce disease in the immunocompromised.
97. e. Acute cellular response takes several days to
develop. Hyperacute rejection is rapid because
antibodies have been induced prior to
transplantation e.g. by blood transfusion. It is
prevented by cross-matching the donor cells and
recipient serum. Chronic rejection is not well
understood and if it occurs, it cannot be treated.
Acute cellular rejection is mediated by T cells (as it
is type IV hypersensitivity reaction).
98. d. Interleukin-2 receptor. IL-2 is the growth factor for
all lymphocytes, therefore blocking the receptor
causes severe immunosuppression.
99. b. Gastritis. Inhibition of COX-1 decreases
gastroprotective prostaglandins, resulting in
increased stomach acid production. This can cause
gastritis and peptic ulcers. COX-1 blockade also
reduces platelet aggregation, hence aspirin is used
as an antiplatelet agent. Cushing’s syndrome and
osteoporosis are important adverse effects of
corticosteroid therapy. Non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have antipyretic and
analgesic properties as well as their actions against
inflammation.
100. e. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
may be nephrotoxic and cause bronchospasm.
NSAIDs act by inhibiting the COX enzymes.
Hydrocortisone is given intravenously or topically.
Oral preparations of corticosteroids come in the
form of prednisolone. Paracetamol is not a good
anti-inflammatory but is a good antipyretic and
analgesic. The gastrointestinal side-effects of
NSAIDs are mediated by COX-1 blockade.

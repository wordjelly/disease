PREFACE

We appreciate all the kind remarks and suggestions from the many medical
students over the past 3 years. Your positive reception has been an incredible
encouragement, especially in light of the short life of the Case Files series. In
this second edition of Case Files: Family Medicine, the basic format of the book
has been retained. Improvements were made in updating many of the chapters.
New cases include back pain, movement disorders and developmental disorders. We reviewed the clinical scenarios with the intent of improving them;
however, their “real-life” presentations patterned after actual clinical experience were accurate and instructive. The multiple-choice questions have been
carefully reviewed and rewritten to ensure that they comply with the National
Board and USMLE format. Through this second edition, we hope that the
reader will continue to enjoy learning diagnosis and management through
the simulated clinical cases. It certainly is a privilege to be teachers for so many
students, and it is with humility that we present this edition.

INTRODUCTION

Mastering the cognitive knowledge within a field such as family medicine is a
formidable task. It is even more difficult to draw on that knowledge, procure
and filter through the clinical and laboratory data, develop a differential diagnosis, and, finally, to form a rational treatment plan. To gain these skills, the
student often learns best at the bedside, guided and instructed by experienced
teachers, and inspired toward self-directed, diligent reading. Clearly, there is
no replacement for education at the bedside. Unfortunately, clinical situations
usually do not encompass the breadth of the specialty. Perhaps the best alternative
is a carefully crafted patient case designed to stimulate the clinical approach
and decision making. In an attempt to achieve that goal, we have constructed
a collection of clinical vignettes to teach diagnostic or therapeutic approaches
that are relevant to family medicine. Most importantly, the explanations for
the cases emphasize the mechanisms and underlying principles, rather than
merely rote questions and answers.
This book is organized for versatility: to allow the student “in a rush” to go
quickly through the scenarios and check the corresponding answers, as well as
enable the student who wants thought-provoking explanations to take a
slower path. The answers are arranged from simple to complex: a summary of
the pertinent points, the bare answers, an analysis of the case, an approach to
the topic, a comprehension test at the end for reinforcement and emphasis,
and a list of resources for further reading. The clinical vignettes are purposely
placed in random order to simulate the way that real patients present to the
practitioner. Section III includes a listing of cases to aid the student who
desires to test his/her knowledge of a certain area, or to review a topic including
basic definitions. Finally, we intentionally did not primarily use a multiple
choice question (MCQ) format because clues (or distractions) are not available in the real world. Nevertheless, several MCQs are included at the end of
each scenario to reinforce concepts or introduce related topics.

HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF THIS BOOK
Each case is designed to simulate a patient encounter with open-ended questions.
At times, the patient’s complaint is different from the most concerning issue,
and sometimes extraneous information is given. The answers are organized
with four different parts.

xiii

xiv

INTRODUCTION

PART I
1. The Summary identifies the salient aspects of the case, filtering out the
extraneous information. The student should formulate his/her summary
from the case before looking at the answers. A comparison to the summation
in the answer will help to improve one’s ability to focus on the important
data, while appropriately discarding the irrelevant information, a fundamental skill in clinical problem-solving.
2. A straightforward answer is given to each open-ended question.
3. The Analysis of the Case, which is comprised of two parts:
a. Objectives of the Case: A listing of the two or three main principles
that are crucial for a practitioner in managing the patient. Again, the student is challenged to make educated “guesses” about the objectives of the
case upon initial review of the case scenario, which help to sharpen his/her
clinical and analytical skills.
b. Considerations: A discussion of the relevant points and a brief approach
to the specific patient.
PART II
The Approach to the Disease Process, which has two distinct parts:
a. Definitions or pathophysiology: Terminology or basic science correlates
that are pertinent to the disease process.
b. Clinical Approach: A discussion of the approach to the clinical problem
in general, including tables, figures, and algorithms.
PART III
The Comprehension Questions for each case is composed of several multiplechoice questions that either reinforce the material or introduce new and related
concepts. Questions about material not found in the text have explanations in
the answers.
PART IV
Clinical Pearls are a listing of several clinically important points that summarize
the text, and allow for easy review of the material, such as before an examination.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Part 1. Approach to the Patient
Applying “book learning” to a specific clinical situation is one the most challenging tasks in medicine. To do so, the clinician must not only retain information, organize facts, and recall large amounts of data but also apply all of
this to the patient. The purpose of this text is to facilitate this process.
The first step involves gathering information, also known as establishing
the database. This includes taking the history, performing the physical examination, and obtaining selective laboratory examinations, special studies,
and/or imaging tests. Sensitivity and respect should always be exercised during the interview of patients. A good clinician also knows how to ask the
same question in several different ways, using different terminology. For example, patients may deny having “congestive heart failure” but will answer affirmatively to being treated for “fluid on the lungs.”

Clinical Pearl
➤ The history is usually the single most important tool in obtaining a diagnosis. The art of seeking this information in a nonjudgmental, sensitive,
and thorough manner cannot be overemphasized.

HISTORY
1. Basic information
a. Age: Some conditions are more common at certain ages; for instance,
chest pain in an elderly patient is more worrisome for coronary artery
disease than the same complaint in a teenager.
b. Gender: Some disorders are more common in men, such as abdominal
aortic aneurysms. In contrast, women more commonly have autoimmune problems, such as chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
or systemic lupus erythematosus. Also, the possibility of pregnancy
must be considered in any woman of child-bearing age.
c. Ethnicity: Some disease processes are more common in certain ethnic
groups (such as type 2 diabetes mellitus in the Hispanic population).

Clinical Pearl
➤ Family Medicine illustrates the importance of longitudinal care; that is, seeing the patient in various phases and stages of life.

2. Chief Complaint: What is it that brought the patient into the hospital?
Has there been a change in a chronic or recurring condition or is this a

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

3

completely new problem? The duration and character of the complaint,
associated symptoms, and exacerbating/relieving factors should be recorded.
The chief complaint engenders a differential diagnosis, and the possible
etiologies should be explored by further inquiry.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The first line of any presentation should include Age, Ethnicity, Gender,
Marital Status, and Chief Complaint. Example: A 32-year-old married White
male complains of lower abdominal pain of 8-hour duration.

3. Past Medical History
a. Major illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, reactive airway disease,
congestive heart failure, angina, or stroke should be detailed.
i. Age of onset, severity, end-organ involvement.
ii. Medications taken for the particular illness, including any recent
changes to medications and reason for the change(s).
iii. Last evaluation of the condition (eg, When was the last stress test
or cardiac catheterization performed in the patient with angina?)
iv. Which physician or clinic is following the patient for the disorder?
b. Minor illnesses such as recent upper respiratory infections.
c. Hospitalizations, no matter how trivial, should be queried.
4. Past Surgical History: Date and type of procedure performed, indication,
and outcome. Laparoscopy versus laparotomy should be distinguished.
Surgeon and hospital name/location should be listed. This information
should be correlated with the surgical scars on the patient’s body. Any
complications should be delineated including anesthetic complications,
difficult intubations, and so on.
5. Allergies: Reactions to medications should be recorded, including severity and temporal relationship to medication. Immediate hypersensitivity
should be distinguished from an adverse reaction.
6. Medications: A list of medications, dosage, route of administration and
frequency, and duration of use should be developed. Prescription, overthe-counter, and herbal remedies are all relevant. If the patient is currently
taking antibiotics, it is important to note what type of infection is being
treated.
7. Immunization History: Vaccination and prevention of disease is a principal
goal of the family physician; hence, recording the immunizations received
including dates, age, route, and adverse reactions, if any, is critical.
8. Screening History: Cost-effective surveillance for common diseases or malignancy is another cornerstone responsibility of the family physician. An organized record-keeping is important to a time-efficient approach to this area.
9. Social History: Occupation, marital status, family support, and tendencies
toward depression or anxiety are important. Use or abuse of illicit drugs,

4

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

tobacco, or alcohol should also be recorded. Social history, including marital
stressors, sexual dysfunction, and sexual preference, are of importance.
10. Family History: Many major medical problems are genetically transmitted (eg, hemophilia, sickle cell disease). In addition, a family history of
conditions such as breast cancer and ischemic heart disease can be a risk
factor for the development of these diseases.
11. Review of Systems: A systematic review should be performed but focused
on the life-threatening and the more common diseases. For example, in a
young man with a testicular mass, trauma to the area, weight loss, and
infectious symptoms are important to note. In an elderly woman with generalized weakness, symptoms suggestive of cardiac disease should be
elicited, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue, or palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
1. General Appearance: Mental status, alert versus obtunded, anxious, in pain,
in distress, interaction with other family members, and with examiner.
2. Vital Signs: Record the temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. An oxygen saturation is useful in patients with respiratory
symptoms. Height and weight are often placed here with a body mass
index calculated (weight in kg/height in m squared = kg/m2).
3. Head and Neck Examination: Evidence of trauma, tumors, facial edema,
goiter and thyroid nodules, and carotid bruits should be sought. In patients
with altered mental status or a head injury, pupillary size, symmetry, and
reactivity are important. Mucous membranes should be inspected for pallor, jaundice, and evidence of dehydration. Cervical and supraclavicular
nodes should be palpated.
4. Breast Examination: Inspection for symmetry and skin or nipple retraction, as well as palpation for masses. The nipple should be assessed for discharge, and the axillary and supraclavicular regions should be examined.
5. Cardiac Examination: The point of maximal impulse (PMI) should be
ascertained, and the heart auscultated at the apex and base. It is important to note whether the auscultated rhythm is regular or irregular. Heart
sounds (including S3 and S4), murmurs, clicks, and rubs should be characterized. Systolic flow murmurs are fairly common as a result of the
increased cardiac output, but significant diastolic murmurs are unusual.
6. Pulmonary Examination: The lung fields should be examined systematically and thoroughly. Strid or, wheezes, rales, and rhonchi should be
recorded. The clinician should also search for evidence of consolidation
(bronchial breath sounds, egophony) and increased work of breathing
(retractions, abdominal breathing, accessory muscle use).
7. Abdominal Examination: The abdomen should be inspected for scars, distension, masses, and discoloration. For instance, the Grey-Turner sign of
bruising at the flank areas may indicate intraabdominal or retroperitoneal
hemorrhage. Auscultation should identify normal versus high-pitched and

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

5

hyperactive versus hypoactive bowel sounds. The abdomen should be percussed for the presence of shifting dullness (indicating ascites). Then careful palpation should begin away from the area of pain and progress to
include the whole abdomen to assess for tenderness, masses, organomegaly
(ie, spleen or liver), and peritoneal signs. Guarding and whether it is voluntary or involuntary should be noted.
Back and Spine Examination: The back should be assessed for symmetry,
tenderness, and masses. The flank regions particularly are important to
assess for pain on percussion that may indicate renal disease.
Genital Examination
a. Female: The external genitalia should be inspected, then the speculum
used to visualize the cervix and vagina. A bimanual examination
should attempt to elicit cervical motion tenderness, uterine size, and
ovarian masses or tenderness.
b. Male: The penis should be examined for hypospadias, lesions, and discharge. The scrotum should be palpated for tenderness and masses. If
a mass is present, it can be transilluminated to distinguish between
solid and cystic masses. The groin region should be carefully palpated
for bulging (hernias) upon rest and provocation (coughing, standing).
c. Rectal examination: A rectal examination will reveal masses in the posterior pelvis and may identify gross or occult blood in the stool. In females,
nodularity and tenderness in the uterosacral ligament may be signs of
endometriosis. The posterior uterus and palpable masses in the cul-de-sac
may be identified by rectal examination. In the male, the prostate gland
should be palpated for tenderness, nodularity, and enlargement.
Extremities/Skin: The presence of joint effusions, tenderness, rashes, edema,
and cyanosis should be recorded. It is also important to note capillary
refill and peripheral pulses.
Neurologic Examination: Patients who present with neurologic complaints
require a thorough assessment including mental status, cranial nerves,
strength, sensation, reflexes, and cerebellar function.

Clinical Pearl
➤ A thorough understanding of functional anatomy is important to optimally interpret the physical examination findings.

12. Laboratory Assessment Depends on the Circumstances.
a. CBC, or complete blood count, can assess for anemia, leukocytosis
(infection), and thrombocytopenia.
b. Basic metabolic panel: electrolytes, glucose, BUN (blood urea nitrogen), and creatinine (renal function).

6

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

c. Urinalysis and/or urine culture to assess for hematuria, pyuria, or bacteruria. A pregnancy test is important in women of child-bearing age.
d. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase for liver function; amylase and lipase to
evaluate the pancreas.
e. Cardiac markers (creatine kinase myocardial band [CK-MB], troponin, myoglobin) if coronary artery disease or other cardiac dysfunction is suspected.
f. Drug levels such as acetaminophen level in possible overdoses.
g. Arterial blood gas measurements give information about oxygenation,
but also carbon dioxide and pH readings.
13. Diagnostic Adjuncts
a. Electrocardiogram if cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmia, or other cardiac
dysfunction is suspected.
b. Ultrasound examination is useful in evaluating pelvic processes in
female patients (eg, pelvic inflammatory disease, tuboovarian abscess)
and in diagnosing gall stones and other gallbladder disease. With the
addition of color-flow Doppler, deep venous thrombosis and ovarian or
testicular torsion can be detected.
c. Computed tomography (CT) is useful in assessing the brain for masses,
bleeding, strokes, skull fractures. CTs of the chest can evaluate for masses,
fluid collections, aortic dissections, and pulmonary emboli. Abdominal
CTs can detect infection (abscess, appendicitis, diverticulitis), masses,
aortic aneurysms, and ureteral stones.
d. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps to identifiy soft tissue planes
very well. In the emergency department setting, this is most commonly
used to rule out spinal cord compression, cauda equina syndrome, and
epidural abscess or hematoma.
e. Screening tests: Fasting lipid panel can demonstrate the cholesterol
level, including the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, which have
prognostic significance in coronary heart disease; fasting glucose and thyroid tests may be important; in many centers, dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is the test of choice to monitor bone mineral density;
the mammogram is the examination of choice to assess for subclinical
breast cancer; the double-contrast barium enema and colonoscopy are
used to detect colonic polyps or malignancy.

Part 2. Approach to Clinical Problem Solving
CLASSIC CLINICAL PROBLEM SOLVING
There are typically four distinct steps that the family physician undertakes to
systematically solve most clinical problems:

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

1.
2.
3.
4.

7

Making the diagnosis
Assessing the severity of the disease
Treating based on the stage of the disease
Following the patient’s response to the treatment

Making the Diagnosis
This is achieved by carefully evaluating the patient, analyzing the information,
assessing risk factors, and developing a list of possible diagnoses (the differential).
Usually a long list of possible diagnoses can be pared down to a few of the most
likely or most serious ones, based on the clinician’s knowledge, experience, and
selective testing. For example, a patient who complains of upper abdominal
pain and has a history of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use
may have peptic ulcer disease; another patient who has abdominal pain, fatty
food intolerance, and abdominal bloating may have cholelithiasis. Yet another
individual with a 1-day history of periumbilical pain that now localizes to the
right lower quadrant may have acute appendicitis.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The first step in clinical problem solving is making the diagnosis.

Assessing the Severity of the Disease
After establishing the diagnosis, the next step is to characterize the severity
of the disease process; in other words, to describe “how bad” the disease is.
This may be as simple as determining whether a patient is “sick” or “not sick.”
Is the patient with a urinary tract infection septic or stable for outpatient therapy? In other cases, a more formal staging may be used. For example, cancer
staging is used for the strict assessment of extent of malignancy.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The second step in clinical problem solving is to establish the severity or
stage of disease. This usually impacts the treatment and/or prognosis.

Treating Based on Stage
Many illnesses are characterized by stage or severity because this affects prognosis and treatment. As an example, a formerly healthy young man with
pneumonia and no respiratory distress may be treated with oral antibiotics at
home. An older person with emphysema and pneumonia would probably be

8

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics. A patient with pneumonia and
respiratory failure would likely be intubated and admitted to the intensive
care unit for further treatment.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The third step in clinical problem solving is tailoring the treatment to fit
the severity or “stage” of the disease.

Following the Response to Treatment
The final step in the approach to disease is to follow the patient’s response to
the therapy. Some responses are clinical, such as improvement (or lack of
improvement) in a patient’s pain. Other responses may be followed by testing
(eg, monitoring the anion gap in a patient with diabetic ketoacidosis). The
clinician must be prepared to know what to do if the patient does not respond as
expected. Is the next step to treat again, to reassess the diagnosis, or to follow-up
with another more specific test?

Clinical Pearl
➤ The fourth step in clinical problem solving is to monitor treatment response
or efficacy. This may be measured in different ways—symptomatically or
based on physical examination or other testing.For the emergency physician,
the vital signs, oxygenation, urine output, and mental status are the key
parameters.

Part 3. Approach to Reading
The clinical problem-oriented approach to reading is different from the classic “systematic” research of a disease. Patients rarely present with a clear diagnosis; hence, the student must become skilled in applying textbook information
to the clinical scenario. Because reading with a purpose improves the retention of information, the student should read with the goal of answering specific questions. There are several fundamental questions that facilitate clinical
thinking. These are:
1.
2.
3.
4.

What is the most likely diagnosis?
How would you confirm the diagnosis?
What should be your next step?
What is the best screening strategy in this situation?

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

9

5. What are the risk factors for this condition?
6. What are the complications associated with the disease process?
7. What is the best therapy?

Clinical Pearl
➤ Reading with the purpose of answering the seven fundamental clinical
questions improves retention of information and facilitates the application
of “book knowledge” to “clinical knowledge.”

WHAT IS THE MOST LIKELY DIAGNOSIS?
The method of establishing the diagnosis was discussed in the previous section.
One way of determining the most likely diagnosis is to develop standard
“approaches” to common clinical problems. It is helpful to understand the most
common causes of various presentations, such as “the worst headache of the
patient’s life is worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage” (see the Clinical Pearls
at end of each case).
The clinical scenario would be something such as:
A 38-year-old woman is noted to have a 2-day history of unilateral, throbbing
headache with photophobia. What is the most likely diagnosis?
With no other information to go on, the student would note that this
woman has a unilateral headache with photophobia. Using the “most common cause” information, the student would make an educated guess that the
patient has a migraine headache. If instead the patient is noted to have “the
worst headache of her life,” the student would use the Clinical Pearl
The worst headache of the patient’s life is worrisome for a subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Clinical Pearl
➤ The more common cause of a unilateral, throbbing headache with photophobia is a migraine, but the main concern is subarachnoid hemorrhage.
If the patient describes this as “the worst headache of her life,” the concern
for a subarachnoid bleed is increased.

HOW WOULD YOU CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS?
In the scenario above, the woman with “the worst headache” is suspected of
having a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This diagnosis could be confirmed by a

10

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CT scan of the head and/or lumbar puncture. The student should learn the
limitations of various diagnostic tests, especially when used early in a disease
process. The lumbar puncture (LP) showing xanthochromia (red blood cells)
is the “gold standard” test for diagnosing subarachnoid hemorrhage, but it
may be negative early in the disease course.
What should be your next step? This question is difficult because the next
step has many possibilities; the answer may be to obtain more diagnostic
information, stage the illness, or introduce therapy. It is often a more challenging question than “What is the most likely diagnosis?” because there may
be insufficient information to make a diagnosis and the next step may be to
pursue more diagnostic information. Another possibility is that there is enough
information for a probable diagnosis, and the next step is to stage the disease.
Finally, the most appropriate answer may be to treat. Hence, from clinical
data, a judgment needs to be rendered regarding how far along one is on the
road of:
1. Make a diagnosis Æ 2. Stage the disease Æ
3. Treat based on stage Æ 4. Follow response
Frequently, the student is taught “to regurgitate” the same information that
someone has written about a particular disease, but is not skilled at identifying the
next step. This talent is learned optimally at the bedside, in a supportive environment, with freedom to make educated guesses, and with constructive feedback. A sample scenario might describe a student’s thought process as follows:
1. MAKE THE DIAGNOSIS: “Based on the information I have, I believe
that the patient has a small bowel obstruction from adhesive disease
because he presents with nausea and vomiting, abdominal distension, and
high-pitched hyperactive bowel sounds, and has dilated loops of small
bowel on x-ray.”
2. STAGE THE DISEASE: “I don’t believe that this is severe disease as he
does not have fever, evidence of sepsis, intractable pain, peritoneal signs,
or leukocytosis.”
3. TREAT BASED ON STAGE: “Therefore, my next step is to treat with nothing per mouth, nasogastric (NG) tube drainage, IV fluids, and observation.”
4. FOLLOW RESPONSE: “I want to follow the treatment by assessing his
pain (I will ask him to rate the pain on a scale of 1 to 10 every day), his
bowel function (I will ask whether he has had nausea, or vomiting, or passed
flatus), his temperature, abdominal examination, serum bicarbonate (for
metabolic acidemia), and white blood cell count, and then reassess him in
48 hours.”
In a similar patient, when the clinical presentation is unclear, perhaps the
best “next step” may be diagnostic such as an oral contrast radiologic study to
assess for bowel obstruction.

HOW TO APPROACH CLINICAL PROBLEMS

11

Clinical Pearl
➤ Usually, the vague query, “What is your next step?” is the most difficult
question because the answer may be diagnostic, staging, or therapeutic.

WHAT IS THE BEST SCREENING STRATEGY IN THIS
SITUATION?
A major role of the family physician is screening for common and/or dangerous conditions where there may be interventions to alleviate disease. Costeffectiveness, ease of the screening modality, wide availability, and presence
of intervention are some of the important issues. The age, gender, and risk factors for the disease process in question play roles. In general, age is one of the
most important risk factors for cancer. For instance, with breast cancer, an
annual mammography is recommended in women older than age 50 years.
This imaging technique is widely available, inexpensive, safe, decreases mortality, and is cost-effective.

WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR THIS PROCESS?
Understanding the risk factors helps the practitioner to establish a diagnosis
and to determine how to interpret tests. For example, understanding risk-factor
analysis may help in the management of a 55-year-old woman with anemia. If
the patient has risk factors for endometrial cancer (such as diabetes, hypertension, anovulation) and complains of postmenopausal bleeding, she likely
has endometrial carcinoma and should have an endometrial biopsy. Otherwise,
occult colonic bleeding is a common etiology. If she takes NSAIDs or aspirin,
then peptic ulcer disease is the most likely cause.

Clinical Pearl
➤ Being able to assess risk factors helps to guide testing and develop the
differential diagnosis.

WHAT ARE THE COMPLICATIONS TO THIS PROCESS?
Clinicians must be cognizant of the complications of a disease, so that they will
understand how to follow and monitor the patient. Sometimes the student has
to make the diagnosis from clinical clues and then apply his/her knowledge of
the consequences of the pathologic process. For example, “A 26-year-old male
complains of right lower-extremity swelling and pain after a trans-Atlantic flight”

12

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

and his Doppler ultrasound reveals a deep vein thrombosis. Complications of this
process include pulmonary embolism (PE). Understanding the types of consequences also helps the clinician to be aware of the dangers to a patient. If the
patient has any symptoms consistent with a PE, a ventilation–perfusion scan or
CT scan angiographic imaging of the chest may be necessary.

WHAT IS THE BEST THERAPY?
To answer this question, not only does the clinician need to reach the correct
diagnosis and assess the severity of the condition, but (s)he must also weigh the
situation to determine the appropriate intervention. For the student, knowing
exact dosages is not as important as understanding the best medication, route
of delivery, mechanism of action, and possible complications. It is important
for the student to be able to verbalize the diagnosis and the rationale for the
therapy.

Clinical Pearl
➤ Therapy should be logical and based on the severity of disease and the
specific diagnosis. An exception to this rule is in an emergent situation,
such as respiratory failure or shock, when the patient needs treatment
even as the etiology is being investigated.

Summary
1. There is no replacement for a meticulous history and physical examination.
2. There are four steps in the clinical approach to the family medicine patient:
making the diagnosis; assessing severity; treating based on severity; and following response.
3. There are seven questions that help to bridge the gap between the textbook and the clinical arena.

Case 1
A 52-year-old man comes to your office for a routine physical examination. He is a new patient to your practice. He has no significant medical
history and takes no medications regularly. His father died at the age of
74 of a heart attack. His mother is alive at the age of 80. She has hypertension. He has two younger siblings with no known chronic medical
conditions. He does not smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, use any recreational drugs, and does not exercise. On examination, his blood pressure
is 127/82 mm Hg, pulse is 80 beats/min, respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min,
height is 67 in, and weight is 190 lb. On careful physical examination,
no abnormalities are noted.

ANSWERS TO CASE 1:
Adult Male Health Maintenance
Summary: A 52-year-old man with no active medical problems is being evaluated during an “annual physical.” He has no complaints on history and has
a normal physical examination.
➤

Recommended screening tests for cardiovascular conditions: Blood
pressure measurement (screening for hypertension) and lipid measurement
(screening for dyslipidemia)

➤

Recommended screening tests for cancer: Fecal occult blood testing,
flexible sigmoidoscopy (with or without occult blood testing), colonoscopy
or double-contrast barium enema to screen for colorectal cancer; there is
insufficient evidence to recommend for or against universal prostate cancer
screening by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing

➤

Recommended immunizations: Tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid,
and acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap) if he has not had one before and if it
has been 10 years or more since he has had a Tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine or if he requires booster protection against pertussis; influenza vaccine
annually, in the fall or winter months

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the components of an adult health-maintenance visit.
2. Learn the screening tests and immunizations that are routinely recommended
for adult men.

Considerations
The patient described is a healthy 52-year-old man. Health maintenance should
be employed to prevent future disease. In general, the approach is immunizations, cancer screening, and screening for common diseases. Generally colon
cancer screening should be initiated at age 50 and beyond. The influenza vaccine should be recommended annually, and the tetanus vaccine every 10 years.
The acellular pertussis vaccine is also recommended as many adults have had
waning immunity to pertussis and occasional outbreaks of whooping cough
have been noted. Since cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of
mortality in his age group, screening for cardiovascular disease or risk factors is
appropriate.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Health Maintenance
DEFINITIONS
SCREENING TEST: Assessment device or test that should be cost effective
with high sensitivity and can be used on a large population.
HEALTH MAINTENANCE: Preventative care for patients prior to development of disease.

CLINICAL APPROACH
For years, one of the cornerstones of primary care was the “annual physical,”
which often consisted of a complete physical examination, blood tests, including complete blood counts (CBCs) and multichemistry panels, and, frequently,
annual chest x-rays and electrocardiograms (ECGs). The concept of the “annual
physical,” or “health-maintenance examination” is still important; however,
the components of the examination have changed over time.
The purposes of the health-maintenance visit are to identify the individual
patient’s health concerns, manage the patient’s current medical conditions,
identify the patient’s risks for future health problems, perform rational and
cost-effective health screening tests, and promote a healthy lifestyle. Prevention
is divided into primary prevention and secondary prevention. Primary prevention is an intervention designed to prevent a disease before it occurs. It usually involves the identification and management of risk factors for a disease.
Examples of this would be the use of a statin medication to reduce low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in order to lower the risk of coronary artery disease or the removal of colon polyps to prevent the development of colon cancer.
Secondary prevention is an intervention intended to reduce the recurrence or
exacerbation of a disease. An example of secondary prevention is the use of a
statin medication after a person has had a myocardial infarction (MI) so as to
reduce the risk of a second heart attack.
Effective screening for diseases or health conditions should meet several
established criteria. First, the disease should be of high enough prevalence in
the population to make the screening effort worthwhile. There should be a
time frame during which the person is asymptomatic, but during which the
disease or risk factor can be identified. There needs to be a test available for
the disease that has sufficient sensitivity and specificity, is cost-effective,
and is acceptable to patients. Finally, there must be an intervention that can
be made during the asymptomatic period that will prevent the development
of the disease or reduce the morbidity/mortality of the disease process.

18

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) is an independent panel of experts in primary care and preventive medicine that
reviews evidence and makes recommendations on the effectiveness of clinical
preventive services, specifically in the areas of screening, immunization, preventive medications, and counseling. USPSTF recommendations are “gold
standards” for clinical preventive medicine. The recommendations of the
USPSTF are available online for free at www.preventiveservices.ahrq.gov.
USPSTF grades its recommendations in five categories:
A: There is strong evidence that the intervention improves health outcomes
and its benefits substantially outweigh its potential harms. These services
are strongly recommended.
B: There is at least fair evidence that the intervention improves health outcomes and its benefits outweigh its potential harms. These services are
recommended.
C: The balance of the benefits and potential harms is too close to justify making a general recommendation.
D: There is at least fair evidence that the service is ineffective or the potential harms outweigh the benefits. These services are not recommended.
E: There is insufficient evidence, or the available evidence is of such poor
quality, that the balance of benefits and harms cannot be weighed and recommendations for or against the service cannot be made.

SCREENING TESTS
Cardiovascular Diseases
Diseases of the cardiovascular system are the leading cause of death in adult
men and the management of risk factors for these diseases reduces both morbidity and mortality from these diseases. The USPSTF strongly recommends
(Level A) screening of adults for hypertension by measurement of blood pressure, as screening causes little harm and management of hypertension is effective at reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases. USPSTF also strongly
recommends (Level A) screening men aged 35 years or more and women aged
45 years or more for lipid disorders and recommends (Level B) screening
adults older than 20 years who are at increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.
The screening can take the form of nonfasting total cholesterol and high-density
lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels or fasting lipid panels that include the
low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. Ultrasonography to assess for abdominal aortic aneurysm is recommended (Level B) for men aged 65 to 75 years who
have ever smoked. There is no recommendation (Level C) for abdominal aortic aneurysm screening for men who have never smoked and it is recommended against (Level D) for women, regardless of smoking status.

CLINICAL CASES

19

The routine use of electrocardiogram (ECG), exercise stress testing, or
computed tomography (CT) scanning for coronary calcium is not recommended (Level D) for screening for coronary artery disease in adults at low
risk for coronary events. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against these modalities (Level I) in adults at higher risk of coronary events.
Screening for peripheral arterial disease in asymptomatic adults is not recommended (Level D) because of the low prevalence of the problem in asymptomatic adults and the lack of evidence for improved outcomes from treatment
in the asymptomatic stage.

Cancer
Adults (men and women) older than 50 years are strongly advised (Level A)
to have screening for colorectal cancer. This screening can take the form of
fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) using guaiac cards on three consecutive
bowel movements collected at home, flexible sigmoidoscopy with or without
occult blood testing, double-contrast barium enema, or colonoscopy. The optimal intervals for testing are not clear, but FOBT is generally recommended
annually, sigmoidoscopy and barium enema every 3 to 5 years, and colonoscopy
every 10 years. An abnormal test result of FOBT, sigmoidoscopy, or barium
enema leads to the performance of a colonoscopy.
The USPSTF currently finds insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against routine screening (Level I) for prostate cancer using digital examination
or prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men younger than 75 years. Although testing improves detection of prostate cancer, the evidence for improved outcomes
is inconsistent. Level I ratings are also given to screening for lung cancer using
CT scanning, chest x-rays, sputum cytology, or combinations of these, and to
screening for skin cancer or oral cancer.
Screening for bladder, testicular, pancreatic, or thyroid cancer in asymptomatic adults is not recommended (Level D). Screening for prostate cancer
in asymptomatic men older than 75 years is also not recommended (Level D).

Other Health Conditions
Screening for obesity by measuring body mass index (BMI) and providing
intensive counseling and behavioral interventions to promote weight loss are
recommended for all adults (Level B). There is insufficient evidence to recommend screening of asymptomatic adults for type II diabetes mellitus (Level I),
although screening is recommended (Level B) for adults with hypertension or
hyperlipidemia. Depression screening is recommended (Level B) if there are
mechanisms in place for assuring accurate diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up.
Screening and counseling to identify and promote cessation of tobacco use is
strongly recommended (Level A). Screening and counseling to identify and
prevent the misuse of alcohol is also recommended (Level B).

IMMUNIZATIONS
As is the case for well-child care, the provision of age- and condition-appropriate
immunizations is an important component of well-adult care. Recommendations
for immunizations change from time to time and the most up-to-date source
of vaccine recommendations is the Advisory Committee on Immunization
Practices. Its immunization schedules are widely published and are available at
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site (among other places),
www.cdc.gov.
The CDC has recently recommended that all adults between 19 and 65 years
of age should receive a booster of Tdap in place of a scheduled dose of Td due
to waning immunity against pertussis and the presence of an increasing number of cases of pertussis nationwide. Adults who have not had a Td booster in
10 years or more and who have never had a dose of Tdap should receive a
booster vaccination with Tdap. Persons who may need an increase in protection against pertussis, including health-care workers, childcare providers, or
those who anticipate having close contact with infants younger than 1 year,
should also receive a Tdap booster. An interval of 2 years from the last Td is
recommended, although a shorter interval may be used if necessary.
Influenza vaccination is recommended every year for adults older than
50 years. It is also recommended annually for those younger than 50 years with
certain medical conditions and for persons who may transmit the infection to
others who are at high risk (health-care or nursing home workers, household
contacts of high-risk individuals, etc). High-risk conditions include chronic
diseases of the cardiovascular, pulmonary, and renal systems and metabolic diseases such as diabetes, hemoglobinopathies, and immunodeficiencies.
Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccination is recommended as a single
dose for all adults aged 65 years or older. It is also recommended for adults
younger than 65 years who have chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, or
hepatic diseases, diabetes, or an immunodeficiency, or who are functionally
asplenic. One-time revaccination after 5 years is recommended for those with
chronic kidney or hepatic disease, immunodeficiency, or asplenia. One-time
revaccination is also recommended for those older than 65 years if they were
vaccinated longer than 5 years previously and were younger than 65 years at
the time of initial vaccination.
Other vaccinations may be recommended for specific populations,
although not for all adults. Hepatitis B vaccination should be recommended
for those at high risk of exposure, including health-care workers, those
exposed to blood or blood products, dialysis patients, intravenous drug users,
persons with multiple sexual partners or recent sexually transmitted diseases,
and men who engage in sexual relations with other men. Hepatitis A vaccine
is recommended for persons with chronic liver disease, who use clotting factors, who have occupational exposure to the hepatitis A virus, who use IV drugs,
men who have sex with men, or who travel to countries where hepatitis A

CLINICAL CASES

21

is endemic. Varicella vaccination is recommended for those with no reliable
history of immunization or disease, who are seronegative on testing for varicella
immunity, and who are at risk for exposure to varicella virus. Meningococcal
vaccine is recommended for persons with certain complement deficiencies,
functional or anatomic asplenia, or who travel to countries where the disease
is endemic.

HEALTHY LIFESTYLE
Along with the discussion of screening and promotion of tobacco cessation
and prevention of alcohol misuse, other aspects of healthy living should be
promoted by physicians. Exercise has been consistently shown to reduce the
risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and overall mortality. Even
exercise of moderate amounts, such as walking for 30 minutes on most days of
the week, has a positive effect on health. The benefits increase with increasing the amount of exercise performed. Studies performed on counseling physically inactive persons to exercise have shown inconsistent results. However,
the benefits of exercise are clear and should be promoted. Counseling to promote a healthy diet in persons with hyperlipidemia, other risk factors for cardiovascular disease, or other conditions related to diet is beneficial. Intensive
counseling by physicians or, when appropriate, referral to dietary counselors
or nutritionists, can improve health outcomes. In selected patients, recommendations regarding safer sexual practices, including the use of condoms,
may be appropriate to reduce the risk or recurrence of sexually transmitted
diseases. Finally, all patients should be encouraged to use seat belts and avoid
driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, as motor vehicle accidents remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults.

1.3

A 49-year-old sedentary man has made an appointment because his
best friend died of an MI at age 50. He asks about an exercise and weight
loss program. In counseling him, which of the following statements
regarding exercise is most accurate?
A. To be beneficial, exercise must be performed everyday.
B. Walking for exercise has not been shown to improve meaningful
clinical outcomes.
C. Counseling patients to exercise has not been shown consistently
to increase the number of patients who exercise.
D. Intense exercise offers no health benefit over mild to moderate
amounts of exercise.

ANSWERS
1.1

D. Colon cancer screening is given a Level A recommendation by
the USPSTF and is routinely recommended for all adults older than
50 years. There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against
routine lung or prostate cancer screening. Abdominal aortic aneurysm
screening is recommended in men aged 65 to 75 years who have
smoked.

1.2

B. In an adult with a chronic lung disease, one-time vaccination
with pneumococcal vaccine and annual vaccination with influenza
vaccine are recommended. A Tdap booster should be recommended
to all adults who have not had a Td booster within 10 years and have
never had a Tdap vaccine.

1.3

C. The benefits of exercise are clear. Exercise decreases cardiovascular risk factors, increases insulin sensitivity, decreases the incidence
of the metabolic syndrome, and decreases cardiovascular mortality
regardless of obesity. The benefits of counseling patients regarding
exercise are not so clear and counseling does not seem to increase the
number of patients who exercise.

Case 2
A 52-year-old man presents to your office for an acute visit because of
coughing and shortness of breath. He is well known to you because of
multiple office visits in the past few years for similar reasons. He has a
chronic “smoker’s cough,” but reports that in the past 2 days his cough
has increased, his sputum has changed from white to green in color, and
he has had to increase the frequency with which he uses his albuterol
inhaler. He denies having a fever, chest pain, peripheral edema, or other
symptoms. His medical history is significant for hypertension, peripheral
vascular disease, and two hospitalizations for pneumonia in the past
5 years. He has a 60-pack-year history of smoking and continues to smoke
two packs of cigarettes a day.
On examination, he is in moderate respiratory distress. His temperature
is 98.4°F, his blood pressure is 152/95 mm Hg, his pulse is 98 beats/min, his
respiratory rate is 24 breaths/min, and he has an oxygen saturation of
94% on room air. His lung examination is significant for diffuse expiratory wheezing and a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration. There are
no signs of cyanosis. The remainder of his examination is normal. A chest
x-ray done in your office shows an increased anteroposterior (AP) diameter
and flattened diaphragms, but otherwise he has clear lung fields.

Dyspnea (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease)
Summary: A 52-year-old man with a long smoking history presents with dyspnea,
increased sputum production, coughing, and wheezing.
➤

Most likely cause of current symptoms: Acute exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)

➤

Appropriate treatment of exacerbation: Antibiotic, bronchodilators, systemic corticosteroids

➤

Interventions to reduce exacerbations: Smoking cessation, long-acting
bronchodilator, inhaled corticosteroid, influenza vaccination

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to diagnose and determine the stage of COPD in adults.
2. Know the management of stable COPD and COPD exacerbations.

Considerations
Two of the most common causes of dyspnea and wheezing in adults are asthma
and COPD. There can be substantial overlap between the two diseases, as
patients with chronic asthma can develop chronic obstructive disease over
time. As in most medical situations, the patient’s history will usually provide
the key information to the appropriate diagnosis. Asthma often presents earlier in life, may or may not be associated with cigarette smoking, and is characterized by episodic exacerbations with return to relatively normal baseline
lung functioning. COPD, on the other hand, tends to present in midlife or
later, is usually the result of a long-term history of smoking, and is a slowly
progressive disorder in which measured pulmonary functioning never returns
to normal.
In the setting of an acute exacerbation, the differentiation between an
exacerbation of asthma and an exacerbation of COPD is not necessary for
determination of the immediate management. The assessment of the patient
presenting with dyspnea should always start with the ABCs—Airway, Breathing,
and Circulation. Intubation with mechanical ventilation should be performed
when the patient is unable to protect his own airway (for example, when he
has a reduced level of consciousness), when he is tiring because of the amount

27

CLINICAL CASES

of work required to overcome his airway obstruction, or when adequate oxygenation cannot be maintained.
For both asthma and COPD exacerbations, the mainstays of medical therapy are oxygen, bronchodilators, and steroids. All dyspneic patients should
have an assessment of their level of oxygenation. Clinical signs of hypoxemia,
such as cyanosis of the perioral region or digits, should be noted on examination. Objective levels of oxygenation using pulse oximetry or arterial blood
gas measurements should also be performed. Hypoxemia must be addressed by
providing supplemental oxygen. Inhaled β2-agonists, most commonly albuterol,
can rapidly result in bronchodilation and reduction in airway obstruction.
The addition of an inhaled anticholinergic agent, such as ipratropium, may
work synergistically with the β-agonist. Corticosteroids, given systemically
(orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously), act to reduce the airway inflammation that underlies the acute exacerbation. Clinically significant effects of
steroids take hours to occur; consequently, steroids should be used with bronchodilators because bronchodilators act rapidly. Steroids used in combination
with bronchodilators significantly improve short-term outcomes in the management of acute exacerbations of asthma and COPD.

APPROACH TO
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
DEFINITIONS
CHRONIC BRONCHITIS: Cough and sputum production on most days for at

least 3 months during at least two consecutive years.
EMPHYSEMA: Shortness of breath caused by the enlargement of respiratory

bronchioles and alveoli caused by destruction of lung tissue.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Evaluation
COPD is defined as airway obstruction that is not fully reversible, is usually
progressive, and is associated with chronic bronchitis, emphysema, or both.
The most common etiology is cigarette smoking, which is associated with
approximately 90% of cases of COPD. Other etiologies of COPD include
passive exposure to cigarette smoke (“second-hand smoke”) and occupational
exposures to dusts or chemicals. A rare cause of COPD is a genetic deficiency
in α1-antitrypsin, which is more common in Caucasians and should be considered when emphysema develops at younger ages (<45 years of age), especially

28

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

in nonsmokers. COPD is a disease of inflammation of the airways, lung tissue,
and vasculature. Pathologic changes include mucous gland hypertrophy with
hypersecretion, ciliary dysfunction, destruction of lung parenchyma, and airway remodeling. The results of these changes are narrowing of the airways,
causing a fixed airway obstruction, poor mucous clearance, cough, wheezing,
and dyspnea.
The most common initial symptom of COPD is cough, which is at first
intermittent and then frequently becomes a daily occurrence. The cough is
often productive of white, thick mucus. Patients will present with intermittent episodes of worsening cough, with change in mucus from clear to yellow/
green, and often with wheezing. These exacerbations are usually caused by viral
or bacterial infections.
As COPD progresses, lung function continues to deteriorate and dyspnea
develops. Dyspnea is the primary presenting symptom of COPD. Dyspnea also
tends to worsen over time—initially the dyspnea will occur only with significant effort, then with any exertion, and finally at rest. By the time dyspnea
develops, lung function (as measured by forced expiratory volume in the
first second of expiration [FEV1]) has been reduced by about half and the
COPD has been present for years.
Examination of a patient with mild or moderate COPD, who is not having
an exacerbation, is usually normal. As the disease progresses, patients are
often noted to have “barrel chests” (increased anteroposterior chest diameter)
and distant heart sounds, as a result of hyperinflation of the lungs. Breath
sounds may also be distant and expiratory wheezes with a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration may be noted. During an acute exacerbation, patients
often appear anxious and tachypneic; they may be using accessory muscles of
respiration, usually have wheezes or rales, and may have signs of cyanosis.
Chest x-rays in patients with COPD are typically normal until the disease
is advanced. In more severe cases, hyperinflation of the lungs with an increased
posteroanterior (PA) diameter and flattening of diaphragms may be seen. Bullae––
areas of pulmonary parenchymal destruction—can also be seen in x-rays in
more severe disease.
The primary diagnostic test of lung function is spirometry. In normal aging,
both the forced vital capacity (FVC) (a measure of the total amount of air
that can be expired after a maximal inspiration) and forced expiratory volume
in first second (FEV1) reduce gradually over time. In normal-functioning
lungs, the ratio of the FEV1 to FVC is greater than 0.7. In COPD, both the
FVC and FEV1 are reduced and the ratio of FEV1 to FVC is less than 0.7,
indicating an airway obstruction. Reversibility is defined as an increase in
FEV1 of greater than 12% or 200 mL. Using a bronchodilator may result in
some improvement of both FVC and FEV1, but neither will return to normal,
making the diagnosis of a fixed obstruction. The severity of COPD, which
can help to determine treatment, can be assessed using these measurements
(Table 2–1).

Management of Stable COPD
The goals of COPD management are to relieve symptoms, slow disease progression, reduce/prevent/treat exacerbations, and reduce/prevent/treat complications. Several components of treatment are common to all stages of COPD,
whereas pharmacologic treatment is guided by the stage of disease.
All patients with COPD should be encouraged to quit smoking. The pulmonary function of smokers declines more rapidly than that of nonsmokers.
Although smoking cessation does not result in significant improvement in
pulmonary function, smoking cessation does reduce the rate of further
deterioration to that of a nonsmoker. Cessation also reduces the risks of
other comorbidities, including cardiovascular diseases and cancers. Case 7
more thoroughly discusses smoking cessation. All patients with COPD should
receive a pneumococcal and annual influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination reduces the frequency and complications of exacerbations. Regular exercise and efforts to maintain normal body weight should be encouraged.
Short-acting bronchodilators used as needed are the recommended treatment in stage I COPD. These include β2-agonists (albuterol) and anticholinergics (ipratropium). Inhaled medications are preferred over oral, as they

30

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

tend to have fewer side effects. The choice of specific agent is based on availability, individual response to therapy, and side effects.
In stage II COPD, a long-acting bronchodilator should be added. Commonly
used agents in the United States are salmeterol (an inhaled β2-agonist) and
tiotropium (an inhaled anticholinergic). Oral methylxanthines (aminophylline, theophylline) are also options, but have narrow therapeutic windows
(high toxicity) and multiple drug-drug interactions, making their use less common. The use of long-acting bronchodilators is more convenient and more
effective than using short-acting agents, but is much more expensive and does
not replace the need for short-acting agents for rescue therapy in exacerbations.
Inhaled steroids (fluticasone, triamcinolone, mometasone, etc) do not
affect the rate of decline of lung function in COPD but do reduce the frequency of exacerbations. For that reason, inhaled steroids are recommended
for stages III and IV COPD with frequent exacerbations. Long-term treatment with oral steroids is not recommended, as there is no evidence of benefit, but there can be multiple complications (myopathy, osteoporosis, glucose
intolerance, etc).
Oxygen therapy is recommended in stage IV COPD if there is evidence of
hypoxemia (PaO2 ≤55 mm Hg or SaO2 ≤88% at rest) or where the PaO2 is less
than or equal to 60 mm Hg and there is polycythemia, pulmonary hypertension, or peripheral edema suggesting heart failure. Oxygen therapy is the only
intervention that has been shown to decrease mortality and must be worn
for at least 15 h/d.

Management of Exacerbations of COPD
Acute exacerbations of COPD are common and typically present with change
in sputum color or amount, cough, wheezing, and increased dyspnea. Viral
and bacterial infections are a common precipitant of acute exacerbations of
COPD. Diagnoses that can cause similar symptoms (eg, pulmonary embolism,
congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction) must be excluded so that
appropriate therapy can occur.
The severity of the exacerbation should be evaluated by history, examination, assessment of oxygenation, and focused testing. Oxygen should be given
to keep saturation greater than 90% or PaO2 levels at about 60 mm Hg. Patients
with more severe symptoms, comorbidities, altered mental status, an inability
to care for themselves at home, or whose symptoms fail to respond promptly
to office or emergency room treatments should be hospitalized.
All acute exacerbations should be treated with short-acting bronchodilators. Combinations of short-acting agents with different mechanisms of action
(ie, β-agonist and anticholinergic) can be used until symptoms improve.
Systemic steroids shorten the course of the exacerbation and may reduce the
risk of relapse. A steroid dose of 40 mg prednisone (or equivalent) for 10 to
14 days is recommended.

CLINICAL CASES

31

Exacerbations associated with increased amounts of sputum or with purulent sputum should be treated with antibiotics. Pneumococcus, Haemophilus
influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are the most common bacteria implicated.
In milder exacerbations, treatment with oral agents directed against these
pathogens is appropriate. In severe exacerbations, gram-negative bacteria
(Klebsiella, Pseudomonas) can also play a role, so antibiotic coverage needs to
be broader.

Comprehension Questions
2.1

A 38-year-old woman presents with progressively worsening dyspnea
and cough. She has never smoked cigarettes, has no known passive

does not respond to bronchodilators. Which of the following is the most
likely etiology?
A. Radon exposure at home
B. COPD
C. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency
D. Asthma

2.2

COPD. He admits to a long history of cigarette smoking and is still
currently smoking. In counseling him about the benefits of smoking
cessation, which of the following statements is most accurate?
A. By quitting, his pulmonary function will significantly improve.
B. By quitting, his current pulmonary function will be unchanged,
but the rate of pulmonary function decline will slow.
C. By quitting, his pulmonary function currently and rate of decline
are unchanged, but there are cardiovascular benefits.
D. By quitting, his pulmonary function will approach that of a nonsmoker of the same age.

2.4

A 59-year-old man with a known history of COPD presents with worsening dyspnea. On examination he is afebrile. His breath sounds are
decreased bilaterally. He is noted to have jugular venous distension
(JVD) and 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. Which of the
following is the most likely cause of his increasing dyspnea?
A. COPD exacerbation
B. Pneumonia
C. cor pulmonale
D. Pneumothorax

ANSWERS
2.1

C. This patient has a fixed airway obstruction consistent with
COPD. The airway obstruction of asthma would be at least partially
reversible on testing with a bronchodilator. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency should be considered in a patient who develops COPD at a
young age, especially if there is no other identifiable risk factor.

2.2

B. Smoking cessation will not result in reversal of the lung damage
that has already occurred, but can result in a slowing in the rate of
decline of pulmonary function. In fact, smoking cessation can result
in the rate of decline returning to that of a nonsmoker.

2.3

C. This patient has stage III COPD with frequent exacerbations. He
is best treated by a long-acting bronchodilator (eg, tiotropium) and
an inhaled steroid (eg, fluticasone) used regularly, along with an
inhaled, short-acting bronchodilator on an as-needed basis.

2.4

C. JVD and lower extremity edema are suggestive of cor pulmonale,
which is right heart failure due to chronically elevated pressures in
the pulmonary circulation. Right heart failure causes increased right
atrial pressures and right ventricular end diastolic pressures, which
then lead to liver congestion, jugular venous distension, and lower
extremity edema.

Clinical Pearls
➤ All smokers should be counseled on the benefits of smoking cessation
before they develop symptomatic COPD; by the time symptoms develop,
the patient’s FEV1 will have reduced by approximately 50%.
➤ Always remember to evaluate the ABCs—Airway, Breathing, Circulation—
when evaluating a dyspneic patient.

Case 3
A 45-year-old white man presents to your office complaining of left
knee pain that started last night. He says that the pain started suddenly
after dinner and was severe within a span of 3 hours. He denies any
trauma, fever, systemic symptoms, or prior similar episodes. He has a history of hypertension for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).
He admits to consuming a great amount of wine last night with dinner.
On examination, his temperature is 98°F, his pulse is 90 beats/min,
his respirations are 22 breaths/min, and his blood pressure is 129/88 mm Hg.
Heart and lung examinations are unremarkable. The patient is reluctant
to flex the left knee, wincing in pain at touch, and has passive range of
motion. The knee is edematous, hot to touch, and has erythema of the
overlying skin. No crepitation or deformity is apparent. No other joints
are involved. Inguinal lymph nodes are not enlarged. Complete blood
count reveals a white blood cell count of 10,900 cells/mm3 and is otherwise
normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 3:
Joint Pain
Summary: This is a 45-year-old man who presents with the sudden onset of
monoarticular, nontraumatic joint pain. Evolution from onset to severe pain
was rapid. The patient denies any trauma, systemic signs of illness, or any
prior episodes. That he takes hydrochlorothiazide and drank a lot of alcohol
the night that his symptoms started are important. His vital signs are stable,
and he does not appear to be systemically ill. There is pain to movement and
touch of the left knee, with evident edema, erythema, and warmth of the
joint. No other joints are involved. His white blood cell count is not indicative of an acute infectious process.
➤

Next diagnostic step: Joint aspiration for examination of joint fluid to
identify crystals and exclude infection

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Crystal-induced gout of the left knee

➤

Next step in therapy: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and
provide analgesia; may consider using colchicine

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Have a differential diagnosis for nontraumatic joint pain, based on clinical
presentation.
2. Be familiar with the most common diagnostic tests for the above conditions, and have a rationale when ordering these tests.
3. Know the most common treatment options in the acute onset of gout and
infectious arthritis, as well as the chronic management of rheumatoid
arthritis and osteoarthritis.

Considerations
This 45-year-old man presents with the sudden onset of monoarticular joint
pain. The first diagnosis that needs to be excluded is an infected joint. A joint
becomes septic by blood inoculation, by contiguous infection (such as from
bone or soft tissue), or from direct inoculation from trauma or surgery. Exclusion
of an infectious etiology is paramount as cartilage can be destroyed within the
first 24 hours of infection. In this case, the patient’s history and clinical scenario do not favor an infectious cause, although it cannot be excluded by history and physical examination alone.

37

CLINICAL CASES

There are several additional pieces of information that guide the diagnosis
in this case. Most gout attacks occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years in
men, with a later onset in postmenopausal women (50 to 70 years of age). The
patient’s recent increase in alcohol consumption can be considered an exacerbating factor. Other factors that may also increase the risk of a gout attack
include trauma, surgery, or a large meal that induces hyperuricemia. Finally,
the patient’s history of taking a thiazide diuretic is also important, as these
drugs may induce hyperuricemia.
The examination of a joint aspirate is essential for the diagnosis. The gross
appearance of fluid is not very specific, as both a septic aspirate and a heavily
condensed crystal-induced arthritis may have a thick, yellowish/chalky appearance. To diagnose crystal-induced arthritis, polarizing microscopy has to reveal
monosodium urate (MSU) crystals, which will look like needles and have a
strong negative birefringence. Other crystals that may be seen are calcium
pyrophosphate dehydrate, calcium hydroxyapatite, and calcium oxalate.
• Calcium pyrophosphate dehydrate: Rod shaped, rhomboid, weakly posi-

tive birefringence
• Calcium hydroxyapatite: Seen by electron microscopy, cytoplasmic inclu-

sions that are nonbirefringent
• Calcium oxalate: Bipyramidal appearance, strongly positive birefringence;

seen mostly in end-stage renal disease patients
In crystal-induced arthritis, the white blood cell count of the joint aspirate
is on average 2000 to 60,000/μL, with less than 90% neutrophils, while a septic joint will have an average of 100,000 WBC/μL (25,000-250,000 cells)
with more than 90% neutrophils. Aspirate that has been determined to be
crystal-induced must also be cultured so as to rule out a coexisting infection.

APPROACH TO
Nontraumatic Joint Pain/Swelling
DEFINITIONS
GOUTY ARTHRITIS: Condition of excess uric acid leading to deposition in
joints, especially the great toe.
PSEUDOGOUT: Condition of joint pain and inflammation due to calcium
pyrophosphate dehydrate crystals in the joints, which can be diagnosed by
noting rod-shaped, rhomboid, weakly positive birefringence by crystal analysis.

38

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLINICAL APPROACH
Depending on the etiology, pain may be present in 1, 2, or more joints.
Considering the patient’s age, medical history, and medication profile is
important. The patient’s lifestyle and social history should also be considered,
as certain activities may predispose a patient to specific infections. Among
the major diagnoses that have to be considered in a nontraumatic swollen joint
are gout (or any crystal-induced arthritis), infectious arthritis, osteoarthritis,
and rheumatoid arthritis. For acute monoarticular arthritis in adults, the most
common causes include trauma, crystals, and infection.

Clinical Presentation
Gout’s first episode can often be confused with cellulitis. It presents with
swelling and pain, usually of one joint, accompanied by erythema and warmth.
Classically, a gout attack involves the metatarsophalangeal joint of the first
toe, called podagra, but it may involve any joint in the body. Some cases left
untreated resolve spontaneously within 3 to 10 days, with no residual signs or
symptoms. During an acute attack, the serum uric acid level may be normal
or even low, likely as a result of the existing deposition of the urate crystals.
Uric acid levels are, however, useful in monitoring hypouricemic therapy
between attacks. Radiographs may show cystic changes in the joint surface,
with punched-out lesions and soft-tissue calcifications. These findings are
nonspecific and are also seen in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.
An infection usually involves only one joint if it is of bacterial origin
(>90% of cases). The knee, hip, and shoulder are the three most commonly
involved joints. A chronic monoarticular arthritis or involvement of two to
three joints may be caused by fungi or mycobacteria. In the case of acute polyarticular (>3 joints) arthritis, the etiology may be from endocarditis or a disseminated gonococcal infection.
Bacterial infections of a joint occur most commonly in persons with rheumatoid arthritis. The chronic inflammation of joints coupled with the use of
steroids predisposes this group to Staphylococcus aureus infections. HIV-positive
patients may develop pneumococcal, salmonella, or even Haemophilus influenzae
joint infections. Intravenous drug users are most likely to get a streptococcal,
staphylococcal, gram-negative, or Pseudomonas infection.
Range of motion (ROM) of the joint is an important maneuver of the
physical examination. A septic joint will have a very limited ROM due to
pain coupled with a joint effusion and fever. However, a nearby cellulitis, bursitis, or osteomyelitis will usually maintain the ROM of a joint. The aspirate
of a septic joint will have a positive culture in more than 90% of cases.
Osteoarthritis (OA) is most commonly found in people older than 65 years
of age (68% of patients) and is associated with trauma, history of repetitive joint
use, and obesity (specifically for knee OA). It primarily affects the cartilage, but
ends up damaging the bone surface, synovium, meniscus, and ligaments. The

CLINICAL CASES

39

clinical presentation is usually that of a dull, deep, ache-type pain. The onset is
usually gradual, with activity exacerbating the pain, and rest decreasing it. In the
latter stages, pain is usually constant. On physical examination, a bony crepitus
may be felt on passive ROM. There may be a small joint effusion and periarticular muscle atrophy. In the advanced stage, joint deformity with decreased ROM
will be seen. X-rays are usually normal at first, with the gradual development
of bone sclerosis, subchondral cysts, and osteophytes.
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is another common disorder that may affect people from any age group, but will usually present initially in those 30 to 55 years
old. The presentation of RA can be varied, ranging from a monoarticular
arthritis that is intermittent, to a polyarthritis that progresses gradually in
intensity, leading to disability. It affects more women than men (3:1), and the
treatment will usually depend on the stage at which the disease is diagnosed.
The American Rheumatism Association has delineated specific diagnostic
criteria to aid in the diagnosis of RA, among which are the following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

Morning stiffness
Involvement of three or more joints
Involvement of hand joints
Symmetric arthritis
Presence of rheumatoid nodules
Positive rheumatoid factor
Radiographic changes, which include erosions or decalcifications.

Of all these diagnostic criteria, the first four must be present for at least
6 weeks, and the fulfillment of any four of these criteria is sufficient to
diagnose RA. Among the laboratory tests that may be abnormal in patients
with RA are an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an elevated C-reactive
protein, anemia, thrombocytosis, and low albumin. The level of hypoalbuminemia usually correlates with the severity of the disease.

Treatment
Analgesia is a common factor to consider in therapy for all the conditions
described above. In the case of an acute gout attack, colchicines, nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and glucocorticoids are the drugs mainly
used. In the elderly population, one must take into account the possibility of
GI complications from the above medications. To reduce these risks, intraarticular steroids, ice packs, and low-dose colchicine are more often used. In
patients with recurrent gout attacks, chronic medication therapy can be used
to maintain serum uric acid levels below 5 mg/dL. The maintenance therapy
is usually with either probenecid, which increases the urinary excretion of uric
acid, or allopurinol, which reduces the production of uric acid.
A septic joint requires surgery for drainage of infectious material followed
by IV antibiotics. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) will

40

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

usually require vancomycin, but coverage with antibiotics is dependent on the
specific organisms isolated.
Degenerative joint disease treatment involves mobility exercises, maintenance
of adequate range of motion, and weight loss, if appropriate. Intra-articular corticosteroid injections may provide relief for varying amounts of time, but should
only be done every 4 to 6 months so as to avoid cartilage destruction. Surgery,
such as joint replacement, is usually reserved for people with severe disease
that affects their daily functions.
Therapy for rheumatoid arthritis involves multiple modalities. Education
and counseling of the patient regarding disease progression, treatment options,
and implications to lifestyle is essential. Exercises, such as those that maintain
joint mobility and muscle strength, are very important, as the natural course of
RA is to develop a stiff joint that becomes disabling. Physical therapy and
occupational therapy are important to address specific areas in which the patient
may need additional devices to perform activities of daily living.
Many different categories of medications are used in RA. These include
NSAIDs, glucocorticoids, disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs),
anticytokines, and topical analgesics. Among the DMARDs are sulfasalazine and
methotrexate. Infliximab and etanercept are examples of anticytokine agents.
Treatment regimens are individualized, and will often include a combination of
two or three of these agents. Although effective, monitoring for hepatotoxicity
must be performed.

A 35-year-old man with hypertension presents with the sudden onset
of right big toe pain. Which of the following is the best treatment?
A. Ipuprofen
B. Methotrexate
C. Colchicine
D. Intravenous antibiotics

ANSWERS
3.1

C. Infectious arthritis would need to be high on the differential diagnosis because of the danger of gonococcal arthritis. The history supports this diagnosis. This patient needs a joint aspiration to look for
gram negative diplococci, crystals, and to obtain a sample for culture.
He will likely require surgical drainage of the swollen joint and IV
antibiotic therapy.

3.2

D. Morning stiffness, involvement of the hands, and symmetric
arthritis are three of the criteria necessary for the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. DMARD therapy, such as the use of methotrexate, would
be indicated. Methotrexate as a disease-modifying agent would alter
the natural history of the disease rather than just treat the symptoms.

3.3

B. Obesity is a risk factor for osteoarthritis, which is common in the
knees and typically presents with a gradual onset and worsening of
symptoms. Along with exercise and efforts to lose weight, an NSAID
medication, such as ibuprofen, may provide symptomatic relief.

3.4

C. Gouty arthritis often initially presents in the big toe (“podagra”)
and the use of HCTZ, a common treatment for hypertension, also can
increase the risk. Colchicine can provide effective acute treatment.

Clinical Pearls
➤ A red, swollen joint must be aspirated to rule out a joint infection.
➤ Trauma, infection, and crystals are the most common causes of acute
monoarthritis in adults.

ANSWERS TO CASE 4:
Prenatal Care
Summary: A 22-year-old primigravida woman with no significant past medical history presents for initial prenatal care visit. She has numerous questions
regarding her care and recently has had dental x-rays taken.
➤

Indications for an ultrasound in pregnancy: According to the American
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), an ultrasound is not
mandatory in routine, low-risk prenatal care. An ultrasound is indicated for
the evaluation of uncertain gestational age, size/date discrepancies, vaginal
bleeding, multiple gestations, or other high-risk situations.

➤

Laboratory studies recommended at the initial prenatal visit: Complete
blood count (CBC), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), HIV testing,
syphilis screening with a rapid plasma reagin (RPR), urinalysis and urine
culture, rubella antibody, blood type and Rh status with antibody screen,
Papanicolaou (Pap) smear, and cervical swab for gonorrhea and Chlamydia.

➤

Risk to the pregnancy based on the radiation exposure from dental x-rays:
Risk for the baby is increased once the radiation exposure is greater than
5 rads; the radiation exposure from routine dental x-rays is 0.00017 rads.

➤

The optimal time for the trisomy screen: The optimal time is 16- to 18-week
gestation; however, it may be performed between 15- and 20-week gestation, if necessary. Emerging evidence shows first trimester screening may be
as effective in some centers.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the components of the preconception counseling and the initial prenatal visit.
2. Know the recommended screening tests and visit intervals in routine prenatal care.
3. Learn the relevant psychosocial aspects of providing prenatal care, including important counseling issues.

Considerations
Prenatal, or antenatal, care affords the opportunity to both perform appropriate
medical testing and provide counseling and anticipatory guidance. Pregnancy

CLINICAL CASES

45

can be a time of anxiety and patients frequently have many questions. One of
the goals of prenatal care is to provide appropriate education in order to help
reduce anxiety and help women to be active participants in their own care.

APPROACH TO
Prenatal Care
DEFINITIONS
ADVANCED MATERNAL AGE: Pregnant woman who will be 35 years or

beyond at the estimated date of delivery.
ISOIMMUNIZATION: The development of specific antibodies as a result of

antigenic stimulation by material from the red blood cells of another individual. For example, Rh isoimmunization means a Rh negative woman who develops anti-D (Rh factor) antibodies in response to exposure to Rh (D) antigen.
ASYMPTOMATIC BACTERIURIA: 100,000 cfu/mL or more of a pure pathogen
of a mid-stream voided specimen.
GENETIC COUNSELING: An educational process provided by a health-care
professional for individuals and families who have a genetic disease or who are
at risk for such a disease. It is designed to provide patients and their families
with information about their condition or potential condition and help them
make informed decisions.
VERTICAL TRANSMISSION: Infectious passage of infection from mother to
fetus, whether in utero, during labor and delivery, or postpartum.
ANTENATAL TESTING: A procedure that attempts to identify whether the
fetus is at risk for uteroplacental insufficiency and perinatal death. Some of
these tests include nonstress test and biophysical profile.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Preconception
In the United States, the first visit for prenatal care frequently is at 8 weeks of
gestation or later, and yet it is the time preceding this that poses the greatest risk
to fetal development. A preconception visit is an ideal opportunity for the
patient to discuss with her physician any issue related to possible pregnancy
or contraception occurring within 1 year of pregnancy. The preconception
visit can be included during visits for many reasons, including fertility problems,
contraception, periodic health assessment, recent amenorrhea or specifically for
preconception counseling. Roughly one-half of patients with a negative pregnancy test may have some risk that could adversely affect a future pregnancy.

46

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Because roughly 50% of pregnancies are unplanned or unintended, physicians
should consider the potential of pregnancy when writing each prescription.
Women who intend to become pregnant should be advised to avoid, whenever possible, potentially harmful agents such as radiation, drugs, alcohol,
tobacco, over-the-counter (OTC) medications, herbs, and other environmental agents. Radiation exposure greater than 5 rads is associated with fetal
harm. Most commonly performed x-ray procedures, including dental, chest,
and extremity x-rays, expose a fetus to only very small fractions of this
amount of radiation. Fetuses are particularly sensitive to radiation during
the early stages of development, between 2 and 15 weeks after conception.
Whenever possible, the abdomen and pelvis should be shielded and x-rays performed only when the benefit outweighs the potential risk. Magnetic resonance
imaging studies have not been proven to cause harm, but are not recommended
in pregnancy, if avoidable. Ultrasound has not been shown to be harmful.
Women should refrain from OTC medicines, herbs, vitamins, minerals, and
nutritional products until cleared by their obstetric provider. They should also be
instructed to start a folic acid supplement at least 1 month prior to attempting to
conceive. For low-risk women, 400 μg of folic acid daily is recommended to
reduce the risk of neural tube defects. Higher doses are recommended in the
presence of certain risk factors. For women with diabetes mellitus or epilepsy,
1 mg of folic acid a day is recommended. A woman who has had a child with a
neural tube defect should take 4 mg of folic acid daily.
Women from certain ethnic backgrounds may be offered specific genetic
screening. African and African-American women may be offered sickle cell
trait screening. A French-Canadian or Ashkenazi Jewish background is an indication to consider screening for a Tay-Sachs carrier state. Southeast Asian and
Middle Eastern women may be offered screening for thalassemia. Ashkenazi
Jews and Caucasian women may be offered screening for cystic fibrosis.
Women who will be 35 years old or older at the anticipated time of delivery should be educated about age-related risk, particularly the increased risk
of Down syndrome. They should be counseled about the available screening
and diagnostic testing available, along with the appropriate time frame in
which each test may be performed.
Women with medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma, thyroid disease,
hypertension, lupus, thromboembolism, and seizures should be referred to
providers with experience in managing high-risk pregnancies. Women with
psychiatric disorders should be comanaged with a psychiatrist and counselor/
therapist so that the patient can benefit from pharmacologic and behavioral
therapy. These patients may require more frequent visits. Patients who have
drug, tobacco, or alcohol dependence should be educated about the risks and
referred to rehab/treatment centers to quit the drug prior to conception.
Women should also be educated about proper nutrition and exercise during
pregnancy. Preconception counseling may also address issues such as financial
readiness, social support during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and
issues of domestic violence.

Initial Prenatal Visit
The initial visit should address all the concepts in the preconception visit, if
no preconception counseling was done. Ideally, the initial visit should be in
the first trimester. A detailed history and physical examination, initial obstetric labs, and counseling regarding the logistics for prenatal care should be
done at this visit. The history should begin with an assessment of the last
menstrual period (LMP) and its reliability. One of the most crucial pieces of
information is the accuracy of the dating. The first day of the LMP is used
to obtain the estimated delivery date using Naegele’s rule (from the first day
of the LMP subtract 3 months and add 7 days). The LMP is considered reliable if the following criteria are met: the date is certain, the last menstrual
period was normal, there has been no contraceptive use in the past 1 year, the
patient has had no bleeding since the LMP, and her menses are regular. If
these criteria are not met, an ultrasound should be performed. ACOG has
established further criteria that can be used to ensure that a fetus is mature at
the time of delivery, which include criteria such as early sonography and the
timing of the positive pregnancy test.
History should also be obtained with particular attention to medical history, prior pregnancies, delivery outcomes, pregnancy complications, neonatal complications, and birth weights. Gynecologic history should focus on the
menstrual history, contraceptive use, and history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Allergies, current medications—both prescription and OTC—
and substance use should also be investigated. Social history should consider
whether the pregnancy was planned, unplanned, or unintentional. A discussion of social supports for the patient during the prenatal and postpartum
period is also warranted. Genetic history should be obtained for the patient
and partner’s family, if known.
The initial examination should be thorough and should assess height, weight,
blood pressure, thyroid, breast, and general physical and pelvic examinations.
Pregnancy-specific examinations, including an estimation of gestational age by
uterine size or fundal height measurement and an attempt to hear fetal heart
tones by Doppler fetoscope should be performed. Heart tones should be obtainable by 10-week gestation using a handheld Doppler fetoscope. Pelvimetry has
been removed as a recommended required intervention, but it may be useful to
have a subjective assessment for risks of problems during delivery.
The initial laboratory screen (see Table 4–1) should include blood type
and Rh status antibody screen, rubella status, HIV, hepatitis B surface antigen,
rapid plasma reagin (RPR), urinalysis, urine culture, Pap smear, cervical swab
for gonorrhea and Chlamydia, and a CBC.
The logistics of the prenatal visits should be addressed. A typical protocol
includes follow-up visits every 4 weeks until 28-week gestation, every 2 weeks
from 28- to 36-week gestation, and every week from 36-week gestation until
delivery. More frequent visits should be performed if any problems arise or if
all issues are not addressed in the scheduled visits.

The ACOG does not stipulate routine ultrasonography in patients without
complications. Ultrasound is considered accurate for establishing gestational age,
fetal number, viability, and placental location. Therefore, ultrasonography should
be performed in patients without reliable dating criteria, with a discrepancy
between the measured and expected uterine growth, and in case of a postdated
pregnancy, suspicion for twin gestation, suspicion for placental issues, chromosomal abnormalities, or other problems. For gestational age estimations,
ultrasonography is accurate for within 1 week if performed in the first
trimester, 2 weeks in the second trimester, 3 weeks in the third trimester. If
the ultrasound dates and LMP are off by more than the aforementioned intervals, the due date should be recalculated based on the ultrasound findings.
The visit should end with an adequate explanation of all patient/partner
concerns. Women should be counseled that sexual activity is not associated
with any harm during an uncomplicated pregnancy, although there may be
conditions that arise during the course of a pregnancy that would make sexual
activity inadvisable. A follow-up visit should be scheduled prior to her leaving the office. She should also be educated about preterm labor precautions,

CLINICAL CASES

51

signs of ectopic pregnancy, and situations in which to call the physician or go
to the obstetrics triage unit for evaluation.

Subsequent Visits
At follow-up prenatal visits, concerns or questions brought up by the patient
should be addressed. The examiner should ask questions specifically targeted at
symptoms suggestive of complications that include gestational hypertension,
preeclampsia, infections (urinary tract, vaginal, etc), fetal compromise, placenta previa/abruption, and preterm labor or premature rupture of membranes.
At each visit, the patient should be asked about vaginal bleeding, loss of fluid,
headaches, visual changes, abdominal pain, dysuria, facial or upper-extremity
edema, vaginal discharge, and subjective sensation of fetal movements.
The examination on each subsequent visit should include weight, blood
pressure, fundal height measurement, and fetal heart tones by hand-held
Doppler. In addition, a urinalysis should be performed at every visit to assess
for protein, glucose, or infection.

Subsequent Testing and Laboratory Studies
At 15 to 20 weeks’ gestation (preferably between 16 and 18 weeks’ gestation)
a multiple marker test, which screens for Trisomy 21, Trisomy 18, and neural
tube defects, should be offered to patients. The two most common modalities
of screening the fetus for these anomalies are the triple screen and the quad
screen. The triple screen tests for serum human chorionic gonadotropin
(hCG), unconjugated estriol, and α-fetoprotein; the quad screen tests for
those three plus inhibin-A. The triple screen has a sensitivity of approximately 65% to 69% and specificity of 95% for detecting aneuploidy. The
quad screen increases sensitivity to approximately 80% without reducing
specificity. The most common cause for a false-positive serum screen is incorrect gestational age dating. In some centers, fetal nuchal translucency can be
measured by ultrasonography combined with maternal serum analyte levels
(ie, free hCG and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A [PAPP-A]). This
testing can be performed at 10- to 14-week gestation. Sensitivity and specificity of these tests is determined by the risk cutoff used (eg, for trisomy 21,
sensitivity is 85.2% when specificity is 90.6%; at 95% specificity, the sensitivity is 78.7%). Women should be counseled about the limited sensitivity
and specificity of the tests, the psychological implications of a positive test,
the potential impact of delivering a child with Down syndrome, the risks associated with prenatal diagnosis and second-trimester abortion, and delays
inherent in the process.
Women at increased risk of aneuploidy should be offered prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Persons at increased

52

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

risk include women who will be older than 35 years at delivery and who have
a singleton pregnancy (older than 32 years at delivery for women pregnant
with twins); women carrying a fetus with a major structural anomaly identified by ultrasonography; women with ultrasound markers of aneuploidy (including increased nuchal thickness); women with a previously affected pregnancy;
couples with a known translocation, chromosome inversion, or aneuploidy;
and women with a positive maternal serum screen. Amniocentesis may be
performed after 15-week gestation and is associated with a 0.5% risk of spontaneous abortion. CVS is performed at 10- to 12-week gestation and has a 1%
to 1.5% risk of spontaneous abortion. CVS may be associated with transverse
limb defects (1 per 3000 to 1 per 1000 fetuses). Women undergoing CVS also
should be offered maternal serum α-fetoprotein testing for neural tube defects.
Women older than age 35 years at time of delivery may opt for serum screening
and ultrasonography before deciding whether to proceed with amniocentesis.
Although the risk for trisomy 21 increases with maternal age, an estimated
75% of affected fetuses are born to mothers younger than age 35 years at
time of delivery.
The ACOG and the American Diabetes Association recommend that all
pregnant women be screened for gestational diabetes at 24 to 28 weeks’ gestation, except women who are at low risk (eg, younger than age 25 years,
belonging to a low-risk ethnic group, normal prepregnancy weight, no history
of abnormal glucose metabolism, no previous poor obstetric outcomes, and no
first-degree relatives with diabetes). Screening is standard in the United
States, with 94% of physicians reporting universal screening.
At 24 to 28 weeks’ gestation, patients should be screened for gestational
diabetes with a 1-hour 50 g glucose challenge test. Most guidelines consider a
value above 140 mg/dL as abnormal, whereas new studies advocate using a
value of 135 mg/dL. A value of 200 mg/dL or greater is generally diagnostic of
gestational diabetes. When the screening test is positive, a 3-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) should be performed (after an overnight fast) by giving the
patient a 100-g glucose load and obtaining fasting, 1-hour, 2-hour, and 3-hour
postload serum glucose samples; two out of four positive values generally
establishes the diagnosis of gestational diabetes. A diagnosis of gestational
diabetes impacts the pregnancy, but also increases the risk of type II diabetes
in the patient throughout her life.
At 28 weeks’ gestation, a repeat RPR and hemoglobin/hematocrit should
be obtained in those at risk for syphilis and anemia, respectively. In addition,
a patient who is Rh-negative should receive RhO(D) immune globulin
(RhOGAM) at this time. An Rh-negative patient should also receive RhO(D)
immune globulin at delivery and in any instance of trauma. Nonsensitized,
Rh-negative women also should be offered a dose of RhO(D) immune globulin
after spontaneous or induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy termination, CVS,
amniocentesis, cordocentesis, external cephalic version, abdominal trauma,
and second- or third-trimester bleeding. Administration of RhO(D) immune

CLINICAL CASES

53

globulin can be considered before 12-week gestation in women with a threatened abortion and live embryo, but Rh alloimmunization is rare.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and ACOG recommend
that all women be offered group B Streptococcus (GBS) screening by vaginorectal culture at 35 to 37 weeks’ gestation and that colonized women be
treated with intravenous antibiotics at the time of labor or rupture of membranes in order to reduce the risk of neonatal GBS infection. The proper
method of collection is to swab the lower vagina, perineal area, and rectum.
Of tested women, 10% to 30% will test positive for GBS colonization.
Because GBS bacteriuria indicates heavy maternal colonization, women with
GBS bacteriuria at any time during their pregnancy should be offered intrapartum antibiotics and do not require a vaginorectal culture. Similarly, women
with a previous infant who was diagnosed with a GBS infection should be
offered intrapartum antibiotics.
If a patient does not go into labor spontaneously by 42 weeks’ gestation,
induction of labor should be considered to reduce the risk of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Several studies have shown reduced risks with induction
at 41 weeks’ gestation. ACOG recommends testing for fetal well-being in prolonged pregnancies, starting in the 42nd week of gestation.

Vaccinations During Pregnancy
Women who will be in their third trimester during flu season should be offered
the influenza vaccine. Influenza vaccine is safe in any stage of pregnancy provided there is no allergy to any of its components. Tetanus toxoid vaccination
can also be given safely during pregnancy. Varicella and rubella vaccinations
are not advised during pregnancy. For pregnant mothers with a rubella nonimmune status, a rubella vaccination should be given after delivery of the infant.

B. A first trimester ultrasound
C. A second trimester ultrasound
D. A quantitative serum hCG level

54

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

4.2

A 38-year-old pregnant woman presents for initial visit at 12-week
gestation. She requests a “genetic screen” because she is concerned
about her advanced maternal age. She does not want any invasive
testing that may cause a potential miscarriage. Which of the following
is most appropriate to offer this patient?
A. If no prior personal or family history of genetic defects, no screen
is needed.
B. Draw and send blood for the triple or quad screen, as patient has
advanced maternal age.
C. Nuchal translucency screening and hCG and Pregnancy Associated
Pregnancy Protein A (PAPP-A) testing.
D. Offer the patient chorionic villus sampling.

4.3

A 28-year-old woman with a history of epilepsy presents for a preconception consultation visit. Which of the following is the most important advice to give to this patient?
A. Diabetes screening prior to pregnancy.
B. EEG reading that is normal prior to conception.
C. Preconception folate supplementation.
D. Stop epilepsy medication prior to pregnancy and through the first
trimester.

4.4

A 28-year-old G1 P0 woman at 16-week gestation is noted to be Rh
negative. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step for
this patient?
A. Administer RhΟGAM at this time.
B. Check the patient’s antibody screen (indirect Coombs).
C. Schedule the patient for amniocentesis to assess for isoimmunization.
D. Counsel the patient to terminate the pregnancy.

ANSWERS
4.1

B. A first trimester ultrasound is accurate to within ±1 week for gestational dating and would be the most accurate assessment of gestational age of the options listed.

4.2

C. In the 11- to 13-week gestational age, first trimester trisomy screening may be performed by ultrasound looking at a echolucent area
behind the fetal neck called the nuchal translucency. That measurement together with serum hCG and PAPP-A can give a risk for trisomy.

4.3

C. Women with a history of epilepsy should receive 1 mg of folic acid
supplementation daily to help prevent neural tube defects. In general
epilepsy medications should be continued, although the type of medication may be changed. For instance, valproic acid has a relatively
high rate of neural tube defects associated with its use, and if possible, another medication should be used.

CLINICAL CASES

4.4

55

B. For women who are Rh negative, the next step is to assess the antibody screen or indirect Coombs test. If the antibody screen is negative,
there is no isoimmunization, and RhOGAM is given at 28-week gestation and again at delivery if the baby is confirmed as Rh positive. The
RhOGAM is given to prevent isoimmunization. If the antibody screen
is positive and the identity of the antibody is confirmed as Rh (anti-D),
then assessment of its titer will assist in knowing the probability of
fetal effect. A low titer can be observed, whereas a high titer should
initiate further testing such as ultrasound and possibly amniocentesis.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The initial prenatal visit often is scheduled after fetal organogenesis has
occurred. For this reason, a preconception visit can be very beneficial.
Furthermore, when prescribing medications, physicians must consider the
possibility that any woman of reproductive age may become pregnant.
➤ Genetic counseling should be offered to any woman who will be 35 years
old or older at her estimated date of confinement (EDC).
➤ Folic acid supplementation is important for every woman, and the recommended daily dose is based on individual risk factors such as anticonvulsant therapy or a previous pregnancy with a neural tube defect.
➤ If all criteria are met, Naegele’s rule can be used to determine the EDC (subtract 3 months, add 7 days). If there is any uncertainty, the dating should
be confirmed by ultrasound, preferably in the first trimester.

Case 5
A 6-month-old male child is brought to your office by his mother for a
routine well-child visit. His mother is concerned that he is not yet saying “mama,” because her best friend’s baby said mama by age 6 months.
Your patient was born to a full-term, uncomplicated pregnancy to a
23-year-old G1P1 mother. He was delivered by a spontaneous vaginal delivery and there were no complications in the neonatal period. You have
been following him since his birth. He has had appropriate growth and
development up to this age and is up-to-date on his routine immunizations. He had one upper respiratory infection at age 5 months that was
treated symptomatically. There is no family history of any developmental, hearing, or speech disorders. He has been fed since birth with an
iron-fortified infant formula. Cereals and other baby foods were added
starting at age 4 months. He lives with both parents, neither of whom
smokes cigarettes.
On examination, he is a vigorous infant who is at the 50th percentile
for length and weight and 75th percentile for head circumference. His
physical examination is normal. On developmental examination, he is
seen to sit for a short period of time without support, reach out with one
hand for your examining light, pick up a Cheerio with a raking grasp
and put it in his mouth, and he is noted to babble frequently.

ANSWERS TO CASE 5:
Well-Child Care
Summary: A 6-month-old healthy child is brought in for a routine well-child
examination.
➤

Recommended immunizations for a 6-month well-child visit (in a child
who is up-to-date on routine immunizations): Diphtheria, tetanus, and
acellular pertussis (DTaP) no. 3, hepatitis B no. 3, Haemophilus influenzae
type b (Hib) no. 3 and rotavirus no. 3; inactivated polio vaccine no. 3
can be given between 6 and 15 months of age.

➤

Age by which a child should say “mama” and “dada”: Most children will
start to say “dada” or “mama” nonspecifically between ages 6 and 9 months.
It usually becomes specific between ages 8 and 12 months.

➤

Recommendations for continuing in a rear-facing car seat: A child should
stay in a rear-facing car seat until the child weighs at least 20 lb and is at least
1 year old.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the basic components of a well-child examination.
2. Know the routine immunization schedule for children.
3. Know common developmental milestones for young children.

Considerations
The pediatric well-child examination serves many valuable purposes. It provides an opportunity for parents, especially first-time parents, to ask questions
about, and for the physician to address specific concerns regarding, their
child. It allows the physician to assess the child’s growth and development in
a systematic fashion and to perform an appropriate physical examination. It
also allows for a review of both acute and chronic medical conditions. When
performed at recommended time intervals, it gives the opportunity to provide
age-appropriate immunizations, screening tests, and anticipatory guidance.
Finally, it supports the development of a good doctor-patient-family relationship, which can promote health and serve as an effective tool in the management of illness.

Well-Child Examination
DEFINITIONS
AMBLYOPIA: Reduction in loss of vision in one eye from lack of use.

Strabismus is the most common cause of amblyopia.
STRABISMUS: Ocular misalignment.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pediatric History
For the purposes of routine well-child visits, a comprehensive history should
be obtained at the initial visit with more focused, interval histories obtained
at subsequent encounters. The initial history should include an opportunity
for the parent to raise any questions or concerns that the parent may have.
New parents, especially first-time parents and young parents, often have many
questions or anxieties about their child. The ability to discuss them with the
physician will help to engender a positive physician-patient-family relationship and improve the parent’s satisfaction with their child’s care.
A complete past medical history should be obtained. This should start with
a detailed prenatal and pregnancy history, including the duration of the pregnancy, any complications of pregnancy, any medications taken, the type of
delivery performed, the child’s birth weight, and any neonatal problems. Any
significant chronic or acute illnesses should be recorded. The use of any medications, both prescription and over-the-counter, should be reviewed.
A detailed family history, including information (when available) on both
maternal and paternal relatives should be obtained. A thorough social history
is critical in pediatric care. Information, including the parents’ education levels,
relationships, religious beliefs, use of substances (tobacco, alcohol, drugs) and
socioeconomic factors can provide significant insight into the health and
development of the child.
Efforts should be made to obtain old medical records, if any are available.
Growth charts, immunization records, results of screening tests, and other valuable information that can assist with the child’s assessment and reduce the unnecessary duplication of previously performed interventions can often be found.

Growth
At each well-child visit, the child’s height and weight should be recorded and
plotted on a standard growth chart. Head circumference is measured and plotted in children 3 years of age and younger. Children older than age 3 years

60

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

should have their blood pressure recorded using an appropriate-size pediatric
cuff. Significant variances from accepted, age-adjusted, population norms, or
growth that deviates from predicted growth curves, may warrant further evaluation. Failure to thrive is defined by some as weight below the third or fifth percentile for age, and by others as decelerations of growth that have crossed two
major growth percentiles in a short period of time. Either significant loss or gain
of weight may prompt an in-depth discussion of nutrition and caloric intake.

Development
An assessment of the child’s development in the areas of gross motor, fine
motor/adaptive, language, and social/personal skills is an important aspect of
each well-child visit. Numerous screening tools, such as the Denver II developmental screening test, the Parents’ Evaluations of Developmental Status
(PEDS), and others, are available to assist with these assessments. These assessments typically involve both responses from the parents regarding the child’s
behavior at home and observations of the child in the office setting. Persistent
delays in development, either globally or in individual skill areas, should
prompt a more in-depth developmental assessment, as early intervention may
effectively aid in the management of some developmental abnormalities.
Table 5–1 summarizes many of the important motor, language, and social
developmental milestones of early childhood.

Screening Tests
There are a variety of screening tests used to prevent disease and promote
proper developmental and physical growth. These include tests for congenital
diseases, lead screening, evaluating children for anemia, and hearing and vision
screens.
Each state requires screening of all newborns for specified congenital diseases; however, the specific diseases for which screening is done vary from state
to state. All states require testing for phenylketonuria (PKU) and congenital hypothyroidism, as early treatment can prevent the development of profound
mental retardation. Diseases for which testing commonly occurs include hemoglobinopathies (including sickle cell disease), galactosemia, and other inborn
errors of metabolism. This screening is done by collecting blood from newborns
prior to discharge from the hospital. In some states, newborn screening is
repeated at the first routine well visit, usually at about 2 weeks of age.
Nationwide, the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning has declined, primarily because of the use of unleaded gasoline and lead-free paints. However,
in some communities, the risk of lead exposure is higher. Universal screening
for lead poisoning is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics for children at ages 9 to
12 months and again at age 2 years in communities where 27% or more of

homes were built before 1950 or where 12% or more of children have a venous
lead concentration more than 10 μg/dL. In other communities, screening
should be targeted to high-risk children (Table 5–2).
Iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia in children. Ironcontaining formula and cereals have helped to reduce the occurrence of iron
deficiency. Children who drink more than 24 oz of cow’s milk, have ironrestricted diets, or were low birth weight or preterm, or whose mother was iron
deficient, are at higher risk. Iron deficiency can be evaluated by a hemoglobin
or hematocrit measurement, usually taken between 6 and 12 months of age.
Repeat testing can be considered annually, especially in high-risk children, up
through the age of 5 years. An anemic child can empirically be given a trial of
an iron supplement and dietary modification. Failure to respond to iron therapy should warrant further evaluation of other causes of anemia.
Most states now mandate newborn hearing screening by auditory brainstem
response or evoked otoacoustic emission. All high-risk infants, regardless of

Table 5–2 ELEMENTS OF A LEAD RISK QUESTIONNNAIRE
Recommended questions
• Does your child live in or regularly visit a house built before 1950? This could include
a day care center, preschool, the home of a babysitter or relative, and so on.

• Does your child live in or regularly visit a house built before 1978 with recent, ongoing, or planned renovation or remodeling?

• Does your child have a sister or brother, housemate, or playmate who is being followed for lead poisoning?

Questions that may be considered by region or locality
• Does your child live with an adult whose job (eg, at a brass/copper foundry, firing
range, automotive or boat repair shop, or furniture refinishing shop) or hobby (eg,
electronics, fishing, stained-glass making, pottery making) involves exposure to lead?
• Does your child live near a work or industrial site (eg, smelter, battery recycling plant)
that involves the use of lead?
• Does your child use pottery or ingest medications that are suspected of having a high
lead content?
• Does your child have exposure to burning lead-painted wood?

requirement, should be screened. High-risk infants include those with a family history of childhood hearing loss, craniofacial abnormalities, syndromes
associated with hearing loss (such as neurofibromatosis), or infections associated with hearing loss (such as bacterial meningitis). Older infants and toddlers
can be assessed for hearing problems by questioning the parents or performing
office testing by snapping fingers, or by using rattles or other noisemakers.
Office-based audiometry can usually be performed in children aged 3 years
and older. Any hearing loss should be promptly evaluated and referred for
early intervention, if necessary.
Vision screening can also start in the newborn nursery. Evaluation of the
neonate for red reflexes on ophthalmoscopy should be a standard part of the
newborn examination. The presence of red reflexes helps to rule out the possibility of congenital cataracts and retinoblastoma. The evaluation of an older
infant should include a subjective evaluation of the child’s vision by the parent. Infants should be able to focus on a face by age 1 month and should move
their eyes consistently and symmetrically by age 6 months. An examining
light should reflect symmetrically off of both corneas; asymmetric light reflex
may be a sign of strabismus. The cover-uncover test also is a screening examination for strabismus. The child focuses on an object with both eyes and the
examiner covers one eye. Strabismus is suggested when the uncovered eye
deviates to focus on the object. Strabismus should be referred to a pediatric

CLINICAL CASES

65

ophthalmologist as soon as it is detected, as early intervention results in a
lower incidence of amblyopia. After the age of 3 years, most children can be
tested for visual acuity using a Snellen chart, modified with a “tumbling E” or
pictures, instead of letters.
Other screening tests may be recommended for high-risk children. Tuberculosis
(TB) screening is recommended for children who were born or live in a region
of high TB prevalence or who have close contact with someone known to
have TB. The Mantoux test is the screening test of choice; the multiple puncture tine test is no longer recommended. Screening for hyperlipidemia in children is controversial but may be appropriate if there is a family history of
hyperlipidemia or of premature coronary artery disease.

Anticipatory Guidance
A primary feature of the well-child visit should be education of the patient
and family on issues that promote health and prevent illness, injury, or death.
This anticipatory guidance should be focused and age appropriate. The use of
preprinted handouts can reinforce issues discussed in the office, address issues
that could not be discussed because of time limitations, and allow for the parent to review the information as needed at home. Subjects that should routinely be addressed include injury prevention, nutrition, development, discipline,
exercise, mental health issues, and the need for ongoing care (eg, immunization schedules, future well-child visits, dental care).
Accidents and injuries are the leading cause of death in children older
than age 1 year. Accidents involving motor vehicles, both traffic and pedestrian accidents, are the leading cause of these accidental deaths. All states now
require the use of car safety seats for children, although the regulations vary
from state to state. The general recommendation is that a child should be in
the back seat of the vehicle whenever possible. If there is no back seat, the
child should only ride in the front seat if there is no air bag or if the air bag can
be disabled. A child should sit in a rear-facing car seat until the child is both
1 year old and weighs at least 20 lb. A child older than 1 year and between
20 and 40 lb should use a forward-facing car seat. When the child weighs more
than 40 lb, the child may use a booster-type seat along with the lap and shoulder seatbelts. The child can stop using the booster when the child can sit with
his or her back squarely against the back of the seat with the legs bent at the
knees over the front of the seat. The child usually will need to be at least 4’9”
in height and 8 to 12 years of age to meet these requirements. No child should
ride in the front seat unless they are 13 years of age or older.
The leading cause of death of infants younger than 1 year of age is sudden
infant death syndrome (SIDS). The Back To Sleep campaign advises parents
to place their infant on the infant’s back—not abdomen or side—when the
infant is put down to sleep, as this reduces the risk of dying of SIDS. In addition, the infant should be placed on a firm mattress with nothing else in the

66

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

crib—this includes pillows, positioning devices, and toys. Heavy coverings
and soft mattresses have been associated with an increased risk of SIDS.
As children get older, anticipatory guidance on other safety issues become
important. As children learn to crawl and walk, stairwells should be blocked
to reduce the risk of injuries from falling. Cleaning supplies, medications, and
other potential poisons need to be stored safely out of reach of children,
preferably in locked cabinets. Similarly, firearms should be stored safely,
preferably unloaded and in locked cabinets or safes. Older children should be
advised regarding the importance of wearing a helmet while riding a bicycle,
skateboard, scooter, or other similar vehicle. All families should be advised to
have smoke detectors throughout the home, especially in rooms where people
sleep, and to keep the hot water heater set at or below 120°F to reduce the
risk of scald injuries.
Nutrition is another important area of anticipatory guidance. Infants younger
than 1 year old should be breast-fed or receive an iron-containing formula.
Cereals and other baby foods can be introduced between 4 and 6 months of
age. Whole cow’s milk is introduced at 12 months and continued until at least
the age of 2 years, before considering changing to reduced fat milk.

Immunizations
Ensuring that each child has received the child’s age-appropriate immunizations is a key component of each well-child visit. The child’s immunization status
also should be reviewed at acute care visits. Minor illnesses, even those causing
low-grade fevers, are not contraindications to vaccinating children, allowing an
acute care visit to be an excellent opportunity to provide this service. True contraindications to providing a vaccination include a history of an anaphylactic
reaction to a specific vaccine or vaccine component or a severe illness, with
or without a fever. Figure 5–1 shows the recommended childhood vaccination
schedule. Catch-up schedules for children who are either completely unimmunized or who have missed doses of the recommended vaccines are published by
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

and speech. Which of the following is the most accurate statement?
A. By 3 months of age, a child should be able to sit up without support.
B. By 6 months of age, a child should be able to transfer objects from
one hand to another.
C. By 9 months of age, a child should be able to walk.
D. By 12 months of age, a child should be able to put two words
together.

A 5-year-old presents to your clinic for a school physical. The child
weighs 42 lb and is up-to-date on his immunizations. Which of the following anticipatory guidances is most appropriate for a child at this age?
A. He should ride in a rear-facing car seat in the back seat of the vehicle.
B. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the
vehicle.
C. He should ride in a forward-facing car seat in the front seat of the
vehicle.
D. He should ride in a booster seat in the back seat of the vehicle.

5.3

A 4-month-old infant is brought into the family physician’s office for
routine checkup and immunizations. Which of the following vaccines
is routinely recommended at this time?
A. Diphtheria, tetanus, acellular pertussis (DTaP)
B. Oral polio vaccine (OPV)
C. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR)
D. Varicella

5.4

A 5-year-old child is brought into the pediatrician’s office for immunization and physical examination. The mother is concerned that her
child is a little “under the weather.” Which of the following is a contraindication to vaccinating the child?
A. Acute otitis media with a temperature of 100°F requiring antibiotic therapy
B. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of fever and fussiness
that lasted for 2 days
C. History of an allergic reaction to penicillin
D. Previous vaccination reaction that consisted of wheezing and
hypotension

CLINICAL CASES

ANSWERS
5.1

B. It is critical to understand the normal milestones for gross motor,
fine motor, speech and social categories. Delay in one or more areas
can indicate problems which if addressed can alleviate long-term
issues. Most 6-month-old children would be expected to sit without
support. Six-month-old children would also be expected to transfer
objects from one hand to the other, roll from a prone to supine position, babble, and recognize strangers.

5.2

D. A child who weighs more than 20 lb and is older than 1 year of
age may sit in a forward-facing car seat in the back seat of the car.
A child who weighs more than 40 lb is usually big enough to use a
booster seat, also in the back seat of the car.

5.3

A. DTaP is routinely recommended at ages 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months,
and at 4 to 6 years of age. Oral polio vaccination is no longer routinely
recommended in children; the inactivated, injectable polio vaccine is
recommended in its place. MMR vaccination is recommended at ages
12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years. Varicella vaccination is recommended at ages 12 to 15 months and 4 to 6 years.

5.4

D. A previous anaphylactic reaction is a true contraindication to vaccination. Minor illnesses or vaccination reactions, even with fever,
are not contraindications. Penicillin is not a component of vaccines
and history of allergy to this medication is not a contraindication.

Clinical Pearls
➤ True contraindications to providing vaccinations are rare; acute care visits
are an excellent opportunity to provide childhood vaccinations.
➤ SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants younger than age 1 year.
Parents should place their children on their “Back-to-Sleep.”

Case 6
A 35-year-old woman with a history of asthma presents to your office
with symptoms of nasal itching, sneezing, and rhinorrhea. She states she
feels this way most days but her symptoms are worse in the spring and
fall. She has had difficulty sleeping because she is always congested. She
states she has taken diphenhydramine (Benadryl) with no relief. She
does not smoke cigarettes and does not have exposure to passive smoke
but she does have two cats at home. On examination, she appears tired
but is in no respiratory distress. Her vital signs are temperature, 98.8°F;
blood pressure, 128/84 mm Hg; pulse, 88 beats/min; and respiratory rate,
18 breaths/min. The mucosa of her nasal turbinates appear swollen
(boggy) and have a pale, bluish-gray color. Thin and watery secretions
are seen. No abnormalities are seen on ear examination. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy noted and her lungs are clear.

ANSWERS TO CASE 6:
Allergic Disorders
Summary: A 35-year-old asthmatic woman complains of chronic nasal congestion that is worse in the spring and the fall.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Allergic rhinitis.

➤

Next step in management of this patient: Treatment with antihistamines,
decongestants, or intranasal steroids. These treatments can also be used in
combination with each other.

➤

Considerations and possible complications of therapy:. Recognition and
reduction of potential allergen exposure will yield more success in management than pharmacotherapy alone. Excessive use of topical decongestants
can cause rebound congestion

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the inflammatory nature of allergic rhinitis.
2. Recognition of physical examination findings consistent with allergic rhinitis.
3. Develop an approach to the management of allergic rhinitis, including the
roles of pharmacotherapy and reduction of allergen exposure.
4. Recognition and management of asthma.
5. Identification of essential features and treatment of anaphylaxis.

Considerations
This patient presents with a classic history of allergic rhinitis. Her history of
itchy eyes, nasal congestion and discharge, and seasonal in nature (worse in
spring and fall) are all consistent with allergic rhinitis. Her examinations are
also consistent with the diagnosis. Her mucosa of her nasal turbinates appear
swollen (boggy) and have a pale, bluish-gray color. Thin and watery secretions are seen. The best therapy for this condition is avoidance of allergens,
but due to the probable allergy to pollen, this would be difficult in this case.
Nasal corticosteroids offer the most consistent symptomatic relief.

APPROACH TO
Allergic Disorders
DEFINITIONS
ALLERGIC RHINITIS: Inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergic
reaction to airborne substances.
ANAPHYLAXIS: Rapidly progressing, life-threatening allergic reaction,
mediated by IgE immediate hypersensitivity reaction.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Background
Rhinitis is inflammation of the nasal membranes and is characterized by any
combination of the following: sneezing, nasal congestion, nasal itching, and
rhinorrhea. The eyes, ears, sinuses, and throat can also be involved. Allergic
rhinitis is the most common cause of rhinitis, occurring in up to 20% of the
population.

Pathophysiology
Allergic rhinitis involves inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nose,
eyes, eustachian tubes, middle ear, sinuses, and pharynx. Inflammation of the
mucous membranes is characterized by a complex interaction of inflammatory
mediators but, ultimately, is triggered by an immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated
response to an extrinsic protein.
In susceptible individuals, exposure to certain foreign proteins leads to
allergic sensitization, which is characterized by the production of specific IgE
directed against these proteins. This specific IgE coats the surface of mast
cells, which are present in the nasal mucosa. When the specific allergen is
inhaled into the nose, it can bind to the IgE in the mast cells, leading to a
delayed release of a number of mediators.
Mediators that are immediately released include histamine, tryptase, chymase, and kinase. Mast cells quickly synthesize other mediators, including
leukotrienes and prostaglandin D2. Symptoms can occur quickly after exposure.
Mucous glands are stimulated, leading to increased secretions. Vasodilation
occurs, causing congestion. Stimulation of sensory nerves leads to sneezing and
itching. Other symptoms include the redness and tearing of eyes, postnasal
drip, and ear pressure.

74

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Over the next 4 to 8 hours, these mediators, through a complex interplay
of events, recruit neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages to
the mucosa. These inflammatory cells cause more congestion and mucus production that may persist for hours or days. Systemic effects, including fatigue,
sleepiness, and malaise, can result from the inflammatory response as well.

History
Obtaining a detailed history is important in the evaluation of allergic rhinitis, as
specific triggers may be identified. Evaluation should include the nature, duration, and time course of symptoms. The recent use of medications is another
important consideration. Other aspects include a family history of allergic diseases, environmental exposures, and comorbid conditions.
Part of the history should include the time pattern of symptoms and whether
symptoms occur at a consistent level throughout the year (perennial rhinitis),
only occur in specific seasons (seasonal rhinitis), or a combination of the two.
Trigger factors, such as exposure to pollens, mold spores, specific animals, or
cleaning of the house, can sometimes be identified. Irritant triggers, such as
smoke, pollution, and strong smells can aggravate symptoms of allergic rhinitis.
Response to treatment with antihistamines supports the diagnosis of allergic
rhinitis.

Symptoms
Symptoms that can be associated with allergic rhinitis include sneezing, itching (of nose, eyes, or ears), rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, congestion, anosmia,
headache, earache, tearing, red eyes, and drowsiness.

Physical Examination
Common findings on examination include “allergic shiners,” which are dark
circles around the eyes related to vasodilation or nasal congestion. The “nasal
crease” can be seen in some cases. It is a horizontal crease across the lower half
of the bridge of the nose caused by repeated upward rubbing of the tip of the
nose by the palm of the hand (“allergic salute”).
Examination of the nose may reveal mucosa of the nasal turbinates to be
swollen (boggy) and have a pale, bluish-gray color. Assessment of the character and quantity of nasal mucus may be helpful in ascertaining a diagnosis.
Thin and watery secretions are frequently associated with allergic rhinitis,
whereas thick and purulent secretions are usually associated with sinusitis.
The characteristic of the mucous is not always diagnostic, as thick, purulent,
colored mucus can also occur with allergic rhinitis.
The nasal cavity should be inspected for growths such as polyps or tumors.
Polyps are firm, gray masses that are often attached by a stalk, which may not
be visible. After spraying a topical decongestant, polyps do not shrink, whereas

CLINICAL CASES

75

the surrounding nasal mucosa does shrink. Examine the nasal septum to look
for any deviation or septal perforation that may be present as a consequence
of chronic rhinitis, granulomatous disease, cocaine abuse, prior surgery, topical decongestant abuse, or, rarely, topical steroid overuse.
Otoscopy should be performed to look for tympanic membrane retraction,
air-fluid levels, or bubbles. Performing pneumatic otoscopy can be considered
to look for abnormal tympanic membrane mobility. These findings can be
associated with allergic rhinitis, particularly if eustachian tube dysfunction or
secondary otitis media is present. Ocular examination may reveal findings of
injection and swelling of the palpebral conjunctivae, with excess tear production. Dennie-Morgan lines (prominent creases below the inferior eyelid)
are associated with allergic rhinitis.
“Cobblestoning” of the posterior pharynx is often observed. This is caused by
the presence of streaks of lymphoid tissue on the posterior pharynx. Tonsillar
hypertrophy can also be seen. The neck should be examined for the presence of
lymphadenopathy. The respiratory system must be examined for findings consistent with asthma. These include wheezing, tachypnea, and a prolonged expiratory phase of respiration.

CAUSES OF ALLERGIC RHINITIS
The causes of allergic rhinitis can differ depending on whether the symptoms
are seasonal, perennial, or sporadic/episodic. Some patients are sensitive to
multiple allergens and can have perennial allergic rhinitis with seasonal exacerbations. Although food allergy can cause rhinitis, particularly in children, it
is rarely a cause of allergic rhinitis in the absence of gastrointestinal or skin
symptoms. Seasonal allergic rhinitis is commonly caused by allergy to seasonal
pollens and outdoor molds.

Pollens (Tree, Grass, and Weed)
Tree pollens, which vary by geographic location, are typically present in high
counts during the spring, although some species produce their pollens in the
fall. Grass pollens also vary by geographic location. Most of the common grass
species are associated with allergic rhinitis. A number of these grasses are
cross-reactive, meaning that they have similar antigenic structures (ie, proteins recognized by specific IgE in allergic sensitization). Consequently, a person who is allergic to one species is also likely to be sensitive to a number of
other species. The grass pollens are most prominent from the late spring through
the fall, but can be present year-round in warmer climates.
Weed pollens also vary geographically. Many weeds, such as short ragweed,
a common cause of allergic rhinitis in much of the United States, are most
prominent in the late summer and fall. Other weed pollens are present yearround, particularly in warmer climates.

76

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Perennial allergic rhinitis is typically caused by allergens within the home,
but can also be caused by outdoor allergens that are present year-round. In
warmer climates, grass pollens can be present throughout the year. In some
climates, individuals may be symptomatic because of trees and grasses in the
warmer months and molds and weeds in the winter.

House Dust Mites
In the United States, two major house dust mite species are associated with
allergic rhinitis. These mites feed on organic material in households, particularly the skin that is shed from humans and pets. They can be found in carpets, upholstered furniture, pillows, mattresses, comforters, and stuffed toys.

Animals
Allergy to indoor pets is a common cause of perennial allergic rhinitis. Cat and
dog allergies are encountered most commonly in clinical practice. However,
allergies have been reported to occur with most of the furry animals and birds
that are kept as indoor pets. Although cockroach allergy is most frequently
considered to be a cause of asthma, particularly in the inner city, it can also
cause perennial allergic rhinitis in infested households. Rodent infestation
may also be associated with allergic sensitization.

TREATMENT
The management of allergic rhinitis consists of three major categories of treatment: allergen avoidance, pharmacologic management, and immunotherapy.
All aspects of treatment are more successful when exposure to allergens is
decreased. Exposure to common allergens, such as dust mites, can be enhanced
by methods such as removing the carpets from homes and encasing bedding in
plastic.
Pharmacotherapy can involve the use of antihistamines, decongestants,
intranasal corticosteroids, and, in severe cases, systemic corticosteroids.
Antihistamines competitively antagonize the receptors for histamine, which
is released from mast cells. This reduces the production of symptoms mediated
by the release of histamine. “First-generation” antihistamines, including diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, and hydroxyzine, are inexpensive and available over-the-counter. Side effects include sedation and the anticholinergic
effects of dry mouth, dry eyes, blurred vision, and urinary retention. Newer, socalled second-generation antihistamines, including loratadine, fexofenadine,
and cetirizine, have much less penetration into the central nervous system,
resulting in a lower incidence of sedation as a side effect. They also have fewer
anticholinergic effects. They are, however, significantly more expensive than
the older agents. Loratadine and cetirizine have recently become available
without a prescription.

Decongestants, either given orally or intranasally, can be used to provide
symptomatic relief of nasal congestion. These agents constrict blood vessels in
the nasal mucosa and reduce the overall volume of the mucosa. The most
commonly used agent is pseudoephedrine, an α-adrenoreceptor agonist. Oral
decongestants can cause tachycardia, tremors, and insomnia. Rebound hyperemia and worsening of symptoms can occur with chronic use or upon discontinuation of nasal decongestants.
Corticosteroid nasal sprays are effective for the long-term management of
allergic rhinitis. They reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and
the recruitment of inflammatory cells. Systemic absorption of the steroid is
relatively low, reducing the risk of complications associated with the chronic
use of systemic corticosteroids. Side effects include nosebleeds, pharyngitis,
and upper respiratory tract infections.
Leukotriene inhibitors are indicated both for allergic rhinitis and for
maintenance therapy for persistent asthma. They are particularly useful in
patients with both asthma and allergies or in those whose asthma may be triggered by allergens. Leukotriene inhibitors are taken orally and are only available by prescription.
Oral corticosteroids are potent inhibitors of cell-mediated immunity. The
use of systemic steroids is limited by adverse effects, including suppression of
the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and hyperglycemia. Long-term use
can lead to peptic ulcer formation, increased susceptibility to infection, poor
wound healing, and the reduction of bone density. Because of these significant
risks, systemic steroids are used only for severe allergies and are used in the
lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time.
Desensitization therapy is frequently attempted in patients who remain
symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy. The first step of this treatment is
to test for specific antigens to which the person is allergic. The second step is to
inject the patient with highly diluted concentrations of this antigen. The concentration of the antigen(s) in the injection is gradually increased, in an effort
to reduce the patient’s inflammatory response to the antigen(s). Injections are
typically given weekly or biweekly. This process is expensive, time-consuming,
and requires numerous injections. Patients and physicians must be prepared to
address severe, even anaphylactic, reactions that may occur during the process.

ANAPHYLAXIS, URTICARIA, AND ANGIOEDEMA
Urticaria is characterized by large, irregularly shaped, pruritic, erythematous
wheals. Angioedema is painless, deep, subcutaneous swelling that often involves
the periorbital, circumoral, and facial regions. Anaphylaxis is a systemic reaction with cutaneous symptoms that is associated with dyspnea, visceral edema,
and hypotension. The manifestations of anaphylaxis include hypotension or
shock from widespread vasodilation, respiratory distress from bronchospasm
or laryngeal edema, gastrointestinal and uterine muscle contraction, and urticaria
and angioedema.

78

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

At the first suspicion of anaphylaxis, aqueous epinephrine 1:1000, in a
dose of 0.2 to 0.5 mL (0.2-0.5 mg) is injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Repeated injections can be given every 15 to 30 minutes when
necessary. Rapid intravenous infusion of large volumes of fluids (saline, lactated Ringer solution, plasma or plasma expanders) is essential to replace loss
of intravascular plasma into tissues. Airway obstruction may be caused by
edema of the larynx or by bronchospasm. Endotracheal intubation may be
required. Bronchospasm responds to subcutaneous epinephrine or terbutaline.
Antihistamines may be useful as adjuvant therapy for alleviating cutaneous
manifestations of urticaria or angioedema and pruritus. All patients with anaphylaxis should be monitored for a period of time, for example, 24 hours.

ASTHMA
Asthma is a chronic disease characterized by airway hyperresponsiveness.
There are recurrent muscle spasms of the bronchi and bronchioles. Essentials
of diagnosis include recurrent wheezing, shortness of breath, or cough, an increase
in airway secretions, and dyspnea. A history of allergies in children is also
common.
Asthma results in mild to severe obstruction to airflow in the tracheobronchial tree. Viral infections and allergens are two of the major triggers in
childhood asthma. A history of wheezing, shortness of breath, dyspnea, cough,
increased sputum production, and chest tightness is often found. The physical examination may reveal wheezing, increased expiratory phase, tachypnea,
cyanosis, tachycardia, or use of accessory respiratory muscles.
Asthma is classified as intermittent, mild persistent, moderate persistent or
severe persistent, based on the frequency of symptoms and the amount of airway obstruction (Table 6–1). Status asthmaticus is an obstruction that lasts
for days or weeks and is refractory to treatment.
Treatment involves the avoidance of triggers and the use of medications,
both to reduce the frequency of exacerbation and to relieve the acute symptoms. These medications include β-adrenergic agonists, inhaled corticosteroids,
leukotriene modifiers, mast cell stabilizers, and systemic corticosteroids.
The rapid acting β2-adrenergic agonist albuterol is the mainstay treatment
for acute symptomatic relief in asthma. It works to rapidly relax bronchial
smooth muscle. It also reduces the release of mast cell mediators and increases
mucociliary clearance. Long-acting β2-adrenergic agonists have the same
mechanism of action, but are not used for acute bronchospasm. They are effective at reducing the frequency of exacerbation in persistent asthma. The primary treatment of persistent asthma is the daily use of inhaled corticosteroids,
which reduce the production of inflammatory mediators and reduce vascular
permeability. They do not have an effect on smooth muscle relaxation and
should not be used for an acute exacerbation. Leukotriene inhibitors, which

CLINICAL CASES

79

either reduce the production of these inflammatory mediators (zileuton) or
competitively antagonize their receptors (zafirlukast, montelukast), are also
effective in the prevention of exacerbation in persistent asthma. Systemic
corticosteroids are used in the treatment of acute exacerbation and for prophylaxis in severe persistent asthma. Table 6–1 lists the specific indications
for uses of each medication.

CONJUNCTIVITIS
Conjunctivitis is an infection of the palpebral and/or bulbar conjunctiva. It is
the most common eye disease seen in community medicine. Most cases are
caused by bacterial or viral infection. Other causes include allergy and chemical irritants. The mode of transmission of infectious conjunctivitis is usually
direct contact to the opposite eye or to other persons via fingers, towels, or
handkerchiefs.
The organisms isolated most commonly in bacterial conjunctivitis are
Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Haemophilus, Moraxella, and Pseudomonas. There
is no blurring of vision and only mild discomfort. In severe cases, examination
of stained conjunctival scrapings and cultures are recommended. The disease is
usually self-limited, lasting about 10 to 14 days if untreated. A sulfonamide
instilled locally three times daily will usually clear the infection in 2 to 3 days.
Epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (pink eye) is highly contagious and spread
by person-to-person contact or fomites. The most common cause is adenovirus.
It is usually associated with pharyngitis, fever, malaise, and preauricular lymphadenopathy. Locally, the palpebral conjunctiva is red with a copious watery
discharge and scanty exudates. Local sulfonamide therapy might prevent secondary bacterial infection; hot compresses reduce the discomfort of the associated lid edema; weak topical steroids may be necessary to treat the corneal
infiltrates. The disease usually lasts at least 2 weeks.
Noninfectious causes of conjunctivitis include allergic and chemical irritants. Symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis include itching, tearing, redness,
stringy discharge, and sometimes photophobia. Treatment can include the
use of oral antihistamines or topical antihistamine or anti-inflammatory eye
drops.

Comprehension Questions
6.1

A 30-year-old man has both mild persistent asthma and chronic environmental allergies. Which of the following medications is indicated
for the management of this patient’s conditions?
A. Inhaled albuterol (short-acting β-adrenergic agonist)
B. Intranasal fluticasone (corticosteroid)
C. Oral montelukast (leukotriene modifier)
D. Oral cetirizine (second-generation antihistamine)

6.2

An 18-year-old adolescent male presents for follow-up of his asthma.
He has symptoms no more than 1 day per week and 1 night per month.
Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment for him?
A. Daily inhaled mometasone (inhaled corticosteroid)
B. As-needed use of inhaled albuterol
C. Daily use of salmeterol (a long-acting β-adrenergic agonist)
D. Daily use of zafirlukast (a leukotriene modifier)

6.3

A 56-year-old man presents to his physician with symptoms consistent
with allergic rhinitis. His past medical history is positive for benign prostatic hyperplasia. He continues to work in a warehouse as a forklift operator. Which of the following medications should be used to treat this
patient?
A. Diphenhydramine
B. Hydroxyzine
C. Chlorpheniramine
D. Fexofenadine

ANSWERS
6.1

C. Montelukast is indicated for both the management of persistent
asthma and chronic allergies. Nasal steroids and oral antihistamines
are indicated only for allergies.

6.2

B. This patient has mild intermittent asthma, as he has symptoms
less than twice per week and less than 2 nights per month. The recommended treatment for mild intermittent asthma is the as-needed
use of a short-acting inhaled β-agonist.

6.3

D. The second-generation antihistamines, such as fexofenadine, are
less sedating and have fewer anticholinergic side effects than the
first-generation antihistamines. They would be a better choice for
someone who operates heavy machinery and has benign prostatic
hyperplasia. However, they are no more effective at symptom relief
than the first-generation anti-histamines listed above.

CLINICAL CASES

Clinical Pearls
➤ The management of allergic rhinitis consists of three major categories
of treatment: allergen avoidance, pharmacological management, and
immunotherapy.
➤ For the diagnosis of asthma look for recurrent wheezing, cough, increase in
airway secretion, or dyspnea.
➤ At the first suspicion of anaphylaxis, aqueous epinephrine 1:1000 in a dose
of 0.2 to 0.5 mL (0.2-0.5 mg) is injected subcutaneously or intramuscularly.
The airway should always be assessed and patient intubated if necessary
to secure breathing.

Case 7
A 55-year-old man comes into your office for follow-up of a chronic
cough. He also complains of shortness of breath with activity. He reports
that this has been getting worse over time. As you are interviewing the
patient, you note that he smells of cigarette smoke. Upon further questioning, he reports smoking 1 pack of cigarettes per day for the past 35 years
and denies ever being advised to quit. On examination, he is in no respiratory distress at rest, his vital signs are normal, and he has no obvious
signs of cyanosis. His pulmonary examination is notable for reduced air
movement and faint expiratory wheezing on auscultation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 7:
Tobacco Use
Summary: A 55-year-old man with a 35 pack/year history of smoking presents
with a chronic cough and progressively worsening dyspnea.
➤

Recommendations to this patient: This patient should be advised to quit
smoking; one strategy, using the 5 As, is discussed below.

➤

Interventions available to help with smoking cessation: Counseling to
quit smoking along with pharmacologic assistance with bupropion, varenicline, or nicotine replacement.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the many medical conditions and complications related to tobacco
use.
2. Develop a framework for the discussion of tobacco use and promotion of
smoking cessation.
3. Know the currently available pharmacologic agents that are used to aide in
smoking cessation.

Considerations
This is a 55-year-old man with a long smoking history who presents with a
chronic cough and worsening dyspnea. The most important first steps are to
address the airway and breathing, and ensure that there is not a respiratory
emergency. Assessment of the patient’s air movement, oxygenation, and
degree of respiratory distress are important. After evaluating his condition and
ascertaining whether it is chronic lung disease or an exacerbation such as
bronchitis superimposed on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
therapy may be enacted. Bronchodilator therapy, antibiotic therapy depending on the character of the sputum and the chest radiograph findings are typically used. One critical component to therapy includes smoking cessation.
Physician intervention is paramount, and the use of adjuvant therapies helps
to increase the success.

Tobacco Cessation
DEFINITIONS
PREGNANCY CATEGORY B: FDA category for use of a medication in preg-

nancy in which animal studies have shown no harm to a fetus but human
studies are not available OR animal studies have shown harm to a fetus but
studies in pregnant women have not shown harm.
PREGNANCY CATEGORY C: Animal studies have shown adverse fetal
effects and there are no adequate studies in humans OR no animal studies
have been conducted and there are not adequate studies in humans.
PREGNANCY CATEGORY D: Human studies have shown potential adverse
fetal effects however the benefits of therapy may outweigh the potential risks.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Tobacco use is the single greatest cause of preventable death. It is responsible
for increased death rates from cancer, cardiac, cerebrovascular, and chronic
pulmonary disease. Approximately 20% of the adult population reported smoking in 2004 and over 400,000 deaths per year are a result of tobacco use. Smoking
also affects the health of those in close contact with people who smoke. Each
year, 38,000 deaths from cancer and heart disease in nonsmokers are attributable to secondhand smoke. Smoking in pregnancy is associated with prematurity, intrauterine growth restriction, stillbirth, spontaneous abortion, and infant
death. Smoking cessation reduces all of these risks. However, despite this evidence, it is difficult for smokers to quit. Health care providers are important in
the effort to reduce tobacco use and its related disease burden.
Research indicates that physician intervention, even in brief encounters,
increases tobacco cessation rate. Furthermore, cessation rates increase with
increased physician time and frequency of encounters to address tobacco use,
but the optimal duration and frequency has not been defined. The process of
discussing tobacco use and cessation involves several steps; one useful
framework is the “five As”:
• Ask about tobacco use: ask the patient at each visit about current tobacco use;
• Advise to quit through clear personalized messages: let the patient know of

his/her specific risks of tobacco use; in the sample case, talk to the patient
about how the persistent cough and dyspnea can be related to the tobacco
use and how cessation might be helpful;
• Assess willingness to quit: find out the patient’s thoughts about quitting
and if the patient is ready to proceed;

88

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

• Assist to quit: including counseling and pharmacologic treatment;
• Arrange follow-up and support.

Multiple factors may be part of a patient’s unwillingness to quit. A strategy to enhance motivation includes discussing the specific relevance to the
patient of smoking cessation, risks of ongoing tobacco use, rewards to quitting (financial, health, social), roadblocks to quitting (withdrawal, discouragement because of failed past attempts, enjoyment of smoking), and repetition
(readdressing the problem at each visit and reminding patients most people
attempt to quit several times before being successful).
In pregnancy, it has been found to be helpful to discuss specific risks to the
mother and fetus of continued tobacco use. While cessation prior to pregnancy
is ideal, cessation at any time during pregnancy is associated with health benefits for patient and fetus, so ongoing discussions are encouraged. The pregnant
patient will also need ongoing support after delivery to reduce the risk of remission after delivery.

Pharmacologic Therapy
In addition to counseling and reviewing the risks and benefits of quitting, the
use of pharmacologic aids can increase the likelihood of successful smoking
cessation when a patient has decided to quit. There are two broad modalities
approved by the FDA to assist with smoking cessation: nicotine replacement
and nonnicotine medications. Nictotine replacement products include gum,
patch, inhaler, nasal spray, and lozenge. The approved nonnicotine medications are bupropion sustained release (brand name: Zyban) and varenicline
(brand name: Chantix).
Bupropion was the first nonnicotine treatment for smoking cessation
approved by the FDA. It is thought to work by blocking uptake of norepinephrine and/or dopamine. It is contraindicated in patients with eating disorders, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor use in the last 2 weeks, or a
history of seizure disorder. The medication should be started 1 to 2 weeks
before the quit date and the usual dose is 150 mg a day for 3 days then 150 mg
twice a day. The usual course of treatment is 7 to 12 weeks, but it can be used
for up to 6 months as maintenance therapy. This treatment can be used alone
or in combination with nicotine-based treatments. In two studies comparing
bupropion sustained release to placebo, the cessation rate for the bupropion
group was 30%, compared to 17% in the placebo group.
Varenicline is the newest agent approved for assistance with smoking cessation. It is a nicotinic receptor partial agonist that may reduce cravings for
nicotine, reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms, and block some of the binding of nicotine from cigarettes. Its efficacy at assisting with smoking cessation
is similar to that of bupropion. It has not been studied for use with nicotine
supplementation or with bupropion. Varenicline has been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms, including changes in behavior, agitation, depression,

CLINICAL CASES

89

and suicidal behaviors. It should be used with caution in anyone with a history of psychiatric disorders and all persons using the medication should be
monitored closely for these behaviors.
Nicotine replacement therapies as a group increase smoking cessation rates
over placebo. They can be used in combination therapy, which may increase
cessation rates over monotherapy.
Nicotine gum is available in 2 mg and 4 mg of nicotine per piece. The
patient chews a piece of the gum until the patient feels a peppery taste in the
mouth, “parks” the gum in a cheek until the sensation goes away, and then
chews the gum again until the peppery sensation returns. The 4-mg dose is
recommended for those who smoke more than 25 cigarettes per day and the
2-mg dose for those who smoke fewer than 25 cigarettes per day. Common pitfalls include not “parking” the gum (ie, chewing constantly) and not using
enough pieces per day initially. Consider advising the patient to use the gum
on a scheduled basis, rather than as needed, initially, and then slowly tapering the number of pieces per day.
The nicotine cartridge inhaler is available by prescription and has also
been found to be effective in increasing smoking cessation rates. Each cartridge contains 4 mg of nicotine in 80 inhalations. The recommended dose is
6 to 16 cartridges per day. The inhaler can be used over several months, with
a gradual tapering of the dose. For both the gum and inhaler, acidic beverages
can reduce absorption of the nicotine from the buccal mucosa, so the patient
should avoid ingestion within 15 minutes of use of these products.
Another therapeutic option is the nicotine nasal inhaler. The inhaler provides 0.5 mg of nicotine per inhalation and can be used at a starting rate of
1 to 2 doses per hour, for a maximum of 40 doses per day (5 doses per hour).
The inhaler can also be used over months, with gradual tapering of the dose.
Nasal irritation is the most common side effect.
The nicotine patch is a passive nicotine replacement system, compared to
the other methods outlined above. There are two common over-the-counter
forms of the nicotine patch: Nicoderm CQ, which comes in multiple doses
(21, 14, and 7 mg of nicotine per patch) and are meant to be worn for 24 hours
a day, and Nicotrol, which has 15 mg of nicotine and is meant to be worn for
16 hours a day. The patch is replaced daily, and consideration should be given
to starting with higher-dose patches in heavy smokers. Treatment with the
patch for less than 8 weeks is as effective as longer treatment periods. The most
common side effect is irritation of the skin at the site of the patch.
The nicotine inhaler, nasal spray, and gum are pregnancy category D drugs;
the patch is pregnancy category C, and bupropion is pregnancy category C.
These products can be considered for use in the pregnant smoker if counseling is insufficient to promote cessation, and if, in discussion with the patient,
it is determined that the risks of continued smoking outweigh the risks of the
medication. Varenicline is pregnancy category C. It has not been studied in
pregnancy and should only be used if the benefit justifies the potential risk to
the fetus.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) strongly recommends screening all adults and pregnant patients for tobacco use and offering
cessation intervention for those who use tobacco products (Level A recommendation). At this time there is insufficient evidence to recommend for or
against screening children and adolescents for tobacco use or offering interventions to prevent tobacco use or promote cessation (Level I recommendation). However, as most smokers start in this age group, the USPSTF notes
that providers may use individual discretion when discussing tobacco use in
this population.

Comprehension Questions
7.1

A pregnant woman who smokes 1 pack of cigarettes a day asks for your
advice regarding smoking cessation while she is pregnant. Which of
the following statements is most appropriate?
A. Bupropion is pregnancy category C and relatively safe in pregnancy.
B. Varenicline is pregnancy category B and relatively safe in pregnancy.
C. Nicotine gum delivers a lower, safer dose of nicotine than the nasal
spray.
D. The use of smoking cessation products during pregnancy frequently
leads to adverse outcomes.

7.2

Which of the following statements regarding available treatments for
smoking cessation is accurate?
A. Bupropion can be used in combination with nicotine supplements.
B. Nicotine gum is most effective if chewed continuously, to promote
a constant release of the nicotine.
C. Nicotine supplements are most effective when used as needed for
withdrawal symptoms.
D. All of the available agents are more effective when used in combinations with each other.

7.3

Which of the following counseling strategies is most likely to enhance
your patients’ smoking cessation rates?
A. Discuss smoking cessation techniques only with patients who ask
for your advice, as others will resent your suggestions.
B. Emphasize primarily the health risks of smoking.
C. Note in each patient’s chart that you have discussed cessation, so
that you don’t repeat the message to the same patient at subsequent
visits.
D. Ask about smoking cessation at each encounter.

CLINICAL CASES

91

ANSWERS
7.1

A. Bupropion and Varenicline are both pregnancy category C.
However, pharmacologic aids to increase the rate of smoking cessation during pregnancy can be used, after discussion with the patient
of the risks and benefits of the medications and of continued smoking. Cessation of smoking at any time during the pregnancy is likely
to provide health benefits for the mother and fetus. Nicotine gum
delivers a higher does of nicotine than its nasal spray counterpart.

7.2

A. Bupropion can be used in combination with any of the nicotine
supplementation products. The nicotine products can also be used in
combination with each other. Varenicline has not been studied for
use with other smoking cessation agents. Two common pitfalls in using
nicotine supplementation are using supplementation only when having withdrawal symptoms and failing to use nicotine gum correctly.
The gum should be chewed briefly and then parked in the cheek. It
is less effective if chewed continuously.

7.3

D. Asking patients about tobacco use is a key to promoting cessation. It is important to ask each patient at each visit and to be prepared to provide advice and assistance at any time.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Most smokers require multiple attempts before successfully quitting for
good. Remind your patients of this if they become discouraged in their
efforts.
➤ Use the five As—Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, and Arrange follow-up—to
help your patients quit smoking.

Case 8
A 16-year-old adolescent female presents to your office with the complaint of greenish vaginal discharge for the past 2 months and the recent
onset of lower abdominal pain. She reports that her last period was
about 21/2 months ago. She is sexually active with two partners and has
never used a condom or any other contraception with either. On physical
examination she is not febrile with normal blood pressure and pulse. She has
greenish discharge from the cervix with friability and cervicitis. There is no
cervical motion tenderness. Her urine pregnancy test is positive. A cervical
sample is positive for Chlamydia and negative for N. gonorrhea. Her rapid
plasma reagin (RPR) is nonreactive and an HIV test is negative. The patient
is treated with appropriate antibiotics and counseled concerning safer
sex practices. You also inform the patient regarding her risk for HIV
conversion, even though today’s test was negative. The patient asks if you
are going to tell her mother that she is pregnant and has this infection.
You inform the patient that because of patient confidentiality and ethical
considerations you will not disclose this information to her mother
without her consent. She tells you that she does not want her mother to
know and she does not want her boyfriends to know she is infected.

ANSWERS TO CASE 8:
Medical Ethics
Summary: The patient is a teen who is pregnant and has a sexually transmitted infection. She engages in high-risk sexual behavior.
➤

What you should do and what you should tell the patient: You must
inform the patient that you have to contact the state health department.
The department will contact her and will contact her partners without disclosing her identity. You might also advise the patient to cooperate fully
with the health department to avoid phone calls or letters received at
home. It is also important to stress to the patient the importance of protecting her partners as well as herself, and that by disclosing to her partners, she
may avoid further exposure.

➤

Ethical considerations include: Teenage pregnancy, confidentiality, sexually transmitted infection reporting, and emancipation.

➤

Guidelines for reporting communicable diseases: The guidelines for
reporting communicable disease vary slightly from state to state. However,
there is usually a formal mechanism for reporting to the state department of
health. The physician may do it himself/herself or may elect to use an agent,
such as a nurse or other medical facility staff member. It is a federal mandate
to report communicable diseases; failure to do so may result in adverse legal,
civil, and even criminal actions. In the state of Texas, failure to report communicable diseases is considered a class B misdemeanor.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Discuss confidentiality and its ethical and legal considerations when treating adolescent or pregnant adolescent patients.
2. Understand the legal obligations for reporting communicable diseases and
informing partners.

Considerations
There are several considerations involved in this case. The first issue is pregnancy.
In some states, the patient would be considered emancipated. Consequently,
legally she can make decisions regarding her pregnancy-related health care
(excluding abortion) without notice to or the express consent of her parents.
In addition, she has a sexually transmitted infection, which is a reportable
condition; thus the physician or the physician’s agent must report this to the

CLINICAL CASES

95

state health department for surveillance and infection control. She is also
very concerned about informing her partners about the infection. There are
also issues of confidentiality.

APPROACH TO
Medical Ethics
DEFINITIONS
EMANCIPATION: Emancipation is a legal process in which a person who is
younger than the age of 18 years petitions the court to have herself/himself
declared a legal adult. Laws for emancipation vary by state. Emancipation
ends the parents’ legal duty to support the minor, and also ends the parents’
right to make decisions about the minor’s residence, education, health care,
and to control the minor’s conduct. However, this does not include the ability to consume alcohol, use tobacco, or exercise voting rights.
MATURE MINOR DOCTRINE/RULE (JUDICIAL BYPASS): The mature minor
exception to the need for parental consent for medical care is based on the
West Virginia Supreme Court case Belcher v. CAMC. Statute and court decisions in many states may vary. A minor may consent to receive medical care without the consent of the parents or guardian if deemed “mature” by the judicial
system.

CLINICAL APPROACH
According to the Society for Adolescent Medicine, “the overall goal in clinical practice is to deliver appropriate high quality healthcare to adolescent
patients, while encouraging communication between parents or other trusted
adults without betraying the adolescent’s trust in the healthcare professional.”
It is very important to gain the confidence of adolescent patients because if
the patient does not believe that the health-care provider will keep the
patient’s health information confidential, the patient is less likely to seek
health care when needed. Confidential health care should be provided for all
adolescent patients; however, the physician must consider some very important issues, including: Is the teen self-supporting? Is the minor mature enough
to make his or her own medical care decisions? Would disclosure without consent harm the patient?

Ethics
Ethical considerations when treating adolescent patients can be complex and one
should use the moral principles of ethics, which include autonomy, beneficence,

nonmaleficence, and justice to guide clinical decisions to maintain confidentiality. Respect for autonomy should involve respect for the patient’s wishes,
choices, and beliefs when deciding what is best for the patient. It is important
to understand the dynamics of the parent-child relationship and why the teen
does not want to disclose important medical information to parents. This type
of dialogue may reveal very important things about the child’s current situation and help to guide your decision making. Knowing the intricacies of the
family dynamic may also help the clinician and the patient develop solutions
to aid in disclosure of very important health-related issues.
Nonmaleficence implies that the physician will do nothing to harm the
patient, which includes emotional and psychological harm. Failure to maintain confidentiality may result in some emotional distress for the patient.
Moreover, the physician should not apply the same moral standards to every
patient. Some teens are more mature than others and the physician should use
his or her judgment with each adolescent patient.
In addition, the treating physician should apply the principle of beneficence,
which requires action to further a patient’s welfare. In other words, do the right
thing for the patient. Maintaining confidentiality may aid in full disclosure of
symptoms, life situations, and so on. Full disclosure of pertinent medial information can help the physician provide the most comprehensive care to the patient.
Justice implies the fair and nonbiased treatment of the patient regardless
of age, sex, or ethnicity. Consequently, adolescent patients should be given
the same level of care as adults, without having the fear of disclosure, when
they are mentally capable of receiving care.
In most cases, every attempt should be provided to ensure confidentiality.
However, there are instances when it would be in the best interest of the
patient to disclose medical information. Examples of these situations could
include patients with homicidal or suicidal ideation or serious chemical dependence, and in suspected cases of abuse. Disclosure of medical information should
only be considered when the life of the adolescent must be protected. It is also
important to point out that, in most cases, adolescents are not responsible for
payment of medical services. The parent or the guardian usually has to assume
the responsibility for payment. Thus, the maintenance of confidentiality in
these cases is an issue. Because there are no clear-cut guidelines in this situation,
it is important to encourage open dialogue between the patient and the patient’s
parent. However, in instances when this is not possible the physician must use
his or her own clinical judgment while considering ethical issues and must act
in the best interest of the patient.

Legal Considerations
There are laws in place to protect the confidentiality of health-care information. In general, the law requires the consent of the parent when health-care
is provided to minors; there are, however, exceptions, such as emergencies,

CLINICAL CASES

care for the “mature minor,” and when the minor is legally entitled to consent to their own medical treatment.
Laws that allow minors to consent to medical treatment vary from state to
state. In some states minors are allowed to consent to medical therapy based
on status, such as emancipation, marriage, pregnancy, living apart from parents, and when given the status of “mature minor.” The mature minor rule was
created in 1967 and is based on the West Virginia Supreme Court case Belcher v.
CAMC, which allowed health-care providers to treat a youth as an adult based
on an assessment and documentation of the adolescent’s maturity level. According
to this decision, a court must determine that a minor is deemed mature, which
determination is based on various factors, including age; ability; experience;
education and/or training; degree of maturity and/or judgment exhibited; conduct and demeanor; and capacity to understand the risk and benefits of medical
treatment. The process to become a mature minor is known as judicial bypass and
may vary from state to state. This exception to parental consent must be received
from a court.
In addition, adolescents may consent to medical care if they are considered emancipated. Emancipation implies that a minor must be of a certain age
(which varies by state), must live apart from his or her parents, and must be selfsufficient. Minors are also considered emancipated if they are self-supporting,
not living at home, married, pregnant or a parent, in the military, or declared
emancipated by the judicial system.
In some states, consent to health care may be based on the type of care
the adolescent is seeking. Examples of the types of health-care services that
may be obtained without parental consent may include maternity services; contraceptive management; treatment and diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (including HIV) or other reportable diseases; treatment of drug or alcohol
problems; and care related to sexual assault or mental health services. These
provisions are very important because they allow the necessary assessment and
treatment of important health-related issues. Moreover, research shows that
adolescents are more likely to seek medical care if confidentiality is protected.

Reportable Diseases
Reporting sexually transmitted infections (STIs), HIV, and other reportable
illnesses can be stressful for the patient. This may be particularly stressful for
the adolescent. The information may be reported by the physician or by the
physician’s designated appointee. All those involved in the oversight of
blood products, including clinical laboratories or blood banks, are also required
to report STIs and other reportable conditions to the state’s health department.
It is state and federal law that these illnesses be reported in a timely fashion to
the state health department.
In addition, it is mandatory that the information be disclosed to partners.
Partner reporting is a way to control the spread of disease and to ensure

98

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

prompt and proper diagnosis and treatment of all those who may be affected.
Partner notification can occur in either of two ways: by patient referral or by
the department of health staff. The patient can contact his/her partner(s) for
referral, diagnosis, and treatment. Alternatively, the partner(s) may be notified and counseled by department of health staff, if the patient is unwilling to
inform them. In the setting where a patient is unwilling to inform his/her
partner(s) of a reportable illness that places the partner(s) at risk, the healthcare provider has a legal and ethical obligation to inform the partner(s) (if known
by the provider) that they are at risk.

Teenage Pregnancy and Confidentiality
Issues regarding teenage pregnancy and consent to disclose information regarding pregnancy are quite controversial. Laws for reporting vary by state and the
specifics may become quite daunting. For the purposes of this case, focus is
limited to generalities. One must understand the laws pertaining to this issue
in the state in which he or she practices. In the state of Texas, as may be the
case in other states, a clinician is not required to inform the parents of issues
related to the pregnancy of a minor without the child’s consent, but it is not
mandatory for the adolescent to give consent for a physician to disclose information related to pregnancy to parents. However, studies demonstrate that
failure to maintain confidentiality in “sensitive” health-related issues may
inhibit appropriate health care delivery to the adolescent.
In Texas, the law does not allow state funds to be used for contraception
without the consent of the parent. Moreover, in most states, an adolescent
younger than age 18 years cannot give consent to abortion services without
the consent of one or both parents. This issue has been the subject of political debate for many years. Proponents of mandatory consent laws believe that
it is in the best interest of the minor for her parent(s) or guardian to be
informed of her pregnancy and decision to obtain abortion services, stating
that by doing so, communication among adult and child may be improved.
Opponents of these laws, however, see them as a threat to the well-being
of young women by forcing them to seek abortion services from unlicensed
facilities, crossing state lines to obtain abortions, and increasing medical risk.
The risk to young women may be increased by enforcing mandatory wait periods, which could mean having abortions later in the pregnancy than desired.
Currently, only six states do not require consent from parents to obtain
abortion services. In a state in which consent is required, there are some legal
alternatives for young women. For example, if an adolescent is considered
emancipated, then consent from parents or guardians is not required. Waivers
of consent (judicial bypass) may also be obtained through the judicial system.

Conclusion
Pregnancy-related care, abortion services, and reportable illnesses are complex and a clinician should seek legal advice when appropriate. However, in

CLINICAL CASES

99

general, it is preferable to protect the confidentiality of the minor unless it is
unreasonable or unsafe to do so. It is also important to educate teens and parents of the importance of open communication and issues related to confidentiality in medical care.

Comprehension Questions
8.1

A 14-year-old adolescent female is here to see you for complaints of
greenish vaginal discharge. She is sexually active with one partner and
does not use condoms. You do a culture and find that she has Trichomonas
vaginitis. She asks you not to tell her mother about this diagnosis or
that she is sexually active. Which of the following statements is most
accurate regarding disclosure or nondisclosure of this information to
her parents?
A. You can keep this information confidential. However, it is advisable to talk with the teen about her sexual history and discuss communication issues between her and her parents.
B. Since she is a minor, you must disclose this information to her parents.
C. You can only keep this confidential for today for enhancing therapy, but then disclosure to the parents must be demonstrated and
documented.
D. You may keep this confidential from the parents but you must call
the partner to notify him of the infection.

8.2

In which of the following situations may a physician keep information
confidential from parents or other authorities?
A. The physician finds injuries consistent with physical abuse while
examining a 13-year-old but the patient fears further injury if the
abuse is reported.
B. A depressed teenager reports a strong desire to kill herself and that
she has secretly obtained a gun that she keeps in her bedroom.
C. An undocumented immigrant patient has active tuberculosis and
fears deportation if the illness is reported.
D. A 19-year-old female college student, who is still on her parents’

35-year-old man and requests contraception but does not want her
parents to know.

8.3

Which of the following is most accurate regarding the term “emancipation” as it applies to a minor?
A. Able to vote
B. Able to purchase and consume alcohol
C. Able to make their own medical decisions without parental consent
D. Legally financially independent

100
8.4

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Which of the following statements regarding a minor’s ability to consent for an abortion is most accurate?
A. Because of medical confidentiality, a minor is able to consent to
any medical therapy she chooses without the consent of her parents or guardian.
B. Although consent requirements for abortion services vary depending on the state, most states either have some form of required consent for abortion services to minors or a mandatory wait period.
C. There are no states in which a minor can obtain an abortion without the consent of a parent or guardian.
D. A minor cannot consent to any medical therapy without her parents’ approval unless she has received a court order.

ANSWERS
8.1

A. The law does not require the disclosure of sensitive medical information to parents. However, in some states it is not forbidden to disclose that information. A clinician must use his or her best judgment
when deciding whether to disclose medical information. More importantly, the physician should recognize the importance of confidentiality when treating patients and encourage open communication
between adolescents and parents when it is reasonable to do so. Partner
notification can occur by patient referral or by health department staff.

8.2

D. All states have laws mandating the reporting of certain conditions, even if the patient objects. The specific conditions may vary
from state to state, so the physician must be aware of the rules where
he/she practices. Child abuse must be reported to appropriate authorities if suspected in all states. Similarly, certain infections, such as active
tuberculosis, must be reported to public health officials. Active suicidal
ideation, especially if there is a plan and access to agents necessary to
implement the plan, may lead the physician to intervene to prevent the
action. Of the scenarios listed, only D does not obligate the physician
to act.

8.3

C. Emancipation implies that the patient is able to make decisions
regarding health-related issues but does not give the patient the right
to vote, consume alcohol, or use tobacco products if the patient is
not of legal age.

8.4

B. The laws regarding the consent for abortion services vary from state
to state. Only six states currently allow a minor to have an abortion
without the consent of or notification to parents.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Adolescent health care is a complex issue. However, the clinician should
attempt to administer confidential health care to minors seeking care for
sensitive medical issues when it is safe and appropriate to do so.
➤ It is very important for clinicians to know the laws regarding consent and
confidentiality when treating adolescent patients of the states in which
they practice.

Case 9
A 65-year-old African-American woman presented to the emergency
room complaining of worsening shortness of breath and palpitations for
about 1 week. She reports feeling “dizzy” on and off for the past year; the
dizziness is associated with weakness that has been worsening for the
past month. She has been feeling “too tired” to even walk to her backyard and water her flower bed that she used to do “all the time.” She has
been so dyspneic walking up the stairs at her home that she moved
downstairs to the guest room about a week ago. Review of systems is significant for knee pain, for which she frequently takes aspirin or ibuprofen;
otherwise the review of systems is negative. She has no significant medical
history and has not been to a doctor in several years. She had a normal
well-woman examination and screening colonoscopy about 5 years ago.
She occasionally has an alcoholic drink and denies tobacco or drug use.
She is married and is a retired shopkeeper. On examination, her blood
pressure is 150/85 mm Hg; her pulse is 98 beats/min; her respiratory rate
is 20 breaths/min; her temperature is 98.7°F (37.1°C); and her oxygen
saturation is 99% on room air. Significant findings on examination
include conjunctival pallor, mild tenderness with deep palpation in the
epigastric and left upper quadrant (LUQ) region of the abdomen with
normal bowel sounds, and no organomegaly but a positive stool guaiac
test. The remainder of the examination, including respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems, was normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 9:
Geriatric Anemia
Summary: A 65-year-old woman with worsening dyspnea on exertion, fatigue,
dizziness, and palpitations. She is found to have conjunctival pallor and guaiacpositive stool.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Anemia secondary to gastrointestinal bleeding;
other considerations should include new-onset angina, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation.

➤

Next diagnostic step: A complete blood count (CBC) to evaluate for the
anemia. To evaluate for the other conditions on your differential diagnosis
list, you should perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiac enzymes.
A prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) to look
for coagulation abnormalities would be helpful as well.

➤

Next step in therapy: Admission as an inpatient for further workup,
including blood transfusion (if needed), completion of two more sets of cardiac enzymes, and ECGs. A gastroenterology consult for esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and colonoscopy is appropriate because of the positive
guaiac findings.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know a diagnostic approach to anemia in geriatrics.
2. Be familiar with a rational workup for anemia of different origins.

Considerations
A 65-year-old woman who has developed worsening dyspnea and palpitations
over 1-week period of time needs to be evaluated for cardiac and respiratory
problems despite the gradual onset of symptoms. Specifically, in a postmenopausal
woman, signs and symptoms of angina or acute myocardial infarction may not
always have a typical presentation. That the patient has been feeling weak
and has conjunctival pallor warrants testing for anemia. As evaluation with
serial cardiac enzymes and ECGs is part of the workup, admission into the
hospital is appropriate.
Assuming that the initial workup for cardiac and pulmonary causes is negative and that the hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are low, a thorough evaluation for the cause of the anemia is necessary. A CBC with peripheral smear,
reticulocyte count, iron study, vitamin B12 and folic acid levels would provide

CLINICAL CASES

105

clues to the type of anemia that this patient has. A gastroenterology consult
for possible EGD and colonoscopy to further investigate the source of gastrointestinal bleeding should be considered. The presence of epigastric and
LUQ pain, along with long-term use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs), should also raise a flag for testing to rule out a bleeding ulcer.
The presence of other findings may direct your workup toward other diagnoses. If this patient were from a developing country, the possibility of intestinal parasites would need to be considered. If the PT and PTT were abnormal,
GI bleeding from a coagulopathy or liver disease would be possibilities. Weight
loss, lymphadenopathy, and coagulopathy may warrant evaluation for nongastrointestinal malignancies, such as leukemias or lymphomas. In younger
patients, sickle cell disease, thalassemias, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency, and other inherited causes of anemia would be on the differential diagnosis list. These are unlikely to manifest as an initial diagnosis at
the age of 65 years.

APPROACH TO
Anemia in Geriatric Population
DEFINITIONS
ANEMIA: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a hemoglobin level of less than 12 g/dL in women and less than 13 g/dL in men.
NHANES: The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
The prevalence of anemia in Americans older than age 65 years is estimated
at 9% to 45%. There is a wide variation in the rates of anemia in different
ethnic and racial groups, with NHANES data showing the highest rates in
non-Hispanic blacks and lowest rates in non-Hispanic whites. These differences are reportedly a result of biologic, not socioeconomic, differences. Most
studies show the rate of anemia to be higher in men than women.

Clinical Presentation
Fatigue, weakness, and dyspnea are symptoms that are commonly reported by
elderly persons with anemia. These vague and nonspecific symptoms are often
ignored by both patients and physicians as symptoms of “old age.” Anemia
may result in worsening of symptoms of other underlying conditions. For

106

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

example, the reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood as a consequence
of anemia may exacerbate dyspnea associated with congestive heart failure.
Certain signs found on examination may prompt a workup for anemia.
Conjunctival pallor is recommended as a reliable sign of anemia in the elderly.
Other signs may suggest a specific cause of anemia. Glossitis, decreased vibratory
and positional senses, ataxia, paresthesia, confusion, dementia, and pearly gray
hair at an early age are signs suggestive of vitamin B12-deficiency anemia. Folate
deficiency can cause similar signs, except for the neurologic deficits. Profound
iron deficiency may produce koilonychias. Other clinical manifestations of anemia include jaundice and splenomegaly. Jaundice can be a clue that hemolysis is
a contributing factor to the anemia, while splenomegaly can indicate that a thalassemia or neoplasm may be present.
Initial workup of anemia should include a CBC with measurement of red
blood cell (RBC) indices, a peripheral blood smear, and a reticulocyte count.
Further laboratory studies would be indicated based on the results of the initial
tests and the presence of symptoms or signs suggestive of other diseases.
The most common cause of anemia with a low mean corpuscular volume
(MCV), microcytic anemia, is iron deficiency. Iron deficiency could be confirmed by subsequent testing that shows a low serum iron, low ferritin, and high
total iron-binding capacity (TIBC). Other causes of microcytic anemia include
thalassemias and anemia of chronic disease. In the elderly, iron deficiency is
frequently caused by chronic gastrointestinal blood loss, poor nutritional
intake, or a bleeding disorder. A thorough evaluation of the gastrointestinal
tract for a source of blood loss, usually requiring a gastroenterology consultation for upper and lower GI endoscopy, should be undertaken, as iron-deficiency anemia may be the initial presentation of a GI malignancy.
Anemia with an elevated MCV, macrocytic anemia, is most often a manifestation of folate or vitamin B12 deficiency. The presence of macrocytic anemia, with or without the symptoms previously mentioned, should lead to
further testing to determine B12 and folate levels. An elevated methylmalonic
acid (MMA) level can be used to confirm a vitamin B12 deficiency. Folate
deficiency anemia is usually seen in alcoholics, whereas B12-deficiency anemia
mostly occurs in people with pernicious anemia, a history of gastrectomy, diseases associated with malabsorption (eg, bacterial infection, Crohn disease,
celiac disease), and strict vegans (rare).
In the elderly, anemia of chronic inflammation (formerly known as anemia
of chronic disease) is the most common cause of a normocytic anemia. Anemia
of chronic inflammation is anemia that is secondary to some other underlying
condition. Along with causing a normocytic anemia, anemia of chronic disease
can also present as a microcytic anemia. This type of anemia can easily be confused with iron-deficiency anemia because of its similar initial laboratory picture. In anemia of chronic inflammation, the body’s iron stores are normal,
but the capability of using the stored iron in the reticuloendothelial system
becomes decreased. A lack of improvement in symptoms and hemoglobin

level with iron supplementation are important clues indicating that the cause
is chronic disease and not iron depletion, regardless of the laboratory picture.
Another cause of normocytic anemia is renal insufficiency due to decreased
erythropoietin production. Although bone marrow iron store remains the
gold standard to differentiate between iron-deficiency anemia and anemia of
chronic disease, simple serum testing is still used to diagnose and differentiate
these two types of anemia (Table 9–1).

Treatment
The treatment of anemia is determined based on the type and cause of the
anemia. Any cause of anemia that creates a hemodynamic instability can be
treated with a red blood cell transfusion. A hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL is a
commonly used threshold for transfusion, however transfusion may be indicated at higher levels if the patient has a comorbid condition such as coronary
artery disease. Iron-deficiency anemia is treated first by identification and correction of any source of blood loss. Most iron deficiency can be corrected by
oral iron replacement. Various iron preparations are available; a typical treatment is ferrous sulfate 325 mg three times a day. Parenteral iron preparations
are available for those with poor iron absorption and high iron replacement
needs. Vitamin B12 deficiency traditionally has been treated by intramuscular
B12 therapy with a regimen of 1000 μg IM daily for 7 days, then weekly for
4 weeks, then monthly for the rest of the patient’s life. Newer research shows
that many patients can be successfully treated with oral B12 therapy using
1000 to 2000 μg po in a similar regimen. Folate deficiency can be treated with
oral therapy of 1 mg daily until the deficiency is corrected. Anemia of chronic
inflammation is managed primarily by treatment of the underlying condition.

CLINICAL CASES

109

ANSWERS
9.1

A. The clinical presentation and CBC findings are consistent with
macrocytic anemia due to B12 deficiency. Pernicious anemia (lack of
intrinsic factor) is the most common cause. B12 deficiency can also
be seen in patients who follow a strict vegetarian diet, however the
body’s B12 stores can last several years before they are depleted.

9.2

B. Anemia of chronic disease can cause normocytic or microcytic
anemia, and may be secondary to rheumatoid arthritis in the patient.
Iron deficiency anemia is less likely with a normal colonoscopy and
negative stool guaiac, and serum iron studies could be used to help
differentiate the two.

9.3

A. Alcohol abuse is a common cause of folate deficiency. A normal
MMA level essentially rules out a concomitant vitamin B12 deficiency.

9.4

D. Low serum iron, low MCV, and low ferritin levels, along with a
finding of blood in the stool, are consistent with iron-deficiency anemia. A workup for the source of the GI blood loss should ensue.

9.5

A. Alcohol abuse, which may be assessed by the CAGE questionnaire, is a common cause of folate deficiency. CAGE is an acronym
which stands for Cut back, Annoyed, Guilty, and Eye-opener. A normal
MMA level essentially rules out a concomitant vitamin B12 deficiency.
Gastric endoscopy—to look for atrophic gastritis—would be indicated for pernicious anemia. A serum iron assay would likely be high
because of increased turnover of iron in patients with megaloblastic
anemia due to either B12 or Folate deficiency. A neurology consultation would be needed if the patient had neurologic signs or symptoms
of B12 deficiency.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Conjunctival pallor is an indication for anemia workup in elderly patients.
➤ Clinical findings of anemia require investigation for underlying causes.
➤ GI bleeding is an important cause of iron-deficiency anemia in both female
and male geriatric patients; this type of anemia mandates a GI workup in
this patient population.
➤ Investigating for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency is of high importance in
a patient with a history of heavy EtOH (ethyl alcohol) intake and/or abuse.

ANSWERS TO CASE 10:
Acute Diarrhea
Summary: A 40-year-old man who recently returned from Mexico with profuse, acute, nonbloody diarrhea and dry mucous membranes on examination,
which are consistent with developing dehydration. An ill family member with
identical symptoms suggests an infectious cause of this acute illness.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Acute gastroenteritis

➤

Next step: Order stool for fecal leukocytes

➤

Potential complication: Dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. To clearly understand when and how to do a workup for acute diarrhea,
considering the most probable etiologies of diarrhea such us virus, Escherichia
coli, Shigella, Salmonella, Giardia, and amebiasis.
2. To understand the role of fecal leukocytes and stool occult blood in the
evaluation of acute diarrhea.
3. To understand that volume replacement and correction of electrolyte abnormalities are a key component in the treatment and prevention of diarrhea
complications.

Considerations
This 40-year-old man developed severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. His
most immediate problem is volume depletion, as evidenced by his dry
mucous membranes. The priority is to replace the lost intravascular volume,
usually with intravenous normal saline. Electrolytes and renal function
should be evaluated and abnormalities corrected. While correcting and/or
preventing further dehydration, you need to determine the etiology of the
diarrhea. Up to 90% of acute diarrhea is infectious in etiology. He does not
have any history compatible with chronic diarrhea, causes of which include
Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, gluten intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, and parasites. He had been in Mexico recently, which predisposes him
to different pathogens: E coli, Campylobacter, Shigella, Salmonella, and Giardia.
He does not have bloody stools. The presence of blood in the stool would
suggest an invasive bacterial infection, such as hemorrhagic or enteroinvasive E coli species, Yersinia species, Shigella, and Entamoeba histolytica.
Examination of the stool for leukocytes is a simple, inexpensive test that
helps to differentiate between the types of infectious diarrhea. If leukocytes

113

CLINICAL CASES

are present in the stool, the suspicion is higher for Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia,
enterohemorrhagic and enteroinvasive E coli, Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter,
and Entamoeba histolytica. In general, ova and parasite evaluation is unhelpful,
unless the history strongly points toward a parasitic source or the diarrhea is
prolonged.
The majority of the diarrheas are viral, self-limited, and do not need further evaluation. In this particular patient, because of his recent travel to
Mexico, traveler’s diarrhea should be strongly considered and treated with the
appropriate antibiotic.

APPROACH TO
Acute Diarrhea
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for less than 2-week duration.
CHRONIC DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for longer than 4-week duration.
DIARRHEA: Passage of abnormally liquid or poorly formed stool in increased

frequency.
SUBACUTE DIARRHEA: Diarrhea present for 2- to 4-week duration.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Approximately 90% of acute diarrhea is caused by infectious etiologies, with
the remainder caused by medications, ischemia, and toxins. Infectious etiologies often depend on the patient population. Travelers to Mexico will frequently contract enterotoxigenic E coli as a causative agent. Traveler’s
diarrhea is a common entity and can be induced by a variety of bacteria,
viruses, and parasites (See Table 10–1). Campers are often affected by Giardia.

Consumption of foods is also frequently a culprit. Salmonella or Shigella
can be found in undercooked chicken, enterohemorrhagic E coli from undercooked hamburger, and Staphylococcus aureus or Salmonella from mayonnaise.
Raw seafood may harbor Vibrio, Salmonella, or hepatitis A. Sometimes the
timing of the diarrhea following food ingestion is helpful. For example, illness
within 6 hours of eating a salad containing mayonnaise suggests S aureus,
within 8 to 12 hours suggests Clostridium perfringens, and within 12 to 14 hours
suggests E coli.
Daycare settings are particularly common for Shigella, Giardia, and rotavirus
to be transmitted. Patients in nursing homes, or who were recently in the hospital, may develop Clostridium difficile colitis from antibiotic use.

Clinical Presentation
Most patients with acute diarrhea have self-limited processes and do not
require much workup. Exceptions to this rule include profuse diarrhea, dehydration, fever exceeding 100.4°F (38.0°C), bloody diarrhea, severe abdominal
pain, duration of the diarrhea for more than 48 hours, and children, elderly
patients, and immunocompromised patients. Traveler’s diarrhea is characterized by greater than 3 loose stools in a 24-hour period accompanied by abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fever, or tenesmus. Most cases occur within
the first 2 weeks of travel.
Past and recent medical history should include exposures to medications
and foods, travel history, and coworkers, classmates, or family members with
similar symptoms. A history of a viral illness may provide a clue to the etiology. The initial evaluation should determine if the patient can tolerate oral
intake. The patient who is both vomiting and having diarrhea is more prone
to dehydration and more likely to need hospital admission for IV hydration.
The physical examination should focus on the vital signs, clinical impression
of the volume status, and abdominal examination. Volume status is determined
by observing whether the mucous membranes are moist or dry, the skin has good
turgor, and the capillary refill is normal or delayed. The principal laboratory test
is the stool for microscopic and microbiologic examination; usually it is sent for
culture, but these results generally require several days to obtain and are not useful in the acute setting. Ova and parasite evaluation is generally unhelpful,
except in selected circumstances of very high suspicion. Stool for Clostridium
difficile toxin may yield the etiology in patients who develop symptoms after
antibiotic use. Although classically associated with clindamycin, any antibiotic
can cause pseudomembranous colitis. A complete blood count, electrolytes,
and renal function tests are sometimes indicated.

Treatment
Most cases of diarrhea resolve spontaneously in a few days without treatment. Replacement of fluids and electrolytes is the first step in treating the

CLINICAL CASES

115

consequences of acute diarrhea. For mildly dehydrated individuals who can
tolerate oral fluids, solutions such as the World Health Organization oral
rehydration solution or commercially available drinks such as Pedialyte or
Gatorade, often are all that is needed. Those with more serious volume deficits,
elderly patients, and infants generally require hospitalization and intravenous
hydration. If a parasitic infection is the cause of the diarrhea, prescription
antibiotics may ease the symptoms. Antibiotics sometimes, but not always,
help ease symptoms of bacterial diarrhea. However, antibiotics will not help
viral diarrhea, which is the most common kind of infectious diarrhea. Overthe-counter medications may help to slow down the frequency of the stools,
but they do not speed the recovery. Certain infections may be made worse by
over-the-counter medications because they prevent your body from getting rid
of the organism that is causing the diarrhea.

Prevention
Hand washing is a simple and effective way to prevent the spread of viral
diarrhea. Adults, children, and clinic and hospital personnel should be encouraged to wash their hands. Because viral diarrhea spreads easily, children with
diarrhea should not attend school or child care until their illness has resolved.
To prevent diarrhea caused by contaminated food, use dairy products that
have been pasteurized. Serve food immediately or refrigerate it after it has
been cooked. Do not leave food out at room temperature because it promotes
the growth of bacteria.
Travelers to locations, such as developing countries, where there is poor
sanitation and frequent contamination of food and water, need to be cautious
to reduce their risk of developing diarrhea. They should be advised to eat hot
and well-cooked foods, and to drink bottled water, soda, wine, or beer served
in its original container. Avoid drinks served over ice. Beverages from boiled
water, such as coffee and tea, are usually safe. Recommend the use of bottled
water even for teeth brushing. Also recommend avoiding raw fruits and vegetables unless they are peeled by the consumer immediately before being
eaten. Patient’s should avoid tap water and ice cubes.

Traveler’s Prophylaxis and Treatment
The best method for preventing traveler’s diarrhea (TD) is to avoid contaminated food and water. Antibiotic prophylaxis is not indicated unless the
patient is at increased risk for complications from diarrhea or dehydration,
such as underlying inflammatory bowel disease, renal disease, or an immunocompromised state. Fluoroquinolones are typically used for prophylaxis.
When antibiotics are indicated, therapy with a quinolone antibiotic should
be started as soon as possible after the diarrhea begins. Most commonly,
ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily) is given for 1 or 2 days. Quinolones

116

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

cannot be used in children or pregnant women. Quinolones will resolve the
diarrheal symptoms in the majority of patients within 1 day. Azithromycin,
given as a single 1000-mg dose in adults or 10 mg/kg daily for 3 days in children, is another effective drug for the treatment of TD. Azithromycin also can
be used in pregnant women with traveler’s diarrhea. Rifaximin can be used in
TD caused by noninvasive strains of E coli. However, Rifaximin is not effective
against infections associated with fever or blood in the stool.
Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ampicillin were popular drugs used in
the past to treat TD, but increased resistance limits their use at this time.
Bismuth subsalicylate is not recommended because, to be effective, it needs to
be taken in large amounts that can cause salicylate toxicity.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Most acute diarrheas are self-limited.
➤ Be cautious when assessing diarrhea in a child, elderly patient, or immunosuppressed host.
➤ Dehydration, bloody diarrhea, high fever, and diarrhea that do not respond
to therapy after 48 hours are warning signs of possible complicated diarrhea.
➤ In general, acute, uncomplicated diarrhea can be treated with oral electrolyte and fluid replacement.

Case 11
A 50-year-old Caucasian woman, new to your practice, presents for an
“annual physical examination.” She reports that she is very healthy,
generally feels well and has no specific complaints. She has a history of
having had a “partial hysterectomy,” by which she means that her uterus
and cervix were removed but her ovaries were left in place. The surgery
was performed because of fibroids. She has had a Pap smear every year
since the age of 18, all of which have been normal. She has had annual
mammograms since the age of 40, all of which have been normal. She
has no other significant medical or surgical history. She takes a multivitamin pill daily but no other medications. Her family history is significant for breast cancer that was diagnosed in her maternal grandmother
at the age of 72. The patient is married, monogamous, and does not smoke
cigarettes or drink alcohol. She tries to avoid dairy products because of
“lactose intolerance.” She walks 3 miles four times a week for exercise.
Her physical examination is normal.

woman: Annual.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Discuss age appropriate preventive health measures for adult women.
2. Review evidence in support of specific health maintenance measures.

Considerations
When evaluating patients for preventive health measures, there should not be
a “one size fits all” approach to care. Some interventions are appropriate
across age groups; some are age or risk-factor specific and should be tailored
accordingly. Interventions to consider include screening for cardiovascular
disease, breast cancer, cervical cancer, osteoporosis, and domestic violence.
Other health maintenance measures, such as screening for colon cancer and
routine adult immunizations are discussed in Case 1 and tobacco use is discussed in Case 7. The interventions discussed in this chapter are primarily
based upon recommendations of the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPSTF); recommendations of other expert panels or advocacy organizations are included where appropriate.

121

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Health Maintenance in Women
DEFINITIONS
BRCA: Abbreviation for genes associated with breast cancer and ovarian cancer.
Mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes can be associated with a threeto sevenfold increased risk for breast cancer, along with increased risks of
ovarian, colorectal, and possibly other types of cancer.
WOMEN’S HEALTH INITIATIVE: An NIH sponsored research program to
address the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in postmenopausal
women. This initiative included clinical trials of the effect of hormone therapy
on the development of heart disease, fractures, and breast cancer.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Cardiovascular Disease in Women
Cardiovascular diseases are the number one killer of women in the United
States. Many of the cardiovascular disease risk factors in women are the same
as those in men: hypertension, high LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol,
tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, family history of cardiovascular disease. As
such, the USPSTF screening recommendations for cardiovascular disease
for women are similar to those for men. All women aged 18 and older should
be screened for hypertension by the measurement of blood pressure (Level A
recommendation). Further, all women aged 45 and older should be screened
for lipid disorders (Level A recommendation). Abnormally elevated blood
pressure or serum lipids should be managed appropriately.
An area of cardiovascular disease risk unique to women is in postmenopausal
hormone replacement. Many women have taken hormone replacement therapy
for relief of vasomotor symptoms (“hot flashes”) and reduction of risk of developing osteoporosis. Recent studies, most notably the Women’s Health Initiative,
have shown increased rates of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in women
taking either estrogen alone or combined estrogen and progesterone. These
risks include an increased risk of coronary heart disease, stroke, and venous
thromboembolic disease. For this reason, the use of hormone replacement therapy for the prevention of chronic conditions is not advised (Level D recommendation) and any use of hormone replacement should be of the lowest effective
dose for the shortest effective time period.

122

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Screening for Breast Cancer
Breast cancer is second to lung cancer in number of cancer-related deaths in
women. There are approximately 190,000 new cases and over 40,000 deaths
per year from breast cancer in the United States. The incidence increases
with age; other risk factors include having the first child after the age of 30, a
family history of breast cancer (particularly if in the mother or sister), personal history of breast cancer or atypical hyperplasia found on a previous
breast biopsy, or a known carrier of the BRCA-1 or BRCA-2 gene.
The process of screening for breast cancer generally includes consideration
of three modalities: the breast self examination (BSE), the clinical breast
examination (CBE) performed by a health care professional, and mammography. Other modalities, including ultrasonography and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), are available but currently they are not widely recommended
for screening purposes. Upon review of the available studies, the USPSTF has
determined that, at this time, there is insufficient evidence to recommend
either the CBE or BSE (Level A recommendation). Both BSE and CBE may
be associated with increased risks of false-positive results and subsequent need
for biopsies while evidence is lacking that they reduce breast cancer mortality.
Studies regarding both are ongoing.
Mammography screening every 12 to 33 months has been shown to reduce
mortality from breast cancer. The benefits of routine mammographic screening increase with age, as the incidence of breast cancer is higher in older
women. There is not an age cut off to stop screening, but a discussion about
continuing screening can be considered in the older woman with significant
co-morbid conditions that may limit her life expectancy. Part of the discussion
regarding mammography also includes the risk of false-positive or false-negative
(less common) results and need for additional interventions, such as breast
biopsy. Most abnormalities found on mammography are not breast cancer but
require further evaluation to make that determination. The USPSTF advises
screening with mammography, beginning at the age of 40 for the general population, with a recommended interval of every 1 to 2 years (Level B recommendation). Recommendations are also available from other organizations,
including the American Cancer Society, American Academy of Family
Physicians, and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which
advocate annual mammography after the age of 50. Their recommendations
for women aged 40 to 49 vary, but generally advise screening every 1 to 2 years.

Screening for Cervical Cancer
Cervical cancer is the tenth leading cause of cancer death in women in the
United States, with 3670 deaths in 2007. The incidence of cervical cancer has
fallen dramatically since the introduction of the Pap smear as part of routine
screening. Risk factors for cervical cancer include early onset of sexual intercourse, multiple sexual partners, human papilloma virus (HPV) infection with
high-risk subtype of HPV (HPV viral types 16, 18, 45, 56), and tobacco use.

CLINICAL CASES

123

The optimal age to begin screening is unclear, but the USPSTF recommends starting at age 21 or within 3 years of the onset of sexual activity,
whichever comes first (Level A recommendation). While there is limited utility in screening for cervical cancer in a person who has never been sexually
active, many organizations will advocate an age-based approach because of
high rates of sexual activity by a certain age and because health-care providers
may not always get accurate sexual histories.
Most cases of cervical cancer occur in women who either have not been
screened in over 5 years or did not have follow-up after an abnormal Pap
smear. The optimal screening interval between Pap smears is not known.
Based upon the available studies, the USPSTF has not found evidence that
annual screening is better at reducing morbidity and mortality from cervical
cancer than screening every 3 years. The American Cancer Society recommends annual Pap smears until age 30 and then spacing out the interval to
every 2 to 3 years; other groups suggest spacing out the interval after three
consecutive normal Pap smears.
A vaccine against high-risk HPV subtypes has recently become available.
It is indicated for use in girls and women aged 9 through 26. To date, there is
no recommendation to alter the Pap smear screening intervals for women
who have been vaccinated against HPV.
The purpose of a Pap smear is to detect precancerous cervical changes or
possible cases of cervical cancer early, in order to improve the odds of survival.
Keeping this in mind, the USPSTF recommends against Pap smears for
women who have had a hysterectomy (including removal of the cervix) for
benign indications (Level D recommendation). It is prudent to ask a woman
who has had a hysterectomy why the surgery was performed and to confirm
(either by reviewing the operative report or on examination) the absence of
the cervix. A woman who had a hysterectomy for cancerous indications falls
out of the general screening parameters discussed here.
The optimal age to stop screening is subject to debate. The USPSTF discusses discontinuing cervical cancer screening after the age of 65 both if no
new risk factors have been identified (ie, new partner) and if there has been
adequate recent screening. The incidence of cervical cancer falls with age; the
false positive rate increases, thus potentially subjecting women to additional
unnecessary procedures. The American Cancer Society recommends that
screening may be stopped at the age of 70 if a woman has had three consecutive normal Pap smears and no abnormal Pap smears in the last 10 years.

Screening for Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a condition of decreased bone mineral density associated with
an increased risk of fracture. Half of all postmenopausal women will have an
osteoporosis related fracture in their lifetime. These include hip fractures,
which are associated with higher risks of loss of independence, institutionalization, and death. The risk of osteoporosis is increased with advancing age,

124

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

tobacco use, low body weight, Caucasian or Asian ancestry, family history of
osteoporosis, low calcium intake, and sedentary lifestyle.
Osteoporosis may also occur in men, although with a lower incidence than
it does in women. Along with the risk factors noted above, the prolonged use
of corticosteroids, presence of diseases that alter hormone levels (such as
chronic kidney or lung disease), and undiagnosed low testosterone levels increase
the risk of osteoporosis in men.
Screening for osteoporosis is done by measurement of bone density.
Measurement of the hip bone density by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry
(DXA) is the best predictor of hip fracture. Measurement of bone density is
compared to the bone density of young adults and the result is reported as
standard deviation from the mean bone density of the young adult (T-score).
Osteoporosis is present if the patient’s T-score is at or below −2.5 (ie, measurement of the patient’s bone density is more than 2.5 standard deviations
below the young adult mean); osteopenia is present if the T-score is between
−1.0 and −2.5. Other modalities, such as measurement of wrist or heel density, single-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and ultrasound are being evaluated
and may have some short-term predictive value. The USPSTF recommends
screening for osteoporosis via DXA in women after the age of 65 and considering screening in women aged more than 60 with higher risk of osteoporosisrelated fractures (Level B recommendation).
Calcium and vitamin D intake have a role in the prevention and treatment
of osteoporosis. The National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF) recommends
at least 1200 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D per day for
all women over the age of 50. If dietary intake is not sufficient, supplements
may be used. Weight-bearing and muscle strengthening exercise is also recommended both for its direct effects on increasing bone density and for its benefits in strength, agility, and balance, which may reduce the risk of falls.
When osteoporosis is diagnosed, patients should be treated with calcium,
vitamin D, exercise and strategies should be implemented to reduce the risk
of falls. These strategies include evaluation and treatment, if needed, of vision
and hearing deficits, management of medical disorders that can promote falls
(movement disorders, neurological disorders, etc), and periodic evaluation of
medications taken that may affect balance or movement. Hip protectors may
be beneficial in those at high risk for falls.
Medications used for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis are
included in Table 11–1.

Screening for Domestic Violence
Estimates indicate that between 1 and 4 million women are sexually, physically, or emotionally abused by an intimate partner each year. Women are also
much more likely to be abused by an intimate partner than men. Multiple factors are associated with intimate partner violence and include young age, low
income status, pregnancy, mental illness, alcohol or substance use by victims or

partner, separated or divorced status, and a history of childhood sexual/physical
abuse. Multiple rating scales are available to assess for presence of domestic
violence which are of variable quality. The USPSTF found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for intimate partner
abuse, or that screening affects outcomes (Level A recommendation). Other
groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians and American
Medical Association, recommend awareness and advocate asking about domestic violence. Documentation and treatment of injuries, counseling and information regarding protective services are part of the evaluation when domestic
violence is suspected. Reporting of domestic violence is mandatory in several
states; be aware of the requirements of your state.

A. Fewer than 25% of women will have an osteoporosis-related fracture in their lifetime.
B. Long-term therapy with a combination of estrogen and progesterone
is recommended for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
C. African-American women have an increased risk of osteoporosis.
D. 1200 mg of calcium and 400 to 800 IU vitamin D, through diet or

CLINICAL CASES

11.4

127

A 48-year-old woman presents for a well-woman examination. She
notes that she had a “partial” hysterectomy in the past. Your records
reveal that she had her uterus removed, but the cervix and ovaries
were left in place. You also note that she has had annual Pap smears
for the last 5 years and that all were normal. She read on the internet
that women who have had a hysterectomy no longer need Pap smears.
Which of the following would be your advice?
A. “You no longer need to get Pap smears.”
B. “You should continue to have annual Pap smears.”
C. “You should continue to have Pap smears but can space out the
interval to 3 years.”
D. “You should continue with annual Pap smears until the age of 50.
If they are all normal, you can stop having them at that time.”

ANSWERS
11.1

B. The optimal cervical cancer screening interval is not known,
however most authorities recommend at least three normal, annual
Pap smears prior to spacing out the screening interval. The use of
HPV vaccine is not an indication to alter cervical cancer screening
recommendations at this time.

11.2

A. Intimate partner violence can occur in any relationship, but the
risk is increased in certain situations, which include young age, low
income status, pregnancy, mental illness, alcohol or substance use by
victims or partner, separated or divorced status, and a history of
childhood sexual/physical abuse.

11.3

D. Women aged more than 50 should be advised to have a daily
intake of 1200 mg or more of calcium and 400 to 800 IU of vitamin D
and to participate in regular weight-bearing and muscle-building
exercise. Approximately half of all women will have an osteoporosisrelated fracture. Hormone replacement therapy should be of the lowest effective dose for the shortest effective time, due to the increased
risk of adverse cardiovascular and thromboembolic complications.
Asian and Caucasian women are at higher risk of osteoporosis than
African-American women.

11.4

C. Women who have had a hysterectomy, including removal of the
cervix, for benign indications can usually discontinue Pap smear screening. Women who still have a cervix should continue with screening for
cervical cancer. Women who have a hysterectomy for cervical dysplasia should continue to have annual Pap smears. This woman, who has
had at least five normal Pap smears in a row, can safely be counseled

Case 12
A 25-year-old man presents to your office on a Monday morning with
ankle pain. He was playing in his usual Saturday afternoon basketball
game when he injured his right ankle. He says that he jumped for a
rebound and landed on another player’s foot. His right ankle “rolled
over,” he fell to the floor, and his ankle immediately started to hurt. He
did not hear or feel a pop. He was able to stand and walk with a limp,
but was unable to continue playing. His ankle swelled over the next day
in spite of rest, icing, and elevation. He suffered no other injury from the
fall. On examination, he is a healthy-appearing man with normal vital
signs. The lateral aspect of the right ankle is swollen. The right ankle
has normal dorsiflexion and plantar flexion and there is no focal tenderness to palpation of the fibula, malleoli, or foot. No ligamentous laxity
is noted on testing. He can bear weight with minimal pain. There is normal sensation and capillary refill in the foot. The remainder of his examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 12:
Musculoskeletal Injuries
Summary: A 25-year-old man presents with an inversion injury of his right
ankle that occurred during a basketball game. His ankle is swollen, but he is
able to bear weight, and has no focal tenderness and no ligament laxity.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Sprain of the right ankle.

➤

Further diagnostic testing needed: None at this time.

➤

Most appropriate initial therapy: “PRICE” therapy: Protection, Rest, Ice,
Compression, and Elevation; a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug
(NSAID) or acetaminophen as needed for pain and early mobilization.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn an approach to the diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries.
2. Know when to order imaging tests and which test to order to evaluate musculoskeletal complaints.
3. Be able to manage common joint sprains and strains.

Considerations
Ankle sprains are the most common acute, sports-related injury, and are a common reason for visits to primary care physicians, urgent care centers, and emergency rooms. As in this case, most ankle sprains are the result of inversion
of an ankle that is plantar flexed—landing on another player’s foot in basketball, stepping in a hole or on uneven ground when running, missing a curb
while walking. The lateral ankle is injured much more commonly than the
medial ankle, as the bony anatomy of the tibiotalar joint and the very strong
deltoid ligament complex protect the medial ankle from injury. The lateral
ligaments—anterior talofibular ligament (ATFL), calcaneofibular ligament
(CFL), and posterior talofibular ligament (PTFL)—are relatively weaker and
more commonly injured. The ATFL is the most commonly injured ligament,
followed by the CFL.
Ankle sprains are graded as grade 1, 2, or 3 injuries. A grade 1 sprain is
stretching of the ATFL, which causes pain and swelling, but no mechanical
instability and little to no functional loss. The patient can usually bear weight
with, at most, mild pain. The history and examination of the patient in the
case presented is consistent with a grade 1 ankle sprain. A grade 2 sprain represents a partial tear of the ATFL and stretching of the CFL. This injury
causes more severe pain, swelling, and bruising. There is mild to moderate

131

CLINICAL CASES

joint instability, significant pain with weight bearing, and loss of range of
motion. A grade 3 sprain is a complete tear of the ATFL and CFL with partial tearing of the PTFL. This injury causes significant joint instability, loss of
function, and inability to bear weight.
The Ottawa Ankle Rules are a decision model designed to aid a physician
in determining which patients with ankle injuries need an x-ray. These decision rules have been validated for nonpregnant adults who have a normal
mental status, no other significant concurrent injury, and who are evaluated
within 10 days of the injury. When properly applied, the Ottawa Ankle Rules
have a sensitivity approaching 100% in ruling out significant malleolar and
midfoot fractures. These rules show that x-rays of the ankle should be performed if there is bony tenderness of the posterior edge or tip of the distal 6 cm
of either the medial or lateral malleolus, or if the patient is unable to bear
weight immediately or when examined. Foot x-rays should be performed if
there is bony tenderness over the navicular bone (medial midfoot), the base
of the fifth metatarsal (lateral midfoot) or if the patient is unable to bear
weight. The patient presented, who has no bony tenderness, no limitation in
weight bearing, and no contraindication to the application of the decision
rules, does not need imaging of his ankle or foot.
The management of ankle sprains should follow the pneumonic “PRICE”—
Protection, Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Protection by appropriate
splinting or casting can help to prevent further injury. Relative rest from activity also helps to promote ligament healing; although weight bearing can be
allowed as tolerated and early, functional rehabilitation exercises are crucial.
Ice applied as soon as possible after the injury helps to minimize swelling and
relieve pain. Compression and elevation also promote reduction of swelling. In
most cases, NSAIDs or acetaminophen are adequate for pain relief.

APPROACH TO
Sprains and Strains
DEFINITIONS
SPRAIN: A stretching or tearing injury of a ligament.
STRAIN: A stretching or tearing injury of a muscle or tendon.

CLINICAL APPROACH
History
As in all areas of medicine, the history of the presenting illness will guide the
diagnostic workup. In the history of a patient with musculoskeletal complaints,
important information to gather includes whether the primary symptom is

132

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

pain, limited movement, weakness, instability, or a combination of symptoms.
The onset of the symptoms—whether acute, chronic, or an acute worsening
of a chronic problem—can be significant. The location, severity, and pattern
of radiation of pain should be delineated. Associated symptoms, such as
numbness, should be identified. Efforts should be made to identify as specifically as possible the mechanism of any injury that led to the complaint.
Interventions that have already been made, such as ice or heat, medications,
splinting, and whether or not the interventions helped, should be noted.

Joint Examination
Examination of the musculoskeletal system should include documentation of
inspection, palpation, range of motion, strength, neurovascular status, and,
where appropriate, testing specific for the involved joint. Inspection should
note the presence of swelling, bruising, deformity, and the use of any supports
or assistive devices (eg, splints, crutches, bandages) that the patient is already
using. Examination of the unaffected limb can provide a good comparison
and allow for subtle changes to be more easily identified. Documentation
should also be made of the patient’s general functioning and mobility—does
the patient walk with a limp, can the patient easily rise from a chair, is there
difficulty getting on the examining table, is the patient’s arm moving freely or
held tightly to the patient’s chest, and so on.
Palpation of the affected and surrounding areas can help to localize and
confirm the presence of a specific injury. A focal area of bony tenderness may
lead to the consideration of a fracture, whereas a tender, tight muscle may be
more suggestive of a strain. The presence of joint effusions or soft-tissue
swelling should be documented and may lead to consideration of specific
injuries. Notation should be made of sensation, peripheral pulses, and capillary refill in the involved extremity. Absent pulses and delayed capillary refill,
especially if the extremity is cool or cold, should prompt emergent evaluation
and management of vascular insufficiency.
Range of motion should be tested both passively and actively. Active range
of motion tests the patient’s ability to move a joint. It tests the structural
integrity of the joint, muscles, tendons, and neurologic impulses to the area
and can be limited by problems with any of them or by the presence of pain.
Passive range of motion tests the movement that an examiner can elicit in a
relaxed patient. The presence of a dislocated joint or significant joint effusion
may lead to limitations in both passive and active range of motion, where a
torn tendon or muscle injury may have limited active, but preserved passive,
range of motion.
Each joint or body area has specific examination maneuvers that can help
to identify injury to specific structures. Table 12–1 lists some common maneuvers that are used to examine the shoulder, knee, and ankle.

Imaging
Following the history and examination, the physician must decide when it is
necessary to perform x-rays or other imaging tests. Validated decision rules are
available to aid in some of these decisions. The Ottawa Ankle Rules for the
determination of when an x-ray is necessary in an ankle injury were discussed
earlier in this case. Similarly, the Ottawa Knee Rules can aid in the determination of when to perform an x-ray in a knee injury. The Ottawa Knee Rules
recommend performing a knee x-ray on patients with a knee injury who have
any one of the following five criteria: (1) age 55 years or older, (2) isolated
patella tenderness, (3) tenderness of the head of the fibula, (4) inability to
flex the knee to 90°, and (5) inability to bear weight for four steps immediately and in the examination room (regardless of limping).
These rules were validated for, and should only be applied to, adults older
than age 18 years, although further study suggests that they may be valid in
younger ages.

CLINICAL CASES

135

When a decision is made to perform an imaging test, whether to acutely
rule out a fracture or to evaluate an injury that is failing to improve, the initial imaging study of choice is the plain x-ray. At minimum, an x-ray series
should include at least two views at 90° angles to each other. In patients with
normal x-rays and continued symptoms, or with suspected ligament or tendon
injuries of the shoulder, ankle, knee, or hip, magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) has largely supplanted other modalities as the imaging method of
choice. MRI is highly sensitive and specific for articular or soft-tissue abnormalities, including ligament, tendon, and cartilage tears.

Management Principles
The initial management of most acute sprains and strains is “PRICE”—
Protection from further injury, relative Rest, Ice to reduce swelling and pain,
Compression, and Elevation to reduce edema. In most cases, NSAIDs or
acetaminophen are adequate for pain control, with narcotics used only when
necessary.
Numerous studies show that early mobilization of injured ligaments actually
promotes healing and recovery. Range-of-motion exercises should be started as
early as possible in patients with sprains and strains. For lower-extremity injuries,
protected weight bearing with orthotics is allowable, with advancement to
unsupported weight bearing as tolerated. Crutches may be necessary initially
because of painful weight bearing.
The most common cause of persistently stiff, painful, or unstable joints
following sprains is inadequate rehabilitation. All patients with sprain or
strain injuries should be educated on the importance of rehabilitative exercises. When possible, handouts with a specific exercise program should be
given to the patient when the patient is evaluated. If the patient is unsuccessful in accomplishing this on his own, referral for a formal physical therapy
program can be beneficial.

12.2

A 32-year-old man comes for evaluation of right shoulder pain that he
has had for the past 3 weeks. He thinks that he injured it playing softball but does not remember a specific injury. There is no bruising or
swelling. He gets pain in the joint on external rotation and abduction,
but has preserved range of motion. Which of the following is the initial imaging test of choice?
A. X-ray
B. MRI
C. CT scan
D. Arthrogram

12.3

A 45-year-old woman comes in for follow-up of an ankle sprain that
occurred while she was jogging. X-rays done at your initial visit were
negative for fracture. She has been unable to run because of persistent
stiffness. Examination reveals no joint instability or focal tenderness.
Which of the following is the most appropriate management at this
time?
A. MRI of the ankle to evaluate for ligament tear
B. Referral to orthopedic surgeon
C. Repeat the plain x-rays
D. Increase her dose of ibuprofen
E. Refer her for physical therapy

ANSWERS
12.1

C. The Ottawa Ankle Rules apply in adult patients who have a normal mental status, who don’t have other painful injuries, and who
are seen within 10 days of their injury. The only setting in which all
of these criteria apply is C.

12.2

A. Plain film x-rays are the diagnostic imaging test of choice for the
initial evaluation of the painful joint. In patients who have normal
x-rays and who have a suspected soft-tissue (ligament, tendon, cartilage) injury, MRI scanning is usually the next most appropriate imaging study to perform.

12.3

E. The most common cause of a stiff or painful joint following a
sprain is inadequate rehabilitation. When a patient is unable to adequately self-rehabilitate an injury, a physical therapy referral can be
beneficial. If the patient continues to have symptoms after that, consideration of advanced imaging or orthopedic referral is appropriate.

CLINICAL CASES

137

Clinical Pearls
➤ A complete history and physical is essential in diagnosing and treating
musculoskeletal injuries.
➤ If you suspect that a patient’s limited active range of motion is primarily a
result of pain, you can numb the joint by injecting lidocaine into it and
then reexamine the joint.
➤ Use the uninjured, contralateral extremity as a comparison for your examination of an injured extremity.
➤ An adequate x-ray series must include at least two views at 90° to each other.

Case 13
A 45-year-old white woman presents to your office concerned about a
“mole” on her face. She says that it has been present for years but her
husband has been urging her to have it checked. She denies any pain,
itching, or bleeding from the site. She has no significant past medical
history, takes no medications, and has no allergies. She has no history of
skin cancer in her family. She is an accountant by occupation.
On examination, the patient is normotensive, afebrile, and appears
slightly younger than her stated age. A skin examination reveals a nontender, symmetric, 4-mm papule that is uniformly reddish-brown in
color. The lesion is well circumscribed, and the surrounding skin is normal in appearance. There are no other lesions in the area.

ANSWERS TO CASE 13:
Skin Lesions
Summary: A 45-year-old healthy woman with no significant past medical history presents for evaluation of a skin lesion. She does not have a family history of skin cancer. The lesion is symmetric, with well-defined borders,
relatively small (<6 mm), and uniform coloration. She is not able to assess
whether the lesion has changed recently (ie, become larger), and does not
give a history of itching or bleeding at the site of the lesion.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Benign nevus.

➤

Reassuring features: Size less than 6 mm, symmetric, uniform color, welldefined borders.

➤

Next step in treatment: Reassurance and surveillance.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe an approach to the evaluation of skin lesions.
2. Be able to describe the features of a skin lesion in dermatologic terms.
3. Know which features of a lesion are typically benign and which are concerning for malignancy or potential malignancy.

Considerations
This case represents a typical scenario seen in primary care medicine: “I have
this mole. Is it cancer?” Although simplified, this is what the patient is most
concerned about and wants to know. The role of the physician is to determine the likelihood of malignancy or premalignancy and to define a course
of action that is appropriate. In this particular case, there are several features
that reassure a benign condition that can be monitored without the need for
a biopsy. There was neither a family medical history of skin cancer nor history
of skin cancer in the patient. She has an occupation that does not expose her
to harmful chemicals or the sun on a regular basis. On examination, the lesion
has typically benign features (size <6 mm, symmetric, uniform color, welldefined borders). In this case, it would be appropriate to make a note (or possibly even a photograph) in the patient’s chart describing the characteristic
features of the lesion and monitor for changes in the lesion at periodic health
evaluations. The patient should also be educated in self-examination of the
skin, with an emphasis on what to look for and when to come to the physician’s office for an evaluation of a new or changing skin lesion. Finally, it

141

CLINICAL CASES

should be understood that many otherwise benign-appearing moles might
have an atypical characteristic that warrants further investigation. The criteria
that are used to predict the likelihood of a benign versus malignant lesion
are only guidelines; to be sure, not all malignant skin lesions present in the
same manner and a malignant melanoma is not always visibly pigmented.
The bottom line is that the physician should use all of the tools at his disposal: the history of present illness (HPI), medical history of the patient, the
family medical history (FMH), social and occupational history, and a pertinent review of systems so as to arrive at a conclusion that is consistent with
the physical examination.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Incidence and Risk Factors
There has been an increase in the morbidity and mortality of skin cancer in
the past few decades in the United States. In 2007, nearly 60,000 new cases
of melanoma were diagnosed. When you include basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma, more than 1 million new cases of skin cancer are diagnosed annually. Skin cancers cause approximately 10,000 deaths per year, of
which 80% are due to melanoma.

142

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The single most important risk factor for the development of skin cancer is exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Other risk factors include a prior history of skin cancer, a family history of skin cancer, fair skin, red or blonde hair,
a propensity to burn easily, chronic exposure to toxic compounds such as creosote, arsenic, or radium, and a suppressed immune system.

FOUR BASIC TYPES OF MELANOMA
Superficial Spreading Melanoma
This is the most common type of melanoma in both sexes. As its name
implies, this lesion spreads superficially along the top layers of skin before
penetrating into the deep layers. The superficial, or radial, growth phase is
slower than the vertical phase, which is when the lesion grows into the dermis and can invade other tissues or metastasize. Men are more commonly
affected on the upper torso, whereas women are affected mostly on the legs.

Lentigo Maligna
Similar to the superficial spreading type, this lesion is most often found in the
elderly, usually on chronic sun-damaged skin such as the face, ears, arms, and
upper trunk. Although it is the least common of the four types of melanoma,
this is the most common form of melanoma found in Hawaii.

Acral Lentiginous Melanoma
Similar to the other two superficial melanomas in that it begins in situ, this
lesion is different in many ways. This is the most common melanoma found
in African Americans and Asians. This melanoma is usually found under the
nails, on the soles of the feet, and on the palms of the hands.

Nodular Melanoma
This melanoma, unlike the other three, is usually invasive at the time of diagnosis. This is the most aggressive type of melanoma (Figure 13–1).

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION
In 1985, it was noted by clinicians studying melanoma that there were several
characteristic features of skin lesions that correlated with melanoma. Specifically,
color variegation, border irregularity, asymmetry, and size greater than 6 mm in
diameter were consistently observed with melanoma. This led to the ABCD
acronym which has been used extensively to determine the likelihood of a cancerous skin lesion (Table 13–1).

143

Braunwald E, Fauci A, et al. Harrison’s Principles of Internal Medicine. 16th ed. New York,
NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005:499.

One other criterion that is often used is the change in the size or appearance of the skin lesion. This is sometimes cited as E in the above ABCD criteria, and referred to as Evolving. Benign lesions may present at birth, or any
time thereafter, and several benign lesions may also present near the same
point in time. However, a benign lesion, once present, will usually remain stable in size and appearance, whereas a malignancy will present as increasing in
size or changing in appearance. Thus, it is useful to ask whether a “mole” has
recently changed in appearance or has grown in size.

TREATMENT
Benign nevi need only be monitored visually. The patient can accomplish this
after education on what to look for and when to come back for reevaluation.
In general, any preexisting nevus that has changed or any new pigmented

lesion that exhibits any of the ABCDE signs should be excised completely with
a 2- to 3-mm margin around the lesion. Larger lesions that may be cosmetically
difficult to completely excise may be biopsied in several areas. If the pathology
indicates a malignancy, the lesion should then be completely excised with 5-mm
margins by a physician trained in plastic surgical technique. Complete excision
of malignant melanomas requires at least a 5-mm margin. Once a patient has
been identified as having a malignant skin lesion, the patient should be observed
on an annual basis for any new or changing skin lesions. Shave biopsy may be
used for raised lesions, and punch biopsy or elliptical excision for flat lesions.
If the entire lesion cannot be removed due to size or location, biopsies should
be taken from the most suspicious parts of the lesion.

PROGNOSIS
The single most important piece of information for prognosis in melanoma is
the thickness of the tumor, known as the Breslow measurement. Melanomas
less than 1-mm thick have a low rate of metastasis and a high cure rate with
excision. Thicker melanomas have higher rates of metastases and poorer outcomes.

PREVENTION
Prevention is aimed at reducing exposure to ultraviolet radiation. When possible, avoid the sun between 10 AM and 4 PM; wear sun-protective clothing
when exposed to sunlight; wear a sunscreen with a sun protection factor
(SPF) of at least 15; and avoid artificial sources of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

NONMELANOMA SKIN CANCERS
Both basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas arise from the epidermal layer
of the skin. The primary risk for these types of skin cancers is exposure to
ultraviolet radiation, especially sun exposure but also tanning bed use. A history of actinic keratoses and human papillomavirus infection of the skin also
raises the risk of squamous cell carcinomas.
Basal cell carcinomas are the most common of all cancers. They typically
appear as pearly papules, often with a central ulceration or with multiple
telangiectasias. Patients typically present with a growing lesion and sometimes complain that it bleeds or itches. Basal cell carcinomas rarely metastasize but can grow large and can be locally destructive. The primary treatment
is excision.
Squamous cell carcinomas have a higher rate of metastasis than basal cell
carcinomas, but the risk is still low. These lesions are often irregularly shaped
plaques or nodules with raised borders. They are frequently scaly, ulcerated,
and bleed easily. Complete excision is the treatment of choice.

A 45-year-old African-American woman presents for a routine examination. You notice a 9-mm diameter lesion on the palm of her right
hand that is dark black, slightly raised and has a notched border.
When asked about it, she says that it has been present for about a year
and is growing. A friend told her not to be concerned because, “black
people don’t get skin cancer.” Which of the following is your advice?
A. Her friend is correct and this is nothing to worry about.
B. While anyone can get skin cancer, this lesion has primarily benign
features and can be safely observed.
C. This lesion is suspicious for cancer but this most likely a metastasis from another source, such as a breast cancer.
D. This lesion is suspicious for a primary melanoma and needs further
evaluation immediately.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

A 70-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a lesion on her left
cheek. It has been present for several months. It is slowly enlarging
and bleeds if she scratches it. On examination, you find a 7 mm diameter pearly appearing papule with visible telangiectasias on the surface.
Which of the following is the appropriate management of this lesion?
A. Close observation and reexamination in 3 months
B. Reassurance of the benign nature of the lesion
C. Excision
D. Local destruction by freezing with liquid nitrogen

ANSWERS
13.1

B. Superficial spreading melanomas are the most commonly occurring melanomas in both men and women.

13.2

D. Nodular melanomas are the most aggressive melanomas and are
usually invasive at the time of diagnosis. This patient’s lesion has
grown quickly and is invasive.

13.3

E. Acral lentiginous melanomas are found on the palms of hands,
soles of feet, and under finger- and toenails, and are the most common type found in African Americans and Asians.

13.4

D. The lesion described is suspicious for an acral lentiginous
melanoma and needs evaluation. While skin cancers are more common in persons with lighter skin, they can occur in persons with any
skin color or tone.

13.5

C. The lesion is most likely a basal cell carcinoma and should be
treated with excision. While the likelihood of metastatic spread is
low, these lesions can grow and be locally destructive.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The preventable risk factor common to all skin cancers is sun exposure.
Recommend to your at-risk patients limiting exposure to sunlight in the
middle of the day, wearing appropriate protective clothing, and using sun
screen.
➤ Contrary to popular belief, the use of tanning beds is also a risk factor for
skin cancer.
➤ There is no such thing as a “healthy tan.”
➤ Excisional biopsy should be done for any lesion suspicious for melanoma. If
the entire lesion cannot be removed due to size or location, full-thickness
biopsies should be taken from the most suspicious parts of the lesion.”

Case 14
A 40-year-old male with no past medical history presents to the clinic
to establish care. He reports that he had a prior urinalysis that revealed
blood as an incidental finding. The urinalysis was done as a standard
screening test by his former employer. He denies ever seeing any blood
in his urine and denies any voiding difficulties, dysuria, sexual dysfunction, or any history or risk factors for sexually transmitted diseases. His
review of systems is otherwise negative. He has smoked a half-pack of
cigarettes per day for the past 10 years and exercises by jogging 15 minutes
and light weight training daily. On examination, his vital signs are normal and the entire physical examination is unremarkable. A complete
blood count (CBC) and a chemistry panel (electrolytes, blood urea
nitrogen, and creatinine) are normal. The results of a urinalysis done in
your office are: specific gravity, 1.015; pH 5.5; leukocyte esterase, negative; nitrites, negative; white blood cell count (WBC), 0; red blood cell
count (RBC), 4 to 5 per high-power field (HPF).

ANSWERS TO CASE 14:
Hematuria
Summary: A 40-year-old male smoker is found incidentally to have red blood
cells in his urine sample on a urinalysis.
➤

Current diagnosis: Asymptomatic microscopic hematuria.

➤

Initial approach: Repeat the urinalysis, assess for risk factors, image the
upper and lower urinary tract.

➤

Workup and plan: Rule out infection by performing a urine culture; evaluate for malignancy by imaging of the upper urinary tract, cystoscopy, and
voided cytology.

➤

Concerns and counseling: The primary concern is to rule out malignancy,
including renal cell carcinoma and transitional cell carcinoma. Counsel the
patient on the importance of an appropriate workup, but reassure the patient
about the low prevalence of the condition.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn about the significance of microscopic hematuria.
2. Learn an evidence-based approach to workup asymptomatic microscopic
hematuria.
3. Be familiar with recommendations for follow-up on patients with hematuria after a negative workup.

Considerations
This patient has asymptomatic microscopic hematuria, as opposed to gross hematuria. Although he is asymptomatic, this patient deserves a thorough workup in
order to determine an etiology, if possible, and to rule out malignancy.
The patient’s history should be reviewed with specific questions to determine
any risks for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), occupational exposures to
chemicals, strenuous exercise, drugs, medications, and herbal/nutritional supplements. The workup should begin with a repeat urinalysis. If the condition
persists, the patient should have imaging studies of both the upper and lower
urinary tract. The upper tract can be imaged by either an intravenous pyelogram (IVP) or computed tomography (CT) scan. The lower tract is most commonly evaluated by cystoscopy, an endoscopic procedure. Urine should also be
sent for cytology and culture. Urologic consultation should be requested if the

151

CLINICAL CASES

workup reveals an abnormality that cannot be treated in a primary care office
or if the condition persists. Inform the patient that a complete workup is necessary to evaluate for the presence of conditions such as infections or tumors, but
he should be reassured that the incidence of cancer presenting as asymptomatic microscopic hematuria is low.

APPROACH TO
Hematuria
DEFINITIONS
GROSS HEMATURIA: The presence of enough blood in a urine sample to be

visible to the naked eye.
LOWER URINARY TRACT: The urinary bladder and urethra.
MICROSCOPIC HEMATURIA: The presence of 3 or more red blood cells per

HPF on two or more properly collected urinalyses.
UPPER URINARY TRACT: The kidneys and ureters.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hematuria is divided into glomerular, renal (nonglomerular), and urologic etiologies. Glomerular hematuria typically is associated with significant proteinuria, erythrocyte casts, and dysmorphic RBCs. Renal (nonglomerular) hematuria
is secondary to tubulointerstitial, renovascular, and metabolic disorders. Like
glomerular hematuria, it often is associated with significant proteinuria; however, there are no associated dysmorphic RBCs or erythrocyte casts. Urologic
causes of hematuria include tumors, calculi, infections, trauma, and benign
prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Urologic hematuria is distinguished from other
etiologies by the absence of proteinuria, dysmorphic RBCs, and erythrocyte
casts.
Hematuria in adults should first be defined as gross hematuria or microscopic hematuria. Gross hematuria denotes that the patient is able to visualize blood in his voided specimen. Patients most often describe their urine as
having a reddish or brownish color. They commonly are concerned about
malignancy or kidney stones. In contrast, microscopic hematuria is usually
asymptomatic and often discovered incidentally. Although a thorough workup
of microscopic hematuria is advocated, many authorities do not recommend
routine screening for hematuria.
Clinically significant microscopic hematuria is defined as 3 or more red
blood cells per high-power field on microscopic evaluation of urinary sediment from two of three properly collected urinalysis specimens. The initial

152

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

determination of microscopic hematuria should be based on microscopic
examination of urinary sediment from a freshly voided, early morning, cleancatch, midstream urine specimen. Urine must be refrigerated if it cannot be
examined promptly, as delays of more than 2 hours between collection and
examination often cause unreliable results.
Hematuria can be measured quantitatively by any of the following methods:
• Determination of the number of red blood cells per milliliter of urine

excreted (chamber count)
• Direct examination of the centrifuged urinary sediment (sediment count)
• Indirect examination of the urine by dipstick (the simplest way to detect

microscopic hematuria).
Given the limited specificity of the dipstick method (65%-99% for 2-5 red
blood cells per high-power microscopic field) however, the initial finding of
hematuria by the dipstick method should be confirmed by microscopic evaluation of urinary sediment. The limited specificity is due to the fact that the
urine dipstick lacks the ability to distinguish red blood cells from myoglobin
or hemoglobin.
Despite the recommendation that two positive urinalyses are needed prior
to workup, it is important to consider the individual patient’s risk factors. If a
patient has significant risk factors, even one properly collected urine specimen with 1 to 2 RBCs is sufficient to warrant a workup. Risk factors include
smoking, occupational exposure to chemicals or dyes (benzenes or aromatic
amines), history of gross hematuria, older than age 40 years, history of urologic disorder or disease, history of irritative voiding symptoms, history of urinary tract infection, analgesic abuse, or history of pelvic irradiation.
The prevalence of asymptomatic hematuria is roughly 0.20% in the adult
population in the United States. There are myriad possible causes; risk factors
should guide the specific workup for the individual patient. Although some elements of the workup are standard for everyone, other more detailed and expensive tests can be deferred for those at low risk. The presence of significant
proteinuria, red cell casts, or renal insufficiency, or a predominance of dysmorphic
red blood cells in the urine should prompt an evaluation for renal parenchymal
disease or referral to a nephrologist. In general, glomerular bleeding is associated
with more than 80% dysmorphic red blood cells, whereas lower urinary tract
bleeding is associated with more than 80% normal red blood cells.

Evaluation
Evaluation of the urinary sediment can allow for the diagnosis of patients
with renal parenchymal disease. This analysis will often also allow for distinction between glomerular disease and interstitial nephritis. The presence
of red cell casts and dysmorphic red blood cells is suggestive of renal glomerular disease. Interstitial nephritis, often caused by analgesics or other drugs, is
suggested by the presence of eosinophils in the urine.

CLINICAL CASES

153

A complete evaluation for microscopic hematuria starts with a detailed history and physical examination, appropriate laboratory testing (including urinary
cytology), and imaging of the upper and lower urinary tract. In all patients, the
urinalysis should be repeated. If the repeat urinalysis is negative and the patient
remains asymptomatic, no further workup is required for low-risk patients.
Transient microscopic hematuria can be caused by sexual intercourse, heavy
exercise, a recent digital prostate examination, or contamination by menses.
However, if the hematuria persists, a full workup is warranted regardless of a
benign history or physical examination. The repeat urinalysis should be done
after avoidance of any potential confounders such as menses, medications, exercise, drugs, and nutritional/herbal products. Exercise-induced hematuria usually
resolves spontaneously in 72 hours in the absence of other coexisting conditions. In addition, careful attention should be taken in women to ensure the
blood is not from the vaginal or rectal areas. In men, one should also exclude
local trauma to the foreskin. If in doubt, a catheterized specimen should be
obtained, taking care not to induce trauma during the procedure.
The laboratory studies should start with urinalysis with microscopy and
evaluation of centrifuged urinary sediment. The urine should be examined for
number of RBCs per high-power field, dysmorphic RBCs, and presence of
casts and eosinophils. Urinary tract infection (UTI) should be ruled out by
urine culture. If an infection is present, it should be appropriately treated and
the urinalysis repeated in 6 weeks. If the hematuria resolves with treatment
of the UTI, no further workup is needed.
A serum creatinine should also be obtained to assess renal function, with
comparison to old records if available. If the laboratory evaluation reveals elevated creatinine or red cell casts, workup should focus on renal parenchymal
disease and possible etiologies such as hypertension, diabetes, or autoimmune
diseases. Renal biopsy may be appropriate for certain individuals. Patients with
risk factors should also undergo cytologic evaluation of the urine to assess for
transitional cell carcinoma. Although voided urine cytology may not pick up lowgrade carcinoma, it is fairly reliable for high-grade lesions, especially if repeated.
Numerous options exist for imaging of the upper urinary tract. Despite
many studies comparing the radiographic methods, there are no evidence-based
guidelines on which modality is most efficient. An IVP is x-ray imaging of the
upper urinary tract after the administration of an intravenous contrast dye. It is
a widely available and relatively low-cost procedure, but it can miss small renal
masses and may not distinguish solid from cystic lesions. Ultrasonography is also
widely available and does not require the use of contrast dye but also may miss
small lesions. CT scanning has a high sensitivity and specificity for detecting
masses, renal stones, renal or perirenal infections, and obstruction. The CT scan
should be initially performed as a noncontrast study to detect calculi, and then
a contrast study should be obtained. Both CT scanning and IVP may lead to
nephropathy caused by IV contrast dye. Premedication with N-acetylcysteine
or IV sodium bicarbonate may be used to reduce the risk contrast nephropathy.
In patients with renal insufficiency or who are at high risk of contrast nephropathy,

154

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

a retrograde pyelography combined with a renal ultrasound may be an option.
Retrograde pyelography is an invasive procedure in which a catheter is placed
in the bladder and dye injected up the ureters to the kidneys. There is little risk
of contrast nephropathy because no contrast dye is given IV.
The lower urinary tract should be examined for transitional cell carcinoma
by cystoscopy performed by an urologist. In the absence of risk factors in
selected patients with a negative history, examination, laboratory workup,
and upper tract imaging, cystoscopy may be deferred or individualized at the
discretion of the treating physician.
In patients with a thorough but negative workup, the American Urological
Association recommends follow-up blood pressure measurements, urinalyses,
and voided urine cytologic studies at 6, 12, 24, and 36 months. The reason for
the regular follow-up is to assess for the possibility of an underlying lesion,
despite a low likelihood of there being one. If the workup remains negative
for 36 months and the patient continues to be asymptomatic, no further follow-up is recommended. However, if the patient develops gross hematuria,
voiding difficulties, pain, or any abnormal cytology, immediate urologic reevaluation and urologic consultation is warranted. Patients who develop hypertension, proteinuria, glomerular casts, or abnormal renal function should be referred
to a nephrologist for consultation.

B. Urinalysis and urine culture now. If they are normal, no other
workup is needed.
C. Urinalysis after 72-hours of no exercise. If no blood in urine then,
diagnose exercise-induced hematuria.
D. Urinalysis, urine culture, and imaging of upper urinary tract by CT
scanning.

14.2

A 78-year-old man with multiple medical problems presents with dysuria
and is found to have microscopic hematuria. His examination is only
positive for a very tender and boggy prostate. Which of the following
is the best next step?
A. Stat urology referral.
B. Treat the prostatitis with 1 month of antibiotics and reevaluate the
patient with a follow-up urinalysis and culture posttreatment.
C. Obtain an IVP followed by cystoscopy.
D. Obtain a CT of the abdomen and pelvis, followed by cystoscopy.

14.3

A 45-year-old woman with a history of cancer, currently receiving
radiation therapy, presents as a new patient. On a routine urinalysis, you
discover 2 RBCs per HPF, 15 to 20 WBCs per HPF, nitrites, and leukocyte esterase. Which of the following is the next most appropriate step?
A. Repeat a clean-catch midstream specimen, send for culture, and
treat the UTI. Repeat urinalysis after the UTI treatment.
B. Treat the UTI and also refer the patient for an IVP and cystoscopy.
C. Check urine for cytology.
D. Inform the patient that the urinalysis results are a result of the radiation
treatment and no further workup is needed.

ANSWERS
14.1

D. Gross hematuria always deserves a full workup. Although exerciseinduced hematuria resolves in 72 hours, gross hematuria, especially
in a person with risk factors, must have a thorough evaluation.

14.2

B. A tender/boggy prostate alludes to the diagnosis of prostatitis.
Reevaluation should be done after adequate treatment of the prostatitis. If the hematuria persists following treatment, further workup is
necessary.

14.3

A. True microscopic hematuria is the presence of 3 or more RBCs per
HPF in a midstream clean-catch specimen after exclusion of a UTI.
If there is evidence of a UTI, it should be cultured, treated, and urinalysis repeated after treatment.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Hematuria in adults always should be evaluated. If no source is found on a
thorough initial workup, patients should be followed for at least 3 years to
monitor for an underlying condition.
➤ Patients should be thoroughly instructed in the proper technique for a
“clean-catch” urine sample. This will reduce the number of false-positive
findings.

Case 15
A 27-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of progressing
nervousness, fatigue, palpitations, and the recent development of a resting hand tremor. She also states that she is having difficulty concentrating at work and has been more irritable with her coworkers. The patient
also notes that she has developed a persistent rash over her shins that
has not improved with the use of topical steroid creams. All of her symptoms have come on gradually over the past few months and continue to
get worse. Review of systems also reveals an unintentional weight loss of
about 10 lb, insomnia, and amenorrhea for the past 2 months (the
patient’s menstrual cycles are usually quite regular). The patient’s past
medical history is unremarkable and she takes no oral medications. She
is currently not sexually active and does not drink alcohol, smoke, or use
any illicit drugs. On examination, she is afebrile. Her pulse varies from
70 to 110 beats/min. She appears restless and anxious. Her skin is warm
and moist. Her eyes show evidence of exophthalmos and lid retraction
bilaterally, although funduscopic examination is normal. Neck examination reveals symmetric thyroid enlargement, without any discrete palpable masses. Cardiac examination reveals an irregular rhythm. Her lungs
are clear to auscultation. Extremity examination reveals an erythematous, thickened rash on both shins. Neurologic examination is normal
except for a fine resting tremor in her hands when she attempts to hold
out her outstretched arms. Initial lab tests include a negative pregnancy
test and an undetectable level of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

Thyroid Disorders
Summary: A 27-year-old female with progressively worsening anxiety, palpitations, tremor, menstrual irregularities, and weight loss. Her TSH level is
suppressed, confirming the presence of hyperthyroidism.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Hyperthyroidism secondary to Graves disease

➤

Most appropriate imaging study: Nuclear medicine thyroid scan with uptake

Definitive nonsurgical treatment: Thyroid ablation with radioactive iodine

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the most common conditions that cause hyper- and hypothyroidism.
2. Be able to interpret the common tests used to evaluate thyroid function.
3. Learn the modalities of treatment for disorders of the thyroid.

Considerations
This patient has symptoms and signs consistent with hyperthyroidism, including warm, moist skin caused by excessive sweating and cutaneous vasodilation; a resting tremor; an enlarged thyroid gland; weight loss; and tachycardia.
Her irregular heart beat may be a manifestation of atrial fibrillation, which
occurs in approximately 10% of hyperthyroid patients. Eye abnormalities are
common in hyperthyroid states. Retraction of the upper lid, resulting in the
“thyroid stare” is common. Graves disease has a unique ophthalmopathy that
may cause a prominent exophthalmos (Figure 15–1). The most common cause
of noniatrogenic hyperthyroidism is Graves disease, an autoimmune thyroid
disorder. Autoantibodies to the TSH receptors on the thyroid gland result in
hyperfunctioning of the gland, with the result that the thyroid gland functions outside the usual control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Graves disease commonly occurs in reproductive-age females and is much more
common in women than men. The treatment of Graves disease includes
antithyroid drugs (such as propylthiouracil and methimazole) and/or β-blockers
to block some of the peripheral effects of the excessive thyroxine. However,
these are only temporary measures used to give patients symptomatic relief.
The definitive treatment is radioactive iodine, which destroys the thyroid
gland. At least 40% of patients who receive radioactive iodine eventually
become hypothyroid and will need thyroid hormone replacement. Radioactive

iodine therapy is contraindicated in pregnant women, as the isotope can
cross the placenta and cause fetal thyroid ablation. Surgical removal of the
thyroid gland is another option for the treatment of Graves disease, but it is
often reserved for pregnant patients.

APPROACH TO
Thyroid Disease
DEFINITIONS
GRAVES DISEASE: An autoimmune thyroid disorder in which autoantibodies

to the TSH receptors on the thyroid gland result in hyperfunctioning of the
thyroid gland. A prominent finding is also the “stare” due to the ophthalmic
involvement.
THYROID STORM: An acute hypermetabolic state associated with the sudden release of large amounts of thyroid hormone into circulation, leading to
autonomic instability and central nervous system dysfunction such as altered
mental status, coma, or seizures. This condition has a significant mortality risk.

HYPERTHYROIDISM
Signs and Symptoms
Hyperthyroidism usually presents with progressing nervousness, palpitations,
weight loss, fine resting tremor, dyspnea on exertion, and difficulty with concentration. Physical findings include a rapid pulse rate and elevated blood

160

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

pressure, with the systolic pressure increased to a greater extent than the diastolic pressure, creating a widened pulse-pressure hypertension. Examination
findings can include atrial fibrillation and a fine resting tremor.
Thyroid storm is an acute hypermetabolic state associated with the sudden release of large amounts of thyroid hormone into circulation. It occurs
most often in patients with Graves disease, but can also occur in acute thyroiditis conditions. Symptoms include fever, confusion, restlessness, and psychoticlike behavior. Examination may demonstrate tachycardia, elevated
blood pressure, fever, and dysrhythmias. Patients can also have other signs of
high-output heart failure, such as dyspnea on exertion and peripheral vasoconstriction, and may exhibit signs of cerebral or cardiac ischemia. Thyroid
storm is a medical emergency that requires prompt attention and reversal of
the metabolic demands of the acute hyperthyroidism.

Pathogenesis
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism and is more commonly found in women. It is an autoimmune disorder caused by immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies that bind to TSH receptors, initiating the production
and release of thyroid hormone. In addition to the usual findings, approximately 50% of patients with Graves disease also have exophthalmos. The
second most common cause of hyperthyroidism is an autonomous thyroid nodule that secretes thyroxine. These nodules do not rely on TSH stimulation and
continue to excrete large amounts of thyroxine despite low, or nonexistent, circulating TSH levels. Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by the acute release
of thyroid hormone in the early stages of thyroiditis. In such cases, symptoms
are generally transient and resolve within weeks of onset. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism can occur secondary to the overuse of thyroxine supplementation.

Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation
Hyperthyroidism can be diagnosed by an elevated free thyroxine level, usually
with a corresponding low TSH level. Once it has been identified, further testing for autoimmune antibodies and radionucleotide scanning of the thyroid can
help to determine whether the problem is Graves disease, an autonomous nodule,
or thyroiditis. Radionucleotide imaging provides a direct scan of the gland and
an indication of its functioning. Imaging is performed using either an isotope of
technetium-99 m (99mTc) or iodine-123 (123I). After the administration of one
of these agents, imaging the thyroid allows visualization of active and inactive
areas, as well as an indication as to the level of activity in a particular area. In
patients with Graves disease, there will be diffuse hyperactivity with large
amounts of uptake. In contrast, thyroiditis demonstrates patchy uptake with
overall reduced activity, reflecting the release of existing hormone rather than
the overproduction of new thyroxine. The detection of serum thyroid-receptor
antibodies is a specific diagnostic test for Graves disease.

CLINICAL CASES

161

Treatment
Radioactive iodine is the treatment of choice for Graves disease in adult
patients who are not pregnant. It should not be used in children or breastfeeding mothers. Antithyroid drugs are also well tolerated and successful at
blocking the production and release of thyroid hormone in patients with
Graves disease. Some examples of these drugs include propylthiouracil (PTU),
methimazole, and carbimazole. These drugs work by inhibiting the organification of iodine, although PTU also prevents the peripheral conversion of
thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3), its more active form. The most serious
potential side effect of these drugs is agranulocytosis, which occurs in 3 per
10,000 treated patients per year. All of these drugs are relatively safe during
pregnancy, although PTU is the preferred agent. Antithyroid drugs are especially useful in treating adolescents, in whom Graves disease may go into
spontaneous remission after 6 to 18 months of therapy. Surgery is reserved
for patients in whom medications and radioactive iodine ablation are unacceptable treatment modalities, or in whom a large goiter is present that is
either compressing nearby structures or is disfiguring. For patients presenting
with thyroid storm, aggressive initial therapy is essential to prevent complications. Treatment should include the administration of high doses of PTU and
β-blockers (to control tachycardia and other peripheral symptoms of thyrotoxicosis). Hydrocortisone is given to prevent possible adrenal crisis.

HYPOTHYROIDISM
Signs and Symptoms
Patients with hypothyroidism can present with a wide range of symptoms,
including lethargy, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, slowed mentation or forgetfulness, constipation, intolerance to cold, and a depressed affect. In older
patients, hypothyroidism can be confused with Alzheimer disease and other
conditions that cause dementia. In women, it is often confused with depression. Physical findings that can present in hypothyroid patients include low
blood pressure, bradycardia, nonpitting edema, hair thinning or loss, dry skin,
and a diminished relaxation phase of reflexes.

Pathogenesis
Several different conditions can cause hypothyroidism. The most common
noniatrogenic condition causing hypothyroidism in the United States is
Hashimoto thyroiditis, an autoimmune thyroiditis. Iatrogenic causes include
post-Graves disease thyroid ablation and surgical removal of the thyroid gland.
Another cause is secondary hypothyroidism related to hypothalamic or pituitary dysfunction. These conditions are primarily found in patients who have
received intracranial irradiation or surgical removal of a pituitary adenoma.

162

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Laboratory and Imaging Evaluation
In primary hypothyroidism, the TSH level is elevated, indicating insufficient
thyroid hormone production to meet metabolic demands. Free thyroid levels
are low. In contrast, patients with secondary hypothyroidism have low or undetectable TSH levels. Once the diagnosis of primary hypothyroidism is made,
further imaging or serologic testing is unnecessary if the thyroid gland is
normal on physical examination. In cases of secondary hypothyroidism, however, further testing is needed to determine whether the cause is a hypothalamic or pituitary problem. This can be done by using a thyroid-releasing hormone
(TRH) test. Endogenous TRH is released by the hypothalamus and stimulates
the pituitary to release TSH. When TRH is injected intravenously, a normally
functioning pituitary will result in an increase of TSH that can be measured in
about 30 minutes. No increase in TSH after injection of TRH suggests a malfunctioning pituitary gland. In cases where pituitary dysfunction is suspected,
imaging of the pituitary gland to detect microadenomas and testing of other
hormones that are dependent on pituitary stimulation are indicated.

Treatment
Most healthy adults with hypothyroidism require about 1.7 μg/kg of thyroid
hormone replacement daily, with requirements falling to about 1 μg/kg for the
elderly. This usually amounts to between 0.10 and 0.15 mg/d of levothyroxine.
Children with hypothyroidism may require higher doses for full replacement.
In young patients without cardiovascular risk factors, replacement can start
close to the estimated daily requirement. Older patients or those with risks for
cardiovascular compromise that could occur with a rapid increase in resting
heart rate and blood pressure should be started on lower doses and gradually
increased over time. Doses can be increased in increments of 0.025 to 0.050 mg
every 4 to 6 weeks until TSH levels return to normal. Thyroxine is usually
dosed once daily, although some evidence suggests that weekly dosing may also
be effective. In patients with an intact hypothalamic-pituitary axis, the adequacy of thyroid replacement can be followed with serial TSH measurements.
Evaluation of TSH levels should be performed no earlier than 4 weeks after an
adjustment in medication has been made. Full effects of thyroid replacement on
TSH level may not be present until after 8 weeks of treatment. With increased
age, thyroid binding decreases as a consequence of a drop in serum albumin level
and medication dosage may need to be reduced by up to 20%. Annual monitoring of the TSH level in the elderly is necessary to avoid overreplacement.

NODULAR THYROID DISEASE
Thyroid nodules, both solitary and multiple, are common and are often found
incidentally on physical examination, ultrasonography, or computed tomography. They are more prevalent in women and increase in frequency with age.

CLINICAL CASES

163

Although their pathogenesis is not clear, nodules are known to be associated
with iodine deficiency, higher gravidity, and the ingestion of goitrogens. Further
workup of identified nodules is indicated, as the incidence of malignancy in
solitary nodules is estimated at 5% to 6%. The incidence of malignancy is
higher in children, adults younger than 30 or older than 60 years, and patients
with a history of head or neck irradiation. Other historical risk factors include
a family history of thyroid cancer, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy,
and the recent development of hoarseness of the voice, progressive dysphagia,
or shortness of breath.
Initial assessment should include evaluation of thyroid function. Functional
adenomas that present with hyperthyroidism are rarely malignant. These represent less than 10% of all nodules. These patients are best evaluated with a radioactive iodine uptake study to confirm functionality of the nodule. Hyperfunctioning
nodules are treated with surgery or radioactive ablation therapy, depending on the
level of hyperthyroidism.
Nonfunctioning nodules measuring greater than 1 cm by examination or
ultrasonography require biopsy. This can be done by fine-needle aspiration
(FNA), which is a highly sensitive test. Ultrasound findings suggestive of
malignancy include irregular margins, intranodular vascular spots, and microcalcifications. Results of the FNA determine further management and treatment.
Cytologic evaluation of FNA specimens are reported as being nondiagnostic,
benign, indeterminate, or malignant. Follicular cell malignancy cannot be distinguished cytologically from its benign equivalent, and thus is often read as
indeterminate. These patients should be referred to surgery to obtain a definitive evaluation. Papillary, medullary, and anaplastic thyroid carcinomas can
be diagnosed accurately by FNA. Patients with thyroid malignancy are treated
by thyroidectomy followed by radioactive ablation. These patients will require
long-term follow-up by an endocrinologist.
Thyroid nodules discovered during pregnancy are handled similarly, except
that radioisotope scanning is contraindicated. Fine-needle aspiration is safe
during pregnancy, and thyroidectomy can be performed relatively safely during the second trimester. However, because thyroid cancer is relatively indolent, it may be wise to defer definitive diagnosis and treatment until the
postpartum period in patients with indeterminate lesions on FNA.

1.3 cm. Which of the following is the next step in the workup of this
nodule?
A. Radioactive iodine uptake study
B. Fine needle aspiration
C. Repeat ultrasound in 6 months
D. Referral to surgeon for open biopsy

CLINICAL CASES

165

ANSWERS
15.1

D. Most cases of hyperthyroidism will result in a suppressed level of
TSH and elevated T4/T3 levels. An exception to this would be a secondary hyperthyroid state, such as with a pituitary tumor that secretes
TSH, resulting in both a high TSH level and high serum hormone
levels (caused by overstimulation of the thyroid gland).

15.2

C. This patient most likely has hypothyroidism due to the prior
radioactive iodide therapy for ablation of the thyroid gland. Most
cases of hypothyroidism are treated with thyroxine given orally. T4
given in pill form will convert to the more metabolically active T3.

15.3

C. Thyroid cancer detected during pregnancy can usually be observed
until after the pregnancy is complete. If needed, thyroid surgery can be
performed safely in the second and third trimesters. The use of radioactive iodine is contraindicated in pregnancy.

15.4

B. Fine needle aspiration is a sensitive and specific test for thyroid
nodules and can help to determine whether it is malignant.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The most common forms of both hyper- and hypothyroidism are autoimmune: Graves disease causing hyperthyroidism and Hashimoto thyroiditis
causing hypothyroidism.
➤ Hyperfunctioning (“hot”) thyroid nodules are rarely malignant. Hypofunctioning
(“cold”) nodules more than 1 cm in diameter should be biopsied.
➤ Thyroid disease is more common in women than men.

A 25-year-old G2 P1 woman at 39 weeks estimated gestational age
presents to the labor and delivery triage unit stating that her “water has
broken.” She reports having had a large gush of clear fluid followed by
a constant leakage of fluid from her vagina. She subsequently started
having uterine contractions approximately every 4 minutes. She has had
an uncomplicated prenatal course with good prenatal care since 8-week
gestation. Her prenatal records are available for review in the triage
unit. Her first pregnancy resulted in the full-term delivery of a 7 lb 8 oz,
healthy boy.
In the triage unit, she is placed on an external fetal monitor. Her blood
pressure is 110/70 mm Hg, her pulse is 90 beats/min, and her temperature
is 98.7°F (37.0°C). Her general examination is normal. Her abdomen is
gravid, with a fundal height of 38 cm. The fetus has a cephalic presentation by Leopold maneuvers and an estimated fetal weight of 8 lb.

CLINICAL CASES

ANSWERS TO CASE 16:
Labor and Delivery
Summary: A 25-year-old pregnant woman at term presents with the spontaneous rupture of membranes and subsequent uterine contractions, signaling
the onset of labor.
➤

Signs that could confirm the rupture of membranes: Visualization of
amniotic fluid leaking from the cervix; the presence of pooling of amniotic
fluid in the posterior vaginal fornix; demonstration of a pH above 6.5 in
fluid collected from the vagina using Nitrazine paper; or visualization of
“ferning” on a sample of fluid on an air-dried microscope slide

➤

Baseline fetal heart rate: 140 beats/min; Contraction interval: approximately every 3 minutes

➤

Recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for GBS colonization during
labor: Penicillin 5 million units IV loading dose followed by 2.5 million
units IV every 4 hours; alternative treatments include IV ampicillin,
cephalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and vancomycin

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the definition of labor, including the three stages of labor, and know
the normal progression of labor in nulliparous and multiparous women.
2. Understand the types of fetal monitoring that are routinely performed during labor and how monitoring correlates with the physiologic processes
occurring during labor.
3. Be familiar with the abnormal progression of labor and some of the interventions that can be made to address these problems.

Considerations
This woman arrives at the labor and delivery triage unit in need of evaluation
for the possibility that she is in labor and that she has ruptured her membranes
(broken her bag of water). The accurate and appropriate diagnosis of labor is
extremely important in obstetrical care. Incorrectly diagnosing a woman as
being in labor may result in unnecessary interventions, whereas not diagnosing labor may result in complications or delivery occurring without access to
appropriate personnel and facilities. Furthermore, the diagnosis of rupture of
membranes is critical for several reasons. First, especially at term, the spontaneous rupture of membranes may signify the impending onset of labor. Second,

170

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

if the presenting part is not well applied in the pelvis, prolapse of the umbilical
cord with resultant compression of the cord and disruption of the oxygen supply to the fetus may occur. Finally, the prolonged rupture of membranes, especially after 24 hours or longer, may predispose to the development of infection.
The physician also must promptly make assessments of both maternal and
fetal well-being. A careful history and physical examination should be performed. When available, prenatal records should be reviewed to evaluate for
any problems during this, or previous, pregnancies and to confirm the gestational age of the pregnancy. In this case, the presence of GBS colonization
requires the institution of appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis to reduce the risk
of fetal infection with GBS, a common cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. In GBS-colonized women, the recommended antibiotic prophylaxis is
IV penicillin. When this is not available, ampicillin is often substituted. In
penicillin-allergic women, cephalothin, erythromycin, clindamycin, or vancomycin can be used. Fetal well-being is monitored most commonly using
external, electronic fetal-monitoring equipment, although other options are
available. With this equipment, the baseline fetal heart rate, heart rate variability, accelerations and decelerations, along with the presence and frequency of uterine contractions, may be evaluated. Determination of the
presentation of the fetus (cephalic, breech, or shoulder [ie, transverse lie]) is
also critical, as this may play a significant role in the determination of route
of delivery (vaginal or cesarean).

APPROACH TO
Labor and Delivery
DEFINITIONS
FETAL LIE: The relationship of the long axis of the fetus to the long axis of
the mother; either longitudinal or transverse.
FETAL PRESENTATION: The part of the fetus that is either foremost in the
birth canal or in closest proximity to the birth canal.
LABOR: Regular uterine contractions that lead to the effacement and dilation of the cervix.
PREMATURE RUPTURE OF MEMBRANES: Rupture of the fetal membranes
prior to the onset of labor.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Labor usually begins spontaneously and occurs normally within 2 weeks of the
estimated date of confinement (280 days after the first day of the last menstrual
period). The onset of labor more than 3 weeks before the estimated date of

CLINICAL CASES

171

confinement (EDC) is considered preterm labor. If labor has not started spontaneously by 2 weeks after the EDC, the pregnancy is considered postterm.

Stages of labor
Labor is typically divided into three stages. The first stage of labor is from
the onset of labor until the cervix is completely dilated. This stage can further be divided into a latent phase and an active phase. During the latent
phase of labor, the contractions become stronger, longer lasting, and more
coordinated. The active phase of labor, which usually starts at 3 to 4 cm of
cervical dilation, is when the rate of cervical dilation is at its maximum.
Contractions are usually strong and regular. In active labor in a woman without an epidural, the minimum expected rates of cervical dilation are 1.2 cm
per hour for a nulliparous woman and 1.5 cm per hour for a parous woman.
The second stage of labor is from complete cervical dilation (10 cm) through
the delivery of the fetus. The combination of the force of the uterine contractions and the pushing efforts of the mother results in the delivery of the
baby. A normal second stage lasts less than 2 hours in a nulliparous patient
and less than 1 hour in a parous patient. The presence of epidural anesthesia
can prolong these times by up to 1 hour. The third stage of labor begins after
the delivery of the baby and ends with the delivery of the placenta and
membranes. The third stage is typically short and is considered prolonged if
it lasts longer than 30 minutes.

The progress of labor
The progress of labor usually depends upon the “three Ps.” The Power is the
strength of the uterine contractions during the active phase of labor and of the
maternal pushing efforts during the second stage of labor. The power of the contractions can be assessed subjectively by an examiner palpating the uterus during a contraction or objectively by placing an intrauterine pressure catheter,
which directly measures pressure within the uterine cavity. The Passenger is the
fetus. Its size, lie, presentation, and position within the birth canal all play a
role in the progression of labor and rate of fetal descent. Finally, the shape and
size of the Pelvis can result in delay or failure of descent of the fetus because of
the relative disproportion between the fetal and pelvic sizes.
The diagnosis of active labor is an indication for admission to the birthing
unit for labor management and monitoring. The presence of ruptured membranes is also an indication for admission. The rupture of membranes can be
confirmed by a careful vaginal examination performed with a sterile speculum
and gloves. The visualization of fluid leaking from the cervical os, either spontaneously or with the patient performing a Valsalva maneuver, and the presence of amniotic fluid pooling in the posterior vaginal fornix are confirmatory.
The detection of fluid in the vagina with a pH more than 6.5 is consistent with
amniotic fluid, as normal vaginal secretions typically have a pH less than 5.5.
Using a sterile applicator to sample vaginal fluid and applying it to Nitrazine

172

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

paper can make this determination. The presence of semen, blood, or bacterial
vaginosis can cause elevated pH in vaginal secretions and a false-positive
Nitrazine test. The visualization of ferning of vaginal fluid under microscopic
magnification of an air-dried sample also suggests the presence of amniotic fluid.
When the pregnant patient is admitted to the labor and delivery unit, fetal
well-being is assessed by either continuous or intermittent fetal heart rate
monitoring. Continuous external fetal heart rate monitoring is the more commonly used procedure in the United States. A Doppler ultrasound device is used
to continuously trace the fetal heart rate. Continuous monitoring can also be
accomplished using an internal device, by attaching an electrode to the fetal
scalp that directly measures and amplifies fetal cardiac electrical activity. This
procedure requires that the membranes are ruptured. With either of these two
techniques, a continuous graphic recording of the fetal heart rate is recorded.
Alternatively, intermittent auscultation using a stethoscope or handheld
Doppler can be performed. The American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that, in intermittent auscultation of lowrisk pregnancies, the fetal heart should be monitored after a contraction at least
every 30 minutes during the first stage of labor and every 15 minutes in the second stage. In at-risk pregnancies, the monitoring frequency is increased to at
least every 15 minutes during the first stage and to every 5 minutes in the second
stage.
Important considerations in interpreting fetal heart rate data are the baseline heart rate, variability, and periodic heart rate changes. The baseline
heart rate is the approximate average heart rate during a 10-minute tracing.
A baseline heart rate of 110 to 160 beats/min is considered normal, less than
110 beats/min is considered to be bradycardia, and greater than 160 beats/min
is considered to be tachycardia. Fetal bradycardia may occur with maternal
hypothermia, certain medications given to the mother, or congenital heart
block, or may be a sign of significant fetal distress. Bradycardia may also be a
normal variant. The most common cause of fetal tachycardia is maternal fever.
Other common causes include medications and fetal arrhythmias.
Variability is regulated by the balance of sympathetic and parasympathetic
control of the sinoatrial node. Short-term (or beat-to-beat) variability is the
change in fetal heart rate from one beat to the next and can only be accurately determined when an internal scalp electrode is placed. Normal shortterm variability is 6 to 25 beats/min. Long-term variability is the waviness of
the baseline heart rate over 1 minute, with normal oscillations occurring at a
rate of 3 to 5 cycles per minute. As variability is largely a manifestation of the
autonomic nervous system, anything that affects nervous system functioning
can affect it. Common causes of decreased variability are fetal sleep cycles,
CNS (central nervous system) depressant drugs (such as narcotic analgesics)
given to the mother, congenital neurologic abnormalities, and prematurity.
Fetal acidemia secondary to hypoxemia can impair CNS function and reduce
variability. The presence of normal variability makes fetal acidemia unlikely.

CLINICAL CASES

173

Periodic heart rate changes are the accelerations and decelerations from
the baseline heart rate that occur, often related to uterine contractions. An
acceleration is an increase in the fetal heart rate of 15 beats/min or more for
15 seconds or longer and is a reassuring finding. The presence of accelerations, whether occurring spontaneously or in response to contractions, fetal
movement, or stimulation of the fetus (either scalp stimulation during a cervical examination or vibroacoustic stimulation using an artificial larynx) virtually ensures that the fetal arterial pH is greater than 7.2. Decelerations are
generally defined as early, late, or variable based on the timing of the deceleration in relation to a contraction. An early deceleration coincides with a
contraction in onset of the fetal heart rate decline and return to the baseline.
Early decelerations are thought to be a result of increased vagal tone caused
by compression of the fetal head and are not associated with fetal hypoxia or
acidemia. A late deceleration is a gradual reduction in the fetal heart rate that
starts at or after the peak of a contraction and has a gradual return to the baseline. Late decelerations are a manifestation of uteroplacental insufficiency
and can be caused by numerous circumstances. Common among these are
maternal hypotension, as is often seen with epidural anesthesia and uterine
hyperstimulation caused by oxytocin administration. Conditions that impair
placental circulation, including maternal hypertension, diabetes, prolonged
pregnancy, and placental abruption, often contribute to late decelerations.
A variable deceleration is an abrupt decrease in fetal heart rate, usually followed
by an abrupt return to baseline that occurs variably in its timing, relative to a
contraction. Variable decelerations are the most common types of decelerations seen during fetal heart monitoring and are considered to be due to
umbilical cord compression during contractions. Variable decelerations, particularly when there is also the presence of normal variability and accelerations, are usually not associated with fetal hypoxemia.
Current fetal monitoring equipment also allows for contraction monitoring along with the fetal heart rate assessment. An external tocodynamometer
is most commonly used. It allows for evaluation of the presence and timing of
contractions but does not measure the strength of the contractions. To assess
the strength of contractions, an internal intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC)
can be placed. Like the fetal scalp electrode, this requires the presence of ruptured membranes. An IUPC can be useful when the first stage of labor is not
progressing at an expected rate, as the frequency and power of contractions
can be directly measured. Contractions that are inadequate in frequency or
power may be augmented with an oxytocic agent. Intravenous oxytocin is the
drug of choice, as it is effective, inexpensive, and most practitioners are familiar with its usage. Oxytocin has a short half-life, which allows it to be given by
continuous infusion and allows for the rapid cessation of its activity when it is
discontinued. Labor augmentation with oxytocin can cause uterine hyperstimulation, defined as the presence of 6 or more contractions in a 10-minute
period that causes nonreassuring fetal heart rate abnormalities (such as late

174

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

decelerations). This would be managed by reduction in dose or discontinuation
of the oxytocin, repositioning of the patient, and providing oxygen via face
mask to the mother.
During labor, the fetal head descends through the birth canal and undergoes
four cardinal movements. During initial descent, the head undergoes flexion,
bringing the fetal chin to the chest. As descent progresses internal rotation
occurs, causing the fetal occiput to move anteriorly toward the maternal symphysis pubis. As the head approaches the vulva it undergoes extension, to
allow the head to pass below the symphysis pubis and through the upwarddirected vaginal outlet. Further extension leads to the delivery of the head,
which then restitutes via external rotation to face either to the maternal right
or left side. This corresponds with rotation of the fetal body, aligning one
shoulder anteriorly below the symphysis pubis and the other posterior toward
the sacrum. Maternal pushing, along with gentle downward traction on the
fetal head, will deliver the anterior shoulder, and upward traction similarly
delivers the posterior shoulder. Delivery of the remainder of the body will
quickly follow. Occasionally, the anterior shoulder will not readily pass below the
pubic symphysis. This is called a shoulder dystocia and is an obstetrical emergency, requiring a coordinated effort by the entire medical team to reduce the
dystocia. Maneuvers, including hyperflexion of the hips (McRoberts maneuver),
suprapubic pressure, cutting an episiotomy, or rotation of the fetal body in the
vaginal canal, are attempted and are usually successful.
Of deliveries in the United States, 20% or more are accomplished via
cesarean delivery. The most common indications are a history of prior cesarean
delivery, arrest of labor or descent, fetal distress necessitating immediate delivery,
and breech presentation. Operative vaginal delivery can be performed using
either forceps or vacuum assistance. These can only be used when the cervix is
completely dilated, membranes are ruptured, the presenting part is the vertex
of the scalp, and there is no disproportion between the size of the fetal head
and maternal pelvis. If any of these conditions are not met and delivery must
be accomplished urgently, a cesarean delivery is indicated.

16.3

A pregnant woman with an estimated gestational age of 34 weeks
presents to the labor triage unit with a clear vaginal discharge. On
sterile speculum examination you see a pool of watery fluid in the
vagina. Microscopic examination reveals “ferning.” Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Urinary incontinency
B. Rupture of membranes
C. Bacterial vaginosis
D. Candida vaginitis

ANSWERS
16.1

B. The cervical dilation beyond 4 cm means active phase. No cervical change for 2 hours is defined as arrest of active phase.

16.2

A. Early decelerations are thought to be caused by fetal head compression. Variable decelerations are caused by cord compression and
late decelerations by uteroplacental insufficiency.

16.3

B. A pool of clear fluid with ferning noted on an air-dried microscopic slide is diagnostic of rupture of fetal membranes. In this case, as
she is 34-week gestation, it represents preterm rupture of membranes.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The presence of accelerations on a fetal heart tracing is very reassuring
and consistent with a fetal pH of 7.2 or more.
➤ The use of universal, prenatal screening for group B Streptococcus and provision of intrapartum antibiotics to women who are colonized can reduce
the risk of GBS disease in infants by approximately 50%.
➤ Fetal heart rate tracings must be interpreted within the overall clinical situation. Reduction in variability shortly after giving a narcotic pain medication may represent fetal sleep cycle; reduction in variability along with
repetitive late decelerations may be an ominous sign of fetal distress.

Case 17
A 58-year-old woman presents to your office for follow-up of an emergency
department visit. She was seen 1 week earlier in the emergency department for abdominal pain and was diagnosed with nephrolithiasis.
Ultimately, she was sent home with pain medications and given instructions to strain her urine for stones and to follow up with her primary care
physician. Today, she is asymptomatic. She takes no medications on a regular basis. Her family history is significant only for a father with high blood
pressure. She had several routine labs drawn in the emergency department,
copies of which she brings with her. Upon your review of the labs, you
note the following (normal values are in parenthesis): sodium 142 mEq/L
(135-145); potassium 4.0 mEq/L (3.5-5.0); chloride 104 mg/dL (95-105);
bicarbonate 28 mEq/L (20-29); blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 20 mg/dL (7-20);
creatinine 0.9 mg/dL (0.8-1.4); calcium 12.5 mg/dL (8.5-10.2); albumin
4.2 g/dL (3.4-5.4). The complete blood count (CBC) was within normal
limits.
The renal calculus was detected by helical CT scanning without contrast and was midureter on the right.
Your patient has brought with her the stone that she has strained
from the urine. Upon questioning, you learn that she has had multiple
episodes of “kidney stones” in the past 2 years. You send the stone to the
lab for analysis and order a repeat serum calcium level. The results show
that the stone is made of calcium oxalate the serum calcium is still elevated
at 11.9 mg/dL.

Summary: This is a 58-year-old woman with a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis, presenting for follow-up and found to have calcium oxalate stones. She
had an initial serum calcium level that was elevated, as was the repeat serum
calcium 1 week later. At the time of her follow up, she was completely asymptomatic. She takes no medications, and has a family history only significant
for hypertension.

Diagnosis: Hypercalcemia and recurrent nephrolithiasis

➤

Most likely cause: Hyperparathyroidism

➤

Next step: Further laboratory workup, including serum parathyroid hormone
(PTH)

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia, especially the
most common etiologies.
2. Understand the workup of hypercalcemia.
3. Learn the basics of calcium regulation.
4. Learn about management options of hyperparathyroidism.

Considerations
This patient illustrates one common presentation of hypercalcemia. Many
times, patients with hypercalcemia are asymptomatic and an elevated calcium
level is found unexpectedly on routine labs. The diagnostic workup begins
with a careful review of the patient’s history, as clues to its etiology may often
be elicited here. The diagnostic workup is designed to distinguish parathyroid
dysfunction from other etiologies so that optimal treatment and management
can be pursued.

179

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Calcium Disorders
DEFINITIONS
HYPERPARATHYROIDISM: Condition of elevated parathyroid hormone usually

due to excessive production by the parathyroid glands, leading to hypercalcemia.
SECONDARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM: Condition as the parathyroid
glands overproduce PTH to respond to low serum calcium levels. This may
occur as a response to low dietary calcium intake or a deficiency of vitamin D.
TERTIARY HYPERPARATHYROIDISM: Elevated PTH in patients who
have renal failure.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Pathophysiology of Calcium Homeostasis
Before discussing the differential diagnosis of hypercalcemia, it is essential to
review the basic mechanism by which normal calcium levels are maintained in
the body. Most of the calcium in the body is found in the skeleton (approximately 98%). The remaining calcium is found in circulation. Of this remaining 2%, about half is bound to albumin and other proteins, and half is “free,”
or ionized. It is the ionized calcium that has physiologic effects. Because the
serum calcium is partially bound to albumin, abnormally low serum albumin
levels will affect the measurement of calcium, thus causing a misinterpretation
of an abnormal calcium level. With patients found to have a concomitant
hypoalbuminemia, the ionized calcium can be measured directly. However,
there is a useful formula that can correct for this error. A “corrected” serum calcium is provided by the formula:
“Corrected” serum calcium = [(Normal albumin) × (Patient’s albumin
level)] × [0.8 × (serum calcium)]
PTH, calcitonin, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (calcitriol) are responsible
for regulating calcium levels and maintaining calcium homeostasis. Causes of
hypercalcemia include an increase in calcium resorption from bone, decreased
renal excretion of calcium, or an increase in calcium absorption from the
gastrointestinal tract. When calcium levels increase, calcitonin, produced by
the thyroid parafollicular cells, attempts to lower calcium levels through renal
excretion of calcium and by opposing osteoclast activation. When calcium is
excreted through this pathway, phosphate is also excreted. Conversely, low
levels of circulating calcium normally result in PTH secretion. This promotes

180

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

osteoclast activation, which mobilizes calcium from bone and effects calcium
resorption at the kidneys, thereby retaining circulating calcium. While PTH
will increase the calcium in the blood, it has the opposite effect on serum
phosphate levels. PTH also increases calcitriol levels, which act at the gastrointestinal tract to promote both calcium and phosphate absorption.

HYPERCALCEMIA
Etiology
Any process that increases gastrointestinal calcium absorption, decreases
renal excretion, or activates osteoclastic activity will raise serum calcium levels.
If this occurs beyond the normal bounds of maintaining calcium homeostasis,
hypercalcemia will occur. The most common cause of hypercalcemia in the
ambulatory patient is hyperparathyroidism. Cancer ranks as the second leading cause, as hypercalcemia is often an early manifestation of malignancy.
Hyperparathyroidism and cancer combined account for 90% of hypercalcemia
cases. It is useful to categorize the etiologies of hypercalcemia into five main
areas: parathyroid hormone-related, malignancy, renal failure, high bone
turnover, and those related to Vitamin D (Table 17–1).

Clinical Manifestations of Hypercalcemia
Normal values of serum calcium range from 8 to 10 mg/dL, which correspond
to an ionized calcium level of 4 to 5.6 mg/dL. Levels of serum calcium between
10.5 and 12 mg/dL are classified as mild hypercalcemia; patients are frequently
asymptomatic at these levels. As calcium levels increase, physical manifestations may become apparent. The classic mnemonic, “stones, bones, psychic
groans, and abdominal moans” is useful to categorize the constellation of
physical symptoms associated with hypercalcemia (Table 17–2). Other clinical manifestations include the cardiac sequelae of shortening QT interval and
arrhythmias.

Diagnostic Approach
The diagnostic approach to hypercalcemia begins with a careful history,
including the manifestations of elevated calcium levels. When the aforementioned etiologies are taken into consideration, it becomes clear that the history should include family history of calcium disorders, such as renal stones or
malignancy. The patient’s risk factors for malignancy, such as smoking, should
be investigated. A careful review of medications should also take place, to
include not only prescription medications but also over-the-counter supplements. Dietary history is also an important component. At this point, if the
hypercalcemia is mild and the patient asymptomatic, it is acceptable to stop
the suspect medication and repeat the serum calcium level.

The next step, if a causative medication is not found, is to measure a serum
intact PTH level. This level will either be suppressed, normal, or elevated. As
with many endocrine disorders, it is useful not to think of normal or abnormal values; rather, one should understand what is appropriate for a given
situation. For example, in normal subjects, an increased calcium load will
normally depress the PTH hormone level, thus a low PTH level in this situation is normal, or appropriately suppressed. If a patient has an elevated calcium level and the PTH is “normal,” it is said to be inappropriately normal,
because in the face of hypercalcemia it should be low, or suppressed.
If our patient with hypercalcemia has a normal or elevated PTH level,
then the normal feedback loop is not responding. In this situation, the pituitary is producing PTH without check, which, in turn, is elevating the calcium level. This is hyperparathyroidism. Primary hyperparathyroidism occurs
when the parathyroid gland overproduces PTH and does not respond to the
negative feedback of elevated calcium levels. The vast majority of primary
hyperparathyroidism is caused by an adenoma (benign tumor) of one of the
four parathyroid glands.
Secondary hyperparathyroidism occurs as the parathyroid glands overproduce PTH to respond to low serum calcium levels. This may occur as a
response to low dietary calcium intake or a deficiency of vitamin D. Tertiary
hyperparathyroidism occurs in patients who have renal failure. Patients in
renal failure usually present with hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and low
vitamin D levels. If this is untreated, it leads to hyperplasia of the parathyroid
glands, an increased PTH secretion, and subsequent hypercalcemia.
There is a condition that can produce inappropriately high PTH levels
unrelated to the parathyroid production. This is familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), a genetic disorder related to a defect in a gene that codes for
a calcium-sensing receptor. Consequently, simply measuring PTH alone may
confound this diagnosis, which may be mistaken for primary hyperparathyroidism. To distinguish these entities, a 24-hour urinary calcium level is obtained.

CLINICAL CASES

183

In hyperparathyroidism, the kidneys spill calcium into the urine at a normal
or elevated level. With FHH the urinary calcium level is low.
A PTH level that is low with elevated serum calcium suggests that the
parathyroid gland is responding appropriately to the high calcium environment. The etiology in this scenario must be some process that causes calcium
to be released from bone or calcium to be absorbed from the gut despite the
suppressed PTH. This is seen when tumors produce a hormone that mimics
the active site of the PTH molecule, particularly in respect to the bone and
renal effects, but that have no counter regulatory mechanism for suppression
when calcium levels rise. This molecule is called parathyroid hormone-related
peptide (PTH-rP). PTH-rP is produced by lung cancers, squamous cell cancers of the head and neck, and renal cell cancer. PTH-rP effects osteoclastic
bone resorption, increases calcitriol, and promotes calcium resorption from
the kidneys, resulting in increased levels of serum calcium. The continued
production of PTH-rP effectively takes the parathyroid gland out of the loop
in calcium homeostasis. Because cancer is a common etiology for hypercalcemia, the search for malignancy is paramount at this step in diagnosis,
before other, less common, disorders are considered.
If a malignancy is not found, other etiologies must be considered. These fall
into the category of endocrine disorders other than parathyroid and include
hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and acromegaly. The workup thus
includes thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), a cortisol level, and a pituitary
imaging study, respectively.

Treatment of Hypercalcemia
The treatment of hypercalcemia is directed at the underlying disorder.
Patients with mild hypercalcemia may be treated with preventative measures
aimed at avoiding aggravating factors. These measures include adequate hydration (dehydration aggravates nephrolithiasis), avoiding thiazide diuretics or
other offending medications, encouraging physical activity, and avoiding prolonged inactivity. Other interventions for mild hypercalcemia are disease specific.
For the treatment of primary hyperparathyroidism, surgical parathyroidectomy is the definitive treatment. Surgery is appropriate for patients with
symptomatic hyperparathyroidism. Surgery may be an option for selected
asymptomatic patients, including those who have developed osteoporosis or
renal insufficiency, who have markedly elevated calcium levels, or who are
younger than age 50 years.

Comprehension Questions
17.1

A 60-year-old man comes into your office with the complaint of fatigue
and constipation. He has had no dietary changes recently. A history
reveals that he has hypertension, treated with medications, and an
inguinal hernia that was repaired 10 years earlier without complications. The examination was nonspecific. You decide to obtain an electrolyte panel and find that the calcium level is elevated at 11.5 mg/dL
(normal 8.5-10.2). Other labs were normal. Which of the following is
the next step?
A. Consult vascular surgery for placement of a dialysis catheter and
schedule for dialysis.
B. Advise the patient to drink plenty of fluids and repeat the labs in
1 month.
C. Explore the patient’s hypertension, including what medications he
takes.
D. Obtain a chest x-ray, looking for possible malignancy.

17.2

A 48-year-old man presents for follow-up of an elevated calcium level
of 12.3 mg/dL found on routine screening labs at his last well-man
visit. He takes no medications other than an occasional antihistamine
for allergies. He recently started smoking a half-pack of cigarettes per
day. He was prompted to attend to his well-man visit by his wife who
claims that he has become forgetful, has a decreased appetite, and has
had a 10-lb weight loss over the past 2 months. As part of his followup labs, you obtain a serum PTH, which comes back within the normal range. Which of the following is the next step in diagnosis?
A. Chest x-ray
B. Repeat calcium after hydration
C. Measurement of PTH-rP levels
D. Measurement of urinary calcium excretion

17.3

You obtain follow-up labs for a hypercalcemic patient and find that
the PTH level is suppressed. There are no suspect medications. You
suspect lung cancer based on a 30 pack-year smoking history, but the
chest x-ray is normal. Which of the following is the next most appropriate step?
A. Continue a malignancy workup.
B. Check TSH, as a thyroid disorder may be the cause.
C. Refer the patient to an endocrinologist, as hypercalciuric hypercalcemia is an exceedingly rare genetic cause of an elevated calcium that requires specialist care.
D. Measure urinary calcium excretion.

CLINICAL CASES

185

ANSWERS
17.1

C. When presented with a patient who has elevated calcium levels,
the first step is to determine if there are any causative medications.
Hydrochlorothiazide is a commonly used antihypertensive medication
that may contribute to elevated calcium levels (thiazide diuretic).

17.2

D. This patient has symptomatic hypercalcemia. He has an inappropriately normal PTH level, which should be suppressed with this
degree of hypercalcemia. The next step is to measure a 24-hour urinary calcium excretion to determine if this condition represents primary hyperparathyroidism (most common) or familial hypocalciuric
hypercalcemia (rare).

17.3

A. In a hypercalcemic patient, a suppressed PTH first should be considered a sign of malignancy until proven otherwise. A chest x-ray is
insufficient to rule out malignancy, as there are other malignancies
that can cause hypercalcemia, mediated either by way of PTH-rP or
through direct osteoclastic bone resorption. Multiple myeloma, granulomatous disease such as tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and Hodgkin lymphoma, breast cancer, and squamous cell cancers of the head and neck
can cause an elevated calcium with an appropriately suppressed PTH.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Be sure to question any patient with hypercalcemia regarding all medications—
both prescription and over-the-counter—as both megadose vitamins
(A and D) and excessive use of calcium carbonate antacids may play a role.
➤ Most cases of primary hyperparathyroidism occur in postmenopausal women,
who are often already at increased risk of osteoporosis. Be sure to check their
bone density with a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.
➤ Hypercalcemia with a suppressed PTH should be considered malignancy
until you can prove otherwise.

Case 18
A 75-year-old white man presents for a health maintenance check-up.
The patient has stable hypertension but has not seen a physician in
more than 2 years. He denies any particular problems. He lives alone.
He takes an aspirin a day and is compliant with his blood pressure medication (hydrochlorothiazide). His son fears that his father is either
experiencing a stroke or getting Alzheimer disease because his father is
having trouble with speech discrimination and understanding what family
members are saying during social events. The son reported no noticeable
weakness or gait impairment. On physical examination, the patient’s blood
pressure was 130/80 mm Hg. Examination of the ears showed no cerumen
impaction and normal tympanic membranes. His general examination is
normal. Laboratory studies, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH),
are normal.

Geriatric Health Maintenance
Summary: A 75-year-old man who presents with loss of speech discrimination
and complains of difficulty understanding speech and conversation in noisy areas
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Presbycusis.

➤

Next step: Presbycusis is a diagnosis of exclusion. Hearing aids are underused in presbycusis but are potentially beneficial for most types of hearing
loss, including sensorineural hearing loss. Consequently, referral to an audiologist for testing and consideration of amplification with a hearing aid may
be an important next step.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with geriatric health maintenance.
2. Be aware of the importance of geriatric screening.

Considerations
The patient described in the case is a 75-year-old man who has difficulty with
speech discrimination and complains of difficulty understanding speech and conversation in noisy areas. He most likely has presbycusis, which is an age-related
sensorineural hearing loss typically associated with both selective high-frequency
loss and difficulty with speech discrimination. Physical examination of the ears
in patients with presbycusis is normal. Other conditions in the differential diagnosis include cerumen impaction, otosclerosis, and central auditory processing
disorder. Cerumen impaction and otosclerosis can be diagnosed by otoscopy.
Central auditory processing disorder is diagnosed when the patient can hear
sounds without difficulty, but has difficulty in understanding spoken words.

FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT: An evaluation process that gauges a patient’s

ability to manage tasks of self-care, household management, and mobility.

CLINICAL APPROACH
By the year 2030 the number of people aged 65 years and older is expected to
double from what it was in 1999, increasing from 34 million to 69 million.
Geriatric health maintenance provides screening and therapy with the goal of
enhancing function and preserving health in the elderly. Screening is not
indicated unless early therapy for the screened condition is more effective
than late therapy or no therapy. Preventive services for the elderly include
as goals the optimization of quality of life, satisfaction with life, and maintenance of independence and productivity. Most recommendations for
patients older than age 65 years overlap recommendations for the general
adult population. Certain categories are unique to older patients, including
sensory perception and accident. The primary care physician can perform
effective health screening using simple and relatively easily administered
assessment tools (Figure 18–1)

Functional Assessment
Functional assessment gauges a patient’s ability to manage tasks of self-care,
household management, and mobility. Impairment in activities of daily living
results in an increased risk of falls, hip fracture, depression, and institutionalization. An estimated 25% of patients older than age 65 years have impairments
in their instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) or activities of daily living (ADL) (Table 18–1) Persons who are unable to perform IADL independently are far more likely to have dementia than their independent counterparts.

Vision Screening
Visual impairment is an independent risk factor for falls, which has a significant impact on quality of life. Direct visual testing with a Snellen chart or
Jaeger card is the most sensitive and specific approach to visual screening.
Referring all older people for a complete eye examination has the advantages
of improving the quality of the examination and allowing for cataract and
glaucoma screening. The majority of conditions leading to vision loss in the
elderly are presbyopia, macular degeneration, glaucoma, cataract, and diabetic
retinopathy.
The incidence of presbyopia increases with age. Patients have difficulty
focusing on near objects while their distant vision remains intact. Age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of severe vision loss in the
elders. AMD is characterized by atrophy of cells in the central macular region

of the retinal pigment epithelium, resulting in the loss of central vision.
Glaucoma is characterized by a group of optic neuropathies that can occur in
all ages. Although glaucoma is most often associated with elevated intraocular
pressure, it is the optic neuropathy that defines the disease. Cataract is any
opacification of the lens. Age-related, or senile, cataracts account for 90% of
all cataracts. Cataract disease is the most common cause of blindness worldwide. Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults in the United States. It is important to consider diabetic retinopathy in
geriatric vision screening.

Hearing Screening
More than one-third of persons older than age 65 years and half of those older
than age 85 years have some hearing loss. This deficit is correlated with social
isolation and depression. The whispered voice test has sensitivities and specificities ranging from 70% to 100%. The initial office screening for general
hearing loss can be reliably performed with questionnaire such as the HHIE-S
(Hearing Handicap Inventory for the Elderly). Limited office-based pure-tone
audiometry is more accurate in identifying patients who would benefit from a
more formal audiometry.
The majority of patients with hearing impairment will present with complaints unrelated to their sensory deficit. In a quiet examination room with
face-to-face conversation, patients can overcome significant hearing loss and
avoid detection from a physician. Family members are often more concerned
about the hearing loss than the patient. Common causes of geriatric hearing
impairments are presbycusis, noise-induced hearing loss, cerumen impaction,
otosclerosis, and central auditory processing disorder. Presbycusis is age-related
sensorineural hearing loss usually associated with both selective high-frequency
loss and difficulty with speech discrimination. Presbycusis is the most common
form of hearing loss in the elderly. Because it often goes unrecognized, exact
prevalence data are lacking. Presbycusis is a diagnosis of exclusion. Complete
deafness is not an expected end result of presbycusis. Noise-induced hearing
loss is essentially a wear and tear phenomenon that can occur with either
industrial or recreational noise exposure. Patients will typically present with tinnitus, difficulty with speech discrimination, and problems hearing background
noise. Cerumen impaction in the external auditory canal is a common, frequently overlooked problem in the elderly that may produce a transient, mild
conductive hearing loss. It is estimated that 25% to 35% of institutionalized or
hospitalized elderly are affected by impacted cerumen. Otosclerosis is an autosomal dominant disorder of the bones in the inner ear. It results in progressive
conductive hearing loss with onset most commonly in the late twenties to the
early forties. Speech discrimination is typically preserved. Geriatric patients with
hearing loss may have otosclerosis complicating their presentation. Central auditory processing disorder (CAPD) is the general term for conditions involving

192

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

hearing impairment that results from CNS dysfunction. The patient with
CAPD will have difficulty understanding spoken language, but may be able to
hear sounds well.

Fall Assessment
Falls are the leading cause of nonfatal injuries in the elderly. The associated
complications are the leading cause of death from injury in those older than
age 65 years. Hip fractures are common precursors to functional impairment
and nursing home placement. Approximately 30% of the noninstitutionalized elderly fall each year. The annual incidence of falls approaches 50% in
patients older than 80 years of age. Factors contributing to falls include agerelated postural changes, alterations in visual ability, certain medications, and
diseases affecting muscle strength and coordination. Every older person should
be asked about falls, as many will not volunteer such information. Gait impairments commonly coexist with falls.

Cognitive Screening
The prevalence of dementia doubles every 5 years after age 60, so that by age
85 approximately 30% to 50% of individuals have some degree of impairment.
Patients with mild or early dementia frequently remain undiagnosed because
their social graces are retained. The combination of the “clock draw” and
the “three-item recall” is a rapid and fairly reliable office-based screening
for dementia. When patients fail either of these screening tests, further testing with the Folstein Mini-Mental State questionnaire should be performed.

Incontinence Screening
Incontinence in the elderly is common. Incontinence is estimated to affect
11% to 34% of elderly men and 17% to 55% of elderly women. Continence
problems are frequently treatable, have major social and emotional consequences, but are often not raised by patients as a concern.

Depression Screening
Depressive symptoms are more common in the elderly despite major depressive disorder being slightly lower in prevalence when compared with younger
populations. Unlike dementia, depression is usually treatable. Depression
significantly increases morbidity and mortality, and is often overlooked by
physicians. A simple two-question screen (Have you felt down/depressed/hopeless
in the last 2 weeks? and Have you felt little interest or pleasure in doing things?) shows
high sensitivity. Positive responses can be followed up with a Geriatric Depression
Scale, a 30-question instrument that is sensitive, specific, and reliable for the
diagnosis of depression in the elderly.

CLINICAL CASES

193

Nutrition Screening
Approximately 15% of older outpatients and half of the hospitalized elderly
are malnourished. A combination of serial weight measurements obtained
in the office and inquiry about changing appetite are likely the most useful methods of assessing nutritional status in the elderly. Adequate calcium
intake for women is advised. Supplementation with a multivitamin formulated at about 100% daily value can decrease the prevalence of suboptimal
vitamin status in older adults and improve their micronutrient status to levels
associated with reduced risk for several chronic diseases. Malnutrition is common
in nursing homes, and protein undernutrition has a prevalence of 17% to 56% in
this setting. Protein undernutrition is associated with an increased risk of infections, anemia, orthostatic hypotension, and decubitus ulcers.

Hypertension Screening
Treatment of hypertension is of substantial benefit in the elderly. Heart disease and cerebrovascular disease are leading causes of death in the elderly.
Treatment of hypertension has contributed to a reduction in mortality from
both stroke and coronary artery disease. Lifestyle modifications are recommended for all hypertensive patients. Thiazides are the drugs of choice unless
a comorbid condition makes another choice preferable.

Stroke Prevention
The incidence of stroke in older adults roughly doubles with each 10 years of
age. The greatest risk factor is hypertension followed by atrial fibrillation.
Anticoagulation with warfarin reduces the risk of strokes in people with
atrial fibrillation, but many elderly patients are not anticoagulated because
of the fear of injuries from falls. In most instances, the benefits of anticoagulation are likely to outweigh the increased risk of fall-related bleeding, unless
the patient has multiple falls, high-risk falls, or a very low risk of stroke.

Cancer Screening
Screening elderly men for prostate cancer is not routinely recommended, as it
has not been definitively shown to prolong life and because of the risk of
incontinence or erectile dysfunction caused by the treatments. An older woman
should undergo annual mammography until her life expectancy falls below
5 to 10 years. Screening for colon cancer (either with colonoscopy every
10 years or with annual fecal occult testing plus flexible sigmoidoscopy every
5 years) can be stopped when a patient’s life expectancy is less than 5 to
10 years.

194

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Osteoporosis Screening
The prevalence of low bone mineral density in the elderly is high, with
osteopenia found in 37% of postmenopausal women. Primary prevention of
osteoporosis begins with identification of risk factors (older age, female gender, white or Asian race, low calcium intake, smoking, excessive alcohol use,
and chronic glucocorticoid use). Calcium carbonate (500 mg three times
daily) and vitamin D (400-800 IU/d) reduce the risk of osteoporotic fractures
in both men and women. Bone mineral density testing using dual-energy x-ray
absorptiometry (DEXA) of patients with multiple risk factors may uncover
asymptomatic osteoporosis.

Immunizations
Individuals older than age 65 years should receive annual influenza vaccination. Similarly, persons older than age 65 should receive at least one pneumococcal immunization and a single booster dose of tetanus and diphtheria
vaccine. One dose of herpes zoster vaccine is recommended at age 60 or older.

END OF LIFE ISSUES
Advance Directives
Well-informed, competent adults have a right to refuse medical intervention, even if refusal is likely to result in death. To further patient autonomy,
physicians are obligated to inform patients about the risks, benefits, alternatives, and expected outcomes of end-of-life medical interventions such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation, intubation and mechanical ventilation, vasopressor
medication, hospitalization and ICU care, and artificial nutrition and hydration. Advance directives are oral or written statements made by patients when
they are competent that are intended to guide care should they become incompetent. Advance directives allow patients to project their autonomy. Although
oral statements about these matters are ethically binding, they are not legally
binding in all states. Written advance directives are essential so as to give effect
to the patient’s wishes in these matters.

Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care (DPOA-HC)
A durable power of attorney allows the patient to designate a surrogate decision
maker. The responsibility of the surrogate is to provide “substituted judgment”
to decide as the patient would, not as the surrogate wants. In the absence of
a designated surrogate, physicians turn to family members or next of kin,
under the assumption that they know the patient’s wishes.

CLINICAL CASES

195

Do Not Attempt Resuscitation (DNAR) Orders
Physicians should encourage patients to express their preferences for the use
of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Despite the favorable portrayal of
CPR in the media, only approximately 15% of all patients who undergo
CPR in the hospital survive to hospital discharge. DNAR (“do not attempt
resuscitation”) is the preferred term over DNR (“do not resuscitate) to
emphasize the low likelihood of successful resuscitation. In addition to mortality statistics, patients deciding about CPR preferences should also be
informed about the possible consequences of surviving a CPR attempt. CPR
may result in fractured ribs, lacerated internal organs, and neurologic disability.
There is also a high likelihood of requiring other aggressive interventions if
CPR is successful. For some patients at the end of life, decisions about CPR
may not be about whether they will live but about how they will die.

Which of the following is the leading cause of blindness worldwide?
A. Glaucoma
B. Vitamin A deficiency
C. Age-related, or senile, cataracts
D. Diabetic retinopathy

ANSWERS
18.1

C. The combination of DRE and PSA is known to increase the sensitivity and specificity of prostate cancer detection. However, the
benefit of routine use of checking prostate-specific antigen and rectal
examination to detect prostate cancer is questionable. It is a Category I
recommendation.

18.2

C. Up to one-third of persons older than age 65 years suffer from hearing loss. Presbycusis typically presents with symmetric high-frequency
hearing loss. There is loss of speech discrimination, so that patients
complain of difficulty understanding rapid speech, foreign accents,
and conversation in noisy areas. The mechanism is sensorineural
rather than a conductive problem.

18.3

C. The vast majority of cataracts are age related, although there are
other causes. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness worldwide.
Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults in the United States. Age-related macular degeneration is the
most common cause of severe vision loss in the elderly.

Case 19
A 45-year-old man presents to the clinic with a cough productive of
purulent sputum of 3-week duration. He says that he had just gotten
over a cold a few weeks prior to this episode. He occasionally has fevers
and he coughs so much that he has chest pain. He reports having a mild
sore throat and nasal congestion. He has no history of asthma or of any
chronic lung diseases. He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and any
recent travel. He denies any smoking history. On examination, his temperature is 98.6°F (37.0°C), his pulse is 96 beats/min, his blood pressure
is 124/82 mm Hg, his respiratory rate is 18 breaths/min, and his oxygen
saturation is 99% on room air. Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT)
examination reveals no erythema of the posterior oropharynx, tonsillar
exudates, uvular deviations, or significant tonsillar swelling. Neck examination is negative. The chest examination yields occasional wheezes
but normal air movement is noted.

ANSWERS TO CASE 19:
Acute Bronchitis
Summary: A 45-year-old man, who has no history of lung disease and does
not smoke, with 3 weeks of productive cough following an upper respiratory
infection.
➤

Likely diagnosis: Acute bronchitis.

➤

Next step: Bronchodilators, analgesics, antitussives; antibiotics have not
been consistently shown to be beneficial. The illness is usually self-limited.

➤

Common noninfectious causes of cough: Asthma, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD), malignancy, postnasal drip, gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD), medication side effect (eg, angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors), congestive heart failure.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a differential diagnosis of cough persisting for 3 weeks or more.
2. Understand that most upper respiratory infections are self-limited illnesses.
3. Develop an approach for rational prescription of antibiotics for respiratory
infections.

Considerations
The patient described in the case is a 45-year-old man with no prior history
of lung disease, immunocompromised state, or tobacco use. These risk factors
are important considerations since respiratory complains in the setting of
COPD or HIV or a smoking history require a higher index of suspicion of
lower respiratory tract infections such as pneumonia. As with any respiratory
complaint, the ABCs should be considered; that is airway and breathing. In
the ambulatory setting, a very quick assessment of the patient’s distress level,
respiratory use or nonuse of accessory muscles, anxiety level, stridor, and ability to speak sentences helps to triage to acute emergency versus more relaxed
assessment. The individual described is afebrile, has a normal respiratory rate,
and appears to be comfortable. The lung examination reveals some slight
wheezes but otherwise normal breath sounds and air movement. The most
likely diagnosis in this setting is acute bronchitis. Chest radiograph is not
necessarily indicated; however, since the complaint has persisted for 3 weeks,
any other abnormal finding such as dullness on percussion of the chest, history of fever, or clinical suspicion would be sufficient reason for chest x-ray.

201

CLINICAL CASES

Most acute bronchitis is caused by viruses and antibiotic therapy is not helpful. This patient is best treated by bronchodilator therapy such as albuterol
and antitussive agents and follow-up in 2 to 3 weeks.

APPROACH TO
Upper Respiratory Infections
DEFINITIONS
ACUTE BRONCHITIS: Inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree.
PNEUMONIA: Inflammation or infection of the lower respiratory tract,
involving the distal bronchioles and alveoli.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Acute Bronchitis
Acute bronchitis refers to inflammation of the tracheobronchial tree. The
inflammatory response to the trigger, whether infectious, allergic, or irritant,
leads to increased mucous production and airway hyperresponsiveness. As
bronchitis most commonly occurs in the setting of an upper respiratory illness,
it is seen more frequently in the winter. Influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus,
rhinovirus, other viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Chlamydia pneumoniae
have been implicated as causes.
As the primary symptoms are nonspecific, other etiologies can be mistakenly diagnosed as acute bronchitis. In one study, one-third of patients who
had been determined to have recurrent bouts of acute bronchitis were eventually identified as having asthma. Occupational history may be important in
determining whether irritants play a role.
There are no specific diagnostic criteria for acute bronchitis, although cough
productive of purulent sputum is the most common presentation. Other symptoms are often present, including fever, malaise, rhinorrhea or nasal congestion,
sore throat, wheezing, dyspnea, chest pain, myalgias, or arthralgias. The sputum
produced can be of variable color and consistency; the color of sputum is not
diagnostic of the presence of a bacterial infection.
The physical examination in bronchitis is typically nonspecific and, frequently, is normal. The presence of fever, tachypnea, tachycardia, and hypoor hypertension should be noted. In persons with underlying pulmonary or
cardiac conditions, or in persons with more severe symptoms, oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry may be warranted. Examination of the lungs may reveal
rales, rhonchi, or wheezes, but in most cases is unremarkable.

202

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Occasionally, findings on examination may suggest a particular etiology or
an alternate diagnosis. Prolonged fever and signs of consolidation on pulmonary examination may suggest a diagnosis of pneumonia. When pneumonia
is suspected, a chest radiograph should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis.
Conjunctivitis and adenopathy suggest adenoviral infection, although these
findings are not specific.
Bronchitis is nearly always self-limited in an otherwise healthy individual.
Although most acute bronchitis lasts for less than 2 weeks, in some cases the
cough can last for 2 months or more. Severe cases occasionally produce deterioration in patients with significant comorbid conditions.

Treatment
The use of antibiotics has not been shown consistently to alter the natural
history of acute bronchitis, except in the uncommon case of infection with
Bordetella pertussis. Patients with abnormal vital signs (pulse ≥100 beats/min, respiration ≥24 breaths/min, temperature ≥100.4°F [38.0°C]) and examination
findings consistent with pulmonary consolidation should be evaluated further for
the diagnosis of pneumonia and treated appropriately, if confirmed. Pneumonia
may present atypically in the elderly and in persons with chronic lung disease.
Physicians must have a higher index of suspicion in these populations.
As some of the symptoms of bronchitis are caused by airway hyperreactivity, bronchodilator therapy has been shown in some studies to offer benefit in
reducing symptoms. Antitussives, such as dextromethorphan and codeine,
may have modest benefits in reducing the cough associated with this illness.

OTHER INFECTIONS OF THE UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT
Rhinosinusitis
Rhinosinusitis is the inflammation/infection of the nasal mucosa and of one
or more paranasal sinuses. Sinusitis occurs with obstruction of the normal
drainage mechanism. It is traditionally subdivided into acute (symptoms lasting <4 weeks), subacute (symptoms lasting 4-12 weeks), chronic (symptoms
lasting >12 weeks), and acute exacerbation of chronic sinusitis.
The signs and symptoms of rhinosinusitis are nonspecific and similar to other
general upper respiratory tract infection symptoms. As most viral upper respiratory tract infections improve in 7 to 10 days, expert opinion suggests considering a diagnosis of bacterial rhinosinusitis after 7 days of symptoms in
adults and 10 days in children. The diagnosis is suggested by the presence of
purulent nasal discharge, maxillary tooth or facial pain, unilateral maxillary
sinus tenderness, and worsening of symptoms after initial improvement.
Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the organisms most
commonly responsible for acute bacterial sinusitis in adults; S pneumoniae,

CLINICAL CASES

203

H influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis are most common in children. In chronic
sinusitis, the infecting organisms are variable, with a higher incidence of anaerobic
organisms seen (eg, Bacteroides, Peptostreptococcus, and Fusobacterium species).
Treatment of acute sinusitis should be directed at the likely causative
agents. Amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole are widely used firstline agents, typically for 10- to 14-day regimens. Second-line antibiotics, for
those who fail to improve on the initial regimen or who have recurrent or
severe disease, include amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, second- or third-generation
cephalosporins (cefuroxime, cefaclor, cefprozil, and others), fluoroquinolones,
or second-generation macrolides (azithromycin, clarithromycin). Adjunctive
therapy with oral or topical decongestants may provide symptomatic relief.
Topical decongestants should not be used for more than 3 days, to avoid the risk
of rebound vasodilation with resultant worsening of symptoms. Nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen may provide symptomatic relief of pain and fever.

Pharyngitis
Pharyngitis is an inflammation or irritation of the pharynx and/or tonsils. In
adults, the vast majority of pharyngitis is viral. It can also be bacterial or
allergic in origin; trauma, toxins, and malignancy are rare causes. As most
cases of pharyngitis in adults are benign and self-limited, a focus of the examination of a patient with symptoms of pharyngitis should be to rule out more
serious conditions, such as epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess, and to diagnose
group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) infection.
Pharyngitis occurs with much greater frequency in the pediatric population, with a peak incidence between 4 and 7 years of age. Mycoplasma pneumoniae,
Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Arcanobacterium haemolyticus are common causes
of pharyngitis in teens and young adults. GAS causes 15% of all adult pharyngitis and approximately 30% of pediatric cases.
The cause of pharyngitis cannot always be distinguished based on history
or examination. Sore throat associated with cough and rhinorrhea is more
likely to be viral in origin. The presence of tonsillar exudates does not distinguish bacterial from viral causes, as GAS, Epstein-Barr virus (infectious
mononucleosis), mycoplasma, chlamydia, and adenoviruses, among others,
can all cause exudates. Findings frequently associated with GAS infections
include an abrupt onset of sore throat and fever, tonsillar and/or palatal
petechiae, tender cervical adenopathy, and absence of cough. GAS can also
cause an erythematous, sandpaperlike (scarlatiniform) rash.
Infectious mononucleosis, caused by infection with Epstein-Barr virus,
is extremely difficult to distinguish clinically from GAS infection. Exudative
pharyngitis is prominent. Features suggestive of mononucleosis include retrocervical or generalized adenopathy and hepatosplenomegaly. Atypical lymphocytes can be seen on peripheral blood smear. The associated splenomegaly
can be significant, as it predisposes to splenic rupture in response to trauma

204

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

(even minor trauma). A patient with splenomegaly from mononucleosis
should be restricted from activities, such as sports participation, in which
abdominal trauma may occur.
On examination, the patency of the airway must be addressed first. The
presence of stridor, drooling, and a toxic appearance suggest epiglottitis. Patients
with epiglottitis are sometimes seen leaning forward on their outstretched arms,
the so-called tripod position. Patients with suspected epiglottitis need to be
managed in a setting where the airway can be emergently secured, via intubation or cricothyroidotomy. Epiglottitis is a rare infection and is becoming even
rarer, with near universal immunization for H influenzae, type B.
Swelling of the peritonsillar region, with the associated tonsil pushed
toward the midline and with contralateral deviation of the uvula, is consistent with a peritonsillar abscess. This can be seen either as the initial complaint of sore throat, frequently with associated trismus (pain with chewing),
or as a complication of streptococcal pharyngitis. Suspicion of peritonsillar
abscess should prompt immediate referral for surgical drainage of the abscess.
The diagnosis of GAS infection can be made by rapid antigen testing or
throat culture. Rapid antigen tests can be conducted in a few minutes in the
office or emergency department setting. They are highly specific but have a
lower sensitivity than throat culture. A positive rapid antigen test would
prompt antibiotic treatment; a negative test should be followed by a throat
culture. Throat cultures are considered the gold standard for diagnosis of
GAS infections. Cultures can take 24 to 48 hours; this is acceptable in most
instances, as the risk of complication from GAS infections is low if treatment
is instituted within 10 days of onset of symptoms.
Complications from untreated GAS infections are rare, but include rheumatic fever, glomerulonephritis, toxic shock syndrome, peritonsillar abscess,
meningitis, and bacteremia. Rheumatic fever, which may complicate up to
1 in 400 untreated cases of GAS pharyngitis, can cause permanent cardiac and
neurologic sequelae. Glomerulonephritis results from antigen/antibody complex deposition in the glomeruli. Poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis may
occur whether or not the patient receives appropriate antibiotic treatment.
Penicillin is the antibiotic of choice for GAS pharyngitis. Oral therapy
requires a 10-day course of penicillin V. Intramuscular therapy of penicillin G
benzathine for adults and children weighing more than 27 kg is 1.2 million
units. Children who weigh less than 27 kg can receive 600,000 units of penicillin IM. In penicillin-allergic patients, treatment options include cephalosporins
and macrolides.

INFECTIONS OF THE EAR
Otitis externa (OE) is an infection of the external auditory canal. Patients
with OE complain of ear pain and, sometimes, itching. The pain from OE can
be severe. Examination shows an inflamed, swollen, external ear canal, often

CLINICAL CASES

205

with exudates and discharge. Movement of the external ear is usually quite
painful. The tympanic membrane may be uninvolved. The most common
pathogens include staphylococci, streptococci, and other skin flora. Some cases
have been associated with the use of swimming pools or hot tubs. This infection (swimmer’s ear) is usually caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Irrigation
and administration of topical antibiotics, frequently combined with steroid, is
usually successful. Patients with diabetes mellitus are at risk for an invasive
external otitis (malignant OE) caused by P aeruginosa. Treatment for this
condition involves surgical debridement of necrotic tissue and 4 to 6 weeks of
IV antibiotics, if cranial bones are involved.
Otitis media (OM) is an infection of the middle ear seen primarily among
preschool children, but occasionally in adults as well. Infection of the middle
ear space, caused by upper respiratory tract pathogens, is promoted by obstruction to drainage through edematous, congested eustachian tubes. Viral infection with serous otitis may predispose to acute bacterial otitis media. Fever, ear
pain, diminished hearing, vertigo, and tinnitus are common presenting symptoms.
On examination, the tympanic membrane may appear red, but the presence of
decreased membrane mobility or fluid behind the tympanic membrane are necessary for the diagnosis. S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and M catarrhalis are the most
common bacterial pathogens. Most cases of acute OM will resolve spontaneously.
Indications for treatment with antibiotics include prolonged, recurrent, or severe
symptoms. Numerous antibiotics can be used for treatment. Amoxicillin remains
the recommended initial therapy. Alternative treatments include amoxicillinclavulanic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, or second- and third-generation
cephalosporins. Complications are uncommon, but include mastoiditis, bacterial
meningitis, brain abscess, and subdural empyema.

Comprehension Questions
19.1

A 25-year-old healthy woman presents with a cough productive of yellowish sputum for the past week. She has also had a runny nose and
sore throat. Her 2-year-old son has been sick with a similar illness. In
your office she is afebrile, has a normal ear, nose, and throat (ENT)
examination and clear lungs. Which of the following statements is
most accurate about this patient?
A. She most likely has a viral infection.
B. Because she has a cough productive of yellow sputum, she most
likely has a bacterial infection.
C. This is probably the initial presentation of asthma.
D. This is probably related to a seasonal allergy.

206

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

19.2

A 40-year-old man presents with severe unilateral ear pain for the past
3 days. He swims daily at the YMCA for exercise. Which of the following are you most likely to find on examination?
A. A bulging tympanic membrane
B. Fever
C. An inflamed external ear canal
D. Tenderness over the mastoid process

19.3

An 18-year-old adolescent female comes to the office with a sore throat,
fever, and fatigue. On examination, she has an exudative pharyngitis,
bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and an enlarged spleen. Which of
the following statements is most likely to be accurate?
A. There is a high likelihood that monospot testing will be positive.
B. She may return to playing for the school basketball team when her
fever has resolved.
C. If not given antibiotics, she is at risk for developing rheumatic
heart disease.
D. A complete blood count (CBC) is likely to show atypical neutrophils.

ANSWERS
19.1

A. This patient has an upper respiratory infection that is most likely
viral. The color of her sputum does not necessarily indicate the presence of a bacterial infection. The absence of signs of consolidation
on her pulmonary examination makes pneumonia unlikely. That her
child has a similar illness also makes a contagious, viral infection
more likely.

19.2

C. This patient has symptoms suggestive of “swimmer’s ear,” otitis
externa, probably caused by P aeruginosa. The most common examination finding consistent with this is an inflamed external auditory
canal. Other findings might be pain with movement of the external
ear and exudates in the auditory canal.

19.3

A. Her symptoms and examination findings are consistent with infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein-Barr virus. This infection often
results in the finding of atypical lymphocytes (not neutrophils) on a
CBC. As she has splenomegaly, she should be restricted from a sport,
such as basketball, until her spleen is no longer palpable. Mononucleosis
is a self-limiting disease.

CLINICAL CASES

207

Clinical Pearls
➤ The main concerns with pharyngitis are to rule out more serious conditions, such as epiglottitis or peritonsillar abscess, and to diagnose group A
β-hemolytic streptococcal infections.
➤ Hepatosplenomegaly can be found in infectious mononucleosis infection.
➤ A tonsillopharyngeal exudate does not differentiate viral and bacterial
causes.
➤ Tonsillopharyngeal/palatal petechiae are seen in GAS infections and infectious mononucleosis.

Case 20
A 56-year-old man is brought to the emergency department complaining of chest discomfort for about 90 minutes. He has had occasional
symptoms for a month, but it is worse today. Today’s symptoms began
while he was walking his dog and decreased slightly with rest, but have
not resolved. He describes the feeling as a pressure sensation in the left
substernal area of his chest associated with shortness of breath and mild
diaphoresis. He does not have any radiation of the discomfort today, but
has experienced radiation to the left upper extremity in the past. The
patient denies any health problems, but his wife reports that he has not
seen a physician in years. His wife made him come in because his
younger brother had a heart attack 6 months ago. He is a vice president
of a bank and lives with his wife and three daughters. He has smoked
11/2 packs of cigarettes per day for more than 30 years and denies drinking alcohol or any drug use.
On physical examination he is an anxious, obese gentleman who
appears pale and has a moist brow. His temperature is 98.8°F (37.1°C),
his pulse is 105 beats/min, his respirations is 18 breaths/min, his blood
pressure is 190/95 mm Hg, his height is 74 in, and his weight is 250 lb.
Cardiac examination reveals regular rhythm without murmur, but he
has an S4 gallop. Lungs are clear to auscultation. Neck is without carotid
bruits or jugular venous distension. Abdomen is normal. He does have a
right femoral bruit. Extremities reveal trace edema but no clubbing or
cyanosis. He has 2+ pulses in radial and dorsal pedalis arteries. Rectal
examination has no masses or tenderness with a normal prostate, and is
guaiac negative.

ANSWERS TO CASE 20:
Chest Pain
Summary: A 56-year-old obese man presents to the emergency department
with chest discomfort. He has a pressure sensation in the left substernal area
of his chest associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. His symptoms
began with minimal exertion. The patient is without prior medical care. He
has a family history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and a history of tobacco
abuse. He is hypertensive and tachycardic. He has a cardiac gallop. Lower
extremities have trace edema and a femoral bruit.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Unstable angina pectoris; must rule out myocardial
infarction (MI).

➤

Next diagnostic step:
Initial studies in the emergency room: complete blood count (CBC), electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, prothrombin time (PT),
partial thromboplastin time (PTT), international normalized ratio (INR),
glucose, 12-lead electrocardiography (ECG), and chest x-ray (CXR); markers of myocardial damage including creatine kinase (CK) and MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), troponin T and troponin I to be done stat and every 6 to
10 hours for three cycles. Oxygen saturation must be monitored, as well.
Studies that can be performed later include: fasting lipids, liver function
tests, magnesium, homocysteine level, urine drug screen, urinalysis, and
myoglobin.

➤

Next step in therapy: MONA therapy: Morphine, Oxygen, Nitroglycerin,
Aspirin
Morphine can achieve adequate analgesia which decreases levels of circulating catecholamines, thus reducing myocardial oxygen consumption. It
must be initiated rapidly if nitroglycerin cannot alleviate the discomfort.
Oxygen 2 to 4 L/min by nasal cannula; may be discontinued after 6 hours
if oxygen saturation remains normal without other complications.
Nitroglycerin must be given sublingually initially every 5 minutes for a
total of three doses (in the absence of hypotension or contraindications
such as sildenafil [Viagra] use), then advanced to IV or transdermal routes.
Aspirin 325 mg should be chewed and swallowed (clopidogrel [Plavix] if
allergy to aspirin exists).
β-Adrenergic antagonist reduces myocardial damage and may limit
infarct size.
Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors reduce end point of death or recurrent ischemia when given in addition to standard therapy for patients
with high risk unstable angina or non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction
treated with percutaneous coronary intervention, or who are refractory to
prior treatment.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand a diagnostic approach to chest pain and how to reduce potential damage to myocardium by implementing rapid evaluation.
2. Know the acute evaluation of chest pain and how to best implement the
primary and secondary treatment of chest pain.
3. Identify the risks and the need to educate patients to reduce their risks.
4. Be familiar with the differential diagnosis of chest pain and how to best
rule in and out the more life-threatening problems.

Considerations
This 56-year-old man has unstable angina with a variety of risk factors for
CAD. All patients who present to primary care physicians with chest pain are
immediate challenges. Most resources emphasize the life-threatening etiologies; however, the non–life-threatening etiologies are far more common in
presentation. Physicians must master a cost-effective approach to diagnosing
the various etiologies of chest pain, determining which patients warrant further evaluation, putting a large emphasis on thorough history and physical
examination. The cause of this patient’s symptoms must be determined as
soon as possible. If the etiology is determined to be cardiac, there are medications and interventions that can dramatically reduce both morbidity and mortality. A complete history and physical examination can give information that
can guide if and when other more expensive and invasive tests are necessary. The patient’s most immediate problem is his acute symptoms. His anxiety
will decrease slightly when he perceives that he is getting adequate care and
information.
Nearly 11/2 million people in the United States experience a myocardial
infarction each year. This is fatal approximately one-third of the time. However,
there has been a continuous decline in the mortality rate over the past 3 decades
because of a better understanding of the etiology and pathophysiology of
myocardial infarction, and because of advances in therapeutic treatments.
The first priority is to obtain ECG and CXR, while giving medications to
decrease the damage caused to his myocardium and simultaneously reducing
his blood pressure. Nitroglycerin and β-adrenergic antagonists will begin
achieving these goals. He will need constant monitoring and continuous
telemetry. Oxygen needs to be continued as well. Before the ECG and CXR
have been completed, aspirin, oxygen, nitroglycerin, morphine, and β-adrenergic
antagonist should be given. The providers must assume cardiac etiology until
it has been effectively ruled out to limit possible morbidity and mortality to the
patient.
The labs previously listed need to be drawn, at which time IV access can
be started in two places. The results of the tests will determine if the patient

212

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

has other risk factors in addition to his known hypertension, family history of
CAD, tobacco abuse, and obesity. If he routinely walks his dog, his lifestyle
contains at least minimal physical activity.
The changes seen in an ECG that are indicative of angina include ST-segment
elevation or depression and/or T-wave inversion. Myocardial infarctions
include these changes plus elevated CK-MB and/or troponin levels. Pathologic
Q waves may also indicate cardiac pathology, but typically represent myocardial tissue necrosis from a completed infarction. When Q waves are present,
the benefits of thrombolytic therapy are uncertain. Not all myocardial infarctions will have ECG changes. A normal ECG reduces the likelihood of myocardial infarction but does not rule out cardiac pathology. Any person with symptoms
of angina who has a left bundle branch block (LBBB) on ECG must have serum
cardiac enzymes drawn, because there is a high degree of correlation between LBBB
and organic heart disease, especially CAD. LBBB can mask signs of myocardial
pathology, as it can mimic both acute and chronic ischemic changes. All of
the listed ECG changes have a differential diagnosis that includes myocardial
infarction. The clinical picture is of utmost importance, again demonstrating the
need for complete history and physical examination.

APPROACH TO

UNSTABLE ANGINA: Angina of new onset, angina at rest or with minimal
exertion, or a crescendo pattern of angina with episodes of increasing frequency,
severity, or duration.

CLINICAL CASES

213

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Atherosclerosis leading to plaque rupture and then cascading to coronary
artery thrombosis is the cause of an acute MI approximately 90% of the time,
but many different conditions can be the culprit for angina. Coronary artery
spasm, including cocaine-induced injury, can cause angina. Aortic dissection
extending into a coronary artery will cause extensive damage. An embolus to
a coronary artery can be caused by endocarditis, prosthetic heart valves, or
myxoma. Embolism can also cause cerebral vascular accidents, increasing the
extent of the initial evaluation that is warranted.
Chest pain or discomfort is one the most common complaints in both the
outpatient and emergency setting. Determining the cause of such symptoms
in a rapid fashion is of utmost importance. If the patient is experiencing
myocardial ischemia or infarction, time is myocardium. Initial evaluation
should be done within 10 minutes of presentation. Ischemic heart disease
remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States.

TREATMENT
Primary Treatment
All patients who rule in for myocardial infarction should receive aspirin
and an antithrombotic treatment, if there are no contraindications. Aspirin
and heparin reduce the risk of subsequent MI and cardiac death in patients
with unstable angina. Studies present different recommendations for using
clopidogrel in addition to aspirin and heparin. Current American College of
Cardiology/American Heart Association recommendations advise withholding clopidogrel for 5 to 7 days before planned bypass surgery. It is reasonable
to give clopidogrel 300 mg orally to patients with suspected acute coronary
syndrome (ACS) (without ECG or cardiac marker changes) who are either
allergic to or have gastrointestinal intolerance of aspirin.
Heparin usually should be continued for 48 hours or until angiography is
performed. Patients suffering from unstable angina with ECG changes should
also be given platelet glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors because the
composite risk of death, myocardial infarction, and recurrent ischemia is significantly reduced with these medications.
Nitroglycerin is best given IV initially because of the ability to achieve
predictable blood levels rapidly. Once stabilized after 24 hours, the asymptomatic patient should be switched to a long-acting oral or transdermal nitrate.
A β-adrenergic antagonist should also be given, unless contraindicated. The
combination of nitroglycerin and β-adrenergic antagonist reduces the risk

214

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

of subsequent myocardial infarction. β-Adrenergic antagonists decreased
mortality and reduced infarct size in many clinical trials.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce short-term
mortality when started within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction.
Postinfarction ACE inhibitors prevent left ventricular remodeling and recurrent ischemic events. It is reasonable to recommend their indefinite use in the
absence of any contraindications. All trials with oral ACE inhibitors have
shown benefit from their early use, including those in which early entry criteria
included clinical suspicion of acute infarctions. Magnesium sulfate should be given
if levels are low, as hypomagnesemia can increase the incidence of torsade de
pointes-type ventricular tachycardia.
Despite the widespread use of calcium channel blockers both during and
after myocardial ischemia, no evidence exists supporting any benefit when
taking these medications. Rapid release, short-acting dihydropyridines (eg,
nifedipine) are contraindicated because they increased mortality in multiple
trials.
Patients who are asymptomatic after 48 hours of drug therapy can perform
a modified Bruce protocol stress test. Patients who have a markedly positive
stress test should be referred for angiography. There is some debate concerning when angiography should be done. One approach shows that an early
invasive approach with angiography within 24 to 48 hours is beneficial, whereas
others recommend a more conservative approach, doing angiography only if
recurrent ischemia is present or a positive stress test is done. There is no clear
consensus as to which approach is superior.
All patients admitted for angina or myocardial infarction should receive a
reduced saturated fat and cholesterol diet. These patients may benefit from
nutrition counselors to help them develop healthy lifestyle changes.

Secondary Treatment
Primary prevention of CAD must be encouraged for all patients. Risk factors
for CAD include diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, age, hypertension, tobacco
abuse, family history of premature CAD, male gender, postmenopausal status,
left ventricular hypertrophy, and homocystinemia (Table 20–1). Modification
of these risk factors has a direct link to reduce morbidity and mortality. Patient
education is particularly important.
Aspirin, nitrates, and β-adrenergic antagonist have proven benefits for
both primary and secondary treatment. Prolonged treatment with aspirin
reduces risks for both CAD and cerebrovascular disease. β-Adrenergic antagonist reduces first-year mortality. If no adverse affects are experienced, patients
should continue β-adrenergic antagonist 2 to 3 years or longer. Long-acting
nitrates can treat angina symptoms.
Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase
inhibitors (statins) have documented a consistent decrease in the incidence
of major adverse cardiovascular events when given within a few days after

onset of ACS. There are few data on patients treated within 24 hours of the
onset of symptoms. It is safe and feasible to start statin therapy early (within
24 hours) in patients; once started, continue statin therapy uninterrupted.
The goal level for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in anyone with
a history of CAD and high risk for future cardiac events is less than 70 mg/dL.
Hypertension must be treated using agents that reduce cardiac complications, as previously discussed. If further reduction is necessary, many medications treat hypertension and angina. Blood pressure and coronary pathology
have a linear relationship; as blood pressure is reduced, the risk, morbidity,
and mortality of cardiac disease are also reduced. Agents used often depend
on a patient’s comorbid conditions.
Physical activity is an important component of lifestyle change.
Recommendation of a minimum goal of 30 minutes of exercise on most days
should be given to all patients. Weight management is also encouraged, but
often requires numerous interventions. A minimum of a 5% reduction in
weight will provide benefits to the patient. Body mass index needs to become
part of the vital signs examined every visit.

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
The history should focus on onset and evolution of the chest pain. The cardinal features of all chief complaints should be followed, paying attention to
patient’s description of the pain/discomfort, location, radiation of pain, quality of pain, quantity of pain, duration, associating factors, and aggravating
and/or alleviating factors (Table 20–2). Many people do not describe angina
as chest pain. It is more effective to ask the patient to describe the discomfort. Some describe it as pressure, squeezing, crushing, or smothering. Some
may use a “Levine sign,” a fist held firmly against the chest. The discomfort is
usually central and substernal. It may radiate to the jaw, shoulder, arm, or
hand; usually to the left side. Cardiogenic nausea and vomiting are associated
with larger MIs.
The relationship of the symptoms to exertion is very important. Exertion,
emotional stress, or other situations that either increase myocardial oxygen
demand or decrease oxygen supply can increase symptoms. Angina usually
responds promptly to measures that reduce myocardial oxygen demand,
such as rest. Pain typically resolves in less than 5 minutes. If angina persists
for longer than 20 to 30 minutes, a myocardial infarction is more likely. In this
setting, hospitalization and further evaluation are warranted.
The targeted history in patients with angina needs to ascertain whether
the patient has had prior episodes of myocardial ischemia (stable or unstable
angina, MI, interventions such as bypass surgery or angioplasty). Evaluation
of the patient’s complaints should focus on chest discomfort, associated symptoms, gender and age-related differences in presentation, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, possibility of aortic dissection, risk of bleeding, and clinical
cerebrovascular disease (amaurosis fugax, face/limb weakness or clumsiness,
face/limb numbness or sensory loss, ataxia, or vertigo).
The physical examination needs to concentrate on evidence that supports
or disproves a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. General appearance and
vital signs can reveal much about the patient and the patient’s stability.
Hypertension, evidence of elevated lipids, changes consistent with diabetes
mellitus, and signs of peripheral vascular disease all increase the risk of CAD.
Funduscopic examination can show signs of chronic hypertension or diabetes mellitus. All blood vessels must be auscultated for bruits, a direct sign of
atherosclerotic disease. Diminished peripheral pulses are also a sign of atherosclerotic disease. Signs of heart failure include pulmonary edema, rales, jugular venous distension, and hepatojugular reflux. New gallops or murmurs can
signal myocardial ischemia. Shallow, painful breathing suggests chest pain
with a pleural cause. Asymmetric expansion of the chest with unilateral hyperresonance to percussion and diminished breath sounds are indicative of a possible
pneumothorax.
The cardiac examination requires careful evaluation. Unequal carotid pulses
or upper extremity pulses can indicate aortic dissection, but most patients with

dissection will not have pulse deficit. The murmur of aortic stenosis can be
significant, as aortic stenosis can present with angina, which can then lead to
syncope and heart failure.
The patient’s chest wall should be palpated. If this examination reproduces
the chest pain, costochondritis becomes more likely. Musculoskeletal causes of
chest pain are the most common etiology in an outpatient setting. Abdominal
examination is also important, as gastrointestinal etiology is the second most
common culprit for chest pain in an outpatient setting. Careful examination
of both upper quadrants and epigastric area must be done. The abdominal aorta
warrants careful examination.

with dyspnea. This pain increases with exertion. He is also a “nervous”
person and is prone to anxiety. An abnormality of which of the following is most specific for chest pain of cardiac etiology?
A. Chest radiograph
B. Serum lipid panel
C. 12 lead ECG
D. Pulse oximetry

20.3

Which of the following ECG changes makes the determination of acute
MI the most difficult?
A. Q wave
B. ST-segment elevation
C. Left bundle branch block
D. First-degree atrioventricular block
E. T-wave inversion

20.4

A 64-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and angina pectoris presents with chest pain for the last 3 hours. She describes the
pain as “sharp,” it is worse when she inhales deeply, and it is not
relieved by sublingual nitroglycerin. Her ECG shows ST elevation in
most leads. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis in this
patient?
A. Unstable angina pectoris
B. Myocardial infarction
C. Aortic dissection
D. Congestive heart failure
E. Pericarditis

ANSWERS
20.1

D. This patient has new onset of angina. Rapid release, short-acting
dihydropyridines (nifedipine) are contraindicated because they increased
mortality in multiple trials. Beta-blocking agents are the agents of choice
since they increase survival; nitroglycerin helps to abate chest pain, but
have not been shown to impact survival.

20.2

C. The clinical history is the most significant single factor in identifying cardiac from other types of chest pain. The next best modality is the 12 lead ECG.

20.3

C. The changes of left bundle branch block make the determination
of an acute MI by an ECG extremely difficult. In these patients, it is
particularly important to obtain serum markers of myocardial damage.

220
20.4

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

E. This patient likely has pericarditis. The pain is described as sharp
in nature rather than dull, aching, pressure. The pain is exacerbated
by inspiration, and finally there is global ST-segment elevation noted
on the ECG.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Angina pectoris is the most frequent symptom of intermittent ischemia.
➤ Targeted history and physical examinations of patients with angina is vital
to expedite proper diagnosis and treatment of patients. The patient’s
description of their discomfort is key; history must be given attention
because it is the most important diagnostic factor.
➤ Physical examination may be normal in many patients with angina.
➤ Aspirin, nitrates, β-adrenergic antagonists, and statins are the backbone in
treatment and prevention of myocardial pathology, having proven benefit
for both primary and secondary treatment.
➤ Time is myocardium. Initial diagnosis and treatment must be done as soon
as possible.
➤ Be mindful of polypharmacy, as many drugs have side effects that can
exacerbate myocardial damage.

Case 21
A 46-year-old woman presents to the clinic for the first time, complaining of decreased urinary output for 5 months with a foamy appearance.
She also complains of swelling in both legs and nonbloody, nonbilious
emesis a few times a week. She was diagnosed with diabetes 10 years ago
and has been taking insulin for 2 years. She does not check her sugars
at home because she does not like to stick herself. When asked about
her diet she states that she eats the best she can for what she can afford
but often has very little appetite. The patient last saw her physician
8 months ago and insulin is her only medication. On examination, the
patient is an obese woman. Her temperature is 99°F (37.2°C), her heart
rate is 108 beats/min, her blood pressure is 198/105 mm Hg, her respiration is 19 breaths/min, and her oxygen saturation is 94% on room air.
A head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination reveals periorbital edema. Her skin is hyperpigmented on both lower extremities. Her
heart is tachycardic with an S1, S2, S4 gallop auscultated with no murmur or rub. When palpating the heart’s point of maximal impulse (PMI),
it is lateral to the left midclavicular line. There are vesicular breath sounds
in both lungs throughout. Her neck reveals no jugular venous distension
and there are no carotid bruits. Her abdomen is nontender, with no bruits
or masses palpated. The lower extremities reveal pitting pretibial edema
with a pit recovery time less than 40 seconds. Laboratory studies in your
office include a urinalysis showing hyaline casts, 3+ proteinuria, and glucose, but negative for ketones. Her hemoglobin is 10.9 g/dL and her
hematocrit is 32% with a mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 82.3 g/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 21:
Chronic Kidney Disease
Summary: This is a 46-year-old woman with chronic kidney disease (CKD).
She has a history of uncontrolled diabetes and currently has uncontrolled
hypertension. She presents with periorbital edema, long-standing lowerextremity edema, an S4 and displaced PMI, and central obesity. The urinalysis shows hyaline casts, 3+ proteinuria and glucose, negative ketones, and
hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL with an MCV of 82.3 g/dL.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Acute worsening of chronic kidney disease

➤

Next diagnostic step: Measurement of serum electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine; imaging of the kidneys

➤

Next step in therapy: Further history to identify and remove any offending
agents (such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]), and control of blood pressure and diabetes; may require dialysis if she develops complications such as pulmonary edema, severe hyperkalemia, or anuria

ANALYSIS

4.

Know the risks for developing CKD.
Learn to evaluate for CKD.
Be familiar with the management of CKD.
Recognize the complications associated with CKD.

Considerations
This 46-year-old patient presents with a concerning symptom of a decrease in
urination with a change in the appearance of the urine. The most immediate
concern is how often she is urinating and to what degree is she urinating less.
A significant reduction requires immediate evaluation of creatinine function
and volume status. Volume status is assessed by skin turgor, mucous membranes, specific gravity in the urinalysis, and orthostatic blood pressure, which
also measures heart rate in the lying, sitting, and standing positions. A low
volume status with an elevated creatinine requires that the patient be given
IV fluids to see if there can be any recovery of kidney function. The patient’s
uncontrolled diabetes and hypertension predispose her to kidney damage.
Another common offender is a patient with this history who is taking NSAIDs.
This will increase the patient’s already high risk of damage.

CLINICAL CASES

225

With chronic kidney failure, patients are often able to compensate for the
metabolic imbalances that occur such as hyper- or hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, elevated uric acid levels, and metabolic acidosis. Patients also experience hyperparathyroidism. Significantly elevated potassium levels require
treatment with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (Kayexalate), insulin with glucose, and retention enemas, depending on the degree of elevation. When the
patient is no longer compensating, there are symptoms of pulmonary edema,
which include shortness of breath, lower-extremity edema, jugular venous distension, and abnormal lung sounds (rales). This patient was compensating
and mostly demonstrated the result of a hypoalbuminemic state from the loss
of protein in the urine. She had lower-extremity edema with a long pit time
that reflected her low albumin state. Her occasional emesis reflects high levels
of urea and other toxins. Persistent emesis mandates treatment. Her normocytic anemia was the result of reduced erythropoietin from the kidneys. In this
setting, treatment with exogenous erythropoietin improves prognosis for cardiovascular mortality. The hyaline casts reflect the long-standing damage to
the kidneys.
Increasing the patient’s chance of improved kidney function requires glucose and blood pressure control, removing offenders such as NSAIDs and
diuretics (if allowable), maintaining normal volume status (which is difficult
with a low albumin state), and adding agents that both treat blood pressure
and improve kidney and cardiovascular function such as angiotensin-converting
enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). CKD itself
is a cardiovascular risk factor. Patients are more likely to die from cardiovascular disease than to develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring dialysis.
The patient’s gross proteinuria of 3+ reflects her high risk for cardiovascular
disease.

APPROACH TO
Chronic Kidney Disease
DEFINITIONS
CKD: A spectrum of processes associated with abnormal kidney function and
progressive decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
ESRD: The irreversible loss of kidney function such that the patient is permanently dependent on renal replacement therapy (dialysis or transplantation).
Also defined as a GFR of less than 15 mL/min.

226

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Chronic kidney disease is becoming more common in the United States. The
most common etiologies are diabetes, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.
Diabetic kidney disease occurs in 30% to 40% of type I diabetics, in 25% of
type II diabetics, and in 24% of hypertensive patients. Within the diabetic
patient population, 20% to 60% have hypertension. Many patients present at
a later stage of CKD and it is then difficult to determine the etiology.

Evaluation
The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) from the
National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommends both a serum creatinine
(Cr) to estimate GFR and random urinalysis for albuminuria in those groups
at risk for chronic kidney disease (CKD). The stage of CKD is based on GFR,
which can be estimated with a random Cr level calculated with one of two
commonly used equations:
Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation:
GFR (mL/min/1.73 m2) = 186 × (Scr)−1.54 × (age)−0.203 × (0.742, if woman) ×
(1.210, if black)
Cockcroft-Gault equation:
Ccr (mL/min) = ((140 − age) × weight/72 × Scr) × (0.85, if female)
(Scr = serum creatinine concentration; Ccr = creatinine clearance).
A normal GFR for a woman is between 100 and 120 mL/min. Stage 1 of
CKD correlates with a GFR more than 90 mL/min; stage 2 correlates with a
GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min; stage 3 correlates with a GFR of 30 to 59 mL/min;
stage 4 correlates with a GFR of 15 to 29 mL/min; and stage 5 correlates with
a GFR less than 15 mL/min or dialysis. The Cockcroft-Gault equation is preferred for older patients. A 24-hour urine collection is recommended for persons with extremes of age and weight, malnutrition, skeletal muscle disease,
paraplegia or quadriplegia, or a vegetarian diet.
The evaluation in all patients with CKD includes renal imaging and
microscopic evaluation of urine. Treatment may be more successful in patients
with normal-size kidneys. Small kidneys show irreversible disease. Asymmetry
suggests renovascular disease. Evidence of proteinuria or microalbuminuria
should be evaluated in all patients with CKD. If the urine dipstick does not
reveal gross proteinuria, a sample should be sent to evaluate for microalbumin.
A test is positive if there is more than 30 mg of microalbumin per gram Cr. It
is recommended in the case of less than 200 mg of protein per gram Cr that the
test be repeated yearly. Any patient with more than 200 mg of protein per gram
Cr will need diagnostic evaluation and treatment. The protein-to-creatinine

CLINICAL CASES

227

ratio in an early morning random urine sample may be used instead of a 24-hour
urine protein excretion.
Underlying causes may be ascertained through clinical presentation, symptomatology, and past medical and family history. Some common lab studies
include C3, C4, hepatitis panel, HIV test, protein and urine electrophoresis
for those patients older than age 40, hemoglobin A1c, fasting blood sugar, and
analysis of urine sediment. Renal biopsy is indicated in patients with unknown
etiology after history and lab evaluation, if parenchymal disease is suspected, or
if treatment or prognosis will be based on the biopsy.

Management
Managing CKD includes treatment of reversible causes. Hypovolemia, hypotension, infection leading to sepsis, and drugs that lower the GFR all reduce renal
perfusion. History and physical examination allow for this diagnosis, and a
trial of fluids may improve kidney function. Drugs such as NSAIDs, aminoglycosides at full strength, and radiographic contrast material can affect kidney
function. Urinary tract obstruction, commonly caused by prostate enlargement
in elderly men, is a potentially reversible cause.
Goals of treatment include a blood pressure less than 130/80 mm Hg and
a reduction of protein excretion to less than 500 to 1000 mg/d (or at least 60%
of the baseline value). KDOQI guidelines recommend starting with an ACE
inhibitor or an ARB, followed by a diuretic if the blood pressure goal is not
achieved. Additional medications are diltiazem, verapamil, or a β-blocker. If
the proteinuria goal continues to be unmet after achieving blood pressure
control, add either the ACE inhibitor or an ARB. Combining both an ACE
inhibitor and an ARB requires reevaluating the potassium and Cr 3 to 5 days
after initiation, because of its potential for worsening function. Nonproteinuric
renal disease strictly requires blood pressure control.
Other treatments may be beneficial in CKD. Dietary protein restrictions of
0.8 to 1.0 mg/kg/d may be beneficial. Hyperlipidemia should be treated with
a goal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of less than 100 mg/dL, and some say the
goal should be less than 70 mg/dL because CRF is a cardiovascular equivalent.
The volume overload associated with CRF responds well to sodium restriction
and loop diuretics. This lowers the intraglomerular pressure. Hyperkalemia
may be prevented by a low-potassium diet and avoiding drugs such as NSAIDs
and, sometimes, ACE inhibitors. Metabolic acidosis may be treated with
sodium bicarbonate, with a goal to maintain a concentration of 22 mEq/L.
Dietary phosphate restriction may limit the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in these patients.
When the GFR is below 25 to 30 mL/min, oral phosphate binders are usually required. Caution is used when treating hyperphosphatemia in stages 3 to
5 CKD. It is suggested that calcium intake not exceed 2000 mg/d, as this may
contribute to cardiovascular disease.

228

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The KDOQI guidelines suggest evaluation of anemia with a hemoglobin
less than 11 g/dL in premenopausal women and prepubertal patients, and less
than 12 g/dL in adult men and postmenopausal women. This should include
evaluation for nonrenal causes of anemia. Treating patients with CKD with
erythropoietin before they develop ESRD may reduce symptoms of anemia,
show cardiovascular improvement, and possibly decrease mortality. Ultimately,
the patient that is going toward ESRD must be identified and adequately prepared for renal replacement therapy. It is recommended that patients with a
creatinine more than 1.2 mg/dL in women and more than 1.5 mg/dL in men
be referred to a nephrologist for evaluation and recommendations.

and occasional chest pain for the past 2 months. Which of the following is the best medication to start the patient on at this time?
A. ACE inhibitor
B. β-Blocker
C. Oral nitrate
D. Thiazide diuretic

ANSWERS
21.1

B. The patient has CKD with volume overload as evidenced by
symptoms and physical examination. A simple first step is to do a
chest x-ray to confirm what you already suspect—pulmonary edema.
After initiating furosemide (Lasix), the chest x-ray may be repeated
to see to what degree the diuresis has improved the overload. Cardiac
workup is also indicated but would not be the first test done.

21.2

C. Optimal control of high blood pressure, acidosis, volume depletion, and cholesterol are all important to prevent worsening renal
function. Diabetes is a leading cause of end stage renal disease. Tight
glycemic control can prevent the microvascular complications of diabetes such as diabetic nephropathy, though it has not been shown to
decrease significantly the occurrence of macrovascular complications
of diabetes such as CAD or PVD. Treating secondary hyperparathyroidism prevents complications such as renal osteodystrophy. The
patient’s weight does not impact on renal function substantially.
Smoking has numerous health risks but does not tend to impact kidney function directly; nevertheless, its effect on cardiovascular system
may impact on the kidneys.

21.3

D. The patient has an enlarged prostate that has caused urinary
obstruction and potentially reversible renal failure, depending on at
which point the obstruction is resolved. Placing the Foley catheter
will usually allow for significant reversal of an elevated Cr. Following
catheter placement, the urine output needs to be carefully monitored
and the Cr repeated later. Another clue is the tense lower abdomen
that is caused by a very enlarged bladder. It is especially important to
rely on clinical examination skills in elderly patients who have lessthan-optimal communication skills as a consequence of dementia or
who have a history of stroke when evaluating for a cause.

A. ACE inhibitors would help in hypertension treatment and to protect renal function in this patient. Both diabetes and CKD are
known to be cardiovascular risk equivalents. Other factors, such as
uncontrolled blood pressure and cholesterol, add to the patient’s high
risk, which is why it is so important for all diabetics and CKD
patients to improve all modifiable risk factors. The goals become
much more stringent when looking at these two groups of patients.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Small kidneys on imaging usually reflect irreversible disease. Small kidneys
should rarely be biopsied, as the result of the biopsy usually will not alter
the treatment or prognosis of the condition.
➤ Calculation of the estimated GFR is an important process as, especially in
older persons, a seemingly normal serum creatinine could reflect a significant reduction in GFR.

Case 22
A 25-year-old woman presents to the office with a 1-week history of
vaginal discharge. She describes the discharge as being green-yellow in
color with a bad odor. She has never had this type of discharge in the
past. She complains of increased vaginal soreness and discharge after she
has intercourse. She denies any itching, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, or sweats. She is currently sexually active and is using
an intrauterine device (IUD) as her contraceptive method. She has
been with one male partner for the past 3 months and he has no symptoms. She does state that she first had intercourse at age 15 and has had
multiple sexual partners. She had a chlamydial infection 2 years ago that
was treated with oral antibiotics. Her last menstrual period was 2 weeks
ago and was normal. She also denies any recent antibiotic treatment.
On examination, she is afebrile, has normal vital signs, and appears to
be in no acute distress. Her general physical examination is normal. On
pelvic examination, she has normal external genitalia. She has a small
amount of frothy, homogenous green-gray discharge at the introitus.
The cervix has a “strawberry”-red appearance with a slight amount of
discharge noted in the os. The IUD string is in place. Chlamydia and
gonorrhea specimens are obtained from the os and a sample of the vaginal discharge is collected for microscopic evaluation. Bimanual examination shows no cervical motion tenderness, and a normal uterus and
adnexa.

ANSWERS TO CASE 22:
Vaginitis
Summary: A 25-year-old woman presents with a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. She has a greenish, frothy discharge and a “strawberry cervix” noted
on examination.
➤

Organism most likely to cause this infection: Trichomonas vaginalis.

➤

Expected microscopic examination findings: Motile, flagellated trichomonads, and many white blood cells.

➤

Recommended treatment: Metronidazole 2 g by mouth in a single dose for
both the patient and her sexual partner. Metronidazole 500 mg twice a day
for a week is an alternate regimen.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to differentiate among common presentations of vaginitis on the
basis of clinical information and laboratory testing.
2. Know the current guidelines for treatment of the various etiologies of
vaginitis.

Considerations
Women with vaginitis may present with a variety of symptoms, including
vaginal discharge, itching, odor, and dysuria. There are many potential causes
of vaginitis, including sexually transmitted pathogens and overgrowth of
organisms found in the normal vaginal flora. Common among the causes of
vaginitis are Candida albicans, Trichomonas vaginalis, and Gardnerella vaginalis.
Certain historical information may lead a clinician to suspect a specific
cause of vaginitis in a given patient. For example, a history of recent antibiotic use may predispose to a Candida vaginitis, as the antibiotic may alter the
normal vaginal flora and allow the overgrowth of a fungal organism. Women
with diabetes mellitus are also more predisposed to developing yeast infections. A history of multiple sexual partners may raise the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection, such as trichomoniasis.
The patient’s symptoms and signs may also suggest a specific organism as
the cause of her vaginitis. Fungal infections tend to have thick discharge and
cause significant pruritus. The discharge of bacterial vaginosis is often thinner

CLINICAL CASES

233

and patients complain of a “fishy” odor. Trichomonas produces a discharge that
is usually frothy and the patient’s cervix is frequently very erythematous.
The key test to determining the cause of vaginal discharge, which guides
the specific treatment, is microscopic examination of the discharge. A sample
of the discharge is examined both as a “wet mount” (ie, mixed with a small
amount of normal saline) and as a “KOH prep” (ie, mixed with a small
amount of 10% potassium hydroxide). On wet mount, the examiner can evaluate the normal epithelial cells and look for white blood cells, red blood cells,
clue cells, and motile trichomonads. The hyphae or pseudohyphae of Candida
are best seen on KOH prep.

APPROACH TO
Vaginal Infections
DEFINITIONS
BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS: Condition of excessive anaerobic bacteria in the
vagina, leading to a discharge that is alkaline.
CANDIDA VULVOVAGINITIS: Vaginal and/or vulvar infection caused by
Candida species, usually with heterogenous discharge and inflammation.
TRICHOMONAS VAGINITIS: Infection of the vagina caused by the protozoa
Trichomonas vaginalis, usually associated with a frothy green discharge and
intense inflammatory response.

CLINICAL APPROACH
ETIOLOGIES
Vulvovaginal Candidiasis
This infection is typically caused by C albicans, although other species are
occasionally identified. More than 75% of women have at least one episode
during their lifetime. The presenting symptom is a thick, whitish discharge
that has no odor and the patient complains of significant pruritus of the external and internal genitalia. On physical examination, the vaginal area can be
edematous with erythema present. The discharge has a pH between 4.0 and
5.0. The diagnosis is confirmed by wet mount or KOH preparation showing
budding yeast or pseudohyphae. Fungal cultures are not needed to confirm
the diagnosis, but they are useful if the infection recurs or is unresponsive to

234

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

treatment. Numerous treatment options are available for patients with vulvovaginal candidiasis, including over-the-counter and prescription medications.
Uncomplicated candidiasis can be treated effectively with short-term intravaginal preparations (creams or vaginal suppositories) or single-dose oral therapies
(fluconazole 150 mg). Treatment of complicated or recurrent infection should
begin with an intensive regimen for 10 to 14 days followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy to reduce the likelihood of recurrence. Treatment of sexual partners is not indicated unless symptomatic (eg, man partners with balanitis).

Trichomoniasis
This infection is caused by the protozoan T vaginalis and is classified as a sexually transmitted disease. The incubation period is 3 to 21 days after exposure.
Certain factors predispose to infection, such as multiple sexual partners,
pregnancy, and menopause. The presenting complaint is copious amounts of
a thin, frothy, green-yellow or gray malodorous vaginal discharge. Women can
also have vaginal soreness or dyspareunia. Symptoms may start or be exacerbated during the time of their menses. Vaginal examination may reveal that
the cervix has a “strawberry” appearance (red and inflamed with punctuations) or that redness of the vagina and perineum is present. Microscopically,
the wet mount preparation can demonstrate motile trichomonads, although
cultures may be necessary because of the significant number of false-negative
results. The recommended treatment for trichomoniasis is oral metronidazole,
given in a single, 2-g oral dose or 1-week regimen of 500 mg twice a day to
both the patient and her sexual partner. It is important to screen for other
sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and to remember to treat the partner
to ensure better cure rates.

Bacterial Vaginosis
Bacterial vaginosis (BV) arises when normal vaginal bacteria are replaced
with an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria and G vaginalis. Although not an
STD, it is associated with having multiple sexual partners. Diagnosis can be
based on the presence of three of four clinical criteria: (1) a thin, homogenous vaginal discharge; (2) a vaginal pH more than 4.5; (3) a positive KOH
“whiff” test (a fishy odor present after the addition of 10% KOH to a sample
of the discharge); and (4) the presence of clue cells in a wet mount preparation (Figure 22–1). Culture is generally not needed. Treatment options
include both oral and topical vaginal preparations of metronidazole or clindamycin. There are no advantages to any of these regimens with regard to
cure rates or recurrence, although patients do report more satisfaction with
the vaginal preparations. Treatment of BV in asymptomatic pregnant women
may reduce the incidence of preterm delivery. Treatment of sexual partners
is not necessary and does not reduce the risk of recurrent infection.

Mucopurulent Cervicitis
This infection is characterized by purulent or mucopurulent discharge from
the endocervix, which may be associated with vaginal discharge and/or cervical bleeding. The diagnostic evaluation should include testing for Chlamydia
trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, although the etiologic agent is not always
found. Absence of symptoms should not prevent additional evaluation and
treatment, as approximately 50% of gonococcal infections and 70% of chlamydial infections are asymptomatic in women. The gold standard for establishing

236

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

the diagnosis is a culture of the cervical discharge. Empiric treatment should be
considered in areas of high prevalence of infection or if follow-up is unlikely.
The treatment recommendation for gonorrhea is ceftriaxone 125 mg intramuscularly. Because of the growing problem of antibiotic resistance, quinolone
antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin) are no longer recommended for treatment
of gonorrhea. The recommended treatment for Chlamydia infections is doxycycline 100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days or azithromycin in a single 1-g oral dose
when compliance is a concern. Typical treatment regimens will cover for both
gonorrhea and chlamydia and the treatment of sexual partners is advised.

Pelvic Inflammatory Disease
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is defined as inflammation of the upper
genital tract, including pelvic peritonitis, endometritis, salpingitis, and
tuboovarian abscess caused by infection with gonorrhea, Chlamydia, or vaginal and bowel flora. Lower abdominal tenderness with both adnexal and cervical motion tenderness without other explanation of illness is enough to
diagnose PID. Other criteria that enhance the specificity of the diagnosis
include temperature more than 101°F, abnormal cervical or vaginal discharge,
elevated sedimentation rate, elevated C-reactive protein, and cervical infection
with gonorrhea or Chlamydia. Definitive diagnosis rests on techniques that are
not generally used or readily available to make the diagnosis, such as laparoscopic findings consistent with PID, endometrial biopsy showing endometritis,
and ultrasound examination findings showing thickened fluid-filled tubes
with or without free pelvic fluid or tuboovarian complex. Because of the clinical similarity between PID and ectopic pregnancy, a serum pregnancy test
should be performed on all patients suspected of having PID.
Determination of appropriate treatment should consider pregnancy status,
severity of illness, and compliance. Less-severe disease can generally be
treated on an outpatient basis. Women who are pregnant, have HIV, or have
severe disease generally require inpatient therapy and treatment with parenteral antibiotics. Table 22–1 lists PID treatment regimens.
Patients who have PID need to be aware of potential complications, including the potential for recurrence of disease, the development of tuboovarian
abscess, chronic abdominal pain, infertility, and the increased risk of ectopic
pregnancy. It is important to discuss these potential problems with patients
who are given a diagnosis of PID. All patients with STDs or who are at risk
for developing STDs should be counseled on safer sexual practices, including
abstinence, monogamy, and the use of latex condoms.

A 24-year-old woman is noted to have lower abdominal tenderness,
cervical motion tenderness, and a vaginal discharge. She has a low
grade fever of 100.5°F (38.0°C). Which of the following is the best
therapy for her condition?
A. Ceftriaxone intramuscularly and doxycycline orally
B. Ampicillin orally and azithromycin orally
C. Metronidazole orally as a single dose
D. Ciprofloxacin orally as a single dose

ANSWERS
22.1

B. This discharge of homogenous and fishy odor is most likely bacterial vaginosis associated with an alkaline pH. Partner treatment
is not necessary for bacterial vaginosis. Oral metronidazole is one
treatment.

22.2

C. This patient most likely has candida vulvovaginitis, since her discharge appeared after her cystitis, likely treated with antibiotics.
A treatment for candida vulvovaginitis includes fluconazole or topical
azole agents such as miconazole.

22.3

A. An option for outpatient therapy of salpingitis (PID) is IM ceftriaxone and oral doxycycline. Oral metronidazole as a single dose is
a treatment for trichomonas vaginitis.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Remember to treat sexual partners when you diagnose a sexually transmitted infection and consider testing for infections that may initially be
asymptomatic, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, and syphilis.
➤ Single-dose therapy is available for many types of infections, including
Trichomonas, gonococcal and chlamydial cervicitis, and candida vaginitis.
Providing single-dose therapy in your office will improve your patient’s
compliance, as well as rates of successful treatment.

Case 23
A 62-year-old man presents to your office for a routine evaluation. His
only complaint is of fatigue over the past 2 to 3 months despite no
changes in diet or lifestyle. On questioning, the patient reports that he
has never smoked and admits to an increase in his consumption of alcohol upon retiring, to about two to three beers per day. He has occasional
headaches on the day after a night of heavier drinking, which are easily
relieved by the use of over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) preparations. While talking to the patient and examining his chart you note no distress and proceed with your examination.
You note a 4 lb weight loss since his last visit 6 months ago and a relative
increase in his pulse with a blood pressure of 129/81 mm Hg. Remarkable
to this visit is the paleness of his conjunctivae, but the rest of his general
examination is unchanged from the previous examination. You perform
a digital rectal examination and find a smooth, normal-size prostate and
some soft, reducible protrusions within the internal sphincter, along with
guaiac-positive stools. You decide on a more direct approach and delve into
his drinking, bowel habits, and NSAID use. His only addition is the occasional production of bloody stools accompanied by some diffuse abdominal
discomfort.

ANSWERS TO CASE 23:
Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding
Summary: A 62-year-old man presents to your office for a routine checkup. He
reports having occasional bloody stools and you discover guaiac-positive
stools. He is a bit pale, but hemodynamically stable at the moment. You
decide that further evaluation of this bleeding is necessary, but most of it can
be carried out on an outpatient basis with close follow-up.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Hemorrhoids.

➤

Next diagnostic step: Complete blood count (CBC) and colonoscopy.

➤

Next step in therapy: Discontinue NSAID use and decrease alcohol
consumption.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know how to recognize the subtle signs and symptoms of lower GI bleeding.
2. Understand the etiologies of lower GI bleeding.
3. Understand how to correctly evaluate and treat patients with lower GI
bleeding in outpatient settings.

Considerations
This 62-year-old man presented to your office for a routine examination but
was found to have some type of lower gastrointestinal bleeding that needs further evaluation. During his office visit there are no signs of hemodynamic
instability or active bleeding that require immediate referral to an emergency
room or inpatient treatment, so you decide on close outpatient follow-up during his workup. His immediate identifiable and modifiable risk factors for GI
bleeding include the regular consumption of alcohol and NSAIDs. You counsel him on both these matters and send him to the lab for a CBC, chemistry
panel, liver function tests, and coagulation profile prior to his discharge home
from your office. Barring any abnormal lab values that require emergent management, you schedule him for an outpatient colonoscopy later in the week.
Your differential diagnosis at this time is wide but you start to consider the
most frequent offenders in his age group, which include diverticular disease,
hemorrhoids, tumors, and ulcerative colitis. For the time being, you modify
those factors that may contribute to any of these etiologies and await the
results of his laboratory tests.

241

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Lower Gastrointestinal Bleeding
DEFINITIONS
HEMATOCHEZIA: Bright red blood visible in the stool.
LOWER GI BLEEDING: Bleeding that comes from a source distal to the lig-

ament of Treitz.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The manifestations of GI bleeding depend on the source, rate of bleeding,
and underlying or coexisting disease. An older patient, or someone with significant comorbidities, such as coronary artery disease, would be at a higher
risk of presenting in shock. A younger, healthier individual may present with
symptoms such as fatigue or dyspnea on exertion, or may complain directly of
seeing blood in the stool. Signs and symptoms of anemia are common and
include weakness, easy fatigability, pallor of the conjunctivae or skin, chest
pain, dizziness, tachycardia, hypotension, and orthostasis.
A history of blood in the stool or finding guaiac-positive stool on examination should prompt further evaluation to determine the source of the bleeding.
Depending on a patient’s history and hemodynamic status, more immediate
and invasive measures may be necessary once GI bleeding is identified. For
example, hematochezia is usually pathognomonic of lower GI bleeding, but
can also be found in patients with heavy upper GI bleeding. In this setting,
a nasogastric aspirate may help differentiate this small subset of patients.
Evaluation of the “ABCs” (airway, breathing, and circulation) is critical in
unstable patients who present with GI bleeding. ICU admission should not be
delayed in those with severe bleeding and a team approach, consisting of a gastroenterologist, a surgeon with expertise in GI surgery, and skilled nursing,
should always be anticipated. Major causes of morbidity and mortality in
patients with GI bleeding include blood aspiration and shock. To prevent
these complications, endotracheal intubation should always be considered to
protect the airway of patients with altered mental status. Most lower GI bleeding does not warrant emergency therapy, but be prepared for decompensation
in the elderly and in those with borderline normal hemodynamic parameters.

Diagnosis
The test of choice for the determination of the source of lower GI bleeding is colonoscopy. Adequate bowel preparation with an oral sulfate purge to
clear the bowel of blood, clots, and stool increases the yield in diagnosing
colonic bleeding sites. Angiography and technetium-labeled colloid or red

242

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

blood cell scans may be of value if colonoscopy cannot be performed or if
heavy bleeding prevents adequate visualization of the colon. However, the
magnitude of bleeding required to show the bleeding site limits their usefulness. Sigmoidoscopy with air-contrast barium enema x-rays may be an alternative when colonoscopy is unavailable or if the patient refuses colonoscopy.
If the initial sigmoidoscopy is negative, a colonoscopy must be performed. If
both of these studies are negative, panendoscopy should be carried out.
Always consider the possibility of upper GI bleeding as a source of hematochezia. An aspirate from a nasogastric tube can help to make this determination. An aspirate that shows bile but not blood will help to confirm that
the bleeding is from a lower GI source.

ETIOLOGIES
Hemorrhoids
Hemorrhoids are dilated veins in the hemorrhoidal plexus of the anus. They
are defined as “internal” if they arise above the dentate line and “external” if
they arise below the dentate line; both can be the cause of hematochezia.
Chronic constipation, straining for bowel movements, pregnancy, and prolonged sitting (eg, truck drivers) are risk factors. Along with bleeding, external
hemorrhoids can cause pain, irritation, and a palpable lump. Internal hemorrhoids can cause bleeding and can prolapse through the anus. Conservative
treatment with a high-fiber diet, stool softeners, and precautions against prolonged straining are usually successful. When necessary, various surgical procedures can be performed for definitive treatment.

Diverticular Disease
Diverticula are outpouchings of the colonic mucosa through weakened areas of
the colon wall. They occur most often where blood vessels penetrate through
the muscles of the colon. They are most often asymptomatic and found on
endoscopy or bowel imaging studies. They can cause symptomatic, and occasionally massive, bleeding that is usually painless. Diverticular bleeding usually
stops spontaneously. When the bleeding is extremely heavy or fails to stop, surgical resection of the affected portion of the colon may be necessary. Asymptomatic
diverticulosis is managed with dietary modification, primarily a high-fiber
diet.
Diverticulitis is a painful inflammation and infection of a diverticulum.
Diverticulitis frequently causes left lower quadrant abdominal pain along with
fever, nausea, diarrhea, and constipation. Perforation of a diverticulum resulting in peritonitis or intraabdominal abscess formation can be a complication.
Diverticulitis is typically treated with bowel rest and antibiotics effective
against gut flora. A combination of a quinolone and an agent for anaerobic

CLINICAL CASES

243

organisms, such as metronidazole, is one commonly used regimen. In severe
cases, recurrent cases, or when perforation occurs, surgery may be indicated.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease
Ulcerative colitis and Crohn disease are the two primary diagnoses considered
in the category of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis causes
continuous inflammation of the large bowel, starting from the rectum and
extending proximally. Severe disease can cause pancolitis, affecting the entire
colon. Crohn disease causes areas of focal inflammation, but can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Both diseases can cause recurrent episodes
of abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, rectal bleeding, fistulas, and abscesses.
The definitive etiology of IBD is not known, but these are autoimmune syndromes and a family history of IBD is a major risk factor. Along with GI symptoms, numerous extraintestinal manifestations may occur, most frequently
arthritis. Other extraintestinal manifestations include sclerosing cholangitis, cirrhosis, fatty liver, pyoderma gangrenosum, and erythema nodosum. Ulcerative
colitis is a significant risk factor for the development of colon cancer. Patients
with ulcerative colitis require frequent surveillance colonoscopic examinations. IBD can be managed with symptomatic therapy, such as antidiarrheal
medications, along with anti-inflammatory medications (aminosalicylates,
corticosteroids) given orally or as enemas, and immunosuppressive medications.
Ulcerative colitis can be definitively treated with a total colectomy, which is
usually reserved for severe pancolitis, failure to respond to medical therapy, or
because of the risk of colon cancer.

Colon Neoplasms
Polyps are benign neoplasms of the colon. Hyperplastic polyps tend to be
small, smooth growths found incidentally during endoscopy and are of no
prognostic significance. Adenomatous polyps are benign growths that have a
potential to become malignant. Listed in order of potential for becoming cancerous (from least to most), the three types of adenomas are tubular adenomas, tubulovillous adenomas, and villous adenomas. Larger polyps have a
higher risk of causing bleeding and becoming malignant than smaller polyps.
Polyps can be identified and removed during a colonoscopy.
Colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in men and
women. The risk of colon cancer increases with age, with a history of colon
polyps, a family history of colon cancer, or a personal history of ulcerative
colitis. Any patient older than age 50 years who has lower GI bleeding
must be evaluated for the presence of colon cancer. Because of the presence
of premalignant lesions (polyps) that can be identified and removed in asymptomatic patients, colon cancer screening is recommended for all adults older
than age 50, and at younger ages for those with increased risks. The treatment
and prognosis of colon cancer depends upon the stage in which it is found.

244

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The Dukes System stages colon cancer from A to D, depending on the penetration through the bowel wall layer, the presence of lymph node spread, and
distant metastases. Dukes A colon cancer has an excellent prognosis with surgical resection; Dukes D cancer is usually not curable and is treated with combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation.
Diverticular bleeding occurs in 10% to 20% of cases of lower GI bleeding,
with most cases being increased by NSAID or aspirin use. In diverticular disease, bleeding is often self-limited and ceases approximately 75% of the time,
while recurring at a rate of approximately 38%. More common causes include
hemorrhoids (59%), colorectal polyps (38%-52%), diverticulosis (34%-51%),
colorectal cancer (8%), ulcerative colitis, arteriovenous malformations, and
colonic strictures. These percentages vary amongst age groups and most serious causes are expected in the elderly.

23.1

D. The initial evaluation of this acutely ill patient is “ABC”—airway,
breathing, and circulation. As he appears to be in hypovolemic shock,
with tachycardia and hypotension, a bolus of a crystalloid fluid, such
as normal saline or lactated Ringer’s solution, is necessary before proceeding with any of the other evaluations.

C. Asymptomatic diverticuli are a common finding on screening
colonoscopies. The initial management of this is a high-fiber diet.
Diverticulosis by itself does not increase one’s risk of developing colon
cancer. Surgery is typically reserved for severe or recurrent symptomatic cases.

A. Ulcerative colitis causes continuous inflammation of the colon,
whereas Crohn disease causes patchy inflammation with skip areas.
Pseudomembranous colitis is a complication of Clostridium difficile
infection of the colon.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Lower GI bleeding is usually suspected in lesions or pathology that is distal to the angle of Treitz. Simple measures like nasogastric lavage can aid
in ruling out upper GI bleeding as a cause of hematochezia.
➤ In a patient with acute lower GI bleeding, consider performing colonoscopy.
Other diagnostic procedures that may be useful include radionuclide
imaging and mesenteric angiography.
➤ Any patient older than age 50 years should be screened for colon cancer.

Case 24
A 61-year-old woman presents to the emergency room complaining of
cough for 2 weeks. The cough is productive of green sputum and is associated with sweating, shaking chills, and fever up to 102°F (38.8°C).
She was exposed to her grandchildren who were told that they had
upper respiratory infections 2 weeks ago but now are fine. Her past medical history is significant for diabetes for 10 years, which is under good
control using oral hypoglycemics. She denies tobacco, alcohol, or drug
use. On examination, she looks ill and in distress, with continuous
coughing and chills. Her blood pressure is 100/80 mm Hg, her pulse is
110 beats/min, her temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), her respirations are
24 breaths/min, and her oxygen saturation is 97% on room air. Examination
of the head and neck is unremarkable. Her lungs have rhonchi and
decreased breath sounds, with dullness to percussion in bilateral bases.
Her heart is tachycardic but regular. Her extremities are without signs
of cyanosis or edema. The remainder of her examination is normal.
A complete blood count (CBC) shows a high white blood cell (WBC)
count of 17,000 cells/mm3, with a differential of 85% neutrophils and
20% lymphocytes. Her blood sugar is 120 mg/dL.

cough. She has an abnormal pulmonary examination and is found to have a
high white cell count. Her significant medical history is diabetes mellitus.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Community-acquired pneumonia.

➤

Next diagnostic step: Chest x-ray, sputum Gram stain and culture, and
blood cultures.

➤

Next therapeutic step: Determine whether the patient requires in-patient
or out-patient therapy and start antibiotics.

➤

Potential complications: Bacteremia, sepsis, parapneumonic pleural effusion, and empyema.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the differential diagnosis of pneumonia.
2. Be familiar with widely accepted decision-making strategies for the diagnosis and management of different kinds of pneumonia.
3. Learn about the treatment and follow-up of pneumonia.
4. Recognize the effects of comorbid conditions.

Considerations
This 61-year-old patient presents with a common diagnostic dilemma: productive cough with green sputum and fever. The first priority for the physician is to assess whether the patient is more ill than the complaint would
indicate. Helpful clues to the patient’s overall condition include a toxic
appearance, using accessory muscles to breathe, and low oxygen saturation.
Tachycardia, hypotension, and altered mentation are signs of more critical illness. Airway, breathing, and circulation must always be addressed.
Fortunately, this patient does not have those alarming symptoms. If a
patient has respiratory distress, the physician may need to check arterial blood
gases. If the patient has low oxygen saturation, give oxygen by nasal cannula
and then proceed to your history and physical examination.
The most common etiology of cough is an upper respiratory tract infection.
This patient has several features that make pneumonia more likely, including

CLINICAL CASES

249

her age, cough with green sputum, fever with chills, and exposure to close
contacts with respiratory infections. The gold standard for diagnosis of pneumonia is the presence of an infiltrate on chest x-ray, although normal x-ray
does not exclude the diagnosis. X-rays may be normal early in the course of
disease and a patient who is dehydrated may not demonstrate an infiltrate
until the patient is adequately rehydrated.

APPROACH TO
Pneumonia
DEFINITIONS
PNEUMONIA: Infection of lung parenchyma caused by agents that include
bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.
PNEUMONITIS: An inflammation of the lungs from a variety of noninfectious causes such as chemicals, blood, radiation, and autoimmune processes.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Bronchitis and pneumonia represent a continuum of lower respiratory infection. The extent of involvement of adjacent lung parenchyma determines
whether there is an infiltrate on x-ray. Pneumonia is defined as infection of
lung parenchyma caused by agents that include bacteria, viruses, fungi, and
parasites. It should be distinguished from pneumonitis, which is an inflammation of the lungs from a variety of noninfectious causes such as chemicals,
blood, radiation, and autoimmune processes. The occurrence and severity of
pneumonia depends on both the state of the body’s defense mechanism
against infection and the characteristics of the infectious agent. The most
common mechanism triggering pneumonia is upper airway colonization by
potentially pathogenic organisms that are subsequently aspirated. The type of
organism involved depends, in part, on host characteristics.

Community-Acquired Pneumonia
Pneumonia that occurs in persons who are not hospital in-patients or residents of long-term care facilities is defined as community acquired. The most
common bacterial cause of community-acquired pneumonia is Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumonococcus). Other common bacterial etiologies are Haemophilus
influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Pneumococcal pneumonia classically causes
an illness of acute onset with cough productive of rust-colored sputum, fever,

250

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

shaking chills, and a lobar infiltrate on chest x-ray. H influenzae is often seen
in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila
are bacteria that cause what is classified as “atypical” pneumonia. Atypical
pneumonia is also caused by several different viruses. The typical pneumonia
organisms are more common in the very young and in the older patient.
Atypical pneumonias occur more commonly in adolescent or young adult
patients. Atypical organisms tend to cause bilateral, diffuse infiltrates, rather
than focal, lobar infiltrates, on x-ray.

Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia
Hospital-acquired pneumonia is a major source of morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospitalization. Risk factors include intubation, nasogastric tube feeding, preexisting lung disease, and multisystem failure. The organisms involved
include the pathogens involved in community-acquired pneumonia as well as
aerobic gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas, Klebsiella, Acinetobacter) and grampositive cocci such as Staphylococcus aureus. The incidence of drug-resistant
organisms, such as methicillin-resistant S aureus, is increasing. Avoiding intubation when possible, using oropharyngeal intubation as opposed to nasopharyngeal intubation, keeping the head of the patient’s bed elevated during tube
feedings, and infection control techniques, such as careful hand washing and
use of alcohol-based hand disinfectants, can reduce risks.

Diagnosis
Patient history in pneumonia commonly includes the symptoms of productive
cough, fever, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. The symptoms can be very
nonspecific in the very old and very young. In young children, rapid breathing is commonly seen; in the elderly, pneumonia may present as altered mental
status.
Sometimes the history may lead to assistance in determining the specific
organism involved. An abrupt onset or abruptly worsening illness is seen frequently in pneumococcal pneumonia. Legionella often causes diarrhea along
with pneumonia. S aureus is a common cause of postinfluenza pneumonia.
Physical examination findings can include fever, tachycardia, tachypnea,
hypotension, and reduced oxygen saturation. Auscultation of the lungs may
reveal rhonchi or rales. Egophony (E to A change) can be a sign of focal lung
consolidation and dullness to percussion may be the result of a pulmonary
effusion.
All patients with suspected pneumonia should have a chest x-ray. The
presence of an infiltrate can confirm the diagnosis. Absence of an infiltrate
does not rule out pneumonia as a diagnosis. A chest x-ray can also identify a
pleural effusion, which may be a complication of pneumonia (parapneumonic
effusion).

CLINICAL CASES

251

Specific x-ray findings may also lead to consideration of certain etiologic
agents or types of pneumonia. As noted previously, lobar infiltrates are more
common with typical infections and diffuse infiltrates are more likely with
atypical infections. A bilateral, “ground glass”-appearing infiltrate is associated with Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as P carinii) infections, which
are seen most often in patients with AIDS. Apical consolidation may be seen
with tuberculosis. Pneumonia caused by the aspiration of gastrointestinal contents commonly is seen in the right lower lobe because of the branching of the
bronchial tree.
Other testing indicated in patients with pneumonia includes a complete
blood count (CBC) and a chemistry panel. Specific microbiologic diagnosis is
possible with blood or sputum cultures. Cultures have a low sensitivity
(many false negatives), but a positive culture can help to guide treatment.
Direct fluorescent antibody testing on sputum can be used to identify Legionella
and Mycoplasma; Legionella can also be identified by urinary antigen testing.

Treatment
When pneumonia is diagnosed, the initial decision to be made is can the
patient be treated safely as an outpatient or is hospitalization required. One
method of making this determination is to use the Pneumonia Severity
Index, which assigns patients to a risk category based on their age, comorbid illnesses, specific examination, and laboratory findings. High-risk comorbidities include neoplastic disease, liver disease, renal disease, congestive heart
failure, and diabetes. Physical examination findings taken into consideration
are tachypnea, fever, hypotension, tachycardia, and altered mental status.
Laboratory findings include a low pH, low serum sodium, low hematocrit, low
oxygen saturation, high glucose, high blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and pleural
effusion on x-ray. Based on the patient’s demographics and individual findings,
a risk class and mortality risk is assigned. Low-risk classes (classes 1 and 2) can
be safely treated as an outpatient; higher-risk classes (classes 3, 4, and 5) should
be hospitalized.
The emergence of drug-resistant pneumococci and the development of new
antimicrobials have changed the empiric treatment of community-acquired pneumonia. In healthy persons, a macrolide (clarithromycin or azithromycin) or doxycycline is recommended empiric therapy. In areas with high rates of macrolide
resistance, treatment with a newer fluoroquinolone (levofloxacin, moxifloxacin)
or the combination of a β-lactam plus a macrolide would be recommended.
For hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia who do not
require ICU treatment, an intravenous β-lactam (eg, cefuroxime, cefotaxime,
ceftriaxone, or ampicillin-sulbactam) and an intravenous macrolide (erythromycin or azithromycin) are recommended. An IV fluoroquinolone with activity against S pneumoniae can be substituted.
The follow-up visit to the office 3 to 4 days later will help to assess response
to therapy. Early follow-up chest x-rays are mandatory in those who fail to

252

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

show clinical improvement by 5 to 7 days, because bronchogenic carcinoma
can present with the picture of a typical pneumonitis.
Hospital-acquired pneumonias require broader antibiotic coverage of the
likely pathogens, many of which have developed multiple-drug resistance.
One regimen includes a β-lactam plus an antipseudomonal fluoroquinolone
or aminoglycoside. Methicillin-resistant S aureus may require treatment with
vancomycin.
The duration of the treatment is influenced by the severity of illness, the etiologic agent, response to therapy, the presence of other medical problems, and
complications. Therapy until the patient is afebrile for at least 72 hours is usually
sufficient for pneumonia caused by S pneumoniae. A minimum of 2 weeks of therapy is appropriate for pneumonia caused by S aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Klebsiella, anaerobes, M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, or Legionella species.

Complications
Bacteremia occurs in approximately 25% to 30% of patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. Mortality rates range for patients with bacteremia from
20% to 30%, but can be as high as 60% in the elderly. Parapneumonic pleural effusion develops in 40% of hospitalized patients with pneumococcal
pneumonia. Fewer than 5% of cases progress to empyema. If more than a minimal amount of fluid is present, as evidenced by significant blunting of the
costophrenic angle on x-ray, it may be necessary to perform a thoracentesis
with Gram stain and culture of the pleural fluid. The presence of an empyema
usually requires drainage with a chest tube or surgical procedure.

Prevention
Pneumococcal vaccine is recommended for all persons aged 65 years and
older, all adults with chronic cardiopulmonary diseases, and all immunocompromised persons. Consider revaccination every 5 years in patients known to
have a rapid decline in antibody titers, such as those with nephritic syndrome
or renal failure. Also consider repeating pneumococcal vaccination in asplenic
patients. Revaccination has minimal side effects; the most common is a localized reaction at the site of injection.
Influenza vaccination is recommended in the late fall and winter months
for populations at risk for infection, complications, or transmission of the
influenza virus. The association between influenza virus infection and pneumonia is well recognized. The number of cases of invasive pneumococcal disease
peaks in midwinter, when influenza is prevalent. Influenza virus infection can
facilitate bacterial colonization and impair host defense mechanism. A prospective study of patients 65 years of age and older demonstrated the effectiveness
of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination at reducing hospitalizations for
pneumonia and at preventing invasive pneumococcal disease.

Comprehension Questions
24.1

A 17-year-old adolescent male presents to the ER with a temperature of
101.0°F (38.3°C), a deep nonproductive cough, and generalized malaise
for 3 days. He doesn’t recall being around any particular sick contacts but
is around many people in his after-school job in sales and at school. He
states that he never had the chicken pox and is unaware of what immunizations he received as a child. He was diagnosed at age 12 with leukemia
but has since been healthy. He is worried that his cancer may no longer
be in remission. A chest x-ray reveals bilateral, diffuse infiltrates on chest
x-ray. Which of the following is the most likely cause of illness?
A. Pneumonia caused by S pneumonia
B. Pneumonia caused by P jiroveci
C. Pneumonia caused by Legionella pneumophila
D. Pneumonia caused by M pneumonia
E. Pneumonia caused by H influenza

24.2

A 35-year-old woman patient returns to clinic with a temperature of
104.0°F, night sweats, chills, shortness of breath, and cough productive of
yellowish-green sputum. She was seen 2 weeks ago for headache, fever of
102.0°F, nonproductive cough, and myalgias. She was prescribed a dose
of oseltamavir for 10 days. She felt better after taking the medication but
now feels she is getting worse. Which of the following is the best treatment for this patient?
A. 14-day trial of oseltamavir
B. Erythromycin
C. Penicillin
D. Cefuroxine
E. No treatment needed

24.3

A 76-year-old widowed man who lives alone presents to clinic with
increasing shortness of breath and chest pain at rest for the past 2 weeks.
He has had chronic hypertension and CAD for 20 years for which he
takes HCTZ, enalapril, and aspirin 81 mg daily. Other medical problems
include hyperlipidemia, peripheral vascular disease, and gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD) which are controlled by lovastatin, warfarin, and
omeprazole. Two years ago he suffered a cerebrovascular accident that
was localized to the brainstem. He now has dysphagia and is noted to
cough frequently at night. He has no cough at present and has not
been able to take his temperature at home. Which of the following is
the best next step?
A. Upper endoscopy
B. Removal of ACE inhibitor
C. Nitroglycerine patch
D. Chest radiograph

254

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

ANSWERS
24.1

D. Bilateral, diffuse infiltrates are more likely to be seen in patients
with pneumonia caused by atypical agents, such as Mycoplasma, than in
patients with typical pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia. Legionella,
another atypical pneumonia, is unlikely in this patient population and
the patient did not have diarrhea. It is more likely that the patient
contracted an atypical pneumonia than having a relapse of leukemia
with such profound immunodeficiency with no prior symptoms.

24.2

B. This patient is suffering from bacterial pneumonia caused by S Aureus
which is a common infection seen after influenza infection. Oseltamavir
is not needed because the cause of her illness is no longer viral. A 10-day
trial is what is often prescribed to patients. Streptococcus pneumonia
would be treated with penicillin. Pneumonia caused by bacterial hemophilus influenza would be treated with Cefuroxime. Erythromycin is the
drug of choice for pneumonias caused by Legionella or S Aureus.

24.3

D. This patient most likely has aspiration pneumonia. With impairment of the gag reflex after cerebrovascular accident (CVA), he is
more likely to aspirate during sleep, indicated by his cough. His
GERD is well controlled by medication so upper endoscopy is not
warranted at this time. Nitroglycerine patches may be indicated if he
described symptoms more related to angina. An ACE inhibitor
would cause a cough unrelated to time of day.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Elderly patients often have fewer or less-severe symptoms or atypical presentations of pneumonia. Consider pneumonia in the differential diagnosis of altered mental status in the elderly.
➤ Appropriate use of influenza and pneumococcal vaccination reduces the
risk of pneumonia in susceptible populations.
➤ Consider the diagnosis of empyema in patients with pneumonia and a
pleural effusion, especially if the patients continue to have fever despite
appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Case 25
A 38-year-old woman presents to the office with complaints of weight
loss, fatigue, and insomnia of 3-month duration. She reports that she has
been feeling gradually more tired and staying up late at night because
she can’t sleep. She does not feel that she is doing as well in her occupation as a secretary and states that she has trouble remembering things.
She does not go outdoors as much as she used to and cannot recall the
last time she went out with friends or enjoyed a social gathering. She
feels tired most of the week and states she feels that she wants to go to
sleep and frequently does not want to get out of bed. She denies any
recent medication, illicit drug, or alcohol use. She feels intense guilt
regarding past failed relationships because she perceives them as faults.
She states she has never thought of suicide, but has begun to feel increasingly worthless.
Her vital signs and general physical examination are normal, although
she becomes tearful while talking. Her mental status examination is significant for depressed mood, psychomotor retardation, and difficulty attending
to questions. Laboratory studies reveal a normal metabolic panel, normal

ANSWERS TO CASE 25:
Major Depression
Summary: This is a 38-year-old woman with depression. She meets at least
five of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition
(DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria during a 2-week period that represents a change
from her previous level of functioning. At least one of the symptoms must be
either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Major depression.

➤

Next step: Evaluate the patient for suicidal risk, begin pharmacologic and
psychotherapeutic management.

➤

Important considerations and potential complications: Rule out other
medical diagnoses such as hypothyroidism, anemia, and infectious processes
that could mimic some symptoms of depression; verify that no substance
abuse or use is taking place; screen for bipolar disorder and inquire about a
family history of mood disorders; investigate and address suicidal ideations;
review any recent medication changes for agents that may contribute to
these symptoms (eg, β-blockers, steroids, sedatives, chemotherapy agents).

APPROACH TO
Depression
DEFINITIONS
MAJOR DEPRESSION: One or more episodes of mood disorder each of which

lasts at least 2 weeks. The most prominent symptoms of major depressive disorder are depressed mood and loss of interest or pleasure. Insomnia and weight
loss often accompany major depression, but depressed patients may also have
weight gain and hypersomnia.

CLINICAL CASES

259

DYSTHYMIC DISORDER: A chronic depression of mood which does not

meet the criteria for major depression, in terms of either severity or duration
of individual episodes, yet the patient still has loss of interest, lack of appetite
or pleasure, and low energy.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Background
Depression has a lifetime prevalence of 15% to 25%, with a greater incidence
in women and the elderly. Symptoms for depression must include at least 5
of the 9 following symptoms, must occur during the same 2-week time period,
must represent a change from previous functioning, and must include either
depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.
8.
9.

Depressed mood
Diminished interest or pleasure
Significant weight loss or weight gain
Insomnia or hypersomnia
Psychomotor agitation or retardation
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness
Diminished ability to think or concentrate; indecisiveness
Recurrent thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, suicide attempt, or specific
plan

Also,
• Symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode (both mania and depres-

sive episode).
• Symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment of functioning.
• Symptoms are not a result of the direct physiologic effects of a substance

or a generalized medical condition.
• Symptoms are not accounted for by bereavement.

A patient with depression commonly presents to the physician with various somatic complaints and decreased energy level rather than a complaint of
depression. Patients often complain of sadness, sometimes of irritability or
mood swings. Difficulty concentrating or loss of energy and motivation are
common. Their thinking is often negative, frequently with feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, or helplessness. Poor memory or concentration may be a complaint in others. The elderly may present with confusion or a general decline in
functioning. The diagnosis of depression needs to be considered in scenarios
where a patient presents with multiple unrelated physical symptoms.
The differential diagnosis of depression includes many other psychiatric
and medical disorders. The psychiatric disorders include dysthymic disorder,

260

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

bereavement, and bipolar disorder. Numerous medical conditions can cause
depressive symptoms. Common among these are hypothyroidism and anemia.
The role of pharmacologic agents and substance use, abuse, or dependence
also should be investigated, as these can cause significant mood changes. This
is especially true of alcohol, sedatives, narcotics, and cocaine.

Pathophysiology
The etiology of depression is thought to be multifactorial, involving a complex interaction of genetic, psychosocial, and neurobiologic factors. Multiple
neurotransmitter systems are implicated, including the serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems. Evidence of the effects of neurotransmitters on mood disorders is supported by the knowledge of the mechanism of
action of antidepressant medications. All currently available antidepressant
agents appear to work by increasing the amount of neurotransmitter available
to the postsynaptic nerve. They accomplish this by (1) enhancing neurotransmitter release, (2) reducing neurotransmitter breakdown, or (3) inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitter by the presynaptic neuron.

Morbidity and Mortality
Depression causes significant morbidity and mortality in numerous ways.
Depression is frequently reported in persons with underlying medical conditions. It is a common occurrence following myocardial infarctions and cerebrovascular accidents. Persons with depression and preexisting cardiovascular
disease have a three and half times greater risk of dying of a heart attack than
do nondepressed patients. Studies also show that persons with depression
have a greater chance of developing or dying from cardiovascular disease,
even after controlling for traditional risk factors such as smoking, blood pressure, and lipid levels. Depression also contributes the disruption of interpersonal relationships, the development of substance abuse, and absenteeism
from work and school.
All depressed patients should be screened for suicidal and homicidal/violent
ideations. A history of suicide attempts or violence is a significant risk factor
for future attempts. Major depression plays a role in more than half of all suicide attempts. Women, especially those younger than age 30 years, attempt
suicide more frequently than men, but men are more likely to complete suicide. Firearms are the most commonly used method in completed suicides.
Table 25–1 lists the risk factors for suicide attempts and completed suicides.

Physical Findings
Most patients with depression have no significant physical abnormalities on
examination. Those who have more severe symptoms may reveal decline in
grooming or hygiene along with significant weight changes. Speech may be

normal, slow, monotonic, or lacking in content. Pressured speech is suggestive
of mania, whereas disorganized speech suggests the need to evaluate for psychosis. The thought content of patients with depression includes feelings of inadequacy, helplessness, or hopelessness. Sometimes patients complain of being
overwhelmed. Psychomotor retardation can manifest as slowing of movements
or reactions, especially in the elderly.

TREATMENT
Initial pharmacotherapy should be based on physician familiarity with medication, anticipated safety and tolerability, anticipation of adverse effects, and
history of prior treatments. Pharmacotherapy with psychotherapy is more
effective than either pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy alone. Treatment
should be geared toward doing both to improve chances of successful therapy.
Treatment failures typically result from medication noncompliance, inadequate
duration of therapy, or inadequate dosing. No class of medication has been proven
to be more effective than other classes. Patients treated for a first episode of major
depression should be treated for at least 6 to 9 months; recurrent depression needs
to be treated for longer periods of time. The need for lifelong therapy is higher
with increasing number of episodes of depression. All antidepressants carry
an FDA “Black Box” warning that they increase the risk of suicidal thoughts
and behaviors in children, adolescents, and young adults, especially in the
first months of treatment.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLASSES OF MEDICATIONS
Table 25–2 lists the medications used in the treatment of depression.

Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increase the amount of the
neurotransmitter serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) available to the postsynaptic neuron by blocking the presynaptic neuron’s ability to reuptake serotonin.
Because it can take 3 to 6 weeks of therapy before significant improvement in
mood occurs, dosage adjustments of these medications should occur no more
often than monthly. These agents have a low risk of toxicity if taken as an
overdose (either accidentally or intentionally), making them very safe to use.
Common side effects include sexual dysfunction, weight gain, gastrointestinal
disturbance, fatigue, and agitation. Because of their efficacy and safety, SSRIs
are frequently used as first-line agents for the treatment of depression.

Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) affect both the serotonergic and noradrenergic systems. They act primarily on the serotonergic
system at lower dosages and on the noradrenergic system at higher dosages.
Their side effects are similar to SSRIs. They can be used as first-line treatment
for depression and, because of their effects on two neurotransmitter systems,
may be used as second-line agents in SSRI failure.

Tricyclic Antidepressants
Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are older agents that affect, to varying
degrees, the reuptake of norepinephrine and serotonin. They are effective for
the treatment of depression and, because they have been in use for many
years, are inexpensive. However, they have numerous side effects, including
sedation, dry mouth, dry eyes, urinary retention, weight gain, and sexual disturbance. They also carry the risk that they are highly toxic and potentially
fatal in overdose. Because of the side effects and risks, TCAs have largely been
replaced by SSRIs as the first-line treatment of depression.

Monamine Oxidase Inhibitors
Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) cause increased amounts of serotonin
and norepinephrine to be released during nerve stimulation. Patients taking
MAOIs must be on a tyramine-restricted diet to reduce the risk of severe, and
sometimes fatal, hypertensive crisis. MAOIs also interact with numerous other
medications, including SSRIs and meperidine (Demerol). These interactions
can also be fatal. Because of the risks, MAOIs should only be used by experienced practitioners and only when the benefits outweigh the risks.

Atypical Agents
The different atypical agents may act similarly to SSRIs, TCAs, and MAOIs,
in varying degrees. Their primary benefit is a lower incidence of sexual disturbance as a side effect. Bupropion is associated with a risk of seizure at
higher doses and is contraindicated in patients with a history of seizure disorders. Trazodone carries the risk, although rare, of causing priapism. It is also
highly sedating and is frequently used as a sleep aid.

INPATIENT MANAGEMENT
Inpatient management is indicated when the patient presents a significant
risk to self (suicide, inability to care for self) or others (risk of violence), or
the symptoms are sufficiently severe to initiate treatment in controlled settings. Involvement of a psychiatrist is warranted in the care of patients in
whom more severe symptoms require more intensive care (suicidal ideations,
psychosis, mania, and severe decline in physical health).

OTHER MOOD DISORDERS
Anxiety Disorders
Anxiety disorders is a classification of mood disorders that are common in the
population such as panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),
generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and

264

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

phobia. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder have excessive and difficultto-control worry and anxiety that causes physical symptoms, including restlessness, irritability, sleep disturbance, and difficulty concentrating. Panic disorder
is characterized by recurrent panic attacks, which are defined as periods of intense
fear of abrupt onset. OCD manifests as either obsessions (recurrent, intrusive, and
inappropriate thoughts) or compulsions (repetitive behaviors) that are unreasonable, excessive, and cause much distress to the patient. PTSD is a response to a
severe traumatic event in which the patient suffers fear, helplessness, or horror.
A phobia is an irrational fear that causes a conscious avoidance of a situation,
subject, or activity. Patients with anxiety disorders are at high risk for developing comorbid depression.

Bereavement
Bereavement is defined as symptoms of a major depressive episode that occur
after the loss of a loved one. If the symptoms last longer than 2 months and
involve suicidal ideations, morbid preoccupations, or psychosis, then a diagnosis of major depression is made.

Bipolar Disorder (Manic Depression)
This mood disorder affects genders equally but often presents in young people.
Symptoms include the abrupt onset of increased energy, decreased need for
sleep, pressured speech, decreased attention span, hypersexuality, spending large
amounts of money, and engaging in outrageous activities. Concomitant substance abuse should always be investigated. Episodes must last longer than
1 week and should be abrupt, not continuous. Continuous behavior of this type
suggests personality disorders or schizophrenia. A single episode of mania is sufficient for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder. All patients diagnosed with depression should be questioned about mania, as the treatments are different. Bipolar
disorder is typically treated with mood stabilizers, which include valproate, carbamazepine, and lithium. The use of antidepressant agents in bipolar disorder
may precipitate acute manic behaviors.

Dysthymic Disorder
This mood disorder presents with continuous low mood as the primary symptom. Typically 2 years of low mood is used for diagnosis. Dysthymia is less
acute but longer in duration than major depression. If a major depressive
episode takes place during the 2 years of dysthymia, then, by definition, it is
major depression rather than dysthymia.

Comprehension Questions
25.1

A 62-year-old man presents for a follow-up visit for severe depression.
His symptoms have included crying episodes, insomnia, and decreased
appetite. He has suicidal ideations and states that he has a gun in his
home. He has had auditory hallucinations, saying he hears a voice
telling him that his wife is the devil. His symptoms have not been
relieved by maximum doses of sertraline (Zoloft), venlafaxine (Effexor),
or citalopram (Celexa). He is currently taking duloxetine (Cymbalta),
which has also failed to improve his symptoms. Which of the following
would most likely provide the quickest relief of his symptoms?
A. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT)
B. Bupropion (Wellbutrin)
C. Stopping duloxetine and starting on a MAO inhibitor
D. Behavioral modification

25.2

A 40-year-old woman sees you in follow-up of treatment for recurrent
depression. Her symptoms are improved a little after 2 months of fluoxetine [Prozac] 10 mg a day and weekly counseling sessions with a
psychologist. She is having no medication side effects and both she
and her husband state that she is taking her medication regularly.
Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step?
A. Continue with your current plan and give it more time.
B. Increase the fluoxetine dose to 20 mg daily and continue counseling.
C. Discontinue fluoxetine and start paroxetine 10 mg daily.
D. Continue fluoxetine and add bupropion as adjunctive therapy.
E. Discontinue medications and arrange for psychiatric consultation
for ECT.

25.3

Three weeks after starting a 22-year-old man on an SSRI for a first
episode of depression, you receive a call from his mother stating that
he hasn’t slept in days, is speaking very rapidly, and has maxed-out his
credit card buying electronic equipment. Which of the following is the
most likely explanation for this situation?
A. He is having a medication side effect.
B. He is secretly taking too much of his SSRI.
C. His SSRI has unmasked an underlying bipolar disorder.
D. His SSRI has precipitated a hyperthyroid state.

266

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

ANSWERS
25.1

A. This patient has psychotic depression with suicidal ideations and
has not responded to maximum doses of several antidepressants. He
is more likely to respond to electroconvulsive therapy than to counseling or a change in medication.

25.2

B. The most common causes of treatment failure or poor response to
therapy are inadequate medication dosing, inadequate length of
treatment, or noncompliance. In this setting, where the patient is
compliant and has had adequate time for response, increasing the
dose of medication from 10 mg (a low starting dose) to 20 mg would
be your first step. Typically, antidepressant medication dosages can
be increased after 4 weeks of treatment if the response is inadequate.

25.3

C. In bipolar patients, the use of an SSRI can precipitate a manic
state. It is critically important to assess for a history of manic episodes
prior to starting antidepressant therapy. In some cases, bipolar disorder may initially present as major depression, so the institution of antidepressant medication may unmask an undiagnosed bipolar condition.
Another condition to assess for in this situation is the concomitant use
of recreational drugs, such as cocaine or methamphetamine.

Clinical Pearls
➤ While diagnosing depression rule out other medical diagnoses such as
hypothyroidism, anemia, or infectious processes that could mimic some
symptoms of depression.
➤ Always investigate the use of alcohol and drugs when evaluating for mood
disorders.
➤ Suicidal and homicidal ideations should always be investigated and appropriately addressed when diagnosing depression.
➤ The addition of any new medication should be investigated to ensure it is
not contributing to the patient’s symptoms.

Case 26
A 26-year-old G1P1001 woman presents for a routine postpartum visit
6 weeks following the vaginal delivery of a 7-lb baby girl. She had an
uncomplicated prenatal course. She went into labor spontaneously at
39 2/7-week gestation. Her labor was augmented with oxytocin (Pitocin).
The first stage of labor lasted for 9 hours, the second stage for 45 minutes,
and the third stage for 15 minutes. She had a second-degree episiotomy
that was repaired without difficulty. She started breast-feeding her baby
immediately after delivery. Her postpartum course was uncomplicated
and she was discharged from the hospital on the second postpartum day.
She is exclusively breast-feeding her baby and reports that it is going
well. She says that she felt “stressed, sad, and overwhelmed” during her
first week at home, but that those feelings resolved after a week or so.
She is now in excellent spirits and has strong support at home from her
husband and her mother. She had some light vaginal bleeding that
stopped about a week after delivery. She had a mild, white discharge for
a couple of weeks that has also stopped and has had no vaginal discharge
since. On examination, she appears well and has normal vital signs. Her
general physical examination is normal. A pelvic examination shows a
well-healed episiotomy, no cervical or vaginal discharge, and no cervical motion tenderness. Her uterus is normal size, firm, and nontender,
and there are no adnexal masses.

ANSWERS TO CASE 26:
Postpartum Care
Summary: A 26-year-old first-time mother presents for a routine, 6-week postpartum examination. She is breast-feeding her baby. Her examination is normal. She had a brief period in which she felt sad and overwhelmed, but this
has resolved. She requests counseling about contraception.
➤

Maternal benefits of breast-feeding: Along with benefits to the baby, the
maternal benefits include (but are not limited to) a more rapid return of
uterine tone with reduced bleeding and a quicker return to nonpregnant
size; a more rapid return to prepregnancy body weight; a reduced incidence of
ovarian and breast cancer; the convenience of always having a readily available feeding supply for baby; and lower cost (no need to purchase formula).

➤

Counseling regarding use of diaphragm: There is no contraindication to
using a diaphragm but she should have a new fitting.

➤

Recommended hormonal contraception: In breast-feeding women, the
progestin-only “minipill” is recommended, as combined hormonal contraceptives can interfere with milk supply.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the normal changes that occur in the postpartum period.
2. Be familiar with the diagnosis and management of common postpartum
complications.
3. Be able to counsel patients on common postpartum issues such as contraception, breast-feeding, and postpartum depression.

Considerations
The postpartum period is defined as the time starting after the delivery of the
placenta and lasting for 6 to 12 weeks. The postpartum period is a time of
great change for the woman and the family. There are numerous normal physiologic changes that occur during the change from the pregnant to the nonpregnant state. Just as important are the many personal, social, and family
changes that occur, which can be magnified for first-time parents or when
there are unforeseen complications.

271

CLINICAL CASES

The immediate postpartum period, while still in the delivery suite, is usually focused on the medical conditions of both the neonate and the mother.
The delivery attendant examines the mother, repairs any lacerations or episiotomy, and monitors for complications, such as postpartum hemorrhage.
Simultaneous to this, the neonate is assessed and cared for during her initial
transition to extrauterine life. The baby is often quite alert during this time,
making it an ideal time to start breast-feeding efforts.
A typical postdelivery hospital stay is 24 to 48 hours for an uncomplicated
vaginal delivery and 72 to 96 hours for a cesarean delivery. This time allows for
recovery from the delivery or surgery, allows further monitoring for both maternal and neonatal problems, and can be used to provide education and support
for the new mother and family. Typical maternal problems that occur during
this time frame include pain, bleeding, lactation problems, and urinary difficulties (infections, incontinence, and retention). Postpartum fever is most often
a sign of endometritis (infection of the uterus), but can also be caused by urinary tract or wound infections, thromboembolic disease, and mastitis.
The time following discharge from the hospital and for the subsequent 6 to
12 weeks usually represents the period of greatest adjustment. There are normal changes that occur, along with many potential medical and emotional
complications. Future family planning and contraceptive issues often need to
be addressed as well. A 6-week postpartum examination is usually scheduled,
but many of the issues that can occur during this time frame should be
addressed prior to discharge from the hospital.

APPROACH TO
Postpartum Care
DEFINITIONS
ENDOMETRITIS: A polymicrobial infection of the endometrium of the

uterus, usually caused by ascending infection from the vagina.
LOCHIA: Yellow-white discharge, consisting of blood cells, decidual cells,

and fibrinous products, that occurs following delivery.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Normal Changes
Immediately following delivery, the uterus begins the process of involution,
the return to its nonpregnant size. Contraction of the uterine musculature
promotes hemostasis by compressing the uterine blood vessels. An IV infusion
of oxytocin (Pitocin) given during or immediately after the third stage of

272

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

labor will aid in producing increased uterine tone. Early breast-feeding also
leads to uterine contraction, further promoting involution. In most cases, the
uterus has returned to normal size by the time of the 6-week follow-up visit.
Vaginal bleeding is usually heaviest in the hours following delivery, then
decreases significantly. Brown or blood-tinged lochia occurs for about the
next week. This is followed by white or yellow lochia, which continues for
approximately 3 to 6 more weeks. In women who are not breast-feeding,
menstruation usually restarts by the third postpartum month. In women
who are breast-feeding, ovulation and menstruation can be suppressed for
much longer. Anovulation will persist for longer periods of time in women
who exclusively breast-feed their babies.
Breast engorgement, signaling increased milk production, typically occurs
1 to 4 days after delivery. In breast-feeding women, this is best managed by
increased frequency of feedings. In women who are not breast-feeding, the use
of ice packs, supportive bras, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) can reduce discomfort.

MEDICAL COMPLICATIONS
Hemorrhage
Postpartum hemorrhage is categorized as “early” or “late,” depending on when
the hemorrhage began. Early postpartum hemorrhage occurs within 24 hours
of delivery, most often immediately postpartum; late postpartum hemorrhage
occurs between 24 hours and 6 weeks after delivery. The causes of most cases
of postpartum hemorrhage can be remembered with the mnemonic “The Four Ts”
(Table 26–1). Careful examination focused on the likely causes should be performed promptly to identify the source of the bleeding.
As with all emergency situations, the first priority in this setting is assessment of the ABCs—airway, breathing, and circulation. It is important to
ensure that adequate IV access is available, preferably two large-bore IV
catheters. Fluid resuscitation with a crystalloid solution (normal saline, lactated Ringer solution) should be given as necessary and massive hemorrhage
may require transfusion with packed red blood cells.

CLINICAL CASES

273

Uterine atony is the most common cause of postpartum hemorrhage.
Failure of the uterus to contract adequately results in continued bleeding from
uterine vasculature. Risks include prolonged labor, prolonged use of oxytocin
during labor, a large baby, and grand multipara (five or more previous children).
Initial management of uterine atony includes the IV administration of oxytocin and initiation of bimanual uterine massage. When these fail to control
the bleeding, methylergonovine (Methergine) may be given intramuscularly.
Methylergonovine is contraindicated in patients with hypertension, as it may
cause an abrupt increase in blood pressure. If the bleeding continues following
this, or if the patient is hypertensive, prostaglandin F2a (Hemabate) can be
injected intramuscularly or intramyometrially. Prostaglandin F2a is contraindicated in women with asthma. Misoprostol (Cytotec), given rectally or orally, is
another option to increase uterine tone in the setting of postpartum hemorrhage.

Fever
Postpartum fever, especially if associated with uterine tenderness and foulsmelling lochia, is often a sign of endometritis. Endometritis complicates
approximately 10% of cesarean and 1% to 2% of vaginal deliveries. Antibiotics
given prophylactically during a cesarean delivery can reduce the risk of this
complication. When it does occur, endometritis should be treated with broadspectrum antibiotics that cover vaginal and gastrointestinal flora.
Urinary tract infections (UTI) are another common cause of fever after
both vaginal and cesarean deliveries. Urinary frequency, urgency, and burning
are typical presenting symptoms. Catheterization of the urinary bladder, which
occurs routinely during a cesarean delivery and frequently during vaginal deliveries, raises the risk of introducing bacteria into the normally sterile environment of the bladder.
Other causes of fever in the postpartum period, especially in women delivered
by cesarean, are identical to causes of fever in other postsurgical patients. These
include atelectasis, wound infections, and venous thromboembolic disease.

Mood Disorders
Up to three-fourths of women develop some type of psychological reaction
following the delivery of a child. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and
self-limited. However, a smaller but significant percentage can have a reaction of such severity as to require medical or psychiatric intervention.
Approximately 30% to 70% of women develop a temporary state known as the
“maternity blues” or “baby blues.” This condition develops within the first week
after delivery and typically resolves by the 10th postpartum day. Symptoms
include tearfulness, sadness, and emotional lability. The etiology is not entirely
clear, but may be multifactorial and include both hormonal changes following
delivery along with components of stress, sleep deprivation, and adjustment to
the new role of mother. Postpartum depression occurs following 10% to 20% of

274

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

pregnancies and can occur following gestations of any length— term, preterm,
miscarriages, or abortions. The onset is defined as occurring within 4 weeks
postpartum, but it has been seen up to a year later. The symptoms of postpartum depression are the same as in major depression. The severity can vary
from mild to severe and suicidal. There is a high recurrence rate in subsequent pregnancies and an increased risk in women with a history of depression unrelated to pregnancy. Untreated, postpartum depression can last for
6 months or more and can be a significant cause of morbidity. All women
should be screened for a history of psychiatric disorders during their prenatal
care and should be questioned about symptoms of depression during postpartum visits. The treatment is similar to the treatment of nonpregnancy-related
depression. Women who are a risk to themselves, or to others, or who are unable
to care for themselves should be admitted to the hospital. Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are first-line therapy because of their efficacy and
safety. They also are considered safe in breast-feeding. Counseling and general
supportive measures at home are also important adjuncts to treatment.
Postpartum psychosis is a rare, but potentially devastating, complication
following pregnancy. Manic or frankly delusional behaviors may present
within a few days to a few weeks of delivery in up to 1 in 1000 postpartum
patients. All women with postpartum psychosis should be hospitalized and
comanaged with a psychiatrist. Without proper treatment, there is a high risk
of suicide and infanticide associated with this diagnosis.

BREAST-FEEDING
Counseling and encouragement regarding both the maternal and infant benefits of breast-feeding should start during the prenatal period. Neonatal benefits
include ideal nutrition, increased resistance to infection, and a reduced risk of
gastrointestinal difficulties. Maternal benefits include improved mother–child
bonding, more rapid uterine involution, quicker return to prepregnant body
weight, convenience, decreased costs, and long-term reduced risks of ovarian
and breast cancer. Breast-feeding promotion and education can increase the rate
of breast-feeding and the duration for which women breast-feed their babies.
Women should be allowed to nurse their newborns as soon as possible following delivery. During this time, the newborns are often very alert and have
strong rooting and sucking reflexes, which promote latching on to the nipple.
Initial feedings provide colostrum, an antibody-rich clear/yellow nourishment
for the newborn. Breast engorgement and milk letdown commonly occurs
between the second and fourth postpartum days.
There are few contraindications to breast-feeding. HIV infection is a contraindication, as vertical transmission can occur through infected breast milk.
Most mothers with hepatitis B and C can safely breast-feed, although women
with acute, active hepatitis B infection should not breast-feed. Women who
have had breast-reduction surgery with nipple transplantation will be unable
to breast-feed.

CLINICAL CASES

275

Common maternal complications of breast-feeding include sore or cracked
nipples and mastitis. Sore nipples can be managed with frequent position
changes, alternating breasts during feedings, and applications of lanolin.
Mastitis, an obstruction of milk glands sometimes secondarily infected with
bacteria, is treated by increased nursing or breast pumping and oral antibiotics, such as cephalexin or dicloxacillin. Mastitis should not result in discontinuation of nursing.

FAMILY PLANNING
Most women resume sexual activity by 3 months postpartum. Numerous options
are available to women for contraception and family planning. Discussion of these
options ideally should occur in the prenatal period and again before discharge
from the hospital.
Oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) are the most widely used reversible form
of contraception. Available OCPs contain either combined estrogen and
progestin or are progestin only. In breast-feeding women, the progestin-only
pills are preferred because the combination OCPs might reduce lactation.
Both the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the
World Health Organization recommend waiting for 6 weeks postpartum to
start oral contraceptives in breast-feeding women. Injectable long-acting
depot medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) may also be used in breastfeeding women and should also be given at least 6 weeks postpartum. Non–
breast-feeding women should wait 3 weeks after delivery to start combined
OCPs, as the risk of thromboembolic disease is higher in those who start at
earlier times.
Barrier methods of contraception may also be used regardless of breastfeeding status. An intrauterine device (IUD) may be placed at the 6-week
postpartum visit; earlier placement is associated with an increased rate of
expulsion of the device. Diaphragms and cervical caps can be used, but
should be refitted at the 6-week visit to ensure an appropriate fit.
Lactation-induced amenorrhea provides a high level of natural contraception in the first 6 months postpartum. Women who breast-feed exclusively and
who are amenorrheic have a 98% contraceptive protection for 6 months. After
6 months, if menses restart, or if breast-feeding is reduced, the risk of pregnancy
increases and alternate forms of contraception should be used.

Comprehension Questions
26.1

You are called by the postpartum nurse to see a 20-year-old woman
who delivered an 8 lb 9 oz baby boy approximately 6 hours ago. The
nurse noted that the patient is continuing to bleed more than
expected. The patient is awake and talking, but feels dizzy. Her blood
pressure is 90/40 mm Hg and her pulse is 110 bpm. You see that her
perineal pad is soaked with blood. Which of the following is your most
appropriate initial intervention?
A. Add 20 units of oxytocin (Pitocin) to the IV of 0.45% saline that
is currently running at 125 mL/h.
B. Perform bimanual uterine massage.
C. Place a large-bore IV and give a 1 L bolus of 0.9% saline.
D. Give an IM injection of methylergonovine (Methergine).

26.2

A 29-year-old first-time mother comes to you for her routine 6-week
postpartum visit. Her husband, who accompanied her to the visit,
reports that his wife is tearful much of the time. She has not been
sleeping well, has little energy, and a reduced appetite. She denies any
suicidal thoughts, hallucinations, or feelings that she wants to harm
her baby. Which of the following is the most appropriate intervention?
A. Reassurance that these feelings will pass within a week or so
B. Referral to a psychiatrist for outpatient management
C. Institution of SSRI therapy and close follow-up
D. Admission to the hospital and urgent psychiatric consultation

26.3

You see a 30-year-old woman for an acute visit 16 days postpartum.
She has been nursing her baby daughter, but has developed a very sore
left breast. On examination, the patient has a temperature of 101.3°F
(38.5°C). The breast is diffusely tender but primarily in the upper inner
quadrant. The skin overlying the area of most tenderness is erythematous and warm. There is no nipple discharge and the remainder of the
examination is normal. Which of the following is the best treatment?
A. This condition is self-limited, but she should stop nursing the baby
on the left breast until this condition resolves.
B. She may nurse from the unaffected breast, but should simply pump
and discard the milk from the painful breast.
C. The patient should receive oral dicloxacillin.
D. She should have a fine needle aspiration.

CLINICAL CASES

26.4

277

A 19-year-old woman is seen in the office 3 weeks postpartum. She is
exclusively breast-feeding and has not had a menstrual cycle since her
delivery. She would like to have an IUD placed for contraception, as
she would like to wait several years before having another baby. Which
of the following actions would be most appropriate at this time?
A. Plan to insert the IUD at a 6-week postpartum visit.
B. Prescribe progestin-only minipills until she is no longer breastfeeding and then insert the IUD.
C. Advise that she needs no contraception until she is no longer
breastfeeding and she should return after that time for the IUD.
D. Insert the IUD today.

ANSWERS
26.1

C. This patient is symptomatically hypovolemic, with dizziness,
hypotension, and tachycardia. Fluid resuscitation must be your first
intervention—remember the ABCs first! Once you have started the
management of this critical issue, you should turn your attention to
identifying and correcting the source of the bleeding.

26.2

C. This is a picture of postpartum depression. The symptoms are
identical to those of a major depressive episode. The maternity blues
is a self-limited condition that starts in the first postpartum week
and resolves in the second. Fortunately, this patient does not have
signs of postpartum psychosis—mania, hallucinations, and delusions.
Appropriate management includes the use of an SSRI, counseling,
and close follow-up.

26.3

C. Mastitis is a common complication of breast-feeding. It is caused
by gland obstruction and sometimes, as in this case, there also are
signs of infection. Treatment is directed at relieving the obstruction,
so increased breast-feeding or pumping is helpful. The antibiotics
typically used for this complication are considered safe to use while
nursing. Cephalexin or a penicillin-based antibiotic would be appropriate in this case.

26.4

A. IUDs provide highly effective, reversible contraception and are
very useful for women who wish to space out pregnancies for several
years. Postpartum insertion prior to 6 weeks is associated with a
higher risk of expulsion of the IUD from the uterus as it involutes.
Breastfeeding-induced amenorrhea provides a high degree of protection against pregnancy for about the first 6 months postpartum, but
an alternate form of contraception should be used after 6 months or
when menses restart.

Case 27
A 66-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of shortness
of breath and bilateral leg edema that have been worsening for
3 months. She emphatically tells you, “I get out of breath when I do
housework and I can’t even walk to the corner.” She has also noticed
difficulty sleeping secondary to a dry cough that wakes her up at night
and further exacerbation of her shortness of breath while lying flat. This
has forced her to use three pillows for a good night’s sleep. She denies
any chest pain, wheezing, or febrile illness. She has no past illnesses and
takes no medications. She’s never smoked and drinks socially. On examination, her blood pressure is 187/90 mm Hg, her pulse is 97 bpm, her
respiratory rate is 16 breaths per minute, her temperature is 98°F
(36.6°C), and her oxygen saturation is 93% on room air by pulse oximetry.
She has a pronounced jugular vein. Cardiac examination reveals a pansystolic murmur. Examination of her lung bases produces dullness bilaterally. You find 2+ pitting edema of both ankles. An ECG shows a normal

ANSWERS TO CASE 27:
Congestive Heart Failure
Summary: A 66-year-old woman presents to your office with worsening shortness of breath, bilateral leg edema, and three-pillow orthopnea. She is not
known to be hypertensive, but her blood pressure (BP) is 187/90 mm Hg and
she is only saturating 93% on room air. Her examination reveals jugular
venous distension (JVD), a cardiac murmur, and decreased breath sounds at
both lung bases. On a chest x-ray you find bilateral pleural effusions and
decide to admit her for further workup and management.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: New-onset congestive heart failure.

➤

Next diagnostic step: Serial cardiac enzymes and ECGs; blood work to
include a CBC, electrolytes, and renal function; echocardiogram.

➤

Initial therapy: Telemetry monitoring, IV diuretics, and oxygen.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know how to clinically recognize congestive heart failure (CHF).
2. Understand the classification of CHF.
3. Understand the mechanism of action of the drugs used in the treatment of
acute and chronic CHF.
4. Understand the underlying pathophysiology that occurs in CHF and the
rationale for treatment options.
5. Be familiar with the outpatient management of CHF and the importance
of patient education.

Considerations
This 66-year-old woman presented with congestive heart failure. Her most
immediate problem is oxygenation and volume overload on her weakened
heart. The first priority is optimizing oxygen exchange by administering oxygen via nasal cannula, dilating pulmonary vasculature, and decreasing cardiac
preload and afterload. Most cases of CHF are caused by either coronary artery
disease or hypertension, so it is imperative to admit these patients for serial cardiac enzymes and further assessment of heart function. The overloading of fluid
in the lungs is a common cause of anxiety and distress in patients with acute
CHF because of the continuous struggle to oxygenate adequately. This anxiety

281

CLINICAL CASES

activates sympathetic pathways and mounts catecholamine-induced responses,
which produce further worsening of acute heart failure by causing tachycardia
and increasing peripheral vascular resistance, leading to greater stress on the
heart and worsening of symptoms. These triggers can, in part, be suppressed
by the use of an agent such as morphine sulfate, which acts as both an anxiolytic and a vasodilator. Furosemide (Lasix) is the diuretic of choice, not only
for its diuretic effect but also for its immediate vasodilatory action on bronchial
vasculature. Admitting these patients to the hospital allows for closer maintenance of homeostasis in their fluid balances and evaluation of any underlying condition that may have precipitated the CHF. Other medications, including
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and β-blockers, help to control heart failure symptoms by decreasing preload and afterload, and reducing
cardiac remodeling.

APPROACH TO
Congestive Heart Failure
DEFINITIONS
CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Imbalance in pump function where the

heart fails to maintain the circulation of blood adequately.
FRAMINGHAM HEART STUDY: Large, prospective cohort study of the epi-

demiologic factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.

CLINICAL APPROACH
CHF is divided into two main categories: systolic and diastolic dysfunction.
Systolic dysfunction exists when there is a dilated left ventricle with impaired
contractility. Diastolic dysfunction occurs in a normal or intact left ventricle
that has an impaired ability to relax, fill, and eject blood. Table 27–1 lists the
findings frequently associated with CHF.
Dyspnea on exertion is the most sensitive symptom for the diagnosis of
CHF, but its specificity is much lower. Other symptoms, which are common
but less sensitive for the diagnosis, include dyspnea at rest, anxiety, orthopnea,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and cough productive of pink, frothy sputum.
Nonspecific symptoms sometimes reported are weakness, lightheadedness,
abdominal pain, malaise, wheezing, and nausea. Patients may have a medical
history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, or other heart diseases (eg,
cardiomyopathy, valvular disease). Histories of cigarette smoking and alcohol
abuse may also be found.

Etiologies
The symptoms and signs that occur are unique and characteristic of the alterations to the normal physiologic function. Symptoms of right-sided heart failure
include venous congestion, nausea/vomiting, distension/bloating, constipation,
abdominal pain, and decreased appetite. Common signs of right-sided heart
failure are fluid retention, weight gain, peripheral edema, JVD, hepatojugular
reflux, hepatic ascites, and splenomegaly.
Left-sided heart failure manifests with pulmonary congestion, resulting in
the symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, orthopnea, wheezing, tachypnea, and cough. The signs of pulmonary congestion are
bilateral pulmonary rales, S3 gallop rhythm, Cheyne-Stokes respiration, pleural effusion, and pulmonary edema. Pulmonary edema is often the first manifestation of congestive heart failure, but it can also be caused by a variety of
noncardiac conditions (Table 27–2).
Signs common to both left- and right-heart failure are tachycardia, cardiomegaly, cyanosis, oliguria, nocturia, and peripheral edema. Symptoms
common to both include weakness, fatigue, confusion (delirium), decreased

mental status, insomnia, decreased exercise tolerance, headache, stupor, coma,
paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and declining functional status.
After the Framingham Heart Study was reviewed, criteria were devised to
help diagnose CHF by both signs and symptoms. Two major criteria or one
major and two minor criteria can lead to a presumptive diagnosis of CHF. The
major signs are paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, JVD, rales, cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema, S3 gallop, central venous pressure greater than 16 cm H2O,
circulation time of 25 seconds, hepatojugular reflex, and weight loss of 4.5 kg
over 5 days of treatment. Minor criteria include bilateral ankle edema, nocturnal cough, dyspnea on exertion, hepatomegaly, pleural effusions, decreased
vital capacity by one-third of maximum, and tachycardia.

Epidemiology
Of the general population between the ages of 50 and 59 years, 1% to 2% will
have CHF, but that number increases to 6% to 10% in persons older than age 65.
Approximately 30% to 40% of patients with CHF are hospitalized every year;
it is the leading diagnosis-related group (DRG) among hospitalized patients older
than age 65 years. The 5-year mortality rate remained essentially unchanged from
1971 to 1991, at 60% in men and 45% in women. Data from the Framingham
Heart Study shows a median survival of 3.2 years for men and 5.4 years for
women with CHF. The most common cause of death is progressive heart failure,

284

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

but sudden death may account for up to 45% of all deaths. African Americans
are 1.5 times more likely to die of CHF than are Whites. Nevertheless,
African American patients appear to have similar or lower in-hospital mortality rates than White patients. The prevalence is greater in men than in
women for patients ages 40 to 75 years; after the age of 75, however, there is
no difference.

Evaluation
After an initial assessment of the “ABCs”—airway, breathing, and circulation—
patients presenting with dyspnea suggestive of heart failure should be evaluated with a history, physical examination, and focused testing. The testing
should be designed to confirm CHF (or lead to an alternate diagnosis), identify a cause, and assess the severity of the disease. These initial tests should
include blood tests, radiographic studies, electrocardiography, and echocardiography.
Initial blood tests should generally include a complete blood count (CBC),
serum electrolytes, renal function tests, hepatic function tests, and cardiac
enzymes. A high white blood cell count can help to identify the presence of
an underlying infection, a common triggering event of CHF. Anemia is
another common trigger of CHF. In an anemic patient, the oxygen-carrying
ability of the blood is reduced. The cardiac output must increase to compensate for this. If the anemia is mild, or if the heart is normal, this compensation
may occur without producing symptoms; if the anemia is severe or if there is
underlying cardiac abnormality (from previous ischemia, hypertension, valvular abnormality, etc), heart failure may occur.
Electrolyte abnormalities are common in the presence of CHF. Neurohumoral
responses to a failing heart result in water and sodium retention and potassium excretion. Severe heart failure can result in a dilutional hyponatremia.
Medications used by patients with chronic heart disease (diuretics, ACE inhibitors,
others) also can lead to electrolyte abnormalities. Increased vascular congestion can lead to passive congestion of the liver, resulting in increases in serum
transaminases. Severe CHF can lead to jaundice as a consequence of impaired
hepatic function caused by congestion. Serial measurement of cardiac enzymes
is necessary to evaluate for the presence of acute myocardial infarction as the
inciting event.
One of the neurohumoral responses to the presence of a failing ventricle is
release of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP). The “Breathing Not Properly”
study, published in 2004, showed that elevated levels of BNP and its prohormone (pro-BNP) can be used to assist in the diagnosis of CHF as a cause of
acute dyspnea. Elevated levels of BNP and pro-BNP are a sensitive and specific
marker for the diagnosis of CHF. In a dyspneic patient, a level of BNP less than
100 pg/mL suggests that the symptoms are unlikely to be caused by CHF; a
BNP level less than 500 pg/mL is consistent with the diagnosis of CHF.

CLINICAL CASES

285

ECG findings in CHF are variable. An ECG is useful to evaluate for evidence of acute ischemia or arrhythmia as cause of the CHF and can also reveal
the presence of ventricular hypertrophy, often seen in chronic hypertension.
Chest x-ray can also show cardiomegaly and cardiac chamber enlargement.
Typically, the cardiothoracic ratio is greater than 50%. One of the earliest
chest x-ray findings in CHF is cephalization of the pulmonary vasculature. As
the failure progresses, interstitial pulmonary edema can be seen as perihilar
infiltrates, often in a butterfly pattern. Pleural effusions can also be found.
Effusions are usually bilateral but, if unilateral, are more often seen on the
right hemithorax than the left.
Echocardiography is the gold-standard diagnostic modality in the presence
of CHF. It may help to identify regional or global wall motion abnormalities,
cardiomyopathy, ventricular or septal hypertrophy, and cardiac ejection fraction. It also can find cardiac tamponade, pericardial constriction, and pulmonary embolus. Echocardiography also is useful in identifying valvular
stenosis or regurgitation, either of which can lead to heart failure. These findings aid in the determination of whether the heart failure is a systolic or diastolic dysfunction, an important distinction in the decision of appropriate
treatment.

Classification of CHF
CHF severity is characterized by the symptoms a patient has and the degree that
the symptoms limit a patient’s lifestyle. There are several classification systems in
use; two of the most widely used are the New York Heart Association (NYHA)
and the American Heart Association (AHA) classifications. Table 27–3 summarizes these systems. The classification of CHF is important in determining the
appropriate treatment and prognosis for the patient.

Management of Heart Failure
In all cases of acute CHF, the initial management imperative is the “ABCs”—
airway, breathing, and circulation. Supplemental oxygen, initially 100% via
non-rebreather face mask, should be administered. If necessary, ventilation can
be assisted with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive
airway pressure (BiPAP), or mechanical ventilation. Cardiac and continuous
pulse oximetry monitors should be placed and IV access obtained.
When acute pulmonary edema caused by CHF is diagnosed, the next step
in management is the administration of a loop diuretic. Furosemide is generally the treatment of choice, both for its potent diuretic effect and for its rapid
bronchial vasculature vasodilation. Nitrates, particularly nitroglycerin when
given IV, reduce myocardial oxygen demand by reducing preload and afterload. Nitroglycerin also can rapidly reduce blood pressure and is the treatment
of choice in a patient who has CHF and whose blood pressure is elevated.

It should be used with caution or avoided in a hypotensive patient. IV morphine
sulphate can be an effective adjunct to therapy. Along with its analgesic and
anxiolytic properties, morphine is a venodilator (primary effect) and arterial dilator, resulting in a reduction in preload and an increase in cardiac output.
Most patients who present to the emergency department with symptomatic
CHF will require admission to a telemetry unit for treatment and monitoring.
Discharge criteria from the emergency department includes the gradual onset
of symptoms, rapid resolution of symptoms with treatment, oxygen saturation
of >90% on room air, and exclusion of an acute coronary syndrome as the
cause of the CHF.

Outpatient Management of CHF
Patient education is an important aspect of the care for all patients with CHF.
All patients should be advised about the importance of dietary sodium and
fluid restriction. A normal American diet contains 6 to 10 g sodium chloride
a day; initial restriction in patients with CHF should be 2 to 4 g/d. Stricter
restrictions may be necessary in those with more severe disease. Overweight
and obese patients should be counseled on appropriate caloric restrictions and
encouraged to exercise to reduce weight. The importance of strict management of blood pressure and modification of other cardiac risk factors should
be emphasized as well.
ACE inhibitors should be considered first-line therapy in patients with
CHF and reduced left ventricular function. ACE inhibitors reduce preload,

CLINICAL CASES

287

afterload, improve cardiac output, and inhibit tissue renin–angiotensin systems.
The result of this is an improvement in symptoms and a reduction in mortality.
ACE inhibitors can also delay the development of symptomatic CHF in asymptomatic patients with a reduced cardiac ejection fraction. Angiotensin receptor
blockers (ARBs) can be used in place of an ACE inhibitor in a patient who does
not tolerate an ACE inhibitor because of side effects (eg, cough).
ACE inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnancy, hypotension, hyperkalemia, and bilateral renal artery stenosis, and should be used with caution
in patients with renal insufficiency.
For many years, the teaching was to avoid the use of β-blockers in the setting
of CHF. However, more recent data support the use of β-blockers for both systolic and diastolic heart failure. The administration of β-blockers, especially in
high doses, in the setting of acute CHF, can worsen symptoms; consequently,
initial doses should be low and titrated up over several weeks. β-Blockers can
reduce the sympathetic tone and the cardiac muscle remodeling associated with
chronic heart failure. β-Blockers reduce mortality in patients with an ejection
fraction of less than 35% and are primarily indicated in patients with NYHA
Class II or III heart failure, or in patients with coronary artery disease.
Diuretics should be used to reduce fluid overload in both the acute and
chronic settings. Loop diuretics (furosemide, bumetanide, torsemide,
ethacrynic acid) can be used in all stages of CHF and are useful in pulmonary
edema and refractory heart failure. Thiazide diuretics (hydrochlorothiazide,
chlorthalidone, others) are used in mild heart failure and may be used in combination with other diuretics in more severe CHF. Diuretic doses can be
adjusted based on daily weight measurements by the patient.
The aldosterone antagonist spironolactone reduces mortality in advanced
heart failure. It also functions as a diuretic and should be considered in
NYHA Class III and IV heart failure. Patients on this medication must be
closely monitored for the development of hyperkalemia, which can become
profound and lead to arrhythmia.
Calcium channel blockers, in general, are contraindicated in systolic heart
failure, because they increase mortality. The exception to this is the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine (Norvasc), which did not
increase or decrease mortality. Nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers
(diltiazem, verapamil) are useful in heart failure caused by diastolic dysfunction, as they promote increased cardiac output by lowering heart rate, which
allows for more ventricular filling time.
Approximately one-third of patients with NYHA Class III or IV heart failure and reduced ejection fraction have ECG evidence of abnormal ventricular conduction (ie, prolonged QRS duration). These patients can be helped
by promoting synchronous contraction of both the right and left ventricles
using a biventricular pacemaker. This process, also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy, has been shown to reduce mortality and hospitalization
in patients with symptomatic CHF in spite of maximal medical therapy.

289

A 70-year-old African American man with New York Heart Association
Class III heart failure sees you for follow-up. He has shortness of breath
with minimal exertion. The patient is adherent to his medication regimen. His current medications include lisinopril 40 mg twice daily,
carvedilol 25 mg twice daily, and furosemide 80 mg daily. His blood
pressure is 100/60 mm Hg, and his pulse rate is 70 bpm and regular.
Physical examination findings include a few scattered bibasilar rales,

branch block and echocardiography reveals an ejection fraction of
25%. Which of the following is the best next step for this patient?
A. Increase the furosemide dosage to 80 mg twice daily.
B. Refer for coronary angiography.
C. Increase the lisinopril dosage to 80 mg twice daily.
D. Increase the carvedilol dosage to 50 mg twice daily.
E. Refer for cardiac resynchronization therapy.

ANSWERS
27.1

C. β-Blockers are recommended to reduce mortality in symptomatic
patients with heart failure. Because polypharmacy can reduce compliance, the role that digoxin plays in heart failure management is
unclear. Calcium channel blockers should be used with caution in
patients with heart failure because they can cause peripheral vasodilation, decreased heart rate, decreased cardiac contractility, and decreased
cardiac conduction.

27.2

D. The most useful diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with heart
failure is two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler to assess
left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular size, ventricular compliance, wall thickness, and valve function. It should be performed during the initial evaluation. Chest radiography and 12-lead
electrocardiography should be performed in all patients presenting
with heart failure, but should not be used as the primary basis for
determining which abnormalities are responsible for the heart failure.

27.3

B. Furosemide, a loop diuretic, is a first-line agent in CHF exacerbation with pulmonary edema. The other medications listed may be
used in the management of CHF, but are not indicated in an acute
exacerbation.

290
27.4

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

E. This patient is already receiving maximal medical therapy. The
2002 joint guidelines of the American College of Cardiology, the
American Heart Association (AHA), and the North American
Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology endorse the use of cardiac
resynchronization therapy (CRT) in patients with medically refractory, symptomatic, NYHA Class III or IV disease with a QRS interval of at least 130 msec, a left ventricular end-diastolic diameter of at
least 55 mm, and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) less than
or equal to 30%. These guidelines were refined by an April 2005
AHA Science Advisory, which stated that optimal candidates for
CRT have a dilated cardiomyopathy on an ischemic or nonischemic
basis, an LVEF less than or equal to 35%, a QRS complex greater than
or equal to 120 msec with sinus rhythm, and are NYHA functional
Class III or IV despite maximal medical treatment for heart failure.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The initial hour in the management of a patient with either new-onset CHF
or an acute exacerbation is crucial to their outcome.
➤ Simple measures, such as decreasing cardiac preload by sitting the patient
up with their legs on the ground and their arms by their side, maintaining
an airway and giving oxygen, and giving sublingual nitroglycerin, can alleviate CHF immediately.

Summary: A 38-year-old parous woman presents for counseling regarding her
contraceptive options. She is in a monogamous relationship. She reports that
she is dissatisfied with using over-the-counter options and that she is not

Contraindicated contraceptive options: Oral contraceptive pills.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the available methods of contraception.
2. Be aware of contraindications for and the side effects of contraceptives.

Considerations
Choosing a method of contraception is a personal decision, based on individual preferences, medical history, and lifestyle. Each method of contraception
has a number of risks and benefits of which the patient should be aware. In
the United States, approximately 50% of pregnancies are unintended and
approximately 50% of these pregnancies end in abortion. Each method of
contraceptive has a failure rate, which is an inability to prevent pregnancy
over a 1-year period. Sometimes the failure rate is a result of the method and
sometimes it is a result of human error. Each method has possible side effects.
Some methods require lifestyle modifications. Patients with certain medical
conditions cannot use certain types of contraceptives.
There are numerous contraceptive options available and recommendations
regarding contraceptive use must be individualized. In the case given, there
are several important factors that must be considered. Hormonal contraceptives are contraindicated in women older than age 35 years who smoke cigarettes. Given the patient’s fear of surgery and because she is not certain
whether she wants to have more children in the future, surgical sterilization
via tubal ligation is not a choice. Barrier methods are too much of an inconvenience to the patient’s busy lifestyle. A vasectomy might not be welcomed
by the boyfriend. Given that both the patient and her boyfriend have no history
of STDs and are in a long-term relationship, the best method of contraception

APPROACH TO
Contraception
DEFINITIONS
INTRAUTERINE CONTRACEPTIVE DEVICES (IUD): Small T-shaped

device, usually plastic with or without copper or a progestin, placed in the
endometrial cavity as a method of long-term contraception.
TYPICAL USE EFFECTIVENESS: Overall efficacy in actual use, when forgetfulness and improper use occur.
PERFECT USE EFFECTIVENESS: Efficacy of a method when always used
correctly, consistent and reliable use occur.
BARRIER CONTRACEPTIVE: Prevents sperm from entering upper female reproductive tract.
STEROID HORMONE CONTRACEPTION: Synthetic estrogen and/or progestin to provide contraception in various methods, including oral contraceptive pills, contraceptive patch, contraceptive ring, contraceptive injection,
and implant.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The decision process regarding which contraception agent to use in which
patient is complex. Review of the patient’s individual situation, medical problems, ability to remember to take medication each day plays a role. Table 28–1
summarizes some of the characteristics of various contraceptive agents.

HORMONAL CONTRACEPTION
Hormonal contraception involves ways of delivering estrogen and progesterone. Hormones interact with the body and have the potential for serious
side effects, although this is rare. When properly used, hormonal methods are
extremely effective. Hormonal methods are available only by prescription.

Oral Contraceptives
There are two types of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs): combination pills,
which contain both estrogen and a progestin (a natural or synthetic progesterone), and “minipills,” which contain only progestin. The combination pill
suppresses ovulation through inhibition of the hypothalamic–pituitary–ovarian
axis, alters the cervical mucus, retards sperm entry, and discourages implantation
into an unfavorable endometrium. Combination oral contraceptives offer significant protection against ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, iron-deficiency

anemia, pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), and fibrocystic breast disease.
Women who take combination pills have a lower risk of functional ovarian
cysts. The minipill reduces cervical mucus and causes it to thicken. The mucus
thickening prevents the sperm from reaching the egg and keeps the uterine lining from thickening, which prevents the fertilized egg from implanting in the
uterus. When taken as directed, the failure rate for the minipill is 1% to 3%;
the failure rate of the combination pill is 1% to 2%.
Women over the age of 35 who smoke cigarettes and women with certain
medical conditions should not take the OCP. Table 28–2 lists the absolute
and relative contraindications to taking the OCP. Minor side effects, which
usually subside after a few months of usage, include nausea, headaches, breast
swelling, fluid retention, weight gain, irregular bleeding, and depression.
When starting an OCP, patients should take the first pill the first day after
the start of menses. Many women choose to start on the Sunday after the start
of their menses for convenience. Postpartum, non–breast-feeding women
should start the OCP during the fourth week after delivery. OCPs can be
started the day after an induced or spontaneous abortion. If a pill is missed,
it should be taken as soon as possible and the next dose should be taken as
usual. If two pills are missed, take two pills together on 2 consecutive days to
catch up and alternative contraception should be used for 7 days.
The effectiveness of OCPs may be reduced by a few other medications,
including some antibiotics, barbiturates, and antifungal medications. On the
other hand, OCPs may prolong the effects of theophylline, benzodiazepine,
and caffeine.

Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera)
Medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) is an injectable form of a progestin. DepoProvera has a failure rate of only 1%. Each injection provides contraceptive protection for 14 weeks. It is injected every 3 months into a muscle in the buttocks
or arm. Its side effects include irregular menses, weight gain, and facial/body hair
growth. In addition, there may be irregular bleeding and spotting during the first
months followed by periods of amenorrhea. About half of women develop amenorrhea after a year of Depo-Provera use. There may be a prolonged period of time
prior to return of fertility after discontinuing Depo-Provera.

Transdermal Contraceptive
A transdermal contraceptive patch (Ortho Evra) is available. It is a combined
hormone patch containing norelgestromin (the active metabolite of norgestimate) and ethinyl estradiol. The treatment regimen for each cycle is three
consecutive 7-day patches followed by one patch-free week, so that withdrawal bleeding can occur. The patch’s efficacy and side effects are comparable to that of combined OCPs, although there may be an increased risk of
vascular thrombosis with use of the patch.

Intravaginal Ring Contraceptive
NuvaRing is a flexible, transparent ring made of ethylene vinyl acetate
copolymers that delivers etonogestrel and ethinyl estradiol. A woman inserts
the NuvaRing herself, wears it for 3 weeks, then removes and discards the
device. After one ring-free week, during which withdrawal bleeding occurs, a
new ring is inserted. The side effects of NuvaRing are similar to those of combined OCPs, with the main adverse effect being disrupted bleeding.

Spermicides Used Alone
Spermicides come in many forms (foams, jellies, gels, and suppositories) and
work by forming a physical and chemical barrier to sperm. They should be
inserted into the vagina within an hour before intercourse. If intercourse is
repeated, more spermicide should be inserted. The active ingredient in most
spermicides is the chemical nonoxynol-9. The failure rate for spermicides in
preventing pregnancy when used alone is 20% to 30%. Spermicides are available without a prescription. When spermicides are used with a condom, the
failure rate is comparable to that of oral contraceptives and is much better
than for either spermicides or condoms used alone.

BARRIER METHODS
There are five barrier methods of contraception: male condoms, female condoms, diaphragm, sponge, and cervical cap. In each, the method works by

300

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

keeping the sperm and egg apart. The main possible side effect is an allergic
reaction either to the material of the barrier or the spermicides that should be
used with them. Using the methods correctly for each and every sexual intercourse gives the best protection.

Male Condom
Condoms on the market are made of either latex rubber or natural skin (from
sheep intestines). Of these two types, only latex condoms are highly effective in preventing STDs. Latex provides a good barrier to viruses such as HIV
and hepatitis B. Each condom can only be used once. Condoms have a birth
control failure rate of approximately 15%, with most of the failures a result of
improper use. Some condoms have spermicide added, which may give some
additional contraceptive protection. Vaginal spermicides may also be added
before sexual intercourse.

Female Condom
The Reality Female Condom consists of a lubricated polyurethane sheath
with a flexible polyurethane ring on each end. One ring is inserted into the
vagina much like a diaphragm, while the other remains outside, partially covering the labia. The female condom may offer some protection against STDs;
however, for highly effective protection, male latex condoms must be used.
The estimated yearly failure rate ranges from 21% to 26%.

Sponge
The contraceptive sponge is made of white polyurethane foam. The sponge,
shaped like a small doughnut, contains the spermicide nonoxynol-9. It is
inserted into the vagina to cover the cervix during and after intercourse. It
does not require fitting by a health professional and is available without prescription. It is to be used only once and then discarded. The failure rate is
between 18% and 28%. An extremely rare side effect is toxic shock syndrome
(TSS).

Diaphragm
The diaphragm is a flexible rubber disk with a rigid rim ranging in size from
2 to 4 in. in diameter. It is designed to cover the cervix during and after intercourse, so that sperm cannot reach the uterus. Spermicidal jelly or cream must
be placed inside the diaphragm for it to be effective. The diaphragm must be
fitted by a health professional and the correct size prescribed to ensure a snug
seal with the vaginal wall. If intercourse is repeated, additional spermicide
should be added with the diaphragm still in place. The diaphragm should be
left in place for at least 6 hours after intercourse. The diaphragm used with
spermicide has a failure rate of from 6% to 18%.

CLINICAL CASES

301

Cervical Cap
The cervical cap is a dome-shaped rubber cap in various sizes that fits snugly
over the cervix. Like the diaphragm, it is used with a spermicide and must be
fitted by a health professional. It is more difficult to insert than the diaphragm,
but may be left in place for up to 48 hours. There also appears to be an
increased incidence of irregular Papanicolaou (Pap) tests in the first 6 months
of using the cap, and TSS is an extremely rare side effect. The cap has a failure rate of about 18%.

INTRAUTERINE DEVICES
IUDs are small, plastic, flexible devices that are inserted into the uterus
through the cervix by a trained physician. Only two IUDs are presently marketed in the United States: ParaGard T380A, a T-shaped device partially
covered by copper and effective for 10 years, and Mirena, which is also T-shaped
but contains a progestin released over a 5-year period. The copper-T IUD has
a 4% to 5% failure rate while the Mirena has a failure rate of less than 1%.
An IUD alters the uterine and tubal fluids, particularly in the case of copperbearing IUDs, inhibiting the transport of sperm through the cervical mucus and
uterus. Progesterone-containing IUDs also thin the uterine lining. The risk of
PID with IUD use is highest in those women with multiple sex partners or who
have a history of previous PID. Consequently, the IUD is recommended primarily for women in mutually monogamous relationships.
Absolute contraindications for IUD include current, recent (within 3 months),
or recurrent endometritis, PID, or STD; pregnancy; anatomically distorted
uterine cavity; and known or suspected HIV infection. Relative contraindications include any history of gonorrhea or Chlamydia; multiple sexual partners
or a partner with multiple other partners; undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding; known or suspected uterine or cervical malignancy; and previous problems
with an IUD (pregnancy, expulsion, perforation, pain, heavy bleeding). In
addition to PID, other complications include perforation of the uterus, septic
abortion, and ectopic pregnancy. Women may also experience some short-term
side effects such as cramping and dizziness at the time of insertion; bleeding,
cramps, and backache that may continue for a few days after the insertion;
spotting between periods; and longer and heavier menstruation during the first
few periods after insertion. The patient should check that the string is palpable each month after her menses. Between 2% and 10% of women expel their
IUD within the first year. The absolute rate of ectopic pregnancy is reduced
with the IUD because of its high contraceptive efficacy. However, when accidental pregnancy does occur, there is an increased proportion of ectopic pregnancy. Adolescence and nulliparity are not contraindications in properly
selected young women in monogamous relationships.

302

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

NATURAL FAMILY PLANNING
Periodic abstinence (natural family planning or rhythm method) entails not
having sexual intercourse during the woman’s fertile period. Using periodic
abstinence is dependent on the ability to identify the approximately 10 days in
each menstrual cycle that a woman is fertile. Periodic abstinence has a failure
rate of 14% to 47%. Women with irregular cycles have the highest failure rates.
The basal body temperature method is based on the knowledge that just before
ovulation a woman’s basal body temperature drops several tenths of a degree
and after ovulation it returns to normal. The method requires that the woman
take her temperature each morning before she gets out of bed. There are now
electronic thermometers with memories and electrical resistance meters that
can more accurately pinpoint a woman’s fertile period. The cervical mucus
method, also called the Billings method, depends on a woman recognizing the
changes in cervical mucus that indicate ovulation is occurring or has occurred.

SURGICAL STERILIZATION
Tubal ligation seals a woman’s fallopian tubes so that an egg cannot travel to
the uterus. Vasectomy involves closing off a man’s vas deferens so that sperm
will not be carried to the penis. Vasectomy is a minor surgical procedure, most
often performed in a doctor’s office under local anesthesia. Tubal ligation is an
operating room procedure performed under general anesthesia. Major complications, which are rare in female sterilization, include infection, hemorrhage,
and problems associated with the use of general anesthesia. The failure rate is
less than 1%. Although there has been some success in reopening the fallopian tubes and the vas deferens, the success rate is low, and sterilization should
be considered irreversible.

EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION
All female patients of reproductive age should be made aware of postcoital
contraception. This knowledge does not increase the likelihood of high-risk
behavior. The Yuzpe method consists of taking combined OCPs for emergency contraception. High doses of oral contraceptives, begun within 72 hours
of unprotected intercourse, decrease the risk of pregnancy by 74%. Only RU-486
(mifepristone) is effective after 72 hours. Consider prescribing an antiemetic, as
nausea and vomiting are common side effects. Two oral doses of levonorgestrel
(Plan B) 0.75 mg, with 12 hours between doses, is an effective and well-tolerated
regimen. Preven, a convenient emergency contraception kit, includes two
doses of medication and a pregnancy test. Mifepristone (RU-486) 600 mg in
a single dose is the most effective emergency contraceptive and has the fewest
side effects.

CLINICAL CASES

303

LEVONORGESTREL IMPLANTS
Levonorgestrel in Silastic capsules (Norplant) was the first contraceptive
implant. In a minor surgical procedure, six matchstick-size rubber capsules
containing progestin were placed just underneath the skin of the upper arm.
The implant was effective within 24 hours and provided progestin for up to
5 years. The failure rate for Norplant was less than 1% for women who weighed
less than 150 lb. The potential side effects of the implant included irregular
menstrual bleeding, headaches, nervousness, depression, nausea, dizziness,
skin rash, acne, change of appetite, breast tenderness, weight gain, enlargement of the ovaries or fallopian tubes, and excessive growth of body and facial
hair. Norplant is no longer manufactured.

pregnancy. Which of the following is the most appropriate method of
“emergency contraception”?
A. Yuzpe method
B. Plan B method
C. Insertion of an IUD
D. Intramuscular methotrexate

28.4

A 36-year-old woman is seeking contraception. She has delivered her
baby 8 weeks ago and is breast feeding. She undergoes a history and
physical examination, and is counseled regarding the various options.
She is healthy, drinks an occasional glass of wine per month, and
smokes half a pack of cigarettes per day. Her blood pressure is 140/98
mm Hg. The patient prefers the combination oral contraceptive
agent. However, her physician notes some findings that represent risks
for taking the oral conceptive. Which of the following is the most
important contraindication to OCPs in this patient?
A. History of hepatitis B infection
B. Family history of thromboembolism
C. Patient breast-feeding
D. Hypertension
E. Smoking status

ANSWERS
28.1

C. Known or suspected HIV infection is a contraindication to IUD
placement. IUDs can be used in selected nulliparous women and in
women who desire future fertility. A history of an STD is a relative,
but not an absolute, contraindication to IUD use. This patient has a
high likelihood of sexually transmitted infections, and thus, IUD is
contraindicated. Oral contraceptives and depot medroxyprogesterone
decreases the risk of PID by thickening the cervical mucus. Condom
use also decreases the risk of STI.

28.2

D. Approximately 8% of women will become pregnant after a single
act of coitus.

CLINICAL CASES

305

28.3

B. Emergency contraception may include combination hormonal
therapy at time zero and at 72 hours; many OCPs are effective if used
in the right doses and within 72 hours. Plan B is levonorgestrel and
is more effective than the combined OCPs for postcoital contraception. In addition, it does not have the prominent side effect of nausea. The IUD is relatively contraindicated in this patient because of
her history of Chlamydia infection.

28.4

E. Smoking over the age of 35 years is an absolute contraindication
to the combination OCP due to an increased risk of DVT, MI, and
stroke. A family history of thromboembolism is not a contraindication to OCP use as is a personal history. Hypertension with a BP
greater than 160/100 is another contraindication, whereas mildly
elevated blood pressure is not a contraindication; nevertheless the
blood pressure should be monitored. All women should be advised to
quit smoking.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The male latex condom remains the best shield against AIDS and other STDs.
➤ Barrier methods, which work by keeping the sperm and egg apart, usually
have only minor side effects.
➤ Combination oral contraceptives offer significant protection against ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, iron-deficiency anemia, PID, and fibrocystic
breast disease.
➤ Methods of hormonal contraception, when used properly, are extremely
effective.
➤ Surgical sterilization must be considered permanent. Vasectomy is considered safer than tubal ligation.
➤ Noncontraceptive benefits of combination oral contraceptives include
decreased incidence of benign breast disease, relief from menstrual disorders (dysmenorrhea and menorrhagia), reduced risk of uterine leiomyomata, protection against ovarian cysts, reduction of acne, improvement
of bone mineral density, and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer.

Case 29
A 16-year-old adolescent female presents for a routine well examination. She is a junior in high school and has no significant medical history. She plays on the school softball team and has a preparticipation
clearance form for you to complete. She is accompanied by her mother
who wants to know if her daughter should start having routine gynecologic examinations as part of her routine checkup. She states that the
patient’s last tetanus shot was at the age of 5 years. She received all of
the routine childhood immunizations, including a complete hepatitis B
series, and had chickenpox when she was 6 years old. The mother
reports that there are no medical problems in the immediate family, but
that one of the patient’s cousins died at the age of 21 years of a sudden
cardiac death. When interviewed without the mother in the room, the
patient reports to you that she is generally happy, she gets As and Bs in
school, and has an active social life. She denies ever being involved in
sexual activity, or tobacco or drug use. She says that she will have a
“drink or two” at a party with her friends. On examination, her vital
signs are normal. Examination of her head and neck, lungs, abdomen,
skin, and musculoskeletal and nervous systems are normal. On cardiac
auscultation, you hear a 2/6 systolic murmur that gets louder when you
have her Valsalva. Peripheral pulses are strong and symmetric; there is
good capillary refill and no sign of cyanosis.

ANSWERS TO CASE 29:
Adolescent Health Maintenance
Summary: A healthy 16-year-old adolescent female presents for a routine
checkup and sports preparticipation examination. She is noted incidentally to
have a heart murmur.
➤

Recommended immunization: Tetanus-diphtheria-acellular pertussis
(Tdap) booster and meningococcal vaccination; consideration can be given
to starting the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine series as well.

➤

Recommended age to start routine Pap smears: Within 3 years of the
start of sexual activity or age 21, whichever comes first.

➤

Most common cause of sudden cardiac death in young athletes:
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be familiar with the recommendations of the Guidelines for Adolescent
Preventive Services (GAPS) for screening examinations and counseling in
adolescents.
2. Know the immunizations routinely recommended for adolescents and teenagers.
3. Know the components of and the rationale for performing sports preparticipation examinations

Considerations
This is a healthy adolescent female who comes in for a sports preparticipation
physical examination. This is also an opportunity for other health maintenance such as immunizations, screening for eating disorders, and education.
Her history is unremarkable, and she has a 2/6 systolic murmur which increases
with Valsalva. The history is the most important component to the sports physical examination. The focus should be on conditions that can lead to sudden
cardiac death, which are usually cardiovascular, most commonly hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Marfan syndrome is associated with aortic root dilation or dissection, hence stigmata of Marfan and family history is also important. The hallmark physical examination finding in HCM is a systolic murmur that decreases
in intensity with the athlete in the supine position (increased ventricular filling, decreased obstruction). This contrasts with functional outflow murmurs
common in athletes that increase in intensity upon lying down. The intensity

CLINICAL CASES

309

of the HCM murmur increases with the Valsalva maneuver (decreased ventricular filling, increased obstruction). Any athlete who has a systolic murmur
with an intensity of 3/6 or greater; a diastolic, holosystolic, or continuous
murmur; or any other murmur that the examiner finds suspicious should be
held from participation and referred to a cardiologist for evaluation. Most athletes with HCM are, however, asymptomatic. The individual in this case has
only a grade 2/6 murmur, but it is worrisome that it increases in intensity with
Valsalva. Most murmurs will decrease in intensity and duration with Valsalva.
For this reason, this patient may benefit from referral to cardiology.

APPROACH TO
Adolescent Health
DEFINITIONS
GUIDELINES FOR ADOLESCENT PREVENTIVE SERVICES (GAPS): A

series of recommendations regarding the delivery of health services, promotion of well-being, screening for common conditions, and provision of immunizations for adolescents and young adults between the ages of 11 and 21 years.
HPV VACCINE: An immunization against four high-risk strains of human
papillomavirus is available and recommended for adolescent girls and young
women, HPV subtypes 6 and 11 (prevent venereal warts) and 16 and 18 (prevent
a large fraction of cervical dysplasia/cancer). It is a series of three injections
over 6 months that has been shown to be efficacious at reducing the incidence
of genital warts and cervical cancer associated with the particular strains of
HPV that are included in the vaccine.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Adolescence is a time of physical, emotional, and psychosocial changes. It is
also a time of experimentation and, frequently, risk taking. Fortunately, adolescence is also a time of relatively good health for most. However, the
choices made during adolescence can affect both the short-and long-term
health of the patient. Addressing the unique healthcare needs of adolescents
can be difficult, as they may be more likely to present to the physician for
acute illness than for health maintenance. For this reason, physicians should
take the opportunity to consider age-appropriate health maintenance at each
encounter with an adolescent and young adult.
Numerous issues can serve as barriers to providing effective care to adolescent patients; one of these is confidentiality. Many adolescents believe that

310

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

physicians share any information provided with the parent. Consequently,
they may not volunteer information, such as sexual activity or use of tobacco,
alcohol, and drugs. One commonly used technique to address this is to take a
history with the parent in the room, to allow the parent to present any concerns, then interview the patient alone, to allow the patient to speak confidentially with the doctor. Physicians who treat adolescent patients should
have policies in place to ensure doctor–patient confidentiality while balancing the parent’s right to be involved with the child’s care. These policies
should be discussed with and agreed to by the patient and parent in advance,
so as to promote an honest, trusting, and therapeutic relationship.
The American Medical Association has published Guidelines for Adolescent
Preventive Services (GAPS), a series of recommendations regarding the delivery of health services, promotion of well-being, screening for common conditions, and provision of immunizations for adolescents and young adults between
the ages of 11 and 21 years. These services are intended to be delivered as part
of a series of annual health-care visits that address biomedical and psychosocial aspects of health and emphasize preventive services. These visits should
include at least three complete physical examinations, one in early adolescence
(age 11–14), one in middle adolescence (age 15–17), and one in late adolescence
(age 18–21).
The GAPS recommend counseling for both parents and adolescents. It
recommends that physicians provide guidance to parents on normal physical,
sexual, and emotional development, signs of physical and emotional problems,
parenting behaviors to promote health, and methods to help their child avoid
harmful behaviors. The adolescent patient should receive counseling annually
on their growth and development, injury prevention, healthy diet, exercise, and
avoidance of harmful substances (alcohol, tobacco, drugs, anabolic steroids).
Guidance should also emphasize responsible sexual behaviors, including abstinence and contraception, to reduce the risks of sexually transmitted diseases
(STDs) and pregnancy.
GAPS recommend the routine screening for several medical, behavioral,
and emotional conditions. All adolescents should be screened annually for
hypertension, with further evaluation and treatment for those whose blood
pressure is above the 90th percentile for their gender and age. All should be
screened annually for eating disorders and obesity. All should also be screened
for the use of tobacco (both cigarettes and smokeless tobacco), alcohol, and
other abusable substances. Routine toxicology screening, however, is not recommended. Lipid screening is recommended for those at above-average risk
based on a personal history of comorbid conditions or a family history of hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, or other vascular diseases. Tuberculosis (TB)
skin testing should be performed in those at high risk. These risks include having lived (or living) in a homeless shelter or in an area with a high prevalence
of TB, having been (or being) incarcerated, having been exposed to active TB,
and working in a health-care setting.

orientation, use of contraception, number of sexual partners, and history of
pregnancy or STDs. Sexually active females should be screened for gonorrhea and Chlamydia by cervical sampling. Cervical cancer screening should
also be performed in sexually active females. The United States Preventive
Services Task Force (USPSTF), in a 2003 guideline, states that screening for
cervical cancer with Pap smears should begin within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age 21 years, whichever comes first. Sexually active males can
be screened for presumptive gonorrhea and Chlamydia infections by urine
test for leukocyte esterase. Males and females at risk for HIV should be
offered confidential testing.
Other recommendations include screening all adolescents annually for
depression and risk of suicide, with appropriate management or referral of those
in need. All should also be questioned annually about emotional, physical, or
sexual abuse. Every state mandates the reporting of suspected abuse of minors to
the designated child welfare agency or child protective service. Difficulties at
school or with learning should also be evaluated annually, with subsequent
management to be coordinated with the school and parent/guardian.
The adolescent health visit is also a time to ensure that the patient is
appropriately immunized against preventable infections. In those who have
received the recommended primary series, a tetanus-diphtheria (Td) booster
is recommended at ages 11 to 12 years and then every 10 years thereafter.
Because of the continued risk for infection with pertussis, a Tdap is recommended in place of one Td booster for adolescents and adults. Varicella vaccine should be offered to those who have not been vaccinated and who do not
have a history of chickenpox. A measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) booster
should be given if the patient did not receive a booster at ages 4 to 6 years.
The hepatitis B series should be given to any adolescent who has not been
previously immunized. Hepatitis A vaccine can be offered to those who live
in areas with high infection rates, travel to high-risk areas, have chronic liver
disease, or inject IV drugs, and to males who have sex with males.
In 2005, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory
Committee on Immunization Practices added a new recommendation for routine meningococcal vaccination using a tetravalent polysaccharide-protein
conjugate vaccine (MCV4). Routine vaccination is recommended at ages 11
to 12 years. If not previously vaccinated, vaccination before high school is advised.
Vaccination is also recommended for college freshmen living in dormitories
and for others at increased risk, such as military recruits, travelers to endemic
areas, or the functionally/anatomically asplenic.
A vaccination against four high-risk strains of human papillomavirus is
available and recommended for adolescent girls and young women. It is a
series of three injections over 6 months that has been shown to be efficacious
at reducing the incidence of genital warts and cervical cancer associated with
the particular strains of HPV that are included in the vaccine. It is preferred

312

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

to provide this vaccination prior to the onset of sexual activity, so the series
can be started in girls as young as 9 years old, but it is routinely recommended
for the ages of 11 to 12. It is also recommended for females aged 13 to 26 who
have not completed the vaccine series. The HPV vaccine is also useful for
those who have started sexual activity, as it may protect against strains of
HPV to which the patient has not been exposed.

SPORTS PREPARTICIPATION EXAMINATION
A common reason for healthy adolescents to present to primary care physicians is for a preparticipation examination as a requirement to play a sport in
school. The goal of these examinations is to attempt to identify conditions
that may place a young athlete at risk during athletic participation. These
conditions are primarily cardiac and orthopedic, but are not limited to these
systems. A preparticipation examination allows the physician to provide the
comprehensive health maintenance, including counseling, anticipatory guidance, screening, and vaccination, recommended in the GAPS guidelines.
These encounters also serve to meet legal and insurance requirements of the
school or school system.
The rate of sudden cardiac death in athletes is very low. Congenital cardiac anomalies are the most common etiology, with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy accounting for about one-third and anomalous coronary arteries for
about one-fifth of cardiac anomalies. The history is the most important tool
in screening for these abnormalities. All adolescents and their parents
should be asked about personal history of exertional chest pain, dyspnea, syncope, history of heart murmurs, and family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, other congenital cardiac abnormalities, or premature cardiac deaths.
Other important historical information includes history of asthma or other
pulmonary disorders, orthopedic injuries, heat-related illness, and absence of
one of a paired organ (eg, single kidney, testicle, ovary, etc).
It is important to screen for eating disorders, as well as for a desire to
change body weight, either for body image or for athletic purposes (eg,
“weight cutting” for wrestlers). Eating disorders are more common in female
than male athletes. Females should be questioned about menstrual irregularities, as amenorrhea could signal anorexia and amenorrheic female athletes
could be at risk for osteoporosis.
The examination should be thorough, but several aspects should be emphasized. Blood pressure should be measured and compared with age-and genderappropriate norms. General appearance, specifically looking for signs of Marfan
syndrome, should be noted. These signs, which include arachnodactyly, an arm
span greater than height, pectus excavatum, tall-thin habitus, high-arched
palate, and ocular lens subluxations, should prompt further evaluation, as persons with Marfan can have aortic abnormalities that predispose to rupture during sports. Auscultation of the heart should be performed, at minimum, in both

CLINICAL CASES

the lying and standing positions. The murmur of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, while not always present, is best heard along the left sternal border and
accentuates with activities that decrease cardiac preload and end diastolic volume of the left ventricle. Therefore, standing or straining with a Valsalva
maneuver would increase the murmur; conversely, squatting would be expected
to decrease the murmur. Any adolescent with stigmata of Marfan syndrome, a
murmur suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with a grade 3/6 or
louder systolic murmur, or any diastolic murmur should be evaluated by a
cardiologist prior to clearance for athletic participation.
No specific tests are recommended for universal screening of all athletes,
although specific tests may be indicated based upon history or physical examination findings. Echocardiography is the study of choice for the diagnosis of
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.
Participation in athletics or exercise should be encouraged. Absolute contraindications to all athletic participation are rare; more commonly, clearance to participate may be delayed for further evaluation of a suspected
condition, rehabilitation of an injury, or recovery from an acute illness. In
almost all cases, an adolescent should be able to find some athletic pursuit in
which the he/she may participate.

Comprehension Questions

A high school student is being seen for a sports preparticipation examination. Which of the following should prompt a referral to a cardiologist prior to clearance to participate in high school sports?
A. Grade 2/6 systolic murmur in an asymptomatic 16-year-old adolescent female
B. Grade 1/6 diastolic murmur heard at the apex in a 17-year-old adolescent female
C. Grade 2/6 systolic murmur in a 17-year-old adolescent male that is
heard while lying down and that gets softer when standing

A 15-year-old girl is brought in by her mother for a wellness clearance
for sports participation at school. She would also like to discuss the
addition of birth control. When the mother leaves the room you learn
that the girl is not sexually active but wants to start OCPs because she
has heard they help with acne and her friends have seen improvement.
She does not drink alcohol or smoke and is in honors classes in the ninth
grade. She plays on the junior varsity softball team and eats most days in
the school cafeteria. Which of the following is recommended routinely
in the Guidelines for Adolescent Preventive Services and should be performed at this time?
A. Annual complete physical examinations between the ages of 11 and
21 years
B. Periodic screening for drug use with a urine toxicology test
C. Cholesterol testing
D. Annual screening for hypertension

29.3

A 17-year-old adolescent male reports that he has been sexually active
with two female partners in the past year. He has used condoms “sometimes, but not always.” He is asymptomatic and has a normal physical
examination. Which of the following tests would be recommended to
screen him for gonorrhea and Chlamydia?
A. Urethral swab
B. Serum antibodies to Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis
C. Urine for leukocyte esterase
D. No screening is recommended

ANSWERS
29.1

B. Any patient with a diastolic murmur, grade 3/6 or louder systolic
murmur, murmur suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or
signs of Marfan syndrome should be evaluated by a cardiologist prior
to clearance to participate in athletics. The murmur of hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy typically gets louder with maneuvers that reduce
preload, such as the Valsalva maneuver or when standing.

29.2

D. GAPS recommend annual screening for hypertension by blood
pressure measurement in all adolescents. Complete physical examinations are advised routinely, once during early adolescence, once in
midadolescence, and once in late adolescence, as well as more often
when indicated. Lipid screening should be targeted to those who are
at high risk based on personal or family history. Routine toxicology
screening is not recommended.

29.3

C. Urine for leukocyte esterase is recommended as screening for presumptive gonorrhea or Chlamydia in sexually active males. A urethral swab is more appropriate for diagnostic testing in a male who
has a urethral discharge.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Adolescents tend to see physicians irregularly. Take the time at each visit,
no matter what the chief complaint is, to review health maintenance
issues.
➤ True contraindications to participation in all sports are rare. Almost everyone should be able to participate in some form of athletic activity.
➤ Universal adolescent vaccination with meningococcal vaccine became a
recommendation in 2005; unvaccinated adolescents and teens should be
offered vaccination routinely.

Case 30
A 47-year-old man presents to your office for a follow-up visit. He was
seen 3 weeks ago for an upper respiratory infection and noted incidentally to have a blood pressure of 164/98 mm Hg. He vaguely remembered
being told in the past that his blood pressure was “borderline.” He feels
fine, has no complaints, and his review of systems is entirely negative.
He does not smoke cigarettes, drinks “a couple of beers on the weekends,” and does not exercise regularly. He has a sedentary job. His father
died of a stroke at the age of 69 years. His mother is alive and in good
health at the age of 72 years. He has two siblings and is not aware of any
chronic medical issues that they have. In the office today, his blood
pressure is 156/96 mm Hg in his left arm and 152/98 mm Hg in the right
arm. He is afebrile, his pulse is 78 bpm, respiratory rate 14 breaths per
minute, he is 70 in tall, and weighs 210 lb. A general physical examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 30:
Hypertension
Summary: A 47-year-old man is found to have an elevated blood pressure
reading when seen for an unrelated problem visit. On follow-up, his blood
pressure remains elevated. He is obese and leads a sedentary lifestyle but does
not have other high risks based on his personal or family history.
➤

Diagnoses: Stage 1 hypertension and obesity.

➤

Necessary further evaluation: Blood glucose; serum potassium, creatinine,
and calcium levels; hematocrit; urinalysis; electrocardiogram (ECG).

➤

Nonpharmacologic interventions: DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension) diet; alcohol limitation to no more than two drinks per day;
increased physical activity; weight reduction.

➤

Recommended initial medication: Thiazide diuretic.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the diagnostic criteria for hypertension.
2. Learn the recommended initial evaluation of persons found with an elevated blood pressure.
3. Know the medication and lifestyle modifications that can help to control
blood pressure.
4. Learn the complications and risks of uncontrolled hypertension.

Considerations
The patient presented here is typical of one seen every day in primary care
offices and represents the most common presentation of hypertension. Most
hypertensive patients do not have any symptoms of their disease. They are
typically seen for another reason and noted to have a high blood pressure
reading. Untreated hypertension significantly raises an individual’s risk of
myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents, and renal failure, among
other conditions. The risk of cardiovascular disease doubles with each
increase in blood pressure of 20/10 mm Hg above 115/75 mm Hg. Because
of the high prevalence of the problem, the lack of symptoms and the demonstrated efficacy of treatment in reducing the risk of complications, the United
States Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening every adult

CLINICAL CASES

319

patient for hypertension by measuring their blood pressure. The appropriate
screening interval is not clearly defined, but most practitioners will check the
blood pressure of every adult patient at every office visit.

APPROACH TO
Hypertension
DEFINITIONS
JNC 7: The seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,

Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. A comprehensive, evidence-based, expert review of the diagnosis, evaluation, and management of hypertension (available at: www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/hypertension/
express.pdf).
PREHYPERTENSION: Blood pressure between 120 and 139 mm Hg systolic
and 80 and 89 mm Hg diastolic.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Hypertension is the most common primary diagnosis at physician office visits
in the United States each year. Approximately 50 million Americans have
hypertension and approximately 30% are unaware of their problem. The
prevalence is higher in African Americans and in older patients. National
Health and Nutritional Examination Surveys (NHANES) data suggest that
hypertension is responsible for approximately one-third of heart attacks, onehalf of heart failure, and one-fourth of premature deaths. Most patients with
end-stage kidney disease are hypertensive. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is
responsible for approximately one-fourth of end-stage kidney disease. The risk
of complications is directly related to the elevation of the blood pressure—
the higher the blood pressure, the higher the risk.
Elevated systolic blood pressure is a greater risk for cardiovascular disease complications than elevated diastolic pressure. Control of systolic blood
pressure tends to be more difficult to achieve, and when it is achieved, the
diastolic blood pressure usually comes under control as well. The goal of treatment is to get the blood pressure to less than 140/90 mm Hg. For persons with
diabetes or kidney disease, the goal is to achieve a blood pressure of less than
130/80 mm Hg.

Diagnosis and Workup
The diagnosis of hypertension relies on accurate measurement of blood pressure. The appropriate technique is to allow the patient to sit quietly in a chair

320

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

(not on the examination table) with a supported back and feet on the floor
for 5 minutes prior to making the measurement. The blood pressure should be
measured at least twice, using a calibrated sphygmomanometer and an appropriately sized cuff for the patient. The blood pressure cuff should encircle at
least 80% of the patient’s arm; a cuff that is too small can result in a falsely
elevated reading.
The diagnosis of hypertension is made based on the average of two properly taken blood pressure measurements at two or more office visits. JNC 7
places blood pressure readings into one of four categories: normal, prehypertension, stage 1 hypertension, and stage 2 hypertension (Table 30–1). The prehypertension category was a new addition in JNC 7, in recognition of the fact
that people with blood pressure in this range have twice the risk of progression to overt hypertension as those with normal blood pressure.
When hypertension is diagnosed, an evaluation consisting of a history,
physical examination, and focused diagnostic studies should be performed,
with the goals of assessing overall cardiovascular risks, identification of possibly secondary causes of hypertension, and determination of the presence of
any end-organ damage. Historical information should include personal and
family medical histories, an assessment of diet and activity levels, and specific
questioning regarding tobacco, alcohol, recreational drug, and medication (both
prescription and nonprescription) use. Patients should be questioned about cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral arterial disease symptoms.
Along with blood pressure, examination should include all other vital signs
and a measurement of body mass index. Other specific components of the
examination should include a funduscopic examination for signs of retinopathy, auscultation for carotid, femoral, and renal bruits, palpation of peripheral
pulses, abdominal palpation for signs of organomegaly or aortic aneurysm, and
a complete cardiopulmonary examination.
Initial testing should include measurement of serum potassium, creatinine
(with glomerular filtration rate calculation) and calcium, blood glucose, and

hematocrit. A urinalysis should be done to look for proteinuria or cellular
components suggestive of renal disease. An ECG should be performed to evaluate for changes consistent with coronary artery disease and to screen for left
ventricular hypertrophy (LVH).

Nonpharmacologic Management
Once the diagnosis of hypertension or prehypertension is made, patients
should be advised of specific lifestyle modifications that can both reduce their
blood pressure and reduce their overall cardiac risk factors. These should
include efforts to lose weight if overweight or obese, an increase in physical
activity, and reduced consumption of alcohol. Men should consume no more
than two alcoholic beverages a day and women no more than one. Any smoker
should be counseled to quit.
A high-potassium and high-calcium diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop
Hypertension (DASH) diet plan, reduces blood pressure in an amount
comparable to single-agent drug therapy. An informational brochure detailing the DASH diet is available from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/public/heart/hbp/dash/new_dash.pdf.
Combining the various lifestyle modifications provides additive benefits, and
these efforts should continue even when the decision is made to start medications.

Pharmacologic Management
Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of adverse outcomes such as strokes
and heart attacks. In the primary treatment of hypertension, thiazide diuretics are the recommended first-line therapy in most settings, because they are
well-tolerated, inexpensive, and no other medication has superior outcomes
in head-to-head studies. Patients with stage 1 hypertension, who are inadequately controlled with nonpharmacologic interventions alone, should be
started on a thiazide diuretic, unless there is a compelling reason to start
another class of medication (Table 30–2). Patients with stage 2 hypertension
or anyone whose blood pressure is above the recommended goal by less than
or equal to 20/10 mm Hg should be started on combination therapy with two
medications given either as separate prescriptions or as a fixed-dose combination of medications.

A 62-year-old woman presents for a routine physical examination. She
is asymptomatic and is not taking any medications. Her blood pressure
is found to be 135/85 mm Hg on two readings. Review of her chart
reveals that her blood pressure was 133/84 mm Hg on a visit 4 months
ago for a urinary tract infection. Which of the following is the most
accurate statement regarding her blood pressure?
A. Her blood pressure is normal and she is at average risk for developing
hypertension.
B. She has prehypertension and is at high risk for developing hypertension.
C. She has stage 1 hypertension and should be started on a thiazide
diuretic.
D. She has stage 2 hypertension and should be started on multidrug
therapy.

A 66-year-old woman has an average blood pressure of 150/70 mm Hg
despite appropriate lifestyle modification efforts. Her only other medical problems are osteoporosis and mild depression. Her last lipid panel
revealed a total cholesterol of 160 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) 40 mg/dL, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 90 mg/dL. Which
of the following would be the most appropriate treatment at this time?
A. Lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril)
B. Propranolol (Inderal)
C. Amlodipine (Norvasc)

At a routine check-up a 6-year-old boy is found to have a blood pressure
of 130/90 mm Hg. Repeated blood pressure readings are consistently elevated. The child was delivered at 36 weeks by normal spontaneous vaginal delivery with no complications. All major milestones were met on
time and he currently is enrolled in first grade. The child has been healthy
up until this point. Which of the following is the most appropriate diagnosis and therapeutic step?
A. The child has essential hypertension and should be started on the
DASH diet.
B. The child most likely has hyperthyroidism and should be started
on a β-blocker while thyroid studies are performed.
C. The child most likely has renal parenchymal disease and should
have a urinalysis and renal ultrasound ordered.
D. The child most likely has “white coat” hypertension and the readings should be ignored if there is no family history of hypertension.
E. The child most likely has a pheochromocytoma and should start a
24-hour urine collection for metanephrines.

ANSWERS
30.1

B. This patient’s blood pressure falls in the prehypertensive range.
She is at increased risk for developing hypertension and may benefit
from the institution of lifestyle modifications to try to reduce her risk
of progression.

30.2

D. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have shown that isolated
systolic hypertension in the elderly responds best to diuretics, and to
a lesser extent β-blockers. Diuretics are preferred, although long-acting
dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers may also be used. In this case,
β-blockers or clonidine may worsen the depression. Thiazide diuretics
may also improve osteoporosis, and would be the most cost-effective
and useful agent in this instance.

30.3

D. This patient’s blood pressure goal is less than 130/80 mm Hg. He
is greater than 20/10 mm Hg above this goal, so a combination of
medications is the most appropriate initial therapy regardless of BMI
or HbA1c. Refractoriness for 6 months symbolizes that he is past the
point of management with diet and exercise.

30.4

C. Essential hypertension is rarely found in children less than 10 years
of age and should be a diagnosis of exclusion. The most common
cause of hypertension is renal parenchymal disease, and a urinalysis,
urine culture, and renal ultrasonography should be ordered for all
children presenting with hypertension.

CLINICAL CASES

325

Clinical Pearls
➤ Check every adult patient’s blood pressure at every office visit.
➤ Thiazide diuretics should be the first-line drug treatment in almost all
cases of hypertension. There should be a compelling reason to use another
agent before a thiazide.
➤ All patients with hypertension are at risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease. Be sure to address their other significant risks for
these diseases, including lipids, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.

Case 31
The mother of a 12-month-old male infant calls you at midnight stating
that her son has been crying incessantly for the last 6 hours. His bouts
of crying last for about 20 minutes, then completely disappear for
15 minutes at a time. Since early afternoon the child has not been eating
much and he has started to vomit the small amounts of juice and milk
he had ingested. She decided to call you because the vomitus is now
green and the bouts of crying seem to be getting worse.
In the emergency room, you recall that the patient does not have any
past medical history, was born at term without complications, and is up
to date on immunizations. On examination his temperature is 100°F
(37.7°C), his respiration rate is 40 breaths per minute, his pulse is 155 bpm,
his blood pressure is 109/60 mm Hg, and his weight is 22 lb. He cries inconsolably for 15 minutes, drawing his legs up to his chest, then becomes
quiet. You notice he still produces tears, and his mucosae are moist. Heart
and lung examinations are normal; abdominal examination reveals
markedly decreased bowel sounds with generalized tenderness to palpation. You feel a sausagelike mass in the right side of the abdomen. His
diaper holds some amount of bloody stool mixed with mucus. The rest of
the examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 31:
Abdominal Pain and Vomiting in a Child
Summary: This is a 12-month-old infant who had the sudden onset of intermittent crying with vomiting that later became bilious. As the day progressed,
his bouts of pain became more severe, each lasting about 20 minutes. On
examination, the infant does not yet reveal signs of hypovolemia, sepsis, or
shock. On palpation of the abdomen, there is generalized tenderness and a
sausagelike mass on the right side. Even though not mentioned by the parent,
there is a small amount of bloody-mucous stool that is best described as “currant jelly.” This patient has an intussusception that has progressed to an
obstruction, and is at risk for perforation with ensuing shock and sepsis.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Intestinal obstruction caused by intussusception.

➤

Next diagnostic step: Abdominal plain x-rays to rule out perforation.

➤

Possible complications: If perforation occurs, rapid deterioration as a consequence of shock/sepsis.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Become familiar with the most likely causes of intestinal obstruction in the
pediatric population.
2. Learn to differentiate between life-threatening abdominal emergencies and
urgent conditions.
3. Have a diagnostic approach to the pediatric patient presenting with abdominal pain and vomiting.

Considerations
This 12-month-old infant initially presented with vomiting and intermittent
abdominal pain. His vomitus was initially the gastric contents of what he had
ingested, but later became bilious, which is suggestive of intestinal obstruction. The description of his abdominal pain tends to reveal the pathophysiologic nature of intussusception. The intermittency and “pain-free” intervals
correlate with the gradual and slow telescoping of the intussusceptum (proximal or leading part of the intestine) into the intussuscipiens (distal or receiving end of the intestine). As the “telescoping” progresses, the portions of
bowel that are trapped within the lumen of the intestine become edematous,
which will ultimately lead to obstruction, ischemia, and perforation of the

CLINICAL CASES

329

bowel wall. Malrotation with volvulus will also present with a clinical picture
of obstruction, and it may be difficult to differentiate among the two solely on
clinical findings.
The sausage-shaped mass felt on examination will not be present in all
cases. It represents the portions of bowel that are involved and have become
edematous. Another common condition that may reveal a palpable mass is
that of pyloric stenosis, with an olive-shaped mass sometimes palpable in the
right upper quadrant of epigastrium. However, pyloric stenosis presents in
younger patients and does not involve bouts of severe pain. “Currant jelly”
stools are basically a mixture of blood and mucus that has sloughed from the
affected bowel wall. This is not present in all cases.
Before proceeding to diagnostics, the patient should be stabilized with
IV fluid hydration and surgery consultation should not be delayed. A nasogastric tube may need to be placed if obstruction is suspected. A plain film of
the abdomen is done to rule out perforation. If perforation has occurred, surgical intervention is required. If no perforation is evidenced, an ultrasound of
the abdomen may reveal a “coiled spring” lesion, which reflects layers of intestine within the lumen of a different portion of intestine. However, a barium
enema will be both diagnostic and therapeutic in the case of intussusception. Although barium is widely used, a water-soluble contrast is preferred if
perforation is suspected, because it will not be as irritating to the peritoneum.
The therapeutic value of the enema is a result of the constant application of
hydrostatic pressure on the intussusceptum, mechanically forcing it to telescope back. Air reduction may also be achieved. This method requires fluoroscopic visualization of bowel-gas patterns until reduction of the intussusceptum
is seen. Barium or air reduction is effective in 75% to 90% of cases, after
which a 12 to 24-hour observation period is needed until bowel function is
adequate and a bowel movement has been produced. The risk of recurrence
in this patient with idiopathic intussusception is approximately 10%.

APPROACH TO
Pediatric Abdominal Pain with Vomiting
DEFINITIONS
INTUSSECEPTION: A telescoping of the intestine within itself leading to
abdominal pain, fever, vomiting, and ultimately bowel necrosis if not resolved.
HYPERTROPHIC PYLORIC STENOSIS: Condition of hypertrophy of the
pylorus leading to gastric outlet obstruction, commonly manifesting in infants
at about 1 month of age.

330

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLINICAL APPROACH
The most important aspect of a diagnostic approach in these cases is to be able to
rapidly determine whether or not the condition is an emergency. Although the
case presented is that of the most common abdominal emergency among the
pediatric population, it is by no means the most common cause of intestinal
obstruction. Among the diagnoses that have to be entertained are hypertrophic pyloric stenosis, malrotation with volvulus/obstruction, foreign-body
ingestion, and poisoning.

Etiologies
As described, intussusception will present with intermittent, severe abdominal pain, associated with vomiting that becomes bilious as obstruction sets in.
The finding of an elongated mass along the right abdomen is very suggestive of
this diagnosis. The location of the mass is because most idiopathic intussusceptions occur at the ileocecal junction. They may be entirely in the jejunum,
between the jejunum and ileum, or entirely colonic. Currant jelly stool is most
often used to describe the finding in this condition and it correlates with the
ongoing bowel ischemia as the intussusception and edema progress.
Hypertrophic pyloric stenosis is the most common cause of GI obstruction. It occurs in approximately 3 in 1000 live births, with a male-to-female
ratio of 4:1. The usual presenting age is 3 to 6 weeks old, and is often described
as a “hungry baby” with projectile vomiting. Vomiting is nonbilious and occurs
immediately after meals. The infant will demand to be refed immediately. On
examination, there may be an olive-shaped mass felt in the right upper quadrant, and peristaltic waves may be seen across the upper abdomen moments
before emesis occurs. Ultrasonography shows the thickened pyloric muscles
that are causing a gastric outlet obstruction. An upper GI contrast study usually reveals an elongated pyloric canal and a “double-track sign,” which is
explained by two thin tracts of barium that are created by compressed pyloric
mucosa. Once the diagnosis is made, surgical referral is indicated as it is the
definitive management. Because of the early age and dramatic nature of the
symptoms, parents will usually seek help before the infant becomes severely ill
from not eating.
Malrotation occurs in about 1 in 500 live births, but becomes symptomatic
in only 1 in 6000 live births. Approximately 60% of patients will be younger
than 1 month of age, with approximately 10% presenting after 1 year of age,
even into adulthood. Because it is primarily a defect that occurs during
embryogenesis, the mesentery that is formed will have an abnormally narrow
base, which allows the small bowel to move more freely than normal. This
creates a problem when the intestinal attachment to the mesentery twists
around itself, creating a volvulus. Once obstruction occurs, the child will
present with bilious vomiting and abdominal pain. If diagnosis is delayed,

CLINICAL CASES

the involved segments of bowel will eventually become necrotic, leading to
fluid losses and sepsis. The diagnostic approach in such cases will depend on
the stability of the patient. If the patient is hypovolemic, hypotensive, has GI
blood loss, or has signs of peritonitis, quick stabilization with surgical intervention is necessary. However, if the patient is hemodynamically stable, imaging can be performed to confirm a diagnosis. If malrotation is suspected, an
upper GI series is the test of choice. In 75% of patients, the diagnosis will
be clearly seen. Diagnostic findings on an upper GI are an obviously misplaced
duodenum, or a duodenal obstruction with the classic “beaklike” appearance of
the contrast medium caused by a volvulus. Surgery is the only treatment.
Although different surgical techniques are applied to prevent a recurrence, a
volvulus can repeat itself in as many as 8% of patients. Malrotation can go undiagnosed if a patient never experiences symptoms from it, and older children
may present with intermittent vomiting, episodes of abdominal pain, failure to
thrive, or syndromes of malabsorption.
Foreign bodies also need to be considered with abdominal pain and vomiting in a pediatric patient. Only 10% of patients that ingest a foreign body
will need an intervention either to relieve an obstruction or to prevent GI
complications. Approximately 90% of patients will pass a foreign body spontaneously, and parents need only check the stool within 24 hours to confirm
passage. Sometimes, if an object can be seen on plain radiographs, a repeat x-ray
within 24 hours can be done. Among objects that require immediate intervention are flat disk, or “button,” batteries in the esophagus. These batteries will conduct electricity when both poles are in contact with the esophageal
wall, which will lead to perforation. Sharp objects also need to be removed. As
a general rule, any foreign body in the esophagus needs to be removed in less
than 24 hours by upper endoscopy. If a sharp or elongated object (>6 cm) has
already passed through the stomach and duodenum, daily x-rays should be
done to follow the progress of the object. Those that do not advance within 3 days
will require surgical intervention for removal.
Poisoning cannot be overlooked in the evaluation of a child with vomiting
and abdominal pain. Among the multiple agents most commonly associated
with hospital visits are over-the-counter (OTC) analgesic drugs, cold remedies,
insecticides, pesticides, personal care products, and fumes. In a child who presents with vomiting and abdominal pain, a cholinergic syndrome is likely. It is
characterized by salivation, lacrimation, diarrhea, vomiting, diaphoresis, intestinal cramps, and seizures. Insecticides and nicotine are among the agents that
may induce these symptoms. Antihistamines or tricyclic antidepressants produce dry skin, dry mucosae, urinary retention, and decreased bowel sounds
(anticholinergic syndrome). Some medications and substances are radiopaque,
such as iron tablets, mercury, lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, Play-Doh, and
enteric-coated aspirin. Finding the likely agent of poisoning will mostly depend
on the history given.

332

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Treatment
Surgical intervention will almost always be necessary if an anatomical/mechanical
defect of the GI tract is present. Intestinal obstruction puts a patient at risk
for perforation, which further deteriorates a patient’s condition. A nasogastric
tube is recommended in cases where obstruction has set in and the patient is
ill. Careful monitoring of the patient’s fluid status is required because of the
likelihood of third spacing into ischemic bowel and decreased oral intake.

Comprehension Questions
Match the following etiologies (A—F) to the clinical vignette [31.1-31.6]:
A. Malrotation with intermittent volvulus
B. Intussusception
C. Insecticide ingestion
D. Esophageal foreign body
E. Pyloric stenosis
F. Volvulus
31.1

A 6-year-old boy left alone for 10 hours, now with hematemesis and
pneumomediastinum on chest x-ray.

31.2

A 3-week-old male infant with 2 days of projectile, nonbilious vomiting and constant feeding.

31.3

A 7-year-old boy with three episodes of severe abdominal pain and
vomiting in the last month, previously diagnosed with failure to
thrive.

31.4

An 8-month-old girl with bilious vomiting, constant abdominal pain
for 12 hours, and upper GI study showing beaklike appearance of contrast.

31.5

An 11-month-old boy with intermittent bouts of crying and nonbilious vomiting, with a history of Meckel diverticulum. A small, elongated mass is felt on right side of his abdomen.

31.6

A 4-year-old girl with profuse vomiting, sweating, lacrimation, and
diarrhea, who seizes in the emergency room.

ANSWERS
31.1

D. The presence of blood in the vomitus and a pneumomediastinum
point to an esophageal perforation, most likely from a foreign body
in the esophagus.

CLINICAL CASES

333

31.2

E. The young age and presence of projectile, nonbilious vomiting
after feeding are the keys to this diagnosis. The diagnosis of pyloric
stenosis is much more common in males than females.

31.3

A. This is the presentation of a malrotation that did not cause
enough symptoms at a younger age to lead to a diagnosis.

31.4

F. An infant with bilious vomiting and abdominal pain has a volvulus until proven otherwise. The upper GI study is diagnostic of this
condition.

31.5

B. The intermittent nature of the symptoms and the palpable mass
are highly suggestive of intussusception.

31.6

C. These symptoms are characteristic of a cholinergic syndrome, possibly caused by insecticide or nicotine poisoning.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Most foreign-body ingestions by children will pass spontaneously, but button batteries and sharp objects in the esophagus should be removed
endoscopically.
➤ The risk of accidental poisoning with common household products and
over-the-counter medications should be a routine part of the anticipatory
guidance that occurs in a well-child visit.
➤ When a child appears critically ill, do not delay your resuscitative efforts or
surgical consultation while you wait for laboratory tests and x-ray results.

Case 32
An 83-year-old woman is brought to the clinic by her husband who was
concerned with his wife’s memory problems. He noticed some memory
decline a few years ago, but the onset was subtle and did not interfere
with her day-to-day activities. Mainly she has some difficulty remembering details, is repeating things, and is being forgetful. The patient’s family noticed her gradually increasing memory problems, particularly over
the past year. She is unable to remember her appointments and relies
heavily on written notes and appointments books. Recently she got lost
while driving and was found by her family 10 hours later. She was unable
to use her cell phone and was unsure about her home address and phone
number. She has also become more reclusive. She does not enjoy her
church activities anymore and prefers to stay at home most of the time.
She does not want to cook, and she is less attentive to her housework.
The patient says that she has always been forgetful. Her medical history
is significant for well-controlled hypertension and a history of mastectomy secondary to breast cancer diagnosed 20 years ago. She has no significant history of tobacco or alcohol use. She is independent with all
activities of daily living, but needs assistance with medication administration, banking, and transportation. She is up to date with her health
maintenance and immunization. Her vital signs and general physical
examination are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 32:
Dementia
Summary: An 83-year-old woman is noted by her family to have increasing
memory difficulties at home. She is forgetful, repeats questions, and does not
remember conversations. She had the very significant episode of getting lost
in her home town. She is seemingly unaware that there is a problem that is
slowly and progressively worsening.
➤

Most-likely diagnosis: Dementia of Alzheimer type.

➤

Office-based testing that may be beneficial: Folstein Mini-Mental Status
Examination is the most widely used instrument. Others available include
the Clock Test, the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire and the
Mini-Cog Test. In addition, a screening test for depression should be
performed.

➤

Laboratory testing and imaging studies: Screening for vitamin B12 and
hypothyroidism. Syphilis screening if there is a risk factor or evidence of
prior infection, or if patient lives in an area of high incidence. Noncontrast
head computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a differential diagnosis for dementia.
2. Learn how to appropriately evaluate a complaint of memory loss.
3. Learn about treatment of Alzheimer dementia, the most common specific
diagnosis of dementia.

Considerations
This 83-year-old woman is noted by her family to have progressive decrease in
cognitive function. She is forgetful, gets lost easily, and this has been slowly but
steadily worsening. The most likely diagnosis is dementia; however, other conditions should be considered in the differential diagnosis such as medications,
stroke, thyroid disorders, chronic syphilis, or other metabolic conditions.
Depression can also present as dementia at times. The workup for this patient
includes a careful history and physical examination, imaging of the brain, and
selective laboratory tests such as TSH, vitamin B12 level, CBC, and comprehensive metabolic panel. Screening for syphilis should also be considered.

337

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Dementia
DEFINITION
EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONS: High-level cognitive abilities that control other,

more basic, abilities. Executive functions include the ability to start and stop
behaviors, alter behaviors to fit circumstances, and adapt behaviors to new
situations.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The essential features of the diagnosis of dementia are a memory loss and
impairment of executive function. Dementia is a clinical diagnosis that can
go unrecognized until it is in an advanced stage. Patients rarely report memory loss; the informants are usually their family members. However, relatives
may fail to recognize signs and symptoms of dementia because many have a
tendency to think that memory loss can be a part of normal aging. Studies of
aging have showed that nonverbal creative thinking and new problemsolving strategies may decline with age, but information, skills learned with
experience, and memory retention remain intact.
Clinicians should assess cognitive function whenever cognitive impairment
or deterioration is suspected. These concerns may be based upon direct observation, patient report, or concerns raised by family members, friends, or caretakers.
Patients with dementia may have difficulty with one or more of the following:
•
•
•
•
•
•

Learning and retaining new information (rely on lists, calendars)
Handling complex tasks (banking, bills, payments)
Reasoning (adapting to unexpected situations, unfamiliar environment)
Spatial ability and orientation (getting loss driving, walking)
Language (word finding, repetition, confabulation)
Behavior (agitation, confusion, paranoia)

The evaluation of a patient with suspected dementia should include a
mental status examination. The Folstein Mini-Mental Status Examination
(MMSE) is the most widely used tool in the screening for dementia. The sensitivity of the MMSE for dementia is as high as 92% and the specificity is as
high as 96%. The interpretation of the score depends on the patient’s education level. It is most accurate in those with at least a high school education.
Another valuable test that can be used in a busy primary care setting is the
Clock Test. The patient is asked to draw a clock with a specific time. The
patient must then accurately draw the clock face with the “big hand” and “small
hand” in the correct positions. It is quick, easy to administer, and evaluates

338

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

executive function in multiple cognitive domains. Other cognitive screening
tests, such as the Short Portable Mental Status Questionnaire, Modified MMSE,
and Mini-Cog (three-item recall combined with clock drawing) are less popular
in primary care setting.
In the evaluation of dementia, it is necessary to get information from people who know the patient well. Useful information can be obtained from
informant-based functional tests, such as the Functional Activities Questionnaire
(FAQ), the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), and Caregiver
Burden assessments. This information can be important for physicians and
families in making plans for long-term care.

ALZHEIMER DISEASE
Alzheimer disease is the most common cause of dementia. Although a definitive diagnosis can only be made by the presence of neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles detected on autopsy, clinical diagnostic criteria have been
developed (Tables 32–1 and 32–2). Common diagnostic criteria include the
gradual onset and progression of cognitive dysfunction in more than one
area of mental functioning that is not caused by another disorder.
The initial evaluation includes a detailed history, from both the patient
and another informant (usually a spouse, child, or other close contact) and
complete physical and neurologic examinations to evaluate for any focal neurologic deficit that may be suggestive of a focal neurologic lesion. A validated
test, such as the MMSE, should be used to confirm the presence of dementia.
The results of this test can also be used to follow the clinical course, as a
reduction in score over time is consistent with worsening dementia.

Table 32–1 DSM-IV CRITERIA FOR ALZHEIMER DISEASE
Development of multiple cognitive deficits manifested by both memory impairment
and one of the following:
1. Aphasia: Loss of word comprehension ability.
2. Apraxia: Loss of ability to perform complex tasks involving muscle coordination.
3. Agnosia: Loss of ability to recognize and use familiar objects.
The deficits above are a decline from previous functioning and cause significant impairment
in social or occupational functioning.
The course is of gradual onset and continuing decline.
The deficits are not due to other central nervous system, systemic or substance-induced
conditions that cause deficits in cognition.
The disturbance is not accounted for by another psychiatric diagnosis.

Data from www.ninds.nih.gov.

A focused evaluation to rule out other causes of dementia must be performed as well. Depression in the elderly can present with symptoms of
memory disturbance. This is known as “pseudodementia.” As depression is
common and treatable, a screening test for depression should be performed
when dementia is evaluated. Similarly, hypothyroidism and vitamin B12 deficiency are common and treatable conditions that can cause cognitive problems. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and vitamin B12 levels should be
performed as a routine part of the workup. Neurosyphilis could present in this
fashion, but is such an uncommon diagnosis that routine screening would not
be recommended. Evaluation for neurosyphilis would be warranted if there
were identified high-risk factors, history of the disease, or if the patient lived
in an area with a high prevalence of syphilis. Neuroimaging with either a noncontrast CT scan or an MRI of the brain is recommended to rule out other
confounding diagnoses. Other testing, such as positron emission tomography
(PET), genetic testing, and spinal fluid analysis are not routinely recommended.
When the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease is made, a comprehensive care
plan should be initiated. The management of Alzheimer disease must be
directed both at the patient and at the patient’s family or caregivers. The
goals of therapy are to maximize the cognition, delay functional decline, and
prevent or improve the behavioral disturbances.
Table 32–3 lists the medications that are primarily used in the treatment
of Alzheimer disease. Family members should understand that the medications may delay the progression of the disease but may not reverse any
decline that has already occurred. For that reason, the medications may be
more beneficial if started earlier in the course of the disease. Antipsychotic
medications have also been used to control hallucinations and agitation in
patients with Alzheimer disease. However, this is an “off-label” use of medication
and recent data show a higher death rate associated with the use of the newer
antipsychotics. The FDA has placed a black-box warning against the use of
antipsychotic medications for dementia-related psychosis due to the increased
risk of deaths.

Behavioral interventions also may be beneficial. These can include scheduled toileting in an effort to reduce episodes of incontinence, writing reminder
notes, keeping familiar objects around, providing adequate lighting, and making duplicates of important objects (eg, keys) in case they get lost. Caregivers
also need support and may benefit from appropriate training, support groups,
and periodic respite care.
Unfortunately, even with the best of care, Alzheimer disease is relentless
and progressive. Families may have significant difficulties and conflicts regarding issues surrounding end-of-life care and placement in assisted living or nursing homes. Resources such as local chapters of the Alzheimer Association
(www.alz.org) may provide valuable services, information, and support.

VASCULAR DEMENTIA
Vascular dementia, or multi-infarct dementia, is the second most common
cause of dementia. In vascular dementia, there is neuronal loss as a consequence of one or more strokes. The symptoms are related to the amount and
location of the neuronal loss. Vascular dementia can exist along with
Alzheimer disease or other causes of dementia, resulting in a mixed-dementia
syndrome. Unlike Alzheimer disease, which is a gradually progressive process,
vascular dementia often has a sudden onset and progresses in a stepwise

CLINICAL CASES

341

fashion. Patients tend to function at a certain level and then show an acute
deterioration when the initial, or subsequent, infarcts occur. The risk factors
include those for cerebrovascular disease (hypertension, tobacco use, diabetes,
etc). There are no controlled trials showing medication effectiveness in vascular dementia, so the treatment is aimed at reducing the risk of further neurologic damage.

OTHER ILLNESSES ASSOCIATED WITH DEMENTIA
Numerous other conditions may present with dementia or have dementia as a
prominent symptom. Parkinson disease commonly has an associated dementia, especially as the overall disease advances. Normal pressure hydrocephalus
causes the triad of dementia, gait disturbance, and urinary incontinence. Lewy
body dementia has symptoms similar to Alzheimer disease, but the dementia
has a fluctuating course and is often accompanied by hallucinations early in
the course of the disease. Dementia can be a complication of chronic alcohol
abuse, reinforcing the need for a complete history of substance use. Many prescription and over-the-counter medications can cause memory disturbances.
Chief among these are anticholinergic medications, sedatives (benzodiazepines),
sleeping pills, and narcotic pain medications. As noted previously, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, and neurosyphilis may present as dementing
illnesses. Metabolic abnormalities, such as hyponatremia or abnormal calcium
levels, and other infections, such as AIDS, can also cause dementia.

DELIRIUM
Delirium is an acute change in mental status that is characterized by fluctuations in levels of consciousness. It is usually caused by an acute medical
illness, the use of a medication, or the withdrawal from a drug or alcohol.
Delirium affects 10% to 30% of hospitalized patients, with a higher incidence
in the elderly, in those with an underlying dementia, and in those with multiple underlying medical conditions. The treatment of delirium is treatment
of the condition that precipitated it. Delirium is often reversible if the underlying cause can be found and aggressively managed. Patients with delirium
have significantly longer hospital stays and increased mortality rates.

medical conditions.
D. Give her a dose of ziprasidone (Geodon) for her hallucinations.

32.3

A 77-year-old man is brought to your office by his wife, who states that
he has been having mental difficulties in recent months, such as not
being able to balance their checkbook or plan for his annual visit with
the accountant. She also tells you that he has reported seeing animals
in the room with him that he can describe vividly. He takes frequent
naps and stares blankly for long periods of time. He seems almost normal at times, but randomly appears very confused at other times. He

patient walks slowly with a stooped posture and almost falls when
turning around. He has only minimal facial expressiveness. No tremor
is noted and the remainder of the examination is normal. He is able
to recall three words out of three, but clock drawing is abnormal.
Laboratory studies are normal and a CT of the brain shows changes of
aging. What type of dementia does this patient most likely have?
A. Dementia with Lewy bodies
B. Alzheimer disease
C. Frontotemporal dementia
D. Vascular dementia
E. Dementia of Parkinson disease

CLINICAL CASES

32.4

343

A 66-year-old woman is brought in by her family because of difficulty
with memory and disorientation that has worsened over the past 6 months.
A careful history and physical examination is performed. Which of the
following tests is most appropriate in this patient?
A. Head CT or MRI
B. Lumbar puncture
C. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR)
D. Electroencephalogram (EEG)

ANSWERS
32.1

B. Normal pressure hydrocephalus classically causes dementia, incontinence, and gait disturbance. All of the other listed conditions may
cause memory disturbance, but the constellation of these three symptoms is most consistent with normal-pressure hydrocephalus.

32.2

C. This scenario is one that is commonly seen in hospitals and is
consistent with delirium. The patient is elderly and has an infection,
causing both an acute change in her mental status and a fluctuating
level of consciousness. The treatment is to treat the underlying infection and any associated medical conditions.

32.3

A. This patient has dementia with Lewy bodies, which is the second
most common histopathologic type after Alzheimer disease. He
demonstrates typical signs and symptoms, including well-formed hallucinations, vivid dreams, fluctuating cognition, sleep disorder with
periods of daytime sleeping, frequent falls, deficits in visuospatial
ability (abnormal clock drawing), and REM sleep disorder (vivid
dreams). In Alzheimer disease, the predominant early symptom is
memory impairment without the other symptoms found in this
patient. In dementia of Parkinson disease, extrapyramidal symptoms
such as tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity precede the onset of memory impairment by more than 1 year. Frontotemporal dementia presents with behavioral changes, including disinhibition, or language
problems such as aphasia.

32.4

A. A noncontrast head CT or MRI is recommended by the American
Academy of Neurology for the routine evaluation of dementia. All
of the other tests may be appropriate if there is a finding on the history or examination that calls for further testing (an exposure to
syphilis, episodes suggestive of seizures, or symptoms of normal pressure hydrocephalus for which a spinal tap may be performed).

Clinical Pearls
➤ The presentation of acutely altered mental status (delirium) should
prompt an aggressive workup for an underlying cause, as treatment may
result in correction of the mental status.
➤ Alzheimer disease is a disease of the family, not just the individual. It is critical to treat the patient while giving support to the caregivers.

ANSWERS TO CASE 33:
Obesity
Summary: A 20-year-old obese woman presents for a routine examination.
Along with her abdominal obesity, she has irregular menstrual cycles, acanthosis nigricans, and hirsutism.
➤

Clinical issues to address: Obesity and possible polycystic ovarian disease.

➤

Next steps in evaluation: Calculate a body mass index (BMI), measure
waist circumference, repeat blood pressure. Order laboratory tests to measure
fasting glucose, lipids, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and liver
enzymes.

➤

Therapeutic options: Assess her interest in losing weight. If she is interested, devise weight-loss goals and advise on diet and physical activity to
achieve these goals. If she is not interested, advise on the health benefits of
weight loss and address other risk factors. In either case, arrange follow-up.
At subsequent visits, can consider adding pharmacotherapy as an adjunct to
diet and exercise.

4.

Understand the etiology and pathogenesis of obesity.
Know other comorbid conditions associated with obesity.
Learn the diagnostic criteria for obesity and the metabolic syndrome.
Understand the therapeutic options available for the management of obesity.

Considerations
Obesity is a chronic and stigmatizing disease that begins early in life. Routine
physical examination visits serve as a good platform to address issues related
to obesity and its associated comorbid conditions. In this case, this visit
should be taken as an opportunity to address obesity and its management.
Increased body weight is a major risk factor for the development of disease
and for premature death. In National Health and Nutritional Examination
Surveys (NHANES) III, the metabolic syndrome was present in 5% of those
at normal weight, 22% of those who were overweight, and 60% of those who
were obese. The metabolic syndrome is an important risk factor for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
In this case, this patient’s BMI is 33.5. Further measurements included a
waist circumference of 36 in and a repeat blood pressure of 125/85 mm Hg.

CLINICAL CASES

347

Her laboratory test results included total cholesterol of 202 mg/dL, highdensity lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol of 35 mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol of 120 mg/dL, and triglycerides of 172 mg/dL. Her fasting
glucose was 104 mg/dL, and she had normal renal and liver function tests. She
has metabolic syndrome based on her abdominal circumference, increased
triglycerides, low HDL, and mildly elevated LDL cholesterol levels. She may
also need further investigation for the presence of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) because of her obesity and history of irregular cycles.
Both the metabolic syndrome and PCOS are very closely associated with
obesity and insulin resistance. In this situation, the key clinical implication of
these diagnoses is identification of a patient needing aggressive lifestyle modification focused on weight reduction and increased physical activity.

APPROACH TO
Obesity
DEFINITIONS
BODY MASS INDEX (BMI): A measurement of the relative composition of lean
body mass and body fat; calculated as weight in kilograms/(height in meters)2.
METABOLIC SYNDROME: A state of insulin resistance characterized by
abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, elevated blood pressure, and impaired fasting
glucose.
OBESITY: An excessive amount of body fat, which increases the risk of medical
illness and premature death.
SATIATION: Level of fullness during a meal.
SATIETY: Level of hunger after a meal.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Obesity is a chronic and easily diagnosed disease that is associated with lifethreatening morbidity and mortality. Overall, recent data show that 33.3%
of adult men, 35.3% of adult women, and 16% of 2- to 19-year-olds were
obese. Approximately 300,000 deaths are attributed to obesity each year with
the direct and indirect costs exceeding $100 billion per year.

Diagnostic Tools
BMI is used as a quick and easy measure of overweight and obesity. However,
BMI is not an accurate measure of overweight/obesity in patients with heart
failure, pregnant women, body builders, and certain ethnic groups. Therefore,
in addition to BMI, additional measurements, like waist circumference, hip

circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, need to be used to accurately identify
the population at risk. Direct measurement of percentage of body fat may also
provide additional information. Table 33–1 lists the classification of overweight/
obesity based on BMI.
Along with the measurements mentioned above, a physical examination
and focused laboratory workup should be performed to look for complications and comorbid conditions. A fasting glucose level should be measured to
evaluate for diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance. The presence of
acanthosis nigricans—a velvety, hyperpigmented thickening of the skin commonly found on the neck and axillary regions—may also be a sign of insulin
resistance. Fasting lipids should also be measured, both to evaluate for the
presence of metabolic syndrome and for the assessment of the patient’s risk for
cardiovascular disease. TSH should be measured to screen for hypothyroidism.
Liver enzymes should be requested, as abnormal results may indicate the development of a fatty liver.

Pathogenesis
Energy balance is the relationship of energy intake to energy expenditure. When
more energy is expended than taken in, weight loss ensues. When the intake of
energy exceeds the amount expended, weight gain occurs. In all persons, obesity
is caused by ingesting more energy than is expended over a period of time.
Energy balance is affected by both genetic and environmental factors.
It has been estimated that genetic background can explain 40% or more
of the variance in body mass in humans. The genetic component is complex
and involves the interaction of multiple genes. However, the marked increase
in obesity cannot be completely attributed to genetics. An increase in energy
consumption with a decrease in physical activity is thought to be the main
contributor to the current obesity epidemic. Among numerous issues, the
availability of convenience foods and the increase in palatability and serving
size, compounded with industrialization leading to decreased physical activity,
has led to an altered energy balance.

CLINICAL CASES

Health Hazards Associated with Obesity
Obesity is a risk factor for the development of numerous medical conditions
(Table 33–2). The more complications that develop, the greater the mortality risk for the individual. Also, the more complications that develop, the
more difficult it becomes to manage the underlying obesity. For example, a
person with degenerative arthritis and heart disease may have significant
symptoms during exercise, impairing his or her ability to expend more energy
in an effort to lose weight.

Treatment
Treatment of obesity should begin in patients with a BMI greater than 25 or
who have visceral obesity, documented by increased waist circumference or a
waist-to-hip ratio greater than 0.9 in men and greater than 0.85 in women.
Weight loss of as little as 5 lb reduces the risk of developing comorbid conditions. Developing a treatment plan for obesity is complex and should use a
combination of dietary restrictions, increased physical activity, and behavior
therapy as a gold standard.
Dietary intervention is the cornerstone of weight-loss therapy. Most diets
work in two principal dimensions: energy content and nutrient composition.
A calorie deficit of 500 to 1000 cal/d produces a weight loss of 1 to 2 lb/wk.
There are different kinds of specific dietary modifications recommended,
but they all work based on calorie restriction. Calorie restriction should not
compromise the nutrient content of the diet; patients should still aim for a
balanced meal.

The addition of exercise training to a diet program can add to the weight
loss. However, physical activity alone is not an effective method for achieving
weight loss. Although increasing physical activity is not effective for initial
weight loss, physical activity is very important for long-term weight management. Patients should engage in moderate to vigorous physical activity for at
least 30 min/d, 5 d/wk, both to maintain weight loss and for the independent
health benefits of exercising.
The purpose of behavior modification therapy is to help patients identify and modify eating and physical activity habits that contribute to obesity. The targets of behavior modification are avoiding triggers, maintaining
dietary diaries, avoidance of high-risk situations, and breaking repetitive behaviors,
such as watching TV while eating.

Pharmacotherapy
Table 33–3 lists the medications commonly used in the treatment of obesity.
Only sibutramine and orlistat are approved for long-term use. With the exception of orlistat, which inhibits the absorption of dietary fat, all medications
approved for obesity act as anorexiants. Anorexiant medications increase satiation, satiety, or both, by affecting the monoamine system in the hypothalamus. Increasing satiation results in a reduction in the amount of food eaten,
whereas increasing satiety reduces the frequency of eating.

Bariatric Surgery
Patients with a BMI greater than 40, or greater than 35 with comorbid conditions, are potential candidates for surgical treatment of obesity. The two
most common surgeries done are Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and “lap banding.”
The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass involves the construction of a small (10-30 mL)
gastric pouch that empties into a segment of jejunum. This is mostly a restrictive procedure, but there is some degree of associated malabsorption. In lap
banding, an adjustable silicone gastric band is laparoscopically placed around
the upper stomach just distal to the gastroesophageal junction. The band has
a balloon connected to a subcutaneously implanted port, which can be inflated
or deflated to reduce the circumference of the band. Complications of the
banding procedure are less common and less severe than in gastric bypass, but
the weight loss may also be less.

Metabolic Syndrome
Guidelines from the 2001 National Cholesterol Education Program (Adult
Treatment Panel [ATP] III) suggest that the clinical identification of the
metabolic syndrome should be based upon the presence of any three of the following traits:

Current minimum estimates are that the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the United States is at least 22%. The metabolic syndrome is an
important risk factor for subsequent development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Thus, the key clinical implication of a diagnosis of metabolic
syndrome is identification of a patient needing aggressive lifestyle modification
focused on weight reduction and increased physical activity.

Case 34
A 33-year-old woman presents with a complaint of headaches. She has
had headaches since she was a teenager but they have become more
debilitating recently. The episodes occur once or twice each month and
last for up to 2 days. The pain begins in the right temple or at the back
of the right eye and spreads to the entire scalp over a few hours. She
describes the pain as a sharp, throbbing sensation that gradually worsens
and is associated with severe nausea. Several factors aggravate the pain,
including loud noises and movement. She has taken several over-thecounter medications for the pain, but the only thing that works is going
to sleep in a quiet, darkened room. A thorough history reveals that her
mother suffers from migraine headaches. Her vital signs, general physical examination, and a thorough neurologic examination are all within
normal limits.

ANSWERS TO CASE 34:
Migraine Headache
Summary: A 33-year-old woman presents with headaches that are throbbing
and over her right eye. Her headaches have occurred since she was a teenager
and have progressively worsened. She has not found relief from over-thecounter preparations.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Migraine without aura.

➤

Most appropriate imaging study: No imaging is indicated at this time as
there are no “red flag” symptoms or signs.

➤

Most appropriate therapy: A “triptan” medication given in a means that does
not have to be swallowed (eg, subcutaneous, intranasal, or orally dissolving
tablet).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the differential diagnosis of chronic headache.
2. Learn the “red flag” symptoms and signs that should prompt rapid, specific
diagnostic and treatment interventions.
3. Know how to manage common headache syndromes.

Considerations
The patient described in the case has symptoms that are very characteristic
of classic migraines without aura. Her headaches are unilateral, throbbing in
nature, and have been progressively worse. Migraine headaches are the most
common headaches of vascular origin. They typically cause recurrent episodes
of headache, nausea, and vomiting. They can also be associated with other
neurologic symptoms such as photophobia, light-headedness, paresthesia, vertigo, and visual disturbances. In the patient described in this case, the history
and lack of physical findings can reasonably lead to the diagnosis of migraine
headaches without aura (“common migraine”), the most frequently occurring
form. Other classifications of migraines include migraine with aura (“classic
migraine”), ophthalmoplegic migraine, retinal migraine, and childhood periodic syndromes that may be precursors to or associated with migraines. During
the evaluation of this patient, the focus should be on determining the etiology
of the headache, assessing for any red flags (see Table 34–1) that may indicate
a worse pathological causes, identifying triggers, and therapy for the condition.

According to the International Headache Society, symptoms diagnostic of
migraine headache include moderate to severe headache with a pulsating
quality; unilateral location; nausea and/or vomiting; photophobia; phonophobia; worsening with activity; multiple attacks lasting for 4 hours to 3 days;
and absence of history or physical examination findings that would make it
likely that the headache is the result of another cause. Common triggers of
migraine headaches include menses, fatigue, hunger, and stress.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

APPROACH TO
Migraine Headaches
DEFINITIONS
MIGRAINE HEADACHES: Vascular headaches typically throbbing unilateral

in character, and may be present with or without an aura. There is a high
female predominance.
TENSION HEADACHE: Typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a bilateral bandlike distribution of the pain.
CLUSTER HEADACHE: Unilateral headaches that may have a high male
predominance, can be located in the orbital, supraorbital, or temporal region.
It is generally described as a deep, excruciating pain lasting from 15 minutes
to 3 hours. These headaches are usually episodic; however a small subset may
have chronic headaches.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Headaches are an extremely common complaint in primary care, urgent care,
and emergency settings. The vast majority of adults have at least one headache
each year, although most do not present for medical care. The role of the practitioner is to attempt to accurately diagnose the cause of the headache, rule out
secondary causes of headaches (“red flags”) that may signify a serious underlying pathology, provide appropriate acute management, and assist with headache
prevention when needed.
The medical history in a patient with headaches should focus on several
important areas. The quality and characteristics of the headache and its specific
location and radiation should be identified. The presence of associated symptoms, especially neurologic symptoms that may suggest the presence of a focal
neurologic lesion or increased intracranial pressure, must be documented. The
age at which the patient first developed the headaches, the frequency and duration of the headaches, and the amount of disability and distress that is caused to
the patient should be explored. It is also important to note what the patient has
done to try to treat the headaches in the past, including as much detail as possible regarding medication usage (both prescription and over-the-counter [OTC]).
The examination should include both a general examination and a detailed
neurologic examination. A funduscopic examination revealing papilledema
may be supportive of the presence of increased intracranial pressure.
Identifying a focal neurologic deficit increases the likelihood of finding a significant CNS pathology as the cause of the headache.
A patient with symptoms and signs consistent with migraine and who does
not have any “red flag” findings (Table 34–1) does not require any further testing

CLINICAL CASES

359

prior to instituting treatment. Neuroimaging should be performed if there is an
unexplained neurologic abnormality on examination or if the headache syndrome is not typical of either migraines or some other primary headache disorder. The presence of rapidly increasing headache frequency or a history of
either lack of coordination, focal neurologic symptom, or headache awakening the patient from sleep, raises the likelihood of finding an abnormality on
an imaging test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be more sensitive
than computed tomography (CT) scanning for the identification of abnormalities, but it may not be more sensitive at identifying significant abnormalities.
Other testing (eg, blood tests, electroencephalogram [EEG]) should only be
performed for diagnostic purposes if there is a suspicion based on the history or
physical examination.
The treatment of headache is best individualized based on a thorough history, physical examination, and the interpretation of any additional study
results. Nonpharmacologic measures and cognitive-behavioral therapy are
worth considering in most patients with primary headache disorders. The US
Headache Consortium lists the following general management guidelines for
the treatment of migraine headaches:
• Educate migraine patients about their condition and its treatment, and edu-

cate them to participate in their own management.
• Use migraine-specific agents (eg, triptans, dihydroergotamine, ergotamine) in

patients with more severe migraines, and in those whose headaches respond
poorly to treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
combination analgesics, such as aspirin plus acetaminophen plus caffeine.
• Select a nonoral route of administration for patients whose migraines present early with nausea or vomiting as a significant component of the symptom complex.
• Consider using a self-administered rescue medication for patients with severe
migraine who do not respond well to other treatments.
• Guard against medication-overuse or rebound headaches. Patients who
require acute treatment on two or more occasions per week should probably
be on prophylactic treatment.
The goal of therapy in migraine prophylaxis is a reduction in the severity
and frequency of headache by 50% or more. The strongest evidence supports the
use of amitriptyline, propranolol, timolol, and divalproex sodium for migraine
headache prevention.

OTHER HEADACHE SYNDROMES
Tension-Type Headache
Tension headache is the most prevalent form of primary headache disorder,
typically presenting with pericranial muscle tenderness and a description of a
bilateral bandlike distribution of the pain. Headaches can last from 30 minutes

360

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

to 7 days and there is no aggravation by walking stairs or similar routine physical activity. There is no associated nausea or vomiting. Photophobia and
phonophobia are both absent, or one, but not the other, is present. They can
be either episodic (<180 d/yr) or chronic (>180 d/yr).
Initial medical therapy of episodic tension-type headache includes aspirin,
acetaminophen, and NSAIDs. Because of the significant risk of developing drug
dependency or medication-overuse headache, avoiding caffeine-containing
over-the-counter or prescription drugs and codeine- or ergotamine-containing
preparations (including combination products) is recommended. The general
management principles for the treatment of migraine headaches can also be
applied to the treatment of chronic tension-type headaches. In frequent
headache sufferers, the combination of antidepressant medications and stress
management therapy reduces headache activity significantly. Other prophylactic treatments of chronic tension-type headaches include calcium channel
blockers and β-blockers.

Cluster Headache
Cluster headache is strictly unilateral in location and can be located in the
orbital, supraorbital, or temporal region. It is generally described as a deep, excruciating pain lasting from 15 minutes to 3 hours. The frequency can vary from one
every other day to eight attacks per day. Cluster headaches are associated with
ipsilateral autonomic signs and symptoms, and have a much greater prevalence
in men. Compared to migraine sufferers who often desire sleep and a quiet, dark
environment during their headache, individuals with cluster headache pace
around, unable to find a comfortable position. The acute treatment of cluster
headache involves 100% oxygen at 6 L/min, dihydroergotamine, and the triptans. Verapamil, lithium, divalproex sodium, methysergide, and prednisone may
be used for prophylactic treatment. Because of side effects related to chronic use,
methysergide and prednisone need to be used with caution.

Chronic Medical Conditions
Patients with certain underlying medical conditions have a greater incidence
of having an organic cause of their headache. Patients with cancer may
develop headaches as a consequence of metastases. Someone with uncontrolled hypertension (with diastolic pressures >110 mm Hg) may present with
the chief complaint of headache. Patients with HIV infection or AIDS may
present with central nervous system metastases, lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, or
meningitis as the cause of their headache.

Medication-Related Headache
Numerous medications have headache as a reported adverse effect. Medicationoveruse headache (formerly drug-induced or “rebound” headache) may occur
following frequent use of any analgesic or headache medication. This includes

CLINICAL CASES

361

both nonprescription (eg, acetaminophen, NSAIDs) and prescription medications. Caffeine use, whether as a component of an analgesic or a beverage,
is another culprit in this category. The duration and severity of the withdrawal headache following discontinuation of the medication vary depending
on the medication(s) involved.

Comprehension Questions

A 28-year-old man presents for evaluation of headaches. He has had
several episodes of unilateral throbbing headaches that last 8 to 12 hours.
When they occur, he gets nauseated and just wants to go to bed. Usually
they are relieved after he lies down in a dark, quiet room for the remainder of the day. He is missing significant work time due to the headaches.
He has a normal examination today. Which of the following statements
is accurate regarding this situation?
A. He needs a CT scan of his head to evaluate for the cause of his
headache.
B. When he gets his next headache, he should breathe in 100% oxygen and use a triptan medication.
C. If he has not already done so, he should use aspirin 650 mg orally
every 4 hours as needed and take a stress-management class.
D. An injectable or nasal spray triptan is most appropriate.

A 52-year-old woman presents to the office for an acute visit complaining of 2 hours of headache. She says that it came on suddenly with no
account of trauma and is the worst headache she has ever had. She has
had migraines since she was an early adult. The pain is described as
“stabbing” and is more severe on the left side. She takes no medications
and recently stopped taking oral contraceptive pills after going through
menopause. Her blood pressure is elevated at 145/95 mm Hg, but otherwise she has no focal neurologic abnormalities on examination. She

following is the most appropriate management at this time?
A. Prescribe a triptan medication.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

A 43-year-old man presents with headaches that he has had daily for
several months. Every morning at work, usually between 9 and 10 AM,
he has to take 650 mg of acetaminophen to relieve the headache. This
has been going on for the past 3 months and he is at the point of looking for a new job, as he thinks that job stress is the cause of his symptoms. His examination is normal. Which of the following is the most
appropriate advice for him?
A. Continue with the as-needed acetaminophen and find a less stressful career.
B. He should start an antidepressant for headache prophylaxis.
C. His headaches are most likely to improve if he stops taking the
acetaminophen.
D. A triptan is a more appropriate treatment for him.

ANSWERS
34.1

D. This patient gives a history very consistent with common migraine
headaches. There are no red flags found on history or examination, so
no further testing is necessary at this point. As he has significant nausea, he may benefit from nonoral medication. A triptan delivered by
injection or nasal spray is a reasonable starting point for him.

34.2

C. The acute onset of the most severe headache in a patient’s life is
concerning for the presence of a subarachnoid hemorrhage. This is a
medical emergency. This patient should be transported by emergency
medical services to the nearest emergency facility for stabilization
and management.

34.3

C. This situation is typical of a medication-related headache. While
finding a new, less-stressful job may be beneficial, the problem will
not resolve until he discontinues the daily use of his over-the-counter
analgesic.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Migraine headaches can occur in children and adolescents, as well as
adults.
➤ Most patients presenting for the evaluation of headaches do not need
diagnostic testing beyond the history and physical. However, the presence
of focal neurologic deficits or other red-flag symptoms/signs should prompt
an immediate workup or referral.

Case 35
A 56-year-old man comes in for a routine health maintenance visit. He
is new to your practice and has no specific complaints today. He has
hypertension for which he takes hydrochlorothiazide, and he occasionally takes an aspirin because someone told him that it was good for him.
He has no other significant medical history. He does not smoke cigarettes, occasionally drinks alcohol, and does not exercise. His father died
of a heart attack at age 60 years and his mother died at age 72 years of
cancer. He has two younger sisters who are in good health. On examination, his blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg and his pulse is 75 bpm. He
is 6 ft tall and weighs 200 lb. His complete physical examination is normal. You order a fasting lipid panel, which subsequently returns with the
following results: total cholesterol 242 mg/dL; triglycerides 138 mg/dL;
high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol 48 mg/dL; and low-density
lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 155 mg/dL.

ANSWERS TO CASE 35:
Hyperlipidemia
Summary: A 56-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension is found to
have elevated cholesterol on a screening blood test as part of a physical examination. He has no known history of coronary artery disease or of any coronary artery disease risk equivalent.
➤

Goal for LDL-cholesterol: Less than 130 mg/dL.

➤

Further testing at this time: Blood glucose, creatinine, liver function tests,
thyroid-stimulating hormone.

➤

Initial management of his elevated cholesterol: Therapeutic lifestyle
changes.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
2. Know the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III guidelines for the diagnosis,
evaluation, and management of hyperlipidemia.
3. Be able to counsel patients on therapeutic lifestyle changes to lower their
cholesterol levels.

Considerations
This case illustrates a 56-year-old man with well-controlled hypertension and
total cholesterol 242 mg/dL; triglycerides 138 mg/dL; high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) cholesterol 48 mg/dL; and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
155 mg/dL. The main cholesterol component that impacts on cardiovascular
disease is the LDL level. Because this individual has a cardiovascular risk factor score of 2 (age and LDL), this patient’s LDL goal is 130 mg/dL. Initially
therapeutic lifestyle changes should be used such as weight loss, exercise, and
diet, and then the fasting lipid panel should be repeated in 6 weeks. At the
repeat visit, if the LDL cholesterol continues to be elevated, then discussion
of pharmacologic therapy should ensue.

APPROACH TO
High Cholesterol
DEFINITIONS
ATP III: The third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program

Expert Panel on the Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood
Cholesterol in Adults.
HDL CHOLESTEROL: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
LDL CHOLESTEROL: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.
STATIN: Medication in the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A
(HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitor class. These are the most widely used medications for lowering LDL cholesterol.

CLINICAL APPROACH
It is important to remember that cholesterol is not a disease; however, high
cholesterol is a risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD). As such, an individual’s cholesterol levels must be interpreted in the context of their overall risks for CHD. The recommended intensity with which we want to lower
someone’s cholesterol level should be proportionate to their risk of CHD: the
higher one’s risk, the lower the cholesterol goal. To do this, one must first
learn what these major risks are.
Someone with known CHD has a greater than 20% risk of having another CHD
event in 10 years. Persons with other forms of atherosclerotic disease (peripheral
arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease, or abdominal aortic aneurysm), type 2
diabetes, or multiple risk factors that together raise the risk of CHD to greater
than or equal to 20% in 10 years, are said to have a CHD risk equivalent. People
with known CHD or CHD risk equivalents have the highest risk of future
CHD events and, therefore, their cholesterol targets are the lowest. Similarly,
someone with one or fewer risk factors for CHD is at low risk of having a CHD
event. These people usually have a less than 10% risk of a CHD event in 10 years.
In this population, the recommended lipid levels are not as low.
A third population is one with intermediate risk when compared to the
previous two groups. They have two or more risks factors, but a CHD risk
between 10% and 20%. In this population, an individual risk should be calculated. Numerous risk calculators are available online or for download into
a PDA (personal digital assistant). One is available from the National Heart,
Lung, and Blood institute at www.nhlbi.nih.gov/guidelines/cholesterol/
index.htm. By determining the individual risk of CHD, one can then determine an appropriate lipid goal for that patient.

368

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Determination of Lipid Goal
Numerous studies show that LDL cholesterol is a major risk for developing
CHD and that lowering LDL cholesterol can reduce this risk. For these reasons, the ATP III guidelines focus on the identification of those with high LDL
cholesterol, the determination of that individual’s risk of CHD, and development of an appropriate management plan to reach LDL cholesterol goals.
These guidelines recommend measuring lipid levels in all adults older than
age 20 years every 5 years. The test performed can be either a fasting lipid panel
(total, LDL, and HDL cholesterol; triglycerides) or a nonfasting total and HDL
cholesterol, with subsequent fasting lipid panel if either total cholesterol is
over 200 mg/dL or if HDL cholesterol is less than 40 mg/dL. Table 35–1 lists
the ATP III classification of lipid levels.
LDL cholesterol is the primary goal of management. Along with the presence of CHD or a CHD risk equivalent, the following five factors are considered to determine the LDL goal of a given individual:

CLINICAL CASES

• Cigarette smoking
• Hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg or on antihypertensive med-

ication)
• Low HDL
• Age (v45 years for men; ≥55 years for women)
• Family history of premature CHD (male first-degree relative f55 years of

age; female first-degree relative ≤65 years of age)

A high HDL level is considered a negative risk, which removes one other
risk factor from the total.
The LDL cholesterol goal is based upon the evaluation of these risks.
A person with CHD or a CHD risk equivalent has an LDL goal of 100 mg/dL
or less. Someone with zero to one identified risks has an LDL goal of 160 mg/dL
or less. An individual with two or more risks should have an individual risk
assessment performed, using a risk calculator. If someone has two or more risk
factors and an individual risk of between 10% and 20%, that person’s LDL
goal is 130 mg/dL or less. However, if the individual risk is greater than or
equal to 20%, that person should be treated as having a CHD equivalent, with
a goal LDL of less than 100 mg/dL (Table 35–2).
An update to the ATP III was issued in 2004 with an interpretation of
some more recent clinical trials. This update suggests a “therapeutic option”
of a very low LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dL for those patients at very high
risk of CHD. This very-high-risk category includes people with CHD and
either multiple major risk factors (especially diabetes), poorly controlled risk
factors (especially smoking), multiple risk factors of metabolic syndrome (see
Case 33), or an acute coronary syndrome.

Evaluation
When high blood cholesterol is identified, an investigation should be performed to evaluate for secondary causes of dyslipidemia. Included among
these causes are diabetes, hypothyroidism, obstructive liver disease, and
chronic renal failure. Consequently, a reasonable laboratory workup includes
fasting blood glucose, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), liver enzymes, and
a creatinine level. Certain medications, including progestins, anabolic steroids,
and corticosteroids, also can result in elevated cholesterol. Consideration should
be given to changing or discontinuing these when possible.

Management
Therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) are the cornerstone of all treatments
for hyperlipidemia. All patients should be educated on healthier living,
including dietary modifications, increased physical activity, and smoking cessation. Weight reduction should be encouraged.
Specific dietary recommendations should include a reduction of saturated
fats to less than 7% of total calories and an intake of less than 200 mg/d of
cholesterol. Total dietary fat should be kept to no more than 35% of total
calories, with less than 10% polyunsaturated fat. Trans fats should be kept as
low as possible.
When dietary restriction alone does not lead to adequate LDL reduction,
the addition of dietary soluble fiber and plant stanols/sterols can be beneficial.
Soluble fiber 10 to 25 g and of plant stanols/sterols 2 g can be added to aid in
cholesterol reduction. Referral to a dietician may be helpful as well.
When TLC is instituted, regular follow-up must be arranged. Fasting lipids
should be rechecked in approximately 6 weeks. If adequate reduction has
occurred, reinforcement of the lifestyle changes should be given and the
patient followed every 4 to 6 months.
Pharmacotherapy may be considered in patients who do not reach their
LDL goals with TLC alone. TLC should continue to be reinforced and encouraged even when starting medications. In someone who does not have CHD
or a risk equivalent (primary prevention), medications should be considered
after the third visit of TLC management. In someone with CHD or an equivalent (secondary prevention), the more stringent LDL goals often require earlier institution of drug treatment.
The first-line pharmacotherapy for LDL cholesterol reduction is a statin.
Statins not only reduce LDL cholesterol but also reduce the rates of coronary events, strokes, cardiac death, and all-cause mortality. When statin
therapy is started, fasting lipids should be rechecked in 6 weeks. If LDL goals
are not met, the dose of the statin can be increased or a second agent added.
These other medications include fibric acids, nicotinic acids, bile acid sequestrants, and cholesterol absorption blockers (Table 35–3). When taking statins,

liver enzymes must be monitored as well (6-12 weeks after initiation or dosage
change, then every 6-12 months). When goal levels are met, regular followup should be arranged to reinforce lifestyle changes, medication compliance,
and overall risk factor reduction.

Comprehension Questions
35.1

A 62-year-old smoker with no known history of CHD presents for
follow-up of intermittent claudication. He has normal blood pressure and
no family history of premature CHD. His HDL cholesterol is 48 mg/dL.
According to the ATP III guidelines, which of the following is his goal
LDL?
A. 70 mg/dL
B. 100 mg/dL
C. 130 mg/dL
D. 160 mg/dL

35.2

A 55-year-old woman presents to your office for follow-up. She was
discharged from the hospital 1 week ago following a heart attack. She
has quit smoking since then and vows to stay off cigarettes forever.
Her lipid levels are total cholesterol 240 mg/dL, HDL 50 mg/dL, LDL
150 mg/dL, and triglycerides 150 mg/dL. Which of the following is the
most appropriate management at this time?
A. Institute therapeutic lifestyle changes alone.
B. Institute therapeutic lifestyle changes and start on a statin.
C. Start on a statin.
D. Institute therapeutic lifestyle changes and start on a statin and
nicotinic acid.

35.3

A 48-year-old man with no significant medical history and no symptoms is found to have elevated cholesterol at a health screening.
Which of the following tests is part of the routine evaluation of this
problem?
A. ECG
B. Stress test
C. Complete blood count (CBC)
D. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)

CLINICAL CASES

373

ANSWERS
35.1

B. This patient has symptomatic peripheral arterial disease, which is
considered a CHD risk equivalent. His LDL goal is 100 mg/dL or less.

35.2

B. This patient has known CHD, documented by her recent myocardial infarction. Her goal LDL is 100 mg/dL or less. As her starting
level is above 130 mg/dL, it would be reasonable to start both TLC
and a statin to help her to reach her goal. Nicotinic acid may be a
reasonable addition if the TLC and statin do not lead to adequate
LDL reduction.

35.3

D. Hypothyroidism is a potential cause of secondary dyslipidemia.
A TSH is a reasonable test to perform in this setting. There is no indication to screen for CHD with an ECG or stress test in this asymptomatic person. Other tests to perform could include fasting blood
glucose, liver enzymes, and a measurement of renal function.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Lipid levels must always be interpreted in the context of the individual’s
overall risk factors for CHD.
➤ Statins have the best data to support improvement in outcomes that are
clinically significant, such as heart attacks, strokes, and death. Unless there
is a contraindication, a statin should be the first medication used for cholesterol reduction.
➤ Remind patients who are taking lipid-lowering medications that lifestyle
modifications are still necessary. Medications are not a substitute for a
healthy lifestyle.

Case 36
A 20-month-old girl, new to your practice, is brought in by her mother
because she’s been crying and not walking for the past day. Her mother
reports that the child is “very clumsy and falls a lot.” She says that the
little girl may have injured her leg by falling off the sofa because, she
repeats, “she really is clumsy and falls a lot.” Upon review with the
mother, she states that the child has no significant medical history and
takes no medications regularly. There are two older children in the family,
ages 4 and 6 years, who are in good health but also are “clumsy and forever hurting themselves.” The husband lives in the home. Without any
questioning or prompting, the mother states that her husband is “a good
man but he’s under a lot of stress.” You ask the mother to undress the
child for an examination and she quickly replies, “Do you really have to
undress her? She’s very shy.” You politely, but firmly, say that you need to
examine her and she removes the child’s pants. You see that her right
knee is visibly swollen and tender to palpation on the medial bony
prominences. You also note numerous bruises of the buttocks and posterior thighs, which appear to be of different ages. There are also several
small, circular scars on the legs, each about a centimeter in size. “See how
clumsy she is?” the mother says, pointing to her bruises. An x-ray of the
child’s knee shows a corner fracture of the distal femoral metaphysis.

ANSWERS TO CASE 36:
Family Violence
Summary: A 20-month-old girl is brought to the office for evaluation of crying and not walking. On examination, she is found to have multiple bruises
and circular wounds that are suspicious for cigarette burns. Her knee x-ray
shows a metaphyseal corner fracture, an injury that is inconsistent with the
stated history of “falling off the sofa.”
➤

Most likely mechanism of injuries: Inflicted injuries, including leg injury
from forceful pulling, bruising from hitting the child’s legs, and cigarette burns.

➤

Further evaluation at this time: Complete, unclothed physical examination of child (including ophthalmoscopic and neurologic examinations);
radiographic skeletal survey.

➤

Legal obligation of physician: Report of suspected child abuse to the
appropriate child protective services organization.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the symptoms and signs suggestive of abuse.
2. Know the situations in which the risk of family violence increases.
3. Learn some of the medicolegal requirements involved in situations of family
violence.

Considerations
Family violence can occur in families of any socioeconomic class and in
households of any composition. The term family violence includes child abuse,
intimate partner violence, and elder abuse. The abuse that occurs can be
physical, sexual, emotional, psychological, or economic. It can take the forms
of battering, raping, threatening, intimidating, isolating from friends and family, stealing, and preventing the earning of money, among many others.
In the case presented here, there are several signs of intentionally inflicted
injuries to the child. The presence of numerous bruises of varying ages, especially on relatively protected areas such as the buttocks and upper posterior
thighs, should raise suspicions. Finding injuries inconsistent with the reported
history also can be a clue. Certain types of fractures, such as metaphyseal corner fractures (caused by forceful jerking or twisting of the leg) are usually a
result of abuse. The identification of wounds consistent with cigarette burns
is highly specific for abuse.

CLINICAL CASES

377

Physicians often find these situations extremely difficult and uncomfortable to deal with. They may feel caught between two partners—both of whom
are patients—but who give conflicting stories. They may have concerns about
the legal implications of their findings and fear legal actions if they make
reports to authorities. They may have frustrations in dealing with a person
who will not leave an abusive spouse and may feel ill-trained to deal with
many of these situations. By knowing situations in which family violence is
more likely to occur, knowing the laws regarding disclosure and reporting, and
learning to recognize the signs of family violence, physicians can be better
prepared to address these situations when they occur.

APPROACH TO
Family Violence
DEFINITIONS
NEGLECT: Failure to provide the needs required for functioning or for the
avoidance of harm.
PHYSICAL ABUSE (BATTERY): Intentional physical actions (eg, biting, kicking,
punching) that can cause injury or pain to another person.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Family violence is an abuse of power, in which a more-powerful person exerts
control over a less-powerful person or persons. This abuse can take the form
of physical violence (battery), sexual violence, intimidation, emotional and
psychological abuse, economic control, neglect, and isolation from others.

Intimate Partner Violence
Although intimate partner violence (IPV) is most common to think of this as
a man abusing a woman, abuse can occur both in homosexual relationships
and in heterosexual relationships with a male victim. It is estimated that 1 to
4 million women are abused annually in the United States and that approximately 1 in 3 women are abused at some time in their lives.
Abuse can occur in any relationship or in any socioeconomic class. Certain
situations increase the likelihood, or escalate the occurrences, of abuse. These
situations include changes in family life (such as pregnancy, illnesses, deaths),
economic stresses, and substance abuse. Personal and family histories of abuse
also increase the likelihood of family violence. Most women do not disclose
abuse to their physicians.

378

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Numerous professional organizations, such as the American Medical Association,
the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists, advocate for the routine screening of women
for abuse by direct questioning. Numerous tools exist for screening, from simple questioning (“Do you feel safe in your home?”) to more formal inventory
tools. The United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) has found
insufficient evidence to make a recommendation for or against screening for
domestic violence because they did not find studies that directly looked at the
impact of screening on reducing adverse outcomes. The USPSTF does recommend that all clinicians should be alert to physical and behavioral signs and
symptoms associated with abuse and neglect, and that direct questions about
abuse are justifiable, due to high levels of undetected abuse in women and the
potential value of helping these patients. Recommendations regarding interactions with victims of abuse include exhibiting compassionate, nonjudgmental,
supportive care in a private, secure environment.
Victims of abuse can present with varied symptoms and signs suggestive of
the problem. Direct physical findings can include obvious traumatic injuries,
such as contusions, fractures, “black eyes,” concussions. and internal bleeding.
Genital, anal, or pharyngeal trauma, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs),
and unintended pregnancy may be signs of sexual assault. Depression, anxiety,
panic, somatoform and posttraumatic stress disorders, and suicide attempts
can also result from abusive relationships.
Some signs and symptoms may be less obvious and may require numerous
encounters until the finding of family violence is made. Victims of abuse may
present to doctors frequently for health complaints or have physical symptoms that cannot otherwise be explained. Delays in treatment for physical
injuries may be a sign of IPV. Chronic pain, frequently abdominal or pelvic
pain, is commonly a sign of a history of abuse. The development of substance
abuse or eating disorders may prompt inquiry into family violence as well.
Children of women abused often directly witness the abuse of their mother.
Children and adolescents of abused women can exhibit aggression, anxiety,
bedwetting, and depression.
When abuse is identified, an initial priority is to assess the safety of the
home situation. Direct questioning regarding increasing levels of violence,
the presence of weapons in the home, as well as the need for a plan for safety
for the victim and others at home (children, elders), is critical. Resources,
such as shelters, should be provided. It may be helpful to allow the patient to
contact a shelter, law enforcement, family members, or friends, while still in
the doctor’s office. Multidisciplinary interventions, including family, medical,
legal, mental health, and law enforcement, are often necessary.
The laws regarding clinician reporting of partner violence vary from
state to state. It is important to know the statutes in your locality. Many states
do not require contacting legal authorities if the victim of the abuse is a competent adult.

CLINICAL CASES

379

Child Abuse
Approximately 1 million cases of child abuse, with more than 1000 deaths, are
reported each year in the United States; the number of unreported cases makes
the overall prevalence much higher. The situations that increase the risk of
child abuse are similar to those that increase the likelihood of other family violence. These include parental depression, substance abuse, social isolation, and
increased stress. Societal factors include dangerous neighborhoods and poor
access to recreational resources. Children who are chronically ill or who have
physical or developmental disorders may be at even higher risk. Protective factors include family support from community or relatives, parental ability to ask
for help, and access to mental health resources. Identification of at-risk families and home visitation interventions has been shown to significantly reduce
child abuse. Short- and long-term physical, psychological, and social consequences are often seen in the victims of child abuse.
Certain history and physical examination findings raise the suspicion for
child abuse. Injuries that are inconsistent with the stated history or a history that repeatedly changes with questioning should raise the suspicion of
abuse. Children who are taken to numerous different physicians or emergency
rooms, or who are brought in repeatedly with traumatic injuries, may be victims.
Delay in seeking medical care for an injury may also be a clue to abuse.
Neglect is also a form of child abuse. An injury or illness that occurred because
of lack of appropriate supervision may be a sign of neglect. Failure to provide for
basic nutritional, healthcare, or safety needs may be other forms of neglect.
Children frequently have bruises, fractures, and other injuries that occur
accidentally and it can be difficult to distinguish with certainty whether an
injury is accidental or intentional. However, certain types of injuries are
uncommon as accidents (Table 36–1). The presence of these injuries is highly
suggestive of child abuse.
When an injury suspicious for child abuse is identified, attention should
initially focus on treatment and protection from further injury. A complete
examination should be performed and all injuries documented with drawings
or photographs. An x-ray skeletal survey can be performed to look for evidence of current or previous bony injuries. Ophthalmologic examination
should be performed to look for retinal hemorrhages. The progress note
should be documented carefully and legibly.
All 50 states require reporting of suspected child abuse to the appropriate
authorities (refer to local laws to determine the appropriate authority). Parents
should be informed that a report is going to be made and the process that is likely
to occur after the report is made. Consideration must also be given to the possibility
that there are other victims of abuse in the home (spouse, other children, elders).
Any health-care provider who makes a good-faith report of suspected abuse or
neglect is immune from any legal action, even if the investigation reveals that no

Elder Abuse
Many types of elder abuse may occur, including physical, sexual, and psychological abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation. An estimated 2 million elders
(3.2% of elderly) are abused in some form annually in the United States. Along
with the other risks for domestic violence, several factors unique to the care of
elders may play a role. The majority of abusers are family members. Caregiver
frustrations and burnout are commonly heard excuses for abuse. Abusers often
have histories of mental health problems or substance abuse and have little
insight into the fact that they are abusing the patient. Women older than 75 years
are statistically the most abused group. Persons who are older, more cognitively
and physically debilitated, and have less access to resources are more likely
to be abused or exploited.
A history of abuse may be difficult to obtain, as the patient may fear worsening of the abuse or may not have the cognitive ability to make an accurate
report. If feasible, it is helpful to interview the patient without the presence
of the caregiver. Screening the caregiver in private for stress with referral for
community resources may prevent abuse in the elderly. The physical examination, like in child abuse, should carefully document any injuries that are found.
Suspicions of dehydration or malnutrition should be confirmed with appropriate laboratory testing and radiographs should be performed as necessary.

CLINICAL CASES

381

By law, elder abuse should be reported to the appropriate adult protective
services, but the reporting requirements vary by state. A multidisciplinary
approach, involving medical providers, social workers, legal authorities, and
families is usually necessary to address the issues involved.

Comprehension Questions
36.1

A 42-year-old woman presents to your office for evaluation of chronic
abdominal pain. She has seen you multiple times for this complaint, but
the workup has always been negative. On examination, her abdomen is
soft and there are no peritoneal signs. She has no rash, but does have a
purpuric lesion lateral to her left orbit. Which of the following is the
best next step in management?
A. Ask the patient about physical abuse and report suspicions to the
local police.
B. Ask the patient about physical abuse and provide information about
local support services.
C. Exclude a bleeding diathesis before inquiring about abuse.
D. Order an abdominal X-ray.
E. Refer to psychiatry.

36.2

A 7-month-old boy presents to the ED with his father after a 1-day
history of intractable vomiting. On examination, the child is lethargic.
The anterior fontanel is closed. An abdominal x-ray shows a nonspecific bowel gas pattern and incidentally reveals a mid-shaft fracture
of the right femur. When confronted about the fracture, the father
states that the child climbed onto a chair and jumped off yesterday.
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Radiographic bone survey
B. Consulting a child abuse specialist
C. Social services consult
D. Disclosing to the parent the intention of contacting child protection services
E. Non-contrast CT of the head

36.3

Which of the following injuries is most likely to be caused by abuse of
a toddler?
A. Three or four bruises on the shins and knees
B. Spiral fracture of the tibia
C. A displaced posterior rib fracture
D. A forehead laceration

An 80-year-old man, who resides in a local nursing home is seen in
your office for unexplained scratches on arms, and bandlike bruises on
wrists and ankles consistent with restraint use. The patient is mildly
demented, and appears scared. There is no family to contact. Examination
and laboratory results show no medical reason for easy bruising.
Which of the following should be your next step?
A. Refer to nursing home social worker.
B. Contact nursing home ombudsmen program.
C. Have the patient observed by nursing home staff.
D. Contact nursing home vice president for nursing care.
E. Send the patient back to the nursing home.

ANSWERS
36.1

B. It is appropriate to discuss your concerns in a nonaccusatory, nonjudgmental fashion with your patient. Waiting for her to bring up the
subject may result in her suffering further abuse. The reporting of the
abuse of competent adults (not elders) is not mandated by law in
most states. You should offer assistance, evaluate her safety, and provide her with information regarding available services in the area.
There is no reason to exclude a bleeding diathesis before approaching the subject of abuse.

36.2

E. This child has injuries consistent with physical abuse. In children
less than 1 year of age, 75% of fractures are due to abuse. Moreover,
the shape of a fracture—spiral, transverse, etc.—is less important in
suspected abuse than the age of the child and location of the fracture. The purported history of fall is inconsistent with the developmental abilities of a 7-month old child. The child has intractable
vomiting and is lethargic on examination. These findings are worrisome for neurologic damage. A CT should be ordered to exclude
intracranial bleed, since this disorder may lead to irreversible brain
damage or even death if not identified quickly. While a radiographic
bone survey is indicated in all children less than 2 years of age with
suspected abuse, it should be done after excluding more urgent conditions. Providers have a responsibility to notify the appropriate
authorities when abuse is suspected; however, it is inadvisable to disclose this intention to the parent. Lastly, the anterior fontanel closes
between 4-26 months of age (avg. 13.8 months). It may bulge in conditions, such as meningitis or intracranial hemorrhage, which increase
intracranial pressure.

CLINICAL CASES

383

36.3

C. A posterior rib fracture is often the result of grabbing and squeezing the chest violently. It is very suspicious for abuse. A spiral fracture of the tibia is known as a “toddler’s fracture” and is a common
injury that is often confused with abuse, but not often caused by
abuse. Bruises on the anterior and over bony prominences such as
the shins, knees, and forehead injuries are common from falls while
learning to walk. Well-padded areas that are bruised such as the
thigh, buttock, and cheeks increase likelihood of abuse.

36.4

B. Clinicians have a legal duty to report possible elder to abuse to
adult protective services in their community. If the patient is living
in a nursing care facility, each state has nursing home ombudsmen
who can investigate. The Ombudsmen Program is mandated by the
Federal Older Americans Act. If you feel that this patient is in
immediate danger, he can be admitted for evaluation of bruising
while the ombudsmen and local adult protective services investigate
for substandard care or abuse at the nursing care facility.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Suspected child and elder abuse must be reported. Good-faith reports of
suspected abuse are a shield to lawsuits; failure to report can result in legal
action against the physician.
➤ When seeing a suspected abuse victim, always consider the possibility that
there could be other abuse victims in the household.

Case 37
A 12-year-old boy is brought to the physician’s office with right thigh
pain and a limp. His mother has noticed him limping for the past week
or so. He denies any injury to his leg but says that it hurts some when
he plays basketball with his friends. He denies back pain, hip pain, or
ankle pain. He occasionally gets some pain in the right knee but does
not have any swelling or bruising. He has no significant medical history,
does not take any medications regularly, and otherwise feels fine. On
examination, he is an overweight adolescent. His vital signs and a general physical examination are normal. When you have him walk, he has
a prominent limp. You note that he seems to keep his weight on his left
leg for a greater proportion of his gait cycle than he does on the right
leg. Examination of his back reveals a full range of motion, no tenderness, and no muscle spasm. He gets pain in the right hip when it is passively internally rotated. When the hip is passively flexed there is a
noticeable external rotation. There is no thigh muscle atrophy. His right
knee and the remainder of his orthopedic examination are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 37:
Limping in Children
Summary: An overweight 12-year-old boy presents for evaluation of a limp and
thigh pain. There is no history of injury or trauma. He is found to have pain
on internal rotation of the hip and his hip externally rotates when passively
flexed. He bears weight more on his left leg than his right while walking.
➤

Most appropriate test to order: X-ray of the right hip.

➤

Most likely diagnosis: Slipped capital femoral epiphysis.

➤

Complication for which he is at risk: Avascular necrosis of the hip.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a differential diagnosis of the most likely causes of leg pain and
limping in children.
2. Know common causes of leg pain and limping in children of different ages.
3. Know appropriate examination, laboratory, and radiologic evaluation for
the limping child.

Considerations
Leg pain is a common complaint in childhood. The most common causes of
leg pain in children are acute injuries—sprains, strains, contusions, and so on.
However, leg pain and limping can be a sign of a more serious, even lifethreatening, pathology. Learning an approach to the evaluation and the common diagnoses involved may help in the identification of these problems
earlier, when a better outcome is more likely.
To understand a limp, it is first important to understand the normal gait. Gait
is composed of two phases: the “swing” and the “stance” phases. The stance phase
is the weight-bearing phase and accounts for approximately 60% of the gait cycle.
The swing phase is the non–weight-bearing phase, when the foot lifts off the
ground and is propelled forward. The antalgic gait occurs when the stance phase
of gait is shortened, usually because of pain during weight bearing. Antalgic gait
is the most common type of limp and is the type of gait described in this case.
There are many causes of limp with pain in children; some of the more
common causes may be broadly categorized as being primarily orthopedic,
reactive, infectious, rheumatologic, or neoplastic. The prevalence of the specific diagnoses also varies by age. Limp without pain is usually due to congenital orthopedic anomalies or neuromuscular disorders.

387

CLINICAL CASES

In the specific case presented, there are several symptoms and signs that
make the diagnosis of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE) likely. The
absence of a specific injury is significant, as SCFE is the most common nontraumatic hip pathology in adolescents. The initial complaint of thigh pain
may lead to other considerations, but hip pathology will frequently present
with pain in the groin, thigh, or even the knee. The patient’s age and body
habitus are typical for SCFE, which is classically described as occurring most
often in overweight adolescent males. Pain with internal rotation of the hip
and the finding of external rotation on passive flexion of the affected hip are
also suggestive of SCFE.

APPROACH TO
Limping With Pain in Children
DEFINITIONS
AVASCULAR NECROSIS: Death of living bone tissue caused by disruption of

blood flow.
DYSPLASIA: Abnormal growth or development.

CLINICAL APPROACH
One of the key characteristics of the evaluation of the child with a limp is
assessing whether there is pain or no pain. In an antalgic gait, the cause of the
pain may range from the back to the foot (see Table 37–1). Therefore, unless
there is an obvious source of pain, the examination should include assessment
of the back, pelvis, buttock, leg, and foot. In the child who clings to the parent, separating the child from the parent will allow the clinician to observe
the child’s gait when they walk back to the parent. The child who walks stiffly
may be avoiding moving the spine indicating a possible discitis. Those with
inflammation or muscle weakness in the hip will move the torso over the
pathologic side (Trendelenburg gait). Inspecting the feet may show clawing of
the toes or cavus deformity, which are signs of neuromuscular conditions.
Because hip pathology often presents with vague pain and hip conditions
are likely to need emergent treatment, evaluation of the hip may be the most
important part of the examination of a patient in whom the site of pathology
is not immediately obvious. Internal rotation of the hip increases the intracapsular pressure within the acetabulum. Pain during a leg roll (supine child
with extended hip and knee; one examiner stabilizes the pelvis while another
rolls leg internally and externally) and limited internal rotation of less than
30 degrees may indicate infectious or orthopedic hip pathology. The FABER
test (Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation—the ipsilateral ankle placed on

X-rays should be obtained when the differential indicates a likelihood of
bony abnormalities. In nonverbal children, x-rays from hip to feet can find a
fracture in a significant minority of children with limp. A complete blood
count should be drawn if there is concern of an infectious cause. An erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) should be considered in evaluating infectious and rheumatologic etiologies. Consider Lyme
disease in endemic areas, as this can mimic both infectious and rheumatologic
causes of hip disorders. Any joint where septic arthritis is considered should
have a joint aspiration and evaluation of synovial fluid. Fever greater than
99.5°F and ESR greater than 20 is 97% sensitive for septic hip joint. Testing of
the fluid should include culture for gonorrhea in teens who are sexually active.
The evaluation of limping without pain (Table 37–2) should include measurements for leg length discrepancies (measure umbilicus to medial malleolus)

and observation for muscular atrophy or limb deformity. Barlow (hip and knee
flexed 90 degrees, hold the knee and attempt to displace the thigh posterior),
Ortolani (guided abduction), and Galeazzi (knee height discrepancy when
patient lies supine with ankles to buttocks and hips and knees flexed) tests
can be used to assess for congenital hip abnormalities and femoral length
discrepancies.

Infants and Toddlers
Common causes of limping in children in this age group are septic arthritis,
fractures, and complications of congenital hip dysplasia. Septic arthritis is usually monoarticular and associated with systemic signs such as fever. In young
infants, the symptoms may be less obvious, such as crying, irritability, and poor
feeding. Children who are ambulatory (crawlers or walkers) will often refuse to
do anything that puts weight on the affected joint because of pain. Infection
of a joint causes a septic effusion, which raises the pressure inside of the joint
capsule. Children with a septic hip joint will often lay with their hip flexed,
abducted, and externally rotated, which helps to reduce the pain, and they
will have significant pain with any internal rotation or extension of the joint.
Children with a septic joint will usually have an elevated white blood cell
count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).
Definitive diagnosis comes from joint aspiration. Any suspected septic joint
must be aspirated. In younger infants (4 months or younger), group B streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus are the most common pathogens involved. In
older infants and children under the age of 5 years, S aureus and Streptococcus
pyogenes are the usual causes. Treatment is urgent surgical irrigation and
debridement, along with antibiotics.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Unsuspected fractures—either stress fractures or traumatic fractures—can
present with pain and limping. Abuse must be suspected if the injury is inconsistent with the history presented, if the history changes with repeated questioning, if the child is said to have performed an act outside of his developmental
ability, or if a fracture usually associated with abuse is found (see Case 36).
However, the history may not reveal the source of the injury, as a child may
fall outside of the view of the parent. A traumatic injury may not result in
limping or in complete immobility, but may cause a change in how the child
ambulates. For example, a child who previously walked and now refuses to
walk but will crawl, may have an injury of the lower leg or foot.
A toddler’s fracture is one example of an unsuspected fracture that may
present primarily as a limp or a refusal to walk. This fracture is a spiral fracture of the tibia that results from twisting while the foot is planted. The
diagnosis may be suspected in the setting of an acute limp or change in ambulation, a normal examination of the knee and upper leg and tenderness of the
tibia. It can be confirmed with a plain film x-ray. Undiagnosed congenital
dysplasia of the hip may present as a painless limp that is present from the
time that the child learns to walk. All newborns and infants should have
their hips examined for instability or dislocation. If undiagnosed, contractures
may form that limit movement of the hip. When the child learns to walk, the
child will have a painless limp. The diagnosis may be confirmed by x-rays
showing abnormal hip alignment. If the problem is found in the first few
weeks of life, the child can be treated with splinting of the hip and normal
development usually follows. If diagnosed late, the treatment is often surgical.

Young Children
Transient synovitis is a self-limited inflammatory response that is a common cause of hip pain in children. It occurs typically in children ages 3 to 10 years,
is more common in boys than in girls, and often follows a viral infection. It
is frequently seen as gradually increasing hip pain that results in a limp or
refusal to walk. These children have a low-grade or no fever, a normal white
blood cell (WBC) count, and a normal ESR. On examination, there is pain
with internal rotation of the hip and the overall range of motion is limited by
pain. X-rays are either normal or show some nonspecific swelling. In a situation where the patient is afebrile, has pain-free rotation of hip greater than
30 degree, has a normal WBC count, normal ESR, and short-term follow-up can
be assured, the patient can be followed clinically and should improve in a few
days. If these conditions are not met and the diagnosis of a septic joint is considered, or if a patient followed expectantly continues to worsen, an aspiration
should be done. A septic joint will have a purulent aspirate with a WBC
count greater than 50,000/μL; transient synovitis will have a yellow/clear
aspirate with a lower WBC count (<10,000/μL).

CLINICAL CASES

391

Legg-Calvé-Perthes (LCP) disease is an avascular necrosis of the femoral
head that typically occurs in children ages 4 to 8 years. It is much more common
in boys than in girls. Any disruption of blood flow to the femoral capital epiphysis, such as trauma or infection, may cause avascular necrosis. In LCP disease,
the etiology of the disruption of blood flow is unknown. Children typically have
a gradual onset of hip, thigh, or knee pain, and limping over a few months. Early
in the course, x-rays of the hip may appear normal. Later radiographic findings
include collapse, flattening, and widening of the femoral head. Bone scans or
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.
The treatment is usually conservative, with protection of the joint and efforts
to maintain range of motion. Children who develop more severe necrosis or
who develop the disease at older ages may have a worse outcome and a higher
risk of developing degenerative arthritis.

Adolescents
The capital femoral epiphysis is the growth plate that connects the metaphysis (femoral head) to the diaphysis (shaft of the femur). A slipped capital
femoral epiphysis is a separation of this growth plate, which results in the
femoral head being medially and posteriorly displaced. This may be caused by
an acute injury, but more often is not. It is most often seen in overweight adolescent boys and presents as pain in the hip, thigh, or knee along with a limp.
Examination reveals limited internal rotation and obligate external rotation
when the hip is passively flexed. Early x-rays may show only widening of the
epiphysis; later x-rays can show the slippage of the femoral head in relation to
the femoral neck. The treatment is surgical pinning of the femoral head.
These patients must be closely followed, as approximately 33% will develop
avascular necrosis and 33% will develop SCFE in the contralateral hip.
Other causes of limb pain are common in adolescents. Sprains, strains, and
overuse injuries are the most common cause of limb pain in this population,
and are usually readily diagnosed on history and examination (see Case 12).
Sexually active adolescents or teens are at risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and their complications, including gonococcal arthritis. In this
population, an appropriate history, sexual history, and review of systems are
necessary.

All Ages
Septic arthritis, fractures, neuromuscular disorders, and neoplasms can cause
a limp in children of all ages. Pain that wakens the child at night is suspicious
for malignancy. “Growing pains” is a diagnosis of exclusion. It should be considered if the pain is only at night, is bilateral, is not present during the day,
and if no other pathology is found.

Comprehension Questions
37.1

A 6-year-old boy is brought in for evaluation of a painful hip. He has been
limping and not wanting to walk for the past 2 days. He has had no obvious injury. He feels a little better if he is given some ibuprofen. He has not
had a fever and does not have any other current symptoms, although he
had “the flu” last week. On examination, his vital signs are normal. His
right hip has some pain with internal rotation. He walks with a pronounced limp. Which of the following statements is most appropriate?
A. He can be sent home with a prescription for ibuprofen.
B. He should have a complete blood count (CBC) and ESR.
C. He should have an aspiration of his hip in the office.
D. If he has a normal x-ray, no further workup is needed.

37.2

An 18-month-old African American girl is brought into your office
because she has been crying and stopped walking today. She will
crawl, however. Her mother denies any injury to the child. On examination, she is crying but consolable in her mother’s arms. She has
bruising and swelling just proximal to the left ankle. An x-ray reveals
a spiral fracture of the tibia. Which of the following best describes your
advice to the mother of the patient?
A. You are going to report this to child protective services as suspected abuse.
B. You are going to refer the child for a bone biopsy because this is a
pathologic fracture that may represent a neoplasm.
C. This is a common fracture resulting from twisting on a planted foot.
D. You should draw blood to evaluate for sickle cell disease, which
may cause infarction of the bone.

37.3

A 2-year-old boy is brought in with fever and poor feeding. He started
getting sick yesterday and has worsened significantly today. He has had
no recent illnesses or injuries, and no known ill contacts. On examination, his temperature is 101°F (38.3°C), he is tachycardic, and he
appears ill. He is lying on his back with his left leg flexed and abducted
at the hip. A head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination
is normal, the heart is tachycardic but regular, and the lungs are clear.
The abdomen is nontender and has normal bowel sounds. He screams
in pain when you move his left leg from its resting position. Blood work
reveals an elevated WBC count of 15,000 mm3 and an ESR of 45 mm/h
(normal: 0-10). An x-ray of his left hip shows a widened joint space but
no fractures. Which of the following is your next step at this point?
A. Oral antibiotic and follow-up in 1 day.
B. MRI of the hip and referral to an orthopedist.
C. Anti-inflammatory medication and close follow-up.
D. Hip joint aspiration.

CLINICAL CASES

37.4

393

A 6-year-old boy appears in the office with a 2-month history of slight
limp. He has no significant past medical history and takes no medications. He has normal vital signs and is noted to have antalgic gait and
decreased range of motion in the left hip (internal rotation more limited).
He has mild pain on palpation of the anterior capsule on the left side.
X-ray shows fragmentation of the femoral head. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Toxic synovitis of hip
B. Avascular necrosis of hip (Legg-Calvé-Perthes)
C. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis
D. Femoral shaft fracture

ANSWERS
37.1

B. The case presented is suspicious for transient synovitis following
a viral illness. A CBC and ESR should be drawn. With a normal
CBC and ESR, and if follow-up can be assured, this child could be
treated expectantly, given an oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) with the expectation of a recovery in a few days.

37.2

C. The case presented is classic for a toddler’s fracture. Spiral fractures of other long bones (femur, humerus) are more suspicious for
abuse. Orthopedic referral is appropriate for management, but a bone
biopsy or further workup is not necessary at this time.

37.3

D. The child in this case has all of the symptoms and signs of a septic hip joint. This situation demands a joint aspiration to confirm the
diagnosis. If it is confirmed, he should be promptly referred for urgent
surgical management.

37.4

B. This child is in the correct gender and age group with signs, symptoms, and radiologic findings associated with Legg-Calve’-Perthes
disease. It is often a self-healing disorder. Treatment is focused on
limiting pain and avoiding functional loss. Depending on severity
and age, treatment may include watchful waiting, physical therapy,
casting, and surgery

Clinical Pearls
➤ Hip pathology may not cause hip pain; it may cause groin, thigh, or knee
pain instead.
➤ Because of the high risk of bilateral disease, follow-up in SCFE cases should
include examination and x-rays of the unaffected hip until the growth
plate closes.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the different causes of postoperative fever based on the timing of
onset, nature of surgery, and patient’s risk factors.
2. Understand the different clinical presentations that point to the etiology
of postoperative fever.

Considerations
This 70-year-old man with history of hypertension and BPH is at high risk for
UTI because he recently underwent a pelvic procedure under spinal anesthesia and because he has urinary retention secondary to BPH. In addition, the
use of a urethral catheter poses an additional risk for bacterial seeding of the
urinary bladder. Suprapubic pain and costovertebral tenderness are physical
findings suggestive of UTI, most likely acute pyelonephritis. For those without a urethral catheter, symptoms such as dysuria, urgency, and frequency are
common. UTI is high on the list of causes of fever in the third postoperative
day, although it could also occur anytime during the postoperative period.
Urinalysis may detect presence of bacteriuria, pyuria, nitrites, and leukocyte
esterase. Urine culture would determine the type of offending organism, the
most common of which are Escherichia coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Staphylococcus
epidermidis, Pseudomonas, and Candida. In this patient, the urethral catheter
needs to be changed now and discontinued as soon as he is able to void on his
own. Symptomatic patients and those who are at high risk for infection are

usually treated with appropriate IV antibiotics according to the most likely
pathogens. The antibiotics subsequently can be adjusted based on culture
results. Blood cultures should be ordered if urosepsis is suspected. Most importantly, it is crucial to address and treat the cause of urinary retention (eg,
BPH, kidney stone) to prevent recurrence and avoid complications.

APPROACH TO
Postoperative Fever
DEFINITIONS
DRUG FEVER: Fever that coincides with the administration of a particular

drug and cannot otherwise be explained by clinical and laboratory findings.
Resolution of the fever occurs with discontinuation of the suspected drug.
Drugs that are usually implicated are β-lactams, sulfa derivatives, heparin, and
amphotericin B.
MALIGNANT HYPERTHERMIA: A rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by fever of greater than 104°F (40°C), tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, and calcium accumulation in skeletal muscle leading to rigidity. This may
occur up to 24 hours after exposure to certain anesthetic agents such as
halothane and succinylcholine. Treatment includes supportive therapy, such
as antipyretics, oxygen, cooling blankets, and dantrolene IV.
SURGICAL SITE INFECTION (SSI): A concept introduced by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and various consensus panels to replace
the term surgical wound infection. This refers to any infection that occurs in the
site of surgery and classified as superficial, deep, or organ/space SSI.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Fever (defined as >38.3°C/101.0°F) is the most common postoperative complication, occurring in 50% of major surgery in the immediate postoperative
period. As an integral part of informed consent prior to surgery, patients
need to be made aware by the physician of the possibility of experiencing
postoperative febrile episodes. In addition, adequate preoperative evaluation,
which includes performing a history and physical examination to identify risk
factors, medications, nutritional status, and comorbid conditions, is imperative to avoid possible life-threatening situations during the perioperative
period. Preoperative and perioperative strategies can be used to reduce the
risk of developing a postoperative fever (Table 38–1). Fortunately, postoperative fever typically resolves spontaneously and most of the time does not necessarily indicate the presence of infection.

The etiology of postoperative fever could be infectious or noninfectious
(Tables 38–2 and 38–3). The mnemonic “5 Ws” helps in remembering the
most common causes of postoperative fever in roughly the order of frequency:
wind (pneumonia), water (UTI), wound (SSI), walk (deep venous thrombosis
[DVT]), and wonder drugs (drug fever). When a surgical patient develops
fever, the differential diagnosis and investigative methods are directed by the
timing of the fever, the type of surgery performed, the preexisting clinical conditions, and the presenting symptoms. A thorough physical examination
should be initiated, followed by inspection of the surgical site, review of all
medications, and request for necessary laboratory tests. If three or more of the
following risk factors are present, the likelihood of infection as the source of
fever approaches 100%.
• Preoperative trauma
• American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score greater than 2
•
•
•
•

(patient with mild systemic disease or worse)
Onset on the second postoperative day
White blood cell (WBC) count greater than 10,000 cells/mm3
Blood urea nitrogen (BUN) greater than 15 mg/dL
Systemic manifestations such as chills and rigors

Tissue trauma during surgery stimulates an inflammatory response that leads
to release of pyrogenic cytokines (eg, interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, interferon) from the tissues. Elevated levels of bacterial endotoxins and exotoxins
that are released from the colon as a result of surgical complications also elicit
the same inflammatory response. This reaction leads to elevation of the thermoregulatory set point and production of fever (temperature >100.5°F [38°C]).

immediate postoperative fever is bacteremia, which occurs more commonly in
urologic procedures that involve instrumentation, for example, transurethral
resection of the prostate. Gram-negative bacteria are the most common pathogen.
Within 30 to 45 minutes, the patient develops chills and temperature that
could exceed 104°F (40°C). Accompanying symptoms such as tachycardia,
tachypnea, oliguria, and hypotension are common.
If fever occurs within 36 hours post-laparotomy, there are two important
infectious etiologies to be kept in mind—bowel injury with leakage of gastrointestinal contents into the peritoneum and invasive soft-tissue wound
infection caused by b-hemolytic streptococci or Clostridium species. The former
is accompanied by hemodynamic instability. Least common in this setting is
toxic shock syndrome caused by Staphylococcus aureus.
Within the first 48 to 72 postoperative hours, atelectasis (partial collapse of
peripheral alveoli) causes 90% of pulmonary complications of surgery.
Contrary to popular beliefs, recent literature disputes its association with fever
and found their coexistence to be merely coincidental. The alveolar collapse is
compounded by the loss of functional residual capacity in almost all patients,
and 50% reduction of vital capacity intraoperatively. Chest x-ray may reveal
discoid infiltrate and an elevated hemidiaphragm. Certain conditions make

CLINICAL CASES

401

atelectasis more likely, including heavy cigarette smoking, prior lung resection, old age, malnutrition, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), prolonged procedure, abdominal distension, and thoracic or abdominal incision.
The use of narcotics and anesthesia could also affect the patient’s breathing pattern. Instructing the patient on deep inspiration and coughing, the use
of incentive spirometry, and the provision of adequate pain control can facilitate the opening of the alveoli.
Without resolution of atelectasis, pneumonia may ensue, on the third postoperative day, when the build up of secretions facilitates growth of bacteria.
Patients who are on mechanical ventilators are at highest risk for pneumonia
(ventilator-associated pneumonia). Fever associated with productive cough,
pulmonary crackles, elevation of WBCs, positive sputum culture, and infiltrates
in chest x-ray are the usual indicators of pulmonary infection. Appropriate use
of broad-spectrum IV antibiotic therapy is the treatment. Aspiration as the
possible cause of pneumonia should be suspected in the elderly, those who
reside in a nursing home, and those with neurologic dysphagia, altered mentation, and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Gram-negative coverage is
required for aspiration pneumonia, with the current agents of choice being
piperacillin/tazobactam or ticarcillin/clavulanate. It is also around this time
that UTI should be entertained as part of differential diagnosis. UTIs can be
treated with similar agents or with a fluoroquinolone.
The patient with persistent fever 5 to 7 days after surgery needs to have a
thorough examination of the operative site to check for signs of infection,
which include erythema, pain, local edema, and purulent discharge. Surgical
site infection has markedly decreased through wide practice of aseptic technique. Patients at high risk of wound infection are those who underwent
lengthy surgical procedure, who received blood transfusion, those who are malnourished, and those who have diabetes mellitus. Skin site infections may be
treated with oxacillin or with vancomycin if methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (MRSA) is common in the institution or environment. Deep abdominal
infections are often treated with a cephalosporin, such as cefoxitin, or a combination of fluoroquinolone plus metronidazole to cover anaerobic infections.
Drug fevers are often associated with rash and/or lupus-like syndromes.
They also may have renal, liver, or hematologic dysfunction associated with
the drug toxicity. Common medications associated with drug fever include
cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, and penicillins.
Purulent drainage and fluctuance indicate the presence of abscess, which
requires incision and drainage. When cellulitis is confirmed, treatment with
antibiotic is warranted. Gram-positive bacteria, such as S aureus, S epidermidis
(especially with implants or devices), Streptococcus pyogenes, and Enterococcus,
are important pathogens. Fungal etiology should not be ruled out in patients
with severe comorbid conditions. On rare occasions, deep abscesses produce
fever 10 to 15 days after surgery. A high level of suspicion leads to diagnostic
imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scan of the body region most

402

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

likely to be infected, which depends on the location of the surgery. Interventional
radiology specialists could be called upon for radiologically guided drainage of
the abscess, which is the definitive treatment. Antibiotics should include coverage for Gram-negative enteric bacilli and anaerobes. Gallium scans may be
helpful in finding sites of infection in patients without localizing symptoms
and workup.
Intravascular catheter or line-associated infection needs to be entertained when the patient has had IV devices for 3 days or more, even when the
site appears clean. Any unnecessary lines should be discontinued, as they are
potential sites of infection. The catheter tip is cultured to reveal the offending organism that would direct treatment.
Fever caused by deep venous thrombosis usually occurs on the fifth postoperative day. Half of the time patients with DVT are asymptomatic.
Common complaints are leg edema, tenderness, pain, and warmth. Homan
sign (pain in the calf on foot dorsiflexion) is demonstrated in some cases.
When possible, surgical patients are encouraged to ambulate early; otherwise,
compression devices and subcutaneous heparin or low-molecular-weight
heparin are useful prophylactic measures. Diagnosis is made by duplex ultrasound, but most accurately confirmed with venography. Patients who develop
pulmonary embolism usually have concomitant DVT. The treatment of DVT
and pulmonary embolism is initiated with low-molecular-weight heparin or
unfractionated heparin, followed by warfarin.
The type of surgery also provides a clue as to the associated risks of feverassociated surgical morbidity. In general, laparoscopic surgery comparatively
causes fewer cases of fever than open surgery. Pleural effusion develops in all
patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery and 5% of those patients acquire
pneumonia. Particularly unique to abdominal surgery is deep abdominal
abscess and pancreatitis. Obstetric and gynecologic surgery could be complicated by postpartum endometritis, deep pelvic abscess, and pelvic thrombophlebitis. SSI is the most common infectious cause of fever in orthopedic
surgery. Prostatic and perinephric abscess are more commonly seen in urologic
procedures. Patients undergoing genitourinary procedure are at greater risk of
having UTI. Meningitis is a common cause of fever following a neurosurgical
procedure. Neurosurgery patients, who are usually immobilized and less
aggressively anticoagulated to avoid brain hemorrhage, have the highest incidence of DVT.

38.1

A 60-year-old man with adenocarcinoma of the colon underwent left
hemicolectomy with primary anastomosis. Thirty hours after surgery,
he was found to have a fever of 102°F (38.8°C), blood pressure of
90/60 mm Hg, heart rate of 140 bpm, respirations of 24 breaths per
minute, and low urine output. Physical examination showed diffuse
abdominal tenderness. The surgical site is clean and Gram stain did
not show any organism. Urinalysis (UA) was negative and the complete blood count (CBC) showed leukocytosis. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient’s fever?
A. Pneumonia
B. Intraperitoneal leak from bowel injury
C. Surgical site infection
D. Deep tissue abscess

38.2

An 84-year-old nursing home resident underwent emergency open
cholecystectomy under general anesthesia. She has advanced Parkinson’s
disease, hypertension, and diabetes, and who was receiving nutrition
via nasogastric tube (NGT). On the second postoperative day, she was
noted to be coughing and vomiting. Four days later, she had a temperature of 102°F (38.8°C), heart rate of 90 bpm, respiratory rate of
25 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 120/70 mm Hg, and oxygen
saturation of 87% on room air. She had a productive cough with what
the nursing staff describes as “putrid sputum.” Lung auscultation
showed crackles on the right and a chest radiograph revealed a patchy
infiltrate in the right lung. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Obtain an expectorated sputum sample for culture.
B. Treat empirically with antibiotics.
C. Insert a nasogastric tube.
D. Treat with an H2-receptor antagonist.

A 42-year-old man underwent open reduction and internal fixation of a
comminuted fracture of the right femur. He was doing well until the
fifth postoperative day, when he complained of pleuritic chest pain and
developed fever of 101°F (38.3°C), heart rate of 118 bpm, respiration of
30 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 130/85 mm Hg, and oxygen saturation of 85% on room air. His left ankle became edematous, warm,
and tender. Which of the following is a risk factor for his condition?
A. Having an IV in his arm for more than 3 days
B. Failure to adequately use his incentive spirometer
C. Urinary bladder catheterization
D. Prolonged immobility

A 50-year-old woman with diabetes was recuperating from left
inguinal hernia repair. Her glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) prior to
surgery was 10%. During postoperative follow-up a week after surgery,
the surgical site was markedly erythematous, warm, and tender with
pus. Which of the following is the next step in treatment?
A. Apply topical antibiotic to the surgical site.
B. Warm compresses alone will relieve the inflammation.
C. Open the surgical site and drain the infected material.
D. Send the patient home with prescription for oral antibiotics for 7 days.

ANSWERS
38.1

B. In the presence of severe hemodynamic changes and diffuse abdominal tenderness, intraperitoneal leak is the most common cause of fever
in the first 36 hours after laparotomy.

38.2

B. This patient likely has aspiration pneumonia. She has risk factors
including her age, functional status, recent general anesthesia, and
advanced neurologic disease. She requires treatment with antibiotics
which cover anaerobic bacteria. There is evidence that aspiration
risk may be reduced by placing a nasogastric tube before surgery but
long term use actually predisposes a person to aspiration pneumonia.
Giving the patient a histamine H2-receptor antagonist may also
decrease the risk of aspiration by decreasing gastric acid secretion. It
is a preventative measure. Expectorated sputum is unreliable for
anaerobic cultures because of likely contamination by oral flora.

38.3

D. This patient has DVT and concomitant pulmonary embolism (PE).
Risk factors include prolonged immobility, vascular damage, and
hypercoagulability.

38.4

C. Incision and drainage is the most important therapy for SSI.
Antibiotics are used solely in cases of significant systemic involvement.

Case 39
You were busy seeing patients in your outpatient clinic when you heard
a commotion coming from the waiting room. You went to check and
found a very frantic mother and her 2-year-old son who is clutching his
throat, coughing, drooling, and visibly struggling to breathe. The
mother endorses that just a few minutes ago, the child was running
around while eating grapes when she suddenly heard him gagging and
wheezing. Her son has an appointment for well-child examination and
he is apparently doing well. He has no significant history of respiratory
illness. The toddler is still conscious but unable to talk, and his cough is
becoming weaker. Breath sounds are decreased bilaterally, with wheezing and stridor heard on auscultation. You tried to ventilate the patient
with the chin-lift maneuver but the chest fails to rise. You opened the
mouth but you are unable to see any foreign object.

ANSWERS TO CASE 39:
Acute Causes of Wheezing Other than
Asthma in Children
Summary: A 2-year-old boy had acute onset of coughing, choking, drooling,
and wheezing while eating grapes. He is unable to speak and his cough is
weak. He was in a good state of health prior to the incident and has no history of respiratory illness. Physical examination reveals decreased breath
sounds, wheezing, and stridor. There is no chest rise on ventilation attempt.
No foreign object could be seen on his mouth.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Foreign-body airway obstruction.

➤

Next step in the management for this patient: Heimlich maneuver
(subdiaphragmatic abdominal thrusts).

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Identify the illnesses, other than asthma, that cause acute wheezing in
children.
2. Understand the steps in the diagnosis and management of a wheezing child.

Considerations
Acute onset of wheezing in an otherwise healthy child similar to the above
case should raise the suspicion for foreign-body airway obstruction (FBAO).
Witnessed swallowing followed by choking is not necessary for diagnosis, but
as much information should be gathered surrounding the onset of symptoms.
FBAO is common among children age 6 months to 3 years old, accounting for
approximately 70% of cases. Small toys and objects, balloons, and food (eg,
nuts, grapes, and candies) are high-risk objects for aspiration. Older children
may be able to identify the object they swallowed and assume the posture of
clutching their neck with their hand (universal choking sign). Symptoms
such as weak cough, inability to speak or cry, high-pitched sounds, or no
sounds during inhalation, cyanosis, choking, vomiting, drooling, wheezing,
blood-streaked saliva, and respiratory distress are clues to the diagnosis of
FBAO. Physical findings of unilateral wheezing, unequal or decreased breath
sounds, and stridor are common. In children, the foreign body could lodge on
either side of the airway. If the foreign body lodges in the esophagus, acute
wheezing is still possible when the obstruction compresses on the airways.

CLINICAL CASES

409

One should not attempt to remove the foreign object in a child who is
actively coughing. Blind finger sweep is not recommended because of the danger of further obstruction or injury. Although the patient mentioned above is
still conscious, he seems to have ineffective coughing and is beginning to get
tired. Ventilation should be attempted while opening the airway with the headtilt maneuver, which could also relieve the obstruction. In the above case, an
attempt to remove the foreign object was initiated when ventilation was unsuccessful.
Since no foreign object is visualized, a series of abdominal thrusts
(Heimlich maneuver) should be the next step to try to expel the foreign body.
In infants, back blows and chest thrusts are performed instead of abdominal
thrusts, which could cause iatrogenic trauma to the liver and stomach, which
are not protected by the rib cage at that age. If the child continues to deteriorate even after 1 minute of resuscitative efforts and the above maneuvers fail
to expel the foreign object, the emergency medical services (EMS) system
should be activated while continuing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).
In the hospital setting, a bronchoscopic procedure is the treatment of
choice. Chest x-ray is often normal, but in some cases shows a radiopaque foreign object or identifies localized hyperinflation and/or atelectasis. Most deaths
from FBAO occur in children younger than 5 years of age; 65% are infants.

APPROACH TO
Wheezing
DEFINITIONS
HEIMLICH MANEUVER: Performed by standing or sitting behind the person who is choking and placing the thumb side of one fist between the navel
and the xiphoid process. The other hand grasps the fisted hand and a series of
upward abdominal thrusts are delivered to create an “artificial cough” in a
choking victim in an effort to dislodge the object blocking the airway.
STRIDOR: Wheezing coming from obstruction of the large airway that has a
constant pitch and intensity throughout the entire inspiratory effort.
WHEEZING: A musical sound heard on pulmonary auscultation produced by
the oscillating walls of airways that had been narrowed by mucus, inflammation, and so on.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Among the many causes of wheezing in children, asthma and viral infections
are most common. Worldwide studies show that approximately 10% to 15%
of infants wheeze in the first 12 months of life. The diagnosis of wheezing

410

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

hinges on accurate history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and even
response to treatments. It is also important to gather information regarding
the age of onset, exposure to cigarette smoke, presence of allergic signs and
symptoms, frequency of wheezing, association with vomiting or feeding, and
other accompanying symptoms.
The etiology of acute wheezing in children could be infectious (eg, bronchiolitis) or mechanical obstruction (eg, FBAO). Recurrent wheezing, on the
other hand, encompasses anomalies of the tracheobronchial tree (eg, bronchomalacia), cardiovascular disease (eg, vascular rings and slings), gastroesophageal reflux, and immunologic disorders (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
cystic fibrosis). This case concentrates on acute onset of wheezing other than
asthma in children (Case 6 provides a more detailed discussion of asthma).

Bronchiolitis
Bronchiolitis is the most common acute cause of wheezing in children
younger than 2 years of age, especially in infants who are 1 to 3 months old.
Infants younger than 6 months are most severely affected, owing to smaller,
more easily obstructed airways and a decreased ability to clear secretions. It is
a viral infection causing nonspecific inflammation of the small airways and
peaks during the winter months. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts
for 70% of cases; the rest are caused by parainfluenza, adenovirus, Mycoplasma,
and metapneumovirus. These viruses elicit inflammatory and immune
responses that produce mucus, edema, and cellular debris that block the small
airways. The introduction of the influenza vaccine reduced the incidence of
bronchiolitis caused by the flu virus.
Initially, the child develops rhinorrhea and wheezing followed by lowgrade fever. On succeeding days, rhinorrhea will be more copious and the
child may also experience cough, irritability, and varying degrees of dyspnea.
As a result, the infant may have poor oral intake and possibly dehydration.
Profuse coryza, congestion, pharyngitis, nasal discharge, and fever usually
characterize the clinical syndrome in children. Primary RSV infections are
confined to the upper airways in more than 50% of patients. Symptoms reach
a peak in 2 to 5 days, with involvement of the lower respiratory tract. Typical
symptoms include cough, dyspnea, wheezing, and poor feeding.
Physical examination may reveal wheezing, fine crackles, prolonged expiratory phase, tachypnea, and increased work of breathing as evidenced by
nasal flaring, intercostals retraction, and even apnea. Other physical findings
often include otitis media, irritability, and hypothermia or hyperthermia.
The diagnosis of bronchiolitis is based on clinical presentation, the patient’s
age, seasonal occurrence, and findings from the physical examination. Tests are
typically used to exclude other diagnoses, such as bacterial pneumonia, sepsis,
or congestive heart failure, or to confirm a viral etiology and determine required
infection control for patients admitted to the hospital.

CLINICAL CASES

411

Current literature does not support the routine use of laboratory tests as
they do not alter clinical outcomes. If the diagnosis is doubtful or the clinical
presentation is unusual, one may request a chest x-ray. Radiologic findings in
individuals with bronchiolitis are variable and may include bronchial wall
thickening, tiny nodules, linear opacities, atelectasis, patchy alveolar opacities,
and lobar consolidation. A complete blood count (CBC) is usually normal.
There are available assays for RSV and influenza that often are unnecessary,
unless the patient is to be admitted and placed in a room with other RSVpositive infants. Sputum culture is requested if bacterial superinfection or
pneumonia is suspected.
RSV bronchiolitis is a self-limited disease and can be safely managed in an
outpatient setting. However, disease manifestation can be variable, and risk
factors for severe disease include preexisting cardiac or pulmonary disease,
premature birth, very young age (<2-3 months), nosocomial RSV infection,
and, in some studies, low socioeconomic status. Patients who are in respiratory distress, younger than 3 months old or premature, those with comorbid
conditions, lethargy, hypoxemia, or hypercarbia, and those with atelectasis or
consolidation in chest radiograph need to be hospitalized.
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), in collaboration with the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), recommends supplemental oxygen
and supportive care as the modes of treatment with clear evidence of effectiveness in RSV bronchiolitis.
Supportive care should consist of supplemental humidified oxygen, fluids,
and the suctioning of nasal and pharyngeal secretions. The most important
therapy is humidified oxygen. Medications have a limited role in the management of bronchiolitis. Several drugs are commonly used, but little or inconclusive evidence supports the routine use of any drug in the management of
bronchiolitis. Nebulized bronchodilators, cool mist, steroids, antibiotics, ribavirin have insufficient evidence or have not been shown to help in previously healthy children. Steroids and bronchodilators may help if there is
underlying asthma, but should be discontinued if initial trials fail to show significant clinical improvement.
Symptomatic treatment includes head elevation, suctioning of secretions
after spraying the nasal passages with saline; antipyretics for fever; humidified
oxygen for hypoxemia; and adequate hydration. If the infant is at high risk for
aspiration, IV fluids may be the safest way to deliver nutrients. A therapeutic
trial with albuterol, especially in infants with personal or family history of
allergies, could identify a few responders. Parents of infants with bronchiolitis should be instructed not to expose the infant to cigarette smoke and educated on frequent handwashing to prevent transmission of the disease.
For infants with congenital heart disease or chronic lung disease, the antiviral agent ribavirin via aerosol can be considered, but has not been proven to
alter mortality and length of illness. Administration of RSV immunoglobulin

who were born prematurely or who suffer from chronic lung disease. The costeffectiveness of prophylaxis, however, is still debatable. In most cases, the illness
is self-limited with usual duration of 2 to 4 days. A protracted course (months)
can occur in around 20% of patients. Mortality is less than 1% and could be
attributed to apnea, respiratory acidosis, and severe dehydration. The single best
indicator of severity is low pulse oximetry. Indicators of mild disease include good
po intake, age greater than 2 months, oxygen saturation greater than or equal
to 94%, and age-based respiratory rate (< 45 0-2 months, < 43 2-6 months, and
<40 6-24 months). Children who had experienced bronchiolitis are at higher
risk of developing asthma.

Croup
Croup is the most common cause of airway obstruction in children ages 6 months
to 6 years old, and is the leading cause of hospitalization for children younger
than 4 years old. It is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the subglottic region of the larynx that produces the characteristic barking cough, hoarseness, stridor, and different degrees of respiratory distress that are more severe at
night. The croup syndrome encompasses laryngotracheitis, laryngotracheobronchitis, laryngotracheobronchopneumonitis, and spasmodic croup.
Croup usually occurs during fall and winter. Common organisms involved
are parainfluenza, adenovirus, RSV, rhinovirus, Enterovirus, influenza viruses,
and rarely, Mycoplasma pneumoniae. The prodrome is characterized by 12 to
72 hours of runny nose and low-grade fever. Hypoxia only occurs in severe cases.
These symptoms peak from 1 to 2 days, and in most cases, resolve in 1 week.
Diagnosis is made through clinical presentation. However, imaging studies
confirm the diagnoses. Frontal neck x-rays show the “steeple sign,” which is
indicative of subglottic narrowing of the tracheal lumen. When the diagnosis
is uncertain, computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck offers a more sensitive evaluation.
Treatment is geared toward the severity of the croup (ie, the level of respiratory depression). Mild croup does not require any specific therapy, but a single
dose of corticosteroid may reduce need for hospitalization. Moderate-to-severe
croup entails a more comprehensive and intense approach.
Emergency management of croup should begin with assessment of airway
obstruction; oxygen should be used liberally. There is no proof that humidified air is of value and mist tents should be avoided.
Hospitalize if severe croup is clinically apparent. Severe croup is exemplified by cyanosis, decreased level of consciousness, progressive stridor, severe
stridor, severe retractions, markedly decreased air movement, toxic appearance, severe dehydration, and social factors limiting adequacy of outpatient
monitoring. Children who are hospitalized with croup should be monitored
closely and frequent physical examination needs to be performed.

CLINICAL CASES

413

The following medications should be avoided: sedatives, opiates, expectorants, bronchodilators, and antihistamines. Corticosteroids (nebulized, IM, or
oral), and nebulized racemic epinephrine can be used in moderate to severe
cases. Patients who receive epinephrine should be observed for 4 hours to
monitor for rebound of symptoms.

Epiglottitis
Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the supraglottic tissue and surrounding
areas that causes rapidly progressive airway obstruction. It usually affects children
younger than 5 years old and is most commonly caused by bacteria such as
Haemophilus influenzae, H parainfluenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus
aureus, and b-hemolytic streptococcus A, B, and C. With the introduction of
the H influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine, there has been a steady decline in cases
of epiglottitis. Within 24 hours, the patient with epiglottitis would appear
“toxic” and develop fever, severe sore throat, muffled speech (“hot potato
voice”), drooling, and dysphagia. The child usually is noticeably anxious and
assumes the sitting position, leaning forward on outstretched arms with chin
thrust forward and neck hyperextended (tripod position) so as to increase the
airway diameter.
With progression of airway obstruction, the patient may begin to have wheezing and stridor. Epiglottitis is a medical emergency and visualization to confirm
the presence of severely erythematous epiglottis is preferably done in the operating room with experienced surgeon or anesthesiologist. The patient should be
kept in a calm environment to prevent sudden airway obstruction. CBC usually
shows leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and bandemia. The radiographic finding that is
characteristic of epiglottitis is the “thumb sign” or protrusion of the enlarged
epiglottis from the anterior wall of the hypopharynx seen on a lateral neck x-ray.
Cultures of the blood and epiglottis yield the pathogenic bacteria. Treatment
consists of appropriate antibiotics (oxacillin or nafcillin; cefazolin; clindamycin
and ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) and airway management, usually in an ICU setting with a team ready to respond for intubation or tracheostomy. Death results
from hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis that lead to cardiorespiratory failure.

Abscesses
Deep abscesses of the neck are less common causes of acute wheezing, but
they have the potential to be very serious. They are located in the peritonsillar, retropharyngeal, and pharyngomaxillary spaces.
Retropharyngeal abscess affects children 2 to 4 years. The abscess is usually caused by extension of pharyngeal infection, penetrating trauma, iatrogenic instrumentation, or foreign body. Children with this condition present
with fever, drooling, dysphagia, odynophagia, stridor, and respiratory distress.
Physical examination may indicate tender enlarged cervical lymphadenopathy,
cervical spine ROM limitation, possible stridor, and wheezing. Diagnosis is

414

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

made by lateral neck films which show bulging in posterior pharynx (prevertebral soft tissue more abundant in children during expiration). Treatment
utilizes antibiotics such as cephalosporins or antistaphylococcal penicillins.
Incision and drainage is also an option.
Peritonsillar abscess is an infection of the superior pole of the tonsils and
is more common in young teenagers. Fever, severe sore throat, muffled voice,
drooling, trismus, and neck pain are typical symptoms. Enlarged tonsils with
abscess, cervical adenopathy, and deviation of the uvula may be obvious on
physical examination. CT scan of the neck is the most helpful diagnostic
modality for identifying deep neck abscesses. The predominant pathogens are
Streptococcus pyogenes, S aureus, and anaerobes. Ampicillin-sulbactam or clindamycin, if PCN allergic, for 14 days is appropriate treatment. Drainage of the
abscess is indicated either as first-line treatment or when antimicrobial agents
fail to produce adequate result. Serious complications from deep abscesses
result from airway obstruction, septicemia, aspiration, jugular vein thrombosis/
thrombophlebitis, carotid artery rupture, and mediastinitis.

Comprehension Questions
39.1

A 7-month-old baby was brought by her mother to an outpatient
clinic because of a 2-day history of fever, copious nasal secretions, and
wheezing. The mother volunteered that the baby has been healthy
and has not had these symptoms in the past. The infant’s temperature
is noted to be 100.7°F (38.1°C), her respiratory rate is 50 breaths per
minute, and her pulse oximetry is 95% on room air. Physical examination reveals no signs of dehydration, but wheezing is heard on bilateral
lung fields on auscultation. The infant shows no improvement after
three treatments with nebulized albuterol. Which of the following is
the recommended treatment?
A. Continued nebulized albuterol every 4 hours
B. Antihistamines and decongestants
C. Antibiotics for 7 days
D. Initiate synagis
E. Supportive care with hydration and humidified oxygen

39.2

A 9-year-old girl is being seen in your office with fever and difficulty
breathing. You are concerned about the diagnosis of epiglottitis. Which
of the following is the most accurate statement regarding epiglottitis?
A. Child usually prefers to be in prone position.
B. Radiographic finding of “steeple sign.”
C. Every effort should be made to visualize the epiglottis in the office
to confirm the diagnosis.
D. Diagnosis is decreasing in incidence.

CLINICAL CASES

415

39.3

A 5-year-old child is brought into the office due to the mother’s concern
of difficulty breathing. On examination wheezing is noted. In which of
the following conditions is antibiotic therapy most appropriate?
A. Asthma
B. Epiglottitis
C. Croup
D. Bronchiolitis
E. Foreign-body aspiration

39.4

A 12-year-old girl was brought to the emergency department because
of severe sore throat, muffled voice, drooling, and fatigue. She had
been sick for the past 3 days and is unable to eat because of painful
swallowing. The parents deny any history of recurrent pharyngitis.
The patient still managed to open her mouth and you were able to see
an abscess at the upper pole of the right tonsil with deviation of the
uvula toward the midline. Examination of the neck reveals enlarged
and tender lymph nodes. Which of the following is the most appropriate management?
A. Analgesics for pain
B. Oral antibiotics
C. Nebulized racemic epinephrine
D. Incision and drainage of the abscess
E. Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy

ANSWERS
39.1

E. Bronchiolitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. There is no
established treatment for bronchiolitis except for supportive management of the patient’s symptoms. Because the infant did not
respond to an albuterol trial, there is no justification for continuing
its use. Antihistamines, decongestants, and antibiotics are not effective. Synagis is not helpful in the acute setting.

39.2

D. The incidence of epiglottitis has markedly reduced since the
introduction of the Hib vaccine. Children with epiglottitis are more
likely to be in the tripod position than prone. The “steeple sign” is
seen in croup; the “thumb” sign is seen in epiglottitis. Visualization
of the epiglottis should preferentially occur in an operating room,
where immediate intubation or tracheostomy can occur.

39.3

B. Epiglottitis is usually a bacterial infection treated with antibiotics.

39.4

D. This patient is suffering from peritonsillar abscess. Of the choices
listed, incision and drainage is the most appropriate. Tonsillectomy
is only indicated if there are confirmed cases of recurrent pharyngitis
and peritonsillar abscess.

416

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Clinical Pearls
➤ Sufficient airflow is required for the airway to produce a wheezing sound.
Disappearance of wheezing in a patient who initially presents with wheezing is an ominous sign that suggests complete blockage of the airway or
imminent respiratory failure.
➤ Bronchiolitis is the most common lower respiratory disease of infants
and the most common reason for hospitalization for infants younger than
1 year old.
➤ Never perform a blind finger sweep of a foreign object aspirated by an
infant or child.
➤ Epiglottitis is a medical emergency.

Case 40
A 28-year-old white woman presents to your office with a chief complaint of constipation and abdominal pain. On further questioning, she
reports she has had this problem since beginning college at the age of
18 years. Her symptoms have waxed and waned since this time, but never
have worsened. She describes her abdominal pain as dull, crampy, and
nonfocal but more prominent in the left lower quadrant, and sometimes
relieved with defecation. She denies radiation of pain, nausea, vomiting,
fever, chills, weight loss, heartburn, or bloody or dark stool. She reports
having a bowel movement every 1 to 2 days that is hard and feels incomplete. She has tried over-the-counter remedies, including stool softeners
and antacids, but only experienced minimal improvement in her symptoms. She only takes birth control pills and denies any use of herbs or
laxatives. Her family history is negative, including for colorectal cancer
and inflammatory bowel disease, and she reports that her parents and
siblings are healthy. She is currently engaged and reports significant
stress in preparing for the wedding. On physical examination, you note
her to be somewhat anxious, but otherwise in no apparent distress. Her
vital signs and a general physical examinations are normal. Her
abdomen has normal bowel sounds, no tenderness on superficial and
deep palpation, and no rebound, rigidity, or guarding. Liver and spleen
size are within normal limits and no masses are palpable. Pelvic examination is normal. Rectal examination shows normal sphincter tone, no
masses, and brown stool that is occult blood negative.

What is the next step in therapy? Trial of fiber supplementation.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Describe the epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathophysiology of
irritable bowel syndrome.
2. Learn the diagnostic approach to irritable bowel syndrome and rationale
for ordering diagnostic studies based on symptom subtype and/or presence
of “alarm features.”
3. Review current therapeutic strategies in the patient with irritable bowel
syndrome.
4. Recognize the role of psychosocial factors in irritable bowel syndrome.

Considerations
This is a young woman with long-standing abdominal pain and constipation.
She denies any “alarm features” like weight loss, bloody stools, fever, and
refractory diarrhea, and her family history is negative for colon cancer or
inflammatory bowel disease. The chronicity and lack of worsening of her symptoms coupled with her young age points to a functional GI disorder, such as
irritable bowel syndrome. The presence of fever, weight loss, or an abnormal
physical examination would be other worrisome findings. A reasonable workup
in this case should include stool for guaiac and a complete blood count.

419

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Suspected Irritable Bowel Syndrome
DEFINITIONS
IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS): This is a functional GI disorder

characterized by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits.
LUBIPROSTONE (AMITIZA): Pharmacologic agent that selectively activates intestinal chloride channels and increases fluid secretion is FDA
approved for IBS in women with constipation, but has a side effect of nausea
in significant percentage of patients.

CLINICAL APPROACH
The prevalence of IBS is approximately 10% to 15% of the US population
and accounts for a large proportion of GI complaints seen both by primary
care physicians and gastroenterologists. IBS affects women two to three
more times often than men and patients typically present in the second or
third decades of life, although virtually any age group can be affected. Despite
studies to elucidate the underlying physiologic abnormalities seen in IBS, the
pathophysiology of IBS remains unclear. Several studies show abnormal gut
hypersensitivity to visceral perception and pain, altered gastrointestinal
motility, and dysregulation of the brain–gut axis through increased reactivity
to stress. A high prevalence of psychopathology is seen in patients who are
eventually diagnosed with IBS. Although the association between psychological disturbances and IBS are complicated and not clearly defined, psychiatric
symptoms appear to predict illness behavior rather than directly cause IBS.
IBS also commonly coexists with other functional disorders such as fibromyalgia, lower back pain, and chronic headaches.
Patients with IBS complain of constipation, diarrhea, alternating constipation with diarrhea, and periods of normal bowel habits that alternate with
either constipation and/or diarrhea. The abdominal pain associated with IBS is
frequently in the lower part of the abdomen, with the left lower quadrant being
the most common location. However, both the location and the nature of the
pain in IBS are subject to great variability. The pain is described as a cramping
sensation of intermittent frequency and variable intensity, often improved or
relieved with defecation. Abdominal pain usually does not wake a person up
from sleep in IBS. However, severe cases of IBS may be accompanied by nighttime awakenings. Other gastrointestinal symptoms seen in IBS include the passage of mucus with stool, bowel urgency, bloating, and the sensation of
incomplete stool evacuation. Up to 50% of people with IBS also suffer from
upper GI symptoms such as dyspepsia, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux.

Table 40–1 ROME III DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA FOR IRRITABLE BOWEL
SYNDROME

Recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort at least 3 d/mo for the past 3 months, associated with two or more of the following:
• Improvement with defecation
• Onset associated with a change in the frequency of stool
• Onset associated with a change in form (appearance) of stool
Criteria must have been fulfilled for the past 3 months, with symptoms onset at least
6 months before diagnosis. On the basis of the predominant bowel habit, IBS has been
categorized into one of the following subgroups:
• IBS with diarrhea (more common in men)
• IBS with constipation (more common in women)
• IBS with mixed bowel habits
Each group accounts for about one-third of all patients.
Reproduced from Mayer EA. Clinical practice. Irritable bowel syndrome. N Engl J Med. 2008 Apr
17;358(16):1692-1699.

Diagnosis
In an effort to objectively diagnose a patient with IBS, the Rome Criteria
(Table 40–1) were developed and subsequently revised. Based on the presence
of positive symptoms and the absence of structural or biochemical explanation of the symptoms, a patient may be diagnosed with IBS. Physicians are
encouraged to avoid unnecessary and expensive studies and instead to use
judicious cost-effective diagnostic testing.
A thorough history should be obtained using open-ended, nonjudgmental
questions. The physical examination should focus on ruling out organic pathologic processes that are inconsistent with IBS. Importance should be paid to all
medications and dietary habits that may worsen or mimic the symptoms of IBS.
The differential diagnosis of IBS can be very broad. Patients should be
asked for the presence of “alarm features,” (Table 40–2) which include fever,
anemia, involuntary weight loss greater than 10 lb, hematochezia, melena,
refractory or bloody diarrhea, and a family history of colon cancer or inflammatory bowel disease. The presence of alarm features usually points to an
underlying organic etiology, such as inflammatory bowel disease or colon
cancer, and may warrant further workup, including laboratory, endoscopic,
and/or radiographic testing.
In the patient with typical features of IBS and the absence of alarm features, a complete blood count and stool Hemoccult are appropriate initial
screening tests. Because of the high pretest probability of neoplasm in patients
age 50 years or older, a colonoscopy is recommended in addition to any other

diagnostic workup in this age group. A sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy can be
performed on the younger patient if inflammatory bowel disease is suspected,
or if the patient has additional alarm features, such as refractory diarrhea or
unintentional weight loss.

Treatment
Based on the predominant symptom subtype, empiric therapy can be initiated
to control a patient’s symptoms. For abdominal pain, the use of antispasmodics, such as dicyclomine and hyoscyamine, may be used on an as-needed basis,
especially when pain is mild and infrequent. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) should be considered when pain is more frequent and severe.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be beneficial when
depression or anxiety disorders are comorbid with IBS.
For constipation-predominant IBS, increasing fiber intake, either via
dietary fiber, synthetic fiber, or natural fiber, is recommended. For diarrheapredominant IBS, loperamide may reduce the frequency of loose stools, as
well as decrease bowel urgency.
Tegasorad (Zelnorm) and Alosetron (Lotronex), which act at the serotonin (5-HT) receptor, have been shown to help with the pain associated
with IBS. However, due to an increased incidence of ischemic cardiovascular
events and ischemic colitis, tegaserod has been withdrawn from the US market and alosetron has restricted access. Lubiprostone (Amitiza), which selectively activates intestinal chloride channels and increases fluid secretion is
FDA approved for IBS in women with constipation, but has a side effect of
nausea in significant percentage of patients.
Pharmacologic agents should be used as adjuncts in the overall treatment
plan. A multifactorial approach, including modification of diet and lifestyle,
providing patient education and reassurance, and medication therapy is often

422

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

required. For patients with significant psychosocial issues, psychotherapy, stress
management, and treatment of underlying psychiatric disorders appear to be
helpful in overall symptom management. Cognitive behavioral therapy has
shown to be especially helpful. As always, a therapeutic physician–patient relationship is critical to maximizing the best clinical outcome. It is important that
the physician not appear dismissive of the patient’s complaints and communicate to the patient that the symptoms are real and not just in his or her head.

40.4

A 26-year-old college student has been increasingly stressed before
final examinations. She has been using over-the-counter antacids
more days out of the week than not for an upset stomach and feeling
full immediately after eating. She typically has one bowel movement
per week and there is no blood in the stool. She feels immediate relief
after passage of stool and flatulence. For the patient with constipationpredominant IBS, which of the following is the best first-line therapy?
A. Hyoscyamine
B. Sertraline
C. Psyllium
D. Loperamide

40.5

A 25-year-old woman comes to your office worried that she might
have IBS, which she heard about on the news. She reports abdominal
pain and diarrhea for 3 months. She also reports observing blood in
her stool several times. She is worried what impact her constantly having to use the bathroom is having on her job as a lawyer. Her physical
examination is normal except for a hemoccult-positive test after a rectal
examination. While looking over her records you notice that she has
lost 20 lb since she last saw you 3 months ago. Which of the following
is an appropriate next step?
A. Refer her for cognitive behavioral therapy.
B. Offer her symptomatic relief with loperamide.
C. Recommend that she take fiber for better bowel regulation.
D. Obtain colonoscopy.

ANSWERS
40.1

D. Age-appropriate cancer screening (colonoscopy) is indicated,
even in the setting of an established diagnosis of IBS, because of the
high pretest probability of detecting an underlying neoplasm.

40.2

C. Dicyclomine, an antispasmodic anticholinergic medication, can
be used on an as-needed basis for mild-to-moderate abdominal pain
associated with IBS. For more persistent and severe pain, low-dose
TCAs, like amitriptyline, are beneficial. Lubiprostone is indicated in
women with constipation-predominant IBS as a second-line agent.

40.3

B. Comorbid psychiatric disorders typically worsen IBS symptomatology, but have not been shown to cause IBS directly. Successfully
treating an underlying psychiatric disorder may improve symptoms of
IBS, but will not likely resolve all symptoms of IBS.

40.4

C. Fiber supplementation is considered first-line therapy in
constipation-predominant IBS. It is effective and safe, and available
without prescription.

424
40.5

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

D. This patient presents with alarm signs of blood in the stool and
weight loss. Although psychiatric problems or irritable bowel syndrome are possible, more serious conditions should be evaluated and
ruled out. A CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and colonoscopy
or radiological study assessing for inflammatory bowel disease would
be prudent.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The pathophysiology of IBS is not clearly elucidated. However, altered gut
motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and dysregulation of the brain gut axis,
coupled with psychosocial factors, appear to influence IBS symptoms in
varying degrees.
➤ The symptom complex of altered bowel habits and chronic abdominal
pain is the hallmark of IBS. Symptoms typically begin early in life, wax and
wane, and occur in the absence of any organic cause.
➤ Alarm features may indicate an underlying organic pathology and require
additional diagnostic workup that may include laboratory, radiologic,
and/or endoscopic studies.
➤ Treatment should be symptom-specific and should include appropriate
use of medication, dietary and lifestyle changes, and examination of any
psychosocial factors that contribute to IBS symptoms.

This is a 30-year-old woman who has admitted to drinking more alcohol since
being divorced from her husband. She has some of the findings of alcohol
abuse such as hypertension, elevated liver enzymes, and depression. She also
reports some jitteriness which likely indicates tremors with alcohol withdrawal. Other drug or medication use should be assessed. Psychiatric disorders,
such as depression or bipolar disorder, should also be in the differential diagnosis. Once alcohol dependence is suspected, then a detoxification process is
critical to the patient being successfully treated.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Suspected Alcohol Dependence
DEFINITION
ALCOHOL ABUSE: Harmful use of alcohol which can be either physical or

mental harm. Alcohol abusers drink despite recurrent social, interpersonal,
and legal problems as a result of alcohol use.
ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE: Mental and physical need to consume alcohol
in order to prevent the pains of withdrawal and obtain certain results, and
associated with increasing consumption to obtain same effect (tolerance).

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiologic studies have shown that alcohol use disorders are among the
most prevalent of medical, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders in the general
population. There is a documented prevalence of alcohol abuse and dependence estimated to be between 7% and 10% in the United States. Despite
higher thresholds and tolerance, in general, men are at least twice as likely to
meet criteria for alcohol abuse and dependence.
In patients reporting depressive symptoms, it is important to assess for current substance abuse, particularly alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine. If
used in excess, these substances and their associated withdrawal syndromes
can result in depression. Whether determined to be substance-induced or not,
the depressive symptoms should be taken seriously. An assessment for suicidality (current and past) and current sources of family/social support should
be conducted. The potential for significant alcohol withdrawal should also be
assessed. If depressive symptoms persist longer than 4 weeks after discontinuation of alcohol, consider other potential causes of depression.

ASSESSMENT
Alcohol Screening
Brief screening instruments have been developed in order to identify potential alcohol abuse or dependence.
The most commonly used instrument is the CAGE. The CAGE was designed
for rapid verbal screening for alcohol abuse and dependence in clinical practice.
CAGE is a mnemonic representing the following four items:
• Have you ever felt you should cut down on your drinking?
• Have people annoyed you about your drinking?

428

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

• Have you ever felt bad or guilty about your drinking?
• Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning to steady your nerves

or get rid of a hangover (eye-opener)?
A positive response to two or more of the above questions is considered a
positive screen. Systematic reviews of this screening test show a sensitivity of
65% to 69% and specificity of 92% to 93%. The effectiveness of the CAGE
instrument varies with gender, ethnicity, age, and other differences. It is less
effective in detecting binge drinking.
The AUDIT-C (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test) was better at
detecting at-risk, hazardous, or harmful drinking. A score of 3 or greater was
considered a positive screen.
• “How often do you have a drink containing alcohol?”—0 points for never,

1 point for monthly or less, 2 points for 2 to 4 times/month, 3 points for 2 to
3 times/week, 4 points for 4 days/week or more.
• “How many drinks containing alcohol do you have on a typical day when
you are drinking?”—0 points for not drinking, 1 point for 1 to 4 drinks,
2 points for 5 to 6 drinks, 3 points for 7 to 9 drinks, 4 points for 10 or more
drinks.
• “How often do you have 6 or more drinks on one occasion?”—0 points for
never, 1 point for less than monthly, 2 points for monthly, 3 points for
weekly, 4 points for daily or almost daily.

Alcohol Dependence versus Abuse
A diagnosis of alcohol dependence is defined by DSM-IV TR (Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision) when the
patient exhibits a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to significant
impairment or distress and three or more of the following within 12 months
• Need for markedly increased amounts of alcohol to achieve intoxication or

desired effect, or markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same
amount of alcohol
Alcohol withdrawal syndrome, or use of substances to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms
Persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control drinking
Drinking more than intended
Giving up or reducing activities due to drinking
Considerable time spent in activities to obtain alcohol, drink, or recover
from alcohol effects
Continued drinking despite knowledge of having persistent or recurrent
physical or psychological problems exacerbated by alcohol use
Considered physical dependence (in addition to psychological dependence)
if evidence of tolerance or withdrawal

CLINICAL CASES

429

A diagnosis of alcohol abuse is defined by DSM-IV TR when the patient
exhibits a maladaptive pattern of alcohol use leading to significant impairment or distress, does not meet the criteria for alcohol dependence, but does
exhibit one or more of the following within 12 months:
•
•
•
•

Recurrent drinking resulting in failure to fulfill major role obligations
Recurrent drinking in situations in which it is physically hazardous
Recurrent alcohol-related legal problems
Continued alcohol use despite persistent or recurrent social or interpersonal
problems caused or exacerbation by alcohol

At-Risk Drinking
Patients may not meet DSM-IV criteria for alcohol abuse or dependence, but
may still be considered “at-risk” for problems related to alcohol, particularly
health-related problems. The National Institute on Alcoholism and Alcohol
Abuse (NIAAA) defines moderate drinking as follows:
• Men: less than or equal to two drinks per day
• Women: less than or equal to 1 drink per day
• Over 65 years: less than one drink per day

The NIAAA defines at-risk drinking as:
• Men: more than 14 drinks per week or more than 4 drinks per occasion
• Women: more than seven drinks per week or more than three drinks per

occasion
Binge drinking, which is more common in young adults, is defined by NIAAA as:
“A pattern of drinking that brings blood alcohol content to 0.08% in the past
month. This typically represents more than or equal to 5 drinks for a male or
more than or equal to 4 drinks for a female in approximately 2 hours.”

Standard Drink Measurement
A standard drink represents 14 g of pure alcohol, typically one (12 oz) beer,
one (5 oz) glass of wine, or one shot (1.5 oz) of spirits (eg, whiskey, gin,
vodka). When assessing for at-risk drinking, it is important to clarify the number of standard drinks a patient is consuming in a day or week. For example,
a patient may report he drinks only two beers each day, but the beers to which
he is referring may be large, 48-oz cans, equaling four standard drinks each.

Substance-Induced Depression versus Primary Depression
A substance-induced mood disorder is distinguished from a primary mood
disorder typically by considering the onset and course of the two disorders.
Depression only arising in association with alcohol intoxication or withdrawal

430

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

states is likely to be substance induced. If depressive episodes are reported
prior to substance use or occur during times of sustained abstinence or are substantially in excess of what would be expected given the type or amount of the
substance used or the duration of use, then the mood disorder is likely to be
primary. Withdrawal states can be relatively protracted and substance-induced
mood symptoms may be evident up to 4 weeks after the cessation of substance
use. The importance of this distinction lies in the chosen treatment plan.
Antidepressant medication is likely to be ineffective, if not harmful, to a
patient with a significant alcohol (or other substance) problem. Referral to
substance abuse treatment should be the first choice of treatment in such
cases, with follow-up for reassessment of depressive symptoms, about 1 month
postabstinence.

Alcohol Withdrawal
Alcohol withdrawal may not be immediately obvious if a patient has ingested
alcohol in the past 12 hours. Signs and symptoms to notice or assess for
include tremulousness (“shake” or “jitters,” which can occur within 6 hours of
abstinence), insomnia, anxiety, depressed mood, gastrointestinal upset, heart
palpitations, and sweating. More severe symptoms associated with a long history of chronic alcoholism include generalized tonic-clonic seizures (within
6-48 hours), hallucinations (within 12-48 hours; typically visual but can be
auditory or tactile), and delirium tremens (DTs; within 48-72 hours), which
is characterized by hallucinations, agitation, tremor, sleeplessness, and sympathetic hyperactivity. DTs only occur in approximately 5% of patients with
withdrawal symptoms, but this is a serious condition with in-hospital mortality of 5% to 10%, usually from arrhythmias or infections. Benzodiazepines or
phenobarbital are the drugs of choice for managing alcohol withdrawal.

INTERVENTION
Brief, Office-Based Intervention for Alcohol Abuse and
Dependence
Research indicates that a brief 5 to 10 minute discussion between physician
and patient can lead to significant reductions in risky and hazardous drinking. The Brief Negotiation Interview is a brief intervention for substance
abuse that can be conducted in fewer than 10 minutes and is ideally suited for
use in busy clinical settings. The main point to keep in mind is that this
approach is nonconfrontational, nonjudgmental, and proceeds based on how
ready the client is to make any changes with regard to alcohol use. Rather
than lecturing and reprimanding, a physician can initiate a discussion about
the patient’s drinking and provide feedback so as to increase a patient’s own

CLINICAL CASES

431

internal motivation and help resolve ambivalence about changing. There are
five components to this intervention:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Establish rapport.
Ask permission to discuss alcohol use.
Provide feedback.
Assess readiness.
Enhance motivation, negotiate, and advise.

Establishing rapport and asking permission to discuss alcohol use (“I have
some concerns about your alcohol use and I’m wondering if we can discuss this
today.”) will reduce patient resistance. Information or feedback about the
patient’s current drinking level, associated risks to one’s health, and recommended drinking levels should be provided. Many patients are unaware of the
healthy drinking limits established by the NIAAA. In the current case, it
would also be important to express empathy with the stressors the patient is
facing, and to note that some people use alcohol to cope, and this can lead to
alcohol-induced depression.
The next step is to ask patients to rate how ready they are to reduce their
drinking to below-risk levels, or to quit drinking entirely (which is recommended
for people diagnosed with alcohol dependence). Ask patients to rate how ready
they are to reduce or quit using alcohol on a scale from 1 to 10, where 1 is “not
at all ready” and 10 is “completely ready and wants help making a plan.”
For patients who are not currently motivated to change their alcohol use,
make sure their viewpoint is acknowledged, using statements such as, “it sounds
like you are not quite ready to change right now.” Questions like, “what might
have to happen for you to decide to work on changing,” are also appropriate and
will prompt further thinking about the issue. Another effective strategy is to ask
clients who rate their readiness in the low range, “Why did you rate yourself a
3 (or 4 or 2) and not a 1?” This question usually elicits “change talk,” or causes
the patient to talk about why change would be beneficial. After a brief discussion, offer a phone number or brochure for available treatment options, and
explain that if they do decide to seek help, services are available.
For patients who are ready to make changes, ask whether they can make a
commitment to a goal, what that goal is, and what they can use to help them
achieve this goal. Things to consider include social support (eg, church) or
treatment options including free community support groups (eg, 12-step
meetings), psychotherapy, and medication management. Writing down the
plan to which they agree and asking them to sign it is a final tool that can
help solidify their commitment to making the change. It is important to assess
the risk of withdrawal symptoms based on quantity and chronicity of alcohol
use and make appropriate arrangements for supervised, medically assisted
detoxification, when appropriate.
In summary, it is important to clearly convey, in a nonjudgmental manner,
the levels at which drinking is risky, concern about the impact of a patient’s

432

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

alcohol use, and to provide a recommendation to reduce drinking. For
patients with a substance-induced mood or anxiety disorder, physicians
should suggest that stopping or reducing alcohol use may reduce or eliminate
problematic psychological symptoms (eg, depression). Offering referrals for
psychotherapy, 12-step meetings, or alcohol detoxification/treatment programs is a final and critical component of care.

C. Referral of diagnosed alcoholic to Alcoholics Anonymous
D. Limiting alcohol sales on Sunday

CLINICAL CASES

433

41.3

A 65-year-old man states that he drinks about 16 oz of beer each evening
with a friend after work. His wife is telling him he drinks too much. She
does not drink at all. He does not think this is much because he used to
consume at least a six-pack each day on the weekend watching football
when he was in his thirties. He has never had a DWI (driving while
intoxicated) or an amnesic episode after drinking. Approximately how
many standard drinks does this amount of beer equal and which of the
following category of drinker would you classify him as?
A. 1.3; moderate drinker
B. 1.3; at-risk drinker
C. 1.5; social drinker
D. 1.5; alcohol dependent

41.4

A 45-year-old man presents for his annual physical examination. On
his last physical he was found to have total cholesterol of 250 mg/dL,
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 165, and high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) of 32. After a trial of diet and exercise that did not improve his
lipid levels, he was placed on simvastatin. Today he reports no changes
in bowel or bladder habits and no myalgias. He is found to have elevated
blood pressure and a slight hand tremor. His father developed Parkinson
disease at age 67. He admits that he drinks heavily, but has no interest in
changing his behavior. He feels badly at times, but states that in the past
he has tried to reduce his alcohol consumption without effect. Which of
the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. Administer the CAGE questionnaire.
B. Refer the patient to Alcoholics Anonymous.
C. Postpone discussion of alcohol cessation until patient expresses
willingness to modify his behavior.
D. Recommend that the patient decrease his drinking after assessing
his readiness to change.
E. Tell the patient about the risks of heavy drinking, including alcohol related peripheral neuropathies.

ANSWERS
41.1

B. Alcoholic liver disease. The pattern of liver enzymes is consistent
with the whole body effects of chronic heavy alcohol ingestion. ALT
is elevated greater than AST in conditions that are more specific to
the liver. Hematologic change is indicative of marrow toxicity that
is seen in alcohol abuse. The elevated prothrombin time and low
albumin indicate significant impairment of liver protein production.

41.2

B. Breath alcohol testing of regulated truck drivers is an example of
secondary prevention of alcoholism. Raising the drinking age and
limiting sales are examples of primary prevention. Referral of a diagnosed alcoholic to Alcoholics Anonymous is a tertiary prevention.

434

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

41.3

B. One 16 oz beer equals 1.3 standard drinks (one 12 oz beer = 1
standard drink). NIAAA defines moderate drinking in males over 65
and women as less than or equal to one drink per day.

41.4

D. With patients who are not motivated to change, arguing or insisting they change is unlikely to be effective. Their opinions and
choices should be acknowledged, followed by a brief discussion of the
patient’s drinking and potential consequences, a recommendation to
cut down or stop, and a referral.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Alcohol and other drug abuse can significantly impact both physical and
mental health.
➤ Assess whether the onset of depression or other mental health/behavioral
problems preceded or followed significant alcohol or other drug abuse or
dependence, to determine the primary problem and associated treatment.
➤ Alcohol dependence is characterized by tolerance, withdrawal, drinking
larger amounts or for longer periods over time, desire or unsuccessful
efforts to control use, much time spent drinking, reduction in other life
activities, and continued use despite drinking-related physical and
psychological problems.
➤ Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be life threatening. Supervised,medically
assisted detoxification may be necessary for long-term, chronic alcoholism.
➤ Brief, physician-delivered alcohol interventions are effective for reducing
problematic drinking.
➤ “Finger wagging,” scolding, or lecturing patients tends to engender resistance to change; a physician’s advice can have a much more powerful effect
if delivered in a nonjudgmental, nonconfrontational manner.

Case 42
A 35-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of skipped or
“irregular beats” for the past few weeks. She paid little attention to her
symptoms because she had been under job-related stress and she thought
these symptoms would disappear. Instead, her occasional skipped beats
increased in frequency to twice a day, lasting up to 2 minutes. Her
father, who suffered from heart disease, urged her to see a doctor. There
had been no chest pain, shortness of breath, or dizziness. She consumes
about two cups of coffee a day. She recently tried some diet pills to lose
weight but stopped this medicine when her symptoms became more frequent. On examination, she is of average build. Her blood pressure is
130/85 mm Hg, her heart rate is 92 bpm, and her temperature is 98.6°F
(37°C). Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat (HEENT) examination is
normal. No conjunctival pallor noted. Neck examination is supple. No
jugular venous distension. Thyroid gland is normal size without nodules
and is nontender. There are no associated thyroid bruits. Lung examination is normal. Cardiac examination reveals regular rate and rhythm
with normal S1 and S2. No midsystolic click is heard. Abdominal and
extremity examinations are normal. Neurologic examination reveals no
resting tremor. Reflexes are normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 42:
Palpitations
Summary: A 35-year-old woman presents to your office with a few weeks
worth of palpitations that have increased in frequency. Her symptoms are not
associated with chest pain, syncope, dyspnea, or dizziness. She has no pertinent past medical history. She has the potential triggers of caffeine consumption, diet pill use, and stress. Family history of heart disease also noted. Her
examination is normal.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Cardiac dysrhythmia, benign.

➤

Next diagnostic step: Obtain 12-lead ECG.

➤

Next step in therapy: Restrict caffeine, alcohol, and drugs (especially
amphetamine-based stimulants and diuretics) for next 2 weeks; keep a diary
of symptoms or possible triggers; follow-up with patient in 2 weeks. If symptoms persist, additional workup may be required.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Define palpitations.
2. Identify benign rhythm disturbances and those associated with sudden cardiac death.
3. Identify the most common structural heart diseases associated with sudden
cardiac death.
4. Develop a rational approach that takes into account cardiac and noncardiac causes for palpitations.

Considerations
This 35-year-old woman gives a history of frequent palpitations and otherwise
appears healthy (normal physical examination) without associated dizziness
or syncope. Because she is also younger than the age of 50 years (thus at low
risk for coronary artery disease), she is most likely to have a nonthreatening
cause for her symptoms and can be workedup on an outpatient basis.
This history is the most important part of the workup. We are given clues
to noncardiac factors that may contribute to palpitations, including caffeine
consumption, use of diet pills, job-related stress, and possibly stress surrounding her father’s own health problems. Anemia should be considered if there is
a history of fatigue, light-headedness, GI blood loss, or menorrhagia.

CLINICAL CASES

439

Family history can be very important because some dysrhythmias, such as
familial prolonged QT syndrome, can run in families. A family history of premature cardiac death (or unexplained sudden death) should be sought, as
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is autosomal dominant and may not demonstrate a heart murmur when examined.
If this woman were to have a midsystolic click associated with or without a
late systolic murmur, we would need to consider the presence of mitral valve
prolapse (MVP) syndrome. Usually asymptomatic, it is the most common
valvular heart defect in the United States, occurring in 3% to 6% of the population. Because MVP is common, the presence of palpitations may or may not
be the result of this condition. Still, people may present with palpitations,
fatigue, chest discomfort (not typical of angina), and dyspnea with this valvular finding. This symptom complex is defined as mitral valve prolapse syndrome. These patients may also present with panic attacks or manic-depressive
syndromes. Two percent of MVP patients will have complications resulting in
progression to mitral regurgitation with subsequent left-sided two-chamber
enlargement, atrial fibrillation (if left atrium becomes enlarged), left ventricular dysfunction leading to heart failure, pulmonary hypertension, and infective
endocarditis. For these reasons, a two-dimensional echocardiogram is recommended at least once when MVP is identified.

APPROACH TO
Palpitations
DEFINITION
PALPITATIONS: A subjective sensation of unduly strong, slow, rapid, or irreg-

ular heart beats that may be related to cardiac arrhythmias. The sensation may
last seconds, minutes, hours, or days. They are common and usually not dangerous. They usually are the result of a change in the heart’s electrical system.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies
Approximately 40% of patients complaining of palpitations have a primary
rhythm disturbance. An underlying mental health problem (anxiety or panic
disorder) is the cause in 31% of symptomatic patients. Drugs (prescription,
recreational, or over-the-counter) cause 6% of palpitations; intrinsic structural problems with the heart are the cause of 3%; 4% have noncardiac causes;
and the remaining 16% have no identifiable cause.

440

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The largest group has some type of primary rhythm disorder, including
sinus bradycardia, sinus tachycardia, Wolf-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, sick sinus syndrome, premature atrial contractions, supraventricular
tachycardias, premature ventricular contractions, and ventricular tachycardia. These rhythm disturbances can be seen in childhood and adulthood.
Supraventricular tachycardia is caused by a cardiac source of the arrhythmia that is not in the ventricle. This category includes atrial fibrillation, atrial
flutter, focal atrial tachycardia, multifocal atrial tachycardia (MAT), and AV
nodal reentrant tachycardia. Atrial fibrillation is the most common of all the
arrhythmias and becomes increasingly more common with older age and cardiomyopathy. MAT is classically found in the presence of COPD.
WPW syndrome is caused by an accessory track between the atria and ventricles that conducts electrical impulses in addition to the AV node. The classic ECG finding is a slurring on the upstroke of the QRS complex known as a
delta wave. WPW can cause dangerous arrhythmias and lead to sudden cardiac death. Brugada syndrome is an ion channel disorder that is most common
in Asian males. On an ECG, it presents as ST-segment elevation in leads V1
to V3, and it too can cause dangerous arrhythmias that result in death.
Sick sinus syndrome usually involves a dysfunction of the SA node that
leads to bradycardia and can cause fatigue and syncope. Patients, however,
can also have a tachycardia-bradycardia variety of sick sinus syndrome in
which they also experience supraventricular tachycardia with its associated
symptoms of palpitations and angina pectoris.
Patients with long QT interval syndrome are at increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death (SCD). Long QT syndrome is
caused by mutations in multiple genes and can have an autosomal dominant
pattern. It is seen more commonly in females. Patients with this syndrome
will present with either palpitations and/or syncope and have a family history of syncope or sudden death. Prolonged QT interval is defined as QTC*
470 msec in men or greater than 480 msec in women. Any patient with a QT
interval greater than 500 msec is at increased risk for dangerous dysrhythmias. Prolonged QT intervals may also be the result of the use of certain medications such as quinidine, procainamide, sotalol, amiodarone, and tricyclic
antidepressants.
Benign rhythm disturbances include premature atrial contractions, sinus
tachycardia, and sinus bradycardia appropriate for activity/stress level, sinus
pauses less than 3 seconds and isolated unifocal premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). However, PVCs in the presence of known cardiac disease,

*

QTC is defined as measured QT interval corrected for heart rate:
QT(in msec)
QTC =
RR interval (in msec)

CLINICAL CASES

441

metabolic disease, or the presence of worrisome symptoms (such as near syncope, syncope, or seizures) require aggressive workup because of the risk of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. PVCs occurring at rest and disappearing
with exercise are usually benign, commonly seen in athletes, and require no
investigation.
Psychiatric causes are always considered in the differential diagnosis for
palpitations and may be missed if not screened for in the initial history. Panic
disorder is seen more often in women of childbearing age. Patients with panic
attacks commonly present to emergency departments. They will report brief
episodes of overwhelming panic or sense of impending doom associated with
tachycardia, dyspnea, or dizziness. Still, these complaints may be identical to
primary rhythm disturbances and deserve formal workup.
Cardiac or structural problems include cardiomyopathy, atrial or ventricular septal defects, congenital heart disease, mitral valve prolapse, pericarditis,
valvular heart disease (eg, aortic stenosis, aortic insufficiency), and congestive
heart failure. The presence of restrictive, hypertrophic, or dilated cardiomyopathies may lead to sudden cardiac death.
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden cardiac
death in adolescents in the United States. These patients may present with chest
pain, syncope, and palpitations. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may be passed
down as an autosomal dominant trait. A heart murmur, if present, will usually be
systolic and will be accentuated by Valsalva maneuver. Echocardiography
demonstrating a thickened intraventricular septum remains the gold standard for
diagnosis.
Marfan syndrome should be suspected in patients who are tall and have
scoliosis, pectus excavatum, long, thin digits (arachnodactyly), high-arched
palate, and an arm span exceeding their height. Mitral valve prolapse may be
seen in patients with Marfan syndrome. These patients often have aortic root
dilations and are at risk for aortic arch aneurysm rupture. The diagnosis can
be confirmed by echocardiography.
Noncardiac causes of palpitations may be suggested by the history and examination. Noncardiac etiologies include anemia, electrolyte disturbances, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, fever, pheochromocytoma,
pulmonary disease, and vasovagal syncope. Laboratory screening includes a complete blood (CBC), chemistry panel, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
If a pheochromocytoma is suspected, a 24-hour urine collection for catecholamines and metanephrines is required.
Numerous medications and substances may contribute to palpitations. Among
these are alcohol, caffeine, street drugs (cocaine), tobacco, decongestants (often
found in OTC and herbal weight loss drugs), diuretics (causing electrolyte disturbances), digoxin, β-agonists (eg, albuterol), theophylline, and phenothiazine.
Patients should be questioned about their use of over-the-counter medications,
herbs, and supplements, as they often will not provide this information unless
specifically asked.

442

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLINICAL PRESENTATION
Evaluation of a patient presenting with palpitations should take into account
numerous factors. The patient’s age at symptom onset is important, as an age
older than 50 years should always lead to the consideration of coronary
artery disease. Possible triggers should be pursued, such as medication use, exercise, and stress. Pay particular attention to palpitations associated with syncope,
as these are usually pathologic and hospitalization should be considered.
The clinical examination should focus on vital signs (blood pressure and
heart rate), including orthostatic readings if suggested by history. The thyroid
gland should be examined for abnormalities such as goiter, nodule, or bruit.
The presence of resting tremor or brisk reflexes should also lead one to consider hyperthyroidism.
The cardiac examination should be thorough. The point of maximum
impulse should be palpated, as displacement may suggest cardiomegaly. The
rate and rhythm should be noted, particularly if there are any irregularities.
For example, an irregularly irregular rhythm is suggestive of atrial fibrillation
whereas an occasional extra beat may be PVCs. Extra sounds, such as the
midsystolic click of mitral valve prolapse or any murmurs consistent with
valvular pathology, should also be documented.
A 12-lead electrocardiogram is appropriate in all patients with palpitations, even if they are symptom free during physician encounter. The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial enlargement, atrioventricular
block, old myocardial infarction, and delta waves (as seen in WPW syndrome) should trigger additional testing. Prolonged QT intervals increase the
risk for dangerous rhythm disturbances and usually require consultation with
a cardiologist or cardiac electrophysiologist.
Other cardiac testing may be appropriate based on the history, examination,
and results of the initial evaluation. Ambulatory electrocardiographic rhythm
monitoring can be accomplished for periods of 24 to 72 hours using a Holter
monitor. A cardiac event monitor can be worn by a patient for up to 30 days
and might be useful when the palpitations do not occur daily. The monitor is
worn continuously and activated by the patient when palpitations are felt.
An echocardiogram might be useful in identifying patients with suspected
structural abnormalities of their heart chambers or heart valves, which could
trigger heart rhythm disturbances. These findings could be missed on physical
examination. A transesophageal echocardiogram may be performed to look
for a thrombus prior to cardioversion. Exercise stress tests in age-appropriate
patients may be important for identifying dysrhythmias triggered by exercise.
This may be of particular importance in patients with suspected coronary
artery disease. Anyone with suspected structural problems should be evaluated
by an echocardiogram before undergoing exercise. Patients with suspected
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or severe aortic stenosis should avoid exercise
stress testing, as they may develop heart rhythm disturbances which may be

CLINICAL CASES

443

nonrecoverable. Finally, electrophysiology studies may be needed to recreate
rhythm disturbances and identify hyperactive foci and accessory tracts such
seen in WPW syndrome. These areas can subsequently be electrically ablated.

TREATMENT
The treatment of a given patient’s symptoms is dependent on the etiology. If
medication related, the offending agent should be stopped. Anxiety may be
treated by a combination of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions. If the problem is structural cardiac disease, referral to a cardiologist is usually indicated.
Primary supraventricular rhythm disturbances may respond nicely to β-blockers
or calcium channel blockers. Digoxin can be used to slow down rapid ventricular responses to atrial fibrillation and flutter. If symptoms are short-lived
or episodic, short-acting negative chronotropics, such as short-acting β-blockers,
can be used on an as-needed basis.
Symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) can often be self-treated
by patients with recurrent episodes by several vagal stimulation techniques.
Carotid sinus massage, Valsalva maneuver, and cold applications to the face
(diver’s reflex) can trigger vagus nerve stimulation, which may break an episode
of SVT. When these are unsuccessful, IV adenosine is often administered. If
the adenosine terminates the SVT, then the arrhythmia is most likely a reentry SVT. If it does not, then the rate may be slowed down with β-blockers or
calcium channel blockers. At that point, consultation with a cardiologist should
be sought.
Chronic atrial fibrillation should be treated with medication to keep the
ventricular rate below 100 bpm; these agents are often β-blockers or calcium
channel blockers. Most patients with atrial fibrillation will also require anticoagulation with warfarin, as they are at an increased risk of embolic stroke
from blood clots that form in the cardiac atrium. Both electrical and pharmacologic cardioversion of atrial fibrillation may be attempted in order to convert to a normal sinus rhythm. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)
should be done prior to cardioversion in order to rule out the presence of a
thrombus that might dislodge with the cardioversion. If the patient converts
spontaneously or with cardioversion, normal sinus rhythm may then be sustained by antiarrhythmic drugs, such as amiodarone, sotalol or with class 1C
drugs such as flecainide and propafenone. Class 1C drugs should not be used
in the presence of structural cardiac disease or cardiac hypertrophy.
Ventricular arrhythmias can be extremely dangerous and usually require
prompt treatment. Ventricular fibrillation is not compatible with life and needs
to be treated immediately with electrical defibrillation. Patients with ventricular
tachycardia, who are unstable, need to be electrically cardioverted. Amiodarone
should be given to a patient with stable ventricular tachycardia and in patients
who were converted back into a sinus rhythm through cardioversion. Lidocaine

444

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

should be used in place of amiodarone in patients who are allergic to iodine. The
most common cause of ventricular arrhythmias is ischemia.
An implanted cardioverter-defibrillator is indicated in patients with conditions that commonly result in ventricular fibrillation or tachycardia leading to
sudden death. Some of these conditions are advanced dilated cardiomyopathy,
long QT syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and Brugada syndrome.

an ECG which shows left ventricular hypertrophy. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?
A. An exercise stress test
B. An echocardiogram
C. A chest x-ray
D. A coronary catheterization
E. Reassurance that he is fit to play football

42.5

You are called to the bed side of a patient who was complaining of chest
pain. When you get there you find the patient confused and not
answering questions. The nurse informs you that the patient was speaking coherently only a moment before. The patient’s pulse is 180 bpm,
his systolic blood pressure is 60 mm Hg, and his diastolic cannot be
measured. He was admitted to the hospital for a condition completely
unrelated to chest pain. A rhythm strip shows ventricular tachycardia.
Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?
A. Adenosine
B. Cardiology Consultation
C. Emergent electrical cardioversion
D. Negative chronotropic agent
E. 12-lead ECG

ANSWERS
42.1

D. Primary rhythm disturbances are the most common cause of palpitations, making up approximately 40% of cases. Other common
causes include anxiety, medications, and structural heart disease.
Many cases of palpitations remain undiagnosed in spite of appropriate evaluation.

42.2

B. The presence of delta waves indicates WPW syndrome and the
presence of an accessory tract that can be ablated by an electrophysiologist.

42.3

A. A 60-year-old with PVCs, especially if they are of new onset, may
be showing the initial presentation of coronary artery disease and
should undergo stress testing. All of the other conditions listed are
contraindications to stress testing.

446

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

42.4

B. This young man has signs suggestive of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The confirmatory test for it is an echocardiogram. Coronary
catheterization and stress testing are tests for coronary artery disease
and not recommended for this patient. A β-blocker or calcium channel blocker would worsen the patient’s hemodynamic status. Adenosine
is indicated for supraventricular tachycardia with a narrow QRS complex and not ventricular tachycardia.

42.5

C. This patient has ventricular tachycardia with clinical deterioration and hemodynamic instability. He needs immediate electrical
cardioversion.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Consider Marfan syndrome in a tall patient with long arms, long fingers,
who wears glasses.
➤ A 24- to 72-hour Holter monitor is appropriate in a patient with frequent
(ie, daily) palpitations; a 30-day event monitor is a better test in someone
with infrequent episodes.
➤ Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in adolescents. An adolescent with a systolic heart murmur that
increases in intensity with Valsalva maneuver should have his/her activity
restricted until a diagnostic echocardiogram can be performed.

Case 43
The mother of a 16-year-old girl calls you when you are on call on a
Saturday afternoon. The mother states that her daughter was stung by a
wasp about 2 hours ago on her left arm. The patient has no known history of previous allergic reactions to insect bites or stings. She is having
no difficulty breathing or swallowing, nor has she been dizzy or lightheaded. The mother’s primary concern is that the area of the sting is red
and swollen. The daughter says that it hurts and itches. She says that the
site of the injury was the midpoint of the forearm and there is now redness and swelling extending in a circular pattern that is about 3 in
across. The red area is hot to the touch, so the mother is concerned that
it is infected. She gave her daughter some ibuprofen for the pain and
would like you to phone in some antibiotic and something to prevent
the reaction from spreading.

ANSWERS TO CASE 43:
Sting and Bite Injuries
Summary: A 16-year-old adolescent female has been stung by a wasp and is
having a painful, itchy local reaction. She has no history of previous allergic
reactions. The patient’s mother is calling and asking you to manage the situation over the phone.
➤

Most appropriate antibiotic to use: No antibiotic treatment is indicated,
as this is a local reaction.

➤

Other therapy that may be beneficial: Local applications of ice, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or acetaminophen for pain, and
antihistamine for itching.

➤

Immunization that is appropriate: Tetanus-diphtheria booster, if not up to
date.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the insects that commonly cause bite and sting injuries.
2. Be able to differentiate local from systemic reactions to bites and stings.
3. Know the management of common animal-bite injuries.

Considerations
This adolescent without allergies has received a wasp sting, and no other therapy is needed other than symptomatic treatment. The insect order Hymenoptera
includes wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, honeybees, bumblebees, and fire ants.
These insects cause the majority of cases of sting- or bite-induced anaphylaxis
and cause more mortality than all other types of insect bites and stings. Local
reactions occur as a result of the toxic properties of the venom, whereas more
severe reactions tend to be caused by allergic reaction to venom allergens.
Several types of bee stings result in retention of the stinger in the victim,
which can result in continued injection of the bee venom. Stingers should be
promptly removed. Grasping the base of the stinger may result in compression
of a venom-containing sac, resulting in increased venom release. Thus it is
suggested that scraping or brushing the stinger off of the skin is preferable to
grasping the stinger. However, rapidly removing the stinger is preferable to
taking the time to locate a scraping implement if one (such as a credit card
or driver’s license) is not immediately at hand.

APPROACH TO
Bites and Stings
DEFINITIONS
HYMENOPTERA: Order of insects which includes wasps, yellow jackets, hornets, honeybees, bumblebees, and fire ants, and make up the majority of
insect stings.
LARGE LOCAL ALLERGIC REACTIONS: Redness or warmth of the skin at
the area of insect sting, mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig) E reactive to the
hymenoptera venom.

CLINICAL APPROACH
INSECT STINGS
Local Reactions
Almost all Hymenoptera stings will result in a local reaction, which includes
redness, swelling, pain, and itching at the site of the injury. These reactions
tend to occur almost immediately and last for a few hours. The local tissue
response is a consequence of a histamine-like reaction caused by the venom
that is released by the sting. Local reactions can be treated with ice and antihistamines for itching. Tetanus prophylaxis should be provided for those who
have not been vaccinated.

Delayed Reactions
Large local allergic reactions are mediated by immunoglobulin (Ig) E reactive to the hymenoptera venom. These reactions are often confused with cellulitis, as large areas (≥ 10 cm in diameter) of redness and warmth develop over
24 to 48 hours. These reactions are not infectious and will not respond to
antibiotics. These reactions are best treated with oral steroids initiated early
after the sting. Tetanus prophylaxis should be reviewed and updated, if needed.
A person with a history of a large local reaction to a bee sting is likely to have
similar reactions to subsequent stings. However, the history of this type of reaction does not result in an increased risk of anaphylaxis to subsequent stings.

Anaphylaxis
Up to 4% of the population may have a systemic reaction to a hymenoptera
sting. Those who have had a systemic reaction have a 50% or greater risk of

450

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

having a systemic reaction to future stings. These systemic reactions can vary
from milder symptoms of nausea, generalized urticaria, or angioedema to severe
and life-threatening hypotension, shock, and airway edema. Severe immediatehypersensitivity reactions usually occur within minutes of the sting.
Treatment of anaphylaxis should include assessment and management of
the ABCs (airway, breathing, and circulation), with intubation, if necessary,
IV access, and fluid resuscitation at 10 to 20 mg/kg (usually 500-1000 cc) as
soon as possible. Subcutaneous or intramuscular injection of 0.3 to 0.5 mL
of 1:1000 solution of epinephrine should be given as quickly as possible
and repeated in 10 to 15 minutes if needed. Antihistamines, steroids (if
severe), and bronchodilators may be required as well. Anyone with an anaphylactic reaction should be observed in a hospital setting for 12 to 24 hours,
as the symptoms can recur. Persons with known anaphylactic reactions should
be prescribed epinephrine injector kits to carry with them for immediate
access at all times. They should be instructed to avoid wearing perfumes,
bright clothing, and avoid walking barefoot. Desensitization therapy can also
be offered to those with known anaphylaxis, as their risk of future severe reactions can be reduced by up to 50%.

ANIMAL BITES
Nearly five million animal bites occur in the United States each year. The
most common animals involved are dogs, cats, and humans.
The initial management should focus, as always, on the ABCs and on protection of the current injury (splinting of fractures, protection of cervical
spine, etc), as well as control of bleeding and assessment of the injuries
incurred. History should be gathered on the type of animal involved in the
bite, the situation regarding the bite (whether provoked or unprovoked), and
the vaccination status of the animal, particularly to document rabies vaccination status. Almost all cases of human rabies in the United States since
1960 have been caused by bats, skunks, dogs, and foxes. Consultation with
your local health department after animal bites is recommended.
Local cleaning of the wound(s) with soap and water, irrigation with
saline, and debridement of devitalized tissue should take place as soon as
possible. Often, for minor wounds, these treatments are all that is needed.
The risk of infection is dependent on numerous factors. Larger and deeper
wounds are more likely to become infected than smaller, superficial wounds.
Hand wounds also tend to have an increased risk of infection. Host factors,
such as the presence of chronic illnesses or immune suppression, also play a
role. The animal involved in the bite is important. Approximately 20% of
dog-bite wounds become infected, whereas cat and human bites have a higher
occurrence of infection.
Many different bacteria can be involved in bite wound infections. Both
cats and dogs can carry staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobic species, and

CLINICAL CASES

451

Pasteurella species. Humans carry staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus
species, Eikenella species, and anaerobes.
The treatment of bite wounds starts with local care—cleaning, irrigation,
and debridement. The primary closure of bite wounds is controversial and
should be limited to lacerations less than 24 hours old. Deep puncture and
wounds with signs of infection should not be primarily closed. Tetanus vaccination should be updated in those patients as needed. Animal control authorities should be contacted for guidance regarding rabies vaccination.
Although clear evidence of efficacy is lacking for dog and cat bites, current recommendations are for antibiotic prophylaxis for 5 to 7 days for
patients with moderate to severe wounds from dog, cat, or human bites.
Amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin) given orally is an appropriate prophylaxis for most bite wounds. When cellulitis is present, longer courses of antibiotic, usually 7 to 14 days, are required. Hospitalization and surgical intervention
may be required for more severe infections, osteomyelitis, joint infections, and
in patients with complicating medical conditions.

You see a 7-year-old boy a day after he was bitten by his pet dog.
According to the mother, the dog bit the child after he snuck up on the
dog and grabbed its tail. The dog has had all its vaccinations, including
rabies. The child has had no fever, has full movement of the injured
limb, and has no sign of neurologic or vascular injury. The wound is on
the child’s forearm, is not deep, and is not bleeding, but has developed
about 2 cm of erythema surrounding the site. Which of the following is
the most appropriate treatment?
A. Hospitalization for IV antibiotic
B. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for 3 to 5 days
C. Oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for 7 to 14 days
D. Local care without any antibiotic

You see a 43-year-old man who 2 days prior was in a fist fight and
sustained a deep laceration wound around the knuckles from where he
struck the face of another man. He was intoxicated at the time and
upon return home he did not clean the wound and went straight to
sleep. He now has purulent drainage, pain, erythema, and fever. There
is no rash and he has not noted any spreading of the erythema. An x-ray
of the hand shows a hairline fracture of the fifth metacarpal with swelling
and bruising noted over the affected area. Which of the following is
the most likely organism causing infection?
A. Staphylococcus aureus
B. Streptococci
C. Eikenella corrodens
D. Escherichia coli
E. Peptostreptococcus

steps in the management of bite wounds is most effective in preventing
wound infection?
A. Tetanus prophylaxis
B. Rabies prophylaxis
C. Saline irrigation and wound care
D. Prophylactic antibiotics
E. Irrigation and primary closure

ANSWERS
43.1

C. Tetanus vaccination is common to the management of both bee
stings and bite wounds. Bee stings rarely become infected and do not
require antibiotic therapy.

CLINICAL CASES

453

43.2

A. This patient is having a large, local reaction to her sting. This is
an IgE-mediated reaction. It may respond to a course of oral steroids.
There is at least a 50% chance that a similar reaction will occur if
she were stung again, but she is unlikely to develop anaphylactic
reactions in the future and does not need anaphylaxis prophylaxis.
Her history of sting makes cellulitis less likely.

43.3

C. This child is developing cellulitis from the bite wound. Based on
his presentation, he does not appear to require hospitalization. He
can be treated with oral antibiotics for 1 to 2 weeks.

43.4

C. While each of these bacteria can be isolated in injuries from
human bites, Eikenella species appear to be most common in closed
fist injuries.

43.5

C. Rodents and lagomorphs (rabbits) are neither reservoirs of the
rabies virus nor have been shown to transmit the rabies virus to
humans. The most important step in preventing the infectious complications of bite wounds is proper wound care with inspection, irrigation, and debridement. Tetanus prophylaxis should be considered
in all bite wounds. Antibiotic prophylaxis may also be indicated
especially in high-risk bites (those located on the hand, late presentation, cat bites) and should be directed against staphylococci, streptococci, anaerobes, and Pasteurella species as appropriate.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Anyone with a history of anaphylactic reactions should be given a prescription for an epinephrine injector kit and instructed in the importance
of keeping it at hand. These prescriptions need to be updated often, as the
medication expires in 6 to 12 months.
➤ Human “bite” wounds are not always the result of a bite. A punch to the
mouth can cause a serious inoculation and infection to the knuckles of the
puncher.

Case 44
A 60-year-old man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance because
of slurred speech and left-side weakness. His wife states the patient went to
bed approximately at 11 PM the night before and was well. At 5 AM, the time
they usually get up, she noticed that he had some difficulties talking and
moving his left arm and leg. They arrived at the emergency department
at 6 AM. He has history of long-standing hypertension (HTN), heart
attack 10 years before, and high cholesterol. He is taking baby aspirin, an
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, and a statin on a daily
basis. He heavily consumed alcohol in the past, but stopped after the heart
attack. He still smokes a half pack of cigarettes daily. His wife remembers that
about 3 months ago he complained of mild bilateral leg pain during their
morning walk and had to stop after 15 minutes. Also, she remembers that
1 month ago he had “slight right eye blackout” for 5 minutes. On presentation to the emergency department his blood pressure is 195/118 mm Hg, his
pulse is 106 bpm, his respiratory rate is 18 breaths per minute, his temperature is 99.8°F (37.6°C), and his oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.
Although his pupils are equal and reactive and the ocular movements are
intact, he is unable to turn his eyes voluntarily toward the left side. The neck
is supple, there is no jugular venous distension, and there are no bruits. The
lungs are clear, the heart sounds regular without murmurs, and the abdomen
is normal. The limbs are not well-perfused distally. The neurologic examination reveals that he is alert and oriented, although he does not recognize
he is sick. He is right-handed. He shows loss of awareness and attention
with respect to objects or stimuli on his left side. He has mild dysarthria, but
his speech is fluent and he understands and follows commands very well.
There is mild weakness on the left side of the face and left-sided homonymous hemianopsia, but there is no nystagmus or ptosis, and no tongue or
uvula deviation. He is not able to move his left arm and leg, has hyperreflexia, and the left great toe is upgoing.

ANSWERS TO CASE 44:
Cerebrovascular Accident/Transient Ischemic Attack
Summary: The patient is a 60-year-old, right-handed man with history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, who presents to
the emergency room with a 5-hour history of slurred speech and an inability to
move his left arm and leg. He had an episode of amaurosis fugax (blindness) in
his right eye 1 month before admission. On physical examination, although he
is alert and oriented, he has no awareness of his disability (anosognosia) and
exhibits left-sided neglect. He has hypertension, dysarthria, and left hemiparesis. He also has left-sided homonymous hemianopsia, conjugate rightward gaze
deviation, left hemifacial weakness, and left hyperreflexia.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Cerebrovascular accident (CVA).

➤

Next diagnostic step: Obtain a brain computed tomography (CT) scan
without contrast.

➤

Next step in therapy: Determine advisability for acute treatment with
thrombolytic agents.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Recognize the significance of a correct diagnosis and evaluation of transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and cerebrovascular accidents (CVAs).
2. Recognize the conditions that can mimic a stroke.
3. Understand that the clinical evaluation gives the most important clues
about diagnosis of stroke.
4. Be familiar with the accepted approach for the early management of
patients with ischemic stroke.
5. Be familiar with the current strategies for prevention of ischemic stroke
and TIA.

Considerations
This 60-year-old patient has developed focal neurologic deficits, which is the
usual presentation of patients with strokes. Considering that he has a history
of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and vascular manifestations of atherosclerosis, such as coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease
(lower extremity claudication), ischemic stroke is the most probable diagnosis. Furthermore, he had a TIA (amaurosis fugax) 30 days before admission,
which put him at even greater risk for an ischemic stroke. His neurologic

CLINICAL CASES

457

deficits are compatible with an ischemic stroke in the territory of the right
middle cerebral artery, which is his nondominant hemisphere and the reason
he is not aphasic.
Of immediate importance, the clinician should confirm that the neurologic impairments are secondary to ischemic stroke and not other conditions,
especially intracranial hemorrhage. A brain CT without contrast should be
obtained as soon as possible to exclude hemorrhage, tumor, and abscess. Blood
sugar, drug screen, coagulation studies, serum electrolytes, renal function tests,
lipid profile, and a complete blood count are also indicated. A cardiac monitor should be attached and a 12-lead ECG obtained so as to exclude acute
myocardial infarction or atrial fibrillation.
Because it has been more than 3 hours from the onset of symptoms, this
patient is not a candidate for thrombolytic therapy. The initial ABC (airway,
breathing, and circulation) survey should guide treatment if the vital signs are
compromised. Although his blood pressure is elevated, in the setting of an acute
CVA, blood pressure management should be cautious. The patient should be
admitted to the hospital for further evaluation and management, preferably to
a dedicated stroke unit if available. Aspirin should be given within 48 hours of
the stroke, and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis should be used. However,
anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin for the infarction itself has a poor riskbenefit ratio and is not indicated. An evaluation of his swallowing function and
an early physiotherapy consultation should be obtained. Further imaging with
brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), magnetic resonance angiography, or
CT angiography can help to clarify the etiology of the stroke and guide treatment. In this patient, carotid Doppler studies are indicated as he had an episode
of amaurosis fugax, which is caused by a blockage of the opthalmic artery which
branches from the internal carotid.
Management of his chronic medical conditions, to try to reduce his risk of
subsequent strokes, is critical. In this patient, these measures include tight
control of his hypertension and hypercholesterolemia, along with smoking
cessation. Because this patient had a stroke while taking aspirin, an alternative antiplatelet agent should be considered.

CLINICAL APPROACH
There are 700,000 people that suffer from stroke in the United States each
year, and the incidence of TIA is approximately 200,000 to 500,000 per year.
Strokes remain the third leading cause of death in North America and are a
major cause of disability. TIA is defined as a focal neurologic deficit lasting
less than 24 hours. Most TIAs last for less than 1 hour. A stroke is presumed
to have occurred if the symptoms persist for more than 24 hours. A residual
ischemic neurologic deficit (RIND) is defined as a neurologic deficit of greater
than 24 hours and less than 3 weeks.
Patients with a TIA are at increased risk of a subsequent stroke. The
reported occurrence of a stroke after a TIA is as high as 5.3% within 2 days and
10.5% within 90 days. Patients with a TIA often require hospital admission,
further evaluation, and the same long-term management as stroke patients.
Hypertension is the single most important risk factor for stroke, and the
incidence of stroke in the United States has decreased partly as a result of better efforts to control hypertension in the past few decades. Other risk factors
include diabetes mellitus, older age, male sex, family history, dyslipidemia,
and smoking (See Table 44–1). Many cardiovascular conditions also predispose people to stroke, usually through an embolic clot. These conditions
include atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, endocarditis, carotid stenosis, rheumatic heart disease, presence of mechanical valve, advanced dilated
cardiomyopathy, and a patent foramen ovale or atrial septal defect which can
expose the systemic arterial system to a paradoxical embolus from a venous
source. Sickle cell disease is also a risk factor for stroke. Patients with sickle
cell commonly experience their strokes as children.
Strokes are generally classified as being of thrombotic or embolic origin.
Strokes that affect the small branches of the main arteries of brain are termed
lacunar infarcts or small-vessel strokes. These strokes often forewarn a larger,
more debilitating stroke. The causes of the emboli are usually of cardiovascular origin and include the previously mentioned conditions as well as dissection of various vessels. Most emboli are clots. However, emboli in rare
occasions can be vegetations from infective endocarditis, sterile vegetations
from Libman-Sacks endocarditis (which occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus), and marantic endocarditis, which occurs with cancer.

DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION
Sudden onset of focal neurologic deficit is the usual presentation of stroke
patients, although some patients can have a gradual worsening of symptoms.
Unless there is a hemispheric infarct, basilar artery occlusion, or cerebellar
stroke with edema, nearly all of the patients are alert. If the middle cerebral
artery territory is affected, the patient would experience aphasia (when dominant hemisphere is involved), contralateral hemiparesis, sensory loss, spatial

neglect, and contralateral impaired conjugate gaze. When the territory of the
anterior cerebral artery is affected, foot and leg deficits are more frequent than
arm deficits. These patients often have associated cognitive and personality
changes. Vertebrobasilar stroke symptoms and signs include motor or sensory
loss in all four limbs, crossed signs, disconjugate gaze, nystagmus, dysarthria,
and dysphagia. There can be ipsilateral limb ataxia and gait ataxia if the cerebellum is affected.
Assessment of the vital signs is important in the initial examination.
Severe high blood pressure can be suggestive of hypertensive encephalopathy

460

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

or intracranial hemorrhage. A fever may lead to consideration of an infectious
cause. A rapid or irregularly irregular pulse may imply atrial fibrillation as a
potential cause of the stroke. A timely general physical examination and comprehensive neurologic examination should follow.
The differential diagnosis of acute neurologic symptoms and signs is broad.
Along with CVAs, these symptoms can be caused by seizures, acute confusional states, delirium, syncope, metabolic and toxic encephalopathy (hypoglycemia), brain tumors, CNS infections, migraines, multiple sclerosis, and
subdural hematoma. Migraines with neurological symptoms can be especially
difficult to differentiate from stroke since migraines do not have to be accompanied by a headache. However, the symptoms of stroke are usually of a much
more rapid onset than those of a migraine. Stroke victims are also usually alert
and aware of what is happening to them, unlike people suffering from delirium
or various types of encephalopathies. When it is determined that a stroke is the
cause of the presentation, it is crucial to differentiate between ischemic and
hemorrhagic stroke because of the implications on further treatment.
The initial assessment should establish if the patient is eligible for thrombolytic treatment. Establishing the time of symptom onset is the most important factor. The onset of symptoms is assumed to be the time that the patient
was last known to be free of symptoms such as when they went to bed.

Brain Imaging
A CT scan of the brain without contrast is the initial imaging test of choice.
CT of the brain may not show an ischemic stroke for up to 72 hours, but can
exclude most cases of intracranial hemorrhage, tumors, or abscesses quickly.
It is also more readily available, cost effective, and takes less time than MRI.
CT scan can also be used to detect a hemorrhagic transformation of an infarct
in a patient with an ischemic stroke whose symptoms deteriorate.
Further imaging studies may be indicated to clarify the etiology of the
stroke and to detect intracranial or extracranial arterial occlusions, which
may affect treatment decisions. Evaluation of the cerebrovascular system can
be accomplished with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), CT angiography, catheter angiography, or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography.

Other Tests
A 12-lead ECG should be done in all stroke patients in order to detect acute
myocardial infarctions, which can both cause strokes or be the result of a stroke.
An ECG will also aid in the diagnosis of atrial fibrillation. Echocardiography
may also be necessary to adequately assess the heart. Transesophageal echocardiography is particularly useful in detecting cardiac sources of embolism, such as
thrombus caused by myocardial infarction, endocarditis, rheumatic heart disease, valvular prostheses, and atrial septal defects. A carotid Doppler study is
often advisable as well in order to evaluate for carotid plaques or stenosis.

CLINICAL CASES

461

Blood glucose, electrolytes, renal function tests, and drug screening are
important to exclude hypoglycemia and metabolic and toxic encephalopathy.
If the patient is on anticoagulant therapy, the prothrombin time, partial
thromboplastin time, and platelet count should be measured and are required
before considering thrombolytic therapy. A lipid panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ANA, complete blood count, and serologic tests for syphilis are
also oftentimes indicated. In young patients with no identifiable cause for a
stroke, a workup for coagulation disorders or antiphospholipid syndrome may
be indicated. A lumbar puncture is indicated if subarachnoid hemorrhage is
considered and the CT is not diagnostic or if a CNS infection is possible.

TREATMENT
As in every critical patient, the initial survey should assess the ABCs. If
hypoxia is detected, supplemental oxygen should be administered to maintain
oxygen saturation above 95% and the cause of the hypoxia investigated (partial airway obstruction, aspiration pneumonia, atelectasis). An endotracheal
tube should be placed if the airway is threatened. A cardiac monitor should
be placed to detect atrial fibrillation or any other arrhythmias.
Unless a hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute renal failure,
or pulmonary edema is present, the treatment of arterial hypertension should
be cautious. Antihypertensive medication is recommended when the systolic
blood pressure is greater than 220 mm Hg or the diastolic blood pressure is
greater than 120 mm Hg. If the patient is suitable for thrombolytic treatment,
medication should be initiated to decrease the systolic blood pressure to less than
185 mm Hg and the diastolic blood pressure less than 110 mm Hg. The agents
most frequently used are IV labetalol, nicardipine, and sodium nitroprusside.
Fever and high blood sugar after a stroke are often associated with poorer
outcomes and should be controlled during the poststroke period. An infectious source for the fever should be investigated.
Except when thrombolytic therapy is given, most patients with a nonhemorrhagic stroke should receive aspirin within the first 48 hours. Urgent
anticoagulation is not recommended.
Judiciously selected patients can benefit from intravenous administration of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) if they can be
treated within 3 hours of the onset of ischemic stroke. The risk of hemorrhage
associated with rtPA treatment is approximately 5% and there are numerous
contraindications to the use of thrombolytic therapy, including recent surgery,
trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, myocardial infarction, use of certain anticoagulant medications, and uncontrolled hypertension. Depending on availability, some hospitals have the capability of direct intra-arterial thrombolysis
in which the thrombolytic agent is delivered directly to the clot via canalization or even mechanical retrieval of thrombus. These modes of treatment may
be considered in centers with experimental protocols or extensive experience.

462

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Poststroke cerebral edema can be a very serious complication and can lead
to herniation of brain stem resulting in death. This edema can be treated with
mannitol or decompression surgery, although it is insufficient evidence to show
significant benefit for these treatments at this time.
Studies have shown that treatment in a dedicated stroke unit results in better outcomes and less mortality. Early posttreatment care includes mobilization once the patient is stable and evaluations of the patient’s ability to
swallow. After a stroke, the patient is often immobile and needs intensive
medical care in order to avoid malnutrition, skin breakdown, and other complications. The patient’s neural deficits usually improve after the stroke and
can keep improving up to 6 months to a year. Prior strokes also predispose
patients to seizures, and some patients may initially present with a seizure as
the first symptom of stroke. When thrombolytic therapy is not used, deep vein
thrombosis prophylaxis should be provided. Family support and treatment of
depression should be also initiated when appropriate.

PREVENTION OF STROKE IN PATIENTS WITH PREVIOUS
ISCHEMIC STROKE OR TIA
A history of a previous TIA or CVA confers a high risk for future events.
Aggressive risk factor control should be undertaken in these patients. All
patients should be counseled to quit smoking and to reduce alcohol intake.
Hypertensive patients should be treated per JNC-7 (Joint National Committee
on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure,
7th report) guidelines (see Case 30). High cholesterol should be treated with
a goal of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) less than 100 mg/dL. Tight diabetic
control should be sought. Antiplatelet agents such as aspirin (50 to 325 mg/d),
the combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole (Aggrenox), or
clopidogrel (Plavix) should be started in patients with a history of noncardioembolic ischemic stroke or TIA.
Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) can reduce the risk of stroke in someone
with a history of previous TIA/CVA and carotid artery stenosis. It is indicated
for symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis greater than 70% when it can
be performed by an experienced surgeon with a low rate of perioperative complications. CEA can be considered for symptomatic patients with a 50% to
70% stenosis, but is not indicated when there is less than 50% stenosis.
Noninvasive carotid balloon angioplasty and stenting is now also being done
and is an alternative to CEA.
Anticoagulation with warfarin reduces the risk of stroke and stroke recurrence in certain circumstances. It is indicated to reduce the risk of embolic
strokes for patients with persistent or paroxysmal atrial fibrillation or very
advanced heart failure. It is also indicated for patients with an ischemic stroke
caused by a myocardial infarction and existence of left ventricular thrombus, as
well as for patients with rheumatic heart disease or a mechanical heart valve.

44.4

A 65-year-old man was hospitalized due to weakness of the right arm,
which was diagnosed as an ischemic stroke. Which of the following is
the best step regarding prevention of future strokes in this patient?
A. He would likely benefit from oral anticoagulation.
B. If he has 60% right carotid occlusion, then he is likely to benefit
from carotid endarterectomy.
C. Aspirin is an acceptable option for initial therapy.
D. LDL cholesterol should be treated with a goal of less than 130 mg/dL.

44.5

A man is brought to the emergency room by ambulance. Coworkers at
his office stated that he was acting normally until approximately 1 hour
ago when he became confused and had trouble walking. One coworker
thought that his right leg seemed especially weak. The vitals are temperature 98.6°F (37°C), pulse 110 bpm, and blood pressure 120/80 mm Hg.
The patient is arousable but does not follow commands. He has a medical alert bracelet on his arms indicating that he is a diabetic and allergic
to penicillin. A blood glucose taken at the bedside is 20 mg/dL. Which
of the following should be your immediate next step?
A. Immediately give the patient glucose or glucagon.
B. Immediately obtain a CT scan to assess possibility for giving rtPA.
C. Immediately perform a lumbar puncture to assess for meningitis.
D. Immediately give the patient mannitol.
E. Immediately start CPR with chest compressions.

ANSWERS
44.1

A. A TIA is a brief neurologic episode, typically less than 1 hour in
duration that does not cause infarction. The occurrence of stroke
after TIA is as high as 5.3% within 2 days and 10.5% within 90 days.
Warfarin is indicated in specific circumstances, such as the presence
of atrial fibrillation, but is not routinely used following a TIA.

44.2

A. Routine chest x-rays affect the clinical management in few patients
with stroke, and are not recommended as routine initial workup. CT
of the brain without contrast can exclude most cases of intracranial
hemorrhage, tumors, or abscesses, and is the initial test of choice in the
workup of suspected stroke but it can miss up to 15% of subarachnoid
hemorrhages. When a subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected but not
seen on CT, a lumbar puncture is indicated for diagnosis.

44.3

D. Mobilization of stroke patients should be started when they are
considered medically stable. In the setting of an acute stroke, management of high blood pressure should be cautious. Thrombolytic
therapy can be beneficial in selected patients, but carries significant
risks and has numerous contraindications. Fever should be treated
and a workup performed to determine its etiology, as it carries an
increased risk of morbidity and mortality.

CLINICAL CASES

465

44.4

C. Patients with stroke but no detected sources of embolism benefit
from antiplatelet agents, not anticoagulants. Aspirin, clopidogrel, or a
combination of aspirin and dipyridamole are acceptable regimens. For
patients with recent TIA or ischemic stroke and ipsilateral severe
(>70%) carotid artery stenosis, carotid endarterectomy is recommended. When the degree of stenosis is less than 50%, there is no indication for CEA. Patients with a history of symptomatic cerebrovascular
disease should be treated to an LDL goal of less than 100 mg/dL.

44.5

A. The patient has severe hypoglycemia and needs to be treated
immediately with glucose or glucagon. If the patient does not recover
with glucose or glucagon infusion, then other tests, such as a CT scan,
may be warranted. But the most important first step is to treat the
patient’s low blood sugar. Be aware that hypoglycemia can mimic
many of the symptoms of a stroke, including focal weakness. Mannitol
is used in cases of cerebral edema and not for raising blood sugar.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Hypertension is the single most important risk factor for stroke.
➤ Although most strokes are cerebral infarcts, it is crucial to differentiate
between ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke because of the implications on
further treatment.
➤ CT of the brain without contrast is the initial imaging test of choice in most
suspected strokes.
➤ Unless a hypertensive encephalopathy, aortic dissection, acute renal failure, or pulmonary edema is present, the treatment of arterial hypertension
should be cautious.

Case 45
A 39-year-old homeless man presents to the emergency department for
cough and fever. He says that his illness has been worsening over the
past 2 weeks. He originally had dyspnea on exertion and now is short of
breath at rest. On questioning, he tells you that he lives in a homeless
shelter when he can, but he frequently sleeps on the streets. He has used
IV drugs (primarily heroin) “on and off” for many years. He denies medical history but the only time he gets medical attention is when he
comes to the emergency department for an illness or injury. On review
of systems, he complains of fatigue, weight loss, and diarrhea. On examination, he is a thin, disheveled man appearing much older than his
stated age. His temperature is 100.5°F (38.0°C), his blood pressure is
100/50 mm Hg, his pulse is 105 beats/min, and his respiratory rate is
24 breaths/min. His initial oxygen saturation is 89% on room air, which
comes up to 94% on 4 L of oxygen by nasal cannula. Significant findings on examination include dry mucous membranes, a tachycardic but
regular cardiac rhythm, a benign abdomen, and generally wastedappearing extremities. His pulmonary examination is significant for
tachypnea and fine crackles bilaterally, but no visible signs of cyanosis.
His chest x-ray is read by the radiologist as having diffuse, bilateral,
interstitial infiltrates that look like “ground glass.”

HIV and AIDS
Summary: A 39-year-old, homeless, IV drug abuser is seen with fever, cough,
dyspnea, and fatigue. He is found to be tachypneic, febrile, and hypoxemic.
His chest x-ray reveals bilateral interstitial infiltrates.
➤

Most likely cause of current illness: Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly
known as Pneumocystis carinii) pneumonia.

➤

Most probable underlying illness: AIDS.

Recommended current testing and treatment: Complete blood count
(CBC), electrolytes, arterial blood gas; HIV enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay with confirmatory Western blot; CD4 cell count; HIV RNA assay;
sputum for P jiroveci; start treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole
(TMP-SMX) and consider starting highly active antiretroviral therapy or
HAART.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the common risks and modes of transmission of HIV/AIDS.
2. Be aware of common presentations of persons infected with HIV.
3. Learn the role of antiretroviral therapy and other adjunctive treatments in
the chronic management of HIV and AIDS.
4. Be able to identify common complications and opportunistic infections associated with HIV/AIDS.

Considerations
The case described is that of a 39-year-old man who is homeless and an intravenous
drug user. He has had fatigue and weight loss. He now presents with fever, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. It is likely that he is infected with HIV, and has P jiroveci
pneumonia. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the helper T cells of
the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the cell-signaling protein
CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their effectiveness. This
decline in functional helper T cells disables the cell-mediated arm of the immune
system and leaves the body vulnerable to infection from multiple opportunistic
organisms. This advanced stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic
infections occur, is known as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or AIDS.
Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly known as P carinii) pneumonia is an AIDSdefining illness in someone infected with HIV. P jiroveci is a fungus that may
colonize many people, but typically causes disease only in those with profound

CLINICAL CASES

469

immune deficiencies, such as AIDS infections or cancers treated with chemotherapy. P jiroveci pneumonia usually presents with nonproductive cough, fever, and
dyspnea that worsens over a few days to a few weeks. Patients usually are found to
be febrile, tachypneic, and hypoxic, although their lung examination may be
unremarkable (other than tachypnea). The presence of a bilateral interstitial infiltrate on chest x-ray, often described as having a ground-glass appearance, is classic
for P jiroveci pneumonia. The identification of the organism in sputum, either
spontaneously produced or induced, is diagnostic, but treatment is usually started
prior to definitive diagnosis in those with a classic clinical picture.
As P jiroveci pneumonia occurs after the CD4 count has markedly reduced,
patients often will have symptoms and signs of other AIDS-related complications as well. It is common to see oral or esophageal candidiasis, diarrhea,
Kaposi sarcoma, wasting syndrome, and other complications in a patient presenting with P jiroveci pneumonia. Although it presents in the setting of
advanced disease, P jiroveci pneumonia remains a common presenting illness in
those who did not know that they were infected with HIV and is a frequent initial opportunistic infection in those with known HIV disease. The incidence of
P jiroveci pneumonia is decreasing in the United States with more widespread
awareness of HIV disease, broader usage of antiretroviral therapy, and prophylactic use of TMP-SMX in patients with CD4 count of less than 200 cells/μL.

APPROACH TO
HIV and AIDS
DEFINITIONS
ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS): This advanced
stage of the HIV infection, in which such opportunistic infections occur with
specific criteria for its designation.
HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS (HIV): A retrovirus that infects the
helper T cells of the immune system, which are defined by the presence of the
cell-signaling protein CD4, and causes a decline in both their number and their
effectiveness.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Epidemiology
Over 40 million people in the world are living with HIV infection. It is estimated that more than 21/2 million people, including over 300,000 children,
die from AIDS every year with a disproportionate share of the deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. HIV disease is caused by the human retroviruses,
HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-1 is more common worldwide, whereas HIV-2 has
been reported in western Africa, Europe, South America, and Canada.

470

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

In the United States, more than 1 million people are estimated to be
infected with HIV, with approximately 25% unaware of their infection. The
highest prevalence of HIV occurs in men who have sex with other men and
in IV drug users, although the occurrence in heterosexual sexual contact is
increasing. African Americans are disproportionately affected with infection,
both in total numbers of cases and in development of new infections.

Transmission
HIV is transmitted from person to person through contact with infected
blood and body fluids. Sexual contact is the most common mechanism of
transmission and, while anal intercourse has the highest rate of transmission,
HIV can be acquired through vaginal and oral intercourse as well. The risk of
HIV transmission is also increased by the presence of genital or anal lesions
caused by other sexually transmitted diseases, such as gonorrhea and genital
herpes. The risk of transmission can be reduced by the proper and consistent
use of latex condoms (either male or female condoms). Because HIV can pass
through lambskin condoms, these are not recommended. Circumcision has
also been shown to decrease the rate of HIV transmission.
Because of the large amount of undiagnosed HIV infections, the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2006 expanded screening recommendations, which are summarized in Table 45-1.

Table 45–1 HIV SCREENING RECOMMENDATIONS
For patients in all health-care settings

• HIV screening is recommended for patients in all health-care settings after the patient is
notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening).

• Persons at high risk for HIV infection should be screened for HIV at least annually.
• Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for
medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing.

• Prevention counseling should not be required with HIV diagnostic testing or as part
of HIV screening programs in health-care settings.
For pregnant women

• HIV screening should be included in the routine panel of prenatal screening tests for
all pregnant women.

• HIV screening is recommended after the patient is notified that testing will be performed unless the patient declines (opt-out screening).

• Separate written consent for HIV testing should not be required; general consent for
medical care should be considered sufficient to encompass consent for HIV testing.
• Repeat screening in the third trimester is recommended in certain jurisdictions with
elevated rates of HIV infection among pregnant women.

CLINICAL CASES

Sharing needles by IV drug users is the second most common source of
transmission of HIV. Vertical transmission from an infected woman to her
baby has been found to occur during pregnancy, during the process of delivery
of a baby, and from breast-feeding. Blood and blood-product transfusions have
been linked to infection, although the routine screening of donor blood for
HIV now makes this an extremely rare event.
Health-care workers have been infected with HIV through accidental
punctures with needles used on HIV-infected patients. There is also a risk of
infection by infected blood entering through open skin wounds or mucous
membranes. The risk of transmission to health-care workers is low and is
related to the viral load of the patient, the amount of blood to which the
worker is exposed, and the depth of the inoculum. Postexposure risk of developing HIV infection can be reduced by immediate and careful cleaning of the
exposure/puncture site along with postexposure prophylactic (PEP) treatment
with antiretroviral therapy. Post-exposure prophylaxis should ideally be
started within 2 hours after the exposure and should only be used when exposure to HIV-contaminated blood is likely. Although animal models limit the
usefulness of PEP to 36 hours, there is no defined time limit before starting
medications. The currently recommended length of PEP is 4 weeks.
HIV has been measured in small amounts in saliva and tears of HIVinfected patients, but no cases of transmission based on exposure to these have
been documented. Transmission has been reported to occur in bite wounds
from infected individuals, but only when significant tissue damage and bleeding has occurred. Measurable amounts of HIV have not been found in sweat.
No case of HIV has been documented to have occurred via an insect vector.

Primary Infection
Following initial exposure to HIV, some patients will complain of nonspecific
symptoms, such as low-grade fever, fatigue, sore throat, or myalgias. This illness
typically occurs 6 to 8 weeks following the infection and is self-limited. The primary infection is also known as acute seroconversion syndrome, as the symptoms are thought to be related to the development of antibodies to the virus.
Following the resolution of the primary infection symptoms (if any occur),
there is a period of clinical latency. During this time, most infected persons
are asymptomatic, although some may have lymphadenopathy. This period
can last from 6 months to 10 years following the transmission of the virus.
However, while the patient is asymptomatic during this period, a relentless
decline in helper T-cell number and immune function usually occurs in the
untreated patient, with the result that many patients initially present with
profound immunodeficiency and opportunistic infections.

Clinical Categorization of HIV/AIDS Infections
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines three clinical categories and three laboratory categories (based on CD4 cell count) of HIV

472

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

infection. The clinical categories are A, B, and C; and the laboratory categories are 1, 2, and 3. For classification purposes, HIV-infected patients can
be defined with both a clinical and laboratory category (eg, A3, B2, etc).
The laboratory categories are as follows:
1. CD4 cell count of 500 cells/μL or more
2. CD4 cell count of 200 to 499 cells/μL
3. CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/μL
Clinical category A includes asymptomatic HIV infection, primary HIV
infection (above), and persistent generalized lymphadenopathy. Persistent
generalized lymphadenopathy is defined as enlarged lymph nodes involving at
least two noncontiguous sites other than inguinal nodes.
Category B infections are symptomatic conditions in an HIV-infected person that are either indicative of a defect in cell-mediated immunity or that
have a course or management complicated by HIV infections. These are not
AIDS-defining illnesses and were previously known as AIDS-related complex.
Table 45–2 lists some of these infections, which are not AIDS-defining illnesses. Table 45–3 lists some of the category C conditions, which are AIDSdefining illnesses. The presence of a CD4 cell count of less than 200 cells/μL,
with or without symptoms, is also considered diagnostic of AIDS.
For classification purposes, a patient’s HIV is defined by the highest clinical category in which the patient has ever qualified. For example, someone
with oral candidiasis (category B) who is treated and now asymptomatic
remains in clinical category B. Similarly, once a category C condition has
occurred, the person will remain in category C.

Diagnostic Evaluation
The standard screening test for HIV infection is the detection of HIV antibodies using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Samples that
are repeatedly positive on ELISA testing must be confirmed by Western
blot testing. The Western blot test is an electrophoresis that detects antibodies
to HIV antigens of specific molecular weights.
When HIV is diagnosed, a complete history and physical examination
should be performed. Emphasis should be placed on identifying comorbid conditions, determining the presence of any category B or C conditions, reducing
risky behaviors, and assisting with coping strategies. HIV is reportable to
local health authorities, but partner notification laws vary by state, so it is
important to know the local regulations.
Before instituting therapy, laboratory testing should include HIV genotype
testing to identify strains that may be resistant to therapy. HIV RNA levels
can help to assess disease activity. CD4 lymphocyte counts should be measured at baseline and, generally, every 3 to 6 months thereafter to monitor for

474

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

disease staging, progression, and the risk of complications. A complete blood
count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel, and urinalysis should be performed at baseline and periodically thereafter to monitor for complications of
HIV and of the medications that are used in treatment. Serology for toxoplasmosis and cytomegalovirus should also be obtained to identify organisms
at risk for reactivation following immunosuppression.
Screening for other sexually transmitted diseases (syphilis, hepatitis B
and C, gonorrhea, chlamydia) should be performed initially and repeated, if
needed, because of any ongoing risks identified. Hepatitis B and A vaccination should be offered to those who lack immunity. A purified protein derivative (PPD) test should be done, and if initially negative, repeated annually.
However, a PPD may be falsely negative if the patient is very immunosuppressed or very ill. Women should have regular Papanicolaou (Pap) smears to
evaluate for cervical dysplasia or cancer.

Late Disease
HIV and the opportunistic infections it allows affect every organ system in
the body. Some infections, such as tuberculosis and pneumococcal pneumonia, also affect healthy people but are greatly increased in incidence and
severity in the presence of HIV. Many mildly pathologic organisms, such as
Candida, cause unusual, severe infections in parts of the body, such as the
esophagus and lungs, which they would rarely if ever affect without coinfection with HIV. Moreover some AIDS defining conditions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, can occur at a normal T-cell counts while other infections, such as
cytomegalovirus retinitis and cryptococcal meningitis, are only seen in the
presence of extreme immunodeficiency and very low T-cell counts. Many
cancers are common in HIV-positive people, some of which, such as cervical
carcinoma, are found in the non–HIV-infected population while others, such
as primary CNS lymphoma, are extremely rare outside of the HIV infected.
Moreover, HIV infection damages the body directly and leads to such conditions as HIV-related dementia and HIV-associated nephropathy. Without
antiretroviral therapy, AIDS is a universally fatal disease.

Treatment
Because of the complexity of treatment regimens and frequently changing treatment guidelines, patients with HIV/AIDS should be referred, in almost all
cases, to a physician with expertise in treating these conditions. In general,
antiretroviral therapy is used in patients who have AIDS (by laboratory or clinical criteria), who have symptoms of disease, or who are pregnant (to reduce the
risk of vertical transmission). Updated guidelines on HIV/AIDS treatment and
monitoring can be obtained by going to http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov.
Prophylactic treatments to reduce the risk of infection are also important
in immunosuppressed patients. HIV patients should receive annual influenza

CLINICAL CASES

475

vaccination and should be offered pneumococcal vaccination (preferably
before the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/μL). Live virus vaccines are
contraindicated in both HIV patients and their close (household) contacts.
Prophylaxis against P jiroveci pneumonia should be instituted using TMPSMX when the CD4 count falls to less than 200 cells/μL and Mycobacterium
avium–intracellulare complex prophylaxis, using azithromycin or clarithromycin,
is recommended if the CD4 count falls to less than 75 cells/μL.

A 32-year-old housekeeper working at a clinic where a significant
number of HIV infected patients are seen was stuck by an inappropriately discarded needle while cleaning up a room. The needle had no
obvious blood on it and she was unsure which patient the needle was
used upon. She cleaned the stick with rubbing alcohol and an antibacterial ointment. She waited 2 days before reporting the injury
because she was fearful to admit her mistake. After prompting from
her husband, she now desires to know what she should do. Which of the
following is the best next step for this patient?
A. Recommend postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) since the exposure
happened at a clinic with a risk that the needle was contaminated
with HIV.
B. Do not give PEP because it has been more than 2 hours since the
exposure.
C. Offer PEP after explaining risks and benefits of treatment, because
this percutaneous exposure came from an unknown source at a
high-risk clinic.
D. Do not give PEP because it has been definitely shown not to
decrease the transmission of HIV.

ANSWERS
45.1

C. With this level of cell count, the patient should continue antiretroviral therapy and start P jiroveci pneumonia prophylaxis. The
level is not yet low enough to recommend Mycobacterium avium–
intracellulare complex prophylaxis.

45.2

D. Kaposi Sarcoma is an AIDS-defining condition. All of the other
conditions listed are clinical category B.

45.3

D. The varicella vaccine is a live attenuated virus and is contraindicated in HIV.

CLINICAL CASES

45.4

477

C. Percutaneous unknown source exposures have an indeterminate
risk. Current guidelines recommend that unknown source exposures
generally do not warrant PEP. However, in high-risk settings, workers should be counseled about the risks and benefits of the medication and allowed to choose PEP should they desire.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Because of the complexity of the drug regimens and the ever-changing
guidelines, persons with HIV should be comanaged with an infectious disease specialist or other physician with expertise in treating HIV.
➤ The use of antiretroviral therapy during pregnancy can reduce the risk of
vertical transmission of HIV. Women with high HIV viral titers at term
should be offered elective cesarean delivery, as this further reduces the risk
of vertical transmission.
➤ The risk of transmission of HIV to health-care workers by accidental needle
sticks from HIV-infected patients is very low. It is important to report these
injuries promptly, as early prophylactic treatment can significantly lower
the risk of developing HIV disease.

Case 46
A 33-year-old African-American man presents to the office for an acute
visit with nausea and diarrhea that he has had for the past week. Along
with these symptoms, he has had a low-grade fever, some right upper
quadrant (RUQ) abdominal pain, and has noticed that his eyes seem
yellow. He has no significant medical history and takes no medications
regularly. He denies alcohol, tobacco, or IV drug use. He works as a pastor in a local church that went on a mission to build a medical clinic in
a rural area of Central America about 5 weeks ago. He had a mild case
of traveler’s diarrhea while there, but otherwise has felt well. On examination, he is a well-developed man who appears to be moderately ill.
His temperature is 99.8°F (37.6°C), his blood pressure is 110/80 mm Hg,
his pulse is 90 beats/min, and his respiratory rate is 14 breaths/min. He
has a prominent yellow color to his sclera and under his tongue. His
mucous membranes are moist. Lung and cardiac examinations are normal. His abdomen has normal bowel sounds and tenderness in the right
upper quadrant. His liver edge is palpable just below the costal margin.
There are no other masses felt, no rebound, and no guarding. On rectal
examination, he has clay-colored soft stool that is fecal occult blood test
negative.

Summary: A 33-year-old man with no significant medical history develops
diarrhea, abdominal pain, and jaundice about a month after traveling to
Central America. He is noted to have yellow eyes and tender hepatomegaly.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Acute infection with hepatitis A.

➤

Most probable timing and source of infection: Ingestion of contaminated
food or water while on his mission to Central America 5 weeks earlier.

➤

Test to confirm the diagnosis: Antihepatitis A immunoglobulin (Ig) M.

➤

Treatment of acute hepatitis A: Supportive care and symptomatic treatment for the patient; report infection to local health department; consider
giving Ig prophylaxis to close household or sexual contacts.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a differential diagnosis for adults with jaundice.
2. Know the symptoms, management, complications, and modes of transmission of hepatitis A, B, and C.
3. Be able to interpret the results of hepatitis viral serology tests.

Considerations
This presentation of diarrhea along with nonspecific, crampy abdominal pain
is most often caused by viral gastroenteritis. However, this patient has several
symptoms and signs that serve as clues to point to other potential diagnoses.
Of particular importance, the complaint of yellow eyes should prompt an
evaluation for jaundice.
Bilirubin is a breakdown product of red blood cells. During the breakdown
of hemoglobin, bilirubin is formed and bound to albumin, which carries it to
the liver. In the liver, a portion of the bilirubin is made water soluble by conjugation to a glucuronide. This “conjugated bilirubin” is excreted in the bile
and then largely excreted in the stool. Bilirubin that is not conjugated
(“unconjugated bilirubin”) in the liver remains bound to albumin.
Most cases of jaundice can be characterized as having prehepatic, hepatic,
or posthepatic causes. Prehepatic jaundice is most often from hemolysis of
red blood cells, which overwhelms the liver’s ability to conjugate and clear
the bilirubin through its normal pathways. This produces a hyperbilirubinemia that is primarily unconjugated.

CLINICAL CASES

481

Hepatic causes of jaundice can lead to either unconjugated or conjugated
hyperbilirubinemia. Viruses, such as hepatitis, and alcohol reduce the liver’s
ability to transport bilirubin after it has been conjugated, resulting in a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.
Posthepatic jaundice is usually caused by obstruction to the flow of bile
through the bile ducts. This can be caused by bile duct stones, strictures, or
tumors that narrow or block the ducts. Posthepatic jaundice is, therefore, a
conjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

APPROACH TO
Jaundice
DEFINITIONS
CAPUT MEDUSA: Dilated superficial periumbilical veins that usually result

from shunting associated with severe portal hypertension
SPIDER VEINS: Dilated, small, superficial veins that appear as red, blue, or
purple web-like formations, most often seen on the legs and face

CLINICAL APPROACH
History and Examination
The most important information in the diagnostic evaluation usually comes
from the history. In patients presenting with jaundice, the history should be
thorough and should include questions focused on identifying the common
causes of jaundice. Specific information should include when the jaundice
commenced and whether it is of acute or gradual onset. The presence of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,
or changes in stool color can be significant. Itching is common in jaundice
and this symptom may, in fact, precede the onset of the yellow color.
Associated symptoms, such as unintended weight loss or the development
of adenopathy may lead to the consideration of certain diagnoses, including
malignancies. Bruising or bleeding disorders may suggest severe hepatic dysfunction that is interfering with the production of clotting factors. Increasing
abdominal girth may be caused by ascites and peripheral edema by obstruction
of venous return from the lower extremities or hypoalbuminemia.
A complete review of the past medical history is necessary. Any medications, whether prescription, nonprescription, or herbal supplements, should
be reviewed. Acetaminophen is a widely used over-the-counter agent that, in
toxic amounts, can cause hepatocellular damage. Numerous herbal agents
have been associated with liver damage as well.

482

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

The social history is of critical importance in a patient with jaundice.
The abuse of alcohol is the most common cause of cirrhosis. IV drug use or
unsafe sexual practices can lead to infection with hepatitis B or C. Hepatitis
is also associated with getting tattoos if unsterilized equipment is used. Travel
history, especially the location and timing of any international travel, can
lead to the consideration of hepatitis A.
A comprehensive physical examination is also important in the workup of
someone with jaundice. Along with a general physical examination, certain
areas should be emphasized. Jaundice may first be noticed as a yellowing of the
sclera, especially in persons with darker skin types. Yellow discoloration can
also commonly be seen under the tongue.
Examination of the skin should document the jaundice and also look for
clues to its cause. The stigmata of alcohol abuse (eg, caput medusa, spider
veins) or IV drug use (needle track marks) should be noted. Large hematomas,
by themselves, could be a cause of jaundice as the blood resorbs. Signs of
bruising or bleeding should also be documented.
Abdominal examination must include, among other things, evaluation of
the general contour of the abdomen, the presence of any ascites, the presence
of organomegaly, and any tenderness. Hepatomegaly may or may not occur as
a part of liver disease. Right upper quadrant tenderness can be associated with
acute hepatitis but also with gallstone disease. Splenomegaly could suggest
portal hypertension from cirrhosis, could be caused by malignancy, or by
splenic sequestration of damaged RBCs.

Laboratory Testing
The most important initial laboratory evaluation of jaundice is the bilirubin
level, which is usually reported as both a total bilirubin and direct bilirubin.
The reported direct bilirubin is a measurement of the conjugated bilirubin
level. Unconjugated bilirubin can be determined by subtracting the directed
bilirubin from the total bilirubin.
The relative relationship of conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin in a jaundiced person can be indirectly evaluated by performing a urinalysis. Conjugated
bilirubin is excreted in the urine, whereas unconjugated bilirubin is not.
A urinalysis on a jaundice patient who has a high level of bilirubin suggests that
the patient has a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia; absence of bilirubin on the
urinalysis suggests that it is an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia.

UNCONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA
A mild unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia, usually identified as an incidental
finding when liver enzymes are tested for some other reason, is often caused
by Gilbert syndrome. Gilbert syndrome is a congenital reduction of conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. It occurs in approximately 5% of the population
and is of no health significance. Occasionally, the bilirubin level will increase

CLINICAL CASES

483

during times of illness and then recover to its baseline, slightly elevated level,
after the illness resolves. In a patient with mildly elevated unconjugated
bilirubinemia, otherwise normal liver enzymes and complete blood count
(CBC), and who is otherwise well, no further workup is indicated.
Hemolysis can cause an unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in proportion to
the amount of hemolysis that occurs. It is most often diagnosed by identification of anemia along with the presence of red cell fragments or abnormalities
(spherocytosis, thalassemias, sickle cell disease, malaria, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], and hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]). The management is to treat the cause of the hemolysis.

CONJUGATED HYPERBILIRUBINEMIA
Hepatitis A is a viral infection of the liver primarily transmitted via fecal-oral
contamination and accounts for 30% of acute viral hepatitis in the United
States. Contaminated food and water are the primary sources of infection,
although risks also include drug use (both injection and noninjection), malemale sexual contact, and working in a daycare setting. Hepatitis A infection
is widespread in Africa, Asia, and Central and South America. Travelers to
these areas are at risk for infection.
Hepatitis A causes a self-limited illness characterized by jaundice, fever,
malaise, and abdominal discomfort. The incubation period is 2 to 8 weeks and
transmission is possible for 2 to 3 weeks after symptoms begin. While the
symptoms can be mild, even asymptomatic in younger patients, there is an
approximately 2% fatality rate in those older than age 50 years. The illness
tends to last for 4 to 6 weeks, although some people have an illness that will
last up to 6 months. There is no specific treatment for hepatitis A. Supportive
care and symptomatic treatments are indicated.
Hepatitis A is diagnosed based on the presence of a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, elevated hepatic transaminases, and serology. An acute infection causes an elevation of antihepatitis A virus (HAV) IgM. An elevated
anti-HAV IgG but negative IgM indicates a history of a previous hepatitis A
infection but not acute illness.
Hepatitis A vaccination is available and recommended for those at high
risk, including travelers to endemic areas, persons with chronic liver disease,
men who have sex with men, or children who live in areas with high rates of
the illness. Household or sexual contacts of persons infected with hepatitis A
can be offered prophylaxis with injections of immunoglobulin.
Hepatitis B has infected 2 billion people worldwide and there are 350 million
chronic carriers. It is a viral infection transmitted via contact with contaminated blood or body fluids. Sexual contact and needle sharing are common
mechanisms of infection. Hepatitis B may also be vertically transmitted from
mother to baby. The incubation period from exposure to clinical symptoms is
6 weeks to 6 months. Only 50% of infections with hepatitis B are symptomatic. Approximately 1% of infections result in hepatic failure and death.

Briscoe DB. Lange Q&A: USMLE Step 3. 4th ed. New York, NY: McGraw-Hill; 2005:48.)

Along with the acute symptoms, which are similar to hepatitis A, hepatitis B
can cause a chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B is highly related to the
age of the patient—90% of infected infants, 60% of children younger than
age 5 years, and 10% to 15% infected adults develop chronic hepatitis B,
which can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B causes
up to 80% hepatocellular carcinoma worldwide.
Serologic studies, using several markers, are necessary to determine the
presence and type of hepatitis B infection that is present. Hepatitis B surface
antigen (HBsAg) is present in both acute and chronic infections. Its presence
is associated with contagiousness to others. Patients with the e antigen
(HBeAg) are 100 times more infectious than those lacking the HBeAg.
Antibody to the surface antigen (anti-HBs) is seen in resolved infections
and is the serologic marker produced after hepatitis B vaccination. An IgM
antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg IgM) is diagnostic of an
acute infection. A measurable level of HBsAg with a negative anti-HBcAg
IgM is diagnostic of chronic hepatitis B. Figures 46–1 and 46–2 show the serologic studies associated with acute hepatitis B infection and chronic hepatitis B
infection, respectively.
Acute hepatitis B infection is treated supportively. Persons with chronic
hepatitis B may be candidates for antiviral therapy. They should be referred to
a specialist both to evaluate the appropriateness of therapy and to monitor for
the development of hepatocellular carcinoma or cirrhosis.
Hepatitis B vaccination is universally recommended for children.
Vaccination is also recommended for adults at high risk of disease, including
health-care and public safety workers, IV drug users, persons with chronic
liver disease, and dialysis patients.

Hepatitis C, formerly known as non-A, non-B hepatitis, is the most common
cause of chronic liver disease in the United States, with more than 4 million
infected persons. Transmission occurs via exposure to infected blood or body
fluids via sexual contact, needle sharing, or accidental exposure of health-care
workers, and by vertical transmission. Blood or blood-product transfusion was
a common source of exposure prior to 1992.
The virus can be detected in the blood within 1 to 3 weeks of exposure, with
liver cell injury detectable in 4 to 12 weeks. Most infections are asymptomatic,
but hepatitis C can cause an acute illness with jaundice, malaise, and anorexia.
Of those infected with hepatitis C, 60% to 85% will develop a chronic infection, with measurable levels of hepatitis C virus RNA (HCV RNA) for more
than 6 months.
Chronic hepatitis C can lead to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma.
Disease activity can be monitored by serial measurements of HCV RNA
along with transaminases levels. Chronic hepatitis C can be treated with
antiviral therapy, using ribavirin and/or interferon, but results are variable and
there is no cure. Sometimes liver transplant is used as a last resort. There is
currently no vaccination available for hepatitis C.
Hepatitis D is a rare cause of viral hepatitis that uses the viral envelop of
Hepatitis B to infect its host and thus requires coinfection of Hepatitis B and D.
It is endemic in the Mediterreanean, Middle East, and South America. In coinfection 10% or less will become chronically infected. Interferon helps to treat
it and it can be prevented with a Hep B vaccine.
Hepatitis E is a fecal-orally transmitted viral hepatitis. It is rare in the United
States. but has a very high mortality rate in the second and third trimesters for
pregnant woman. Treatment is supportive and there is no immunization.

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Alcohol abuse can cause an acute, severe hepatitis, or chronic fatty liver,
hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Alcohol leads to a conjugated hyperbilirubinemia by
impairing bile acid secretion and uptake. Transaminase levels from alcohol
abuse typically show the aspartate aminotransferase (AST) being elevated
out of proportion to the alanine aminotransferase (ALT); viral hepatitis usually causes greater elevations of the ALT (see Case 41 for a more thorough discussion of alcohol abuse).
Physical obstructions of bile drainage can also cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Common etiologies include gallstones that become impacted
in the bile ducts, postoperative biliary strictures, or extrinsic compression of
the bile ducts by tumors, such as pancreatic cancer. Imaging of the bile system
with ultrasound, computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography) is usually
diagnostic. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be
diagnostic and, in some cases, therapeutic.

B. These serologies are consistent with resolved hepatitis B infection
and ongoing immunity; the anti-hepatitis B surface antigen antibodies indicates immunity. This patient has both negative surface and e
antigens, so is not at risk to spread the disease to others.

46.3

D. The patient probably has chronic hepatitis C that has progressed
to cirrhosis causing the edema, weight gain, and ascites. Both HCV
RNA and Anti-HCV antibodies are present in chronic Hep C. Hep
A does not proceed to cirrhosis and Anti-HBs is present in people
immunized to Hep B.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The acute onset of painless jaundice in a patient older than age 50 years
should prompt an examination for pancreatic cancer (malignancy in the
head of the pancreas causing compression of the bile ducts).
➤ All pregnant women should be screened for the presence of HBsAg. If positive, treating the newborns with hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and
vaccination can reduce the risk of vertical transmission.
➤ One of the greatest risks for the development of cirrhosis in those with
chronic hepatitis C is alcohol use. Anyone with chronic hepatitis C should
be counseled to avoid all alcohol intake.

Case 47
A 52-year-old man presents to the office with approximately 2 weeks of
upper abdominal pain. His symptoms are difficult for him to describe,
but include some “discomfort” in the epigastric region that comes and
goes. He has had some “heartburn” and nausea, but no vomiting or diarrhea. He has noticed that his stool looks darker than it used to, but he
has not seen any blood. He feels full quickly after eating. He tried taking some over-the-counter antacid, which helps a little bit. His only
other medication is an over-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug (NSAID) that he takes “once or twice” a day because of arthritis
in his knees. He does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. On examination, he is pale appearing, but in no acute discomfort. He is afebrile,
his blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg, his pulse is 95 beats/min, and his
respiratory rate is 14 breaths/min. Head, ears, eyes, nose, and throat
(HEENT) examination is notable only for pale conjunctiva. Cardiac
and pulmonary examinations are normal. His abdomen has normoactive
bowel sounds and tenderness in the epigastrium. There is no mass, rebound,
or guarding. Rectal examination reveals normal tone, no masses, and dark
black stool that is strongly fecal occult blood test (FOBT) positive. The
remainder of his examination is unremarkable.

ANSWERS TO CASE 47:
Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease
Summary: A 52-year-old man presents with vague upper abdominal discomfort, nausea, and early satiety. He is a daily NSAID user. He appears pale on
examination, suggesting that he may be anemic. He has mild abdominal tenderness and melanotic stool on examination.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Bleeding peptic ulcer.

➤

Evaluation and treatment at this point: A stat complete blood count
(CBC), discontinuation of his NSAID, upper GI endoscopy, and testing for
Helicobacter pylori. He should be treated with a proton pump inhibitor
(PPI) and antibiotics for H pylori, if tests confirm its presence. He may need
a blood transfusion (dependent on the result of his CBC). He will also
require evaluation with a colonoscopy.

➤

Reduce risk of recurrence by: Discontinuation and avoidance of NSAID
or, if unable to completely discontinue, use of PPI or misoprostol with the
NSAID; eradication of H pylori.

4.

Learn management of dyspepsia.
Learn the risk factors for the development of peptic ulcer disease (PUD).
Know how to diagnose and treat peptic ulcers.
Understand the role of H pylori in PUD, including methods for testing for
and treatment of PUD.
5. Know the “alarm symptoms” for which endoscopy is indicated.

Considerations
Dyspepsia is defined as chronic or recurrent upper abdominal pain or discomfort. Approximately 10% of dyspepsia is caused by peptic ulcer disease. Other
common causes include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and functional dyspepsia. The diagnostic workup and treatment of patients with dyspepsia varies and is dependent on the age of the patient, the presenting
symptoms and signs, and the response to the initial management offered.
Peptic ulcer disease is a problem of the gastrointestinal tract characterized
by mucosal damage secondary to pepsin and gastric acid secretion. It usually
occurs in the stomach and proximal duodenum; less commonly, it occurs in
the lower esophagus, the distal duodenum, or the jejunum, as in unopposed

hypersecretory states such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, in hiatal hernias
(Cameron ulcers), or in ectopic gastric mucosa (eg, in Meckel diverticulum).
Early diagnostic endoscopy should be considered for patients with newonset dyspepsia who are older than age 55 years or who have symptoms
that may be associated with upper GI malignancy (Table 47–1). For those
younger than age 55 years and without alarm symptoms, testing for H pylori,
either by urea breath test or stool antigen testing, is recommended. For those
who test positive, treating the H pylori followed by acid-suppression therapy is
indicated. For persons who test negative, empiric therapy with a PPI for 4 to
8 weeks is a cost-effective intervention. Endoscopy or reconsideration of the
diagnosis should be considered for those who continue to be symptomatic
following these interventions.

APPROACH TO
Dyspepsia and Peptic Ulcer Disease
DEFINITIONS
H2 BLOCKER: Class of medications that are competitive antagonists of histamine binding to gastric parietal cell H2 receptors, which prevents activation
of the pathway that mediates release of acid into the gastric lumen.
PROTON PUMP INHIBITOR (PPI): Class of medications that suppresses
gastric acid production by irreversibly inhibiting the H+ K+ ATPase proton
pump in gastric parietal cells.

CLINICAL APPROACH
PUD is a term generally used to describe both duodenal and gastric ulcers.
Duodenal ulcers are more prevalent overall, whereas gastric ulcers are
more common in NSAID users. Risk factors for the development of PUD
include H pylori infection, the use of an NSAID, cigarette smoking, and personal or family history of PUD. Black and Hispanic populations have a higher

likelihood of developing PUD as well. The lifetime risk of developing PUD in
the United States is approximately 10%. Table 47–2 summarizes other causes
of PUD.

History and Examination
Dyspepsia symptoms are common and there is significant overlap between the
symptoms of PUD, GERD, and functional dyspepsia. Patients with symptoms
primarily of heartburn or acid regurgitation are more likely to have GERD.
Classic symptoms associated with PUD include epigastric abdominal pain
that is improved with the ingestion of food, or pain that develops a few

hours after eating. Nocturnal symptoms are also common with PUD. The
symptoms are often gradual in onset and present for weeks or months. Patients
often self-medicate with over-the-counter antacid medications, which usually
provide some relief, prior to presenting to the physician.
The examination should both attempt to confirm your suspicion of PUD
and rule out other diagnoses that may present with abdominal pain. PUD
often will only have the examination finding of epigastric tenderness. The
presence of GI bleeding may be documented by stool occult blood testing;
however, the bleeding from PUD may be episodic and a negative single office
occult blood test does not completely rule out bleeding. Signs of anemia (pale
conjunctiva or skin, tachycardia, hypotension, orthostasis) should be evaluated and managed as needed.
Many potential diagnoses must be considered in your differential. Finding
right upper quadrant tenderness may suggest gallbladder or biliary disease.
Appendicitis, while classically causing right lower quadrant pain, may present
with only vague abdominal symptoms (especially with a retrocecal appendix).
Epigastric pain radiating to the back and associated with nausea and vomiting may be pancreatitis. Pelvic infections, pelvic pathology, and even ectopic
pregnancy must be considered as possibilities in women. Myocardial ischemia
should be considered in those at risk.

Helicobacter pylori
H pylori is a corkscrew-shaped gram-negative bacillus that is the causative
agent of most non–NSAID-related ulcers. H pylori is also associated with the
development of gastric cancer. The presence of the organism is associated
with a 5 to 7 times increased risk of the development of PUD. How H pylori
is transmitted is not entirely understood.
Several tests are available to diagnose infections with H pylori. Stool antigen testing is now the preferred non-invasive office test for H pylori, due
to its superior positive predictive value and ability to be used posttreatment
to test for eradication. However, for this test to be accurate, patients must not
have been treated with PPIs for at least 2 weeks prior to testing. Serologic testing for anti–H pylori antibodies is widely available, inexpensive, and noninvasive. It is highly sensitive for the presence of a history of infection but cannot
distinguish an active infection from a treated infection.
Active infection can be confirmed by urea breath testing. This test is performed by having the patient ingest a carbon-labeled urea compound, which
is then metabolized by urease from the H pylori organism. The labeled CO2
released by this process is measured in exhaled breath. This test is highly sensitive and specific, but is limited by availability and expense.
The gold standard for diagnosis is endoscopy with biopsy testing for
H pylori. The bacterium can either be visualized microscopically using a variety
of staining methods, cultured, or detected by rapid testing of the specimen.
Endoscopy also allows for direct visualization of ulcers and evaluation for the

494

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

presence of malignancy or other pathology in the esophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Endoscopy is invasive and expensive, limiting its utility to certain
clinical situations.

Complications of PUD
About 25% of patients with peptic ulcer disease have a serious complication
such as hemorrhage, perforation, or gastric outlet obstruction. Silent ulcers
and complications are more common in older patients and in patients taking
NSAIDs.
Upper gastrointestinal bleeding occurs in 15% to 20% of patients with
peptic ulcer disease. It is the most common cause of death and most common
indication for surgery in the disease. The risk of rebleeding and death is
increased based on age, comorbidities, and hemodynamic status.

Management of Suspected PUD
After the initial history and physical examination, focused testing appropriate to evaluate the suspected clinical syndromes should be ordered. A CBC
should be drawn to evaluate for anemia, even when stool studies are negative
for occult blood. A patient who has been vomiting or not eating should have
basic chemistry studies performed. Liver enzymes, amylase, and lipase tests
may be ordered when biliary or pancreatic disease is suspected. An ECG can
be done if cardiac disease is a consideration, and an upright chest x-ray is the
test of choice for possible abdominal organ perforation. Abdominal ultrasonography is indicated when gallstones are suspected. A pregnancy test
should be ordered on reproductive-age women, and cervical cultures performed if infection is suspected.
Patients with significant anemia, hemodynamic instability (hypotension,
tachycardia, orthostasis), or suspected acute abdomen should be hospitalized.
IV rehydration and blood transfusion should be performed when necessary.
Urgent surgical evaluation should be obtained if an acute abdomen is present.
Dyspepsia in patients younger than age 55 years with no alarm symptoms
can be managed with a noninvasive H pylori “test-and-treat” protocol. A test
for an active H pylori infection (stool antigen or serum IgA ELISA [enzymelinked immunosorbent assay] antibodies) should be performed. A negative
test rules out ulcer in dyspeptic patients. If positive, treatment to eradicate the
infection, along with a PPI to suppress acid production, should be prescribed
(Table 47–3 lists H pylori treatment regimens).
Generally PPI have greater efficacy in suppressing acid production and hastening ulcer healing than H2 blockers. Those with no evidence of active infection can be treated with acid suppression alone for 4–6 weeks. If symptoms resolve,
no further testing is indicated. Along with treatment, offending agents, such as
NSAIDs and tobacco, should be discontinued.

Patients older than age 55 years or with alarm symptoms should be referred
for upper GI endoscopy to exclude the possibility of malignancy. Endoscopy is
preferred over radiologic procedures because of better visualization and because
of the ability to perform biopsy. Endoscopy also can be therapeutic, if a source
of bleeding can be identified and cauterized. A patient who is older than age
50 years and who has blood in the stool should also undergo a colonoscopy
regardless of the upper endoscopic findings, to ensure that there is not a
colon cancer also contributing to the GI blood loss.
Surgical treatment for PUD is rarely needed. However it may be warranted
for cases of hemorrhage that cannot be controlled, perforation, or obstruction.

Comprehension Questions
47.1

A 30-year-old woman with no known medical problems comes to you
for advice. She attended a health fair where she tested positive for
H pylori on a blood test. She has had no abdominal discomfort, nausea,
vomiting, or diarrhea. Her stool has been negative for blood. She
occasionally has to use over-the-counter antacids after eating spicy
foods. Which of the following would you tell her about the result of
this test?
A. She may or may not have an H pylori infection.
B. She probably has a peptic ulcer.
C. She has an H pylori infection but may or may not have an ulcer.
D. She should be treated immediately for H pylori.

47.2

A 62-year-old man presents to clinic with increasing shortness of
breath and fatigue. Cardiac examination is negative and lungs are
clear to auscultation bilaterally. No jaundice, JVD, or peripheral
edema is noted. Mucous membranes are pink with no evidence of
cyanosis and capillary refill is good. CBC reveals a microcytic anemia
and a gastric ulcer is diagnosed on upper GI endoscopy. A biopsy and
testing confirm an H pylori infection. His last colonoscopy was 2 years
ago and was normal. Which of the following further testing is indicated at this time?
A. Upper GI radiographic series with small bowel follow through
B. Abdominal ultrasound
C. Colonoscopy
D. Urea breath test

47.3

A 41-year-old man presents for evaluation of upper GI discomfort that
he has had for about 2 months. He says that he has a “full” sensation
in the epigastric region. He recently began smoking after increased
stress at work. He has had no blood in his stool, no vomiting, and no
dysphagia. He has lost about 10 lb but does not exercise. His mother
has hemorrhoids but no family member has ever had colon cancer. He has
never had a colonoscopy. Which of the following is most appropriate?
A. H pylori “test and treat”
B. Empiric therapy for H pylori
C. FOBT with reassurance if negative
D. Referral for endoscopy

CLINICAL CASES

47.4

497

A 19-year-old woman arrives at the emergency room with a 15-hour
history of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. She was awoken
early in morning by severe abdominal pain. She does admit to drinking heavily the prior evening that is not unusual during the weekends.
She does not use NSAIDs regularly. Her blood pressure is 100/60 mm Hg
and her pulse rate is 130 beats/min, respirations are 14 breaths/min, her
temperature is 39°C. Acute abdominal series upon admission displayed
substantial amount of free air under the right hemidiaphragm. Which
of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Perforated peptic ulcer
B. Alcohol-related gastritis
C. Appendicitis
D. Gastroenteritis
E. Kidney stones

ANSWERS
47.1

A. H pylori blood tests are testing for anti–H pylori antibodies. They
cannot distinguish active infections from old infections nor can they
diagnose the presence of ulcers. Treating a positive serum test in an
asymptomatic person is not indicated.

47.2

C. The presence of blood in the stool or anemia in a patient older
than age 50 years, even when an ulcer is found, is an indication for
colonoscopy, as this may also represent a presentation of a concomitant colon cancer. An urea breath test may be beneficial after completion of treatment to confirm eradication of the infection.

47.3

D. This patient presents with the alarm symptom of weight loss. He
should be referred for early endoscopy.

47.4

A. The acute abdomen and free air under the diaphram indicates a
perforated viscus. This patient has perforated ulcer with hemodynamic instability. Additional workup includes a chemistry panel,
CBC, and urgent laparotomy.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Persons who require long-term NSAID therapy may benefit from testing
for active H pylori infection, followed by eradication, if positive, as this may
lower their risk of developing an ulcer. PPI therapy, along with the NSAID,
can also lower the risk.
➤ Commonly held beliefs, such as ulcers being caused by stress or spicy
foods, are incorrect. The vast majority of ulcers are caused by H pylori and
NSAIDs.

Case 48
An 18-month-old girl is brought to the office by her mother for an acute
visit because of a rash. She had a subjective high fever for the past
3 days, along with some mild respiratory symptoms. She was given acetaminophen for the fever but no other medications. The fever has gone
down in the past day, but today she developed a rash. The rash came up
suddenly, starting on the trunk and spreading to the extremities. The
child has no significant medical history and no known sick contacts,
although she attends day care 3 days a week. On examination, she is
mildly fussy but easily consolable in her mother’s lap. She has a noticeable erythematous rash of small macules and papules that blanch on palpation. The remainder of her examination is normal.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Be able to identify common rashes associated with viral infections in children.
2. Know the appropriate management of febrile illness associated with rashes
in children.

Considerations
This toddler has a history of fever, and rash that is diffuse, erythematous
papules. This is most likely due to roseola, caused by human herpes virus
6 (HHV-6). HHV-6 is a ubiquitous virus that infects most children before
the age of 3 years, although most infections are asymptomatic. The virus has
an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks and causes a prodromal illness associated
with mild respiratory symptoms and a high fever.

APPROACH TO
Fever and Rash
DEFINITIONS
ENANTHEM: An eruption on a mucous membrane as a symptom of a disease.
EXANTHEM: An eruption on the skin as a symptom of a disease.

CLINICAL CASES

501

CLINICAL APPROACH
Febrile illness and rashes are extremely common presentations in family medicine and pediatric offices. Most of the time these presentations represent
mild, self-limited illnesses that require no specific therapy. However, some of
these presentations will represent serious infections that need urgent intervention. Rashes associated with fever may be caused by viruses, bacteria,
spirochetes, drug reaction, or autoimmune diseases. The patient history
should attempt to identify any exposures that may cause these syndromes.
Specific information that may be helpful include the duration of the illness,
other associated symptoms, contact with any other ill person, history of recent
travel, use of medications, or exposure to animals and insects (eg, ticks).
A review of immunization status is critical, as many vaccine preventable diseases
can cause fever and rash. Immunization does not guarantee immunity but
may result in a less-severe presentation of the disease.
A thorough physical examination with a complete skin examination
should be performed. Examination findings can both lead to a specific diagnosis and identify complications of the causative agent. For example, the presence of exudative pharyngitis along with fever and rash may suggest scarlet
fever caused by a group A Streptococcus infection while an abnormal lung
examination in a patient with crops of vesicles of different ages may lead to a
diagnosis of varicella (chicken pox) complicated by pneumonitis.
The ability to accurately describe skin lesions is necessary for documentation purposes. It is also important when you are not certain what the diagnosis is. Knowing the definitions of macules, papules, pustules, and the like will
make it much easier and more accurate when you look for information in a
textbook or journal or discuss a case with a colleague or consultant. The better
the information that you can provide, the more likely you are to get correct
information in return. See Case 13 for definitions of many of the terms used to
describe common skin lesions.

COMMON VIRAL INFECTIONS
Roseola
Human herpes virus 6 is a ubiquitous virus that infects most children before
the age of 3 years, although most infections are asymptomatic. The virus has
an incubation period of 1 to 2 weeks and causes a prodromal illness associated
with mild respiratory symptoms and a high fever that can range from 101 to
106°F (37.9-41.1°C).This prodromal illness tends not to last for longer than
5 days. Following defervescence, a characteristic rash appears suddenly. It is
an erythematous maculopapular eruption that starts on the trunk and spreads
rapidly to the extremities, with sparing of the face. The rash tends to disappear
in 1 to 2 days. The diagnosis is primarily clinical, based on the history and

502

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

examination. Because of the short-lived nature of the disease, no treatment is
usually required other than reassurance.

Varicella
The varicella zoster virus is a highly contagious virus that causes two clinical
syndromes. Chicken pox is the more common childhood infection. A typical
case of chicken pox includes a fever and a rash, which tends to develop in
clusters. The initial exanthem is often papules or vesicles on an erythematous base, described as “dewdrops on a rose petal.” The vesicles then progress
to shallow, crusted erosions. Patients may also develop enanthems, with
lesions on the oral, nasal, or gastrointestinal mucosa. In rare cases, serious
complications may develop, which include encephalitis, meningitis, and
pneumonitis. Super-infection of the vesicles with bacteria, most commonly
group A Streptococcus and Staphylococcus aureus, is a particularly common and
potentially dangerous complication. The diagnosis of varicella is usually clinical, but may be confirmed with Tzanck smear or identification of the virus by
DNA PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Antiviral therapy using acyclovir,
valacyclovir, or famciclovir may shorten the course of the illness in patients
older than 2 years of age if started within 24 hours of onset of the exanthem.
Varicella vaccination is now universally recommended at age 12 to 18 months
with a booster dose at age 4 to 6 years. While the vaccine has significantly
reduced the incidence of childhood chicken pox, breakthrough infections can
occur in vaccinated individuals. However, these infections are usually much
less severe, with fewer vesicles and little to no fever. The varicella vaccine is
a live, attenuated virus and should not be given to immunocompromised or
pregnant patients.
Shingles, or herpes zoster, is a reactivation of the varicella virus, which
can remain dormant in a dorsal root ganglion following the initial infection.
The reactivated virus causes a vesicular eruption, usually along a single dermatome that does not cross the midline. The reaction can occur at any age,
but is more common in the elderly or immunosuppressed. The rash can be
extremely painful and can result in a painful, postherpetic neuralgia that lasts
long after resolution of the rash. Antiviral therapy started within 72 hours of
the rash may reduce the incidence of the postherpetic neuralgia. A herpes
zoster vaccine is now recommended for people over 60.

Erythema Infectiosum
Parvovirus B19 causes a characteristic syndrome known as erythema infectiosum or fifth disease. This virus tends to infect children younger than 10 years
of age and occurs most commonly in the winter or spring. The child usually
has a prodrome of mild fever and upper respiratory symptoms before outbreak
of the rash. The rash usually starts as confluent erythematous macules on the

CLINICAL CASES

503

face, which usually spares the nose and periorbital regions. This gives the
classic “slapped cheek” appearance that is commonly diagnostic of the infection. The facial rash lasts for 2 to 4 days, followed by a lacy, pruritic exanthem
on the trunk and extremities that usually lasts for 1 to 2 weeks, but can have
a relapsing course for several months. Parvovirus B19 in adults and older adolescents tends to cause a more severe illness, with rheumatic complaints such
as arthritis. In patients with sickle cell disease, parvovirus B19 infection can
lead to an aplastic crisis with anemia and leukopenia. The virus can also be
transmitted from mother to fetus during pregnancy, resulting in fetal hydrops
and pregnancy loss.

COMMON BACTERIAL INFECTIONS
Group A β-Hemolytic Streptococcus
Group A β-hemolytic Streptococcus (GAS) is associated with numerous diseases,
particularly in children. It is the causative agent of streptococcal pharyngitis and
its complications, which include rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis. It can
also cause impetigo and cellulitis of the skin.
The rash of scarlet fever usually starts about 2 days after the onset of sore
throat. The rash consists of punctate, raised, erythematous eruptions that can
become confluent and feel like sandpaper. The rash tends to start on the
upper trunk and spreads to the rest of the trunk and the extremities. The
exanthem can also be associated with an enanthem, causing the appearance
of a “strawberry tongue.” The rash fades and desquamation occurs 4 to 5 days
after the first appearance of the rash.
GAS infections can be confirmed by rapid antigen testing or culture
from a throat swab. The first-line treatment for GAS infections is penicillin, with cephalosporins or macrolides as alternatives in the penicillinallergic patient.

Neisseria Meningitidis
N Meningitidis (meningococcus) can cause an acute, life-threatening infection, often associated with a rash. Meningococcemia causes a severe illness
with high fevers, hypotension, and altered mental status. Most people with
meningococcemia progress to develop frank meningitis, with its associated
signs of meningeal irritation. The rash of meningococcemia often starts as
an erythematous maculopapular eruption that progresses to form petechiae.
The petechiae may coalesce into purpura in a condition known as purpura fulminans that can result in gangrene and amputation of limbs. Other complications include disseminated intravenous coagulation (DIC), adrenal hemorrhage,
deafness, and cerebral and renal infarctions.

Someone with suspected meningococcemia should be immediately hospitalized, usually in the intensive care unit. The ABCs (Airway, Breathing, and
Circulation) should be urgently evaluated, blood and cerebrospinal fluid cultures collected, and empiric antibiotic therapy instituted until an organism is
grown out and drug sensitivities are obtained. A common empiric regimen for
presumed meningitis in infants less than 30 days old is ampicillin plus gentamicin while for adults vancomycin plus ceftriaxone may be used. Antibiotic
coverage can be later narrowed based on culture results. The first choice for
proven meningococcal meningitis is penicillin G. A meningococcal vaccine
is now recommended for routine childhood immunization and also should be
offered to patients at risk for the disease (asplenic, those living in dormitories
or military barracks). Close contacts of someone with meningococcal infection should be offered prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin or rifampin.

TICK-BORNE DISEASES
Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever
Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is an acute, life-threatening infection
caused by the organism Rickettsia rickettsii, which is transmitted via various
species of tick. The infection occurs more often in the summer months, when
people are more likely to be outdoors. Despite its name, RMSF is most common in the southeastern United States. The illness causes acute fever, headache,
myalgias, and fatigue. The classic exanthem is a macular, papular, or petechial
eruption that starts on the wrists and ankles and includes the palms and soles.
Laboratory tests often show a low white blood cell count, low platelet count,
hyponatremia, and elevated liver enzymes. The diagnosis is confirmed with
serology, but this is not helpful in the acute setting. Due to its severity, a high
suspicion for RMSF should be maintained and likely cases of the illness treated
empirically with doxycycline.

Lyme Disease
Lyme disease is endemic in many areas of the United States, including New
England and the mid-Atlantic regions. The causative spirochete, Borrelia
burgdorferi, is transmitted via the bite of ticks of the Ixodes species. Because
the tick is very small, infected persons are often unaware of a history of a tick
bite. The characteristic rash, erythema migrans, develops 3 to 30 days following infection. The exanthema is typically an expanding erythematous
macule with central clearing, often described as appearing like a “bull’s-eye.”
Early dissemination of the disease can present as multiple secondary erythema
migrans, Bell’s palsy, aseptic meningitis, and carditis and rarely as complete
heart block. Late disease is most characteristically marked by arthritis. The
treatment of choice for Lyme disease is doxycycline and the diagnosis can be
confirmed with serologic studies. Table 48-1 provides a summary of some of
the most common causes of the presentation of rash and fever in children.

ANSWERS
48.1

B. This question describes erythema infectiosum, or fifth disease, which
is caused by parvovirus B19. It often has a prodrome of fever and
upper respiratory systems mistaken by the mother in this question as
a “cold.” This child also has the classic “slapped cheek” rash of erythema infectiosum and, while the child does need to be caught up on
his immunizations, the child has the classic symptoms of fifth disease
and not of the diseases for which children are immunized.

48.2

A. The child has chicken pox caused by the Varicella-Zoster virus.
While the child did received two doses of the varicella vaccine and the
vaccine is effective, sporadic breakthrough cases do occur. However, the
cases are usually much less severe and have fewer complications than
in unimmunized patients.

48.3

D. The patient has meningitis and meningococcemia caused by
N meningitidis. The patient is severely affected and is in septic shock.
All people in close contact with the patient should receive ciprofloxacin
or rifampin prophylaxis.

48.4

E. The patient has Rocky Mountain spotted fever. The disease is
commonly found in North Carolina and is carried by ticks that the boy
could have picked up during the camping trip. RMSF has a characteristic rash that starts on the wrists and ankle and can eventually involve
the palms and soles. Typically, the rash of RMSF spreads centripetally
from the wrists and ankles to involve the trunk and extremities.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Shingles that approaches the eye, because of a reactivation involving the
trigeminal nerve, should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist. A clue that
the eye may become involved is seeing characteristic lesions approaching
the tip of the nose.
➤ Many vaccine-preventable illnesses, including measles, rubella, and varicella, have characteristic rashes associated with them. Always get a vaccination history on children presenting with fever and rash. Also, consider
the possibility that immigrants from other countries may not be vaccinated if they present with similar symptoms.

Case 49
A 32-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a lump that she noticed
in her right breast on self-examination. She says that she does not examine herself often, but that she thinks that this lump is new. She has not
had any nipple discharge and has no breast pain, although the lump is
mildly tender on palpation. She has never noticed any masses before
and has never had a mammogram. She has no history of breast diseases
and has never had a biopsy. There is no history of breast cancer in the
family. She takes oral contraceptive pills regularly, but no other medications. She does not smoke cigarettes or drink alcohol. She has never
been pregnant. On examination, she is a well-appearing, but somewhat
anxious, thin woman. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Her general physical examination is normal. Examination of her breasts reveals
no skin dimpling or retraction and no nipple discharge. In the lower
outer quadrant of the right breast there is a 2-cm, firm, well-circumscribed,
movable mass that is mildly tender. No other masses are felt, but the
breast tissue is noted to be firm and glandular throughout. No axillary,
supraclavicular, or cervical lymphadenopathy is appreciated.

ANSWERS TO CASE 49:
Breast Diseases
Summary: A 32-year-old woman presents for evaluation of a lump in her right
breast that she found on breast self-examination (BSE). The lump is found to
be 2 cm in size, firm, and mobile. No adenopathy is noted.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Breast cyst.

➤

Next step in evaluation: Needle aspiration of cyst.

➤

Follow-up: If aspiration of the cyst results in complete resolution of the
mass, and if the fluid is clear/yellow, follow-up clinical examination in 1 to
2 months to ensure no recurrence; if aspiration does not make the mass
disappear, if the fluid is bloody, or if the lesion recurs, further evaluation
with biopsy of the lesion is indicated.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn how to workup a breast mass.
2. Know the risk factors for breast cancer.
3. Know how to manage benign breast diseases.

Considerations
A palpable breast mass is a potentially frightening finding for a woman. The
media has widely disseminated the statistic that 1 in 8 women will have breast
cancer in their lifetime. Consequently, the evaluation of the breast mass is
designed to answer the one question that is on the patient’s mind, whether
she says it or not: Is this lump breast cancer? Fortunately, most palpable breast
masses are not cancerous. Unfortunately, a definitive determination of whether
a lesion is benign or malignant cannot be made by history and physical examination findings only.
Certain factors have been identified as increasing a woman’s risk of breast
cancer. A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (parent, sibling), especially if the cancer occurred in a premenopausal woman and was
bilateral, is associated with an increased risk. Early age at menarche (<12 years),
late age of menopause (>55 years), and nulliparity or first live birth after the
age of 30 years are also associated with higher risks. The use of hormones,
either estrogen alone or combined with progesterone, are considered to confer higher risks, although recent studies question whether oral contraceptives
pose any significant risk. Lifestyle considerations, including obesity, physical

CLINICAL CASES

513

inactivity, and alcohol use (>3 drinks per day), also are identified risk factors.
Finally, a history of previous breast disease, especially biopsies showing atypical hyperplasia, carcinoma in situ, or prior breast cancer, are associated with
increased risks.
In the case presented, there are several pieces of information presented
that lead toward a likelihood of a benign process. Breast cancer can occur at
any age, but approximately 70% of breast cancers occur in women older than
age 50 years. You can never overlook the possibility of malignancy in a
woman who is in her thirties, but the possibility of cancer is lower in her than
in an older woman. The characteristics of the lesion are also more consistent
with a benign, probably cystic, process. It is described as well-circumscribed,
firm, mobile, tender, and with no overlying skin changes. Lesions that are
hard, fixed in place, nontender, have indistinct borders, or have overlying
skin dimpling/retraction are more suggestive of cancer. Nevertheless, no individual characteristic on examination is diagnostic and an appropriate evaluation is necessary.

APPROACH TO
Diseases of the Breast
DEFINITIONS
ACROMEGALY: A condition that results from the excessive production of

growth hormone by a pituitary adenoma. Among the numerous physical
effects of the excessive growth hormone, menstrual irregularities and breast
discharge may result.
DUCT ECTASIA: Inflammation of a mammary duct below the nipple, which
can lead to duct obstruction, a tender mass, and duct discharge.
INTRADUCTAL PAPILLOMA: A benign tumor growth into a mammary
duct, often with a resultant palpable small mass and duct discharge.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Palpable Breast Mass
Following a complete history, with an emphasis on factors that may confer an
increased risk of cancer, a careful examination of both breasts should be performed. The breast examination should include a visual inspection for skin
changes, dimpling, retraction, and asymmetry, and should note the presence
and quality of any nipple discharge (color, presence of blood, etc).
Examination by palpation should be performed in a systematic manner to
include all quadrants of the breast, as well as the superficial, intermediate, and

514

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

deep breast tissue. Specific characteristics of any palpable lumps, including
size, location, tenderness, mobility, firmness, and distinction of the mass from
the surrounding tissue, should be noted, both to assist in developing a diagnosis and to allow for serial examinations to determine if the mass is changing. The breast examination should also include palpation of the axilla and
supraclavicular regions to identify the presence of enlarged lymph nodes. The
characteristic of the mass and the age of the women will provide initial clue
into likely diagnosis (see Table 49–1).
The identification of a new breast solid mass particularly in women older
than 35 years should prompt triple assessment, which includes a clinical
breast examination, imaging (mammography), and pathology assessment
either by core biopsy or surgical excision.
For women younger than 35 years of age, suspected lesions characteristic of
fibroadenoma or fibrocystic changes can be assessed by ultrasonography, rarely
mammography followed by fine-needle aspiration with histological evaluation. Ultrasonography can be used as an adjunct to mammography in an
effort to determine if the lesion is solid or fluid filled. It can also be used in
women with denser breast or women with persistent breast pain without evidence of mass by mammography.
Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) can be both diagnostic and therapeutic.
A FNA that identifies fluid that is clear, yellow, or green-tinged and that results
in complete resolution of a mass is diagnostic of a benign cyst. In this setting,
the fluid can be discarded and no further workup is necessary. The patient
should be seen in follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks for reexamination to evaluate for
recurrence of the lesion.
If the mass does not completely resolve, if the fluid withdrawn is bloody, if
no fluid is aspirated, if the lesion is found to recur on follow-up, or has complex nature (containing cystic and solid components), then further evaluation

is indicated by stereotactic core-needle or excisional biopsy. Several biopsy
techniques are used in practice. FNA can be performed on solid lesions; however it should be used for lesions most likely to be cystic. It is the least invasive and simplest procedure, but also has the highest risk of false-negative or
nondiagnostic results. Core-needle biopsy and mammotome biopsy use larger
cutting needles to obtain larger tissue samples. These are usually performed
using ultrasound or mammographic guidance by a radiologist or surgeon.
These procedures have a higher chance of providing a diagnostic sample but
are more invasive and costlier than FNA. Although surgical excision is the
most invasive and expensive diagnostic method, it is indicated in stereotactic
biopsies showing atypical ductal hyperplasia and is also therapeutic by
removing the lesion in question.

Breast Pain
Breast pain (mastalgia) is the most frequent breast-related complaint for
which women present for evaluation. The etiology of chronic mastalgia is
often unknown. As with the presentation of a breast lump, the patient’s primary fear, whether spoken or unspoken, is whether the pain is a manifestation
of breast cancer. As such, the evaluation should include a history to evaluate
for high breast cancer risk status, a careful breast examination, and a screening mammography in women for whom it is routinely indicated. Any abnormalities found in the primary evaluation should be workedup as appropriate.
Breast pain is not a common presentation of breast cancer, particularly
when it is bilateral breast pain.
Most breast pain may be categorized as cyclic mastalgia, noncyclic mastalgia, or nonmammary pain. Cyclic mastalgia is usually diffuse, bilateral often
radiating to axilla and arm and related to the woman’s menstrual cycle. Pain
occurs during late luteal phase and resolves with onset of menses. In some
cases, it can be unilateral. Noncyclic mastalgia may be continuous or intermittent, but is not associated with the menstrual cycle. It is more commonly
unilateral and more prevalent in postmenopausal women. Nonmammary
pain is breast pain secondary to another etiology. This is often chest wall pain
but, sometimes, the underlying cause may be difficult to determine.

Common Causes of Mastalgia
Etiology of most mastalgia unknown. Common causes of mastalgia are:
• Pregnancy
• Mastitis
• Thrombophlebitis
• Cyst
• Benign tumors
• Cancer
• Musculoskeletal cause

Hidradenitis suppurativa
Medications such as OCPs, antidepressants, antipsychotics, antihypertensive, and others

Laboratory testing is usually unnecessary in the evaluation of mastalgia,
although a pregnancy test should be performed in reproductive-age women.
Hormonal contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy may be causes of
breast pain and consideration should be given to discontinuation or reduction
of estrogen dosages. An appropriately fitted supportive bra and lifestyle changes,
such as tobacco cessation, and stress reduction techniques, are often successful
in alleviating symptoms. Evening primrose oil, caffeine reduction, and vitamins
have not been shown to provide much relief. Topical NSAIDs have shown the
most promise. For women with unrelenting pain in spite of the above modifications, danazol, an antigonadotropin, is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
approved for the treatment of breast pain, but is relatively expensive and has
numerous side effects (hair loss, acne, weight gain, and irregular menses).

Nipple Discharge and Galactorrhea
Nipple discharge is usually caused by a benign process. Up to 25% of women
will have this symptom during their life. Nipple discharge that occurs only
with nipple stimulation, that is clear, yellow, or green, and that appears from
multiple ducts is usually physiologic. This discharge often goes away if efforts
are made to reduce nipple stimulation (including ceasing efforts to check to
see if the discharge will still occur).
Discharge that is spontaneous, persistent, bloody, from a single duct,
and associated with a mass is more likely to represent a pathologic process.
In this setting, the most common causes are intraductal papillomas, duct ectasia, cancers, and infections. If the discharge is not obviously bloody, a fecal
occult blood test card can be used to test for occult blood.
Following the initial history and physical examination, mammography
should be performed in all women with a spontaneous or bloody discharge,
and in any woman in whom routine mammographic evaluation is indicated.
Palpable breast masses should be appropriately evaluated. The treatment of
most unilateral, spontaneous, or bloody nipple discharges is surgical excision of the terminal duct involved. This both resolves the problem and
allows for pathologic diagnosis of the problem.
Galactorrhea is a discharge of milk or a milk-like secretion from the breast
in the absence of parturition or beyond 6 months postpartum in a non–breastfeeding woman. The secretion may be a milky or serous (yellow) appearing,
intermittent or persistent, scant or abundant, free-flowing or expressible, and
unilateral or bilateral. If the clinician is unsure if the discharge is galactorrhea,

CLINICAL CASES

517

the discharge can be sent off for staining and microscopic analysis. Galactorrhea
will contain few cells and will have fat globules. The condition is more common
in women who are 20 to 35 years of age and in previously pregnant women.
Galactorrhea is associated with stress, physical irritation, numerous medications, hypothyroidism, chronic renal failure, hypothalamic-pituitary disorders, hormone-secreting neoplasms (most commonly pituitary adenomas), or
may be idiopathic but is not associated with breast cancer.
Numerous pharmacologic agents are causes of galactorrhea. These agents
can block dopamine and histamine receptors, deplete dopamine stores, inhibit
dopamine release, and stimulate lactotrophs. Common medications and classes
of medications associated with galactorrhea include: SSRIs, TCAs, atenolol,
verapamil, antipsychotics, H2 histamine blockers (cimetidine), and opiates, to
name a few. Estrogen in oral contraceptives can cause galactorrhea by suppressing the hypothalamic secretion of prolactin inhibitory factor and by direct
stimulation of the pituitary lactotrophs.
Offending medications should be discontinued, if possible. Prolactin and
thyroid-stimulating hormone levels should be drawn to evaluate for endocrine
abnormalities. Assessing electrolytes and renal function can assess for renal
failure, Cushing disease, and acromegaly. Imaging of the pituitary to evaluate
for a pituitary adenoma with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is indicated
if the prolactin level is significantly elevated.
Treatment is geared at addressing the underlying condition, that is, hypothyroidism should be treated with hormone replacement. It is also geared toward
severity of the prolactin level and pending fertility status.
Dopamine agonists are the treatment of choice in most patients with
hyperprolactinemic disorders. Bromocriptine is the preferred agent for treatment of hyperprolactin-induced anovulatory infertility. Surgical resection
rarely is required for prolactinomas.

49.2

A 52-year-old woman has a palpable breast lump. An attempt at FNA
does not result in aspiration of fluid. A mammogram is read as normal.
Her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer at age 45. She does not
smoke but socially drinks alcohol. She currently uses low-dose estrogen contraception pills and takes 1200 mg of calcium daily. She began
her menstrual periods at age 10 and she had her first child at age 24.
Which of the following is the appropriate next step?
A. Repeat clinical examination in 4 to 6 weeks.
B. Repeat mammogram routinely in 1 year.
C. Referral for biopsy.
D. Discontinuation of her hormone replacement therapy.

49.3

A 29-year-old woman comes in to the clinic with complaints of leftsided nipple discharge. On further questioning she states that the discharge is milky in color. She is a G2P2 with the last birth 31/2 years
ago. She breast-fed both children for 9 months. She is on no medications and is having regular menstrual periods. You express a small
amount of nonbloody milky discharge from several ducts from the left
nipple and are unable to express discharge from the right. Which of
the following is the best diagnostic step?
A. Send for diagnostic mammogram. If negative, reassure that the discharge is not significant.
B. Refer to a breast specialist for evaluation for unilateral nipple discharge.
C. Obtain TSH, free T4, and prolactin levels.
D. Obtain levels of FSH, LH, and GnRH.

ANSWERS
49.1

C. Nipple discharges that are spontaneous, unilateral, persistent,
bloody, and associated with a mass are more likely to represent pathologic processes. Most of these are still benign (eg, papilloma, duct
ectasia), but evaluation and surgical intervention are usually required.

49.2

C. A biopsy is the next appropriate step in this setting. A negative
mammogram is not diagnostic of a benign process and does not rule
out the possibility of having a breast cancer. A tissue diagnosis is
needed in this setting especially with a known first-degree relative
with breast cancer and early age of menarche.

CLINICAL CASES

49.3

519

C. The evaluation and management of most cases of galactorrhea can be
handled by the primary care physician. If pituitary adenoma is diagnosed
then the patient can be referred for specialty care. Milky discharge,
galactorrhea, from multiple ducts in the nonlactating breast may occur
in certain syndromes—it is usually due to an increased secretion of
pituitary prolactin. A pregnancy test should be the first evaluation.
Hypothyroidism can also cause hyperprolactinemia. Psychiatric agents
such as chlorpromazine and estrogen containing agents such as the
oral contraceptive pills may also cause milky discharge.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Approximately 1% of breast cancer occurs in men. A new palpable mass in
a man’s breast should prompt a diagnostic evaluation.
➤ Remember that the question in the mind of just about every woman presenting with a breast-related complaint is, “Do I have breast cancer?” The
job of the physician is to both manage the presenting complaint and to
answer this question.

Case 50
A 28-year-old nulliparous woman presents for evaluation of irregular menstrual cycles for the past year. Her periods come only every 2 or 3 months
and she has gone as long as 4 months without a period. Currently, she
gives a last menstrual period of 11 weeks ago. She says she had menarche
at age 13 years and that her cycles have been “mostly” regular, usually
occurring every 30 days, but she would miss a cycle several times a year.
She has never been on hormonal contraception. She does not smoke,
does not drink alcohol, and does not exercise. She is sexually active with
a single partner and uses condoms for contraception. On review of systems, she reports a 30-lb weight gain in the past 18 months, but otherwise
has felt fine. On examination, she is noted to be obese, with a body mass
index of 30. Her vital signs are otherwise normal. She has fine hair growth
on her face and a velvety thickening of the skin on her neck. Her general
physical examination is normal. A pelvic examination reveals normal
external genitalia, no vaginal or cervical discharge, no cervical motion
tenderness, and no uterine or adnexal masses.

ANSWERS TO CASE 50:
Menstrual Cycle Irregularity
Summary: A 28-year-old woman presents for evaluation of irregular menstrual
cycles for the past year. She is obese and noted to have gained 30 lb. She is
found to be hirsute and to have acanthosis nigricans. Her pelvic examination
is normal.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Anovulatory menstrual cycles secondary to polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)

➤

Initial laboratory test: Pregnancy test

➤

Treatment to regulate cycle: Oral contraceptive pills

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn some of the common causes of irregular menstrual cycles.
2. Develop an understanding of a rational workup of menstrual cycle abnormalities.
3. Learn the management of common menstrual cycle disorders.

Considerations
Menstrual cycles are considered normal if they occur at regular intervals of
21 to 35 days in length. During their reproductive years, most women will, at
some point, have late or missed menstrual cycles. When this occurs on a rare
occasion and pregnancy is ruled out, watchful waiting is usually indicated,
with resumption of normal menstrual cycles almost always occurring.
The differential diagnosis of persistent menstrual cycle irregularities is
broad. Pregnancy must be ruled out in any menstrual pattern change. After
pregnancy is excluded, numerous neuroendocrine and genitourinary conditions must be considered.
In a normal (highly simplified) menstrual cycle, the hypothalamus secretes
GnRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH. As the
FSH level rises, it causes an ovarian follicle to mature and it to release estrogen which induces endometrial proliferation. A mid-cycle LH surge causes
ovulation, and the follicle is transformed into the corpus luteum that secretes
progesterone, which compacts and matures the endometrium. If pregnancy
does not occur, the production of progesterone abruptly decreases, resulting in
sloughing of the endometrium and a menstrual bleed.

CLINICAL CASES

523

In the case presented of an obese, hirsute woman with ongoing weight gain
and irregular menses, PCOS should be the initial consideration (after pregnancy). PCOS is a syndrome of insulin resistance and androgen excess. It is
associated with infertility, hirsutism, acne, obesity, and metabolic syndrome.
Diagnosis is made by having two of the three factors: hyperandrogenism,
chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries on ultrasound. Anovulation is the
menstrual cycle irregularity associated with PCOS. Without ovulation, there
is a failure of luteal production of progesterone, resulting in an absence of normal menstruation. Hyperandrogenemia can be tested for by measuring serum
total testosterone and sex hormone binding protein and calculating the free
serum testosterone. Women with PCOS can have induced menstrual bleeds by
providing periodic supplemental progesterone or by using oral contraceptive
pills. Weight loss is very important to increase fertility; even a loss of 2% to 5%
can greatly increases rates of success. The insulin resistance in PCOS is treated
with metformin and thiazolidinediones. PCOS caused infertility is treated with
clomiphene citrate, aromatase inhibitors, and gonadotropins.

APPROACH TO
Menstrual Cycle Irregularity
DEFINITIONS
AMENORRHEA: Absence of menstrual bleeding for 6 or more months when
a woman is not pregnant.
MENOMETRORRHAGIA: Heavy menstrual flow or prolonged duration of
flow occurring at irregular intervals.
MENORRHAGIA: Excessive menstrual flow, or prolonged duration of flow
(>7 days), occurring at regular intervals.
METRORRHAGIA: Bleeding occurring at irregular intervals.

CLINICAL APPROACH
A thorough history is the initial component of the evaluation of menstrual
irregularities. The history of presenting complaint should examine both the
specific abnormality that is occurring and when it was first noted. A menstrual calendar can be very valuable in this setting. Associated symptoms,
including weight gain or loss, galactorrhea, heat or cold intolerance, and
other forms of bleeding should be documented. A complete general health
history is necessary. A complete reproductive health history, including age at
menarche, history of any previous menstrual cycle abnormalities, medications
(especially anticoagulants, phenytoin, antipsychotics, TCAs, and steroids),
contraception, infections, surgeries, and sexual practices along with pregnancies

524

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

and their outcomes is required. A social history focusing on stressors, substance use, exercise, eating habits, and sexual activity can provide important
information.
The general physical examination should attempt to identify medical conditions that can cause menstrual abnormalities. Extremes of body mass index—
both overweight and underweight—can affect menstruation. Hirsutism or
acne suggests androgen excess. The thyroid should be examined for size, consistency, and the presence of nodules. Skin and hair changes may also occur
with thyroid conditions. Breasts should be examined for galactorrhea.
Unexplained bruising or easy bleeding may occur with coagulopathies.
The pelvic examination is a critical component. In women having excessive or unusual bleeding, initial efforts should be made to determine whether
the blood is coming from the uterus or another anatomic site. Urethral, rectal, vaginal wall, or cervical bleeding can easily be mistaken for menstrual
abnormality. Signs of infection should be noted and cultures collected, as cervicitis may predispose to cervical bleeding. A Papanicolaou (Pap) smear
should be performed. Bimanual examination should note the size and consistency of the uterus, the presence of any masses or tenderness. The adnexa
should also be carefully examined for abnormality.

Abnormal Bleeding Associated with Regular Menstrual
Cycles
Menorrhagia with regular intervals between bleeding is suggestive that regular
ovulation is occurring. This implies that the endocrine pathways are functioning
normally and that the problem may be anatomic within the genital or hematologic system. Leiomyomata (fibroids), especially those that are submucosal in the
uterus, are a common cause of this problem. They create an increased endometrial surface area with a resultant increase in menstrual bleeding. Endometrial
polyps may cause menorrhagia by a similar mechanism. Coagulopathy that is
inherited (most commonly von Willebrand disease) or due to medications
(eg, warfarin) is a common cause. Also, liver disease or thrombocytopenia may
contribute.
Reduced volume of menstrual bleeding associated with regular ovulation is
a less common occurrence. Asherman syndrome is a scarring within the uterine cavity caused by trauma from uterine curettage. It can result in reduction
in the size of the uterus as the walls become scarred to each other. This may
cause minimal or even absent menstruation in the face of normal hormonal
function. A scarred and obstructed cervical os can cause a similar picture.

Abnormal Bleeding Associated with Irregular Menstrual
Cycles
Bleeding that is unpredictable in terms of timing and flow is known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) and generally implies an abnormality

CLINICAL CASES

within the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. This pattern is common
shortly after menarche and as a woman approaches menopause. At other
times, it signals anovulation. In this setting, the endometrium is continuously
stimulated by estrogen and sloughs off irregularly. Chronic anovulation should
be evaluated with prolactin and LH serum levels.
Continuous estrogen stimulation can also lead to endometrial hyperplasia
and endometrial carcinoma. Risk factors for endometrial carcinoma include
a history of anovulatory menstrual cycles, obesity, nulliparity, older than
age 35 years, the use of tamoxifen, or of unopposed exogenous estrogen.
The evaluation of a woman with DUB is dependent on age and risk factors.
In the period after menarche, watchful waiting is usually indicated, with correction of the problem usually occurring within 1 to 2 years. In women younger than
35 years who are not at increased risk of endometrial cancer, treatment may be
offered without workup beyond the history and physical examination.
Further evaluation is indicated for women with risk factors for endometrial
cancer, women younger than age 35 years with continued symptoms in spite of
treatment, and postmenopausal women with uterine bleeding. The workup
involved typically includes imaging of the pelvic organs with an ultrasound and
an endometrial biopsy. Transvaginal pelvic ultrasound provides information on
uterine size and masses, and can assess the thickness of the endometrium, which
correlates with the risk of hyperplasia. An endometrial biopsy can be performed
quickly and easily in the office setting, using a thin, disposable, sampling device.
The combination of sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness and
endometrial biopsy is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of endometrial cancer.
Hysteroscopy (endoscopic evaluation of the uterine cavity) can directly visualize endometrial masses, polyps, or other abnormalities, and can lead to
directed biopsy. It is often performed with dilation and curettage (D&C),
which sharply removes almost the entire endometrial lining for diagnostic and
therapeutic purposes.
When the workup does not reveal malignancy, anovulatory bleeding is usually responsive to treatment with either combined estrogen and progestin oral
contraceptives (OCPs) or progestin alone. A progestin can be given for 7 to
10 days with a subsequent withdrawal bleed expected to occur within a week
following the completion of the course. Both of these regimens reduce the risk
of developing endometrial hyperplasia and carcinoma. When medical treatments fail, or when symptoms are severe, surgical options may be required.
Hysterectomy provides definitive treatment and is necessary in the case of a
malignancy. Endometrial ablative procedures are also available and widely used.

Comprehension Questions
50.1

A 42-year-old obese G2P2 woman presents for evaluation of irregular
menstrual bleeding for a year. She has had painless vaginal bleeding in
various amounts at various times of the month. She has a history of
smoking half a pack of cigarettes per year for 10 years. She has two children, is on no medications, and has no significant medical history. She
had been taking the oral contraceptive agent for 5 years during her teen
years. Her examination reveals her uterus to be slightly enlarged, but
without masses or tenderness. The remainder of her examination is
normal. A pregnancy test is negative. Which of the following is the
most significant risk factor for her having endometrial cancer?
A. Smoking
B. Parity
C. Body habitus
D. History of oral contraceptive use

50.2

A 35-year-old woman has had irregular periods since high school. She

following is the most probable diagnosis?
A. Uterine leiomyoma
B. Cervical carcinoma
C. Endometritis
D. Endometrial cancer

CLINICAL CASES

527

ANSWERS
50.1

C. This patient’s obesity is the most significant risk factor for endometrial cancer. Parity is protective for endometrial cancer. Risk factors for
endometrial cancer include anovulatory menstrual cycles, obesity,
nulliparity, age greater than 35 years, and use of tamoxifen or unopposed exogenous estrogen. Interestingly smoking is a negative risk
factor for endometrial cancer.

50.2

A. Estrogen does not have a role in the initial workup for anovulation; serum karyotype is useful for premature ovarian failure but not
for anvoluation. Urine cortisol may help in the diagnosis of Cushing’s
disease, but not generally indicated unless the patient has other stigmata of corticosteroid excess such as abdominal striae, easy brusability,
and buffalo hump. TSH is indicated in DUB workup. Both total
serum testosterone levels and prolactin are useful. Thus, in general, a
pregnancy test, TSH and prolactin level are the initial tests for the
evaluation of menstrual irregularities.

50.3

C. Endometritis is a common cause of vaginal spotting. It is generally
a polymicrobial infection caused by an ascending infection of normal vaginal flora. Commonly isolated organisms include gonorrhea,
Chlamydia, Ureaplasma urealyticum, peptostreptococcus, Gardnerella
vaginalis, and the group B Streptococcus species. The patient’s history
makes cervical cancer less likely. Leiomyoma or polyps are possible,
but less likely with her history of recent spotting and sexual activity.
Endometrial cancer would also be unlikely in a patient with previously regular menses. The diagnosis of endometritis can be confirmed
with endometrial biopsy showing inflammatory cells, in particular
plasma cells.

Clinical Pearls
➤ The first test performed on a woman with menstrual cycle irregularities
should be a pregnancy test.
➤ A history of anovulatory cycles does not confer absolute protection
against pregnancy. Ovulation may occur intermittently and irregularly. If
the woman does not want to become pregnant, she should be counseled
on contraceptive options.

Case 51
A 30-year-old woman presents to your office with the chief complaint of
a “yeast infection that I can’t seem to shake.” She also has noticed that
she has been urinating more frequently, but thinks that it is related to her
yeast infection. Over the last several years she has noticed that she has
gained more than 40 lb. She has tried numerous diets, most recently a
low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet. The patient’s only other pertinent history is that she was told to watch her diet during pregnancy because of
excessive weight gain. Her baby had to be delivered by cesarean because
he weighed more than 9 lb. Her family history is not known, as she was
adopted. On physical examination, her blood pressure is 138/88 mm Hg,
her pulse is 72 beats/min, and her respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min. Her
height is 65 in and her weight is 190 lb (body mass index [BMI] = 31.6).
Her physical examination reveals darkened skin that appears to be thickened on the back of her neck and moist, reddened skin beneath her
breasts. Her pelvic examination reveals a thick, white, vaginal discharge.
A wet preparation from the vaginal discharge reveals branching hyphae
consistent with Candida. A urine dipstick is performed that is negative
for leukocyte esterase, nitrites, protein, and glucose.

Significant physical findings: Obesity, acanthosis nigricans, blood pressure
that is elevated for a diabetic (goal is <135/85 mm Hg), candidal vaginitis,
and possibly candidal skin infection under her breasts.

➤

Diagnostic studies: Blood glucose measurement (random sugar can be
checked in the office with a fingerstick sample); follow-up testing should
include electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, fasting lipids,
urine microalbumin: creatinine ratio, and hemoglobin AIc.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Know the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus, including, signs and
symptoms, physical findings, and diagnostic studies.
2. Know the pathophysiologic and epidemiologic differences between type 1
and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
3. Learn the treatment options for diabetic patients.
4. Be aware of the acute emergencies that can occur to diabetics and how to
manage them.

Considerations
Diabetes mellitus is one of the most common medical problems encountered
in medical practice. There are an estimated 23.6 million (~8%) diabetics in
the United States and the number is increasing both in the United States and
worldwide. Diabetes affects all ethnic groups, but there is a disproportionate
burden of disease in African Americans, Native Americans, and Hispanics.
The global epidemic of obesity has led to a dramatic increase in the number
of type 2 diabetics presenting with disease in their teens and twenties.
The complications of diabetes are myriad. Diabetics are 6 to 10 times
more likely than nondiabetics to be hospitalized for cardiovascular disease
and 15 times more likely to be hospitalized for peripheral vascular diseases.

CLINICAL CASES

531

It is the leading cause of blindness in working-age adults in the United States,
most of which is preventable. It is also the leading cause for end-stage renal
disease and nontraumatic amputations. In 2007, the direct and indirect cost
related to diabetes mellitus was estimated to be $174 billion dollars.
Other complications that may be less well known to patients but that are
attributable to diabetes include neuropathic, gastrointestinal, and immunologic changes. Peripheral neuropathy, leading to reduced sensation or pain,
can lead to the development of ulcerations, infections, or injuries of the
extremities. Gastroparesis can be a difficult-to-manage problem that makes
diabetes more difficult to manage by impairing the patient’s ability to eat
properly. Immunologic changes make diabetics more prone to opportunistic
infections, such as fungal skin or genitourinary infections.
Impaired glucose tolerance or frank diabetes may be present for years prior
to the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. In the case presented, the history of excessive weight gain during pregnancy with a large baby and cautions on watching
her diet may be a sign of a history of gestational diabetes. Women with gestational diabetes have an increased risk of developing nongestational diabetes.
As in the case presented, difficult-to-treat or recurrent fungal infections
may be the initial presentation that leads to the diagnosis of diabetes. This
patient has both vaginal and skin infections. Although, in this case, the diagnosis is diabetes, other immune deficiency states must be considered when
recurrent fungal infections are found. In the appropriate setting, HIV or other
immunosuppressive conditions must be considered.
The symptom of polyuria should also lead to an increased suspicion for diabetes. High serum glucose levels function as an osmotic diuretic, resulting in frequent urination. This is often associated with polydipsia, a state of extreme thirst.
Patients with type 1 diabetes also may present with polyphagia. Their lack of
insulin prevents their food intake from being appropriately metabolized, resulting in a state of hunger for which they will frequently eat but not feel sated.
The absence of glucose in the urine dipstick does not exclude the diagnosis and should not delay a blood glucose measurement. Glucosuria occurs
when the blood glucose level is greater than a renal “threshold” level, above
which the glucose will spill into the urine. The lack of glucosuria only shows
that the blood sugar level is not above this threshold level. Overt signs of
insulin resistance (acanthosis nigricans, elevated blood pressure, obesity) also
make the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes more likely.
General approach to managing diabetes is geared at secondary prevention
of macrovascular (accelerated coronary artery disease, accelerated cerebral and
peripheral vascular disease) and microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy and
neuropathy) complications. Overall diabetic patient should be “controlled”:
(1) glycemic control with a goal of hemoglobin A1c of 6.5% or less, (2) LDL 70
to 100, (3) BP less than 130/80 mm Hg, and (4) life style modifications including a diet consisting of low carbohydrates and low saturated fat and physical
activity counseling (at least 150 min/wk of moderate-intensity aerobic physical
activity [50%-70% maximum heart rate] and resistance training [3 times/wk]).

APPROACH TO
Diabetes Mellitus
DEFINITIONS
DCCT: Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, a large, prospective, randomized controlled study of the advantages and disadvantages of “tight” versus “loose” diabetic control in type 1 diabetes.
UKPDS: United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study, a large, prospective,
randomized controlled study of interventions and outcomes in type 2 diabetes.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Diabetes mellitus is a general term for several different diseases that result in
high blood sugar levels and that eventually lead to microvascular and macrovascular complications. The major classifications of diabetes mellitus are type 1
diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes.

Type 1 diabetes
Type 1 diabetes (previously called juvenile diabetes, juvenile-onset diabetes
mellitus [JODM], or insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [IDDM]) results
from destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic β cells. The pathogenesis of
type 1 diabetes mellitus is mediated by multiple risk factors that include viral
infections, genetic susceptibility, and environmental risks.
Because of the lack of insulin, which is required for the metabolism of glucose, type 1 diabetics are prone to metabolize fats, with the resultant production of ketones. An extreme result of this process is diabetic ketoacidosis, a
syndrome characterized by hyperglycemia, high levels of serum acetone, and an
anion gap metabolic acidosis. This often occurs during times of physical stress,
such as an infection or myocardial infarction, or when the patient does not use
his or her insulin. Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency, requiring hospitalization, careful insulin management, correction of acidosis and electrolyte
disturbances, and evaluation for the underlying cause of the condition.

Type 2 diabetes
Type 2 diabetes (previously called adult onset diabetes mellitus [AODM],
non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus [NIDDM]) patients, in contrast to
type 1 diabetics, in whom there is a lack of insulin, are typically hyperinsulinemic. Their disease results primarily from insulin resistance in the peripheral tissue and this resistance is often related to obesity. Type 2 diabetics often
manifest signs of insulin resistance for many years prior to the diagnosis of

CLINICAL CASES

533

overt diabetes. This type accounts for at least 90% of the diagnosed cases, and
virtually all undiagnosed diabetes, in the United States.
Type 2 diabetes has a stronger familial predisposition than type 1. Type 2
diabetics often have a family history of the disease. The genetic factors are
multifactorial and have not been identified. It is strongly associated with obesity and its complications: metabolic syndrome, hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, and central obesity.
Uncontrolled type 2 diabetics can achieve extremely high blood sugars
without developing ketosis and acidosis. This type is more prone to hyperosmolar states because of the high blood sugar levels. Nonketotic hyperosmolar syndrome occurs when blood sugar levels become highly elevated, often
approaching 1000 mg/dL. This may be the presenting symptom of type 2 diabetes, or may result from a concurrent illness or failure to take medications.
The serum osmolarity is elevated and the patient has a large fluid deficit. In
severe cases, coma or death can occur. This can be managed with hospitalization, rehydration, treatment of underlying illnesses, and, sometimes, the judicious use of insulin to overcome the acute glucose toxicity.

Gestational diabetes
Gestational diabetes occurs in 3% to 10% of all pregnancies. Typically, women
have 50% more insulin in their third trimester. Gestational diabetes is triggered by
increased insulin resistance caused by elevated chorionic somatomammotropin,
progesterone, and estrogens all of which act as insulin antagonist. Maternal and
fetal complications are numerous. Maternal complications are hyperglycemia,
DKA, increased UTI risk, increased pregnancy induced hypertension/preeclampsia,
and retinopathy. Fetal effects are congenital malformations, macrosomia, respiratory distress syndrome, hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypocalcemia, polycythemia, and hydramnios. Women with gestational diabetes are more prone to
develop non–pregnancy-related type 2 diabetes and should be screened with a
glucose tolerance test postpartum.
Risk factors for gestational diabetes include age older than 25 years, member of a high-incidence racial group (Native American, African American,
Hispanic American, South or East Asian, Pacific Islander), body mass index
of 25 or more, history of glucose intolerance, previous history of gestational
diabetes, and history of diabetes in a first-degree family member.
The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends
screening all women for gestational diabetes. A 50-g 1-hour glucose challenge
test (GCT) is administered to all pregnant women at 26 to 28 weeks, followed
by a 100-g, 3-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) for those with an
abnormal screening result. If 1-hour glucose challenge is greater than 140
then 100-g 3-hour glucose challenge is needed. Diagnosis is made based on
greater than two abnormal results. Gestational diabetes is treated with careful
diet management via patient education and nutritional counseling and when
necessary, insulin.

534

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

DIAGNOSIS
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes are:
1. A random glucose 200 mg/dL or more along with classic symptoms that
include polydipsia, polyuria, polyphagia, frequent infections, and weight loss
2. A fasting glucose more than 125 mg/dL on at least two occasions
3. A 2-hour plasma glucose 200 mg/dL or more after a 75-g glucose load
Glycosylated hemoglobin or hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is not recommended for
diagnosis. This test is used to estimate the average glucose over the past 3 months
in those who are diagnosed with diabetes. Measurement of C-peptide and insulin
levels can be used to distinguish type 2 from type 1 diabetes when the history,
physical examination, and other tests, such as serum ketones and osmolality, are
not enough. Other tests recommended by the American Diabetes Association
are fasting lipid profiles (at the time of diagnosis and, at least, annually thereafter), serum creatinine, urinalysis, urine microalbumin:creatinine ratios (at time
of diagnosis in type 2 diabetics and annually thereafter; in type 1 diabetics who
have had disease for 5 years and annually thereafter), annual dilated eye examinations, regular foot examinations, ECG (in adults), and, in type 1 diabetics,
thyroid disease screening with a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).

MANAGEMENT
The treatment for type 1 diabetes involves the use of insulin. In most cases,
combination therapy using short-acting insulin prior to meals and an intermediateor long-acting basal insulin is used. Insulin pump therapy, which provides a continuous subcutaneous infusion of short-acting insulin, is an alternative. Insulin
management requires careful and frequent self-monitoring of glucose, often with
adjustment of insulin dosage based on the glucose levels, amount of physical
activity, and caloric/carbohydrate intake (see Table 51-1).
Type 2 diabetics and those at risk of developing diabetes should be educated
on the importance of diet and exercise as key components of their management. In some cases, that will be all that is needed to achieve appropriate control. An initial goal that is achievable by many is a 10% weight loss. When
lifestyle changes alone do not result in adequate control, numerous oral agents
are available. For severely obese patients, surgical gastric bypass may be considered, although long-term risk and benefits have not been fully explored.
Medications for prevention are currently not recommended but can be
considered if lifestyle modification is unsuccessful. Several mediations are
available for treating type 2 diabetes (Table 51–2 ). Metformin is the drug of
choice to begin with unless contraindications are present.
Biguanides (metformin) act on the liver to decrease glucose output during gluconeogenesis. Secondary actions include improved insulin sensitivity
in the liver and muscle and a hypothesized decrease in intestinal absorption

of glucose. Metformin can lower the HbA1c by 1.5% to 2%. The UKPDS
showed a significant reduction in cardiovascular events, diabetes-related
deaths, and all causes of mortality in those who used metformin. Other advantages include no potential hypoglycemia, reduced insulin levels, a potential
weight loss, and a reduction in triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein
(LDL) cholesterol. The efficacy, safety, and improved outcomes make it a
popular first-line agent in type 2 diabetes
The most common side effects are gastrointestinal, such as nausea and
diarrhea. These side effects are reduced by starting with lower doses and giving the medication with meals. The more dangerous side effect is the development of lactic acidosis. The risk of this potentially fatal side effect is
increased by renal insufficiency. Metformin use is contraindicated in those
with a creatinine more than 1.5 mg/dL in men and more than 1.4 mg/dL in
women, hepatic insufficiency, or congestive heart failure. It is Category B in
pregnancy and probably safe in nursing mothers. It is the oral agent of choice
in type 2 diabetes in children older than age 10 years.
Sulfonylureas were the first oral agents available for type 2 diabetes. Their
principal action is to function as insulin secretagogues that stimulate β cells in
the pancreas to secrete insulin. Advantages include a potential 2% reduction in
HbA1c, once- or twice-a-day dosing, and relatively low cost. Disadvantages are
poor response in 20% of patients, a tendency of the users to gain weight, and a
tendency for the medications to lose effectiveness over time. As insulin secretagogues, sulfonylureas carry a risk of causing hypoglycemia.

diabetes: a consensus algorithm of initiation and adjustment of therapy. Diabetic Care. 2008;31(12):1-11.

Sulfonylureas and insulin are considered the best validated second-line
add-on therapy. The following medications are less well validated. Further
studies are necessary to determine how these agents may play a role in the
overall care of type 2 diabetics.
The principal action of thiazolidinediones (TZDs) is improving insulin
sensitivity in muscle and adipose tissue. Secondary actions are decreased
hepatic gluconeogenesis and increased peripheral glucose utilization. Among
their advantages is a decrease in triglyceride and increase in high-density
lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Because they are metabolized in the
liver, they can be used in patients with renal impairment. They also do not,
when used by themselves, cause hypoglycemia. Disadvantages include a slight
increase in LDL cholesterol, weight gain, and a slow onset of action. These
agents may take up to 12 weeks to fully become effective. They cause water

538

retention, which is of concern with renal compromise and congestive heart
failure. There is some current controversy on whether the benefits of this class
of medications outweigh the risks.
Meglitinides are short-acting secretagogues that increase insulin secretion
from the pancreas. These medications are taken no more than 1 hour before
meals because of the rapid onset and short duration of action. They are useful
in patients whose blood sugars vary at mealtime but who have controlled fasting glucose levels. They reduce HbA1c levels from 0.5% to 2%. The disadvantages include a risk of hypoglycemia (especially if the medication is taken
but no meal is then eaten) and expense. They should not be used in patients
with hepatic dysfunction.
α-Glucosidase inhibitors delay carbohydrate absorption by inhibiting
α-glucosidase in the small intestine, which decreases postprandial hyperglycemia.
They reduce HbA1c levels by 0.7% to 1.0%. This class of medication may offer
benefits to patients with erratic eating habits, as hypoglycemia will not occur if
meals are skipped. The principal side effects are GI, including flatulence. These
medications are contraindicated in ketoacidosis and in hepatic disorders.
Pramlintide is an amylinomimetic agent that has physiologic actions
equivalent to those of human amylin (glucoregulatory hormone synthesized
by pancreatic β cells and released with insulin in response to a meal). It
inhibits inappropriately high glucagon secretion during episodes of hyperglycemia (eg, after a meal) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus
and does not impair normal glucagon response to hypoglycemia. It is a subcutaneous medication that does not require adjustments for renal or hepatic
impairment. It reduces HbA1c levels by 0.5% to 1.0%. Known side effects are
hypoglycemia and nausea and diarrhea. Often dosing requires titration to balance hypoglycemia and preprandial glycemic control.
GLP-1 Agonist (glucagon-like peptide-1 mimetic). Exenatide (Byetta) is
an incretin mimetic which belongs to this class. It is a synthetic peptide that
stimulates insulin release. Adjunctive therapy for type 2 diabetics with inadequate glycemic control while on either metformin, sulfonylurea, and/or thiazolidinedione (glitazone). It reduces HbA1c levels by 0.5% to 1.0%. Side
effects include hypoglycemia when added to sulfonylurea (but not when
added to metformin), nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and acute pancreatitis.
DPP-4 Inhibitor (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor). Sitagliptin (Januvia)
inhibits dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4), an enzyme that inactivates incretin
hormones glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic
polypeptide (GIP). GIP and GLP-1 stimulate insulin synthesis and release from
pancreatic β cells in a glucose-dependent manner. GLP-1 also decreases
glucagon secretion from pancreatic α cells in a glucose-dependent manner,
leading to reduced hepatic glucose production. Used as monotherapy and as an
adjunct to diet and exercise for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in
patients whose hyperglycemia cannot be controlled by diet and exercise alone.
Used in combination with metformin, a sulfonylurea, or a thiazolidinedione as

CLINICAL CASES

539

second-line therapy for management of type 2 diabetes mellitus in patients who
do not achieve adequate glycemic control with diet, exercise, and metformin,
sulfonylurea, or thiazolidinedione monotherapy. It reduces HbA1c levels by
0.5% to 0.8%. The principal side effects are upper respiratory symptoms and
severe hypersensitivity (ie, anaphylaxis and/or angioedema).
The goal of diabetic management is to safely lower the blood sugar so as to
reduce the risk of macrovascular and microvascular complications. Both the
UKPDS and DCCT showed lower rates of complications in controlled diabetes. The goal of treatment is to achieve a HbA1c of less than 7%, although
some authorities are now advocating 6.5% as a goal. Goal fasting blood sugar
is less than 120 mg/dL and 2-hour postprandial sugar is less than 140 mg/dL.
Other treatments are equally important to tight glucose control in the
effort to reduce adverse events, such as heart attacks and strokes. The UKPDS
clearly showed that tight blood pressure control is effective in reducing cardiovascular events. The blood pressure goal in diabetes is less than 135/85 mm Hg.
Diabetes is considered a coronary heart disease risk equivalent for decisions regarding lipid management. The goal LDL cholesterol level is less than
100 mg/dL. All diabetics should be advised to be immunized with the pneumococcal vaccine and to get annual influenza vaccination.

MANAGEMENT OF HYPOGLYCEMIA
Hypoglycemic symptoms are related to the brain and the sympathetic nervous
system. Decreased levels of glucose lead to deficient cerebral glucose availability that can manifest as confusion, difficulty with concentration, irritability, hallucinations, focal impairments (eg, hemiplegia), and eventually, coma
and death. Stimulation of the sympatho-adrenal nervous system leads to
sweating, palpitations, tremulousness, anxiety, and hunger.
Causes of hypoglycemia include fasting, exogenous insulin, autoimmunity, sulfonylurea abuse, hormonal deficiency (hypoadrenalism, hypopituitary, glucagon
deficiency).
When hypoglycemia is suspected and the patient is conscious and cooperative, juice, soda, candy, or some other sugar-containing product can rapidly
alleviate the symptoms. If the person is not able to take something by mouth,
rapid administration of IM glucagon can be effective. In a hospital setting, or
when IV access is available, an injection of 50% dextrose (D50) rapidly corrects the problem. Following any of these therapies, the patient should be
closely watched, as the hypoglycemia may recur (especially if the patient uses
a long-acting insulin or oral hypoglycemic agent).

A 38-year-old G1P0 woman who is a new patient presents to the office
at 10-week gestation. She is known to have type 2 diabetes. She currently takes metformin and her last HbA1c was 10.4%. Her urine dip is
negative for ketones, protein, and leukocytes. She has no other medical problems and does not drink or smoke. On physical examination
she is 5 in 4 ft and weighs 202 lb. She inquires about the risk to her
fetus. As compared to gestational diabetes, this patient is at increased
risk for which of the following?
A. Fetal malformations
B. Fetal macrosomia
C. Polyhydramnios
D. Shoulder dystocia

ANSWERS
51.1

C. Diabetes mellitus can be defined by two separate measurements of
a fasting glucose more than 125 mg/dL; a random glucose of 200 mg/dL
or more with classic symptoms or a 2-hour glucose tolerance test of
200 mg/dL or more after a 75-g glucose load. HbA1c should not be used
in diagnosing diabetes.

51.2

B. This is a typical presentation of diabetic ketoacidosis, a medical
emergency. This is a common initial presentation of type 1 diabetes.
This child requires immediate hospitalization, IV fluids, and insulin.

51.3

A. Biguanides (metformin) are effective medications for the treatment of type 2 diabetes; they do not cause hypoglycemia when given
as monotherapy. Insulin and insulin secretagogues carry a risk of
hypoglycemia as a complication of therapy.

51.4

A. Gestational diabetes is more likely to lead to fetal macrosomia and
polyhydramnios. Both gestational and pregestational diabetes are
associated with shoulder dystocia. Pregestational diabetes is associated with greater fetal malformations due to the higher serum glucose
levels during organogenesis (5-10 weeks gestational age), whereas gestational diabetes tends to be associated with hyperglycemia after
20 weeks gestation, when the fetal organs have already formed. Preterm
labor occurs at same frequency in diabetics as nondiabetics.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Diabetes is one of the most common diseases in clinical practice. The criteria
for diagnosis have been lowered to decrease complications,including death.
➤ Type 2 diabetes accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes in the United
States. The increasing presence of obesity is, unfortunately, driving the incidence of type 2 diabetes even higher.
➤ Biguanides are gaining favor in the treatment of type 2 diabetes because
of their potency and demonstrated reduction in morbidity and mortality.

A 74-year-old African-American woman enters your office with the
complaint that she has been developing bruises all over her extremities
for the last several days. She also has noticed that her stool seems to be
a lot darker. She describes it looking almost like coffee grounds. She
relocated to your area to live with her daughter after her home in
Galveston was destroyed several months ago. This is her initial visit to
your office, as she had refills available for all of her medications and previously felt fine. Her past medical history is notable for being hypertensive, postmenopausal, having an irregular heartbeat that she doesn’t
remember the exact name for, and having a touch of diabetes and arthritis.
Her prescribed medications are hydrochlorothiazide and warfarin. Her
over-the-counter medications include aspirin which she started taking
since moving to your city, a multivitamin, acetaminophen for her arthritis and ibuprofen for when her knees really bother her. She also admits
to regularly drinking herbal teas.

ANSWERS TO CASE 52:
Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions
Summary: A 74-year-old woman presents with easy bruising and dark stools
for several days. She is new to your practice, but is on an antihypertensive
medication and a blood thinner. She is also taking numerous over-thecounter medications.
➤

Differential diagnosis: Includes an adverse drug interaction involving her
warfarin and the aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
and acetaminophen that she is currently taking. Other (much less likely)
possibilities include bleeding from a gastrointestinal malignancy, liver disease,
or hematologic abnormality (acute leukemia or severe thrombocytopenia).

➤

Necessary diagnostic studies: This patient should have a test for stool
occult blood in the office, a stat complete blood count (CBC), a prothrombin time (PT) with international normalized ratio (INR), a metabolic
panel, and an ECG. It would be appropriate to consider this patient for
observation status in the hospital while her studies are pending.

➤

Reasons for increased risk of drug reactions in the elderly: Numerous
issues, including polypharmacy, changes in renal and hepatic function, and
pharmacodynamic considerations (change in body composition and volume
of distribution) that develop with aging.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Understand the scope and risk of the problem of drug interactions and
adverse effects.
2. Learn some mechanisms to reduce these risks.
3. Know why the elderly are particularly vulnerable to potential complications.

Considerations
The extensive use of medications—including prescribed, over-the-counter,
herbal, and homeopathic products—makes adverse drug reactions and interactions a significant public health concern. About one in three older persons
taking at least five medications will experience an adverse drug event each
year and about two-thirds of these patients will require medical attention.
A Harvard study revealed that 6.5% of hospital inpatients experienced a documented injury secondary to medications. Because of physiologic changes
and the use of multiple medications for multiple medical conditions, the elderly

CLINICAL CASES

545

are at increased risk. An estimated 3% to 11% of hospital admissions in the
elderly are related to adverse drug reactions.
The patient presented has numerous risks for the development of serious
problems related to her medications. As noted before, her age alone is a risk.
The use of warfarin is another, as its use should be closely monitored. Having
been on this medication while not under the care of a physician, after leaving
Galveston and prior to establishing care, is a danger in itself. Warfarin also has
numerous drug-drug interactions, among them are an increased risk of bleeding with the concomitant use of aspirin, NSAIDs, or acetaminophen.
Because of her age, the presence of bruising (suggesting an increased PT from
her medications), and the possibility of rectal bleeding, she should have a fecal
occult blood test (FOBT) done and she should be screened for anemia with a
CBC. She should also have a PT with INR to evaluate her degree of anticoagulation and risk for ongoing hemorrhage. Because of her age and comorbid conditions, she should also have a metabolic panel to evaluate her glucose,
electrolytes, and renal and liver functions, and an ECG to evaluate for signs of
ischemia. With the possibility of significant abnormalities on these tests that may
require urgent management, it would be reasonable to place her in observation
status in the hospital for monitoring and treatment. Eventually, although probably not necessary in the acute setting, she would require a colonoscopy to ensure
that there is not an underlying colorectal cancer contributing to her bleeding.
If she is found to have a prolonged PT, several therapeutic options are
available, depending on the clinical situation and the magnitude of the
abnormality. For mildly over-anticoagulated patients with no evidence of
bleeding, temporary discontinuation of warfarin or dose reduction is often all
that is needed. For more prolonged prothrombin times, vitamin K orally along
with stopping the warfarin, can correct most abnormalities within a few days.
When the PT is very high, or if there is evidence of bleeding, intravenous
vitamin K and replacement of coagulation factors with a transfusion of freshfrozen plasma will rapidly reverse the coagulopathy.

APPROACH TO
Adverse Drug Reactions and Interactions
DEFINITION
CYTOCHROME P450 (CYP): An enzyme system found mostly in the liver (but

also in the small intestine, lungs, and kidneys) that is composed of more than
50 isoenzymes, and which is responsible for the metabolism of numerous medications. The CYP isoenzymes can be induced, resulting in increased drug
metabolism and reduced therapeutic benefit of a medication, or blocked,
resulting in decreased drug metabolism and potential for drug toxicity.

546

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

CLINICAL APPROACH
Etiologies of Adverse Drug Effects
Side effects are defined as effects from drugs that are beyond their intended
therapeutic scope. These effects may be either adverse or beneficial. Adverse
side effects can range from minor nuisances, such as nausea or diarrhea, to
severe or life-threatening, such as cardiac arrhythmias precipitated by antiarrhythmic or stimulant medications. Other side effects have been found that
are beneficial. For example, peripheral α-adrenergic blockers, initially used as
antihypertensives, were found to alleviate obstructive symptoms from prostatic hyperplasia and are now widely used for this purpose. Another example is
minoxidil, also an antihypertensive agent, which was found by some users to
result in hair growth, so it is now marketed as treatment for hair loss.
Drug interactions account for 5% to 10% of adverse reactions. Drug
interactions may be caused by pharmacokinetic effects, resulting in a change
in either the drug’s concentration or the drug’s effect. Some of these interactions may be predictable, as a consequence of chemical effects secondary to
enzymatic effects, protein binding, renal and hepatic interactions, and pharmacodynamic interactions. Warfarin may interact with several other medications and dietary factors to increase the active form of this drug to toxic levels,
resulting in over-anticoagulation with resultant bruising and hemorrhage.
Drugs also may have additive effects caused by using two or more agents
designed to produce a similar outcome working synergistically. An example of
this is using a β-adrenergic blocking agent with certain calcium channel
blockers (diltiazem, verapamil). Both medications can decrease heart rate but
by different mechanisms of action. Combining the two may result in profound
bradycardia and hypotension.
Other interactions may be more directly related to the chemical characteristics of the medications or the solutions in which they are delivered. For
example, mixing glargine insulin with other insulin types in the same syringe
may result in precipitation of the insulin product, rendering them ineffective.
Similarly, some IV medications must be administered individually while others can be combined.
To avoid misuse of medications in the elderly, and to identify high risk
medications, an expert consensus panel has met regularly to develop the most
widely used list of medications that should be avoided. This list is called the
Beers criteria. Many of these medications are sedating or have anticholinergic effects that increase the risk of falls. Others have narrow therapeutic
indexes, increasing the risk of toxic serum levels developing. There are often
equally effective alternatives available. If a patient is already on these medications, lowering the dose to the minimum effective dose is another way of
minimizing risk. The full list of medications is available at http://archinte.
ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/163/22/2716.

547

CLINICAL CASES

Drug Metabolism
Many drugs are metabolized in the liver. Medications with a high first-pass
hepatic clearance may be particularly susceptible to adverse events caused
by alterations in hepatic metabolism. Diseases that change the effective circulatory volume, such as congestive heart failure, may also alter the rate of
drug or metabolite elimination because of the effects on hepatic and renal
blood flow.
The CYP system plays a significant role in many real or potential adverse
drug events. Although more than 50 CYP isoenzymes have been identified,
6 of these isoenzymes metabolize 90% of drugs.
Alcohol has effects on the 2E1 isoenzyme. This isoenzyme can produce a
hepatotoxic metabolite of acetaminophen. Because of this, the chronic use of
alcohol and acetaminophen can induce liver damage, and an acetaminophen
overdose, which is already potentially toxic to the liver, is made worse if
mixed with alcohol.
Drugs that have a significant first-pass effect may have an effect on metabolism in the liver or absorption in the intestine. For example, increased levels
of the 3A isoenzyme may result in alterations in the level, and therefore therapeutic effect, of cyclosporine.
Many drugs are albumin bound. When multiple agents are competing for
the same albumin binding sites, there is a potential to have greater amounts
of unbound medication, resulting in higher circulating free drug levels. This
causes particular concern for drugs that have a smaller volume of distribution,
rapid onset of action, or narrow therapeutic index.
Renal considerations are related to interaction of drugs at renal sites and
decreased renal function. Renal interactions are often a result of alterations
in the elimination of water-soluble drugs because of competition for the renal
tubular system. These effects may be either positive or negative. An example
of the beneficial effect of this is the concomitant administration of probenecid
with penicillin. Probenecid decreases renal excretion of penicillin, resulting
in an increased level and therapeutic effect of the antibiotic.
Other renal considerations include decreased kidney function secondary
to either disease processes, such as hypertension or diabetes, or from the natural decline in renal function that occurs with aging. Many medications have
recommendations for alteration in dosing amount or interval based upon the
patient’s creatinine clearance. Creatinine is a product of muscle and the elderly may have falsely elevated calculated creatinine clearance rates because
they have decreased muscle mass. Creatinine clearance can be estimated
using the following equation:
Creatinine clearance =
[(140 − age) × (ideal body weight in kg)] × ( 0.85 for women)
72 × serum creatinine (mg/dL)

Interventions to Reduce the Risk of Adverse Drug Events
There are many possible interventions to reduce the risk of adverse drug events
or interactions, especially in the older population, including the following:
• Use Beers Criteria when considering medications in the elderly. Only pre-

•
•
•

•
•

•
•
•

scribe those medications that are clearly indicated. However, do not avoid a
necessary medication.
When someone presents with a new complaint consider adverse drug reaction
(ADR) in the differential.
Obtain a history of adverse events related to medications on all patients.
Maintain a list of all medications that a patient is taking, including prescribed, over-the-counter, herbal, and homeopathic. Update this list at every
visit.
Instruct your patients to bring in all of their medications regularly to make
sure your medication list is accurate.
Routinely perform drug interaction surveys on patients taking multiple medications. Consider working with pharmacists (often available in nursing
home settings) and using computerized tools available to perform these surveys, including several personal digital assistant (PDA)-based products.
Have knowledge of renal, hepatic, and circulatory issues that affect your
patients.
Consider issues related to individual patients, such as unique genetic or
racial factors.
Document and report suspected adverse drug effects.

B. A multitude of factors result in the elderly being particularly vulnerable to adverse drug events. Included among these are polypharmacy, decreased renal and hepatic function, and pharmacokinetic
and pharmacodynamic considerations.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Along with the biochemical changes that occur with aging, several physical conditions may also affect medication compliance. Arthritic patients
may have difficulty opening prescription caps (especially childproof caps).
Reduced vision may interfere with the ability to properly use a medication.
Memory difficulties may cause trouble adhering to regimens involving
multiple medications. All of these factors, and many others, need to be
considered when prescribing medications to the elderly.

Case 53
A previously healthy 48-year-old accountant presents to his primary
care office for severe back pain. The pain started the previous day after
he helped his daughter move into her college dorm. He denies any
trauma. The pain is generally “achy,” but sometimes characterized as
“sharp” when he moves suddenly. It is located in his lower back and
radiates down the back of both legs to his mid-hamstring. He has been
continent of both bowel and bladder and denies any weakness in his
legs. He denies fever, chills, weight loss, or malaise. It is very difficult to
stand for long periods because he has a hard time finding a comfortable
position. He has never had pain this bad in his back and has tried acetaminophen without much effect. He has no history of cancer or drug
abuse. He is only on an antihypertensive and a baby aspirin per day. On
examination, the patient was found to be well-developed, overweight,
and in moderate discomfort. He had noticeable tenderness bilaterally in
his lumbar paraspinous muscles, back range-of-motion limited by pain,
and both negative straight leg raise and crossed straight raise tests. His
lower extremities had normal strength, reflexes, and sensation.

ANSWERS TO CASE 53:
Acute Low Back Pain
Summary: A previously healthy 48-year-old man presents with acute onset of
low back pain after strenuous activity. His neurological examination is normal
and he denies any systemic complaints.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Acute low back pain also known as lower back
strain

➤

Workup: Nothing more needed until after conservative treatment for at
least 1 month

➤

Treatment: Rest, NSAIDs, and muscle relaxants

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Develop a differential diagnosis for low back pain and explore it with the
history and physical.
2. Learn the “red flag” symptoms of low back pain and how to follow them up.
3. Learn the effective treatments for musculoskeletal back pain.

Considerations
Acute low back is the fifth most likely reason for a visit to the doctor.
Unfortunately, approximately 85% of patients who present with isolated low
back pain will never be given a specific anatomical reason for the pain.
However, up to 90% of patients will recover within 2 weeks of diagnosis.
Since the initial differential of low back pain is broad, the job of the clinician is to decide whether the pain is caused by a systemic disease, if it is associated with a neurologic compromise, and to consider sociologic factors that
may complicate the recovery or efficacy of treatment.
This patient’s history includes pertinent positives of being overweight and
a recent history of lifting and twisting that are associated with lumbar strain.
His symptoms and examination are consistent with a localized musculoskeletal problem. His age and lack of systemic symptoms are pertinent negatives.
He is not depressed or has a history of substance abuse. This clinical scenario
is best managed by symptomatic therapies, without imaging, with close
follow-up in 1 month. Education in lifting and exercise therapy may also be
of special benefit to him.

CLINICAL CASES

APPROACH TO
Low Back Pain
DEFINITIONS
HERNIATED DISC: Rupture of the fibrocartilage between the vertebrae lead-

ing to leakage of the nucleus pulposus that may impinge on the nerve roots
causing pain.
SCIATICA: Pain along the path of the sciatic nerve usually caused by a herniated disk of the lumbar region of the spine, which typically will radiate to
the buttocks and to the back of the thigh.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Acute low back pain should be evaluated in a systematic manner to avoid
missing important red flag symptoms (see Table 53-1) and unnecessary imaging, treatments, or referrals. The first step is to generate a differential diagnosis (see Table 53-2) and understand the common signs and symptoms of its
components.

History, Physical, and Evaluation
The history triages more serious back problems into those needing urgent
attention and those that can be worked up more methodically. Patients presenting with cauda equina syndrome have increasing neurological deficits
and leg weakness, bowel and urinary incontinence, sensory loss in a saddle

distribution, and bilateral sciatica. These patients need immediate evaluation
with lumbar MRI, surgical decompression of the entrapped cauda equina, and
probable operative management. Fevers, direct vertebral tenderness, recent
infections, and a history of intravenous drug use can point toward an infectious process like osteomyelitis, septic diskitis, paraspinous abscess, or epidural
abscess. These infections are evaluated by CBC, ESR, and MRI and require
long courses of intravenous antibiotics and sometimes surgical drainage. An
underlying cancer is much more likely if the patient has a history of cancer
(up to 9% chance), unexplained weight loss, failure to improve after 1 month
of therapy, or an age greater than 50 years old. To further evaluate people with
these risk factors a CBC, ESR, and plain radiographs should be gotten initially. Abnormalities in these tests should be further evaluated by MRI and/or
a bone scan. Common cancers that involve the spine include multiple myeloma
and metastatic prostate, breast, and lung.
The history also helps differentiate less urgent but important causes of back
pain. Sciatica is the classic sign of a herniated disc. It is a back pain that radiates distal to the knee. It increases with Valsalva, sneezing, or coughing. It can
be examined by doing both a straight-leg-raise (91% sensitive, 26% specific)

CLINICAL CASES

555

and a contralateral leg raise test (29% sensitive, 88% specific), along with sensory, strength, and reflex testing of the lower extremities (L4-knee strength and
reflex, L5-great toe and foot dorsiflexion, and S1- plantaflexion and ankle
reflexes). Greater than 90% of lumbar disc compression of nerve roots occurs
at L4/L5 and L5/S1. MRI is not recommended for patients with sciatica unless
the symptoms last for greater than 1 month or if the patient is not a candidate
for surgery or epidural injection. Conservative treatment involves NSAIDs,
possibly short-course steroids, and avoidance of sitting.
Spinal stenosis is the congenital or acquired spinal canal narrowing that
puts pressure on the spinal cord. It presents as lower back and leg pain, leg
weakness, and pseudoclaudication that occurs after walking different distances while the vascularity of the legs remains intact. Pain is relieved by
bending over or sitting. It is more common in those over 65 and its rules of
evaluation are the same as for a herniated disc. It is initially treated with
NSAIDs, physical therapy, and epidural corticosteroids.
Vertebral compression fractures are more common in older people and
those with osteoporosis or chronic steroid use. This may happen after lowimpact trauma or no trauma history at all. The pain is generally well localized
to the spine and may be brought on by certain sudden movements. This is best
initially evaluated by plain x-rays. It can be treated medically with pain control and with calcitonin or alendronate. Surgical management includes vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty.
Psychosocial factors and emotional distress should also be evaluated.
Depression, fear avoidance (fear that activity will cause permanent damage),
job dissatisfaction, current involvement in litigation, reliance on passive
treatments, or somatization are predictors of slow recovery and increase the
risk for developing chronic low back pain. Acknowledgement and management that includes treatment of such factors as applicable may be effective
adjuvant therapy.
The vast majority of patients visiting a doctor for back pain will be diagnosed with lumbar strain. The exact anatomical cause of the pain is often
unknown, but it is hypothesized that there may be an incomplete tear in the
annulus fibrosus. This may leak fluids that create local inflammation or it may
bulge posteriorly irritating certain lumbar roots. Irritation of the surrounding
muscles, tendons, ligaments, or the joint capsule may be coconspirators in this
painful process.

Treatment
The treatment of acute mechanical back pain (less than 4 weeks) centers on
the use of NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, heat, and early mobility. No significant
benefit has been observed with the use of opioids, corticosteroids, or greater
than 2 days of bed rest. Specific exercises are also not found to be helpful.
Massage therapy and spinal manipulation may be of some benefit for acute

556

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

pain; physical therapy has some benefit for short-term pain relief, but studies
do not show long-term benefit. Traction has been shown to not be helpful
mechanical back problems with or without sciatica. For prevention, exercise
has been proven to help prevent back pain in certain subgroups of workers,
but lumbar supports are shown not to prevent back pain.

Comprehension Questions

A 45-year-old man without significant past medical history presents
with severe back pain after lifting boxes at work 2 days ago. Other
than his back pain, his review of symptoms is negative. The pain radiates from his lower back down his posterior thigh to his great toe when
you perform both a straight leg raise test and the contralateral leg
raise. His strength, sensation, and reflexes are preserved. Which of the
following imaging studies should be done immediately?
A. Plain radiographs
B. MRI
C. CT scan
D. No imaging indicated

53.2

A 75-year-old woman comes to her doctor complaining of low back
pain for exactly 1 month after a fall. She has a history of diabetes,
COPD, hypertension, osteoporosis, and breast cancer treated 3 years
ago. She takes calcium supplements every day and alendronate. Which
of the following characteristics would prompt further evaluation?
A. History of steroid use for COPD
B. Caucasian race
C. Time course of back pain
D. History of prior cocaine use
E. Premenopausal age

53.3

A 67-year-old man with coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia, and eczema
comes to you complaining of lower back pain and leg pain. It is worse
when he stands for long periods, but is better when he stoops to push his
shopping cart around a store. He indicates that his feet “burn” and
“ache” after walking different distances every day. Your examination of
his nervous and muscular systems is normal. Which of the following is
the best treatment for this patient?
A. Emergent spinal cord decompression
B. Steroid epidural injection
C. Kyphoplasty
D. Bed rest for 4 days

CLINICAL CASES

557

ANSWERS
53.1

D. The patient has signs and symptoms of a herniated disc. There is
no evidence that imaging within the first month has any morbidity
benefit. If symptoms persist after 1 month, then the MRI would be
the correct choice. X-rays do not show disks or nerve roots, and CT
has poorer visualization of soft tissue than MRI.

53.2

A. The patient’s history is suspicious for a vertebral compression
fracture that could be secondary to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis can be
initiated by the use of steroids, which in this case was used to control
her COPD. The time course of the pain is 4 weeks. Six weeks and
greater is a red flag symptom for further evaluation. While osteoporosis is more common in Caucasian women, it is not considered a
“red flag”. Postmenopausal women are at greater risk for osteoporosis rather than premenopausal women.

53.3

B. The patient’s history is classic for spinal stenosis. Often patients
find relief by sitting or stooping. NSAIDs, physical therapy, and
epidural steroid injections are used to relieve pain. Decompression is
used in cauda equina syndrome and kyphoplasty is useful in vertebral
fractures. Bed rest for more than 2 days is not used in the conservative treatment of back pain for any cause.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Red flag symptoms in low back pain should prompt an immediate diagnostic
workup.
➤ Cauda equine syndrome is a surgical emergency that should be evaluated
immediately by MRI.
➤ A herniated disc can be treated conservatively for 4 weeks before imaging
has any proven benefit.
➤ Lumbar strain is common, generally resolves within a few weeks, and is
treated with NSAIDs, muscle relaxants, and no more than 2 days of bed rest.

Case 54
An 18-month-old male child is brought to your office by his mother for a
routine well-child examination. This is his first visit to your office. According
to his mother he has been seen for regular well-child examinations at another
clinic since birth. The patient is the product of a term spontaneous vaginal delivery without complications. His medical history is unremarkable
and his immunizations are up-to-date. No medical problems run in his family.
He has one older sibling aged 6 with normal growth and development in
the first grade. He lives at home with his parents and older sister. There are
no pets in the home and no one smokes. Overall he eats a well-balanced
diet, although mom reports he is sometimes a picky eater.
The patient’s mother notes that she is concerned because he still does
not use single words, and only babbles, and her other child was using
many words by this age. On further history, you discover he often disregards the calling of his own name, but does startle to loud noises. The
patient’s mother has read about Autism on the internet and is concerned that her son may have this diagnosis. She also states that because
of her concern, if he needs any immunizations today, she does not want
them to be given for fear that this might worsen her son’s condition.
On physical examination, the patient is 50th percentile for height,
and 75th percentile for weight and head circumference. The rest of the
physical examination is normal. On developmental examination you
observe that he walks and runs well, and mom reports that he can walk
up steps and kick a ball forward. Under your observation he only babbles
and utters no words. Also, when given a toy car the patient puts it in his
mouth but never demonstrates rolling the car along the floor or table.
When you call the patient’s name, tap him on the shoulder, say “Look!”
and point to a toy in the corner you are unable to get his attention.

ANSWERS TO CASE 54:
Developmental Disorders
Summary: An 18-month-old child is brought in for a routine well-child examination and found to have a delay in language and social skill development.
➤

Age by which a child should use single words: Most children will say
“mama/dada” indiscriminately by 9 months of age and use two words other
than mama/dada by 12 months of age. No single words by 16 months of age
are a red flag for the presence of an autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

➤

Next step in evaluation of this patient: Your screening of this patient notes
developmental delays concerning for an autism spectrum disorder. You
should complete your screening of this patient with a level 1 standardized
autism-specific screening tool. Also, because of the concerns noted on
examination you should immediately and simultaneously refer the patient
for a comprehensive ASD evaluation, early intervention/early childhood
education services, and an audiologic evaluation.

➤

Timing of immunizations: There is no evidence that immunizations are
implicated as a cause of autism and thus the parents should be counseled
that the routine immunizations are recommended. Concerns have been
raised in the past that the MMR vaccine may precipitate autism based on
reports of parents who first detected autism in their children following
MMR vaccination and an anecdotal study of 12 autistic patients in which
their physicians reported similar suspicions. However, subsequent studies
have failed to show convincing evidence of a link between MMR vaccination and the development of autism. Also, there is no evidence to support
that the use of thimerosal (a mercury-containing preservative) in vaccines
causes autism.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Learn the diagnostic criteria for autism spectrum disorders and the differential diagnosis of pervasive developmental delay.
2. Know the key clinical signs of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs).
3. Be able to formulate a strategy for the assessment of ASDs.

Considerations
This 18-month-old child presents with significant language delay and social
skills delay. These two findings are very suspicious for autism spectrum disorder (ASD). There is no description of stereotyped movement or findings, but

561

CLINICAL CASES

these are not necessary for the diagnosis of ASD. However the child should
also have a hearing screening examination. Because he startles to loud noise,
significant hearing deficit is not likely. This child should have a comprehensive autism assessment.

APPROACH TO
Pervasive Developmental Disorders
DEFINITIONS
JOINT ATTENTION: An infant demonstrates enjoyment in sharing with

another individual an object/event by looking back and forth between the
individual and the object/event.
SOCIAL RELATEDNESS: Internal drive to connect with others and share
similar feelings.

CLINICAL APPROACH
Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) include three of the pervasive developmental disorders identified in the DSM-IV and include autistic disorder (AD),
Asperger syndrome (AS), and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise
specified (PDD-NOS).
According to the most recent studies, the prevalence of ASDs is about 6
per 1000. More boys are affected than girls, with the prevalence four times as
high for males as compared to females. Family studies also estimate a recurrence risk of as much as 5% to 6% when there is an older sibling with an ASD.
As evidenced by the prevalence of ASDs, most physicians will care for several children during the course of their career with an ASD. Furthermore, as
a result of increased media attention intended to raise awareness about these
disorders and the early signs, more and more parents will begin to raise concerns to their child’s physician. Primary care physicians must be able to recognize the key clinical features of these disorders, be able to formulate a
systematic plan to assess them, and know how to assist families with the ongoing treatment and care of a child with an ASD.
ASDs are phenotypically heterogenous neurodevelopmental disorders that
are the result of a combination of factors. Evidence supports multiple gene
involvement with environmental factors influencing the wide variation in
phenotypic expression. Environmental factors implicated include exposures
to teratogens in utero and maternal illnesses during pregnancy, but no studies
have verified a causal role.
Common features shared by all the ASDs include severe deficits in social
skills and limited, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior patterns. However,
only AD and PDD-NOS are characterized by significant language delays.

562

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Although there is no pathognomotic feature, ASDs are universally characterized by deficits in social relatedness, and the early social deficits, such as
delayed or absent joint attention appear to be reliable red flag symptoms.
However, these characteristics frequently go unnoticed by parents and it is a
delay in speech that prompts them to raise a concern with their child’s physician.
In order to diagnose autistic disorder, a child must demonstrate abnormal
behavior before age 3 and must have delays in the areas of social interaction,
language used for social communication, and symbolic or imaginative play.
Deficits include the following:
1. Impaired social interaction:
a. Deficient use of nonverbal behaviors such as facial expressions, eye contact, and gestures.
b. Lack of peer relationships appropriate to developmental age.
c. Does not spontaneously seek social relatedness through shared emotions, interests, or achievements with others.
2. Impaired communication:
a. Delay in/lack of spoken language development.
b. If the child does have adequate speech, there is an impaired ability to
sustain or begin a conversation with others.
c. Repetitious, scripted, or stereotyped use of language.
d. Lack of, or severely delayed pretend play skills.
3. Restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests,
and activities:
a. Repetitive, nonfunctional, atypical behaviors such as hand flapping,
finger movements, rocking, and twirling.
b. Restricted patterns of interest that is atypical in either intensity or
focus.
c. Inflexible adherence to nonfunctional rituals.
d. Preoccupations with parts of objects.
Children with Asperger Syndrome (AS) may go unnoticed until they
are school age and begin to demonstrate difficulties with peer and teacher
interaction. Children with AS have only mild or limited speech delay, but if
observed closely their language has often developed atypically. These children
show deficits in the use of social language, such as choosing a topic of conversation, tempo, facial expression, and body language. Speech is also often
pedantic and limited to only a few topics that hold an all-consuming interest
to the child.
Neurogenetic comorbid conditions and mental retardation have also been
found to be associated with ASDs, although the most recent data indicate the
percentages to be much less than previously thought, 10% and 50%, respectively.
Neurogenetic syndromes that may play a causative role in ASDs or otherwise
may be associated, as well as other PDDs, must be considered in a clinician’s
differential diagnosis. These are included in Table 54–1.

Treatment
The key to successful treatment of ASDs is early diagnosis leading to early
intervention. Surveillance for ASDs should occur at every preventative visit
throughout childhood, and includes eliciting a family history of ASDs,
parental and other caregiver concerns, developmental history, and making
accurate observations of the child. All children should also be screened with
a standardized developmental tool at the 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month visits.
If concerns for an ASD are raised during one of these visits, then a screening
tool specifically designed for ASDs should be used. Available screening tools
include the checklist for autism in toddlers (CHAT) and the modified-CHAT
for children 18 months of age or older. Before 18 months of age, screening tools
that target social and communication skills may be helpful for detecting early
signs of ASDs. If no concerns have been raised during routine preventative visits,
ASD-specific screening is indicated only at the 18- or 24-month preventative
visit. Red flag symptoms indicating the need for immediate evaluation include:
•
•
•
•

No babbling or pointing by 12 months
No single words by 16 months
No 2-word phrases by 24 months
Loss of language or social skills at any age

When a child demonstrates two or more risk factors or a positive screening
result occurs, take immediate action. Do not just “wait-and-see.” The following steps should be accomplished simultaneously:
• Refer the child for a comprehensive ASD evaluation.
• Refer the child to early intervention/early childhood education services.
• Obtain an audiologic evaluation.

Children with ASDs who begin treatment at a younger age have significantly better outcomes, making early identification and intervention critical.
The goals of treatment are to improve language and social skills, decrease maladaptive behaviors, support parents and families, and foster independence.

Comprehension Questions
54.1

A mother brings her 5-year-old son to your office because his teacher
is concerned that he has attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD). The teacher has noticed the child frequently makes longwinded speeches about boats in class and is often rocking back and
forth in his seat. On further history taking, the child’s mother states
that he is very independent with few friends, and has always been
interested in boats, preferring them over all other toys. You observe
that his speech is monotone and restricted in volume and rate and he
never makes eye contact with you or his mother. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this child?
A. An Asperger-specific screening tool appropriate for the child’s age
is the next important step.
B. The most important issue for today’s visit is to administer vaccinations the child is missing.
C. This child should be started on oral amphetamine-like compounds,
which will likely lead to much improved behavior.
D. This parent should be reassured, as this child’s behavior and development is most likely a variant of normal.
E. It is probable that one of the vaccinations is responsible for this
child’s clinical findings.

54.2

Which of the following statements is accurate?
A. A previously healthy, normally developing 3-year-old child begins to
lose bladder control and will no longer speak in sentences, but you
should not be too concerned because this began after the birth of her
younger sibling and she just wants more attention from her parents.
B. No use of single words by 12 months of age in a child is reason for
immediate referral to speech therapy.
C. Children with ASDs will rarely grow up to be independent adults.
D. You counsel the parents of a 6-year-old son with autism that their
second child is at increased risk for having an ASD.

54.3

Which of the following observations during a clinical examination is
concerning for the presence of an ASD?
A. You walk into the examination room and find a 36-month-old
child pretending to have tea with her imaginary friend.
B. A 12-month-old child walks over to the sink, and points toward
the faucet, but only utters, “Uh,” and does not say water.
C. A 2-year-old child is holding tightly to a tattered old blanket,
which his mother says he will not leave the house without.
D. You tap an 18-month-old child on the shoulder, say, “Look!” and
point to a toy in the corner of the room, but the child ignores you
and continues to spin the wheels on his toy car.

566

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

ANSWERS
54.1

A. While at first glance the concerns of this child’s teacher and
mother may sound typical for ADHD, your clinical suspicion should
be that the child has Asperger syndrome, based on a history of monotone, restricted speech limited to only one topic of interest, lack of
eye contact, lack of peer relationships appropriate to developmental
age, and the repetitive, nonfunctional, atypical behavior of rocking
and twirling. Appropriate steps at this time include a complete history and physical examination accompanied by an Asperger-specific
screening tool and immediate referral to a developmental pediatrician
for a complete evaluation. You should reassure the child’s mother that
immunizations are not implicated in the cause of developmental disorders and administer any vaccines needed. You should not delay your diagnostic workup for a developmental disorder for any reason. Although
immunizations are important, for this child’s situation, evaluation of
the developmental problems is of higher priority.

54.2

D. Family studies estimate a recurrence risk of as much as 5% to 6%
when there is an older sibling with an ASD. Red flag symptoms indicating the need for an immediate evaluation for an ASD include loss
of language or social skills at any age and no use of single words by
16 months of age. Although most children with an ASD will retain
their diagnosis and exhibit residual signs of their disorder into adulthood, children with ASDs who begin treatment at a younger age
have significantly better outcomes, and one of the goals of treatment
is to foster independence.

54.3

D. The child in answer choice (D) demonstrates a deficit in joint
attention, one of the most distinguishing characteristics of very
young children with ASDs. It is the lack of pretend play skills, rather
than their presence (choice A), that is concerning for an ASD. As
demonstrated in answer choice (B) at about 12 to 14 months of age, a
typically developing child will begin to request a desired object that is
out of reach by pointing, and, depending on the child’s speech skills,
may utter simple sounds or actual words. Similar to answer choice
(C) most children will form attachments during their early development with a stuffed animal, special pillow or blanket. However, children with ASDs may prefer hard items such as ballpoint pens, keys, or
flashlights.

CLINICAL CASES

567

Clinical Pearls
➤ Common features shared by all the ASDs include severe deficits in social
skills and limited, repetitive, and stereotyped behavior patterns. However,
only AD and PDD-NOS are characterized by significant language delays.
➤ Red flag symptoms indicating the need for immediate evaluation for an
ASD include: no babbling or pointing by 12 months, no single words by
16 months, no 2-word phrases by 24 months, and loss of language or social
skills at any age.
➤ When a child demonstrates two or more risk factors or a positive screening
result occurs, take immediate action.

Case 55
A 46-year-old woman presents to your office complaining of a hand
tremor that has been steadily worsening over the past 2 years. She works
as a literary agent and states that this tremor is increasingly impairing
her ability to work. She tells you in a slightly quivering voice, “I am
often required to take my clients out to lunch, and I get embarrassed
when I cannot eat and drink normally. Sometimes, I cannot even drink
from a cup without shaking.” She finds that a glass of wine with her meal
sometimes helps. On examination, her blood pressure is 125/85 mm Hg, her
pulse is 84 beats/min, and her respiratory rate is 16 breaths/min. Neurologic
examination reveals a mild head tremor, but no resting tremor of the hands.
When she holds a pen by its tip at arm’s length, however, a coarse tremor
becomes readily visible. The rest of her examination is normal.

ANSWERS TO CASE 55:
Movement Disorders
Summary: A 46-year-old woman presents with a classic essential tremor. It
comes on during action and remits when the limb is relaxed, unlike the
tremor of Parkinson disease. She is very disturbed by the tremor as it is leading to a great deal of social embarrassment, often interfering with her work.
She has found that alcohol helps to reduce the symptoms.
➤

Most likely diagnosis: Essential tremor.

➤

Further evaluation necessary: Ensure that medications, thyroid disease,
alcohol, or other neurologic diseases are not causing the tremor.

➤

Beneficial pharmacotherapy: Propanolol, primidone, and gabapentin.

ANALYSIS
Objectives
1. Become familiar with the presenting signs and symptoms of the most common movement disorders.
2. Become familiar with the management of common movement disorders.
3. Be able to gauge the severity of disease and understand side effects of therapies.

Considerations
Essential tremor is the most common of all movement disorders, affecting 1.3%
to 5% of persons over the age of 60. A complete history is crucial in making the
diagnosis of essential tremor. It usually appears after the age of 50 and interferes
with common tasks and activities of daily living. Many patients have a family history of tremor, although this is not a criterion for diagnosis. It is often attenuated
with the use of alcohol. It is important to ask about the consumption of caffeine,
cigarette smoking, stimulant use, and inquire about other medications (eg,
inhaled β-agonists, levothyroxine, lithium) that are known to cause or enhance
physiologic tremor. When essential tremor is suspected, the patient should be
observed while performing common tasks such as drinking from a glass. It affects
the hands in 95%, the head in 34%, and the lower extremities in 20% of patients.
When patients under the age of 40 years present with an action tremor, they
should also be evaluated for Wilson disease, a disorder of copper metabolism.
Pharmacotherapy constitutes the main approach to treatment. First-line
therapies include the β-blocker propanolol and the anticonvulsant primidone.
They are equally efficacious in reducing tremor symptoms. Gabapentin is
another anticonvulsant which can be used as a second-line agent, although

571

CLINICAL CASES

experience is limited. The patient’s report of symptoms and functional ability,
rather than the severity of tremor detected on physical examination, should
serve as guides for adjustment of therapy. It is also important to monitor patients
for side effects of these medications. Propanolol is associated with fatigue,
headaches, bradycardia, impotence, and depression. Primidone can cause an
acute reaction consisting of nausea, vomiting, or ataxia in many patients.
As with therapy for Parkinson disease, both deep brain stimulation and
ablation of the ventral intermediate nucleus of the thalamus (Vim nucleus)
are effective in patients with tremor that is refractory to medical treatment.

APPROACH TO
Movement Disorders
DEFINITIONS
CHOREA: Unpredictable, irregular, brief movement that are jerky, writhing,

or flowing.
HYPERKINESIAS: Movement disorders characterized by extra or exaggerated

movements.
HYPOKINESIAS: Movement disorders characterized by overall slowness of

movement (bradykinesia), lack of movement (akinesia), or difficulty in initiating movement.

CLINICAL APPROACH
A movement disorder can be defined as any condition that disrupts normal voluntary movement of the body or that consists of one or more abnormal movements. They can be classified as hypokinesias or hyperkinesias (see Table 55–1).

CASE FILES: Fa m i l y M e d i c i n e

Though less frequently encountered by family physicians than other chronic
diseases, they are fairly common, especially in the elderly population. Parkinson
disease, for example, affects 1% of those over 65 and 2% of those over 85 years
of age.
Movement disorders present a special challenge to family physicians for
many reasons. Signs and symptoms can often be subtle. The normal process of
aging is associated with changes in movement that may be mistaken for a more
serious problem. Patients suffering from the same movement disorder can often
present in a variety of different ways. Finally, laboratory and radiologic testing
is often of limited value in the diagnosis of movement disorders.
Management is equally challenging. Movement disorders have a great
impact on other medical conditions as well as on the psychological well-being
of patients and their families. Although pharmacotherapy and surgeries are
often administered by specialists, family physicians must help patients cope
with the broad impact of their disease.

Parkinson Disease
Parkinson disease is the most common neurodegenerative disease, and can
cause significant disability and decreased quality of life. Symptoms appear as
neurons and dopamine are lost from the substantia nigra and intracytoplasmic
inclusions (Lewy bodies) proliferate. The cardinal physical signs of the disease are distal resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability,
and asymmetric onset. Although not a “classic” feature, patients also have a
positive glabella tap reflex.
Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for Parkinson disease, and
has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. The goals are twofold: the
protection of neurons to slow down or stop disease progression and symptomatic therapy. Levodopa is the primary treatment for Parkinson disease,
although its long-term use is limited by motor complications, drug-induced
dyskinesia, and psychosis. Levodopa is given in combination with carbidopa,
which prevents the peripheral destruction of levodopa and allows it to cross
the blood-brain barrier.
Dopamine agonists such as bromocriptine, pergolide, and pramipexole are
options for initial treatment and have been shown to delay the onset of motor
complications. However, they are inferior to levodopa in controlling motor
symptoms. It is often beneficial to initiate adjuvant therapy with dopamine
agonists, catechol O-methyltransferase inhibitors, or monoamine oxidase-B
inhibitors after levodopa-related motor complications develop in advanced
Parkinson disease. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has been
shown to ameliorate symptoms in patients with advanced disease. Common
psychiatric problems associated with Parkinson disease include depression,
dementia, and psychosis. Psychosis is usually drug-induced and can be managed initially by reducing the dose of antiparkinsonian medications.
Consultation with a subspecialist is often required.

CLINICAL CASES

573

Since the functional impairment of Parkinson disease is progressive, discussion of advance directives is appropriate with all patients. Education and
support are important ways patients can cope with their illness.

Tourette Syndrome
Tourette syndrome is the most common tic disorder, usually developing during childhood or early adolescence. Heredity is thought to play a major role
in its etiology. The diagnosis requires the presence of multiple motor and one
or more vocal tics, tics occurring several times a day for at least 1 year, onset
before age 21, and having tics that cannot be explained by other medical conditions. There are a number of different types of tics and they may worsen during
periods of stress, excitement, boredom, or fatigue. The majority of affected
children also suffer from coexisting attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), obsessive-compulsive symptoms, or migraine headaches.
Pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment and should only be started if
there is functional impairment. The dopamine receptor blockers haloperidol and
pimozide are widely used and very effective treatments for tics. The α-receptor
agonists clonidine and guanfacine are effective for treating mild tics. Both also
help improve symptoms of accompanying ADHD. Treatment of accompanying
ADHD and obsessive-compulsive symptoms is absolutely essential.

Huntington Disease
The most common cause of chorea among adults occurs in Huntington disease.
Huntington disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and affects
men and women in equal numbers. It is caused by a genetic mutation of the IT15
gene located on chromosome 4b. Onset may be at any age, though symptoms
first appear between 35 to 50 years of age. There are two types of movement
abnormalities: chorea and abnormal voluntary movements. The latter include
uncoordinated fine motor movements, gait disturbances, abnormal eye movements, dysarthria, dysphagia, and rigidity. Difficulties with voluntary movements
get worse with time. Cognitive problems include difficulties with memory, visuospatial abilities, and judgement. A global dementia may be present in patients
with advanced disease. The most common psychiatric problem is depression,
which affects up to 40% of patients. Almost 13% of patients commit suicide.
There is currently no treatment available to slow the progression of disease.
Treatment should target the signs and symptoms, and be adjusted according to
disease severity. The chorea does respond favorably to haloperidol and
fluphenazine, though such treatment often makes voluntary movements worse.
The chorea can also be treated with reserpine, tetrabenazine, and clonazepam.
Depression should be aggressively treated with conventional antidepressants
such as SSRIs. The primary counseling responsibility of the family physician is
to understand the role of genetic testing and to offer it to affected and asymptomatic individuals in a responsible manner.

Comprehension Questions
55.1

An 18-year-old adolescent male patient is noted to have motor tics
and involuntary, obscene vocalizations. Which of the following medications is most effective in the treatment of this disorder?
A. Trihexyphenidyl (Artane)
B. Phenytoin (Dilantin)
C. Carbamazepine (Tegretol)
D. Haloperidol (Haldol)

55.2

A 21-year-old woman develops auditory hallucinations and persecutory
delusions over the course of 3 days. She was hospitalized and started on
haloperidol 2 mg three times daily. Within a week of treatment, she developed stooped posture and a shuffling gait. Her head was slightly tremulous
and her movements became slowed. Her medication was changed to thioridazine (Mellaril), and trihexyphenidyl (Artane) was added. Over the next
2 weeks, she became much more animated and reported no recurrence of
her hallucinations. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?
A. Hyperparathyroidism
B. Neuroleptic effect
C. Encephalitis
D. Hypermagnesemia

55.3

Which of the following represents the decrement in speech commonly
exhibited by the patient with parkinsonism?
A. Progressively inaudible speech
B. Neologisms
C. Expressive aphasia
D. Receptive aphasia
E. Word salad

55.4

A 67-year-old woman with known Parkinson disease is brought to the
clinic by her health-care provider. She is confined to a wheel chair
and completely dependent on others. You notice large grossly abnormal
movements in both the arms and legs. The patient has to be strapped
in to avoid falling out and can’t keep her shoes on. Bed rails have had
to be installed on her bed to prevent her from falling out at night. She
does not know the month or the year. She has not had a change in her
medication in 6 months. Which of the following medication adjustments would benefit her most?
A. Add Haloperidol
B. Decrease Levodopa/Carbodopa
C. Increase Levodopa/Carbodopa
D. Add Donepezil
E. Add Entacapone

CLINICAL CASES

575

ANSWERS
55.1

D. The clinical scenario described is that associated with Tourette
syndrome. A variety of drugs may help suppress the tics that are characteristic of this syndrome. These include haloperidol, pimozide, trifluoperazine, and fluphenazine. Antiepileptics, such as carbamazepine
and phenytoin, are not useful. Trihexyphenidyl and benztropine are
useful in suppressing the parkinsonism that may develop with
haloperidol administration, but are not useful in the management of
Tourette syndrome.

55.2

B. Butyrophenones, the most commonly prescribed of which is
haloperidol, routinely produce some signs of parkinsonism if they are
used at high doses for more than a few days. This psychotic young
woman proved to be less sensitive to the parkinsonian side effects of
the phenothiazine thioridazine than she was to haloperidol. Adding
the anticholinergic drug trihexyphenidyl may have also helped to
reduce the patient’s symptoms.

55.3

A. Language is not disturbed in Parkinson disease, as it is with aphasias.
The clarity and volume of speech is what suffers. Handwriting is similarly disturbed, as the patient has increasingly smaller and less legible penmanship as he or she continues to write. This is referred to as
micrographia.

55.4

B. The patient is suffering from dyskinesias from too much levodopa/
carbodopa. A reduction in these medications would be of the most
benefit to her. Haloperidol would be a good choice if the patient was
suffering from hallucinations. Donepezil is a medication used primarily
for Alzheimer dementia and has no use in Lewy Body dementia.
Entacapone is a medication to enhance levodopa/carbodopa.

Clinical Pearls
➤ Movement disorders have a profound impact on the quality of life of
patients and their families. Family physicians should become adept at
counseling patients about prognosis and the availability of support
groups and community resources.
➤ The management of certain movement disorders including Parkinson disease is rapidly changing. It is important to find the latest information about
emerging and alternative therapies, and to seek the help of a specialist
when required.
